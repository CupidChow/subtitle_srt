[Episode 25]

4
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:40,320
Nowadays,

5
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:42,880
there would be a job as long as I work hard.

6
00:01:44,539 --> 00:01:45,090
How about…

7
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:47,610
How about we go back to our hometown?

8
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,740
Yours or mine, it's all fine.

9
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,420
We won't stay in the city anymore.

10
00:01:51,979 --> 00:01:52,729
Didi.

11
00:01:54,539 --> 00:01:55,550
-Didi.
-Congrui.

12
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:56,950
Sister.

13
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:58,740
What are you doing here?

14
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:00,640
Who's this?

15
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:04,450
Congrui,

16
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:06,400
can you do me a favor?

17
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,840
No need to ask.

18
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:08,979
Just tell me.

19
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:10,660
I admit

20
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,690
that I didn't like the fact

21
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:14,090
that you had a divorce

22
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:15,920
and an abortion at first,

23
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:17,829
and that I didn't want you to be with Junxiao.

24
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:20,020
But Junxiao got mad at me

25
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,050
and reported my boyfriend.

26
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:23,860
Now, he won't even come back home.

27
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,060
We haven't spoken

28
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:27,290
to each other for a long time.

29
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,690
My boyfriend has lost his job.

30
00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:30,860
Can you help me

31
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,300
talk to him?

32
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:41,990
It looks like Didi

33
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,280
hasn't returned to the hospital.

34
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:51,220
Your house isn't far away from the hospital,

35
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,960
but there's still a distance of several metro stations.

36
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:54,500
A kitten doesn't know how to take the metro.

37
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,270
Let's try the blocks near your house.

38
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:57,750
I looked for him overnight.

39
00:02:58,980 --> 00:02:59,620
Didn't you say

40
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,420
that he was a home cat?

41
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,170
Yes, he is.

42
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,750
He wouldn't even

43
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:05,680
be willing to leave the house.

44
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:07,590
He thought we'd abandon him again.

45
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:09,630
Last night, my mom

46
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:10,920
opened the window to let in some fresh air,

47
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:11,800
then it went missing.

48
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:14,580
A wild cat

49
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:15,660
can never change its nature.

50
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,520
Didi is different.

51
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:19,120
Didi and Ruirui

52
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,760
are like me and Du Di.

53
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,730
They grow up together.

54
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:24,150
They go through difficulties together.

55
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,170
And they fight against enemies together.

56
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:26,380
They also witnessed

57
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,540
our friendship.

58
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:31,740
People say

59
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,090
bestieship is as breakable as plastic.

60
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:36,260
In my opinion,

61
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:38,260
plastic isn't that fragile after all.

62
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:39,500
The so-called bestieship

63
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,370
is like a piece of toilet paper.

64
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,840
It looks white and clean,

65
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,329
but a splash of water can taint it.

66
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,300
Human relationships are hard to read.

67
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,520
Even the brother and sister

68
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:53,820
who grew up together may fall out.

69
00:03:54,579 --> 00:03:55,660
What's the point of what you are doing here?

70
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:58,550
A splash of water damages things

71
00:03:58,870 --> 00:03:59,850
because one of them

72
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,000
didn't take precautions from water.

73
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,790
Siblings fall out

74
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:04,300
because one of them

75
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,970
values material more than family bonds.

76
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,790
I don't want

77
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:08,810
to be the one who doesn't take precautions from water.

78
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:10,340
I hope you

79
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:11,190
don't become a person

80
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,060
who values material.

81
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:15,820
My sister spoke to you?

82
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:17,620
You should go home.

83
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:20,970
No matter what mistake she made,

84
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,340
she's your family.

85
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:24,010
She's the only woman

86
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:24,820
who's sacrificing everything she has

87
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:26,000
for you.

88
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,470
Why can't she have your forgiveness?

89
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:29,860
I mean, she forgave you,

90
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:31,460
didn't she?

91
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,140
I'm so lucky

92
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:38,620
to have my sister,

93
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:39,780
and you.

94
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:43,470
We need to find a job

95
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,420
for Wang Dacheng in a hurry,

96
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:45,670
or else,

97
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,020
your sister won't live a happy life.

98
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:48,890
OK.

99
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:00,850
My love,

100
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:02,640
I have found a job.

101
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,160
I now work as a chauffeur.

102
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:12,660
Come on, please.

103
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,310
Congrui's dad got

104
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,010
Wang Dacheng a new job.

105
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:18,340
He's now working

106
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:19,310
as a chauffeur for the boss of a foreign company.

107
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,130
In the future,

108
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:21,440
he will be wearing a suit

109
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:22,840
and white gloves at work.

110
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,420
Congrui

111
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:27,300
is such a good girl.

112
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,160
Now you know?

113
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:31,500
Oh, right.

114
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,210
I'm going home for dinner tonight.

115
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:34,830
I want some stuffed buns.

116
00:05:35,659 --> 00:05:36,090
Sure.

117
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,340
What fillings do you like?

118
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:38,190
I'll make the buns.

119
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:43,600
You were one of the judges,

120
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:44,650
weren't you?

121
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,100
Could you spill the beans, please?

122
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:48,909
So this is why

123
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:49,980
you hurriedly

124
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:51,460
got me downstairs?

125
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:52,860
Or what?

126
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:54,210
You thought I was in love with you?

127
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:55,540
Fine.

128
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:56,950
Seeing Mrs. Wang is so concerned

129
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,020
about you.

130
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,220
I'll let you know how I set the questions.

131
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:02,810
Normally,

132
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,660
the questions are set based on real cases.

133
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,150
They show the clinic experience

134
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:06,930
or even the failures

135
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:08,340
of the question-setter.

136
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,600
There's no right answer in the medical field,

137
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,050
only the optimal option.

138
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,580
The decision that person

139
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:16,040
made at that very moment

140
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:17,500
in that very scenario,

141
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:18,700
it was unique.

142
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:19,430
Remember,

143
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:21,100
time, scenario,

144
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:21,900
and the decision-maker.

145
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:23,830
The setting of a question matters.

146
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:24,620
So

147
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:26,060
as long as it isn't against the principle,

148
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:27,400
there can be

149
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:28,580
more than one answer.

150
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:29,800
You can even make

151
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:30,430
a completely different decision

152
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:31,780
from what the question-setter did.

153
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:33,500
But you must think carefully.

154
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:34,940
When you ask questions,

155
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:36,460
you are to be precise and thorough.

156
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:38,050
One more tip for you.

157
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:38,780
What?

158
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:39,720
The question-setter

159
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,220
is not a real patient,

160
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,670
so don't be afraid to ask more questions.

161
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:45,710
The more you ask,

162
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:46,700
the more they're likely to give themselves away.

163
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,780
That sounds exciting.

164
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,070
It makes me want to participate in the competition.

165
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:52,180
Exciting?

166
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,650
It'll be discouragement if you lose.

167
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:55,060
If a doctor fails

168
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,940
to get the key point,

169
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,850
it'll be a heavy blow

170
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:00,730
to their pride and ego.

171
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:08,840
I see Nianbai has finally got off your back.

172
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:10,730
He's busy with his project.

173
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,470
Wu Congrui has reached out

174
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,830
to everyone she can get help from.

175
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:14,900
You, on the other hand,

176
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:16,400
seem quite chill.

177
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:16,990
I don't need that.

178
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:18,260
You need to

179
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:19,700
learn to

180
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:20,640
show softness sometimes.

181
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:21,170
You know what?

182
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,740
You give off the vibe

183
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,790
of you being a tough lady

184
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,070
every day,

185
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:25,910
and people will

186
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:26,750
think you are a tough lady.

187
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:27,950
So they'll think you don't need any help

188
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:28,750
even when they can be helpful

189
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,100
because you may be against it.

190
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:31,410
But I really don't need any help.

191
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:33,930
Well.

192
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,159
All geniuses

193
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,230
are lonely.

194
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:37,250
Good luck.

195
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:38,220
Oh, right.

196
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,500
I suggest you talk

197
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:41,510
to Nianbai about

198
00:07:41,659 --> 00:07:42,470
his dad and me.

199
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:43,450
He doesn't have to burden everything.

200
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,640
It's none of my business.

201
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,290
Aren't you birds of a feather?

202
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,170
You are nearly as dislikeable

203
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:51,170
as I am.

204
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:52,000
See you later.

205
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,450
Liu Nianbai? What's the matter with him?

206
00:07:58,820 --> 00:07:59,980
Congrui, if you have more questions,

207
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:01,700
just send me a WeChat message.

208
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,210
Look how much trouble it was for me

209
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:03,960
to go all the way here.

210
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,640
Can we be WeChat friends?

211
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:06,670
Why not?

212
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:07,830
In fact, you should ask yourself

213
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:09,490
why you aren't my WeChat friend yet.

214
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:10,780
I didn't dare to ask.

215
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:11,770
I'll scan yours.

216
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,350
All right, I'm off.

217
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:19,080
I'll see you off.

218
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:19,910
No, thanks.

219
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:21,100
Like I'll get lost in this building.

220
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:21,940
Just do what you gotta do.

221
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,270
-Thank you, Director Tian.
-Thank you.

222
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:27,490
So?

223
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,320
Fruitful, no?

224
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:30,660
I heard a few days ago

225
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,920
that some judges

226
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:32,740
had arrived early,

227
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:34,090
and they'd be giving lectures in other hospitals.

228
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,080
I've got the tickets for you.

229
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,510
What is this group?

230
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,300
My God, so many doctors.

231
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:45,590
Shengji Emergency Department.

232
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,650
Cardiology, Cardiac Surgery,

233
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:47,840
Neurology, Neurosurgery, General Surgery,

234
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:49,510
and doctors from other hospitals.

235
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:50,820
There's like more than a hundred of them.

236
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:51,640
Pretty much, yes.

237
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:53,770
How come you know so many people?

238
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,240
I'm the chief resident.

239
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:57,570
I need to make connections

240
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:58,330
with every department.

241
00:08:58,580 --> 00:08:59,510
Job demand, you know.

242
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:01,170
And it makes things easy

243
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:02,040
for me at work

244
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:03,900
if I keep a good relationship with each department.

245
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:04,920
Especially when there's a collaboration

246
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,280
between several departments.

247
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:07,960
And collaborations are only needed

248
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,460
for important cases.

249
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,740
Good job, former president of the students' union.

250
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:14,510
Li Junxiao has the potential

251
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:15,820
to be a head director.

252
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,300
You two ladies

253
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,050
have stolen

254
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,620
all the thunder,

255
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,340
or he would have been a star doctor.

256
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:22,420
Good for you.

257
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:40,000
Her condition worsens suddenly.

258
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:41,480
What did Director Tian say?

259
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:44,010
He suggested hospitalization.

260
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:48,260
You may lose the baby.

261
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,080
Nonsense.

262
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:52,810
Director Tian never said that.

263
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,320
Back at home,

264
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:55,620
you chose a folk prescription

265
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:56,490
over hypotensive pills.

266
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:57,860
Now, her urine protein

267
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:58,900
has increased largely,

268
00:09:59,100 --> 00:09:59,870
which may cause

269
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,220
irreversible damage to her kidneys.

270
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:02,580
She's now 25 weeks pregnant

271
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:03,680
with chronic hypertension

272
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:05,070
and severe preeclampsia.

273
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:06,220
If the treatment in the following days

274
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:06,810
doesn't work,

275
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:07,970
Director Tian, too,

276
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:09,500
will suggest termination of pregnancy.

277
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:12,810
But

278
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,050
even if it works,

279
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:15,740
my mother is old

280
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:16,780
and in poor health,

281
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:18,170
there will be no point in hanging in.

282
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,900
Instead of the eternal damage to her body

283
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:21,750
and the induced labor 26 weeks later,

284
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:23,310
we should put an end to her misery now.

285
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:24,130
Enough.

286
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:26,030
I know you don't want a little brother.

287
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,700
I don't believe a single word that you say.

288
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:29,020
Yongfu,

289
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:30,660
when will Director Tian come?

290
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,640
Director Tian is busy.

291
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,350
I saw the prescription he wrote.

292
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:34,620
It's mainly antihypertensive measures.

293
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:35,820
It won't solve the problem.

294
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:37,620
Her pregnancy is the root cause.

295
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,580
If you don't believe me,

296
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:40,370
you can wait for him.

297
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:41,730
But I hope you

298
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,490
realize

299
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:44,980
what's more important.

300
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,470
My mother's life or

301
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,020
an unhealthy premature baby.

302
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:50,620
Mom,

303
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,470
God bless you.

304
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:54,510
Mom,

305
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:56,540
don't worry.

306
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:58,060
I contacted another doctor.

307
00:10:58,740 --> 00:10:59,780
We'll ask her in secret.

308
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,840
If Du Di spoke the truth,

309
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,960
then we'll give up.

310
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:05,620
But if they say something different,

311
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,210
we'll keep the baby.

312
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:08,060
OK.

313
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:11,010
Is this doctor trustworthy?

314
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,180
The last time I came,

315
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,260
she helped created the file.

316
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:15,410
Mr. Du.

317
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:17,660
Dr. Wu.

318
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,870
Why don't you go see me in the ward?

319
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,280
This is my mother.

320
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:21,580
Du Di's grandmother.

321
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:23,380
Hello, ma'am.

322
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:24,210
Hi.

323
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:25,020
Please sit.

324
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,220
Ma'am,

325
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:29,290
how old are you?

326
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:32,000
How was your trip?

327
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:33,260
I'm not even 80 years old.

328
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:34,700
I still have a strong body.

329
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:35,170
The trip was okay.

330
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:37,390
Look like so.

331
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:38,420
Dr. Wu.

332
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:41,320
Du Di's mother was just hospitalized.

333
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,690
Can you please have a look

334
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:44,900
and give your advice?

335
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,260
What did Du Di say?

336
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,740
Du Di was a bit worried.

337
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:50,890
She couldn't draw a conclusion.

338
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,480
Let me see.

339
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:59,840
25 weeks.

340
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:01,680
It's pretty serious.

341
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:12,980
Ma'am, don't worry.

342
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:14,260
I'll explain her mother's condition

343
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,660
to you, shall I?

344
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:16,900
Sure, sure.

345
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:18,050
For a pregnant woman with

346
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:19,660
severe preeclampsia,

347
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,010
if it's a less-than-26-week

348
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,080
pregnancy,

349
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:23,150
and the patient is still in a bad condition

350
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,380
after treatment,

351
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:25,860
we normally suggest the termination of pregnancy.

352
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:27,930
26 to28 weeks.

353
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,140
It depends on her health

354
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,610
whether we'd take

355
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,070
proactive measures or not.

356
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:34,310
But after 28 weeks,

357
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:35,180
if her health condition is still unstable,

358
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,490
we'll terminate her pregnancy.

359
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:37,360
If otherwise,

360
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,990
we'll get ready for the operation and labor.

361
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:41,500
I don't understand what you are saying.

362
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:43,620
Let me put it simply,

363
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,100
before 26 weeks,

364
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,300
give up the baby.

365
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,220
26 to 28 weeks,

366
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,300
we can try to keep it.

367
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:51,610
After 28 weeks,

368
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,740
it depends on the mother's health

369
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,260
whether a cesarean is doable.

370
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:56,390
But it'll depend

371
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:58,190
on her health condition.

372
00:12:58,460 --> 00:12:59,840
Because a baby born before 26 weeks

373
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,100
is an extremely premature birth,

374
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,480
and the fetus has a very low chance of survival,

375
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:04,180
though Shengji Hospital

376
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,280
is one of the best

377
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:06,780
in saving patients with severe diseases

378
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:07,810
and premature babies.

379
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,390
If she can make it

380
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:10,420
until after 26 weeks,

381
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:11,490
there's a chance

382
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:12,430
to keep the baby.

383
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,880
So one week later,

384
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:18,000
the doctors won't tell us to get an abortion,

385
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:18,600
right?

386
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:22,580
Have I not explained myself well?

387
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:23,730
Where does that

388
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,760
misinterpretation come from?

389
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:26,780
Here's the thing.

390
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:27,660
All in all,

391
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,340
it depends on

392
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,910
her health condition.

393
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:31,980
I have seen the indicators.

394
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:33,380
It doesn't look optimistic.

395
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:35,050
But there's a chance

396
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,580
-if you insist on keeping the baby.
-OK, OK.

397
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:37,430
We'll wait and see

398
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:38,300
how things go these days.

399
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:40,740
-I understand.
-Thank you.

400
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,260
I understand now.

401
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:43,660
You mean

402
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:45,140
we can try keeping the baby.

403
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:47,100
But why did Du Di say that…

404
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,090
What did Du Di say?

405
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:49,430
She threw out the word abortion

406
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:50,600
without thinking.

407
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:55,220
Mr. Du,

408
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,110
there's a high chance that you'll lose the baby.

409
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,710
We can only adopt

410
00:13:58,820 --> 00:13:59,820
proactive measures.

411
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:00,860
I see.

412
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:01,940
Thank you,

413
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:02,930
Dr. Wu.

414
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:04,370
Thank you.

415
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,370
Can you not

416
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:07,920
step in our family business?

417
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:09,300
Did you check my mother's protein in her urine?

418
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:10,620
Four pluses.

419
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:12,050
Are you going to murder her?

420
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:12,880
Please be calm.

421
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:13,840
Your grandmother and dad

422
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:14,910
came to me without notice,

423
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:15,460
so I just

424
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:16,740
explained your mother's condition to them.

425
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,540
I didn't give them too much information.

426
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:19,610
I just said something

427
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:20,630
that a doctor should say.

428
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,020
What is something that a doctor should say?

429
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,360
You suggested them keep the baby.

430
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:24,990
My mother is 50 years old.

431
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:25,900
She's not young.

432
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:26,940
And she's in

433
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:28,450
constant poor health.

434
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:29,630
Once she's 26 weeks pregnant,

435
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,650
it'd be beyond saving.

436
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:31,840
Two lives would be dead.

437
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,260
Is this what you want?

438
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,920
How can you see me that way?

439
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:36,620
I know

440
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,480
that it's a precarious situation,

441
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:38,900
but is it okay

442
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:39,860
that you just bluntly

443
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:40,730
told your dad to give up the baby?

444
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,660
I know you never wanted

445
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:43,400
your mother to have this baby

446
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:44,460
from the start,

447
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:45,780
but could you please

448
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:46,750
have some empathy

449
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:47,980
for your mother?

450
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:48,860
Maybe you don't know

451
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:49,960
how it feels to be a mother,

452
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,150
but I know

453
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:52,230
how much a mother

454
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:53,860
would like to keep her baby alive.

455
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:54,650
Du Di,

456
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,400
if you want the best for your mother,

457
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:57,850
you should try to understand her

458
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:59,050
and help her keep the baby

459
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,600
instead of questioning me here.

460
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:02,770
I'll ask you one thing.

461
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:04,370
If it happened to your mother,

462
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,110
would you say the same?

463
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,190
Du Di,

464
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:08,390
I'm doing it for you.

465
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,660
Don't be so obstinate, please.

466
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:11,930
And please loosen up a little.

467
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:13,500
My philosophy

468
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:14,700
is that I let the flow take me

469
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,970
but I'll slightly change the world

470
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:16,950
instead of

471
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,020
fighting against it.

472
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:19,100
I'm obstinate?

473
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:20,170
I'm uptight?

474
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:21,060
Are you aware

475
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,290
that you're speaking in the same tone

476
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,760
as Li Junxiao?

477
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:25,460
You like him, I don't care.

478
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:26,540
But please stay

479
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:27,410
out of my family business.

480
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:29,460
I knew it's about Li Junxiao.

481
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:30,720
You made a whole speech

482
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:31,510
about how I'm better off

483
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:32,420
without him,

484
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,410
you just don't want me

485
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:34,350
to be together with him, right?

486
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:35,020
It's not like that.

487
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,800
I have said all that needs to be said.

488
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:38,470
If you're willing to choose the wrong guy,

489
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,480
you're willing to be hurt by him,

490
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,030
that's your problem.

491
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:40,980
It's none of my business.

492
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,260
Listen to yourself.

493
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:42,830
You hurt others' feelings all the time.

494
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,530
I can't believe you aim to be Lin Qiaozhi.

495
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:46,060
You mark my word. You will never be Lin Qiaozhi.

496
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,570
Mom, have some food.

497
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,210
I don't want to eat anything.

498
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:07,350
I feel very dizzy.

499
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:08,780
At least eat a little something.

500
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:21,160
I bought the food

501
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,430
suitable for high blood pressure patients.

502
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:23,970
Low fat, no salt.

503
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:25,620
Your food should

504
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:27,140
be as light as possible.

505
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,380
How does it taste?

506
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:38,250
Insipid.

507
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:40,340
Mom.

508
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:43,420
Is it worth it?

509
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:45,220
Tell me,

510
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:47,790
is there anything else wrong with your dad

511
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:50,500
other than him wanting a boy?

512
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:51,850
No.

513
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,900
He doesn't smoke, he doesn't drink.

514
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:55,180
He doesn't gamble.

515
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,620
He works hard to provide for the family.

516
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,210
He's a filial son.

517
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,250
Not just his mother,

518
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:04,099
when my parents were alive,

519
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:06,400
he took good care of them.

520
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:08,660
Everybody envies me

521
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,900
for having a good husband.

522
00:17:11,609 --> 00:17:13,859
He wanted a son

523
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:16,839
because his family gave him the pressure.

524
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:20,910
He also wanted you to get a job earlier,

525
00:17:21,619 --> 00:17:24,069
and he followed your will.

526
00:17:25,329 --> 00:17:28,359
He never treated his family wrong.

527
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:31,620
This is his only wish.

528
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:33,620
That was never fulfilled.

529
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:35,510
As his wife,

530
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:37,370
a woman he loves for life,

531
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,100
I'm willing to fulfill

532
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:41,740
his wish.

533
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:43,620
But your health…

534
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:44,980
I have you, don't I?

535
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,620
You are a good doctor.

536
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,210
You'll keep me safe,

537
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:51,100
right?

538
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:56,440
I'll do everything I can to keep you safe.

539
00:17:57,130 --> 00:17:57,650
Du Di,

540
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:00,280
you will be a good doctor

541
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:02,190
like Lin Qiaozhi.

542
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:04,900
Lin Qiaozhi…

543
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:08,450
She's probably the only woman

544
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,920
that grandmother respects.

545
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:10,900
Your grandmother

546
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:13,250
went to the countryside to see your grandfather

547
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:16,160
with a baby in her belly.

548
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:19,190
When she changed the train in Beijing,

549
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:20,600
she had nausea.

550
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:21,730
Lucky,

551
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,180
she ran into Dr. Lin Qiaozhi,

552
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:27,720
so the baby was saved.

553
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:29,860
Dr. Lin Qiaozhi

554
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:31,800
also didn't charge your grandmother

555
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:34,120
because she was skint.

556
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,480
If it weren't for Dr. Lin,

557
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:40,990
your grandmother's only son

558
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:42,930
wouldn't have been born.

559
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:46,130
Our family is indebted to her.

560
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:47,700
Mom,

561
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:50,610
tell me,

562
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,480
would Grandmother respect me

563
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,980
and recognize my worth

564
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,380
after I become a doctor

565
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:59,460
like Lin Qiaozhi?

566
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,160
You're the dearest

567
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:04,660
in my heart.

568
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:06,930
You're my priceless

569
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:09,380
baby girl.

570
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,200
And when I have a little brother?

571
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:12,690
Still you.

572
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:14,840
Your little brother

573
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,120
is a task of mine.

574
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:18,680
You, however,

575
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,690
are a gift from God.

576
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:36,600
Don't mind what your grandmother says,

577
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,990
don't feel pressured.

578
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,500
You'll get married,

579
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:44,170
you'll have a child of your own.

580
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:48,100
You will have a different family.

581
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:50,940
Don't be afraid to be a mother

582
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,020
on our account.

583
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:06,820
Dear colleagues of the O.B. department,

584
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,870
today,

585
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:10,690
Professor Lu,

586
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:11,870
a marvelous senior expert

587
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:12,860
of the O.B. department

588
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:14,810
will lead us to join

589
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:15,860
the national O.B. skill competition

590
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:18,140
in his 70s.

591
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,710
It is a competition

592
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:22,210
for the young generations

593
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:23,010
to shine on stage.

594
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:24,600
So you must win the first place.

595
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,490
2nd is unacceptable.

596
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:27,340
Now, let's welcome

597
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:28,780
Professor Lu to give us a speech.

598
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:36,420
Thank you, Director Tian.

599
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,900
Thank you for your recognition.

600
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:40,060
Ever since I was re-employed after my retirement,

601
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:41,430
I have increasingly enjoyed

602
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:42,620
spending time with young people.

603
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:43,850
I enjoy their

604
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:45,300
vitality and daring spirit.

605
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:46,740
As a doctor,

606
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,140
we would become more experienced

607
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:49,340
as we get older.

608
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,000
But meanwhile,

609
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,300
we would be less courageous

610
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,380
to make challenges.

611
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:54,640
As a rule-abiding doctor,

612
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:55,740
we try not to make mistakes.

613
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:56,930
But some patient

614
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,030
may lose

615
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:59,100
a chance to survive.

616
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:00,430
I wish I could

617
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:01,650
maintain a pure heart

618
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:04,220
like the young people.

619
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:05,740
As Director Tian said,

620
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:07,530
this time we must take the first place,

621
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:08,570
not the second.

622
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:09,650
In fact,

623
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:10,930
Shengji

624
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,580
has never taken the second

625
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,160
in such a competition.

626
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:16,560
This time,

627
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,030
our Obstetric and Gynecologic Department sends

628
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:21,050
five standardized residency trainees for the competition.

629
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:23,710
Some are from

630
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,630
Shengji

631
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:27,420
and some are from other hospitals.

632
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:28,080
Some

633
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:29,410
came to our hospital

634
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,130
for M.D.

635
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:31,850
after graduating from

636
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:32,760
other medical schools.

637
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:34,900
This diversified arrangement

638
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,410
is made for a special purpose.

639
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:37,570
On the one hand,

640
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:39,860
this would demonstrate

641
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:41,240
our standardized residency training level.

642
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:42,450
No matter where

643
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,850
the trainees are from,

644
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:45,380
as long as they come to Shengji,

645
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:46,490
their professional levels

646
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,310
would be improved greatly.

647
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:49,460
On the other hand,

648
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:51,020
they have different backgrounds

649
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,670
and can learn from each other.

650
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:53,860
As for me,

651
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:54,860
I'll be responsible for

652
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,070
their basic daily necessities of life

653
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:59,240
and take care of our young colleagues.

654
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:02,850
I promise

655
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:04,490
I will resolutely complete

656
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,760
the task assigned to me.

657
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:06,700
Thank you.

658
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,330
Let's thank Prof. Lu again.

659
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:16,400
We also look forward to your return in triumph.

660
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,150
OK, that's it.

661
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:22,700
The meeting is over.

662
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:33,850
I'm bringing you

663
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:34,680
some chocolates and candies.

664
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,060
If you feel nervous,

665
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:37,070
having something sweet

666
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,060
will help you ease your nerves.

667
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:40,020
Have you seen Director Huang?

668
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:41,620
No.

669
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:42,980
She's not here today.

670
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:44,340
It's weird.

671
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:45,770
She has instructed me for so long.

672
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:46,930
Why doesn't she show up

673
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:47,960
to see me off?

674
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:49,850
She might be sleeping.

675
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:51,380
She's pregnant after all.

676
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,340
I'm a little worried about her.

677
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:54,910
If you see her today,

678
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,060
you must let me know.

679
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:57,270
OK. Let's go.

680
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,790
I'm not going to a nightclub.

681
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:02,850
Why are you bringing me so much wine?

682
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:04,480
I think when you're slightly drunk,

683
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,320
you are more lovely

684
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:07,500
and may not scold the judges so severely.

685
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:08,320
Am I a fool?

686
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:09,290

Congrui, you're awesome.

877
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,230
Is it me?

878
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:50,870
Head of each delegation,

879
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,140
please take your participants to the main venue.

880
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:57,620
Hello?

881

Is the competition over?

882
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,150

884

I'll be right back.

885
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:08,740
Prof. Lu,

00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:10,990
congratulations!

887
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,220
The younger generation is awesome

888
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:13,230
and worth our learning.

889
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:15,180
I'd like to ask

890
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:16,700
how was Du Di

891
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:17,670
overtaken

892
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,140
by Wu Congrui?

893
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:21,200
This is the case.

894
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:23,230
For this question about

895
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:24,220
severe pre-eclampsia,

896
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,280
the answer can be keeping the fetus.

897
00:31:26,610 --> 00:31:27,110
Of course,

898
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,520
the pregnancy can be terminated,

899
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:30,790
but there is one hidden precondition.

900
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:32,820
It must be an elderly parturient woman

901
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:34,510
in the place where there is no condition

902
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:35,820
for maternal and infant rescue

903
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,610
and intrauterine referral.

904
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:39,880
In this case,

905
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:41,570
the pregnancy must be terminated.

906
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:43,730
Otherwise, both the mother and baby would die.

907
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:44,460
Du Di

908
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:46,260
insisted on terminating pregnancy.

909
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:47,520
She said

910
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:48,060
women

911
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,710
shouldn't risk their lives to give birth.

912
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,240
She seemed a bit sulky.

913
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:55,140
But Wu Congrui performed well.

914
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:57,990
She figured out the precondition,

915
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:00,060
so she won perfectly.

916
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:10,050
Today,

917
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:11,420
Aunt had a convulsion.

918
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:12,610
Fortunately, Director Tian

919
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:13,430
came in time.

920
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:15,090
She's just calmed down.

921
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:16,540
Doesn't the BP-lowering treatment work well?

922
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:17,930
Not so well.

923
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:19,970
She has many underlying diseases

924
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:21,440
and she is physically weak.

925
00:32:22,330 --> 00:32:23,070
Director Tian,

926
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,420
please try to help us

927
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,650
keep the baby.

928
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:28,850
Yes, I assure you that

929
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:30,950
we'll try our best.

930
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:33,700
It's not impossible to keep the baby.

931
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:36,090
But if she has it again,

932
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:37,750
she has to be sent to the ICU.

933
00:32:37,970 --> 00:32:38,340
OK.

934
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:39,570
Anywhere is OK

935
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:41,070
as long as the baby is kept.

936
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:41,820
What are you saying?

937
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:45,340
You only care about the baby.

938
00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:46,180
The baby's life is important,

939
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:47,130
but isn't my mother's important?

940
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:49,340
Entering the ICU for keeping the baby,

941
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:50,280
my mother would be no different

942
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,000
from a container.

943
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:52,540
I really don't want my mother

944
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:53,830
to suffer from various diseases

945
00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:54,650
just for giving birth to the baby.

946
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,960
That would affect her future daily life.

947
00:32:55,990 --> 00:32:56,720
It would be really hard for her.

948
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:57,300
I beg you.

949
00:32:57,330 --> 00:32:58,210
How can you talk that way?

950
00:32:58,510 --> 00:32:59,740
Take it easy. Don't get angry.

951
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:00,980
Aunt has just fallen asleep.

952
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,080
I'm not disregarding her life.

953
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:05,410
I love your mother only.

954
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:07,260
I want to have a baby with her only.

955
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:08,820
As for money,

956
00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:11,080
I could sell the house.

957
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:12,340
You don't need to worry about

958
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:13,620
how we will raise him.

959
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:16,020
I have a house site.

960
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,280
It's worth some money.

961
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:19,380
I would go back and sell it.

962
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:21,670
Du Di,

963
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:23,860
there're indeed the difficulties you mentioned.

964
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:25,030
But as doctors,

965
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:25,740
while respecting

966
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:27,060
medical science,

967
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:28,820
we must also respect

968
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:29,820
opinions of the patient and her families.

969
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:31,630
You're both families.

970
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:33,700
So, you need to discuss it

971
00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:34,710
and tell me your decision.

972
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:35,880
No matter what, I'll do my best.

973
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:37,780
Thank you, Director Tian.

974
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:40,410
Let them calm down first

975
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:41,260
and then talk about it.

976
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:45,260
Du Di,

977
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:47,260
what about the competition?

978
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:51,860
Shengji took the first place.

979
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:53,660
What about you?

980
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:01,220
Second.

981
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,469
Only the second.

982
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:10,480
What makes you so cocky?

983
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:16,650
You may go back first.

984
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,110
I want to stay alone for a while.

985
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:20,020
It's one o'clock.

986
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:22,270
It's not safe for you to go back alone.

987
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,179
Sorry.

988
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:51,860
I've been so busy

989
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:52,960
and didn't keep you company.

990
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:55,790
You're undergoing such a big thing,

991
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:57,710
but I didn't stay by your side.

992
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,080
I don't know

993
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:08,940
if my mother is carrying a boy.

994
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:10,510
I lied to them.

995
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:13,100
At the beginning,

996
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,100
my father kept asking Congrui

997
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,660
about the baby's sex.

998
00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:18,340
Congrui didn't tell him.

999
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:20,390
Then he came to me

1000
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:21,260
and pestered me for that.

1001
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,110
I didn't know what to do,

1002
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:25,760
so I lied to him.

1003
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:27,580
I thought

1004
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:28,810
they would

1005
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,710
be nicer to my mother.

1006
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:31,990
But I couldn't believe

1007
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:35,010
that they don't care about

1008
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:35,960
my mother's condition at all

1009
00:35:37,450 --> 00:35:38,490
and insist on keeping the baby.

1010
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:40,170
What would you do if you were me?

1011
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:42,850
If I don't know what to do,

1012
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,090
I would choose to tell the truth.

1013
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:58,960
For Shengji, it's not the first time

1014
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:06,630
to win the national first place.

1015
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,410
But it's the first time

1016
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:09,160
to win the top three.

1017
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:10,840
Let's congratulate them.

1018
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:12,780
The first is

1019
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:14,130
Wu Congrui.

1020
00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:15,420
The second is

1021
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:21,420
Du Di.

1022
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:22,330
The third is Feng Bingbing.

1023
00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:30,500
The department decides

1024
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,200
to reward the participants

1025
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:36,460
three thousand yuan each,

1026
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:37,900
and Wu Congrui

1027
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:38,820
five thousand yuan.

1028
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:39,740
The honors and awards from the hospital

1029
00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:41,780
will be granted next week.

1030
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:42,800
Congratulations!

1031
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:43,650
Come on.

1032
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:44,350
Let's congratulate Wu Congrui

1033
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,920
for winning the first place.

1034
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:56,820
No, the national first place.

1035
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,850
Come on, cheers.

1036
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,010
Come on.

1037
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:00,400
Yeah.

1038
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:01,440
Thank you.

1039
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:02,100
Congratulations.

1040
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,260
Congratulations.

1041
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,060
Congratulations.

1042
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:05,100
Thank you.

1043
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:08,560
Come on. Try these.

1044
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:11,490
Today, I would like to

1045
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,540
thank all instructors for your patience.

1046
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,160
Without your help,

1047
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:16,780
I wouldn't be there in the competition.

1048
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:18,380
This competition

1049
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:19,520
was really hard.

1050
00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:21,600
All hospitals sent their best participants.

1051
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,100
Our group total score

1052
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:25,010
was only two points more than the second.

1053
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:26,230
The questions were difficult too.

1054
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:27,640
In the simulated surgical link,

1055
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:29,110
the first session was dystocia.

1056
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:31,240
Luckily, Su Ye reminded me

1057
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,290
that there would be dystocia for sure.

1058
00:37:32,330 --> 00:37:33,700
So, I practiced hard in advance.

1059
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:34,960
Suture

1060
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:37,090
started from perineal laceration.

1061
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:37,950
My God.

1062
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:39,280
I was sweating through the whole process.

1063
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:40,370
You know what?

1064
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,880
In all sessions before interrogation,

1065
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:43,530
I was behind Du Di.

1066
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:45,260
In the last session,

1067
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,120
I turned the table.

1068
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:46,820
By the way.

1069
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:48,050
Where is Du Di?

1070
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,270
Didn't you call her here?

1071
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:50,580
I texted her,

1072
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:51,360
but she didn't text me back.

1073
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:53,620
She must feel uncomfortable for not taking the first place.

1074
00:37:53,850 --> 00:37:54,650
Let's not force her here.

1075
00:37:55,770 --> 00:37:56,940
If so, she is so narrow-minded.

1076
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:58,570
No one could always

1077
00:37:58,570 --> 00:37:59,140
be the first.

1078
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:00,070
It's not a big deal

1079
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:00,980
to let someone else win occasionally.

1080
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:02,220
It's different this time.

1081
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:03,900
Du Di

1082
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:04,680
is determined

1083
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:05,640
to become the next chief resident.

1084
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:06,500
How could she be willing

1085
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:07,910
to see Congrui win the first place?

1086
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:09,540
Don't guess blindly.

1087
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:12,070
Du Di isn't here

1088
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:13,370
because her mother

1089
00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:14,300
was in a serious condition last night.

1090
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:15,610
She's in a bad mood.

1091
00:38:15,730 --> 00:38:16,630
Coming here

1092
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:17,630
while worrying about

1093
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:18,580
her mother

1094
00:38:18,610 --> 00:38:19,730
would ruin the dinner.

1095
00:38:20,410 --> 00:38:21,380
How is her mother doing?

1096
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:22,900
They're at a key point

1097
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:23,620
in making the decision.

1098
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:30,980
It's a rare opportunity

1099
00:38:31,010 --> 00:38:32,610
to get together to celebrate your winning.

1100
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,200
Don't be absent-minded.

1101
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:35,430
Maybe…

1102
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:36,660
How is Aunt doing?

1103
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:42,270
[Du Di]

1104
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:43,220
It's mine.

1105
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:45,740
Hello?

1106
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,480
Don't… Don't worry.

1107
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:49,300
I'll be right there.

1108
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:07,030
How long have they been gone?

1109
00:39:07,890 --> 00:39:09,080
About three to four minutes.

1110
00:39:09,350 --> 00:39:10,160
It's a bit congested.

1111
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,560
I don't think they've gone far.

1112
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:12,920
Could your mother be discharged in her condition?

1113
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,940
She became stabilized this morning.

1114
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:16,340
That's good.

1115
00:39:16,370 --> 00:39:17,450
But why do they leave?

1116
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:19,130
Director Tian asked us to sign

1117
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,080
an informed consent form

1118
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:21,770
for a possible emergency surgery

1119
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:23,290
to avoid delaying emergency rescue.

1120
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:24,900
My father refused to sign it.

1121
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:26,670
He's worried that

1122
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:27,620
I would sign it behind him.

1123
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:28,630
So, he packed

1124
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:29,420
and took my mother out of the hospital.

1125
00:39:29,850 --> 00:39:31,020
I told the nurse

1126
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:31,920
to keep an eye on them,

1127
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:33,120
but she couldn't stop them

1128
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,200
and called me immediately.

1129
00:39:35,930 --> 00:39:37,240
Aunt's blood pressure has just stabilized.

1130
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:37,990
This is not good for her.

1131
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,600
Where are we going?

1132
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:47,570
We go to another hospital,

1133
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:48,860
and won't stay in Shengji any longer.

1134
00:39:49,270 --> 00:39:50,040
I don't want to change.

1135
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:51,360
I want to go back.

1136
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:52,740
I want to go back to Shengji.

1137
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:54,340
I want to go back to Du Di.

1138
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:55,640
I want Du Di to take care of me

1139
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:56,720
so that I could feel rest assured.

1140
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:58,010
What's the use of her?

1141
00:39:58,660 --> 00:39:59,400
What she wants

1142
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,850
is to induce labor for you.

1143
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:01,960
We go to another hospital.

1144
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:02,830
Then Mother and I

1145
00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:04,190
don't have to be subservient in front of her

1146
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:05,430
and could live a few years longer.

1147
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:07,640
I think it's that one,

1148
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:08,960
with a green license, a ride hailing car.

1149
00:40:20,370 --> 00:40:22,160
I think there is a car

1150
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:23,700
following us.

1151
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:29,650
It's Dr. Liu's car.

1152
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:32,220
He sent me to the hotel yesterday.

1153
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:34,310
It's Du Di.

1154
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:35,400
Du Di is coming.

1155
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:36,790
Sir, can you drive faster?

1156
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:37,710
Faster?

1157
00:40:37,870 --> 00:40:38,760
It's congested with traffic.

1158
00:40:38,930 --> 00:40:39,890
How can I drive faster?

1159
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,400
If something happens,

1160
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:42,770
I will get the points deducted and fined.

1161
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:44,300
How would I do my business?

1162
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,840
Okay. You just drive as fast as you can.

1163
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:52,300
Can you drive faster?

1164
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:57,020
Sir,

1165
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,270
can you drive faster? Faster.

1166
00:40:58,540 --> 00:40:59,060
Sir,

1167
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:00,890
if you have any family conflicts,

1168
00:41:00,910 --> 00:41:01,870
you'd better get off to solve it.

1169
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:03,620
Don't push me to drive faster.

1170
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:04,180
Then,

1171
00:41:04,370 --> 00:41:05,020
you just pull over.

1172
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:05,650
We'll get off.

1173
00:41:05,850 --> 00:41:06,850
We're in the middle the of road.

1174
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:07,580
How can I pull over?

1175
00:41:07,810 --> 00:41:08,140
I…

1176
00:41:09,130 --> 00:41:10,120
I will give you a negative comment.

1177
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:10,620
Sir,

1178
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,150
now all trips

1179
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:13,320
are videotaped and recorded.

1180
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:15,100
It's no use to give me a negative comment.

1181
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:16,130
No matter what,

1182
00:41:16,290 --> 00:41:17,390
I won't break the traffic rules.

1183
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:18,740
Okay, okay.

1184
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:20,250
You pull over

1185
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,540
where you can.

1186
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:28,900
Father.

1187
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:29,700
Father.

1188
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:30,780
Mom.

1189
00:41:30,910 --> 00:41:31,820
Pull over.

1190
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:33,460
You can't take my mom away like this.

1191
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,270
You must take her back to the hospital.

1192
00:41:34,410 --> 00:41:35,140
Without an ambulance,

1193
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:36,170
it's dangerous to transfer her to another hospital.

1194
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:36,870
Father.

1195
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:37,790
It's none of your business.

1196
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:39,970
I'm her family. I'll take the liability.

1197
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,050
Mom. Mom.

1198
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:41,700
Pull over.

1199
00:41:41,730 --> 00:41:42,230
Mom.

1200
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:44,140
Are you transferring a patient illegally?

1201
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:45,480
Nonsense.

1202
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:46,390
I'm the family.

1203
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:47,300
Father. Pull over.

1204
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:48,790
How is it illegal

1205
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:49,720
to ask my wife to be discharged?

1206
00:41:49,950 --> 00:41:51,430
You'd better get off.

1207
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:53,290
My car is not an ambulance.

1208
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:54,460
If something happened,

1209
00:41:54,570 --> 00:41:55,600
I can't afford it.

1210
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:56,510
Father.

1211
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:57,710
Okay, okay. You just pull over.

1212
00:41:58,060 --> 00:41:58,580
Pull over.

1213
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:07,620
Mother, be careful.

1214
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:08,030
Give me that.

1215
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:08,610
You take care of her.

1216
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:12,450
Stop the car.

1217
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:13,260
Pull over. Pull over.

1218
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:14,650
No. It's too dangerous.

1219
00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:17,250
Go back to Shengji.

1220
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:18,880
I want to go back to Shengji.

1221
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:19,940
We'll be right there.

1222
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:21,950
Let's cross the street

1223
00:42:21,970 --> 00:42:22,690
and take another cab.

1224
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:24,310
I want to go back to Shengji.

1225
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:25,780
Don't run. Come back.

1226
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:26,530
Don't run.

1227
00:42:27,450 --> 00:42:28,300
Stop the car.

1228
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:31,570
Stop.

1229
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:32,260
Mom.

1230
00:42:32,690 --> 00:42:33,610
Mom, stop.

1231
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:34,860
Mom, stop there.

1232
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:36,160
My daughter.

1233
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:37,340
My daughter.

1234
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:38,140
Come back.

1235
00:42:38,970 --> 00:42:39,780
Come back.

1236
00:42:40,010 --> 00:42:40,500
Mom.

1237
00:42:41,410 --> 00:42:42,360
Mom, don't run.

1238
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:43,640
Stop there. Stop there.

1239
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:44,290
My daughter.

1240
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:46,620
Du Di.

1241
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:49,340
Mom.

1242
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:53,740
No.

1243
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:03,410
Mom!
