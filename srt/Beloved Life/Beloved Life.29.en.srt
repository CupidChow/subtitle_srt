[Episode 29]

4
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:40,740
What are you doing, Head Nurse?

5
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:42,289
Don't worry. It's not a red envelope.

6
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:44,560
My niece runs a restaurant.

7
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:46,190
She wanted to give red envelopes,

8
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:47,180
but I told her it's forbidden.

9
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:48,630
So, they give you

10
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:49,870
these restaurant coupons.

11
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:50,900
I permit you

12
00:01:51,259 --> 00:01:51,750
to take these

13
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:52,460
and take everyone there for dinner.

14
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,700
No, we can't take it.

15
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,340
You just take it as a gift from me.

16
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:56,670
It's not a red envelop. Just take it.

17
00:01:57,289 --> 00:01:59,060
Fine. As you command.

18
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:00,060
I want candies, too.

19
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:01,370
Yeah.

20
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,390
The largest packet is for you.

21
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,580
Get lucky by sharing your happiness.

22
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:05,770
Ten boxes of sour & spicy rice noodles

23
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:06,580
will be delivered to your house.

24
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:07,940
Thank you, Head Nurse.

25
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:10,160
I don't think you eat candies.

26
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,200
Hey!

27
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:13,670
He just took it and ran.

28
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:14,850
Needless to say,

29
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,950
he's surely taking that

30
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,210
to Du Di.

31
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:18,700
Speaking of the two of them,

32
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:20,110
one is like an angle

33
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,160
and the other is like a demon.

34
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:22,990
But they're getting along well.

35
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:25,070
Head Nurse,

36
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,420
when will you have a grandson?

37
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:28,780
Well, my son

38
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,130
is not in a hurry to find a girlfriend yet.

39
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:33,110
We don't know

40
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,560
what the young people are thinking about.

41
00:02:35,579 --> 00:02:36,020
Aunt.

42
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:37,700
Where did you go?

43
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:38,900
I just went to pick the meds.

44
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,150
Yingying has a rash

45
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:42,200
and it's getting worse.

46
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:43,460
I just got these for her.

47
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:47,190
She might be allergic due to postpartum weakness.

48
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:48,220
You must pay attention to that.

49
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:49,960
She has taken the meds

50
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,050
and applied the ointment.

51
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:52,260
But there is no sign of getting better.

52
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:53,380
Don't worry.

53
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:54,710
Shengji's Dermatology Department

54
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:55,630
is also good.

55
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:56,590
I especially invite

56
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:57,510
Director Zhao from the Dermatology Department

57
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:58,240
to take a look at her.

58
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,740
I don't think it's a common allergy.

59
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,500
She's been tested for allergens, too.

60
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:03,590
Your niece

61
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,030
doesn't have an allergic constitution.

62
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,580
Even if she's allergic to something unknown,

63
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:07,460
a particular allergen

64
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,900
is unlikely to exist for long

65
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,420
in the hospital environment.

66
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:11,350
Could it be caused by

67
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:12,620
the weakened postpartum immunity after childbirth?

68
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:13,510
Her immune system

69
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:14,480
has surely weakened.

70
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:15,910
And she has surely got infected.

71
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:16,970
But I've never seen

72
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:18,110
such a symptom

73
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,350
caused by the weakened immunity.

74
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:20,500
Besides, she gave birth naturally

75
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:22,150
and has recovered well.

76
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,340
It's weird, really weird.

77
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:25,060
Director,

78
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,090
are there other tests that can help?

79
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,250
We've done all that should be done,

80
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,329
even including a toxicology test.

81
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,650
But we still can't find the cause.

82
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:32,710
Ah? Then…

83
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:34,100
Then what should I do?

84
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,390
I couldn't breastfeed my baby.

85
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,710
It's not good to keep feeding the baby

86
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:38,780
with formula milk powder.

87
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:41,740
What is it on the baby's neck?

88
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,790
Director Zhao, please come over and take a look.

89
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:45,500
There are rashes.

90
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:45,980
Don't touch.

91
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:47,220
How did this happen?

92
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,260
Thank you for coming from afar.

93
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,140
We've prepared

94
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:56,790
a light meal

95
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:57,700
for your lunch.

96
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:59,170
During which, we can discuss

97
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:00,780
the flow of our academic seminar.

98
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:02,360
Afterwards, I'll ask my student

99
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:04,230
to take you to our department...

100
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:04,570
OK.

101
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:05,900
...and show you around.

102
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,540
All professors, this way please.

103
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:08,780
Please.

104
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:09,620
Thank you.

105
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:14,260
How is she doing?

106
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:15,290
What do you expect?

107
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,339
Basically, we can only keep her alive.

108
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,800
Her wounds are healing well,

109
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,140
which means the surgery was successful.

110
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:27,170
The functions of her organs

111
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,380
can also be maintained.

112
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:31,450
But now,

113
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:33,940
there's basically nothing we can do

114
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,659
about the neurological damage.

115
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,370
I'm pessimistic about

116
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:45,350
whether she would wake up.

117
00:04:47,409 --> 00:04:48,700
She would be disappointed again.

118
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,690
I'll tell Du Di about it

119
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,380
when she's out of the delivery room.

120
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:55,340
This time

121
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,159
taking the opportunity of the academic seminar,

122
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,400
I invited all the famous specialists here

123
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:01,000
to check on her.

124
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:02,560
If there is a miracle

125
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:03,320
in the world

126
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:05,730
and not speaking as a specialist,

127
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,020
we could only

128
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:08,530
expect a miracle to happen.

129
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,020
Thank you.

130
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:14,380
What did you say?

131
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:15,920
Never mind.

132
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:20,450
You thanked me

133
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,140
because of Du Di.

134
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:24,600
This girl seems to be

135
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:26,230
very powerful.

136
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:31,000
Did you ask for her to work with you?

137
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,180
Are you expecting me to be grateful to you?

138
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,050
I've never expected that.

139
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,720
I just appreciate her ability.

140
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,710
She doesn't like it this way.

141
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:45,810
Don't let her feel burdened.

142
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,260
You are young

143
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:50,420
with hot blood and sincerity.

144
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:51,980
But

145
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:53,340
for that point of her,

146
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,830
I appreciate her even more.

147
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,260
Anyway, as you go out into the world,

148
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,320
you would understand

149
00:05:58,650 --> 00:05:59,760
how important it is

150
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:00,680
to have the support of a senior.

151
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:02,570
Life is like

152
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:04,210
an endless river.

153
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:05,940
Now that there's a boat,

154
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:08,070
why do you have to swim?

155
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,410
She has been swimming all the time

156
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:10,780
and has become used to it.

157
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:12,680
The boat is not the world she wants.

158
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:13,460
That's how I swam

159
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,500
to this point.

160
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,470
Just because

161
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,340
I swam all my life,

162
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:19,860
I don't want her to work so hard as your mother...

163
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:24,070
As I did

164
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:24,740
when I was young.

165
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:26,900
Have you

166
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,460
made up your mind to swim with her?

167
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,620
Since you've made up your mind,

168
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:35,880
you must be responsible for her

169
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:37,870
and take the responsibility as a man

170
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:40,430
to take care of her and her family.

171
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,990
It's ridiculous

172
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,659
to hear the term "responsibility"

173
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:44,940
from you.

174
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,470
I have no energy to argue with you.

175
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:52,900
About random allergies,

176
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,650
the causes could be

177
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:55,530
detergents

178
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:57,050
and jewelries.

179
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,640
Don't just focus on the patient herself.

180
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,760
You may check what she's exposed to.

181
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:02,200
How did you know it?

182
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:05,100
Wang Ying?

183
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,190
Head Nurse works for you, too?

184
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:07,820
This…

185
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:09,390
Why are there

186
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:10,180
so many informers?

187
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:13,660
Give me that?

188
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,020
Dr. Liu,

189
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:35,550
could it be caused by the detergent?

190
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:36,970
It's imported, very expensive.

191
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:37,880
We bought it

192
00:07:37,909 --> 00:07:38,710
because they say it's good for infants.

193
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:40,420
Well, let me get these tested first.

194
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,140
Do you wear any jewelries?

195
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:45,440
Not recently.

196
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,020
Some friends

197
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:49,360
came to see the baby

198
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:51,230
and sent some jade and gold ones.

199
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:52,190
Let me see.

200
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:55,370
Here.

201
00:07:55,409 --> 00:07:56,490
Honey, there're some more inside the drawer.

202
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:00,740
What is this?

203
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:04,020
My close friend gave me that.

204
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,390
She said it's called mother-infant energy stone

205
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,960
and can increase

206
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:09,020
the energy and bond

207
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,230
between the mother and infant.

208
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:11,420
Is it so magical?

209
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:16,540
Nurse,

210
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:19,020
I gave you the list yesterday.

211
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:19,620
This one.

212
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:20,340
Is it this one?

213
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,100
Yeah, it is.

214
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:24,460
Why hasn't Bai come back yet?

215
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:25,870
I'm worried.

216
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:26,580
Aunt,

217
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:27,910
why do you

218
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:28,770
keep burping today?

219
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,000
I'm nervous.

220
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:33,740
This…

221
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,260
What are they doing?

222
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,559
What's going on?

223
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:37,380
I don't know.

224
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,419
Sorry.

225
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:39,419
You can't leave now.

226
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:40,870
What's going on?

227
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:41,780
Who are you looking for?

228
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:42,830
The stuff

229
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:43,780
taken out from your ward

230
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:45,060
were detected with radiation.

231
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,390
Now everyone involved

232
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:47,880
must be quarantined and tested.

233
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,340
Please get the patients ready

234
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:50,900
for tests.

235
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:51,340
OK.

236
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,610
You can't leave for now.

237
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:55,710
[Isolation Ward]

238
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,040
Du Di, Du Di.

239
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,300
Nianbai is in isolation.

240
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:17,860
Why?

241
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:18,670
Nuclear radiation.

242
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:20,330
Are you kidding?

243
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:21,300
How can there be nuclear radiation?

244
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:22,660
There is a patient

245
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,000
who has been having skin infections.

246
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:25,570
Nianbai sent the patient's

247
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:26,540
clothes and jewelries

248
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:27,590
for testing.

249
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:28,630
While going through

250
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:29,350
the radiation testing point,

251
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:30,470
the alarm went off.

252
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:31,670
It's not yet clear about

253
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:32,950
the level of exposure of the close contacts

254
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:33,990
to the radiation.

255
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:34,940
So, they're all in quarantine now.

256
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:04,060
Why are you coming so late?

257
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:05,510
I came during the day.

258
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:06,960
It's too crowded and I couldn't make it through.

259
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,460
There were indeed many people.

260
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:10,190
I've finally known the feeling

261
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:11,390
of a monkey

262
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:12,300
being locked in a cage.

263
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:14,840
There hasn't been a case of radiation

264
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:15,840
for many years in the hospital.

265
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:17,310
Relevant and irrelevant

266
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,820
doctors and leaders all came.

267
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,220
They seemed to be so eager to find

268
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,530
a periodic table of elements on me.

269
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:23,820
How can you still wear a smile?

270
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:27,090
Have they found out what element it is?

271
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:28,990
Yes.

272
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:30,450
It won't penetrate

273
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:31,380
this leaded glass.

274
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,500
I'm sorry.

275
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:40,200
You're not the radiation.

276
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:41,260
Why do you say sorry?

277
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:46,170
I…

278
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:50,210
Just say whatever you want to say.

279
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:52,260
Don't worry. I'm strong-hearted.

280
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:56,820
It seems that

281
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,970
I've never been nice to you

282
00:10:58,010 --> 00:10:58,850
as a girlfriend.

283
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,060
I actually also want to ask you about it.

284
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:08,520
We seem to

285
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,190
have been getting closer.

286
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:12,310
But you've never admitted

287
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,420
that you're my girlfriend.

288
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,460
In the beginning,

289
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:18,700
I didn't think you were serious.

290
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:20,740
If love

291
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:22,290
is a road,

292
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:23,330
then I would feel

293
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:26,120
there're many obstacles in front of me.

294
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:29,680
You're a talent who could

295
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:31,320
go back to a foreign lab at any time.

296
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,200
You're the vice president's son,

297
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,940
and an intern younger than me.

298
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:37,490
Moreover,

299
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:41,170
you're not even

300
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:42,380
my type,

301
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:44,740
not strong

302
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:46,800
and not professionally competent.

303
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:50,180
So, I have so many problems.

304
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,470
Probably because there're too many shadows

305
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,300
from the past.

306
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:59,180
♫There're glimmers of light in your eyes♫

307
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,940
I always felt that there're many obstacles ahead

308
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,530
and I would get tripped at every step.

309

♫You can't wait to wake up from your deep sleep♫

310

After being tripped many times,

311
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:04,540
I felt a little tired.

312
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:10,040
Are you here to break up with me?

313

♫This is where the story begins♫

this time,

318
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:17,350
I wouldn't know

319
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:18,580
how worried I am about you

320
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,190

When you are out of there,

328
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:33,630
I would tell everyone

Is it too rare?

340

Do you want to change it?

341

No.

342
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,440
I'm a little worried about Nianbai.

343

I'm also worried about Du Di.

344
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:32,820
Yeah.

345
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,340
Head Nurse doesn't trust me

346
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,120
and asked Director Tian

347
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:38,020
not to let me be beside.

348
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:39,820
Otherwise, I would be the one quarantined.

349
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:40,690
Why doesn't Head Nurse

350
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,520
trust you?

351
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,970
She always secretly asked for your help

352
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,370
when there's an important patient.

353
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:46,460
No matter what,

354
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:47,300
you're a director too.

355
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:48,980
Who knows.

356
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:51,460
Forget about that. Let's eat.

357
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:00,580
It's from Uncle Du.

358
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,200
What does he text you for?

359
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:03,220
Let me ask.

360
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:16,570
I got to go back to the hospital.

361
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:19,060
Isn't it Dr. Lin's shift?

362
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,130
Nianbai has been reporting him

363
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,010
about Aunt's condition,

364
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:24,390
but not in the last couple of days.

365
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:25,630
Uncle couldn't reach him,

366
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,310
so he contacts me.

367
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:29,440
I got to go back to the hospital

368
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:31,620
and reassure him.

369
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:35,180
Du Di, Du Di.

370
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:37,070
We're having a date,

371
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:38,450
but you've been talking about her.

372
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:39,830
Everyone in the world

373
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:40,850
cares about her.

374
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,410
She's really attractive.

375
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,230
When it rains,

376
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,570
it pours.

377
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:48,540
Thank you for the dinner.

378
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:50,850
But next time, let's not come to

379
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,780
such an expensive restaurant.

380
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:53,780
Here,

381
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:54,930
it's too expensive

382
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:56,610
and we can't talk loudly.

383
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:57,200
I feel restrained.

384
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:02,570
How can I invite you to dinner

385
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:03,980
so casually?

386
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:07,550
You're so good to me.

387
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,340
I'm leaving then.

388
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:11,140
Wait a second.

389
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:12,760
I'll call the waiter to pay the bill

390
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:13,560
and I'll go with you.

391
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:14,660
Don't hurry.

392
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:17,350
You can't spend the money for nothing.

393
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,730
You just take your time

394
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,380
and enjoy the environment here.

395
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:21,750
I'll let him rest assured

396
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:22,460
and go back home directly.

397
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:25,460
Okay then.

398
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:28,910
Congrui.

399
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:07,630
We're finally out.

400
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:09,020
Waiting for news in the isolation ward

401
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,140
is too scary.

402
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:18,760
You're finally out. It's good that you're all fine.

403
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:20,890
Fortunately, the radiation was weak,

404
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,000
and only long-term direct exposure to it

405
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:22,880
would be a problem.

406
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,330
Otherwise, we wouldn't come out.

407
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:25,970
Young people.

408
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,960
Let's not look at them, or we would have a stye.

409
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:28,710
Let's go back.

410
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,070
We must take a selfie to remember this.

411
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:41,320
Why do you look like that?

412
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,600
I don't know how to take a selfie.

413
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,500
If I post this,

414
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:46,260
others would think

415
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:47,130
we're enemies.

416
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:48,940
Let's take one with a smile.

417
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,810
A few more.

418
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:55,700
Fine.

419
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:57,090
I like you even with a straight face.

420
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:58,260
I'll post this.

421
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,380
Don't. I look ugly.

422
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:01,740
Not at all.

423
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:09,579
Didn't you

424
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:10,210
block your father?

425
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,480
Who told you that I blocked him?

426
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:15,560
It seems your relationship has been eased.

427
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:17,020
There's no such thing.

428
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:19,690
By the way,

429
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:21,119
why doesn't Wei come to see me?

430
00:17:21,859 --> 00:17:22,619
Where is he?

431
00:17:23,369 --> 00:17:25,190
He's been in a bad mood lately.

432
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:26,900
There's a patient with cervical cancer

433
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:27,839
who refuses to accept treatment

434
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:29,890
and insists on risking her life to keep the baby.

435
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:32,020
Dr. Lin used to be very calm.

436
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:33,780
But lately,

437
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,190
he has been particularly emotional.

438
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:36,180
At the mention of that patient,

439
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:37,180
he would flow into a rage.

440
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:40,130
It's the second time facing such a case,

441
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:41,860
he certainly couldn't calm down.

442
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:42,900
Second time?

443
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:45,300
That's

444
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:46,210
how his wife died.

445
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,430
I didn't know that.

446
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:51,990
It's the shadow

447
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:53,490
he could never forget.

448
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:07,970
-You're back.
-What time is it?

449
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:08,860
Tell me what time is it.

450
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:12,990
Five past twelve.

451
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:13,960
No.

452
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,590
I ran all the way

453
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:16,860
to get home before twelve o'clock.

454
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:17,670
But I'm still late.

455
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:19,960
It's okay.

456
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:21,210
Being five minutes late,

457
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:22,350
it's still the anniversary.

458
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:23,460
Besides,

459
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,490
today

460
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,070
we'll celebrate a new beginning.

461
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,870
Our Dr. Lin

462
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:30,080
perfectly performed

463
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:31,240
his first surgery in life.

464
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,780
It's the cake for our third anniversary.

465
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,410
How can I blow the candles alone?

466
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,360
Our anniversary has passed.

467
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,890
This is for you.

468
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:49,980
Honey,

469
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:51,250
I'm so sorry.

470
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:52,480
After we got married,

471
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,580
I was busy with the standardized residency training.

472
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,840
After that, I've been trying to become an attending physician.

473
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:57,340
After the clinical work is over,

474
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,850
I have to work with the director in the lab.

475
00:18:58,930 --> 00:18:59,950
I haven't taken a day off.

476
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,330
And I'm late

477
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:03,700
for our anniversary.

478
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:05,570
Being with me,

479
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,000
you must have a lot of grievances.

480
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:09,790
From the day I decided to

481
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:11,710
marry a talented doctor,

482
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:12,460
I've known

483
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:13,690
this is my life.

484
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:15,540
I don't have any grievances.

485
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:16,820
You have my back.

486
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:19,170
Besides, you've saved

487
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:20,340
so many babies and women.

488
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:21,660
That means

489
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:23,090
I saved their lives indirectly.

490
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:24,870
I'm happy with that.

491
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:26,670
I must have done a lot of good things

492
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:27,900
in my previous life.

493
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:29,550
Otherwise, I wouldn't be able

494
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:30,860
to marry such a perfect wife.

495
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:32,860
I promise

496
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:34,570
when I become a director,

497
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:35,940
I would take a long vacation

498
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:36,750
and take you on a tour.

499
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,200
You want to have a travel in Nepal

500
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:38,800
and see the snow-capped mountains

501
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:39,920
in Pokhara, right?

502
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:41,650
Then we can rent a boat

503
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:42,950
and lie on it every day

504
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:43,930
to enjoy the landscape of Annapurna Mountain.

505
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:44,770
OK.

506
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:49,900
To become a director,

507
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,720
you have to perform

508
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,480
8,000 operations, right?

509
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:54,620
Then I can perform

510
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,570
seven to eight cesareans per day.

511
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:57,920
So, it would take only a few years.

[Latest Results in Treatment]

514
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:07,260
Let's invite Director Liu from

515
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:08,430
the Obstetric and Gynecologic Department of Mingxin Hospital

516
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,100
to introduce the latest results

517
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,250
in the treatment of

518
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,420
cervical cancer in pregnancy.

519
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:18,820
Director Liu is very famous,

520
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,210
particularly good at

521
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:20,720
the treatment of gynecological tumors.

522
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:21,940
Yeah?

523
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:23,420
Is she better than Director Zhang?

524
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:25,540
She's Director Zhang's main competitor

525
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:26,410
for the title of academician.

526
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:27,910
How do you know all these?

527
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:29,470
I'm a fool compared with you.

528
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,120
You're a surgical fool.

529
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:34,920
Between fetus protection

530
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:36,330
and hysterectomy,

531
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:37,460
a gynecological oncologist

532
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:38,850
has to make

533
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:40,490
many different choices

534
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:41,640
and decisions.

535
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:43,730
It's really important

536
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:44,390
to choose the timing,

537
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:46,120
the option and the meds to be used.

538
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,180
Let me

539
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:48,810
share with you

540
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:49,780
the case of a young patient.

541
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:50,960
This case

542
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,940
almost involves all factors.

543
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,010
The patient is 27 years old.

544
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:56,270
She didn't get pregnant

545
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:57,330
after three years of marriage.

546
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:00,340
The examination showed multiple ovarian cysts.

547
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:01,870
Last year,

548
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,740
she received ovarian cystectomy

549
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:04,670
and actively prepared for pregnancy.

550
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:07,380
She's now 16 weeks + 2 days pregnant

551
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:10,020
and had bleeding.

552
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,740
The patient took it as unstable pregnancy

553
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,470
or a threatened miscarriage.

554
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:15,370
Therefore,

555
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:17,560
she did a lot to prevent miscarriage.

556
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:21,470
Last month,

557
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,300
the irregular vaginal bleeding

558
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:24,930
was confirmed as cervical cancer stage IIA1

559
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:27,270
but not a sign of miscarriage.

560
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:29,060
Excuse me, Director Liu,

561
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:30,220
I have a question.

562
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:32,840
Are her multiple ovarian cysts

563
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,250
unilateral or bilateral,

564
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:35,010
and what about the sizes?

565
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,880
What measures did you take

566
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:37,560
for the removal?

567
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:38,970
Ovarian cyst surgery

568
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,320
has nothing to do with cervical cancer.

569
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,680
I just want to

570
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:43,390
learn more about it.

571
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,990
You're a young doctor

572
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:46,140
and eager to learn.

573
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:48,180
You may come to me after the meeting,

574
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:49,480
and I'll send you

575
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,140
all related data.

576
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:51,930
Thanks, Director Liu.

577
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:55,180
The cervical cancer itself

578
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:57,220
is not highly deadly.

579
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:58,720
If it's discovered in an early stage,

580
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,640
the chance of survival is high.

581
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:02,540
But the patient wanted a baby anxiously,

582
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:04,220
and mistook some of the symptoms

583
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,190
for the signs of miscarriage in early pregnancy,

584
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:08,360
thereby, missing the best timing for treatment.

585
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:10,010
Currently, the patient

586
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:11,410
refuses an abortion.

587
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,120
I have sent you the data.

588
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:18,380
It's a good thing that the patient is young,

589
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:19,450
but also a bad thing.

590
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:20,790
It's a great challenge for us.

591
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:25,530
Director Liu,

592
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:28,680
is the patient's name

593
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,260
Feng Ke?

594
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:32,070
Yes. How do you know?

595
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,570
She's my wife.

596
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:37,180
I don't believe it.

597
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:39,350
Why would she go to another hospital

598
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:40,220
instead of Shengji?

599
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:41,260
I was wondering

600
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:43,670
why the patient had

601
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,470
an ovarian cyst operation at Shengji

602
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:48,220
and came to Mingxin to cure her cervical cancer.

603
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:51,010
Her name is Feng Ke.

604
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:53,670
I think you two

605
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:54,800
need a conversation

606
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:55,470
about this matter.

607
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:57,950
I suggest an abortion,

608
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:00,430
but she refused staunchly.

609
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,790
I can't say

610
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:06,880
that she'll die

611
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,040
if she doesn't end her pregnancy.

612
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,140
Because everything depends

613
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:12,460
during the treatment.

614
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:14,710
However, her cancer cells

615
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:15,590
are very active

616
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:16,540
and grow fast.

617
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:18,340
It's possible

618
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:19,690
that current medical measures

619
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:21,450
won't keep the cancer cells under control.

620
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:22,740
So…

621
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:24,610
End the pregnancy

622
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,020
and treat her cervical cancer first.

623
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:27,180
Her tumor

624
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:28,060
has already reached her uterus.

625
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:29,620
If the treatment

626
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:30,560
doesn't go as expected, then…

627
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:31,670
Uterus removal.

628
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:32,500
She won't agree to that.

629
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:36,530
I understand that as her family,

630
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:37,780
it's difficult to convince her.

631
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:39,860
But as a doctor,

632
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:42,700
I think you know

633
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:44,380
what the best choice is at the moment.

634
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:46,020
Because of her ovarian cyst,

635
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:47,600
she never got pregnant.

636
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:48,590
She's very stressed.

637
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,170
It took us three years

638
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:51,020
to have this baby.

639
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:52,860
She had an operation last year.

640
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:53,920
And the recovery process

641
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:54,720
wasn't easy for her.

642
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,460
Now, she has to give up the baby

643
00:23:57,090 --> 00:23:57,810
and there's a chance

644
00:23:57,810 --> 00:23:59,340
that she won't get pregnant again. I…

645
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:00,580
You know

646
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,850
what the worst-case scenario would be?

647
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:05,140
The worst-case scenario?

648
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:06,900
The worst-case scenario

649
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,540
would be that she dies before the child is mature.

650
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:10,980
Lin Wei,

651
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:12,190
trust me.

652
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:14,260
The greatest pain for every doctor

653
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:15,600
in this world

654
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,100
is the inability to cure their loved ones.

655
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:19,640
Where there's life,

656
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,120
there's hope.

657
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,950
A life unable to create new lives?

658
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,150
I don't see any hope.

659
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:30,620
I don't accept it.

660
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,600
That's negative thinking, my love.

661
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:33,790
The removal of uterus

662
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:34,740
is not necessary.

663
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,960
It'll depend on

664
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:37,890
how the treatment goes.

665
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:39,750
I knew Director Zhang

666
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:41,020
would ask me to end my pregnancy.

667
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:42,980
I don't accept it.

668
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:45,840
Wei, long day, right?

669
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:48,620
What's up?

670
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:49,800
Anything you want to talk about?

671
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:50,830
You have performed

672
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:51,810
ten operations today.

673
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,270
You need to rest.

674
00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:54,320
It's no big deal.

675
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:55,230
I can do several

676
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:56,180
more cesarean operations.

677
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:57,240
Director Tian said

678
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,780
fatigue operation isn't allowed.

679
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,390
Another director has taken your place for the day.

680
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:02,810
It's pointless

681
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:03,580
that you overstrain yourself in the operation room.

682
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:04,740
Tell me,

683
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:06,380
what is not pointless?

684
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:08,230
I know

685
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,220
that you are facing

686
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:11,690
a case similar to Feng Ke.

687
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:13,820
The patient insists on keeping the baby.

688
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:14,950
No matter

689
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:15,710
what choice she makes,

690
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:16,660
you are the doctor.

691
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:18,150
And a doctor's responsibility

692
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:19,220
is to offer the most professional treatment plan possible.

693
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,200
Don't get lost

694
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,260
in the pain of loss.

695
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:23,610
Would it change the patient's mind

696
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,550
after a doctor

697
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,160
offers a professional treatment plan?

698
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:28,500
Is it pretty?

699
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:34,700
It's on.

700
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:41,570
Baby.

701
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:43,930
My baby, hi.

702
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:45,570
I'm Mom.

703
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:47,400
Your mom.

704
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,850
I don't know

705
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,520
if you are a boy or a girl yet.

706
00:25:56,290 --> 00:25:58,060
I'll give you a moniker.

707
00:25:58,380 --> 00:25:59,140
Little Luck.

708
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:00,260
Do you like it?

709
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:02,290
Little Luck,

710
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,760
I have had a struggle

711
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:06,390
with cancer for two months.

712
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,090
No.

713
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:11,550
You and I together have had a struggle

714
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:13,970
with cancer for two months.

715
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:16,290
Ever since I had you,

716
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:20,110
I feel like I have

717
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:21,610
been in a battle,

718
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,870
though I'm not certain about the result.

719
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,090
I have been fighting

720
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:28,290
a bad guy called Cancer every day.

721
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:29,940
But I'm

722
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:30,980
not feeling tired.

723
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,560
Because the thought

724
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:35,460
of you growing

725
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,610
into a little guy

726
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,520
who cries

727
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:40,860
and laughs

728
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:42,380
and calls me Mom

729
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:44,820
at my side

730
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:47,660
makes me so happy.

731
00:26:56,410 --> 00:26:57,780
Dopamine, adrenaline. Quickly.

732
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:26,190
I never had the courage

733
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:28,620
to watch your video recorded on your last day.

734
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:31,540
My love,

735
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:33,560
I have performed

736
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:34,510
almost 8,000 operations,

737
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:37,460
I think it's about time

738
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:39,750
that I find out what you said to me.

739
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:45,580
My dear.

740
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:49,650
Director Zhang told me

741
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:53,430
that the tumor had reached my abdomen.

742
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:58,130
♫My baby, are you sleeping♫

743
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,560
I'm so useless.

744
00:27:59,290 --> 00:28:00,590
I can't hold on much longer.

745
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:05,040
♫I'm hearing your breath♫

746
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:07,700
And our child

747
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:13,850
♫So lucky I can touch your smile♫

748
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:09,690
won't be able to see the world.

749
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:12,940
I'm sorry.

750
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:19,990
♫So lucky I can meet you♫

751
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,680
I know that you'll blame me

752
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:20,140
for my stubbornness.

753
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:22,250
But I don't regret

754
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:27,080
♫Let me hold your tiny hands♫

755
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:23,150
the choice I made.

756
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:25,780
I love our child.

757
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:28,030
I couldn't choose to survive

758
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:28,980
at the cost of its life.

759
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:34,340
♫Courage grows in my mind♫

760
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:30,450
So even if I

761
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,580
had another chance,

762
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:33,860
I would still

763
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:35,680
make the same choice.

764
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:43,510
♫Let me keep your company through seasons♫

765
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:40,650
It has been

766
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:44,060
a difficult period of time for you.

767
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:50,140
♫Keep all your growth in my heart♫

768
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,140
I made you deeply doubt

769
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:48,770
your capability and sense of vocation

770
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:50,720
as a doctor.

771
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:56,990
♫I heard the happiest cry♫

772
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:54,510
Never doubt yourself.

773
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,460
You're the best.

774
00:28:57,850 --> 00:29:04,540
♫Even the air is sweet♫

775
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,400
You must stay strong.

776
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:05,920
Because you and I

777
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:07,090
made an agreement

778
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:13,350
♫Your eyes are full of the kindness over the world♫

779
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:10,360
that after you performed your 8,000th operation,

780
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:13,090
you'd take me to Pokhara.

781
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:14,220
Do you still remember?

782
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:19,550
♫You're the miracle made by heaven♫

783
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,410
May Demeter

784
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:18,980
bless you.

785
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:26,850
♫I heard the happiest cry♫

786
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,920
I'm not that lucky.

787
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:26,640
But I believe you're

788
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:27,830
the lucky one.

789
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:33,680
♫Now life is meaningful♫

790
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:34,180
Keep your chin up, my dear.

791
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:42,920
♫I'll be with you in the future♫

792
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:40,390

♫I love you♫

795
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:11,850
Sister.

796
00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:13,060
What's the matter?

797
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:16,570
Congrui.

798
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:18,110
Could you please

799
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:19,470
do me a favor?

800
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:21,010
Just ask away.

801
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:23,400
You know Wang Dacheng and I

802
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,600
are going to get married, right?

803
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:26,130
I want a body check.

804
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:28,090
You want a premarital examination?

805
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:29,220
Yes, yes.

806
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,640
I didn't get pregnant

807
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:31,510
after years of attempts

808
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:32,650
in my last marriage,

809
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:34,290
so I want a checkup

810
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:35,330
to see if I'm able to have a baby.

811
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,150
If I can't,

812
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:36,860
I won't get married.

813
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:37,980
I don't want to disappoint him.

814
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:39,610
There are many causes

815
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,430
of infertility.

816
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:41,520
Sometimes,

817
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:42,900
it isn't necessarily the female's problem.

818
00:30:42,930 --> 00:30:44,570
The medical technology is advanced today.

819
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:45,540
You can receive treatment

820
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,520
to get pregnant.

821
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:48,740
And you can always try test tube.

822
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:50,390
Don't worry.

823
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:51,780
I'll make an appointment for you.

824
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:56,610
I'm so glad

825
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,590
that I can share

826
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,240
my feelings with you.

827
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:01,140
Previously,

828
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:03,330
I had a problem

829
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:04,540
with you having had a marriage before.

830
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,870
I'm sorry.

831
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:08,270
That's okay.

832
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:10,550
Junxiao,

833
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,250
he is an O.B.,

834
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:14,250
but he's a man.

835
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:16,250
I'm embarrassed

836
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,580
to talk about my thoughts

837
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:18,410
to my brother.

838
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,310
Sister,

839
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:20,730
if you need anything,

840
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:22,130
feel free to come to me.

841
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:24,500
Junxiao is so lucky

842
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,380
to have you.

843
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:28,430
You're such a nice girl.

844
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,220
Oh, right.

845
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:32,240
How much does the examination cost?

846
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,110
I'll give you the money.

847
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:37,970
Oh, you see.

848
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,040
We doctors

849
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:40,860
get a free examination chance every year.

850
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:42,300
I haven't got myself checked this year.

851
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,660
You can have it, free of charge.

852
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:45,220
No, no.

853
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,580
I don't think that's appropriate.

854
00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:48,520
That's OK.

855
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:50,120
Is it really free?

856
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:51,100
Yes, it is.

857
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:54,440
Thank you so much.

858
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:56,280
I'm off to work then.

859
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:56,700
Go.

860
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:57,820
I'll let you know when your appointment is made.

861
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:09,700
Director Huang,

862
00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:10,650
I'd like to know

863
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:12,760
how much a full examination

864
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:14,140
for infertility costs?

865
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:16,820
That much?

866
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,160
It depends

867
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:22,180
on the actual condition, right?

868
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:24,170
No, no, no. Not me.

869
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:25,640
It's a friend.

870
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:27,840
Bye.

871
00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:33,980
Well, it can't be helped.

872
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:35,830
If she knew the price,

873
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:37,300
she wouldn't have it.

874
00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:41,560
Per the goal of controlling the cervical cancer

875
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:42,940
to the largest extent without terminating the pregnancy.

876
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:45,780
My suggestion is

877
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:46,930
NACT during pregnancy.

878
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,730
What is

879
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:51,020
NACT?

880
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,310
NACT

881
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:53,310
during pregnancy

882
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:54,490
is a type of chemotherapy

883
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:55,340
using platinum-based drugs

884
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:56,500
individually

885
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:57,320
or with other drugs.

886
00:32:57,570 --> 00:32:58,970
It's generally once every three weeks.

887
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:01,540
W-Would it work?

888
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:02,230
I want to know

889
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:03,740
if it'll affect the baby.

890
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:04,860
Here's the thing.

891
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:06,390
There's a risk

892
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:07,520
in any kind of treatment.

893
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:08,960
I believe you know that.

894
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:10,010
But nothing is certain.

895
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:12,230
About this,

896
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:13,450
Dr. Lin

897
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:15,260
will specify.

898
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:17,460
NACT

899
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:18,740
can effectively extend

900
00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:20,180
the gestational weeks

901
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:21,030
for a pregnant cervical cancer patient,

902
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:22,900
partly reduce the tumor size,

903
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:24,260
and increase the resection rate

904
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:25,580
for a better long-term outcome.

905
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:27,510
However, the chemotherapy may impose

906
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:28,430
bone marrow suppression on the mother and the child,

907
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:30,740
increase the chances of intrapartum and postpartum hemorrhage

908
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:31,620
and infection.

909
00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:33,470
In addition, it also affects

910
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:34,580
the fetus's intrauterine growth,

911
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:36,940
even the organs.

912
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:37,970
It's reported

913
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:38,710
that a newborn

914
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:40,140
had acute myeloblastic leukemia

915
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:41,340
after the mother

916
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,320
took NACT.

917
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:44,110
But that was a very rare case.

918
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:45,340
I can't agree to that.

919
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:46,890
You want to continue pregnancy

920
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:47,800
while keeping your cancer under control,

921
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:48,380
you'll have

922
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:49,060
to accept a certain level of risk.

923
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,740
I don't accept any level of risk for my baby!

924
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:52,370
I must give birth

925
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:53,280
to a healthy baby.

926
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:54,740
What if the cancer takes my life?

927
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:56,270
What, am I going to leave

928
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:57,230
a sick baby to my husband?

929
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,770
What are you talking about?

930
00:33:58,790 --> 00:33:59,880
You won't die.

931
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,410
If you don't receive any treatment,

932
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:02,310
once your cancer worsens,

933
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,370
you'll die before

934
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:04,610
you give birth to your child.

935
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,620
I'm willing to take that chance.

936
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,679
If I fail,

937
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:10,060
it will have nothing

938
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,250
to do with the hospital.

939
00:34:11,409 --> 00:34:12,389
I can sign the disclaimer.

940
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:17,489
Please watch this.

941
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,530
What's this?

942
00:34:20,449 --> 00:34:21,290
My wife's video.

943
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:24,260
Three days after she recorded the video,

944
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:25,150
she left the world

945
00:34:25,170 --> 00:34:25,900
along with our baby.

946
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:30,920
My dear.

947
00:34:33,219 --> 00:34:34,900
Director Zhang told me

948
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:38,699
that the tumor had reached my abdomen.

949
00:34:40,929 --> 00:34:41,929
I'm so useless.

950
00:34:44,179 --> 00:34:45,340
I can't hold on much longer.

951
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,210
And our child

952
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:52,250
won't be able to see the world.

953
00:34:53,739 --> 00:34:54,540
I'm sorry.

954
00:34:57,139 --> 00:34:58,990
I know that you'll blame me

955
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,420
for my stubbornness.

956
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:05,040
But I don't regret

957
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:05,910
the choice I made.

958
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:08,500
I love our child.

959
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,400
I couldn't choose to survive

960
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:11,290
at the cost of its life.

961
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:12,950
So even if I

962
00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:14,010
had another chance,

963
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:16,260
I would still

964
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:18,090
make the same choice.

965
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:23,890
I, too, am,

966
00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:25,010
no, was

967
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:25,840
the family

968
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:28,590
of a pregnant cervical cancer patient.

969
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:31,340
Please think it over.

970
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:32,400
Must you risk

971
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:33,430
one life

972
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:34,500
with another?

973
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:36,350
Once anything goes wrong,

974
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:37,100
how would

975
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:39,130
the other person cope with life?

976
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:46,030
Where are you going?

977
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:46,580
The operation room.

978
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:50,970
The whole day,

979
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,120
he either spends his time in the operation room

980
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:54,110
or studies Wang Xiaoke's condition.

981
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:55,870
Can you and Nianbai

982
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,470
work out a way for him to take a break?

983
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,360
He can't go on like this.

984
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:18,840
I'm going to the bathroom.

985
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:19,960
I'll go with you.

986
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:21,100
Men's room.

987
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:22,260
I'll wait for you at the door.

988
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:23,860
Fine.

989
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:25,330
I promise you I won't leave.

990
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:27,310
You dragged me here,

991
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:28,180
it means someone else

992
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:29,130
is in charge of the operations, right?

993
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:30,180
But I only

994
00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:31,320
want to wee

995
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:33,370
without disturbance.

996
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,340
Good job, you two.

997
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:45,160
You managed to drag

998
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:46,450
Dr. Lin out of the operation room.

999
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:47,780
The credit goes to Du Di.

1000
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,060
She threatened him that if he didn't come,

1001
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,160
she'd knock him out and carry him here.

1002
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:52,350
Wow, badass.

1003
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,710
Dr. Liu is so sweet.

1004
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:05,260
Woo-hoo.

1005
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:13,340
Woo-hoo.

1006
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,460
All right, thanks, everybody.

1007
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:15,940
I'm Bai.

1008
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:17,140
It's been quite a while.

1009
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:19,660
Bai.

1010
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,370
Look here.

1011
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:22,810
You must be wondering

1012
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:23,980
where I was

1013
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:24,730
for all this time.

1014
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:25,500
Right. Right.

1015
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:26,300
Right.

1016
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:27,400
Normally,

1017
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:28,640
when one person

1018
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:30,980
disappears from a scene in which he used to be all the time,

1019
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,200
there are several possibilities.

1020
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:32,930
Possibility one.

1021
00:37:33,530 --> 00:37:34,800
He has moved on,

1022
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:36,460
and put the past behind him.

1023
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:37,230
Possibility two.

1024
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:38,500
He's dead.

1025
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:40,710
Possibility three.

1026
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:43,120
He's in love.

1027
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,910
Guess what happened to me?

1028
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,470
You're in love, with me!

1029
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:49,780
You're half right.

1030
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:51,100
The "with me" part.

1031
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:54,070
I…

1032
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:55,790
Am in love.

1033
00:37:57,550 --> 00:37:59,510
And my girlfriend is here, too.

1034
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:01,680
The pretty lady over there

1035
00:38:01,810 --> 00:38:02,710
in the green sweater.

1036
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:06,860
Great.

1037
00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:11,170
Don't go.

1038
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:15,450
They say the disclosure of relationship

1039
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:16,320
hurts the fans.

1040
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:18,760
Well, I guess

1041
00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:20,150
this is what I'm doing now.

1042
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:22,450
But tell me,

1043
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,960
can a man hurt his girl's feelings

1044
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:25,340
to cater to other women?

1045
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:26,500
No.

1046
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:27,460
Nice.

1047
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:29,840
Good one.

1048
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:31,180
Now,

1049
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,750
I'd like to say thank you to my girlfriend,

1050
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:35,840
and to those

1051
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,080
who enjoy

1052
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:37,730
my stand-ups.

1053
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:40,450
Good luck! Wish you the best!

1054
00:38:40,770 --> 00:38:41,150
Good one!

1055
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:42,060
I knew

1056
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,460
he couldn't wait to let the world know.

1057
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,590
Bravo! Nice!

1058
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:45,780
He's a real man.

1059
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:47,980
Du Di, this is so romantic.

1060
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,300
Yeah, we're in a relationship.

1061
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:52,520
He made countless announcements.

1062
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:53,610
Enough is enough.

1063
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,420
You're just saying it.

1064
00:38:55,650 --> 00:38:56,220
Show-off.

1065
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:58,540
Not really.

1066
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,340
Wait, what's the matter with you?

1067
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:08,060
You like Liu Nianbia?

1068
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:09,500
No way.

1069
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:11,100
I don't!

1070
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:13,750
I won't be coming

1071
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:16,030
to his stand-ups anymore.

1072
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:18,670
Leave me alone.

1073
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:19,330
As if we care.

1074
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:20,160
What do you mean?

1075
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:23,020
There's something wrong with her head.

1076
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:23,540
You won't get it.

1077
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:24,340
Just watch the show.

1078
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:32,800
Thank you.

1079
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:33,290
All right, thanks.

1080
00:39:36,770 --> 00:39:37,260
Here.

1081
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:37,820
Thanks.

1082
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:39,740
Good for you.

1083
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:40,510
I see you managed

1084
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:41,370
to nail her.

1085
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,730
Watch your tongue.

1086
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:43,880
What do you mean, nail?

1087
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:44,630
Right.

1088
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:45,530
Nail her?

1089
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,740
Like she's some sort of an easy girl.

1090
00:39:46,890 --> 00:39:48,000
She's more than that.

1091
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:49,900
She's a goddess.

1092
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:51,660
I didn't nail her.

1093
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,120
Goddess smiled upon me.

1094
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,330
Of all the ones in love that I know,

1095
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,220
you're the greasiest one.

1096
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:58,130
Fine.

1097
00:39:58,170 --> 00:39:59,300
Miss Goddess and Mr. Mortal-in-love.

1098
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:00,230
What would you like to drink?

1099
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:01,160
What do you want?

1100
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:04,300
You spoke a lot.

1101
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:05,250
A cup of lemonade.

1102
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:05,980
Lemonade.

1103
00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:06,960
Warm.

1104
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:07,700
Warm.

1105
00:40:08,370 --> 00:40:08,940
I will

1106
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,020
throw away

1107
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:10,700
all the lemons we have.

1108
00:40:10,730 --> 00:40:11,370
Because I have

1109
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,780
had enough the sour smell

1110
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,440
in air.

1111
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:24,290
What?

1112
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:26,380
The banner of you.

1113
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,910
[Nianbai in white]

1114
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,910
[Go forth with pride]

1115
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:30,390
From this moment on,

1116
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:32,740
I'm officially not your fan.

1117
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:40,890
You lost another fan

1118
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:41,870
thanks to me.

1119
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:44,490
I wouldn't trade you

1120
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:46,810
for the whole world.

1121
00:40:47,370 --> 00:40:48,270
Am I saying this right?

1122
00:40:50,330 --> 00:40:52,550
Where did you learn it?

1123
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:53,980
From the Internet?

1124
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:55,740
No, from my stand-up experience.

1125
00:40:58,340 --> 00:40:58,980
Where are you going?

1126
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:01,360
I need to stay away

1127
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:02,110
from you.

1128
00:41:02,310 --> 00:41:03,650
Well, I'm coming to you.

1129
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:09,460
Go talk to Du Di.

1130
00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:10,540
Get your hand off me.

1131
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:11,360
Hey, watch it.

1132
00:41:11,490 --> 00:41:12,020
Come on.

1133
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:14,410
I kind of understand

1134
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,030
how Li Fei felt.

1135
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:16,380
Look at them.

1136
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:17,490
Why would he

1137
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,820
need a girlfriend now?

1138
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:20,900
Li Fei was only messing around.

1139
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:22,840
But it's good

1140
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:23,850
that you two are finally together.

1141
00:41:24,290 --> 00:41:25,100
I think

1142
00:41:25,130 --> 00:41:26,060
Liu Nianbai is perfect for you.

1143
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:27,180
Why?

1144
00:41:27,450 --> 00:41:28,420
You're uptight.

1145
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:30,900
Li Junxiao is uptight.

1146
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:32,170
When you two were together,

1147
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:33,010
you were

1148
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:35,180
like two tight bows.

1149
00:41:35,970 --> 00:41:36,820
You'd hurt each other

1150
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:37,880
at any time.

1151
00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:39,550
But with Liu Nianbai,

1152
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:40,960
it doesn't matter

1153
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:42,530
that you're uptight.

1154
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:44,470
He's like the ocean.

1155
00:41:45,390 --> 00:41:46,140
Clear.

1156
00:41:46,690 --> 00:41:47,410
Blue.

1157
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:48,870
Gentle.

1158
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:50,070
No matter what

1159
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:51,100
you shoot at him,

1160
00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:53,310
he takes and resolves it.

1161
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:55,580
You sound like an expert.

1162
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:56,710
I feel like you know us

1163
00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:57,620
more than we do.

1164
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,360
Well, I'm the observer here.

1165
00:41:59,730 --> 00:42:01,030
If you ask me to analyze myself,

1166
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:02,070
I won't be objective.

1167
00:42:03,870 --> 00:42:04,430
What about you?

1168
00:42:04,890 --> 00:42:06,010
How is it going between you and him?

1169
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:07,530
I think he's going

1170
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:08,730
to propose to me.

1171
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:09,600
Really?

1172
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:13,520
Well, that's good.

1173
00:42:14,290 --> 00:42:14,980
I know

1174
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:16,740
it's always been your life plan

1175
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:18,260
to build a family and have a child.

1176
00:42:20,610 --> 00:42:21,620
Sometimes when I look back,

1177
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:23,150
maybe I saw him that way

1178
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:25,840
because I'm

1179
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:26,760
a sensitive person.

1180
00:42:27,050 --> 00:42:28,020
If I don't get

1181
00:42:28,050 --> 00:42:29,330
too serious about

1182
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:30,690
his opinions,

1183
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:31,710
he isn't necessarily

1184
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:32,980
that much of an unpleasant person.

1185
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:35,660
You two are a good match, though.

1186
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:37,060
You're so sweet.

1187
00:42:37,570 --> 00:42:38,370
I hope you are able

1188
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:39,120
to loosen him up a little

1189
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:40,300
so that he won't be

1190
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:42,300
obsessed with making achievements,

1191
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:43,520
and then

1192
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:44,820
you two can live a happy life.

1193
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:47,530
I think

1194
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:49,580
we will live a happy life.

1195
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:50,650
I bet you will.

1196
00:42:51,130 --> 00:42:51,660
But

1197
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:53,150
if he ever dares

1198
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:53,970
to make you sad,

1199
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:54,970
I will make sure he doesn't get away with it.

1200
00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:56,000
Sure thing.

1201
00:42:56,690 --> 00:42:57,760
If that happens,

1202
00:42:57,780 --> 00:42:58,550
I'll need you to beat him up.

1203
00:42:59,110 --> 00:42:59,850
He can't win me.
