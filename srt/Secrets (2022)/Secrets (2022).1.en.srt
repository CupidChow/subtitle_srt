1
00:01:56,617 --> 00:01:57,952
Are we lost?

2
00:01:58,285 --> 00:01:59,578
Not according to Waze.

3
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,484
Who are you texting, anyway?

4
00:02:01,509 --> 00:02:03,226
Don't tell me it's work again.

5
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:06,102
Isn't this is why
we're taking a vacation...

6
00:02:06,127 --> 00:02:07,962
to take a break
and get away from work?

7
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:10,195
We aren't even there yet.

8
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:12,718
We're still not on vacation.

9
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:26,012
I know!

10
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:27,701
I also heard it.

11
00:02:27,726 --> 00:02:29,282
Would you relax?

12
00:02:29,432 --> 00:02:32,273
You're acting like
you saw a celebrity.

13
00:02:32,406 --> 00:02:33,836
Come on.

14
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:46,812
It looks okay.

15
00:02:47,588 --> 00:02:49,022
It's the same as the pictures.

16
00:02:50,513 --> 00:02:51,960
Good afternoon.

17
00:02:53,257 --> 00:02:54,884
Are you Mr. Rading?

18
00:02:55,087 --> 00:02:56,087
Yes, indeed.

19
00:02:56,248 --> 00:02:59,250
And this is my wife, Elena.

20
00:03:00,088 --> 00:03:01,390
How was the trip?

21
00:03:02,006 --> 00:03:05,109
We didn't expect that
this place would be so far.

22
00:03:05,403 --> 00:03:07,593
Yes, this place is pretty far from Manila.

23
00:03:09,806 --> 00:03:13,406
Miss, are there any nearby
groceries around here?

24
00:03:14,662 --> 00:03:15,662
Ma'am...

25
00:03:15,745 --> 00:03:17,580
My wife can hear you

26
00:03:17,605 --> 00:03:19,916
but she doesn't have
the ability to speak.

27
00:03:20,114 --> 00:03:21,699
Oh, pardon me.

28
00:03:21,724 --> 00:03:22,890
I didn't know.

29
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,718
Miss, are there any nearby
groceries around here?

30
00:03:27,866 --> 00:03:28,866
Ma'am...

31
00:03:29,492 --> 00:03:30,992
She can hear you.

32
00:03:33,037 --> 00:03:34,330
I'm so sorry.

33
00:03:34,706 --> 00:03:36,304
Let's just get you settled in.

34
00:03:36,329 --> 00:03:37,434
On another note,

35
00:03:37,459 --> 00:03:40,770
Sir Ronnie told me to ensure

36
00:03:40,795 --> 00:03:44,281
that you and your wife
enjoy your vacation.

37
00:03:45,884 --> 00:03:47,742
We're not married.

38
00:03:47,906 --> 00:03:49,218
We're just friends.

39
00:03:49,414 --> 00:03:50,447
Is that so?

40
00:03:50,642 --> 00:03:52,476
Close friends.

41
00:03:53,725 --> 00:03:54,953
Great.

42
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:13,870
Ma'am, Sir...

43
00:04:13,939 --> 00:04:15,476
Your room is that way.

44
00:04:30,402 --> 00:04:32,170
You're an asshole,
you know that?

45
00:04:32,195 --> 00:04:33,195
Why?

46
00:04:33,723 --> 00:04:34,851
What did I do?

47
00:04:35,767 --> 00:04:37,445
Isn't it obvious?

48
00:04:38,242 --> 00:04:39,479
It's true, isn't it?

49
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:45,383
You just said it for the shock factor,

50
00:04:45,408 --> 00:04:47,093
to rattle those old people.

51
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:49,650
Do you want people
to think that you're my wife?

52
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,520
Whatever.

53
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:55,485
Janine...

54
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:56,510
What are you doing?

55
00:04:57,497 --> 00:04:59,343
What do you think I'm doing?

56
00:05:01,292 --> 00:05:02,796
Why are you smelling that?

57
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:05,605
Because I want to know

58
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:07,765
what kind of people used this room,

59
00:05:08,629 --> 00:05:10,109
and the kind of things they did here,

60
00:05:10,485 --> 00:05:12,529
and the kind of odours
they left in these sheets.

61
00:05:13,742 --> 00:05:14,781
And?

62
00:05:14,845 --> 00:05:16,062
What did you find?

63
00:05:18,927 --> 00:05:19,927
Detergent.

64
00:06:18,339 --> 00:06:20,013
Ah... the guy went outside,

65
00:06:20,038 --> 00:06:22,206
and I think the girl's sleeping.

66
00:06:22,248 --> 00:06:23,816
I haven't seen her go out yet.

67
00:06:25,433 --> 00:06:27,562
Come on, I don't want to disturb them.

68
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:29,107
They might be exhausted from the trip.

69
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:31,105
Don't worry, they'll come by.

70
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:33,175
Then you can serve them the bananas.

71
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:57,128
Chris?

72
00:07:36,009 --> 00:07:37,009
Ma'am.

73
00:07:37,308 --> 00:07:38,925
Did you sleep well?

74
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:41,323
Yes, I slept like a baby.

75
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:44,308
My wife fried some bananas for you.

76
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:46,391
Just a little snack.

77
00:07:46,475 --> 00:07:47,475
Why, thank you.

78
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,210
It looks delicious.

79
00:07:55,591 --> 00:07:56,426
By the way,

80
00:07:56,451 --> 00:07:57,980
do you know where Christian went?

81
00:08:38,514 --> 00:08:39,532
Hey.

82
00:08:39,557 --> 00:08:40,587
What's that?

83
00:08:40,612 --> 00:08:42,447
Mrs. Elena prepared this for us.

84
00:08:43,139 --> 00:08:44,139
Thank you.

85
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:46,558
Where have you been?

86
00:08:47,018 --> 00:08:48,018
The beach.

87
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:49,454
I see...

88
00:08:49,479 --> 00:08:50,646
You went for a swim already.

89
00:08:51,105 --> 00:08:52,457
You were sleeping.

90
00:08:52,482 --> 00:08:53,855
Why would I wake you up?

91
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:29,847
Good afternoon, Ms. Elena.

92
00:09:29,977 --> 00:09:31,417
Is he here yet?

93
00:09:37,902 --> 00:09:38,903
No.

94
00:09:40,129 --> 00:09:41,547
He texted me earlier

95
00:09:41,572 --> 00:09:43,144
saying that he'll arrive today.

96
00:09:48,996 --> 00:09:50,331
He's not here.

97
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:54,659
Do you know when he's coming?

98
00:09:57,171 --> 00:09:58,171
Miss...

99
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:00,341
If he arrives, maybe...

100
00:10:05,424 --> 00:10:08,394
Damn this mute bitch
and her shitty attitude.

101
00:10:18,693 --> 00:10:19,693
Come on...

102
00:10:20,069 --> 00:10:21,633
Enough of that already.

103
00:10:22,714 --> 00:10:24,382
Even if you throw fits like that,

104
00:10:24,407 --> 00:10:26,313
you wouldn't be able
to do anything about it.

105
00:10:28,405 --> 00:10:29,937
Wait a sec...

106
00:10:30,387 --> 00:10:32,598
Who even told Felina

107
00:10:32,623 --> 00:10:34,242
that he is coming in the first place?

108
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:36,043
Wasn't that your nephew, himself?

109
00:10:47,263 --> 00:10:48,681
You're getting ahead of yourself!

110
00:10:48,891 --> 00:10:51,325
He wouldn't be able
to disturb our two guests

111
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:54,227
because he would be staying
at the guest house.

112
00:11:12,165 --> 00:11:13,430
Chris?

113
00:11:14,665 --> 00:11:15,992
Christian!

114
00:11:47,536 --> 00:11:49,843
How come you arrived so late?

115
00:11:50,117 --> 00:11:52,328
We thought you would be here come noon.

116
00:11:52,553 --> 00:11:55,222
Well, I missed the first ride in Cubao.

117
00:11:55,247 --> 00:11:56,849
Luckily enough, I got a ticket

118
00:11:56,874 --> 00:11:59,250
for today's last bus trip to here.

119
00:12:02,727 --> 00:12:04,145
Maybe for about ten days?

120
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:05,170
Just like before.

121
00:12:05,675 --> 00:12:07,692
So, after you stay here...

122
00:12:07,985 --> 00:12:09,236
You're going back to Dubai?

123
00:12:09,319 --> 00:12:10,571
Maybe... I'm not sure.

124
00:12:10,596 --> 00:12:12,512
I might go to Baguio
with my friends first.

125
00:12:12,637 --> 00:12:13,682
Ma'am!

126
00:12:13,724 --> 00:12:15,201
Do you need anything?

127
00:12:15,386 --> 00:12:18,204
No, I just heard you guys talking.

128
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:20,682
So I went out...

129
00:12:20,748 --> 00:12:22,375
Ma'am, this is Leo.

130
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,985
My wife's nephew.

131
00:12:26,028 --> 00:12:28,339
Good evening.
Sorry to bother you.

132
00:12:28,364 --> 00:12:29,364
Let's eat.

133
00:12:31,311 --> 00:12:33,219
I was supposed to tell you this earlier

134
00:12:33,244 --> 00:12:34,989
but I didn't want to bother you.

135
00:12:35,288 --> 00:12:37,965
Leo will also be staying here,

136
00:12:38,474 --> 00:12:40,810
but he won't be staying in this house.

137
00:12:40,835 --> 00:12:42,575
He'd be staying at the guest house.

138
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:44,188
Guest house?

139
00:12:44,288 --> 00:12:46,874
Yup, there's a guest house
not that far from here.

140
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:47,900
It's a bit of a walk,

141
00:12:47,925 --> 00:12:49,645
so I won't be disturbing you at all.

142
00:13:01,915 --> 00:13:03,541
Also, the owners already know that

143
00:13:03,566 --> 00:13:06,231
Leo will be staying here
for a few days.

144
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:10,172
I won't bother you, I promise.

145
00:13:10,197 --> 00:13:12,067
I'll just stay at the guest house.

146
00:13:13,284 --> 00:13:15,254
There's no issue at all.

147
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,493
After all, we're all just...

148
00:13:17,538 --> 00:13:18,973
guests here.

149
00:13:20,568 --> 00:13:21,608
I'll leave you to it then.

150
00:13:21,633 --> 00:13:22,633
Good night.

151
00:13:30,647 --> 00:13:31,814
Where's the husband?

152
00:13:32,362 --> 00:13:33,362
Not a husband.

153
00:13:33,387 --> 00:13:34,764
Just a partner.

154
00:13:39,828 --> 00:13:41,746
Elena, you...

155
00:13:41,771 --> 00:13:44,451
- Maybe the guy has a wife already.
- This is why you can't speak.

156
00:13:44,523 --> 00:13:46,925
Because you're such a huge gossip.

157
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:52,284
Go on. Finish your food.

158
00:14:00,831 --> 00:14:03,065
There's another guest here
other than us?

159
00:14:04,877 --> 00:14:06,712
Ronnie hasn't mentioned anything.

160
00:14:08,064 --> 00:14:11,067
Well, it doesn't matter
if he said something or not.

161
00:14:11,092 --> 00:14:13,245
There's already another one here.

162
00:14:13,969 --> 00:14:15,237
But...

163
00:14:15,262 --> 00:14:18,324
He won't be staying here.

164
00:14:18,349 --> 00:14:20,184
He's staying at the guest house.

165
00:14:21,146 --> 00:14:22,768
- Guest house?
- Yeah.

166
00:14:22,855 --> 00:14:23,855
And where's that?

167
00:14:25,189 --> 00:14:27,222
I also don't know
where that is, actually.

168
00:14:28,609 --> 00:14:30,964
Who's that other guest, anyway?

169
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:34,831
Mrs. Elena's nephew.

170
00:14:35,139 --> 00:14:36,557
They say he always comes here

171
00:14:36,582 --> 00:14:38,636
when he comes home from abroad.

172
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:42,910
Oh?

173
00:14:42,935 --> 00:14:45,034
Why did you turn your phone off?

174
00:14:46,167 --> 00:14:48,331
Marla called earlier

175
00:14:48,629 --> 00:14:50,370
when you were taking a shower.

176
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,905
Come over.

177
00:16:50,263 --> 00:16:51,922
What took you so long?

178
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:57,251
I was waiting for you since earlier today.

179
00:17:34,628 --> 00:17:37,165
Hey, that tickles!

180
00:17:37,881 --> 00:17:39,236
Don't you want it?

181
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:46,251
Leo, stop that...

182
00:17:58,736 --> 00:18:00,939
I told you, it tickles...

183
00:18:12,271 --> 00:18:13,642
Did you miss me?

184
00:18:13,667 --> 00:18:14,667
Yes!

185
00:18:14,835 --> 00:18:16,061
Then say it!

186
00:18:16,086 --> 00:18:17,827
- Did you miss me?!
- I said yes already!

187
00:20:33,241 --> 00:20:34,741
Good morning, miss.

188
00:20:34,766 --> 00:20:36,483
Good morning.

189
00:20:39,636 --> 00:20:41,165
Have you eaten breakfast yet?

190
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:42,107
Not yet.

191
00:20:42,132 --> 00:20:45,264
I'll just wait for Christian to wake up.

192
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:46,753
Where have you been?

193
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:48,233
Oh, just by the market.

194
00:20:48,258 --> 00:20:49,882
I ran some errands for the wife.

195
00:20:50,077 --> 00:20:51,620
Sir Ronnie told us

196
00:20:51,645 --> 00:20:52,973
to cook delicious food for you.

197
00:20:52,998 --> 00:20:54,499
Thank you.

198
00:20:54,803 --> 00:20:57,347
So when is the resort opening again?

199
00:20:57,372 --> 00:20:59,045
It's a pity it's closed.

200
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:00,851
I know, we're still getting things fixed

201
00:21:00,876 --> 00:21:04,678
given that we closed for two years
because of the pandemic.

202
00:21:05,214 --> 00:21:06,398
Well, then...

203
00:21:06,423 --> 00:21:08,026
I'm going to take a walk around the area.

204
00:21:08,051 --> 00:21:09,969
Please tell Chris if he wakes up

205
00:21:09,994 --> 00:21:11,592
that I wanted to take a look around.

206
00:21:11,617 --> 00:21:12,696
No problem.

207
00:21:12,721 --> 00:21:15,032
It's really nice
to take a walk around the beach.

208
00:21:15,057 --> 00:21:16,057
I'm off then.

209
00:22:03,981 --> 00:22:06,842
Oh my... this is too much, ma'am.

210
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,360
You went out for a walk?

211
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:11,131
Did you go to the beach?

212
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:17,181
What are your plans for today?

213
00:22:17,206 --> 00:22:18,458
Are you going to swim?

214
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:22,505
Do you know of any good places
around here in Sta. Maria?

215
00:22:27,795 --> 00:22:29,806
My wife said that maybe

216
00:22:29,831 --> 00:22:33,126
you might want to let
her nephew show you around?

217
00:22:34,203 --> 00:22:38,791
Leo actually knows Sta. Maria by heart

218
00:22:39,099 --> 00:22:40,920
because he's always here if not abroad.

219
00:22:44,229 --> 00:22:46,789
Where do you guys want to go?
Do you have any activities in mind?

220
00:22:47,125 --> 00:22:48,125
It's all up to you.

221
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:49,717
You know it here better than us.

222
00:22:49,969 --> 00:22:52,803
Do you want to go sight-seeing?
Or do you want to eat?

223
00:22:54,323 --> 00:22:55,323
Anywhere, man.

224
00:22:55,976 --> 00:22:58,738
If you guys want to swim,
I know a great place,

225
00:22:58,763 --> 00:22:59,763
with no other people,

226
00:22:59,788 --> 00:23:00,788
a hidden spot.

227
00:23:03,826 --> 00:23:06,537
Auntie, why would I even
bring them to the wet market?

228
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:09,311
Let's just bring them to a place
where they can taste the local cuisine.

229
00:23:09,336 --> 00:23:10,432
I know a place. Let's go.

230
00:23:10,457 --> 00:23:11,917
- Come on!
- Wherever's good.

231
00:23:12,059 --> 00:23:13,317
We have a car, anyway.

232
00:23:13,342 --> 00:23:14,134
Alright, alright.

233
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:15,952
You better get going so you can eat more.

234
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:18,429
You okay?

235
00:23:29,483 --> 00:23:31,873
So how long are you guys together?

236
00:23:32,653 --> 00:23:33,973
How long we're living-in, or...

237
00:23:33,998 --> 00:23:35,278
how long we've known each other?

238
00:23:35,697 --> 00:23:36,952
The live-in one.

239
00:23:37,783 --> 00:23:39,037
Three years, I think?

240
00:23:39,469 --> 00:23:40,810
Almost four.

241
00:23:41,244 --> 00:23:42,324
That's pretty long already.

242
00:23:44,248 --> 00:23:46,983
We met a year before we got together.

243
00:23:47,904 --> 00:23:51,021
Are you sure we're going the right way?

244
00:23:51,046 --> 00:23:53,995
Yeah. I know this.
This is the way.

245
00:24:16,428 --> 00:24:18,412
It's really quiet.

246
00:24:19,268 --> 00:24:20,870
It's off-season, that's why.

247
00:24:20,895 --> 00:24:22,850
It's too hectic back then.

248
00:24:23,901 --> 00:24:25,561
You come here every year?

249
00:24:25,872 --> 00:24:27,912
When I'm on vacation, yeah.

250
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:30,524
What do you do for a living, anyway?

251
00:24:31,545 --> 00:24:33,592
Electrical Engineering.

252
00:24:34,209 --> 00:24:35,649
I don't look the part, don't I?

253
00:24:35,674 --> 00:24:36,566
Why?

254
00:24:36,591 --> 00:24:38,178
What's an engineer even
supposed to look like?

255
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:40,631
Not like this, that's for sure.

256
00:24:41,571 --> 00:24:42,989
My friends from Dubai tell me

257
00:24:43,014 --> 00:24:44,433
I look like a call boy.

258
00:24:45,485 --> 00:24:47,420
I haven't met a call boy yet

259
00:24:47,602 --> 00:24:49,608
so I don't know what they look like.

260
00:24:49,753 --> 00:24:51,479
They look like this, apparently.

261
00:24:51,543 --> 00:24:52,961
Like insatiable perverts.

262
00:25:08,526 --> 00:25:10,170
You? What do you do
for a living?

263
00:25:10,195 --> 00:25:11,319
I.T.

264
00:25:12,169 --> 00:25:14,022
He's an engineer.

265
00:25:14,171 --> 00:25:15,171
Really?

266
00:25:15,293 --> 00:25:17,574
You're the more engineer-looking
one between us, actually.

267
00:25:18,252 --> 00:25:19,252
Is that so?

268
00:25:19,843 --> 00:25:20,843
How about you?

269
00:25:21,156 --> 00:25:22,678
Insurance.

270
00:25:22,849 --> 00:25:24,298
You're an insurance agent?

271
00:25:24,323 --> 00:25:25,449
Really?

272
00:25:25,849 --> 00:25:26,849
Damn.

273
00:25:26,892 --> 00:25:28,373
She's an area manager already.

274
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,912
She's a big boss.

275
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,373
How many agents are under you now, Jan?

276
00:25:32,689 --> 00:25:33,701
Well...

277
00:25:33,726 --> 00:25:35,116
Almost three hundred.

278
00:25:35,415 --> 00:25:37,351
Three hundred... Wow!

279
00:25:37,486 --> 00:25:39,069
Living up to the 'Big Boss' name!

280
00:25:39,094 --> 00:25:40,491
That's surprising, really.

281
00:25:40,584 --> 00:25:41,509
Why?

282
00:25:41,534 --> 00:25:42,983
Because I don't look the part?

283
00:25:43,008 --> 00:25:43,925
No.

284
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:45,106
Because...

285
00:25:45,131 --> 00:25:47,202
You're that young,
and you're a 'Big Boss' already?

286
00:25:47,227 --> 00:25:48,227
That's really impressive.

287
00:25:48,522 --> 00:25:51,528
Is she going to become an area manager
if she's not the best?

288
00:25:51,666 --> 00:25:53,947
I think you have an enormous
amount of income, am I right?

289
00:25:54,628 --> 00:25:55,688
So, who has the larger income?

290
00:25:55,713 --> 00:25:58,350
The insurance agent,
or the one in I.T.?

291
00:25:58,514 --> 00:25:59,907
Why are you even asking that?

292
00:25:59,932 --> 00:26:00,817
Nothing.

293
00:26:00,842 --> 00:26:01,835
You know,

294
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:02,944
we don't really care who

295
00:26:02,969 --> 00:26:05,280
has the bigger salary between us.

296
00:26:05,931 --> 00:26:06,931
Good.

297
00:26:08,642 --> 00:26:09,642
Excuse me.

298
00:26:15,232 --> 00:26:18,022
Are you really a manager
of three hundred agents?

299
00:26:18,485 --> 00:26:20,712
Why can't you just believe it?

300
00:26:20,938 --> 00:26:21,647
No, I mean...

301
00:26:21,672 --> 00:26:23,215
Women like you,

302
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,428
if they aren't dry as a desert already,
they look like cows.

303
00:26:25,512 --> 00:26:27,764
Because they don't do
anything else other than work.

304
00:26:36,479 --> 00:26:37,730
Leo.

305
00:26:38,024 --> 00:26:39,024
What's the plan?

306
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:40,283
Let's just go home.

307
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:41,834
We're going home?

308
00:26:42,194 --> 00:26:43,234
It's too early!

309
00:26:43,259 --> 00:26:44,552
- It's too hot.
- Are you sure?

310
00:26:44,577 --> 00:26:45,577
Yes.

311
00:26:47,973 --> 00:26:49,432
Another one of her 'crazy phases'.

312
00:26:49,933 --> 00:26:50,933
Well, she's a woman.

313
00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:53,022
She just wants your attention.

314
00:26:55,264 --> 00:26:56,923
What does she want from you, anyway?

315
00:26:57,607 --> 00:26:58,607
Who?

316
00:26:59,025 --> 00:27:00,834
Who else am I talking about but Marla?

317
00:27:01,376 --> 00:27:03,396
Isn't she the one
who keeps on harassing you?

318
00:27:04,067 --> 00:27:05,444
Not harassing.

319
00:27:05,819 --> 00:27:07,217
Just asking a question.

320
00:27:07,701 --> 00:27:10,647
She already knows
that we're on a vacation right now.

321
00:27:11,162 --> 00:27:12,920
What does she even want to know?

322
00:27:14,124 --> 00:27:15,983
When is the next time you'll send money?

323
00:27:18,132 --> 00:27:19,498
You made your point.

324
00:27:19,629 --> 00:27:20,629
That's enough.

325
00:27:23,508 --> 00:27:25,162
The problem with you is

326
00:27:25,982 --> 00:27:27,901
that when she mentions the kid,

327
00:27:28,179 --> 00:27:30,186
you give her everything that she wants.

328
00:27:30,577 --> 00:27:31,804
It's true, isn't it?

329
00:27:31,892 --> 00:27:33,631
She's just using Paolo.

330
00:27:33,656 --> 00:27:35,496
How many times
are we going to talk about this?

331
00:27:36,688 --> 00:27:38,702
Everything that she asks
from me is for Paolo.

332
00:27:38,727 --> 00:27:40,048
Not for her.

333
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:43,553
As it should be!

334
00:27:43,962 --> 00:27:45,755
The woman is married already, right?

335
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:47,131
Marla is married!

336
00:27:47,532 --> 00:27:48,668
What does she want?

337
00:27:48,693 --> 00:27:50,236
That you give her an allowance?

338
00:27:50,744 --> 00:27:52,319
You don't know Marla.

339
00:27:52,537 --> 00:27:54,014
So don't tell me

340
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:55,772
what I have to do with her.

341
00:27:56,861 --> 00:27:59,037
You take care of your own problems,

342
00:27:59,189 --> 00:28:00,764
and I will deal with mine.

343
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Okay?

344
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,741
Tell me the truth.

345
00:28:10,149 --> 00:28:11,710
Do you still love her?

346
00:28:14,173 --> 00:28:16,053
She is the mother of my kid.

347
00:28:29,074 --> 00:28:30,412
Thank you, Auntie.

348
00:28:36,706 --> 00:28:38,750
How are they?

349
00:28:38,875 --> 00:28:39,960
They're okay, Auntie.

350
00:28:39,985 --> 00:28:41,269
They seem good.

351
00:28:41,294 --> 00:28:42,294
Happy.

352
00:28:51,012 --> 00:28:52,012
The girl is off-limits.

353
00:28:52,405 --> 00:28:53,448
Come on, Auntie...

354
00:28:53,473 --> 00:28:55,811
That was nothing.

355
00:28:55,850 --> 00:28:56,850
We're just friends.

356
00:29:04,818 --> 00:29:06,361
She went back here earlier.

357
00:29:07,101 --> 00:29:08,498
And? Then what?

358
00:29:09,953 --> 00:29:11,633
Auntie, you're overthinking this too much.

359
00:29:11,658 --> 00:29:12,367
We're just friends.

360
00:29:12,392 --> 00:29:14,334
You're too overbearing.

361
00:29:14,529 --> 00:29:16,325
I'm telling you, it's nothing.

362
00:29:16,705 --> 00:29:18,116
I'll get going now.

363
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:26,130
Hey!

364
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:28,077
Why are you alone?

365
00:29:29,819 --> 00:29:30,902
Nothing.

366
00:29:30,927 --> 00:29:31,927
Just getting some air.

367
00:29:31,952 --> 00:29:32,952
Where's your girlfriend?

368
00:29:33,068 --> 00:29:34,755
Back at the house.

369
00:29:36,121 --> 00:29:38,139
The waves here always been this big?

370
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:39,677
That's nothing.

371
00:29:39,702 --> 00:29:41,913
Come storm season, man,
the waves will be much bigger.

372
00:29:41,938 --> 00:29:43,231
That's why people come here...

373
00:29:43,256 --> 00:29:44,834
the waves are beautiful.

374
00:29:45,941 --> 00:29:47,654
You really are a regular here, huh.

375
00:29:47,819 --> 00:29:48,819
Why?

376
00:29:48,944 --> 00:29:50,130
No reason. I just like it here.

377
00:29:50,155 --> 00:29:51,697
Why? Do you even need a reason?

378
00:29:51,722 --> 00:29:55,338
Maybe because I've got free lodging here
because of Auntie Elena.

379
00:29:56,121 --> 00:29:57,121
Hey!

380
00:29:58,751 --> 00:29:59,418
You know her?

381
00:29:59,473 --> 00:30:00,473
Oh, yeah. She's a friend.

382
00:30:00,498 --> 00:30:01,249
What took you so long?

383
00:30:01,274 --> 00:30:02,809
I thought you were out by four?

384
00:30:02,834 --> 00:30:04,394
I couldn't sneak away.

385
00:30:04,419 --> 00:30:06,924
- Have you bought it?
- The boss had some tasks for me.

386
00:30:06,949 --> 00:30:07,939
Of course!

387
00:30:07,964 --> 00:30:08,964
How about the...

388
00:30:08,989 --> 00:30:11,176
Obviously. How could I forget?

389
00:30:13,312 --> 00:30:14,738
Is he the guest?

390
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:16,948
Right, yeah. Chris, this is Felina.

391
00:30:16,973 --> 00:30:17,973
Felina, this is Chris.

392
00:30:17,998 --> 00:30:18,998
My friend.

393
00:30:19,568 --> 00:30:20,511
Friend?

394
00:30:20,536 --> 00:30:21,536
Just a friend?

395
00:30:22,689 --> 00:30:24,549
Alright. Special friend.

396
00:30:24,803 --> 00:30:25,803
Asshole.

397
00:30:26,107 --> 00:30:27,667
Fine. Friends with benefits.

398
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,175
What am I, a sex toy?

399
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,695
Then fucking friends it is.

400
00:30:31,073 --> 00:30:32,073
Idiot.

401
00:30:32,447 --> 00:30:33,447
You drink?

402
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,448
Isn't it too early for a drink?

403
00:30:35,473 --> 00:30:38,877
Is there a law that states
what time people are allowed to drink?

404
00:30:39,746 --> 00:30:41,275
Come on, just come with us.

405
00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:42,724
- Where?
- Hurry.

406
00:30:42,749 --> 00:30:43,749
At the guest house.

407
00:30:44,423 --> 00:30:45,838
Janine might worry.

408
00:30:45,958 --> 00:30:47,666
Then call her
so she can join us.

409
00:30:48,527 --> 00:30:50,188
Do you want her to join us?

410
00:30:51,382 --> 00:30:52,382
I'm fine.

411
00:30:53,577 --> 00:30:55,009
You miss me, don't you?

412
00:30:55,244 --> 00:30:56,464
Whatever you say.

413
00:30:56,650 --> 00:30:57,814
Asshole.

414
00:31:54,776 --> 00:31:58,007
So this is where the guest house is.

415
00:31:58,125 --> 00:31:59,618
Yup. Come on.

416
00:32:33,813 --> 00:32:36,125
Are you wondering why I chose to stay here

417
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:37,360
over the big house?

418
00:32:40,076 --> 00:32:41,594
Gin? Tequila?

419
00:32:41,619 --> 00:32:42,822
Or vodka?

420
00:32:44,495 --> 00:32:45,495
You have a whole lot.

421
00:32:46,195 --> 00:32:47,672
Of course. It's a vacation, isn't it?

422
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:49,190
I mean, would you

423
00:32:49,215 --> 00:32:51,541
go to a war without a gun?

424
00:32:52,078 --> 00:32:53,229
Did you buy that here?

425
00:32:53,254 --> 00:32:55,283
No. At Duty Free.

426
00:32:55,757 --> 00:32:57,717
It's bad to drink with an
empty stomach, you know.

427
00:32:57,959 --> 00:33:00,320
You limit yourself too much, you know.

428
00:33:00,345 --> 00:33:02,238
You're too behaved.
Am I right, Babes?

429
00:33:02,263 --> 00:33:03,713
I can see that.

430
00:33:05,729 --> 00:33:06,729
Here.

431
00:33:06,957 --> 00:33:08,389
Eat to your heart's content.

432
00:33:17,987 --> 00:33:19,588
My arm's going numb already.

433
00:33:20,934 --> 00:33:21,934
There you go!

434
00:33:22,164 --> 00:33:23,484
You're such a bad influence, Leo.

435
00:33:23,509 --> 00:33:25,094
What the fuck are you talking about...

436
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:26,502
And in english, too!

437
00:33:26,901 --> 00:33:29,295
Believe me, that boy is bad already.

438
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:31,086
He's just putting a front.

439
00:33:31,111 --> 00:33:32,154
Are you a good boy?

440
00:33:34,087 --> 00:33:35,994
I don't think I believe you, man.

441
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,136
- Yeah?
- There you go.

442
00:33:42,345 --> 00:33:43,345
"Yeah."

443
00:33:45,098 --> 00:33:47,494
People like him who put up a front

444
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:49,440
they're the ones who's got
really bad thoughts.

445
00:33:49,465 --> 00:33:50,465
Right, babes?

446
00:33:50,579 --> 00:33:51,579
Whatever you say.

447
00:33:51,604 --> 00:33:52,604
Here.

448
00:33:53,022 --> 00:33:54,580
To a new friendship.

449
00:33:56,818 --> 00:33:57,818
Bottoms up!

450
00:34:23,136 --> 00:34:24,136
Back there.

451
00:34:24,381 --> 00:34:25,381
With Leo.

452
00:34:33,896 --> 00:34:34,896
The girl?

453
00:34:35,315 --> 00:34:36,315
Yes.

454
00:34:40,632 --> 00:34:42,050
Well, what can I even do?

455
00:34:42,317 --> 00:34:43,735
You're the one who should go there

456
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:45,251
and scold him

457
00:34:45,575 --> 00:34:47,330
since he's your nephew!

458
00:35:03,343 --> 00:35:05,386
Have you seen him, sir?

459
00:35:06,596 --> 00:35:08,264
By the beach. With Leo.

460
00:35:09,244 --> 00:35:10,578
What is he doing there?

461
00:35:11,245 --> 00:35:12,955
Drinking, I think.

462
00:35:14,103 --> 00:35:15,642
Do you want me to fetch him?

463
00:35:16,731 --> 00:35:18,483
Please don't trouble yourself.
I'll do it.

464
00:35:18,524 --> 00:35:20,213
Thank you for this, Mr. Rading.

465
00:35:59,603 --> 00:36:01,448
I'm not really from here.

466
00:36:01,473 --> 00:36:02,473
I'm from Tarlac.

467
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,421
She's working at a resort

468
00:36:05,446 --> 00:36:06,446
as a receptionist.

469
00:36:07,463 --> 00:36:08,902
What do you mean, receptionist?

470
00:36:08,927 --> 00:36:10,251
More like a slave.

471
00:36:10,276 --> 00:36:12,820
She also lets the owner's
sons use her sometimes.

472
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:14,389
You're such an asshole!

473
00:36:14,414 --> 00:36:15,415
Why would you say that?

474
00:36:15,456 --> 00:36:16,475
Why not? It's true, isn't it?

475
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:18,643
Every time they come by,
you let them use you.

476
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,286
- That happened once!
- Once?

477
00:36:20,311 --> 00:36:21,604
Alright, fine. Two times.

478
00:36:21,646 --> 00:36:23,164
You know, we should

479
00:36:23,189 --> 00:36:26,025
go to that bar
by the beach some time.

480
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:28,069
We met each other there, actually.

481
00:36:28,094 --> 00:36:29,134
That was last year, right?

482
00:36:29,762 --> 00:36:31,239
Once, he went to the resort.

483
00:36:31,264 --> 00:36:33,353
To drink. To party.

484
00:36:33,558 --> 00:36:35,422
But he wasn't able to pick up any women

485
00:36:35,447 --> 00:36:38,119
because he was too corny.

486
00:36:38,646 --> 00:36:40,955
That's why I just settled with this slut.

487
00:36:42,191 --> 00:36:44,322
That was how we met.

488
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:45,724
Just like the movies, isn't it?

489
00:36:45,749 --> 00:36:47,000
Like a romantic comedy.

490
00:36:47,576 --> 00:36:49,853
It was love at first sight
for her when she saw me.

491
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,155
In your dreams.

492
00:36:51,259 --> 00:36:51,968
Alright. Alright.

493
00:36:51,993 --> 00:36:53,302
Not love at first sight.

494
00:36:53,327 --> 00:36:54,327
Horny at first sight.

495
00:36:54,704 --> 00:36:56,139
Fuck you. Idiot.

496
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:57,890
His self-confidence is too big, isn't it?

497
00:36:58,024 --> 00:37:00,110
Fuck you, too. Don't deny it!

498
00:37:00,392 --> 00:37:01,894
Even from our first date

499
00:37:01,919 --> 00:37:04,142
I knew that you were
dying to taste this dick.

500
00:37:06,299 --> 00:37:07,662
You're such a dick, Leo.

501
00:37:07,687 --> 00:37:08,687
What a pervert.

502
00:37:10,052 --> 00:37:12,127
This guy might think that...

503
00:37:12,597 --> 00:37:13,947
What's your name again?

504
00:37:14,365 --> 00:37:14,949
Christian.

505
00:37:14,974 --> 00:37:16,189
Hey. Are you drunk already?

506
00:37:17,977 --> 00:37:21,119
Christian might think
that I'm really a slut.

507
00:37:21,355 --> 00:37:23,041
Just so you know, I'm not a slut.

508
00:37:23,232 --> 00:37:24,792
I also don't open my legs for everyone.

509
00:37:24,816 --> 00:37:26,209
I'm just compassionate.

510
00:37:26,281 --> 00:37:28,296
Generous.

511
00:37:28,321 --> 00:37:29,084
Christian...

512
00:37:29,109 --> 00:37:31,549
You only need to touch her a bit
and she will open up for you.

513
00:37:31,574 --> 00:37:32,574
See!

514
00:37:33,205 --> 00:37:34,051
Christian...

515
00:37:34,076 --> 00:37:36,638
You know, just by the name...
you can already see the sophistication.

516
00:37:36,662 --> 00:37:39,315
And there's no 'Christian'
in this world

517
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,851
that would behave like a monkey.

518
00:37:40,876 --> 00:37:43,060
- Like a monkey?
- Yes. A monkey.

519
00:37:43,085 --> 00:37:44,986
But that's what you want, right?

520
00:37:45,046 --> 00:37:47,002
To be treated like a whore, right?

521
00:37:47,131 --> 00:37:49,322
That hurts, Leo!
You're such a prick.

522
00:37:57,433 --> 00:37:59,877
I wish I didn't agree to come here.

523
00:38:00,394 --> 00:38:03,648
Don't start an argument,
listen to what he has to say.

524
00:38:12,346 --> 00:38:13,848
I do not think he loves me enough.

525
00:38:13,873 --> 00:38:14,842
Last.

526
00:38:14,867 --> 00:38:15,867
Last one.

527
00:38:16,118 --> 00:38:17,822
Did you come here alone, Christian?

528
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,554
I already told you he has a girlfriend.

529
00:38:19,579 --> 00:38:20,496
She's at the main house.

530
00:38:20,521 --> 00:38:21,521
Stop dreaming already.

531
00:38:22,242 --> 00:38:23,666
You're really exclusive?

532
00:38:24,851 --> 00:38:26,371
You should call her here
so she can join us.

533
00:38:26,396 --> 00:38:26,896
Foursome.

534
00:38:26,921 --> 00:38:28,111
It's gonna be fun.

535
00:38:28,881 --> 00:38:30,400
They're having a lover's quarrel.

536
00:38:33,689 --> 00:38:36,317
That's why you fought earlier, right?

537
00:38:36,342 --> 00:38:37,801
Because some girl called you.

538
00:38:38,729 --> 00:38:39,729
Stop harassing him, Leo.

539
00:38:41,143 --> 00:38:42,143
I totally agree.

540
00:38:42,353 --> 00:38:43,353
I know.

541
00:38:43,396 --> 00:38:44,939
Janine is the jealous type.

542
00:38:45,731 --> 00:38:48,182
I think all women are jealous types.

543
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:49,936
Not me!

544
00:38:49,961 --> 00:38:50,962
I'm wide-minded.

545
00:38:50,987 --> 00:38:52,381
Idiot. What the heck is 'wide-minded'?

546
00:38:52,405 --> 00:38:53,322
It's 'broad-minded'.

547
00:38:53,347 --> 00:38:55,166
What the hell are you talking about?

548
00:38:55,866 --> 00:38:57,400
I mean. Personally...

549
00:38:57,702 --> 00:38:58,786
If the guy doesn't want to,

550
00:38:58,811 --> 00:39:00,651
then that's what it is!
Like "Fuck you", right?

551
00:39:00,947 --> 00:39:03,169
You're overreacting.
Who are you jealous of, anyway?

552
00:39:03,194 --> 00:39:04,058
Me?

553
00:39:04,224 --> 00:39:05,142
Come on, babes.

554
00:39:05,167 --> 00:39:06,727
You don't have the right to be jealous.

555
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:07,752
Did I say anything?

556
00:39:08,119 --> 00:39:09,078
I was trying to say that...

557
00:39:09,103 --> 00:39:10,690
I'm not a jealous type of girl.

558
00:39:10,772 --> 00:39:12,458
Plus, who am I gonna be
jealous of with you?

559
00:39:12,483 --> 00:39:13,274
Fuck you, really.

560
00:39:13,299 --> 00:39:15,111
It's like as if you'd be able to wait

561
00:39:15,136 --> 00:39:17,414
for me everytime you want sex.

562
00:39:17,439 --> 00:39:20,359
But you let the resort
owner's son use you?

563
00:39:20,689 --> 00:39:21,909
Watch it, you asshole!

564
00:39:22,027 --> 00:39:23,536
I'm not a slut, okay?

565
00:39:23,607 --> 00:39:26,432
I had feelings first before
I let that asshole use me.

566
00:39:26,814 --> 00:39:28,307
Alright, I'm sorry. Here.

567
00:39:28,784 --> 00:39:29,784
There's nothing left.

568
00:39:55,384 --> 00:39:57,570
What you need now, man, is...

569
00:39:57,595 --> 00:39:59,080
something calm.

570
00:39:59,446 --> 00:40:00,114
Chill.

571
00:40:00,139 --> 00:40:00,990
There you go!

572
00:40:01,015 --> 00:40:01,860
That's right!

573
00:40:01,932 --> 00:40:02,932
Chill.

574
00:40:03,905 --> 00:40:04,948
I'm chill.

575
00:40:05,895 --> 00:40:07,400
Does that look like chill to you?

576
00:40:07,897 --> 00:40:09,416
Isn't there a saying that says...

577
00:40:09,649 --> 00:40:10,775
Life is short.

578
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:12,822
Why make it shorter?

579
00:40:13,069 --> 00:40:14,920
Idiot. In english, too.

580
00:40:15,134 --> 00:40:15,969
Can you shut up?

581
00:40:15,994 --> 00:40:17,138
Maybe he knows english better.

582
00:40:17,163 --> 00:40:19,611
Idiot. I'm good at english.

583
00:40:20,076 --> 00:40:20,926
Sure.

584
00:40:20,951 --> 00:40:21,951
If you're drunk.

585
00:40:22,553 --> 00:40:23,971
But my english is good, right?

586
00:40:23,996 --> 00:40:25,197
Right, Christian?

587
00:40:25,537 --> 00:40:27,846
Anyways, it's time you
took out our dessert.

588
00:40:28,793 --> 00:40:29,793
There it is.

589
00:40:31,462 --> 00:40:32,900
Let the party continue.

590
00:40:41,697 --> 00:40:42,573
Don't tell me

591
00:40:42,598 --> 00:40:44,072
you haven't tried this yet.

592
00:40:44,928 --> 00:40:47,174
I've tried wilder stuff than that.

593
00:40:48,013 --> 00:40:49,639
Fuck, there we go!

594
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:52,417
I tell you our new friend
has a screw loose or two.

595
00:41:05,579 --> 00:41:06,664
There we go.

596
00:41:08,683 --> 00:41:09,684
Big boy.

597
00:41:23,549 --> 00:41:26,346
Stop it, Leo...
Christian's here.

598
00:41:28,602 --> 00:41:30,658
Does my woman look cheap to you, man?

599
00:41:32,273 --> 00:41:33,900
Do you want to taste her?

600
00:41:35,583 --> 00:41:37,564
It's okay with you, right?

601
00:41:38,446 --> 00:41:40,228
It's his choice.

602
00:41:41,323 --> 00:41:42,682
No, thank you.

603
00:41:43,161 --> 00:41:44,902
I have to go back already.

604
00:41:44,927 --> 00:41:45,678
Hey...

605
00:41:45,703 --> 00:41:47,205
Come on, man.

606
00:41:48,122 --> 00:41:49,689
You can do it on your own.

607
00:41:50,314 --> 00:41:51,613
Are you sure?

608
00:42:10,198 --> 00:42:11,198
Chris...

609
00:42:11,812 --> 00:42:12,812
Stop it.

610
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:17,284
I said stop it, Chris!

611
00:42:17,309 --> 00:42:18,685
You smell like alcohol!

612
00:42:27,538 --> 00:42:29,117
Stop it!

613
00:42:29,371 --> 00:42:31,476
Don't you get it?
I'm not in the mood.

614
00:42:35,211 --> 00:42:37,132
What? You went to the guest house

615
00:42:37,157 --> 00:42:38,515
so you could get drunk.

616
00:42:39,169 --> 00:42:40,920
Did you also smoke?

617
00:42:46,164 --> 00:42:47,164
Don't touch me.

618
00:42:48,491 --> 00:42:49,491
Fuck you!

619
00:42:51,784 --> 00:42:53,287
What did you just say?

620
00:42:53,392 --> 00:42:54,338
I said...

621
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:55,648
Fuck you!

622
00:44:57,454 --> 00:44:59,086
There's no water.

623
00:45:17,623 --> 00:45:19,226
Mister Rading?

624
00:45:22,711 --> 00:45:24,367
Mister Rading?

625
00:45:35,255 --> 00:45:36,255
Mister Rading?

626
00:45:36,350 --> 00:45:37,350
Yes?

627
00:45:37,772 --> 00:45:40,621
The bathroom was working fine last night.

628
00:45:40,646 --> 00:45:43,791
Now, there's no water
coming from the faucet.

629
00:45:43,816 --> 00:45:44,667
Oh...

630
00:45:44,692 --> 00:45:46,252
Maybe something clogged it.

631
00:45:46,277 --> 00:45:49,546
The pipes in this house
are already old.

632
00:45:49,571 --> 00:45:51,090
They're also prone to rust.

633
00:45:51,115 --> 00:45:53,336
Because we're near the sea.

634
00:45:54,009 --> 00:45:54,635
Don't worry.

635
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:57,797
I'll ask Leo to take a look at it.

636
00:45:58,805 --> 00:45:59,723
Why him?

637
00:45:59,748 --> 00:46:02,172
Don't you have a local plumber around?

638
00:46:02,292 --> 00:46:05,015
Well, he already knows
his way around a house.

639
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:06,450
He's an engineer.

640
00:46:06,874 --> 00:46:09,014
Also, if I hired a local plumber...

641
00:46:09,550 --> 00:46:10,968
it's just additional expenses.

642
00:46:13,024 --> 00:46:14,594
Alright, then.

643
00:47:14,573 --> 00:47:15,573
What's this?

644
00:47:15,699 --> 00:47:17,179
For your hangover.

645
00:47:17,831 --> 00:47:18,831
What is it?

646
00:47:19,036 --> 00:47:20,036
Poison.

647
00:47:21,110 --> 00:47:22,975
Good morning, boss.

648
00:47:23,624 --> 00:47:24,624
You okay?

649
00:47:24,845 --> 00:47:25,845
I'm good.

650
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:28,329
We're just going to take a look at

651
00:47:28,354 --> 00:47:30,522
what's wrong with
the faucet in your bathroom.

652
00:47:30,633 --> 00:47:31,633
Thanks.

653
00:47:32,168 --> 00:47:33,168
I'll get going, Chris.

654
00:47:40,955 --> 00:47:42,195
I don't like him.

655
00:47:42,542 --> 00:47:43,726
What do you want to do?

656
00:47:44,019 --> 00:47:45,609
Whatever. I just don't like him.

657
00:47:46,688 --> 00:47:49,820
I really feel like
he's not a good person.

658
00:47:49,967 --> 00:47:51,687
I don't trust him.

659
00:47:52,169 --> 00:47:53,587
Aren't you being judgemental?

660
00:47:53,612 --> 00:47:54,612
No, I'm not.

661
00:47:56,323 --> 00:47:57,625
Oh. Right.

662
00:47:58,447 --> 00:48:00,211
You're friends already.

663
00:48:00,915 --> 00:48:02,500
You're drinking buddies already.

664
00:48:02,830 --> 00:48:04,343
You're pot buddies already.

665
00:48:04,713 --> 00:48:05,713
I'm sorry.

666
00:48:17,094 --> 00:48:18,846
Are you finished yet?

667
00:48:19,610 --> 00:48:22,091
I don't think so.
I'm still here.

668
00:48:23,642 --> 00:48:25,452
Where's Mr. Rading?

669
00:48:25,678 --> 00:48:28,014
I think Uncle Rading
went to the town proper

670
00:48:28,039 --> 00:48:29,373
to buy a new pipe because

671
00:48:29,398 --> 00:48:30,688
this needs to get replaced.

672
00:48:31,179 --> 00:48:32,539
Are you going to use the bathroom?

673
00:48:33,068 --> 00:48:34,545
No. It's okay.

674
00:48:34,624 --> 00:48:35,666
I'll leave you to it.

675
00:48:44,997 --> 00:48:47,048
You guys are a lucky couple, you know.

676
00:48:47,291 --> 00:48:49,735
You can spend your vacation together.

677
00:48:50,169 --> 00:48:51,688
Like a honeymoon.

678
00:48:52,110 --> 00:48:55,126
In my case, I'm always desperate
to come back here to...

679
00:48:55,476 --> 00:48:56,519
take a huge break.

680
00:48:56,544 --> 00:48:58,064
That's why I get shit-faced every day.

681
00:49:02,115 --> 00:49:03,116
Obviously...

682
00:49:03,141 --> 00:49:06,186
You and Christian didn't just
go out and drink last night.

683
00:49:07,498 --> 00:49:09,378
What's wrong? Your boyfriend
had fun, didn't he?

684
00:49:09,737 --> 00:49:11,322
He should've brought you, you know.

685
00:49:11,574 --> 00:49:13,159
And what will I even do there?

686
00:49:13,483 --> 00:49:15,180
Well... A lot of things.

687
00:49:15,668 --> 00:49:17,754
Christian learned a
lot of things last night.

688
00:49:17,885 --> 00:49:20,179
I'm not sure if I'm interested

689
00:49:20,204 --> 00:49:23,260
in learning about whatever it is
that you taught him.

690
00:49:23,285 --> 00:49:24,438
Well...

691
00:49:24,870 --> 00:49:26,508
You need to experience it.

692
00:49:26,705 --> 00:49:28,916
How else will you know
if you want it or not?

693
00:49:32,366 --> 00:49:34,790
This pipe needs to be replaced.

694
00:49:35,083 --> 00:49:36,603
When pipes are unused for a long time,

695
00:49:37,165 --> 00:49:38,165
they get rusty.

696
00:49:38,406 --> 00:49:39,406
Is it done?

697
00:49:40,694 --> 00:49:41,403
Almost.

698
00:49:41,428 --> 00:49:43,876
Uncle Rading already went out
to buy a replacement pipe.

699
00:49:44,223 --> 00:49:45,223
Good.

700
00:49:46,112 --> 00:49:47,648
Well, that's just me.

701
00:49:48,146 --> 00:49:49,407
It's a specialty of mine.

702
00:49:49,432 --> 00:49:51,094
A problem-solver.

703
00:49:52,773 --> 00:49:54,107
Do you have any plans for later?

704
00:49:54,333 --> 00:49:55,810
I wanted to ask
you guys to go swimming.

705
00:49:55,835 --> 00:49:56,835
Where?

706
00:49:57,141 --> 00:49:59,525
I know a cove nearby.
It's really peaceful.

707
00:49:59,550 --> 00:50:00,899
We can swim there.

708
00:50:01,499 --> 00:50:03,042
Well? Do you want to come?

709
00:50:03,116 --> 00:50:04,540
It's too hot outside.

710
00:50:05,057 --> 00:50:07,017
That's why we're going swimming.
Because it's hot.

711
00:50:07,513 --> 00:50:08,931
If you want to go swimming...

712
00:50:08,956 --> 00:50:11,141
Why would you go so far?
There's a beach right here.

713
00:50:12,727 --> 00:50:13,984
Do you want to come?

714
00:50:14,586 --> 00:50:15,586
Sure.

715
00:50:16,337 --> 00:50:17,582
Is Felina coming?

716
00:50:17,607 --> 00:50:18,608
Nah, she's still at work.

717
00:50:20,238 --> 00:50:21,318
So it's just the two of us.

718
00:50:21,343 --> 00:50:22,027
Yup.

719
00:50:22,052 --> 00:50:23,052
Is that alright?

720
00:50:24,554 --> 00:50:26,014
Are you sure you don't want to come?

721
00:50:32,187 --> 00:50:33,272
I want to go home.

722
00:50:34,147 --> 00:50:36,817
Will you ask Christian
to cut the vacation?

723
00:50:46,868 --> 00:50:48,272
How did you find this place?

724
00:50:48,589 --> 00:50:49,488
You know me.

725
00:50:49,513 --> 00:50:50,806
I know a lot of people here.

726
00:50:50,831 --> 00:50:53,741
Just a little bit more and
I'll be the adopted son of Sta. Maria.

727
00:50:55,168 --> 00:50:56,168
Your girlfriend...

728
00:50:57,129 --> 00:50:58,129
What?

729
00:50:59,077 --> 00:51:00,717
She's a little unapproachable, isn't she?

730
00:51:01,758 --> 00:51:03,405
You're calling that "a little"?

731
00:51:04,178 --> 00:51:05,635
She's really unapproachable.

732
00:51:06,138 --> 00:51:07,138
A spoiled brat.

733
00:51:07,537 --> 00:51:08,537
And an only child.

734
00:51:09,182 --> 00:51:10,819
She always wants special treatment.

735
00:51:11,075 --> 00:51:12,327
Don't get mad, okay?

736
00:51:12,352 --> 00:51:13,352
But...

737
00:51:13,562 --> 00:51:15,664
She's a bit arrogant.

738
00:51:15,774 --> 00:51:16,774
You said it.

739
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:18,542
Condescending.

740
00:51:18,567 --> 00:51:19,832
I can feel it, you know?

741
00:51:22,112 --> 00:51:23,112
But you're different.

742
00:51:23,887 --> 00:51:25,679
Though, I'm not sure if...

743
00:51:26,491 --> 00:51:28,000
Finish your question.

744
00:51:28,618 --> 00:51:29,618
Nah.

745
00:51:30,454 --> 00:51:31,538
I got used to it.

746
00:51:32,581 --> 00:51:33,581
At first...

747
00:51:34,053 --> 00:51:35,413
There was always conflict.

748
00:51:36,710 --> 00:51:38,179
But after a while?

749
00:51:38,962 --> 00:51:40,005
What the fuck.

750
00:51:40,255 --> 00:51:41,148
There we go.

751
00:51:41,173 --> 00:51:42,828
That's what I like to hear.

752
00:51:45,202 --> 00:51:46,781
You have another woman, don't you?

753
00:51:48,078 --> 00:51:49,281
Yes, and...

754
00:51:49,306 --> 00:51:50,306
No.

755
00:51:50,447 --> 00:51:52,453
Wow. Is that a riddle?

756
00:51:54,061 --> 00:51:55,061
Another woman, sure.

757
00:51:55,729 --> 00:51:57,172
The mother of my kid.

758
00:51:57,898 --> 00:51:58,898
You have a kid already?

759
00:51:59,816 --> 00:52:00,816
You're separated?

760
00:52:01,818 --> 00:52:03,695
Even before Paolo was born...

761
00:52:04,738 --> 00:52:05,858
we already weren't together.

762
00:52:06,328 --> 00:52:07,773
She has a husband now.

763
00:52:14,758 --> 00:52:16,055
Anyone home?

764
00:52:18,794 --> 00:52:20,226
Anyone home?

765
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:22,046
Who's there?

766
00:52:23,048 --> 00:52:24,414
What do you need?

767
00:52:25,050 --> 00:52:26,461
Good morning.

768
00:52:27,101 --> 00:52:29,898
I went by the guest house
but nobody was around.

769
00:52:30,057 --> 00:52:31,499
Is Leo there?

770
00:52:31,842 --> 00:52:33,358
No. He's out.

771
00:52:33,725 --> 00:52:35,268
Do you know where he went?

772
00:52:36,103 --> 00:52:37,468
No. I don't.

773
00:52:38,939 --> 00:52:40,406
Can I ask you a favor?

774
00:52:41,155 --> 00:52:44,797
Leo told me that he wanted
some sisig from our resort.

775
00:52:44,885 --> 00:52:46,836
Can I ask you to give this to him?

776
00:52:47,343 --> 00:52:48,820
Sure. Give it here.

777
00:52:49,825 --> 00:52:50,825
Thank you so much.

778
00:52:54,121 --> 00:52:55,430
I'm Felina.

779
00:52:55,455 --> 00:52:56,540
What was your name again?

780
00:52:56,565 --> 00:52:57,565
I forgot.

781
00:52:57,728 --> 00:52:59,063
How could you forget my name

782
00:52:59,088 --> 00:53:01,703
when I haven't even given it to you?

783
00:53:02,778 --> 00:53:04,304
Okay.

784
00:53:04,339 --> 00:53:05,508
Janine.

785
00:53:05,911 --> 00:53:07,570
My name is Janine.

786
00:53:08,121 --> 00:53:10,187
You're Christian's girlfriend?

787
00:53:12,764 --> 00:53:15,343
Leo and I were together
with him last night.

788
00:53:15,684 --> 00:53:16,852
We had so much fun.

789
00:53:16,908 --> 00:53:18,835
Too bad. You didn't come.

790
00:53:19,621 --> 00:53:20,747
Your boyfriend's cute.

791
00:53:20,772 --> 00:53:22,078
Lucky you.

792
00:53:27,172 --> 00:53:28,444
Mrs. Elena...

793
00:53:28,469 --> 00:53:32,484
Some girl told me
to give this to your nephew.

794
00:53:34,258 --> 00:53:35,329
Felina.

795
00:53:35,354 --> 00:53:37,679
The girl's name was Felina.

796
00:53:38,586 --> 00:53:40,249
I'll get going then.

797
00:53:47,986 --> 00:53:49,380
Aren't you lucky?

798
00:53:49,485 --> 00:53:50,277
You have a kid

799
00:53:50,302 --> 00:53:51,554
but it's with the mother.

800
00:53:52,709 --> 00:53:53,789
What's so lucky about that?

801
00:53:54,125 --> 00:53:55,991
Because you're free.

802
00:53:56,016 --> 00:53:57,576
Because the mother's taking care of it.

803
00:53:57,639 --> 00:53:59,157
Are you giving child-support?

804
00:53:59,206 --> 00:54:00,206
Of course I do.

805
00:54:01,233 --> 00:54:03,153
It's a good thing your ex
doesn't take advantage.

806
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:06,390
That's what Janine always says.

807
00:54:07,005 --> 00:54:08,005
What do you think?

808
00:54:09,088 --> 00:54:10,088
That's my child.

809
00:54:10,329 --> 00:54:12,078
I have a responsibility.

810
00:54:12,782 --> 00:54:13,782
And what?

811
00:54:14,618 --> 00:54:15,618
And...

812
00:54:15,785 --> 00:54:17,031
I love my son.

813
00:54:17,964 --> 00:54:19,024
Who do you love more, then?

814
00:54:19,049 --> 00:54:20,461
Your son, or Janine?

815
00:54:21,176 --> 00:54:22,811
What kind of question is that?

816
00:54:24,246 --> 00:54:26,039
You know what I think, man?

817
00:54:26,604 --> 00:54:28,273
All those women are the same.

818
00:54:28,298 --> 00:54:29,400
No matter how smart they are,

819
00:54:29,425 --> 00:54:31,276
or how insatiable they are in bed,

820
00:54:31,301 --> 00:54:32,652
they're all replaceable.

821
00:54:32,677 --> 00:54:37,687
Did you know that there's more women
than men here in the Philippines?

822
00:54:38,491 --> 00:54:39,993
But your child is your blood.

823
00:54:40,018 --> 00:54:41,018
Your son is yours.

824
00:54:42,460 --> 00:54:43,920
You fight about this, don't you?

825
00:54:44,515 --> 00:54:45,515
It's okay.

826
00:54:46,773 --> 00:54:48,077
All I'm saying is,

827
00:54:48,102 --> 00:54:49,061
From the very start

828
00:54:49,086 --> 00:54:51,213
you should put women in their place.

829
00:54:51,238 --> 00:54:53,164
Because if you don't?
Fuck, man...

830
00:54:53,414 --> 00:54:55,101
They're going to mess you up.

831
00:54:56,064 --> 00:54:57,544
You know a lot about this, don't you?

832
00:54:57,569 --> 00:54:58,778
Of course. I know it well.

833
00:54:58,803 --> 00:54:59,971
Speaking from experience...

834
00:54:59,996 --> 00:55:02,406
I know every fucking thing
about how women's minds work.

835
00:55:05,335 --> 00:55:06,679
Let's swim.

836
00:55:08,463 --> 00:55:09,983
The water looks good.
And it's too hot!

837
00:55:11,562 --> 00:55:13,062
What are you doing?

838
00:55:13,350 --> 00:55:15,472
Someone might call the cops on you!

839
00:55:15,904 --> 00:55:17,489
Hurry up!
Nobody's here!

840
00:55:17,514 --> 00:55:18,783
This isn't a place where people go!

841
00:55:18,808 --> 00:55:19,808
Come on!

842
00:56:19,909 --> 00:56:22,230
What's the plan tonight?
Around eight o' clock?

843
00:56:22,537 --> 00:56:23,537
Sure.

844
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:25,402
Why don't you just eat here?

845
00:56:25,874 --> 00:56:26,874
We'll see.

846
00:56:27,824 --> 00:56:28,920
I'll tell your aunt

847
00:56:28,945 --> 00:56:30,145
to let you eat here for dinner

848
00:56:30,170 --> 00:56:32,003
so we can go there immediately after.

849
00:56:32,164 --> 00:56:33,164
Alright.

850
00:56:33,236 --> 00:56:34,311
What's up?

851
00:56:34,336 --> 00:56:36,183
Come with us tonight.

852
00:56:37,927 --> 00:56:38,595
I better get going.

853
00:56:38,620 --> 00:56:39,636
Sure.

854
00:56:46,144 --> 00:56:47,144
What's tonight?

855
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:48,699
We're going out.

856
00:56:49,856 --> 00:56:50,957
He's coming?

857
00:56:50,982 --> 00:56:52,308
And his girlfriend.

858
00:56:53,443 --> 00:56:54,816
Girlfriend?

859
00:56:54,944 --> 00:56:55,944
Oh.

860
00:56:56,112 --> 00:56:57,761
The one who went here earlier.

861
00:56:57,900 --> 00:56:59,705
So you met Felina already.

862
00:57:04,746 --> 00:57:05,747
What's your problem?

863
00:57:09,050 --> 00:57:10,960
Why do you hate Leo so much?

864
00:57:12,462 --> 00:57:14,761
What did he ever do to you?

865
00:57:16,341 --> 00:57:18,677
There are some people that you meet...

866
00:57:19,302 --> 00:57:20,910
and you instantly despise them.

867
00:57:22,430 --> 00:57:25,847
Reasons are just
unnecessary for that, Christian.

868
00:57:26,754 --> 00:57:27,838
That's what you call...

869
00:57:27,863 --> 00:57:28,906
a bad attitude.

870
00:57:29,346 --> 00:57:30,817
So who has a bad attitude?

871
00:57:30,842 --> 00:57:31,956
Him or me?

872
00:57:31,981 --> 00:57:32,981
You.

873
00:57:38,571 --> 00:57:40,511
Why did you leave me alone here?

874
00:57:41,950 --> 00:57:43,285
Just a reminder.

875
00:57:43,677 --> 00:57:44,969
I invited you.

876
00:57:45,110 --> 00:57:46,110
You refused.

877
00:57:46,847 --> 00:57:48,014
And now you ask me

878
00:57:48,039 --> 00:57:49,658
why you were left here alone,

879
00:57:49,683 --> 00:57:51,167
while we were out swimming?

880
00:57:56,631 --> 00:57:57,631
So now what,

881
00:57:57,774 --> 00:57:59,693
You enjoy your time more

882
00:57:59,718 --> 00:58:01,444
with that asshole
instead of me?

883
00:58:01,570 --> 00:58:02,570
Correct!

884
00:58:02,703 --> 00:58:04,058
I am enjoying.

885
00:58:04,514 --> 00:58:05,657
Very much.

886
00:58:05,682 --> 00:58:06,682
But for you?

887
00:58:06,933 --> 00:58:08,581
Enjoyment is what you want.

888
00:58:08,727 --> 00:58:09,980
Not what I want.

889
00:58:10,228 --> 00:58:11,454
You always think

890
00:58:11,541 --> 00:58:13,191
everything is about you.

891
00:58:14,023 --> 00:58:16,000
If you don't want to join us tonight.

892
00:58:16,025 --> 00:58:17,025
Fine!

893
00:58:17,444 --> 00:58:18,336
Stay here.

894
00:58:18,361 --> 00:58:20,058
Go on talk to that mute lady.

895
00:58:21,222 --> 00:58:22,983
Not everyone, not even the world

896
00:58:23,008 --> 00:58:25,355
revolve around you.

897
00:58:32,249 --> 00:58:33,560
Christian was surprised, actually.

898
00:58:33,585 --> 00:58:36,730
He didn't expect that there are
a lot of hidden beaches here in Sta. Maria.

899
00:58:37,263 --> 00:58:39,583
There's still a lot of good places
left to visit, you know.

900
00:58:40,614 --> 00:58:42,657
It's very fortunate for our guests

901
00:58:42,682 --> 00:58:45,370
that you like wandering around, Leo.

902
00:58:45,673 --> 00:58:47,591
Leo can literally run for councilor

903
00:58:47,616 --> 00:58:49,284
here in Sta. Maria

904
00:58:49,309 --> 00:58:51,605
because he knows so many
people around here.

905
00:58:54,347 --> 00:58:55,377
I got it, Auntie.

906
00:58:55,402 --> 00:58:56,402
Thank you.

907
00:58:56,858 --> 00:58:58,376
Here, try this.

908
00:58:58,401 --> 00:58:59,839
It's Auntie Elena's specialty.

909
00:59:00,182 --> 00:59:01,191
Pochero.

910
00:59:01,216 --> 00:59:02,370
Right, Auntie?

911
00:59:03,239 --> 00:59:04,941
Where are you guys going, anyway?

912
00:59:06,075 --> 00:59:07,552
We're going drinking.

913
00:59:07,677 --> 00:59:10,096
- Jeez, Leo.
- Uncle Rading...

914
00:59:10,121 --> 00:59:13,683
I just want to make
my new friends' trip here memorable.

915
00:59:13,832 --> 00:59:16,089
Well, you can't beat that.

916
00:59:16,336 --> 00:59:17,670
Just take it easy. Okay?

917
00:59:18,254 --> 00:59:20,628
Don't worry, Mister.
I can handle my alcohol.

918
00:59:21,424 --> 00:59:22,424
You coming?

919
00:59:23,441 --> 00:59:25,151
- She's not going.
- Of course.

920
00:59:25,428 --> 00:59:26,785
You invited me.

921
00:59:27,300 --> 00:59:29,001
Of course. How could I not?

922
00:59:29,265 --> 00:59:31,847
I can handle my alcohol too.

923
00:59:34,713 --> 00:59:36,370
This night is gonna be fun.

924
00:59:36,564 --> 00:59:37,564
Come. Let's eat.

925
00:59:42,821 --> 00:59:44,672
We'll be going now, Uncle.

926
00:59:44,697 --> 00:59:45,814
Leo.

927
00:59:45,839 --> 00:59:47,091
Take it easy. Okay?

928
00:59:47,116 --> 00:59:48,478
- I got it, Uncle.
- See you.

929
01:00:21,693 --> 01:00:23,754
You're late!

930
01:00:26,447 --> 01:00:27,447
Hey!

931
01:00:27,615 --> 01:00:28,903
You're here too!

932
01:00:29,238 --> 01:00:30,660
You two met already?

933
01:00:31,077 --> 01:00:32,077
Yup.

934
01:00:32,257 --> 01:00:34,527
I told her to give you
the sisig that you wanted.

935
01:00:34,706 --> 01:00:35,934
What sisig?

936
01:00:36,684 --> 01:00:38,351
The one I brought to the house.

937
01:00:38,376 --> 01:00:40,574
I didn't receive any at all.

938
01:00:41,379 --> 01:00:42,547
I gave it to you. Remember?

939
01:00:42,572 --> 01:00:44,801
I even told you to give it to him
once he comes home.

940
01:00:45,091 --> 01:00:47,309
Yeah. I gave it to his aunt.

941
01:00:47,635 --> 01:00:49,621
Alright. Okay.
I know what happened now.

942
01:00:50,388 --> 01:00:51,389
That's not okay...

943
01:00:51,639 --> 01:00:53,242
I even requested that
at the resort kitchen.

944
01:00:53,266 --> 01:00:54,910
Then what? Where did it go?

945
01:00:54,935 --> 01:00:56,932
Let it go.

946
01:00:57,353 --> 01:00:59,289
We should be happy tonight.

947
01:00:59,314 --> 01:01:02,004
It's embarrassing
for our new friends. Okay?

948
01:01:02,442 --> 01:01:03,442
Alright?

949
01:01:04,736 --> 01:01:07,434
What do you want to drink first?

950
01:01:07,906 --> 01:01:09,199
Hard or beer?

951
01:01:09,318 --> 01:01:11,573
Are you trying to get us wasted?

952
01:01:12,472 --> 01:01:14,625
We're in a vacation, aren't we?

953
01:01:14,787 --> 01:01:17,184
We're supposed to be getting wasted.

954
01:01:22,045 --> 01:01:24,410
One, two, three!

955
01:01:34,599 --> 01:01:36,479
Christian, I think Janine
is trying to cheat us.

956
01:01:36,504 --> 01:01:38,006
She hasn't downed her shot yet.

957
01:01:56,805 --> 01:01:58,098
Your glass is empty.

958
01:01:59,082 --> 01:02:00,082
Later.

959
01:02:00,833 --> 01:02:01,833
Come on.

960
01:02:02,710 --> 01:02:03,710
I will. Later.

961
01:02:04,087 --> 01:02:05,647
Don't force her if she doesn't want to.

962
01:02:06,005 --> 01:02:07,005
You okay?

963
01:02:08,841 --> 01:02:10,921
I think I should be the one
asking you that question.

964
01:02:11,886 --> 01:02:13,114
Are you still okay?

965
01:02:13,629 --> 01:02:15,204
You're not married yet, are you?

966
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:21,520
Why not?

967
01:02:21,562 --> 01:02:24,348
Watch yourself, you idiot.
You're meddling too much again.

968
01:02:24,373 --> 01:02:25,848
I'm just asking.

969
01:02:25,984 --> 01:02:27,614
We don't have any plans yet.

970
01:02:28,300 --> 01:02:30,845
But you're living together, right?

971
01:02:32,596 --> 01:02:33,596
Yes.

972
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:36,577
But living in doesn't mean

973
01:02:36,992 --> 01:02:38,824
that it'll end up in marriage.

974
01:02:39,590 --> 01:02:42,083
- I see... You don't want to.
- No.

975
01:02:42,250 --> 01:02:43,489
We don't want to.

976
01:02:44,877 --> 01:02:45,877
But...

977
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:47,647
are you planning to have babies?

978
01:02:47,672 --> 01:02:49,020
You can do that, can't you?

979
01:02:49,048 --> 01:02:50,356
Right, babes?

980
01:02:50,717 --> 01:02:53,177
Marriage has nothing to do
with having children.

981
01:02:53,845 --> 01:02:55,207
Yes it does!

982
01:02:55,388 --> 01:02:57,176
Christian already has a kid.

983
01:02:58,614 --> 01:03:00,158
Really? You got a kid already?

984
01:03:00,893 --> 01:03:02,840
You got pregnant in that kind of set-up?

985
01:03:03,015 --> 01:03:04,825
She's not the mother of my kid.

986
01:03:04,956 --> 01:03:06,666
You fucking idiot.

987
01:03:06,691 --> 01:03:08,840
Does Janine look like
she already got pregnant?

988
01:03:09,152 --> 01:03:10,598
I'm just asking.

989
01:03:11,612 --> 01:03:13,129
That's actually so fun.

990
01:03:13,483 --> 01:03:15,360
What a happy family.

991
01:03:45,184 --> 01:03:46,598
Christian.

992
01:03:52,695 --> 01:03:54,496
Aren't we going home yet?

993
01:03:54,530 --> 01:03:55,590
Why?

994
01:03:55,615 --> 01:03:57,965
What do you mean "why"?
It's almost midnight.

995
01:03:57,990 --> 01:04:01,317
That's what I'm saying.
It's still early.

996
01:04:02,270 --> 01:04:04,724
I'm irritated.

997
01:04:04,749 --> 01:04:06,317
I'm sleepy.

998
01:04:06,342 --> 01:04:08,352
Let's go home.

999
01:04:08,377 --> 01:04:11,564
You're exactly like my aunt
who grew up to be an old maiden.

1000
01:04:11,589 --> 01:04:14,067
You get surly with loud music.

1001
01:04:14,092 --> 01:04:15,651
Why don't you loosen up?

1002
01:04:15,676 --> 01:04:17,317
This is a vacation.

1003
01:04:18,679 --> 01:04:20,723
Because if you were just going
to act that way...

1004
01:04:20,765 --> 01:04:22,371
then you shouldn't have come.

1005
01:04:23,059 --> 01:04:24,059
I'm leaving.

1006
01:04:27,242 --> 01:04:28,769
You're going already?

1007
01:04:29,980 --> 01:04:31,415
Yeah. I'll go ahead.

1008
01:04:31,526 --> 01:04:32,877
I'm going back.

1009
01:04:32,902 --> 01:04:34,004
But you're not drunk yet. Right?

1010
01:04:34,028 --> 01:04:35,548
You've only drank so little, you know.

1011
01:04:36,823 --> 01:04:38,216
I'm leaving.

1012
01:04:38,241 --> 01:04:41,260
It's dark, you know.
You might trip on something.

1013
01:04:41,285 --> 01:04:43,082
I can handle myself.

1014
01:04:43,788 --> 01:04:45,640
Just leave her be.

1015
01:04:45,665 --> 01:04:47,895
Let her do what she wants.

1016
01:04:49,961 --> 01:04:51,379
Take care, sister!

1017
01:05:47,695 --> 01:05:48,695
You okay, man?

1018
01:05:49,542 --> 01:05:51,340
I'm good. You?

1019
01:05:51,647 --> 01:05:53,887
Come by my place
if you're not sleepy yet.

1020
01:05:55,151 --> 01:05:56,151
We still drinking?

1021
01:05:56,235 --> 01:05:57,235
We're partying.

1022
01:06:33,189 --> 01:06:34,918
Are you sure you're still okay?

1023
01:06:36,817 --> 01:06:38,246
Do I look wasted to you?

1024
01:06:39,809 --> 01:06:43,887
I'm just worried
you might come home crawling,

1025
01:06:43,912 --> 01:06:46,039
and I'll get another scolding
from your woman.

1026
01:06:59,864 --> 01:07:01,715
Are you really trying to get me wasted?

1027
01:07:01,740 --> 01:07:03,450
Didn't you say you were a badass?

1028
01:07:33,374 --> 01:07:35,374
What are you really planning
to do with your woman?

1029
01:07:36,335 --> 01:07:37,335
Nothing, yet.

1030
01:07:37,628 --> 01:07:38,628
I don't know.

1031
01:07:39,422 --> 01:07:41,090
I don't even know
what she plans on doing.

1032
01:07:41,757 --> 01:07:43,184
What do you want?

1033
01:07:43,718 --> 01:07:46,176
Why are we talking about this, anyway?

1034
01:07:47,405 --> 01:07:50,616
Nothing. Your muscles are too...

1035
01:07:50,641 --> 01:07:51,833
Relax.

1036
01:07:51,858 --> 01:07:52,859
Too what?

1037
01:07:55,730 --> 01:07:57,934
Your muscles are too tense.

1038
01:07:58,838 --> 01:08:00,269
Just tired, maybe.

1039
01:08:03,821 --> 01:08:04,821
What,

1040
01:08:05,131 --> 01:08:05,715
Leo?!

1041
01:08:05,756 --> 01:08:07,341
- Relax. Relax.
- Get off my...

1042
01:08:07,366 --> 01:08:08,284
Look at your muscles.

1043
01:08:08,326 --> 01:08:09,410
They're too tense.

1044
01:08:09,435 --> 01:08:10,803
Just relax.

1045
01:08:10,828 --> 01:08:11,828
What are you doing?

1046
01:08:12,455 --> 01:08:14,494
I'm giving you a massage.
Isn't it obvious?

1047
01:08:14,749 --> 01:08:15,749
How is it?

1048
01:08:33,392 --> 01:08:34,392
Hey...

1049
01:08:35,210 --> 01:08:36,211
That might be...

1050
01:08:38,193 --> 01:08:40,237
- Let it be.
- You're an idiot.

1051
01:12:16,882 --> 01:12:17,841
So?

1052
01:12:17,866 --> 01:12:18,985
Do you want to do it?

1053
01:12:19,201 --> 01:12:21,235
Tell me, and I'll stop.

1054
01:14:42,428 --> 01:14:45,431
So how was your party
last night? Was it fun?

1055
01:14:45,873 --> 01:14:46,916
It was okay.

1056
01:14:48,517 --> 01:14:51,120
I hope Leo didn't
get you too drunk.

1057
01:14:51,145 --> 01:14:54,130
You know him.
Sometimes he's too stubborn.

1058
01:14:55,707 --> 01:14:59,753
Mister Rading, do you know of
any mechanics nearby?

1059
01:14:59,778 --> 01:15:01,209
Sure. His name is Kalo.

1060
01:15:01,996 --> 01:15:03,216
Where is his shop?

1061
01:15:03,799 --> 01:15:04,883
He doesn't have a shop.

1062
01:15:04,908 --> 01:15:07,548
He just works in his house
if there were any cars that need fixing.

1063
01:15:09,288 --> 01:15:10,826
Why? What's wrong?

1064
01:15:12,669 --> 01:15:14,101
Yesterday, on our way home,

1065
01:15:14,141 --> 01:15:16,872
I noticed that the brakes
weren't biting as much.

1066
01:15:17,212 --> 01:15:18,292
I just wanted to make sure.

1067
01:15:21,274 --> 01:15:24,903
I thought you had it fixed
before we went here?

1068
01:15:24,928 --> 01:15:26,238
Yes, I did.

1069
01:15:26,341 --> 01:15:28,792
That's why I was wondering
why it was acting up.

1070
01:15:28,974 --> 01:15:31,576
I even asked Leo
if he knew anything about cars...

1071
01:15:31,709 --> 01:15:33,077
He didn't want to meddle,

1072
01:15:33,102 --> 01:15:35,262
and told me it was dangerous
because it was the brakes.

1073
01:15:35,898 --> 01:15:39,216
You should only let a mechanic
take a look on it.

1074
01:15:40,028 --> 01:15:42,114
You can only be so sure.

1075
01:15:42,446 --> 01:15:44,246
Especially when your
trip back is a long one.

1076
01:15:47,080 --> 01:15:50,083
But we can still use the car
for the trip home, right?

1077
01:15:51,246 --> 01:15:52,658
If you want,

1078
01:15:52,729 --> 01:15:54,317
I can accompany you to Kalo's place.

1079
01:15:54,708 --> 01:15:58,068
I'll tell him to fix your car first...

1080
01:15:58,212 --> 01:16:00,506
if ever there's a bit lined up for him.

1081
01:17:33,056 --> 01:17:34,056
Hey.

1082
01:17:34,253 --> 01:17:35,646
Why are you alone?

1083
01:17:35,851 --> 01:17:36,785
Where's Chris?

1084
01:17:36,810 --> 01:17:39,788
Out. He brought the car
to a mechanic with Mister Rading.

1085
01:17:39,813 --> 01:17:43,052
I see. He told me something
about the brakes last night.

1086
01:17:44,672 --> 01:17:45,672
You okay here?

1087
01:17:46,612 --> 01:17:47,972
Do you want me to
keep you company?

1088
01:17:48,697 --> 01:17:50,107
No. I'm fine.

1089
01:17:50,824 --> 01:17:52,718
You'll be having a hard time.

1090
01:17:52,821 --> 01:17:54,941
Auntie Elena is not exactly
easy to talk to, you know.

1091
01:17:55,621 --> 01:17:56,841
That's a problem.

1092
01:17:58,040 --> 01:18:00,537
No, thanks. Your girlfriend
might look for you.

1093
01:18:01,594 --> 01:18:02,895
That's the problem?

1094
01:18:02,970 --> 01:18:05,200
She's still at the resort.
Being a slave.

1095
01:18:05,959 --> 01:18:07,001
Ah, I know.

1096
01:18:07,026 --> 01:18:08,026
I know. Come with me.

1097
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:09,800
Where?

1098
01:18:10,218 --> 01:18:13,013
I'll take you to where I took
your boyfriend the other day.

1099
01:18:13,180 --> 01:18:14,966
And what are we supposed to do there?

1100
01:18:15,307 --> 01:18:17,818
Even better than staring
at your laptop all day.

1101
01:18:19,261 --> 01:18:20,621
I'll just get changed.
Wait for me.

1102
01:18:20,646 --> 01:18:22,162
I'm fine here.

1103
01:18:24,634 --> 01:18:26,833
You're going to waste
another day on that?

1104
01:18:27,884 --> 01:18:29,583
Just come with me.

1105
01:19:09,115 --> 01:19:11,417
Do you believe me now?

1106
01:19:11,442 --> 01:19:12,442
It's beautiful. Right?

1107
01:19:13,374 --> 01:19:15,797
There's still a lot of good
spots we could go to.

1108
01:19:15,822 --> 01:19:17,949
But the problem with you
is that you don't believe me.

1109
01:19:20,493 --> 01:19:21,493
Come.

1110
01:19:22,328 --> 01:19:23,412
Let's go swimming.

1111
01:20:05,371 --> 01:20:07,701
Do you regret coming with me?

1112
01:20:07,726 --> 01:20:09,412
This place is nice. Right?

1113
01:20:09,538 --> 01:20:10,894
There's privacy.

1114
01:20:11,878 --> 01:20:13,982
Is this where you brought Christian?

1115
01:20:14,194 --> 01:20:15,235
Yeah.

1116
01:20:15,298 --> 01:20:16,980
And he enjoyed his time here, you know.

1117
01:20:18,145 --> 01:20:19,479
I guess so.

1118
01:20:34,942 --> 01:20:36,263
Are you done swimming?

1119
01:20:36,685 --> 01:20:38,028
It's too hot.

1120
01:20:38,053 --> 01:20:40,599
That's why we're supposed to go swimming.
Because it's hot.

1121
01:20:41,621 --> 01:20:43,414
You know... I noticed something about you.

1122
01:20:44,835 --> 01:20:46,295
You're not very flexible, are you?

1123
01:20:48,039 --> 01:20:49,332
What do you mean?

1124
01:20:49,782 --> 01:20:52,226
You do what you want.
And only what you want.

1125
01:20:52,251 --> 01:20:55,029
You don't know how to adapt
or to go along with people.

1126
01:20:55,054 --> 01:20:56,296
That's not true.

1127
01:20:56,438 --> 01:20:57,438
Really?

1128
01:20:59,638 --> 01:21:00,934
How can you say that

1129
01:21:00,959 --> 01:21:03,002
when you don't even know me?

1130
01:21:03,262 --> 01:21:04,764
You don't know that.

1131
01:21:05,021 --> 01:21:07,021
I know how to read people.

1132
01:21:07,921 --> 01:21:10,465
Good for you, then!

1133
01:21:10,496 --> 01:21:12,890
I know what's running on their minds.

1134
01:21:12,915 --> 01:21:14,941
I know what they want,
and what they need.

1135
01:21:15,483 --> 01:21:16,483
Wow.

1136
01:21:16,508 --> 01:21:17,508
Did you hear me?

1137
01:21:17,860 --> 01:21:20,279
What they want.
And what they need.

1138
01:21:20,999 --> 01:21:22,631
You want a lot of things.

1139
01:21:23,084 --> 01:21:25,284
But I know that there are
far more things that you need.

1140
01:21:26,202 --> 01:21:27,202
Sure.

1141
01:21:28,321 --> 01:21:29,716
Of course. It's true.

1142
01:21:29,787 --> 01:21:32,099
You're too careful.

1143
01:21:32,124 --> 01:21:33,591
You're too scared.

1144
01:21:34,335 --> 01:21:37,546
Me? Too careful and too scared?

1145
01:21:37,571 --> 01:21:38,571
Obviously.

1146
01:21:39,740 --> 01:21:40,942
You know, Leo...

1147
01:21:40,967 --> 01:21:43,903
I wouldn't get this position
in the insurance company

1148
01:21:43,928 --> 01:21:46,904
if I was too careful and scared.

1149
01:21:47,575 --> 01:21:50,056
Life is different from work, you know.

1150
01:21:52,478 --> 01:21:55,466
There's only a few people
in this world that I'm scared of.

1151
01:21:56,415 --> 01:21:57,683
And believe me...

1152
01:21:57,770 --> 01:21:59,521
You're not one of them.

1153
01:22:02,478 --> 01:22:03,478
We're going back.

1154
01:22:03,503 --> 01:22:04,713
You want to go home already?

1155
01:22:05,556 --> 01:22:06,556
It depends...

1156
01:22:06,979 --> 01:22:08,490
where you're taking me.

1157
01:22:36,355 --> 01:22:37,755
Do you want to have snacks first?

1158
01:22:37,780 --> 01:22:38,823
Come on. Eat with me.

1159
01:22:39,775 --> 01:22:40,775
No, thanks.

1160
01:22:40,818 --> 01:22:42,194
I'll just take a bath.

1161
01:22:42,341 --> 01:22:44,815
I feel like I need to rinse
after swimming in the sea.

1162
01:22:46,490 --> 01:22:47,490
Take a seat.

1163
01:22:47,515 --> 01:22:48,955
Why are you standing there?

1164
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:52,204
I'll be quick.

1165
01:23:08,763 --> 01:23:09,763
You still okay?

1166
01:23:16,896 --> 01:23:18,416
Whatever it is that you're thinking...

1167
01:23:19,357 --> 01:23:20,357
You're wrong.

1168
01:23:21,538 --> 01:23:23,309
Why? What am I thinking?

1169
01:23:24,044 --> 01:23:26,373
I thought you were good
at reading people?

1170
01:23:27,365 --> 01:23:28,365
Sure.

1171
01:23:28,692 --> 01:23:31,451
I knew from the very start
that you're repulsed by me.

1172
01:23:31,491 --> 01:23:32,491
That's true.

1173
01:23:32,828 --> 01:23:34,240
I don't like you.

1174
01:23:34,739 --> 01:23:35,739
Why?

1175
01:23:36,864 --> 01:23:38,514
Because I don't trust you.

1176
01:23:40,252 --> 01:23:41,587
Not because I'm scared of you.

1177
01:23:43,508 --> 01:23:44,960
But because I despise

1178
01:23:45,024 --> 01:23:48,252
how you're having the time of your life
while you manipulate people.

1179
01:23:49,095 --> 01:23:50,095
Wow.

1180
01:23:50,638 --> 01:23:52,138
It's like I'm evil.

1181
01:23:53,794 --> 01:23:56,021
What are you trying to do
with me and Christian?

1182
01:23:57,686 --> 01:24:00,439
What are you trying to prove?

1183
01:24:01,232 --> 01:24:02,232
Nothing.

1184
01:24:02,316 --> 01:24:04,318
I'm not even doing anything.

1185
01:24:04,904 --> 01:24:05,951
Why?

1186
01:24:05,976 --> 01:24:07,771
What do you think I'm doing?

1187
01:24:10,950 --> 01:24:12,190
What is it that you truly want?

1188
01:24:13,526 --> 01:24:15,013
What do you think of yourself?

1189
01:24:15,474 --> 01:24:17,816
Do you think you can just
take anything you want?

1190
01:24:18,874 --> 01:24:20,376
You're wrong.

1191
01:24:20,835 --> 01:24:23,587
I don't take anything
that isn't willingly given.

1192
01:24:24,588 --> 01:24:25,631
If you don't want it...

1193
01:24:26,048 --> 01:24:27,048
sure.

1194
01:24:27,633 --> 01:24:29,393
If you don't like it...
that's fine, as well.

1195
01:24:29,885 --> 01:24:32,138
Just tell me. That's how I am.

1196
01:24:36,583 --> 01:24:38,159
I already have a partner.

1197
01:24:38,936 --> 01:24:39,936
I know.

1198
01:24:40,651 --> 01:24:41,819
But is that even a reason?

1199
01:24:43,190 --> 01:24:44,552
A reason for what?

1200
01:24:45,078 --> 01:24:46,538
For you not to desire it.

1201
01:24:47,801 --> 01:24:50,221
Do you even know
what I want to do to you?

1202
01:24:56,154 --> 01:24:57,955
Has he ever done that to you?

1203
01:27:00,286 --> 01:27:01,845
I knew it.

1204
01:27:01,870 --> 01:27:03,070
I've known you from the start.

1205
01:27:03,716 --> 01:27:05,831
Do you do that to your boyfriend?

1206
01:27:06,876 --> 01:27:08,036
That's none of your business.

1207
01:27:08,447 --> 01:27:09,972
You're too sensitive.

1208
01:27:10,885 --> 01:27:12,300
Was it good, miss?

1209
01:27:14,883 --> 01:27:18,012
There's a lot more people
far better than you.

1210
01:27:19,221 --> 01:27:20,221
Asshole.

1211
01:27:21,690 --> 01:27:22,690
Okay.

1212
01:29:48,704 --> 01:29:50,013
It took so long.

1213
01:29:50,038 --> 01:29:53,834
We waited because Kalo
had some work lined up for today.

1214
01:29:56,420 --> 01:29:58,047
We thought it would only take a minute.

1215
01:29:58,072 --> 01:30:01,526
Little did we know we were
going to wait until this afternoon.

1216
01:30:02,634 --> 01:30:04,887
Don't worry about it.
The brakes got repaired.

1217
01:30:06,638 --> 01:30:08,015
Yes. We already ate.

1218
01:30:08,182 --> 01:30:12,416
But it would be nice if
you could prepare some snacks.

1219
01:30:13,937 --> 01:30:15,105
Where's Janine?

1220
01:30:29,161 --> 01:30:30,161
Jan?

1221
01:30:38,587 --> 01:30:40,255
I have to tell you something.

1222
01:30:45,093 --> 01:30:48,534
I don't know how you'll react, but...

1223
01:30:50,099 --> 01:30:51,767
I just want to be honest.

1224
01:30:52,267 --> 01:30:53,268
And?

1225
01:31:03,320 --> 01:31:04,320
Christian...

1226
01:31:07,616 --> 01:31:08,867
I don't know if...

1227
01:31:12,106 --> 01:31:13,106
If...

1228
01:31:13,474 --> 01:31:14,955
If I still love you.

1229
01:31:16,356 --> 01:31:17,356
And?

1230
01:31:21,213 --> 01:31:24,885
I am tired of forcing myself
between Marla and your son.

1231
01:31:27,845 --> 01:31:29,002
I can't do it anymore.

1232
01:31:30,639 --> 01:31:32,291
I already knew that.

1233
01:31:33,100 --> 01:31:35,362
I can't do anything about that anymore.

1234
01:31:43,110 --> 01:31:44,541
Do you still love her?

1235
01:31:46,113 --> 01:31:47,698
She's the mother of my child.

1236
01:31:56,123 --> 01:31:57,123
And me?

1237
01:31:59,084 --> 01:32:00,682
Do you still love me?

1238
01:32:02,462 --> 01:32:04,339
That's why we're here. Aren't we?

1239
01:32:06,008 --> 01:32:07,384
To fix things.

1240
01:32:16,268 --> 01:32:17,870
Christian, I...

1241
01:32:19,646 --> 01:32:21,273
I did it with him today.

1242
01:32:28,572 --> 01:32:32,367
I knew what he wanted to happen, but...

1243
01:32:35,662 --> 01:32:37,122
I allowed him to.

1244
01:32:42,023 --> 01:32:43,389
Where did they go?

1245
01:32:46,048 --> 01:32:47,424
Were they gone for long?

1246
01:32:50,765 --> 01:32:52,864
Did he bring her to the guest house?

1247
01:32:54,364 --> 01:32:57,367
The reason is that your nephew
is like a bitch in heat.

1248
01:32:57,392 --> 01:33:02,600
Even a cold fucking corpse
wouldn't stand a chance!

1249
01:33:06,610 --> 01:33:07,611
Did he force you?

1250
01:33:09,529 --> 01:33:10,529
No.

1251
01:33:16,620 --> 01:33:19,790
I'm sorry, Christian.
If I had to tell you this.

1252
01:33:22,542 --> 01:33:24,920
But I just really wanted
to be honest with you.

1253
01:33:26,380 --> 01:33:27,923
He didn't force me.

1254
01:33:29,800 --> 01:33:31,717
I liked what happened between us.

1255
01:33:35,305 --> 01:33:37,224
He's a very stimulating man.

1256
01:33:44,064 --> 01:33:45,440
We're going home tomorrow.

1257
01:33:48,190 --> 01:33:49,190
Alright.

1258
01:33:50,070 --> 01:33:51,279
We're leaving early.

1259
01:33:52,614 --> 01:33:54,366
Let's just have breakfast
on the way home.

1260
01:33:59,921 --> 01:34:03,560
May I ask why you cut
your vacation short?

1261
01:34:04,751 --> 01:34:07,671
We just really need to go back to Manila.

1262
01:34:08,380 --> 01:34:10,048
There's an emergency at work,

1263
01:34:10,277 --> 01:34:12,446
and Janine still has
a lot of things she needs to do.

1264
01:34:13,701 --> 01:34:15,870
Does Sir Ronnie know about this already?

1265
01:34:16,571 --> 01:34:18,146
Don't worry.

1266
01:34:18,566 --> 01:34:21,695
I'll call him later and explain.

1267
01:34:22,360 --> 01:34:23,360
Alright, then.

1268
01:34:23,570 --> 01:34:24,570
Thank you.

1269
01:34:24,809 --> 01:34:25,977
I'll have to say good night.

1270
01:34:26,273 --> 01:34:27,593
We still have to pack our things.

1271
01:35:44,851 --> 01:35:45,851
What's up?

1272
01:35:46,279 --> 01:35:47,591
What happened?

1273
01:35:47,889 --> 01:35:49,498
We're leaving tomorrow.

1274
01:35:49,523 --> 01:35:51,643
I thought you guys were going
to stay here for a week?

1275
01:35:52,025 --> 01:35:53,902
You were only here for four days.

1276
01:35:53,927 --> 01:35:55,167
Did something happen in Manila?

1277
01:35:56,488 --> 01:35:58,715
Fuck, don't tell me you're fighting again.

1278
01:35:58,740 --> 01:36:00,384
You guys weren't
together for the whole day.

1279
01:36:00,409 --> 01:36:01,449
And you're still fighting?

1280
01:36:02,238 --> 01:36:03,632
Why did you do that?

1281
01:36:03,829 --> 01:36:04,829
Do what?

1282
01:36:05,314 --> 01:36:07,140
She admitted you were together.

1283
01:36:07,165 --> 01:36:08,583
She told me what you did to her.

1284
01:36:09,647 --> 01:36:10,647
Admitted?

1285
01:36:10,672 --> 01:36:13,810
Isn't saying "admitted" means
that someone did something wrong?

1286
01:36:14,381 --> 01:36:15,833
She wanted it too.

1287
01:36:15,995 --> 01:36:17,513
Chris, you know me.

1288
01:36:17,592 --> 01:36:20,435
If they don't want to, fine.
If it's okay, then okay!

1289
01:36:21,680 --> 01:36:23,560
What was it?
Did she tell you that I forced her?

1290
01:36:24,057 --> 01:36:25,057
No.

1291
01:36:25,142 --> 01:36:26,873
Then there you go.

1292
01:36:26,984 --> 01:36:28,419
What's the problem with that?

1293
01:36:28,562 --> 01:36:29,938
She wanted it.
She needed it.

1294
01:36:29,963 --> 01:36:31,702
So I gave it to her.
Because I wanted it too.

1295
01:36:31,727 --> 01:36:32,536
Clear?

1296
01:36:32,561 --> 01:36:33,921
You know that she's my girlfriend.

1297
01:36:33,946 --> 01:36:34,803
I know!

1298
01:36:34,887 --> 01:36:36,503
That's fucking nothing!

1299
01:36:36,528 --> 01:36:38,713
It happened because it happened, Chris.

1300
01:36:38,738 --> 01:36:41,303
It was the right time
and the right place.

1301
01:36:41,695 --> 01:36:43,135
Don't take it too fucking seriously.

1302
01:36:43,160 --> 01:36:44,319
That was just lust!

1303
01:36:46,288 --> 01:36:47,414
You didn't even respect...

1304
01:36:47,439 --> 01:36:48,439
Respect?

1305
01:36:48,682 --> 01:36:49,641
For fuck's sake, Chris.

1306
01:36:49,666 --> 01:36:50,876
What did I tell you?

1307
01:36:51,001 --> 01:36:52,436
That was just lust!

1308
01:36:52,461 --> 01:36:53,895
How about you, then?

1309
01:36:53,920 --> 01:36:56,225
Did you admit what we did to her?

1310
01:36:57,398 --> 01:36:58,900
Do you think that means anything?

1311
01:36:58,925 --> 01:37:00,444
Do you think Janine is going to be happy

1312
01:37:00,468 --> 01:37:02,554
once she knows what we did

1313
01:37:02,579 --> 01:37:03,779
and what I did to you?

1314
01:37:05,724 --> 01:37:06,724
Fuck!

1315
01:37:06,855 --> 01:37:08,366
That's your problem.

1316
01:37:08,740 --> 01:37:10,584
You fucking rich brats.

1317
01:37:10,609 --> 01:37:12,236
We're all the same.

1318
01:37:12,350 --> 01:37:14,499
You spoiled fucks are
only ahead by a few baths,

1319
01:37:14,524 --> 01:37:16,526
but we're all the fucking same.

1320
01:37:17,001 --> 01:37:18,920
Why don't you just
go back to your woman,

1321
01:37:18,945 --> 01:37:20,405
and give her a good fuck?

1322
01:37:20,697 --> 01:37:23,701
But I think you're better
with men than with women.

1323
01:37:33,482 --> 01:37:35,415
What the fuck are you still doing here?

1324
01:37:40,538 --> 01:37:42,428
Screw you.

1325
01:37:43,261 --> 01:37:44,261
Son of a bitch.

1326
01:37:45,513 --> 01:37:46,513
Son of a bitch.

1327
01:37:50,852 --> 01:37:51,852
Son of a bitch!

1328
01:38:18,943 --> 01:38:23,902
Thank you so much for taking care of us.

1329
01:38:33,431 --> 01:38:35,183
We'll be going, Mister Rading.

1330
01:38:37,021 --> 01:38:38,717
Take care of yourselves, okay?

1331
01:39:08,995 --> 01:39:10,397
Where can he be?

1332
01:39:12,183 --> 01:39:13,503
He didn't have any breakfast yet?

1333
01:39:14,060 --> 01:39:15,060
What a miracle.

1334
01:39:15,849 --> 01:39:17,794
It's almost noon already

1335
01:39:18,367 --> 01:39:22,857
and your bastard of a nephew
hasn't looked for food yet.

1336
01:39:25,071 --> 01:39:26,114
Leo?

1337
01:39:28,325 --> 01:39:29,325
Leo.

1338
01:39:33,121 --> 01:39:34,121
Leo...
