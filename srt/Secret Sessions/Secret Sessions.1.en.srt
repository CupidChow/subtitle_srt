1
00:00:22,158 --> 00:00:27,413
Calo’s turning eight soon. I didn’t even
get to attend his birthday last year.

2
00:00:27,915 --> 00:00:30,196
Are you feeling guilt over your absence?

3
00:00:32,097 --> 00:00:36,310
Can I even feel guilty?
He’s not even my kid.

4
00:00:39,157 --> 00:00:41,583
You’ve been there for
more than half of his life.

5
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:45,975
And you love Calo, and we both know
that he loves you too.

6
00:00:46,787 --> 00:00:49,665
I’m sure he knows that you and his mom
can’t be in the same room.

7
00:00:50,093 --> 00:00:52,527
He’s smart, surely he understands.

8
00:00:52,967 --> 00:00:54,093
You’re right, Doc.

9
00:00:57,917 --> 00:00:58,918
Just call me Eric.

10
00:00:59,872 --> 00:01:04,730
Eric, you’re just letting me
win out of pity.

11
00:01:06,777 --> 00:01:11,172
Nah. If I won, would it
make you feel better?

12
00:01:13,985 --> 00:01:16,510
You win. I’ll go now.

13
00:01:16,745 --> 00:01:19,754
- Thank you. I’ll see you soon.
- Okay.

14
00:01:35,336 --> 00:01:36,420
Hon?

15
00:01:37,673 --> 00:01:40,987
I’m also done here.
I’ll see you at home.

16
00:01:41,867 --> 00:01:42,867
Okay.

17
00:01:42,892 --> 00:01:43,977
I love you.

18
00:02:06,653 --> 00:02:07,653
Wait.

19
00:02:15,548 --> 00:02:17,341
Can you get me that vase?

20
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:27,110
I'm so lucky with
my future husband...

21
00:02:27,723 --> 00:02:29,058
Handsome...

22
00:02:29,975 --> 00:02:32,488
sweet, and easy to boss around.

23
00:02:32,763 --> 00:02:36,493
I’m luckier with my fiancée,

24
00:02:36,855 --> 00:02:42,442
she promised she’d have everything unpacked
before I got home.

25
00:02:42,489 --> 00:02:43,489
Hmm?

26
00:02:45,496 --> 00:02:47,373
I was swamped at the office.

27
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:51,324
I had to keep an eye on the IT team
and the new hires.

28
00:02:51,349 --> 00:02:53,815
Oh! I haven’t cooked yet...

29
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,468
That’s why I brought dinner.
I saw that coming.

30
00:02:58,945 --> 00:03:00,071
Really?

31
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,624
My hero!

32
00:03:05,107 --> 00:03:07,846
So, you were saying? Work stress?

33
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:11,523
Yeah. It’s manageable...
of course, it’s me we’re talking about.

34
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,278
- I’m luckier compared to others there.
- Oh?

35
00:03:15,577 --> 00:03:18,522
Yeah. We have this new hire,

36
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:20,043
Cara…

37
00:03:20,483 --> 00:03:23,181
Cara something.
I had a smoke with her earlier.

38
00:03:23,991 --> 00:03:28,448
She’s looking for counseling
so I mentioned you.

39
00:03:29,648 --> 00:03:30,691
Okay?

40
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:37,441
So much baggage...
she broke up with her boss recently.

41
00:03:37,597 --> 00:03:40,752
- Her boss recently.
- Her boss?

42
00:03:41,377 --> 00:03:44,445
Right? Crazy.

43
00:03:44,476 --> 00:03:48,456
But she’s not a mess or anything.

44
00:03:48,696 --> 00:03:50,447
She’s actually sweet,

45
00:03:51,037 --> 00:03:55,394
- she actually taught me about Playtime.
- Oh, Playtime...

46
00:03:56,328 --> 00:04:00,722
Not the one you’re thinking.
This, Playtime.

47
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:05,286
Playtime, you know

48
00:04:05,311 --> 00:04:08,901
almost everyone at the office plays this.

49
00:04:09,669 --> 00:04:13,059
There are varieties of games in it.

50
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,711
So much to choose from, right?

51
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:20,510
Let’s try this, Scatter.

52
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:24,305
Oh, so this is Scatter?
They mentioned this at the clinic.

53
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:27,583
- This is at Playtime.ph right?
- Mm-hmm.

54
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:31,145
They say it’s easy to play,
just through E-wallets.

55
00:04:31,463 --> 00:04:33,132
Yeah, right?

56
00:04:34,053 --> 00:04:39,279
- We won at Scatter!
- Great, you won already!

57
00:04:41,001 --> 00:04:44,677
You know, this can add funds for us.

58
00:04:45,734 --> 00:04:50,990
Uhm... so, anyway, about Cara...

59
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:55,773
I was thinking that...

60
00:04:56,607 --> 00:05:00,486
- I know where this is going.
- Yes, I mentioned you.

61
00:05:01,647 --> 00:05:05,839
Come on, Kate. You know my
schedule’s packed for the next few weeks.

62
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:09,362
Aside from that, we’re preparing
for the wedding, remember?

63
00:05:09,387 --> 00:05:12,145
We have time. Two months.

64
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:16,858
Come on, you know I’m soft-hearted
when it comes to things like this.

65
00:05:17,392 --> 00:05:18,476
Please?

66
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:20,498
Do I have a choice?

67
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:23,467
Okay, okay, I’ll do it.

68
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:36,627
Now can we do the other play time?

69
00:06:14,687 --> 00:06:15,927
Oh, yes!

70
00:06:17,973 --> 00:06:19,140
Oh, yes!

71
00:06:28,029 --> 00:06:31,682
It’s freaking hot...
Let me take a shower first.

72
00:06:32,585 --> 00:06:33,917
I’ll see you upstairs.

73
00:06:36,076 --> 00:06:37,480
Okay...

74
00:06:37,775 --> 00:06:38,775
[sighs]

75
00:06:40,779 --> 00:06:43,657
- I’ll continue playing Playtime.
- Okay, okay.

76
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,629
I’ll be fast.

77
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:53,121
I’ll just play.

78
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:10,708
Yes!

79
00:07:14,778 --> 00:07:15,863
Bro,

80
00:07:16,682 --> 00:07:19,604
I’ll take care of the
hotel reservation.

81
00:07:20,289 --> 00:07:23,000
Those other guys better chip in.

82
00:07:23,284 --> 00:07:25,779
A lot of them aren’t even replying.
Let them be.

83
00:07:25,804 --> 00:07:28,902
You’re the one insisting on
a bachelor’s party. Not me.

84
00:07:29,265 --> 00:07:31,100
- All I wanted was...
- Two beers.

85
00:07:31,469 --> 00:07:33,971
- Yes.
- Two beers. I’ve heard that before.

86
00:07:34,992 --> 00:07:38,704
You can’t have a bachelor’s party
with just two beers.

87
00:07:39,366 --> 00:07:42,661
Just bonding with friends.
What’s wrong with that?

88
00:07:42,906 --> 00:07:45,365
What’s wrong? Everything, dude!

89
00:07:45,913 --> 00:07:49,416
You’re leaving bachelorhood
behind... <i>bachelorism</i>.

90
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:52,541
Doesn’t that have any
sentimental value for you?

91
00:07:52,566 --> 00:07:56,051
- None.
- None? I know what you’re gonna say.

92
00:07:56,322 --> 00:07:58,910
I know you too well.
Just let me do this...

93
00:07:59,477 --> 00:08:01,896
it’s my role in your
life as your best friend.

94
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:06,453
Let me play my part.
Even just dancers, okay?

95
00:08:08,495 --> 00:08:11,892
You know I’m recovering
from sex addiction, right?

96
00:08:12,582 --> 00:08:14,126
I can’t risk a relapse.

97
00:08:14,533 --> 00:08:17,649
- You, of all people, should know that.
- You should know that.

98
00:08:18,255 --> 00:08:23,719
Eric, no one’s telling you to sleep
with the women there. You’re nuts.

99
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,653
- And besides...
- Shh.

100
00:08:26,335 --> 00:08:27,420
Hi, B!

101
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:31,008
Hey, B... your ass looks great!

102
00:08:33,344 --> 00:08:35,808
And besides, don’t be selfish.

103
00:08:35,937 --> 00:08:38,656
This party is for us, not for you.

104
00:08:39,615 --> 00:08:41,888
- You womanizer...
- Retired.

105
00:08:41,913 --> 00:08:46,371
Retired, yeah. You were fun
before you got together with Kate.

106
00:08:46,616 --> 00:08:50,410
Now you’re boring, bro.
You’re not exciting anymore.

107
00:08:50,693 --> 00:08:54,074
Boring, huh? Fine, I’ll just
give that to someone else

108
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,970
- since I’m so boring.
- I’m just kidding. Come on, man.

109
00:08:57,888 --> 00:09:00,221
- We’re best friends, right?
- Yeah, yeah.

110
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:05,162
Look, I’ll be your anti-wingman.

111
00:09:05,238 --> 00:09:09,618
If a girl comes up to you,
I’ll block her right away.

112
00:09:09,643 --> 00:09:11,962
- I’ll cockblock for you.
- Good. Good.

113
00:09:15,634 --> 00:09:16,635
One more thing, bro,

114
00:09:17,463 --> 00:09:21,231
whenever you bring food home for Kate
and she doesn’t eat it,

115
00:09:21,442 --> 00:09:25,613
let me be the one to finish it, okay?
I never get to eat stuff like this...

116
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:34,819
As you know, I’m practical,
it’s always sardines.

117
00:10:04,766 --> 00:10:05,819
- Hey!
- Sorry.

118
00:10:05,886 --> 00:10:07,520
Who’s the one sleep-deprived,
you or me?

119
00:10:08,322 --> 00:10:11,535
I was the one
who partied last night, right?

120
00:10:14,075 --> 00:10:17,578
Let’s figure out that schedule,
I want to free up my time.

121
00:10:21,091 --> 00:10:23,289
Uhh... Meg?

122
00:10:23,314 --> 00:10:24,314
Oh!

123
00:10:24,544 --> 00:10:25,586
Doc?

124
00:10:25,965 --> 00:10:30,678
This is Cara, she’s your 3 PM.
She said you were expecting her?

125
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:34,646
Hi, Doc. I'm Cara.
Kate mentioned me?

126
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:39,028
Ah, yeah. Kate…

127
00:10:39,413 --> 00:10:42,850
Right, she did mention you.
Uh, please, have a seat.

128
00:10:46,555 --> 00:10:49,627
So... tell me about...

129
00:10:49,652 --> 00:10:53,051
So, Kate mentioned
why I’m looking for counseling?

130
00:10:53,076 --> 00:10:55,891
Yeah. She told me
you had a bad breakup?

131
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,572
- That’s just the tip of the iceberg, Doc.
- Just call me Eric.

132
00:10:59,869 --> 00:11:01,992
Don’t worry, this is a safe space.

133
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:04,518
You did say that… Eric.

134
00:11:05,079 --> 00:11:08,319
How do I put this?
There’s a lot to unpack.

135
00:11:08,521 --> 00:11:11,329
You can say it.
Safe place, remember?

136
00:11:13,927 --> 00:11:16,712
I enjoy having sex
with married people.

137
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:21,008
Too detailed... Eric?

138
00:11:22,632 --> 00:11:25,677
- Well...
- Should I explain, Eric?

139
00:11:25,857 --> 00:11:27,651
Of course, feel free.

140
00:11:28,734 --> 00:11:33,489
My last breakup…
well, we were never really together.

141
00:11:33,928 --> 00:11:37,890
- He was older. Married.
- You fell for a married person?

142
00:11:39,267 --> 00:11:41,573
Fell? No.

143
00:11:42,172 --> 00:11:45,925
I just enjoy having sex
with people who are taken.

144
00:11:46,865 --> 00:11:51,495
Oh, okay.
So, this isn’t an isolated case?

145
00:11:52,068 --> 00:11:55,982
Nope. It’s more… a fetish.

146
00:11:56,167 --> 00:11:57,460
Why do you say that?

147
00:11:57,936 --> 00:12:01,703
It’s exciting. Don’t you feel it, Eric?

148
00:12:02,239 --> 00:12:03,324
Feel what?

149
00:12:03,477 --> 00:12:07,283
The secrecy. It’s more arousing,
don’t you think?

150
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,580
- Arousing?
- Arousing.

151
00:12:16,703 --> 00:12:19,956
It’s the danger.
The forbidden aspect of it.

152
00:12:20,525 --> 00:12:22,744
But don’t you think you’re rocking
a marriage at that point?

153
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:25,806
If a married man desires me,

154
00:12:25,872 --> 00:12:28,647
do you really think
they were loyal to begin with?

155
00:12:28,677 --> 00:12:31,844
- But you could be a part of that.
- Hypothetically.

156
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:35,085
Let’s say I asked you
to have sex with me right now.

157
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,328
- Hypothetically.
- Wouldn’t you be turned on?

158
00:12:40,453 --> 00:12:42,747
I think you’d get hard.

159
00:12:43,719 --> 00:12:46,510
Especially because it’s forbidden.

160
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:47,959
It’s more enjoyable.

161
00:12:48,903 --> 00:12:52,323
More tempting,
because it’s not allowed.

162
00:13:02,325 --> 00:13:04,873
You’re probably
already thinking about it.

163
00:13:05,045 --> 00:13:06,102
About what?

164
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,228
That you’re having sex with me.

165
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:11,012
And that I’m blowing you.

166
00:13:12,381 --> 00:13:13,415
Hypothetically.

167
00:13:14,408 --> 00:13:15,826
Hypothetically.

168
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,965
[background chatter]

169
00:13:23,289 --> 00:13:26,075
I really don’t like her, I’m sorry.

170
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:28,040
- I don’t like her.
- Really?

171
00:13:29,006 --> 00:13:32,514
Whatever you say,
I’ll have to say no.

172
00:13:32,837 --> 00:13:34,507
- Hey guys.
- Eric!

173
00:13:34,532 --> 00:13:35,541
There he is.

174
00:13:35,566 --> 00:13:38,301
Eric, I’m the one getting the short
end of the stick at this wedding, right?

175
00:13:38,803 --> 00:13:41,294
She's pairing me with her cousin!

176
00:13:41,793 --> 00:13:43,538
You guys are still talking about that?

177
00:13:45,815 --> 00:13:46,858
Where’s my kiss?

178
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:54,216
Why, what’s wrong with Erika?
She’s pretty.

179
00:13:54,241 --> 00:13:57,859
She’s not pretty. You’re just biased
because she’s your cousin.

180
00:13:57,884 --> 00:14:01,666
- Crazy! As if you’re that handsome!
- I’ve accepted it...

181
00:14:02,404 --> 00:14:04,707
I’m a solid seven. Max.

182
00:14:04,881 --> 00:14:09,135
But come on, Kate.
Your cousin’s like… a four.

183
00:14:10,374 --> 00:14:13,467
You know, at your age,

184
00:14:13,563 --> 00:14:16,524
you should be getting serious,
settle down.

185
00:14:17,277 --> 00:14:21,656
Talk some sense into your friend.
His brain’s always full of lust.

186
00:14:21,911 --> 00:14:23,779
She said your brain’s full of lust, bro.

187
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:30,703
Don’t let me hear that your bachelor’s
party is going to be wild, okay?

188
00:14:30,816 --> 00:14:33,652
Of course not,
we’re just going to have coffee.

189
00:14:34,096 --> 00:14:36,933
Well, ours is just pastries
and board games.

190
00:14:37,523 --> 00:14:41,700
Wow, that sounds exciting,
is this a christening?

191
00:14:43,343 --> 00:14:45,593
- I’ll head upstairs.
- Alright, I’ll see you later.

192
00:14:50,066 --> 00:14:52,694
Trust me, bro.

193
00:14:53,202 --> 00:14:56,888
- We’ll have games too.
- You’re going to get me in trouble.

194
00:14:57,456 --> 00:15:00,375
By the way, the reunion’s on tomorrow.

195
00:15:00,646 --> 00:15:04,160
You should come...
I matched with someone on Bumbler.

196
00:15:04,401 --> 00:15:06,188
Who is it this time?

197
00:15:07,415 --> 00:15:09,042
Dude, she’s a winner.

198
00:15:09,947 --> 00:15:12,384
This might actually be
the one I settle down with.

199
00:15:12,751 --> 00:15:14,077
You're the best man, okay?

200
00:15:14,102 --> 00:15:19,804
- She’s probably fake.
- No way, man. We already video called.

201
00:15:20,421 --> 00:15:24,740
- Tomorrow, I’m sealing the deal.
- Whatever, it’s up to you.

202
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,123
Admit it, bro, you’re lame now.

203
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:38,187
So, how long have you been a therapist?

204
00:15:38,452 --> 00:15:40,912
Hmm... Around eight years.

205
00:15:42,648 --> 00:15:46,944
Don’t you get tired of listening to the
same complaints over and over again?

206
00:15:47,724 --> 00:15:48,733
Not really.

207
00:15:48,757 --> 00:15:50,377
Actually, I like to think
I’m making a livelihood

208
00:15:50,402 --> 00:15:52,384
helping people make better decisions.

209
00:15:52,638 --> 00:15:56,914
And you? Do you think all
of your decisions are always right?

210
00:15:57,095 --> 00:15:58,695
Why does it feel
like we’ve swapped places here?

211
00:15:58,881 --> 00:16:02,303
I’m just asking.
I’m curious about you.

212
00:16:02,947 --> 00:16:05,616
There’s nothing to be curious about.
I’m vanilla.

213
00:16:07,991 --> 00:16:11,571
I don’t think you’re as vanilla
as you think you are.

214
00:16:12,758 --> 00:16:14,760
I like eating vanilla.

215
00:16:19,129 --> 00:16:21,929
- Oh my gosh!
- Meg?

216
00:16:22,771 --> 00:16:27,379
- Brown out again?
- Doc, power outage.

217
00:16:27,404 --> 00:16:30,800
I’m sorry about this, Cara.
Maybe we should continue tomo...

218
00:16:31,091 --> 00:16:34,994
No, I’m fine. I don’t
have anywhere to go.

219
00:16:35,097 --> 00:16:38,884
Why? Are you scared?
Are you scared of me?

220
00:16:39,838 --> 00:16:43,457
Again, you’re being very provocative.

221
00:16:44,485 --> 00:16:45,778
It’s just hot in here.

222
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:48,551
I’m not feeling hot.

223
00:16:56,734 --> 00:16:58,527
- What is it?
- Nothing.

224
00:16:58,552 --> 00:17:01,535
Nothing. It’s just hard to believe
that actually happened.

225
00:17:02,144 --> 00:17:04,479
Is it really that hard to imagine?

226
00:17:05,216 --> 00:17:08,054
Would it help if I gave you the details?

227
00:17:14,503 --> 00:17:16,616
If we’re talking about Wesley,

228
00:17:17,593 --> 00:17:19,178
this is how he’d touch me.

229
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:22,708
Uh… isn’t that sexual harassment?

230
00:17:23,259 --> 00:17:26,220
It doesn’t count if I wanted it… does it?

231
00:17:28,393 --> 00:17:29,394
Yeah.

232
00:17:31,745 --> 00:17:33,581
Whenever it was just the two of us,

233
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,556
this is how he would touch me.

234
00:17:39,551 --> 00:17:42,345
Testing if I’d pull away.

235
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:44,501
The next week,

236
00:17:45,797 --> 00:17:47,340
his hand was already here.

237
00:17:48,857 --> 00:17:50,232
I didn’t stop him.

238
00:17:50,665 --> 00:17:52,075
A week later...

239
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,489
another inch.

240
00:17:56,314 --> 00:17:59,526
And then, two weeks ago…

241
00:18:34,548 --> 00:18:35,841
It really is hot, isn’t it?

242
00:18:56,332 --> 00:18:59,836
Oh! Uh... it’s overtime already.
Let’s continue some other time?

243
00:19:00,595 --> 00:19:03,986
- Yeah, sure. I'll go ahead.
- Okay.

244
00:19:18,176 --> 00:19:24,162
[background chatter]

245
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:25,263
So good!

246
00:19:33,587 --> 00:19:34,671
Hey, bro.

247
00:19:34,696 --> 00:19:36,557
- Cheers!
- Cheers, boys!

248
00:19:36,582 --> 00:19:40,004
- Thanks for coming.
- Bottoms up!

249
00:19:41,792 --> 00:19:46,344
Bro, wait, my date’s at the entrance.

250
00:19:46,369 --> 00:19:48,955
- I’ll just get her, okay?
- Sure, make it fast.

251
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:52,570
You’re just sneaking off.
Hey, make sure to chip in!

252
00:19:52,595 --> 00:19:54,847
Are you crazy? Eric’s paying for this!

253
00:19:54,872 --> 00:19:57,424
- Then let’s have more!
- Hurry up!

254
00:19:57,525 --> 00:20:02,351
You know, we should do this more often.

255
00:20:02,491 --> 00:20:05,175
I need a break from my wife
once in a while.

256
00:20:05,733 --> 00:20:09,538
Exactly! Eric, just some friendly advice...

257
00:20:09,563 --> 00:20:12,383
life slows down
after you get married,

258
00:20:12,408 --> 00:20:15,805
- so make the most of it now.
- Savor it while you can, bro!

259
00:20:16,336 --> 00:20:18,593
I’m not even looking
for that kind of thing.

260
00:20:18,618 --> 00:20:20,074
I’m not like you guys anymore.

261
00:20:20,163 --> 00:20:21,669
I’m happy with Kate.

262
00:20:22,885 --> 00:20:24,877
- Cheesy!
- Cheesy!

263
00:20:26,383 --> 00:20:28,171
Screw you, guys!

264
00:20:44,616 --> 00:20:45,992
- Bro!
- Hey!

265
00:20:46,984 --> 00:20:48,444
Guys, this is Cara.

266
00:20:48,587 --> 00:20:51,654
- Cara, this is Brad, Gab, Emman...
- Hello.

267
00:20:51,997 --> 00:20:54,091
and Eric.

268
00:20:55,181 --> 00:20:56,975
You look familiar.

269
00:20:57,671 --> 00:20:59,474
I’m Kate’s fiancé.

270
00:20:59,772 --> 00:21:02,066
- Your office mate.
- Oh, yeah, right.

271
00:22:41,088 --> 00:22:42,590
Ah, shit...

272
00:22:47,896 --> 00:22:49,147
Ah... Shit...

273
00:23:44,582 --> 00:23:48,134
- I want to go home.
- It’s better if Aaron takes you home.

274
00:23:48,247 --> 00:23:49,943
You’re drunk...
it’s dangerous.

275
00:23:50,946 --> 00:23:52,082
I’m not drunk.

276
00:23:53,144 --> 00:23:54,356
I can smell the alcohol on you...

277
00:23:57,795 --> 00:24:00,256
- Does it smell like alcohol?
- Yes.

278
00:24:00,475 --> 00:24:03,568
Do you want your friend to screw me?

279
00:24:05,737 --> 00:24:09,616
When I drink, I get horny.

280
00:24:11,529 --> 00:24:16,157
So if you think Aaron’s taking me home,
I can guarantee he’ll sleep with me.

281
00:24:21,868 --> 00:24:22,868
Come in.

282
00:24:30,648 --> 00:24:32,579
I’ll just grab a towel.

283
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:36,935
- Sit down. Want some water?
- Yeah, sure.

284
00:24:49,886 --> 00:24:50,906
Kate?

285
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:54,045
Yeah, she’s been messaging,
she's wondering where I...

286
00:25:08,531 --> 00:25:13,214
- Cara, you’re drunk. This isn’t right.
- Says who? I want to.

287
00:25:38,972 --> 00:25:40,015
No.

288
00:25:41,532 --> 00:25:43,909
You know, I got to go home.

289
00:28:48,857 --> 00:28:52,927
- Have a seat.
- Meg, I’m not expecting anyone...

290
00:28:52,995 --> 00:28:56,033
Doc, here’s Ms. Cara.

291
00:29:00,938 --> 00:29:02,523
We can’t do this any longer.

292
00:29:03,218 --> 00:29:05,018
- Last night...
- Was a mistake?

293
00:29:05,671 --> 00:29:07,638
Who was drunk, you or me?

294
00:29:09,865 --> 00:29:12,426
I’m... I’m sorry.

295
00:29:12,755 --> 00:29:16,628
It was just... a moment,
and it’s not right, you know?

296
00:29:17,079 --> 00:29:18,331
That’s not me.

297
00:29:19,258 --> 00:29:20,285
Really?

298
00:29:23,905 --> 00:29:25,905
I’m getting married. You know that.

299
00:29:27,649 --> 00:29:28,780
I know.

300
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:46,594
Oh, yes!

301
00:30:54,548 --> 00:30:57,176
- Do you like it?
- Yes.

302
00:31:25,471 --> 00:31:27,931
- Are you excited?
- Of course.

303
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,748
You’re sure about this videographer?

304
00:31:29,773 --> 00:31:33,576
Of course. You saw how beautiful Jen
and Ivan’s pre-nup video turned out, right?

305
00:31:33,614 --> 00:31:35,309
I’m so excited!

306
00:31:37,596 --> 00:31:39,274
Cara didn’t come to work today.

307
00:31:39,299 --> 00:31:40,826
Did she have
a counseling session with you?

308
00:31:40,851 --> 00:31:42,491
Ah… no.

309
00:31:44,454 --> 00:31:46,719
I haven’t seen her since… uh…

310
00:31:47,069 --> 00:31:49,419
Shoot. I forgot.

311
00:31:49,753 --> 00:31:51,460
I’m just worried about her.

312
00:31:52,245 --> 00:31:55,039
You know, she doesn’t have any family here.

313
00:31:55,086 --> 00:31:58,943
They’re all abroad,
so she can be a little needy.

314
00:31:59,437 --> 00:32:01,626
- Wait, let me call her...
- No need!

315
00:32:02,777 --> 00:32:05,462
Come on. You’re being
too much of a big sister.

316
00:32:05,487 --> 00:32:07,050
She can handle things by herself.

317
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,011
You're right.

318
00:32:12,138 --> 00:32:14,574
Oh, why is there an earring here?

319
00:32:14,947 --> 00:32:19,160
Uh… that’s… from Aaron’s date last night.

320
00:32:19,776 --> 00:32:24,158
- You gave her a ride home?
- Of course not. Aaron took her home.

321
00:32:24,332 --> 00:32:25,584
Then why is it here?

322
00:32:26,158 --> 00:32:31,246
Oh... yeah, Aaron rode with me.

323
00:32:31,271 --> 00:32:34,066
Then I guess it was in
his pocket or something,

324
00:32:34,417 --> 00:32:38,588
and he showed it to me, and then…
left it there. Just leave it there.

325
00:32:38,981 --> 00:32:40,942
Okay, I’ll just put it here.

326
00:32:43,249 --> 00:32:46,266
- These are some really nice pre-nup shots.
- Thank you, sir.

327
00:32:48,626 --> 00:32:49,877
It’s beautiful.

328
00:32:50,507 --> 00:32:55,031
- Wow, nice. I want this on my gown.
- Of course, ma’am.

329
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:58,128
- Actually there are other shots.
- I like how detailed it is.

330
00:32:58,153 --> 00:33:03,664
Yeah, it’s good to take
the details of the wedding...

331
00:33:03,991 --> 00:33:05,858
These shots make it beautiful.

332
00:33:05,883 --> 00:33:08,761
How about the view?

333
00:33:08,786 --> 00:33:14,222
- Nice, I like this one.
- Yeah, this concept is more natural.

334
00:33:14,247 --> 00:33:18,363
You know, it’s more genuine.

335
00:33:18,616 --> 00:33:21,500
- Nice, I can see.
- Yeah.

336
00:33:21,896 --> 00:33:26,425
- I like this one, very dramatic.
- It’s beautiful, right?

337
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:31,526
[chattering]

338
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:34,940
Sorry to interrupt, I’m just
going to the restroom, okay?

339
00:33:35,530 --> 00:33:37,210
Okay, so back to this...

340
00:33:37,376 --> 00:33:40,342
Do you prefer this?
The face is hidden?

341
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:49,629
Oh, yes!

342
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:07,855
What was that?

343
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:11,984
- Excuse me.
- Okay, ma’am.

344
00:35:19,946 --> 00:35:21,031
Eric?

345
00:35:22,365 --> 00:35:27,689
- Eric?
- Yes, hon? Sorry. My stomach hurts.

346
00:35:28,409 --> 00:35:32,579
Are you okay? What happened?
I want to ask you something.

347
00:35:32,604 --> 00:35:34,898
I need you to see this, come on.

348
00:35:34,963 --> 00:35:39,399
I’ll be out in a moment,
I’ll be right there.

349
00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:43,277
- Do you want me to come in?
- Ah... No, no!

350
00:35:43,376 --> 00:35:45,525
Just... just give me a moment.

351
00:35:46,629 --> 00:35:48,297
Okay, finish up.

352
00:35:48,322 --> 00:35:52,274
- When you’re done, get back to us.
- Okay...

353
00:35:55,366 --> 00:35:59,480
- Are you okay?
- Y... yes, yes.

354
00:36:01,685 --> 00:36:02,728
I’ll catch up.

355
00:37:20,829 --> 00:37:24,875
- Oh, Cara, you're here?
- Oh! Hi, Kate.

356
00:37:25,101 --> 00:37:27,717
- Just wanted to stop by.
- Are you okay?

357
00:37:28,224 --> 00:37:30,559
- I'm fine.
- Do you need someone to talk to?

358
00:37:38,136 --> 00:37:40,346
You and Eric really look cute together.

359
00:37:42,477 --> 00:37:47,482
I don’t tell him this, but you know,
I’m really lucky to have him.

360
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:50,893
He’s such a good guy.

361
00:37:59,231 --> 00:38:02,985
- Lunch is served.
- Here comes the one he’s so proud of!

362
00:38:03,183 --> 00:38:06,895
See? He doesn’t just cook, you know?

363
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:09,382
You really went out of your way, Eric.
No need for that.

364
00:38:09,407 --> 00:38:14,826
- Okay, should I put it in the fridge?
- Hey, this is why I came here!

365
00:38:16,762 --> 00:38:18,847
Hey, no takeouts, okay?

366
00:38:19,158 --> 00:38:22,675
Before you leave, I’ll frisk you guys.

367
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:26,412
Oh, Eric, don’t expect there to be
any leftovers, we’re finishing it all,

368
00:38:26,437 --> 00:38:29,888
we skipped breakfast
just for your Kare-Kare!

369
00:38:30,104 --> 00:38:32,607
Okay, finish this all.

370
00:38:32,632 --> 00:38:36,464
- Is there anyone else coming?
- Oh, yeah...

371
00:38:36,489 --> 00:38:38,842
- Can you please get the door?
- Okay.

[background chatter]

373
00:38:48,672 --> 00:38:49,715
Hi.

374
00:38:51,015 --> 00:38:54,379
- Cara! Hi, come in.
- Oh, hi!

375
00:38:54,846 --> 00:38:57,455
- My friends are inside.
- Okay.

376
00:38:58,896 --> 00:39:00,262
Uhm...

377
00:39:00,287 --> 00:39:01,933
- Hi!
- Hello! How are you?

378
00:39:01,958 --> 00:39:04,404
Why did you invite Cara?

379
00:39:04,695 --> 00:39:06,906
Are you guys close now?

380
00:39:07,557 --> 00:39:12,729
Why not? Last time she told me,
she feels like I’m her big sister.

381
00:39:12,754 --> 00:39:14,847
So I thought, why not bring her here,

382
00:39:14,961 --> 00:39:16,822
it’s like having a little sister.

383
00:39:17,441 --> 00:39:20,927
- I think she needs a new crowd.
- [background chatter]

384
00:39:20,952 --> 00:39:24,199
- She seems sad sometimes.
- [background chatter]

385
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:31,253
- Kate, do you have any water?
- Of course.

386
00:39:31,542 --> 00:39:33,169
- I’ll get it.
- Okay.

387
00:39:34,393 --> 00:39:35,728
- I’ll just get it.
- Alright.

388
00:39:45,227 --> 00:39:46,681
I’m not wearing any panties.

389
00:39:47,382 --> 00:39:51,094
When Kate’s gone, I’ll be
on top of you in the bedroom.

390
00:39:51,631 --> 00:39:52,701
Shut up.

391
00:39:53,118 --> 00:39:54,599
What the hell are you doing here?

392
00:39:57,109 --> 00:40:04,012
Is this the famous Kare-Kare of Eric? Wow!

393
00:40:09,931 --> 00:40:12,934
- Cara, you can’t do that.
- You’re not even going to say hi?

394
00:40:13,607 --> 00:40:14,900
I’m serious!

395
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:20,338
I thought this was just a game?
Now it’s serious?

396
00:40:21,348 --> 00:40:23,600
You’re confusing me.

397
00:40:28,934 --> 00:40:33,313
This shouldn’t be happening.
I don’t want to go where this is going.

398
00:40:33,906 --> 00:40:35,365
You’re overstepping.

399
00:40:39,671 --> 00:40:41,089
Are you even listening?

400
00:40:43,495 --> 00:40:49,018
- Hello? What the hell is going on?
- Shh! Stay there.

401
00:43:37,736 --> 00:43:40,948
- You’re crazy.
- We’re the same, Eric.

402
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:45,234
There’s nothing decent about either of us,
so don’t talk like you’re so clean.

403
00:43:45,259 --> 00:43:48,112
- You enjoyed it earlier, didn’t you?
- We’re done.

404
00:43:48,591 --> 00:43:51,485
- What?
- I said, we’re done.

405
00:43:51,510 --> 00:43:55,395
- No.
- Believe me, we are. Screw you.

406
00:44:01,287 --> 00:44:02,970
Hi, ma’am, please sign these.

407
00:44:02,995 --> 00:44:07,124
Oh, where did you get that bruise?

408
00:44:07,528 --> 00:44:11,344
- It’s nothing.
- Seriously, are you okay?

409
00:44:11,843 --> 00:44:15,789
- I’m okay...
- If there’s a problem, you can tell me.

410
00:44:16,022 --> 00:44:17,045
[sighs]

411
00:44:17,110 --> 00:44:20,673
My problem is…
I keep falling for the wrong person.

412
00:44:21,706 --> 00:44:25,514
When it comes to love,
you just need the right moment.

413
00:44:26,098 --> 00:44:29,027
Don’t settle for just anyone, girl.

414
00:44:29,496 --> 00:44:33,170
There’s someone meant for you.
They’ll come, I promise.

415
00:44:33,222 --> 00:44:37,663
- I hope so.
- I know so. You of all people.

416
00:44:37,806 --> 00:44:40,228
He could be just around the corner.

417
00:44:41,849 --> 00:44:43,182
There’s someone meant for you.

418
00:44:45,574 --> 00:44:49,578
Oh, right. How’s your counseling with Eric?

419
00:44:49,603 --> 00:44:51,897
Is it effective? Is it helping?

420
00:44:51,950 --> 00:44:54,582
It’s okay. Fun.

421
00:44:55,412 --> 00:44:56,819
It’s helping me get through things…

422
00:44:57,561 --> 00:45:01,765
…through my grievances. I really need that.

423
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:03,596
Thank you.

424
00:45:03,801 --> 00:45:07,105
I really have you
to thank, Kate.

425
00:45:10,392 --> 00:45:14,751
Hey, Kate,
your prince charming’s come to visit.

426
00:45:16,745 --> 00:45:18,397
What’s the occasion?

427
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:23,472
Surprise! I felt like you needed flowers.

428
00:45:24,182 --> 00:45:25,433
You deserve it, you know.

429
00:45:27,111 --> 00:45:29,321
- I love you, Kate.
- I love you.

430
00:45:34,929 --> 00:45:38,277
- Let’s have lunch?
- I have something to do.

431
00:45:41,862 --> 00:45:44,031
Hello, are you busy?

432
00:45:44,389 --> 00:45:46,724
Yeah, I’m just finishing up some work.

433
00:45:48,313 --> 00:45:50,578
Okay, just keep working.

434
00:46:17,439 --> 00:46:19,858
Keep working, I’ll work here too.

435
00:46:33,672 --> 00:46:34,882
Is that porn?

436
00:46:36,161 --> 00:46:37,162
What’s that?

437
00:46:37,187 --> 00:46:39,223
- Uh...
- Was that porn?

438
00:46:39,385 --> 00:46:43,695
Of course not, I was just included
in an email thread...

439
00:46:44,562 --> 00:46:45,689
Show me.

440
00:46:46,450 --> 00:46:47,993
Come on, hon.

441
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:54,557
- Show me.
- It’s something stupid. It’s nothing.

442
00:46:56,362 --> 00:46:57,529
Okay.

443
00:47:06,321 --> 00:47:07,321
Wait.

444
00:47:08,381 --> 00:47:09,988
- They’re here, bro.
- This is it.

445
00:47:11,129 --> 00:47:13,483
They're only dancing, okay?

446
00:47:17,844 --> 00:47:19,053
Girls, get over here.

447
00:47:20,019 --> 00:47:22,102
- Why is Cara there?
- Come here, don't be shy.

448
00:47:22,134 --> 00:47:23,856
Just sharing the love, bro.

449
00:47:24,511 --> 00:47:25,637
What do you mean?

450
00:47:26,645 --> 00:47:31,429
Relax. It’s embarrassing to admit,
but between us...

451
00:47:31,792 --> 00:47:34,798
Cara’s a stripper.
I’m cool with it.

452
00:47:35,769 --> 00:47:38,112
You guys are dating?

453
00:47:38,816 --> 00:47:42,404
Sort of? Can’t even get
to third base though.

454
00:47:43,444 --> 00:47:46,729
Just enjoy the party,
you’re way too tense.

455
00:47:52,036 --> 00:47:53,302
That feels so good!

456
00:47:53,933 --> 00:47:54,933
Oh yeah!

457
00:47:55,260 --> 00:47:56,294
Come on, baby!

458
00:47:56,567 --> 00:47:58,426
Brother, can I get some of that?

459
00:47:58,441 --> 00:47:59,581
Yeah, this is for us!

460
00:47:59,606 --> 00:48:01,202
Mhm, good!

461
00:48:01,898 --> 00:48:02,898
Yeah!

Stop... Stop!

466
00:49:09,882 --> 00:49:11,666
Cara, get out of my life.

467
00:49:13,097 --> 00:49:17,310
You can’t just do that so easily.
You know we’re meant to be, Eric.

468
00:49:17,336 --> 00:49:20,476
Damn it, what made you think that?

469
00:49:20,744 --> 00:49:22,144
I’m getting married.

470
00:49:22,187 --> 00:49:24,272
I know this is just
a fetish for you, but Cara,

471
00:49:24,297 --> 00:49:25,841
find somebody else, okay?

472
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:29,919
- No. What we have is different.
- Stop talking!

473
00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:34,603
Damn it, but every time you see me,
you can’t stop getting hard.

474
00:49:35,944 --> 00:49:36,945
Eric.

475
00:49:47,856 --> 00:49:52,384
I’m sorry, Kate.
I couldn’t bear the guilt anymore.

476
00:49:52,863 --> 00:49:55,031
You just needed to know about this.

477
00:50:00,417 --> 00:50:02,491
Let me explain. Kate, Kate...

478
00:50:19,492 --> 00:50:22,312
Kate, I’m taking some
of your stuff outside, okay?

479
00:50:22,399 --> 00:50:24,218
It's suddenly gotten uncomfortable here.

480
00:50:25,276 --> 00:50:26,319
Kate?

481
00:50:29,162 --> 00:50:30,204
Kate.

482
00:50:34,725 --> 00:50:35,726
Listen to me...

483
00:50:36,963 --> 00:50:38,923
Please, I’ll do anything.

484
00:50:41,231 --> 00:50:43,942
I’ll come back...
I still have some things left here.

485
00:50:44,084 --> 00:50:45,168
Kate.

486
00:50:46,130 --> 00:50:49,383
Eric, I don’t want to talk to you.

487
00:50:49,614 --> 00:50:51,866
Can you at least respect that?

488
00:50:55,241 --> 00:50:58,081
Kate, let’s go. Our ride is here.

489
00:50:58,106 --> 00:50:59,221
Don’t follow me...

490
00:50:59,246 --> 00:51:01,890
- Please, please, Kate...
- I said enough!

491
00:51:05,709 --> 00:51:08,420
You’re irritating.
Do you want me to punch you?

492
00:52:27,227 --> 00:52:28,269
Kate?

493
00:52:42,659 --> 00:52:45,745
- How did you get in?
- Your door was open.

494
00:52:45,857 --> 00:52:48,502
Aren’t you afraid
someone might break in?

495
00:52:48,777 --> 00:52:52,066
Anyway, I wanted you to try
my version of Kare-Kare.

496
00:52:52,091 --> 00:52:54,468
- It’s quick to make...
- Get out. Now!

497
00:52:55,074 --> 00:52:59,080
You still don’t get it, do you?
We’re meant to be, Eric.

498
00:52:59,544 --> 00:53:04,316
Admit it. I’m exciting.
I’m irresistible.

499
00:53:04,798 --> 00:53:06,417
You can’t deny that.

500
00:53:08,753 --> 00:53:09,879
Oh, wait...

501
00:53:12,486 --> 00:53:15,614
- Try it...
- You ruined my life.

502
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:19,214
Me? I saved you from Kate.

503
00:53:19,433 --> 00:53:23,938
- You know I’d do anything for you...
- Get out of my house.

504
00:53:23,963 --> 00:53:27,632
- I don’t ever want to see you again.
- What’s your problem?

505
00:53:28,119 --> 00:53:30,932
I’m here, I’m all yours!

506
00:53:30,957 --> 00:53:34,799
I don’t want anything to do with you.
I regret being with you.

507
00:53:34,965 --> 00:53:39,651
You’re a mistake.
You’re not meant to be with anybody.

508
00:53:40,987 --> 00:53:43,948
- Damn you!
- I’m calling the police.

509
00:53:45,296 --> 00:53:48,577
Not meant to be with anybody?
You’re mine!

510
00:53:49,113 --> 00:53:50,198
Mine!

511
00:54:05,205 --> 00:54:06,290
You’re mine,

512
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:11,330
not Kate’s... Mine.

513
00:54:17,861 --> 00:54:18,903
Stop...

514
00:54:36,383 --> 00:54:37,384
Stop.

515
00:54:54,814 --> 00:54:57,859
Shit, I’m so wet.

516
00:54:58,906 --> 00:55:02,132
You can’t resist me...
you’re already hard.

517
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:57,742
Get off my boyfriend.

518
00:55:59,446 --> 00:56:00,530
Kate...

519
00:56:01,862 --> 00:56:04,073
I know what you’ve been doing.

520
00:56:06,388 --> 00:56:07,556
This is yours, isn’t it?

521
00:56:13,885 --> 00:56:18,191
How can you accept that your boyfriend
is cheating on you with me?

522
00:56:19,368 --> 00:56:22,330
He’s bored of you.
I’m what he wants.

523
00:56:22,912 --> 00:56:27,316
That’s not your problem. What you
should worry about is the blackmail

524
00:56:27,341 --> 00:56:28,718
and rape charges waiting for you.

525
00:56:30,748 --> 00:56:37,004
Women like you are the ones
husbands leave for women like me.

526
00:56:38,095 --> 00:56:42,182
You’re too proper, too naive,

527
00:56:42,207 --> 00:56:44,459
and you’re too weak...

528
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:47,262
I could kill you right now

529
00:56:47,847 --> 00:56:50,292
and say you were trespassing.

530
00:56:50,715 --> 00:56:53,360
Go ahead, push me.

531
00:56:53,779 --> 00:56:56,047
Go on, go ahead.

532
00:56:57,086 --> 00:56:59,954
Go ahead, push me.

533
00:57:34,869 --> 00:57:37,080
Don’t worry. I’m not mad at you.

534
01:00:51,044 --> 01:00:52,129
Yes!

535
01:00:54,052 --> 01:00:55,136
Yes!

536
01:01:27,570 --> 01:01:30,781
You should thank Aaron.
For all his flaws, he cares about you.

537
01:01:31,079 --> 01:01:32,747
He’s the one who told me.

538
01:01:33,770 --> 01:01:36,147
You’ve been keeping a lot from me.

539
01:01:36,455 --> 01:01:37,529
I’m sorry, Kate.

540
01:01:38,281 --> 01:01:40,981
I promise, from now on,
I’ll tell you everything.

541
01:01:41,552 --> 01:01:44,432
It’s okay. Don’t rush.

542
01:01:44,705 --> 01:01:46,331
I also need time.

543
01:01:46,356 --> 01:01:50,110
Just remember, Eric,
don’t ever break my trust again.

544
01:01:50,963 --> 01:01:52,089
Never again.

545
01:01:52,615 --> 01:01:57,120
The only thing I wanted was to save you.
That’s all that was in my mind.

546
01:02:02,466 --> 01:02:04,885
- Where are you going?
- Home.

547
01:02:05,609 --> 01:02:08,560
- I’m confused.
- Didn’t I just tell you?

548
01:02:09,140 --> 01:02:10,927
I need time.

549
01:02:11,343 --> 01:02:15,587
- What about...
- The wedding? It’s canceled, of course.

550
01:02:16,273 --> 01:02:17,554
What do you think, I’m stupid?

551
01:02:18,407 --> 01:02:21,246
- Are we still together?
- No.

552
01:02:25,796 --> 01:02:27,539
You know, Eric...

553
01:02:29,751 --> 01:02:31,609
you can still court me again.

554
01:02:34,395 --> 01:02:37,690
I love you, Kate.
I love you so much.

555
01:02:46,164 --> 01:02:47,458
I like flowers.
