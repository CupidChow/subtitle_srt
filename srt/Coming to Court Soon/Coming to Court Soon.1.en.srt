(Qinzhong Nancheng District
People's Procuratorate)

(Zhong Qinyang, Prosecutor)

5
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,110
Mom.

6
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:21,620
Mom!

7
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:23,420
Mom, mom!

8
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:35,980
(Young Zhong Qinyang)

9
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:53,310
Dad.

10
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:55,670
No matter who the culprit is,

11
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,030
I'll find them.

12
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:09,500
Uncle Zhong's condition isn't good.

13
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,310
Come over right away.

14
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:11,270
I'm on my way.

15
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:20,780
(Qinzhong City Central Hospital)

16
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:23,510
You can't go in!

17
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:24,420
He's in emergency.

18
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:24,980
Dad!

19
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:25,950
Get out!

20
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,460
Uncle Zhong!

21
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:49,110
Yang.

22
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,070
How is my dad?

23
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,830
He was lying there too long.

24
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:56,460
The brain tumor ruptured,
causing him to go into shock.

25
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:57,990
We've managed to stabilize him for now.

26
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:10,630
Thank you.

27
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,020
Uncle Zhong's condition
is under control,

28
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:15,580
but it's still critical.

29
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,900
(Wu Yang, Chief Physician)
I'll do my best as a doctor.

30
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:19,420
But what about you?

31
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:20,760
Can you bring the culprit

32
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,180
who harmed Uncle Zhong to justice
while he's still alive?

33
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:24,860
Can you arrest Ma Haoda?

34
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,900
He had a solid alibi back then.

35
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,580
Before he was arrested years ago,

36
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:32,180
he had already said
he'd take revenge on Uncle Zhong.

37
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:35,080
He was just released from prison,
and then your parents had an accident.

38
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,300
Isn't that evidence enough?

39
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:38,830
The police have already investigated.

40
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:40,090
You need to trust the evidence.

41
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,020
I trust no one right now.

42
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:43,300
Tell me.

43
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,630
Will you arrest him or not?

44
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,230
I want to know more than anyone
who the real culprit is.

45
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:48,580
The person lying inside is my dad.

46
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:49,580
And let me tell you.

47
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,980
Without Uncle Zhong,
I wouldn't be here today.

48
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:54,300
To me, he's like a father, too.

49
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:01,670
I don't want him to die without peace.

50
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:06,900
Yang, I...

51
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,300
I didn't mean it that way.

52
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:12,900
If you won't investigate,

53
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:14,510
I'll do it myself!

54
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:16,860
Tomorrow, I'll find Ma Haoda.

55
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:32,220
Perhaps this car accident

56
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:34,070
really was an act of personal revenge.

57
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:37,590
Now that you mention it,

58
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:38,780
I remember.

59
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,660
There's a prisoner
who is violent by nature.

60
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:42,620
When he was imprisoned,

61
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:45,220
he claimed once he got out,
he wouldn't let Zhong Handong off.

62
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:47,990
He swore to take his entire family down.

63
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:49,830
His name is...

64
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:52,390
Ma Haoda.

65
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:53,580
Ma Haoda?

66
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:55,310
But he's still in prison.

67
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,820
How could he have committed the crime?

68
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:57,900
He was released this month.

69
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,940
(Black Mamba Billiards Club)

70
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:55,750
Are you Ma Haoda?

71
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,900
(Ma Haoda,
General Manager of Black Mamba)

72
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:58,580
Who's asking?

73
00:05:59,100 --> 00:05:59,780
Tell me.

74
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,190
Were you there the day

75
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:02,510
Prosecutor Zhong had his accident?

76
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:05,510
He had an accident?

77
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:08,140
Serves him right.

78
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:12,310
He's now in a vegetative state.

79
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:13,630
You're proud of that, aren't you?

80
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,140
Are you crazy?

81
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:19,830
What does Zhong Handong's accident
have to do with me?

82
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:23,390
He shouldn't have

83
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,510
such a grown-up daughter-in-law, right?

84
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,510
So, who are you?

85
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,540
You're not

86
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:33,220
his mistress, are you?

87
00:06:39,026 --> 00:06:40,740
(Li Songyan, son of Li Hai)

88
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:44,990
I knew getting involved
with the Zhong family

89
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,750
would never end well.

90
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:48,340
Fine.

91
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,700
You want answers, right?

92
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:52,900
Come with me.

93
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:55,070
Let's talk over there.

94
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:57,100
I'll wait for you.

95
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:20,460
What are you trying to do?

96
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,830
You know I own this place,

97
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:26,140
and you still dare lay a hand on me?

98
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:27,750
Do you know the consequences?

99
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:29,830
How dare you!

100
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:33,830
Take a look.

101
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:35,750
At your age,

102
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:37,780
you have your own charm.

103
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:38,630
Don't touch me!

104
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:41,510
Fiery, huh?

105
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:44,220
I like that.

106
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,700
Let go of me!

107
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:49,020
Let go!

108
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:52,270
Are you okay?

109
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:53,660
Qinyang, I...

110
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:54,510
Let's talk outside.

111
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:55,310
Stop right there!

112
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:56,870
You think you can

113
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:58,990
leave that easily?

114
00:07:59,190 --> 00:07:59,660
Get them!

115
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:10,140
