=Coming to Court Soon=

2
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,300
=Episode 2=

3
00:00:58,300 --> 00:00:59,110
You think you can

4
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:00,830
leave that easily?

5
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,310
It hurts.

6
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:39,420
You still know pain?

7
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,310
Isn't it all because of you?

8
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,470
How many times have I told you?

9
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:46,110
You don't need to handle these things.

10
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:47,470
And you still dared to go alone.

11
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,670
If I hadn't come today,

12
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:51,770
were you really planning
to fight them by yourself?

13
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:55,980
Besides, if my dad found out,

14
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:57,060
do you think he'd be happy?

15
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,420
Don't be so impulsive in the future.

16
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:01,420
Leave these things to me.

17
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:06,460
(Central Hospital)

18
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:10,780
Uncle Zhong.

19
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:13,030
Qinyang has been busy with work,

20
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:15,140
but I can take care of you.

21
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:21,230
Back when we first met,

22
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:23,180
grandma was the same age as you're now.

23
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:25,460
In the blink of an eye,

24
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:29,740
so many years have passed.

25
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,390
Back then,

26
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:44,270
both my parents went to prison.

27
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:46,830
Everyone despised me.

28
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,230
Even stray dogs on the street

29
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:52,860
were more likable than me.

30
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:55,990
(Zhong Handong, Zhong Qinyang's father)
Only you were willing to help me,

31
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,180
giving me tuition,

32
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:00,460
living expenses,

33
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,860
and even finding grandma a job.

34
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:07,860
Without you,

35
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,270
I wouldn't be who I am today.

36
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,420
Uncle Zhong, don't worry.

37
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,070
I'll definitely

38
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,460
seek justice for you.

39
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:28,850
(Wang Feiyu, student, 17)
Pass it to me.

40
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:36,230
Mengmeng, how's your injury?

41
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:39,300
I'm fine, almost healed.

42
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:41,530
(Zhang Mengmeng, student, 17)
I just missed a few days of class.

43
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:43,860
Thanks for your notes.

44
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:55,390
Mengmeng.

45
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:58,350
Mengmeng.

46
00:03:58,950 --> 00:03:59,790
Who is that guy?

47
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:04,550
You're my girlfriend.

48
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:08,270
Who allowed you to talk to other men?

49
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,460
Did I let you talk to others?

50
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:19,900
Did I agree?

51
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:21,740
Did I agree?

52
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:29,950
Why are you forcing me?

53
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:33,340
Even if I die,
I won't let you have your way!

54
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:39,140
Qinyang.

55
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:41,460
(Qinzhong Nancheng District)
Sorry for calling you over

56
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:42,340
(People's Procuratorate)
in such a hurry.

57
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:42,990
(Assistant Prosecutor)
It's okay.

58
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:44,700
(Song Su)
I read Zhang Mengmeng's file before.

59
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,540
She suffered a second-degree
minor injury from her boyfriend.

60
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:47,540
The case is clear,

61
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:48,950
and the verdict should be out soon.

62
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:50,390
She changed her statement yesterday.

63
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:51,830
Hello, we're from the Procuratorate.

64
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:52,950
This way, please.

65
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:58,070
This is our captain.

66
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,220
I'm the prosecutor in charge
of Zhang Mengmeng's case.

67
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:01,220
What's the situation now?

68
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:02,610
Her emotions are very unstable.

69
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:04,190
Our officers can't
approach her right now.

70
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,420
Have her parents been notified?

71
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,310
Yes, they have.

72
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,430
When Zhang Mengmeng
came to the Procuratorate before,

73
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:09,360
we discussed the case.

74
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:09,900
Let me try.

75
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:10,390
Alright.

76
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,220
Then we'll leave it to you prosecutors.

77
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:13,490
We'll provide support from below.

78
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,460
Let's stay in touch.

79
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:14,950
Okay.

80
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:15,950
Qinyang.

81
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:16,730
Let me go too.

82
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:17,630
After all, I'm a girl.

83
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:19,200
It'll be easier to communicate with her.

84
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:26,630
(Zhang Mengmeng's father)
Make way!

85
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:28,510
Mengmeng!

86
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:29,830
Officer!

87
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:31,070
That's my daughter!

88
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:32,130
(Zhang Mengmeng's stepmother)
Mengmeng.

89
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:34,900
Don't get worked up. Whatever it is,

90
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,310
come down and talk.

91
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:37,460
Please save her.

92
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:38,830
Shut up.

93
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:40,630
She's just putting on a show for us.

94
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:42,830
Zhang Mengmeng!

95
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,510
You ungrateful brat.

96
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,310
I've been through your age too.

97
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:47,630
I made you be with Wang Feiyu

98
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:49,140
for your own good.

99
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,870
Why are you forcing me?

100
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:54,830
Even if I die,
I won't let you have your way!

101
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:56,630
Come down and go home.

102
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:58,270
Stop making a scene here!

103
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,700
Think it through.

104
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:00,830
Mengmeng.

105
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:03,830
Miss.

106
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,690
Don't come any closer!

107
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:05,660
Stay calm.

108
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:06,270
Mengmeng.

109
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,460
Please don't act on impulse.

110
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,900
What exactly happened?

111
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:09,990
Talk to me, okay?

112
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:13,510
Alright.

113
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,220
If you don't want to talk now,

114
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,980
you can tell me later
when you feel like it.

115
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:17,580
Okay?

116
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:21,750
Officer.

117
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:25,390
I know you're a good person,

118
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,870
but I really

119
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:31,780
can't hold on anymore.

120
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:33,990
Mengmeng.

121
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,100
Trust me.

122
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:37,460
This will pass.

123
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:38,430
Come on.

124
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:39,990
Don't come any closer!

125
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:40,900
Okay.

126
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:41,750
I won't come closer.

127
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,020
Don't move, okay?

128
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:46,100
It's so high, aren't you scared?

129
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:46,900
Don't come over!

130
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:50,560
I'll sit with you for a while.

131
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:01,390
If you jump from this height,

132
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,190
it'll hurt a lot.

133
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:09,190
I know you've suffered.

134
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:11,580
You're not even 18 yet.

135
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:12,990
There's still a long road ahead.

136
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,630
You have such a bright future.

137
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,460
Whatever it is, we'll solve it together.

138
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:31,660
Come on, be good.

139
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:33,140
Talk to me.

140
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:33,870
Come down.

141
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:39,950
Is death really that scary?

142
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:43,190
I've never died before, so I don't know.

143
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:46,660
But I do know there's always
a solution to every problem.

144
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:47,700
You don't understand

145
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:48,990
the pain I've been through,

146
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:52,220
so you say that.

147
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:09,220
Officer.

148
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:13,220
I miss my mom.
