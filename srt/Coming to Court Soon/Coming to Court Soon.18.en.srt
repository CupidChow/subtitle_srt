00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,300
=Episode 18=

3
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:14,370
(That was written by Li Hai
with his left hand.)

4
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:15,990
(I've seen him write
with his left hand before.)

5
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:20,740
(Diary)

6
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:39,690
Mr. Ma.

7
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:40,990
Pleasure doing business with you.

8
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:42,130
Mr. Zhu.

9
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:43,420
Pleasure doing business with you.

10
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:46,380
Take care.

11
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:53,330
Hello?

12
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,900
Abandoned garage on Guangming Road.

13
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:57,900
Li Songyan is in my hands.

14
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:00,660
At noon, 500 thousand in cash.

15
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:01,850
No police.

16
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:03,300
Otherwise,

17
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,380
you'll never see your son again.

18
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:08,100
Kaixuan.

19
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:09,210
Is that you?

20
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:10,610
Hello?

21
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:11,130
Hello?

22
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:18,940
(It's been so many years.)

23
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:21,490
(I've never been able to let it go.)

24
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,800
(I really want to turn myself in.)

25
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,660
(But I can't bear to part)

26
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,500
(with everything I've earned.)

27
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:32,100
(Maybe this)

28
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,820
(is just a kind of selfishness.)

29
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:39,450
(Today, Songyan started to suspect me.)

30
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:41,780
(I made an anonymous letter)

31
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:42,730
(to deceive him.)

32
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,340
(Now I finally understand that one lie)

33
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:49,410
(requires countless lies to cover up.)

34
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:52,380
(I'm in more and more pain.)

35
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:05,940
Let me go!

36
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:07,130
Hurry up!

37
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:07,970
Let go of me!

38
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:10,570
My dad and Qinyang won't let you off!

39
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:11,570
Kid.

40
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,780
I've faced many hardships.

41
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:15,660
Do you think I'd be afraid?

42
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:17,290
I just want some money.

43
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:19,220
As soon as I get it, I'll let you go.

44
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:20,820
Even if I can't escape,

45
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:22,410
my dad and Qinyang will come to save me.

46
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:23,660
You've investigated for so long,

47
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:27,380
so you should know what
really happened back then.

48
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,660
Do you think Li Hai and Zhong Qinyang

49
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,010
could've worked together?

50
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,540
You've called me uncle for years.

51
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:35,850
I watched you grow up.

52
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:37,130
Don't worry.

53
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,940
As long as your dad pays the ransom,

54
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,170
I won't hurt you.

55
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,450
Has our family ever mistreated you?

56
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:47,390
I can't believe I called you uncle
for over ten years.

57
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:50,130
Turns out you're just an ingrate.

58
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,290
What did you say?

59
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:52,410
Li Songyan.

60
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:54,290
I saved Li Hai back then.

61
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:55,570
Now I'm drowning in debt,

62
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:57,390
and your dad only
gives me that measly salary.

63
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,380
What am I supposed to do?

64
00:03:58,820 --> 00:03:59,340
Back then,

65
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:00,730
he hit someone and ran.

66
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:01,990
He made me give false testimony.

67
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:04,170
I've lived in fear for over 20 years.

68
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:05,220
But him?

69
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:06,670
He acts like nothing ever happened.

70
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:08,170
A model entrepreneur,

71
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:09,500
and philanthropist.

72
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:10,730
And me?

73
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:12,220
I have nothing.

74
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:13,570
Without me,

75
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:15,820
Li Hai would've rotted in prison long ago.

76
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:17,010
Without me,

77
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:18,890
he wouldn't have what he has today.

78
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,100
Half of your dad's wealth
should be mine.

79
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:22,170
Oh,

80
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:23,730
and Zhong Qinyang.

81
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:25,450
If it weren't for you

82
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:26,330
and that Zhong Qinyang

83
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:27,820
digging into the past,

84
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:29,500
none of this would've happened.

85
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:31,300
Is that fair?

86
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:32,570
Is that fair?

87
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:46,090
Prosecutor Zhong.

88
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,210
Songyan has been kidnapped.

89
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,860
He's in the underground parking lot
on Guangming Road.

90
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:49,690
I called the police.

91
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:50,300
Please,

92
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:51,380
help me.

93
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:53,450
I'm on my way.

94
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:54,420
Alright.

95
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:55,620
Songyan, I'm sorry.

96
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,500
Songyan, I didn't mean to.

97
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:59,060
Songyan.

98
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,180
Songyan!

99
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,650
I didn't want this either.

100
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,060
I don't want to go to jail.

101
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:05,420
I just wanted to ask your dad
for a little money.

102
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:07,530
Just what I deserve.

103
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:08,570
I swear,

104
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:09,820
once I get the money,

105
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:11,010
I'll leave immediately.

106
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:12,570
Uncle Sun.

107
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,570
You can't escape.

108
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:15,620
Songyan.

109
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:16,880
You're different from your dad.

110
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:17,740
I think

111
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,260
you can understand me, right?

112
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,080
I was the one who helped
your dad back then.

113
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,770
This has nothing to do with me.

114
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:24,380
If someone breaks the law,

115
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:27,330
they'll be punished.

116
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:28,690
Shut up!

117
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,260
Shut up!

118
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:31,530
I didn't break the law!

119
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:32,980
I didn't!

120
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:44,090
Songyan.

121
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:46,130
Stop!

122
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,490
Songyan, don't be afraid.

123
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,180
I'm here.

124
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,650
No need for the father-son act now.

125
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:52,820
Where were you earlier?

126
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:54,420
So it really was you.

127
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,690
All those times it was you

128
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:57,820
who came asking for money.

129
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:58,450
That's right.

130
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,300
It was always me.

131
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:01,790
The money is here.

132
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:03,380
Just don't hurt Songyan.

133
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:04,380
Enough talk.

134
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:05,450
Throw the money over.

135
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:06,380
Throw it!

136
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:12,890
You got the money.

137
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,820
Now let Songyan go.

138
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:17,420
Mr. Li.

139
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:18,740
You said before,

140
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:21,260
we've known each other for 20 years.

141
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:23,380
Can't we have

142
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:24,300
a little chat?

143
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:26,530
What exactly do you want?

144
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:29,380
I want you to kneel in front of me

145
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:31,690
like a dog.

146
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:32,260
You...

147
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,090
Kneel!

148
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:40,330
Fine, I'll kneel.

149
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,090
Li Hai.

150
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:57,210
I never imagined

151
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,690
you'd end up like this.

152
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:03,130
This is between us.

153
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:04,530
Songyan is innocent.

154
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:05,740
Let him go.

155
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,460
You can do whatever you want with me.

156
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,380
I'm not done having fun yet.

157
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:10,980
Stop!

158
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:15,330
Perfect timing.

159
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:17,060
Zhong Qinyang.

160
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:19,380
I should've

161
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:20,690
killed you last time.

162
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:29,500
I never wanted it to come to this,

163
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:30,980
but you forced my hand.

164
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,820
If you catch Li Hai,

165
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:34,500
my golden goose is gone.

166
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,180
Zhong Qinyang.

167
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:43,380
You want to know the truth
about back then?

168
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:44,770
Today,

169
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:46,620
I'll tell you the truth.

170
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:48,180
Li Hai.

171
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:49,420
Today,

172
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:50,740
tell him

173
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:52,380
in front of everyone.

174
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:53,570
Back then,

175
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:56,380
how you destroyed his family.

176
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:57,323
And how

177
00:07:57,425 --> 00:07:58,740
you and Xue Biao

178
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,210
covered it all up.

179
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,054
Say it.

180
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,087
You hypocrite.

181
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:03,860
Fine.

182
00:08:06,181 --> 00:08:07,090
I'll say it.
