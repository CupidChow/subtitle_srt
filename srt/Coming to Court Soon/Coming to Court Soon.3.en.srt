Officer.

4
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:12,150
I miss my mom.

5
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:15,140
Zhang Mengmeng, come down now!

6
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,030
Zhang Mengmeng!

7
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:17,220
It's just a few hits.

8
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:19,420
Weren't you the one in the wrong first?

9
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:22,670
You never listen to me,

10
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:24,060
just like your father.

11
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:25,060
Stop talking!

12
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:26,950
Don't jump!

13
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:33,190
Come down,

14
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:34,860
and we'll talk things out.

15
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:41,830
Pull harder!

16
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:42,580
Lift her up!

17
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:43,420
Mengmeng!

18
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:49,550
Easy now, easy.

19
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:51,030
Come on.

20
00:01:58,580 --> 00:01:59,140
It's okay.

21
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:01,220
You're okay, Mengmeng.

22
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:02,340
You're okay.

23
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,580
You must never do something
this dangerous again, okay?

24
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,340
It's alright.

25
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:19,300
Mengmeng, are you okay?

26
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:20,110
Mengmeng.

27
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:22,270
How could you be so foolish?

28
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:24,670
What would I do
if something happened to you?

29
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:27,580
It's good you're okay.

30
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:29,230
Prosecutor.

31
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:31,460
I don't even know how to thank you.

32
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,390
If it weren't for you,
this child would've...

33
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,950
It's our duty.

34
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:38,790
But as her guardian,

35
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:41,700
you have an obligation to educate,
support and protect her.

36
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,350
You're right.

37
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:43,950
To truly help Mengmeng,

38
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:45,300
you must communicate with her more.

39
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:47,980
Of course.

40
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:50,830
We'll be more attentive from now on.

41
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:52,020
Zhang Mengmeng!

42
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:55,110
Stop acting all pitiful.

43
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,200
You dare to jump off a building, huh?

44
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,350
Do you know how much I lose
for taking a day off work?

45
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:00,550
Is this how you treat a child?

46
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,140
What does this have to do with you?

47
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,980
How I raise my child
is none of your business.

48
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:05,390
Can't you speak properly?

49
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:06,830
Is this any way to talk to a child?

50
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,310
Zhang Mengmeng, come home with me now!

51
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,110
Mengmeng.

52
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:09,510
Come on.

53
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,770
Stop crying! Come home with me.

54
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:11,300
Come on.

55
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:11,700
Song Su!

56
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:12,670
Mengmeng.

57
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:13,270
Su.

58
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:14,980
I'm really sorry.

59
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,580
There's definitely more
to Zhang Mengmeng's case.

60
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:22,350
Let's go back to the prosecution office.

61
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:25,630
You need to control your temper.

62
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,110
Don't argue with the family members.

63
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:29,900
It won't help us uncover the truth.

64
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:31,420
It only makes them more defensive.

65
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:43,830
Feeling awful?

66
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:45,980
I don't understand.

67
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:48,550
Mengmeng obviously jumped
because of her stepmother.

68
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:50,510
People like that should be locked up.

69
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:52,270
Calm down.

70
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:53,900
Come on.

71
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:56,270
Do we have to wait until
she commits a bigger crime?

72
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,630
Just take a breath.

73
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:01,350
Come with me.

74
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:08,460
Here.

75
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:09,550
Let it out.

76
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:13,900
You...

77
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:17,300

We're prosecutors.

83
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:52,950
We must uphold procedural justice

84
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:54,270
and substantive justice equally.

85
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:59,220
Procedural justice is an essential part
of fairness and impartiality.

86
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:00,830
We must ensure that justice

87
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:02,540
is seen as well as done.

following procedural justice

is our only choice.

(Case Management Center)

You needed to see me?

00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,020
Prosecutor Zhong.

96
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:21,270
Mengmeng's life has been hard.

97
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:23,390
Please take a look at this.

98
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:24,580
I'm begging you.

99
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:37,560
(Statement of Commitment)
Qinyang, you never fail to impress.

100
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:39,140
This is solid evidence.

101
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:40,340
How did you get it?

102
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:42,340
Mengmeng's father has been
working away from home for years.

103
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:44,190
He had no idea
about his daughter's suffering.

104
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:46,220
When he found out his wife took money

105
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,960
and forced Mengmeng
to change her statement,

106
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:48,570
he was furious.

107
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:49,540
They had a huge argument.

108
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,080
How could money be more important
than his daughter?

109
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:53,830
Exactly.

110
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:55,540
To seek justice for Mengmeng,

111
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:56,630
he gave me this statement.

112
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:00,390
At least she has a father

113
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:03,070
who understands and cares for her.

114
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:04,310
Keep it safe.

115
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:04,990
I will.

116
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:09,630
I've said it many times already.

117
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:11,100
I never hit Zhang Mengmeng.

118
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:13,390
She hurt herself to get my attention.

119
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:14,630
It was revenge.

120
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,340
She admitted it herself.

121
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:18,190
That's true.

122
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:21,870
But let me remind you.

123
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:24,850
Forcing Zhang Mengmeng
to give false statement is illegal.

124
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:25,830
I...

125
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:27,830
(Wang Feiyu's mother)

126
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,140
I only spoke the truth.

127
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,950
Accusing me of coercion

128
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:33,950
without evidence

129
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:35,750
is slander.

130
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:37,750
It's a personal attack,

131
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,540
and an insult to my character!

132
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:43,340
Wang Feiyu.

133
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:47,430
The law states that
honesty leads to leniency.

134
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:50,780
This statement of commitment

135
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:52,510
was written by
Zhang Mengmeng's stepmother.

136
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:53,830
It clearly states

137
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,540
that after receiving 50 thousand yuan

138
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,660
from your mother,

139
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:58,660
she forced Zhang Mengmeng

140
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,100
to twist the truth,

141
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:01,580
turning your abuse

142
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:03,140
into her so-called self-harm.

143
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:11,510
Now, are you ready to talk?

144
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:17,580
Prosecutor Zhong.

145
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:19,660
I've been waiting for you.

146
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,700
After that incident,

147
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,870
I realized you're a prosecutor.

148
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:28,510
You're Zhong Handong's son.

149
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:30,780
Your father and I

150
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,950
go way back.

151
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:42,780
If you break the law,

152
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:44,140
you'll leave behind evidence.

153
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:47,270
You can't hide forever.

154
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:49,700
Watch yourself.

155
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,390
Prosecutor Zhong.

156
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:53,460
One must speak

157
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,310
with evidence.

158
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:57,750
I just go

159
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,390
with the flow now.

160
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:00,900
That's fate.

161
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:03,140
Just like the person

162
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:06,700
who hit Prosecutor Zhong.

163
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:08,430
Wait,

164
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:11,220
I mean the person who hit your father.

165
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:12,510
He's been

166
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,310
in hiding all these years.

167
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,700
No one has ever found him.

168
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:18,220
That, too,

169
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,020
is fate.
