2
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,300
=Episode 17=

3
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:09,500
Qinyang.

4
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:10,500
You're back!

5
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:12,610
We were all so worried about you.

6
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:16,900
Sorry for making you worry.

7
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,050
How are you feeling?

8
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:19,300
Do you need a few more days?

9
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:22,410
Su.

10
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:25,570
Do you remember the car accident
we were in half a month ago?

11
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:27,900
Half a month ago...

12
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:29,260
I remember now.

13
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:30,610
You passed out that day.

14
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,610
I saw that driver recklessly speeding.

15
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,900
If you hadn't reacted quickly,

16
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,770
we both might've been hit.

17
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:37,820
Not might've been,

18
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:38,690
definitely.

19
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,130
What do you mean?

20
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:45,900
What's this?

21
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,300
Their target was me.

22
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:56,490
Someone involved in my parents'
car accident back then.

23
00:01:58,490 --> 00:01:59,450
His name is Sun Kaixuan.

24
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:07,380
(Lessee: Sun Kaixuan, Lessor: Li Jun)

25
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,310
I accidentally came across
Xue Biao's statement.

26
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:12,380
Xue Biao said that back then,
he had only one apprentice

27
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:13,330
named Sun Kaixuan.

28
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:15,570
But Li Songyan told me

29
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:18,170
Li Hai also worked as an apprentice
in Xue Biao's shop.

30
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,100
Why did Xue Biao hide this
from the police?

31
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:24,890
What role did Sun Kaixuan play
in all of this?

32
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:34,110
That day, the car emerged
from a blind spot at the intersection.

33
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:35,850
It looked like an accident.

34
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:38,570
So at first, I didn't think much of it.

35
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,290
But recently,

36
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:44,130
I feel like someone
has been watching me.

37
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,410
That's when I started to suspect.

38
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:50,730
Why?

39
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:54,890
Maybe they think I'm a threat to them.

40
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:00,690
At times like this,

41
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:04,220
it means we're getting closer
to the truth.

42
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:14,450
Old gambler.

43
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,710
What do you want from me again?

44
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:21,130
Li Hai.

45
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,340
Help me!

46
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:23,540
Li Hai.

47
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:26,500
I'm really in big trouble this time.

48
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,920
For the sake of the help
I gave you back then,

49
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:30,380
please, help me!

50
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:32,290
Give me three million.

51
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,410
You darn gambler.

52
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:38,780
So it's all about money in the end.

53
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:40,130
Over the years,

54
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:42,010
haven't I already given you enough?

55
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,290
I gave you 200 thousand
just a few days ago,

56
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,570
and you've already spent it all?

57
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:46,220
What?

58
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:48,890
Li Hai.

59
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:51,780
You need to explain right now.

60
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:54,130
When did I ever ask you for money?

61
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:55,730
You never asked me for money?

62
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:57,340
Besides you, who else knew about

63
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,500
what happened back then?

64
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,620
Sun Kaixuan.

65
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:19,620
I told you not to drive!

66
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,130
Now look what happened!

67
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:21,940
(Li Hai, 17 years old)

68
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:22,540
Sir.

69
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:23,940
Help me!

70
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:24,770
(Young Xue Biao)

71
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:25,330
Sir.

72
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:26,260
Help me!

73
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,060
I don't want to go to jail!

74
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,170
What are you panicking for?

75
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,090
There's no surveillance on Baishi Road.

76
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,260
No one knows it was you who hit them.

77
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,210
It's raining so heavily today.

78
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:41,180
There probably won't even be
tire tracks left behind.

79
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:43,130
The only problem now

80
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:44,260
is the car.

81
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:47,770
This is Mr. Sun's car.

82
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:49,690
The exhaust issue is easy to fix.

83
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,980
He wanted to modify his car anyway.

84
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:55,260
We'll fix it tonight
and have him pick it up tomorrow.

85
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,380
Leave the rest to me.

86
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,980
What are you standing there for?

87
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:07,130
Hurry up and fix the car!

88
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:09,060
I'll go check outside.

89
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:11,210
Sir.

90
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,450
Where are you going?

91
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:15,650
Don't leave me here alone.

92
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:19,650
If you don't fix this car,
we're both done for.

93
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:30,090
The shop's here.

94
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:31,450
I'm not going anywhere.

95
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,090
Just get to work.

96
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:24,890
Sir.

97
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,330
This is...

98
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:29,010
He's a buddy.

99
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:33,260
Kaixuan.

100
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:34,690
Now

101
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:35,890
you understand the situation.

102
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:39,380
A lot of people around here know
there's an apprentice in the shop.

103
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,570
Li Hai can't stay here anymore.

104
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,940
From now on, you're my apprentice.

105
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,010
You've been here
for two months now, understood?

106
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,620
(Young Sun Kaixuan, 18 years old)

107
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:50,890
I knew you'd be able
to keep a secret better than him.

108
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:57,890
Then I...

109
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:01,690
You can't stay here anymore.

110
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,770
Pack up and leave now.

111
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:05,500
Leave the rest

112
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:06,420
to me.

113
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:12,130
Sir.

114
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,090
Kaixuan.

115
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,820
I'll remember your kindness for life.

116
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:32,860
Be careful.

117
00:07:32,872 --> 00:07:34,820
(Xue's Auto Repair Shop)

118
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:37,380
Sir.

119
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:39,090
Officers.

120
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:40,980
We're investigating a traffic accident

121
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,390
and need to ask you a few questions.

122
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:44,980
Have a seat.

123
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:51,890
Where were you

124
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:53,650
between 10 and 12 PM
the night before last?

125
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:55,740
Can anyone vouch for you?

126
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:57,210
The night before.

127
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:58,890
The night before...

128
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,450
We were both in the shop.

129
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:03,180
On that day,

130
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:05,210
my cousin had a flat tire

131
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:06,260
and came in for repairs.

132
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:09,010
Lately, there have been
some real lowlifes around here

133
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:11,530
throwing nails on the ground
to steal business.

134
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:18,450
Sir.

135
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:20,380
Just the two of you

136
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:21,650
working here?

137
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:23,300
Just us two.

138
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:27,180
Then why do I see three uniforms
hanging on the wall?

139
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:31,180
Well...

140
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,130
This shop

141
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:36,860
was originally run by me and my wife.

142
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,500
Later, she left me
because I was poor.

143
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,990
I couldn't bring myself
to throw away her uniform,

144
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,770
so I kept it as a memento.

145
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:45,340
Alright.

146
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:46,530
Thanks for your cooperation.

147
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:48,500
If any Jinbei vans

148
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:49,620
come in for repairs,

149
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:51,170
contact us immediately.

150
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:51,930
Got it.

151
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,620
Then I'll leave you to it.

152
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:54,650
We're off.

153
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:55,460
Alright.

154
00:08:58,290 --> 00:08:59,700
Stop by for a discount next time.

155
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:08,170
Uncle.

156
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:10,050
What if the police

157
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:12,290
find out we lied?

158
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,190
What are you scared of?

159
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,990
We'll figure it out when the time comes.

160
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:17,990
He was the one who hit someone,

161
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:19,650
and we're taking the fall for him.

162
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:24,260
Li Hai is

163
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,290
a pitiful kid too.

164
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:29,380
Alright, go on.

165
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:47,580
All these years,

166
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:48,810
I keep wondering.

167
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:50,620
Back then,

168
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:52,500
should I have helped you?

169
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:53,980
Without me,

170
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:56,930
you wouldn't be where you are today.

171
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:00,580
You didn't bring me here

172
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:02,280
just for a trip down memory lane,
did you?
