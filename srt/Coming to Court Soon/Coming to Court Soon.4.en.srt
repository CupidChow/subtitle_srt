00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,300
=Episode 4=

3
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:00,790
Ma Haoda.

4
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:04,060
Do you know something?

5
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:06,740
Prosecutor.

6
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:09,550
Do you want to know who the culprit is?

7
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:13,190
Stop playing tricks.

8
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:15,190
What if I don't tell you?

9
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:16,670
Even if I knew,

10
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:19,310
I wouldn't tell you.

11
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,650
(Central Hospital)

12
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:42,620
When patients are hospitalized, have them
fill out a satisfaction survey.

13
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:42,980
Alright.

14
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:45,270
Dr. Wu.

15
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,950
Yes, the detailed information

16
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:50,750
and the guardian need to be filled.

17
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:51,470
Alright.

18
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:41,390
Mom, mom!

19
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:47,670
Mom.

20
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:56,140
Mom.

21
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:16,390
Hello, Su.

22
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:17,460
Hello, Qinyang.

23
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:18,300
Where are you?

24
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:19,580
I'll treat you to a meal.

25
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:21,070
Same place as usual.

26
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:22,110
Alright.

27
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:41,790
Okay.

28
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,010
Let's leave it at that for now.

29
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:44,140
Thank you.

30
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:50,460
Qinyang.

31
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:50,980
Over here.

32
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:55,510
You finally arrived.

33
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:58,110
What's the occasion?

34
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:59,390
Suddenly treating me to a meal?

35
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:00,390
Just a regular day.

36
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,630
Try this place.

37
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:13,950
How is it? Tastes good?

38
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:16,900
Not bad.

39
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:18,740
Um...

40
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,950
I want to discuss something with you.

41
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,390
I knew you had something to say.

42
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:27,700
Go on.

43
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:29,270
Here's the thing.

44
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:32,700
My third aunt came as a representative
to pressure me into marriage.

45
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,990
Can I hide at your place for a few days?

46
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:35,900
No.

47
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:40,750
Come on, you already ate.

48
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,390
How can you just leave me to suffer?

49
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:44,340
Besides, everyone knows you live alone.

50
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,990
Just make some space for me,

51
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:46,990
even the couch will do.

52
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:47,780
Still no.

53
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,630
But there's a place for rent downstairs.

54
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:57,510
If you need,

55
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:58,990
I can help you get a contact.

56
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:02,220
That works.

57
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:04,830
As long as I can escape this,

58
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:05,990
I can stay anywhere.

59
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:07,340
Thanks, Qinyang.

60
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,580
Do you like these?

61
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,340
I like them too.

62
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,220
Want more?

63
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,310
I have plenty at home.

64
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:37,900
(Zhou Qi, delinquent youth)
I can send them to you.

65
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,020
What's your home address again?

66
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,020
Let me check.

67
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:43,510
What do you want?

68
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,070
What do I want?

69
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:50,310
I'm a victim too.

70
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,100
Two months ago,

71
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,830
you said you needed money urgently.

72
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,990
I lent it to you without hesitation.

73
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:00,630
You said

74
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:02,750
you'd pay me back soon,

75
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:05,340
but you let me down.

76
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:08,950
Now you're saying
you have no money to pay.

77
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,310
I'm troubled too.

78
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:13,390
But I only borrowed 20 thousand.

79
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,990
How did it become 120 thousand?

80
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:17,390
Silly girl.

81
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:19,340
Loans come with interest.

82
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:20,990
I'm not scamming you.

83
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,340
Remember,

84
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:25,990
we have a contract.

85
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:33,220
I remember when you borrowed the money,

86
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:36,750
you said you wanted
to buy some nice clothes, right?

87
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:38,430
Yes.

88
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:40,020
You're so pretty,

89
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:43,390
so you should have what others have.

90
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:47,340
But now that you can't pay me back,

91
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,630
just return my clothes

92
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:52,390
to me.

93
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:20,750
Return my clothes

94
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,430
to me.

95
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:25,990
No!

96
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:41,100
(You're already an adult.)

97
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:44,220
(It's only natural to repay your debts.)

98
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,460
(You should understand that.)

99
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:47,140
(Also,)

100
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:49,190
(sign the new contract for me.)

101
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:52,100
(Otherwise, you'll regret it.)
