(Contact Person)

6
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:19,580
Li Hai.

7
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,700
Why are you in such a hurry?

8
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:22,060
I'm heading over now.

9
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:26,340
Who is it?

10
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:28,390
A client.

11
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:29,390
He's getting impatient.

12
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:30,790
(Lu Xiaoyan, Li Hai's wife)
I'm heading out.

13
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:32,700
It's so late. Let Mr. Sun drive you.

14
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:34,030
No need for a driver.

15
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:35,140
I can go by myself.

16
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,270
Trash bin.

17
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:18,460
I'm telling you,

18
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:19,860
this is the last time.

19
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:00,180
Mom.

20
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:04,300
I miss you so much.

(Li Songyan, Li Hai's son)

22
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:29,350
(Little brat.)

23
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:31,020
(She's your mother.)

24
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:32,350
(She's not my mother.)

25
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:33,180
(Shameless.)

26
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,630
Watch your mouth!

27
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:37,510
(Li Hai, all you do is hit me.)

28
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:41,350
(Do you really forget
what day it is today?)

29
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:52,300
Recently,

30
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:55,300
the city has increased inspections
against drunk driving

31
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:56,830
and other traffic violations.

32
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:57,460
Tonight,

33
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:59,550
multiple departments
are jointly executing

34
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,420
surprise checks at key road sections.

35
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,180
Hello. Drunk driving inspection.

36
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:21,050
Please blow into this.

37
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:23,140
Thank you, drive safely.

38
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:28,830
Hello. Drunk driving inspection.

39
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,690
Please blow into this.

40
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:34,100
Hello.

41
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:35,390
Please blow into this.

42
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,890
Now, please turn off the engine
and step out of the vehicle.

43
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,190
Cooperate with our alcohol test.

44

Otherwise, we'll take actions.

45
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:46,460

Please step out of the vehicle.

49
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:55,340
This is my police badge.

50
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:57,390
Final warning,
please step out of the vehicle.

51
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,140
Get out of the car.

52
00:04:58,390 --> 00:04:58,700
Get out!

53
00:04:58,870 --> 00:04:59,750
Don't touch me!

54
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:00,270
Get out!

55
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:05,870
Don't touch me!

56
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:06,700
Calm down.

57
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:07,460
Calm down.

58
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,750
You need to calm down.

59
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:12,510
Can you cooperate with our alcohol test?

60
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:13,870
Whatever.

61
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,020
You're suspected of drunk driving.

62
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:20,700
Now,

63
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,900
please cooperate with further testing.

64
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:23,830
Come with us.

65
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:25,190
Don't touch me!

66
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:26,020
Don't move.

67
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:28,540
Don't move.

68
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:29,630
Don't move.

69
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:30,630
Let go of me!

70
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:33,270
Don't touch me!

71
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,310
Let go of me!

72
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:36,020
Don't touch me!

73
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:38,580
(At 8:10 tonight,)

74
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,950
(a well-known local businessman's son)

75
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:43,310
(was arrested by police
for unlicensed driving,)

76
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:45,320
(drunk driving, and assaulting
police officers.)

77
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:59,060
(48 hours later)

78
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:00,020
Li Songyan.

79
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:00,810
Your family is here.

80
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:01,510
Come with me.

81
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:03,360
The situation is quite serious.

82
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:04,950
Unlicensed driving, drunk driving,

83
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:06,700
and even resisting law enforcement.

84
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:08,360
Considering he's still in school,

85
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:10,070
we agree to grant him
bail pending trial.

86
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,370
(Upholding justice for the public)
Sorry for the trouble.

87
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:13,190
My son has caused you all
a lot of trouble.

88
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,980
Going forward, you must fully cooperate
with the prosecutor's office.

89
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,720
Make sure he's available
whenever summoned.

90
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,580
Understood. Thank you.

91
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:21,950
Let's go.

92
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:22,920
We'll settle this when we get home.

93
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:23,510
Don't touch me!

94
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:25,340
Aren't you supposed to be tough?

95
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:27,510
If you're really tough,
don't call me to come get you.

96
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:29,140
I've never been so humiliated
in my life!

97
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,190
Who begged you to come?

98
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,220
What are you doing?

99
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:33,700
Even if he's your son,

100
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:34,970
hitting him is against the law.

101
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,540
Mr. Li, I have to say.

102
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:38,660
(Public Security Bureau)
As a well-known businessman,

103
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:40,950
how can you educate
your child with violence?

104
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:42,990
Alright, thank you.

105
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,990
From today on, stay home.

106
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:02,340
You're not allowed to go anywhere.

107
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:37,820
(Stay true to our mission,
keep our purpose in mind)

108
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:38,870
Qinyang.

109
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:42,340
The Li Songyan case stirred up
quite a commotion.

110
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:43,340
It's all over the news.

111
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:45,390
People say all kinds of things.

112
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:47,210
Some even say
we must investigate his father.

113
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:50,700
Su.

114
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:52,090
We're prosecutors.

115
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:53,390
We must make objective judgments.

116
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:56,140
(Personal File Form)

117
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:00,020
Alright, you can summon him now.

118
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,630
I have a meeting in the afternoon.

119
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:08,580
Later, when the prosecutors
ask questions,

120
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:09,570
just answer them quickly.

121
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,270
Understood?

122
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:12,430
I've already said everything
at the police station.

123
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,540
What else is there to say?

124
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:14,430
Don't act so arrogant.

125
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:16,700
Li Songyan, right?

126
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:18,220
It's you.

127
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:20,310
You know me?

128
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:24,140
Alright, let's begin.

129
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:25,310
Prosecutors.

130
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:26,310
I sincerely apologize.

131
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,660
I have an important meeting now.

132
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:28,700
This is my lawyer.

133
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:29,970
Can I let my lawyer handle this?

134
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:31,950
A lawyer is fine.

135
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:33,310
But it's best if you...

136
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:34,020
Sorry.

137
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:36,020
I really don't have the time.

138
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:47,510
Su.

139
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:48,870
Take them inside first.

140
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:49,350
Alright.

141
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:50,510
This way.

142
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,110
Mr. Li.

143
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,270
Have we met before?

144
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,020
A lot of people say that to me.

145
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:04,900
I have a common face.

146
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,060
I look like everyone.

147
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:13,590
Mr. Wang.

148
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:15,020
Wait for me.

149
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:15,990
I'm coming over now.

150
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:19,470
