=Episode 12=

3
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,300
Your choice of clothes
for me is way too soft.

4
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:02,910
Looks good.

5
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:04,870
Qinyang.

6
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:06,980
Don't be nervous
when you meet my aunt later.

7
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:09,620
Just put on your prosecutor's demeanor,

8
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:10,740
treat her like a suspect,

9
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:11,740
and make her back off.

10
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:13,190
Is that how you describe an elder?

11
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:15,190
She's urging you to get married
for your own good.

12
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:17,340
I think you two need a proper talk.

13
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:19,310
You can't keep

14
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:20,190
bluffing forever.

15
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:43,340
Qinyang.

16
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:46,910
I'm okay.

17
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:55,420
Qinyang, are you alright?
Are you having low blood sugar again?

18
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:58,700
I'm fine. Just need a moment.

19
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:01,190
People drive

20
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:02,750
so recklessly these days.

21
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:08,220
My third aunt left.

22
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:10,780
I'm sorry.

23
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:12,110
I missed our meeting with her.

24
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,220
It's okay, Qinyang.

25
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:16,390
But do you need to go to the hospital?

26
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:18,630
I'm fine. I just need to rest.

27
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:20,300
Alright.

28
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:39,390
Who is it?

29
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,320
What are you doing here again?

30
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,670
Is Prosecutor Zhong home?

31
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,720
Are you looking for Brother Zhong?

32
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:56,390
He hasn't been staying here recently.

33
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:13,140
What's going on?
You're acting all mysterious.

34
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:15,580
Songyan.

35
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,300
Your dad received a threat letter.

36
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:20,460
You should listen to him

37
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:21,420
and go abroad.

38
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:36,630
What are you guys trying to do?

39
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:38,860
First a kidnapping,

40
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,000
and now a fake threat letter?

41
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:42,640
This handwriting is obviously Li Hai's.

42
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:44,670
No way.

43
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,110
I know your dad's handwriting.

44
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,960
That was written with his left hand.

45
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,790
I've seen him write
with his left hand before.

46
00:03:58,580 --> 00:03:59,180
Come on.

47
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:01,420
What exactly is Li Hai up to?

48
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:04,020
Did he do something illegal?

49
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:05,980
Is he forging a threat letter

50
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,460
to send me abroad and escape?

51
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,740
Songyan, your dad isn't like that.

52
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:18,110
Real or fake,

53
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,800
you better stay indoors for a few days.

54
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:23,740
This is a prosecutor's house,

55
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,390
so it should be safe.

56
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:30,510
Why are you helping me?

57
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:33,700
What are you saying?

58
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:35,580
We're family.

59
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:42,070
Thank you.

60
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:48,870
Lu...

61
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:50,140
Aunt Lu.

62
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:56,950

I know

70
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,510
your hand must be really strong

71

this round.

72
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:38,830
But,

73
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:39,870
sorry,

74
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:43,460
I'm winning
with this Fifty Thousand.

75
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:50,580
Setting me up, huh?

76
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:53,950
Impossible.

77
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:56,900
Pure suit, waiting on one tile.

78
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,200
Playing Fifty Thousand.

79
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:59,750
Right, Uncle Xue?

80

Let's go again.

81
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:07,870
Come on.

82

83

(Mortgage Contract)

84
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:37,750
I gambled for you.

85
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:39,340
As we agreed,

86
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:40,870
Zhou Qi's 120 thousand debt

87
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:42,900
is cleared.

88
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:00,630
Alright.

89
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:02,950
That 120 thousand

90
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:04,830
is wiped clean.

91
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:09,310
Thank you, Mr. Ma.

92
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:10,980
If there's nothing else,
we'll be leaving.

93
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:12,660
Wait.

94
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,480
Are you going back on your word?

95
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,630
What are you saying?

96
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:20,510
I value

97
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,870
integrity the most.

98
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:25,140
That 120 thousand

99
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:26,830
is settled.

100
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:30,540
But

101
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:34,460
Zhou Qi owes us

102
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:37,020
far more than that.

103
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:38,950
How is that possible?

104
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:40,220
It was only 120 thousand.

105
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:42,340
Really?

106
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:44,700
That was last week's price.

107
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:46,020
Today,

108
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:47,900
it's a lot more.

109
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,140
What do you want?

110
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,660
Debts must be repaid.

111
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:54,100
It's only fair.

112
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:00,390
