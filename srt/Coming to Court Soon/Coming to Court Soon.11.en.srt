3
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:01,190
Prosecutor Zhong.

4
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:03,380
This whole thing is my fault.

5
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:05,280
I shouldn't have hit him.

6
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:06,470
And even more so,

7
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,760
I shouldn't send him abroad
without informing you.

8
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:10,060
I was too impatient.

9
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:11,190
I'm sorry.

10
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:13,440
I haven't been able to sleep recently.

11
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:15,800
Even in my dreams,
I've been reflecting on my mistakes.

12
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:19,220
As a parent,

13
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,840
you need to regulate your behavior.

14
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:23,910
I hope you'll remind yourself
in the future

15
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:26,270
and respect your child's wishes.

16
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:28,140
That's true.

17
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:29,550
You're absolutely right.

18
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:31,190
But it's a shame.

19
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,310
He doesn't understand my intentions.

20
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,420
You said you had your reasons.

21
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:45,140
If you can't tell him,

22
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:46,550
maybe you can tell me?

23
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:49,270
My reasons?

24
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:50,670
I just want the best for him.

25
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:52,340
Sending him abroad
would open more doors.

26
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:53,980
But he just doesn't see how much I care.

27
00:01:58,580 --> 00:01:59,340
Prosecutor Zhong.

28
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:01,220
You've done so much for my family.

29
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:02,140
Thank you.

30
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,750
I should be the one saying thanks.

31
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:07,910
I just found out recently.

32
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,190
Without your financial help,

33
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:11,340
my father couldn't have received
such good treatment.

34
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,340
Thank you.

35
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:13,950
It's nothing.

36
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,220
It's my honor to contribute

37
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,230
to charity.

38
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,300
Alright, I'll get going now.

39
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:32,510
Li Hai really went too far.

40
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,860
He kidnapped me just to send me abroad.

41
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:36,900
Now I understand.

42
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,230
When I have a stepmother,
my father wouldn't be the same.

43
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,420
Studying abroad is great.

44
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:42,980
So many want to go but can't afford it.

45
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:45,630
Why are you siding with him?

46
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,520
I'd rather learn
how to fix cars with you.

47
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:52,110
You've never suffered
from a lack of money.

48
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:53,230
When you grow up,

49
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:55,860
you'll understand how important it is.

50
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:56,860
Pass me the wrench.

51
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:04,220
(Young Li Hai, 17 years old)

52
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:12,790
Sir Xue.

53
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:14,510
Sir Xue.

54
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:21,020
Why do you sound like Li Hai?
Always talking about money.

55
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:21,790
Tacky.

56
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:22,830
Very tacky.

57
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:23,840
I think you should

58
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:25,740
study hard and get into a good college.

59
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,700
Don't end up like your dad,
full of regret.

60
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:43,180
This drumstick is for
Zhang Mengmeng's case last time.

61
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:47,670
So stingy.

62
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:55,300
Her case may be over,

63
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:56,790
but her father told me

64
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:59,020
she's suffering from PTSD.

65
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,740
She needs time to adjust
to her new school.

66
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,680
Her mother passed away early,

67
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,280
and her stepmother treated her terribly.

68
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:09,950
She's had it rough.

69
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:14,550
Li Songyan isn't having
an easy time either.

70
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:20,700
Didn't you used to complain
about that kid all the time?

71
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:23,700
Now you're suddenly defending him?

72
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,340
Times change.

73
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:27,220
People grow.

74
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,220
I used to be

75
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:30,340
so short-sighted,

76
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,270
but thanks to your guidance,

77
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:33,870
I've matured.

78
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,020
Here, have some meat.

79
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:36,990
Enough flattery.

80
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:40,320
Did you finish organizing the files
from this morning?

81
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:44,630
Almost done.

82
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:45,700
Almost done.

83
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:54,900
Hello.

84
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:55,950
Songyan.

85
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:57,660
Let's have dinner with Qinyang tonight.

86
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:58,870
Songyan?

87
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:00,950
Okay.

88
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:07,630
I brought you something.

89
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:13,220
I'll bring it up.

90
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:23,660
Songyan.

91
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:28,990
Here are your clothes
and daily necessities.

92
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:31,560
Staying at someone else's place
must be uncomfortable.

93
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:33,460
See if you need anything else.

94
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:35,830
Did Li Hai send you?

95
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:39,630
I know everything

96
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:41,070
that happened yesterday.

97
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,390
This has nothing to do with you.

98
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,540
You don't need to explain.

99
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,040
If there's nothing else, you can go.

100
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:49,460
Songyan.

101
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,100
Don't blame your dad.

102
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:52,630
Maybe he has his own reasons.

103
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:54,460
Reasons?

104
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:55,950
You all have your reasons,

105
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,560
so that justifies everything you do?

106
00:05:59,390 --> 00:05:59,990
Just go.

107
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:06,950
Alright.

108
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,310
If you need anything, let me know.

109
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,270
You didn't call us here for this, right?

110
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:32,870
This place is famous.

111
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:34,390
One bite, and you'll gain two pounds.

112
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:36,140
Two pounds per bite?

113
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:39,390
Because once you start, you can't stop.

114
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:41,390
Come on, spill it.

115
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:45,580
You know me too well, Qinyang.

116
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:47,140
So, well.

117
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:48,990
My third aunt is leaving soon.

118
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:51,190
That's good news.

119
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:53,340
It's just...

120
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:56,950
Before she goes,
she wants to meet my boyfriend.

121
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,340
Spitting it out still counts as eating.

122
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:03,870
Keep going.

123
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:07,540
I may have told her

124
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:08,990
I already had a boyfriend.

125
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:10,950
If she finds out I was lying,

126
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:12,020
I'm done for.

127
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:14,430
And I only know you two in Qinzhong.

128
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:15,460
I'll go.

129
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,200
Lying to elders isn't right.

130
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:20,270
I was just trying to help Su.

131
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:22,190
Kids shouldn't lie,

132
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:24,750
right, Qinyang?

133
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:28,660
Here,

134
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:29,700
eat more.

135
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:48,630
I saw Songyan today.

136
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,070
He's still angry.

137
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:53,220
That kid is never happy.

138
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:56,780
Tell me the truth.

139
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:58,950
Why do you have to send him abroad?

140
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:01,510
This was kidnapping.

141
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:08,630
What's really going on?

142
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,270
Tell me.

143
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,680
I knew I couldn't hide it from you.

144
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,270
I received a threat.

145
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,960
(Withdraw from the Nancheng project bid,
or your son will be in danger.)

146
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:47,040
Call the police.

147
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:48,540
Right now.

148
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:49,110
No.

149
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:50,820
They haven't made a move yet.

150
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,120
Reporting it now won't help.

151
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:54,300
We should just stay on guard.

152
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:58,780
Then listen to him.

153
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:00,350
Withdraw from the bid.

154
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,840
That will only make them push harder.

155
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,140
If Songyan finds out,
he'll be in even greater danger.

156
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:06,300
What do we do then?

157
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:10,020
So now you understand

158
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:12,180
why I'm so desperate to send him abroad.
