=Episode 8=

3
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:11,790
Seven Circles.

4
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:12,550
I win.

5
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:19,060
I'm done.

6
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:21,910
Kid, good job.

7
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:23,830
You're pretty sharp.

8
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:26,390
I hope you win like this next week.

9
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:27,190
You said it.

10
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:28,420
If I win,

11
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:30,910
the debt between Zhou Qi

12
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:31,950
and you is settled.

13
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:35,110
Zhou Qi.

14
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:39,140
Feels good to have someone
stand up for you, huh?

15
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,030
If you lose, though...

16
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:45,750
Don't worry.

17
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,310
I won't lose.

18
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:51,390
I like your confidence.

19
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:53,550
Your opponent

20
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:55,310
is Xue Biao.

21
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:56,950
I'll have someone help you

22
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:58,420
when the time comes.

23
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:07,580
You're sending me abroad

24
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,950
just to avoid the shame of me
failing the exams, aren't you?

25
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:11,700
Li Songyan.

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,850
You're going abroad
whether you like it or not.

27
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,700
If you don't want the U.S.,
go to the U.K.

28
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:17,410
If you don't like the U.K.,
then Australia.

29
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:18,460
Stop acting like a child.

30
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:20,020
Why must I go abroad?

31
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,670
I'd rather learn from Sir Xue.

32
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,130
Do you know what kind
of person Xue Biao is?

33
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:26,380
And what kind of person you are?

34
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,700
What can you learn
by following him around?

35
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,460
Street racing?

36
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:30,460
Getting into the news?

37
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:31,550
What's wrong with Sir Xue?

38
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,460
He makes a living with his skills.

39
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,590
If you keep hanging around with him,

40
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:36,580
I'll break your legs.

41
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:39,670
What are you two arguing about?

42
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:41,020
The neighbors can hear you.

43
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:42,450
Hai.

44
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:43,790
Can't you talk to your son calmly?

45
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:44,990
What kind of attitude is that?

46
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:47,140
Don't act like the good guy.

47
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:48,990
This idea of sending me abroad
was probably yours.

48
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:49,420
You...

49
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:50,700
Come on.

50
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:51,390
Slap me.

51
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:57,230
Fine.

52
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:58,510
If you won't choose,

53
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,140
I'll choose for you.

54
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,300
From today until you leave for abroad,

55
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,790
you'll stay in your room and reflect.

56
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:06,470
You're not allowed to go anywhere.

57
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:10,140
Songyan.

58
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:44,900
(Prosecutor Zhong,
I argued with Li Hai again.)

59
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:51,110
(I really don't know what to do.)

60
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:55,110
(I have nowhere to go.)

61
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:58,270
Watch out!

62
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:13,700
When do you plan to pick him up?

63
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:17,300
Prosecutor Zhong, I'm on my way.

64
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:18,700
I'm not going back.

65
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,390
If you dare to pick me up,

66
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:21,740
you'll never see me again.

67
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:23,550
Li Songyan...

68
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:25,950
I don't want this kid anymore.

69
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:27,140
Prosecutor Zhong.

70
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,390
Let him figure it out himself.

71
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:44,830
Don't touch it.

72
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:47,070
Brother.

73
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,580
The uniform doesn't look like yours.

74
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:50,700
Why is it hanging here?

75
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:55,340
It was my dad's.

76
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:58,490
I didn't expect you to come
from a family of prosecutors.

77
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:00,100
Is your father still a prosecutor?

78
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:02,870
No.

79
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:09,200
My parents were in a car accident
a long time ago.

80
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:10,830
The culprit still hasn't been found.

81
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,020
I'm sorry.

82
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:16,780
I didn't know.

83
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:33,070
Kaixuan.

84
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:36,220
Thank you for staying with me so late.

85
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:38,460
Mr. Li, don't mention it.

86
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:40,790
(Li Hai's driver, Sun Kaixuan)
You've taken care of me all these years.

87
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,700
We've been friends for over 20 years.

88
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:45,630
There's no need for formalities.

89
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:48,070
Mr. Li, why not let him stay
for a few days?

90
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:52,310
Looks like that's the only way for now.

91
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:55,070
Let's go.

92
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:06,900
Brother.

93
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:10,750
What now?

94
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:12,580
Did you find the culprit?

95
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:22,100
(Wu's Auto Shop, secondhand car,
headlight investigation)

96
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,270
This is the only clue?

97
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:29,630
This has nothing to do with you.

98
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:30,390
Get some sleep.

99
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:32,870
There's an old saying,

100
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:33,990
if someone feeds you,

101
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:34,990
you owe them.

102
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:36,700
Don't worry.

103
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:37,510
With me here,

104
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:38,630
I'll help you find them.

105
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:46,900
Square headlights.

106
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:48,830
Protruding front end.

107
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,270
High beams focused

108
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:53,580
at the center.

109
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,460
Intense brightness.

110
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:57,660
It must be

111
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,430
the first-generation Jinbei van,

112
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,540
China's first world-class vehicle,

113
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:03,460
produced through CKD assembly
in the 90s.

114
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:07,630
You even recognize such an old car?

115
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,310
Of course.

116
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:12,580
I know everything about cars
and even auto parts.

117
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:16,190
Alright. Go study.

118
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:18,660
Don't underestimate me.

119
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:20,780
I grew up around Sir Xue.

120
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:22,580
Back in his day, he was known

121
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,380
as one of the "Thirteen Young Masters"
in the trade.

122
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:25,790
There wasn't a car he couldn't fix.

123
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,190
My dad used to work for him.

124
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:29,430
His day?

125
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:30,510
And now?

126
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:34,430
Me.

127
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:38,220
Seems like you do this often.

128
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,990
I still have homework to do.

129
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:43,990
See you.
