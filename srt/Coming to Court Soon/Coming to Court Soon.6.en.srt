(Personal File Form)

6
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:15,550
That day, you took on
a dozen punks by yourself.

7
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:16,470
I was there.

8
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:20,860
That was so cool.

9
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:25,470
Tell me.

10
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:27,110
Why were you drunk driving?

11
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:29,340
Why did you hit the police officers?

12
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:33,750
It's all because of Li Hai.

13
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:35,220
How is it?

14
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:36,750
Do I look even better

15
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:37,780
in this outfit?

16
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,340
It's chilly outside at night.

17

Don't take off your coat.

18

Now you realize it?

20
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:54,580
Wretched woman.

21
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:55,950

22

23

Are you itching for a beating again?

24
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,310
You little brat, listen up.

25
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:01,750
She's your elder.

26
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,480
She's your mother!

27
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:03,750
She isn't my mother!

28
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,580
She's only a few years older than me,

29
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:06,900
and you want me to call her mom?

30
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:07,830
Shameless!

31
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,910
What nonsense are you spouting?

32
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,500
He forgot my mom's anniversary.

33
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:26,740
Songyan.

34
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:30,020
No matter what, speaking to your father
like that is wrong.

35
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:33,180
You should learn
to control your emotions.

36
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:35,460
Learn to communicate with your father.

37
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:37,630
But he's so stubborn and rigid.

38
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,540
How am I supposed to...

39
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:40,280
You're thinking of giving up
before even trying?

40
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:40,800
But Li Hai...

41
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:43,310
If you choose to give up, I understand.

42
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,170
After all, your father is
an outstanding man.

43
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,510
He's a well-known entrepreneur,

44
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:47,350
and a philanthropist.

45
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:48,950
He built Tonghai Logistics

46
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,460
from the ground up.

47
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:52,950
Who's giving up?

48
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:54,900
But...

49
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:56,740
Can I really do it?

50
00:02:58,950 --> 00:02:59,860
I get it now.

51
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:02,790
What I need to do isn't
to prove that he's wrong,

52
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:04,390
but to prove that I'm right.

53
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:07,180
Alright.

54
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:08,950

55

74
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:28,900
I just borrowed from a loan shark.

75

79
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:35,580
A hundred thousand isn't a small amount.

80
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,540
Give me a few days.

81
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:38,950
