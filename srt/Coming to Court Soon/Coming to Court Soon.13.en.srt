go to Black Mamba and find Huang Xian.)

Listen to me.

A friend of mine, Deng Xing,

13
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:27,050
might be in some trouble.

14
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:27,770
What?

15
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,370
Can you come with me to check on him?

16
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:30,330
I'm a bit worried

17
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:31,740
but don't dare tell Qinyang.

18
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:32,790
Give me a moment.

19
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,090
Do you have any evidence?

20
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:47,020
I don't,

21
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:48,570
but I know someone

22
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:49,490
who does.

Black Mamba's owner, Ma Haoda,
and his subordinate, Huang Xian.

25
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:56,330
But he's a thug.

26
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:57,300
How about this?

27
00:01:57,610 --> 00:01:59,100
Take me to him after work today.

28
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:00,330

32
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:18,890
suddenly want to look at the records?

33

There's a charity gala in a few days.

34

00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,570
also one of our beneficiaries?

39
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:41,670
He's been on the list for a long time.

40
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:44,450
He's one of the earliest

Bye.

00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,330
This is my fault.

97
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:18,090

Retrieval Notice?

As an assistant prosecutor,

113
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:54,980
if you can't respect the power
in your hands,

114
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:57,500
if you don't have
a clear understanding of your role,

115
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:00,010
if you can't handle cases
objectively and fairly,

116
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:02,380
it'll shake the public's

117
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,890
trust in the judicial system

118
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:05,990
and lead to the collapse
of judicial integrity.

119
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:08,010

that uniform now.
