00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,540
=Coming to Court Soon=

2
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,300
=Episode 19=

3
00:00:59,140 --> 00:00:59,580
Back then,

4
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:02,370
how did you destroy his family?

5
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:04,730
And how did you and Xue Biao

6
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:05,820
cover it all up?

7
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:06,690
Speak!

8
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:07,900
You hypocrite!

9
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:09,860
Fine.

10
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:12,490
I'll talk.

11
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:14,410
Back then,

12
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:16,380
I remember I was about to turn 18.

13
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:17,610
I had just learned to drive,

14
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,570
and I kept pestering Xue Biao
to let me practice.

15
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:21,740
It just so happened that
the shop had repaired a van.

16
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:28,490
Slow down.

17
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:29,380
It's raining heavily.

18
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:30,570
It's fine.

19
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:31,490
Trust me, master.

20
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:32,300
A car!

21
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:33,570
Brake!

22
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:36,770
The rain pounded against the windshield,

23
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:38,610
and I couldn't see anything.

24
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:41,380
By the time I reacted,

25
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:42,990
it was already too late.

26
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:48,020
I was terrified.

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,100
What should we do, master?

28
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:53,820
What do we do now?

29
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:55,570
Do you want to spend your life in jail?

30
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:58,570
Go.

31
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:02,260
Hurry!

32
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:05,100
I saw two people

33
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,610
lying motionless in a pool of blood.

34
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,330
I was so scared.

35
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,430
I didn't want to go to jail.

36
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:10,900
Xue Biao told me to run,

37
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:13,260
and without thinking, I ran.

38
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,100
Now I know I was wrong.

39
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:16,660
I know I was wrong.

40
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:18,220
I regret it deeply.

41
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:20,710
If I had sent them
to the hospital back then,

42
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:21,820
maybe...

43
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:26,220
maybe things would've
turned out differently.

44
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:28,500
Zhong Qinyang.

45
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:31,290
This is the truth you wanted.

46
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:32,450
Sun Kaixuan.

47
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:35,450
You won't escape today.

48
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:44,260
Stop!

49
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:49,220
Li Songyan!

50
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:33,820
Hurry!

51
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:34,540
Hurry!

52
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:47,320
Cut open the clothes.
Prepare for surgery!

53
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:13,940
Xue Biao, right?

54
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,290
Someone reported that

55
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,290
you were involved
in the Baishi Road car accident.

56
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:18,890

57
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,210

Yes, that's me.

00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:32,690
