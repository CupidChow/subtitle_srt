=Episode 15=

3
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:03,270
What did you cook today?
It smells so good.

4
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:05,340
Songyan came back today.

5
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:06,380
Go ahead.

6
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:07,790
I have one more dish to make.

7
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,150
Finally willing to come home.

8
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:16,550
Still mad at me?

9
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:18,030
In the past,

10
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:19,780
if I did anything wrong,

11
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:21,340
be more understanding.

12
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:23,830
Don't you like Transformer figures?

13
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:26,110
I had someone order it
from abroad for you.

14
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:27,470
The latest model.

15
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:31,140
I came home today

16
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:32,340
to ask you,

17
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:33,780
are you colorblind or not?

18
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:37,060
It's rare that you care about me.

19
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,310
It deserves praise.

20
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:40,780
Watch me show you something.

21
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:42,670
Red.

22
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:44,340
Green.

23
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:46,030
Correct?

24
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:49,580
If you're not colorblind,

25
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:50,880
then Zhong Handong...

26
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:52,030
Technology has advanced

27
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:53,470
a lot nowadays.

28
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:55,190
A friend recommended me

29
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:57,110
a high-tech contact lens from abroad.

30
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:58,060
Wearing it

31
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:00,110
corrects my red-green color blindness.

32
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:03,390
Look.

33
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:08,030
Here,

34
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:08,830
last dish.

35
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:12,980
Eat.

36
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:13,980
Dig in.

37
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:16,350
Eat more meat.

38
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:17,420
It's all your favorite.

39
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:18,420
Come on,

40
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:19,460
eat more.

41
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:21,270
That was amazing.

42
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,550
You don't even know
how cool you were, Qinyang.

43
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:25,310
Annual Model Prosecutor.

44
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,180
This is the top award
of the prosecution world.

45
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:29,210
If it weren't for your assistance,

46
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:31,110
this case wouldn't have
progressed so smoothly.

47
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:34,140
So this award belongs to you too.

48
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:35,980
Thank you, Qinyang.

49
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:37,180
I'll work even harder.

50
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:39,980
(Honorary Certificate)

51
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:40,980
(Annual Model Prosecutor)
Think about what to eat tonight,

52
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:41,580
my treat.

53
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:42,300
Well.

54
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:44,300
I did contribute a little.

55
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:45,860
What should I eat?

56
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:47,740
Hotpot!

57
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:48,900
Qinyang.

58
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:49,740
Hotpot!

59
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:50,700
Let's eat hotpot.

60
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,140
Alright, whatever you say.

61
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:55,670
Dad.

62
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:58,110
With those contact lenses,

63
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:59,550
you can get a driver's license now?

64
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:01,670
At my age?

65
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:02,670
Besides,

66
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:04,390
if I learn to drive,

67
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:05,300
won't Uncle Sun

68
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,700
have to pack up and leave?

69
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:38,420
(Yang)

70
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:40,420
Hello, Yang.

71
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,500
Qinyang, Uncle Zhong's condition
isn't stable.

72
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:43,380
Come over right away.

73
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:44,630
Alright, I'm on my way.

74
00:03:58,390 --> 00:03:59,070
Qinyang.

75
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:00,420
Su.

76
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:01,750
I have something urgent.

77
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,230
I can't have dinner with you tonight.

78
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:04,210
Go eat with your friends.

79
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,200
I'll reimburse you later.

80
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,270
Alright then, go do your thing.

81
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,190
Didn't you say you were
making Qinyang pay?

82
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,020
How can you brush me off
with just skewers?

83
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:37,700
I want seafood.

84
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:39,750
Be grateful for what you get.

85
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:42,220
Qinyang left in such a hurry.

86
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:43,340
It must be urgent.

87
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:46,270
Could he be secretly

88
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,900
investigating the culprit?

89
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:52,580
Do you think

90
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:54,070
he's already found the culprit?

91
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:00,190
Qinyang always follows
the law and procedures.

92
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,390
Even if he found the culprit,

93
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,430
he'd definitely handle it by the book.

94
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:12,660
What are you thinking about?

95
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:13,190
Just eat.

96
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:29,340
Has studying been tough lately?

97
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:30,870
Piece of cake.

98
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:33,270
Su.

99
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:35,510
You don't have to walk me home.

100
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:36,780
Go back.

101
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:38,310
Alright, then I won't.

102
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,570
Be quiet when you get home.

103
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:42,220
The neighbors are asleep at this hour.

104
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:44,270
Got it.

105
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:45,830
I'm not a kid.

106
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:46,430
I'm off.

107
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:47,070
Bye.

108
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:47,990
Stay safe.

109
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:03,140
Prosecutor Yang.

110
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,580
The photos have been delivered.

111
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:13,750
Qinyang.

112
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:15,900
Let's confirm once more, alright?

113
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:18,510
That night,

114
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,660
what did the car's headlights

115
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:21,220
look like?

116
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,140
Is it this one?

117
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:29,310
Or this one?

118
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:33,430
Look at this one.

119
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:38,780
Is it this one?

120
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:55,270
Qinyang, it's okay now.

121
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:56,070
It's okay.

122
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:57,340
I'm here, it's okay.

123
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:58,390
It's okay.

124
00:06:58,780 --> 00:06:59,750
It's alright.

125
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:01,100
Don't cry.

126
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:01,750
It's okay.

127
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:06,140
(Community Service Team)

128
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:06,950
Director Zhang.

129
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:08,780
How's the road surveillance check going?

130
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:09,750
Any leads?

131
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:11,540
Prosecutor Liang.

132
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:12,460
We've checked

133
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:13,660
all surveillance cameras

134
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:14,780
on the relevant roads.

135
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:16,630
No suspicious vehicles were found.

136
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,070
Did the car just vanish into thin air?

137
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:20,750
I understand how you feel.

138
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:22,630
We're expanding the search area.

139
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:24,460
But it was raining that night.

140
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:25,870
No tire tracks,

141
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:27,070
no witnesses.

142
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:28,900
This makes our work difficult too.

143
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:30,340
We have to understand each other.

144
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:32,430
Qinyang was at the scene.

145
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:33,540
He's a witness.

146
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,470
He can confirm that the headlights
belonged to a Jinbei van.

147
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:38,870
Why not check all Jinbei vans
in the city?

148
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,100
It's such an obvious clue.

149
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,190
Of course we checked.

150
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:43,540
All relevant exits and roads
near the crime scene

151
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:44,460
were checked,

152
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,540
but no Jinbei vans were seen that night.

153
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:48,990
We also had other officers

154
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:50,580
reconfirm with Qinyang.

155
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:52,630
Children sometimes misremember things.

156
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:54,510
It's understandable.

157
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:00,860
The child still insists
it was a Jinbei van.

158
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:19,220
How is my dad?

159
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:21,190
He's out of danger for now.

160
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:23,270
But he needs a few days in the ICU.

161
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,270
You should prepare yourself.

162
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:32,390
I understand.
