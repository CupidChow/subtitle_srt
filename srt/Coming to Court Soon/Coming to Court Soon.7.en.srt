=Episode 7=

3
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:01,980
Now I'll read the conditional
non-prosecution decision.

4
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:03,110
All rise.

5
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:06,300
(Prosecutor's Announcement)
Qinzhong People's Procuratorate,

6
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,660
Conditional Non-Prosecution Decision.

7
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:10,830
The defendant, Li Songyan,

8
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:11,870
male,

9
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:14,860
born on January 28, 2006,

10
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:16,860
is a second-year high school student

11
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,580
at Qinzhong No. 15 High School.

12
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:20,900
After legal review by this office,

13
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:22,030
it's been determined

14
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:23,580
at around 11:00 PM

15
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:24,700
on June 6, 2023,

16
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:26,470
the defendant, Li Songyan,

17
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:28,350
was caught driving without a license

18
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,700
and under the influence of alcohol

19
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:31,390
on Longshan Road,
Nancheng District, Qinzhong.

20
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,670
When stopped

21
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:34,830
by traffic officer Li Guomin,

22
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,460
he refused to cooperate,
resisted law enforcement,

23
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:39,340
and engaged in a physical struggle,
resulting in injuries to Li Guomin's

24
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:40,340
wrist and fingers.

25
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,490
According to the assessment,

26
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:42,910
Li Guomin's injuries

27
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,300
were classified as minor injuries.

28
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:45,410
This office believes that

29
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,390
the defendant Li Songyan

30
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:50,140
obstructed law enforcement officers
performing their official duties,

31
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,580
constituting the crime
of obstructing public service.

32
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:55,210
However, considering that he was
under 18 at the time of the crime,

33
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:56,550
was a first-time offender,

34
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:00,220
and has actively compensated the victim
and obtained forgiveness,

35
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,330
he meets the criteria
for conditional non-prosecution

36
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:03,260
and has shown remorse.

37
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:05,400
Based on Article 282, Paragraph One

38
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,980
of the Criminal Procedure Law
of the People's Republic of China,

39
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:09,390
this office has decided

40
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:10,860
to grant conditional non-prosecution.

41
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:14,180
The probation period is six months,
during which he mustn't leave the city.

42
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:14,750
Additionally,

43
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:17,070
due to the guardianship
deficiency issues

44
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:18,590
reflected in the investigation report,

45
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,070
a Supervisory Order

46
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:21,900
will be issued to his guardians,

47
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:23,580
requiring them to receive

48
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,070
family education guidance.

49
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,790
Qinzhong Nancheng District
People's Procuratorate,

50
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:29,790
June 18, 2023.

51
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,140
You may be seated.

52
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:38,180
Li Songyan.

53
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,270
Due to your weak legal awareness

54
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,170
and impulsive actions,

55
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:42,420
you broke the law.

56
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:44,300
I hope you'll cherish this opportunity

57
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,890
(Prosecutor)
for conditional non-prosecution.

58
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,700
Accept correction and education,

59
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,680
regain confidence,
and look forward to the future.

60
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:51,580
(Defendant)

61
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:52,230
Sure.

62
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:53,950
I understand my mistake.

63
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:55,300
I'll correct myself.

64
00:02:58,270 --> 00:02:58,860
Li Hai.

65
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,070
In reality, parents are

66
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:01,790
a child's first teachers.

67
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,860
The family is also
a child's first school,

68
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:07,020
and the first line of defense
against juvenile delinquency.

69
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:09,180
No matter what stage
a child is at in their growth,

70
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:11,860
they always need emotional care
from their parents.

71
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:14,390
Stop using blame as a form of concern.

72
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:17,580
Alright.

73
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:18,980
Thank you, prosecutor.

74
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:20,980
I'll communicate with my son.

76
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:31,110

00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:33,180
Yes.

78
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:34,350
Well.

79
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:36,510
Thank you for arranging
Zhang Mengmeng's enrollment.

80
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:39,420
Thank you.

81

Qinyang.

82
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,510
You found a school for her?

83
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:47,230
I contacted a fellow prosecutor,

84
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,900
and helped her
get into a boarding school

85
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,550
in the city where her father works.

86
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:53,670
A new environment, a fresh start.

87
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:55,140
It's a good thing for her.

88
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,140
The dark clouds will pass,

89
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:01,670
and the sun will shine again.

90
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:13,300
I still think Ma Haoda is suspicious.

91
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:18,390
He had an alibi
for what happened back then.

92
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:19,860
I know.

93
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,140
But still no evidence.

94
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,860
Even though we know something's wrong.

95
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:24,900
Yang, let's not

96
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,170
talk about this today, okay?

97
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,580
About Uncle Zhong's treatment plan,

98
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,900
I'll consult some friends
in the medical field.

99
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,220
Don't worry too much.

100
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:37,660
We'll find a way.

101
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:41,270
Alright, I don't know much anyway.

102
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:43,430
So I'll leave it all to you.

103
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:47,510
But, there's something

104
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,340
I don't know if I should tell you.

105
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,270
Uncle Zhong has been receiving
funding from the hospital's

106
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:56,090
cerebrovascular disease
research foundation.

107
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:58,100
He was included
in multiple experimental groups

108
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,880
and received many
expensive imported drugs.

109
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:01,700
You knew about this.

110
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:05,070
But after you told me
about Li Songyan's case,

111
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:06,470
I started paying closer attention.

112
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:08,900
The foundation's biggest sponsor

113
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:10,780
is Tonghai Logistics.

114
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:13,310
Tonghai Logistics?

115
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:14,780
Yes.

116
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,070
The owner is Li Hai.

117
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:25,180
(Qinzhong Medical Clinic Fee Receipt)

118
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:27,370
The foundation's
official explanation is that

119
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:28,870
Li Hai's late wife, Yang Tong,

120
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:30,310
died from cerebrovascular disease,

121
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,660
so he invested heavily

122
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:33,780
in the project.

123
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,680
But Yang Tong's actual cause of death

124
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:37,580
was a heart attack.

125
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:55,630
Dad.

126
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,220
What should I do?

127
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,100
Which one of you
is Zhong Handong's family member?

128
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,310
Doctor, I'm Zhong Handong's colleague.

129
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,900
His child is too young.

130
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,270
You can talk to me instead.

131
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:43,020
Zhong Handong's surgery has just ended.

132
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:44,510
Thank you so much, doctor.

133
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:45,350
We're truly grateful.

134
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:46,580
I'm very sorry.

135
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:49,270
Even though we conducted
multiple consultations,

136
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:51,460
you brought him in too late.

137
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,750
The patient has now been confirmed
as brain dead.

138
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,870
There is almost no chance
he'll ever wake up.

139
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:58,580
We did our best.

140
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:06,100
