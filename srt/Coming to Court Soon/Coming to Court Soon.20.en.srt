(Before Li Hai's arrest)

4
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:02,490
I'm sorry.

5
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,940
I just had a very, very long dream.

6
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:15,380
I dreamed of my parents.

7
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:20,410
They told me it's been too long.

8
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:22,730
Let it go.

9
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,500
Why are you helping me?

10
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:06,690
What are you saying?

11
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:08,620
We're family.

12
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:14,820
Thank you.

Lu...

Aunt Lu.

15
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:25,570
What are you doing?

16
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:26,940
Drowning your sorrows in cola?

17
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:28,890
Only soda

18
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:29,730
can make me happy.

00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:41,450

20
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:43,170
Tell me.

21
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:45,820
If someone vents their anger on a person
because of someone else,

22
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,780
isn't that really immature?

23
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:50,620
Not bad,

24
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:52,620
you're starting to realize
your own immaturity.

25
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,260
That means you're growing up.

26
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:56,570
But...

27
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:58,780

Look.
