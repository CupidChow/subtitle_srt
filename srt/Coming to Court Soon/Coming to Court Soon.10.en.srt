After tutoring you yesterday,

10
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:45,580
I now understand your level.

11
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,340
I've made a big study plan for you.

12
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,120
These are all the workbooks
I bought for you.

13
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,220
You have to complete
these exercises every day.

14
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:57,030
What's wrong?

15
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,390
Yesterday, I said that

16
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,390
because I had no choice.

17
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,580
I didn't actually mean

18
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:03,670
for you to be my tutor.

19
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:07,800
So you're saying
you don't plan to prove yourself

20
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:09,140
by getting into college

21
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:10,220
on your own?

22
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:13,140
Fine.

23
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,120
No backing out now.

24
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,200
(Dad: I'm bringing you something.
Come downstairs.)

25
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:22,950
What's wrong?

26
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:26,230
My dad's calling me.
I'll head down for a bit.

27
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:40,950
Check out the engine oil.

28
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,200
(Sir Xue was known as one of
the "Thirteen Young Masters" in the trade.)

29
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,560
(There was no car he couldn't fix.)

30
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:49,560
(My dad used to work for him
back in the day.)

31
00:02:55,781 --> 00:03:02,180
(Luxury Car Repair)

32
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:07,580
Hello,

33
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:10,790
the number you dialed is unavailable.

34
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,510
Please try again later.

35
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:13,110
Sorry...

36
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:16,000
Why did his phone turn off
right after going downstairs?

37
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:18,140
Something's not right.

38
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:23,630
Hello?

39
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:25,420
Qinyang, Li Songyan is missing.

40
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:26,900
Missing?

41
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:28,860
Li Hai took him away,

42
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:29,950
and now his phone is off.

43
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,140
Got it.

44
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:37,550
Li Hai.

45
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:39,510
Where did you take Li Songyan?

46
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:40,630
Sorry.

47
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:41,580
Qinyang!

48
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:43,140
Help me!

49
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,830
I'm on the highway to the airport.

50
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:46,070
Li Hai is trying to kidnap me!

51
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:35,310
Li Hai.

52
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:37,660
Li Songyan is still on probation.

53
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:40,390
Sending him abroad
without the prosecutor's permission

54
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:41,310
is illegal.

55
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:42,080
Do you realize that?

56
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:43,190
You got it wrong.

57
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:44,760
You got it all wrong, Prosecutor Zhong.

58
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:46,460
I'm doing this for his own good.

59
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:48,780
I'm his father. Would I harm him?

60
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,540
A child is not your property.

61
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,950
Raising him requires proper methods.

62
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:56,700
Little brat.

63
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:57,700
Where are you going?

64
00:04:58,390 --> 00:04:59,020
Li Hai.

65
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:01,340
You're the master of twisting facts.

66
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:02,630
Cut it out.

67
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:04,100
If I had a choice,

68
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:05,630
I'd never be your son.

69
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,920
What nonsense are you spouting?

70
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:20,070
Li Hai.

71
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:21,700
Other than hitting me

72
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:22,780
and kidnapping me,

73
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,700
what else can you do?

74
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:37,020
I had no choice

75
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,390
but to send you abroad.

76
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:40,780
Li Songyan!

77
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:57,460
How can he hit a child like that?

78
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,000
His father tried to force him
to go abroad

79
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:01,950
by any means.

80
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:03,660
That's too much!

81
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:04,630
Who does that?

82
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,180
(Li Hai)

83
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:24,540
We're home now.

84
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:25,540
Don't worry.

85
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,310
Thank you, Prosecutor Zhong.

86
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:28,630
I think we need to

87
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:30,460
have a talk about this.

88
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:32,460
Alright.

89
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:04,390
Li Songyan!

90
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:05,660
Li Songyan.

91
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:08,540
Li Songyan.

92
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:09,720
What are you doing?

93
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:11,990
Li Songyan.

94
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,580
Come down first, okay?

95
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:14,700
Let's talk.

96
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:17,950
I know you feel terrible right now.

97
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:19,140
Your dad went too far,

98
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,190
but he'd never harm you, right?

99
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:22,340
Come down, okay?

100
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:23,990
Come down.

101
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:28,020
Slowly.

102
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:30,140
Slow down.

103
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:32,630
Be careful.

104
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:34,660
Don't move.

105
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:35,750
Be careful.

106
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:55,540
I just came up to get some air.

107
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:58,040
Why didn't you say so earlier?
You scared me to death.

108
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,340
You were worried about me?

109
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:02,140
Of course.

110
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:06,960
A few days ago, a girl about your age
wanted to jump off a building too.

111
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,580
Why do kids these days

112
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:10,700
treat their lives so lightly?

113
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,070
So this is what it feels like

114
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,460
to be cared for.
