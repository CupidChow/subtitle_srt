00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,300
=Episode 14=

3
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:12,780
Hello.

4
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:13,780
Who is this?

5
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:15,270
Hello.

6
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:16,500
I'm Wu Yang,

7
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:17,860
a friend of Zhong Qinyang.

8
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:20,330
I heard you're investigating
Zhong Handong's accident.

9
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:21,340
Can we meet?

10
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:23,190
Alright.

11
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:24,620
Where are you?

12
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:26,550
I'm right downstairs.

13
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,220
(Could he be coming for me?)

14
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:10,110
Are you saying Zhong Handong's car accident
is related to my dad?

15
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:12,420
Impossible.

16
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:13,670
My dad is colorblind.

17
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:15,750
He can't tell red from green
and can't drive.

18
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:18,460
Besides, Li Hai had
no grudge against him.

19
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:19,710
There was no reason to kill him.

20
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:21,020
Then why did Li Hai

21
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:22,980
fund Zhong Handong so much?

22
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:24,980
How can you say that?

23
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:25,990
What proof do you have?

24
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:28,980
Li Hai has used your mother's death

25
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:30,900
as a cover for his lies.

26
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:33,270
What?

27
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:36,740
The foundation was established
for brain vascular disease research.

28
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:39,580
According to Li Hai,

29
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:41,350
your mother died from this disease,

30
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:42,860
so he heavily funded

31
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:45,180
the research of it
as a tribute to his late wife.

32
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:47,900
But the cause of your mother's death

33
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:49,580
was a heart attack.

34
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:51,140
And Zhong Handong

35
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,670
was the first beneficiary
of the foundation.

36
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,140
Why should I believe you?

37
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:57,790
Aren't you afraid

38
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,180
I'll tell Li Hai everything?

39
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:02,700
If Li Hai has done nothing wrong

40
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,580
and this is all just a misunderstanding,

41
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:06,900
then what's the harm in telling him?

42
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:19,550
I made this soup myself.

43
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:24,860
A while ago,

44
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:28,270
I looked into the foundation's
financial records.

45
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,070
I found

46
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:31,420
some irregularities.

47
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,670
There's a patient named Zhong Handong.

48
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:38,300
His medical expenses have

49
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,630
far exceeded the foundation's limits.

50
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,700
And the doctor already said
he'd never wake up.

51
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:47,350
Yet, his medical bills

52
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:48,860
have never stopped.

53
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,549
It doesn't make sense.

54
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,260
So I suspect someone

55
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,780
is profiting from this.

56
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:02,110
Zhong Handong's case is special.

57
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:05,420
The part that the foundation
wouldn't cover,

58
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:06,670
I paid for privately.

59
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:09,510
This goes

60
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,180
too deep.

61
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:28,900
Li Hai has used your mother's death

62
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,900
as a cover for his lies.

63
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:34,020
But the cause of your mother's death
was a heart attack.

64
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:35,900
And Zhong Handong

65
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:38,220
was the first beneficiary
of the foundation.

66
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:42,660
(Li Hai has used your mother's death)

67
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:44,660
(as a cover for his lies.)

68
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:50,990
I was in a hurry to send you abroad

69
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:52,580
for my own reasons.

70
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:53,900
But I can't tell you now.

71
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:59,740
(Diagnosis: Myocardial Infarction,
Cerebral Aneurysm)

72
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:00,990
(Hospital Admission Record
Name: Yang Tong)

73
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:04,830
Cerebral aneurysm?

74
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,900
Songyan's mother, Yang Tong,
died suddenly

75
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:10,580
because she had a cerebral aneurysm.

76
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,070
This disease isn't rare,

77
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:15,510
and the surgery has a high success rate.

78
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:18,340
But her aneurysm was in a bad location,

79
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:21,220
near the base
of the brain's arterial circle.

80
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:24,270
Once it ruptures,
the fatality rate is high.

81
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:26,990
But

82
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:29,220
what does this have to do
with Zhong Handong?

83
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,660
Zhong Handong also has this disease,

84
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,900
and its location is very similar
to Yang Tong's.

85
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:36,580
In fact, his current condition

86
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,540
has little to do with the car accident.

87
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:40,270
It's more due to the cerebral aneurysm.

88
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:46,310
So,

89
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:49,580
you funded Zhong Handong privately

90
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:51,870
for the medical team's research?

91
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,900
This seems like a good deed,

92
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:57,220
helping pay for his treatment
and prolonging his life.

93
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:59,750
But in reality, it was for research,

94
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,220
or even for my own selfish reasons.

95
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:05,190
But why didn't you

96
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:06,660
explain this to Songyan?

97
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:10,510
That kid won't listen to me.

98
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:13,390
Would he believe it even if I told him?

99
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,330
It doesn't matter.

100
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:18,780
As long as I have a clear conscience.

101
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,780
Now that Ma Haoda
is ruled out as a suspect,

102
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,490
Li Hai is definitely hiding something.

103
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:36,880
What a coincidence.

104
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:38,460
Two months ago,

105
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:39,900
your father had a medical checkup.

106
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:42,540
Look.

107
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:44,390
Colorblindness, none.

108
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:47,580
So, your father was lying.

109
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:49,630
He said Li Hai was red-green colorblind

110
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:50,580
and couldn't drive.

111
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:01,340
(Colorblindness: None)

112
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,540
I grew up under Sir Xue's influence.

113
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:08,980
Back in his day, Sir Xue was known as one of
the "Thirteen Young Masters" in the trade.

114
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:10,270
There was no car he couldn't fix.

115
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:11,750
My dad used to work for him.

116
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:16,190
Li Hai was once an apprentice
at Xue Biao's shop.

117
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:19,990
But none of this was in the records.

118
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,140
(Li Songyan)

119
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:40,580
Brother.

120
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:42,590
Do you believe my father is the culprit?

121
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:46,510
I only believe in evidence.

122
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,100
I don't trust what Wu Yang said,

123
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:52,540
but since you're saying this,

124
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,100
you must've found proof.

125
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:55,540
What do you need me to do?

126
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:58,950
This has nothing to do with you.

127
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,780
You don't need to do anything.

128
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:03,980
Go spend time with your friends.

129
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:05,390
I'll contact you when it's over.

130
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:20,570
Songyan and Wu Yang both know,

131
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,370
and I'm the only one
being kept in the dark?

132
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:23,880
You don't treat me as a friend at all.

133
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:27,300
The more people who know,
the more people who will worry.

134
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:28,220
Why burden yourself?

135
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:29,540
Qinyang.

136
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:30,830
Have you heard this saying?

137
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:33,100
Happiness doubles when shared,

138
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:35,390
but pain is halved.
