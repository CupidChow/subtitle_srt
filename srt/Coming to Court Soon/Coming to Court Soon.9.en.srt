=Coming to Court Soon=

2
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,300
=Episode 9=

3
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:12,220
(Tonight, same place, 200 thousand)

4
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:27,950
Uncle Xue.

5
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:30,620
Do people still drive
Jinbei vans nowadays?

6
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,760
The fourth generation.

7
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:34,140
Those old vans have long been scrapped.

8
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:37,390
Then how can I find out who owns one?

9
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:39,470
Why are you asking about Jinbei vans?

10
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,460
I just think they're practical,
and wanted to get one for fun.

11
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:46,500
Go on.
Keep making things up.

12
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,140
I can't hide anything from you.

13
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:50,620
Actually,

14
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,950
this is related to a murder case.

15
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:57,110
What murder case?

16
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:59,420
What does it have to do with you?

17
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,190
A friend's case.

18
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:02,670
It's really tragic.

19
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,110
The story starts

20
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:06,340
with a car headlight.

21
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:40,700
Do you want to die?

22
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:41,900
Um.

23
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:42,830
Aunt.

24
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,950
I already have a boyfriend.

25
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:46,830
You always say that.

26
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,980
It's true. Why would I lie to you?

27
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:51,830
I know.

28
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:52,230
I...

29
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:53,860
Sneaking around like a thief

30
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:54,700
isn't your style.

31
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:56,790
Is that how you talk to your father?

32
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:58,740
Aunt, I have to go now. Talk later.

33
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:01,550
I just happened to pass by

34
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:03,400
and thought I'd give you a ride.

35
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:04,670
But you...

36
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,980
You've been hanging
around Xue Biao a lot lately.

37
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,720
Believe it or not, I'll break your legs.

38
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,120
How do you know I was at Sir Xue's?

39
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,240
How long have you been following me?

40
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:13,900
Come on.

41
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:15,580
I know you too well.

42
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:16,740
You'll do anything

43
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:17,740
to avoid studying,

44
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:18,550
right?

45
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:22,510
Anyway,
stay away from that place.

46
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:23,420
Li Hai.

47
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:24,740
You're ungrateful.

48
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:25,670
I'm not.

49
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:27,140
Li Songyan!

50
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:28,180
Li Songyan!

51
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:29,550
Li Songyan!

52
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,020
By the way, Qinyang.

53
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:54,110
I saw Li Songyan

54
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:56,350
arguing with his dad again
on the street.

55
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:58,000
I didn't have time to stop him.

56
00:03:58,920 --> 00:03:59,800
They're arguing again?

57
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:01,700
Yeah,

58
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:05,020
something about fixing cars,
but I didn't catch the details.

59
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:06,860
Qinyang.

60
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:07,740
This.

61
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:12,230
Ma Haoda's case file.

62
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:16,390
Yes, this is the one.

63
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:22,980
It's related to a murder case.

64
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:27,020
The story starts with a car headlight.

65
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:37,500
(Sir Xue, someone's been
on a winning streak at the shop)

66
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:59,620
(Songyan is looking into Jinbei vans)

67
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:10,000
Five circles.

68
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:13,020
Brother Hao.

69
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:14,430
Xue Biao took the bait.

70
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:20,070
But is an old guy like Xue Biao

71
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:22,140
really worth such a big setup?

72
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:24,900
What do you know?

73
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:29,220
He's close to Li Hai.

74
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:32,270
Li Hai set up

75
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,310
that repair shop for him.

76
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:36,100
But is that kid really up to it?

77
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:38,830
He's just a decoy.

78
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:40,020
We decide

79
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,190
whether he makes it or not.

80
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:11,100
Brother.

81
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:12,540
Drink some water.

82
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,840
Bringing reinforcements won't help.
You're going home tomorrow.

83
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:19,540
I can't go home.

84
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:21,660
I can't study in peace there.

85
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:24,990
If you hadn't had
nowhere to go back then,

86
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:26,270
I wouldn't have taken you in.

87
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:28,460
And you think you can
study in peace here?

88
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:30,700
Yes.

89
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,270
I already talked to Su.

90
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:34,580
She'll be my tutor

91
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,540
and teach me.

92
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:37,460
You can supervise me too.

93
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:40,190
Because I want to prove myself
and get into college.

94
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,100
When did I ever say that?
Don't make things up.

95
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:52,580
Okay.

96
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:55,900
Where's your textbooks?

97
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,340
Right, my books?

98
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,950
Get the books out.

99
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,270
Let's do homework.

100
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:03,140
Come on.

101
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,190
If you want to stay here,

102
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:06,660
don't make Qinyang angry.

103
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:07,540
Yes, of course.

104
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:08,700
You're right.

105
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:09,830
I'll study hard.

106
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:11,340
Fine.

107
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,940
Then study here.

108
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,900
I'll stay at the dorm.

109
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,540
Three circles.
I won.

110
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:38,020
Pure suit, one straight.

111
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,630
Wait, what hand is this?

112
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:45,580
Isn't this a self-draw?

113
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:47,990
Uncle Xue.

114
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,480
You're getting old.

115
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,070
Three circles is a self-draw, right?

116
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:52,990
Why'd you play it?

117
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:53,990
Shut up.

118
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:55,660
Too much talking.

119
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:04,990
What? Out of money?

120
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:06,990
This isn't enough.

121
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:09,100
No worries.

122
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:11,070
Take it back.

123
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,880
This round doesn't count.
Let's play again.

124
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:15,340
Bad luck today. I'm done.

125
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:17,480
I'll be back another day. Wait for me.

126
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:37,310
It's me.

127
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:39,220
I saw him today.

128
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:42,470
He looks exactly like Zhong Handong.
