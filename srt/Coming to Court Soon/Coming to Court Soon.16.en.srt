=Coming to Court Soon=

2
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,300
=Episode 16=

3
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:04,810
Hello.

4
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,580
The number you dialed is powered off.

5
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:10,790
He stood up Su.

6
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:12,230
Is he on a date?

7
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:24,000
The hospital.

8
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:10,830
Brother.

9
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,910
Your phone was off.

10
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:15,470
I knew you'd be here.

11
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:32,580
Brother.

12
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:35,420
Did Wu Yang

13
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:37,860
tell you the culprit

14
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:40,230
might be my father?

15
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:54,070
If he really did this,

16
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,020
I'll report him to the police myself.

17
00:02:58,790 --> 00:02:59,350
But

18
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:02,020
I don't have any evidence yet.

19
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:07,550
When did your father start

20
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,630
apprenticing at Xue Biao's shop?

21
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:11,830
He...

22
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:32,420
Songyan.

23
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:35,460
This has nothing to do with you.

24
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:37,140
Stay out of it.

25
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:45,980
It's late.

26
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:47,740
I'll take you home.

27
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:51,390
Brother.

28
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:52,140
What's wrong?

29
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:56,460
I'm fine.

30
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:06,830
Brother.

31
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:09,460
Brother.

32
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,420
Brother.

33
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:12,350
Doctor!

34
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:13,980
Doctor!

35
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:15,510
Brother!

36
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,990
Why isn't he here yet?

37
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:36,140
Thank you.

38
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:36,730
You're welcome.

39
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:56,660
Hello?

40
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:57,390
Su.

41
00:04:58,730 --> 00:04:59,660
Brother is in hospital.

42
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:01,270
What happened?

43
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:03,190
Don't worry.

44
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:04,340
The doctor said

45
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:06,410
it's just exhaustion and too much stress.

46
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:07,950
He just needs a couple of days of rest.

47
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:08,950
Which hospital are you at?

48
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:09,700
I'll come over now.

49
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:10,900
City Hospital.

50
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,020
(Back in his day, Sir Xue was known)

51
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:21,860
(as one of the "Thirteen Young Masters"
in the trade.)

52
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:23,220
(There was no car he couldn't fix.)

53
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:24,780
(My dad used to work for him.)

54
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:29,900
(Sun Kaixuan is Li Hai's driver.)

55
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:32,140
(He was Sir Xue's apprentice.)

56
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,540
(Li Hai was also Sir Xue's apprentice.)

57
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,660
(Police Inquiry Record)

58
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,140
(Sun Kaixuan, male)

59
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:47,510
(But Li Hai wasn't mentioned
in the statement.)

60
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,850
Where can I check
the surveillance footage from there?

61
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,540
You need to access it
in the control room.

62
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:59,140
Songyan.

63
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:00,270
What are you doing?

64
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:01,630
I went to get some water,

65
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:02,990
and when I came back, Brother was gone.

66
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:04,070
Go check.

67
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:11,780
You don't know where he went?

68
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,020
What else can you even do?

69
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,830
I really just went to get water.

70
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:15,950
Could it be your dad...

71
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:17,600
- Stop talking nonsense!
- silencing him?

72
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:18,420
Dr. Wu.

73
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,980
Songyan is still a minor.

74
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:22,500
Do you know
how much harm your baseless words

75
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,243
could cause him?

76
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:24,930
Right now, our priority

77
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:26,250
is to find Qinyang.

78
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:28,690
I...

79
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:30,300
I'll go

80
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:31,450
ask my dad for answers.

81
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:37,180
(Where could Qinyang have gone?)

82
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,300
(Zhong Qinyang)

83
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,390
Hello, Qinyang?

84
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:54,900
I'm at Unit 1902,

85
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:55,780
793 Kezhen Road,

86
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:56,660
Beicheng District.

87
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:10,630
Young man.

88
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:11,420
Stop knocking.

89
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:12,807
They moved out a long time ago.

90
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:24,060
(Vehicle Rental Handover Form,
Qin A Q8637)

91
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,900
(Qin A Q8637)

92
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,100
You're still sick.

93
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,140
Why are you running around?

94
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,980
I came to find Sun Kaixuan today.

95
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:49,380
He's now Li Hai's driver.

96
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:51,520
I suspect that back then,

97
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:53,170
he helped cover for Li Hai
regarding my parents' case.

98
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,790
And now, they've set their sights on me.

99
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:57,750
Then let's call the police.

100
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:01,280
No, we don't have enough evidence yet.

101
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:05,300
So what do we do?

102
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:09,940
Let's talk on the way.

103
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,060
Xiaoyan.

104
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:26,620
Xiaoyan.

105
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:28,980
There you are.

106
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:31,060
Why didn't you respond?

107
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:33,130
Speaking of that,

108
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:35,570
you're a grown man.

109
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,010
Look at this mess.

110
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:38,210
You should clean up.

111
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:39,810
Xiaoyan.

112
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,860
You should let the housekeeper
handle things like this in the future.

113
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:43,810
Don't overwork yourself.

114
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,530
She can't be as meticulous as I am.

115
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:48,820
Alright.

116
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:50,820
I'll go check if the food is ready.
