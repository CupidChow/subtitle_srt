=The Resilient Dr. Ling=

2
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:09,340
=Episode 10=

3
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:15,400
Yehan.

4
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,030
Yiyi died so tragically.

5
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:18,630
You must seek justice for her.

6
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:20,170
Where were you at midnight last night?

7
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:22,400
I was sleeping in my room.

8
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,020
Who can testify for you?

9
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,590
I don't like to be disturbed
when I sleep.

10
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:28,590
Xiaozhu was there.

11
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:30,280
- She can testify.
- Yes.

12
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,330
Xiaozhu is her personal maid.

13
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,760
Naturally she says might not be credible.

14
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:35,990
I'm afraid

15
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:37,070
what she said doesn't count.

16
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:38,100
What do you mean?

17
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:42,460
Do you think I killed Liu Yiyi?

18
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:44,980
Repeat what you

19
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,720
just said.

20
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:49,070
Last night, I was on duty in the garden.

21
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:50,440
At around midnight,

22
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,960
I suddenly heard someone
arguing by the lotus pond.

23
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,110
I took a closer look

24
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:56,460
and saw Her Highness
together with Secondary Consort Liu.

25
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:58,650
I did not dare to approach.

26
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:00,470
But then,

27
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:02,920
Her Highness Pushed
Secondary Consort Liu down.

28
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,070
Nonsense.

29
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:06,110
I didn't go to the lotus pond
at all last night.

30
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:07,460
I dare not lie.

31
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,470
And I wasn't the only one there.

32
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:12,500
Yes, I also saw it.

33
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:15,320
Since you saw I pushed her
into the lotus pond,

34
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,710
why didn't you call for help

35
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:18,810
but watched her drown to death?

36
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,150
We were too scared at that time,

37
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:24,030
and afraid that you would silence us.

38
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:25,320
So we dared not call for help.

39
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,280
It was my fault.

40
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,540
Please punish me, Your Highness.

41
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,510
It's natural that the servants

42
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:30,720
fear their master.

43
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,960
They are guilty,

44
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,500
but the culprit is not them.

45
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:38,420
What else do you have to say now?

46
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,190
I said,

47
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:41,320
it wasn't me who killed her.

48
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,280
I have no grudge against her.

49
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,630
Why would I want to kill her?

50
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:46,150
I heard that Ms. Wu, the kitchen maid

51
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:47,810
poisoned Ruojin's porridge yesterday

52
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:51,650
and confessed that she was instructed
by Secondary Consort Liu.

53
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,020
Is this true?

54
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:55,540
Yes.

55
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:59,510
She first gave me a Seven-Star Orchid

56
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:02,770
then let Ms. Wu put wolfberry pollen
in my porridge.

57
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:05,590
When mixed,

58
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:06,800
they become highly toxic.

59
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,420
So you held a grudge

60
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:10,710
and killed Liu Yiyi.

61
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:12,540
I said it wasn't me.

62
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:14,550
And I don't think

63
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:17,610
Liu Yiyi understands
such complex pharmacology.

64
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:19,880
She must have been instructed
by someone else.

65
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,860
And my goal has never been her,

66
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:24,880
but the person behind it.

67
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,670
With witness testimony
and material evidence,

68
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:27,980
you're still trying to deny it.

69
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,060
Do you thinkYehan is a fool?

70
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:39,610
What are you doing?

71
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:41,670
What is the cause of her death?

72
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:42,610
She was drowned.

73
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:48,610
Impossible.

74
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:50,480
She was killed first

75
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,690
and then pushed into the water.

76
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:56,810
Ruojin, how can you lie
to absolve yourself?

77
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,420
A person who has drowned

78
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:01,800
will show signs of intense struggling
and rapid breathing in the water.

79
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,690
So, there should be spumy foam
at the mouth and nostrils,

80
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,580
the fingers should be covered
in silt and aquatic plants,

81
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,810
and the trachea and lungs
should be filled with lots of water.

82
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,190
But if she was killed first,

83
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:17,020
the above symptoms would not occur.

84
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:18,960
If you don't believe me,

85
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,360
let the coroner cut open her lungs

86
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,250
and see if there is water inside.

87
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:24,580
Please don't.

88
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,960
Yiyi has already suffered enough.

89
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,190
How can you destroy her body

90
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:31,070
just because of some nonsense
Ruojin said?

91
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:32,190
I think

92
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:33,480
she wants the person who harmed her

93
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,500
to be brought to justice.

94
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,510
Nonsense.

95
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:42,550
If Secondary Consort Liu was indeed murdered,

96
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:43,760
why are there no scars

97
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,210
on her body?

98
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:46,920
Things have come to this.

99
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,060
Just admit it, Ruojin.

100
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:04,460
Sure enough.

101
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,590
She was killed with a needle
stuck in the back of the head.

102
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:10,150
This method can cause death

103
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,860
without leaving obvious signs of trauma.

104
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,510
The murderer is cunning

105
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:15,980
and malicious.

106
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:20,900
Just now you both claimed to have seen

107
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:23,500
Liu Yiyi pushed into the pond
by Her Highness.

108
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:25,960
It was dark.

109
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,510
Perhaps we were mistaken

110
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:28,400
and saw it wrong.

111
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,920
Just now you said it
with great certainty.

112
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,420
Now you want to get away with it?

113
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,690
Tell me.

114
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,540
Who ordered you to do this?

115
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:37,630
You misunderstood.

116
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:38,330
No one instructed us.

117
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:39,190
Still don't want to admit it.

118
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:41,280
Slandering Princess Consort
will get all your family executed.

119
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,190
You are not afraid of death,

120
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:44,210
but how about your family?

121
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:51,210
Whoever reveals who ordered this first,

122
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:53,290
I will spare her life.

123
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:56,920
It-It was her.

124
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,030
She gave each of us
50 taels of silver.

125
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:01,070
Yes. She made us say that.

126
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:02,670
Your Highnesses, Young Lady,

127
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:03,990
we're wronged.

128
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:05,510
I don't even know them.

129
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:07,540
I couldn't do such a thing.

130
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:11,840
Yehan, these two maids are full of lies.

131
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,240
Don't trust them.

132
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,880
I can swear on my life

133
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,400
that Xiaoqin is definitely innocent.

134
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,540
You don't get to say

135
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,760
whether she's innocent or not.

136
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,290
We need to see the evidence.

137
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:25,330
Do you have any evidence now?

138
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:28,060
Of course.

139
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,980
This is glow powder.

140
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:34,150
When meeting candlelight at night,

141
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:35,860
it emits a faint light.

142
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,670
Last night, Liu Yiyi

143
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:41,070
stole Seven-Star Orchid from my room

144
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:44,110
and stepped on the powder
I prepared for her.

145
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:47,130
She then arrived at your door.

146
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:51,580
What can this prove?

147
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,840
It only shows that we were close

148
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,900
and she came to chat with me.

149
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,250
Take it easy.

150
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,210
Xiaozhu, close the curtains.

151
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,500
The footprints

152
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,760
disappear from here.

153
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,480
It proves that last night Liu Yiyi

154
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,290
never left this room.

155
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,860
Then I guess there is only one reason.

156
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,190
She just arrived here

157
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:36,650
and got stopped by someone.

158
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:41,580
That person walked up to her

159
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,810
and pretended to whisper
in her ear.

160
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,670
At that moment,

161
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:49,980
she took out a needle

162
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,860
and inserted into her brain.

163
00:06:57,670 --> 00:07:00,840
Yuexi, impressive!

164
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,060
It wasn't me.

165
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:05,440
With witness testimony
and material evidence,

166
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,100
what else do you have to quibble?

167
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:12,130
Xiaoqin, when I wasn't in the room,

168
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,770
what on earth happened?

169
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,980
Young Lady, I...

170
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:18,540
Say it.

171
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,070
What on earth happened?

172
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:21,210
Who did it?

173
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,800
I... I did it.

174
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,630
When Young Lady wasn't in the room,

175
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:30,800
I killed Secondary Consort Liu

176
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,440
and shifted the blame to Her Highness.

177
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,060
Why did you do that?

178
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,250
Young Lady admires Your Highness,

179
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:37,710
but that woman

180
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:39,770
swept in and stole you away.

181
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:42,670
Young Lady is kind-hearted

182
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,460
but I couldn't swallow this anger.

183
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,990
It's all my fault.

184
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:48,380
It has nothing to do with her.

185
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:56,900
Yehan, Xiaoqin made such a big mistake.

186
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:58,810
Although I was completely unaware,

187
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:01,170
I didn't discipline her well.

188
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,380
I accept any punishment.

189
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,070
She committed the crime herself.

190
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,130
It's none of your business.

191
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,590
Huo Chong, hand Xiaoqin over
to the Ministry of Justice

192
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:15,070
and she'll be punished
according to the law.

193
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,110
- Young Lady.
- Yes.

194
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:17,680
Young Lady, murder is a capital crime.

195
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,880
- Young Lady, please save me.
- Go.

196
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:19,840
Young Lady.

197
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,370
Young Lady, please.

198
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:28,740
Ruojin, you were wronged today.

199
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:31,780
I apologize to you on behalf of Xiaoqin.

200
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:34,430
Your maid

201
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:36,530
took the blame for you willingly.

202
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:39,450
You must be very close.

203
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,250
What does this mean, Ruojin?

204
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,370
I mean

205
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,030
every time you mess with me,

206
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:47,940
I'll get rid of one of your pawns.

207
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,800
I'd like to see

208
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,570
how many pawns do you have to use.

209
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,700
You...

210
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:57,060
Report.

211
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:00,190
Your Highnesses.

212
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:01,520
The Empress is critically ill.

213
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,530
His Majesty summoned both of you
to the palace immediately.

214
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:04,210
