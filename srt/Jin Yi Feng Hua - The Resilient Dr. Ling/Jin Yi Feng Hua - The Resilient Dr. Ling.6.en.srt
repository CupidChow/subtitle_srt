00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:09,340
=Episode 6=

3
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:12,670
Greetings, Prince Chu.

4
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:20,510
I have been ordered to thoroughly
investigate the exam fraud case.

5
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,230
There is currently a lot of evidence

6
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:24,670
pointing to the Marquis of Loyalty.

7
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,070
Instead of reflecting at home,

8
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,550
you still act so arrogantly outside.

9
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:31,480
Do you have a death wish?

10
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:32,990
I dare not.

11
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:34,320
I'll go home and reflect on my own.

12
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:37,530
- Huo Chong.
- My Lord.

13
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:38,590
Yes, Your Highness.

14
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:40,280
Take this actor
to the official authorities

15
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:41,590
for interrogation.

16
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,320
Go.

17
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,190
Please save me, My Lord.

18
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:46,880
My Lord!

19
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:49,560
My Lord, save me.

20
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:54,070
After Li Yuxiang was flogged,

21
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:55,280
he confessed everything.

22
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:57,380
The 100,000 taels of silver
have been fully returned

23
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,610
and handed over to Mrs. Ling.

24
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:00,590
Following Princess Consort's orders,
Ling Jinxin was sent

25
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:02,280
to the countryside and locked up.

26
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,600
Okay.

27
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:05,710
Thank you for today.

28
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:13,550
You saved my man.

29
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:15,110
I owe you a favor.

30
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:17,230
Now we are even.

31
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:20,110
Don't think I'll treat you nicely
in the future.

32
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,920
What do you think you are?

33
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:25,480
Do you think everyone should like you?

34
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,200
Stop.

35
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:29,630
I warn you.

36
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,480
From now on,

37
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,480
if you dare use that weird thing
to stab me again,

38
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:36,840
don't blame me for being harsh.

39
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,280
If you don't provoke me,

40
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:42,280
I won't do that to you.

41
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,710
But if you dare to provoke me,

42
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:45,920
I'll still do it.

43
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,540
The imperial decree has arrived.

44
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:56,020
(Imperial Decree)

45
00:01:56,030 --> 00:02:00,070
Prince Chu and Princess Consort Chu
will enter the palace tomorrow

46
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:03,710
to attend the Qixi Palace Banquet. So ordered.

47
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,680
Yes.

48
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,280
When you see the Empress,

49
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,570
be cautious in your words and actions.

50
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:12,550
We're in the palace, after all.

51
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:13,920
If you make trouble,

52
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,000
I will definitely not save you.

53
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:16,550
Yehan.

54
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:37,620
(Lin Yuexi,
daughter of the Prime Minister)

55
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:46,030
Yehan, it's really you.

56
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,320
Yuexi.

57
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,230
Long time no see.

58
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,230
It has been four months and 12 days

59
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:56,840
since I last saw you.

60
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,480
I thought

61
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:00,800
you'd forgotten about me.

62
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:01,770
No.

63
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:04,760
Really?

64
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:07,960
This...

65
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,320
You're touching him already?

66
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,510
Sorry for the offense.

67
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,160
It's no problem.

68
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:18,550
How did you get into the palace?

69
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:23,550
His Majesty has betrothed me
to Prince Yan.

70
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:24,990
You're going to marry my third brother?

71
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,190
I feel so sad

72
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,670
thinking about marrying

73
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,710
someone else instead of you.

74
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:42,230
It's all my fault.

75
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,760
If I had not been betrayed by traitors,

76
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:48,030
I wouldn't have missed you.

77
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:53,840
Yehan, don't say that.

78
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,440
I'm not fortunate enough

79
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,760
to marry the person I deeply love.

80
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,120
Ruojin.

81
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:07,760
Can I have some time alone with Yehan?

82
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:12,800
Go far away.

83
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,000
You two need to talk privately.

84
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,510
Can't you go far away?

85
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:19,550
Why should I leave?

86
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:22,710
Ling Ruojin, can you stop
being so unreasonable?

87
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,440
Who is being unreasonable here?

88
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:27,280
At least I am your wife in name.

89
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:32,000
You're being all lovey-dovey
with this woman here

90
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:34,760
and now asking me to go away?

91
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,590
Ruojin, husband guides wife.

92
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,550
As a wife,

93
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:45,070
how can you contradict
your husband in public?

94
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,800
If you have any grievances,
just vent them on me.

95
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,760
Forget it.

96
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:53,110
Don't bother with this woman.

97
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,440
We'll go elsewhere.

98
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,640
Yes.

99
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,760
Ruojin, husband guides wife.

100
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:12,440
What was that?

101
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,110
So pretentious.

102
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:15,630
I'm so angry.

103
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Yehan.

104
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,400
I heard you are investigating
the exam fraud case

105
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:28,510
and Prince Yan is also involved.

106
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,550
Do you want to plead for him?

107
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:41,150
I'm not an unreasonable person.

108
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:46,070
Although Prince Yan
is going to be my husband

109
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,840
and we'll share weal and woe together,

110
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:52,360
I will not show favoritism.

111
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,800
If he is really guilty,

112
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,110
please don't worry about me.

113
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,280
Enforce the law impartially.

114
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,640
Don't worry.

115
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,190
Even if my brother is convicted,

116
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:05,400
I will do my best to protect you.

117
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,880
I'm not worried about my own safety.

118
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:15,000
But I am worried about you, Yehan.

119
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,670
This matter involves many people.

120
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,670
If you don't have full confidence,

121
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:23,360
do not report to His Majesty.

122
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:25,870
Otherwise,

123
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,510
it could backfire.

124
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:36,150
Thank you, Yuexi.

125
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:39,110
You always think for me.

126
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,000
Yehan.

127
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,760
Today is Qixi Festival.

128
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:53,320
Do you remember

129
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:56,000
I saved you ten years ago?

130
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,120
Of course I remember.

131
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,960
What's wrong with you?

132
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:19,230
It's a pity that I was too playful

133
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,440
and lost that jade pendant.

134
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:23,030
It's fine.

135
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,070
I will always remember

136
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:26,960
that you once saved my life.

137
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:34,840
How shameless, in broad daylight.

138
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,360
Your Highness, the Empress
requests your presence.

139
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:43,070
I'll go over there first.

140
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:44,070
Okay.

141
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:57,510
He just says he never forgets it,

142
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:59,400
but he doesn't want to help me at all.

143
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,000
Xiao Yehan.

144
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:05,400
You really are a heartless fool.

145
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:07,840
Young Lady, what should we do next?

146
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,840
Don't worry.

147
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,630
I have many ways

148
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,000
to deal with Xiao Yehan.

149
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,150
I needed to talk privately with Yehan

150
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,230
and didn't want others to be around.

151
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,310
Ruojin, you don't mind, do you?

152
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,270
You, an engaged woman,

153
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:34,070
met with another man
regardless of your reputation.

154
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:37,560
Since you don't mind,

155
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,230
why should I?
