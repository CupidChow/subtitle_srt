00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:13,510
Ruojin.

4
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:14,470
Ruojin.

5
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:17,760
Let me explain.

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,150
It's not what you think.

7
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:19,990
Your Highness.

8
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:21,400
You don't need to explain to me.

9
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,630
I don't care what is going on

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,960
between you two.

11
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:26,480
How can you not care?

12
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,710
Actually, I have already...

13
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,680
Watch out!

14
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:26,320
Xiao Yehan!

15
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:33,950
Your Highness.

16
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,240
Your Highness.

17
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:41,440
Xiao Yehan! Xiao Yehan!

18
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,320
Your Highness! Your Highness!

19
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,030
Xiao Yehan! Xiao Yehan!

20
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:52,880
Listen to me.

21
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,760
Don't speak.

22
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,880
Let me treat your wound first.

23
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,720
No.

24
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,760
I already know

25
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,320
it was Lin Yuexi who injured herself

26
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,840
and framed you.

27
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,200
So?

28
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:06,030
I've already made it clear to her

29
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:07,510
that it's over between us..

30
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,630
So you're not completely hopeless.

31
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,150
Hopeless?

32
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,280
Your Highness.

33
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:20,840
Are you saying His Highness...

34
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:23,840
Your Highness.

35
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,110
You're still so young.

36
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,800
And you don't even have any children.

37
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:31,480
How could you die so young?

38
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,360
If you say one more word,

39
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:34,840
I swear

40
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,510
you'll be the one to die young.

41
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,360
You should leave now.

42
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:42,000
I need to stitch up his wound.

43
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,920
His Highness can still be saved?

44
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,510
Thank heavens. Thank heavens.

45
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:48,590
Alright, I'll go out.

46
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:53,470
Bear with it.

47
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,760
- Done.
- Thank you.

48
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:33,350
What's wrong?

49
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:34,800
Is there another wound?

50
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,840
No, none.

51
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,550
In front of a doctor,

52
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,070
you shouldn't hide any injuries.

53
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:43,280
Really, there's nothing else.

54
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,720
I see.

55
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:55,480
Let me take a look.

56
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,600
No.

57
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,920
N-No way.

58
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,590
There are a lot of nerves in that area.

59
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:02,510
If not treated in time,

60
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:03,360
it could be dangerous.

61
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:04,550
Move your hand.

62
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:05,800
I can agree to anything else,

63
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,400
but absolutely not this one.

64
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:08,510
Will you move it or not?

65
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,030
A man's word is his bond.

66
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:11,070
If I say no, then no.

67
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:12,110
I'll ask you one more time.

68
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:13,590
Are you moving your hand or not?

69
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,440
Can't we have a nice talk?

70
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:17,800
Until now?

71
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:19,070
It's too late.

72
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,400
Men and women
shouldn't touch each other.

73
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,030
Stop this now.

74
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:26,920
To a doctor, there are only patients.

75
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:28,590
There's no distinctions
between men and women.

76
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,710
- Don't move.
- No, stop it.

77
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,960
- Let go of me.
- It'll be over soon.

78
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,080
Absolutely not.

79
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,510
- My poor prince.
- Let go of me.

80
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,150
Don't worry.

81
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:39,510
I've checked it throughly.

82
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,230
It's not a serious injury,

83
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,630
and won't affect its function.

84
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,710
Shut up.

85
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:47,510
Time to take your medicine.

86
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:54,590
You don't need
to be so concerned about it.

87
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,440
To us doctors,

88
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,110
it's just an organ,

89
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,590
no different from any other.

90
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:01,670
But you're not just a doctor to me.

91
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,320
You are everything

92
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,760
to me now.

93
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,710
You're not having a fever.

94
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:12,960
What nonsense are you talking about?

95
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,670
I'm serious.

96
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:17,880
Everything that's happened was my fault.

97
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:18,870
Ruojin.

98
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,150
Please forgive me

99
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:21,360
and come back to me.

100
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:22,480
I swear that

101
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:24,230
from now on, I will treat you well.

102
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,960
I will make up for

103
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,110
all the mistakes I've made.

104
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,710
We've already divorced.

105
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,230
Isn't it better for us to live
separately like this?

106
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,550
You don't need
to say these things anymore.

107
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:41,710
The Empress is here.

108
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:48,030
Greetings, Mother.

109
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,280
Mother.

110
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:51,590
How is Yehan's injury?

111
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:52,800
It didn't damage the bones.

112
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,440
With some rest, he will recover.

113
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:56,760
Thank you.

114
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,960
Having you as his wife

115
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,320
is truly Yehan's blessing.

116
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:02,480
Mother, if there's nothing else,

117
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:04,440
I have some matters to attend to
at the clinic.

118
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,510
I'll take my leave now.

119
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:09,470
Ruojin...

120
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:18,110
Now you regret it, don't you?

121
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:25,710
You already know?

122
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,400
Princess Consort Chu
has moved out for so long.

123
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,760
How could I not know?

124
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,440
It's all my fault.

125
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,800
I was deceived by others

126
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:34,800
and hurt Ruojin's feelings multiple times.

127
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,280
I've told you countless times.

128
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,550
Wealth is easy to find,
but a virtuous wife is rare.

129
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:41,280
A woman like Princess Consort Chu

130
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,960
is someone you must not lose.

131
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,320
Now that you realize your mistake,

132
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,670
go win her back.

133
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,670
But Ruojin doesn't seem
willing to come back.

134
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,510
Please help me, Mother.

135
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,840
No problem, leave it to me.

136
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:02,960
I'm suddenly not feeling well.

137
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:05,000
It's late at night, and I called you over.

138
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:06,630
You don't mind, do you?

139
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,190
Not at all. Mother.

140
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,960
I'm a doctor.

141
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:12,670
This is my responsibility.

142
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:18,590
But Mother, your pulse seems stable.

143
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,070
It doesn't appear
to be anything serious.

144
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:25,400
Then I must be overly anxious

145
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,670
and made a big deal out of it.

146
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,670
In that case,

147
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,510
I'll take my leave now.

148
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,400
But the palace gates are locked.

149
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:42,840
You and your husband
should stay in the palace for the night.

150
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:46,230
- But...
- It's settled.

151
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:47,880
Nanny Jiang, take them to rest.

152
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,670
Your Highnesses,

153
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:02,510
this way, please.

154
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:15,870
Nanny Jiang.

155
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:17,030
Nanny Jiang.

156
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:18,310
Why did you lock the door?

157
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:19,800
The Empress commands

158
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,920
that tonight,

159
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,560
you two must ensure she has a grandchild.

160
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,680
Otherwise, you can't leave this room.

161
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:27,270
What?

162
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:28,560
Mother's method

163
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:30,640
is a bit too direct, isn't it?

164
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,800
You are behind this, aren't you?

165
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,640
It's nothing to do with me.

166
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,640
I knew nothing about it.

167
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,360
Then what do you think

168
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,470
we should do now?

169
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,310
Mother is getting older

170
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,310
and naturally wants a grandchild.

171
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:52,800
Since we're already here,

172
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,680
why not

173
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:58,270
fulfill her wish?

174
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,230
Fulfill her wish?

175
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,600
