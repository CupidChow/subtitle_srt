=The Resilient Dr. Ling=

2
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:09,340
=Episode 27=

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:11,280
So what if I rebel?

4
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:15,890
This throne should belong to me!

5
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:17,760
Whoever dares stop me

6
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:19,450
will die!

7
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:22,890
Nanyang.

8
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:25,280
Aren't you afraid
of being condemned by the world

9
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:28,070
and scorned by all

10
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:29,450
for committing such treacherous acts?

11
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:30,970
My dear brother,

12
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:32,590
don't you understand

13
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:34,450
that winners take all?

14
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:37,530
Once I ascend to the throne,

15
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,360
I will hold absolute power.

16
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,120
By then,

17
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:44,160
whoever dares to oppose me,

18
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:47,160
I'll have them
and their entire family executed.

19
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,240
Guards!

20
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:52,070
Arrest everyone

21
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:53,160
here

22
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:56,850
and kill anyone who resists.

23
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:05,680
Guards!

24
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:13,930
Guards!

25
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:22,160
Guards!

26
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,330
Where are the guards?

27
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,320
Guards!

28
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,450
Are you all deaf?

29
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:31,330
Guards!

30
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:41,670
Your Majesty, Your Royal Highness,

31
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:43,670
my father has already returned
with the troops to save you.

32
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,370
All the rebels have been eliminated.

33
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,330
Impossible.

34
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,890
This is impossible.

35
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:55,890
You thought
the capital's defenses were weak

36
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,110
but you didn't know that I,
along with Lord Xie Nanyuan

37
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:01,050
and Marquis Zhennan,
had long prepared for this.

38
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:06,160
So, all of this is your plan.

39
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,490
Xiao Yehan,

40
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,850
how ruthless you are.

41
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,560
I am not willing to accept this!

42
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:23,680
Yoy have committed such heinous crimes

43
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:26,530
and yet show no remorse at all.

44
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,930
I cannot tolerate you any longer.

45
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:33,850
Announce my order.

46
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,720
Prince Yan is devoid
of virtue and ability

47
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,720
and is unfit to be
a member of the royal family.

48
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,160
From this day forth,

49
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:43,120
he is stripped of his royal status
and demoted to a commoner.

50
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:47,160
Imprison him
in the imperial prison for life.

51
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:52,320
Your Majesty,
with Prince Yan's intellect,

52
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,450
he could not have devised
such vicious plans on his own.

53
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,760
Someone must have been
assisting and inciting him.

54
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,970
Spare me, Your Majesty!

55
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,280
I knew nothing of it.

56
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,560
I haven't done anything!

57
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,330
I will take full responsibility

58
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:09,550
for everything.

59
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:11,120
All of it was done by me alone

60
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,680
and has nothing to do with Yuexi.

61
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,640
How could you!

62
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:18,370
Drag him out of here!

63
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:47,120
Nanyang, you and I both know

64
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,030
that you didn't act alone

65
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,560
in all these schemes.

66
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,930
Even now,
you're still protecting Lin Yuexi

67
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,720
and allowing her
to escape punishment?

68
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:57,280
I've already said

69
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,640
that all of this was done by me alone

70
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,330
and has nothing to do with Yuexi.

71
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:05,360
You won't get a single word

72
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,530
from me about her involvement.

73
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,190
Prince Yan, you really are devoted.

74
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:12,150
Do you really think that
by taking the blame for Lin Yuexi,

75
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:13,450
she will appreciate it?

76
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:15,970
My feelings for Yuexi are genuine.

77
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,510
Stop trying
to drive a wedge between us.

78
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:20,640
Well then,

79
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:24,450
why don't we let Prince Yan
watch a little show

80
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:28,120
and let you see her true colors?

81
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:37,440
Yehan, I don't want to die.

82
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,890
Please save me.

83
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:42,030
Now you regret it?

84
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:42,930
It's too late.

85
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:46,840
Ruojin, I know I was wrong.

86
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,840
I shouldn't have
competed with you for attention

87
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,480
and targeted you everywhere.

88
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,280
You can punish me however you want,

89
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:55,990
but poisoning the Empress and rebelling,

90
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:58,400
were all Xiao Nanyang's doing.

91
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,240
I really had no part in it.

92
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,640
Yehan, Ruojin,

93
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,510
please believe me.

94
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:06,720
I have no one else to rely on now.

95
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,890
Ruojin, if you still
refuse to forgive me,

96
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:18,680
I'm willing to accept punishment.

97
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,930
Why are you doing this?

98
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:30,370
After all, we'd been close
for many years,

99
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:32,680
how could I just watch you die?

100
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:36,640
Yehan.

101
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:40,530
I knew you wouldn't
just stand by and watch me die.

102
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:42,720
Wait here for a moment.

103
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:45,530
I'll go plead with Father for you.

104
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:48,120
Xiao Yehan,

105
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,760
this woman has committed so many evils

106
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,230
and you're still going to help her?

107
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:52,630
Are you out of your mind?

108
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:53,530
How dare you!

109
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:55,400
When has it ever been your place

110
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,490
to interfere in my decisions?

111
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,800
Fine, if you dare to help her today,

112
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,630
then I won't be
your Crown Princess anymore.

113
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:03,680
Make your choice.

114
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:08,190
Ling Ruojin,
have I been too lenient with you

115
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:10,080
to make you so bold and unruly?

116
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,280
Today,

117
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:13,360
I'm going to help Yuexi no matter what.

118
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,560
As for being Crown Princess,

119
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,120
make your own choice.

120
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,680
You saw that, didn't you?

121
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,890
Xiao Yehan has only loved me.

122
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:35,970
Who do you think you are

123
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,760
to compete with me?

124
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,280
In your heart,

125
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:44,120
whether it's Xiao Yehan
or Xiao Nanyang,

126
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,330
they're nothing more than pawns
you can manipulate at will.

127
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:53,530
That's right. Men are nothing.

128
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,080
Xiao Yehan may be a good man,

129
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:59,680
but his mother was of lowly status,

130
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,970
while Xiao Nanyang
is the son of a noble consort,

131
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,280
and has a better chance
of inheriting the throne.

132
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,330
So of course I chose him.

133
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:12,120
But unfortunately,
Xiao Nanyang is useless,

134
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,560
and all my efforts were wasted on him.

135
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:16,680
But to my surprise,

136
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,330
with your help, Xiao Yehan
became the Crown Prince.

137
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,240
Given his feelings for me,

138
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:25,560
all I need to do
is use a little bit of charm,

139
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:29,720
and the title of Crown Princess
will eventually be mine.

140
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,280
For that, I have to thank you.

141
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:35,970
But by doing this,

142
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,240
have you thought about Xiao Nanyang?

143
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:41,480
He took all the blame for you,

144
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,970
and now he's been demoted to a commoner.

145
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:44,960
Don't you feel any guilt at all?

146
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,280
He's just a fool!

147
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:49,680
He's a useless piece of trash.

148
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,720
He's of no use to me now,

149
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:55,970
and I find him
even more disgusting than a dog.

150
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:59,490
Just looking at him makes me sick.

151
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:04,640
You're scheming, venomous,
selfish and greedy.

152
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:06,760
Have you ever thought

153
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,080
about what would happen

154
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,240
if one day you're exposed?

155
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:14,010
Exposed?

156
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:16,050
What,

157
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,440
you plan to report me?

158
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,650
Ling Ruojin,

159
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:23,080
do you really think anyone

160
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,840
would still believe what you say?

161
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:25,970
No need for me to say it.

162
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,120
You've already said it all for me.

163
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,440
Come in.

164
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:37,460
(Prisoner)

165
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:40,930
Nanyang, you heard everything she said?

166
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,480
Your Highness, Your Highness.

167
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,110
It's not what you think, Your Highness...

168
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,520
Lin Yuexi,

169
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,690
I was so devoted to you.

170
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:56,050
I even took the blame for you.

171
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:59,570
And yet, to you,
I was nothing but a pawn

172
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,520
to be played in your hands.

173
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,270
I must have been blind

174
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:07,480
to have fallen
for a two-faced woman like you.

175
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:11,960
Your Highness, listen to me.

176
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,520
They set me up. They...

177
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,480
Enough!

178
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,240
Lin Yuexi,

179
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,160
I'm going to see Father right now

180
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:22,770
and expose all your crimes!

181
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,730
Your Highness! Your Highness!

182
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,480
Your Highness...

183
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,730
Although I don't understand
what he has over me,

184
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,160
since you've chosen him,

185
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:07,770
all I can do is wish you happiness.
