=The Resilient Dr. Ling=

00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:09,340
=Episode 18=

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,960
I'll still help you.

4
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:14,000
And you should

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,670
take your share.

6
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:26,000
Why are you here again?

7
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:28,990
What?

8
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:34,150
Are you annoyed that
I interrupted your date?

9
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:40,550
Yes.

10
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,880
We were having
a delightful conversation.

11
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,710
And your arrival

12
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:50,800
really spoiled the mood.

13
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:57,320
Anything you want, Prince Chu?

14
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,480
If not, don't disrupt our date.

15
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:02,390
You,

16
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,030
the son of Marquis Zhennan,

17
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,070
is dating my wife.

18
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:10,360
Don't you have a sense of propriety?

19
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:12,880
You're his wife?

20
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,360
Ex-wife.

21
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:18,070
We have long been divorced.

22
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:21,360
Did you hear that?

23
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,110
Ruoruo has nothing to do
with you anymore.

24
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:25,800
Isn't it inappropriate for you

25
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,960
to call her wife?

26
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,110
How dare you call her Ruoruo?

27
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,630
Ruoruo, Ruoruo, Ruoruo!

28
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:32,280
I called her, so what?

29
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,320
Ruoruo.

30
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,240
Shut up.

31
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:48,470
Okay.

32
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:51,960
This woman is really despicable.

33
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,360
She moved on so soon

34
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,150
and completely disregarded me.

35
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:59,190
A good young man woos
a fair maiden he loves.

36
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,880
But I have to say

37
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:03,480
Lord Xie Nanyuan really has a good eye,

38
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,920
almost as good as you do.

39
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,800
This is too much, really too much.

40
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,230
Although Marquis Zhennan
is wealthy and powerful,

41
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:12,880
being his son's wife

42
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,590
is nothing compared to
being Princess Consort Chu.

43
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:16,230
Xie Nanyuan is even more despicable.

44
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,240
He must have heard

45
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,440
that me and Ling Ruojin
have been on bad terms,

46
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,510
so he swooped in.

47
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,670
Prince Ning's birthday is coming soon.

48
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,510
His Majesty will host a banquet
in the palace.

49
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:26,840
Why not invite Her Highness
to go with you?

50
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:31,280
You can take the chance
to mend your relationship.

51
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,800
Since she wants to
start a new relationship,

52
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,510
there's no need for me
to mend the relationship.

53
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,550
But Lord Xie Nanyuan is involved...

54
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:38,630
I don't care at all.

55
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:41,360
But what if he wins her over?

56
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:48,840
Since it's Uncle Ning's birthday,

57
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,590
and she is still my Princess Consort,

58
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,360
it would be quite impolite

59
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,920
if she didn't attend.

60
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,150
You're right, Your Highness.

61
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:00,000
Although you don't want to
mend the relationship with her,

62
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,800
out of courtesy,

63
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,800
you still have to invite her.

64
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,600
Exactly.

65
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,760
Why do you

66
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,960
keep showing up?

67
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,760
Tomorrow is Uncle Ning's birthday.

68
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,710
Father and Mother are hosting
a banquet in the palace.

69
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:24,110
As juniors,

70
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:25,030
we should attend

71
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,360
out of courtesy.

72
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:31,590
This is proper business.

73
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,880
It's not that I want to see you myself.

74
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:44,510
Xiao Yehan, don't repeat something
more than three times.

75
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:45,670
This is the last time.

76
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:47,760
After the banquet,

77
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,630
explain everything clearly
to Father and Mother.

78
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:52,990
Alright.

79
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,710
How about wear this to the banquet?

80
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,150
I never wear this color.

81
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,510
But Her Highness likes red.

82
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:10,440
What does it matter to me?

83
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,280
Oh.

84
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,280
I'll wear it.

85
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,710
I want to dress festively

86
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,510
for Uncle Ning's birthday.

87
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,440
Yehan.

88
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,880
Why are you here?

89
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:32,960
I personally made this garment

90
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,320
for you.

91
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:35,670
For tomorrow's banquet...

92
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:36,510
No need.

93
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:39,230
I've already prepared my attire
for the banquet tomorrow.

94
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:44,920
I remember that you
never liked bright colors,

95
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:46,710
finding them too flashy
and ostentatious...

96
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:48,070
I've only recently realized that

97
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,710
though bright colors are ostentatious,

98
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,190
they are open and honest,

99
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:53,360
unlike those who scheme

100
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,030
and play dirty tricks.

101
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:57,800
If that's the case,

102
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,960
I will make another

103
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,550
bright-colored garment for you.

104
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:04,110
There's no need for you
to trouble yourself with it.

105
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:09,550
Yehan, don't be so polite with me.

106
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:11,880
I am already married,

107
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:13,280
and you are about to be wed.

108
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:16,110
We should keep our distance.

109
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,960
Yehan, you must be joking.

110
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,960
Didn't you already divorce Ruojin?

111
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:23,920
That is my private matter

112
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,990
and has nothing to do with you.

113
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:27,190
I still have official duties to attend to.

114
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,280
You should leave now.

115
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,550
Keep our distance.

116
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,510
Yehan,

117
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,630
since when did you become so cold towards me?

118
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,920
Is it because of this wretched woman?

119
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,880
Are you still thinking about her?

120
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,800
Answer me!

121
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,230
Xiao Yehan has already divorced you,

122
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:03,880
and yet you still shamelessly
try to seduce him!

123
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,710
Don't let me catch you in the act,

124
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:11,280
or I will make sure
you die a terrible death!

125
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,150
Prince Ning truly is His Majesty's

126
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:23,510
full younger brother.

127
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:24,670
He is of noble status.

128
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,800
Not only is his birthday banquet
held in the palace,

129
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,440
but it's also incredibly grand and lively.

130
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,070
I also heard

131
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:33,000
that Princess Consort Ning
is about to give birth.

132
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,550
to their first child.

133
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:37,400
Prince Ning must be overjoyed.

134
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,600
Ah?

135
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:40,800
He must be thrilled.

136
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,590
So for this banquet, we must

137
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:44,960
dress up nicely

138
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,070
to have some fun.

139
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:53,320
Isn't this the dismissed
Princess Consort Chu?

140
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,630
How do you still have the nerve
to come here?

141
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,960
If I were you,

142
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:58,800
I would have killed myself.

143
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:02,480
I was wondering who it was.

144
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:05,440
Turns out it's you,
the foolish princess.

145
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:08,280
Since that last palace banquet

146
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,510
when you knelt down
and kowtowed to me in apology,

147
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:12,400
I haven't seen you around.

148
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:14,800
I thought you were so ashamed

149
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,960
that you might have killed yourself.

150
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:19,350
- You...
- Let's go.

151
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,000
Only members of the royal family

152
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,480
are invited to attend today's banquet.

153
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,760
You are no longer Princess Consort Chu.

154
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:36,070
Isn't it inappropriate for you to attend?

155
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,120
That's right.

156
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,880
Now, you

157
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:40,920
are not even qualified to set foot here.

158
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,320
Guards!

159
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:44,760
Take this intruder out of the palace.

160
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,000
I'd like to see who dares.

161
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,630
I brought Ruoruo here.

162
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,840
What?

163
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,990
Does anyone have an issue with that?

164
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:56,960
Ruoruo, let's go.

165
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,760
I'd like to see who dares stop us.

166
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,800
Wait, My Lord.

167
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:09,190
You might not be aware that

168
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:12,840
she is a discarded Princess Consort

169
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,000
with a ruined reputation.

170
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:16,350
If you get too close to her

171
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,190
and word gets out, it will definitely
tarnish your reputation.

172
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,350
Who do you think you are?

173
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,680
Are you qualified to tell me what to do?

174
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:29,720
Ruoruo is beautiful and kind-hearted,

175
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:34,000
a hundred times better than
a scheming woman like you.

176
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,430
I am the future Princess Consort Yan.

177
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,760
Are you disregarding

178
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,560
Prince Yan's dignity?

179
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,480
Princess Consort Yan.

180
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:55,030
Not to mention
aren't even married to him yet.

181
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:56,680
Even if Prince Yan were here,

182
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,760
I would still curse him.

183
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:07,030
If you insist on associating with her

184
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,760
desipte the reputation,

185
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:12,270
she still lacks recognition and status.

186
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:16,390
What right do you have
to bring her to the banquet?
