00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:07,420
=The Resilient Dr. Ling=

2
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:09,340
=Episode 15=

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:11,920
Dr. Ling.

4
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:13,710
You think highly of yourself

5
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:15,710
and disdain to associate with us.

6
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,360
Why did you come here then?

7
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:20,960
Nowadays, there is an infectious fever
spreading in the capital city.

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,360
The people are suffering.

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,670
But you guys took advantage of this

10
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:27,170
and raised the price
of forsythia suspensa.

11
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:29,510
Isn't this despicable?

12
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:32,000
We didn't force them to buy.

13
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:33,000
The price is clearly marked

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,400
and whoever wants to buy it
can pay for it.

15
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,400
You're meddling too much.

16
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,190
Dr. Ling's compassionate.

17
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,150
Why don't you just buy
all the forsythia suspensa

18
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:44,510
and give it to the people for free?

19
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:46,920
That will earn you a good reputation.

20
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:52,000
Dr. Ling.

21
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,550
If you want a share of the pie,

22
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,880
kneel, serve us tea

23
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,630
and admit your mistake.

24
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,400
Then I'll count you in.

25
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,320
If you came only to seek justice,

26
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:07,110
you'd better get out quickly.

27
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:11,710
Since this is the case,

28
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:14,280
you guys

29
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,800
don't regret it.

30
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:22,630
Quite a character.

31
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:29,670
Forsythia suspensa is not
the only medicine to reduce fever.

32
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:32,230
We need to guarantee
the efficacy of the medicine

33
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:33,880
and not let them have their way.

34
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:44,110
I got it.

35
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,440
Thanks to this epidemic,

36
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,880
a day's income
from selling forsythia suspensa

37
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,960
is worth the money I earned
for ten years.

38
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:05,440
I just want more people to get sick.

39
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:08,030
Then we'll make a fortune.

40
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,190
These days,

41
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:10,440
Dr. Ling stole away our business

42
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:12,630
leaving our clinics empty.

43
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:15,760
Now we can hold our head high.

44
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,630
Going against the Guild

45
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,630
is like seeking a dead end.

46
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,880
Exactly.

47
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,070
Sir, big trouble.

48
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,670
There's a new prescription for the fever.

49
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:29,320
All the forsythia suspensa
we hoarded are now wasted.

50
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:35,150
What's going on?

51
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,060
- Don't worry, take your time.
- Thank you.

52
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:38,910
One by one.

53
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:40,260
- Everyone can get one.
- Here.

54
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:41,840
- Everyone has it.
- Give me one.

55
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:44,070
- Thank you, thank you.
- Let me tell you.

56
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:47,110
The main ingredient of
this prescription is honeysuckle.

57
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,070
You can find it
in the suburbs of the city.

58
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:51,280
If needed,

59
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,280
you can pick it yourself.

60
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,230
Understand?

61
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,670
- Take it.
- Great, we are saved!

62
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:57,880
Thank you, Dr. Ling.

63
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,230
- Thank you, Dr. Ling.
- You're welcome.

64
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,800
- Thank you.
- Ma'am.

65
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,800
- Excuse me, excuse me.
- Ling.

66
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,120
Make way, make way.

67
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:06,590
You are going too far.

68
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,320
Since ancient times,

69
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,920
it's perfectly justified to spend money

70
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,190
on medical care and medicine.

71
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:13,480
You first attracted customers
with low prices

72
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,880
and then invented a free medicine.

73
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:18,550
Do you want to cut off
our financial resources?

74
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,000
So what?

75
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:22,150
You put the people's lives in danger

76
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,000
just to make money.

77
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:25,920
If we don't practice medicine for money,

78
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,150
isn't a waste

79
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,280
to what we've learned?

80
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,150
Wishing that no one
in the world is ill,

81
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:31,840
I'd rather the medicine
on the shelf gather dust.

82
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,840
And what about you?

83
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,320
As doctors,

84
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,670
you're all driven by selfish desires.

85
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:36,710
You don't deserve to be doctors.

86
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:37,550
That's right.

87
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:38,480
- You...
- You...

88
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:40,510
Who hit me?

89
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,160
Hit him.

90
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,190
- Who?
- Kill him.

91
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,960
- Kill him.
- Unscrupulous quacks.

92
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,800
- You deserve to die.
- Stop.

93
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,990
Stop it.

94
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:48,920
It's them

95
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,030
who inflated drug prices

96
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,300
- to seek profits.
- You guys just wait.

97
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,720
Loser.

98
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:00,630
A sure thing got away.

99
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:02,150
If it please Your Highness,
may you see clearly.

100
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,510
It's all Ling Ruojin's fault.

101
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:05,030
She's standing in our way.

102
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:07,110
So,

103
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:08,630
it is her.

104
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:11,440
She opposes me in every way.

105
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,840
Could it be that Yehan instructed her?

106
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:16,510
Impossible.

107
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:19,320
Xiao Yehan had long
drawn a clear line with her.

108
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,760
The medical clinics in the capital

109
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:24,320
are one of my most important
sources of income.

110
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,720
Yuexi.

111
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,510
Help me think of a solution.

112
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:33,960
Ling Ruojin, without the title
of Princess Consort Chu,

113
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,960
is like an ant.

114
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:39,110
We just need to crush her.

115
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,120
Yes, yes, yes.

116
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,280
Xiaozhu.

117
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:06,280
The medicinal herbs
haven't been delivered today?

118
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,150
I'll go remind them.

119
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:09,320
No need.

120
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:12,550
No more medicinal herbs
will be delivered.

121
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:18,320
The Capital Physicians' Guild
issued a ban order

122
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:19,630
that from today,

123
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:23,000
any pharmacopolists who dare to
send medicinal materials to you

124
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:24,800
is going against the Guild.

125
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:27,590
The Guild will cut off all ties with them.

126
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:28,960
Dr. Ling, rest assured.

127
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:31,280
You can continue with the consultation.

128
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,360
But anyone who buys from us
with your prescription

129
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,400
will be charged ten times
the usual price.

130
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:37,760
You've gone too far.

131
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:40,630
Do you regret it now?

132
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:42,030
Too late.

133
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,760
Once you offended the Guild,

134
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,670
there would be a price to pay.

135
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,760
Isn't it just a ban?

136
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,110
What's so scary about it?

137
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:52,630
I don't believe

138
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,150
you can stop all the pharmaceutical suppliers
from working with me.

139
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,230
Still so stubborn.

140
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,320
Fine.

141
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:59,000
Let's wait and see.

142
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,760
Young Lady.

143
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,630
They are clearly forcing us to close.

144
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:07,920
What should we do about this?

145
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,920
Don't worry.

146
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:13,670
I'll figure something out.

147
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:19,020
(Chunfeng Clinic)

148
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:20,990
What?

149
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,510
You changed your mind

150
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,190
and want to be my personal physician?

151
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:27,910
Actually,

152
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:29,840
I came to see you today

153
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:32,280
to discuss a deal with you.

154
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,190
Tell me about it.

155
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,230
I heard that your father
is Marquis Zhennan.

156
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:40,480
He defends the border for the country

157
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:42,710
and his fiefdom is in
the southern border of Great Feng

158
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,800
where various herbs are growing.

159
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:47,510
Half of the medicinal herb business

160
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:49,670
is controlled by Marquis Zhennan.

161
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,510
Am I right?

162
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:54,190
More than half,

163
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,800
80% of the medicinal herbs
in the entire capital city

164
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,800
is managed by my family.

165
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,000
One command from me can make

166
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:03,480
all the pharmacies go bankrupt.

167
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,600
What?

168
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:08,920
Your clinic has been placed
under a ban.

169
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,590
You're reaching a dead end

170
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:13,550
so you turn to me?

171
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:19,280
But why should I help you?

172
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,320
Do you want to pledge to marry me?

173
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,320
Do you think I'm the kind of person

174
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:29,190
who judges others by appearances?

175
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,640
No.

176
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,840
My Lord.

177
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,280
I didn't mean that.

178
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,880
I don't allow you to say that.

179
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,920
Daring to try

180
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,960
shows one's courage
to challenge oneself.

181
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:41,000
If you pledge to marry me,

182
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:44,630
maybe I will agree to help you.

183
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,760
I won't challenge this.

184
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,400
However, My Lord,

185
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,800
I have an even better thing.

186
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:00,320
