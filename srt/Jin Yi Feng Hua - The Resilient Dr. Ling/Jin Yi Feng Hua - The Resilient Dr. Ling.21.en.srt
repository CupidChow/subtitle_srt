=The Resilient Dr. Ling=

2
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:09,340
=Episode 21=

3
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:19,280
Are you still thinking about
the meal with Her Highness?

4
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:21,600
Ridiculous.

5
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:23,320
I've tasted all the delicacies.

6
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,440
It's just a meal.
Why would I be thinking about it?

7
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:33,070
I can't believe this woman.

8
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,190
She doesn't have any sincerity at all.

9
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,840
I didn't say I wouldn't eat.

10
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:37,920
Exactly.

11
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,760
If you're willing to attend,

12
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,510
people would certainly feel honored.

13
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:43,800
Only Her Highness
is straightforward and forthright,

14
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,190
unwilling to flatter anyone.

15
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:46,510
It makes her stand out even more.

16
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,000
Unlike Lin Yuexi,

17
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:49,800
who seems gentle and harmless
on the surface,

18
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,110
but is full of malice inside.

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,510
She stabbed herself to frame Ruojin,

20
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,670
and also falsely accused her
of harming Aunt Ning.

21
00:00:58,110 --> 00:00:59,550
Every time Ruojin saves someone,

22
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:00,840
she stirs up trouble on the side,

23
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:01,880
trying to obstruct her.

24
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:05,640
Back then,

25
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,710
I really misjudged her.

26
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:09,360
Indeed.

27
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:11,300
Fortunately, Her Highness

28
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:12,670
saved Princess Consort Ning's life

29
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:13,760
and proved her innocence.

30
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,320
But Your Highness,

31
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:17,150
Her Highness performed a C-section

32
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:18,360
and both mother and child survived.

33
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:20,630
She really can work miracles.

34
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,030
Not only that,

35
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:24,110
she composed a hundred poems,

36
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:25,150
each one extraordinary.

37
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,000
Her talent

38
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,630
is truly rare in this world.

39
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,360
Like this one.

40
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:37,630
Hardly do rivers count
when an ocean has been gone through.

41
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,670
Clouds are worth nothing
except those over the mount of Wu.

42
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:44,480
Every time I pass by the garden,
I care not about the flowers.

43
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:47,110
It's partly for practice of Taoism,
partly for my love to you.

44
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,480
It's truly poignant

45
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:51,880
and touching.

46
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,320
So this means, having seen
the ocean and Mount Wu,

47
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,920
No other clouds

48
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:59,760
and rivers compare.

49
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:01,480
Having loved one man,

50
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,630
no other man can ever measure up.

51
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,760
I see.

52
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,360
Her Highness is expressing her feelings

53
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,320
to you through this poem.

54
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:13,990
Really?

55
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,400
Everyone in the capital knows
Her Highness admires you.

56
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:20,230
If this poem isn't written for you,

57
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:22,360
then who could it be for?

58
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,510
She could have presented

59
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:28,440
this love poem to me in private.

60
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:30,920
But she read it aloud in public,

61
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,960
making it difficult for me to respond.

62
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:35,550
Girls are shy by nature.

63
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:37,800
How could she feel comfortable
directly expressing her feelings?

64
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,110
Why don't you ask her out again

65
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,710
to express your feelings to her?

66
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,320
That makes sense.

67
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:46,590
As a man,

68
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:47,840
I should take the initiative.

69
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:52,510
Ouch.

70
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,800
Ouch.

71
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:56,430
Ouch.

72
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,840
What's wrong?

73
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,480
His Lordship is feeling chest pain.

74
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,840
Please check on him quickly.

75
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,550
What are the symptoms?

76
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:07,960
Shortness of breath,

77
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,110
rapid heartbeat.

78
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:14,150
I feel like something is about
to burst out of my chest.

79
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,780
Where is it? Here?

80
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,790
- Does it hurt to breathe?
- No.

81
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:18,960
It's...

82
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:20,760
It's really about to burst out.

83
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:21,740
This...

84
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:24,150
This is for you.

85
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:25,070
Do you like it?

86
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:28,070
Xie Nanyuan,

87
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,190
I'm busy. I don't have time for this.

88
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:34,590
I'm not joking with you, Ruoruo.

89
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,630
I genuinely like you.

90
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,920
We are not suited for each other.

91
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,200
But...

92
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,550
Why not?

93
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:44,550
You're beautiful,

94
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:46,880
and I'm rich.

95
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,110
You're a skilled doctor,

96
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:50,920
and I have lots of money.

97
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,150
You have endless talent,

98
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,920
and I have endless money.

99
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:56,510
We're a perfect match.

100
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,880
I think you

101
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,000
not only have money

102
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,230
but also have a mental problem.

103
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:07,320
Ruoruo.

104
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:12,440
It's okay if you don't accept me now.

105
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,800
But

106
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:16,070
since we've worked together before,

107
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:18,000
having a meal together
isn't too much to ask, is it?

108
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,360
No, I don't want to.

109
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,440
I have a lot to do.

110
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,440
Get out of my way.

111
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:26,480
If you don't agree today,

112
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,000
I'm not leaving.

113
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:31,440
Are you leaving or not?

114
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,720
I'm not leaving.

115
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,000
Fine, let me tell you.

116
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,190
Just this once.

117
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:43,710
After this meal,

118
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:45,960
you're not allowed
to fool around anymore.

119
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,630
Deal.

120
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:55,840
Candied hawthorn.

121
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,840
Ruoruo.

122
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:59,030
- Want some candied hawthorn?
- Candied hawthorn!

123
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,760
I'll take one.

124
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:05,890
Floral fabric! Floral fabric!

125
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:09,000
Let go.

126
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:11,360
I'm buying this to Ruoruo.

127
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:14,000
My wife wants candied hawthorn,

128
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,920
so I should buy it for her.

129
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,670
Sir, one stick, please.

130
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:21,800
You've already written the divorce letter,

131
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,320
so she's not your wife anymore.

132
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,880
That's none of your business.

133
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,800
It is my business, so what?

134
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,550
Both of you, let go!

135
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:30,840
You two grown men

136
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,840
are arguing over
a stick of candied hawthorn.

137
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,800
Isn't that childish?

138
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:38,360
Sir, I'll take them all.

139
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:40,840
I'll pay double.

140
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,060
The candied hawthorns are mine.

141
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:43,920
I'll pay ten times more.

142
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:45,960
Trying to outbid me?

143
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:49,320
I've never lost before.

144
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,720
Take them all.

145
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:54,710
Gentlemen, stop fighting.

146
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:55,590
That lady

147
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:56,670
left a long time ago.

148
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,240
Well,

149
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,920
aren't you annoying?

150
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,400
My date was going well,

151
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,800
and you ruined it.

152
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,760
Let me tell you.

153
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:08,760
If you dare to harass Ruojin again,

154
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,510
don't blame me for being ruthless.

155
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:15,840
Ruoruo? Ruoruo?

156
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:17,800
Xie Nanyuan

157
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:20,000
is clinging to my wife.

158
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,550
It's utterly shameless.

159
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,710
Lord Xie Nanyuan may have lots of money,

160
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,550
but what women care about isn't wealth,

161
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:29,400
but sincerity.

162
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,960
As long as you can make her
feel your sincerity,

163
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:35,360
she will surely come back for you.

164
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,240
You're right.

165
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,480
Since she likes candied hawthorns,

166
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,480
I will personally make

167
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,630
a unique one for her.

168
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,400
Is this

169
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:54,070
a candied hawthorn?

170
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,590
Yes and no.

171
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,800
His Highness crafted it

172
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,110
using pigeon bloodstone
from State of Siam.

173
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:06,030
Pigeon bloodstone is incredibly hard.

174
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:08,960
His Highness took eight days
to make this,

175
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,230
wearing out nine files,

176
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,360
and finished with ten blisters on his hands.

177
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:17,150
Well,

178
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,070
you went through so much trouble

179
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,070
to make an inedible
fake candied hawthorn.

180
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:23,670
Were you just bored?

181
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:25,390
Do you

182
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:27,320
feel anything from it?

183
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,320
Yes.

184
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:41,550
I

185
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:43,360
feel

186
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,590
you're out of your mind.

187
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,200
Young Lady,

188
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:55,320
I waited in line for four hours
at Zuixian Restaurant,

189
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,550
but I still couldn't buy
your favorite red bean cake.

190
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,670
Oh, that's okay.

191
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,480
Buy it again next time.

192
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,230
Maybe we'll have better luck then.

193
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,220
What's wrong?

194
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,720
Your Highness.

195
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:24,720
Are you ready?

196
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,880
Yes, I'm ready.

197
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,150
So

198
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,520
what should we do next?

199
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,480
I don't know.

200
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:33,030
Then how are we going
to make red bean cakes?

201
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:34,680
With my vast knowledge and skills,

202
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,800
a mere red bean cake

203
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,000
is nothing hard to me.

204
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:41,550
- Follow my lead.
- Yes.

205
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:50,110
Your Highness.

206
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:52,840
Should I go Zuixian Restaurant to buy some?

207
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:57,000
How can store-bought ones

208
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:58,840
compare to the ones I make myself?

209
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,840
Let's go.

210
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:04,470
Your Highness.

211
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:04,310
Your Highness.

212
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:20,990
We made it.

213
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:26,760
Physician, physician!

214
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:29,190
Your Highness, hang in there!

215
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:31,960
Physician, physician!

216
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,230
I made them myself.

217
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:38,070
Try it.

218
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,110
It tastes good.

219
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,390
It was a piece of cake

220
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,840
for me to make these.

221
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,640
Since it's so easy,

222
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:57,270
would you please make 20 more potions for me?

223
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:03,230
Easy peasy.

224
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:15,720
20 portions.

225
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:17,920
How long will this take?

226
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:19,800
As long as she likes it,

227
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,920
not to mention 20 portions,

228
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:23,520
I will even make

229
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,800
200 more portions.

230
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,960
- You're here!
- Miss.

231
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:33,000
Come, stand in front of me.

232
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:34,030
Stand in front of me.

233
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:35,880
What did I promise you today?

234
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,110
- Red bean cakes, right?
- Red bean cakes!

235
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:37,960
Here, smell it.

236
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:39,230
Come on, don't rush.

237
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:40,600
- Everyone gets one. Here.
- Your Highness

238
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,140
- You worked so hard to make these.
- Here you go.

239
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:44,310
- But Her Highness gave them all away.
- Don't be shy. Who else?

240
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,050
- Alright, here's yours.
- Shh.

241
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:47,800
- And here's another for you.
- Good, and another one for you.

242
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:50,390
- There's more for you.
- Hold it carefully.

243
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,440
Good.

244
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:56,720
Almost caught you!

245
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,640
Run, run!

246
00:11:59,030 --> 00:11:59,880
Catch me!

247
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,800
Over here, over here.

248
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,030
Come and catch me.
