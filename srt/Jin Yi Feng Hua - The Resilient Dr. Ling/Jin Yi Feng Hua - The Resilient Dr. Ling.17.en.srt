00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:07,420
=The Resilient Dr. Ling=

2
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:09,340
=Episode 17=

3
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:11,590
The Empress did not summon me.

4
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:13,000
Why did you deceive me
into coming here?

5
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:13,880
As children,

6
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,550
it's only natural to pay respects
to our mother.

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,510
Do we have to be summoned to do so?

8
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:18,630
Don't you realize?

9
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:20,110
We have nothing to do
with each other anymore.

10
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:20,950
Wait a moment.

11
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:22,120
What's up?

12
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,030
What are your next plans?

13
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:33,230
I'll be seeing patients at the clinic

14
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:34,630
and going home tomorrow
to visit my mother.

15
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,480
What does this have to do with you?

16
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,320
See you around.

17
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:38,470
Wait a moment.

18
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:41,110
What's wrong again?

19
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,510
After all, we were a couple.

20
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,320
I have never met
my mother-in-law before.

21
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,630
It's against the rules of propriety.

22
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,510
Even now we are separated,

23
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:53,760
we need to observe proper etiquette

24
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,670
to avoid giving others grounds
for gossip.

25
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,230
No need.

26
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:03,030
This is the first time I've heard

27
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,110
that people like you

28
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,550
know the rules of propriety.

29
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,280
Ridiculous.

30
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,160
This...

31
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:20,680
It's so late. Who is it?

32
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:25,550
Bring them in quickly.

33
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,120
Your Highness.

34
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:40,800
What are you doing?

35
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:43,710
These are what I have prepared
for you to wear tomorrow.

36
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,150
If you're dressed too shabbily

37
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:46,480
when you go home tomorrow,

38
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:49,030
your parents will think
I didn't treat you well.

39
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:51,510
Xiao Yehan.

40
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,320
What trick are you playing now?

41
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,190
Nothing.

42
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,280
By the way,

43
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,960
after careful thinking,

44
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,230
I think we still need
to observe etiquette.

45
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:08,400
So I have decided
to go back with you tomorrow.

46
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,240
In your dreams.

47
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,280
We are divorced.

48
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,550
We have no relationship now.

49
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:15,800
Xiaozhu, see him off.

50
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,480
- Young Lady...
- See him off.

51
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:20,920
Your Highness, please.

52
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:31,190
Young Lady, do you think

53
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,070
His Highness's attitude towards you
is a bit strange now?

54
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,800
That vile man is capricious.

55
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,280
What's so surprising about it?

56
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,150
Do you think His Highness
might be regretting it now?

57
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:43,320
How is that possible?

58
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,320
He hates me to the core,

59
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,070
like I'm a thorn in his side.

60
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:50,070
He'd love nothing more than
to get rid of me.

61
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,800
Ignore him.

62
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,160
Time to sleep.

63
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:02,110
Let go of me.

64
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:03,070
You despicable person.

65
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,920
I left these lands and shops to Ruojin.

66
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,000
I cannot give them to you.

67
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,550
Your daughter is already a loser

68
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:10,000
and has been divorced by Prince Chu.

69
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,800
What use are these valuable things for her?

70
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,670
Let go.

71
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,670
You are talking nonsense.

72
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,440
I am talking nonsense?

73
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,510
Go to Prince Chu's Mansion
and ask yourself.

74
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:20,710
I'm afraid you can't even
get through the main gate.

75
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,110
Then I must leave them for Ruojin.

76
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:24,950
Let go.

77
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,760
This is Master's order.

78
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:29,190
Do you want to defy Master?

79
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,120
Mother.

80
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:31,920
The old woman's shops and lands
will belong to you,

81
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,550
but can I have the jewelry?

82
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:34,670
OK.

83
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,400
But you have to take them all.

84
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,800
Don't leave a single piece for her.

85
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:39,760
Okay.

86
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:47,230
What are you doing?

87
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:51,350
Go away.

88
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:54,630
Mom, please get up.

89
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:57,880
Let me have a look.

90
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,840
You two are looking for trouble.

91
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,280
What are you being arrogant for?

92
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,000
Still think you're Princess Consort Chu?

93
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:06,400
Don't think that we don't know

94
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:09,280
Prince Chu already divorced you
and kicked you out.

95
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,440
You're as useless as your mother.

96
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,280
Shut up.

97
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:12,880
How dare you hit my daughter?

98
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,920
- You...
- Get lost.

99
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,760
Stop.

100
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,150
Master.

101
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:18,480
- Master.
- Dad.

102
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,770
- Right after Ruojin came back,
- Mother.

103
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:21,250
- she started hitting me and Jinyu.
- It's fine.

104
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,230
You have to help us.

105
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:30,190
You arrogant

106
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:31,630
and unscrupulous creature.

107
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,000
Kneel down and admit your mistake.

108
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:35,480
These two wicked women

109
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,670
insulted my mother first

110
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,060
- and then me,
- You...

111
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,280
so I slapped them.

112
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,120
What's wrong with it?

113
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:41,920
People from the Ling family

114
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:43,630
should be disciplined by me.

115
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,110
You, an abandoned woman,
have no right to punish them.

116
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,840
I see now.

117
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:51,630
I wondered how they got the courage

118
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:53,550
to steal my mother's treasure.

119
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,630
It's because of having a father like you

120
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:59,880
who takes advantage of my misfortune.

121
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:02,800
You're unworthy of being a father
and a husband.

122
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,920
- You...
- Ruojin.

123
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:06,320
- How dare you talk back.
- Ruojin.

124
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:08,400
Guards, give me the stick.

125
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,360
- Let me go.
- Master.

126
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,360
- I will kill you today.
- Let me go.

127
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,280
- Master.
- Get away.

128
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,360
Prince Chu is here.

129
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,670
Let go, let go.

130
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,510
Your Highness.

131
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:29,920
I apologize for
not welcoming you earlier.

132
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:31,440
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

133
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,190
My daughter behaved inappropriately

134
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:39,360
and upset you.

135
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,000
I was just about to give her a lesson

136
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,110
to vent your anger.

137
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:43,440
When is it your turn

138
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,030
to teach my wife a lesson?

139
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,760
Didn't you divorce her?

140
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,190
Yesterday, I went to the palace with her

141
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:54,760
to visit Mother.

142
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,230
Where did you hear

143
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,320
that we got divorced?

144
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,670
Yuexi told me this in person.

145
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:01,710
You have wrote the divorce letter.
How could it be fake?

146
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,030
I said that this is not true.

147
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:13,630
Mr. Ling dotes on your concubine
and disrespects your wife,

148
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:17,000
instigated your concubine to steal
your wife's dowry

149
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,320
and used illegal punishment
against Princess Consort.

150
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,070
Every of these is a serious offense.

151
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,230
Your Highness.

152
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,710
I apologize.

153
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:27,510
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

154
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,510
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

155
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:30,960
The three of you,

156
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:34,320
go to the government office
to get flogged 30 times.

157
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,160
Yes.

158
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,550
- Yes.
- Yes.

159
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:46,470
Come.

160
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:49,230
Greetings, Mother-in-law.

161
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,320
Your Highness, you're too kind.

162
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:54,990
Bring them here.

163
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:05,960
Just a small token.

164
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,670
Mother-in-law, please accept these gifts.

165
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:11,550
She is just a humble merchant's daughter

166
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:13,200
and doesn't deserve such gifts
from His Highness.

167
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:15,360
Your daughter is disrespectful

168
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,510
and insubordinate.

169
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,240
Mr. Ling.

170
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,400
is this how you've raised them?

171
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,030
You troublemaker.

172
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,510
You have no right to speak

173
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:26,920
in front of His Highness.

174
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:30,510
Apologize to them quickly.

175
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,590
Your Highnesses,

176
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,360
I was wrong.

177
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,920
Princess Consort's mother
is my mother.

178
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:46,320
From now on,

179
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,400
who dares to disrespect her

180
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,320
is going against me.

181
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:56,280
I will show no mercy.

182
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,840
Yes.

183
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:03,480
What did you mean today?

184
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,360
We have already divorced.

185
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,030
Why did you pretend
to be a filial son-in-law

186
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:08,800
in front of my mother?

187
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:10,480
My mother-in-law is kind and amiable.

188
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:11,710
We clicked right away,

189
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:13,070
so I just showed a token of appreciation.

190
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:14,590
Unreasonable.

191
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:16,470
Wait.

192
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:25,600
Why don't you move back?

193
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,030
Xiao Yehan, did you lose your memory?

194
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:31,230
We got divorced.

195
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:35,680
I just feel that if your father

196
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,920
knew that you and I were separated,

197
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:40,430
he might bully your mother again.

198
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:41,270
No need for that.

199
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,680
But after what you did today,

200
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:48,270
I don't think they'll do anything

201
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:49,760
to Mother these days.

202
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:51,270
I will find a way

203
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:53,390
to rescue her myself.

204
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:07,340
(Military Training Guide)

205
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:09,720
Your Highness,
are you missing Her Highness?

206
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:12,390
Who said I'm missing her?

207
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,030
I am studying military strategies.

208
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,720
It's upside down.

209
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:22,600
Your Highness.

210
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:25,190
If you miss Her Highness, go find her.

211
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,150
I have humbled myself
and went to her so many times.

212
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:30,840
But she still remains unmoved.

213
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,680
How can I go find her again?

214
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,600
You're right.

215
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:37,030
Her Highness is beautiful, talented,

216
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,520
and has superb medical skills.

217
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,920
If you're too embarrassed to go,

218
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,430
others will be eager to.

219
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:44,600
What if someone else targets her...

220
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:46,190
Who dares?

221
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,560
You've written the divorce letter.

222
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,470
Her Highness is now available.

223
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,720
I heard that

224
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:53,840
Lord Xie Nanyuan has
visited her frequently.

225
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:58,920
Her Highness is at the clinic.

226
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:02,580
(Map)

227
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:05,720
Hu medicine needs a cool, damp environment

228
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,230
with strict conditions.

229
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:10,600
Where will it be?

230
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:14,470
Xiao Yehan,

231
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:16,110
why are you everywhere...

232
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:18,310
My Lord?

233
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:20,270
How did you come here?

234
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:22,310
What?

235
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:25,350
Are you not happy to see me?

236
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,390
Other women

237
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:29,310
would have jumped onto me.

238
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,470
Just say what you want.

239
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,520
If not, you can go about your business.

240
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,190
I'm busy here.

241
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,110
This is boring.

242
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,640
Your beauty masks
earned me a lot of money.

243
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,070
Here's your share.

244
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,350
My Lord, I won't

245
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:56,600
take this share.

246
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,000
I would like to ask you a favor.

247
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:01,190
Tell me.

248
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:03,190
I would like you to help me check

249
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:05,350
for caravans smuggling Hu medicine
in the capital.

250
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:10,560
The capital city is so vast

251
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,680
with many caravans.

252
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,680
Isn't this like finding a needle
in a haystack?

253
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,920
If someone else said this to me,

254
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:18,150
I'd believe them.

255
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,430
But, My Lord, you are a big shot.

256
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,560
This kind of thing

257
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,350
is a piece of cake for you.

258
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:27,230
Well said.

259
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,070
I can handle

260
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:31,270
all the difficult things in the world.

261
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:33,920
Since you know so much about me,

262
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:35,840
I will help you.

263
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:38,840
Thank you, My Lord.

264
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:41,390
You're being too polite.

265
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,110
We're friends.

266
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,070
I'll still help you.

267
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,960
And you should

268
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,150
take your share.
