3
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:12,680
Just do it right now?

4
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:14,760
I'm not ready for this.

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,330
What are you thinking?

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,050
We're just putting on a show

7
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,370
for Mother to see.

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,200
Now, yell it out.

9
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:26,720
Men don't yell for this kind of thing.

10
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:27,600
I won't do it.

11
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,600
Are you going to yell or not?

12
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:37,970
Louder.

13
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:50,680
Who would've thought that
His Highness, usually so serious,

14
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:53,010
could be so wild behind closed doors?

15
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:01,930
Looks like we need to go even wilder.

16
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,010
Alright, stop.

17
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,490
Finally, we got through it.

18
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,970
That was exhausting.

19
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,760
The old rule.

20
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,200
I sleep in the bed,
and you sleep on the floor.

21
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:32,760
The floor is so cold.

22
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,070
My injury isn't healed yet.

23
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:35,600
What if I catch a cold?

24
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,440
Alright, you sleep in the bed.

25
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,410
I'll sleep on the floor.

26
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:44,160
How could I let a lady
sleep on the floor?

27
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:46,200
Actually...

28
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,360
Actually, the bed is

29
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,070
big enough for both of us.

30
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:51,160
Keep dreaming.

31
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,880
You think I don't know what's going on

32
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,970
in that head of yours?

33
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,400
As a prince,

34
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,280
I would never do something so low.

35
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:01,720
Rest assured.

36
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,200
I promise...

37
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:51,070
It's all my fault.

38
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:52,840
I was impulsive
when I wrote the divorce letter.

39
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,320
That's why we're in this situation now.

40
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,560
Your Highness, don't worry.

41
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,070
If you can get the divorce letter back,

42
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:59,330
everything will be fine.

43
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:11,300
(Divorce Letter)

44
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,050
What are you doing over there?

45
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,120
N-Nothing.

46
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,330
Hand it over.

47
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:31,010
Give it to me.

48
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,490
You're up in the middle of the night

49
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,560
just to steal this from me?

50
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:41,120
Let me tell you.

51
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:43,920
This is the proof of our divorce.

52
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,810
I need to keep it safe.

53
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,440
Xiao Yehan, are you crazy?

54
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,640
From now on, the divorce letter is gone.

55
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,490
Our divorce
is completely null and void.

56
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:04,630
Even if you destroy the letter,

57
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:07,280
it doesn't change the fact
that we're already divorced.

58
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,450
Did I do something wrong?

59
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,680
If so, tell me, and I'll change.

60
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,560
Everything that happened before
was my fault.

61
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,120
Now I understand my true feelings

62
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,840
and know who I should cherish.

63
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,890
If you're unhappy
with what I did before,

64
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:25,010
at least give me a chance to explain

65
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,890
and prove myself.

66
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,410
Just let it go.

67
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:35,280
Our marriage was a mistake
from the start.

68
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:37,010
Ending it sooner

69
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:38,840
is better for both of us.

70
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,050
But even so,

71
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,930
I'm willing to
keep this mistake forever.

72
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:58,720
I don't want that!

73
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,280
I just want to be with one person forever.

74
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,330
But you are from the royal family,

75
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:08,240
destined to have multiple concubines.

76
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,070
I want to practice medicine

77
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,240
and live freely.

78
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,000
But you're destined
to be entangled in power struggles

79
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,160
and political schemes.

80
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:19,160
We are

81
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,010
simply not suited for each other.

82
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,050
Are you saying

83
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,760
you have no feelings for me at all?

84
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:31,970
None.

What are you thinking about?

122
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,890
Why are you here?

123
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,070
I finally found the caravans

124
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:20,770
you asked for,

125
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:22,110
after a lot of effort.

126
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:23,010
Really?

127
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:28,880
Here

128
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,320
is the secret base of the caravans.

129
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:49,770
Wolfberry pollen,
black spiderwort, and red snake beans.

130
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,160
It really is here.

131
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,520
I took on the mission myself.

132
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,890
How could I be wrong?

133
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,600
But,

134
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:02,200
you would never guess
who the real owner of this pharmacy is.

135
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,200
If it's not Xiao Nanyang,

136
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:06,520
then it must be Lin Yuexi.

137
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,520
As expected, you're so clever.

138
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,730
It's them.

139
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,850
That's great.

140
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,770
With this evidence,

141
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,850
we can finally bring them to justice.

142
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,650
The plague we created in Jiangzhou
has fully erupted.

143
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,560
That's excellent.

144
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,070
I'll go to the palace right away

145
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:37,890
to recommend Xiao Yehan
for the relief work.

146
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:41,360
Liu Chun, the medical official in Jiangzhou,
is one of my people.

147
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,400
If Xiao Yehan takes on the relief work,

148
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,190
at best, he will likely fail

149
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:47,280
and be heavily impeached.

150
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,110
At worst, he could contract the plague

151
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:50,360
and never return.

152
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:58,050
Your Highness,

153
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,730
do you have to go to Jiangzhou?

154
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,480
Speak your mind.

155
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:06,960
This relief mission was strongly
recommended by Prince Yan.

156
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,070
Last time, he didn't succeed
in the assassination.

157
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:11,690
I'm just worried
that this might be a trap.

158
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:15,240

are suffering greatly.

159
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,280

00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:19,810
Even if there are dangers ahead,

161
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:21,480
I have to go.

00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,850
