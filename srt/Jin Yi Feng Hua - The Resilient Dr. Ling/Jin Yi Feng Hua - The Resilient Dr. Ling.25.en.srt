00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:07,420
=The Resilient Dr. Ling=

2
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:09,340
=Episode 25=

3
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:19,870
Your Highness.

4
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:21,030
I've investigated.

5
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,880
This plague is fierce.

6
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,550
At least 30% of the people
in Jiangzhou have been infected,

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,960
and the plague is still spreading.

8
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:30,110
What is the Jiangzhou
Medical Office doing?

9
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,190
With so many people sick,

10
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:34,550
are you just letting them lie in the streets

11
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:35,880
without caring whether they live or die?

12
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,800
Please calm down, Your Highness.

13
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,880
This plague is complex

14
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:40,840
and spreads quickly.

15
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:42,960
It's impossible to prevent or cure it.

16
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:44,590
It's just their bad luck

17
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:46,630
that these patients got sick.

18
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:48,760
(Liu Chun, Chief Physician)
Even if you're angry with me,

19
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,630
I am powerless to help.

20
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:51,710
- Your Highness.
- You...

21
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:54,760
Nobody in Jiangzhou

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,190
can treat this disease.

23
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:58,990
Let me try it.

24
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:04,590
Why are you here?

25
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,160
It's urgent to treat the disease.

26
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:09,030
Xiaozhu, the needle.

27
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:22,070
Rash all over the body,

28
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:23,000
and the fever won't break.

29
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,920
This is Feverborne Disease
from the Western Regions

30
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,960
and it's highly contagious.

31
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:30,880
We must immediately isolate

32
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,360
all the patients.

33
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:34,190
I'll write the prescriptions

34
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:36,960
and have the doctors in Jiangzhou
treat them at the quarantine site.

35
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:37,990
But...

36
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:39,840
Her words are my command.

37
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:40,880
Do you dare defy me?

38
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,440
No, no, I wouldn't dare.

39
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,280
Wait.

40
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:49,000
Immediately burn the bodies
of those who have died.

41
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,190
Also, disinfect the streets
with lime powder three times a day.

42
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:59,630
Make masks in this style

43
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:00,590
and distribute them.

44
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,760
Whether infected or not,
everyone must wear one.

45
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,710
Understood?

46
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:04,840
Understood, understood.

47
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,550
I'll handle all of this immediately.

48
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:08,430
Wait.

49
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:18,710
Take care.

50
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,720
You too.

51
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,640
Doctor.

52
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,320
Why have we all been locked up here?

53
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:36,670
Yes, why?

54
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,360
I want to go home.

55
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,110
We're all trapped here.

56
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:41,110
Everyone, listen to me.

57
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:43,150
You were brought here for isolation

58
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,230
so that you can receive better treatment.

59
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:47,070
Please trust me.

60
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,230
- Everyone will recover.
- Yes, yes.

61
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:50,960
So we'll stay here for now.

62
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:53,030
Dr. Ling, please save us.

63
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,760
Be thorough with the lime.

64
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:57,910
Okay.

65
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:00,030
Your Highness,

66
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:01,920
take a rest.

67
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,070
You haven't slept for days.

68
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:03,910
Let me handle it.

69
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,840
- No need.
- Over there.

70
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,280
Ruojin is still working hard.

71
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,190
How could I rest?

72
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:08,030
Let's continue.

73
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:20,440
How is the situation outside?

74
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:24,000
The plague in the city is under control.

75
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,440
Patients in the quarantine ward
have taken your medicine

76
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,440
and are recovering.

77
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,710
This is all thanks to you.

78
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,280
But you should get some rest.

79
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:32,550
Eat something.

80
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:40,510
Don't get the wrong idea.

81
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:42,230
I don't mean anything else.

82
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,510
I just don't want you
to overwork yourself

83
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,150
and collapse from exhaustion.

84
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,240
Thank you.

85
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,280
You take care of yourself too.

86
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:56,000
I've noticed you seemed to
lose some weight recently.

87
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,840
It's nothing.

88
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,800
I'll be going now.

89
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,630
Actually, it's not just recently
that His Highness has lost weight.

90
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:47,360
Since you and he were separated
at the palace,

91
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,840
he has been constantly thinking of you.

92
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:50,230
He hasn't enjoyed tea

93
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,360
or food,

94
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:53,400
and has grown thinner day by day.

95
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:55,800
When you came to help,

96
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,510
His Highness was happier than anyone,

97
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,000
but he kept it to himself.

98
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,440
Even though he's been busy
during this time,

99
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,400
he's always been thinking of you.

100
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:04,480
This bowl of porridge

101
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,800
was made by His Highness himself for you

102
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:09,480
after staying up for hours.

103
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,120
What?

104
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:24,400
The plague in Jiangzhou
has been controlled?

105
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:25,440
How is that possible?

106
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:27,880
Plagues have always been
city-destroying disasters.

107
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,850
They last for months at least

108
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:29,710
and years at most.

109
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:32,150
How could this one
be controlled so quickly?

110
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:33,550
It's absolutely true.

111
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:35,150
As soon as the plague broke out,

112
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:37,880
Princess Consort Chu ordered the patients
to be isolated from the healthy.

113
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,190
She even introduced the use of masks

114
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:41,190
and lime disinfection.

115
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:44,230
And I heard she also came up
with a treatment prescription.

116
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:47,670
Now the patients in Jiangzhou
are gradually recovering.

117
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:49,510
They are even praising her
as a miracle-working doctor.

118
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:51,190
Ling Ruojin, it's her again!

119
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:53,840
How many more of my plans
will this wretched woman ruin?

120
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:54,990
Get out.

121
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:55,950
Yes.

122
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,920
What do we do now?

123
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,630
This woman is highly skilled
in medicine.

124
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,000
With her help,

125
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:06,190
the plague
we've worked so hard to spread

126
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:08,590
not only failed to kill Xiao Yehan

127
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,480
but will also end up benefiting him.

128
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:16,960
Don't worry, Your Highness.

129
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:18,840
Saving lives is hard

130
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,340
but harming them is easy.

131
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:23,540
Ling Ruojin has just prescribed
medicine for the patients, right?

132
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:26,900
All we need to do
is secretly kill her patients

133
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,180
and then arrange for someone
to stir up the people,

134
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:33,820
making them believe that
everything is Ling Ruojin's fault.

135
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,460
I guarantee

136
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:39,630
she'll end up with no place
to be buried.

137
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:36,700
They were fine last night.

138
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,340
How did they all suddenly die?

139
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,540
Could it be that
the illness flared up again?

140
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:41,380
That's impossible.

141
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,140
My prescription wouldn't have failed.

142
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,020
Even if the illness did flare up,

143
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:47,540
it couldn't have killed
so many people in one night.

144
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,580
Someone tampered with the medicine.

145
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:02,560
Who was here last night?

146
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,460
There aren't many who
have access to the quarantine ward.

147
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:06,140
It should be easy to find out.
Huo Chong.

148
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,660
Yes, I'll handle it immediately.

149
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,340
So many died in just one night,

150
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:15,900
and they were all poor commoners.

151
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:19,020
The culprit couldn't have
had personal grudges against them.

152
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:22,780
So there's only one explanation.

153
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:26,140
Someone doesn't want

154
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,460
to see us solve this plague so quickly.

155
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:31,860
Someone wants to escalate the situation.

156
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:38,460
Evil woman, come out!

157
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:44,020
Everyone,

158
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,260
listen to me.

159
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:46,540
This evil woman

160
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,500
claimed she would cure us,

161
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,460
but she has killed everyone!

162
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,380
By cremating the bodies
and isolating the sick,

163
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:54,820
she's just trying to wipe us all out!

164
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,100
Listen to me.

165
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:59,480
- Everyone, please listen to me.
- Let her speak.

166
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:02,100
Cremating the bodies
and isolating the sick

167
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:04,180
is to control the disease.

168
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:07,740
The patients inside
were about to recover

169
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:09,580
but they were sabotaged today.

170
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:11,060
So listen to me.

171
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:12,660
You must go home immediately.

172
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,980
Only at home
can you contain the disease.

173
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:17,460
Otherwise, all our previous efforts
will be in vain.

174
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:18,380
Bah!

175
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,780
Sabotaged?

176
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,780
You're clearly the murderer.

177
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:23,740
Yes, she's the murderer!

178
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:24,860
Beat her to death!

179
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,220
- Kill her!
- Watch out!

180
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:29,500
Hit her!

181
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:30,900
Hit you!

182
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,220
Everyone, stay calm.

183
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,500
Everyone, stay calm.

184
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:50,780
I understand how you feel.

185
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,340
But please, calm down first.

186
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,580
Dr. Ling is highly skilled

187
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:56,540
and kind-hearted.

188
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:58,980
Thanks to her hard work

189
00:09:58,980 --> 00:09:59,900
day and night,

190
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,380
the plague is under control.

191
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,420
She is the benefactor
of the people of Jiangzhou,

192
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:04,540
definitely not an evil woman

193
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,300
and certainly not a murderer.

194
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:07,540
If it's not her, then who?

195
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,680
Why should we believe you?

196
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:10,850
I swear on my life.

197
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:11,690
Yes.

198
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:14,380
This matter has nothing
to do with Dr. Ling.

199
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:16,260
We are investigating the real culprit.

200
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:19,100
I promise I will give you all
a satisfactory explanation.

201
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:20,300
Otherwise,

202
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:22,220
you may deal with me as you see fit.

203
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,100
The culprit has been caught.

204
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:26,500
Liu Chun?

205
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:28,380
Why him?

206
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,260
Is it really him?

207
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:30,540
Your Highness.

208
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,380
Liu Chun has confessed everything.

209
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:34,740
He is the one who killed the patients
in the quarantine ward yesterday.

210
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:36,620
When I arrived,

211
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:39,380
he was packing, ready to flee.

212
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:41,860
Spare me, Your Highness!

213
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,780
Did you see it?

214
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,300
The real culprit has been caught.

215
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,300
Please listen to Dr. Ling

216
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,300
and go home first.

217
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,140
I will administer justice fairly

218
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,580
and punish this man severely.

219
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:53,940
Please go home.

220
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,140
Go home, all right?

221
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,060
We'll trust you one more time.

222
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,540
Make sure
to punish the culprit severely.

223
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:06,780
Are you all right?

224
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:08,900
I'm fine.

225
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:10,420
You...

226
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:13,500
You are my wife.

227
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:15,620
It's only natural for a husband

228
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,100
to protect his wife.

229
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:21,380
Xiao Yehan.

230
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,380
Xiao Yehan. Xiao Yehan?
