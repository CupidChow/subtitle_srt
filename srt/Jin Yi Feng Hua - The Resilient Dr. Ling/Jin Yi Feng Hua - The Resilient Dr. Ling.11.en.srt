00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:07,420
=The Resilient Dr. Ling=

2
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:09,340
=Episode 11=

3
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:20,940
How is the Empress doing?

4
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:23,360
Her Royal Highness suddenly
suffered from thoracic obstruction.

5
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,030
Her pulse is very weak now.

6
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:26,230
Although I have used the medicine,

7
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:28,900
I'm afraid
there's little chance of surviving.

8
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:30,580
(Thoracic obstruction?)

9
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,360
(Isn't that miocardial infarction?)

10
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,240
Loser.

11
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,550
If you can't cure the Empress,

12
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:37,170
I will kill you!

13
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,630
If it pleases Your Majesty,

14
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:40,190
I have done my best.

15
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:42,990
But this disease is extremely dangerous

16
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:44,550
and is known to be terminal.

17
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:45,620
It's recorded in the medical book

18
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:46,730
that those who have this disease...

19
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,440
Those who have this disease...

20
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,380
Say it!

21
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,030
Are faced with

22
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:52,580
imminent death.

23
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:03,230
- Father.
- Your Majesty.

24
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:04,070
Father.

25
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:13,070
His Majesty just got overwhelmed
by anxiety.

26
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:14,400
Fortunately, there is no major issue.

27
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,290
Just take some calming medicine
and he'll be fine.

28
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:19,170
Anyway, my mother can't get better.

29
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:20,960
Father.

30
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,130
I will take care of Father.

31
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:23,760
Father.

32
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,600
Slow down.

33
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:29,020
Be careful, Father.

34
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:35,060
Mother.

35
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,380
Mother.

36
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,030
(If rescued in time,)

37
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:40,380
(there is still a glimmer of hope.)

38
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,290
What are you doing?

39
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:51,480
Let me go.

40
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,900
I can cure Mother's illness.

41
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:55,670
Even the imperial physician can't help it.

42
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:57,500
What use is your meager medical skill?

43
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:59,550
I will never allow you

44
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:01,070
to risk Mother's life.

45
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:02,020
Go out.

46
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,720
You...

47
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,940
are looking for death.

48
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:20,190
One more word

49
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,630
and Mother will be in more danger.

50
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:22,590
Step aside.

51
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:23,730
Don't get in the way.

52
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:33,130
Stop.

53
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:36,590
Stop it!

54
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,630
You are not allowed to hurt her.

55
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:39,690
- Wake up!
- Stop.

56
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,940
(Oh no, he's resistant to antibiotics.)

57
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,330
You are so bold.

58
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:47,660
How dare you hurt Mother!

59
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:49,960
Mother is in critical condition,
and you gave her random medications.

60
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,210
You are killing her.

61
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:53,400
Yehan.

62
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,170
Mother.

63
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,510
Xiao Yehan, you...

64
00:02:58,510 --> 00:02:59,350
Mother.

65
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,210
Mother, you're awake.

66
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,030
Your Majesty, from the pulse,

67
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:23,630
Her Royal Highness's illness
has shown signs of improvement.

68
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:25,240
It won't be long

69
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,730
before she recovers.

70
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,380
Great!

71
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,590
Yehan.

72
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:34,240
Your wife saved the Empress.

73
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,150
I will remember this credit.

74
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:38,380
When the Empress recovers,
I will reward her generously.

75
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:40,800
- Thank you, Father.
- Thank you, Father.

76
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,730
Get up.

77
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,070
Although I was seriously ill before,

78
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:52,730
I was still sensible.

79
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,630
In order to save me,

80
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:56,360
you were almost injured by Yehan.

81
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,580
Sorry for that.

82
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,280
Whether as a daughter-in-law
or a doctor,

83
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,060
it is my duty to save you.

84
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,330
I don't feel wronged.

85
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:21,070
This is my token,

86
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:23,630
seeing it is like seeing me.

87
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,290
(Token)
Today I'm giving it to you.

88
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:26,670
From now on,

89
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:27,840
except for His Majesty,

90
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,330
no one can hurt you.

91
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:36,330
Thank you, Mother.

92
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,920
At the banquet last time,

93
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,470
I was amazed by your poetic talent.

94
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:43,670
I didn't expect you to have
such accomplishments in medicine.

95
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:45,060
Impressive.

96
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,030
It's Yehan's good fortune

97
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:48,540
to marry you.

98
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,770
Mother, you flatter me.

99
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,860
Greetings, Your Royal Highness.

100
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,840
Do you feel better now?

101
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,900
Much better.

102
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,030
Thanks to Princess Consort Chu.

103
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:06,730
I will ask Yehan
to thank her properly for me.

104
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:12,840
In Great Feng,

105
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,100
treating patients
requires a medical license.

106
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:17,330
But according to what I know,

107
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:19,800
Ruojin doesn't have
a medical qualification.

108
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,070
If it is for the sake of receiving credit,

109
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,690
and something went wrong

110
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,400
while you treated Her Royal Highness
without authorization,

111
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:28,250
how could you take the responsibility?

112
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:31,650
Princess Consort Chu,
you really don't have the qualifications?

113
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,070
Mother,

114
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:41,580
I don't have it.

115
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:44,110
Your Royal Highness, see?

116
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:45,080
She admitted it herself.

117
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,630
She practiced medicine without a license

118
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:47,980
and violated the laws of Great Feng.

119
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,900
This is a big mistake.

120
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:52,070
So what if she has no license?

121
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:54,480
You act like you know her well.

122
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,790
Princess Consort Chu made a mistake,

123
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:57,170
why are you so happy?

124
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,540
I'm not.

125
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,150
You misunderstood me.

126
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:04,550
Princess Consort Chu
does not have a medical qualification,

127
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:06,230
but knowing that it violates the law,

128
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:08,060
she still stood up to help me.

129
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,030
Such kindness

130
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:12,170
can set a good example
for all doctors in the world.

131
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,800
Guards.

132
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,860
Issue a medical qualification
to Princess Consort Chu immediately.

133
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,760
Thank you, Mother.

134
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,280
Are you mistaken, Your Highness?

135
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,760
She practiced medicine illegally

136
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,030
and put your life at risk.

137
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:25,840
She should be flogged 50 times.

138
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,440
If you let her go like this,

139
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,130
I'll feel sorry for you.

140
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:31,250
Sorry?

141
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:33,400
I don't even feel sorry.

142
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,290
Why do you feel sorry?

143
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:37,590
Princess Consort Chu saved my life,

144
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:39,290
but you are always targeting her.

145
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:42,190
Are you dissatisfied

146
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:43,730
that I recovered?

147
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,800
Your Royal Highness,
please calm down.

148
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,770
I dare not.

149
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:48,170
Yes, yes, yes.

150
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:49,760
Yuexi

151
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:52,770
just accidentally spoke her true thoughts.

152
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:58,690
Mother, you can punish her
with a few flogs

153
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:01,170
as a minor reprimand.

154
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:03,330
Your Royal Highness, please spare me.

155
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:05,440
I'm just concerned for your safety

156
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,650
and means no harm.

157
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,190
Since you care so much about me,

158
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:11,880
go to the temple and copy
the Diamond Sutra 100 times

159
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,770
to pray for me.

160
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,580
Don't come here until you finish it.

161
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:18,130
Yes.

162
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,940
It's all Ling Ruojin's fault.

163
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,060
She got lucky and saved the Empress.

164
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,800
Now the Empress is favoring her.

165
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,250
It makes me so angry.

166
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:45,940
Not only that,

167
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,690
Xiao Yehan's mother
came from a humble background.

168
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:51,280
Father did not value him.

169
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,940
But now he's changed his attitude.

170
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,770
If it goes on like this,

171
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:58,730
he will threaten my position
sooner or later.

172
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:05,380
Now Ling Ruojin serves the Empress
in the palace every day.

173
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:07,380
If anything happens to the Empress

174
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,500
during this period...

175
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:17,170
If the Empress is in trouble,

176
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,780
Ling Ruojin can't escape the blame.

177
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:22,430
Xiao Yehan also will lost his backing.

178
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:24,290
He'll be manipulated at will then.

179
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,570
Killing two birds with one stone.

180
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:29,860
Brillant!

181
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:51,250
Are you sure Mother's illness

182
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,100
is no longer serious?

183
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,980
As long as I'm involved,

184
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:59,570
the treatment will be effective.

185
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:04,250
I underestimated
your medical skills before.

186
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,570
I regard the Empress as my birth mother.

187
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,480
Since you saved her,

188
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,290
I will definitely return your favor.

189
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,430
It's really rare.

190
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:17,760
Prince Chu can actually

191
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,780
say something nice.

192
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:21,370
How dare you!

193
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:34,530
What is this strange thing?

194
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,100
Why can it instantly drain my strength?

195
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,100
This thing is called a tranquilizer.

196
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:43,800
One shot

197
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:47,780
can either paralyze you

198
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:51,370
or make you completely unconscious.

199
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:56,860
You wouldn't even know
if someone cut you open.

200
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:01,570
You know too many

201
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,330
of these cruel methods.

202
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:07,130
You're afraid?

203
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,840
I'm telling you.

204
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,560
If you dare to provoke me again,

205
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,290
I will still give you a shot.

206
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:17,740
I'm tired, time to sleep.

207
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:21,800
There is only one bed in this room.

208
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,430
Where should I sleep?

209
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:24,740
You can sleep on the floor.

210
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:27,230
How could I, a prince,

211
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:28,570
sleep on the ground?

212
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:31,330
Do you want

213
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:35,100
to share a bed with me?

214
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:36,980
You...

215
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:41,430
Shameless.

216
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:42,450
Time to sleep.

217
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,700
Your Highnesses.

218
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,410
Your Highnesses.

219
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,190
The Empress is not feeling well again.

220
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:57,450
You'd better go and have a look.
