00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:07,420
=The Resilient Dr. Ling=

2
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:09,340
=Episode 16=

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:11,760
Ling Ruojin

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,400
actually got connected with
the son of Marquis Zhennan.

5
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:17,000
I really underestimated her.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,360
The ban,
which was thought to be foolproof,

7
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,480
actually failed to bring her down.

8
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:24,550
I just don't know

9
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,000
how close she is
to the son of Marquis Zhennan.

10
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,230
Marquis Zhennan's powerful and wealthy.

11
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,960
I cannot afford to offend them.

12
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,800
She was abandoned by Prince Chu.

13
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,360
How could a lord Possibly
be interested in her?

14
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:42,150
She just got lucky this time.

15
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,590
What should we do next?

16
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:50,590
Close her clinic

17
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:54,030
and let her die a graveless death.

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,760
Keep taking this prescription
for another week

19
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,000
and you'll be almost fully recovered.

20
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,070
What are you here for?

21
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,480
You've got some skills.

22
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,590
After being driven out
of Prince Chu's Mansion like a dog,

23
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,360
you actually opened a clinic.

24
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:33,710
I'm sure you've fawned over
Lord Xie Nanyuan a lot.

25
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:35,800
If you have nothing else,
get out of here quickly.

26
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,400
I only save those
who are worth saving.

27
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:40,880
Your heart is too tainted and vicious

28
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,590
to be cured.

29
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,880
We don't treat people like you.

30
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:48,590
Still so sharp-tongued.

31
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:50,360
What a pity.

32
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,030
I can deprive you of the title

33
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:56,190
and also shut down your clinic.

34
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,720
Smash it.

35
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:07,220
(Chunfeng Clinic)

36
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:08,070
Stop.

37
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,320
Stop.

38
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,590
Who allowed you to smash my signboard?

39
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:12,590
Your clinic is operating illegally.

40
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,360
According to the law,
we should smash your signboard

41
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,000
- and shut down your clinic immediately.
- Nonsense.

42
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,800
Our clinic has
all the proper licenses.

43
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,840
What evidence do you have
to say that we're operating illegally?

44
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,280
Cut the crap.

45
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,920
If I say it's illegal, then it is.

46
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:23,030
There's no need for evidence.

47
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:25,630
I don't believe

48
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,510
that Lord Xie Nanyuan
will help you this time.

49
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:30,190
- Stop.
- Get out of my way.

50
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:31,030
I won't.

51
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,360
Hit them.

52
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,480
The Empress's token is here.

53
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:39,760
Who dares to make a move?

54
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:42,920
Try it.

55
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,150
Your Royal Highness.

56
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,280
Are you okay?

57
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,800
What about you?

58
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,940
(Token)

59
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,400
Seeing the token
is like seeing the Empress.

60
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,630
How dare you not kneel?

61
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,030
Are you defying the Empress?

62
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:12,000
Now,

63
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:14,880
kowtow and apologize to me.

64
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,360
No way.

65
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,800
So,

66
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,110
(Token)
you do want to defy the Empress.

67
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:29,070
I'm sorry.

68
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,320
I was wrong.

69
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,840
Speak louder.

70
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,670
I didn't hear you.

71
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:37,670
I'm sorry.

72
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,960
I was wrong.

73
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:41,230
That's more like it.

74
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,320
I won't forget

75
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,150
how you humiliated me today.

76
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:54,710
You'd better remember it well.

77
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,070
Today I can make you kneel once,

78
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:59,710
then I'll make you kneel
ten times or a hundred times.

79
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:02,190
What other tricks do you have?

80
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:03,920
Just use them.

81
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,360
How are you doing, Mother?

82
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,440
Much better.

83
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,320
Thanks to Princess Consort Chu.

84
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:14,630
After taking her medicine,

85
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:18,110
I haven't had the chest pain
that bothered me in the past.

86
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:22,670
Why didn't Princess Consort Chu accompany you
to the palace today?

87
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:26,550
Mother,

88
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:29,400
she has been feeling unwell recently.

89
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,230
and isn't in the best condition
to visit you.

90
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,960
Is she alright?

91
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:33,990
Yes.

92
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,590
Rest for a few days and she'll be fine.

93
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:39,030
I've seen countless people.

94
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,280
Women like Princess Consort Chu
are truly rare.

95
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:44,000
She is exceptionally talented

96
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:45,190
and highly skilled in medicine.

97
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,510
The most important thing is
that she is pure and kind,

98
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:51,070
unlike others, who are scheming.

99
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,360
Don't miss the forest

100
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,320

101
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:00,350

(Young Ling Ruojin)
Are you okay?

119
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,280
I was bitten by a poisonous snake.

120
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:20,360
I'm dying.

121
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,190
It's okay.

122
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:23,920

123

Your Highness.

129
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,990
This is part of the evidence against Prince Yan
for his involvement in the cheating case.

130
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:50,670
This is his bribery ledger.

131
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,070
This is the list of gifts he received.

132
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:59,140
(A dragon-patterned dagger)

133
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:00,460
(A precious jade pendant)

134
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:01,900
(A dragon-patterned dagger)

135
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,460
(A dragon-patterned dagger)

136
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,000
This dagger belongs to Yuexi?

137
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,670
Yes, I have confirmed that.

138
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:12,110
This dagger was personally crafted
by a master in the South.

139
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:13,760
It's one of a kind, with no duplicates.

140
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,630
After Prince Yan received it,

141
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:17,630
he gave it to Miss Yuexi
as a betrothal gift.

142
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:22,350
Yuexi.

143
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:24,110
Lin Yuexi, you are crazy.

144
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:30,880
She deliberately stabbed herself

145
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,840
and blamed it on me.

146
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:34,150
She didn't lie.

147
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:36,480
I wronged her.

148
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,630
Come to think of it,

149
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:39,800
since Princess Consort married here,

150
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,550
she hasn't done anything bad

151
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:43,710
but has been doing good deeds
and saving people.

152
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,320
First, he saved Jiu.

153
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:47,480
Then our detective.

154
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,000
Not long ago, she saved the Empress.

155
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:53,030
And she never asked
for anything in return.

156
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:55,550
I've seen countless people.

157
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:58,480
Women like Princess Consort Chu
are truly rare.

158
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,400
Then someone

159
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,480
pressed on my stomach
for a long time

160
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:04,590
and the hawthorn got out.

161
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,920
And then I passed out.

162
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:08,430
Here.

163
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,440
Shut his mouth.

164
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,670
You're really a miracle-working doctor.

165
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,000
I'm impressed.

166
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,760
If something happens to Mother,

167
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,000
I will never forgive you.

168
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,520
Yehan.

169
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:20,990
Mother.

170
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:24,920
The most important thing
is that she is pure and kind,

171
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:27,470
unlike others, who are scheming.

172
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:29,070
Ruojin, don't.

173
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:33,800
Let me remind you for the last time.

174
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,070
Lin Yuexi is the cunning
and deceitful one.

175
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:37,230
Believe it or not.

176
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,600
She used the same trick twice.

177
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,800
Only a fool like you would believe that.

178
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:48,640
I was wrong.

179
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,000
I was wrong.

180
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:51,880
Here you go.

181
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,230
- The medicine is ready.
- Thank you, Dr. Ling.

182
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:54,070
Take care.

183
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,600
What's wrong? Where does it hurt?

184
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:03,600
What's wrong?

185
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,150
Where does it feel uncomfortable?

186
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:06,150
Let me take a look.

187
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:10,230
Don't cry.

188
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:12,230
I will wipe it for you.

189
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:17,150
Okay, it's clean now.

190
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:19,030
Your Highness?

191
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:20,000
Good boy.

192
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,110
Why are you here?

193
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:23,150
- Thank you, Miss.
- Go.

194
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,560
Xiao Yehan.

195
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:35,600
What are you doing sneakily here?

196
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,430
Nothing.

197
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:41,600
How come my jade pendant is with you?

198
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,960
This is your jade pendant?

199
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:47,030
Of course.

200
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,800
It's you.

201
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:51,470
It's really you.

202
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,840
What do you mean?

203
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:55,640
What are you here for?

204
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:00,430
Mother misses you.

205
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,190
She wants you
to go to the palace immediately.

206
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,640
You didn't tell her about us, did you?

207
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:08,880
Mother has just recovered.

208
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:11,640
I am worried it might upset her
and harm her health,

209
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,190
so I didn't tell her about our divorce.

210
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,720
If you don't want to go, just forget it.

211
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,230
A happy mood

212
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:21,600
can indeed help the body recover faster.

213
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:25,190
Okay, I'll go with you.

214
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,390
- Mother.
- Mother.

215
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:35,680
How did you come here?

216
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:37,390
Yehan said you are sick.

217
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,600
It's better to rest at home.

218
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,110
Why did you go out?

219
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,600
