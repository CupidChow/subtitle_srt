=The Resilient Dr. Ling=

2
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:09,340
=Episode 7=

3
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:12,760
- Your Majesty, Your Highness.
- Father, Mother.

4
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:15,590
Today is Qixi Festival.

5
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,030
(Emperor, Empress)
It's a palace banquet and a family feast.

6
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:19,480
Everyone, have fun.

7
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:20,760
Just make yourself at home.

8
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:22,440
Thank you, Father.

9
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:25,110
- Thank you, Father.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.

10
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:30,670
Honey.

11
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:33,630
This grape is as sweet as you.

12
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:34,480
Have a taste.

13
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:35,960
The kids are all watching.

14
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:36,920
Be serious.

15
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:39,100
(Princess Dansha)

16
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,920
You really won't feed me?

17
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:45,390
Come on.

18
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:46,550
I'm not eating.

19
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:56,190
You are Princess Consort Chu?

20
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,280
Rumors have it that you are ugly.

21
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,360
But clearly

22
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,000
you're a beauty.

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,360
Mother, you are indescribably

24
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,480
beautiful and striking.

25
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,760
In front of your majestic appearance,

26
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,070
I'm not worth mentioning.

27
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:11,320
You're such a sweet talker.

28
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,230
I liked you the minute I saw you.

29
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,880
Now we finally have

30
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,670
a satisfactory daughter-in-law.

31
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:20,510
(Xiao Nanyang, Prince Yan)
Mother, Yuexi will be a good daughter-in-law.

32
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:23,670
I almost forgot about her.

33
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:31,230
On Qixi Festival, women
often have poetry contests.

34
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:33,030
It is said to be very lively and interesting.

35
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:36,190
How about I
have a contest with Ruojin

36
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,840
to entertain the Emperor and Empress?

37
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,400
Miss Yuexi is the most
talented woman in the capital city.

38
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,890
I'm afraid someone's incompetent

39
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:44,230
and doesn't dare
to take up the challenge.

40
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,630
We're celebrating the festival.

41
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:47,630
What bother with these things?

42
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,400
I am not interested in poetry contests.

43
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,240
Don't do it.

44
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:54,760
Just writing some poetry.

45
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,030
What do I have to fear?

46
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:56,870
Mother.

47
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:58,480
I'm willing to give it a try.

48
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,630
In this case,

49
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,550
I'm interested now.

50
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:03,390
Then do it.

51
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:04,670
Okay.

52
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:08,480
Let's use snow as the theme.

53
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:12,960
Yuexi and Ruojin each composes
a poem on the spot.

54
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:14,800
The more talented one will win.

55
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,280
I've already got one.

56
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:27,800
The cold moon lights the silent wood,
where snow falls soundlessly.

57
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:33,070
Alone by the dim lamp,
I miss the one who's gone.

58
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:35,550
Not bad.

59
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:39,960
This poem describes the quiet beauty
of a snowy night,

60
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,880
with the longing for an old friend
vividly expressed.

61
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,880
Yuexi is indeed quick-witted.

62
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,550
Hey, it's your turn.

63
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,360
One flake, two flakes, three, and four;

64
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,630
five, six, seven, eight, nine, and more.

65
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,280
It's hilarious.

66
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:11,840
You call this poetry?

67
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,030
Ling Ruojin.

68
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:16,280
Did your mother, that merchant’s daughter,
teach you this poem?

69
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,240
Yehan.

70
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:20,150
Your wife's literary attainment

71
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:24,510
really brought shame to you.

72
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,190
Thousands and countless flakes drift;

73
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:32,320
melting into plum blossoms, out of sight.

74
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,360
Good poem.

75
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:37,840
The first three lines seem ordinary.

76
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:41,400
But the fourth line suddenly
elevates the poem to a new height,

77
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,800
inviting endless reflection.

78
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,510
You're truly my good daughter-in-law.

79
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:46,760
The artistic conception

80
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,360
of Princess Consort Chu's poem
is better.

81
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:55,630
The Ling family has never
hired a teacher before.

82
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,880
But Ruojin can write such a good poem.

83
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,840
I admire

84
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:02,190
your talent.

85
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:03,590
What talent?

86
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,960
I think it's cheating.

87
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,880
Your mother must have bought
this poem in advance.

88
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,550
You two are shameless.

89
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,840
What evidence do you have to prove

90
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,880
that I cheated?

91
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,710
I have no evidence, so what?

92
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,920
Can you prove that you didn't cheat?

93
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:19,550
Compose another poem

94
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:20,550
and let Yuexi set the theme.

95
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:21,960
If you can't compose it,

96
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:24,590
you have to kneel and apologize to Yuexi.

97
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,110
What if I compose it?

98
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:27,440
If you do,

99
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,550
I'll kneel and apologize to you.

100
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:30,670
Deal!

101
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:33,960
You set the theme.

102
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:36,630
Please compose a poem

103
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,920
under the theme "moon".

104
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,230
Princess Consort Chu's poem

105
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:43,440
must be better than the previous one

106
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:46,880
to clear away the suspicion of cheating.

107
00:04:53,440 --> 00:05:00,440
Bright moonlight before my bed;
could it be hoarfrost instead?

108
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:08,800
Lifting my head to a shining moon;
lowering my gaze, I think of home.

109
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,760
Good poem.

110
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,320
Simple and straightforward.

111
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,760
But it has a unique charm.

112
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,280
Revealing a fit of homesickness

113
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,400
under the moon,

114
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,400
and the conception is innovative.

115
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:20,470
Great.

116
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:22,800
Princess Consort Chu's poem

117
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,480
is a masterpiece.

118
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,880
I have composed the poem.

119
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,190
Princess, shouldn't you

120
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,070
fulfill your promise?

121
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:35,440
Ling Ruojin, who do you think you are,

122
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:37,670
to make me kneel to you?

123
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:42,190
Dansha is young and loose-lipped.

124
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,590
If you're so serious about it,

125
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,400
you just lack a sense of perspective.

126
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,280
Princess Dansha was trying
to defend you.

127
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,880
Since you are so generous,

128
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,720
how about you

129
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:53,150
take the punishment for her?

130
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:53,990
I...

131
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,280
Ruojin, don't be angry.

132
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,000
I'm thinking for you.

133
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,190
After all, Princess Dansha
is the Empress's niece.

134
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,110
You are openly bullying her.

135
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,510
Doesn't it mean
you're disrespecting the Empress?

136
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:11,360
Don't try to frame me.

137
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:13,710
A promise is supposed to be kept.

138
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,710
As a member of the royal family,

139
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,710
Princess Dansha should

140
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,190
keep her promise even more.

141
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:19,400
Otherwise,

142
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,440
it'll disgrace the Empress.

143
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:22,350
How dare you.

144
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:25,000
How dare you show disrespect to my aunt!

145
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:26,550
You should atone for the offence.

146
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:30,400
Aunt, Ling Ruojin
must be severely punished.

147
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:31,950
Okay.

148
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,360
As a member of the royal family,
you should set a good example

149
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,590
and keep the promise.

150
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,880
Princess Consort Chu

151
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,760
makes good sense.

152
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:45,400
Your Highness,
she's disrespectful to you.

153
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:46,960
She's been reasonable.

154
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,190
How did she disrespect me?

155
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:50,030
Or in your eyes,

156
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:51,710
I am just a petty

157
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:53,400
and narrow-minded Empress.

158
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I dare not.

159
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,800
Dansha, you are not a child anymore.

160
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,990
You should take responsibility
for your own words and actions.

161
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,920
I was wrong.

162
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:10,280
I apologize to you.

163
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,280
Is it enough?

164
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,240
Hey,

165
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:15,870
get up.

166
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,710
Dansha has been proud since childhood.

167
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,230
Being humiliated like this,

168
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:27,630
what will become of her?

169
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,680
Ling Ruojin.

170
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,760
As a woman,

171
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,480
you're so aggressive.

172
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:35,320
Even if your poetry is excellent,

173
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,880
in terms of conduct,
you're far inferior to Yuexi.

174
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:41,110
I haven't got enough

175
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:42,960
of Princess Consort Chu's poems.

176
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:44,670
I have an idea.

177
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,400
You can compose poetry together
with Miss Lin

178
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:51,440
under the theme "Qixi Festival".
Is it okay?

179
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,880
How can they compose a poem together?

180
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:55,360
What's difficult about this?

181
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:57,360
Princess Consort Chu can write the poem.

182
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,070
Miss Lin can grind ink for her.

183
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,360
Mother, this is not appropriate.

184
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,550
Yuexi is not her maid,

185
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,230
how can she grind ink for her?

186
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:08,670
