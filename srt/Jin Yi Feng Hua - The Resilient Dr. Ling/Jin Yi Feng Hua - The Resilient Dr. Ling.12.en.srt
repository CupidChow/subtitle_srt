00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:09,340
=Episode 12=

3
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:17,650
Princess Consort Chu.

4
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,400
Didn't you say that she was fine?

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,110
What's going on now?

6
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:23,190
A few days ago,

7
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:25,400
the Empress's illness had improved.

8
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,170
But now it's even worse.

9
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:29,400
Could it be that you used

10
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,190
some quick-fix medicine

11
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:33,060
and making things worse?

12
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:37,860
Father.

13
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,460
According to the symptoms,

14
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:40,770
Mother looks like she's been poisoned.

15
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,510
Poisoned?

16
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:43,730
Nonsense.

17
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,170
How could she be poisoned?

18
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:49,150
Your medical skills are not proficient.

19
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:50,630
You harmed Mother.

20
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:54,060
Where did the poison come from?

21
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:56,960
This is indeed suspicious.

22
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,990
Please allow me to take a closer look.

23
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:00,030
I need to know the cause

24
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:01,360
to provide the right treatment.

25
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,990
Don't trust her, Father.

26
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:04,110
Poisoning?

27
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:04,960
I think

28
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:06,810
it's just an excuse you're using
to avoid blame.

29
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:08,920
Your treatment has put

30
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,800
Mother's life in danger now.

31
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,650
We can't afford any more mistakes.

32
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,250
Father.

33
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:16,150
Mother's illness must not be delayed.

34
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:17,510
Since she said so confidently,

35
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:19,070
please give her another chance.

36
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:20,470
She is your wife.

37
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:21,560
If anything happens to Mother,

38
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,800
you can't escape the blame either.

39
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,510
If it is really her fault,

40
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:26,020
I will be the first one to punish her.

41
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,150
But things are still unclear
at the moment.

42
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:31,860
Why are you so eager to convict her?

43
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,960
Are you hiding something?

44
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,080
Me? Hiding something?

45
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,360
- You are talking nonsense.
- Aren't you?

46
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,650
Shut up.

47
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:45,130
Princess Consort Chu.

48
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:48,250
I'll trust you one more time.

49
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,030
If you can't find the cause,

50
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:51,870
I

51
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,810
won't let you go.

52
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,240
I want to check

53
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,980
Mother's food last night.

54
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:07,880
Last night Her Highness only had
some rice cakes and herbal soup.

55
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,480
I brewed the herbal soup myself.

56
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,540
It shouldn't have any problem.

57
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:16,730
Is there any residue left?

58
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:28,610
Is there any problem?

59
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:36,580
Both the medicine residue
and the cakes are not toxic.

60
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,380
Enough.

61
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,380
Stop wasting time.

62
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:42,380
Your indiscriminate treatment

63
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:43,730
has hurt the Empress.

64
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:45,860
Guards.

65
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,580
Capture Princess Consort Chu.

66
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,440
I got it.

67
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,810
This is what poisoned

68
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,380
Mother.

69
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,100
What a joke.

70
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:02,540
Father.

71
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,400
She just said

72
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,960
the rice cakes are not toxic.

73
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,400
She just got anxious

74
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,030
and randomly picked something.

75
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:11,130
There is indeed no poison in this cake.

76
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:13,580
But there are adzuki beans added in it.

77
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:15,980
One of the herbs Mother
took last night

78
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,540
was lovage rhizome.

79
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:21,170
Adzuki beans and lovage rhizome
have opposite medicinal properties.

80
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,170
If taken together,

81
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:26,170
they create a strong poison.

82
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,980
Can you detoxify this poison?

83
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,360
Now that the cause has been found,

84
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,650
I can prescribe the right remedy.

85
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,110
Great!

86
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:59,760
She spit out all the toxic blood.

87
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,540
There shouldn't be any problems.

88
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:09,590
Your Majesty, I have found out.

89
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:11,150
She made the rice cakes.

90
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,030
Your Majesty.

91
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:12,880
I really didn't know

92
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,630
the cakes would conflict
with the medicine.

93
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,070
This is an unintentional mistake.

94
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,550
Even so,

95
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,800
harming the Empress
is a capital offense.

96
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,320
Guards. Bring her down

97
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,420
and beat her to death.

98
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:24,960
Your Majesty, please spare my life.

99
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,110
Your Highness, have mercy!

100
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:27,110
Your Highness, spare my life.

101
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:28,680
- Your Majesty, please spare my life.
- Wait a moment.

102
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:34,670
Adzuki beans are not typically
used in rice cakes.

103
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:36,440
And adzuki bean is a Hu medicine.

104
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,170
It's rarely seen in Great Feng.

105
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:39,650
So this matter

106
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:41,580
is not a coincidence at all.

107
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:45,060
Let me ask you.

108
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:46,980
Why did you do this?

109
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,630
You vile servant.

110
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:50,420
How dare you poison the Empress?

111
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:51,550
Father.

112
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:52,440
I think

113
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,840
she should be dragged down

114
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,980
and beaten to death.

115
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,240
She is just a humble maid.

116
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,770
How could she possibly know
this kind of method?

117
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:02,840
Are you eager to get rid of her

118
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,980
because you feel guilty about it?

119
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,470
You are talking nonsense.

120
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:08,610
I'm not.

121
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,020
Who instructed you to do this?

122
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,440
If you can tell who's behind it,

123
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,550
I can plead with His Majesty
to spare your life.

124
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:21,860
If you don't tell,

125
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:23,920
you know how cruel

126
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,580
the Office of Punishment can be.

127
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,810
It's...

128
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:30,920
It's...

129
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,130
Just admit it.

130
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:35,210
Even if you don't think for yourself,

131
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,610
think about your family.

132
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,770
No one instructed me.

133
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:47,940
It was my own idea.

134
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:51,580
Good.

135
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,510
I want to see
how you can stand the torture

136
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:57,770
in the Office of Punishment.

137
00:05:58,030 --> 00:05:58,920
Drag her down.

138
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,760
- Yes.
- Yes.

139
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:23,796
(Seven-Star Orchid, Adzuki Bean,)

140
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:27,300
(Lovage Rhizome, Black Spiderwort,
Wolfberry Pollen)

141
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:45,170
What are you doing?

142
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,610
You can take a look yourself.

143
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,980
Wolfberry pollen, Seven-Star Orchid.

144
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,070
I remember

145
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:03,060
this is the poison Liu used on you.

146
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:04,390
Yes.

147
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,170
Adzuki bean and lovage rhizome

148
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:10,070
are the poison that Mother was hit by.

149
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:11,020
That's right.

150
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,030
These are all Hu medicines

151
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:14,130
from the Western Regions.

152
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:16,380
It's difficult to get them.

153
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,380
But they appeared consecutively.

154
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:20,810
Don't you think it's a bit suspicious?

155
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:22,580
What's suspicious?

156
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:24,800
Don't we know the truth

157
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,440
of these two things?

158
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,150
The first time, Liu Yiyi died.

159
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:29,860
The second time, Xiaotao died.

160
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:32,250
If you think this is the truth,

161
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:34,580
that's a bit too easy, isn't it?

162
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,860
What do you mean?

163
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,580
Think carefully.

164
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:42,760
When these two
poisoning incidents occurred,

165
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,770
besides you and me,

166
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:44,980
who else was there?

167
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:50,500
Yehan.

168
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,150
Liu died so tragically.

169
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:53,840
You must seek justice for her.

170
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,320
Didn't you say that she was fine?

171
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,710
What's going on here?

172
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:58,630
A few days ago,

173
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:00,670
the Empress's illness had improved.

174
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,540
But now it's even worse.

175
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,810
So you have an answer.

176
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,030
Impossible.

177
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,510
It can't be Yuexi.

178
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:12,460
All of this must be a coincidence.

179
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,980
So what about black spiderwort?

180
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:19,990
It's also a Hu medicine.

181
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:21,390
My face was ruined before

182
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:22,800
and got erythema

183
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,760
all because of this black spiderwort.

184
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,680
Since that's the case,

185
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,570
black spiderwort has nothing
to do with Yuexi.

186
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:28,920
Then your inference

187
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,020
doesn't hold up.

188
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:36,060
This is indeed the only exception.

189
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,820
But I will definitely
get to the bottom of it.

190
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,740
What?

191
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:05,880
You think I'm not suffering enough

192
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,780
so you came to laugh at me?

193
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:11,530
I'm not that bored.

194
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:13,520
I am here today

195
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,980
to ask you something.

196
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,940
What else would you like to know?

197
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:21,760
Black spiderwort is
such a rare Hu herb.

198
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,270
You don't understand pharmacology.

199
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:26,060
How could you know that
it causes disfigurement?

200
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,780
So I guess

201
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:29,880
someone must have told you.

202
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,820
Right?

203
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,570
Yes.

204
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:35,660
I did hear it from someone.

205
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,530
Who is that person?

206
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:40,130
Why should I tell you?

207
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:43,130
I'll know it even if you don't say.

208
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:46,250
I guess it's Lin Yuexi,

209
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:47,980
right?

210
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,780
It is her.

211
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:53,610
I accept the consequences
of my own doing.

212
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,170
This has nothing to do with her.

213
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,570
She just casually mentioned
the black spiderwort.

214
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,640
I noted it down myself.

215
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,210
Are you stupid?

216
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,780
You are being used
and you don't even know it.

217
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:06,570
What do you mean by that?

218
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:08,430
Don't you ever think about it?

219
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:10,840
I was known as the most
beautiful woman in the capital.

220
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,390
If my face is disfigured,

221
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:14,660
who will get this title?

222
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,680
Lin Yuexi...

223
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,660
Yes.

224
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:20,030
The biggest beneficiary

225
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:22,020
is the prime suspect.

226
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,800
The black spiderwort
is such a rare medicine.

227
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,570
Why did she bring this up with you?

228
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,860
Do you think this is a coincidence?

229
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,820
Yes.

230
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:37,130
She was praising you extravagantly

231
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,330
and aroused my jealousy.

232
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,310
Then she mentioned the black spiderwort

233
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:44,410
can destroy a person's looks
without being detected by doctors.

234
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,780
So I took the risk.

235
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:50,620
So she's been

236
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,130
using me all along.

237
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,570
Those who intend to harm others
will be harmed themselves.

238
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,170
I hope you can remember this lesson.

240
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,370
Lin Yuexi.

241
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,170
I originally thought you just
innocent-looking.

242
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,370
But you are actually so evil-minded.

243
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,600
Since you dared to provoke me,

244
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,940
just wait and see.

245
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:43,720
One day,

246
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,410
I will expose your disguise

247
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,570
and let everyone know your evil mind.
