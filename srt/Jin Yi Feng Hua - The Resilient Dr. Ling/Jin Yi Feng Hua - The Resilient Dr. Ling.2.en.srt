00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:09,340
=Episode 2=

3
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:13,480
Help me!

4
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:16,440
Help me!

5
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,420
Your Highness, please save me.

6
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:21,420
Your Highness.

7
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,040
Hi, good morning!

8
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,110
Your Highness.

9
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:27,520
Your Highness.

10
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:28,780
Your Highness.

11
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:29,910
What did she say?

12
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:31,660
Mourning or something?

13
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:41,940
Sit.

14
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:48,830
Your Highness.

15
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,970
She just hit me

16
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,380
indiscriminately.

17
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,700
I was about to be killed by her.

18
00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:01,220
Your Highness, you must speak for me.

19
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:02,200
Ling Ruojin.

20
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:05,190
How dare you hit people in my mansion?

21
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:06,940
She is just a concubine.

22
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:08,220
I can hit her if I want to.

23
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:11,060
I am the Princess Consort Chu appointed
by His Majesty.

24
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,260
Liu Yiyi showed disrespect to me,

25
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:14,940
so I taught her a lesson.

26
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,140
Is there any problem?

27
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:19,780
Don't think you can do anything
you want with the imperial edict.

28
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:23,380
One day I will definitely divorce you.

29
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:24,420
Okay.

30
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:26,180
Your Highness, do your best.

31
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:27,740
I am waiting for that day.

32
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:28,620
You...

33
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:33,780
I'm full.

34
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:36,860
Xiaozhu, let's go.

35
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:38,060
Yes.

36
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,470
Ling Ruojin, this evil woman.

37
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:51,660
I will definitely not let her go.

38
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:55,700
My Lady, what are your plans?

39
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,340
My plans?

40
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,860
I'll give her a taste of her own medicine.

41
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:07,980
Hurry up!

42
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:21,460
Get started!

43
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,580
Loser, use some strength.

44
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,860
Step on it.

45
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:41,150
Step.

46
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:43,420
Step.

47
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:50,300
Ling Ruojin, I will make it impossible

48
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,580
for you to stay in the mansion.

49
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:56,300
Xiaozhu.

50
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,300
What is this?

51
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:00,620
Your Highness, His Highness
asked you to go to the study.

52
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,300
What does he want from me?

53
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,980
Xiao Yehan, what is it?

54
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:19,220
(Treatment of Typhoid Fever)
Xiao Yehan has so many medical books.

55
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,860
If we two were to divorce,

56
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:24,460
it should be considered
as marital property.

57
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:26,220
It shouldn't be too much

58
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,980
to take a few books with me, right?

59
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:46,060
Ling Ruojin, you are so bold!

60
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:49,820
Isn't this Vice General Xu's armor?

61
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,620
To save Your Highness's life,

62
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,660
Vice General Xu died on the battlefield.

63
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,220
Only his armor was left.

64
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,180
Prince Chu treasures it very much,

65
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:58,900
and never allows others to touch it.

66
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:02,260
Ruojin, even if you are
dissatisfied with His Highness,

67
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:04,260
you can't take your anger out
on this armor.

68
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,180
Liu Yiyi.

69
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,020
You...

70
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,900
Do you really think I won't punish you?

71
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:12,140
When I arrived here,

72
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:13,380
it was already like this.

73
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:14,500
I didn't touch it.

74
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:16,620
How dare you still deny it now?

75
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:21,780
I just don't want to
consummate the marriage with you.

76
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:27,540
But you retaliate against me
in such a despicable way.

77
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,740
I really underestimated you.

78
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,660
I just arrived here

79
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,540
before you guys got here.

80
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:42,740
You told him, didn't you?

81
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:44,500
Only a fool would fall for

82
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,060
such a despicable framing tactic.

83
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,060
You...

84
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,460
I didn't, Your Highness.

85
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,700
I've always been loyal to you.

86
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:55,100
How could I do such a heartless thing?

87
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:56,620
But Ruojin

88
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,060
has always been cunning.

89
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:59,580
First, she drugged you,

90
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:01,980
and then humiliated you
at the wedding ceremony.

91
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:04,660
Now she is trying to slander me.

92
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:07,460
Your Highness, please speak for me.

93
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:10,500
You're unrepentant and stubborn.

94
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:12,100
Guards.

95
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:14,140
Lock this woman up in the woodshed.

96
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:16,220
No one is allowed to let her out

97
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:17,900
until she has chopped all the firewood.

98
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:20,300
Xiao Yehan.

99
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:23,840
Xiao Yehan!

100
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,340
I really want to slice his brain,

101
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,300
and see

102
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,540
what's inside it.

103
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:42,940
How does it feel being locked here

104
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:44,340
in the woodshed?

105
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:45,980
I'm afraid you'll be lonely,

106
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,540
so I came here to chat with you.

107
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,620
Jiu, look.

108
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,340
This wicked woman

109
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:55,940
destroyed your father's armor.

110
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:57,820
You bad woman.

111
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:59,360
Dare to damage my father's armor.

112
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:00,500
I will kill you.

113
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,140
Boy,

114
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,580
at your age,

115
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,180
you should know everything
you need to.

116
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:09,860
Open your eyes wide
and take a good look

117
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,100
who is the good guy is

118
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:12,340
and who the bad guy is.

119
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:16,860
Jiu is the orphan of Vice General Xu.

120
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,700
His Highness adopted him,
and treats him as his own son.

121
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,620
He holds a much higher place

122
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:23,100
in His Highness's heart than you do.

123
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,700
He won't listen to you.

124
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:30,740
Jiu, when you see His Highness,

125
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:32,340
you know what to say, right?

126
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,220
I'll tell my adoptive father

127
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:36,420
Princess Consort Chu is
the worst woman in the world

128
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:38,500
and let him divorce her quickly.

129
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:43,860
Using such an innocent child
to compete for favor.

130
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,940
Don't you have a guilty conscience?

131
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:48,900
So what?

132
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:51,780
You are no match for me.

133
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,620
What's wrong, Jiu?

134
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:03,780
It looks like the candied hawthorn
got stuck in Jiu's throat.

135
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:04,620
Stuck?

136
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:06,620
What should we do?

137
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:07,900
Should we let him drink some water?

138
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,250
- No, that won't do.
- Go fetch water.

139
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:10,430
- It will kill him.
- And call a doctor.

140
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:12,100
What are you doing?

141
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:12,950
Step aside.

142
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:14,920
If not treated promptly,
a foreign object stuck in the throat

143
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:15,800
can cause suffocation.

144
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,260
- Let go of me.
- Guards.

145
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:19,260
Control this wicked woman.

146
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:20,440
Let me go.

147
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,100
I said don't let him drink water.

148
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,060
- Let go.
- Drink it quickly.

149
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,180
- Let go.
- Jiu.

150
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,370
Get away.

151
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:31,980
The golden time for rescuing him
is only five to 15 minutes.

152
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,780
- What are you doing?
- When the doctor gets here,

153
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,580
it'll be too late.

154
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:36,420
- Go away.
- Don't touch me.

155
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:44,460
What are you doing?

156
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,620
What on earth are you up to?

157
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,820
This is called the Heimlich maneuver,

158
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,660
which involves
applying pressure to the abdomen

159
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:51,740
to compress the chest

160
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,780
and expel the foreign object
from the trachea.

161
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:55,180
I'm telling you.

162
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,900
If you keep messing around,

163
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,500
and something happens to Jiu,

164
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,900
you will be fully responsible for it.

165
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:09,140
Your Highness, please come with me.

166
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,900
Her Highness will kill Jiu.

167
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:11,740
What?

168
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,420
Ling Ruojin, you are asking for trouble.

169
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,380
Your Highness.

170
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,060
Jiu, he's out of breath.

171
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:28,740
He died.

172
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:30,220
Make way.

173
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:32,060
Jiu, Jiu.

174
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,220
Evil woman.

175
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:37,960
You won't even spare a child.

176
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:39,320
Ruojin, I know

177
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:41,540
Jiu offended you
because of the armor incident.

178
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:44,100
But after all, he is just a child.

179
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,700
- Even if you are angry,
- Let me go.

180
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,960
- you can't harm him like this.
- Let me go.

181
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,360
Today I will make you
pay with your life.

182
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:51,420
Let me go.

183
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,620
I can save him.

184
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:55,040
He still has a chance.

185
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:02,220
Ruojin, what are you doing?

186
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,100
Jiu has already been killed by you.

187
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,100
You even won't let go of his body.

188
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:08,100
How can you do this to His Highness?

189
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:10,100
How will Vice General Xu
ever rest in peace?

190
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:13,900
Huo Chong, drag this woman down

191
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:15,700
and beat her to the death!

192
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:16,580
Yes.

193
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:18,900
Go.

194
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:28,220
Xiao Yehan, I was clearly
trying to save him.

195
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:31,140
You are completely blind.

196
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,710
You still dare to argue at this point.

197
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:35,340
Keep beating her!

198
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,540
Harder!

199
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:41,060
Beat her to death.

200
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:44,860
He's risen from the dead.
