=The Resilient Dr. Ling=

2
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:09,340
=Episode 22=

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,230
It's over.

4
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:12,550
Yehan has gathered lots of evidence

5
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:14,360
about the imperial exam fraud.

6
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:15,320
If this continues,

7
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,630
I'm going to be finished.

8
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:17,760
Why not

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
just go all the way and...

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:20,840
No rush.

11
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:23,670
I'll go check tomorrow.

12
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:27,280
If he shows mercy, that would be best.

13
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:29,920
But what if he doesn't?

14
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:36,710
If he won't,

15
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:45,320
then we'll kill him.

16
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:55,510
- Xiaozhu.
- Ah?

17
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:59,280
I have a gift for you

18
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,150
as a token of my appreciation.

19
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,550
Please accept it.

20
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,150
You've got good taste.

21
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:08,510
Tell me.

22
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:09,840
Why are you giving me this?

23
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:12,030
Actually,

24
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,480
it's nothing much.

25
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,190
Xiaozhu, could you tell me a bit about

26
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:17,630
Princess Consort Chu's preferences?

27
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,400
Take it back.

28
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:22,360
I wouldn't betray my master
for personal gain.

29
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,480
Of course, you're loyal to Her Highness.

30
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,000
(Chunfeng Clinic)

31
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,880
But Prince Chu and Princess Consort Chu

32
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,030
are a perfect match made in heaven.

33
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:32,590
If we can help them reconcile,

34
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:34,960
it would be a good deed for us servants.

35
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:41,590
Then, listen carefully.

36
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:44,280
Young Lady likes...

37
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,070
She...

38
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,200
She likes...

39
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:52,070
Well,

40
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,360
Young Lady

41
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,550
spends all her time either consulting
at the clinic or reading.

42
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,230
She doesn't seem to have
any special preferences.

43
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,550
I'm afraid I can't be of much help

44
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:06,440
in reconciling them.

45
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,760
Don't be discouraged.

46
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,280
Oh, right.

47
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,280
There's a lantern festival
in the south of the city tonight.

48
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,280
If you can bring Her Highness there,

49
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:19,400
I guarantee it will
rekindle the flame between them.

50
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,590
- Ah?
- Wait, no.

51
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,880
Rekindle their love.

52
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:35,510
So beautiful.

53
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,680
Your Highness.

54
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,590
There's a lantern festival
in the south of the city tonight.

55
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:43,280
Shall we go?

56
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,800
- Not interested.
- Her Highness is also going.

57
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:46,030
Really?

58
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,280
Absolutely.

59
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:49,280
The lantern festival happens
once a month

60
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,360
and is very lively.

61
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:54,000
It's a perfect place
for young couples to go on dates.

62
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,880
If you can meet Her Highness there,

63
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,150
I'm sure your relationship
would progress further.

64
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:05,920
But how am I supposed to invite her?

65
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,070
You don't need a reason.

66
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,160
Just a chance encounter.

67
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:09,950
A chance encounter?

68
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,240
Yes.

69
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,160
Young Lady.

70
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:16,920
Look how lively this lantern festival is.

71
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,330
- It's much more fun than reading
- You know

72
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:19,160
- at the clinic.
- You know

73
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,280
I've never been one for crowds.

74
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:22,400
Please, just accompany me this once.

75
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,320
Alright.

76
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:29,280
Are you sure about this?

77
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,760
Is she coming?

78
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,960
I'm sure.

79
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:33,440
I paid a month's salary for this.

80
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,440
It must be accurate.

81
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,230
Later, we should...

82
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,000
- Be careful.
- Your Highness, look. There she comes!

83
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:46,460
Let's go over there.

84
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:47,300
Alright.

85
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,160
Look.

86
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:00,110
She just walked by?

87
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,670
Your Highness, I get it now.

88
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,360
It must be because
there are too many people here

89
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,030
so you're blocked.

90
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:08,550
Let's go somewhere else

91
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:09,390
and try again.

92
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,480
The lantern that child is holding.

93
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,550
If we come across a vendor
selling rabbit lanterns later,

94
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:16,390
I'll...

95
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,760
Why isn't this person watching
where he's going?

96
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,920
Please make way.

97
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:32,150
How can she not see me like this?

98
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:35,070
How can we have
a chance encounter then?

99
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,190
Don't worry, Your Highness.

100
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:38,630
This time, you turn around.

101
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:39,880
I guarantee it will work.

102
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:58,070
Three.

103
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,120
Two.

104
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,320
What a coincidence.

105
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,710
Since we've run into each other,

106
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:15,880
how about taking a stroll with me?

107
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:18,400
Sure, sure.

108
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,230
I didn't expect

109
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,480
that your taste

110
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,230
is quite unique.

111
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:31,960
- You...
- Dear.

112
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,710
Didn't you invite me to stroll together?

113
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:34,840
Shall we go?

114
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:36,920
Dear.

115
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:38,150
Let me explain.

116
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:39,190
It's all a misunderstanding.

117
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:40,510
You were avoiding her.

118
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:41,710
Why drag me into it?

119
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,160
Wait.

120
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,230
Since we've run into each other,

121
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:49,960
how about we stroll together?

122
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:52,680
Whatever.

123
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:58,980
Why follow them on their date?

124
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,880
Try a fortune-telling.
No charge if it's wrong.

125
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:07,100
(Master of Fate)
Sir, would you like a fortune-telling?

126
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,070
- I can predict all the fortunes.
- Ruojin, would you like to try it?

127
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:09,910
I'd like to try it.

128
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:15,150
What a coincidence, Yehan.

129
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,190
Didn't expect to run into you here.

130
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:23,320
Master, could you please tell our fortune?

131
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:25,800
You two are a perfect match,

132
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,030
a truly compatible pair.

133
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:29,280
If you can get married,

134
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,000
it would be the most auspicious union.

135
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:36,070
Yehan.

136
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:37,110
Who would've thought

137
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,880
our fates are so deeply intertwined?

138
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:40,510
Nonsense.

139
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,150
How could you trust
a street fortune-teller's words?

140
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,190
But I've given it a careful thought.

141
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:51,190
You and this lady are connected
by a mistaken thread of fate.

142
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:52,840
Though you had a past connection,

143
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,710
it was a karmic entanglement.

144
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:59,000
You and this lady here
are the real divine pair

145
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:01,070
destined by fate.

146
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:04,070
Me and him?

147
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,630
Destined by fate?

148
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,920
That's as likely as pigs flying!

149
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:09,880
I think your fortune-telling

150
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,190
is not very reliable.

151
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,880
No, Master.

152
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:14,670
It is quite accurate.

153
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:18,320
It seems I was too hasty just now.

154
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,630
Master, you are good.

155
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:21,470
I am impressed.

156
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:23,960
- You change your tune pretty quickly.
- I'm flattered.

157
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,190
What's wrong with you today?

158
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,920
I'm just speaking the truth.

159
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:29,880
He is really accurate..

160
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:30,910
Take care.

161
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:35,070
Got it again.

162
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,630
Yehan, you're amazing.

163
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:37,800
Could you teach me?

164
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,640
I don't have time.

165
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:42,590
Do you want to learn?

166
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:43,720
Which one do you want?

167
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,050
I'll win it for you.

168
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:15,870
Got it.

169
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,840
This is the truelove knot you just won.

170
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:32,520
May I have this knot

171
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,720
you won?

172
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,270
Wishing you both a lifetime of love.

173
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:40,270
It's not anything valuable anyway.

174
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,720
If you like it, you can have it.

175
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:47,230
Thank you, sir.

176
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,520
Ruojin. Wait for me, Ruojin.

177
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,840
Yehan.

178
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:03,190
Yehan.

179
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,310
Did I do something wrong?

180
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,560
Why are you treating me so coldly?

181
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,150
You don't know what you've done?

182
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,880
I don't understand what you mean.

183
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,310
You're still pretending?

184
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:21,390
When you intentionally stabbed yourself

185
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,840
and slandered Ruojin,

186
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,430
you should have expected
this day would come.

187
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,030
Ruojin told you this, right?

188
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:33,150
We have known each other for years.

189
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:34,800
You don't believe me

190
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,030
but an outsider?

191
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:37,470
She is my wife.

192
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:39,070
If anyone is an outsider, it's you.

193
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:45,760
I will only be good to her in my life.

194
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:49,430
My heart will forever belong to her alone.

195
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,760
I trusted you too much before,

196
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,600
letting you deceive me
into misunderstanding Ruojin.

197
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,030
I never expected

198
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,030
you to be so scheming.

199
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,560
Yehan.

200
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,470
I just care about you
and love you too much.

201
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:08,800
That's why I did so.

202
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,520
In the name of love,

203
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,190
you commit lies and evil deeds.

204
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,760
This kind of love

205
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:17,110
only makes me sick.

206
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:20,520
Yehan.

207
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,760
I did lie.

208
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,230
- Let go, let go!
- But my feelings for you

209
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:24,470
are absolutely genuine.

210
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:25,310
Let go!

211
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:32,230
Sorry to interrupt.

212
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:33,230
Please continue.

213
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,430
Go on, go on.

214
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,560
Ruojin!

215
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:39,840
As long as you forgive me,

216
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,350
I will do anything.

217
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,840
Enough!

218
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,600
Miss Lin.

219
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:45,960
I am already married.

220
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,880
Please have some respect.

221
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:48,880
Are you really going to be this heartless?

222
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:54,880
I made the mistake
of misjudging you in the past.

223
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,720
From now on,

224
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,560
it's over

225
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,600
between us.

226
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:08,270
Xiao Yehan.

227
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:11,000
Since you are ruthless,

228
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:14,310
don't expect any compassion from me.
