00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:07,420
=The Resilient Dr. Ling=

2
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:09,340
=Episode 19=

3
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:13,320
Yehan,

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,110
how could you bring her to the banquet?

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,190
She is Princess Consort Chu.

6
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:20,110
What's wrong with her

7
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:21,840
accompanying me to the banquet?

8
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:23,510
But...

9
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:26,510
But she stabbed me just a few days ago.

10
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,400
I almost lost my life.

11
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,630
How can you bring such

12
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:32,960
a vicious woman to the banquet?

13
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:35,070
What if she does something bad again?

14
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:36,070
I am fully aware

15
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:37,400
of her character.

16
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:39,630
There's no need for you to interfere.

17
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,030
Yehan,

18
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:45,840
did I do something wrong?

19
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:48,150
Why are you talking to me like this?

20
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,110
My wife

21
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:54,710
can't be slandered by others.

22
00:00:58,230 --> 00:00:59,230
Unbelievable.

23
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:01,280
What's wrong with him today?

24
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,480
The banquet is about to start.

25
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:05,350
Let's go in.

26
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:23,960
Xiao Yehan.

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,110
So, you're the top talented woman
in the capital?

28
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:38,710
But in terms of looks

29
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,360
and talent,

30
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,760
Ruoruo is much better than you.

31
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,030
Did you buy

32
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,360
this title of yours?

33
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:02,630
Thanks to your kindness.

34
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,230
I'm honored

35
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,550
(Prince Ning)
to host this banquet in the palace.

36
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,400
No need for formalities.

37
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,110
Today is your birthday.

38
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:11,760
We are here as brothers,

39
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,840
not as monarch and subject.

40
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,400
With your wife expecting,

41
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,960
you will soon have a new member.

42
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,590
Congratulations!

43
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:18,480
(Princess Consort Ning)

44
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,630
Thank you, Sister-in-law.

45
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,670
Wish you longevity and good health,

46
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,230
and the joy of a new child soon.

47
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:26,920
May you have longevity and good health.

48
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,440
and the joy of a new child soon.

49
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,110
With a light sip, the mood
is already intoxicated with delight.

50
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,630
Since we have fine wine,

51
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,190
how can we not have poetry?

52
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,630
I've heard that Yuexi's talent
is renowned throughout the capital.

53
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:48,000
Why not compose a poem
to show us your skills?

54
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,840
What do you say?

55
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,840
Brother,

56
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:54,280
you're not well-informed.

57
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,190
When it comes to composing poetry,

58
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,480
Princess Consort Chu

59
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:01,920
is second to none in the capital.

60
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,550
Is that so?

61
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:08,320
Could it be that Princess Consort Chu
is actually the top talented woman?

62
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,400
Ruojin is immensely talented,

63
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,760
I feel ashamed.

64
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:16,590
It's better to let Ruojin compose poetry.

65
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:18,000
At the last family banquet,

66
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:21,190
every poem Ruojin composed
was a masterpiece.

67
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,150
I'm sure today will be no different.

68
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:27,480
Since today is Prince Ning's birthday.

69
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,230
If Princess Consort Chu's poem
isn't as good as last time,

70
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:34,150
it would be seen as a deliberate
slight to Prince Ning.

71
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:34,990
Exactly.

72
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,000
His Majesty values Prince Ning the most.

73
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,280
If you don't show respect to Prince Ning,

74
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,960
you're disrespecting the Emperor.

75
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:44,350
Alright then.

76
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:45,800
Since that's the case,

77
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:47,030
let's make a bet.

78
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:49,670
If I can compose a good poem,

79
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:54,030
each of you will owe me
1,000 taels of silver.

80
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,230
If I can't compose one,

81
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,800
I'll owe you 2,000 taels.

82
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,190
Dare to bet?

83
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,030
A mere 1,000 taels of silver,

84
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,360
why wouldn't I dare?

85
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,590
Go ahead and compose.

86
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:06,710
I'll also wager 1,000 taels.

87
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:08,070
I bet you can't do it.

88
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:09,430
Miss Lin,

89
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:12,150
since you started this,

90
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,440
it would be no fun

91
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,960
if you don't join in.

92
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,590
Since you're so interested,

93
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:23,230
I wouldn't want to dampen your spirits.

94
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,320
Money is easy to come by,
but a good poem is rare.

95
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,510
Princess Consort Chu,
don't act on impulse.

96
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:31,590
Just do your best.

97
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:33,230
Don't worry, Mother.

98
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:34,880
I know my limits.

99
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,960
Ruoruo, don't feel stressed.

100
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,920
It's alright even if you lose.

101
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:41,440
No matter how much you may lose,

102
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,630
I'll cover it.

103
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,510
My family is wealthy.

104
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:47,320
I'll take on

105
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:49,110
Princess Consort Chu's wager.

106
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:50,910
Father,

107
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,630
you excel in appreciating poems.

108
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:55,960
Why don't you judge my work?

109
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:56,870
Alright.

110
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,280
But for this competition,

111
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,510
what should the theme be?

112
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:03,150
The theme of competition...

113
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:04,590
How about this?

114
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,230
We won't set a specific theme

115
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:08,070
and only judge the quality.

116
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:11,070
If my composition isn't as good
as what I did last time,

117
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,230
then I lose.

118
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:14,230
If my composition is just as good,

119
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,400
then I win.

120
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:17,480
Father, what do you think?

121
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:18,920
Very good.

122
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,030
Go ahead and compose.

123
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,070
(I don't believe)

124
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,030
(you can write a masterpiece
every time.)

125
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:33,510
The midday sun slips behind mountains,
the Yellow River turns for the sea.

126
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:41,030
Trying to see for a thousand miles,
I climb one more story.

127
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:43,920
What a good poem!

128
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,920
- Truly a good poem!
- The language is fresh and simple,

129
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,670
without any deliberate embellishment.

130
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,030
Yet it carries profound meaning.

131
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,630
Especially the last two lines,

132
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,510
they could even serve
as words of wisdom.

133
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,240
Brilliant.

134
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:57,960
Princess Consort Chu could compose

135
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,480
such a fine poem casually.

136
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,320
I'm truly impressed.

137
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,120
Father,

138
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:06,760
how does this one compare

139
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,480
to those from last time?

140
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:09,590
Of course,

141
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,230
each has its own merits.

142
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:13,360
They're all exceptional poems.

143
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:15,430
Well then,

144
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,720
pay up.

145
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:20,190
It's just a small amount.

146
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:24,670
I'll cover both Yuexi's
and Dansha's share.

147
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,760
Don't be hasty.

148
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:28,000
It's not over yet.

149
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:33,320
Sunlight streaming on Incense Stone
kindles a violet smoke.

150
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,960
Far off I watch the waterfall
plunge to the long river.

151
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,300
Flying waters descending
straight three thousand feet,

152
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:46,000
till I think the Milky Way has tumbled
from the ninth height of Heaven.

153
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:47,910
Good poem!

154
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:49,390
Good poem!

155
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:50,510
A good poem indeed!

156
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:51,510
Great.

157
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,440
It's not at all inferior
to the previous one.

158
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:55,470
Wait,

159
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,110
I have more.

160
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:03,670
Moon of the Qin Dynasty,
mountain pass of the Han.

161
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:06,440
From the great expidition,
our men have yet returned none.

162
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,070
From the threads
a mother's hands weaves,

163
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:11,590
a gown for parting son is made.

164
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:14,280
A hundred mountains and no bird,

165
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:16,230
a thousand paths without a footprint.

166
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:19,000
On war-torn land streams flow
and mountains stand;

167
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,880
In vernal town grass
and weeds are o'ergrown.

168
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:26,880
Don't you know, the red should
languish and the green must grow.

169
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:30,590
Leaving at dawn the White King
crowned with rainbow cloud,

170
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,150
I have sailed a thousand miles
through Three Georges in a day.

171
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,960
Empty one more cup of farewell wine,
I pray thee.

172
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,150
West of Sunny Pass,
you'll have no more friends like me.

173
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:44,360
Good rain knows its time right.

174
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,510
It will fall when comes spring.

175
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,360
My fur coat worth
a thousand coins of gold.

176
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,480
And my flower-dappled horse
may be sold.

177
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,920
To buy good wine that
we may drown the woe age-old!

178
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,640
Bravo!

179
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,030
- Bravo! Bravo!
- Bravo!

180
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:11,280
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

181
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,760
Officer,

182
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,760
how many poems?

183
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:19,110
Exactly

184
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:20,600
100 poems.

185
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:26,350
I want 100,000 taels of silver
from each of you three,

186
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,030
That's 300,000 taels in total.

187
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,520
That should be enough.

188
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,600
So much money...

189
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,680
Even if I brought all my dowry,
it wouldn't be enough.

190
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,520
If my mother finds out,

191
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,310
she'll definitely beat me to death.

192
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:41,800
Impossible.

193
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,070
How could she have composed
so many poems?

194
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,000
It must be fake.

195
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:48,600
It must be fake.

196
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,640
Good girl,

197
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,560
you've truly opened my eyes.

198
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:54,230
It's hard to find

199
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:56,270
even one of such good poems.

200
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:59,270
But today, you've composed
100 of them in one go.

201
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:00,880
Having someone as talented as you

202
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,960
is truly a blessing for our Great Feng.

203
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,440
Father,

204
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,390
Uncle Ning, I'm flattered.

205
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,800
In fact, the poems I composed today

206
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,430
are all for Aunt Ning.

207
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,760
What do you mean by that?

208
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:19,920
I heard that Aunt Ning is kind-hearted,

209
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,840
and established schools
in various places

210
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,470
to take in orphaned children.

211
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,430
I wish to donate
the 300,000 taels I won today

212
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,270
to those schools

213
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:29,920
as my contribution.

214
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:32,310
Princess Consort Chu
not only has great talent,

215
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:34,190
- Look.
- but also a big heart.

216
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:37,470
She truly is a role model for
the younger generation of the royal family.

217
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:39,030
Very well.

218
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:40,520
Command the historiographers

219
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,760
to record this quickly,

220
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:44,720
without any omissions.

221
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:54,270
(Ling Ruojin,)

222
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,350
(just you wait.)

223
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:01,270
Aunt Ning,

224
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:03,350
your pregnancy is stable.

225
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:05,520
But your pulse is a bit weak.

226
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:09,350
Do you often feel dizzy, fatigued,

227
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:10,980
experience chest tightness
and sweat a lot?

228
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,720
Indeed, I do.

229
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,030
That explains it.

230
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,430
Carrying a child

231
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:20,520
is always a challenging task.

232
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,800
And since you're a bit older,

233
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:24,390
your body is under more strain.

234
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,520
These symptoms are normal.

235
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:30,560
I've been married
to the prince for decades,

236
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,600
and it took me a long time
to conceive this child.

237
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,960
No matter how hard it is,
I'm willing to endure it.

238
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:38,310
Aunt Ning, I'll be right back.

239
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:41,350
I'll go prepare some prescriptions
to help stabilize the pregnancy.

240
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,680
Thank you then.

241
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,640
You're welcome.

242
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,840
Help...

243
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:20,110
Help...

244
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:21,270
Help me!

245
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,720
Help me!
