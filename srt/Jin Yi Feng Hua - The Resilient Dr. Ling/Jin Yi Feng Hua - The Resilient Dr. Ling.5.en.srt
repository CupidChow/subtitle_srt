=Episode 5=

3
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,120
Li.

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:14,640
Li?

5
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:24,160
Annoying.

6
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,800
Only this little every time.

7
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,070
When can we save enough money
to run away?

8
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:50,110
This old woman

9
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:51,960
asked me to take care of the shops

10
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:53,480
but she's very defensive of me.

11
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:55,550
It's not that easy for me

12
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,150
to get the money.

13
00:00:57,550 --> 00:00:59,710
Living under someone's watch is tough.

14
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:00,920
If you ask me,

15
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:04,440
just take over all these shops.

16
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:07,800
Do you have any ideas?

17
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,550
You are so bad.

18
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,800
I can be even worse.

19
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:21,390
Mother.

20
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:23,550
You are the most sensible.

21
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,030
What are you here for?

22
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:29,400
There's no place for you.

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
This is the money I've saved.

24
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,760
Use it to buy a horse for Xiaobao.

25
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:43,800
Fawning on me for no reason.

26
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,710
You must be up to no good.

27
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,070
Ms. Lan, don't get me wrong.

28
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:51,070
I just feel sorry for Xiaobao.

29
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,070
Now we are short of money,

30
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,000
and he has to suffer with us

31
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,840
at such a young age.

32
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:59,480
You feel sorry for Xiaobao?

33
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,320
It's because of your mismanagement.

34
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,280
You can't even manage a few shops.

35
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,070
Ms. Lan, you don't know.

36
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:08,000
I'm managing the shops

37
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,030
but Madam is pulling the strings
behind the scenes.

38
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:14,320
She is conservative and inflexible.

39
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,510
It won't take long

40
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,960
before she loses all the money.

41
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,960
That won't do.

42
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:20,280
At that time, our whole family

43
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,400
will have to suffer.

44
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:27,590
If you could take the shops
from her hands

45
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,440
and let me manage them,

46
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,320
I guarantee that
I can earn this amount every year.

47
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,670
5,000 taels?

48
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,960
50,000 taels.

49
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,000
Offer a seat to Young Lady.

50
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:47,280
Lacing tact.

51
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:48,390
Yes.

52
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:54,360
The twelve shops lost 100,000 taels.

53
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:56,140
You two really have a lot of guts.

54
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:57,620
Aren't you afraid of getting beheaded?

55
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,430
Miss Ruojin, spare me, please.

56
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:02,960
Miss Jinxin forced us to do it.

57
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,230
(12th Year of Great Feng)
Where's this page

58
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,760
from five years ago?

59
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,320
Miss Ruojin, I really don't know.

60
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,760
This account book is usually
kept by Miss Jinxin herself.

61
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:25,510
Do you want a chance to redeem yourself?

62
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,070
Miss Ruojin, please enlighten me.

63
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,070
What exactly are you up to

64
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:34,760
by calling everyone here?

65
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,660
Everyone should know

66
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,070
that these years, my mother's shops

67
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:41,000
have been losing money,

68
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:43,640
resulting in a shortage of money

69
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:45,440
and we can't make ends meet.

70
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,000
You still have the nerve to say this.

71
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,840
Look at what kind of life we are living.

72
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,920
We can't even afford
the horse Xiaobao likes.

73
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,760
Since you're not good at managing,

74
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:56,920
you should hand over
the management of the shops

75
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,630
to someone more capable.

76
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,720
Master.

77
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,440
If these shops were entrusted to me,

78
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,680
I promise

79
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,630
I can earn 30,000 taels a year.

80
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,850
Really?

81
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,840
Of course.

82
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,840
Good.

83
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:11,550
Hand over your shops

84
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:12,400
to Lan.

85
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,760
These are all my mother's dowries.

86
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,150
Why should she hand them over?

87
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,280
Marry a dog, and follow the dog.

88
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:22,030
Since she has married into the Ling family,

89
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,630
she belongs here

90
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,100
and these shops

91
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,340
naturally belong to the Ling family.

92
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:29,400
You're right.

93
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:32,880
If you don't hand over the shops today,

94
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:34,670
I will divorce you.

95
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:36,910
Mother.

96
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,480
Since it's come to this,

97
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,230
just hand over the shops.

98
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,960
Jinxin.

99
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:44,390
You...

100
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,070
What a great play!

101
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:53,230
I really underestimated you.

102
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:56,190
Ling Jinxin, do you know your crime?

103
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,400
What do you mean?

104
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,840
Bring him in.

105
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:11,190
What exactly are you trying to do?

106
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:14,000
I have thoroughly checked
all the accounts in the shops.

107
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:15,960
Actually, these shops

108
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:17,630
profit every year.

109
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:20,510
Why is there no money in the account?

110
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:21,350
Good question.

111
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,920
Because there's a person

112
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:27,110
among us

113
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:30,360
who took 100,000 taels.

114
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,960
100,000 taels?

115
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,070
Shopkeeper, can you tell us about it?

116
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:37,710
It's Miss Jinxin.

117
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:39,920
She takes advantage of Madam's trust
and never checks the accounts.

118
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,150
She secretly takes away the money,

119
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:43,230
and threatens

120
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:44,320
to kill my entire family

121
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,630
if I dare to tell anyone.

122
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,360
You're talking nonsense. I didn't.

123
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,960
It must be you.

124
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,480
You embezzled the money

125
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,150
and want to frame me.

126
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:54,110
Every word I said is true.

127
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:55,230
If I told a lie,

128
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,440
I would be willing to die.

129
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,840
Let's see what you have to say this time.

130
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:05,000
Is this true, Jinxin?

131
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,760
It's you.

132
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,190
It's the two of you

133
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:10,320
who joined forces to slander me.

134
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,070
I knew you wouldn't admit it.

135
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:14,110
Alright. Let's talk about

136
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:17,480
how you disfigured my face
five years ago.

137
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,800
- What?
- Five years ago,

138
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,710
I didn't get disfigured
because of the fever.

139
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:28,550
She poisoned me with black spiderwort.

140
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:29,550
I didn't.

141
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,480
Ruojin, did you make a mistake?

142
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,030
Xiaozhu, bring him in.

143
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:44,280
This is Dr. Liu from the Royal Clinic.

144
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,320
Black spiderwort can only be bought
at the Royal Clinic.

145
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,960
Dr. Liu, you must remember
the person who bought it.

146
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,800
Yes.

147
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,070
I remember

148
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,760
the person has a red mole
on the left wrist.

149
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:03,710
Could it be this?

150
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:05,470
It is.

151
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:06,480
Not me.

152
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:08,230
I have never bought black spiderwort.

153
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,230
After failing to accuse me of embezzlement,

154
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:11,710
now you're trying to frame me for poisoning.

155
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:14,800
Shopkeeper, how much
does a black spiderwort cost?

156
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,400
- 500 taels.
- Thank you.

157
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:17,800
You can go back now.

158
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,920
On May 17th five years ago,

159
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,320
you took 500 taels from the shop.

160
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,960
Could this be

161
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:27,880
a coincidence?

162
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:29,670
Nonsense. I didn't.

163
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,360
What evidence do you have?

164
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,550
It's clearly written on it.

165
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:34,760
How do you want to argue?

166
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:37,110
Impossible. This account book is fake.

167
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:38,230
How do you know it's fake?

168
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:39,670
I have really torn that page...

169
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,150
You admitted it.

170
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:46,990
I...

171
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:48,590
Doesn't everyone hear it?

172
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,480
She admitted it herself.

173
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,000
All the things

174
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,960
were done by her.

175
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:58,960
Ruojin is your younger sister.

176
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,760
How could you poison her?

177
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:04,630
She has been living in such pain
for the past five years.

178
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,710
Don't you feel guilty at all?

179
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,920
Why should I feel guilty?

180
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,510
She only suffered for five years.

181
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,600
What about me?

182
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,960
Since my mother passed away,

183
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:19,350
I've been living in pain
for every single day.

184
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:23,310
Why does she have money, good looks,

185
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:24,920
and a loving mother,

186
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,680
while I have nothing?

187
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:33,920
Yes, I am jealous of her.

188
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:37,030
I'm going to destroy her.

189
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:37,870
Go away.

190
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,270
I have treated you
like my own daughter over the years.

191
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,960
Whatever I give to Ruojin,

192
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,880
I give to you as well.

193
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,150
Why are you still not satisfied?

194
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,350
Stop pretending.

195
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,270
You think I don't know

196
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:54,560
you're only kind to me

197
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,880
for the sake Of
your virtuous reputation?

198
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,230
Have you ever been sincere to me?

199
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,230
Treat me as your own daughter?

200
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:05,310
Bah!

201
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,680
If my mother didn't truly care about you,

202
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,270
why would she trust you
to take care of the shops

203
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:12,720
and let you steal so much money?

204
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,840
You are just ungrateful and treacherous.

205
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,360
Villain!

206
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:21,680
I won't pursue the poisoning matter.

207
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:24,430
Just return the embezzled money to me.

208
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:30,920
The money? It's been hidden away by me.

209
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,120
I'm telling you.

210
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:35,680
Even if I die,

211
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,560
you will not get a penny.

212
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,400
You...

213
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:39,760
Come in.

214
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,520
Let me go, let me go.

215
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,470
Who are you?

216
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:43,600
Why are you arresting me?

217
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,960
Li, Li.

218
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:49,990
- Let go.
- Jinxin.

219
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,000
Did you give all the money

220
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:54,310
you embezzled to your lover?

221
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,520
What? A lover?

222
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:59,270
You shameless thing.

223
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:00,800
I will deal with you later.

224
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:02,720
Scoundrel.

225
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:04,960
Return the money to me.

226
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,440
Money?

227
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,360
What money?

228
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,030
I don't know what you are talking about.

229
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:10,680
You don't admit it, right?

230
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:14,030
Guards, beat him hard

231
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:15,520
until he confesses.

232
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:16,800
If you touch me,

233
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,430
my master won't let you go.

234
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:19,360
- Beat him.
- Let him go.

235
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,030
Who dares to touch him?

236
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,430
Greetings, My Lord.

237
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:35,230
A mere fourth-rank civil official

238
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:37,000
has so much power,

239
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:40,270
daring to abuse my man.

240
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,270
I really didn't know

241
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:45,150
that he's your man.

242
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:46,000
Wrong.

243
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,230
He is just my lapdog.

244
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:52,070
But you can't afford

245
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,760
to mess with my lapdog.

246
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:56,560
Yes, My Lord.

247
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:58,680
Useless.

248
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,600
You can't even handle this lowlife.

249
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,680
Get up quickly.

250
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:09,110
My Lord, he stole
100,000 taels from my family!

251
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:13,090
This woman voluntarily gave it to me.

252
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,430
She gave me money

253
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:15,470
and I slept with her.

254
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:16,470
It's fair.

255
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:18,840
- What did you say?
- Did you hear that?

256
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:22,800
You daughter spent the money
to sleep with him.

257
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:25,000
How can you want it back?

258
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:28,720
Stop.

259
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:35,150
The noble lord ordered his actor
to seduce an innocent young girl

260
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,270
and scam a large sum of money.

261
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,920
This has already violated the law,
hasn't it?

262
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,430
So this is

263
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:49,560
Princess Consort Chu
who married a rooster.

264
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,560
My father is the Marquis of Loyalty.

265
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,560
What can you, a titular princess consort,

266
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,600
do to me?

267
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,720
How imposing you are.

268
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,430
Greetings, Prince Chu.
