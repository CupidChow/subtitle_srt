00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:07,420
=The Resilient Dr. Ling=

2
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:09,340
=Episode 8=

3
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:22,430
I got it.

4
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:23,430
- You...
- Don't move.

5
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:30,060
Clouds float like works of art.

6
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:34,070
Stars shoot with grief at heart.

7
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:44,510
Across the Milky Way
the Cowherd meets the Maid.

8
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:45,840
When autumn's...

9
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:47,430
Don't move.

10
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,760
Don't disturb Princess Consort Chu.

11
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,760
What's next?

12
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,280
I remembered.

13
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,670
When autumn's golden wind
embraces dew of jades,

14
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:27,320
all the love scenes on Earth,
however many, fade.

15
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,980
Bravo. "When autumn's golden wind
embraces dew of jades,

16
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:31,630
all the love scenes on Earth,
however many, fade."

17
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,360
We are like this.

18
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:40,590
If love between both sides can last for aye,
why need they stay together night and day?

19
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:42,880
"If love between both sides can last for aye,

20
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,550
why need they stay together night and day?"

21
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,880
Each word is precious.

22
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,290
It can be called a masterpiece.

23
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:54,060
This woman's talent

24
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,460
is beyond my imagination.

25
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,980
Maybe I misunderstood her.

26
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:02,020
Princess Consort Chu's poem

27
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,820
is unique and ambitious in concept.

28
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:09,300
Apparently, it's about the stars.
But actually it refers to the lovers.

29
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:13,180
Reading this touches the heart
and stirs the soul.

30
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:14,940
It is truly a masterpiece.

31
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:18,460
Guards.

32
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,220
Reward Princess Consort Chu
with ten boxes of jewels,

33
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:24,100
100 pieces of satin
and 1,000 taels of gold.

34
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:26,300
Thank you, Father.

35
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,780
After the banquet,

36
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,460
come with me.

37
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,940
We have so many kids here.

38
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,460
(Mother wants to see me alone.)

39
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:46,940
(Could it be because
I drugged Xiao Yehan)

40
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:48,180
(and she wants to settle scores with me?)

41
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:50,380
(Anyway,)

42
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,820
(I just want to get a divorce anyway.)

43
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,860
(I might as well go with the flow.)

44
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:58,860
Princess Consort Chu,
do you know your sin?

45
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:01,500
I do.

46
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:04,020
If you want me to divorce Prince Chu,

47
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,100
I have no complaints.

48
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,340
Why didn't you tell me earlier

49
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:07,980
that you have such a talent for poetry?

50
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,620
It's a huge sin to only reveal

51
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:12,500
your masterpieces now.

52
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:15,820
I heard that you drugged Yehan.

53
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,140
Yes, yes, yes.

54
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:19,860
I know I'm sinful

55
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:20,940
and unforgivable.

56
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,820
If you want me to divorce Prince Chu,

57
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:24,980
I swear...

58
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:26,740
Indeed unforgivable.

59
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:31,180
I'll punish you to write two more poems

60
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,540
and give them to me.

61
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:34,900
You made a mistake,

62
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,260
but with no evil intentions.

63
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,420
You're just deeply in love with Yehan.

64
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:39,460
Don't mention

65
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:40,500
the divorce again.

66
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:47,740
Mother, why don't you
think about this again?

67
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:50,620
His Highness has no feelings for me.

68
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,380
He only loves

69
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:55,140
Miss Lin.

70
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:57,300
You underestimate me too much.

71
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,700
I have climbed
all the way to this position

72
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,540
and have seen countless people.

73
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:07,020
I can judge one's character
at first glance.

74
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,060
Although Lin Yuexi appears gentle,

75
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:12,300
she's full of schemes.

76
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:15,100
She's engaged to Nanyang

77
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:16,940
but still leads Yehan on.

78
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,900
How could I let her succeed?

79
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:22,380
- But, Mother...
- There is no "buts".

80
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,220
You are the daughter-in-law
recognized by me.

81
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,740
If I don't help you, who will I help?

82
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:30,780
If Lin Yuexi were
to cause trouble again,

83
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:33,180
I'll be your backing.

84
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,780
Ling Ruojin.

85
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:44,500
Even if you restored your appearance

86
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,220
and can write a few poems,

87
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:47,780
so what?

88
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,160
(Ling Ruojin)
The man you like

89
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,960
only has eyes for me.

90
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,420
How will you compete with me?

91
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:56,220
(Ling Ruojin)

92
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:04,620
(Xiao Yehan)
Yehan.

93
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,700
You like me the most, don't you?

94
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,980
But it's not enough to just like me.

95
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,940
I will be the Empress.

96
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,380
Your birth mother
comes from a humble background

97
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:33,220
and you're not valued by His Majesty.

98
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,820
Although Xiao Nanyang is a fool,

99
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,420
he has a chance to ascend to the throne.

100
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:41,780
Then I'll have to marry him.

101
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:50,500
But even if I don't marry you,

102
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:53,340
I won't allow you
to fall in love with another woman.

103
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:58,700
You can only love me

104
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:01,180
in your whole life.

105
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:25,540
You must be very proud

106
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,460
for beating me in the contest.

107
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,180
Not necessarily.

108
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,540
After all, it's not difficult to beat you.

109
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:33,380
No matter how sharp-tongued you are,

110
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,940
you're just pitiful in my eyes.

111
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:40,220
Your husband only loves me.

112
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:41,700
Just based on this,

113
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:45,660
you will always be my defeated foe.

114
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,180
It's really sad.

115
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,100
What do you mean?

116
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:54,980
A woman

117
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:57,820
relying entirely on a man.

118
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:00,780
Just to win a little bit of love
and pity from men,

119
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,740
you scheme against another woman

120
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:03,940
and get jealous of people.

121
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:05,820
Isn't this sad enough?

122
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,540
You sound grandiloquent.

123
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:17,660
I'd like to see

124
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:21,180
what will you do

125
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,780
if you're thoroughly loathed
by your husband.

126
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:31,900
Ruojin, no.

127
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,500
Ling Ruojin!

128
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:47,780
I was just congratulating her.

129
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:52,460
But she's so concerned
about what happened before

130
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:53,980
and pushed me down the stairs.

131
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:57,340
Yehan, I'm really afraid.

132
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,540
You evil woman.

133
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,900
Do you want to kill Yuexi

134
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,160
by pushing her down
from such a height?

135
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,060
You are really amazing,

136
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,220
acting so professionally.

137
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:10,500
I almost believed it myself.

138
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,620
I saw it with my own eyes.

139
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:12,460
How could it be fake?

140
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:14,080
Yehan.

141
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,260
Ruojin just loves you too much

142
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:20,780
so she's jealous of me

143
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,180
and harmed me like this.

144
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:27,620
Because of your performance
at the palace banquet,

145
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,380
I'd changed my opinion of you.

146
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,300
I didn't expect you to be
just as cunning

147
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:33,380
and vicious as before.

148
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:36,260
What a waste of your poetic talent.

149
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:37,980
You think I want to?

150
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:40,900
I'll warn you one last time.

151
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,260
Lin Yuexi is the cunning person.

152
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:44,300
Believe it or not.

153
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:50,900
Are you okay?

154
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:53,500
I'm fine.

155
00:08:58,420 --> 00:08:59,420
Yehan.

156
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,140
Yuexi.

157
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,220
This is the ginseng soup I made for you.

158
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:08,740
Try to see if it suits your taste.

159
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:10,820
Sorry to trouble you, Yuexi.

160
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:13,540
Just let the servants
handle this kind of thing.

161
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:17,180
Why do you treat me like a stranger?

162
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:20,900
Or is it because you have Ruojin now,

163
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,500
and no longer like me?

164
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,540
I didn't mean that.

165
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:25,820
It's okay.

166
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,180
If you don't like me,

167
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:29,380
just say so.

168
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:33,060
I promise I'll never appear
in front of you again

169
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:34,340
lest I bother you.

170
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,580
My love for you has never changed.

171
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:39,180
Really?

172
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:44,020
But now Ruojin is
beautiful and talented.

173
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:46,580
You'll fall in love with her
sooner or later...

174
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:47,500
Absolutely impossible.

175
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:51,900
The woman may have
some talent in poetry,

176
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:53,780
but she's evil in heart.

177
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,940
I only feel disgust for her.

178
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:57,460
You once saved my life.

179
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:59,020
If she hadn't interfered back then,

180
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,700
you would be my wife.

181
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:03,740
Yehan.

182
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:05,140
I am content

183
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:06,900
to hear these words.

184
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:11,420
Your Highness,
I made chicken soup for you.

185
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:13,820
