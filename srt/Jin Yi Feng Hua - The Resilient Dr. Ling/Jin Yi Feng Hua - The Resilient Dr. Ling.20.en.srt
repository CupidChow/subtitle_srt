=Episode 20=

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:12,600
Aunt Consort Ning.

4
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:15,760
Aunt Consort Ning.

5
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:26,710
Uterine rupture.

6
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,000
She needs immediate surgery.

7
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:31,400
- Aunt Consort Ning.
- Ling Ruojin,

8
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,710
how dare you harm Princess Consort Ning?

9
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:34,950
Guards.

10
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:36,030
Help!

11
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:37,550
Help!

12
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:42,190
Yunlang! Yunlang!

13
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:44,320
What exactly happened?

14
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,240
It was her!

15
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,030
- She pushed Aunt Consort Ning down the stairs.
- Yunlang!

16
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,230
Aunt Consort Ning is pregnant.

17
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,440
I'm afraid her life

18
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,190
and that of her baby are in danger.

19
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:56,400
Lin Yuexi!

20
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,120
Uncle.

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:00:59,840
You...

22
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:01,440
- You...
- Uncle!

23
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,280
It's too early to draw conclusions.

24
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,710
Now is not the time to assign blame.

25
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:05,970
The priority is to save her life.

26
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:08,350
Physicians!

27
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:09,840
Summon the physicians!

28
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:10,720
Quickly!

29
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:11,800
Summon the physicians!

30
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:18,000
I didn't push Aunt Consort Ning.

31
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:25,510
I believe you.

32
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,920
Aunt Consort Ning's in danger.

33
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:31,760
I must perform surgery
on her immediately.

34
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,760
This is a big deal.

35
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:35,920
If you trust me,

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,710
guard the door for me

37
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:39,480
and don't let anyone in.

38
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:44,550
Rest assured,

39
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:45,960
I will guard the door for you.

40
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:47,550
Okay.

41
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,240
Keep up!

42
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,280
Quickly!

43
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:07,800
Yunlang, Yunlang!

44
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:09,510
- Uncle, Uncle.
- The physicians are here, hold on!

45
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:12,190
Ruojin is currently treating Aunt inside.

46
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:13,400
You can't go in.

47
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,190
You wretch!

48
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,070
She harmed Yunlang.

49
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:18,670
How can you let her treat Yunlang?

50
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:19,960
What are you thinking?

51
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:21,400
Calm down, Brother.

52
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,280
Princess Consort Chu
is not that kind of person.

53
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,970
There must be some misunderstanding.

54
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:26,390
- Right.
- She...

55
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,000
She saw it with her own eyes.

56
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:29,280
Could it possibly be false?

57
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,630
Did you truly see it yourself?

58
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,740
His Majesty is here.

59
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,360
Lying to the Emperor
could cost you your life.

60
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,630
I wouldn't dare lie.

61
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:36,990
I indeed saw

62
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,880
Ling Ruojin push
Princess Consort Ning down the stairs.

63
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,240
Did you hear that?

64
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:42,510
Move aside now!

65
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,540
(Princess Consort Ning is as good as dead.)

66
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:47,150
(Ling Ruojin,)

67
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,280
(prepare to die with her.)

68
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:53,710
I cannot entrust Yunlang to a murderer.

69
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:55,870
Uncle, I swear on my life

70
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,670
that Ruojin is definitely not the murderer.

71
00:02:58,170 --> 00:02:59,710
Uncle, you must not believe him.

72
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:01,190
They are a couple.

73
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,780
Maybe he was the one
who instructed Ling Ruojin

74
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:04,580
to harm Aunt Ning.

75
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:07,780
Ling Ruojin!

76
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,180
- Get out of here right now!
- Uncle!

77
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,040
- Yunlang!
- Uncle!

78
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,180
I'm here to save you!

79
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,460
If you go in,

80
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,580
Aunt Ning's life will be in danger.

81
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:14,660
Nonsense!

82
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:16,500
In my opinion, you just want to

83
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,720
get Aunt Ning and her child killed.

84
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,180
The baby

85
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,220
is the only child of Uncle Ning.

86
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,180
Will the Ning bloodline

87
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:27,040
end because of her?

88
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,240
I'll fight you to the death!

89
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,540
Uncle, even if you kill me,

90
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,000
I won't let you go in.

91
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:44,580
Yunlang and the child are my life.

92
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,570
You're not only endangering their lives,

93
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:49,450
but also preventing me from seeing them.

94
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,360
Brother,

95
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,990
you must help me.

96
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:57,820
Father,

97
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,860
Yehan is so determined to stop us.

98
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,740
There must be something suspicious going on.

99
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:05,920
Yehan.

100
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,120
I order you to step aside.

101
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:10,320
Father, please forgive me.

102
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:12,120
I promised Ruojin

103
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:14,680
that I wouldn't let anyone in.

104
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:19,260
Do you know the consequences
of defying me?

105
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,440
I am willing to bear

106
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,780
any punishment.

107
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:24,720
Very well.

108
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:26,740
Guards!

109
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:27,580
- Yes.
- Yes.

110
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,700
Drag Prince Chu away.

111
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:30,540
Yes.

112
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,440
Yunlang! Yunlang!

113
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,900
Congratulations, Uncle Ning,

114
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,000
on having a son.

115
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,080
That's wonderful!

116
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,240
I finally have an heir.

117
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:05,450
Excellent.

118
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,500
Princess Consort Chu,

119
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:09,060
it is thanks to you that

120
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,520
Prince Ning's child was born safely.

121
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,500
Now

122
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,160
we should clear
Princess Consort Chu's name.

123
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,160
Thank you, Princess Consort Chu.

124
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,660
I wronged you.

125
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:20,620
Uncle Ning,

126
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:21,880
don't speak of it.

127
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:27,800
Ling Ruojin,

128
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,700
you actually cut open
Princess Consort Ning's abdomen

129
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:33,680
to take out the baby. You're so ruthless!

130
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:36,520
Yunlang, Yunlang!

131
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,880
Yunlang, Yunlang!

132
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:42,400
You...

133
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,620
How could you do this to Yunlang?

134
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:46,060
Aunt Ning suddenly fell,

135
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:48,140
which caused a uterine rupture
and heavy bleeding.

136
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:49,220
A C-section was the only option.

137
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,280
In my opinion,

138
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,340
Ling Ruojin feared her crime
would be exposed,

139
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:54,600
so she used this cruel method

140
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,420
to cut open her belly and kill
the mother and the child

141
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:57,860
in order to silence them.

142
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,600
Don't be deceived by her.

143
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,240
How ignorant.

144
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:04,980
A C-section is simply
a method of childbirth;

145
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,440
it does not kill people.

146
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,380
You're still denying it.

147
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:09,940
Her abdomen has been cut open like this,

148
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:11,220
how could she possibly survive?

149
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,040
Father,

150
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:15,580
Aunt Ning died a tragic death
at Ling Ruojin's hands.

151
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:18,720
Please punish her for attempted murder.

152
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:23,620
Yunlang.

153
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:25,940
- Princess Consort Ning is not dead.
- Yunlang!

154
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,040
How is that possible?

155
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,520
You don't want Aunt Ning to survive.

156
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,120
What are you saying, Yehan?

157
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:40,800
Of course, I hope
she can be safe and sound.

158
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,540
Aunt Ning is out of danger.

159
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:58,840
After some rest, she will fully recover.

160
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:00,980
That's wonderful, Yunlang!

161
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,820
When a woman gives birth
and faces hemorrhaging,

162
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:03,800
it's usually fatal.

163
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,020
- Thankfully, Princess Consort Chu is here.
- It's okay. That's wonderful.

164
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:08,400
Both the mother and baby survived this.

165
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:10,260
Princess Consort Chu's medical skills

166
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:12,140
are truly extraordinary

167
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,760
and unparalleled.

168
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,240
Uncle.

169
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:19,160
You saved my wife and child.

170
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:20,460
From now on,

171
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:22,280
you are my greatest benefactor.

172
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,600
Uncle, please rise.

173
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:28,060
Saving lives is a doctor's duty.

174
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:29,360
There's no need to thank me.

175
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:31,500
Aunt,

176
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:33,840
how did you fall?

177
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:39,420
It was my own fault.

178
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:40,620
I felt dizzy and unsteady,

179
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,800
which caused this incident.

180
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:46,620
Didn't you say
you saw Princess Consort Chu

181
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,340
push Princess Consort Ning
down the stairs?

182
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:50,780
Maybe...

183
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:52,260
Maybe I didn't see it clearly

184
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:53,340
and misjudged the situation.

185
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:54,540
So I misunderstood Ruojin.

186
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:57,340
You made a baseless accusation
without solid evidence.

187
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:59,760
How can you get away using this excuse?

188
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,140
If it weren't for
Princess Consort Chu's exceptional skills,

189
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:05,160
her grievances would never have been cleared.

190
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:08,000
Lin Yuexi, you made baseless accusations

191
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,380
and caused trouble by spreading rumors.

192
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:11,140
I sentence you
to three months of confinement,

193
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,980
and your father will be demoted
by three ranks.

194
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,380
If this happens again,

195
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:15,600
I will show no leniency.

196
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:17,640
Yes.

197
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,300
Today, you defied His Majesty's order

198
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,620
to guard the door.

199
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:33,360
I must say. I'm impressed by you.

200
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,140
It was nothing.

201
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,320
Don't mention it.

202
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:39,420
Besides, I was merely ensuring

203
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:41,400
the safe delivery of Aunt Ning's child.

204
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,220
No matter what,

205
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,640
you helped me.

206
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,120
How about

207
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:47,920
I treat you to a meal?

208
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,940
I've been quite busy lately,

209
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:57,340
so I need to arrange my schedule first.

210
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,280
Or maybe you...

211
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,760
It's quite troublesome.

212
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,200
Maybe next time.
