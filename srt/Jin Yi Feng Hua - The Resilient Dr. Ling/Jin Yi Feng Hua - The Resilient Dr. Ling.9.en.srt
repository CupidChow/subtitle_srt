00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:07,420
=The Resilient Dr. Ling=

2
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:09,340
=Episode 9=

3
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:10,510
Your Highness,

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,330
I made chicken soup for you.

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,500
What are you doing?

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,510
You vixen.

7
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:19,840
You are getting married soon.

8
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,480
Why do you keep pestering His Highness?

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,470
How dare you!

10
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:23,440
Your Highness.

11
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,320
I am doing this for your own good.

12
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,150
She is the future Princess Consort Yan.

13
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:28,190
If this gets out,

14
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:29,400
your reputation will...

15
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,290
That's enough.

16
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:32,840
It's not your place
to meddle in my business.

17
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:33,680
Get out.

18
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,170
Yuexi. Yuexi.

19
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,880
Liu is always narrow-minded

20
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,800
and mean.

21
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,980
Don't take it to heart.

22
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:54,240
It's all because I lacked of restraint,

23
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,880
and caused Liu to misunderstand.

24
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,540
She must be very sad now.

25
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,170
I'll go and comfort her.

26
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,630
I haven't dealt with Ling Ruojin yet,

27
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:12,030
and now Lin Yuexi shows up.

28
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,060
Despicable! You are all despicable!

29
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:18,670
What are you here for?

30
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:19,880
Are you here to laugh at me?

31
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:20,810
Liu.

32
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,960
You are in a very
dangerous situation now.

33
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,380
I'm here to help you.

34
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:27,580
What do you mean?

35
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:29,460
After the palace banquet,

36
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,380
Ling Ruojin's talent has been known
throughout the capital.

37
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,580
I'm sure you've heard about it.

38
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,650
It won't be long

39
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:38,810
before Prince Chu
falls in love with her.

40
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:40,720
By then,

41
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,130
there will be no place for you
in the mansion.

42
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:49,500
But I can help you get rid of her.

43
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,250
Why are you helping me?

44
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:57,510
I was supposed to be
Princess Consort Chu.

45
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:00,020
But Ling Ruojin took it
with underhanded tactics.

46
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,810
How can I accept this?

47
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,540
The enemy of my enemy is my friend,

48
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,770
isn't it?

49
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:09,720
So, how do you plan to help me?

50
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,540
That woman is not easy to deal with.

51
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,480
You only need

52
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:16,230
to add this to her food.

53
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:17,100
Poison her?

54
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,920
Not possible.

55
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,550
Do you think the Ministry of Justice
just sits around?

56
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:24,280
If she ends up dead,

57
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,540
I'll be in trouble too.

58
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:28,060
Don't worry.

59
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:30,070
This is wolfberry pollen,

60
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:31,170
not toxic.

61
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,730
However,

62
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,210
if there are seven-star orchids
in the room,

63
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,760
and she takes the wolfberry pollen,

64
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,460
she'll die for sure.

65
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:45,920
All you need to do is to
steal the seven-star orchids

66
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,940
after she dies.

67
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,280
Then the Ministry of Justice

68
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,540
won't find any evidence.

69
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:55,020
Well...

70
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:57,800
After she dies,

71
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,250
you'll be the only mistress here.

72
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,920
By then,

73
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,400
I'll put in a good word for you
in front of Yehan

74
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,280
and let him make you
the princess consort.

75
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,730
You can make the choice

76
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:11,540
between glory and being abandoned.

77
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,100
(Treatment of Typhoid Fever)
Ruojin.

78
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,680
Ruojin.

79
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,150
I visited the flower market today

80
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:32,590
and found this orchid
was growing very vigorously.

81
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:35,060
So I bought it for you specially.

82
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:40,610
Looks pretty good.

83
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,900
Yiyi.

84
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,150
Have you ever heard of a saying,

85
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,110
"When the fox preaches,

86
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:48,320
take care of your geese?"

87
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,270
I have.

88
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:55,710
It was

89
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:57,150
all my fault before.

90
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:59,280
Since you're married Prince Chu,

91
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,070
you're my master.

92
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:04,150
I will serve you well in the future.

93
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:08,460
Please give me a chance
to make amends.

94
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:14,720
Okay, I'll take this.

95
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,290
Thank you, Yiyi.

96
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:19,650
Then I will take my leave.

97
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:28,380
This orchid is so unique!

98
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,810
This is called Seven-Star Orchid.

99
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:32,880
It's quite rare

100
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,330
and expensive.

101
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,400
She must be up to no good.

102
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,510
Why don't I throw it away for you?

103
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:40,350
No need.

104
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,170
Just keep it for now.

105
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:44,130
I'd like to see

106
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:46,940
what tricks can she play.

107
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,940
Your dinner is ready, Your Highness.

108
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,650
Ms. Wu, the porridge is really good.

109
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:22,900
Would you like to try it?

110
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,190
This porridge is for you.

111
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:27,630
I won't try it.

112
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:29,760
Oh, don't be so polite.

113
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,460
Just have a taste, as I said.

114
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,590
No, no need.

115
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:35,860
How dare you

116
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,420
to poison my porridge.

117
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:39,840
Guards.

118
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,880
Take her out.

119
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,720
Yes.

120
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:43,720
Please spare me, Your Highness.

121
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,000
I was wronged.

122
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Spare me, Your Highness.

123
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,400
- They are really lawless now.
- I was wronged.

124
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,980
She even dared to poison you.

125
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:53,770
She put wolfberry pollen
in my porridge.

126
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:54,980
It's not toxic.

127
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:59,250
It is indeed non-toxic
when taken alone.

128
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,400
But combined with the pollen
of Seven-Star Orchid,

129
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,130
it becomes highly poisonous

130
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,290
and can be fatal.

131
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,100
Is it Secondary Consort Liu?

132
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:12,940
Yes, and no.

133
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:18,150
This wolfberry pollen is
a very rare medicinal herb.

134
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:20,110
Most people haven't even seen it.

135
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:23,320
And few know that

136
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,150
it's toxic when combined with
Seven-Star Orchid.

137
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:26,920
Liu Yiyi doesn't understand pharmacology.

138
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,330
How did she know?

139
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,100
So I guess

140
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,330
someone must have told her.

141
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:34,060
What are you planning to do?

142
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,580
Spread the message.

143
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,320
Just say that Ms. Wu poisoned my porridge

144
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,880
and was caught by me on the spot.

145
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,360
She's now being tortured
for interrogation.

146
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,290
Yes.

147
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,150
Bad news.

148
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:56,670
I heard that Ms. Wu was caught
drugging Ling Ruojin

149
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:58,020
and is being tortured severely now.

150
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,130
I'm afraid she'll rat me out soon.

151
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:02,770
You're so useless.

152
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,280
If Ling Ruojin finds out
that I drugged her,

153
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,280
then I'm done for.

154
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,320
Don't panic.

155
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,380
Remember

156
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,610
that wolfberry pollen is not toxic.

157
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:15,070
So, what do you mean?

158
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:18,070
Find a chance to steal back
the Seven-Star Orchid.

159
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:20,770
Even if they investigate you,

160
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:23,070
with a bowl of harmless porridge.

161
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:24,810
they can't do anything to you.

162
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:14,920
You're really prescient, Your Highness.

163
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,070
Secondary Consort Liu did
steal the Seven-Star Orchid.

164
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:19,060
So what should we do next?

165
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:20,620
Nothing.

166
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:24,570
Just wait for the mastermind
to reveal themselves.

167
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:32,600
I got the Seven-Star Orchid.

168
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,980
We are finally safe.

169
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:40,960
You have been fooled.

170
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,450
This is not Seven-Star orchid at all.

171
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:46,030
Ling Ruojin, this despicable woman.

172
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:47,450
She actually dared to fool me.

173
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:52,620
It seems that our plan
has been exposed by Ling Ruojin.

174
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,640
But the Seven-Star Orchid
is still in her hands.

175
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,000
Once Ms. Wu confesses,

176
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,290
I'll be in big trouble.

177
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:01,530
Help me think of a solution.

178
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:04,620
Now that it has come to this,

179
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,410
what can I do?

180
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:08,520
Are you going to leave me alone?

181
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,560
I'm telling you.

182
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,720
If I get screwed,

183
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,920
you won't have a good life, either.

184
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,430
I will go find His Highness

185
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:15,720
and tell him that you told me to do it.

186
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,760
By then,

187
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,330
we will die together.

188
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,620
Wait.

189
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:27,170
Yiyi, don't rush.

190
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,680
I just had a great idea

191
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,060
that can help you get away with it.

192
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,900
What is it?

193
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,820
The idea is

194
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,570
for you to die.

195
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,390
- What?
- Early this morning,

196
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:24,600
Secondary Consort Liu was found
drowned in the lotus pond.

197
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,720
The whole mansion was shocked.

198
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,860
Even the coroner came.

199
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:31,410
Your Highness, His Highness requests
your immediate presence.
