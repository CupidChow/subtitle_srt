00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:07,420
=The Resilient Dr. Ling=

2
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:09,340
=Episode 3=

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:10,680
Beat her!

4
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:11,880
Beat her to death.

5
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:14,840
Harder.

6
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:19,670
He's risen from the dead.

7
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,280
Jiu.

8
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:24,360
You woke up.

9
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:27,280
Adoptive Father, I was so scared.

10
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:29,670
I thought I'd never see you again.

11
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:31,960
What happened?

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,960
Tell me.

13
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:36,590
Ms. Liu just gave me
a candied hawthorn

14
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,230
and I chocked.

15
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:40,800
Then Ms. Liu asked someone

16
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,280
to fill my mouth with a lot of water.

17
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:45,590
I felt more and more uncomfortable

18
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:46,960
and couldn't move at all.

19
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:47,800
Liu.

20
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:55,360
I just wanted to use the water

21
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,970
to get the hawthorn out.

22
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:58,960
I didn't intend to harm him.

23
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:00,630
Useless woman.

24
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:03,760
Jiu, and then?

25
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,760
Then someone pressed on my stomach
for a long time,

26
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,840
and the hawthorn came out.

27
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,480
And then I passed out.

28
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,480
It's okay, you are fine now.

29
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:17,590
Take Jiu away.

30
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:19,070
Ask the doctor to give him
a thorough check-up.

31
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:19,910
Yes.

32
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:24,960
Liu's haphazard rescue

33
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,480
almost endangered Jiu's life.

34
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:27,880
Ground her for half a month

35
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,230
and fine her a year's salary.

36
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,120
Yes.

37
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:33,630
Do we still need to beat her?

38
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,480
Send her back to her room.

39
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,840
Yes.

40
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:52,400
I hate this feudal society.

41
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:54,030
They hit people whenever they want.

42
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,800
It's simply inhumane.

43
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,840
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

44
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,880
His Highness is so cruel.

45
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:02,070
Xiao Yehan,

46
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:03,070
he will...

47
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,080
I'll be gentle.

48
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,070
Be gentle.

49
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:08,910
Xiao Yehan.

50
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:11,340
Do you have any manners at all?

51
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:13,880
Don't you knock

52
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,070
when you enter someone else's room?

53
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:16,800
The entire mansion belongs to me.

54
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:18,070
Why should I knock?

55
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,320
Golden wound-healing medicine.
from the palace.

56
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,400
I'm giving it to you.

57
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,400
If it weren't for the sake of saving Jiu,

58
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:25,710
I won't care

59
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,320
even if you're dead.

60
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:29,590
Your Highness,

61
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:30,670
that's hypocritical generosity.

62
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:31,510
You...

63
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,710
If you were really saving people,

64
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:37,400
why didn't you defend yourself
when you were beaten?

65
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:40,590
Are you deaf?

66
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,800
I said it so many times.
Did you believe me?

67
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,280
Don't you always think

68
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,710
I am evil-minded?

69
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,800
No matter what I say or do,

70
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,000
haven't you always thought
that I have ulterior motives?

71
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:51,710
You once drugged me.

72
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,760
That's a different matter.

73
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:56,110
Anyway, I didn't touch
Vice General Xu's armor.

74
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:57,190
Believe it or not.

75
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:58,510
Ridiculous.

76
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,400
Do you think I'm so easy
to be deceived by you?

77
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:02,430
Fine.

78
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,400
Since you don't believe anything I say,

79
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:06,510
let's stop wasting time.

80
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:07,710
Just get a divorce.

81
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:12,710
Ling Ruojin.

82
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:15,280
Don't think that I don't
see through your game.

83
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,590
Playing hard to get

84
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:17,670
doesn't work on me.

85
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:22,550
Egomania.

86
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,280
Egomania has always

87
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,880
been everywhere..

88
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,030
Your Highness, I've verified it.

89
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,710
The footprints on the armor
do belong to Concubine Liu.

90
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:41,110
Give her only one meal each day

91
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,110
and let her copy the rules for women
a hundred times.

92
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,400
Then Her Highness...

93
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:48,190
I have always know right from wrong.

94
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,880
Right is right, and wrong is wrong.

95
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:51,760
Even a woman like her

96
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,000
is no exception.

97
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,760
Just find a way to make it up to her.

98
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,510
She'll visit her parents tomorrow.

99
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,480
She'll definitely ask you
to accompany her.

100
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:03,800
Why don't you go with her

101
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,840
as compensation?

102
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:09,280
It's too good for her.

103
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:16,280
I got rid of the poison on my face

104
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,550
but I still haven't found out
who did it.

105
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,000
I'd like to see

106
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:23,360
who is behind all this.

107
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,070
Young Lady, time to go.

108
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:29,590
This is what you asked me
to find someone to build.

109
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,920
What are these for?

110
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,480
These are what I use
to make a living.

111
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:53,220
(Ling Xiaobao, young master of the Ling Family)
Kneel down, I'll ride on you.

112
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,240
Xiaobao, be good.

113
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:56,590
Ride on me later.

114
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,110
Let's welcome His Highness first.

115
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,190
It's already late in the morning.

116
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:05,670
Hasn't that woman gotten up yet?

117
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,960
She's so lazy even if
she's going to visit her family.

118
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,880
How improper.

119
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,360
Her Highness left alone two hours ago.

120
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,400
She still has some self-awareness,

121
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,550
knowing I won't go back with her.

122
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,550
Your Highness, didn't you say

123
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:22,960
you want to make it up to her?

124
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:27,480
You heard it wrong.

125
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,920
I couldn't hear it wrong.

126
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,590
Yesterday, I heard it very clearly.

127
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:31,670
There's no mistake.

128
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,880
From today,

129
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,070
you can only have one meal each day too.

130
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:41,030
I...

131
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:45,030
Yes.

132
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,900
(Ms. Lan)

133
00:05:59,110 --> 00:05:59,950
Mother.

134
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,000
Ruojin. Ruojin.

135
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:02,950
You...

136
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,480
Your face looks fine now.

137
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:09,110
Great, it has recovered.

138
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:10,000
I'm sure you are

139
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,880
favored by Prince Chu even more now.

140
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,760
Where is His Highness?

141
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,960
I didn't ask him to come.

142
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,190
I came back alone.

143
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,110
Well said.

144
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:22,800
I think His Highness despises you

145
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,280
and doesn't want to come with you.

146
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,920
If it weren't for His Majesty's decree,

147
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,960
how could His Highness marry you?

148
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:29,920
What does it matter
if your face is fine now?

149
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,000
His Highness still doesn't like you.

150
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:33,280
I think

151
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:34,800
His Highness will

152
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,800
divorce you soon.

153
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,960
It could be a dream come true.

154
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,030
Loser.

155
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:43,150
I thought by marrying Prince Chu,
you could help our family.

156
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:45,400
I didn't expect you to be so useless.

157
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,110
I've raised you for nothing.

158
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,640
What?

159
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,150
Father, you always boast about your integrity.

160
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:57,480
Now you want to sell
your daughter for glory?

161
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,000
If I had known earlier,

162
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:01,670
why didn't you give birth
to more daughters

163
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:02,960
and marry them into the palace?

164
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:04,550
Then you will have

165
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,550
immense wealth and prosperity.

166
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:08,960
Stupid! How could you!

167
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,800
Master, don't be angry with her.

168
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,360
Ruojin, stop that.

169
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,150
Don't make your father angry again.

170
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:19,670
Master, look,
Ruojin has finally come home.

171
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,070
Shall we eat first?

172
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:25,590
Master, Master.

173
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:34,070
Come.

174
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:35,070
Eat more.

175
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,800
You've lost weight.

176
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,640
Xiaobao.

177
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,280
Beat the bad guy. Beat the bad guy.

178
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:47,510
What are you doing?

179
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,000
Quickly apologize to my mother.

180
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,760
What are you angry about?

181
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,960
Xiaobao is still just a child.

182
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:55,190
Why bother arguing with a child?

183
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,000
Just because he is still a child,

184
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,480
he should be disciplined properly.

185
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,000
- He's growing up.
- Xiaobao.

186
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,550
- He should know what he can't do.
- Go.

187
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:03,280
Indulging him

188
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,670
will only make him get worse.

189
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:06,800
Ruojin, forget it.

190
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,800
It's okay.

191
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,510
Master.

192
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,480
Yesterday, Xiaobao saw a fine horse
at the horse market

193
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:14,510
and insisted on buying it.

194
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:17,070
It's not expensive,
only 800 taels of silver.

195
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:17,910
Buy it.

196
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,880
As long as Xiaobao likes it,

197
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,520
I will even pick up the stars

198
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,310
from the sky for him.

199
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:24,470
Thank you, Master.

200
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,880
But I asked the accountant.

201
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:30,560
He said we don't have enough money.

202
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,190
How do you manage the house?

203
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:35,960
How come there's not enough money?

204
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,920
These years,

205
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:41,000
my shops have been losing money.

206
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:43,520
The expenses of the mansion
are increasing.

207
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,800
Stop pretending to be poor
in front of us.

208
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:49,600
I believe everyone here knows

209
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,880
how much dowry

210
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:54,350
you gave your daughter.

211
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:57,390
Did you give her all the money
we need in a year?

212
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,600
What?

213
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:00,560
How dare you!

214
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:03,000
Does this fool

215
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,600
need so much dowry?

216
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,680
I shouldn't have let you,
a merchant daughter, manage the house.

217
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,760
Are you done yet?

218
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:12,720
Father, I would like to ask you

219
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,390
how much is your monthly salary

220
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,310
and how much does this mansion
need to spend a month?

221
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,000
Why are you asking this?

222
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
It seems you don't want to tell us.

223
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,760
Let me help you do the math.

224
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:26,070
You're a fourth-rank official.

225
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:27,800
According to Great Feng's system,

226
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,190
you earn 80 taels of silver per month

227
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,310
and 2,500 kg of rice.

228
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:36,800
The monthly expenses of the house
amount to 1,000 taels of silver.

229
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,190
So I want to ask you,

230
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,880
where did this extra money come from?

231
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,880
Could it be that you're corrupted?

232
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:49,310
Nonsense.

233
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,390
I have been honest and upright
in my official career.

234
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,760
I've never done anything corrupt.

235
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,150
Even if the inspectorate
comes to investigate,

236
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,000
I am not afraid at all.

237
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:03,000
Alright. Since this is the case,

238
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,270
where does the excess difference

239
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,470
come from?

240
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:13,760
Ms. Lan, your father,
who holds the seventh rank,

241
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:16,230
comes here to ask for money

242
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:17,390
whenever he has time.

243
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:18,350
It seems that

244
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,560
he doesn't have much savings either.

245
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:22,310
That's right.

246
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:25,600
The silver we use belongs to her.

247
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,960
But I am a legitimate daughter
of an official family.

248
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:32,880
She is just a merchant's daughter.

249
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:35,560
If it weren't for
having a little money in hand,

250
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:38,190
she wouldn't be the mistress
of the house.

251
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:40,030
Since you think my mother
has a humble status,

252
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:41,600
and you still spend her money,

253
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,390
aren't you degrading yourself?

254
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:44,310
You...

255
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:47,000
How dare you say that about my mom.

256
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,840
Go away.

257
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:50,000
She pushed me.

258
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:52,310
- Master, look at her.
- Father.

259
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,560
Stop!

260
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,440
Silly woman.

261
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,270
This is the daughter you've raised,

262
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,960
talking about money all the time
and lacking in manners.

263
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,190
She's exactly like you.

264
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,600
Talking about money?

265
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:09,000
If it weren't for my mother
paying for your education,

266
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:10,600
how could a poor student like you

267
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,800
take the imperial exam?

268
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:15,000
Now you've become
a high-ranking official.

269
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:17,800
You're not grateful to my mother

270
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,600
but humiliate her
in every possible way.

271
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,390
I would like to ask you.

272
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,600
Did you read all the classics

273
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,560
for nothing?

274
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,150
Ruojin, please stop talking.

275
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,520
Absurd!

276
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:31,960
You treasonous thing.

277
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:34,190
How dare you talk back to me.

278
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,800
I'm going to beat you up today.

279
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,310
- Master, please forgive her.
- Step aside.

280
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:41,880
- Mother.
- Today I must beat her

281
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:43,040
- Try it.
- You...

282
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:45,520
I am Princess Consort Chu.

283
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:47,390
If you hit me,

284
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,390
it's like you hit Prince Chu.
