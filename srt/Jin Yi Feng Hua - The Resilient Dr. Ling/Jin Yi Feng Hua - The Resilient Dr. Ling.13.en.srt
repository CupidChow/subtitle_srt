3
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:14,500
(Ling Ruojin)

4
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:18,380
Darn it, darn it!

5
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,300
(Ling Ruojin)

6
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:21,610
Ling Ruojin.

7
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,020
How come you're so lucky?

8
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:26,980
The Empress favors you,

9
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:29,020
and even Xiao Yehan speaks up for you.

10
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,150
What's so special about you?

11
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:31,170
Tell me!

12
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,690
(Xiao Yehan)
Yehan.

13
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,500
Don't you love me the most?

14
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,980
Are you going to abandon me?

15
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,170
No.

16
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:54,030
I don't allow it.

17
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:55,480
You can only love me for life!

18
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,730
Do you hear that?

19
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,580
Yehan.

20
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:14,810
Yuexi.

21
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:16,170
How did you come here?

22
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:19,130
I'm here to apologize to Ruojin.

23
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:20,690
What's going on?

24
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:25,810
The Empress fell ill this time.

25
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:28,100
I didn't know that
Ruojin's skilled in medicine.

26
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:30,730
Worrying about the Empress's health,

27
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:32,730
I had some complaints about her.

28
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,840
I feel ashamed.

29
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,980
You don't have to blame yourself.

30
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:44,980
I also misunderstood her
at the beginning.

31
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,760
I didn't expect that her
extraordinary medical skills

32
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,540
to be on par with
her talent for poetry.

33
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:56,840
It seems that you didn't care

34
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,900
that Ruojin drugged you before.

35
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:03,540
She saved Mother,

36
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:05,940
which proved she's benevolent,

37
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,540
and not evil.

38
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,320
Although she was wrong to drug me,

39
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,940
she was engaged to me.

40
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,380
I had always been cold to her,

41
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,380
so I'm partly at fault.

42
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:19,020
It's not entirely her fault.

43
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:32,980
Ruojin.

44
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,770
Didn't expect to see you here.

45
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:37,180
I've been looking for you.

46
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,980
What are you up to now?

47
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,170
What are you talking about?

48
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,570
I'm here to apologize to you.

49
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:50,690
Apologize?

50
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,170
I can't afford it.

51
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,770
Lin Yuexi, you are so cunning.

52
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:01,400
Both of Liu Yiyi and Xiaotao
were your pawns

53
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,580
and at your disposal.

54
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,130
Even my elder sister Ling Jinxin

55
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,940
listened to you and gave me

56
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,290
the black spiderwort.

57
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,900
Awesome.

58
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,170
I can't believe

59
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,630
you found out

60
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:22,380
everything I did.

61
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,810
Yes.

62
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:25,540
It was all done by me.

63
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,240
So what?

64
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:30,210
Are you going to report me to Yehan?

65
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,800
Will he trust you

66
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,920
or me?

67
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,630
Since I found evidence once,

68
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:38,690
I can find more.

69
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,330
Don't be arrogant.

70
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,400
Sooner or later,

71
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,130
I will expose your true colors.

72
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:51,580
Unfortunately,

73
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,770
you don't have this chance.

74
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,730
Yuexi.

75
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,480
Yehan, save me.

76
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,400
- Lin Yuexi.
- Yuexi.

77
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,940
You're crazy. Let me see.

78
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,770
Why did you do this?

79
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:14,960
She used the same trick twice.

80
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,290
Only a fool like you would believe that.

81
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,380
I came to apologize to her,

82
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:22,770
but

83
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:26,610
Ruojin said it wasn't easy
for her to get this position.

84
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:29,500
She told me I couldn't see you anymore.

85
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,170
When I refused,

86
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:35,020
she tried to kill me with a dagger.

87
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,380
It's okay Let's go.

88
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,540
I originally thought
I had misunderstood you.

89
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,020
But you are so cunning and malicious.

90
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,380
Ling Ruojin, you have disappointed me.

91
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,030
Your Highness, Her Highness is here.

92
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:06,420
Do you know your crime?

93
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,480
I told you.

94
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,800
I didn't do it.

95
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,590
At this point,
do you still want to deny?

96
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:13,840
I have found it.

97
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,070
It was Lin Yuexi

98
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:17,100
who told Ling Jinxin
about the black spiderwort.

99
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,190
She disfigured me

100
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:21,380
killed Liu Yiyi,

101
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:23,110
and poisoned the Empress.

102
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:24,440
All these things

103
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,880
were done by Lin Yuexi...

104
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,720
Shut up.

105
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:28,400
Lin Yuexi almost lost her life.

106
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,770
You still want to slander her.

107
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,130
It's simply heinous.

108
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:35,380
I must teach you a lesson today.

109
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:37,190
Drag her down

110
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:38,130
and flog her 30 times.

111
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:41,980
Your Highness, I'm sorry.

112
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:44,480
Let me go.

113
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,730
Let me go.

114
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,210
The Empress's token is here.

115
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:49,150
(Token)

116
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:50,580
I dare anyone to touch me.

117
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:57,030
Xiao Yehan, it's fine that you
confuse right and wrong.

118
00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:00,980
Now you disrespect the Empress.

119
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,130
Even I can't do anything to you

120
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:19,380
because of Mother's token,

121
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:22,610
from now on,

122
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,940
let's break things off.

123
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,730
Your Highness, you are joking.

124
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,150
We were married by decree.

125
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:34,760
There is no bond between us.

126
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,440
Since you don't believe me so much,

127
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,880
let's just break up now.

128
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,770
Okay.

129
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:44,060
(Divorce Letter)

130
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:51,740
(Xiao Yehan's wife Ling Ruojin is
narrow-minded, jealous, and malicious.)

131
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,020
The divorce letter is here.

132
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,320
Now

133
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,980
you are no longer my wife.

134
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,030
Your Highness, you got it wrong.

135
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:16,540
It's not you who break up with me.

136
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,130
It's me who's breaking up with you.

137
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,100
From now on,

138
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,770
you are no longer my husband.

139
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:37,660
(Divorce Letter Xiao Yehan's blind
and heartless. I hereby divorce him.)

140
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:38,840
Young Lady.

141
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,550
You finally married Prince Chu.

142
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:41,630
Are you really leaving?

143
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:44,070
Yes, it's better to leave

144
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:45,150
such a man like him sooner.

145
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:46,510
But from now on,

146
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:48,330
you'll have no one to rely on.

147
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,580
How will you manage?

148
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,440
Don't worry.

149
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,800
With our abilities,

150
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,150
we can still live a good life

151
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:00,540
without men.

152
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:03,580
So what are your plans, Young Lady?

153
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:09,020
I'll open a clinic.

154
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:11,870
