=Episode 14=

3
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:12,500
(Chunfeng Clinic)

4
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:14,190
There are so many clinics
in the capital city.

5
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:15,670
Why everyone is waiting here?

6
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:16,670
Just go to another clinic.

7
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:19,360
Dr. Ling not only has good medical skills
but also charges low fees.

8
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,630
We're willing to wait a bit longer.

9
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:21,860
- Really?
- Yes.

10
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:23,150
Ma'am.

11
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:24,480
Follow this prescription

12
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,670
and take it three times a day.

13
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:27,360
It will help relieve your

14
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,500
cold and cough symptoms.

15
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,940
Doctor, here's the payment.

16
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:39,420
One is enough.

17
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:41,360
Thank you, Dr. Ling.

18
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,290
You're welcome.

19
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,800
Remember to take your medicine on time.

20
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:46,730
Okay.

21
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:48,720
(Chunfeng Clinic)

22
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:49,260
President Wang.

23
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,030
Chunfeng Clinic
sells medicine at low prices

24
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:52,030
and disrupts the market.

25
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:53,720
You can't let her continue like this.

26
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:54,600
Yes.

27
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,150
We haven't had any patients
for several days.

28
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:58,030
At this rate,

29
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:00,590
how can we explain to Prince Yan?

30
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:01,540
Yes.

31
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,380
(Three days ago)

32
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,280
Recently,
Capital Physicians' Guild income has plummeted,

33
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,330
falling to less than 30%
of what it used to be.

(Wang Baoshan,)
Wang Baoshan.

(President of the Physicians' Guild)
Wang Baoshan.

36
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:14,400
You are so bold,

37
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,590
daring to embezzle my money.

38
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:16,960
I dare not, Your Highness.

39
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,670
The Physicians' Guild is your property.

40
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:20,070
How could I have the audacity

41
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:22,190
to covet your money?

42
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:25,030
It's just a new clinic opened
in the capital

43
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:26,500
is attracting customers with low prices.

44
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,550
Other clinics have lost their patients,

45
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:30,170
so their income has dropped.

46
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,550
Loser!

47
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:33,510
Can't even handle such a small matter.

48
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,540
What qualifications do you have
to be the president?

49
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:37,980
Your Highness, please calm down.

50
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,360
I will handle it right away.

51
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,440
Right away.

52
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,540
Right away. Right away.

53
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,130
You are the new doctor?

54
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,510
Yes, who are you?

55
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:05,730
I am the president
of the Capital Physicians' Guild.

56
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,810
Since you have opened a clinic
in the capital city,

57
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:12,320
you must comply with
the Guild's regulations.

58
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,980
We have a standard fee.

59
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,770
Standard fee?

60
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:17,810
How much is it?

61
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:23,420
The consultation fee
is at least one silver coin.

62
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,330
Medication costs are not included.

63
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:28,690
So expensive.

64
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:30,480
How could these poor common folks

65
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,840
afford to pay for the medical expenses?

66
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,250
You don't need to worry about this.

67
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,360
With our guild here,

68
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,000
all clinics follow
the same pricing standard.

69
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,440
They have no way out.

70
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,230
You only need to pay 30%
of your annual income

71
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:43,360
as a membership fee

72
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,610
to earn high profits.

73
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,860
How does it sound?

74
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:50,510
You only care about your own interests

75
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:52,290
and ignore the well-being
of the common people.

76
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,500
You’re nothing but a scum in the industry.

77
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,690
Now you want me to get on board?

78
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,380
Stop dreaming.

79
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,550
Don't get on my bad side.

80
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:06,460
Dare to go against the Guild,

81
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:08,940
I'll see how you can establish yourself
in the capital city.

82
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:18,130
President.

83
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:20,720
Chunfeng Clinic not only
refuses to raise its prices,

84
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,840
but also offers free medical
consultations three times a month.

85
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,840
At this rate,
we're all going to be doomed.

86
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,230
You have to figure out a solution.

87
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:27,240
Yes.

88
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:30,280
A small clinic with no background

89
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,980
dares to go against the Guild.

90
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,650
I will definitely teach it a lesson.

91
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,650
My Lord.

92
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,720
My Lord.

93
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,630
Greetings, My Lord.

94
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:42,980
You trash.

95
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:45,400
(Xie Nanyuan, heir of Marquis Zhennan)
I've taken so much of your medicine,

96
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,110
but it hasn't had any effect at all.

97
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:48,400
You can close your clinic.

98
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,250
Smash it!

99
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:51,920
Please calm down.

100
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,230
Even the imperial physicians
can't cure your illness.

101
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:56,030
We don't know what to do.

102
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:57,110
Please forgive us.

103
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:58,610
In your dreams!

104
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:01,100
If I die,

105
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,540
I'll take you all with me.

106
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:06,860
The pain is killing me.

107
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:11,760
I have an idea.

108
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,920
I've heard that Dr. Ling
of Chunfeng Clinic

109
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,030
claims to be
a miracle-working doctor

110
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:19,470
and boasts that there is no disease
that she cannot cure.

111
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:22,670
You can go and give it a try.

112
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:24,290
What are you waiting for?

113
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:25,940
Take me there.

114
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:34,030
This "scapegoat" tactic

115
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:36,210
is brilliant.

116
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,630
Marquis Zhennan was
a founding hero

117
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:41,400
and enjoys a high prestige
in the military.

118
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,330
Even His Majesty needs to respect him.

119
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:46,290
His son's status is as prestigious
as that of a prince.

120
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,980
Ling Ruojin will be in big trouble.

121
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:54,550
God is on my side.

122
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:55,420
Yes.

123
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,990
Where is Dr. Ling?

124
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:04,230
I'm a lord. Come out.

125
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:05,290
Someone is going to die here.

126
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,730
Come and sit over here.

127
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,250
Jesus.

128
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:14,650
Are you kidding me?

129
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,960
I'm looking for a doctor.

130
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,540
Why is it a woman?

131
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:20,400
It seems like

132
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,580
you look down on female doctors.

133
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,860
What do women know about medicine?

134
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:27,250
And you boast about yourself.

135
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:28,500
Guards.

136
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,590
Smash this clinic.

137
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:31,810
- Yes.
- Hold on.

138
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:33,580
My Lord.

139
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:36,860
Do you suffer from severe
lower abdominal pain,

140
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:40,070
accompanied by nausea,
loss of appetite, and vomiting?

141
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:41,280
How do you know?

142
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,250
Do you really know medicine?

143
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,880
How do you know?

144
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,290
Do you really know medicine?

145
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,510
This is

146
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:54,440
acute appendicitis,

147
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:58,190
caused by inflammation
from a blockage in the appendix.

148
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,240
Appendix?

149
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,080
Inflammation?

150
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,730
What are all these things?

151
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:05,540
Yes.

152
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,190
What are these things?

153
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:08,840
I've never heard of them.

154
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,420
You must be lying to me.

155
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,650
Smash this clinic.

156
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,320
Just because you haven't heard of it,

157
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,770
doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

158
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,650
Your symptoms aren't serious.

159
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:20,030
Take some medicine

160
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:21,650
to reduce the inflammation
and you will be fine.

161
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,090
Okay.

162
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,460
Give me the medicine quickly.

163
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:30,860
Reduce the inflammation, right?

164
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,130
Do it.

165
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:35,500
Give me your hand.

166
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:49,480
How do you feel?

167
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,500
It doesn't hurt anymore.

168
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,190
What I gave you

169
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:01,020
is a painkiller that I made myself.

170
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:05,020
This is the anti-inflammatory drug.

171
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,400
(Anti-inflammatory Drug)
Take it back.

172
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,550
Use it three times a day,

173
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:09,110
one pill each time.

174
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:10,250
You'll be healed

175
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:12,250
in about three days.

176
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:14,460
I didn't expect that

177
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,130
you actually know your stuff.

178
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,170
My Lord.

179
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,980
Do you have pain

180
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,720
and blood in your stools?

181
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,110
Good for you.

182
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:28,610
How did you see that?

183
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,020
You can treat this too?

184
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,580
Do I need to reduce the inflammation?

185
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,730
No need.

186
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:44,000
Here you go.

187
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,510
Take one in the morning
and one in the evening.

188
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:46,940
It'll take immediate effect.

189
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,290
That's not for you to eat.

190
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:57,420
That is

191
00:07:58,030 --> 00:07:59,020
for you to use

192
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,330
in your rectum.

193
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,990
I didn't expect that

194
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,020
your medical skills are indeed superb.

195
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:14,650
Why don't you just close the clinic

196
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:18,940
and be my personal physician?

197
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:22,980
I'm not interested in serving you rich kids.

198
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:26,600
Not interested?

199
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,570
Isn't it just about money?

200
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,450
Is 100 taels enough?

201
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,700
200 taels?

202
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,480
Three...

203
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,070
I have already said

204
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:45,570
I am not interested.

205
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,170
300 taels per month.

206
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:53,780
Your clinic can't make
that much money in a year.

207
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,560
My Lord.

208
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,310
Take this money back.

209
00:08:57,310 --> 00:08:58,560
I'm busy.

210
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,370
Goodbye, My Lord.

211
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,620
Please leave.

212
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,060
(Chunfeng Clinic)

213
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,530
My Lord.

214
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,030
This female doctor
completely disregards you.

215
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:23,100
Do you want me to...

216
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:29,740
There are actually people
who does not love money.

217
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:33,330
She is different from
all the women I have met before.

218
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,820
Interesting.

219
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:39,900
(Chunfeng Clinic)

220
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,390
His Lordship must have been causing
a scene at Chunfeng Clinic.

221
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:46,760
President, this move

222
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,060
is brilliant!

223
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:52,130
This is the consequence
of going against me.

224
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:55,230
President.

225
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:56,450
President, bad news.

226
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:59,680
Dr. Ling saved His Lordship's life.

227
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,350
Our plan failed.

228
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:03,290
What?

229
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,030
She cured a disease

230
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:06,560
that even imperial physicians
cannot cure?

231
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,430
Could it be that

232
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:08,110
her medical skills

233
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:09,800
are even greater than
the imperial physicians'?

234
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,760
What should we do, President?

235
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,450
Nonsense!

236
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,250
She just got lucky.

237
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:19,660
Ling Ruojin, let's wait and see.

238
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:24,760
I just gave you
fever-reducing medicine a few days ago.

239
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,960
Why is the fever

240
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,230
even worse now?

241
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:30,880
The medicine you prescribed
is too expensive.

242
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,310
I can't afford it.

243
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:33,520
How is that possible?

244
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:36,060
The medicine I prescribed
mainly contains forsythia suspensa,

245
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:38,070
which only costs a few cents.

246
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:41,800
But other clinics say
it costs one tael...

247
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,290
One tael of silver.

248
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,860
One tael of silver?

249
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,280
What's wrong, Xiaozhu?

250
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,920
Recently, there has been an outbreak
of infectious fever in the capital.

251
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,640
Many people are affected.

252
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:54,880
Other pharmacies monopolized
the supply of forsythia suspensa

253
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,880
and inflated the price.

254
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,680
Now it is over 100 times the normal rate.

255
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,940
It's really annoying.

256
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:01,130
They've gone too far.

257
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:02,910
Let's go find them.
