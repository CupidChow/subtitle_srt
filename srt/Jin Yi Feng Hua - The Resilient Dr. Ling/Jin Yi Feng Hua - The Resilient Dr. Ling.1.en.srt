=The Resilient Dr. Ling=

2
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:09,340
=Episode 1=

3
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:16,280
(Xiao Yehan, Prince Chu)
You despicable woman.

4
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:19,360
How dare you try to drug me!

5
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,320
I have been engaged to you
for a long time,

6
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,880
but you kept trying to break it off..

7
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,760
Is it just because
my face is disfigured?

8
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,070
Not just your face.

9
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:31,070
Your heart

10
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:32,960
is even dirtier.

11
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:41,510
Even if you use such despicable means

12
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,510
to get me into bed,

13
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,150
I have absolutely no feelings for you.

14
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,320
Every inch of your skin,

15
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,550
and every strand of your hair

16
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,280
makes me feel disgusted.

17
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:02,760
(Even with our intimate relations,)

18
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,110
(you still despise me so much.)

19
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,030
(Then I will leave this world)

20
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,840
(and stop being an eyesore to you.)

21
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:19,590
(Real Estate Ownership Certificate)
Oh my goodness.

22
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:20,630
Is she obsessed with love?

23
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:23,150
(Ling Ruojin, renowned physician)
For a man who doesn't love her,

24
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,070
she chose to commit suicide.

25
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:26,880
Can't she live without a man?

26
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:30,960
What's going on?

27
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:56,840
Where am I?

28
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,880
Why am I hanging myself?

29
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,110
Isn't this the heroine

30
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,510
in the TV series?

31
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:16,230
How did I become her?

32
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,990
(Ling Jinyu, third lady of the Ling family)
You scared me!

33
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:26,230
Who are you?

34
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:28,190
Are you playing dumb?

35
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,280
You are going to marry
Prince Chu tomorrow.

36
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:33,150
Your mother, that businesswoman,

37
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:35,320
must have given you
a lot of jewelry as your dowry.

38
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:36,800
Hand them all over.

39
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,230
I see.

40
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,510
You are the sarcastic

41
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:43,280
and cynical younger sister.

42
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,400
How dare you!

43
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,600
Open your mouth.

44
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:49,440
Dry eyes.

45
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:51,070
Thick white coating on the tongue.

46
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,590
You often get angry easily, don't you?

47
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,150
Watch your temper.

48
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:58,190
and control it.

49
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,510
Don't talk nonsense to me.

50
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:01,760
I'm asking you one last time.

51
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,150
Will you hand in the dowry or not?

52
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,800
My mother gave me the dowry.

53
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,280
Why should I give it to you?

54
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:07,800
Moreover,

55
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,150
I am your elder sister.

56
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,030
Have some respect.

57
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,630
Ugly girl.

58
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:13,920
I will let you know today

59
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,030
how to show respect.

60
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:20,880
How dare you hit me?

61
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,840
Get her!

62
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:29,510
Young Lady.

63
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:30,870
Young Lady.

64
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,720
Don't touch me.

65
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:35,880
Young Lady, what's wrong with you?

66
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,880
Ling Ruojin.

67
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:39,510
What have you done to me?

68
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,640
I

69
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,230
just gave you a little poke
in your funny bone.

70
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,590
I guess

71
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,110
it can make you laugh for six hours.

72
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,400
Unblock it.

73
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,800
I'm telling you.

74
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,800
I'm always your elder sister.

75
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,170
Do you dare to do it again?

76
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,480
I dare not. I dare not.

77
00:03:58,670 --> 00:03:59,920
That's more like it.

78
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,400
Ling Ruojin, I'm going to tell Father.

79
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,670
You have actually learned witchcraft.

80
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:07,880
So much nonsense.

81
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,400
It seems like
you haven't laughed enough yet.

82
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:10,630
I'll give you another needle.

83
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,640
Let's go.

84
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,880
So childish.

85
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,840
This thing doesn't look natural.

86
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:27,960
Clearly it's poisoned.

87
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,280
Fine.

88
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:31,800
Anyway, I am a doctor.

89
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:34,480
This little thing doesn't bother me.

90
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,030
(Take things as they come.)

91
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,760
(Since God has turned me into you,)

92
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:55,880
(I will live a good life for you)

93
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,000
(and won't let you get bullied again.)

94
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:02,820
(Xiaozhu, maid)

95
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:07,800
Young Lady.

96
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,590
If you don't leave now,
you will miss the auspicious time.

97
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:10,880
Master will get angry.

98
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,840
I'm coming.

99
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:18,380
(Xiao Yehan, Prince Chu)

100
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,070
My Lady, I feel strong killing intent

101
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:28,510
in His Highness's swordsmanship.

102
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
It's all because of
that wicked woman Ling Ruojin.

103
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,100
(Biluo, maid; Liu Yiyi, concubine)
Wait until she enters the mansion.

104
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,760
I must teach her a lesson.

105
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:38,340
(Huo Chong, Prince Chu's guard)

106
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:48,820
(Mother of the Ling family;
Ling Jinxin, first lady of the Ling family)

107
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,500
(Ling Sinian, father of the Ling family)
Ruojin, I don't know marrying into there

108
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:55,070
is a bless or a curse.

109
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:59,150
Take good care of yourself.

110
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,510
Why are you crying?

111
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,960
It's her honor that this ugly woman

112
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,030
can marry the prince.

113
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:07,020
Get in the sedan chair quickly.

114
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,280
Don't delay the wedding ceremony.

115
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,920
Mom, don't worry.

116
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:12,480
No matter how terrible the place is,

117
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,960
I can give it a try.

118
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:26,190
Did you get the things

119
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:28,190
for the wedding room ready?

120
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:29,920
Don't worry, Your Highness.
Everything is ready

121
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,280
following your orders.

122
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:34,320
Ling Ruojin is shameless.

123
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:37,230
She used every trick to marry me.

124
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,600
Today,

125
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,400
I will make her lose face.

126
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,740
(Double Happiness)

127
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,800
The bride is here.

128
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:53,230
Oh, Miss Ling looks very scary.

129
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:55,510
Why does Prince Chu want to marry her?

130
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:58,190
I heard that Prince Chu
got drunk that night

131
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,360
and decided to marry her.

132
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:02,190
(It's not easy to disobey)

133
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:03,360
(His Majesty's marriage arrangement.)

134
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,000
(I'll complete the process first)

135
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:06,670
(and divorce him later.)

136
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:10,800
The groom has arrived.

137
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:13,110
The groom is here.

138
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:14,030
Excuse me.

139
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:15,510
The groom has arrived.

140
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:17,770
An ugly woman marries a rooster.

141
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:18,810
- Perfect match.
- Bride.

142
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:20,510
Let's get on with the ceremony.

143
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,070
This is too much, Young Lady.

144
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:25,520
Don't get married. Let's go back.

145
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,070
I, Ling Ruojin,

146
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:31,000
am marrying Prince Chu

147
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:32,960
under His Majesty's order.

148
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,590
Even with this rooster,

149
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:37,480
whoever performs
the wedding ceremony with me

150
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,070
is Prince Chu.

151
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:43,840
- Today is our big day.
- Shameless.

152
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,190
Who among you is good at painting?

153
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,320
Why not paint a portrait
of the two of us?

154
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,880
I'll reward ten taels of gold.

155
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:54,630
Ten taels of gold?

156
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:55,880
And then

157
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,880
I will post this painting
all over the capital city

158
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,840
to make everyone in the world see

159
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:03,800
Prince Chu's majestic bearing.

160
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:08,760
If Prince Chu is a rooster,

161
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,190
then what about His Majesty?

162
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:13,590
Do you know?

163
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,680
And you?

164
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:15,820
That bad woman.

165
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,470
How dare you!

166
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:31,270
Spoke without reservation,
and with no respect for elders.

167
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,390
You are so bold.

168
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:35,150
I'm just stating the facts.

169
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:36,560
It's you, Your Highness,

170
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,270
who found a rooster to marry me.

171
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:39,720
Are you humiliating me

172
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,230
or His Majesty?

173
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,180
This bad woman.

174
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:44,320
- Biluo, tear off her veil.
- A sharp tongue and ugly looks.

175
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,680
I want to make her
embarrassed in public.

176
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,110
- It's no wonder that women like you
- Yes.

177
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,840
are despised by everyone.

178
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,470
You look very dignified.

179
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,800
But you also act

180
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,640
in a disgraceful manner.

181
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,800
You...

182
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,780
Young Lady.

183
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,160
Your face looks fine now.

184
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,790
I can't believe it.

185
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,600
Her looks

186
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,390
are worthy of our Prince Chu.

187
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:23,030
What's the point
of having a rooster replacing him?

188
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:24,230
- How could this happen?
- Yes.

189
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:30,640
I did not expect

190
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:31,880
your face has actually recovered.

191
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:33,230
All of this

192
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,470
was arranged by you, right?

193
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,920
This is your mansion.

194
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,430
It should be said that all of this

195
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:39,840
was arranged by you, Your Highness.

196
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:41,310
And this maid.

197
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:42,720
Isn't she also from your mansion?

198
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:44,840
No, Your Highness.

199
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,230
I didn't stand firm.

200
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:49,430
I know you don't want to marry me.

201
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,470
I don't want to marry you either.

202
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:54,640
Since His Majesty has already
arranged the marriage,

203
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,030
the process

204
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:57,390
should be followed.

205
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:59,110
Let's just get divorced in the end.

206
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,480
Divorce?

207
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,350
Do you think I will believe you?

208
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,800
If you dare to disobey
the imperial edict today,

209
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:11,350
you have my respect.

210
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:12,540
Your Highness.

211
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:14,870
You can't resist the imperial edict

212
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,320
in front of everyone.

213
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,440
Start the ceremony.

214
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,980
Bow to the heavens and the earth.

215
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,150
Bow to the parents.

216
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:34,950
Bow to each other.

217
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,810
Good.

218
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:44,780
Rest assured.

219
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,140
One day, I will divorce you.

220
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,960
That's what I wish for.

221
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:55,310
Ling Ruojin.

222
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:56,630
I really underestimated her.

223
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,440
Fortunately, His Highness will not
spend the night with her.

224
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,640
I heard that Ling Ruojin
has always been a pushover,

225
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,600
weak and coward.

226
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:04,450
How come she seems like
a different person now?

227
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,800
I don't care how she turns out.

228
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,800
I will let her know

229
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:09,310
who is in charge
of Prince Chu's Mansion.

230
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:19,910
Sorry, Ruojin.

231
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:22,470
All the chairs in this mansion
have been sent for repairs.

232
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:24,350
This is the last one left.

233
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:27,690
Please have breakfast

234
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:28,540
while standing.

235
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,270
My Lady, you are the legitimate wife.

236
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,640
She is just a concubine.

237
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,480
There is no reason for you
to stand while she sits.

238
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:35,570
It's nothing.

239
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:37,990
I didn't care

240
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:39,730
to be the Princess Consort
in the first place.

241
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:41,100
When the time comes,
we should divorce.

242
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,070
Just let her sit on this chair.

243
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:46,750
We can just take some food back to eat.

244
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:03,680
Oh, I'm really sorry.

245
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,800
Slip of the hand.

246
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:07,610
Why don't you just eat the breakfast
on the ground?

247
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,160
You clearly did it on purpose.

248
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:11,630
Why did you overturn
Young Lady's breakfast?

249
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:16,670
You insolent servant.

250
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,940
How could you talk to me like this?

251
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:20,520
- How are you feeling?
- Ruojin.

252
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,770
-Your servant is so unruly.
- Are you okay?

253
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,770
I taught her a lesson for you.

254
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:26,380
I hope you don't mind.

255
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,220
Of course not.

256
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:33,140
However, I hope

257
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:36,250
you don't mind this too.
