00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:07,420
=The Resilient Dr. Ling=

2
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:09,340
=Episode 26=

3
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,840
This is the truelove knot you just won.

4
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:32,840
May I have the one

5
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,000
you won?

6
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,550
It's not anything valuable anyway.

7
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,030
If you like it, you can have it.

8
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,590
Since you and he were separated
at the palace,

9
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:49,150
he has been constantly thinking of you.

10
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:50,550
He hasn't enjoyed tea

11
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:51,670
or food,

12
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,670
and has grown thinner day by day.

13
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,110
When you came to help,

14
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:57,840
His Highness was happier than anyone,

15
00:00:58,190 --> 00:00:59,360
but he kept it to himself.

16
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:01,840
Even though he's been busy
during this time,

17
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:03,800
he's always been thinking of you.

18
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,230
You are my wife.

19
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,320
It's only natural for a husband

20
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,960
to protect his wife.

21
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:30,030
You're awake.

22
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,440
I'll help you. Slowly.

23
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,550
Are you okay?

24
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:41,800
You're still

25
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:45,670
keeping this.

26
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,280
This was the first thing
you ever gave me.

27
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,070
To me,

28
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:53,840
it is the most precious.

29
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,280
But we are no longer husband and wife.

30
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:59,070
It isn't worth

31
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,600
doing it.

32
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,670
To me, as long as it's for you,

33
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,920
it's worth doing anything.

34
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,320
Why are you so foolish?

35
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,480
I am indeed foolish.

36
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,000
That's why I misunderstood you before

37
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:19,280
and did so many things that hurt you.

38
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,680
Ruojin.

39
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:28,000
Give me a chance.

40
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:30,320
Come back to me

41
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,760
and be my wife again, will you?

42
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,840
I can't do this.

43
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:04,000
Why not?

44
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,360
Men are all liars.

45
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,920
How do I know if you're lying to me?

46
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:09,230
Why should I believe you?

47
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:11,070
It's absolutely true.

48
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,630
Every word I say is from my heart,

49
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:14,800
there's nothing false about it.

50
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,070
All right then.

51
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,280
I'll trust you for now.

52
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,280
But I haven't promised anything.

53
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,670
I'll see how you behave in the future.

54
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:26,550
Don't worry.

55
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,590
I will certainly behave well.

56
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:36,510
- Your Highness.
- Ruojin.

57
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:37,350
Your...

58
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:39,800
This is the most famous
roasted chicken in Jiangzhou.

59
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:42,710
I got up early and stood in line
just to buy it for you.

60
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:44,190
You've been working hard lately.

61
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,800
Here, have some to nourish yourself.

62
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,440
It's too greasy.

63
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,280
I don't want it.

64
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:49,870
You're right.

65
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:51,590
I don't like greasy food either.

66
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,400
Try this white fungus soup.

67
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:55,840
It's sweet and refreshing,

68
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,880
not greasy at all.

69
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,280
This is too sweet.

70
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,710
Having too much of it will make me fat.

71
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,150
That's alright.

72
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,360
Even if you get fatter,

73
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:07,150
I will still like you the same.

74
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:08,720
What?

75
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,960
Are you saying me fat?

76
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,150
No, no, I didn't mean that.

77
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:14,550
Forget this white fungus soup.

78
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:15,400
Let's not eat it.

79
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:17,030
Have something else.

80
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,200
Your Highness.

81
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,960
You're being way too submissive.

82
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:23,400
What do you mean?

83
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:26,670
Nothing. I'm here to report something.

84
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:28,510
Liu Chun has confessed everything.

85
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,400
Inciting the people, killing patients,

86
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,510
and even spreading the plague,

87
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:33,880
all of it was done under the orders
of Lin Yuexi and Prince Yan.

88
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,760
Indeed.

89
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:36,440
Before I came to Jiangzhou,

90
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:39,630
I also found the hideout
where they stored Hu medicines.

91
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,710
They frequently trade with Hu people,

92
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:44,360
so it wasn't hard for them

93
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:46,230
to get Hu people's bodies
to create the plague.

94
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,120
Outrageous!

95
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,710
To fight for power and the throne,

96
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,360
they disregarded the lives of the people

97
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,280
and committed such heartless acts.

98
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,710
I will not let them off easily.

99
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:00,800
But now that we have
both witnesses and evidence,

100
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,230
it won't be hard to convict them.

101
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,000
Most importantly,

102
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:07,150
we can't let them act
out of desperation.

103
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,120
That's right.

104
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,480
We need to think of a way

105
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,000
to catch them all in one go.

106
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:16,510
- Got it.
- Got it.

107
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:18,670
- Lure the snake out of its hole.
- Lure the snake out of its hole.

108
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:25,030
Since Xiao Nanyang and Lin Yuexi
want to fight for power,

109
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:27,440
we must create an opportunity for them.

110
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:31,510
We just need to temporarily
transfer the major troops out of the capital

111
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:33,400
and make them think
the capital is poorly defended.

112
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:36,440
They won't be able
to resist taking action.

113
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,320
Once they make a move,

114
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,440
it will confirm their guilt.

115
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,440
They won't be able
to argue their way out of it.

116
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,550
It's over, It's all over.

117
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:51,800
Liu Chun has been caught.
He'll surely rat me out.

118
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,880
And Xiao Yehan has resolved
the plague in Jiangzhou.

119
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:55,280
Once he returns to the capital,

120
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:57,510
and accuses me
in front of Mother and Father,

121
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,670
I'll be doomed.

122
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,710
No, that won't happen.

123
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:04,710
You still have one last chance.

124
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:05,920
What is it?

125
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,710
Raise a rebellion.

126
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,760
Rebellion?

127
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,880
The southern front
is in a tense situation.

128
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:19,480
The troops stationed in the capital
have all been sent to the frontlines.

129
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:21,360
The capital
is poorly defended right now.

130
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,030
We have already bribed
the commander of the Royal Guards.

131
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:25,670
Rebellion at this time

132
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:27,920
is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

133
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,880
B-But...

134
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,480
If we don't rebel,
there's only a dead end.

135
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:37,550
If we rebel,
there's still a chance for survival.

136
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:41,230
Can't you figure it out, Your Highness?

137
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,480
Alright, let's do as you say.

138
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,880
The plague in Jiangzhou
has been successfully resolved.

139
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:57,440
I'm greatly relieved.

140
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,320
Come on.

141
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,480
To celebrate,

142
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,670
let's all have a drink.

143
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:06,800
Thank you, Father.

144
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,240
Your Majesty,

145
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,670
the plague in Jiangzhou
was fierce this time.

146
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:16,710
Yehan and Ruojin

147
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:17,880
developed the medicine in time

148
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,070
to quell the plague

149
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,900
and saved countless lives.

150
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,510
Having a Prince
and Princess Consort like this

151
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:24,150
is truly a blessing for Great Feng.

152
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,070
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

153
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:30,960
Yehan, you and your wife
have done an excellent job,

154
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,590
remaining calm in the face of danger

155
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:33,880
and showing both courage and wisdom.

156
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,590
You are both our role models.

157
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,710
- Thank you, Father.
- Thank you, Father.

158
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,030
Tomorrow morning at court,

159
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:42,800
I will issue an imperial edict,

160
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,190
appointing you as Crown Prince,

161
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:46,710
and Princess Consort Chu
as the Crown Princess.

162
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,360
- Thank you, Father.
- Thank you, Father.

163
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,840
Wait.

164
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,070
Father, I object.

165
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:00,840
Xiao Yehan is not fit
to be the Crown Prince.

166
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,190
In terms of age, I am older than him.

167
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,510
In terms of birth, my mother
was from a noble family,

168
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:10,440
but his mother was just
a lowly palace maid.

169
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:12,280
How can he compare to me in any way?

170
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,480
Father, hastily appointing him
as Crown Prince

171
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:16,000
will not only make me dissatisfied

172
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,800
but also all the civil
and military officials.

173
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:19,800
I urge you to reconsider, Father.

174
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,680
The one least fit is you.

175
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,070
As a prince,

176
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:33,560
you engaged in corruption
out of greed and self-interest,

177
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:35,470
and even threw corpses of Hu people

178
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,350
into the water to create an epidemic

179
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:39,350
in your quest for power.

180
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,110
Your crimes are beyond redemption.

181
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:49,600
The evidence of corruption and the Testimonies
from the plague case are here.

182
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,150
(Accounting Records from Prince Yan)
Please have a look, Father and Mother.

183
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:58,360
(Change Duan Ruikang to Duan Xuan,
awaiting the final list)

184
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:01,130
(Received from Prime Minister Zhang Jiu'an:
900,000 taels of silver,)

185
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,940
(2 boxes of special products
from the Western Regions)

186
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:07,950
Outrageous!

187
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:10,960
Nanyang, how dare you!

188
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,520
Father, please discern.

189
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,310
All the evidence was fabricated by them.

190
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,230
I have always been loyal to the country

191
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:20,760
and devoted to you and Mother.

192
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,840
Heaven and earth can bear witness.

193
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:23,520
But Xiao Yehan

194
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,470
has been scheming to harm me all along.

195
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,520
Father,

196
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,760
please arrest them both immediately.

197
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:31,680
You dare speak of loyalty?

198
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:33,600
Weren't you the one who poisoned Mother

199
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,640
with Hu medicine,

200
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,190
almost taking her life?

201
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:40,800
Your so-called loyalty is venomous!

202
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:41,910
Nonsense!

203
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:43,640
There's a pharmacy
in the western part of the city.

204
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:46,230
Officially, it sells medicinal herbs,

205
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:49,800
but in reality, it's a hideout
for storing Hu medicine.

206
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:51,190
And the secret owners of it

207
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,920
are Xiao Nanyang and Lin Yuexi.

208
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:56,920
If Father and Mother don't believe me,

209
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,150
send someone to investigate.

210
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:08,250
Cheating in the imperial exam,
creating a plague, and poisoning the Empress...

211
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,880
It's all your doing!

212
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,920
What do you have to say now?

213
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:24,760
Ling Ruojin.

214
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,470
I truly underestimated you.

215
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,430
You even managed to discover
the pharmacy in the west of the city.

216
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,680
Yes, it was me. So what?

217
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:37,470
I've poisoned all of your wine.

218
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:40,000
In less than half an hour,

219
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:42,880
the poison will take effect,
and you'll all die.

220
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,360
By then,

221
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,310
not only will the title
of Crown Prince be mine,

222
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,720
but the throne

223
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:49,640
as well!

224
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:59,720
Are you talking about
the rouge red in the wine?

225
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,430
Just one drop could kill an elephant?

226
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,190
You really are vicious.

227
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,880
But have you thought

228
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:09,840
that since I found out
about your pharmacy hideout,

229
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,920
how could I let you succeed so easily?

230
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:14,840
That's impossible.

231
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,640
Nanyang, stop making more mistakes.

232
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:25,070
Kneel before Father and Mother
and confess to your crime.

233
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:32,920
Confess?

234
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,070
Ridiculous.

235
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,960
I admit,

236
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:38,880
you do have some skills.

237
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:41,880
But do you think
these are the only tricks I have?

238
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,680
Let me tell you.

239
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:45,760
I've bribed the Royal Guards.

240
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:48,600
The entire palace is surrounded.

241
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:51,960
The major troops guarding the capital
have gone to the frontlines.

242
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:55,560
Now the entire capital
is under my control.

243
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:59,520
None of you will escape.

244
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:04,350
How dare you rebel?

245
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:07,950
Rebel?

246
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,190
So what if I rebel?

247
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:14,680
This throne should belong to me!

248
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:16,150
Whoever dares stop me

249
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,230
will die!
