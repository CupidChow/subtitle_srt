00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:07,420
=The Resilient Dr. Ling=

2
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:09,340
=Episode 4=

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,710
How dare you talk back to me.

4
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:13,510
- Master.
- I'm going to beat you up today.

5
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:14,800
- Master, please forgive her.
- Step aside.

6
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:15,960
- Mother.
- Today I must beat her.

7
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:16,800
Try it.

8
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:18,880
I am Princess Consort Chu.

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:20,670
If you hit me,

10
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,760
it's like you hit Prince Chu.

11
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:27,000
You are threatening me with Prince Chu.

12
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:29,440
He despises you.

13
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,870
Do you expect him to support you?

14
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:35,190
My identity was appointed
by His Majesty

15
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:36,550
and has been confirmed.

16
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:38,960
If you disobey the imperial edict,

17
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,670
then you're ignoring the royal dignity.

18
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:43,030
Do you dare?

19
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:48,470
Stop.

20
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,230
Father, as the director
in the Ministry of Rites,

21
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:56,000
don't you understand
the court etiquette?

22
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,030
What will you do

23
00:00:58,030 --> 00:00:59,320
if you contradict a princess consort?

24
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:11,670
I've just been a bit rude.

25
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:12,950
Please...

26
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:15,760
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

27
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,580
Mom, let's go.

28
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:28,500
Why bother arguing with your father
for my sake?

29
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:31,660
I am used to this kind of life.

30
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:35,740
Mom, you have been living
such an unhappy life.

31
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,500
Why don't you get divorced?

32
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,380
Don't say such things again.

33
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,020
After a woman gets married,
she follows her husband.

34
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:48,260
Even if you have a huge grievance,

35
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:50,500
you have to bear it.

36
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:52,420
Women are human beings too.

37
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,380
We have the right
to pursue happiness and joy.

38
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:57,060
The Three Obediences and Four Virtues

39
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,460
are all feudal dregs.

40
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:00,660
Don't say such things

41
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,460
in front of His Highness.

42
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:13,540
Your Highness, the spy sent a message.

43
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:15,220
There are clues to
the imperial exam fraud case.

44
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,560
Where is he?

45
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:17,700
The bamboo forest in the suburbs.

46
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,060
Your Highness.

47
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,700
I didn't let you down

48
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:25,820
and got the evidence.

49
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,620
Okay, thank you.

50
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:42,420
Be careful.

51
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:00,900
Take him away.

52
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:03,460
Go.

53
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:07,760
Get them.

54
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,740
Mother, do you remember

55
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,460
how I got the erythema

56
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,820
on my face?

57
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:26,780
Of course I remember.

58
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,620
When you were 14,

59
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:30,380
you had a fever
for three days and nights

60
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:31,860
and almost couldn't wake up.

61
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,380
I was so scared at that time.

62
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,060
Your eldest sister

63
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,100
didn't sleep for days,

64
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,020
preparing and giving you medicine,

65
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,820
and that's how you were saved.

66
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:45,260
It's a pity that since then,

67
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:48,060
there's the erythema on your face.

68
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,980
Mother.

69
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:53,660
These are the freshly made pastries.

70
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,740
You can chat while eating.

71
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:57,500
You came just in time.

72
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:59,340
I was just telling Ruojin

73
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,940
how you saved her life

74
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,580
five years ago.

75
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:06,180
There's no need for formalities with me.

76
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:07,980
My biological mother passed away early.

77
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,340
It was you who raised me up.

78
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,340
I will always remember this kindness.

79
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:20,140
I came today

80
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:23,020
to apologize to you.

81
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:26,380
It's all my fault
for not taking care of the shops,

82
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,780
causing a shortage of money
in the account,

83
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:30,710
so you got scolded by Father.

84
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:32,500
Silly child.

85
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,150
business comes with ups and downs.

86
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,110
It's completely normal.

87
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,150
Don't blame yourself too much.

88
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,340
I have an idea.

89
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:43,860
Now business has been slow.

90
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,660
If we can sell half of the shops

91
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:49,580
and use the money
to develop new business,

92
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:52,100
what do you think?

93
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:57,500
Inappropriate.

94
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:01,100
These shops are family heirlooms

95
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,580
with a long history

96
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:05,900
They can't be sold at will.

97
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,500
I was being careless.

98
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:16,780
The erythema on my face
was caused by black spiderwort.

99
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:19,820
It's Hu medicine
from the Western Regions,

100
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,140
very rare and precious.

101
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:23,660
Only the Royal Clinic sells it.

102
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:27,860
If I find the sales records,

103
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,980
I'll find the person who poisoned me.

104
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:34,020
(Royal Clinic)

105
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,260
(Royal Clinic)

106
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:38,180
Royal Clinic.

107
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,020
Huo Chong?

108
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:46,300
Doctor, hurry up!

109
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:57,980
Doctor, how is he doing?

110
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,260
I can't save him.

111
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:00,580
The arrow was poisoned

112
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:02,220
and struck close to his heart.

113
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,980
If I pull the arrow out,
he'll die for sure.

114
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,540
There's nothing I can do.

115
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:11,020
Doctor, please try again.

116
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:12,540
What if you can save him?

117
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,780
No one can save him now.

118
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:18,220
Shush.

119
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:40,260
It's you.

120
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:41,220
Let me go.

121
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,300
You're following me?

122
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:44,900
Who said I was following you?

123
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,620
I am here to see the doctor.

124
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:47,740
- Let go.
- Tell me.

125
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:48,740
Who sent you here?

126
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,420
Let me go.

127
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,180
Pupil dilation.

128
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:02,740
The toxin has invaded the bloodstream.

129
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:03,860
He needs immediate surgery.

130
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:08,860
I'm going to save him.

131
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:10,220
Evil woman.

132
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:12,900
Don't think that I don't
see through your game.

133
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,300
You want his life,

134
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,540
then I'll kill you first.

135
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,340
Let go.

136
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,390
Let go.

137
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:30,180
Your Highness.

138
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:31,540
Are you okay, Your Highness?

139
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:35,180
Your Highness.

140
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:37,100
Your Highness.

141
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:40,220
What have you done to me?

142
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,260
Nothing special.

143
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:43,980
I just injected you with poison.

144
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,020
First, there is paralysis of the limbs.

145
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,400
If you don't take the antidote in time,

146
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,340
you will rot and die.

147
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:53,660
You...

148
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:55,660
Let go. Let go.

149
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:00,100
How dare you
use poison on His Highness!

150
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,500
Hand over the antidote.

151
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:02,620
If you want the antidote,

152
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,500
do as I say.

153
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,100
Come and help.

154
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,220
Quickly.

155
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:16,220
Stop.

156
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:18,100
Stop it!

157
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:19,300
Knife.

158
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:22,380
Ling Ruojin.

159
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:25,660
I asked you to stop, do you hear me?

160
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:28,820
Tweezers.

161
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,300
Stop it, you evil woman.

162
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,380
If you keep torturing him,

163
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:33,540
I will tear you into pieces.

164
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:38,740
Wipe sweat.

165
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,020
Wipe my sweat.

166
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:45,580
That's enough.

167
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:47,420
This person is so noisy.

168
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:48,500
Don't touch him.

169
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,220
Plug his mouth.

170
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:52,940
Stop it.

171
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,500
I'm sorry, Your Highness.

172
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:04,980
Needle.

173
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,340
The surgery was very successful.

174
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,660
He will wake up soon.

175
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:32,060
Amazing, amazing!

176
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,300
You're like the medical fairy.

177
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:35,660
I'm impressed.

178
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,100
Doctor, please don't do it.

179
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:38,460
You flatter me.

180
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:40,380
Can we talk privately for a moment?

181
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:42,370
Okay.

182
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:44,620
Where is the antidote?

183
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:49,380
I only gave him a regular anesthetic.

184
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:50,980
Furthermore,

185
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,860
its effects have long worn off.

186
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:54,580
Get away.

187
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:00,540
Your Highness, Your Highness.

188
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,380
Your Highness.

189
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:10,380
Doctor, do you remember

190
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:12,220
someone buying black spiderwort
five years ago?

191
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:13,190
Black spiderwort?

192
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,060
Yes.

193
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,140
Black spiderwort is highly toxic

194
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,260
and quite expensive.

195
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,940
Basically no one buys it.

196
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:22,170
But five years ago,

197
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,540
someone did come to buy it.

198
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,060
Do you still remember
what that person looks like?

199
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,540
The woman was wearing a veil.

200
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:33,660
I couldn't see her face.

201
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,220
But I remember

202
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:42,260
she has a red mole on her left wrist.

203
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:54,860
It's all my fault
for not taking care of the shops,

204
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:57,140
causing a shortage of money
in the account,

205
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:59,420
so you got scolded by Father.

206
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:07,740
It was her.
