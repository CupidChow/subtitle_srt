You asked your person not your friend, right?

172
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,100

00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,940
Which game do you want to play?

192
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,100
I'll teach you.

193
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,020
Hmm?

194
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,520
Let's play skin to skin game.

195
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,040
Dino.

196
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,340
Or you want to play under blanket with me?

197
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,340
Have you ever played before?

198
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,140
Nope, what kind of game is that.

199
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,440
You have to try.

200
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,440
No. // Hmm?

201
00:09:58,980 --> 00:09:59,860
What?

202
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,040
Here he is.

203
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,860
You guys f*cking came here?

204
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,420
Well, we miss you.

205
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,980
Right, guys? // Yes.

206
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:21,680
I want to see your baby.

207
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,340
Hello.

208
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,660
Do you think this boy look familiar?

209
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,340
Yeah, like look at him.

210
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,480
Wow, you're such a nice host.

211
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,120
Serve yourselves.

212
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,600
Why the freshman is in your room?

213
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,680
It's personal.

214
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:51,520
What?

215
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,080
What if the seniors know?

216
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,880
Hey Please, don't be serious.

217
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,420
We're all friends.

218
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:00,560
How could they know if we don't talk about it.

219
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,980
What will happen if they know anyway?

220
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,320
Hey, easy bro.

221
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:09,780
Don't worry, let's have a drink.

222
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:13,740
And you, just like Korn said.

223
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:17,240
If you, Korn, and Bank don't talk about it,

224
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,240
then no one knows except us.

225
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,520
Right? // Yes.

226
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,100
Don't be serious.

227
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,360
Let's drink.

228
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:31,140
Here you are.

229
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,520
Are you feel uncomfortable?

230
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,420
No.

231
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,060
Stop looking at Please.

232
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,060
I'm just looking.

233
00:11:58,660 --> 00:11:59,360
I don't allow you to do that.

234
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,360
I allow you to look at me only.

235
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:04,820
Understand, freshman?

236
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,580
You don't need to sit close to me.

237
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,980
Why can't I?

238
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,500
Dino.

239
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,260
Isn't this too close?

240
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:22,860
No.

241
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,320
Aham!

242
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,480
Hey, Dino.

243
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:34,360
Since today you're a host,

244
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,860
let's us have a drink together.

245
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:38,340
But...

246
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:39,940
you have to pay for the drink too.

247
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:43,860
I bought a lot of it.

248
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:45,860
Yeah, we'll get drunk tonight.

249
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,820
Enough, it's on me.

250
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,620
Hey, let's share.

251
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,500
we drink together, we pay together.

252
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:55,420
Yeah, it's ok.

253
00:12:55,860 --> 00:13:00,800
Sugar daddy, I'll give you a massage.

254
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:01,980
You're being overreact.

255
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,900
Why are you laughing?

256
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:09,740
Because your friend called you sugar daddy.

257
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,120
You guys get out!

258
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,460
Dino.

259
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:18,820
What?

260
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,460
If you don't like being called sugar daddy, then I won't do it again.

261
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:23,460
Alright.

262
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:30,380
Hey, I think he doesn't upset.

263
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:32,380
You're Rak, right?

264
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:34,380
Yes.

265
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:36,820
I heard you drop out to study here.

266
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,380
Yes.

267
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:43,180
How long have you known Dino?

268
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,000
For awhile now.

269
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:53,140
Stop it, Korn.

270
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:54,680
Why?

271
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,340
I can't even get to know him?

272
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:57,220
Yes.

273
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,540
What? We just want to know him.

274
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,680
Never mind, let's drink.

275
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:09,200
You look pale after he scolded you.

276
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:19,280
Did you guys invite Sim?

277
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,520
I did, but he didn't come.

278
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:25,940
Dino.

279
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,680
About the roommate.

280
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,000
Right, Who is your roommate again?

281
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:34,360
His name is Chalarm.

282
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,040
Um.

283
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:43,420
Then can you ask him if he want to be a Faculty's star.

284
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:45,840
I'll let my friend contact him.

285
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,480
Ok, I'll ask him about it.

286
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:51,820
I agree.

287
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,480
Chalarm is good looking.

288
00:14:54,900 --> 00:15:00,600
But every time I look at him, I feel sleepy.

289
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:02,380
Like I'm suddenly sleepy.

290
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,560
He's handsome and tall but his face looks...

291
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,500
He's so sleepy.

292
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:12,640
And the day that he introduced himself.

293
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,640
Do you remember? // Yes.

294
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,360
I remember it too well.

295
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:19,200
It took him so long to introduce himself.

296
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:22,060
I think I can drive 3 times around our uni to wait for him.

297
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:24,880
What's your name? Chalarm.

298
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,840
I think you guys drink too much.

299
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,540
You're so drunk, look at you.

300
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,760
Do you want to buy some water?

301
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:41,020
I think we should buy some snacks too.

302
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,340
Do you want anything, Rak?

303
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,660
No, thank you.

304
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,660
Let's go.

305
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:48,660
Go, go.

306
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,060
I think it's time I have to go.

307
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,380
I'll take you home.

308
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:57,600
Let's go.

309
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,320
Go, go guys.

310
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:04,620
What should I eat?

311
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:08,380
You guys are so lightweight.

312
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:09,200
Where do we go next?

313
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,700
I'm gonna drink it all.

314
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:11,840
I'm watching you.

315
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,360
Stop talking and try to walk straight.

316
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,080
Yesterday, you threw up on the street.

317
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,300
I've never done that.

318
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,200
Yes, you have.

319
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,200
I forgot my car's key.

320
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,940
You guys stay with Rak, I'll be right back.

321
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:22,980
Alright.

322
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:23,760
See you.

323
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:27,360
We should wait at his car.

324
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,480
Let's go, boy.

325
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,020
Rak.

326
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:32,580
Can I talk to you?

327
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:33,660
Hmm?

328
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,200
Don't make my friend get in trouble.

329
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:44,340
Freshman have rules, so does SOTUS leader.

330
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:47,400
You'd better stay away from Dino.

331
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:51,980
Or you think being close with Dino will give you privilege.

332
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,420
Is this personal?

333
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,020
What do you mean?

334
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:01,840
I mean is this your from thought only?

335
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:06,760
You are such a narrow-minded.

336
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:10,480
The fact that I'm close with Dino,

337
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:14,480
it doesn't mean I want to get a privilege.

338
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:19,800
You're saying this like you don't know Dino.

339
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,980
How well do you think you know him then?

340
00:17:25,339 --> 00:17:27,579
Pretty well.

341
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:31,320
I have to know the person who flirt with me obviously.

342
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,120
Don't you think so too?

343
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,960
I don't know.

344
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:42,140
I just warn you.

345
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,320
Where are those guys?

346
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,380
Probably wait at the car.

347
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,560
Well then, I'll wait there too.

348
00:17:59,480 --> 00:17:59,960
Wait.

349
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:01,960
I have something to talk to you.

350
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,960
What happened?

351
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,120
Nothing, I just don't want you to leave.

352
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:09,920
How many stars in the jar?

353
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,120
20.

354
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,120
When will it full?

355
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:21,000
I don't know, I'll tell you once it's full.

356
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:23,080
How many stars I got today?

357
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,340
I won't tell you.

358
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,440
You can't do that.

359
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:28,740
How many?

360
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,080
I give you 5 stars.

361
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,080
Just 5?

362
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:35,800
10!

363
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,340
Don't bargain with me.

364
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,340
Just 5.

365
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,220
10, please.

366
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:43,540
5 stars for the feeling you have for me.

367
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:49,880
Another 5 for my feeling for you.

368
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,060
I'm leaving.

369
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,000
How are you, son?

370
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:09,000
I'm good, dad.

371
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:13,040
How's the new university?

372
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,420
It's nice.

373
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,760
Focus on your study.

374
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,800
What are you doing?

375
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:23,980
Ah, I'm about to go eat something.

376
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:26,320
Because I have cheering practice in the evening.

377
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,020
Please take care of yourself.

378
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,920
And don't forget to call me.

379
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:35,880
Thank you.

380
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:51,880
[Calling Dino.]

381
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,040
[Calling Mhee.]

382
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,180
Hello, Rak?

383
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,320
Hello, Mhee.

384
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:15,820
Are you busy?

385
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:17,820
I've just finished with my bar.

386
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:18,560
What's wrong?

387
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,060
Can you go eat out with me?

388
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,180
Ok, where are you?

389
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,000
At science building gate.

390
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:27,320
I'll pick you up.

391
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:28,940
Yes.

392
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,260
Hello, Dino.

393
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,180
Where are you?

394
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:45,280
I'm walking to science building gate.

395
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,160
I'll pick you up.

396
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,840
What about Mhee.

397
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:51,240
I don't care, come with me.

398
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,760
Don't make me angrier.

399
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:53,760
Hurry up.

400
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,940
Are you angry at me?

401
00:20:58,860 --> 00:20:59,740
You figure it out.

402
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:14,700
Rak!

403
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,160
Come here!

404
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,980
What are you angry at?

405
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,120
I'm angry at you.

406
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,180
Then, I'll leave.

407
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,800
Who allow you? // Ouch.

408
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,300
I'm gonna remove all the stars.

409
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,080
Don't you dare.

410
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,100
You are so mean.

411
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:56,700
Are you hurt?

412
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,160
Do you even care?

413
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,520
Well, I'm sorry.

414
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,220
I already asked you if you want to eat and you said no.

415
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,480
But when I went to sleep, you asked Mhee to eat out with you.

416
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:11,480
Don't you think I should be mad?

417
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:18,920
I said I wasn't hungry yet.

418
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,260
So, now you're hungry?

419
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,360
Yes.

420
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:28,800
If you didn't say you were tired, I would have called you.

421
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,220
I wouldn't have called Mhee.

422
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:35,760
I was worry about you, I want you to rest.

423
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:39,800
What?

424
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,180
Don't smile at me.

425
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,180
I'm gonna throw away the paper star jar.

426
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:50,280
Are you mad, rabbit?

427
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:53,200
Hmm, rabbit?

428
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:54,480
What?

429
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:56,480
I'm Rak, not rabbit.

430
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,520
You seems mad.

431
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:07,180
Well, I'm sorry I didn't know you were worry about me.

432
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:13,960
Don't try acting nice.

433
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:19,840
I'm trying to make up.

434
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,080
Does it hurt?

435
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,040
Does it?

436
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:32,600
If I get bruises, I'll throw the star jar away.

437
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,340
Will I get to date you in this life?

438
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,100
I don't care.

439
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,540
Really?

440
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:48,560
You don't?

441
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:52,000
You're in the wrong. Don't be dramatic.

442
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:55,560
I promised next time I'll be more patient.

443
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:01,460
Fine. Keep your promise.

444
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,320
Mhm. Will do.

445
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:05,980
I'll drop you off this evening

446
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,600
since I also have to do SOTUS.

447
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,500
And I'm the leader at that.

448
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:12,680
There's no escape for you.

449
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,460
What are you gonna do?

450
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,580
Can I say it out loud?

451
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,100
Hm?

452
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,320
Dino.

453
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,840
What do you want me to do?

454
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,100
Dino!

455
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:27,840
Wanna know?

456
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:30,640
I'mma tell you.

457
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,220
Nahh, I gotta go.

458
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:36,820
Where are you going? I'm giving you a ride.

459
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:42,060
Rak.

460
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:42,940
Huh?

461
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,900
I want to pee. I'll go to the bathroom.

462
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,900
Um. // Just a moment.

463
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:48,500
Um.

464
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:49,900
I'll wait.

465
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,520
Oh, why don't you go to the Cheer room?

466
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:10,480
I'm waiting for my friend. He's in the bathroom.

467
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:11,540
Ah.

468
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,520
Anyway, why do you look so bored?

469
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:17,920
Me?

470
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:20,260
Yes, you.

471
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,460
It's only the two of us here.

472
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,580
I'm not bored, just sleepy.

473
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:31,000
You're sleepy?

474
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:32,520
Oh!

475
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:35,000
I have wet wipes. Do you want some?

476
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,740
Let me have one.

477
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:40,880
Here.

478
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,120
Thank you.

479
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:44,840
Wipe your face to be fresh.

480
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:58,500
Chalarm.

481
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:00,660
Use this to wipe your face

482
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,520
so you won't be sleepy.

483
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,480
Thanks. // Um.

484
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:16,560
Are you two... close?

485
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:20,160
Oh, yes. We're roommates.

486
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:21,540
Ah, roommate it is.

487
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,940
I wanna ask ever since you went out of the Cheer room.

488
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:29,040
So... what's his name again?

489
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,100
Chalarm.

490
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:40,920
What are you standing here for?

491
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:44,140
Er... I took them to the bathroom.

492
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:47,100
Get back in if you're done.

493
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:50,200
These two don't even have name tags.

494
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:52,300
Don't you realize what time it is?

495
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,440
Do I need to tell you everything?

496
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:57,060
I'm so sorry.

497
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,520
I'll quickly bring them inside.

498
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:01,380
You just came at the right moment.

499
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,700
Hurry up.

500
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:11,160
Got it, freshman?

501
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:21,480
Wait a second. I'll give you the name tag.

502
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:26,320
This is for Chalarm.

503
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:29,520
And this is for Rak.

504
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,540
It sounds like a female name.

505
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,980
Let me help. // No, I'll do it.

506
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,240
Er, if you have anything,

507
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,320
you can always ask me.

508
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:41,960
I'm Temp.

509
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,620
Talk to you later.

510
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,880
Let's go. That's the room.

511
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:51,120
Let's go, Chalarm.

512
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:02,460
Chalarm. // Hm?

513
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:04,620
Why don't we take the elevator?

514
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:08,360
There's global warming. // It's right there.

515
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:11,460
But taking the stairs is eco friendly. // Boo!

516
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:16,440
I was just ordered to squat 10 times, so I'm aching all over.

517
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:22,300
My legs really hurt, you see? I might even get bruises.

518
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:24,900
Take a look! // Isn't it just 10 times?

519
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:30,500
Yes, Chalarm, I'm in great pain.

520
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:37,480
Chalarm, can you... give me a piggy back ride?

521
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,080
Eh. It's heavy.

522
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:43,940
Please, Chalarm. Pretty please?

523
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:44,960
But you're heavy.

524
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,780
Woah, that's rude!

525
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:50,320
I'm not that heavy.

526
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,880
Look at me. I'm small.

527
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:56,400
I'm much smaller than you, and you look so strong.

528
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,900
See? You have a strong build!

529
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,500
I'm very tiny.

530
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,980
Please?

531
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:03,220
Tiny?

532
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:05,940
Mhm, I'm quite weak.

533
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:09,400
Please let me ride your back.

534
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:11,640
Eh. // Please, please?

535
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,480
You're the best, Chalarm!

536
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,600
Chalarm.

537
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:23,580
I'm kidding. I can walk by myself.

538
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,460
Our room is just one floor ahead.

539
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:28,500
I also have legs, you see?

540
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:31,660
Just like you, I can walk on my own.

541
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:34,780
Okay.

542
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,560
I'm right outside your dorm.

543
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:43,160
Come here quickly. Let's have dinner together.

544
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,560
Yes, Dino.

545
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:52,220
Chalarm.

546
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:55,120
I'm going to have dinner with Dino.

547
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,600
Can you buy me something?

548
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,180
Of course, what do you want?

549
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,400
Omelette.

550
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:06,160
Sure, I'll get it for you.

551
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:07,620
Thank you.

552
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:10,100
Thanks! I gotta go.

553
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:11,720
Aren't your legs hurt?

554
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,360
It gets better.

555
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:17,780
Damn.

556
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,700
His man came, and he's as fast as a lightning.

557
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,020
Can you believe it?

558
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:31,000
Do freshmen like to keep name tags?

559
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,340
I have to check in at the dorm when I'm back.

560
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:37,520
No need.

561
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,240
I let Suea take care of it.

562
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:43,620
So... what are we gonna do?

563
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,140
We're gonna eat out.

564
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:48,040
Um, I haven't eaten yet.

565
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:49,880
I'm getting hungry.

566
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:50,900
Hm.

567
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:54,400
What were you doing with Temp earlier?

568
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:57,240
Oh.

569
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,380
I went to the bathroom.

570
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,860
But he asked your name.

571
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:04,240
You heard that?

572
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:05,760
No doubt.

573
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:09,320
When he gave you that look, I wanted to punch him.

574
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,140
And I'll tell him you're mine.

575
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:14,820
How possessive.

576
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:16,900
That's because I like you!

577
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,860
I told you...

578
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:22,320
I'm the only one who could flirt with you.

579
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:26,160
If someone wants to get in the way, come at me.

580
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:30,600
But you promised you'll be more patient.

581
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:33,980
Well, it applies only for you.

582
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:37,220
I'll listen to you first. Like this time.

583
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:41,480
But I don't care about anyone else.

584
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,280
Anyway, where are we going?

585
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,520
We'll be eating something at Central World.

586
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,160
Huh?

587
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,240
Central World?

588
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,520
That's right. Why? Are you excited?

589
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:02,640
Hm, there are so many options for food.

590
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:04,800
Let's go.

591
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:07,300
Yes.

592
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:15,340
You took me out quite far today.

593
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:18,860
The mood is great, so I wanna come with you.

594
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,420
So...

595
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,260
How was your day? How's the cheering situation?

596
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:30,620
It's good, unlike last year.

597
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,480
They were stubborn like a mule.

598
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:38,800
Someone said you're handsome.

599
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:40,340
What do you think?

600
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,760
Same as you.

601
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:48,160
I should get around 10 paper stars then.

602
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:51,440
Just 2 will do. You've worn me out today.

603
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:55,040
It's my job, so it's irrelevant.

604
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,620
And your reason is irrelevant, too!

605
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:01,860
If you talked back, I'm gonna kiss you. Wanna try?

606
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:07,160
Who is the faculty's star last year?

607
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:09,380
Maybe Than.

608
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,720
I didn't pay attention.

609
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:13,780
Well... how about your year?

610
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:16,420
It's Aong, but he dropped out.

611
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:24,220
Dino. // Hm?

612
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:28,360
Do we have any field trips?

613
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,200
There's none because we got problems last year.

614
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:33,400
So the chancellor canceled it.

615
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,260
Why? You wanna go on a trip?

616
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:38,700
Hm?

617
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:39,960
The thing is...

618
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,760
after SOTUS ends, I'll work at Mhee's bar.

619
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:45,360
That's great.

620
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,200
It's easy for me to look after you.

621
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,740
Just stay close to me.

622
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:52,800
[When will you be my lover?]

623
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:55,500
[I'm counting the days until I can be yours]

624
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,680
I can take care of myself.

625
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:58,840
I said I'll do it.

626
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:00,620
You sure like to talk back.

627
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,640
Should I kiss you?

628
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,380
There are a lot of people here.

629
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:05,800
Fear not.

630
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:07,300
They don't care about us.

631
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,040
They will look...

632
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,040
Where?

633
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:11,800
Hm?

634
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,239
Dino!

635
00:34:13,739 --> 00:34:14,940
No one's paying attention.

636
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,139
Just smile if you want to.

637
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:18,920
It relieves my fatigue.

638
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:24,280
[and yearn for you every day]

639
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:44,340
Rak.

640
00:34:45,179 --> 00:34:45,540
Hm?

641
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:47,540
You arrived quite fast.

642
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:50,460
It's the same as usual.

643
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:51,719
And you, Suea?

644
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,600
I don't normally see you.

645
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:55,040
Hm?

646
00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:00,200
I joined every day, you just didn't notice.

647
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,540
Is that so? // Um.

648
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:09,140
So... what's so good about faculty of Communication Arts?

649
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,600
You see...

650
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:13,520
There's

651
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,520
something cute.

652
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:19,020
Like so f*cking cute

653
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,580
that I have to look for it every day.

654
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:31,640
Er... // Hey, Rak!

655
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:34,700
You know him?

656
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:39,000
It's Temp. He always greets me like this.

657
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:41,780
Listen.

658
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,960
Stay away from him.

659
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:48,800
This kind of person is a player.

660
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:49,660
You know?

661
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:52,040
And you're his type.

662
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:56,540
Woah.

663
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:58,880
You arrived quickly again.

664
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,160
Should I give you a reward?

665
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:02,880
Isn't it normal?

666
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:06,260
And please... keep your reward.

667
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:08,640
I don't wanna trouble you.

668
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:12,640
For Rak,

669
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,640
it's never a trouble.

670
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,840
I'm willing.

671
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:17,780
Ahem!

672
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:21,540
Seems like some ass wants to be kicked.

673
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:22,840
Hey, Suea!

674
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,040
Are you Suea?

675
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:26,700
Or are you searching for trouble?

676
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:30,320
Huh?

677
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:32,640
What?

678
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:34,540
Were you talking to me?

679
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:35,580
Yeah.

680
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:38,560
Sorry, man.

681
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:42,560
I don't understand dog language.

682
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:45,620
You wanna fight?

683
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:48,600
Get lost! Don't you dare mess with Rak.

684
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,660
If his man comes at you, don't say I didn't warn you.

685
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:54,600
F*ck off.

686
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:56,600
Will you?

687
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:58,000
Then,

688
00:36:58,700 --> 00:36:59,880
see you later.

689
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:03,920
You too. // Darn it! That jerk took my water!

690
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:08,260
And why are you laughing?! You also have to go!

691
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:08,980
I'll go first.

692
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:10,480
If you don't wanna be late, scram!

693
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:13,540
Ha!

694
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,020
Why do you stay up late tonight?

695
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:24,860
I'm not done with work.

696
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:26,420
There's still a lot to do.

697
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:28,560
Which assignment is it?

698
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,520
Oh! Do you wanna see mine?

699
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,160
It's done.

700
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:37,360
If you finish early, you can quickly go to bed.

701
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:39,600
Um.

702
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,080
Here.

703
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,860
Just keep it with you.

704
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,120
Thank you.

705
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:07,520
Are you gonna sleep now?

706
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,540
I'm doing homework.

707
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,060
Good. Have you eaten yet?

708
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,360
Throw it away.

709
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:35,420
But... I'm hungry.

710
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:39,020
Come downstairs 10 minutes later.

711
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,460
Be quick, babe.

712
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,160
Chalarm.

713
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:49,500
Huh? // I'll be right back.

714
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:52,040
Hm.

715
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:03,400
At this rate...

716
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,460
I guess he won't get to eat.

717
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,240
All of this is for you.

718
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:24,240
Do you want anything else?

719
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:26,980
It's more than enough.

720
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,600
Why did you buy so many?

721
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:30,740
My rabbit has a big appetite.

722
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,160
I'm not a rabbit.

723
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,080
Are you really not? Hm?

724
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:39,660
When did I say that the rabbit is you?

725
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,080
Are you mine?

726
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:43,360
Dino.

727
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:44,700
How cheeky!

728
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:47,860
Look. Your hair is a mess.

729
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Don't mess it up any further.

730
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:53,440
It's kinda cute.

731
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:54,360
Eh?

732
00:39:56,580 --> 00:40:00,300
You know? You made me wear this to Mhee's bar.

733
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:03,200
It's clearly a pajamas.

734
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:04,980
I'm so embarrassed.

735
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:06,840
You don't have to look good for anyone else.

736
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:09,680
Just look good... only for me.

737
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,340
Dino! You...

738
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:13,920
Why?

739
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:17,020
You make me feel shy.

740
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:18,700
Why so?

741
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:19,380
Hm?

742
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,280
What made you so shy? Hm?

743
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,080
Dinooo.

744
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:23,740
What?

745
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:26,360
Pucker up like this... you love me, right?

746
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:30,720
Say you love me. Love, love, love.

747
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:33,720
Come on. Let's get going.

748
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:34,500
Yeah.

749
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:44,440
If it's not enough, take mine.

750
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:47,640
It's enough.

751
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:50,460
Why don't you eat? You still have a lot left.

752
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:51,420
I'm full.

753
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,800
Hm? But you ate so little?

754
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:54,360
Um.

755
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:02,260
Is it tasty?

756
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,060
This shop is a famous one.

757
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:09,600
Then... if you don't want it, can I have yours?

758
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:10,400
Sure thing.

759
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:15,300
I'll finish mine first. // Go ahead.

760
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,700
Don't rush.

761
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:35,120
What are you eating?

762
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,940
This is a bar, not a congee shop.

763
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,660
Why are you eating it here?

764
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:44,820
We don't wanna go back yet, and I have a meeting to attend later.

765
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:47,720
What meeting?

766
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:53,200
Did I tell you guys to hold one?

767
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,320
I don't know either.

768
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:57,960
But I was called.

769
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,640
Er... let me check it out.

770
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:02,460
What meeting is it?

771
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:08,440
You'll attend a meeting?

772
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:10,060
Not sure.

773
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:12,320
I'll send you back first.

774
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:16,600
Actually, you don't have to.

775
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:19,520
My dad said he'll come.

776
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:22,940
Um, okay.

777
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:25,940
Um.

778
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:29,600
Why are you making that face?

779
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:36,360
What kind of face?

780
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,460
A seductive one.

781
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,600
Hey, you're horny.

782
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:46,800
I guess you're right.

783
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:51,380
Just seeing you... can turn me on.

784
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:55,940
Change of plan. Wanna sleep at my place tonight?

785
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:59,120
What are you talking about?!

786
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:01,200
Dad is gonna hit me.

787
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:04,520
He'll hit you? But you're all grown up.

788
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:09,300
Because he said he'll take me home today.

789
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:10,700
Okay.

790
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:12,100
Then eat.

791
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,940
You should eat more.

792
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,080
Let me feed you. How's that?

793
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:19,720
You ate so little, unlike me.

794
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:27,720
Hello dad.

795
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:31,540
Hello dad!

796
00:43:57,420 --> 00:44:00,140
[When will you be my lover?]

00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:02,840

Dinosaur Love's uncut version is only available at IQIYI and iQ.com

799
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:11,420
[I’m not imagining things]

800
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:16,200
[You're talented at making a man think about you]

801
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:20,300
[and yearn for you every day]

802
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:44,420
[When will you be my lover?]

803
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:47,120
[I'm counting the days until I can be yours]

804
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:49,260
[I smile every time we meet]

805
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:52,400
[And you feel the same way]

806
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:54,640
The most important things in my life?

807
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:56,720
Family,

808
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:58,440
partner,

809
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:00,900
and friends.

810
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:03,780
Well, Sim got out of that circle.

811
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:06,640
I'm not that mad at him

812
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:08,640
for causing me to be beaten.

813
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:13,500
I just want him to let me know if he's having problems.

814
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:16,300
I really can't punch him.

815
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:18,800
About Rak?

816
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:22,300
He successfully attended my university.

817
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:26,000
And I'm the SOTUS leader this year.

818
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:28,340
Well,

819
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:32,460
there's a rule that SOTUS leader can't flirt with freshmen.

820
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:35,000
Do you think I'm bothered?

821
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:36,580
Nah.

822
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:38,900
I someone wants to be nosy,

823
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:40,800
do it if you dare.

824
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:48,940
Huh?

825
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:51,680
I know it from you just now.

826
00:45:52,340 --> 00:45:54,300
Is he alright?

827
00:45:55,940 --> 00:45:57,280
Ah, Dino?

828
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:01,740
Why are you with him?

829
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:03,280
Isn't that a freshman?

830
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:05,060
Are you close?
