1
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:06,620
Are you alright?

2
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:08,180
Mhm.

3
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:14,560
Don't cry.

4
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:19,240
Who's behind you? Looks so familiar.

5
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,900
Looks like a freshman.

6
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,540
Answer me.

7
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:24,980
Who is he?

8
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:26,820
Are you two close?

9
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,700
Dino, Rak, have you waited long?

10
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,080
Hello.

11
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,040
Did you come with them?

12
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:38,850
Actually, it's our businesses.

13
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:41,550
But it's not a secret if you want to know.

14
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:42,990
We're discussing about the Faculty's star.

15
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:45,670
Faculty's star? This boy?

16
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:47,850
Are you kidding me?

17
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,680
Rak and Chalarm are friends.

18
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,880
We wanted Chalarm to participate but he denied.

19
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,680
Do you have a crush on Dino?

20
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:04,660
I need to go I have to attend the cheering practice.

21
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:07,100
Wait!

22
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:12,240
Dino has never brought anyone to his room.

23
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,500
He has never been in love.

24
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:17,800
And he has never had a crush on anyone.

25
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:28,500
I'm sorry for saying bad things to you on that night.

26
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:32,580
It's ok.

27
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:40,200
We're giving you the chance to choose who you wanna team up with.

28
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:43,900
You'll give me the answer on the count of three.

00:01:44,539 --> 00:01:45,320

00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,320

32
00:01:50,259 --> 00:01:51,200
I choose Dino.

33
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:54,880

34
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:01,440

Ha, I'm heartbroken.

41
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,660

42

43
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,180

45

00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,500

[but I'm afraid of being hurt]

00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,420
[Since I don't know what you truly feel]

00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:21,600
Dino!

104
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,240
Let's take a video.

105
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,500
I want to keep this moment.

106
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,660
What? // And I'll post it on social media.

107
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,480
Fine, go ahead.

108
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,300
I'm not good at social media.

109
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,180
Hahaha.

110
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,500
You're such a tease.

111
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:40,940
How was today?

112
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:45,980
I have so much fun. It's amazing!

113
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,200
Are you happy?

114
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,580
Very much.

115
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,100
Anywhere else you wanna go?

116
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:57,200
I wanna go up the mountain.

117
00:06:58,540 --> 00:06:59,960
Alright, I'll take you there.

118
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:01,260
Really?

119
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,380
You're the best!

120
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:08,260
How about you?

121
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:11,240
Anywhere is fine when I'm with you.

122
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,660
Then I'll go to the sea.

123
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,860
What sea? Are you messing with me?

124
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:20,960
Noo.

125
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,740
You're not gonna buy souvenirs, are you?

126
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:32,400
If you buy one more thing, your bag will be overweight.

127
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:35,920
Then the airport staff won't let you pass.

128
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,860
Do you understand?

129
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,760
I knoww.

130
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,680
Just one nod is enough

131
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,620
but you're literally bugging me.

132
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,200
I'm not!

133
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,740
I just nodded in understanding.

134
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,440
Uh.

135
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,520
Let's get going.

136
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,660
Can you hold my hands instead of filming?

137
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:04,300
But I want to keep this moment!

138
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,240
As memory? // That we've been here.

139
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:09,560
Let's go.

140
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,960
Turn off the camera.

141
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:19,280
[When will you be my lover?]

142
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,360
[I'm counting the days until I can be yours]

143
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,140
Dino.

144
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,960
It's so beautiful.

145
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,960
My house doesn't have something like this.

146
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,860
It's not the time for this. Let's go to bed.

147
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,600
Turn around.

148
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:52,140
Look at your hair...

149
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,140
it's all wet.

150
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,300
You're like a child.

151
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:00,660
Thanks.

152
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:10,180
Go to bed.

153
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,040
Ok, I will.

154
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:18,620
Come on.

155
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:25,340
Dino.

156
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,820
Are you sleeping?

157
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,000
Why did you go to sleep so early?

158
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:31,660
Not yet.

159
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:37,460
Is it cold on the mountain tops?

160
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,660
Hm, maybe.

161
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,360
Is it freezing?

162
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,240
Yes. Go to sleep, Rak.

163
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,360
Dino.

164
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:51,980
What's with you?

165
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,040
I can't sleep.

166
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:01,780
Dino.

167
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:03,060
Hm?

168
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,600
I heard something.

169
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,120
What is it?

170
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:10,400
Er...

171
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,000
I don't know.

172
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,920
Can I sleep with you?

173
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,360
Do as you want.

174
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,360
It's a pity I booked 2 rooms.

175
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,800
Don't bring the pillow and blanket.

176
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:26,100
Alright.

177
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,020
Get some sleep.

178
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:56,080
Argh! Dino!

179
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:58,880
Dino.

180
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:03,320
I heard it again. // Here it comes! // Dino!

181
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,960
It's here! // Dino!

182
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:12,040
What is that sound? // I'm just kidding.

183
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:14,500
Sleep.

184
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:30,680
[The second we meet]

185
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,460
[Is always special]

186
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,540
[Thank you for coming into my life]

187
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:44,500
[and changing my world]

188
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:49,600
[Wherever I go, you're by my side]

189
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,160
[Monday to Saturday]

190
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,000
[I have you all days]

191
00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:01,160
[And my loneliness has faded away]

192
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,640
Dino!

193
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,960
This place is breathtaking..

194
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:11,360
Um. // And the atmosphere is nice.

195
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:14,000
It is.

196
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,780
Are you tired?

197
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,140
Huh?

198
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,120
Tired of what?

199
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,040
Running in my heart all day.

200
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:30,760
Why are you laughing?

201
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,420
Well, I'm not that tired.

202
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:38,900
My boyfriend can't get tired easily.

203
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,160
Who is gonna be your boyfriend?

204
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,040
Fine.

205
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:48,700
Is it worth it?

206
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:53,760
Kind of. The process is just too exhausting.

207
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:57,520
Rak.

208
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:58,260
Huh?

209
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,860
Can you help me take a look at my bag?

210
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:08,040
There's something in it. Quickly!

211
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,480
Alright. I'll help you.

212
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:17,140
[The second I saw you]

213
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:17,720
Gear?

214
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,180
You're giving it to me?

215
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:23,860
[You stole my heart]

216
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,620
Um.

217
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,980
It's very important to me.

218
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:29,140
[The second we meet]

219
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:30,420
[Is always special]

220
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:32,020
I also have something for you.

221
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:34,000
What?

222
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,640
You bring it here with you?

223
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,620
The last one and it'll be full.

224
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:59,040
The jar is full...

225
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:02,960
so can you be mine?

226
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,680
I...

227
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,360
You only have one answer.

228
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:11,820
"Yes."

229
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:15,780
[I’m not imagining things]

230
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:20,680
[You're talented at making a man think about you]

231
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:24,940
[and yearn for you every day]

232
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:26,700
Yes.

233
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,080
Dino.

234
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:39,960
[What exactly is love at first sight?]

235
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:43,740
[Are you the one who opened my mind?]

236
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:46,620
[You made me feel different]

237
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:54,460
[From that day, I've realized,]

238
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:59,040
[It's not a dream.]

239
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,660
[I realized it when I saw you]

240
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:30,920
Dino.

241
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,860
Where are you going to sleep?

242
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:35,480
Hm?

243
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,060
And...

244
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:40,580
Why are you staring at me?

245
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,820
I want to look since my boyfriend is cute.

246
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,340
You're letting me choose the bed?

247
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:48,780
Um.

248
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,660
Are you sure that...

249
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:54,520
you won't come to sleep with me tonight?

250
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:56,140
Hm?

251
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:57,640
Tell me?

252
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,400
Answer me.

253
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,740
Er... no comment.

254
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:03,480
Then can I sleep with you?

255
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:04,880
Dino.

256
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,320
Answer me.

257
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,840
Will you?

258
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:08,620
Hm?

259
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:11,240
Don't wanna. // Come on.

260
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,080
Your body is big, so there isn't enough room.

261
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:16,220
Something else is big too.

262
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:18,240
Wanna try?

263
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:20,440
Dino!

264
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:27,820
Are you cold?

265
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:30,680
Um.

266
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:34,860
Better?

267
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,280
I guess?

268
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,140
Can we stay like this all night?

269
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:48,700
Dino.

270
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,480
I really love this place.

271
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,820
You're smiling from ear to ear.

272
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:05,560
Are you crazy?

273
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,880
As crazy as you who are my boyfriend.

274
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,940
Now you dare to argue with me?

275
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:11,500
Huh?

276
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,819
Dino!

277
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,000
I'm going inside.

278
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,280
Is it me or my shampoo stinks?

279
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:26,319
Is that so?

280
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,700
Let me smell it.

281
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:34,240
Hm.

282
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,700
It smells good.

283
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,780
Not stinky at all.

284
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:38,900
Really?

285
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:40,500
It's kinda too strong

286
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,500
My old one is much better.

287
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:43,700
Hm.

288
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:45,780
I think it's nice.

289
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,940
And it suits you.

290
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:50,120
Um.

291
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,600
It's getting late. Go to bed.

292
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,220
It's not late.

293
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:58,400
This is only 10 p.m.

294
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:01,440
10 p.m. is late for me.

295
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:03,840
Dino.

296
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,120
You're speaking like my dad.

297
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,120
Me as your daddy?

298
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,340
That's cheeky.

299
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:25,120
Dino.

300
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:30,640
Dino.

301
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,060
I know what you mean.

302
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,480
Good boy. Let me reward you.

303
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:42,760
Why?

304
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,920
Don't you like it?

305
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:46,700
Mek!

306
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,040
Dino.

307
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,420
Dino.

308
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:56,960
I'm sorry.

309
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,020
I'm still... not ready.

310
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:13,380
Don't be sorry for what you're afraid of.

311
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:15,960
It's me who needs to apologize.

312
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,560
I've waited for you to be my boyfriend.

313
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:22,280
So I have no problem waiting a little more.

314
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:25,800
Give me a hug.

315
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,360
Hm? // Let's watch TV.

316
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,980
It's not fun if we don't focus.

317
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,740
Playing with you is much more fun.

318
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,620
So hot. // Um.

319
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:10,340
What's wrong? You look anxious.

320
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:14,000
Me?

321
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:15,520
Um, what's on your mind?

322
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:18,500
Nothing.

323
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,420
Nonsense. Say it.

324
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:24,040
It's nothing.

325
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,140
Will you say it yourself...

326
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:28,740
or should I open your mouth?

327
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:29,500
Say it.

328
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:32,800
Dinoo. // Tell me.

329
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:36,860
I haven't finish my assignment.

330
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,920
So I'm worried I won't finish it on time.

331
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,320
It's not what you think.

332
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:46,440
And I have a morning class tomorrow.

333
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:49,140
I might not have time to sleep tonight.

334
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:52,860
Why didn't you finish it before we went to Chiang Mai?

335
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:56,240
I thought I could finish it on time.

336
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,560
Did you finish it?

337
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,240
No.

338
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:00,920
Why didn't you tell me?

339
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,840
If you had told me this morning, I would have given you a ride.

340
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,260
It's only a one-hour ride.

341
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:08,740
If I tell you, you will act like this.

342
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,680
Then wait for me here.

343
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:12,840
I'll take you to your dorm.

344
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,300
Dino.

345
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:18,060
What?

346
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,940
Can I stay with you?

347
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:25,940
Fine.

348
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:30,440
Wait, I think my room isn't available.

349
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,780
Please, let me stay with you.

350
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:37,500
It's unavailable.

351
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:39,820
Please let me stay.

352
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,740
Please, Dino.

353
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:44,840
Let me stay with you, please.

354
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:45,720
No.

355
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,260
Please, let me stay here.

356
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,260
Alright.

357
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,480
You teased me a lot.

358
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,360
Because I want to stay with you.

359
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,360
Fine.

360
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,800
You're so cute.

361
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:03,940
Why are you smiling?

362
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:07,440
When you stressed, your face looks like this.

363
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,180
Like what?

364
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,460
Like this.

365
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:17,980
Let's drink this to freshen up.

366
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:23,440
So fresh!

367
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,840
Let me try.

368
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:33,300
It really freshen up.

369
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:35,740
Absolutely!

370
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:38,360
Then you drink it one more time.

371
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:39,720
Here you are.

372
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:40,580
Ok.

373
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,560
So fresh!

374
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:49,120
They would love to let you be their presenter.

375
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,500
It's you.

376
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:53,140
Me what?

377
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:54,940
It's you.

378
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:58,700
I think I know what's fresher than the drink.

379
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,680
Hey, Dino.

380
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,300
Hello.

381
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,080
Hi.

382
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:22,520
Chalarm.

383
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:24,920
Your hair color?

384
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:29,080
How's it?

385
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:30,380
Am I cool?

386
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,340
Is it good?

387
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:38,620
Stop looking at him.

388
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,840
Start doing your work.

389
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,060
Do you have any souvenirs for me?

390
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,160
I bought pork rinds

391
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,160
and green chili dip.

392
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:50,760
Don't you have omelette?

393
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,100
No.

394
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,140
Then I won't eat it.

395
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:01,100
Here.

396
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:02,080
Your bag.

397
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:11,640
Where did you dye your hair?

398
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:14,760
A barber behind our college.

399
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:16,720
I can't remember the name.

400
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,580
You look good on this color.

401
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,200
I know.

402
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:22,920
Start working!

403
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,580
Stop complimenting him.

404
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,200
Go do your work.

405
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,540
Stop looking at him.

406
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,120
When will you leave?

407
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,660
I won't, I'll stay here.

408
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:46,780
Ok.

409
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:57,360
What? You hungry again?

410
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:58,760
I'm hungry.

411
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,580
I want to eat omelette.

412
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,400
Omelette, right?

413
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,600
Then, hold on.

414
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,180
Rak's here.

415
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,540
Dino.

416
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,800
Your hair color?

417
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,560
Hi.

418
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:41,860
His hair color!

419
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:46,060
Did he dye his hair for me?

420
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:48,820
I was annoyed that you always compliment Chalarm's hair.

421
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,100
After I did it, I'm still annoyed

422
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:52,500
everyone keeps looking.

423
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:57,260
Get used to it, my friend is handsome.

424
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:00,660
He steals my aura when I walk beside him.

425
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:05,420
It's because you up until 4 a.m. playing game with me.

426
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:08,700
Dino goes to bed at 9 p.m.

427
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,680
He goes to sleep after calling his boyfriend.

428
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:15,640
Do you guys know that me and Dino...

429
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:17,640
They like to know my business.

430
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:20,600
Do you think it suits me?

431
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:22,220
Well...

432
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:26,220
Rak.

433
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,040
Hey!

434
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,480
Do you think it's ok?

435
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,880
It really suits you.

436
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,880
Why are you guys laughing?

437
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,260
"It really suits you"

438
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,360
So, the barber shop is fine.

439
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,940
It won't get burned by you then.

440
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:42,400
I'll burn your face first.

441
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,980
Calm down, I'm Top, your friend.

442
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:47,040
I used to play game with you.

443
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:53,860
Hey, guys.

444
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:55,860
I left my wallet at my car.

445
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:00,380
I'll go with you.

446
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:03,420
Ok.

447
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:10,320
You keep staring at me.

448
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:13,240
This color really suits you.

449
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,340
Do you like it?

450
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:16,140
Yes.

451
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,140
You mean my hair?

452
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,580
Er..well..yes.

453
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,040
Hey, watch out!

454
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:57,180
Rak!

455
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:01,220
Are you hurt? / Ouch.

456
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:01,980
Don't touch it.

457
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,480
I'm sorry. Are you alright?

458
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:10,740
It's ok.

459
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,220
You don't have to say sorry.

460
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,400
I'm fine.

461
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,600
Are you alright?

462
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:19,200
I'm sorry. I can take you to the hospital.

463
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,380
This is my first time skateboarding.

464
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:22,980
So you hit him?

465
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,360
Luckily, you didn't lose your shoes.

466
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:30,680
This is Kim&Co, a very good pair of shoes.

467
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,120
And they're so comfy.

468
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:36,640
What a tie-in ads!

469
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,460
It's not a time for advertisement!

470
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:41,340
Let's go, Rak.

471
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:42,820
Let's go to the hospital.

472
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:45,280
I'm fine.

473
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:46,880
My bottom hurts.

474
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,120
Let me help.

475
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:51,140
Go away!

476
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:52,620
Let's go.

477
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:57,280
Rak.

478
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,000
Let's go, Rak.

479
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:20,780
Do you want to try?

480
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:22,440
No.

481
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,240
It's dangerous.

482
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:26,060
I wanna try on your shoes.

483
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,880
Are they comfy?

484
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,420
Let's trade.

485
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:32,880
No.

486
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:35,620
This is better for skateboarding.

487
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,300
Don't look at my Kim&Co.

488
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,080
Let's trade.

489
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:39,660
No!

490
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:41,660
Come on.

491
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:42,380
No.

492
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:44,060
Hey, boy come on.

493
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,600
You're being nonsense.

494
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,420
Hello.

495
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:51,900
Hello, I'm Toosafe.

496
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,200
And I'm Ohm Krit.

497
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:59,340
Today we'll be MC for our college's activity day.

498
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:02,800
Today we also have a special guest.

499
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:03,880
His name is...

500
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:07,420
is...

501
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:10,560
Ton, our college's star.

502
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:15,180
Hello.

503
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:16,160
Hello everyone.

504
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:25,780
Ok guys, let's interview him.

505
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:29,980
How do you feel being back to our college today?

506
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:31,400
I'm very happy.

507
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:34,800
It's like I get to be a freshman again.

508
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,760
Really?

509
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,380
Yes, it's been a while since I'm not a freshman.

510
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:40,800
It's a heart-warming feeling.

511
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,280
You miss here, right?

512
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,380
Yes.

513
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:47,820
How do you feel about today's activity?

514
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:50,360
It's so crowded.

515
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:52,360
A lot of freshman are here.

516
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,340
Yes, exactly.

517
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:57,040
This year our college want it to be big.

518
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:01,280
I can guarantee you there are lot of activities.

519
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,740
You are also excited, right?

520
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:06,780
Yes, I'm so excited.

521
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,440
Good.

522
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,480
You're so good.

523
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,480
You're the best.

524
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:19,300
That's why you're college's star.

525
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:22,440
Everyone here is so handsome.

526
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,920
Enough for today.

527
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,920
How about you two, MCs?

528
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:37,480
Do you want to be an actor?

529
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:41,020
Have you signed contract with any agencies yet?

530
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:43,520
I'm not good at acting.

531
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:45,520
You can try.

532
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:51,520
Are you two a couple?

533
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,440
Is it correct?

534
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:58,440
So cute.

535
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,500
Hello guys.

536
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:02,520
Hey.

537
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,260
Hi.

538
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:04,620
It's so cute.

539
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:07,380
Can you do this?

540
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:09,380
Ok.

541
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,360
Er...

542
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,460
Are you still here?

543
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,040
I'm just helping them.

544
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,460
Ah.

545
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:21,020
Ok.

546
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,460
I'll do all this for you.

547
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:27,000
So you can take a walk.

548
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,560
Because I'm bored.

549
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,500
I'll take care of it from now on.

550
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:35,520
Dino is putting a pressure on me.

551
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:38,640
You can look at him, he's over there.

552
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:44,740
See?

553
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,580
The way he looks at me.

554
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:53,040
Why won't Dino get here?

555
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:54,860
I don't know.

556
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,860
He said people look at him.

557
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:57,700
Ah.

558
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:58,720
He said he's annoyed.

559
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,720
I'm also annoyed by him.

560
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:03,900
What a narcissist guy!

561
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:08,140
Can I go out?

562
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:09,680
Of course.

563
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,100
Go ahead.

564
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:15,860
Professor told me to do some work for freshman.

565
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:18,100
So you can walk around.

566
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,140
You can go, I'll do the rest.

567
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,800
Make a paper bird, right?

568
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:24,800
How many of them?

569
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,480
You made a lot.

570
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:34,160
Hey, Chalarm.

571
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:37,100
Where have you been?

572
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,100
I was a flyer distributor.

573
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:41,180
So sleepy.

574
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,460
Hey.

575
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:44,140
What are you doing?

576
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:45,980
Hey.

577
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:47,560
You came here to sleep?

578
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:50,220
Chalarm.

579
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:54,000
Are you sleeping or dead?

580
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:58,380
I saw that he was a flyer distributor.

581
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:01,100
He might be exhausted.

582
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:04,940
I can wake him up.

583
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:06,460
No.

584
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:08,260
Let him sleep.

585
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:10,520
So he can't annoy me.

586
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,780
I want to finish this work.

587
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:16,800
So I can go see my girl.

588
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:22,219
She said she's alone.

589
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:28,260
How can her friends leave her alone?

590
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,120
I must hurry up.

591
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,600
You did a paper bird, right?

592
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,620
Give it to me.

593
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:35,800
Then I'll go.

594
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,199
Yeah, you may go see Dino.

595
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:38,620
Thank you.

596
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:40,040
Go ahead.

597
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:58,920
Have you waited for me?

598
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:00,300
Um.

599
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:04,260
Sorry, I was helping Suea decorate the booth.

600
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:05,520
It's ok.

601
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:07,520
Have you eaten?

602
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:08,940
Yes.

603
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,820
What about you?

604
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:11,920
Yes, I have.

605
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:14,260
Do you want to walk around?

606
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:16,260
Yes.

607
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,180
But...

608
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:21,620
my hair color.

609
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:22,740
I'm shy.

610
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:24,400
Really?

611
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,120
Um.

612
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,120
Where would you want to go.

613
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,700
Get back to my room.

614
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:30,700
Now?

615
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:31,380
Um.

616
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,020
Then let's go to my room.

617
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,400
It's nearer.

618
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:40,780
You invited me to your room,

619
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:41,920
what do you think?

620
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:43,800
Nothing.

621
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,400
Let's go, don't waste our time.

622
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,160
Hey.

623
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:16,480
Are you hungry?

624
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,220
You seemed exhausted today.

625
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:20,700
Um.

626
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,640
I went to bed late last night.

627
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,720
I ordered you some food.

628
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:29,620
You know me so well.

629
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,540
I'd better be prepared

630
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,160
in case somebody here is hungry.

631
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:35,220
Um.

632
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,680
Then wait a second.

633
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:39,260
Um.

634
00:36:58,720 --> 00:36:59,480
Kaijeaw.

635
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,140
You sleep like Chalarm.

636
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,140
Wake up.

637
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:10,740
Kaijeaw!

638
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:19,300
Delivery drop point.

639
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:26,740
Hey!

640
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:28,340
Yes?

641
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:29,800
You're Rak room 811, right?

642
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,380
Someone sent you the flower.

643
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,740
For me?

644
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,300
Yes.

645
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:37,300
Is there a sender's name on the card?

646
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:39,840
No.

647
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:43,220
A delivery man brought it.

648
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:43,800
Ok.

649
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:46,400
Thank you.

650
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:56,880
Dino.

651
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:57,400
What?

652
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,800
The food is here.

653
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:00,380
Um.

654
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,780
Does Kaijeaw sleep all day?

655
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:08,240
Dino.

656
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,240
Let's eat.

657
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:10,780
Alright.

658
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:14,700
I'll grab some plates.

659
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:19,280
This one is for whom?

660
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,160
It's mine.

661
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,720
"Miss you"

662
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:32,960
Someone sent it to me.

663
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:37,060
I don't know who.

664
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,460
If you don't know, you shouldn't take it.

665
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:41,320
Understand?

666
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:52,840
Well...are you mad?

667
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:55,560
No.

668
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:01,560
But...your face tells it all.

669
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:03,560
Fine.

670
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,280
Look at what you got!

671
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:10,680
You can just tell me that you're mad.

672
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,140
Yes, I'm mad.

673
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:17,520
That's it.

674
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:19,520
I'm still mad.

675
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:22,480
Then what should I do?

676
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:27,120
Kiss my cheeks.

677
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:29,560
Here.

678
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:31,380
Yes.

679
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:36,340
Dino.

680
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:36,840
Why?

681
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:39,860
We're already a couple.

682
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:45,920
I should go get some plates.

683
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:49,380
I'll prepare the food.

684
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:50,280
Um.

685
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:00,280
It's 255 baht altogether.

686
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:02,020
It's on me.

687
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:03,300
Here you are.

688
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,100
Dino.

689
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,260
I'll pay.

690
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:08,560
Actually, you don't have to.

691
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:10,620
I can always pay for you.

692
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:13,780
Wait here, I'll go to the restroom.

693
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:15,520
Um.

694
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,160
Rak!

695
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,920
Hello.

696
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:31,400
Do you remember me?

697
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:35,020
You have such a short memory.

698
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:37,900
I'm a skateboard guy who hit you.

699
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:39,900
Ah.

700
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,340
Glasses guy?

701
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,240
What?

702
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,400
My name is Tart.

703
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:47,160
I didn't wear glasses today.

704
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:52,800
What if I do this, do you remember me now?

705
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:56,320
You're smiling.

706
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,700
You're such a cutie.

707
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:01,180
Anyway, what are you doing here?

708
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:05,140
I'm waiting for my boyfriend, he's in a toilet.

709
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:07,960
You're waiting for you boyfriend.

710
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,300
The red hair guy?

711
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,460
Yes, that one.

712
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,200
I think he's not the one for you.

713
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:20,340
Whatever, I have to go, see you.

714
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:25,500

Dinosaur Love's uncut version is only available at IQIYI and iQ.com

721
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:11,760
Well, I took Rak to Chiang Mai.

722
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:19,320
I have something that's called an engineering student's heart.

723
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:19,800
"Gear"

724
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:23,960
I want to give it to the one I love.

725
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:28,120
And another thing I've been waiting for is

726
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:30,120
a full paper star jar.

727
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:34,220
It seemed like a perfect timing.

728
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:39,600
Rak gave me a full paper star jar.

729
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:41,340
Oh.

730
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:44,640
I have one thing to tell you.

731
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:49,300
Rak's mouth is so soft.

732
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:54,120
I'm the only one who knows.

733
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:58,740
My hair color? As you've seen.

734
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:00,740
Why I did this?

735
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:05,140
Well, my buddy who has a sleepy face and only eats omelette

736
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:08,760
he dyed his hair and Rak stared at him.

737
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,820
A possessive man like me had to do it too.

738
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:13,680
That's it.

739
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:16,380
I'm also annoyed because everyone keeps looking at me.

740
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:21,660
Let me drink this.

741
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:26,960
What did you two do in there?

742
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:32,120
You made my body hurt.

743
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:34,480
Well.

744
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,220
Let me ask you something.

745
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:40,660
Aren't you afraid of Dino?

746
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:43,540
You can be honest with him.

747
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:46,540
The more you lie, the more he'll be frustrated.

748
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:48,320
I know.

749
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:51,040
Hey!

750
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:53,500
Long time no see.
