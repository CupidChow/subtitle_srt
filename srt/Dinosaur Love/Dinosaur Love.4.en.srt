11
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:38,920

Finally.

42
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,600
Ouch.

43
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,740
Don't be fresh with me!

Ouch!

48
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:01,640
Hey, Suea.

49
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:03,500
He's still asleep?

50
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,040
He has slept for a long time.

51
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,320
If he's awake, you would have seen it.

52
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,000
Now you aren't afraid to talk back to me?

53
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,320
Easy, bro.

54
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,900
I'm just telling you.

55
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,140
I didn't show you any disrespect.

56
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,400
If you don't believe me,

57
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,540
you can look me in my eyes.

58
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:26,660
This is even more worse.

59
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,120
You guys are so loud.

60
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,120
You're up?

61
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,840
What's up, brave boy?

62
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,020
Yeah, I am.

63
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,180
What made you think you can go alone?

64
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:39,680
Can you tell me?

65
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,340
Well, I didn't go to start a fight.

66
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:51,220
Did you know who's the owner of that club?

67
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,600
I just knew when I had arrived there.

68
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:55,920
Duh.

69
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,820
Everyone know that he hates me.

70
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:03,080
If you went there and come back without any wounds,

71
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:04,000
that would be such a surprise.

72
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,760
I also knew this short time ago,

73
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:11,540
that the owner of the club is him.

74
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:15,880
Hey Suea, where's my phone?

75
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:17,760
Ah, right.

76
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:19,339
Here.

77
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,380
Wait.

78
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:28,540
You haven't told me about Rak lately.

79
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,540
Alright.

80
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:33,760
I didn't mean to stalk on your phone

81
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,900
but Rak messaged you.

82
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:37,380
And also called you.

83
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:40,420
Calm down, bro.

84
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,659
I told him that

85
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,040
you got into a fight.

86
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,320
Currently, you're at a hospital.

87
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,100
What did he say?

88
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,360
He said...

89
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:55,240
he'll visit you.

90
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:56,120
Um.

91
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,180
Looking for who? Him?

92
00:04:59,180 --> 00:04:59,580
Yeah.

93
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:00,400
Haven't arrived yet.

94
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,340
You're in a hurry.

95
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,340
Oh! Here.

96
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,100
He's coming.

97
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:06,580
Ops.

98
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,420
Should I take his call?

99
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:11,560
Just take it.

100
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,700
Are you sure?

101
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,220
Yes.

102
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:14,640
Ok. I'll take it.

103
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,500
Hello, Rak.

104
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:23,320
This isn't Dino, this is Suea, a handsome guy.

105
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,180
Do you arrive here?

106
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,760
Alright.

107
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,400
I'll go take you here.

108
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:33,860
Ok.

109
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:34,480
See you.

110
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:36,159
Bye, Rak.

111
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:37,740
Xoxo.

112
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:38,920
What the f*ck?

113
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,580
Go take him here.

114
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,700
Do I have to go?

115
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:43,400
Yeah.

116
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,620
Why don't you go?

117
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:46,240
I'm still hurting.

118
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:46,980
Just kidding.

119
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,280
Alright.

120
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:50,600
Hurry up.

121
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,380
He likes to mess with people.

122
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,020
Why the hell he's taking so slow?

123
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,640
Are you free today?

124
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:00,780
Yes.

125
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:04,300
What about your boy?

126
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:06,540
My boy?

127
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:10,500
He's nice, such a good guy.

128
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:11,920
But sometimes he's too naughty.

129
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,720
How?

130
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:15,320
So many stories.

131
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:18,480
Last night, I told him to go to bed but he wouldn't.

132
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,660
He wanted me to sing for him.

133
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:22,660
He's naughty.

134
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,300
That's right.

135
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,000
Someone's coming for you.

136
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:30,580
Dino.

137
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:31,660
Hi.

138
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,320
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

139
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,920
How are you?

140
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,580
Where do you hurt?

141
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,360
I'm fine, those wounds are far from my heart.

142
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:45,760
Because my heart is with you.

143
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:50,060
Bro, I'm about to puke.

144
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,780
That's so cringe, bro.

145
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:52,720
Damn.

146
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,000
Not your business.

147
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:56,960
What?

148
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,740
Not your business.

149
00:06:59,060 --> 00:06:59,940
You bought some oranges?

150
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:01,940
I'll peel them for you.

151
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:02,780
Um.

152
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,160
You can go.

153
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:08,840
I'll have one.

154
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,700
Can you take an orange that hasn't been peeled?

155
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,900
I want to eat the peeled one.

156
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,140
Feed me, Rak.

157
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:17,820
You don't have any classes today?

158
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,000
I have a morning class.

159
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,640
I came here after I had finished.

160
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:23,320
Now I'm free.

161
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,320
What about your girl?

162
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:27,980
Oh.

163
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,900
She's in a class.

164
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:34,480
Never mind, I can be here with you all day.

165
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:39,040
She's single, right? Well, I have a single friend too.

166
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,340
Maybe I'll let them go on a date.

167
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:42,880
Hey.

168
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:46,220
No!

169
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:48,220
I'm leaving.

170
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,620
Alright?

171
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,320
I'm leaving, please take care of my bro.

172
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,400
Um.

173
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,320
I'll come again in the evening,

174
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,620
Please take good care of him.

175
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,620
Just go, Suea.

176
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:01,700
I will.

177
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:02,380
Let me take some.

178
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,840
I'm leaving too.

179
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:06,240
Alright.

180
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:06,700
Tasty.

181
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:07,520
Yes.

182
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:08,920
Bye.

183
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,100
See you.

184
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:19,400
He'll come back, right?

185
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,280
Um, his name is Suea.

186
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:23,740
Another one is Mhee.

187
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:24,760
My buddy line.

188
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:30,060
Will you eat this? I'll put on your bedside table.

189
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,059
Feed me, please.

190
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,059
What?

191
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,059
Feed me.

192
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:41,179
I got into a fight, I haven't had anything yet and my arms hurt.

193
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:42,419
Ouch.

194
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,400
Hurry up.

195
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,039
Ouch.

196
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,240
I'll call a nurse.

197
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,080
No!

198
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:50,520
I just want you to feed me.

199
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,080
I want to eat oranges.

200
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,680
I can't move my arms. It hurt.

201
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,500
I haven't had anything.

202
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,160
I'll feed you.

203
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,080
Come this close.

204
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:19,340
Er....are you...finish?

205
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,860
I've just had one.

206
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,240
Feed me more.

207
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,660
I said come this close.

208
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,200
Hmm?

209
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:38,940
Here's the orange.

210
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,280
I don't want to.

211
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:49,460
But...

212
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:52,420
there are many of them left.

213
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:54,420
Then, I'll...

214
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:56,520
Stop talking.

215
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:01,160
Please forget your ex quickly.

216
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,300
I want to take care of you.

217
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:09,060
[the second I saw you]

218
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,460
[you made me..]

219
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:15,260
Excuse me, can I check your pulse?

220
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:18,320
Well, then

221
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:21,220
I'll peel more oranges.

222
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:22,920
Yeah.

223
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:35,880
I'm sorry.

224
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,100
I didn't mean to.

225
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,680
I know I'm wrong.

226
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,780
But please listen to me.

227
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:52,080
He said he'll give remission if I bring you to him.

228
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:56,700
So I told you to come with others too.

229
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,200
I thought I wasn't going to do it.

230
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,800
But he said he'll hurt my mom.

231
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,320
He's going to hurt my mom.

232
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,840
I went to the police but they wouldn't let me report it.

233
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,980
They said it made it myself.

234
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,200
And the money my mom owes him is half a million.

235
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,820
500k, how could I afford that much money?

236
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:25,420
I'm still a student.

237
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,860
So he said,

238
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,880
I need to bring you there.

239
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,980
Dino, I know I'm not a really good friend.

240
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,240
I'm a terrible friend.

241
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,980
But I didn't have any intention to hurt you.

242
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,140
I'm sorry.

243
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:01,940
I can prostrate you here or I can make an oath anywhere.

244
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,960
I haven't wanted to harm you.

245
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,880
I haven't wanted you to get hurt because of me.

246
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,200
Is he give you a remission like he said?

247
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,340
Yes.

248
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:24,140
And he doesn't allow my mom to be near his club ever again.

249
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:28,600
I'm sorry.

250
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,060
Please stop being angry at me.

251
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,300
Can you find me something to hit your head first?

252
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:40,960
Then I'll stop being angry.

253
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,500
Ok, fine.

254
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,000
You can hit me or punch me now.

255
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:55,220
Go ahead.

256
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:17,540
Please stop being angry at me.

257
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:21,280
I'm still mad at you.

258
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:25,160
Not because you got me into a fight.

259
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,740
But because you've never told us anything.

260
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,940
Isn't Top your friend?

261
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,360
Huh, Sim?

262
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,280
What do you want me to do?

263
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,180
You gonna give me money?

264
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,180
Isn't that disgusting?

265
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,640
I think you need to stop.

266
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:48,520
Stop talking sh*t like this.

267
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:50,800
You try to think this through,

268
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:55,400
You brought your friend for them to hit him.

269
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,080
Don't you think it's disgusting?

270
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:01,100
And you can think the other way around,

271
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:05,220
If Dino can't make it, what would your mom feel about that?

272
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:08,260
Have you thought about this?

273
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,060
I'm telling you...

274
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,460
I don't care about what you're gonna do.

275
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,680
But if I were Dino, I would definitely punch your face.

276
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:27,740
I'm sorry.

277
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:32,700
Stop saying this.

278
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,800
I'm really sorry.

279
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:39,580
I think you'd better say this when you feel truly guilty.

280
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:41,860
Anyone can just say sorry.

281
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:54,400
What about you? Do you want to leave?

282
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,120
Um, let's go.

283
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,540
You need to take a rest.

284
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:00,940
I'll take him home.

285
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:02,480
Hey, I'm sorry.

286
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:03,620
Dino

287
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:04,420
Enough.

288
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,240
Let him go.

289
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:06,440
Please talk to me.
Let him go.

290
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,160
Please talk to me.

291
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:07,880
You have to go.

292
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:16,000
Yes, dad?

293
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,580
I'm eating out with Dino.

294
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,180
Hello,dad.

295
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,580
I'm talking to my dad.

296
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:26,060
I might come home a little late today.

297
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:28,580
Because I've to go to my friend's birthday party.

298
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,580
Don't worry.

299
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:33,740
I'll take good care of myself.

300
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:36,700
Well noted.

301
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,580
I promise you I won't get drunk.

302
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,660
I've told you before.

303
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:45,580
I miss you too, dad.

304
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:46,900
Miss you too, dad.

305
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,180
Yes.

306
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:54,540
Whose birthday party you're going to?

307
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,680
It's Aun's birthday party.

308
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:57,740
He's my friend.

309
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,240
I'll come with you.

310
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,240
But..there will be a lot of my friends.

311
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,620
I will go anyway.

312
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:06,160
Um.

313
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,580
Why are you smiling?

314
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,880
I'll show them you're mine.

315
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:16,640
My rabbit.

316
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,260
Dino.

317
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:20,740
What?

318
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,600
You're such a cute rabbit.

319
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:24,600
Hmm?

320
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,660
You keep staring at me.

321
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,040
You told me to eat, why don't you eat it?

322
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,820
I saw that you've been staring at me for awhile now.

323
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,020
I'm full.

324
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,080
You eat it.

325
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,300
But it's still left.

326
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,180
Just looking at you makes me full already.

327
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,120
Eat it.

328
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,700
But it's still left for us to eat.

329
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:52,800
I know.

330
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:57,700
This cafe is good though.

331
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:58,800
Um.

332
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,160
I think it tastes sweet.

333
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:01,880
I like it.

334
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:04,300
You're eating like a child.

335
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,099
Well, it's delicious.

336
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,200
When will Rak arrive?

337
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,440
We've been waiting for so long.

338
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,560
I'm about to get drunk. // True.

339
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,180
There he is.

340
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:30,920
What's up, guys?

341
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:33,640
Hey, how have you been?

342
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,540
Who are you coming with?

343
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:38,580
Er...

344
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:41,460
His name is Dino.

345
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:44,060
He studies at the university I'll attend.

346
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:48,220
Hello, Dino.

347
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:48,920
Hi.

348
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:52,020
Well, how did you guys meet?

349
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:53,820
I'm flirting with Rak

350
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:55,820
Wow.

351
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,480
Dino. // Why?

352
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:58,480
I'm flirting with you.

353
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,660
By the way, I have something for you.

354
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,660
Wow, a gift for me?

355
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,240
Wow, so cute.

356
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,920
Since you're here, you need to have a drink.

357
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,200
Yeah, that's right.

358
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,200
Just a little for me.

359
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,800
Here you are.

360
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:21,100
This shot is for my birthday.

361
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,320
Cheers!

362
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,120
Drink more.

363
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,900
Don't make that face, it doesn't that bitter.

364
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:33,240
Your face says it all.

365
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:35,080
Just keep drinking for the sake of my birthday.

366
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:37,080
I'll take care of you.

367
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:39,840
You can drink.

368
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:57,460
Why don't you two drink together?

369
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,880
Let's cheers!

370
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:10,820
I think Rak can't stand it anymore, can you take him outside?

371
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:13,600
Do you want some fresh air?

372
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:16,380
Um. // Let's go.

373
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,380
Please come back soon.

374
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:19,800
I'll be right back.

375
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:23,480
Alright.

376
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,860
When will you stop looking at him?

377
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,880
Well, he's cute.

378
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,120
I'll hit you.

379
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:00,820
He's actually cute.

380
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:02,560
Cute, huh?

381
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,200
Am I handsome?

382
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,000
Yes.

383
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,900
What do you like the most?

384
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,120
Answer me.

385
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:15,820
Come on.

386
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:18,220
I'll answer.

387
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,460
You are what I like.

388
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,860
Even though I like you a lot doesn't mean...

389
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:26,940
That means you already like me.

390
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:33,040
Dino caught me again.

391
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,500
By the way, Dino.

392
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,000
Hmm?

393
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:42,000
I think I won't drink.

394
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,000
Because I need to go back home.

395
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,420
And my dad wouldn't like that.

396
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,100
Who allows you to go home?

397
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,820
I talked to your dad.

398
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:55,080
Your dad allows you to sleepover with me tonight.

399
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,400
I'll take good care of you.

400
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,480
Rak.

401
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:10,860
6 p.m. tomorrow,

402
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:12,520
Can we talk?

403
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:13,860
At Central World (shopping mall)

404
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:17,940
Who is it?

405
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:20,520
It's Mek.

406
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,100
Rak.

407
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,280
Don't worry, I won't let you go alone.

408
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,260
Come on, let's get inside.

409
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,140
You took so long in a restroom.

410
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,020
Um.

411
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:01,820
My stomach hurt a little.

412
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,320
Um.

413
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,400
Well, do you finish playing it?

414
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:07,480
Um.

415
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,560
Why? Do you want to play?

416
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:13,400
Um.

417
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,940
Can you teach me?

418
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:17,560
Of course.

419
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,220
But I need to see your hand first.

420
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:31,320
So soft.

421
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:35,700
You mean my hand?

422
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:36,780
Um.

423
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,120
Too soft to play this.

424
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:41,060
Well...

425
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,420
Otherwise it'll get harder.

426
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:54,140
But if I want to play. Can you teach me?

427
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,020
Yeah. Come sit here.

428
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:00,860
Well...

429
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,120
Can't I sit beside you?

430
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,760
It's cramped. Wanna try?

431
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,160
Come here.

432
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:09,400
Alright.

433
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,460
Let's start with the D chord.

434
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:24,660
Place your index finger on the 3rd line.

435
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:27,580
Like this, then move to the second one.

436
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,280
Give it a try.

437
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:34,900
No, not like that. Hold on tight.

438
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,480
Again. You can do better.

439
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:45,280
Go for it.

440
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:47,960
Try it out.

441
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,460
Yes. // Don't rush.

442
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:54,800
Press it harder.

443
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,600
When doing something...

444
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,800
you use force to get it done.

445
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,540
And something is meant to be cherished.

446
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:18,640
[When will you be my lover?]

447
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:19,520
So fragrant.

448
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,160
[I'm counting the days until I can be yours]

449
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,980
[I smile every time we meet]

450
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,100
Are you... talking about me?

451
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:28,380
Nah.

452
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:29,680
I talked about Ichitan.

453
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:32,820
Fine.

454
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,480
Let's focus.

455
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,300
Let me see your fingers.

456
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:43,060
It's all red.

457
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,060
We should stop here.

458
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:50,900
Then shouldn't you let me go?

459
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:56,120
Do you think that...

460
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,640
a tiger will release its prey?

461
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:06,540
I'm not a prey, and you're not a tiger.

462
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:08,820
That's a figurative language.

463
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,960
Are you dumb or just playing dumb?

464
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:15,920
Dino.

465
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,300
Let me go already.

466
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,080
No.

467
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,360
By the way, Rak.

468
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,380
How is the paper star jar?

469
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,440
I'm not telling you.

470
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,240
What?!

471
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:29,280
So how can I know if it's full?

472
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,180
I'll tell you when the time comes.

473
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:35,640
Fine.

474
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,840
Forget the paper star.

475
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,500
One thing is for sure...

476
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:39,800
right now...

477
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,060
I can fully hug you.

478
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,160
Normally,

479
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:52,520
I didn't sing or play it for anyone.

480
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,200
So, why did you play it for me?

481
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,500
Do you really have no idea?

482
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:06,380
I've got some clues, but I don't want to imagine things.

483
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,060
Then,

484
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:11,620
you will have to imagine things...

485
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,840
when you're with me.

486
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,320
Do you want me to go down bad?

487
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,360
Will you?

488
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,200
Um.

489
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,040
Oh, Rak.

490
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,620
Why did your dad named you this?

491
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:33,120
He said... so that many people will love me.

492
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,020
It suits you.

493
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:39,460
But...

494
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,740
no one loves me.

495
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:47,380
I do.

496
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:53,040
But you just know me. How could you love me?

497
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:54,600
How could I not?

498
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:55,580
Tell me.

499
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:01,720
How could you love someone you've known for just 3 months?

500
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,540
Love at first sight.

501
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,060
Haven't you heard of it?

502
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:10,420
I have.

503
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,300
But I don't believe in it.

504
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,460
At first,

505
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,180
I also don't,

506
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,280
until I met you.

507
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,360
You just 'like' me.

508
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:28,480
Don't judge me.

509
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,640
I know how I feel.

510
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,040
I just said what's on my mind.

511
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:35,040
I'm sorry.

512
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:41,620
If you feel bad about it, let me sing for you.

513
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,980
Uh. You're going to sing?

514
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:59,600
[What exactly is love at first sight?]

515
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:02,500
[Are you the one...]

516
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,540
[who opened my mind?]

517
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:07,700
Dino!

518
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:11,880
Stop it.

519
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,760
What time is it? Huh?

520
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:16,560
It's...

521
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:20,700
2 a.m.

522
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,920
Go shower. I'll wait.

523
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:30,540
Your hands... let go.

524
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:32,320
Nah.

525
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:34,780
Why should I?

526
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:37,680
Or...

527
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,440
Do you want me to help you shower?

528
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,140
You're so horny.

529
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:47,140
You think just this much is horny?

530
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:50,140
Why don't you try dating with me?

531
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,320
So you will know...

532
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:54,760
what horny actually is.

533
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,600
I'm gonna go.

534
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,540
Why hasn't he arrived yet?

535
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,700
Mek said he was at work, but he's coming.

536
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,000
If he doesn't show up in 20 minutes, I'll take you home.

537
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,240
It might take some time.

538
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:35,940
Clear things up and hurry home.

539
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:37,080
Don't start a fight.

540
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,340
Roger that.

541
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,980
Rak? You didn't come alone?

542
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,940
I let him come along.

543
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,540
I get it.

544
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:03,340
You're still afraid of me, aren't you?

545
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,180
What do you want to tell me, Mek?

546
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,320
I want to apologize...

547
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:11,880
for everything.

548
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,800
Even though I forgive you,

549
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:21,320
I don't forget what you did.

550
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,120
But you have my forgiveness

551
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:29,320
because I don't want any kinds of connection with you.

552
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,320
I'm relieved to hear that you forgave me.

553
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,740
I'm happy with just that.

554
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,800
Can I hug you one last time?

555
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,140
That's not acceptable.

556
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,380
Think about what you did.

557
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,380
Do you think he wanna hug you?

558
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:51,380
Am I talking to you??

559
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,860
I know you want it, Rak.

560
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:58,140
I miss you, Rak.

561
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:04,520
Enough.

562
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:11,240
Rak.

563
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,180
Is this all you want to say?

564
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:20,200
Can't I have another chance?

565
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:25,600
I already gave that chance to someone else.

566
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:33,380
Okay.

567
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,780
Now I understand.

568
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,560
If I can have fame, work, and money again

569
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,480
I'll come back to you.

570
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,560
Is that all you can think of?

571
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:55,680
Why?

572
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:57,800
You're afraid, right?

573
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,180
Because if I become famous again,

574
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,000
Rak will abandon you and come back to me!

575
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:06,380
Stop! Do you know what you're doing?

576
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:08,100
You said you'll only apologize.

577
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:10,980
If you're like this, go home!

578
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:13,100
Wait for me, Rak. // Come on!

579
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,760
I'll call you. // Mek!

580
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,400
Don't cry anymore.

581
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:25,800
Alright?

582
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:35,460
I'm with you.

583
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:43,820
(3 months later)
 Yes, dad. I'm almost at the dorm.

584
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:46,000
Don't worry.

585
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:49,060
I'll work hard.

586
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,800
Please take care, dad.

587
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,520
Bye bye.

588
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,720
You didn't forget anything, right?

589
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:16,700
No, I didn't.

590
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:17,640
Okay.

591
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:21,040
You don't look excited.

592
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:25,380
Because I've experienced it.

593
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:27,800
Good.

594
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,460
It's the same everywhere else.

595
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:32,860
Are you nervous about SOTUS?

596
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:36,160
No.

597
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:40,660
I'm more concerned about the dorm and the extra work.

598
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:42,520
Extra work?

599
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:44,980
Why?

600
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,960
I want to earn some money while studying.

601
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,560
Oh.

602
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,240
Do you want to work with me?

603
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:56,780
Your Bar?

604
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:00,660
It's also a restaurant. Kind of mix in between.

605
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,660
Hm.

606
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:05,020
Why don't you try working for a month?

607
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:09,120
I won't blame you if you try and don't like it.

608
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:10,320
And I'll help you find a new job.

609
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,139
I'm interested. When can I start?

610
00:34:14,139 --> 00:34:15,260
Haha. Calm down.

611
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:18,980
Ah. It should be after SOTUS ends.

612
00:34:19,699 --> 00:34:20,760
Because you'll be very exhausted.

613
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:24,500
If you study, join activities and work at the same time.

614
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,000
You'll be all messed up.

615
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:30,739
I understand.

616
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,639
Have Dino texted you?

617
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,199
Not at all.

618
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:40,179
He's quite busy.

619
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,380
He asked me to tell you that...

620
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:44,840
don't remove the paper star from the jar.

621
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,960
Um. Will I get to see him?

622
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,679
Umm.

623
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,560
There's a rule that...

624
00:34:55,659 --> 00:35:00,020
SOTUS leader can't be close or flirt with freshmen.

625
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:03,840
Dino is ready to break the rule for you, though.

626
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:06,760
And he'll surely kill me and the others if we stop him.

627
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,360
Just don't talk to him too much.

628
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:11,480
Well, you can

629
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,460
but try not to let anyone knows,

630
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:14,860
so he won't be punished.

631
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,920
I'll be careful. // Um.

632
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,700
Alright. Get to work. Lemme help.

633
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:45,920
Can I come in?

634
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:47,840
Huh?

635
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:04,280
Are you my roommate?

636
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:06,760
I guess?

637
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:09,200
My name is Rak.

638
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:11,320
What's your name?

639
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:12,820
Chalarm (Shark).

640
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:16,780
Um. Chalarm.

641
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:20,920
So, Chalarm,

642
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,820
do you know that the seniors want to meet us in the evening?

643
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:26,500
Um.

644
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:27,880
I do.

645
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:34,580
Let's get ready and head to the meeting point.

646
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,900
Can I bring my friend here?

647
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:41,900
Of course, Chalarm.

648
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:44,220
I want to make a lot of friends.

649
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:48,780
Hey! Chalarm, it's a snake!

650
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:49,980
No.

651
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:52,260
It's Kaijeaw (Omelette).

652
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:54,200
It'll bite you, Chalarm!

653
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,760
It won't. We're close.

654
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:59,540
But I don't want to be close with it.

655
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:04,360
Uh... // Say hi first. // I...

656
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:06,680
He'll live here, so we're friends.

657
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:07,840
Don't you think it's cute?

658
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:12,660
I don't like this, Chalarm.

659
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:16,840
Er-- we... // Say hi.

660
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:20,480
We... should... go to the meeting point.

661
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,080
Let's go, then. I'll take Kaijeaw with us.

662
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,600
No, you can't! Put it down.

663
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,540
Is that so? // Or they'll scold you.

664
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,620
Okay, I'll put it down.

665
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:35,620
Hurry up! Heyy.

666
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:40,540
Chalarm, don't tease me! Put it down first.

667
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:46,100
Chalarm.

668
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:48,100
That's my bed.

669
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,140
Put it away please.

670
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:59,000
Wait here. // Let's go.

671
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:01,060
Go go.

672
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:04,140
Have you finished putting away your stuff?

673
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:06,520
You brought only a few things.

674
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:07,920
Yes, I have.

675
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:34,880
Hey!

676
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:36,540
Chalarm.

677
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:37,420
I'm hungry.

678
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:43,220
Ha, you don't need to stare at me like that.

679
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,800
It made me scared.

680
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:46,940
Let's find something to eat.

681
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:49,960
Chalarm.

682
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,480
Can you wait for me here?

683
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:53,860
I'll be right back.

684
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:55,860
Um.

685
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,320
Where are you going?

686
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:04,460
I'm going to eat something.

687
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:07,120
Have you eaten yet?

688
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:11,100
Not yet. I'm gonna treat you to a meal.

689
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,020
Mhee said...

690
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:19,700
SOTUS leader can't be close or flirt with freshmen.

691
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:23,220
Well... you're the only freshman who knows that rule.

692
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,940
But if someone knows and wants to speak up...

693
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:28,520
Try me.

694
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:35,880
Dino.

695
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:42,200
Uh.

696
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,820
This is Chalarm.

697
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:46,820
My roommate.

698
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:50,600
Hello.

699
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,500
That's name suits you.

700
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:56,320
I'm hungry.

701
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:59,100
Dino, I...

702
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:01,000
Go. I'll text you when I'm free.

703
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,460
I'll wait for you.

704
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:10,860
Rak.

705
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:11,980
Yes?

706
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,200
I miss you.

707
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:16,180
I...

708
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:20,380
miss you, too.

709
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,520
Then, come to my place tonight.

710
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:29,600
Dino!

711
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:31,060
I'm leaving.

712
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:41,680
Chalarm?

713
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,120
Hungry.

714
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,260
So, what do you want to eat?

715
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:48,580
Omelette.

716
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,440
Anything else?

717
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,760
I want only omelette.

718
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,620
But Stir fried basil with minced pork is very tasty here.

719
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:57,920
Omelette.

720
00:40:58,780 --> 00:40:59,640
Omelette again?

721
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:03,340
Fine. Let's go with Omelette. // Yeah.

722
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:13,680
Hey.

723
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:16,080
Hey!

724
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:20,180
Hey!!

725
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:21,880
Huh?

726
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:24,940
Be active! Be happy!

727
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:25,740
Ah.

728
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:26,980
Ha!

729
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:28,200
Ow!

730
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:30,700
We're Recreational staff this year!

731
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:32,780
We must make the freshmen happy!

732
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:36,400
Our faculty's SOTUS leaders are too grumpy,

733
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:37,860
so too much stress is in the air.

734
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:39,560
That's why we can't stress out!

735
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:41,340
How so?

736
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:45,040
How about start smiling?

737
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:47,020
They say "Thailand is the land of smile."

738
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:49,260
A smile can change the world.

739
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:50,700
Try it.

740
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:55,420
That's not a good one. Try again.

741
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:00,500
Lemme think.

742
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:01,500
Why?

743
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:04,540
It's not enough to leave a good impression.

744
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:05,840
You have to look kinder.

745
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,440
How about speaking in a high-pitched tone?

746
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:11,640
I heard it'll make you look friendly and accessible.

747
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:13,380
Dogs also like people with high-pitched voices.

748
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:14,920
Ah. // Give it a try.

749
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:17,040
Hello, everyone.

750
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,700
Not bad. But let's keep it for next time.

751
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:21,980
The tone is beyond understanding.

752
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:23,820
What should I do then? // Let me see.

753
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:30,380
Well, if you can't make it in the natural way,

754
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,740
why don't we turn to surgery?

755
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:36,300
Will it be ok? I've never done it before.

756
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:38,540
Have some courage.

757
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:41,080
I know it!

758
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:45,400
Go to a clinic and lift your lips corner up a bit.

759
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:48,240
Your lips are pointing downwards, so you always look so angry.

760
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:51,580
Just lift it up. Just a little bit.

761
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:54,260
So you'll be pretty and can smile with confident.

762
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:56,280
How is it? // Good idea. I'll try it out.

763
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:58,500
Give it some thought. // Okay.

764
00:42:58,740 --> 00:42:59,220
Ha!

765
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:01,720
Are seniors this year that scary?

766
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:05,120
We'll be smiley seniors!

767
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:06,520
Just wait and see.

768
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:09,340
You're right! We're not scared

769
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:13,280
because we're happy!

770
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:17,840
They don't look quite happy, though.

771
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:20,620
You can't do it?!

772
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:24,720
And you're late today. Do you think it's acceptable?

773
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:30,320
You can't even introduce yourselves again?

774
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:35,460
[When will you be my lover?]

775
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:38,160

Dinosaur Love's uncut version is only available at IQIYI and iQ.com

777
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:46,540
[I’m not imagining things]

778
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:51,240
[You're talented at making a man think about you]

779
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:55,620
[and yearn for you every day]

780
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:17,060
Dino's inner thought.

781
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:17,940
Sim?

782
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,480
He's one of my friends.

783
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:22,660
But his mom is a gambling addict

784
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:24,660
so they captured him.

785
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:27,200
I have to help him.

786
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:31,220
But as you all know,

787
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:34,400
I was crushed and taken to hospital.

788
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:36,320
There's a good side, though.

789
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:42,760
I got to spend time with Rak, and knew how much he worried about me.

790
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:48,260
And... I successfully pleaded him in feeding me orange.

791
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:50,480
And...

792
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:54,900
Well, as you can see,

793
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:57,360
The nurse got in the way.

794
00:44:58,580 --> 00:44:59,740
Otherwise,

795
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:03,640
I would have known how soft Rak's lips are.

796
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:08,740
If you're not feeling well, don't rush.

797
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:10,280
We're not in a hurry.

798
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:18,340
Oh, why don't you go to the Cheer room?

799
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:20,260
Me?

800
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:22,940
Yes, you.

801
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:25,100
It's only the two of us here.

802
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:28,560
You better stay away from Dino.
