3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:07,740
Who is he?

4
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:08,830
He's here. He's here.

5
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:11,050
It's him. It's him.

6
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:13,800
I'm asking you. I'm asking you.

7
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:17,720
You won't answer, right?

8
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:20,210
Okay, come and talk to me.

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,220
Come here.

10
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:21,810
Meck!

11
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:29,270
I can't stand it, Meck.

12
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,020
Let's break up.

13
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:32,100
No, Ruk.

14
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,070
Let's make up.

15
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:35,430
I don't want to break up with you.

16
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:37,310
Let me tell you.

17
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:40,570
The person you should be most afraid of

18
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:42,820
is your crazy friend.

19
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:47,290
I'm telling you, I won't.

20
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:50,880
If I can't have you,

21
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,710
you won't get it either.

[Dinosaur's Love]

24
00:02:31,829 --> 00:02:32,540
Ruk.

25
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,070
Open the door.

26
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:41,880
Ruk, are you still mad at me?

27
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:47,040
You've never been mad at me for so long.

28
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:53,670
I like...

29
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:54,720
Ruk.

30
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,230
Hey.

31
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,000
Your friend is not here.

32
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:03,130
He hasn't come back for days.

33
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:05,330
He must be so anxious that he's a monk.

34
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:09,020
Oh.

35
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:09,980
To be honest,

36
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:12,450
I've been wanting to ask about your friend several times.

37
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:16,100
Did your friend get involved by someone else?

38
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:19,860
I know you're a bad person.

39
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,630
Did you get involved by someone else?

40
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:22,360
Is there? Is there?

41
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:24,020
Or no?

42
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:26,000
No.

43
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:27,060
Really?

44
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,480
That's fine.

45
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,120
Let me ask you something else.

46
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:33,620
I love the drama

47
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:35,579
I love it.

48
00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:37,210
Is it a sequel?

49
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:38,750
Which episode was it?

50
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:39,770
Our album, right?

51
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:41,280
It's the sequel of that drama.

52
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,380
Seriously, can I make a guest appearance?

53
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:45,890
What?

54
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,380
I guess not.

55
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:51,200
That's it. Your friend isn't here.

56
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,160
Go home.

57
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,390
No matter how hard you knock, it's useless.

58
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:55,460
Okay.

59
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,330
Tell your friend Meck that I like him.

60
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,190
He’s not happy recently.

61
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:06,650
Go. Go.

62
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:08,780
I think so.

63
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:11,960
People with bad character tend to intervene in other people's relationships.

64
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:15,050
But did I get involved too?

65
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:16,769
It's okay.

66
00:04:55,650 --> 00:05:01,750
[Ruk: Dino, are you free?]

67
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,990
[Dino, are you free?]

68
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:05,010
[Dino: I'm busy. What's up?]

69
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,500
[I'm busy. What's up?]

70
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:19,580
[Ruk: I'm just asking.] Forget it if you're not free.

71
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:17,860
[I'm just asking. Forget it if you're busy.]

72
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:30,020
[Dino:] Just answer if you want to talk to me.

73
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,670
[Just answer if you want to talk to me.]

74
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:35,370
[Ruk: I want to talk to you.]

75
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,820
[I want to talk to you.]

76
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:39,490
[Dino: That's it.] I'm free for you anytime.

77
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:39,220
[That's it.] I'm free for you anytime.

78
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:43,810
[Dino: If you say you want to talk,]

79
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:40,940
[If you say you want to talk,]

80
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:45,040
Who are you chatting with?

81
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:47,120
People.

82
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:47,900
What?

83
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:50,020
Is it him?
What?

84
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:51,380
Let me ask you.

85
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:52,180
Tell me.

86
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:54,500
If you let me guess,

87
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:55,740
Definitely.

88
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:58,270
You must be the one

89
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:00,700
who made you stay away from society.

90
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,280
You even registered a social chat account?

91
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:02,910
Yes.

92
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:04,740
He didn't know how to play before.

93
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:05,430
Yeah.

94
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,590
I asked him to play, but he said he was bored.

95
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:09,230
I texted him, but he didn't reply.

96
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:11,400
Hey, Ruk. What are you doing?

97
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:13,740
Ruk.

98
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,490
Are you lonely? I can go to you.

99
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,530
Find something to eat.

100
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,280
You might get stomach disease.

101
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,600
Find something to eat.

102
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,070
So sweet.

103
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:28,290
Who do you think he's talking to?

104
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:31,300
Why didn't you worry about me when I had stomach disease?

105
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,030
Yes.

106
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,330
Ruk, I have something to ask you.

107
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:35,690
[What is it?]

108
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:39,480
Why did you text me?

109
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,980
Does it have anything to do with your sighing?

110
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:49,300
It's nothing.

111
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,730
Okay, I'm hanging up.

112
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:55,630
[Dino.]

113
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:57,000
What?

114
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:58,960
Thank you.

115
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:00,850
Okay.

116
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:04,630
Call me if you feel lonely.

117
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,620
I'm busy too.

118
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:07,690
I feel lonely.

119
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,140
But I can make time for you.

120
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:10,910
I'm lonely too.
I'm lonely too.

121
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:12,530
So lonely.

122
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:14,450
That's it
I'm so lonely.

123
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:15,390
A dog is barking.

124
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,390
What?

125
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,270
Have some water.

126
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:22,430
So who is it?

127
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:23,020
Who is it?

128
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:23,710
It's sweeter than a drink.

129
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,290
Mind your own business.

130
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:26,600
Will life be better if you know?

131
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:30,100
It's a good thing
I have to know.

132
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:37,890
Hey, guys.

133
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:41,840
Have Meck and Caan's popularity dropped lately?

134
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,780
Mind your own business.

135
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:45,100
Mind your study first.

136
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,310
I'm curious.

137
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:49,550
Study hard.

138
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,000
Can you graduate?

139
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:52,540
I'm curious.

140
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:53,480
How long will you graduate?

141
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:58,060
Look at him. He doesn't feel good.

142
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,270
Ask him if he's okay.

143
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,460
Ruk, are you okay?

144
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,200
Why do you look so down?

145
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,490
It's okay.

146
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:13,080
Guys,

147
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:18,550
I think...

148
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,780
I want to transfer.

149
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:23,710
Really?

150
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:25,390
Are you transferring?
Are you transferring?

151
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:26,520
Where are you transferring to?

152
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:28,400
Did something happen to you?

153
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:31,220
I think there is.

154
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:33,630
Can I ask you about Caran and Meck?

155
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:36,270
You, Meck, Caran.

156
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:39,679
Which one of the three is a couple?

157
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,789
I was confused.

158
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:43,240
I saw you were having a good time with Caran.

159
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:46,160
But why did you get distant?

160
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:55,280
Actually, Meck and I are dating.

161
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:58,560
Oh my god.

162
00:08:58,890 --> 00:08:59,570
Calm down.

163
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,680
But it's okay.

164
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,510
You have us.

165
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:07,600
No matter which college you go, we'll always be there.

166
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:08,980
Yes, don't think too much.

167
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:14,890
Oh my god! Help me!

168
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,630
Are you dating Meck?

169
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:17,730
Transfer again?

170
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:19,630
Work and project.

171
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,820
With whom?

172
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,880
Can you help me, goldfish?

173
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,130
goldfish, can you help me?

174
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:27,990
Hey, wait for me!

175
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:29,550
Don't leave me alone.

176
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:31,020
Come back.

177
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:34,700
[Dino.]

178
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,050
[Is the instant noodles ready?]

179
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:37,630
Not yet.

180
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:40,390
I'm covering it with a plate. I want to soften the noodles.

181
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:43,020
[Are you crazy? Why are you eating so soft?]

182
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:43,940
I'm hungry.

183
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:46,540
Eat first if you're hungry.

184
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,270
[I want to eat with you.]

185
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:49,350
[Why? Is there a problem?]

186
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,520
Bro my instant noodles are ready

187
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,060
I'll eat ramen first.

188
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,460
You can eat now.

189
00:09:58,430 --> 00:09:59,350
Okay.

190
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:01,090
Ruk.

191
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:01,800
Ruk.

192
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,380
Are you there?

193
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:04,590
Ruk.

194
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:05,380
Ruk.

195
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,090
Ruk, I'm going to faint.

196
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:08,790
Sister Parter.

197
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:09,430
What?

198
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,710
I have something urgent.

199
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:14,380
Your friend You told me to keep it a secret from him.

200
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,830
He's covered in blood.

201
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,110
And the wound.

202
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:20,740
I'm really worried that he might take it too hard.

203
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:23,160
I called an ambulance, but he didn't want to go.

204
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,550
Can you take a look?

205
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,850
Okay.

206
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:27,870
I'll go down with you.

207
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:28,520
Let's go.

208
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,280
Let's go now.

209
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:30,680
[Dino.]

210
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,350
Oh no.

211
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:31,730
There can't be ghosts in my building.

212
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:32,770
We can't sell it anyway.

213
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:33,380
Let's go.

214
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:34,050
Ruk Ruk.

215
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:34,850
This way. Hurry.

216
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:36,810
Look at your friend! Tell him to stop!

217
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:37,970
Tell him to stop!

218
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:39,830
Tell him to stop!

219
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:41,330
[Chaan committed suicide in Thailand]

220
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:41,330
[Are you crazy? Caran is hurting herself.]

221
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,300
Oh no.

222
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:42,550
[He's a celebrity. He can watch the live stream.]
[Caran self-harm]

223
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:46,100
[It's an explosive news. Kaan self-harm.]

224
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:46,840
Ruk.

225
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,460
You came to see me.

226
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:50,070
Caran.

227
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,340
Why did you do that?

228
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,030
Can I hug you?

229
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:58,330
Take him to the hospital.

230
00:10:58,330 --> 00:10:58,980
Let's go.

231
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,440
Let's go to the hospital.

232
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,100
Ruk.

233
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:02,660
It's okay.

234
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:03,270
Let's go.

235
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:04,310
Go back to your room.

236
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,010
Go back to your rooms.

237
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:06,780
Let's go.

238
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:10,920
Calm down.

239
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:15,850
Someone needs to get in.

240
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:16,890
I'll go with him.

241
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:20,220
Everyone, go back. It's okay.

242
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:20,840
It's okay.

243
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,440
Let's go.

244
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,480
Go back to your room.

245
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:24,950
Let's go.

246
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:52,480
Ruk.

247
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:57,780
Dino.

248
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,730
Why are you here?

249
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,590
You didn't hang up.

250
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,620
Did anyone hurt you?

251
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,490
Ruk.

252
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:10,600
No one hurts me.

253
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:11,580
Ruk, answer me.

254
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,310
Tell me.

255
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,300
Just say it.

256
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:19,690
Because of me.

257
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,300
Tell me.

258
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:26,890
I caused Caran to cut his wrist.

259
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:28,680
Listen to me.

260
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,470
It's not because of you.

261
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,390
Don't blame yourself so foolishly.

262
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:36,600
You didn't cut his wrist with a knife.

263
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:37,930
Did you ask him to do that?

264
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,820
What your friend did is hurting people.

265
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,430
But if your friend

266
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:47,980
hurt himself because you alienated him,

267
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,920
It's not your fault.

268
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:52,930
Don't think too much. Be rational.

269
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:57,530
The moment I met you

270
00:12:57,530 --> 00:13:04,710
You make my heart float into you

271
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,790
Thank you, Dino.

272
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:09,060
The moment I saw you...

273
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:09,720
Do you remember what I said to you?

274
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:17,650
ϙ always so special Thank you for coming to me.

275
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,750
When no one is by your side

276
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:13,240
you still have me.

277
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,920
I'm ready to protect you.

278
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:17,340
Even if I have to fight them,

279
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:29,950
[I can't see the drama I want to watch.] [An insane actor]

280
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:29,950
[The trending topic in Thailand]

281
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:31,620
[I think it's true.]

282
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:43,500
[Mekkaan is done.] A crazy actor.

283
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:41,570
Kaan, you're awake.

284
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,050
Let me go home.

285
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:48,900
I'm fine. I'm fine.

286
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:51,230
The doctor doesn't allow you to go home yet.

287
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:54,730
Are you bored?

288
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:58,700
No, I want to see Ruk.

289
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,020
I called him for you.

290
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:03,170
Your friend is coming tomorrow.

291
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,470
Ruk.

292
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:08,260
Is he really coming?

293
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:10,700
Yes.

294
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:17,280
My dad said I was crazy.

295
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:20,740
The doctor won't allow me to go back, right?

296
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:25,370
Then why didn't you send me to a mental hospital?

297
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:28,300
What am I supposed to do here?

298
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,710
Look at these wounds.

299
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:40,700
It's pretty, right?

300
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:43,970
But

301
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:48,900
It'll be prettier if there's blood. It'll be prettier.

302
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:51,780
Caran.

303
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:59,000
If there's blood, it'll be prettier.

304
00:14:59,000 --> 00:14:59,740
Right?

305
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:24,440
Surprise!

306
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,150
Meck.

307
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:28,980
Ruk, why did you close the door?

308
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:31,660
I'm here to make things clear.

309
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:33,280
Let's talk.

310
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:35,640
I promise I won't hurt you.

311
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:39,130
Okay.

312
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:49,680
Ruk.

313
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:51,980
How have you been?

314
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:54,460
Is something wrong?

315
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,510
No, I just miss you.

316
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:00,280
Meck! Meck!

317
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,580
Meck, are you drunk?

318
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:03,760
Stay still.

319
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,850
Meck.
What?

320
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:08,820
It's not like I haven't done it before.

321
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:10,180
Meck, stop!

322
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,280
What's wrong, Ruk?

323
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:11,850
Meck.

324
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:19,110
You had a relationship with that bastard, didn't you?

325
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:22,950
Meck! Meck!

326
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:28,840
Meck!

327
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:30,330
What's wrong, Ruk?

328
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:32,590
You liked it when we were together.

329
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:34,410
Meck.

330
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:36,590
What?

331
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:38,930
You like it.

332
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:43,360
How far have you gone with that jerk?

333
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:46,280
I don't think it's just a hug.

334
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:49,710
So you hate me now?

335
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:52,480
We had a relationship.

336
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,130
Stop pretending.

337
00:16:58,190 --> 00:16:58,730
Tell me.

338
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:04,680
You knew everything, right?

339
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:06,540
I was terminated.

340
00:17:09,369 --> 00:17:10,400
Your best friend, Caran.

341
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,819
Can't wait to tell you, right?

342
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,240
Because of the video that that jerk sent,

343
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:17,569
all the partnership brands terminated their contract with me.

344
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:20,089
Because of that video,

345
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:22,420
because of that video?

346
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:24,849
I lost everything

347
00:17:24,849 --> 00:17:26,960
everything I've built over the past few years.

348
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:30,800
But your best friend doesn't feel guilty at all.

349
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:32,620
Do you know why?

350
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,830
Because he doesn't like this industry.

351
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:40,280
But there's one thing I'm happy about.

352
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:44,510
Do you know what it is?

353
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:46,260
I don't know.

354
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:48,600
I don't want to know either.

355
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,230
Stop pestering me, okay?

356
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:52,210
Why can't I?

357
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:56,470
Without you and your friends,

358
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:59,720
my life wouldn't have been a mess.

359
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:02,320
But I never hurt you.

360
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,430
You didn't hurt me, but your friend hurt me.

361
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:08,650
Let go of me!

362
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,010
Don't cry.

363
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:20,080
I just told you what I wanted to say.

364
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:28,890
At first, I was mad at your friend.

365
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:31,720
But I'm not angry anymore.

366
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:33,530
Do you know why?

367
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:39,960
Because he's going to hell.

368
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:42,010
Do you think

369
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:43,920
we won't waste what he has done?

370
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,060
It's not wasted, right?

371
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:45,960
Tell me.

372
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:49,940
Are you scared? Are you crying?

373
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:56,090
Don't be scared.

374
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:00,440
Don't cry.

375
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,160
My life is ruined. I haven't cried yet.

376
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:09,600
What about your life?

377
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,040
Being with your new husband

378
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,310
with your new husband, right?

379
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,260
Really?

380
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:18,300
Then tell me what's good about him.

381
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:20,840
Tell me what's good about him.

382
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,250
Is he good?

383
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:24,410
Is he good?

384
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:25,200
No.

385
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:27,980
Have I

386
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,200
to get to know me?

387
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:34,390
I have nothing to do with anyone else.

388
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:35,920
If I want to be with someone else,

389
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:38,650
I won't do it after I break up with you.

390
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,770
Do you know why I broke up with you?

391
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:44,390
Because you jerk.

392
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:47,570
Everything that happened.

393
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:51,020
you caused

394
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:54,000
it's all your fault.

395
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:56,380
Don't blame others, okay?

396
00:19:58,190 --> 00:19:59,350
As for Caran,

397
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:02,230
I don't know what happened between you two.

398
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:05,210
but you two have been getting along well.

399
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:07,890
Then ask him.

400
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:10,540
Ask your friend what he did.

401
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:12,210
Why did he do that?

402
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:14,960
You're the only fool.

403
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,030
I thought he was your best friend.

404
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:20,600
Get your hands off me!

405
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:33,990
You call me a jerk?

406
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:36,190
You called me a jerk, right?

407
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:41,870
You always surprise me.

408
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:44,770
It's okay.

409
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:46,330
Let's not waste time.

410
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:49,730
Since you said

411
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:51,990
you have nothing to do with that jerk.

412
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:55,260
Fine.

413
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,440
I don't want to share you with anyone.

414
00:20:57,730 --> 00:20:58,700
Meck, stop!

415
00:20:59,330 --> 00:20:59,930
Meck!

416
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:00,790
Fight back!

417
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:02,200
Meck.
Go ahead.

418
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,510
Meck!
Then you won't have the strength

419
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,280
you won't have the strength to fight back.

420
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:05,820
Meck!

421
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:07,930
Meck!

422
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:08,970
Meck!

423
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,020
Meck!

424
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:13,570
Meck! Meck!

425
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,850
Hello, is anyone here?

426
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:19,780
Don't make a sound.

427
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:23,210
[Ruk]

428
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:24,710
Be quiet.

429
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:30,910
Hello, Sister Parter. Do you want to talk about the contract?

430
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:31,760
Help!

431
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:35,400
[Oh, tomorrow too.]

432
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,040
Be quiet.

433
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:40,880
Meck!

434
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:43,840
Ruk, stop!

435
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:44,770
Stop!

436
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:51,390
Ruk, stop!

437
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:52,720
I told you to stop!

438
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:55,840
Ruk.

439
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,470
Ruk.

440
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,140
Ruk, don't run.

441
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:05,930
I'm sorry, Ruk.

442
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:08,000
I didn't mean it.

443
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,210
Why did you run just now?

444
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:20,640
Dino!

445
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:28,340
Hey.

446
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:30,700
You don't look bad either.

447
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,880
Can't you find yourself a boyfriend?

448
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:34,820
You want to steal someone else's boyfriend?

449
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:36,290
Who's your boyfriend?

450
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:38,860
Ruk is my boyfriend.

451
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:40,200
We started dating since grade 12.

452
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:43,730
Were you surprised? He didn't tell you, did he?

453
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:45,260
Because he's a playboy.

454
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:47,220
I want to have you and me at the same time.

455
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:49,560
You jerk!

456
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:51,500
Let go of me!

457
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,200
Stop shouting. Annoying.

458
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,430
Let go of me!

459
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:55,500
I'm going to call the police.

460
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:57,650
Let me tell you.

461
00:22:58,130 --> 00:23:01,500
Ruk hates gangs making trouble.

462
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:03,970
He won't like you.

463
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:05,090
Darn it.

464
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:07,370
You look so great. Come on.

465
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:08,560
Hit me again.

466
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,230
Ruk will hate you.

467
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:12,240
Hit me. Hit me.

468
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:15,460
Come on. Hit me.

469
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:18,500
Ruk hurt me.
Shut up.

470
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:20,540
Before I throw you down the stairs.

471
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:21,700
Come on.

472
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,520
Stop!

473
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:27,270
You should thank him for letting you escape.

474
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:29,850
Just you wait.

475
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,870
What are you looking at? None of your business.

476
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,280
No.
Ruk, it's me.

477
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:43,300
Don't touch me.

478
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:53,940
Ruk, it's me.

479
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:55,600
I'm Dino.

480
00:23:57,010 --> 00:23:57,770
It hurts.

481
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,680
Where are you hurt?

482
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,710
I can date you.

483
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,870
Be my boyfriend, Dino.

484
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:20,940
I'll take what you're saying

485
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,700
as your nonsense that has lost your mind.

486
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:32,440
I'm here. Don't be afraid.

487
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:39,660
It's me. He's gone.

488
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:44,180
Ruk, look at me.

489
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,060
He's not doing well.

490
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:57,940
How is Caran?

491
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,830
He took his medicine and went to bed.

492
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:07,720
I thought his condition would be worse if he was discharged.

493
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:10,890
I heard he was terminated by the brand.

494
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:16,720
Last night, he called Ruk's name in his dream.

495
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:20,090
Yes. I'm worried about him.

496
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:26,730
Hello, I'm here to see Caran.

497
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:29,990
I'm leaving. Go home after you see him.

498
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,450
Are you Ruk?

499
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:34,180
Yes.

500
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:38,550
Caran must be happy to see you.

501
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,400
But he's taking medicine and resting.

502
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,260
Are you going to wait for him?

503
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:47,320
Forget it.

504
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:50,800
My friend is waiting for me.

505
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,250
Okay.

506
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:56,050
Tell Caran to take good care of himself.

507
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,700
I brought him a fruit basket.

508
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:03,880
Okay, give it to me.
Thank you.

509
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:06,860
Let's go.

510
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:13,770
Let's go to school. Okay.

511
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:14,780
Okay.

512
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:17,430
Do you want to eat something first?

513
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:21,280
Dino.

514
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:23,030
What is it?

515
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:27,190
I want to go to the same college as you.

516
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:30,940
and do what I like.

517
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:31,690
Okay.

518
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,210
Can you tutor me?

519
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:37,720
Of course. It's nothing.

520
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:39,240
I'll help you.

521
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:42,690
Thank you.

522
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:45,240
Let's go.

523
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,780
Ask me if you don't understand.

524
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:07,120
Why did you bring me here?

525
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:11,190
It's quiet.

526
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:14,650
I like this place.

527
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:18,420
You're different from what I thought.

528
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:19,650
How?

529
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:22,340
I don't know.

530
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,940
I thought you were like that.

531
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:26,940
But I didn't.

532
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:29,030
Is this good?

533
00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:32,370
Pretty good, right?

534
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,860
Do you like me more?

535
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:47,900
I'll wait.

536
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,850
I'm sorry.

537
00:27:57,330 --> 00:27:58,780
Are you hungry?

538
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:00,830
What do you want to eat?

539
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:04,510
Just a little.

540
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:06,980
What about you? Are you hungry?

541
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:08,560
What do you want to eat?

542
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:12,660
I want sushi. Can you eat it?

543
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:15,540
Anything. Just eat what you want.

544
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,180
Okay.

545
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,480
Why are you laughing?

546
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:28,760
Look at that rabbit. It looks like you.

547
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:35,360
Rabbit?

548
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,040
I don't think so.

549
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:42,990
I just raised this rabbit.

550
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:45,120
What?

551
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:47,780
It was abandoned by its owner.

552
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,560
and hurt.

553
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:51,320
I like that rabbit.

554
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:53,520
But it doesn't seem to like me.

555
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,190
Because its old owner scared it.

556
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:00,660
I don't think it doesn't mean it doesn't like you.

557
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:02,240
Really?

558
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:05,020
There's hope now.

559
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:09,900
You just need to wait until it's healed by the old owner.

560
00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:13,630
The old owner should be beaten.

561
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,660
He didn't take good care of it and hurt it.

562
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:20,920
Keep doing it.

563
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,760
How to do it here?

564
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:25,470
Just add a variable here.

00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:33,070
[Thailand hot search: Meck, Caran]

566
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:35,030
[I can't accept it, Meck, Caran.]

567
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:38,990
[Why did Meck do that, Mek, Caran?]

568
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:48,900
Get up, Meck.

569
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:51,980
You can go now. We're closing.

570
00:29:56,390 --> 00:29:58,360
You should admit

571
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:01,700
If you know you're wrong, just admit it.

572
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,410
What's the use of drinking?

573
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:06,050
Nothing will change, Meck.

574
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:07,460
The scandal won't disappear.

575
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:11,070
Apologize.

576
00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:13,640
That's all.

577
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:17,490
You won't listen to me?

578
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:21,010
The shop is closed. You can go back now.

579
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,540
Go home.

580
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:28,250
I want to be alone.

581
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:35,390
The scandal

582
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:37,810
The company has clarified it for you.

583
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:40,880
That was the video before you entered the entertainment industry.

584
00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:45,310
Just admit it and apologize.

585
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:48,230
Many fans are ready to forgive you.

586
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,570
It's too late, sister.

587
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,320
It's all ruined!

588
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,310
Nothing's ruined, Meck.

589
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:18,360
If you apologize, it's over.

590
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:21,940
You should go.

591
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:27,260
You still have a lot of kids to take care of in the company.

592
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,580
Don't waste your time

593
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:34,200
I'm an actress

594
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,970
who doesn't get popular because of a scandal.

595
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:42,610
I'm sorry to disappoint you.

596
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,950
Listen, I've never been disappointed in you.

597
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:52,340
The scandal

598
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:54,720
never let me down.

599
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:57,240
But what disappointed me is

600
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,990
if you don't fight,

601
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,640
You'd rather give up everything.

602
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:08,260
You know, there are many actors who enter the entertainment industry

603
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:10,300
about women.

604
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:14,090
But it's okay because of acting

605
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:16,680
You and I

606
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,450
You're my beloved brother

607
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:24,670
Do you remember?

608
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:27,630
What did you say on the first audition?

609
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:29,160
I wanted to do it.

610
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:30,880
You can do it now.

611
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:32,500
Yes.

612
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:35,430
Let's start over, Meck.

613
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:37,390
It's not too late.

614
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:41,580
You're talented.

615
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:47,510
When someone falls, you just need to stand up.

616
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:50,600
If you get pushed down,

617
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:52,870
I'll pull you up.

618
00:32:57,110 --> 00:32:59,190
No one has never fallen down.

619
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:04,130
Only losers never fight.

620
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:06,090
Do you want to clarify it?

621
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:08,440
Yes.

622
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,260
I'll take you to clarify it.

623
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:18,780
Come on, baby.

624
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,070
Let's go home.

625
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,210
Hello, Dino.

626
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,240
Why did you ask me to come to the hotel?

627
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:54,680
Are we really tutoring here?

628
00:33:56,650 --> 00:33:58,330
[Yes. Sit down and wait for me.]

629
00:33:58,330 --> 00:33:59,280
[I'll be right down.]

630
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:02,250
OK.

631
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:33,630
[Dino is wearing a suit to tutor me.]

632
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,650
[Do I have to dress up so grandly?]

633
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:40,230
[Is he...]

634
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:41,760
What do you think?

635
00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:46,940
Dino, why are you wearing a suit?

636
00:34:48,370 --> 00:34:51,340
Don't say you work here.

637
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:52,730
Part-time job?

638
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:54,610
Please sign the documents.

639
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:05,090
Thank you.

640
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:08,610
I'm just working for my dad.

641
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:11,410
I'm here to supervise my employees, so I need to dress formally.

642
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:14,020
This is...

643
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:15,800
My hotel.

644
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:17,200
Yes.

645
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:21,060
Let's go. Do you want to study?

646
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:22,500
Yes.

647
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:23,880
Let's go.

648
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:33,820
The first question is right.

649
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:36,190
As for the second question,

650
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:39,380
You have to change the number here.

651
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:41,030
The formula is right.

652
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:44,880
The rest should be fine.

653
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:46,820
Do you understand?

654
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:52,690
You know what?

655
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:54,200
You didn't even blink at me today.

656
00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:58,180
I just find it strange.

657
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:00,580
Because I'm wearing a suit?

658
00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:02,710
Yeah.

659
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:05,380
What, Usako?

660
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:07,460
Am I handsome?

661
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:12,580
Aren't you going to change?

662
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:14,000
Why should I?

663
00:36:14,410 --> 00:36:15,830
Why are you staring at me like that?

664
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,030
I won't change it so easily.

665
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:21,790
You can change it.

666
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,420
You make me shy.

667
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:25,650
Or do you want to change it for me?

668
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:29,080
You should change it yourself.

669
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:32,020
Okay. Wait here.

670
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,060
I'm leaving.

671
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:36,690
Wait here.

672
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:55,100
When can we date

673
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:57,820
I hope the stars and the moon can fall in love with you

674
00:36:57,820 --> 00:37:00,690
(Every time I see you, I smile)

675
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:03,210
You look the same

676
00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:06,110
I don't think I'm thinking too much

677
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:07,110
You're good at...

678
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:10,900
I miss you day and night

679
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:15,620
I miss you every day

680
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:19,570
Dino.

681
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:20,200
Yes.

682
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:25,340
Every time I like you,

683
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:27,100
I fold a star and put it in a can.

684
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:29,330
It's fun.

685
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:32,860
But if you make me unhappy,

686
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:34,930
I'll take three out.

687
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:36,960
Hey, no.

688
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,040
Stop cheating.

689
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:40,240
I only asked you to take one out.

690
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:42,960
Okay.

691
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,060
Can we date if it's full?

692
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:49,440
I have to fill it up first.

693
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,870
Can I fold it myself?

694
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:53,590
It'll be full tomorrow.

695
00:37:55,570 --> 00:37:56,720
No.

696
00:37:58,090 --> 00:37:58,920
Why not?

697
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:05,560
Do you like me today?

698
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:15,770
Dino.

699
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:22,300
I have an appointment with a friend. I have to go now.

700
00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:23,460
I'll get going.

701
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:26,320

706
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:38,770
What happened?

707
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:42,420
He's gone, you bastard.

708
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:43,670
Did you go on a date?

709
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,170
No.

710
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,620
Stop pretending.

711
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:49,980
I can tell.

712
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,230
I don't have a date.

713
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:00,650
Only rabbits.

714
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:04,310
What rabbit?

715
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:06,450
Why did you drink mine?

716
00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:07,870
There are so many cups.

717
00:39:07,870 --> 00:39:08,820
Can't I?

718
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:11,440
What?

719
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:13,920
By the way, where are Ban and Ku?

But...

723
00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:21,850
I don't know.

724
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,000
Look, he's haunting me.

[But you don't have to come. It's okay.]

730
00:39:45,970 --> 00:39:46,890
Wait for me there.

731
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,810

(Every time I see you, I smile)

752
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,440
You look the same

753
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,630
I don't think I'm thinking too much.

[Small Theater Dino's Truth]

755
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:23,030
Yes.

756
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:25,590
You know what?

757
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:28,890
Ever since Ruk looked at me like that,

758
00:41:29,270 --> 00:41:33,250
I want to wear a suit every day.

759
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:37,220
But it's hot in Thailand.

760
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:39,020
It's crazy to wear it every day.

761
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:44,290
There's one more thing I'm interested in.

762
00:41:44,290 --> 00:41:45,720
A star can.

763
00:41:47,810 --> 00:41:50,100
Whenever Ruk likes me,

764
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:52,360
he folds a star and put it in.

765
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:55,590
When it's full, I can be his boyfriend.

766
00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:57,320
That's right.

767
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,670
Think about it.

768
00:42:00,990 --> 00:42:03,270
If someone you like does this for you,

769
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:04,600
it would be nice.

770
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:06,660
You're jealous of me, right?

771
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:12,440
You want to make trouble with our store so much, right?

772
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,530
Who did you come with, Ruk?

773
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,240
His name is Dino.

774
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:19,820
He's my senior at the school I'm transferring to.

775
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:22,290
Hello.

776
00:42:23,490 --> 00:42:24,490
Can I come in?

777
00:42:24,770 --> 00:42:25,280
What?

778
00:42:25,490 --> 00:42:29,210
[Missed Scene]

779
00:42:30,070 --> 00:42:31,110
Are you hurt anywhere else?

780
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:36,280
It hurts. Can you be gentle?

781
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:39,420
Iced first. It's comfortable.

782
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:41,330
Here

783
00:42:42,390 --> 00:42:43,170
Goodness.

784
00:42:49,210 --> 00:42:51,260
I'll get you some medicine later.

785
00:42:54,550 --> 00:42:55,470
Put it on.

786
00:42:59,730 --> 00:43:01,120
Can you come back soon?

787
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:03,470
Are you scared?

788
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:04,730
What did he do to you?

789
00:43:08,010 --> 00:43:09,020
Nothing.

790
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:10,780
What did you do?

791
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:17,990
I just want these traces to disappear.

792
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:21,280
I don't like them.

793
00:43:22,110 --> 00:43:23,820
Don't hurt yourself.

794
00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:29,150
I just want them to disappear.

795
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:32,820
Don't move.

796
00:43:34,130 --> 00:43:35,190
Dino.

797
00:43:36,490 --> 00:43:37,140
What is it?

798
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:41,350
I'm sorry.

799
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:46,170
I made you upset.

800
00:43:46,470 --> 00:43:47,640
I'm glad you know.

801
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:49,680
I'm telling you, I don't like it.

802
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:51,570
But if I hear it again,

803
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:53,530
I don't know what I'll do.

804
00:43:54,530 --> 00:43:55,730
Are you going to hit me?

805
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:57,530
Stop talking.

806
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:02,920
Laugh if you want.

807
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:07,300
I'm not laughing.

808
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:08,080
You smiled.

809
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:10,480
What?

810
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:12,330
What if I smile?

811
00:44:13,650 --> 00:44:14,890
You scare me like a rabbit.

812
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:17,950
I'm not a rabbit.

813
00:44:19,130 --> 00:44:19,630
Yeah.

814
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:22,450
You haven't told me yet.

815
00:44:22,450 --> 00:44:24,290
What will you do if I smile?

816
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:26,970
If you smile,

817
00:44:27,830 --> 00:44:28,940
I might not be able to control myself.

818
00:44:30,290 --> 00:44:31,310
Dino.

819
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:34,730
I'm leaving. Wait here.

820
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:38,230
Come back soon.
