1
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:34,720
What's up?

2
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:36,080
Rak.

3
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,100
Why you took so long to pick up my call?

4
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:39,720
I have something to talk to you about.

5
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:44,790
I wasn't on my phone when you called.

6
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,200
So, I didn't hear it.

7
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,590
Your voice is breaking.

8
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,150
Are you alright?

9
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:52,730
Are you crying?

10
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:54,450
What did Mek do to you?

11
00:00:58,310 --> 00:00:59,680
I'm not crying.

12
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:02,700
Mek's already left.

13
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:04,890
He said he'll sleep at his place.

14
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:06,680
Really?

15
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,580
Never mind.

16
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,670
Who took you home?

17
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:14,530
So hot.

18
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:18,360
I told Mek to ask you, not sure if he already did.

19
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,600
You sent him a picture?

20
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:24,920
Yeah.

21
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,180
Who is he?

22
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:30,510
You know him?

23
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,850
He's hotter than Mek.

24
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:33,650
Are you having an affair?

25
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:35,920
I never do that.

26
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:38,789
You should know me better.

27
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:40,220
I'm just kidding.

28
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:42,800
You're being too serious.

29
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:45,020
I'm serious.

30
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,759
You want to know who is that person.

31
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:51,070
And you asked Mek.

32
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:53,910
Don't you think I'll have problem with Mek?

33
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,430
Umm.

34
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,810
I'm asking you right now.

35
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:01,370
Are you guys fight?

36
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:04,380
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.

37
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:12,340
Kram.

38
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,360
Have you ever feel truly sorry?

39
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,440
You don't have to say it if you don't really feel it.

40
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:24,310
I got to go.

41
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:49,530
"fried chicken delivery man is so handsome :)"

42
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:01,020

OMG! A celebrity!

83
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,140
It's See-kram!

84
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:44,700
The one who played a series with Mek.

85
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,320
They're an imagined couple!

86
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,880
Aww he's so cute! I like him!

87
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:53,640
Hello, Rak?

88
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,040
Hello.

89
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,180
What's happening?

90
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,780
Mek wants to talk to you.

91
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,600
I guess he wanna make up with you.

92
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:05,000
But let him be.

93
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,260
Let's go eat something.

94
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:10,920
I'm going to talk to Mek.

95
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,100
Where is he?

96
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,840
Men's bathroom on the 3rd floor.

97
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,480
You should come along.

98
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,880
It might be a good news for you, too.

99
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:27,720
Really?

100
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,240
Rak, you know See-kram?

101
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,360
He's cute. I really like him!

102
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:41,780
Guys.

103
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:42,860
I'll be right back.

104
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,420
Where are you going?

105
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,980
You aren't going to have lunch with us?

106
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:52,140
Aww I'm still on cloud nine! // You're dramatic.

107
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:54,420
I like him. He's so lovely.

108
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,000
Normally I can only follow him on Twitter,

109
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,520
but today I got to see the real deal!

110
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,280
I don't even know him. Do you?

111
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:15,680
Rak.

112
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:18,160
What took you so long?

113
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:26,620
So...

114
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,420
I want to apologize about last night.

115
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,480
I know I was unreasonable.

116
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:40,820
I'm sorry.

117
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,320
Please don't be angry, Rak.

118
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:46,980
Mek.

119
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,120
Mek.

120
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:53,659
Can you stop apologizing if you don't really feel sorry?

121
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,540
Rak.

122
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,680
Are you going to cheat on me?

123
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,540
If that's what you think about me,

124
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,560
we should break up.

125
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:15,520
I... No! Don't do this!

126
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:18,320
I'm so sorry.

127
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,520
I won't blame you anymore.

128
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:24,060
Please don't break up with me.

129
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,039
We've been together for 3 years, Rak.

130
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,419
Please, Rak?

131
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,900
About Kram,

132
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,160
I really see him as just a friend.

133
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,000
It's just... he tried to get closer to me.

134
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,420
But I have no feelings for him.

135
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,260
So, can you swear...

136
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:01,100
that you've never slept with Kram?

137
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:07,980
Well.

138
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:09,940
I...

139
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:13,920
It's not my intention.

140
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:16,840
Like...

141
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:20,980
It's Kram fault! He started it, Rak!

142
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:26,280
Stop blaming others, Mek.

143
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,120
Let's break up.

144
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:33,900
I said no, Rak.

145
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:36,440
Please, Rak, don't do this.

146
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,600
Can we stay together?

147
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,500
you guys finally break up.

148
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,860
It's a good news indeed, Rak.

149
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,020
If this is what you want,

150
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,160
congratulations.

151
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:02,880
You're mad at me?

152
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,800
Don't look at me like that.

153
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,300
Rak!

154
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,360
About Mek...

155
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,580
If you want him that bad, take him.

156
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,620
But the cost is our friendship.

157
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,820
It's ended here.

158
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,240
I wish you'll be happy after this.

159
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,420
I won't be angry,

160
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:40,440
nor resent you.

161
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,500
From now on,

162
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:47,320
You and Mek

163
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,940
will no longer exist in my world.

164
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,320
Rak!

165
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,800
Dino, did you go to class late?

166
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,260
Naturally.

167
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,000
Since I drank alcohol waiting for your reply all night.

168
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:24,320
Never mind. I'm always late.

169
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,620
Another day wouldn't kill.

170
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,880
It's not my fault.

171
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:34,760
I didn't blame you.

172
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:37,740
Hey, can I ask you something?

173
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,360
Have you changed your profile pic?

174
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,000
Yes.

175
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,060
Can I ask?

176
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,560
About what?

177
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:51,000
The profile pic?

178
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,220
Why on earth are you so cute?!

179
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:57,360
Can I call you?

180
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:03,220
Hello, Rak.

181
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,920
Whatcha doin'? It's so loud.

182
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,500
I'm at the football field.

183
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,340
Oh? You can play football?

184
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:14,360
I'm just waiting for my friend.

185
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,600
I thought it was your boyfriend.

186
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:18,560
Huh?

187
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,520
Nothing!

188
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:24,880
Dino.

189
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,700
About why I changed my profile pic black...

190
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,340
Actually,

191
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:38,020
I... don't want to tell anyone yet.

192
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,600
because

193
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,320
I just broke up with my boyfriend.

194
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,980
Ha? You did?

195
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,020
Yes.

196
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:51,020
But...

197
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,820
I'm still not ready to love again.

198
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,680
Then... I gotta go.

199
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,040
Yes.

200
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,560
How is it? It seems serious.

201
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:22,280
Hey, boys! You came!

202
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,020
We're freaking tired playing football.

203
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,480
And It's been just 45 minutes!

204
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,280
We're getting old. // So exhausted.

205
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,360
Want some Ichitan?

206
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,960
Fresh and cool drink for both of you.

207
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,960
Sounds great!

208
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:36,660
Let's have a taste.

209
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:45,860
Ah, so refreshing!

210
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,860
Oh, do you have any plans tonight?

211
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:50,960
Let's drink.

212
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:51,540
Will you?

213
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,660
Tonight? Sure!

214
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,940
Good. Do you need a ride?

215
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:00,920
It's the same place. I think you can come by yourself.

216
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,940
Then I'll go by myself. I also need to change clothes.

217
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:08,500
Call me when you arrive, so I can tell you where we sit.

218
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,420
Got it? // Um.

219
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,420
Let's get back to our game.

220
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:12,140
Yeah.

221
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,700
Hold on! I think I can't make it tonight.

222
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:21,240
He said I partied too much. He's kind of... jealous.

223
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,220
Again?

224
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,920
Certainly. I'm a queen after all.

225
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:27,580
Go ahead. I'm not going this time.

226
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,380
You abandoned us again.

227
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,580
Let's go. // Fine.

228
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,020
Good bye.

229
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:33,180
Back to the game.

230
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:47,820
You can leave it here. Thank you.

231
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:51,540
Hey.

232
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,640
Didn't you say you're not coming?

233
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:55,280
I broke up with him!

234
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:59,020
Why so fast!? You were just together!

235
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:03,060
I still played the dating app and so did he. That's it.

236
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,020
Don't bother.

237
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:09,780
I'm pissed. // You got dumped.

238
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:12,720
Rak.

239
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:14,420
Can I ask you a question?

240
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,420
Is your friend, See-kram, single?

241
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,740
Tos wanna know.

242
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,040
Go ask him.

243
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:26,400
I heard he's very arrogant.

244
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:27,540
Celebrities are.

245
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:30,600
As far as I know, he replies to no one.

246
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,040
Many of the guys at our campus texted him,

247
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,400
but they got no respond.

248
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:35,720
Celebrities, you know?

249
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:40,640
But if you meet him in person, he'll greet you.

250
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:41,980
Maybe he's just trying to be polite.

251
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,360
I bet.

252
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:45,980
Rak, do you want a refill?

253
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,980
Let me help you.

254
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:54,440
Come on.

255
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,280
Rak~

256
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,700
You still mad at me?

257
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,860
Please talk to me. Pretty please?

258
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:22,020
Normally, you'll be upset for just a short time.

259
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,640
Why is it so long this time?

260
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,020
Don't you love me anymore?

261
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,600
Go find Mek if you're drunk.

262
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:35,980
Stay away from me.

263
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:39,620
Nooo.

264
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,700
Why should I go to him?

265
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,460
Chasing me like this... you're still mad at me?

266
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,540
Then,

267
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,540
I'll meet you tomorrow.

268
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:51,540
Let's have a meal together.

269
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,060
Hey, Rak.

270
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:57,520
Tell me if See-kram texts you.

271
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,880
I want to be friends with a celebrity.

272
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:02,800
You're always like this. // What?

273
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,460
So, from what you said...

274
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:11,819
you're now single.

275
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:13,819
Don't reconcile with your ex.

276
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,240
Move on.

277
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:22,640
Close your heart as long as you want.

278
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:24,960
But if you're ready to open it up again,

279
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:26,960
I must be the first man you think of.

280
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,400
I hope it won't take you a year, though.

281
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,280
Else I'll force myself on you.

282
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,460
The leading actor could wait.

283
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,460
But I can't.

284
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,440
Let's have a toast.

285
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:45,060
Come on.

286
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,960
It's worth sightseeing around here.

287
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,560
'Let go. Go out to find inspiration.' // I should come some times.

288
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:56,980
Where the heck are they by the way?

289
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,460
So slow!

290
00:17:58,920 --> 00:17:59,900
Do they have something with the potty?

291
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,040
Freaking slow.

292
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:05,600
Your poop stinks!

293
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,840
I could smell it from miles away!

294
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,300
I'm letting it all out! // It smells like death.

295
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:12,360
Ha!

296
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,960
Does your poop smells like lavender, then?

297
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,920
It's not as bad as yours.

298
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:19,940
It's too much, really.

299
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,520
Rak, what are you looking at?

300
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,920
Heyy, you wanna play the guitar, don't you?

301
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:26,720
I do.

302
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,160
Woah, don't tease him.

303
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:32,380
How about you? Do you wanna play the guitar or...?

304
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:34,800
Why Can't I play with fire?

305
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:35,820
Hahaha.

306
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:37,820
Sassy.

307
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,620
Anyway, tomorrow is a day off.

308
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,060
You guys have a plan?

309
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,480
I have to practice football at the evening.

310
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:43,960
Wanna come?

311
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,220
Interesting. // Come play with me. // And you?

312
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,760
But I have a date with my boyfriend.

313
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:55,420
You all never have one, so you don't understand.

314
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,160
Bruh.

315
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:59,420
Rolls eyes. You chose a man over your friends again.

316
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:00,300
I may not go.

317
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,680
Eh?

318
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,500
Why not?

319
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,020
I'm not free.

320
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,180
It's alright. // Have fun.

321
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,340
Never mind.

322
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:12,100
But about prof. Pong's assignment,

323
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:14,420
have you guys started working on it yet?

324
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,980
No, I totally forgot.

325
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,140
I gave it a touch.

326
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:20,660
But can you help me review it, Rak?

327
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,060
I fixed it 2 times already.

328
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:23,040
Of course.

329
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,100
Then, you may consult the professor again.

330
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,780
It's really a pain in the ass.

331
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:32,880
but this is a university work, we can't be sloppy.

332
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:35,060
Yeah, it's another degree.

333
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,860
Ah, Rak. Are you going back with Aun?

334
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:38,500
You aren't available, are you?

335
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,520
Oh, that's right. Sorry, bro.

336
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,260
Uh, don't worry. I can go back by myself.

337
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:46,020
I know this area.

338
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,640
Okay, take care, then.

339
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:50,500
See ya. // Bye.

340
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:53,140
Good bye. See you later.

341
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:56,920
What are you doing?

342
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:59,360
I'm just part with my friends at Central World.

343
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,460
I'm gonna drop by to see you.

344
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:53,980
He was waiting for me?

345
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,400
Hey.

346
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:56,840
Dino.

347
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,480
Or...

348
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:00,700
Is he going to kidnap me?

349
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:07,380
Hey! Why are you taking a step back?

350
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:11,260
You stalked me. You made me scared.

351
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,060
Uh.

352
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,740
Sorry, I saw your post on Facebook.

353
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:18,820
Are we good?

354
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:24,240
Whatcha lookin' at?

355
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:26,680
Can't I look?

356
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:36,020
If you're not my boyfriend, you can't

357
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,460
If you want to look,

358
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:40,000
be my boyfriend.

359
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,060
I'll go first.

360
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,520
Don't go!

361
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,460
I'm going home.

362
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,320
I'll give you a ride.

363
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,660
You won't listen to me?

364
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:52,380
Should I carry you?

365
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,360
Do you have class tomorrow?

366
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,400
No.

367
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,460
Good.

368
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,120
My bike is right around the corner.

369
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:04,620
Yes.

370
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:08,740
Will you be afraid, if I drive fast?

371
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:09,900
A little bit.

372
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,760
Then hold on tight.

373
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:18,760
I promise I won't drive too fast.

374
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,560
[When will you be my lover?]

375
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:20,980
Yes.

376
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:24,280
[I'm counting the days until I can be yours]

377
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,400
[I smile every time we meet]

378
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:29,480
[And you feel the same way]

379
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:33,260
So you don't have class tomorrow?

380
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,560
I'll take you home tomorrow.

381
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,280
So, where am I gonna sleep tonight?

382
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:40,680
My condominium.

383
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:41,620
It's the safest place.

384
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,480
That's the most dangerous place.

385
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,140
What dangerous?

386
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,220
I'll take care of you.

387
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:49,680
Let's cheers.

388
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,500
You won't get drunk.

389
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:53,620
Dino?

390
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,500
Didn't you have some business to do?

391
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:57,060
Why are you back early?

392
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,520
I finish it quickly.

393
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,100
I just had to talk with client instead of dad.

394
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:01,520
And...

395
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,940
I wanna introduce you to someone.

396
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:07,700
Who?

397
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,240
Don't tell me...

398
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,240
it's that rabbit?

399
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,100
who already has an owner?

400
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,460
Not anymore.

401
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:19,760
So...

402
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,340
Why did you bring him here?

403
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:24,520
Did his parents say anything?

404
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,160
I dunno.

405
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:28,620
Damn.

406
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:30,940
You're the same as Suea.

407
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,940
He is always at Kit-kat's side.

408
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:34,580
And now you took him here.

409
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,500
Look at his face.

410
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:39,900
Does he want to be here?

411
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,200
I'll go back to work.

412
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:46,760
Hey, have fun. We're at a bar.

413
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,900
I'll take you back soon.

414
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:51,160
Really?

415
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:53,820
Do I look like a kidnapper to you?

416
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,220
Why bother asking?

417
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:56,140
Hm?

418
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,360
Eh? You're not in your room?

419
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:09,480
Where are you?

420
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,720
Why don't you tell me?

421
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:14,540
Since you've seen my messages, can you respond?

422
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,400
I came to see you.

423
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:18,940
Are you going to leave me, Rak?

424
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,200
You don't love me anymore, do you?

425
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:26,820
Hey.

426
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:27,960
Block him.

427
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:29,140
Is he your ex?

428
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:32,140
Just friend.

429
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,020
We were friends.

430
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,020
I can stay here tonight.

431
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:51,840
Hey, Rak.

432
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,440
Give me a smile.

433
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,560
No man would like to see his crush sad.

434
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:03,200
Have some fun.

435
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,180
The music is great. Take a look at the others.

436
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:08,660
Wanna take a sip?

437
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,260
Just a little.

438
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:11,600
It won't make you drunk.

439
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,180
Fine.

440
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:30,260
Here. Eat this.

441
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:39,860
This is my room.

442
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:41,820
Um.

443
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,760
It's your room?

444
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,580
Yes, it is.

445
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:12,420
Come on.

446
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,000
Have a seat.

447
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:20,260
I'll make something for you.

448
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:21,940
Yes.

449
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:37,560
Here.

450
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:39,560
It's all I have. Is it alright?

451
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,340
Why look at my face?

452
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,180
You don't like it?

453
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:49,640
Just wondering if you'd like to eat as well.

454
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:52,000
Nah, you can have it.

455
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:55,240
Then,

456
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:56,880
I'll eat it all?

457
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:57,660
Um.

458
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:03,720
Eat it quickly or the noodles will be soggy.

459
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,620
You eat like a kid.

460
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:12,940
Because it's tasty.

461
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,080
Finish it quickly then go take a shower.

462
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:23,980
But...

463
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:25,560
my clothes...

464
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,740
I'll take care of it.

465
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:28,940
Hurry up.

466
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:31,760
Tomorrow I'll give you a tour of my campus.

467
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,580
You want to study here, don't you?

468
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,540
Thank you, Dino.

469
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:39,960
Eat.

470
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,060
Then I won't hold back.

471
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:45,020
Um.

472
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:12,740
It suits you.

473
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,760
The pants are a bit too big, but...

474
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,160
I tied a knot.

475
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:19,740
Hm.

476
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:21,740
Well,

477
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:22,860
I have something for you.

478
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:24,100
Huh?

479
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,520
Take this. It's for tomorrow.

480
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,260
Is it yours?

481
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:39,180
Yeah, it's what my mom bought.

482
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,760
I think it'll look better on you, though

483
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:43,600
Thank you.

484
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:45,280
Um.

485
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,280
You can hang it here.

486
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,320
Where should I sleep?

487
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,040
On the bed, obviously.

488
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:54,980
With me.

489
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,340
But there's only one blanket.

490
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:02,240
Do you have another one?

491
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,120
Okay, fine.

492
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,560
You're so stubborn.

493
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:06,360
But you're cute even when asleep.

494
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,300
Is this what it feels to like someone?

495
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:20,780
Mek!

496
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:25,880
I'm Dino.

497
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,960
Mek, how could you do this to me?

498
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:35,760
Does our memories mean nothing to you?

499
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,560
Your eyes are swollen.

500
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,420
Dino!

501
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,280
Sleep.

502
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:51,560
But...

503
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:52,960
I said go to sleep.

504
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:55,660
Don't have another nightmare.

505
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,220
I'll look after you.

506
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:12,980
Argh!

507
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:14,440
Ow!

508
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,260
Ouch.

509
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:20,680
Shit.

510
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,480
This oil is poor quality!

511
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,500
And also this damn egg.

512
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,140
Should I throw it all away?

513
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:28,360
Ow!

514
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,200
Dino.

515
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:32,480
What?

516
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:33,920
May I help you?

517
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,380
You can cook?

518
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:36,840
Certainly.

519
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,540
Here. Give it a try.

520
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:42,820
It's almost 8 a.m.

521
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:44,040
You should take a bath,

522
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,440
If you don't want to be late.

523
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:52,060
When you cook, why doesn't it burn?

524
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:57,340
I often make fried eggs at my dorm.

525
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:58,340
Really?

526
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:01,760
I always eat instant noodle.

527
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,340
It's simple.

528
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,340
Actually,

529
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:08,380
you don't have to cook for me

530
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,040
because I don't normally eat breakfast.

531
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:13,520
But still...

532
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:15,580
Thank you for making it for me.

533
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,060
It's not edible, though.

534
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:19,980
Practice makes perfect.

535
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:21,120
You know what?

536
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:24,560
I burned the pan in my first try

537
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:27,160
and my parents forbade me to come near the kitchen.

538
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:30,140
But since I had to go to uni.

539
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,840
I needed to practice cooking.

540
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,860
Otherwise, I'll have only instant noodle.

541
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:37,720
So...

542
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:41,460
Why don't you try going to Witthayakarn Mahanakorn University?

543
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,300
I don't want to talk about it.

544
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:48,780
I'm sorry.

545
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:52,800
Come on.

546
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,480
Let's eat. I'm hungry.

547
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:21,000
[When will you be my lover?]

548
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,700
[I'm counting the days until I can be yours]

549
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:25,840
[I smile every time we meet]

550
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,980
[And you feel the same way]

551
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:32,080
[I’m not imagining things]

552
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:36,780
[You're talented at making a man think about you]

553
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:41,160
[and yearn for you every day]

554
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:44,860
[I want to give you my heart]

555
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:47,640
[but I'm afraid of being hurt]

556
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:52,080
[Since I don't know what you truly feel]

557
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:58,640
[Let me ask you directly so I can be certain]

558
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:02,380
[I want to love you, but I have to ask you first]

559
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:04,940
[When will you be my lover?]

560
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,900
[I'm counting the days until I can be yours]
 This is my faculty.

561
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:10,000
[I smile every time we meet]

562
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,300
[And you feel the same way]

563
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,739
It's very beautiful, Dino.

564
00:34:13,739 --> 00:34:15,960
[I’m not imagining things]

565
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:20,960
[You're talented at making a man think about you]

566
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,360
[and yearn for you every day]

567
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,739
I'll show you around.

568
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:56,520
How is it?

569
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,460
Do you want to study here?

570
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:01,400
I always do.

571
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:04,380
Let's get going.

572
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:05,060
Um.

573
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:12,440
Ah, Game.

574
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:14,960
About the sotus leader's meeting next year,

575
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,000
let Dino know about it.

576
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:19,040
You should be sotus leader next year, Dino.

577
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,940
You're the right man.

578
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,080
Believe me.

579
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,080
You have this fierce look.

580
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:28,060
The juniors will listen to you. // You're the best choice.

581
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,800
I'll think about it.

582
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:32,980
What's the hurry? // We have to be hurry!

583
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,100
It's good to be prepared. // Right.

584
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,560
Hey, what's wrong?

585
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:38,260
Man.

586
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:40,900
Don't be so serious.

587
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:43,280
Yeah. // Look at this.

588
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:48,360
This will help.

589
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:50,460
For you.

590
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,820
I feel refreshed just by looking at it.

591
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:56,600
This is yours. // Thank you. // How about me?

592
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,860
Right here.

593
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:58,880
Thanks.

594
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,700
Be careful.

595
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:03,140
And this is... for him.

596
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:07,440
Go.

597
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:15,800
It's so good. // I agree.

598
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:18,300
Huh?

599
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:21,420
Here.

600
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:24,880
Thank you.

601
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:29,360
Sorry for making you wait.

602
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,460
It's nothing.

603
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:35,380
I told you I should have sent you back first.

604
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,820
It's already dark.

605
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:41,020
Is your work done?

606
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:44,040
Not yet. There's a bit more to discuss.

607
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:46,040
I'll give you a ride home after this.

608
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,720
Actually, you can send me home tomorrow.

609
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,100
Saying this...

610
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:53,780
you want to stay with me more?

611
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:54,800
Uh.

612
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,260
Hmm.

613
00:36:58,260 --> 00:36:59,400
I'm gonna drink tea.

614
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,380
Refreshing.

615
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,220
It has a tea scent!

616
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:18,360
Is it sweet?

617
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,860
It's a honey lemon flavor. Sour and sweet.

618
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:23,740
It is.

619
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,220
Keep your sweetness for me.

620
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:30,580
[The second I saw you]

621
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:33,060
Don't wander far from here.

622
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,740
I don't want to fight anyone.

623
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:38,060
You can send me home tomorrow, really.

624
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:41,620
If it's today, you'll have to drive a long way,

625
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,960
and you're already tired.

626
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,400
You're making me hope.

627
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,300
I didn't say you cannot hope.

628
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:55,280
I might sound selfish,

629
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:56,820
I'm sorry.

630
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:00,300
Men Are Selfish.

631
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:01,860
Me too.

632
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:03,560
And I'm not giving up.

633
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:07,020
This means whenever you open your heart,

634
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:10,320
no one could get the chance except me.

635
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:13,520
I'm trying to be nice to you, Rak.

636
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:15,960
Because I like you.

637
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,100
So If you betray me,

638
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:22,440
don't blame me for being mean.

639
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:26,180
Thank you for being nice.

640
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:29,040
And I'm sorry because...

641
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:31,740
you won't ever get the chance to be mean to me.

642
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:37,800
You're really like a rabbit. // Ow!

643
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:39,940
A rabbit is like this.

644
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,800
Are you a kid, huh?

645
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:47,280
I'll drink mine.

646
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:52,300
Let's sum up, you'll be the sotus leader next year.

647
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:53,240
You have to!

648
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,040
*Sigh*

649
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:56,540
Why don't you guys listen to me?

650
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:18,720
Thank you for giving me a ride.

651
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:20,300
Don't mention it.

652
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:24,180
Keep it. You'll have to use it soon.

653
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,200
Go home safely.

654
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:29,000
I'mma call you.

655
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:54,260
He's quite nice.

656
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:56,040
He took care of me.

657
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:57,860
protected me,

658
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,580
and worried about me.

659
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:02,940
Should I...

660
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:07,140
Who is he?

661
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,120
Mek?

662
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,220
Who the f*ck is he, Rak?

663
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:13,000
I'm asking you!

664
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:16,920
You're not gonna answer?

665
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:18,000
Good.

666
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:21,060
We need to talk. Come here! // Mek!

667
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:26,560
Mek, let go of me. // Come on here!

668
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,300
It hurts, Mek. Let go.

669
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:34,900
Did you forget that we broke up?

670
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:39,120
No, I didn't agree, Rak.

671
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,380
Can you stop bothering me?

672
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:44,380
Both you and Kram.

673
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:47,980
Do you want me to die first, so you could stop?

674
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,940
It's not like that, Rak.

675
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:54,080
I told you I'm not leaving you.

676
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,440
Let me to explain, please?

677
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:58,540
I don't want to hear it.

678
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:00,960
Rak.

679
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:02,720
Please hear me out.

680
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:05,940
What do you want to say?!

681
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:09,840
About how you sleep with Kram when we're together?

682
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,980
And See-kram is my best friend!

683
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:20,580
Rak... It's... it's Kram's fault.

684
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:22,920
Please listen to me.

685
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:26,020
It's all because of Kram.

686
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:28,580
I didn't intend to sleep with him.

687
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:30,300
It was a mistake.

688
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,340
That's enough!

689
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:36,260
Rak, please don't leave me.

690
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:38,040
Let's make up.

691
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:45,520
I can't anymore. Let's break up.

692
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:47,520
No, let's get back together.

693
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:49,840
I don't want to break up with you.

694
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,180
Please.

695
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:54,180
I beg you.

696
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:56,580
Please come back.

697
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,200
No.

698
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:02,460
I can't go back.

699
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:08,440
Why?

700
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:12,420
Do you disgust me so much?

701
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:16,280
Or are you scare of me?

702
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:19,800
Let me tell you something.

703
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,040
The one you should be scared...

704
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,340
is your psycho friend.

705
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:29,840
And I insist we won't break up.

706
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:33,500
If I can't have you,

707
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:37,160
no one can.

708
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:52,700
[When will you be my lover?]

709
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:55,400
[I'm counting the days until I can be yours]

710
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:57,540
[I smile every time we meet]

711
00:42:57,540 --> 00:43:00,680
[And you feel the same way]

712
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:03,780
[I’m not imagining things]

713
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:08,480
[You're talented at making a man think about you]

714
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:12,860
[and yearn for you every day]

715
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:36,680
[When will you be my lover?]

716
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:39,380
[I'm counting the days until I can be yours]

717
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:41,520
[I smile every time we meet]

718
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:44,660
[And you feel the same way]

719
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:47,760
[I’m not imagining things]

720
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,860
[You're talented at making a man think about you]

721
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:52,440
How to capture one's heart?

722
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:53,800
Capture his heart?

723
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:59,000
The thing is... I heard that a man who can cook is charming,

724
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:02,300
so I tried making fried egg for Rak.

725
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:04,920
But as you can see, I burned it.

726
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,400
I also gave him a tour of my university.

727
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:11,020
He's happy,

728
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:14,620
and excited like a child that got a new toy.

729
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:17,360
It's almost perfect.

730
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:21,380
I don't know what he's been through.

731
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:26,220
His life seems complicated because of his friend and ex.

732
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:31,760
It made me realize that I want to take care of him for real.

733
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:43,280
That's all.

734
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:47,240
Find something to eat.

735
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:49,240
Watch out for gastritis.

736
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:52,020
Who are you talking to? Give me attention!

737
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:54,360
Rak!

738
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:57,440
You never mad at me for this long.

739
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,920
Open the door for me. // Hey, boy.

740
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:02,620
He's not here.

741
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:06,860
Who did this to you?!

742
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:09,000
Tell me!

743
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:10,320
I...
