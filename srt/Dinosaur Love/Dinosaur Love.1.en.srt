You've been here since you were a student until now that you already graduated.

16
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:58,880
And you've never paid for the drink.

It's for you, I really like you and wanna get to know you.

186
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,120
Rak.

187
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:03,060
Mek.

188
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:05,000
Rak!

189
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,820
Mek bought me my fav fried chicken, do you wanna join?

190
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:12,400
Wow, is this your room?

191
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:13,990
Why you've never invited me here?

192
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:16,390
May I come in, please.

193
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:17,290
Get in.

194
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:19,690
Can I talk to you?

195
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:23,720
Can it be later? I'm tired.

196
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,970
Just one second.

197
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:28,740
Alright.

198
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:31,970
I'll be right back.

199
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:34,080
Be back soon.

200
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,650
Alright, leave some fried chicken for me too.

201
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:37,490
Of course, it looks delicious.

202
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:50,470
I'm tired, can we just go eat fried chicken instead?

203
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:56,720
I don't like fried chicken.

204
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,960
Never mind.

205
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:05,000
You can eat with See-kram.

206
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,810
Mek!

207
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:17,810
Let's eat fried chicken.

208
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:20,300
The TV show is about to start.

209
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:23,010
I'll be there soon.

210
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,260
Rak.

211
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:29,390
I'm sorry about the fried chicken thing.

212
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:32,460
Well...

213
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,330
I remember wrongly.

214
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:39,740
I'll take you to eat Japanese food next time.

215
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,360
Is that alright?

216
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:43,560
Please.

217
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,980
Please don't be mad.

218
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:52,930
I come to see you as soon as I finished my work.

219
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,790
Don't say that.

220
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:02,700
Don't you remember that today is supposed to be just two of us?

221
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:06,540
Rak.

222
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:11,700
The TV show is about to start. Don't you need to watch it?

223
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:14,720
Let's go watch it.

224
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,660
Rak.

225
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:22,580
This one is for Mek.

226
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:26,550
Don't you join us, Rak?

227
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,530
No, you guys go ahead.

228
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:31,320
I'm full and I think I'll go to bed early.

229
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:36,440
Ok, you can go to bed.

230
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,720
We'll eat this first.

231
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:45,940
Mek, I left one piece for you.

232
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:47,960
Just one piece.

233
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:51,060
Among all of them and you left me just one!

234
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:53,060
Well, all is mine.

235
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:56,050
No, you have to give me more.

236
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:57,200
Can I have it all?

237
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,820
No, you need to share with me.

238
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:02,010
I give you one, I don't care I'll eat it now. // What?

239
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,520
Alright, I'll share. // Good.

240
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:06,050
Can you clean this?

241
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:08,710
Alright, if you do it next time, I won't clean.

242
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:12,160
Nonsense, I know I'll clean it.

243
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:14,450
Yes, you know it.

244
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:16,530
Because we work together.

245
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:21,280
We love each other like when we're with our fans

246
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,770
Right?

247
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:24,770
What are you talking about?

248
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,220
Rak might hear this.

249
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,620
Don't worry, he's asleep.

250
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,280
Be more quiet, what if he still awake?

251
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:54,040
Hey, bro.

252
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:55,720
Why you look so stressed?

253
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,490
What's wrong?

254
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:58,400
Come on.

255
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:08,520
I think the person you ran into today

256
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,120
he's already in a relationship, that's why he blocked you.

257
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,500
Hey! Why you have to be so mad?

258
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,090
I shouldn't have come with you.

259
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,990
It's because you help a girl.

260
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:27,410
Well, because she's so cute.

261
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:30,930
Anyone would want to help her anyway.

262
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:44,720
You crazy over him.

263
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:51,510
If I just listened to what Suea said and didn't see your face, I wouldn't have thought someone can break your heart like this?

264
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,820
Is he cute?

265
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:01,170
Umm, yes.

266
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:03,000
Like a rabbit.

267
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:04,280
A rabbit?

268
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:08,150
Then what?  He already in a relationship?

269
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:12,220
I don't know.

270
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,480
Then how can you be heart broken if you don't know?

271
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:20,990
Suea!

272
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:22,840
Spil the tea!

273
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,570
Want me to tell you?

274
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:30,290
Ok, we were running away from a gangster.

275
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,890
And Dino ran into someone.

276
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,140
I'm sorry.

277
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:41,060
I broke your phone.

278
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,470
Can I have your Facebook?

279
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:46,740
So, I'll text you about the compensation.

280
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:53,370
And I like you.

281
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:56,340
But I don't like you.

282
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:58,360
Go brush your teeth.

283
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:00,460
Wait!

284
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,210
You did like that?

285
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:05,530
Umm.

286
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:13,300
I'm not surprise with how you flirt, it's so you.

287
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,070
I think there're 2 reasons why he blocked you.

288
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,300
First, he's already in a relationship.

289
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:22,270
Or second, he scares of you.

290
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:24,780
So, he doesn't care about the compensation.

291
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:27,970
That means there's still hope for me.

292
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:34,970
I'll see him tomorrow.

293
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:40,360
Are you serious?

294
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:41,990
Umm.

295
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:47,100
Well, that's a big university.

296
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:48,740
There're thousands of people.

297
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:56,700
You think you'll show his FB profile and ask people around there if they know this person, like this?

298
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,580
Yep, that's it.

299
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:03,720
Let's dance.

300
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:07,930
I hope you're lucky.

301
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:13,300
What? I'm just dancing.

302
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,200
I have to go.

303
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,430
Are you leaving?

304
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:17,410
Wait for me.

305
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:19,050
I'm still having fun.

306
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:21,410
Bro, bring me more drink.

307
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,370
You want more?

308
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:22,870
Yes.

309
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:55,810
Guys, I think our work slays.

310
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:58,110
True, I heard professor complimented our work.

311
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:01,430
Because I'm a queen.

312
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:03,670
You? Queen?

313
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:05,670
Why? I can't be a queen?

314
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,870
Yes, you can. You're beautiful.

315
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:10,580
If you don't let me be a queen then I'll be a princess.

316
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:14,560
I'm relieve that our presentation is done.

317
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,610
Thank you Rak, you're the leader of this work.

318
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:19,610
Yes.

319
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:22,440
You're being exaggerate; you guys also help me with this.

320
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:26,280
If it's not because of you, the work wouldn't be so perfect.

321
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:29,300
If you don't encourage us to do, the work wouldn't have been finished.

322
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,260
Ping and Toon always play game.

323
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:33,260
Especially, Ping.

324
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:37,520
You played with me, how am I the only one to blame?

325
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:39,830
Are you guys free tonight?

326
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,740
I'm free, where do we go?

327
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,040
Do you want to go to a club?

328
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,740
Let's go together.

329
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:49,510
Yeah, let's enjoy our time.

330
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:51,440
I'll go too.

331
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:53,840
Great.

332
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,120
Do you want me to pick you up?

333
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:57,690
It's ok, I can go by myself.

334
00:22:57,690 --> 00:22:59,690
But it's quite far, I can pick you up.

335
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:02,190
Alright then.

336
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:04,560
Ok, how about you guys?

337
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,490
I'll go with him.

338
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:07,600
I want to go with him.

339
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:09,440
Ok.

340
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:12,880
You can order before me, I'll arrive later.

341
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,720
But don't get drunk before I arrive.

342
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,350
Let's go, I want to go now.

343
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:25,810
When I'm at a club, I'll flirt with everyone.

344
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:27,350
I think I'll get someone tonight.

345
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:30,920
You don't have to take care of me.

346
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,250
Elevator is here.

347
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:33,920
Do you want to compete with me?

348
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:39,450
Sure, let's see who will get more guys.

349
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:53,600
[When will you be my lover?]

350
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,370
[I'm counting the days until I can be yours.]

351
00:23:56,370 --> 00:23:58,200
[I smile every time we meet.]

352
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:01,450
[And you feel the same way.]

353
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,640
[I’m not imagining things.]

354
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:09,400
[You're talented at making a man think about you]

355
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:13,530
[and yearn for you every day.]

356
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:30,440
Guys, let's cheers.

357
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,960
You too, cheers.

358
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:41,040
Are you drunk?

359
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:43,120
I came here to get drunk.

360
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,120
Hey Rak, are you drunk?

361
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,270
Are you alright?

362
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,460
Just a little tipsy, not drunk yet.

363
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:49,550
Really?

364
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:55,120
Why you look so serious, my friend?

365
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,290
You can tell us, if you want.

366
00:24:57,290 --> 00:25:00,400
I won't tell anybody.

367
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:03,720
Nothing.

368
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:06,840
Don't worry.

369
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:11,090
Are you sure?

370
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:11,940
I don't believe you.

371
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:18,250
If you said it's nothing, then let's have fun.

372
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:43,990
Are you alright?

373
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:03,670
Finally, I found you.

374
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,230
Let's get out.

375
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:21,320
Let me go.

376
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,680
I'm fine.

377
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:25,530
Are you sure?

378
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:28,500
If I let you go, you won't fall down, ok?

379
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:35,000
Do you know me?

380
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:37,360
You can't remember me?

381
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:40,830
I ran into you and dropped your phone yesterday.

382
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:46,260
Well, do you have anything to do with me?

383
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:49,160
No.

384
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,560
I just want to see you again.

385
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,320
You want to see me?

386
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:54,540
Umm.

387
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:59,760
How did you know I'm here?

388
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:01,700
My friend is here too.

389
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:05,440
Don't worry, I'm not a stalker.

390
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:09,720
Anywhere, seems like this place isn't for you.

391
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:13,730
I just came here to celebrate with my friends.

392
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:15,330
Are you about to leave?

393
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,800
Not yet.

394
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,180
I saw you wore a workshop shirt not from my university.

395
00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:24,750
You're not from here, right?

396
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:28,660
I study at Witthayakarn Mahanakorn University.

397
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:31,770
Really?

398
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:32,810
Yes.

399
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:34,660
It used to be my dream university.

400
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:37,180
My dad was an engineering student from that university.

401
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:40,450
Why don't you study there?

402
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:49,000
I don't want to talk about it.

403
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:53,480
I didn't mean to be so nosy.

404
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:57,080
It's getting late, where is your place? I'll take you home.

405
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,760
Take me home?

406
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,320
Umm.

407
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:05,570
Well, I don't trust you.

408
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:07,900
You said you were going to flirt with me in the chat.

409
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:09,450
So, I blocked you.

410
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,680
What if you do something to me if I let you take me home?

411
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:14,990
What could I do?

412
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:18,400
I really like you.

413
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:20,330
What's your name?

414
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:22,870
Rak.

415
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:27,320
I like you, I'll get to know you more.

416
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,000
I'll flirt with you until you are mine.

417
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:32,380
Can I have your number?

418
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,100
Yes.

419
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:36,000
What's your number?

420
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:40,970
I can't give you my number.

421
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:43,760
Because I'm taken.

422
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:49,600
I'm heartbroken, aren't I?

423
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:55,790
Umm.

424
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:00,670
Well, can I take you home?

425
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:02,800
I just want to.

426
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:10,400
Why do you like me?

427
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:12,820
There's no reason.

428
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,500
I like you since when our eyes met.

429
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:23,300
Can I take you home?

430
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:25,990
I want to.

431
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:36,660
Well, I need to tell my friends first.

432
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,680
Ok, I'll wait for you at the parking lot.

433
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,120
Umm.

434
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:47,760
Let's go.

435
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:52,310
Are you alright?

436
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,170
I'm ok.

437
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:09,640
We're arrived.

438
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:11,410
Umm.

439
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:28,710
Here you are.

440
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:29,830
Umm.

441
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:38,500
I need to go, it's quite late.

442
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:40,050
Wait.

443
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:48,580
Here you are.

444
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,390
Suea also sorry about that day too.

445
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:53,580
Well, nevermind.

446
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:56,140
You don't want it?

447
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:57,080
I'll throw it away.

448
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,760
Then I'll take it.

449
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:01,740
Here.

450
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:07,420
Please tell Suea I said thank you.

451
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:11,050
I'm not mad at all.

452
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:14,060
And thank you for taking me home.

453
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:16,360
It's ok.

454
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:22,360
I'll unblock you.

455
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:25,710
Never mind, I rarely log in Facebook.

456
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:30,650
But at least we can be friends.

457
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:34,950
Do you think I want to be your friend?

458
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,660
I can't be your friend.

459
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:48,760
Because I can't think straight when I'm with you.

460
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,520
Here's my business card.

461
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,040
Call me anytime.

462
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:04,320
Thank you, Dino.

463
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:08,300
Drive safe.

464
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:15,610
When you're lonely,

465
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:19,530
please know that you have me.

466
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Am I breaking his heart?

467
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,330
Are you back?

468
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:53,880
Why are you come back so late?

469
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:57,850
You didn't tell me that you arrived here.

470
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,720
I wanted to surprise you.

471
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,110
I bought you a Japanese food.

472
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:05,480
This time, I remember it correctly.

473
00:34:06,810 --> 00:34:09,620
This is a compensation for last time.

474
00:34:10,810 --> 00:34:13,320
I promise I won't remember wrongly again.

475
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:19,060
You and Kram are close, you even like fried chicken like him.

476
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,400
I understand why you remember it wrong.

477
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,900
By the way, I watched the show that you and See-Kram participated in.

478
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,540
You're so talented.

479
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:36,929
You remember See-Kram's favorite movie, dish, and music.

480
00:34:39,650 --> 00:34:41,949
Even his birthday, you still remember it.

481
00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:48,170
But when I asked you when my birthday is, you forgot.

482
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:49,449
You said you not good at remembering.

483
00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:55,350
How can a person who's not good at remembering, remember everything about his close friend?

484
00:34:56,440 --> 00:35:00,440
Or I have to be your close friend?

485
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:03,360
Maybe you'll remember everything about me.

486
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,110
Rak.

487
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:13,580
It's just a script that I remembered before the show started.

488
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:16,090
Really?

489
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:20,210
I thought you actually remembered it.

490
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:23,310
This means you lied to the audiences.

491
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:28,140
Rak.

492
00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:31,410
Are you trying to start a fight?

493
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:37,550
I already told you that Kram and I just work together.

494
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:40,850
And you're the one who introduced Kram to me.

495
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,520
I'm close to him because he's your friend too.

496
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:48,350
And now people are shipping me and Kram.

497
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:50,820
Everything you see is set up.

498
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:55,090
Why you have to discuss about this?

499
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:59,090
Today, I came to see you and bought you your favorite food.

500
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:02,010
I've waited for you since evening.

501
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:06,140
I should be the one who is mad.

502
00:36:12,350 --> 00:36:13,080
Rak.

503
00:36:14,890 --> 00:36:16,200
Please don't fight.

504
00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:19,180
Lately, I've been very busy.

505
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:21,990
I might forget about you.

506
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:23,660
But

507
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
I'm not cheating on you.

508
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:30,490
Kram is just a friend.

509
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:36,790
We're close only when we're with fans.

510
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:40,490
Please don't get mad.

511
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:41,560
Please.

512
00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:47,430
Umm, I'm not mad.

513
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:51,830
Then smile!

514
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,800
Smile if you know you're mine.

515
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,950
Smile wider.

516
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,020
Enough.

517
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:58,320
So cute.

518
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:00,520
Let's eat!

519
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:02,700
Let's eat when it's still fresh.

520
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:03,620
Here.

521
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:10,730
Who is he? He's so hot.

522
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:11,840
I like him, can you ask Rak who is this person?

523
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:12,720
You're with Rak, right?

524
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:13,980
Hmm?

525
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,370
What's wrong?

526
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:18,800
What about you?

527
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:20,570
Do you have anything to tell me?

528
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:23,400
Tell you what?

529
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,350
Who took you home?

530
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:28,290
Ah.

531
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,820
My new friend, Dino.

532
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:33,500
He accidentally broke my phone.

533
00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:35,470
So, he bought me a new one.

534
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:37,490
And took me home.

535
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:41,890
Does friend have to put arm around the waist?

536
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:56,140
If I say, there's nothing between us.

537
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:57,740
Will you believe me?

538
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:11,970
I'll go back to my room.

539
00:38:53,050 --> 00:38:53,640
Hey!

540
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:55,840
The club is about to close.

541
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:00,890
What happened?

542
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:03,680
You can tell me.

543
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:07,120
He's taken.

544
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:09,020
He said that?

545
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,350
Umm.

546
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:13,520
I met him at a club tonight.

547
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:17,360
I asked him his name and can I get to know him.

548
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:19,710
Then you're heartbroken?

549
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:24,020
Yeah, he said he's taken.

550
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:38,910
What's wrong with you?

551
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:41,360
You were sad few minutes ago.

552
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:43,420
And now you're smiling.

553
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:45,190
I think you're drunk.

554
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,210
Go to sleep then.

555
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,280
You can sleep here.

556
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,160
I'll sleep at my apartment.

557
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:52,900
Umm.

558
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:54,840
Ok, bro.

559
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:58,880
Enough with the drink.

560
00:40:01,050 --> 00:40:02,490
Are you ready to be a sotus leader?

561
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,380
If I participate, I can't dye my hair.

562
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:07,890
Can I not join?

563
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:10,000
Up to you.

564
00:40:10,610 --> 00:40:13,880
This position is for someone who willing to do it.

565
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:16,300
You have to sacrifice a lot.

566
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,270
That's why no one wants to be.

567
00:40:19,610 --> 00:40:22,760
Being a sotus leader doesn't mean being cool.

568
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:25,510
Some can't handle this responsibility,

569
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,150
and stop in the middle.

570
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:30,790
It's ok if you don't want to.

571
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:35,400
I'll think about it.

572
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,650
Then I'll close the club.

573
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,720
You should stop drinking and go to bed.

574
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,940
I'll leave you a key.

575
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:47,220
You can return to me tomorrow at the uni.

576
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:48,390
I'm free in the afternoon.

577
00:40:49,270 --> 00:40:50,000
Got it.

578
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:52,390
Take a rest.

579
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,780
See you.

580
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:44,360
What's up?

581
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:45,610
Rak.

582
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:47,890
Why you took so long to pick up my call?

583
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:49,660
I have something to talk to you about.

584
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:54,620
I wasn't on my phone when you called.

585
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,080
So, I didn't hear it.

586
00:41:58,210 --> 00:41:59,400
Your voice is breaking.

587
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:00,990
Are you alright?

588
00:42:01,570 --> 00:42:02,720
Are you crying?

589
00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:04,360
What did Mek do to you?

590
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:09,560
I'm not crying.

591
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:12,580
Mek's already left.

592
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,820
He said he'll sleep at his place.

593
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:16,590
Really?

594
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:18,440
Never mind.

595
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,510
Who took you home?

596
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:24,420
So hot.

597
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:28,300
I told Mek to ask you, not sure if he already did.

598
00:42:31,390 --> 00:42:33,390
You sent him a picture?

599
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:34,930
Yeah.

600
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:37,210
Who is he?

601
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:40,390
You know him?

602
00:42:40,710 --> 00:42:41,860
He's hotter than Mek.

603
00:42:42,270 --> 00:42:43,540
Are you having an affair?

604
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:45,780
I never do that.

605
00:42:47,050 --> 00:42:48,630
You should know me better.

606
00:42:48,910 --> 00:42:50,230
I'm just kidding.

607
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:52,630
You're being too serious.

608
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:54,950
I'm serious.

609
00:42:56,030 --> 00:42:57,650
You want to know who is that person.

610
00:42:59,330 --> 00:43:00,910
And you asked Mek.

611
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,800
Don't you think I'll have problem with Mek?

612
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:05,370
Umm.

613
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:07,650
I'm asking you right now.

614
00:43:08,930 --> 00:43:11,310
Are you guys fight?

615
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:14,310
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.

616
00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:22,350
Kram.

617
00:43:23,570 --> 00:43:26,250
Have you ever feel truly sorry?

618
00:43:27,690 --> 00:43:30,250
You don't have to say it if you don't really feel it.

619
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:34,120
I got to go.

620
00:43:52,330 --> 00:43:59,740
"fried chicken delivery man is so handsome :)"

621
00:44:09,350 --> 00:44:10,620
When you're lonely,

622
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,790
please know that you have me.

623
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:33,300
"Rak Passakorn is now your friend."

624
00:44:33,970 --> 00:44:36,700
Thank you for taking me home.

625
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:42,680
Directed by Zanook and Tonnam Piamchon.

626
00:44:43,350 --> 00:44:45,950
[I’m not imagining things.]

627
00:44:45,950 --> 00:44:50,840
[You're talented at making a man think about you]

628
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:55,820
[and yearn for you every day.]

629
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:58,220
[I wanna give you my heart.]

630
00:44:58,950 --> 00:45:01,550
[but I'm afraid of being hurt.]

631
00:45:01,550 --> 00:45:06,440
[Since I don't know what you truly feel.]

632
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:12,700
[Let me ask you directly so I can be certain.]

633
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:16,280
[I want to love you, but I have to ask you first.]

634
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:19,170
[When will you be my lover?]

635
00:45:19,170 --> 00:45:22,070
[I'm counting the days until I can be yours.]

636
00:45:22,070 --> 00:45:24,070
[I smile every time we meet.]

637
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:27,120
[And you feel the same way.]

638
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:30,420
[I’m not imagining things.]

639
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:35,060
[You're talented at making a man think about you]

640
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:39,700
[and yearn for you every day.]

641
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:45,260
[Chatting every morning and saying good night before bed.]

642
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:50,810
[Say, is this giving me false hope, or do you really like me?

643
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:59,100
How did you feel when you first met Rak?

644
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:04,950
First time I met him,

645
00:46:07,830 --> 00:46:09,610
You can call it love at first sight.

646
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:15,450
He's like a cute rabbit.

647
00:46:15,850 --> 00:46:16,660
He's so radiant.

648
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:19,470
Just by looking in his eyes,

649
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:22,390
I think you can call it love.

650
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:30,000
He even blocked me.

651
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:31,740
Why?

652
00:46:32,930 --> 00:46:35,400
I might told him I like him too early.

653
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:36,700
Or...

654
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:38,980
Am I bad at singing?

655
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:40,650
Maybe not.

656
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:43,100
I even tried to find him.

657
00:46:43,590 --> 00:46:45,590
I tried to find him at his uni, but I couldn't find him.

658
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:48,180
Finally, I found him.

659
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,400
He's already taken.

660
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:56,850
But he doesn't seem to be happy at all.

661
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:01,930
To be honest, I want to take care of him.

662
00:47:05,390 --> 00:47:06,330
Dino!

663
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:07,960
Hi.

664
00:47:08,270 --> 00:47:13,420
You, Kram, and Mek who is actually a couple?

665
00:47:18,150 --> 00:47:19,340
About Kram,

666
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:22,700
I see him as a friend.

667
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,440
I don't want to hear this again.

668
00:47:24,910 --> 00:47:27,000
If you're lonely, just text me.
