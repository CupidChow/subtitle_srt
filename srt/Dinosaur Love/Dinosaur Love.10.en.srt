2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:06,380
Ai, that's Dino.

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:07,980
Do you remember him?

4
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:10,960
You liked to sneak out and play with him when you were kid.

5
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:12,760
Yes, I do.

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,860
Dino, this is Ai, do you remember her?

7
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:18,860
The girl who liked to follow you.

8
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:22,400
I had to get her out from you every day.

9
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:24,280
Yes, I do.

10
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:31,280
Wow, they remember each other.

11
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:35,980
Ai is blushing.

12
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,120
When will we talk about that?

13
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,580
I'm not going to marry her.

14
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,120
Dino.

15
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,880
It's all sticky.

16
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,540
Let me go shower first.

17
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:04,560
Why don't you eat more?

18
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,620
It's sticky...

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,420
I can handle that.

20
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,500
You're aware that I already have a boyfriend, right?

21
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:35,200
He doesn't like you.

22
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,360
I don't want to have an argument with him.

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,580
Please understand me.

24
00:01:42,539 --> 00:01:43,720
Then I'll go first.

25
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:47,479
I'm gonna flirt with you.

26
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:52,880
Who is it?

27
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,300
Hm.

28
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,700
It's that guy again.

29
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,380
See?

30
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:58,280
Again?

31
00:01:59,259 --> 00:01:59,860
Hm.

32
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:02,920
So he's not gonna stop?

Cheers.

60
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:03,860
I'm happy now.

61
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:07,040
Hey.

62
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,280
What's wrong with two of you?

63
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,040
Are you in a fight?

64
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:13,940
French fries?

65
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:17,339
You like it.

66
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,460
Hey, what's going on?

67
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,800
We are in a fight like you said.

68
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:37,560
Ok,

69
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,780
I think

70
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:41,360
You guys need to talk.

71
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,620
Well, I want to talk to him

72
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,400
but he doesn't talk to me.

73
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,200
Let's do this,

74
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,580
when he comes back, then you talk to him.

75
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,380
Just talk about what he misunderstood about you.

76
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:04,180
Even though he doesn't talk to you, he still listens.

77
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:09,840
You are a couple, you have to talk this through.

78
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:14,520
I think you need to talk, no matter how big or small the issue is.

79
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:21,680
The more you wait, the more you're unhappy.

80
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:27,120
And it's not just you.

81
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,500
Dino's also unhappy.

82
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:33,860
So, just talk to him.

83
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,260
Or you want to wait

84
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:41,840
and make everything worse?

85
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,900
Just think about it.

86
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,060
Dino's coming.

87
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:53,340
Let's go.

88
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,000
Good luck.

89
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:56,900
Good luck.

90
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:58,520
Are you leaving?

91
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:01,740
Not yet, I'll get some fresh air with Suea.

92
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:03,380
Good luck.

93
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:19,580
Dino.

94
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,300
I don't mind

95
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,220
if you're mad at me.

96
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,240
I just want you to listen to me.

97
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:41,120
I didn't mad at you for punching Tart.

98
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,320
I said that because I wanted you to stop.

99
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:50,060
Someone was recording a video.

100
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:59,440
You've never stayed silent to me for this long.

101
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,140
Did you know

102
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,180
that it hurt me

103
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:10,000
when you drove away?

104
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,040
I'm sorry that I left you.

105
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,240
I'm not mad at you.

106
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,180
Me neither.

107
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:25,700
I was just frustrated

108
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,720
at how you're mad because I beat that a*shole.

109
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,940
I understand how you feel.

110
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,400
So...

111
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,560
are we good now?

112
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,620
Come on.

113
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,480
Um.

114
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,820
Pinky promise?

115
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,960
Come on. Let's make up.

116
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:56,320
Don't be silly.

117
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:59,100
Can't you be nice to me, Dino?

118
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:03,360
Fine!

119
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,800
We're good. Are you happy now?

120
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,100
What was that? I can't hear you.

121
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:13,100
We're good! Are you happy now?

122
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,180
Can't you speak more softly?

123
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:21,180
You used to be sweeter. You've changed.

124
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,440
Babe.

125
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:26,740
Let's make up.

126
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:28,880
Are you fine with that?

127
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:33,500
Is that all you've got? Be gentler, please.

128
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:37,740
Babe~

129
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:40,080
Let's make up.

130
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,299
Can you say that again?

131
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:45,860
What?

132
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,280
Again, please.

133
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,780
Babe~ Forgive me.

134
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,340
My sweetheart.

135
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,080
Babe~ Forgive me, my sweetheart.

136
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,080
Wow!

137
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,920
Lmao. Dino.

138
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:07,540
Babe.

139
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,000
Babe.

140
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,620
Dino?

141
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:39,060
Is there anything you want? Do you want a surprise?

142
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,540
It's not a surprise anymore

143
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,760
after you woke me up

144
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,620
and asked what I want.

145
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:54,180
I just asked to prepare for the next year.

146
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:58,940
You don't have to.

147
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,220
It's not picky about it.

148
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:04,220
Is that so?

149
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,540
It's not important...

150
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:10,800
how long we've been together.

151
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,340
I just...

152
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,780
want to grow old with you.

153
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:18,940
Um.

154
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,700
Sweet talker.

155
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:23,740
This is your reward.

156
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,680
Am I not sweet?

157
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:27,460
You are.

158
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,620
Another side, too.

159
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:33,960
How cute.

160
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:35,720
Rak.

161
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,060
I'm going home this evening.

162
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,720
I was thinking of bringing you at first, but it's about business,

163
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:43,880
can you stay here?

164
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:45,700
I'll come back tomorrow.

165
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:48,440
Alright.

166
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,540
Do you wanna go anywhere before I leave?

167
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,400
I want to watch a movie.

168
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:56,560
Watching movie?

169
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,260
Later, then.

170
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,760
Let's do something else first.

171
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,600
Dino.

172
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,480
Dino.

173
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:06,000
Huh?

174
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,940
Can you teach me how to play the guitar?

175
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:12,520
No.

176
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:13,820
Your fingers will be coarse.

177
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,060
Please~? I wanna play it, babe.

178
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,980
Pretty please?

179
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,980
Fine. I got it.

180
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:23,560
You promise?

181
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:25,900
Yeah.

182
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:29,500
Come on.

183
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:36,580
Dino.

184
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,840
Where can I sit?

185
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,520
Right here.

186
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:51,340
Put your index finger on the second string

187
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:54,240
and your middle finger on the third.

188
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,660
Then, put your ring finger on the fourth.

189
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:58,480
Uh-huh.

190
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,060
The fourth string is higher.

191
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,420
Is it this one? // Yep.

192
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,340
Try it.

193
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:08,860
That's not quite right.

194
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:10,860
Press it harder and try again.

195
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,040
My fingers hurt.

196
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,120
Give it a try.

197
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,700
You're hopeless, stop hurting your fingers.

198
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:22,040
Can you play a song for me, then?

199
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:23,680
What song?

200
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,300
Love at first sight.

201
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,420
The one you played for me at that time.

202
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,240
Sure.

203
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:36,380
Ready?

204
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,300
Mhm.

205
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:47,380
[Is love at first sight real?]

206
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:55,220
[Just saw you pass by without saying a word]

207
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:58,080
[or knowing who you are.]

208
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,040
[Why did I fall for you?]

209
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:01,820
I found you.

210
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:09,800
[No, it's must be just a fantasy]

211
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:17,940
[that exists only in romance stories, fairy tales,]

212
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:24,980
[love songs, and in people's dream]

213
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:28,460
[One day, I found you]

214
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:29,860
Remember what I told you?

215
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,340
Even if you think you have no one, you still have me.

216
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:37,660
I'm willing to protect you no matter what it takes.

217
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:43,320
[As if I was under an enchanted spell]

218
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,980
Dino.
[and immediately fell for you]

219
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:51,640
[What exactly is love at first sight?]

220
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:54,400
[Are you the one who opened my mind?]

221
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:58,260
[You're so different]

222
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:02,680
[From that day, I've realized,]

223
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:03,840
Let me take care of you.

224
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:06,300
Just stay close to me.

225
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:10,740
[It's not a dream]

226
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:16,420
[I realized it when I saw you]

227
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:17,920
The star jar is full.

228
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,180
So cheeky.

229
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,680
I love you, Rak.

230
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:24,800
You're my only one.

231
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:30,460
[It's not a dream]

232
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:36,660
[I realized it when I saw you]

233
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:49,980
Here.

234
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:56,200
You never change. You've always been drinking this.

235
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,320
Hmm.

236
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:04,900
So fresh!

237
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,340
Um.

238
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:08,560
It'll never change.

239
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,180
When I like something, my heart doesn't change easily.

240
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,800
The same goes for this drink

241
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,000
and the one I love.

242
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,600
Dino!

243
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,920
You keep calling my name.

244
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,620
Are you afraid I'll forget it, rabbit?

245
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:27,520
And you keep calling me "Rabbit", too!

246
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:29,320
Aren't you tired of it?

247
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:30,800
Or...

248
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,080
do you want to feed me carrots?

249
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,280
I wanna eat omelette.

250
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:38,280
Chalarm?!

251
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:40,160
The sea is supposed to be salty,

252
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,060
but isn't it too sweet right here?

253
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,280
*Sigh*

254
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,600
I'm speechless.

255
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:49,920
Ha.

256
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:53,200
Are you following me to the end of the world, Chalarm?

257
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:58,180
I can't imagine what will happen if Suea is also here.

258
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,220
Who said I'm not here?

259
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,640
Hahaha.

260
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,200
I'll keep an eye on you

261
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,900
until the day I found my soulmate!

262
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,140
Have my armpit first!

263
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:18,000
Sh*t! What the fu*ck are you doing?

264
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,600
You smelly freak!

265
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:23,680
Now that you two are here, is Mhee also in the sand pile?

266
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,480
Damn.

267
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,420
Is this a beach or a fashion show?

268
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,420
Woah, Mhee.

269
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:41,340
Hey.

270
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:42,740
Dino. Rak.

271
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,540
You guys are also here?

272
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:46,900
We're celebrating our anniversary.

273
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,680
It's you who should answer that question.

274
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:51,140
There are thousands of beaches in Thailand,

275
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,080
so why are you here?

276
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:56,060
I'm taking my brothers on a holiday trip.

277
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:59,300
I didn't expect to meet you guys.

278
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:01,220
Are you on your honeymoon?

279
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:03,560
No,

280
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:06,940
because every day is our honeymoon.

281
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,099
Bruh.

282
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,079
What a cheesy dude.

283
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,240
Bro...

284
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:15,460
let's be real,

285
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,920
where did you get that line from?

286
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:21,040
It makes me want to puke.

287
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:24,760
If it weren't for you, I would be throwing up right now.

288
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:27,500
Puke anywhere you want,

289
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:29,680
but not on me.

290
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,560
Haha.

291
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,740
That's enough, guys.

292
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,380
I have pork buffet ready for you.

293
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:39,720
Shall we eat it now?

294
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,320
Do you have omelette?

295
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:42,500
Yes!

296
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,500
I prepared it all.

297
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,860
You can eat as much as you want.

298
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:49,660
Mhee.

299
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,660
Let's eat it now.

300
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:52,560
Come on.

301
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,460
Hey, bro!

302
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,420
Bruh.

303
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,820
Get out. It's not that hard.

304
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,100
Don't go! Help me get outta here!!

305
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,360
The fire is too low.

306
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:21,910
Are you hungry, Dino?

307
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:22,570
Of course!

308
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:33,570
Dino, how's your family matter?

309
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:35,490
I mean things regarding Ai.

310
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:38,230
Are they still trying to arrange marriage for you?

311
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:39,630
I guess not.

312
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:42,450
because I told them I'm a faithful boyfriend.

313
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:43,930
that I truly love him

314
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:46,290
and want him all for myself.

315
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:49,190
Woah! // So cringey!

316
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:50,350
How about you, Rak?

317
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:52,810
After I closed my bar because of Covid-19,

318
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:54,270
do you have other part time jobs?

319
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:55,490
Yes, I do.

320
00:18:56,290 --> 00:18:57,870
I work almost every day.

321
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,270
But the thing is

322
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:01,350
my boss is so hard on me!

323
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:06,670
Who's your boss?

324
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:08,950
It's me.

325
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:10,850
Not just about work...

326
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:13,330
I'm also hard in bed.

327
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:17,350
F*ck you, man. Stop bragging already!

328
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:21,170
Like... Are you even that good?

329
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:22,270
So boastful.

330
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:24,730
Are you asking for trouble?

331
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,970
Bring it on! Do you think I'll back out?!

332
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:28,390
You really need a beating.

333
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:31,730
That's a dirty trick! // So what?

334
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:33,910
Suea.

335
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:36,530
Why don't we talk about you?

336
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:38,770
Have Kitkat accepted your feelings yet?

337
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:41,150
Er, Mhee.

338
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:43,410
About Kitkat...

339
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,470
I'd say I'm over the moon.

340
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:49,270
I...

341
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,470
flirted with him a lot.

342
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:58,190
When he blushed,

343
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:02,290
I pinched his cheek.

344
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:06,950
When he was shy,

345
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:09,950
I also pinched his cheek.

346
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:17,390
When he smiled,

347
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:21,330
I sucked...

348
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,430
F*ck!

349
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:28,690
It's the fatback!

350
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:32,110
Serves you right. Karma is real.

351
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:35,590
When did you fall for Kitkat, Suea?

352
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:38,790
Since he was young.

353
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:42,670
But he fell harder around the time we met, babe.

354
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:48,910
Babe?!

355
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:50,150
Ew.

356
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:52,010
Ew.

357
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:54,010
Don't tease me. // What's that?

358
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:55,130
Let's talk about Suea.

359
00:20:56,710 --> 00:21:00,770
You fell harder for Kitkat when I met Dino?

360
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:04,130
Could you please explain?

361
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:06,350
So...

362
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:09,270
Here's the thing.

363
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:17,850
Tiger's Kitkat

364
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:20,810
Hey.

365
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,760
So we're here to look after your friend's little brother

366
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:25,470
Are you sure we won't get caught?

367
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:27,410
I don't think we will.

368
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:28,690
I feel like...

369
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:30,610
I disguised myself well.

370
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:31,970
Really?

371
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:33,710
We look suspicious in my opinion.

372
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:40,690
Why is that? I'm sure I look pretty normal.

373
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:46,710
Is it not enough?

374
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:56,670
Stop it.

375
00:21:57,090 --> 00:21:59,170
Everyone can tell you're a spy from miles away.

376
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:02,210
Are you gonna protect him or ambush him, huh?

377
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:06,430
Are you sure he haven't gone home?

378
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:22,760
Give it to me! Give it back!

379
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:25,310
Hey, wait! Calm down, bro!

380
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:27,170
They'll find out. // How could I stay calm?!

381
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:31,230
They bullied Kitkat exactly as King said.

382
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:35,250
I recognized their workshop shirt.

383
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:38,950
Tomorrow, I'll teach them a lesson.

384
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:40,330
Seriously?

385
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:42,150
Their college is huge.

386
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:43,310
Who's gonna go with you?

387
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:44,510
You, of course.

388
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:47,550
Is coming with you today not enough?

389
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:53,040
Eh?

390
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,980
He's gone. Stop clinging to the trash can.

391
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:01,000
I just like him a lot!

392
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,500
The trash can?

393
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,060
I was talking about Kitkat! You idiot!

394
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,720
You're messing with me!

395
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:08,940
Why don't you just try to flirt with him?

396
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:11,880
Flirt with him?

397
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:13,220
Yeah.

398
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,340
Oh.

399
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,840
To be honest,

400
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:17,520
whenever I'm near him,

401
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,440
my legs will lose all strength.

402
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:24,480
Just fix your language first.

403
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:26,860
Try to speak more politely.

404
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:27,760
How?

405
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,620
Be polite.

406
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:30,780
Go ahead.

407
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,340
A sweet smile

408
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,300
and warm eyes.

409
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:37,500
Try it out.

410
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:41,080
What the f*ck is wrong with you?!

411
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,680
Why are you so f*cking cute?!!

412
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,520
Like this?

413
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:45,640
No, it's all wrong.

414
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:46,540
What?

415
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:49,080
I just speak this way all my life.

416
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,320
Repeat after me.

417
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,020
Ah.

418
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:57,020
Glancing at the fragile thee. // Glancing at the fragile thee.

419
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:00,260
The prettiest soul to ever unfold. // The prettiest soul to ever unfold.

420
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,420
How's it? Isn't it great?

421
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:02,640
Great.

422
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:05,420
Great your a*s!

423
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:10,540
Are you a love poet or something? You're so f*cking corny!

424
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:12,200
Let me tell you this,

425
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:13,740
whoever gets to be your lover...

426
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:17,520
will absolutely die from cringe!

427
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,940
I can't believe you're this tacky.

428
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:21,360
Thee, thou, thy,

429
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,020
and a stupid guy.

430
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:23,860
You called who stupid?

431
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,560
Up to you then. Don't cry if he's taken by someone else.

432
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:29,420
Who dares?

433
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:33,880
You know what?

434
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:36,640
Tomorrow,

435
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:39,360
someone will perish.

436
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:44,520
What the f*ck are you looking at?

437
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:53,320
It's a mosquito.

438
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:54,580
See?

439
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:56,240
The sun already sets.

440
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,300
Your story is so damn long.

441
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,780
Hahaha.

442
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,760
Oh.

443
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,580
I see.

444
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:08,340
So when you came to find me at college,

445
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,740
you were...

446
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,400
I was...?

447
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,320
We were beaten!

448
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,080
Well.

449
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,740
It proves to me that fate is real, though.

450
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,840
Woah. // Ahem!

451
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:26,320
Bleurgh!

452
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:27,160
Thanks.

453
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,220
I know you're gonna puke.

454
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,400
Haha.

455
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,740
Stop laughing! How about you?

456
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,840
After his parents gave permission

457
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,240
and he reached legal age,

458
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,500
you stop holding back.

459
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,060
What?

460
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,600
What did I even do?

461
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:42,860
But

462
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:44,620
he's kind of naughty.

463
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:47,400
He asked me to...

464
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:50,340
He asked me to teach him.

465
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,440
Teach him what?

466
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:54,960
Class lessons?

467
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:56,660
Sports?

468
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:59,760
Video games?

469
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,840
Cooking?

470
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,440
Or did you teach him to...

471
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,980
To cook omelette.

472
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:09,120
Are you crazy?! Who's gonna teach about that?!

473
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,100
Hahaha.

474
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:11,760
That's not it.

475
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:14,160
So

476
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,420
He asked me to teach him...

477
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:25,520
Unyielding bear

478
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:28,680
Hey.

479
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:30,500
Why don't you make a wish first, Nim?

480
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,440
You've turned 18 this year.

481
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,020
Anything you want

482
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:37,600
and any colleges you wish to go,

483
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,060
you can make a wish.

484
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:43,720
I'll definitely pass the entrance exam, so there's no need for that one.

485
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:47,520
Alright, I know you're smart.

486
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:49,960
So what kind of present do you want?

487
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,540
Just tell me.

488
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:53,040
I'll buy it for you.

489
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:55,600
Don't buy anything.

490
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:58,820
I only want you to do something for me.

491
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:01,980
What is it?

492
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,620
What do you want me to do?

493
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:10,580
The movie I watched the other day has some love scenes.

494
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:13,800
And Point was fooling around by trying to kiss me.

495
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:14,860
Remember?

496
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:17,640
Of course!

497
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,860
You and Point almost kissed.

498
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:23,960
You're not even 18, so it's very improper.

499
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:27,180
But now I'm 18.

500
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:29,500
I'm 18 years old.

501
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:32,740
So?

502
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,100
You have to...

503
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,100
teach me how to kiss.

504
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:39,660
Huh?

505
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,020
You want me to teach you that?

506
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,840
Why? I'm not a kid anymore.

507
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,300
I'm already 18.

508
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:52,040
My parents also allowed you to be my guardian.

509
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:56,340
Do you not want to teach me?

510
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:02,680
Or

511
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,200
Do you want Point to teach me?

512
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,300
Fine.

513
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:08,780
I'm gonna asked him.

514
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:09,400
No.

515
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:11,740
Absolutely not.

516
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,680
I'll be the one to teach you.

517
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:18,560
Yes, please.

518
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:22,120
Think of it as my birthday present.

519
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,360
If I teach you,

520
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:27,740
you can't do this with anyone else.

521
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,200
Wanna try?

522
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:38,100
But on one condition.

523
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:39,920
Alright.

524
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:41,260
Tell me.

525
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,160
I always keep my word.

526
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:48,600
I'll start

527
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:50,980
and you can't tell me to stop

528
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:53,360
until I want to.

529
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:55,740
Okay?

530
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,240
And if I don't stop,

531
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:04,600
you also can't.

532
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:13,800
Are you nervous?

533
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,000
Stop!

534
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,100
I'm new to this, Mhee.

535
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:22,940
So I'm nervous.

536
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:25,340
Are there any other ways?

537
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:28,380
What?

538
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:30,940
You said you want to do it.

539
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:32,840
do you not?

540
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:35,140
It's because I've never done this!

541
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:37,500
Can you try other ways?

542
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,220
Then I'll hold a cherry in my mouth

543
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:53,560
and let you eat it.

544
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,060
What do you think?

545
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:58,560
Ah.

546
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:02,040
Alright. I'll try.

547
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:04,880
Don't stop, ok?

548
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:23,800
Wow, you even used friut.

549
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:26,020
Ew, Mhee.

550
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,000
That's so cringe.

551
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,640
Did you do it rough?

552
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,520
How?

553
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:41,680
Well, it's a passionate kiss.

554
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:43,240
Huh?

555
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:46,840
Whatever!

556
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:50,040
Did he get some rest?

557
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:52,740
Of course.

558
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:54,520
I didn't kiss him that long.

559
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:56,420
Well

560
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,380
I was afraid he'll be obsessed with me.

561
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,840
Wow, obsessed, huh?

562
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,260
Like Chalarm's obsessed with omelette?

563
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:11,300
For Chalarm, it's not obsessed

564
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:14,360
it's addicted.

565
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:18,560
How can a person eat omelette every day?

566
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:20,560
Chalarm, I'm warning you.

567
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:23,760
I think you should get a health check.

568
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,860
By the way, lately, you haven't slept at our room.

569
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,420
And you haven't asked me to make an omelette for you.

570
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,020
Are you hiding something?

571
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:43,560
No..nothing.

572
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:46,400
You seems suspicious.

573
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:50,940
I remember it!

574
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:55,180
You used to borrow your family's car to go to the beach.

575
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,600
Spill the tea.

576
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:01,620
Nothing.

577
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,020
Tell me.

578
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:06,780
Tell me!

579
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,360
It's nothing.

580
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,740
You're not gonna talk?

581
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,280
Yes.

582
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:15,760
I'll ask again, are you going to tell us?

583
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:16,620
No.

584
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:18,620
Here you are.

585
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,620
An omelette.

586
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:21,600
Tell us.

587
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:49,740
So bored.

588
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,120
Everybody is in a relationship.

589
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:59,100
When will I find Kaijeaw's friend?

590
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:16,680
Excuse me.

591
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,440
Can I sit with you?

592
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,040
That's it?

593
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,060
Because that's all it is.

594
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:28,640
Huh?

595
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:31,040
That's all?

596
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:37,200
It's so short.

597
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:40,040
Can you tell more?

598
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:41,520
I want to hear it.

599
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:42,980
Can I make a sound instead?

600
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:44,540
Yeah.

601
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:48,860
[making weird sound]

602
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,420
[making weird sound]

603
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:54,820
[making weird sound]

604
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,140
Damn you!

605
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:03,200
Can you tell us a story that we can picture it?

606
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,220
Then...

607
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:09,679
[making weird sound]

608
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,179
Chalarm.

609
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:16,159
[making weird sound]

610
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:18,620
Maew Nam.

611
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:24,500
What the f*ck is wrong with you?

612
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:27,580
Can you tell a story that we can picture it?

613
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:29,580
That we can visualize.

614
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:33,980
Not making weird sound!

615
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:36,600
Can you tell it properly?

616
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:41,320
Can you tell it in the most romantic way?

617
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:44,500
Well, then

618
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:48,040
Harmless Shark

619
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:56,980
The weather is so nice.

620
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:01,020
A beach in the night looks scary, though.

621
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:04,820
Luckily, I have a friend like you here.

622
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:11,960
Maybe more than friend.

623
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:16,580
I'm sleepy.

624
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:18,580
Let's sleep.

625
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,220
Sleep here?

626
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:23,220
Um.

627
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:25,700
Will a mosquito bite us?

628
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:29,260
We should find a hotel around here.

629
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,740
We can see the beach right after we wake up.

630
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:36,720
That's so romantic, don't you think?

631
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:39,740
Ouch.

632
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:40,900
Chalarm.

633
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:42,100
A mosquito.

634
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:45,940
Thank you.

635
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:49,740
Let's sleep.

636
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:51,740
Chalarm.

637
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,960
Can I ask you something?

638
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,420
What?

639
00:35:56,420 --> 00:36:02,500
Do you have any hidden agenda for taking me here?

640
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:03,640
What hidden agenda?

641
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:09,080
Well, it's two people

642
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:12,720
traveling together.

643
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,660
And it's just the two of us here.

644
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:19,320
It can't be anything except...

645
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,140
That's so you.

646
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,140
Huh?

647
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:38,380
You snored in front of him?

648
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,380
Um.

649
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:42,640
What else should I do?

650
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:43,800
I was sleepy.

651
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:51,120
Well, you should figure it yourself.

652
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:54,760
You should playing in the water, dump ass!

653
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,040
It was late.

654
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:58,680
Maybe next time.

655
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:03,820
You don't get what I'm trying to say, right?

656
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:05,380
No.

657
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:10,420
Then you can ask Dino.

658
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:17,900
After they came back from Chiang Mai, they were so intimate.

659
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,600
I can tell you

660
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:24,680
Dino is the best.

661
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:25,780
Don't tell others!

662
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:27,920
You wanna eat raw pork, huh?

663
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:32,200
Hey, what are you doing?

664
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:38,780
I think we should invite others next time.

665
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:40,800
I feel lonely.

666
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,460
Lonely?

667
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,320
We are all here.

668
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,160
Isn't it enough?

669
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:55,740
I think he means inviting our lovers.

670
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:00,460
So, we can all be here together.

671
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:02,360
Yes, that's right.

672
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,880
You guys have only lover.

673
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,160
Mine is the love of my life.

674
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:09,420
Right?

675
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:11,360
Dino, don't say that.

676
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:12,220
Why?

677
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:15,420
Where do you guys sleep tonight?

678
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:16,860
Wanna sleep with us?

679
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:22,740
I can sleep anywhere.

680
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:24,920
What do you mean?

681
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:26,720
Well,

682
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:33,240
his family business isn't only an actual hotel.

683
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:37,760
He can stay at anywhere now.

684
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:39,840
What?

685
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:44,980
Ok.

686
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:46,760
I'm being calm now.

687
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:52,340
Then just don't concern about him.

688
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:56,640
We should eat and get back.

689
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:03,200
I think we should let them have a sweet night.

690
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:07,940
The night is still young for you, right?

691
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,800
Shut up.

692
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:12,820
You wanna eat pork lard again?

693
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:13,780
Bring it to me.

694
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:15,780
Damn you.

695
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,280
If I can punch you, I would.

696
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,460
Punch me here.

697
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:23,820
Wanna fight? // come on.

698
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,660
Come on.

699
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:29,140
You guys are so childish.

700
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:30,840
What are you doing?

701
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,560
This place is so comfy.

702
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:46,160
The bathroom is bigger than I thought.

703
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:51,240
But it would be nicer if it has a bathtub, right?

704
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:52,800
So I can rub your back.

705
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,080
You're so nasty.

706
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,440
Come here, I want a hug.

707
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,220
Alright.

708
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:06,620
This remind me of our first trip at Chiang Mai.

709
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:09,700
Where the jar is full, right?

710
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:12,020
Um.

711
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,940
What about your heart? Is it all mine?

712
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,760
It's already yours.

713
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:22,900
Really?

714
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:29,600
What about Temp, See-Kram, and Tart?

715
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:35,000
I'm only yours.

716
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:36,840
Don't worry about it.

717
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,340
I don't buy it.

718
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:42,940
What should I do to make you believe?

719
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,600
Action speaks louder.

720
00:41:58,100 --> 00:41:59,860
I'm really happy.

721
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:02,820
I'll always make you happy.

722
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:06,080
Even the paper star jar is full,

723
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:09,240
my love for you is never full.

724
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:15,480
I mean I'll keep loving you.

725
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,240
Dino.

726
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:24,340
I didn't believe in love at first sight.

727
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:28,320
Maybe because I've never succeeded in love.

728
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:33,840
But you're here by my side

729
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:39,680
even when in my weakest moment.

730
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:45,540
Did you know?

731
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:48,960
Actually, I didn't want to be a SOTUS leader.

732
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:52,660
I don't like seniority.

733
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:59,060
But I get that they want to keep freshman to stay in the rules.

734
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:03,140
It has an advantage though.

735
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:08,280
Freshman can gossip about us when they party.

736
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:11,140
And that's make them closer.

737
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:16,860
When freshman become junior

738
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,060
they will get it.

739
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:22,580
But I just don't get

740
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:25,960
why they don't make us close since the beginning,

741
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:29,200
why they have to make us hate each other.

742
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:33,800
When I became a leader

743
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:36,240
I want to make change.

744
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:42,460
I just

745
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:47,300
think that we're all equal.

746
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:55,600
I want them to be happy in every activities.

747
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:00,100
You're so cute, babe.

748
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:07,180
Then why did you become a leader?

749
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:11,160
Actually, it's not about the system only.

750
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:14,620
It's because of you.

751
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:22,420
We've been together for a while now.

752
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:28,420
