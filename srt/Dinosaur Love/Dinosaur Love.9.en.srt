6
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,140
is all gone.

7

There's nothing left.

8
00:00:57,940 --> 00:00:58,780
Do you get it?

9
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:06,600
I can't have a friend like you anymore.

10
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:09,200
Rak.

11
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:14,100
There's no point, Kram.

Cheers!

37
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,880
Woo!

38
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,240
So good.

39
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,820
Shabu is the best.

40
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,560
This meal is so good.

41
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,060
Hey.

42
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:20,840
Huh?

43
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,280
I have one question.

44
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:23,760
What is it?

45
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,560
Who's gonna pay for this meal?

46
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,480
Let's go Dutch.

47
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,800
It's on me.

48
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,860
Wow.

49
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,480
You're the best.

50
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,480
I'm gonna eat it all.

51
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:42,960
Hey, Rak.

52
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,420
You see this? Don't eat it.

53
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:47,680
Why?

54
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:50,160
It's a morning glory, it gives you an itch.

55
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,220
No, it's not.

56
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:56,579
Don't tell anyone you're my friend.

57
00:03:56,579 --> 00:03:58,340
So embarrassing.

58
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,680
You have to leave our gang.

59
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,440
So embarrassing.

60
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,160
You can't sit with us.

61
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,780
Shut up and eat!

62
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:11,820
Are you ok?

63
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:14,480
Yes.

64
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:17,779
Your eyes can't lie.

65
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:21,820
It's nothing.

66
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,820
You lied to me twice.

67
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,540
I told you I hate lying.

68
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:34,159
If you remain silent, I'll stop eating.

69
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,540
What?

70
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,340
You haven't had dinner yet.

71
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,680
Well.

72
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:47,480
I can tell you when your friends leave, right?

73
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,280
Then I'll go to the toilet.

74
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:20,780
Do you think he has any other reasons to lie to me except he's cheating on me?

75
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,040
It can be any reasons.

76
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:27,200
Sometimes lying can make someone feel better.

77
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,660
Don't worry.

78
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,480
It seems easy to tell the truth

79
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,540
but you used to lie too.

80
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:37,000
Do you remember the time when you lied to your mom?

81
00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:39,700
Yes.

82
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,980
You might know the reason behind it.

83
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:46,940
Hey, Dino.

84
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:47,960
Hmm?

85
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,620
I'll ask you honestly.

86
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:53,200
I looked at Rak,

87
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,320
I saw that he looked at you.

88
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,320
Yes.

89
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,340
Right? // Umm.

90
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:02,120
Let me ask you something.

91
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:05,300
What do you feel when you look at him?

92
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:07,860
I feel

93
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,380
like I want you guys to leave.

94
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:12,420
What?

95
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:15,200
I'm not finish eating.

96
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:18,740
I've just started to eat.

97
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:19,960
Eat it.

98
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:20,480
Ok.

99
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:33,380
Should we have a sleepover tonight?

100
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:34,920
Good idea.

101
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,920
After we're full, we can sleep here.

102
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,300
What? Go back home.

103
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:42,100
Bro.

104
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,880
I don't want to.

105
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,200
Let's play game.

106
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,720
We can play game all night.

107
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:52,300
What the hell?

108
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,520
You're drunk, better go back home.

109
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,340
Damn.

110
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,500
Anyway,

111
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,580
What?

112
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,040
You look drunk, Top.

113
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,560
Your face starts to turn red.

114
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,560
Nonsense, Bank.

115
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,780
I'm not drunk, can't you see?

116
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:12,440
You are.

117
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,140
I'm not.

118
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,740
Then cheers.

119
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:18,800
Come on.

120
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,080
Cheers.

121
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,400
Wow.

122
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,400
So good.

123
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,400
The Shabu is yummy.

124
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,360
You'd better go to sleep.

125
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:36,840
Are you alright?

126
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:41,140
I think I need to go to the toilet.

127
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,580
What's wrong?

128
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:43,980
I think I'll just

129
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:48,500
Hey!

130
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:51,860
Damn, Top.

131
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,620
I'll take care of him.

132
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,020
Damn you.

133
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:22,160
Do you have anything to say?

134
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:26,420
Dino worries about you.

135
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,039
You can be honest with him.

136
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,900
The more you lie, the more he'll be frustrated.

137
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,679
He's very straightforward.

138
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:40,679
He says what he thinks.

139
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,159
He always puts other people first,

140
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,080
especially his lover and friends.

141
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:52,860
I know.

142
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:56,940
Is he alright?

143
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:59,720
I think I need to take Top home.

144
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,340
Will you go too, Bank?

145
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,880
Yes.

146
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,000
See you later, Rak.

147
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:06,880
See you, Dino.

148
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:07,980
Please look after Top.

149
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,540
He's so drunk.

150
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:10,860
Walk carefully.

151
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:15,920
Dino.

152
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:17,920
What?

153
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,000
Are you drunk?

154
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,080
Little bit.

155
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,260
Then I'll clean up.

156
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,080
No need, I can do tomorrow.

157
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,540
If you're drunk and hurt yourself, then I'll be a widower.

158
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:35,280
I might need to find a new lover.

159
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,000
I won't allow that.

160
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:44,200
Are you jealous?

161
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,520
Yes.

162
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:50,000
How can I find a better lover that you?

163
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:56,900
Are you still mad at me?

164
00:09:59,180 --> 00:09:59,920
Yeah.

165
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,580
Give me a smile, please.

166
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,060
Give me a smile.

167
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:08,100
Yeah.

168
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,680
I love you, Rak.

169
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,040
I love you too.

170
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:16,440
Umm.

171
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,120
Are you still mad?

172
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,560
I'll punish you for lying to me.

173
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,240
I surrender you.

174
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,420
What will you do?

175
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,920
You said it yourself, babe.

176
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:32,560
Hmm?

177
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:57,840
Chalarm.

178
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,060
Everything looks so tasty.

179
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,400
It also has Marian Plum.

180
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,280
Where is an omelette?

181
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,380
There's no omelette.

182
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:12,620
Huh?

183
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,060
This is a bakery shop.

184
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:16,600
They don't have omelette.

185
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,060
Really?

186
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,480
They have cake and coffee.

187
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:24,560
I want omelette.

188
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,400
Can you have a cake instead?

189
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,700
Cake is tasty too.

190
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,500
I don't want to.

191
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,240
Yeah, I'm at the coffee shop.

192
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:37,680
What do you want?

193
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,080
Huh?

194
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,440
Latte

195
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,120
extra milk

196
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,240
extra sweet

197
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:46,580
add whip cream

198
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,020
with caramel syrup

199
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,500
and topping with Oreo.

200
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,380
And 1 cheese tart.

201
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:53,680
You gonna have a diabetes for sure.

202
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:57,720
What an order!

203
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,180
My baby.

204
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:09,060
What?

205
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,240
Ah.

206
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,560
A latte, extra milk, extra sweet, add whip cream

207
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,480
with caramel syrup and Oreo topping, right?

208
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,140
Ok.

209
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:18,840
And 1 cheese tart.

210
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:21,380
Ok, I got this.

211
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:24,100
I'll bring it to you.

212
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,740
See you, baby.

213
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:28,140
So cute.

214
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:28,680
Suea.

215
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,600
Who did you talk to?

216
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,480
You made such a fierce voice.

217
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,660
What?

218
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,780
It's called a simp voice.

219
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:39,740
Dino is the one who has a fierce voice.

220
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,440
Let me ask you something.

221
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,700
Aren't you afraid of Dino?

222
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,500
At first, I admit that I was afraid of him

223
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,460
but actually, he's kind.

224
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,440
He doesn't look fierce as you thought.

225
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:58,640
Really?

226
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,440
I think he's so fierce.

227
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,440
He likes to hit me.

228
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,340
What a man!

229
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:10,180
Even he's older than me, I don't pay him any respect.

230
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,140
I've never called him senior.

231
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,800
What a man he is!

232
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,260
Don't listen to him too much.

233
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,200
What are you talking?

234
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,100
Dino.

235
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:24,940
It's me.

236
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:29,060
I was complimenting on you.

237
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:32,560
Why you finish class so late?

238
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:33,940
It's be cause the professor.

239
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,500
What would you like to have?

240
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:36,960
BBQ.

241
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:38,680
I asked my boyfriend.

242
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,060
BBQ is fine.

243
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,700
Then we all go together.

244
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,800
I'll bring Chalarm with me.

245
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,600
Wanna join? It's on me.

246
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,380
Can I bring Kaijeaw?

247
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,000
No, you can't.

248
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,180
You can't bring a sneak to eat BBQ.

249
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:57,140
What about Kaitoon?

250
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,600
No!

251
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,080
You can't bring any animals with you.

252
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,140
Hmm?

253
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:07,520
Ok?

254
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:09,060
I don't want to go.

255
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,880
Why?

256
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,980
I'm sick being with a couple.

257
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,280
What?

258
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:27,480
Let's go.

259
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,900
Let's go!

260
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,980
Wait!

261
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,780
I forgot to order a coffee.

262
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:39,400
I would like to have a latte

263
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,600
extra milk, extra sweet, add whip cream, caramel syrup and Oreo topping.

264
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,300
And 1 cheese tart.

265
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:47,460
Yes.

266
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,800
Hey, wait for me!

267
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:56,820
Can you hurry up?

268
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:59,240
Er...yes.

269
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:00,320
Please be hurry.

270
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,100
Come in.

271
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:19,680
Are you afraid?

272
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,180
Little bit.

273
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:24,980
Let's get inside.

274
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:26,980
Umm.

275
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:35,260
Your hotel is beautiful.

276
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,340
Thank you so much.

277
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:47,080
I got it from my dad.

278
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,040
They are here.

279
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:52,120
Hello, mom and dad.

280
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,120
Hello, aunty.

281
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:04,280
You can sit next to me.

282
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,020
It looks yummy, right?

283
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,460
You have to try.

284
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,100
I baked it myself.

285
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:37,920
Here you are.

286
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,020
How's it?

287
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,220
Delicious.

288
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,660
You can eat it more, if you like.

289
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:05,839
Ai, that's Dino.

290
00:17:06,099 --> 00:17:07,420
Do you remember him?

291
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:10,460
You liked to sneak out and play with him when you were kid.

292
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,260
Yes, I do.

293
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:16,280
Dino, this is Ai, do you remember her?

294
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:18,400
The girl who liked to follow you.

295
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:21,920
I had to get her out from you every day.

296
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:23,720
Yes, I do.

297
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:31,360
Wow, they remember each other.

298
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:35,500
Ai is blushing.

299
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:40,600
When will we talk about that?

300
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,340
I'm not going to marry her.

301
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:51,580
Dino.

302
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,260
I said what I said.

303
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,940
Didn't we come here to talk about the marriage?

304
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:58,360
I bring my lover here to meet my parents

305
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:00,200
not to join a blind date.

306
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,560
If that's all, I'll take my leave.

307
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,620
I've driven a long way.

308
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:09,140
Um, go ahead.

309
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,940
Take some rest.

310
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,360
Let's talk again tomorrow.

311
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,480
Why don't you ask for a one day leave?

312
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:19,620
I'll make more sweet for your boyfriend.

313
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:26,160
Take a good care of my son in law.

314
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:27,460
Sure.

315
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,060
Let's go.

316
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:40,780
Yes, mom?

317
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:45,060
I know, don't worry.

318
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:47,960
Because...

319
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,320
you've got a good son in law.

320
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,220
Yes. Take care.

321
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,340
Your mom is so nice.

322
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,040
Um.

323
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,360
Your dad also talked to me.

324
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:05,760
Mhm.

325
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:08,140
He doesn't hate you.

326
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:14,800
I thought it'd be like in the movie.

327
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:16,800
How so?

328
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:22,180
Like... "If you're not gonna marry her,

329
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,840
get out of this house immediately!"

330
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:26,840
My family isn't that dramatic.

331
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:29,960
Who knows?

332
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:33,000
I felt as if we were in Bridgerton.

333
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,760
The one that has two mean step sisters?

334
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,100
No, Dino.

335
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:39,960
That's Cinderella.

336
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,400
Oh, is it? I don't usually watch movies.

337
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,620
You smile a lot more than before.

338
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,040
Thanks to you.

339
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,120
I kind of envy myself

340
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,800
for having you as my boyfriend.

341
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:58,000
What nonsense is that?

342
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,520
Dino.

343
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,460
You're not being gentle.

344
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,040
I'm not a gentleman, though.

345
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:11,060
Can't you be a little gentle to me?

346
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,240
I don't want you to expect much.

347
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:17,660
I love you, Rak.

348
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,640
You're my only one.

349
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:23,280
I hope it'll make up for my lack of sensitivity.

350
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,400
When Chalarm dye his hair grey,

351
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:28,740
you dye yours red.

352
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:31,640
because you saw I admired him, didn't you?

353
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,380
How did you find out?

354
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,880
I think it's true

355
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,720
that...

356
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,980
You look great with red hair.

357
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:46,660
Er...

358
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,100
That's enough!

359
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,700
Black hair is good.

360
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,600
But red hair is fantastic.

361
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,440
No!

362
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,080
Dino, come here!

363
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:14,440
Yeah, I'm heading out.

364
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,440
Just one moment.

365
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,200
Rak.

366
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,500
The juniors are hanging out. Can you stay by yourself?

367
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,160
Can't you just skip it?

368
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:33,900
It's not gonna be long. I'll be right back.

369
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,400
Huh?

370
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:24,760
Guys.

371
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,480
I'm not going anymore.

372
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:39,860
Are you seducing me?

373
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:43,440
No, I didn't mean to.

374
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,120
It's all sticky.

375
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,980
Let me go shower first.

376
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,740
Why don't you eat more?

377
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:01,100
It's sticky...

378
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:07,780
I can handle that.

379
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,660
Are you ready?

380
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:49,520
I'm ready when you are, daddy.

381
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:02,880
Am I doing great, Rak?

382
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:07,040
You're the best.

383
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:35,520
Hey..

384
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,520
What a coincidence, Rak!

385
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,280
What are you doing here all alone?

386
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,240
I'm waiting for my boyfriend.

387
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,280
Your boyfriend?

388
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:46,920
Haha.

389
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,800
Should I join you?

390
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:51,140
I don't want to bother you.

391
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,560
It's not a bother.

392
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:57,780
Your boyfriend always leave you in tough situations.

393
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,420
If I were him,

394
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:04,300
I wouldn't leave you alone like this.

395
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,080
By the way,

396
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,220
do you remember me?

397
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:12,220
You're...

398
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:14,240
Let's just say...

399
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,260
I'm Tart.

400
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,600
The glasses guy

401
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,300
whom you helped from being bullied

402
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,700
in your first year of high school.

403
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:23,960
Is that ring a bell?

404
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,600
Kind of.

405
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,600
So you remember me now?

406
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,400
Hm.

407
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,200
It sounds familiar.

408
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,200
That's good enough.

409
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:42,600
I miss you so much, you know?

410
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:46,120
After transferring to another school,

411
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,160
I've never met you again.

412
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:52,580
And you didn't accept my friend request on Facebook.

413
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:55,080
Is it because...

414
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:57,800
I look much better?

415
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:02,300
I was a shorty, unlike right now that I'm this tall.

416
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:04,040
It's amazing.

417
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,480
Also, I saw you several days ago

418
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:12,400
when you were eating with your friends, not your boyfriend.

419
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:15,000
I immediately recognized you.

420
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:17,100
Besides,

421
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,140
Er...

422
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:20,940
I called you.

423
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,380
But your boyfriend picked up the call.

424
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:26,300
What a shame. I wanna talk to you, not him.

425
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:28,240
Too bad.

426
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,760
Then I changed my phone number

427
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,320
but you didn't answer my call.

428
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:35,180
Did you change your number?

429
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:38,440
Where did you get my number?

430
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,880
If you're curious, why don't we have a meal together?

431
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,280
So we can have a deep talk.

432
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,300
Just kidding.

433
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,400
I bought it from a girl in your faculty

434
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:59,200
for 2,000 baht.

435
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:02,820
Quite pricey. If you ask me.

436
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,140
But the point is I got your number

437
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:07,520
so it's convenient.

438
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:08,900
Tart.

439
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,800
Can I say something?

440
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:16,700
I don't have to be close to you

441
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:19,760
just because I remember you.

442
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:23,680
You're aware that I already have a boyfriend, right?

443
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:26,480
He doesn't like you.

444
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:30,300
I don't want to have an argument with him.

445
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,640
Please understand me.

446
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:34,960
Then I'll go first.

447
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:38,780
I'm gonna flirt with you.

448
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:44,360
I like you.

449
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:48,720
Your boyfriend doesn't matter.

450
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:50,720
I like you a lot.

451
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,440
Let's see...

452
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:56,240
if I can get the two of you to break up.

453
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,380
I'm off.

454
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,320
Back to skateboarding.

455
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,420
Who the hell is that guy?

456
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:15,340
Dino, that's Tart.

457
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:17,920
Um.

458
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:21,400
Are you mad?

459
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,300
Nope.

460
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,480
I'm just frustrated.

461
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:25,960
Really?

462
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,520
You're frustrated?

463
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,640
Hm. That's enough.

464
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,580
Think about it...

465
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,140
if someone's trying to steal my rabbit,

466
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:35,660
what should I do?

467
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:40,240
Try me if he dares.

468
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:41,880
Are you jealous?

469
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:43,460
Ah.

470
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:44,820
Let's head back.

471
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:47,220
Haha.

472
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:50,260
You're jealous, aren't you?

473
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:52,580
Yeah!

474
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:53,920
Let's get going.

475
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:56,000
Alright.

476
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,000
We can continue this in our room.

477
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:57,620
What?

478
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:29,200
Rak! Please wait!

479
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:33,100
Did you follow me again?

480
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,000
That's not it!

481
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,420
I'm here for reading.

482
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,600
Then I'll be leaving.

483
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:40,020
Don't go just yet, Rak.

484
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,540
You ignore me again.

485
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:44,220
Should I kiss your cheeks as a punishment?

486
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:50,620
Please talk to me.

487
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:56,360
I promised I won't follow you to your house anymore.

488
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,120
What do you want to talk about?

489
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,220
Yes!

490
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,800
You finally talked to me.

491
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:07,760
Is that all?

492
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:10,540
No. The thing is...

493
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:14,060
I wanna tell you that

494
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,440
I'll stop bothering you for real.

495
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:18,440
I...

496
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:20,860
I've been thinking about it

497
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:24,540
since your lover and his peers ganged up against me

498
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,540
and he almost punched me.

499
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:30,820
I was scared and didn't know what to do.

500
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:33,880
That's why I'm here to tell you

501
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,360
that I'll stop messing with you.

502
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:42,600
Just don't do this to anyone else again.

503
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:46,220
Yes, Rak.

504
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:49,780
So...

505
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:52,160
is that all you want to say?

506
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,640
Then I'm going first.

507
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:57,520
You should head home

508
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,320
and stop following me for good.

509
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,220
Please take care of yourself.

510
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:05,360
Alright.

511
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,420
You're back?

512
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:26,980
Um.

513
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:29,820
Where did you go?

514
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,460
A cafe.

515
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:35,620
It's really hot, so I'm worn out.

516
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,780
Come here. Let me cheer you up with a hug.

517
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:38,340
Hm.

518
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,460
Better?

519
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:45,440
Well.

520
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:47,160
It is.

521
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,380
Anyway,

522
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,000
I just met Tart at the cafe.

523
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,200
He stalked you again?

524
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,120
Mhm.

525
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:01,460
I think he followed me to places I used to go.

526
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:03,160
Because a few days ago

527
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:07,960
he waited for me at the bus stop.

528
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:08,800
Really?

529
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,140
What is he up tp?

530
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:13,620
When I tried to find him at his school, he didn't show up.

531
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:14,880
Huh?

532
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,000
You...

533
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,160
You went to his school?

534
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:23,920
Er...

535
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:26,960
Yeah, I was... worried about you.

536
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:30,940
Hm.

537
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:34,320
He said he'll stop following me.

538
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:36,600
Do you believe it?

539
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:37,500
Hm?

540
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:41,000
I don't completely trust him.

541
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,640
Just be careful.

542
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:47,520
Tell me if anything goes wrong.

543
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:48,440
Alright?

544
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:50,460
Mhm.

545
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:55,040
I'm not afraid since I have you.

546
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,040
That's right.

547
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,520
Don't be too nice to others.

548
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:02,320
Or I'll turn evil.

549
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:05,400
I like that you're possessive.

550
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:07,340
But I don't.

551
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:08,740
If it was the past me,

552
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:11,500
that idiot would be beaten right away.

553
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:13,780
That a*shole, for example...

554
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,720
I just wanna tell him to stay away from you.

555
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,720
but he started talking shi*t to me

556
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:21,280
So I taught him a lesson.

557
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,580
But you were punched, too.

558
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:26,220
How could I not?

559
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:28,620
I was alone, and they have 5 people.

560
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:34,540
I don't want you to get into another fight.

561
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,900
It depends. If that idiot stops, then so do I.

562
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:39,500
Dino.

563
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:41,280
Fine. I got it.

564
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:43,100
I'll try to be reasonable.

565
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:44,200
Umm.

566
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:45,020
Okay?

567
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:47,220
You know what? You're the best!

568
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:50,100
Yeah. Just watch your TV.

569
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:53,440
Rak.

570
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:56,040
There's our university star contest tomorrow.

571
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:59,800
The boyfriend of Chalarm's friend is a faculty star.

572
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:00,900
Will you go take a look?

573
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:03,020
Nah.

574
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:07,100
I'll go in the evening when they announce the winner.

575
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:07,820
Hm.

576
00:34:08,219 --> 00:34:09,600
Good. Then I can sleep all day.

577
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:10,980
Um.

578
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:13,820
You should have a good rest.

579
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,179
Are you worried?

580
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:17,739
Well...

581
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:20,320
I'm worried about my boyfriend.

582
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:23,960
You didn't get enough sleep these days.

583
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:26,760
We're not gonna sleep if you talk like this.

584
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:29,840
Dino.

585
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:31,620
You should sleep!

586
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:34,780
Do you still have energy?

587
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,239
If it's f*cking you,

588
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,080
I'm always full of energy.

589
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:43,980
Dino!

590
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:46,900
Huh?

591
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:51,040
Give me a sec.

592
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:53,719
Someone's calling.

593
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:04,520
Who is it?

594
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:05,860
Hm.

595
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:08,040
It's that guy again.

596
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:09,920
Again?

597
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:11,500
Hm.

598
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,540
So he's not gonna stop?

599
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,540
Don't worry, I'll go with you.

600
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:23,740
Thank you.

601
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:25,280
Um.

602
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:31,280
Let's keep going.

603
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:34,260
Hmm, Dino!

604
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:48,040
I'm not sure if he has any tricks up his sleeve.

605
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:49,600
Never mind.

606
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,360
Here he comes.

607
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:54,220
Woah.

608
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,320
So many people.

609
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,000
Rak, have you been waiting long?

610
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,280
No.

611
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,280
He's not waiting for anyone.

612
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:04,940
We need to talk.

613
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:07,940
I don't wanna talk to you.

614
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:09,040
You don't have a choice.

615
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:11,160
Get away from my man.

616
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:13,800
Stop following and texting him.

617
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,800
I f*cking hate people like you who enjoy being a third wheel.

618
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:18,560
But I've known him longer than you.

619
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,440
So what?

620
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,480
That's just a lame excuse.

621
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:23,000
Is that all you want to say?

622
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:24,300
Let's go, Rak.

623
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,440
Who do you think you are?

624
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,060
Huh?

625
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:32,060
You look like a gangster.

626
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:35,400
I only said a few words and you're this furious.

627
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,440
You can't even restrain yourself.

628
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,240
Have you ever thought that...

629
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,520
someone like you would end up making Rak upset?

630
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:44,820
Dino.

631
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,020
Let's go.

632
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:47,280
Rak.

633
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:48,900
I like you.

634
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,520
What the f*ck did you just say?!

635
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:50,900
Hey.

636
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,060
Dino!

637
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:53,620
Let me go!

638
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,880
Who do you like?!

639
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,520
Say that again!

640
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:59,060
Say it!

641
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:00,160
Dino! Stop!

642
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,420
People are shooting.

643
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,900
Look around.

644
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:07,920
Delete it!

645
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:09,320
You too!

646
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,160
Hehe.

647
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:13,640
Why the f*ck are you laughing?!

648
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,480
Answer me!

649
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:19,520
There's no use even if you ask them to delete it.

650
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:22,620
This scandal will be all over Twitter.

651
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:23,900
F*CK OFF!

652
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:25,840
Let go of me! // Calm down!

653
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:26,860
YOU M*THER*UCKER!!

654
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,340
Dino!

655
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:29,440
That's enough, man.

656
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:30,100
You need to stop!

657
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,120
Or I'll be mad at you!

658
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,360
At me?!

659
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:36,520
Dino!

660
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:37,960
What?

661
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:39,920
Are you mad because I punched him?

662
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:42,040
Say that again.

663
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,680
that bullsh*t.

664
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:44,940
Say it.

665
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:46,300
Dino.

666
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:47,320
Say it.

667
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:48,120
Stop.

668
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,080
Sorry.

669
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:19,400
Please don't record it.

670
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:21,640
It's a misunderstanding.

671
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:23,640
Thank you.

672
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,640
Sorry.

673
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:29,380
Please don't record, it's just a misunderstanding.

674
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,560
I'm so sorry.

675
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:31,760
Sorry.

676
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:33,280
Sorry.

677
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:37,220
Calm down.

678
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:44,160
I'm not mad at Dino for punching him.

679
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:46,860
I just want him to be less furious.

680
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:48,800
Um.

681
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,300
Dino is a hot-headed person.

682
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:53,740
Let him be for awhile.

683
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:55,380
And you,

684
00:38:57,180 --> 00:39:01,020
you like to get yourself in trouble, aren't you?

685
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:02,000
Yeah.

686
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:14,900
Rak.

687
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,120
Why it has to be him?

688
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,140
What the f*ck?!

689
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:19,640
Dino!

690
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:22,220
Why it has to be me who face this situation?

691
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:24,220
I like you.

692
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:26,220
Say it again!!

693
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:26,940
Dino!

694
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:29,140
This is what like means?

695
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:32,380
You take picture of me.

696
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:34,720
You set me and my boyfriend by the ears.

697
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:37,880
And you said you like me?

698
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,460
This is how you act toward people you like?

699
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:41,740
Rak.

700
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:45,300
You used to tell me you hate a man like Dino.

701
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,820
But you ended up with him.

702
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,520
It's my business.

703
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,520
It's not your business.

704
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:56,940
Stay away from me,

705
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:58,940
I'm bagging you.

706
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:06,640
I'll never leave him even though how hard you try.

707
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:16,860
You don't have to like me because I help you once.

708
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:23,340
I couldn't recognize you.

709
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:26,980
I couldn't even recognize your name.

710
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:31,740
It means that I've never paid attention to you.

711
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:38,280
Let's go, Rak.

712
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:54,780
[When will you be my lover?]

713
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:56,960
Directed by Zanook and Tonnam Piamchon.

714
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:02,780
Dinosaur Love's uncut version is only available at IQIYI and iQ.com

715
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:06,220
[I’m not imagining things]

716
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:10,720
[You're talented at making a man think about you]

717
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:14,860
[and yearn for you every day]

718
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:39,240
[When will you be my lover?]

719
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:42,100
[I'm counting the days until I can be yours]

720
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,820
[I smile every time we meet]

721
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:46,560
[And you feel the same way]

722
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:51,660
I think you need to talk, no matter how big or small the issue is.

723
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:58,940
The more you wait, the more you're unhappy.

724
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:03,680
Did you know that I hurt?

725
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:09,580
Dino.

726
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:10,120
Hm?

727
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:13,720
Can you teach me how to play guitar?

728
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:17,020
Of course.
