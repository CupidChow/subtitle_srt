This series is adapted from novel. All characters, stories, and scenarios are made up. Viewer discretion is required and some actions can't be followed.

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:05,020
That's cheeky.

3
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:14,740
Dino.

4
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,160
Dino.

5
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,800
I know what you mean.

6
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:29,180
Good boy. Let me reward you.

7
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:32,500
Why?

8
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,660
Don't you like it?

9
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,440
Mek!

10
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:37,780
Dino.

11
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:43,160
Dino.

12
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:46,700
I'm sorry.

13
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,760
I'm still... not ready.

14
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,100
Dino.

15
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,300
Your hair color.

16
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,039
"Miss you"

17
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,520
Someone sent it to me.

18
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,920
I don't know who.

19
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,400
If you don't know, you shouldn't take it.

20
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:21,420
Understand?

21
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:24,980
Wait here, I'll go to the restroom.

22
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:26,620
Um.

23
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:36,280
Rak!

24
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,120
Hello.

25
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:42,479
Do you remember me?

26
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,320
You have such a short memory.

27
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,100
I'm a skateboard guy who hit you.

28
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:51,100
Ah.

29
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:52,740
Glasses guy?

30
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:55,340
What?

31
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,640
My name is Tart.

32
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,120
I didn't wear glasses today.

33
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:03,680
What if I do this, do you remember me now?

34
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:07,420
You're smiling.

35
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,080
You're such a cutie.

36
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,200
Anyway, what are you doing here?

37
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:16,180
I'm waiting for my boyfriend, he's in the restroom.

38
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,300
You're waiting for you boyfriend.

39
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:21,320
The red hair guy?

40
00:02:22,579 --> 00:02:23,760
Yes, that one.

41
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,520
I think he's not the one for you.

42
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,780
Whatever, I have to go, see you.

43
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:40,200

What's wrong.

66
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:08,600
No.

67
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:10,460
It's nothing.

68
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:14,000
Ah, my friends will come over to work.

69
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,100
Then I'll go back to my room.

70
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,160
Why not go back tomorrow?

71
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:25,260
It's improper since your friends are coming.

72
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,600
Who said it's improper?

73
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:27,700
Me.

74
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,880
Like, you have many friends.

75
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:35,820
So it'd be strange for me to be there.

76
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:37,520
But you're my man.

77
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:40,560
Dino!

78
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:42,220
Here you are.

79
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:43,920
Thank you.

80
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:45,720
Yeah.

81
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:46,600
Let's go.

82
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,800
Dino.

83
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:13,500
What's up?

84
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,960
Today I met the guy who hit me.

85
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:18,400
Where?

86
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:19,780
Well,

87
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,300
at the cafe.

88
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:23,740
Why did you just tell me now?

89
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,680
Because you're hot-headed.

90
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:30,380
You think I'd punch him?

91
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:33,840
Will you?

92
00:05:35,159 --> 00:05:35,840
You guess.

93
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,820
I'll let it pass just this once.

94
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:43,880
Why?

95
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,740
If there's next time,

96
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,060
the one that will be punched

97
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,460
is not him.

98
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:57,000
So you will punch me?

99
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,340
Yeah, you're doomed.

100
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:05,840
Got it?

101
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,900
Next time... // I feel like pinching you.

102
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,700
Next time I'll tell you if anything happens, okay?

103
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:15,440
Um.

104
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,040
Keep your word.

105
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:18,940
Please stop being mad.

106
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:20,940
Come here.

107
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:24,020
Let me do it again. // Hmm. Ow!

108
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:26,720
Dino.

109
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,660
Dino!

110
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:29,260
Hey, don't knock too hard.

111
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,260
Eh, I'm sorry, alright?

112
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:32,380
Dino!

113
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,380
Never mind. Let them be for now.

114
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:35,620
But...

115
00:06:36,659 --> 00:06:37,620
They are your friends.

116
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:44,920
Let them be.

117
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,120
I...

118
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,320
am very possessive.

119
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,000
I know what I did is somewhat bad

120
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:57,520
but everything I have

121
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:01,320
I give my all to you.

122
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,100
I know.

123
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,820
Promise me one thing.

124
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,400
Don't dumb me even if you find someone better than me.

125
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:16,820
How could I dumb you?

126
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,740
You are very nice to me.

127
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,820
Give me a sec.

128
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:35,140
You're so late! // I know right? // Boo!

129
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,800
Watch out!

130
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,920
Go go go!

131
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:47,920
In the front! // Help me! // Coming.

132
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:51,720
Why don't you help me?! // I'm coming!

133
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,720
Done. // Phew.

134
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:58,860
Back side! // Sh*t!

135
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,800
F*ck! Why would they come from the back?!

136
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,560
We're doomed.

137
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,820
Did someone get shot?

138
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:09,180
It's a game.

139
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,120
Oh.

140
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,960
Keep your voice down, guys.

141
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,160
My boyfriend is working.

142
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,280
I'm sorry, Rak.

143
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:25,500
I had no idea this room has become a love nest.

144
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:28,260
We'll lower our voices for you.

145
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:32,539
I also have no clue about your love nest.

146
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:36,200
Yeah, you didn't tell us beforehand.

147
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:39,280
Just play your game and be quiet, dude.

148
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:45,240
Let's end it quickly so we can have a drink.

149
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,240
Um.

150
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:53,000
Let's pick up items. // Roger that.

151
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:56,260
I'll watch your back. // Good. Come with me, Bank.

152
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,700
I'll go make instant noodle.

153
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,300
Do you want some?

154
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,340
Um, make one for me.

155
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:04,540
Rak.

156
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:08,260
How about us? We're hungry, too.

157
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:11,360
That's right. You're gonna make it for Dino anyway.

158
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,180
Why don't you make some for the three of us?

159
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:14,660
We're also hungry.

160
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,140
That's enough, man.

161
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,520
Eat what you have.

162
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,060
You already have seaweed and pizza!

163
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,600
I have everything

164
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,840
but someone who'll cook for me.

165
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,840
I have everything but someone who'll feed me.

166
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,660
I have everything but a boyfriend.

167
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:42,500
Boohoo!

168
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,100
Let's have a toast.

169
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,960
I can't decide.

170
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,600
What should I drink?

171
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:53,940
What do you want?

172
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,740
Just a perfect amount.

173
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:58,940
Just a little.

174
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:02,920
Hello.

175
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:05,420
Hello, Dino. Can you meet me at the faculty?

176
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,960
I want to talk to you.

177
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:07,800
I'm coming.

178
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,720
It's done.

179
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,420
Rak.

180
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,420
I'm going out for a while.

181
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,120
Where are you going?

182
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,400
I'm gonna see my friend.

183
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:28,960
Just about 15 minutes.

184
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,280
The one named Sim?

185
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:32,900
Mhm.

186
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:34,900
Um.

187
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:39,500
I give you 1 hour.

188
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:42,600
Why are you so generous?

189
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,340
Because

190
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,480
I'm your rabbit.

191
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:47,820
Like this.

192
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:52,900
Why?

193
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:54,720
You're really cute.

194
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:59,460
So you admit that you're my rabbit?

195
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:02,120
Dino.

196
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,900
When are you going? Will it be long?

197
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,120
No, I'll be right back.

198
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:10,820
Fine, we'll wait for you.

199
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:15,960
I'm off.

200
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,860
Alright.

201
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,740
Good luck, bro. // Make way for me. // Okay.

202
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,040
I'll hurry back.

203
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,400
Um. // See ya.

204
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:12,960
Hey.

205
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:18,840
Long time no see.

206
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,260
What do you want to tell me?

207
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,480
Have you been well?

208
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,400
I feel like we didn't talk for ages.

209
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,500
You are the one who avoided me.

210
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:46,320
Ha, I don't dare to talk to you.

211
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,120
I feel bad for what I did.

212
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,100
If you do,

213
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:54,880
why did you do it in the first place?

214
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:07,440
I was worried about mom.

215
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:13,840
I'm sorry.

216
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,420
I know I made you disappointed.

217
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,320
At that time, I just think that...

218
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,040
you'll find your way out of trouble and be fine.

219
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,740
But my mom can't do that.

220
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,060
I know I was an asshole...

221
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:41,540
for not thinking about your parents.

222
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,740
They must be in so much pain.

223
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,420
And it'd be a hole in my life.

224
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,620
So I have no courage to face you.

225
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:04,000
If only you had resented or punched me,

226
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,720
I would have felt much better.

227
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,040
But that day, you did nothing.

228
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,180
You...

229
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,620
You acted like normal, with just a hint of anger.

230
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,420
As if you'll forget everything with the passage of time.

231
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:29,860
I don't forget.

232
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,580
I just give you a chance.

233
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:38,760
Damn.

234
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:43,520
You make me feel even more guilty.

235
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:56,420
Your hair is really cool.

236
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:58,520
It suits you.

237
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,680
That's what my boyfriend said.

238
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:04,700
You mean Rak?

239
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:06,320
Uh.

240
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,920
You know? I'm so surprised...

241
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,280
that you have a boyfriend.

242
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:19,360
You neither use social media, nor enjoy going out.

243
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,620
I thought you'd be single forever.

244
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,880
I thought so, too.

245
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,520
Hey.

246
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,000
I'm...

247
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,180
gonna move

248
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,760
to the south.

249
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,880
I was like... should I tell you?

250
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:07,300
Or should I just leave and vanish from your life?

251
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,100
So you can forget an idiot like me.

252
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,120
But I couldn't.

253
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:27,540
I miss you.

254
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,640
I want you to know where I'm gonna live.

255
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:36,920
Just in case.

256
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,080
What's it like?

257
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:48,040
The place you're moving to.

258
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:52,400
Good.

259
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,240
It's my relative's house.

260
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,280
They give mom a job.

261
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,300
I can't leave her side. That's why.

262
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:14,740
Good luck.

263
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:34,960
Yeah.

264
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,240
I have to go.

265
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:43,340
How will you get home?

266
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:48,380
I came with Phoom.

267
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:51,340
He doesn't want to fight you

268
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:53,020
he just wanna accompany me.

269
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,660
Are you close?

270
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,520
Um.

271
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,160
He's my creditor, remember?

272
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,340
Yes.

273
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:07,440
I'm really sorry.

274
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:13,620
Um.

275
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,920
Forget it.

276
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,380
You're my friend.

277
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,280
F*ck.

278
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,660
I've never cried.

279
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,700
Haha.

280
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,240
Ah.

281
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,620
Argh.

282
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,340
Argh.

283
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:56,040
Argh.

284
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,180
Argh.

285
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:02,980
Chalarm?

286
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:07,300
Didn't we just eat?

287
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:09,300
Hm.

288
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,420
I'm hungry.

289
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:12,420
I'm at my limit.

290
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,560
Are you that hungry?

291
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,580
Can we go first and have Dino follow us?

292
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,520
My parasite is roaring.

293
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:21,780
You hear that?

294
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,020
What?

295
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:31,120
Buzz-buzz.

296
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,000
Chalarm...

297
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,120
Rak?

298
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:35,700
Have you waited long?

299
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:38,940
Eh?

300
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:41,180
What's wrong with him? // Buzz.

301
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:42,960
Buzz.

302
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:44,580
Oh, he can stop?

303
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,400
He's also your buddy!

304
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:50,900
Why are you so late?

305
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:52,900
Where are your friends?

306
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,540
At the canteen.

307
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,120
I was just done consulting with professor.

308
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:57,800
Buzz.

309
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:58,640
Hey.

310
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:00,080
Buzz. // Hey!

311
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:04,180
Let's have lunch.

312
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:08,320
Yeah, let's go. // Get up.

313
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:09,840
Let's eat...

314
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:12,680
omelette.

315
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,780
Fine.

316
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,120
As you wish.

317
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:18,700
Come on.

318
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,700
Buzz.

319
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,440
Let's get going.

320
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:26,640
Buzz.

321
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,120
Hold on!

322
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:28,740
Chalarm?

323
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:31,120
Help me.

324
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:32,560
Ha.

325
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,220
Alright, omelette.

326
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,540
Buzz.

327
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:39,920
Jay drank a few drinks before going to work, and he was late!

328
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,360
He's so doomed

329
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,800
to be caught red-handed.

330
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,980
What's he gonna do then? // I don't know if he was fired.

331
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:46,680
Damn.

332
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:49,600
Dino.

333
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:50,120
Huh?

334
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:53,780
Have your lil buddy been starving?

335
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,020
I think so.

336
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:01,060
It's obvious. He ate up 4 f*cking dishes.

337
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:02,920
Holy crab.

338
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,960
What's your stomach made of?

339
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:09,900
Eh?

340
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:11,580
Why don't you eat?

341
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:13,080
Er...

342
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:14,540
It's not tasty.

343
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:16,320
Hm.

344
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:19,160
Take mine. It's great.

345
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,780
Thank you.

346
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:28,980
Um.

347
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,800
Are you full yet?

348
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:33,600
Yes, I am.

349
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:36,700
How about you, Chalarm?

350
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,340
Are you full?

351
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:39,360
Yeah.

352
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:41,160
But it tastes bad.

353
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,760
Yours is better.

354
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,840
Then I'll cook for you tomorrow.

355
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:48,900
Um.

356
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,680
You can't cook omelette?!

357
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,100
No.

358
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,000
Then practice!

359
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,660
I tried, but it's not tasty.

360
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:58,860
It has to be.

361
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,100
Rak's is better.

362
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:01,780
Look at him!

363
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:06,280
It's just an omelette, eat it!

364
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,840
Rak's is better.

365
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:09,800
Is it?

366
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:12,540
Eat it!

367
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:15,540
Dino.

368
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,220
People are watching.

369
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,980
It just an omelette.

370
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,980
Why did you have to scold him?

371
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:24,980
I didn't.

372
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:28,460
Yeah, why was you being loud?

373
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:30,980
If you don't want to share Rak's omelette,

374
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:32,520
just tell him.

375
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,580
Why did you pretend?

376
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,000
Yeah.

377
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:37,300
Shut up, both of you.

378
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,620
I'll go to the toilet.

379
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,120
Because of you, Chalarm.

380
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:52,320
And your omelette.

381
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:57,980
Can I order more?

382
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:07,240
Dino!

383
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:10,980
Dino.

384
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:12,080
What's up?

385
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,320
Are you mad?

386
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,320
Well...

387
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:18,080
Um.

388
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:18,960
Hmm?

389
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,700
You talked so loud and people were watching us.

390
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,160
I'm sorry.

391
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:27,000
Well.

392
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,100
Don't be mad.

393
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,040
Dino!

394
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:32,760
Don't be mad.

395
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:34,400
Still mad?

396
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:37,620
I'm not mad.

397
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:43,000
It's weekend, don't forget to prepare to go to my place.

398
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,060
I already forget it.

399
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:47,540
You can't use this excuse.

400
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:49,380
I've prepared everything for you.

401
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:52,840
Dino.

402
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:54,520
I need to go.

403
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,480
My friend is waiting.

404
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,560
What the hell are you looking?

405
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,260
Do you wanna fight?

406
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:25,280
Damn you, asking for a fight right after we meet?

407
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:28,500
You don't love your bro anymore, do you?

408
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:32,760
I feel slighted.

409
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:35,560
Slighted, huh?

410
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,440
What are you talking about?

411
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:39,380
Go talk to the wall, I'm annoyed.

412
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,340
I used to!

413
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:47,280
Well...it quite good.

414
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,320
Hey!

415
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:51,000
Don't try to distract me.

416
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:53,700
What did you guys do in there?

417
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,180
Oh no!

418
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,020
This is a college's toilet.

419
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:00,780
Don't be nosy.

420
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:04,720
Ok.

421
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,040
I knew it.

422
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,820
I see the light now.

423
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:18,960
Maybe I need to make more merit

424
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:23,680
so I won't see you guys again in my next life.

425
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:27,240
Ouch!

426
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:33,260
It's coming!

427
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:35,140
Move back!

428
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,700
I have to go.

429
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:44,700
Ok.

430
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:50,560
Tell me what time will you pick me up on Friday.

431
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:56,680
Whenever you're ready.

432
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,840
Don't act like this.

433
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,400
Don't scold me.

434
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,080
Rabbit.

435
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,320
I'll bite your finger.

436
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,700
Are you a dog? I thought you're a rabbit.

437
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:13,700
Will you go out?

438
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:14,440
Yes, I will.

439
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,140
After taking a shower, let's eat out.

440
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,200
I'll help.

441
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,340
You're so cute.

442
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,000
I can't resist.

443
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,380
Let's go to the room.

444
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:27,940
Are you a good boy?

445
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:29,940
I like to reward good boy.

446
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:00,480
You know what,

447
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,700
When we were in the toilet,

448
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:04,720
I almost lost my control.

449
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:10,040
I felt the same way.

450
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,580
Am I good?

451
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,420
You're the best.

452
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,380
What do you wanna eat?

453
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:12,460
A fried whale.

454
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:17,240
Are you bugging me?

455
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:22,980
Lately, you've bugged me a lot.

456
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,580
You always on your phone.

457
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:28,120
Do you have a sneaky link?

458
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,480
We had sex last night,

459
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,940
how do I have time for others?

460
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,780
What do you wanna eat?

461
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:39,620
Not fried rice.

462
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:41,320
I know.

463
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:43,380
Congee?

464
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,000
Nah, I'd prefer soybean milk.

465
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,820
What about pill?

466
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,560
Are you feeling uncomfortable?

467
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:53,520
No.

468
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:56,640
You made my body hurt.

469
00:30:58,420 --> 00:30:59,200
Me?

470
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:02,860
Yeah, you did it rough, don't you know?

471
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,700
Think twice.

472
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:08,240
What did you say to me last night?

473
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:16,400
Go bring some food.

474
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:19,580
I'll go take a shower.

475
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,100
Are you being possessive?

476
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,380
Yes.

477
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,220
I'm being possessive.

478
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:40,880
Why?

479
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,520
Because you are you.

480
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:46,260
I'm being possessive too.

481
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:48,440
If somebody likes you,

482
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:50,820
you have to stay away from them.

483
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,160
Um.

484
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,660
I don't want to be toxic.

485
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:00,480
If you have to work with Please,

486
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,680
I get that.

487
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,360
I trust you.

488
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:11,080
You're not going to hurt me, right?

489
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:15,720
Can I answer by action?

490
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:18,580
My good boy.

491
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:28,780
Ouch!

492
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:34,100
Don't bite me.

493
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,880
I wanna bite you.

494
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:42,920
Dino.

495
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:45,920
I'm afraid you'll get bored.

496
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,440
Never.

497
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,440
Do you like it?

498
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:57,540
You're the best.

499
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:10,600
You know what,

500
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,760
I've always wanted to take shower with you.

501
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,200
Me too.

502
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:21,900
Dino.

503
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,280
What are you doing?

504
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:24,820
Tease you.

505
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:26,020
Tease me?

506
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,120
Dino.

507
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:39,320
Do you think we should have a cute nickname, like baby?

508
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:41,940
Up to you.

509
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,680
What do you think?

510
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:52,880
Or you can tell me what nickname you want me to call you.

511
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:55,120
Daddy?

512
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:58,760
No.

513
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:00,560
It sounds too erotic.

514
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:05,840
Then...babe?

515
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:07,120
It's cute.

516
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:12,380
Ok.

517
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:15,639
I'll call you babe.

518
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:18,800
And you have to call me babe too, ok?

519
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,600
Ok.

520
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:21,219
Let's try.

521
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,500
Babe.

522
00:34:26,139 --> 00:34:27,600
Are you happy now?

523
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:29,500
Hmm?

524
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:32,540
You're cute.

525
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:35,040
Yeah, you too.

526
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,400
I'll give you a bubble.

527
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,980
I'll do it too.

528
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:41,980
Dino.

529
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:47,120
Do you want to watch a movie, don't you?

530
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:54,659
Are you free?

531
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:55,980
Yes.

532
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:57,980
I'll go too.

533
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:03,140
Actually, I have two films in my mind.

534
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:06,140
I don't know which one.

535
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:07,480
I can't decide.

536
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:09,980
It's up to you.

537
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,620
But...

538
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:14,320
No but.

539
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:16,320
I'm always spoil you.

540
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:20,060
Then...

541
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:23,860
I have decided.

542
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:27,540
I'm afraid you won't like it.

543
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:28,860
I can watch anything.

544
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,060
Remember you word.

545
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:33,940
Yes.

546
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,200
Um.

547
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:40,020
Let's hurry up.

548
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:43,220
Do you want a back rub?

549
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:44,920
Well, yes.

550
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:46,360
Do it softly.

551
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:48,820
The film was fun.

552
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:50,640
Yes, it was.

553
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:51,980
I saw you slept.

554
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:53,280
Hey, Rak.

555
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:54,520
Huh?

556
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:57,180
Wait here.

557
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:58,500
I'll go to the toilet.

558
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,140
Rak!

559
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:09,280
Long time no see.

560
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:15,440
Have you received my flower?

561
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,120
You're Rak room 811, right?

562
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:20,840
Someone sent you the flower.

563
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:22,080
For me?

564
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,400
Yes.

565
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:25,620
Is there a sender's name on the card?

566
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,260
No.

567
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:31,420
A delivery man brought it here.

568
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:34,940
Thank you.

569
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:39,500
Do you still remember our childhood memory?

570
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:45,360
Hey newbie, bring me money!

571
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:47,140
I don't have any.

572
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:50,340
Bring it to me!

573
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:51,780
I don't have any!

574
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,940
Don't be afraid.

575
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:00,180
I'll stay here with you.

576
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:04,680
My name is Rak.

577
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:08,420
What about you?

578
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:16,140
My name is

579
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:19,460
See-Kram.

580
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,440
Ah, See-Kram.

581
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:30,680
Everything I've done,

582
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:37,540
it's because I love you.

583
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:43,440
I'm sorry that I hurt you.

584
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:47,900
I'm sorry that I think I can't live without you.

585
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:50,900
Can you forgive me?

586
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:56,740
You don't have to be my friend,

587
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:02,640
just forgive me.

588
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:06,800
Even if we make up,

589
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:09,820
you know

590
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,160
I can't feel the same way with you.

591
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,560
Everything that happened,

592
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:25,860
it made me sad.

593
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,940
You just came to ask for my forgiveness,

594
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:40,680
What if you hurt yourself again?

595
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:53,200
what if you do something I don't think you will again?

596
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:56,740
I can forgive you.

597
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:02,840
Rak.

598
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:06,400
Kram.

599
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:15,320
I can forgive you,

600
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:23,740
but you know that our friendship

601
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:26,340
is all gone.

602
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:29,700
There's nothing left.

603
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:30,960
Do you get it?

604
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:39,040
I can't have a friend like you anymore.

605
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:41,420
Rak.

606
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,280
There's no point, Kram.

607
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:48,280
You may go.

608
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:09,940
Let's go, Rak.

609
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,640
My friends are already at my place.

610
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,380
They'll have Shabu today.

611
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,040
Let's go before they destroy my room.

612
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,280
So bored.

613
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:42,700
Everyone is in a relationship.

614
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:49,320
When will I find Kaijeaw's friend?

615
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:06,820
Excuse me.

616
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:09,580
Can I sit with you?

617
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:16,560

00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:02,620
[I'm counting the days until I can be yours]

625
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:04,440

626

627
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:11,800

628

It's smell good.

629
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:22,800
Um.

630
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:26,220
Let's do the interview.

631
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:28,920
What do I like about him?

632
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:31,760
I think

633
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:34,720
I like everything about him.

634
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:38,160
Since I met him, you guys know it.

635
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,360
I still look at him the same way.

636
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:45,660
Yeah, now let's ask Rak.

637
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,940
I think I like him because

638
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:54,240
he pays attention and takes good care of me

639
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:56,760
since the beginning.

640
00:42:57,220 --> 00:42:58,760
He's never changed.

641
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:03,620
Is there still anyone interfere between you?

642
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:07,560
Since that boy

643
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,320
no one.

644
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:14,960
For Dino, his close friend has a crush on him.

645
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:19,500
I trust him because he said it's nothing between them.

646
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:21,100
Are you jealous?

647
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:23,700
Well...yes.

648
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,460
I'm jealous of myself

649
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:31,520
for having you as my boyfriend.

650
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:34,300
What are you saying?

651
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,140
Do you remember the him?

652
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:42,580
The boy who likes to followed you around.

653
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:44,720
Yes, I do.

654
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:48,080
What a coincidence!

655
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:50,060
Do you want me to wait here with you?

656
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:50,860
Let me go!

657
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:51,960
Calm down!

658
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:53,100
Damn you!

659
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:54,500
Dino!

660
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:55,560
Dino
