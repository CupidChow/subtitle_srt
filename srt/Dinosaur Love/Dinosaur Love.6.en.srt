00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:50,820
I heard that his phone is dead.

38
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:52,380
Are you with him?

39
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,560
No.

40
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,460
I haven't seen him.

41
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:57,100
Oh.

42
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,860
Did you know that Dino got hit?

43
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:28,600
Huh?

44
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:35,700
Rak.

45
00:03:37,579 --> 00:03:38,880
Are you alright?

46
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,620
Don't tell me that he hasn't told you yet.

47
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,620
I know it from you just now.

48
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,460
Is he alright?

49
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:48,280
Yes.

50
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,200
He just got hit at the arm.

51
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,140
Do you want to visit him?

52
00:03:53,579 --> 00:03:54,540
I can pick you up.

53
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,180
He might have a reason for not telling you.

54
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:00,180
If you want to know anything, I recommend you to ask.

55
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:01,560
Don't imagine things.

56
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,740
Now I'm parking my car and about to go to my bar.

57
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:07,160
Less than 10 minutes from here to college.

58
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,680
If you want to visit him, just wait at your place.

59
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,680
I'll take care of your absent.

60
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,700
Dino might afraid you'll worry about him so he didn't tell you.

61
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,600
Normally, he doesn't tell anyone when he got hurt.

62
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:24,840
What about the person who shoot him?

63
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,500
He was arrested already.

64
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:28,920
Do you feel better?

65
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,940
Trust me, Dino is thinking about how to tell you.

66
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,740
He doesn't like making his significant ones worry.

67
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:39,480
He doesn't even tell his mom when he got hurt.

68
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,180
And doesn't tell me also.

69
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,460
I just know when he's already recover.

70
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,300
I'll bring some food for him.

71
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:48,760
Ok.

72
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,120
I'll pick you up.

73
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,700
Thank you.

74
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:53,580
Rak?

75
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:56,460
How did you get here?

76
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:58,460
Mhee took me here.

77
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,700
Where's Mhee?

78
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:06,420
He's just left.

79
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:11,600
Actually, he wanted to visit you too.

80
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,580
But he has urgent call from his bar so he had to leave.

81
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,240
By the way, how are you?

82
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,760
Come in.

83
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,060
Have you taken medicine yet?

84
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:42,120
No, I haven't

85
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,540
Are you alright?

86
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:01,940
Um.

87
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:08,740
Don't cry.

88
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,100
Rak.

89
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,880
Don't cry.

90
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,200
Seeing you cry makes me hurt more than getting hit.

91
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,840
Then why are you holding me?

92
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:38,840
Because you're crying.

93
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:52,140
Do you still hurt?

94
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:56,600
Just a little.

95
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,020
I'm fine.

96
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,760
What did you bring here?

97
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,920
Food and Ichitan drink.

98
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:15,260
So fresh.

99
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:21,620
What a fresh drink!

100
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:26,380
It's the best.

101
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,080
What are you doing?

102
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,640
You acted like a child.

103
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,280
At least it makes you smile.

104
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,720
I'm afraid someone might think that I'm weak.

105
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,039
I know.

106
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,140
Do you want to eat now?

107
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:46,800
You're right-handed, right?

108
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:48,140
Um.

109
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:49,480
Actually, I can eat by myself.

110
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,760
But if you feed me, it would be more yummy.

111
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,480
Dino.

112
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,980
Then let's eat.

113
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:02,160
So you can take you medicine right away.

114
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,140
Um.

115
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:07,160
But I won't let you come home tonight.

116
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,580
I haven't said I'll leave.

117
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,140
Can I stay with you tonight?

118
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,280
You have to sleep in the same bed with me.

119
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,200
Um.

120
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,840
You're so obedient.

121
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,460
I just want to make sure

122
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,080
that you're going to be ok.

123
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,300
You can be sure.

124
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,840
Don't rush.

125
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,460
Seems like you're thirsty.

126
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,740
You drink like a child.

127
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:55,760
Have you had dinner?

128
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,300
No, I haven't.

129
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,260
Why don't you eat?

130
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,400
Don't you know it's dinner time?

131
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,940
You can't scold me for that.

132
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:09,560
Why?

133
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,600
You haven't had dinner as well.

134
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,420
My arm hurts, I can't go out to eat.

135
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,580
Your arm hurts not your legs.

136
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,700
I have a headache too.

137
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,140
I might have fever.

138
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,660
See?

139
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:29,340
You're hot.

140
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,000
Do you still have a headache?

141
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:34,000
No.

142
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,160
This is just a prank.

143
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:37,740
But my arm actually hurts.

144
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,380
Where's your medicine?

145
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,420
I'll go grab it.

146
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:43,860
In my bedroom.

147
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:58,580
Dino.

148
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,080
You have such a kissable lips.

149
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:05,300
[The second I saw you]

150
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:12,420
[You stole my heart]

151
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:16,780
[The second we meet]

152
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:20,700
[is always special]

153
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,180
Ahem! Dino.

154
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:23,840
It hurts.

155
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,320
Why don't you hit another arm?

156
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,100
Is this yours or a bear slap?

157
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,920
Don't do this.

158
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,540
I hurt you.

159
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,900
It's just a prank.

160
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:44,560
I'm afraid I might hit you again.

161
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:46,920
Do you worry about me?

162
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:48,920
Um.

163
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,880
I'm worried about you so much.

164
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:55,940
Um.

165
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,480
I'll go grab your medicine.

166
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:25,260
Why are you making a stressful face?

167
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,100
No, I'm not.

168
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:31,960
Your face looks like this.

169
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,360
Is this a stressful face?

170
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:42,540
Does it inflame?

171
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Does it still hurt?

172
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,000
Why are you staring at me?

173
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,000
It's not your business.

174
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:03,900
Rak.

175
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,340
It's not your business.

176
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:11,540
Stop it.

177
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:14,960
I don't know.

178
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,960
I don't want to talk to you.

179
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,980
But I want to.

180
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,560
Get off of me.

181
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,480
What?

182
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:28,900
Get off of me.

183
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,120
Ah, get off of you.

184
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,000
I won't.

185
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,040
Dino.

186
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:39,000
Yeah, that's my name.

187
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,480
You're so cute.

188
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,600
You're going to make my hair messy.

189
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:49,240
Why?

190
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,360
I like it like that.

191
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:52,160
What's the problem?

192
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,960
You said you'll go out tomorrow, right?

193
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,960
Um, I'll buy a new phone.

194
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,240
Do you want to watch a movie?

195
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,020
Nah.

196
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,620
I'll go back to do my laundry.

197
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,220
See?

198
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,000
It smells bad.

199
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,460
Because I haven't washed it for a couple days.

200
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,080
Let me try.

201
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,020
It smells nice.

202
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,220
You mean my shirt, right?

203
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:29,980
Your cheeks.

204
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,180
Dino.

205
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,140
I'll hit you.

206
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,080
If you hit me, I'll kiss you.

207
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:42,840
You can hit me hard,

208
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,820
because you're in adverse condition.

209
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,700
I won't hit you anymore.

210
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,340
You have to come with me tomorrow.

211
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,640
Why don't you go alone?

212
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,640
I said you have to come with me.

213
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,460
My arm still hurts.

214
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:06,940
Will you go or not?

215
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:09,720
1..

216
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:13,100
2..

217
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:15,100
3

218
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:15,680
Answer me.

219
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,540
I'll go with you.

220
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:19,540
I'll go with you, alright?

221
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:20,840
Are you happy now?

222
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,080
You're so obedient.

223
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,180
I'm happy now.

224
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,260
Whatever.

225
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:34,800
Why are you smiling?

226
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,840
I'll go with you.

227
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,840
I know.

228
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,340
You want me to go with you, don't you?

229
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:45,100
Let's continue watching movies.

230
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:56,820
Do you want anything?

231
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:00,360
Err...I've been wanting this for so long.

232
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,800
I don't know if it's good or not.

233
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:02,720
I'll buy it for you.

234
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:04,200
Anything else?

235
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,880
But it quite expensive.

236
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:08,360
Then it's for me.

237
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,600
What about this?

238
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:16,420
This one is also good but expensive.

239
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:17,200
I'll buy this one for you.

240
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:18,980
Are you hanging out here?

241
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:26,940
Yeah, what's the problem?

242
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,120
Nothing..

243
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,480
for now.

244
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,180
Maybe in the future might be.

245
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,720
Who's behind you? Looks so familiar.

246
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,380
Looks like a freshman.

247
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,240
Answer me.

248
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:43,600
Who?

249
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,320
Are you two close?

250
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:50,520
Can't answer?

251
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,380
Get yourself ready to be in the cheer room this evening.

252
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,600
I'll set a meeting for juniors

253
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,060
including you.

254
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,260
Dino, Rak, how long have you been waiting?

255
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:09,160
Hello.

256
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:12,319
Did you come with them?

257
00:17:12,619 --> 00:17:16,780
Yes, I asked them to be here but we're about to leave.

258
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,619
What are you doing here?

259
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:21,859
Actually, it's our businesses.

260
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:24,560
But it's not a secret if you want to know.

261
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,000
We're discussing about the Faculty's star.

262
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:28,680
Faculty's star? This boy?

263
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,860
Are you kidding me?

264
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,420
I didn't said that.

265
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,420
Rak and Chalarm are friends.

266
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:42,360
We wanted Chalarm to participate but he denied.

267
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,800
So, I just want Rak to recommend others.

268
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:49,240
You know we have to do the Faculty's star contest after cheering end, right?

269
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:50,740
Yes, I know.

270
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:53,980
Yeah, that's it.

271
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:58,000
Don't think we don't know what you did.

272
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:04,340
I hope this boy doesn't get any privilege during cheering time.

273
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:09,940
There haven't been any problems yet.

274
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,080
And there won't be.

275
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:17,840
I heard that you gave our batch's gear to the one who's not participating in any activites.

276
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:19,220
She's a girl.

277
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:21,260
And also your girlfriend.

278
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,640
Isn't this called privilege?

279
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,960
Fine, see you at the college.

280
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:29,960
Let's go.

281
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,600
You come with me.

282
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,460
Dino, you go back alone

283
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:38,380
otherwise they'll catch it.

284
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,660
Thank you, Please.

285
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,800
Thank you.

286
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,200
We arrived.

287
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:55,580
Yes.

288
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:01,780
Coming with me makes you sign like that?

289
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,360
Not like that.

290
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:06,440
So,

291
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,140
Did you just hang out with Dino?

292
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,240
It's not hanging out.

293
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,440
He needed to buy a new phone.

294
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:15,840
Really?

295
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,200
His phone is dead.

296
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,320
I knew.

297
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:26,320
Why did you go there?

298
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:29,880
I just bought some snacks.

299
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,480
It has a shop there.

300
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:35,920
You seem to like it.

301
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,760
Yes, I like it.

302
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:42,640
Well...

303
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,460
How are things

304
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,220
between you two?

305
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,920
We take thing slow.

306
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:55,940
Umm.

307
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:56,880
Hey, Please.

308
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:58,000
Hmm?

309
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,420
Do you have a crush on Dino?

310
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,200
I need to go I have to attend the cheering practice.

311
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:13,860
Wait!

312
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,100
About...

313
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:20,920
me having a crush on Dino.

314
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,900
Am I that transparent?

315
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:32,020
You seem to dislike me since you saw me at Dino's room.

316
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:37,380
Dino has never brought anyone to his room.

317
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:40,680
He has never been in love.

318
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:42,680
And he has never had a crush on anyone.

319
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:53,480
I'm sorry for saying bad things to you on that night.

320
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,880
It's ok.

321
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,940
Anyway, I still want to warn you.

322
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:10,500
Because the seniors aren't happy that Dino is a SOTUS leader.

323
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,680
If he makes another mistake,

324
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:17,680
he might got ban from being a leader.

325
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:22,940
Did you know that he didn't want to be a leader

326
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:24,000
if it's not because of you.

327
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:29,520
Don't make his intention a waste.

328
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:35,700
Why?

329
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:39,960
You'd better ask him yourself.

330
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,180
Yes.

331
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:45,060
Um.

332
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,240
There's nothing between me and you then.

333
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:54,660
About me having a crush on him,

334
00:21:56,780 --> 00:22:00,020
I don't know whether he knows it or not.

335
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:03,200
Please don't tell him.

336
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,700
I still want to be friend with him.

337
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,380
And...

338
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:13,060
please take care of Dino.

339
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:17,500
I believe that he won't hurt you.

340
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,460
I'll take good care of him.

341
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:21,620
Um.

342
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,380
I think we're cleared.

343
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,540
I have to go.

344
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:29,540
Bye.

345
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:31,240
Bye, Please.

346
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:17,420
Hey!

347
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:20,500
Do you remember what we talked about yesterday?

348
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,480
You guys don't understand, right?

349
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:27,960
She said 'Do you remember what we talked about yesterday?'

350
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,660
Ahhh.

351
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:31,900
Keep listening, soon you'll get used to it.

352
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,080
I'll be the translator in the beginning.

353
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:35,300
What?

354
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,120
Big surprise.

355
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:40,340
Today we have a big surprise.

356
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:44,300
We're not going to do the ragging.

357
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,100
Be quiet, please.

358
00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:01,240
No, you have to be more aggressive.

359
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,780
Be quiet!

360
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:07,340
Can you make a frown face?

361
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,880
Guys, be quiet.

362
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,880
Like this?

363
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,880
I did a frown face already.

364
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,460
Argh! You!...

365
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,260
What happened to your face? Why is it so stiff?

366
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:18,940
I had botox injections because you said I'll look nicer!

367
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:19,980
Freshmen! Silence!

368
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,540
Remember what I told you?

369
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,320
If you interrupt

370
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:29,340
and don't stay quiet,

371
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:31,640
how could you hear what the seniors are saying?

372
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,220
If you have no manners like this

373
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:39,640
we won't allow you to do activities

374
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:41,640
but we'll go back to our ragging session, shall we?

375
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,680
Pay attention when we asked you to listen.

376
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,600
You may continue.

377
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:57,580
Er... as we said earlier,

378
00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:00,520
today we're not gonna be ragging you or ask you to sing any songs.

379
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,540
Instead, we prepared a fun activity for you!

380
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:07,060
It's called Brotherhood bonding activity!

381
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:09,180
Yayyy!

382
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:12,380
You know? This Brotherhood bonding activity...

383
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:14,220
we spent 3 days trying to come up with a name.

384
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:17,640
What do you think?

385
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:21,380
The name suggests that the goal is to strengthen bonds.

386
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:23,380
However...

387
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:26,840
freshmen and sophomores are already quite close.

388
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,500
No worries, though.

389
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,480
Sophomores won't participate.

390
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:35,800
We'll give juniors a chance to get close to you.

391
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:41,180
Each SOTUS leader will team up with a freshman.

392
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,500
But don't get your hopes up too early

393
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,640
thinking you'll be paired with a charming senior

394
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:50,660
because men can only pair up with men

395
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:52,860
and women with women.

396
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:58,760
This is for safety purpose, so don't violate it, alright?

397
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,660
That's it, leaders can start selecting now!

398
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:07,180
Yay! // Hooray!

399
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:09,780
Ahem!

400
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:15,240
Please choose one freshman.

401
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,580
Who caught your interest?

402
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:18,760
I choose Rak.

403
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:23,140
Okay! Rak it is!

404
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:28,480
However, you don't have Rak in your team yet.

405
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:32,660
Because... // We have a special rule!

406
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:37,800
That is... juniors can choose the freshman that's already chosen.

407
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:41,000
They can do that? // Yes! // What a surprise!

408
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,520
And freshmen are free to choose who they wanna be with.

409
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,440
Ah, you have the right to choose.

410
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,880
This rule is so interesting.

411
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,780
Yeah!

412
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:54,180
So next is Dino's turn.

413
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:55,980
Who will you choose?

414
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:56,760
I choose Rak.

415
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:57,780
Huh?

416
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:02,520
Woah, Rak is so hot! He's number one!

417
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,900
Then please come out here, Rak.

418
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:10,000
Rak, choose who you want to be with.

419
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,940
It's all up to you.

420
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:18,600
Why did you choose me?

421
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,560
Because you'll choose me, am I right?

422
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,160
Babe?

423
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,400
Um.

424
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:36,120
Don't start gossiping just yet!

425
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,460
I know you wanna gossip about them and I do, too.

426
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,100
Rak.

427
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:44,680
Now you're standing between two handsome seniors.

428
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:52,000
We're giving you the chance to choose who you wanna team up with.

429
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:55,900
You'll give me the answer on the count of three.

430
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:57,900
Drum, please.

431
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:00,720
1

432
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:02,720
2

433
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:04,700
and 3!

434
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:06,460
I choose Dino.

435
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:10,340
[Thank you for coming into my life]

436
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,980
[and changing my world]

437
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:14,680
Don't be upset.

438
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:18,100
You're just not the right person.

439
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,680
Try again.

440
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:21,280
Choose whoever you want.

441
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,280
Alright? // Yes. // Wonderful!

442
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:26,120
Everyone, I have to take a quick trip to the restroom.

443
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:30,380
Rest up and look after yourself.

444
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:32,620
When we're back we'll continue playing the game:

445
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:34,980
Brotherhood bonding activity!

446
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:38,860
*Cheers*

447
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:48,140
Alright! I'm back!

448
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:53,340
Three pairs of freshmen and leaders are already here.

449
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:54,760
Let's give them a round of applause!

450
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:01,100
Are you ready to listen to the rules?

451
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:03,100
Yesss.

452
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:05,160
The name of this game is...

453
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,400
Longer, longer!

454
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:10,040
Woah. // Yeah!

455
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:14,440
You are confused why it has to be this name, aren't you?

456
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,440
There's a legend that I'll tell you later.

457
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,140
Let's listen to the rule first. // Ah.

458
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:22,860
The rule is... we'll give these 3 pairs...

459
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:27,060
clues to a certain place.

460
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:30,800
And everyone must work together to decipher the clues. // That's right.

461
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,900
Take last year as an example,

462
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,400
The clue is...

463
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:38,180
I have 4 eyes, 8 legs... // Woah.

464
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:40,680
2 tongues, 4 nostrils...

465
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,600
What the heck is that? // and I'm black.

466
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,140
That time, we were sitting like this.

467
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:44,800
Until dawn.

468
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:48,080
Yeah, we start thinking from 4 p.m. until dawn.

469
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,860
That's why this game is called "Longer, longer."

470
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:51,380
And guess what...

471
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:55,520
the answer is a couple of black dogs in front of the uni!

472
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:58,020
I was absolutely clueless at the time.

473
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:01,760
But don't worry, this year's riddles aren't that hard.

474
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,600
If you're ready, should we distribute the riddles?

475
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:09,520
Here you go. // Okay. // I'm excited to see what you get.

476
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,680
Hey, don't peek!

477
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:12,460
Here.

478
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,580
Okay, choose one each.

479
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:27,960
Okay, so all of them already got the clues.

480
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,480
The staff will give you a sign...

481
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:35,600
This sister will count to three

482
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:40,620
then you'll set out and find the clues as quickly as possible.

483
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:41,700
Let's start counting!

484
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,800
1!

485
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,020
Say it clearly.

486
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,320
1!!

487
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:48,100
2!

488
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:49,980
3!

489
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:52,720
Go go! // Yay!

490
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:56,900
That's all I've got, why don't you count it yourself?

491
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:55,000
A tree is eating me. I can be opened and closed.

492
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:06,650
How about that tree? // Let's check it out.

493
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:10,560
Here?

494
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,520
Are you sure?

495
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:13,600
This one?

496
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:21,660
In the sky? Is it the moon? // Huh?

497
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:27,460
Dino, it's getting dark. // Is that it?

498
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:30,280
This one?

499
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,380
Rak, what's the last riddle?

500
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:37,770
It says... I'm in the sky beside the moon.

501
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:40,880
In the sky and beside the moon?

502
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:50,020
Dino.

503
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:50,670
Hm?

504
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:54,650
The stars are so beautiful tonight.

505
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,020
Indeed.

506
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:08,680
That side is even more beautiful.

507
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:10,800
Huh?

508
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:16,170
Oh, you're right!

509
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:19,220
It might be over there! Let's go! // Hey!

510
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:26,100
Dino, where is it?

511
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,220
They all look the same.

512
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:34,170
Dino, I found it.

513
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:36,600
Dino.

514
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:39,080
Can you give me a piggyback ride?

515
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:40,900
Should I climb up there?

516
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,800
Never mind. You'll get hurt if you fall.

517
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:47,350
Come on.

518
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,470
Yeah! We got it!

519
00:34:08,170 --> 00:34:09,070
Ouch!

520
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,870
Rak, are you alright?

521
00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:16,070
Are you hurt anywhere?

522
00:34:16,219 --> 00:34:17,600
I'm fine.

523
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:20,449
How about the star? Where is it?

524
00:34:20,449 --> 00:34:22,199
You should worry about yourself first.

525
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:27,920
Nursing unit! Over here!

526
00:34:28,469 --> 00:34:29,469
Dino.

527
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,150
I'm not injured

528
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:34,080
and not that hurt.

529
00:34:39,699 --> 00:34:41,620
It's just an accident.

530
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:43,370
What I want to say is...

531
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:45,699
I don't want this to happen.

532
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:49,500
But it happened, and I'm not seriously hurt.

533
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:53,170
Dino.

534
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:55,469
Please don't blame anyone for this.

535
00:34:58,070 --> 00:34:59,120
Try to imagine.

536
00:34:59,970 --> 00:35:01,350
If it's not you and me...

537
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:04,100
if someone else fall, what will happen?

538
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,240
It's my job to take care of all the freshmen

539
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,550
not just you.

540
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:13,520
I get it, Dino.

541
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:17,320
But this only happened to me.

542
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:20,850
Please don't scold the staff.

543
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:26,500
I'm still the same rabbit you know.

544
00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:34,120
You're as cute as always, rabbit.

545
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,040
Here's the star.

546
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,960
I'm... leaving first.

547
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:55,050
How about the paper star jar?

548
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:58,640
Er...

549
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,320
I'll add some more

550
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:07,720
because you made me feel really good today.

551
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:12,800
I'm waiting for it to be full.

552
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:15,320
Hmm, Dino!

553
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,170
Don't do this.

554
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,970
I'm off!

555
00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:20,900
[You're talented at making a man think about you]

556
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:25,270
[and yearn for you every day]

557
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:35,550
Hey, Rak.

558
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:37,480
Let me tie a thread for you.

559
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:39,800
Don't mess with my man.

560
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:40,970
Hey!

561
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:42,270
Mind your own business.

562
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:43,770
Sorry.

563
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:45,740
Can you switch places with him?

564
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,120
Dino.

565
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:02,020
You didn't have to say it like that.

566
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:04,550
Can't you talk nicely?

567
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:06,400
You have no idea...

568
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,500
how long I've been waiting for you today.

569
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,480
Be a good boy

570
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:17,880
for your dad and me.

571
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:21,800
You know?

572
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:25,160
Constant dripping wears away the stone.

573
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:29,360
What if the stone... is taken?

574
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:31,720
There's zero chance for everyone else.

575
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,100
Should I bang you right now?

576
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:39,700
Why not?

577
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:46,680
I'll take you to Chiang Mai after this.

578
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:50,500
Your only answer is yes.

579
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:54,300
Hm.

580
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:56,620
I'm going.

581
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:04,380
[Is love at first sight real?]

582
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:08,760
[Just saw you passing by without saying a word]

583
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:09,960
Don't let anybody else tie it.

584
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,220
There's no one else, except you.

585
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:18,460
[Why did I fall for you?]

586
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,360
Chalarm.

587
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:39,500
Chalarm.

588
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:44,740
Chalarm!

589
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:52,240
The professor is coming.

590
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,100
Wake up.

591
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:01,140
Huh?

592
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:04,120
The professor is coming.

593
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:12,180
Where are you going today?

594
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,300
What do you mean?

595
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:17,200
The orientation's already ended.

596
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,620
So are you going to work?

597
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:20,220
Um.

598
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,460
Mhee's bar is closed today.

599
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:24,100
So there's no work.

600
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:25,820
And you?

601
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:27,180
Are you going home?

602
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,160
Yes, I am.

603
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,480
Um.

604
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,060
When will you be back?

605
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:33,940
On Monday.

606
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,280
Chalarm.

607
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:39,120
When you're back,

608
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,540
bring some pies for me.

609
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:42,920
Mhm.

610
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:46,580
Chalarm.

611
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,920
I heard buddy lines are giving out snacks.

612
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:52,100
Really?

613
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:53,500
Have you heard about it?

614
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,180
No.

615
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:56,860
And I don't want to.

616
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:01,320
But there could be many kinds of snacks.

617
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:03,680
Both savory and sweet.

618
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,180
And also ice creams.

619
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:09,780
Chalarm.

620
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,560
Are there any things you like...

621
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:14,720
aside from Omelette?

622
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,520
I only like Omelette.

623
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,960
Just. Omelette.

624
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:21,640
Oh.

625
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:23,320
Chalarm!

626
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:24,640
Argh.

627
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:27,140
No more sleep.

628
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:30,140
Ask whatever you want.

629
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:36,940
Hello.

630
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:40,280
I had no idea you'd be my buddy.

631
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:41,940
Hm.

632
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:43,700
Me neither.

633
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:47,060
Look. Dino is giving me the side eye.

634
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,380
Rak~

635
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:54,320
Here's snacks for you.

636
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,400
Ah, thank you.

637
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:58,040
Well.

638
00:41:58,380 --> 00:41:59,720
You're really adorable.

639
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:02,280
No doubt one SOTUS leader never leave your side.

640
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:05,620
Haha.

641
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:08,560
Enjoy eating.

642
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:09,860
Thank you.

643
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:13,620
Speak of the devil.

644
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:16,120
Yo. Come here.

645
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,860
Stay out of trouble.

646
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:22,020
I gotta go. Enjoy!

647
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:26,200
Hey.

648
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:27,880
Have you finish packing?

649
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:30,320
Yes.

650
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:32,180
Don't forget to bring a sweater.

651
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:33,500
Or should I bring it for you?

652
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:35,320
I have it ready.

653
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:38,620
How about pants, socks, and gloves?

654
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:40,620
I've already packed them all.

655
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:45,520
I'm reminding you, not letting you talk back, understand?

656
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:46,580
Dino!

657
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:48,760
Hmph, my cheeks hurt.

658
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:50,560
What? // It's swollen.

659
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:52,560
Again? // No! Enough.

660
00:42:57,380 --> 00:42:58,280
Wait here.

661
00:42:58,700 --> 00:42:59,460
I'll be right back.

662
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:01,600
Yes.

663
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:07,980
Eh.

664
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:09,640
Is this for real?

665
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:12,920
Are you really my buddy?

666
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:13,720
Hm.

667
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:15,200
Chalarm.

668
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:16,560
Is it real?

669
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:18,180
Not sure.

670
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:19,060
Ha?

671
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:23,240
Say it again. Are you really my buddy?

672
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:24,220
May be?

673
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:26,440
Is that so?

674
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:27,920
Argh.

675
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:29,880
You are my buddy?

676
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,300
My head hurts enough with Suea alone.

677
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:35,860
What the f*ck are you saying??

678
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:36,700
Hey!

679
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:38,600
If it's not because of me,

680
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:40,240
there will be no Rak.

681
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:41,760
Remember that!

682
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:43,160
Do you want a beating?

683
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:44,240
Oh, sure!

684
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:45,420
How ungrateful.

685
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:47,700
Ah, stop it, guys.

686
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:49,240
Er...

687
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:50,160
You're

688
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:51,520
Chalarm?

689
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:52,280
Yes.

690
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:54,280
I'm Mhee, a senior.

691
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:56,960
And these are Dino and Suea.

692
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:58,300
Guess you know them.

693
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:02,520
So should we have a meal together?

694
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:05,120
How about pork buffet? // Your treat.

695
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:07,080
Suea.

696
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:09,080
I invited you guys.

697
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:10,540
Of course it's on me.

698
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:12,200
Why are you this stupid?

699
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:13,000
Bro.

700
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:16,640
It's just confusion,

701
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:18,220
not stupidity.

702
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:19,380
No.

703
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:21,000
You're stupid.

704
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:22,500
Hey!

705
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:24,940
Are you asking for trouble?

706
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:28,840
Why can't you be grateful?! // You started this.

707
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:30,140
i don't eat pork buffet.

708
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:34,420
I don't like pork.

709
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:38,720
Wait, are you serious?

710
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:40,760
You don't?

711
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:42,100
I don't.

712
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:44,460
Er... so...

713
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:46,860
what do you like to eat?

714
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:48,800
Shabu?

715
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:50,540
Seafood buffet?

716
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Omakase?

717
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:53,480
Or Fine dining?

718
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:54,660
What's your favorite?

719
00:44:55,540 --> 00:44:57,420
Choose what you want. Mhee will take care of the bill.

720
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:58,820
Omelette with rice.

721
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:05,880
Huh?

722
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:09,700
I want to eat omelette.

723
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:13,920
Ah, alright.

724
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:15,640
Omelette.

725
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:18,760
That's settled?

726
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:20,680
Okay.

727
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:22,560
The end.

728
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:24,660
I got a headache.

729
00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:29,140
Chalarm.

730
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:31,780
You damn bastard!

731
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:32,840
Hmph.

732
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:33,860
From...

733
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:37,320
Pork buffet, Shabu,

734
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:41,600
Seafood buffet, Omakase and Fine dining...

735
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:44,800
to just an omelette?

736
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:49,080
Objection! You're not my buddy!

737
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:50,620
Ha, I'm heartbroken.

738
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:53,860
Don't mind him. I'll buy you a drink.

739
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:02,740
Chalarm, my dear brother.

740
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,260
Let's eat omelette together.

741
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:05,960
Lemme give you a kiss.

742
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:08,940
Let's eat omelette.

743
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:09,700
Go!

00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:57,200
[When will you be my lover?]

751
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,900
[I'm counting the days until I can be yours]

752
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:02,040
[I smile every time we meet]

753
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:05,180
[And you feel the same way]

754
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:07,040
That's right.

755
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:09,360
I'm very possessive of the one I love.

756
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:12,400
When someone gets close to my lover,

757
00:47:12,620 --> 00:47:15,580
I'll be just as you saw.

758
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:18,900
And I'm quite unlucky...

759
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:22,820
for being shot. But it's not serious.

760
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:25,180
I planned to keep it a secret from Rak.

761
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:27,480
But Mhee told him.

762
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:31,340
It let me know that Rak worried about me, though.

763
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:34,440
We got to be so close...

764
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,440
that I can't suppress my feelings.

765
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:40,160
Rak's cheeks really smell nice.

766
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:41,960
His neck too.

767
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:43,580
And

768
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:45,000
We've come this far,

769
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:48,740
so you might know that I wanna promote Ichitan.

770
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:50,460
Buy it. It tastes really good.

771
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:02,340
(Tha Phae Gate)

772
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:10,220
Chalarm.

773
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:12,680
Your hair color...

774
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:14,920
Dino!

775
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:18,160
Your hair color!

776
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:19,600
And you?

777
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:20,980
Are you ready to bemine?

778
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:23,800
[When will you be my lover?]

779
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:25,200
I...
