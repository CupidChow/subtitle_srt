1
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:06,920
We really got married, huh.

2
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:08,140
Is this your honeymoon?

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:09,830
Naoki-san!

4
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:13,350
What is with her? Naoki-san! Naoki-san!

5
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,660
Sorry... very much.

6
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:19,370
Those people...somewhere...

7
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:21,860
Yeah! Yeah!

8
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:24,690
Say "cheese!"

9
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:28,090
Naoki-san!

10
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:30,280
Hurry, Naoki-san!

11
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:37,230
Why do they keep bothering us everyday?

12
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,170
It hurts!

13
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:41,970
Where does it hurt?

14
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:45,110
Don't touch her, Irie-kun!

15
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:47,050
Don't touch another girl!

16
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:49,540
Enough already!

17
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:53,220
You got married to a guy who is going to become a doctor.

18
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,870
I'm the worst.

19
00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:02,870
I thought I understood Irie-kun's ambition to become a doctor.

20
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,540
Naoki-san, you're cold-hearted.

21
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,130
Well, it can't be helped because you have Kotoko as your partner.

22
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:11,970
Or you don't really love her?

23
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:19,100
A girl like you, even if I met you a hundred times, I would ignore you every time.

24
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:21,690
I was really worried about you.

25
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:32,740
That was fun!

26
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:34,340
We should go again sometime, Irie-kun!

27
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:35,530
Is that so?

28
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:41,540
Next time, we'll be all alone and.....

29
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:44,080
Naoki-san!

30
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,710
Kanomori-san?

31
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:48,520
What is going on for you to pick us up?

32
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:51,490
I came to pick you up.

33
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:57,240
Did something happen at the company? In my father's absence?

34
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,240
Your father was away?

35
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,760
That's not for me to say.

36
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:06,410
Kanomori-san, where are we going?

37
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:08,480
We'll be there soon.

38
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,270
Please go inside.

39
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:37,220
What is this place?

40
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,400
Please.

41
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:06,040
Welcome back!

42
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,480
Here, Naoki. Come in, come in!

43
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,360
Please enter.

44
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,330
Kotoko-chan, too, please enter.

45
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:19,440
Kanomori-kun, thank you!

46
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:25,890
How was your honeymoon?

47
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:28,640
Hope you guys enjoyed the honeymoon, too.

48
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:32,790
What on earth could you be talking about?

49
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:36,180
Forget that, this house...?

50
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:42,450
From today on we are all living in this house together.

51
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:46,660
And when a baby is born,

52
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:49,700
we wouldn't have had enough place in the old house.

53
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:54,760
Thinking that, we went ahead and built this house!

54
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,970
We'll be staying with them again.

55
00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:00,190
You know, I also have a room!

56
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:04,310
In the first place, it's too early to talk about kids.

57
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:09,760
And also, what is that?

58
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:18,090
Even though it's embarrassing, it's wonderful!

59
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:20,030
Hey, isn't this place Okinawa?

60
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:21,830
How was this taken?

61
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:24,440
Have you still not figured it out?

62
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:30,050
They were there with us in Okinawa.

63
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,820
Tho-those blonde people.

64
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,160
The people wh-who hugged!

65
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,200
Take this picture off the wall.

66
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,230
My, my... Naoki!

67
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:53,980
I get your feelings but isn't it a nice picture?

68
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:56,250
Right! You're a good photographer Mrs. Irie.

69
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,200
Well.

70
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,670
She took enough photos on this trip.

71
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:04,700
Take it down. What will guests think if they see it?

72
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:10,140
Well, of course, they'll think it's a happy family!

73
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,630
This is the living room!

74
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:25,160
-What do you think?
- So high!

75
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,280
Hey, Kotoko-chan, come see this, too!

76
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,430
Come, come everyone, quickly!

77
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:35,480
Here is...ta-da...the kitchen!

78
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:49,600
I love it!

79
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,510
This is your guys' bedroom!

80
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:54,720
Such a nice bed!

81
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,320
And this is the room for the baby!

82
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,000
What do you think?

83
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,750
Amazing! It's so cute!

84
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:04,050
That's right.

85
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:11,120
Finally, I married...

86
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,670
...Irie Naoki-kun, who I have admired for so long!

87
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:05,170
Mischievous Kiss 2: Love in TOKYO

88
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:11,180
Episode 2

89
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:26,510
Okay.

90
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:28,800
I'm up.

91
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:35,440
Today is my first day as a wife.

92
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:40,630
Next to me is my beloved husband!

93
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:44,260
Irie-kun is still sleeping.

94
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:50,460
The fact that I get to see this cute, sleeping face every morning from now on...

95
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:55,240
H-a-p-p-y!

96
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:04,110
Alright! For this perfect husband, I'm going to make a perfect breakfast!

97
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:08,480
A traditional Japanese breakfast.

98
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,530
Tofu miso soup,

99
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:12,300
Aji-no-hiraki,

100
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:16,660
and Japanese omelets will be good.

101
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:19,780
Right, right, I shouldn't forget the natto (traditional Japanese food made from fermented soybeans)!

102
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:25,240
And then I'll see him off to work...

103
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:05,210
Oh no!

104
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:15,320
Oh, Kotoko-chan, good morning.

105
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,760
You could have slept in longer.

106
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,950
Well, I... Excuse me.

107
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:22,790
It's fine, totally okay.

108
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:26,250
Because after your honeymoon,

109
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,990
you must be tired somehow, right?

110
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:31,980
Because of  something  , right?

111
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:39,000
You fail as a new wife.

112
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:45,730
Poor older brother to get married to this lazy woman.

113
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:49,030
I wonder if he's regretting it right now.

114
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:53,020
I'm sorry.

115
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:57,740
Where is Irie-kun?

116
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:01,420
I don't know. Didn't he leave already?

117
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:03,140
You're kidding!

118
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:05,730
Irie-kun?

119
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:08,870
Thank goodness, I made it in time.

120
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:11,150
Hey, good morning.

121
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:13,550
I'm sorry.

122
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:16,710
Since the alarm clock rang so early in the morning,

123
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:21,570
I was looking forward to what I might get for breakfast.

124
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:24,430
I was thinking, ''Oh, the married life is nice."

125
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:27,740
"I got a great wife.''

126
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:30,090
Well, I...I...

127
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:33,260
Tomorrow! I'll do it tomorrow for sure!

128
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:35,100
That's a lie.

129
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,570
Because I don't expect anything from you.

130
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:40,480
Well, that's a shock.

131
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,380
Well then, I'm off.

132
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:45,760
Wait a minute, Naoki.

133
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:51,590
Naoki, isn't there something you have forgotten?

134
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:52,870
What?

135
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:57,280
When saying, "I'm off!" to a new wife, you have to kiss, of course!

136
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:00,500
When the camera is pointed at me like that, of course, I wouldn't do it.

137
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:03,250
Then if I remove the camera?

138
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:06,190
Enough already.

139
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:10,280
We'll decide about things pertaining to us by ourselves. Leave us alone.

140
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:15,980
Naoki-kun, thinking that you can do anything on your own is a mistake.

141
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:19,240
But first, as newlyweds...

142
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:23,600
Aren't you forgetting an extremely important thing?

143
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,860
What?

144
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:29,760
Don't tell me you have forgotten?

145
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:34,010
Well, about that, it's already been covered during our honeymoon.

146
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:36,230
Marriage registration.

147
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:37,080
What?

148
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:41,480
You forgot it didn't you? Seriously Naoki...

149
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:46,600
You wouldn't go to the ward office, how can you forget such an important thing?

150
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,470
So that means, without marriage registration,

151
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:52,800
we're not really married?

152
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,880
-That's right.
- Then I'm stil...

153
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,580
Aihara Kotoko?

154
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:03,450
Irie-kun! We have to go to the ward office!

155
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:08,160
Kotoko-chan, you don't need to be in such a hurry.

156
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,490
See! A marriage registration form!

157
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:14,270
Just in case you make a mistake,

158
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:17,380
I got a lot!

159
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:20,790
And I even stamped them all as your witness.

160
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:25,060
Wow, this is really a lot. Thank you.

161
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:29,750
Sorry, but I don't plan to register the marriage, yet.

162
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,540
What?

163
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:34,630
I want to think about it a little.

164
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:36,550
Let's wait on the marriage registration.

165
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:39,010
W-wait, Naoki!

166
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:42,860
I won't forgive such a thing!

167
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:50,610
Yo!

168
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:54,690
Why, isn't this the newlywed Kotoko.

169
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:56,740
How is the newlywed life?

170
00:13:56,740 --> 00:14:01,750
You can't just be doing naughty things.

171
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:07,280
Wow, I can't believe Irie acknowledged you.

172
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,900
I've seen a miracle.

173
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:12,510
My future with Matsumoto seems bright!

174
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:17,300
Oh, sorry. It's not 'Aihara' anymore, but 'Irie'-san, right

175
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,840
I'm still...

176
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:25,920
What was that?

177
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,160
I'm still 'Aihara'.

178
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:33,340
What ?! You're still 'Aihara'?!

179
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:36,540
You're voice is too loud!

180
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:41,450
But you got married right..? Yes, there was a wedding.
Yes, I went to the wedding.

181
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:43,710
We still haven't registered our marriage.

182
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:47,430
What does that mean? That Irie-kun doesn't want to register the marriage or something?

183
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:52,160
I don't really get Irie-kun.

184
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:56,210
What does he have to think about?!

185
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:59,510
Please calm down Aihar...no, Irie-san...?
No, Aihara...no, Irie-san?

186
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:01,860
Maybe it's to get rid of the trouble of divorce?

187
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,510
Matsumoto?

188
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:06,080
That's just like Irie-kun.

189
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,130
The way he does things is amazing.

190
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:09,580
What?!

191
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:13,210
To put it simply, you're just being "tried out" right now.

192
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:16,560
So he can divorce you if he thinks you fail as a wife.

193
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,850
That's not true...

194
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:24,670
Well, now that you understand. I'll need to start going after Irie-kun again.

195
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:27,750
See you later, Aihara-san.

196
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:33,510
Matsumoto, hey!

197
00:15:55,750 --> 00:16:01,560
This is the reception desk, there are a few people here who claim to be friends with Irie-sama.

198
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,580
Who is it?

199
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:05,990
Oh, they claim you will know once you meet them, and will not give a name.

200
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:07,300
Then I will not see them.

201
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:11,160
He said it. He said it. His name is 'Aoki' from Tonan University.

202
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:14,240
Aoki? Who's that?

203
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,000
Fine.

204
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,980
Send him in.

205
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,420
I'm Aoki from the anime club.

206
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:24,320
I'm Akagi. I'm Kimura.

207
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:28,020
Anime club?

208
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:31,410
Do you guys from the anime club need something...?

209
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:33,750
No, we were just surprised...

210
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:36,820
...that an otaku became the president of Pandai.

211
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:38,070
Right? Right?

212
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:41,250
To be honest, we actually produced

213
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,570
something that relates a lot to an otaku.

214
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:48,090
Yes, it took us a year and a half to make this!

215
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,440
Want to see?

216
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,020
No, not really.

217
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:56,310
What? But I think you will want it really badly.

218
00:16:56,310 --> 00:17:00,550
I mean, we heard that an otaku got married to Aihara.

219
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:03,280
What are you talking about, exactly?

220
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,130
Want to see?

221
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:10,020
Sure, fine. I'll see it.

222
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:12,780
If you guys will leave if I see it.

223
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:16,780
Yesssssss!

224
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:23,400
Ta-da! 'Racquet Warrior, Kotorin'!

225
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,970
What is this? You guys even made a game?

226
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:28,630
Exactly!

227
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:32,960
Yes, we are very smart! The character is cute, isn't she?

228
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,850
No, not really.

229
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:41,070
-Kotorin?
-Exactly!

230
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,580
Hello. Irie-kun?

231
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:57,910
Kotoko.

232
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,880
What's wrong? Are you busy with work?

233
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,310
Yeah, I'm not coming home today.

234
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:06,760
I probably won't be home for a while.

235
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:17,270
Next Day

236
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:29,160
Irie-kun, didn't come home the next day...

237
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,670
Two Days Later

238
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:44,120
...or the day after that...

239
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,900
Three Days Later

240
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:02,700
...or the day after that, too.

241
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:15,820
Irie-kun...

242
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:05,890
Yes! It's finished!

243
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:11,090
Hey! Irie-kun!

244
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,930
I love you.

245
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:29,880
Excuse me.

246
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,810
Yes.

247
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:34,600
I want to meet...

248
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:38,800
the first president, Irie Naoki-san.

249
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,670
Oh, I'll ask for you.

250
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:46,650
What is your name?

251
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:48,320
I'm his wi...

252
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:54,450
Oh, no, if you could please say 'Kotoko' , he'll understand.

253
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:56,510
Yes. It's Kotoko-san?

254
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:57,980
Yes.

255
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:02,200
How pitiful.

256
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:06,880
I can't even proudly say I'm his wife.

257
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:18,350
A bento (lunch box) ?

258
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:21,950
Kotoko, how thoughtful of you.

259
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:25,740
Come here. I'll give you a hug.

260
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:32,890
Irie-kun.

261
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:35,570
What an amazing wife.

262
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:40,250
Let's register our marriage immediately.

263
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,780
Young lady? Young lady?

264
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,750
Yes!

265
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:53,570
I'm really sorry but Irie-san says he won't meet you right now.

266
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:54,640
What?

267
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,410
I'm really sorry.

268
00:21:56,410 --> 00:22:00,040
If you want to give something to him
you can leave it with me.

269
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,550
Then, please do me this favor.

270
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:08,970
Yes.

271
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:14,750
You were declined!?

272
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,700
That can't be right...

273
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,830
And you're still not registered, right?

274
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:25,460
In addition to not coming home for two weeks,
even if you go to see him, he refuses.

275
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:29,550
Saying it's work, it's suspicious, isn't it?

276
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:32,350
Could it be that...

277
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:36,170
Hey, wait. No stop!

278
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:38,930
Is that true?

279
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:40,940
Kin-chan...

280
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:45,500
Is your marriage really not registered?
Is Irie really not coming home at night?!

281
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,580
He is making you upset?

282
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:49,260
Well, that's...

283
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:53,370
Well, hey, there could be some reasons for this...

284
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:55,920
Kin-chan, where are you going?

285
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,520
Just watch!

286
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:00,750
I'm going to beat that kid.

287
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:03,000
Wait a minute, Kin-chan!

288
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:06,550
Irie !
Irie, where are you?!

289
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:09,300
Irie, where are you?

290
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,830
Do you know Irie? Hey!

291
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:15,330
Come out! Irie!

292
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,470
What's with all the commotion?

293
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:24,610
You...What are you doing here?

294
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:28,130
Why? Why haven't you registered your marriage?

295
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:32,540
Why haven't you been going home?
Why have you been avoiding Kotoko?

296
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:35,920
Have you been preparing so that you can leave if things get bad?

297
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,820
You know, I...

298
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:43,330
As long as Kotoko was happy
I wasn't planning on saying anything.

299
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:46,480
I gave up on Kotoko and entrusted her to you!

300
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,680
That's what I thought!

301
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:51,850
But you're already making her cry!

302
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:53,970
That's your selfishness.

303
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:56,700
Give up on Kotoko!

304
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:01,540
This is a problem between Kotoko and me.

305
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:04,050
It has nothing to do with you.

306
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,690
What did you say? You...

307
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:12,810
You there, what are you doing?

308
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:15,080
Hey, stop it.

309
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,110
What's this? Let go off me!

310
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:19,390
-Wait! Wait!
-Hey, Irie!

311
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:23,210
- Kotoko.
- The bad one isn't Kin-chan.

312
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:24,610
It's Irie-kun, isn't it?

313
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:27,300
You don't think of me as your wife.

314
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:30,260
I'm always the one that gets excited.

315
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:34,440
I am the only one who feels insecure.

316
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:38,670
I don't want a marriage like this!

317
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:43,140
Then let's break up.

318
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:46,490
Luckily, we never registered our marriage.

319
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:51,230
What are you saying? You bastard!

320
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:56,480
Hey, let go off me! Kotoko!

321
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:04,100
It looks like I will get her back.

322
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,860
It's my win!

323
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:12,230
Hey, Kotoko!

324
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:24,180
Kotoko.

325
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:29,970
Is it okay to be relaxing here when it's dinner time?

326
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:34,860
I think it's time where everyone leaves work now.

327
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:38,410
It's fine. Since Irie-kun isn't coming back.

328
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:41,160
Even if I stay at home, there's nothing I can do.

329
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:45,320
Kotoko.

330
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:50,880
I heard from Kinnosuke on what happened, but...

331
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:57,220
I think it has a cost to it.

332
00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:02,020
A man risks his life for work.

333
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:06,300
On top of storming into your husband's office because he's not coming home from working all the time,

334
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:09,330
you pick a fight with him? What right do you have?

335
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:15,290
Don't do things like that to bring down your husband's reputation.

336
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:21,640
Instead of thinking about yourself, think a bit more about Naoki-kun.

337
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:24,070
Wait a second, Boss.

338
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:25,890
You shouldn't blame her at all!

339
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:30,270
Hey, Kinnosuke.
Irie's the one in the wrong.

340
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:33,360
I am disappointed in him! That guy isn't doing anything.

341
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,980
Don't say unnecessary things. This is between the two of them.

342
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:40,740
Even then...Boss!
Enough, get to work.

343
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:43,800
Hey... Kinnosuke...

344
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:48,770
Understood.

345
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:56,230
That's true, but please think some about
Kotoko's feelings, too.

346
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:14,430
I'm sure Naoki has his reasons.

347
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:17,170
Believe in him a bit more.

348
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:23,120
If you don't have trust, what can you do?

349
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,720
Hey! Don't be zoning out!

350
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:48,400
Raise your voice!

351
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,120
I said use your voice you idiot!

352
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,160
Believe?

353
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:57,510
Believe in Irie-kun?

354
00:27:58,370 --> 00:28:01,610
But... I miss him.

355
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:06,430
I really miss Irie-kun.

356
00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:30,850
Kotoko.
Kotoko.

357
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:34,870
Irie-kun?

358
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:36,830
Irie-senpai?!

359
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:38,990
Kotoko, come here!

360
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:41,900
We're going out, so hurry and come here!

361
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:45,000
Okay. Ah, but if I want to leave, I need to get permission!

362
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,470
It's fine. There's no time. Hurry up!

363
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:51,310
Yes!

364
00:28:57,620 --> 00:29:00,730
Irie-kun, what's wrong?

365
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:07,000
Irie-kun? Irie-kun?

366
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:14,970
Irie-kun, where are we going?

367
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:17,230
You'll understand when we get there.

368
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:42,460
We've finished with the preparations.

369
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:45,630
Alright. Let's start soon.

370
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:48,140
Okay, let's begin.

371
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:58,510
Thank you for your patience.
Let's welcome Irie Naoki.

372
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:07,520
What? What? What?

373
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:12,010
Now, without delay let's hear from Irie-san.

374
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:15,240
Kotoko, just a moment.

375
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:22,670
This press conference would be streamed live globally over the internet.

376
00:30:22,670 --> 00:30:25,930
Hey! Kotoko-chan!

377
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:28,670
- Kotoko-chan !
- Dad!

378
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:30,790
Oh, good, you guys made it in time!

379
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:33,910
What's going on? What is this?

380
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:37,750
Huh? You didn't hear from Naoki?

381
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:40,920
On behalf of Pandai, I would like to thank all of you

382
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:44,570
from the various media outlets,

383
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:48,970
for attending our online game product launch conference.

384
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:52,610
I'm the Production Supervisor, Irie Naoki.

385
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,880
Irie-san, you are lauded

386
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:00,890
as number one in the industry, but with the launch of this new product...

387
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:05,960
Naoki produced our upcoming online game.

388
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:08,000
- Online game?
- That's right.

389
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,030
If it's simple, it takes several months...

390
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:14,800
Actually, usually over a year, but
in only a few weeks

391
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:17,830
and with only a few people, he completed it.

392
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:21,730
It's amazing. Until this very day...

393
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:24,600
he's been pulling all nighters all this time.

394
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:27,370
Honestly, he's probably exhausted from lack of sleep.

395
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:31,420
He didn't have to rush holding the conference.

396
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:36,700
Despite that, today...

397
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:40,370
I told him to contact you and tell you to come.

398
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:45,800
But he said that he would pick you up himself.

399
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:49,070
Is that so?

400
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:50,940
Irie-kun.

401
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:52,950
With that, the production staff...

402
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:56,280
...will introduce the main character.

403
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:59,540
Character Design Supervisers...

404
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:02,060
...the fourth-year students of Tonan University's Anime Club.

405
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:10,140
Wow! It's them! So cool!

406
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:12,230
Kotorin is the best!

407
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:14,140
-'Kotorin'?
-What?

408
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:17,180
What is it?

409
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:24,240
And the title of the new production is, 'Racquet Warrior, Kotorin'!

410
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,770
Kotorin?

411
00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:38,120
Wow!

412
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:41,420
It's Kotorin!

413
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:43,610
Woah, this is...?!

414
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:46,000
What? What's going on?

415
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:47,910
Huh?

416
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:53,650
And I'd like to present the person who was the role model for the character Kotorin.

417
00:32:53,650 --> 00:32:57,000
Kotorin is Kotoko-san.

418
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:00,550
Wow~

419
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:02,840
It's Kotoko!

420
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,070
Kotoko!

421
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:06,610
What? Kotoko?

422
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:07,940
Hey, it's Kotoko! Eh?!

423
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:08,880
Eh?! What is this?

424
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:12,230
Kotoko-san, please come up to the stage.

425
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:17,510
Yes.

426
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:34,470
Please allow me to introduce...

427
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:38,690
...my partner, Irie Kotoko.

428
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,500
Say your greetings.

429
00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:49,040
O-Okay.

430
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,710
Well...

431
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,550
I'm Kotoko.

432
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:10,110
Ah, I am intelligent Irie-kun's wife.

433
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:13,020
It's a pleasure to meet you all.

434
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:20,320
Was that weird?

435
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,400
Yes.

436
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:27,860
Kotoko...

437
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:33,090
It's been a while, hasn't it?

438
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,100
Irie-kun!

439
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:04,240
It was embarrassing, but

440
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:10,840
...it was a really, really happy moment.

441
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:47,340
Huh? These pajamas...

442
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:50,260
Ah, sorry. It's a new one I bought.

443
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:52,330
What about my old ones?

444
00:35:52,330 --> 00:35:54,600
Well...

445
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:59,340
I used it for this.

446
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:00,260
What?

447
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:06,420
I was lonely since you weren't coming home...

448
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:13,380
This is Irie-kun. Looking at him cheered me up.

449
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,510
I quit my job today.

450
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:18,950
Really?

451
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:19,990
Yes.

452
00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:24,490
I'm yet to hand over the position, but I'm thinking of coming back to the university starting next month.

453
00:36:24,490 --> 00:36:27,640
Then are you going to start studying to be a doctor again?

454
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:28,690
Yes, finally.

455
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:33,840
Yay, isn't that great!

456
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:37,090
Hey, will the game become a hit?

457
00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:39,050
Of course, it will.

458
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:43,370
I even managed to eat the egg bento with (egg) shells in it.

459
00:36:43,370 --> 00:36:46,700
What? There were shells in there?

460
00:36:47,810 --> 00:36:51,180
Oh, I'm sorry.

461
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:12,000
Irie-kun, I missed you.

462
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:20,520
Eh?

463
00:37:30,170 --> 00:37:32,930
You've worked hard today.

464
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:44,680
One Month Later

465
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:47,790
Hey, look!

466
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:50,430
The game onii-chan made, it's in the newspaper!

467
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:52,870
What?

468
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:57,570
Amazing! It says that 'Kotorin' is a big hit!

469
00:37:57,570 --> 00:38:02,510
'An excitement that has never been seen until now.
A money maker that has been unheard of'!

470
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:05,810
As expected of onii-chan!

471
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:08,250
Hey, let's go.

472
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:10,140
Okay!

473
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:15,040
Ah, I understand!

474
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:19,190
From now on Naoki's going to university.

475
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:24,370
Have a safe trip!

476
00:38:24,370 --> 00:38:26,830
We'll be off now!

477
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:35,360
Before we go to the university, mind if we run an errand?

478
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,840
Huh?

479
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:42,110
Setagaya District Government Office

480
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:44,400
District Government Office?

481
00:38:55,770 --> 00:38:58,860
Irie-kun?

482
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:02,100
What is that?

483
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:17,220
Hey, you need to sign, too.

484
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:18,920
Got it.

485
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:26,210
Don't write it wrong.

486
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:27,970
I understand.

487
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:36,610
Hey, why are you carelessly writing 'Irie'?

488
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:41,260
What? Am I not 'Irie Kotoko'? Still?

489
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:44,410
It can't be helped.

490
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:48,450
In this aspect, our parents were smart, huh.

491
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:56,950
Yes, certainly.

492
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:01,850
Ah, could the wife please write the character pronunciation here.

493
00:40:01,850 --> 00:40:03,370
What? 'Wife'?

494
00:40:03,370 --> 00:40:06,280
Yes, right here.

495
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:08,030
Wife?

496
00:40:08,930 --> 00:40:11,120
Wi-...

497
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,680
Wife!

498
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:14,500
Hey...

499
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:25,250
With this, I'm now really your wife.

500
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:33,920
I thought you would be nervous, but...

501
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:36,820
as a man's pride and responsibility,

502
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:42,490
I wanted to get my dad's company securely back on it's feet before we got married.

503
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:50,930
But my mom jumped ahead with booking the chapel and all that without my consent

504
00:40:50,930 --> 00:40:55,520
so it ended up taking up alot of time.

505
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,620
I'm fine, though.

506
00:40:57,620 --> 00:41:00,180
Because I believed in Irie-kun.

507
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:05,490
That time when I was exhausted and Kinnosuke barged in...

508
00:41:05,490 --> 00:41:07,940
But you see,

509
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:11,030
Well that's...

510
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:14,340
Take good care of me, dear wife.

511
00:41:19,370 --> 00:41:23,030
Same here, Irie-kun!

512
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:24,850
Irie-kun!

513
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:27,970
Wait for me!

514
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:35,120
And from now on, I'm officially 'Irie Kotoko'!

515
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:06,480
#3 Hello baby!?

516
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:09,300
I'm Christine Robins.

517
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:13,630
I'd like to meet my ideal boyfriend in Japan.

518
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:14,820
No!

519
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:19,630
Kotoko-chan, you're pregnant.

520
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:22,780
Irie-kun's mother is re-tweeting on Twitter like crazy.

521
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:25,590
Grandfather!?

522
00:43:25,590 --> 00:43:26,350
What about the check up at the hospital?

523
00:43:26,350 --> 00:43:29,630
I haven't though but Mom...

524
00:43:29,630 --> 00:43:31,620
Let's go.
