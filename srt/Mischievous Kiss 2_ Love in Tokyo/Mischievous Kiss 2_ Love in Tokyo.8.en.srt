00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:01,480
Nursing Lecture Room 1

2
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:05,300
Speaking of which, it will be your clinical practice starting next Monday.

3
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:10,890
Let me give you some materials from Tonan University Hospital where you are going to go.

4
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:14,120
My heart's beating so fast! I wonder if there will be any handsome male patients?

5
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,240
What to do?

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,150
What should I do if I fall in love with the patient?!

7
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:20,090
Hurry!

8
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:24,330
Time has come.

9
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:28,680
I wonder what kind of patients I will meet.

10
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,740
I don't want to unless it's Kotoko-neechan!

11
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,720
Leave it to me!

12
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,630
Naotaro-kun, it's not good to be selfish.

13
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:40,640
But... But...

14
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:44,920
This is good.

15
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:54,100
You are just like my grandchild.

16
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:58,320
Oh, Grandma Naoko...

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,190
But it won't always be peaceful, right?

18
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,420
Don't try to console me!

19
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:11,620
No matter what...I just won't be able to walk.

20
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:18,300
Idiot! You're a coward.

21
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:21,630
Naojiro-kun, you can do it!

22
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:23,550
Kotoko-san.

23
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:27,410
Let's work hard on the rehabilitation together.

24
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:33,430
Hey, Irie!

25
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:37,820
Kotoko-san...has entered her own world again.

26
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:42,040
Hey! Irie! Come back to reality!

27
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:45,170
I'm sorry.

28
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:48,690
Don't let your mind wander when you're practicing.

29
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:49,400
Okay.

30
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,890
Okay, the materials I gave you now

31
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:54,760
have the information of the patients

32
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:58,390
at the Orthopedics Department you're going to as interns.

33
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:03,880
Read and understand them throughly so you can help the patients.

34
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:06,130
Yes!

35
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:27,480
♫KISS what I've been longing for,
the complicated kiss from you♫

36
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:35,020
♫Mischievous kiss♫

37
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:52,540
♫On the sloping path, the wind passes through♫

38
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:58,940
♫If you look up at the sky, the sun is sparkling♫

39
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:08,620
♫I catch up with an innocent expression,
and our eyes meet SPARK♫

40
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:15,670
♫No matter if I cry, or laugh;
and even if I want to escape reality♫

41
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:23,010
♫This feeling is the only thing I can't control♫

42
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:29,000
♫KISS a greedy kiss, the kiss I remember,
the kiss I was awakened by♫

43
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,320
♫Mischievous kiss♫

44
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:40,420
♫KISS the kiss I've waited for, the kiss that betrayed me,
it started with a kiss♫

45
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:44,560
♫Mischievous kiss♫

46
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:47,350
♫Oh kiss♫

47
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,700
♫Oh kiss♫

48
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:03,600
Mischievous Kiss 2
Love in TOKYO

49
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:14,160
#8 Grandma Toyo is the rival

50
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:19,820
Good morning, I am Hosoi, the Matron.

51
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,140
Good morning.

52
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:24,830
From today, for two weeks, these are the students

53
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:28,270
who will be doing their nursing practice here at the Orthopedic Department.

54
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:34,540
Everyone, if you have any questions,
please consult your seniors over here.

55
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:37,270
Yes.

56
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:38,470
Ah...

57
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:41,180
So nervous!

58
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:48,310
We'll move to the ward now. I'll introduce you to a few patients.

59
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:49,840
Ah, Akiko-chan.

60
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,870
Saeki-san, hello! I'm going to go to rehabilitation now.

61
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:57,170
Oh, really? Actually, this is just a good time to introduce him.

62
00:04:57,170 --> 00:05:01,740
This is Kamogari-kun who is here on a two-week clinical practice starting from today.

63
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:05,530
I'm Kamogari Keita, nice to meet you.

64
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:11,760
Nice to meet you.

65
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:15,050
Chief Saeki, it's a good opportunity.

66
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:17,900
Is it alright if I send her to the rehabilitation room?

67
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,490
Oh, please do then.

68
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:22,370
Thank you.

69
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,610
Okay, shall we go then, Akiko-chan?

70
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:27,900
Yes.

71
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:32,830
Not feeling cold today?

72
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,540
It's okay.

73
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:41,060
Shiun-kun, he is Kikyou Motoki-kun, an intern.

74
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:52,450
He's going to help us out for the next two-weeks,
please take good care of him, alright?

75
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:55,220
What? Is he really a guy?

76
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,320
I can't tell, I can't tell!

77
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,250
Well, whatever.

78
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,710
Shiun-kun? Where are you Shiun-kun?

79
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:05,990
Aoki-san.

80
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:18,320
You make a good picture.

81
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:22,230
Moe!

82
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:25,410
You'll get used to it.

83
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:30,430
Well I...had a bike accident.

84
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:33,440
I got bloody all over my face.

85
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,660
Yawamoto-senpai, may I change his bandages?

86
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:40,620
What? Ah...you can try if you want to.

87
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:45,530
Show~ me~ the wound, please~

88
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,680
[512--Ms. Yoshida Toyo]

89
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,350
Yoshida-san, good morning!

90
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:56,900
An intern's here.

91
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:00,880
Irie-san will be here to help out for two weeks starting today.

92
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,740
I'm Kotoko Irie.

93
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:06,160
Nice to meet you, Yoshida-san.

94
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:13,580
I can't remember intern's names.

95
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:15,430
What?

96
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:19,920
You can't change sheets efficiently, I know.

97
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,760
This isn't right...

98
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,370
Geez!

99
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:32,580
That brat!

100
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,440
Shion? Huh!

101
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:37,550
He keeps snacking, eating a lot of calories.

102
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:39,690
It's hard to deal with those anime otaku guys, too.

103
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:43,900
They keep talking about anime like maniacs for an hour straight.

104
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:47,770
You'll be an anime master in two weeks.

105
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:49,760
My patient's nice though.

106
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:53,090
-Mine too.
-Ah...

107
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,310
Hey Kotoko, what's the matter?

108
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:58,170
You look exhausted.

109
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:05,350
Well...

110
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:08,570
there's this patient, Yoshida-san.

111
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:12,460
She is REALLY something.

112
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:13,790
Huh?

113
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:17,500
This morning alone, there's been eight nurse calls.

114
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,510
Eight times?!

115
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:23,700
Shoulder problems, back problems,
arm problems, leg probelms

116
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:27,040
poured the tea, refilled the tea, refilled one more time,

117
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:31,160
and then again! Shoulder problems, back problems...

118
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:34,780
Oh, hi, Irie-san. You worked really hard this morning.

119
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:37,420
Likewise, good work.

120
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:40,250
Grandma Yoshida started that again.

121
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,550
Oh, she's bullying interns.

122
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:43,660
Huh?

123
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:47,570
Ah, sorry about leaving all the nurse calls to you.

124
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:51,920
Even if I go, she'll say "Not you!" and chase me away.

125
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:56,860
Be careful, alright? The intern before you quit
because she lost confidence.

126
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:59,890
What? That kid quit?

127
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:02,900
Irie, what are you eating?

128
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:05,290
Irie, what are you gonna eat?

129
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:10,740
-Irie-kun!
-Ah, so cool!

130
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,820
I accompanied him checking up on a patient a while ago.

131
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,960
What, really!?

132
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,360
Erm...

133
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:20,670
That person...is a medical student who is here on
clinical practice, called Naoki Irie!

134
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:22,480
Handsome, right?

135
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,640
That's right, he's an idol among the nurses now, you know?

136
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,720
He is so smart although he's still a medical student.

137
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,800
He is so much better than those lame doctors.

138
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,200
Ah, you guys,

139
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,080
don't even try to catch his eyes now.

140
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,880
If you get ahead of your seniors and do extra things...

141
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:46,460
I'm sure you know what will happen, right?

142
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:53,670
Hey, how did the practice go?

143
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:57,670
Did you get to see Yoshida-san you were concerned about?

144
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:03,370
If it's you two...I think you'll make a good combination.

145
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:04,990
That...

146
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:08,020
Well, all the best.

147
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:11,660
Ah...wait...a moment...

148
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:13,980
Hold on! What does this mean?!

149
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,520
Why do you get to speak to Irie-san,

150
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,980
when WE haven't even gotten the chance to?!

151
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:21,960
An intern who just started on her first day...
what's your relationship??

152
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,080
Well, that...

153
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,520
Speak up!

154
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,160
What's the situation??

155
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,240
-That, well...

156
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:32,900
Kotoko is Irie-san's wife.

157
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:39,220
WHAT?!?

158
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:43,660
I understand why you feel like screaming like that.

159
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,000
Wait, that's not true, right?

160
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,860
Although there was a rumour that he was married,

161
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:50,830
I didn't imagine she'd be so unattractive like this.

162
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:52,860
I don't understand it.

163
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,700
Even if you say that...

164
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:57,220
All right, then.

165
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:03,260
I bet she is a wonderful nurse because she is his wife.

166
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:08,340
Yeah, maybe she wouldn't need our instructions.

167
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:13,230
Well, why don't we leave looking after Grandma Yoshia to Irie-san?

168
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:17,170
Isn't that good?

169
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:18,720
Okay, let's eat.

170
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,810
Wait, seniors, seniors...

171
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:27,120
Kotoko, fight...!

172
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:33,820
[Yoshida Toyo]

173
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:37,000
Oh, sorry, excuse me!

174
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,970
Sorry!

175
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:42,090
35, 36...

176
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:44,380
Did you call, Yoshida-san?

177
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:48,590
You're too slow. If I call, you should be here within 15 seconds.

178
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:51,410
But this is the twelfth time!

179
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:53,530
What is it this time?

180
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:55,090
Turn on the TV for me.

181
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:56,670
Huh?

182
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,540
You can just use this remote control, right?

183
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:06,010
My arm hurts...

184
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:09,330
I can't press the button you know!

185
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:11,490
It's a button...

186
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:13,440
You just need to press a little...

187
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,520
And you have an arm that doesn't hurt right? Your right arm.

188
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:20,550
What? You!

189
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:23,170
To an elderly who is seriously ill and weak,

190
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:25,480
you dare to say such a terrible thing!?

191
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:30,080
Because you're totally fine, Yoshida-san! You're too spoiled.

192
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:33,030
What an awful woman!

193
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:35,860
Oh, you're a devil.

194
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:38,080
You're a devil! AH!!

195
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:46,210
-Yoshida-san...
-What's wrong? Did something happen?

196
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:48,990
Yoshida-san, what happened?

197
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:51,330
This intern ...!

198
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:52,860
She's horrible!

199
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:58,350
She suddenly started yelling at me at an elderly like me!

200
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:01,760
Irie-san! Come with me for a while!

201
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:08,920
It's going to be alright.

202
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:18,960
Out of all places... the fifth floor.

203
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:27,100
Even if I'm a intern...let me use the elevator, too, please!

204
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:30,970
Is it three more floors?

205
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:39,030
Here, sorry to keep you waiting.

206
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:41,540
It's wrong!

207
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:45,430
I said that I wanted the one with chocolate crunch, didn't I?

208
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:47,490
Does it look like a crunch bar to you?

209
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:49,790
They don't sell that at the shop!

210
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:53,100
End even though there's no crunch,
isn't it good enough if it's chocolate?

211
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,690
What are you saying?

212
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:58,960
Chocolate without crunch isn't chocolate!

213
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:04,060
Just go buy the right one and come back.

214
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:08,320
Damn it!

215
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,880
Take care.

216
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:14,010
I'm back.

217
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:17,070
Rie-san, good job today.

218
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,170
Here I go ...

219
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,120
Okay, it's here! Yoshida-san.

220
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,010
It's the 22nd nurse call of the day.

221
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:31,670
Hurry up and get moving!

222
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:33,090
Yes.

223
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:35,290
What has happened?

224
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:39,590
What do you need this time, Yoshida-san?

225
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:43,210
Come here. Come and hold this!

226
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:44,980
-Here.
-Okay.

227
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,690
Hold it properly!

228
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:49,950
Because today's an important day...

229
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:56,690
Yoshida-san, doctor's are coming!

230
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:01,000
Alright, hold this!

231
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:03,420
-What about this...
-Put it there.

232
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:05,050
Yes.

233
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:15,320
Irie-kun~

234
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:18,850
Because there are amazing moments like this,

235
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:21,980
I can't ever quit!

236
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:25,710
Grandma Yoshida, how is your condition?

237
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:29,150
How is it, do you feel a little better?

238
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:33,650
Well, that...it hurts a little here and there.

239
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:36,880
Besides, this intern

240
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,130
is not helpful with anything!

241
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,780
Oh, please cut some slack on her.

242
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:46,040
Let's have a little look, shall we?

243
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,560
Ah, but!

244
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:51,570
I'd like Dr. Irie to do it.

245
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:52,900
Yoshida-san, that's...

246
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:57,800
I have been waiting for Dr. Irie because we have doctors' walking rounds.

247
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,840
I have been waiting~

248
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:02,540
Well, Yoshdia-san, I have told you many times,

249
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:04,220
but we can't allow trainees to examine.

250
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:07,910
No! You're no good.

251
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:13,060
I will not let you touch this important body of mine.

252
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:16,050
I'll have Dr. Irie do it, please.

253
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:19,770
This is...

254
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:22,380
Well, I can't help it then.

255
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:25,250
This one time will be an exception, alright?

256
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,500
Irie-kun, you have a go.

257
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,930
Yes.

258
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:34,160
Don't tell me...it's like that?!

259
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,640
Yoshida-san, I'll take your pulse then.

260
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,110
Okay.

261
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,910
Doctor,

262
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:46,720
isn't my pulse fast?

263
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,820
Yes, seems like it is a little faster.

264
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:54,070
It's because I'm thinking about you.

265
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:58,180
I see. Then it should only be temporary.

266
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:01,400
What's with this conversation??

267
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:05,530
Yoshida-san really seems to like Irie-kun a lot, right?

268
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:08,120
It seems like there are no problems with her.

269
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,860
But there's no use, Yoshida-san.

270
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:13,300
Irie-kun is married with the intern Irie-san over here.

271
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,920
What?

272
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:22,920
Don't joke about it...

273
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,320
You are fooling an elderly like me.

274
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:31,660
There's no chance that Dr. Irie would be married
to this stupid intern, right?

275
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:33,570
It's the truth though.

276
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:41,930
She will bully me even more ...

277
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:54,070
"Kotoko-san," right?

278
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,220
Yes.

279
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:59,010
I'm really sorry.

280
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:03,210
I've been so self-centered up till now.

281
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:10,030
If it's a girl chosen by Dr. Irie, there must be no mistake.

282
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:14,030
From now on,

283
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:17,380
please continue to take good care of me!

284
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:22,380
Grandma Yoshida!

285
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,550
Take care Yoshida-san.

286
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:30,750
Make sure you let me examine you from now on.

287
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,120
Okay, okay.

288
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:40,780
-Kotoko-san.
-Yes?

289
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:44,630
To show my apologies... would you like to eat some snacks with me?

290
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:47,020
Is that okay, grandma?

291
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:48,970
Wait a while.

292
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:50,600
I'll go get some tea.

293
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,970
No no, let me do that kind of...

294
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:57,120
It's alright, just sit here.

295
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:01,250
This is very delicious!

296
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:04,820
Eat some first, I'll be back soon.

297
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,360
Grandma...

298
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:18,780
It looks delicious!

299
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:27,060
This, this is it!

300
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:30,470
The moment and reason why I can't quit being a nurse.

301
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:33,760
I will never ever

302
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,680
forget this day!

303
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,730
Irie-san?

304
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:41,780
Matron, look at this!

305
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:46,130
What in the world are you doing?

306
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:51,060
Stealing sweets from a patient, and making her go get tea?

307
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:53,690
-No...that's not...
-No excuses!!

308
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:57,470
Listen to me, right now, Yoshida-san came crying to me.

309
00:19:57,470 --> 00:20:00,460
She said 'Irie-san is a horrible wench!'

310
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:05,440
It's an unspoken rule that you don't take things given by patients.

311
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,640
But you!

312
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:11,490
Among all the interns I've seen,

313
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:14,600
you're the first one who behaves like that!

314
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:19,000
Irei-san! Are you listening to me?

315
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:34,900
Akiko-chan, today's rehabilitation was really good!

316
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,170
Thanks to you, Keita-san.

317
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:41,830
Akiko-chan, you will be able to walk again soon.

318
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,150
All the best!

319
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:46,750
Yes, I'll try my best!

320
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:48,240
Let's go.

321
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:09,060
I really didn't think it would turn out like that.

322
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:11,440
Grandma Toyo, this...

323
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,950
Scratch to the right.

324
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:20,820
Besides, it's not just Grandma Toyo who is my enemy...

325
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,260
That's going to hurt!

326
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:26,430
Besides, the procedure is wrong.

327
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:28,980
Do it as the manual says.

328
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:31,750
Irie-san, what is with this nursing care plan?

329
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:35,010
Re-write it.

330
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:37,730
Yes, sorry.

331
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:44,150
-Erm, where...
-Figure it out yourself.

332
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:48,480
No good. Make the bed again. It's too messy!

333
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,070
Sorry...

334
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:53,580
It's amazing how you're able to be a wife like this.

335
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:59,250
How should I put it?...
It feels like there are foes throughout the hospital...

336
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:04,850
Oh, this is not good ... Someone take my blood pressure ...

337
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:08,700
-Ah, I'm sorry!
-No, I'm sorry, too...

338
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:13,570
Akiko-chan, right?

339
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:16,310
Shall I push you?

340
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:21,640
How long have you been admitted, Akiko-chan?

341
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,700
Two months.

342
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,860
Well, it was an accident, wasn't it.

343
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:28,470
Keita takes care of you a lot, right?

344
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:32,080
Keita-san has an interest in rehabilitation.

345
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:38,120
But...I don't know when I'll be able to walk.

346
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:41,310
What if, for life...

347
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:46,020
Don't be discouraged! Keita will be upset to hear that, too.

348
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:51,210
Kotoko-san...

349
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:54,210
Kotoko-san, do you...about Keita-san...

350
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:57,640
Hmm? What about Keita?

351
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:00,670
Ah, it's nothing...

352
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:05,290
-What did you want to ask...
-Stop it, please!

353
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:08,220
It's enough...

354
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:17,190
Will it turn out that...

355
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:20,570
I won't be accepted by any patient?

356
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:48,800
I..Irie-kun!

357
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,480
That's a good picture, right?

358
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,990
Why is Irie-kun here?

359
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:01,220
Look...I have a lot more!

360
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:04,780
No way! Irie-kun Doctor Version...!

361
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:08,040
Even I don't have them!

362
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:13,060
May I have copies, too?

363
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:19,840
I don't want to~! I'm only looking at Irie-sensei from afar after all .

364
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,010
It doesn't seem like that to me!

365
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:26,350
I won't give you any copies to you, his wife.

366
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:29,970
Ah.. Irie-kun...!

367
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:34,380
Stop...it please!

368
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:39,540
- My chest...
- Huh?

369
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,370
My chest hurts.

370
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:48,330
What's wrong, Grandma Toyo?

371
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:56,860
Anyone, isn't there a doctor here? No!?

372
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:59,670
Excuse me, excuse me!
Oh, doctor!!

373
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:03,760
- What, what? Whatever, come here!
- H-hey!

374
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:07,680
Grandma Toyo, it's going to be ok! The doctor is...

375
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:11,550
What happened? What's with the commotion?

376
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:15,280
Oh? Why is everyone here?

377
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:19,550
Grandma Toyo, your heart?

378
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:23,360
Who said that my heart hurts?

379
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:27,800
While thinking about Dr. Irie, I just said that my heart "hurts".

380
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,160
It's just that.

381
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:34,210
Then you just suddenly ran out and caused a huge commotion.

382
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:39,690
That's so cruel! When I was really so worried about you!

383
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:41,560
You tricked me!

384
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:44,940
Don't blame me.

385
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:50,370
You can't know the difference between "heart attack" and "love-sickness?"

386
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:56,340
And are you going to be able to become a nurse like that?

387
00:25:56,340 --> 00:26:03,450
Excuse me, I'm not a doctor but an X-ray technician.

388
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:06,900
I'm sorry!

389
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,590
Can I...go now?

390
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:11,310
Ah, please. Sorry about it.

391
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:20,150
Seriously...Irie-san!

392
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:23,190
What are you doing?

393
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:26,690
Listen up! In emergency situations like that, keep calm,

394
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:31,070
and it's basics to check on her pulse and symptoms first.

395
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:33,860
What do you mean by a patient tricking you!

396
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:35,590
Yes.

397
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:42,190
Irie-san, come with me.

398
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:44,070
Yes!

399
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:02,790
Hey.

400
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:06,480
Irie-kun.

401
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,720
I heard that you created a commotion again.

402
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:21,290
I...lost my confidence.

403
00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:26,360
Even though I'm doing my best, it's not getting through to Grandma Toyo.

404
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:30,220
On top of that, I got upset for real.

405
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:35,030
I am completely being made fun of.

406
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:39,720
I am so ashamed of myself and exhausted.

407
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:48,010
How about...giving up being a nurse?

408
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:52,200
That is an alternative.

409
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:55,170
I've been wanting to say this.

410
00:27:57,100 --> 00:28:01,750
You want to become a nurse because
I'm going to become a doctor, right?

411
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:07,080
If it's just that, do you think it will work out?

412
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:11,430
When I see you nowadays, I can tell you're pushing your limit.

413
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:14,590
If it's so tough on you,

414
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:17,140
it's better if you give up.

415
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,410
Irie-san, from tomorrow onwards,

416
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:49,730
please don't go to Yoshida-san's ward anymore.

417
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:54,720
It's no good if you're just going to be
played around by the patient.

418
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,750
If you don't make time to tend to other patients,

419
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:59,730
you won't even be able to be an intern.

420
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:02,280
That's also better for you, right?

421
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:06,950
Since she's quite a difficult patient for interns...

422
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:14,890
That...is it ok to end on a note like that?

423
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:25,600
Grandma Toyo,

424
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:32,010
are you asleep?

425
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:34,430
What is it?

426
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,740
Well...

427
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:41,510
From tomorrow on wards,

428
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:44,600
you're not going to be under my charge anymore.

429
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:50,580
So...I was thinking of coming to say goodbye.

430
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:55,820
It seems like you and I

431
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:59,250
weren't really well-matched, right?

432
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:04,340
I really wonder why...

433
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:06,700
It's sad...

434
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:16,090
Sorry for annoying you all this while...

435
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:21,970
Please at least look at me for the last time!

436
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:24,360
Don't tell me...are you crying?

437
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:27,470
Why would I?

438
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:31,970
Oh no, Grandma Toyo do you have a fever?

439
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:34,500
I'm fine with this much.

440
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:37,380
Why don't you make a nurse call at times like this?

441
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:40,440
You always call us when you're well but don't call us when you really need to.

442
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,610
Aren't you being silly?

443
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:44,600
I don't want you to take care of me.

444
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,760
I'm always doing it!

445
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:51,000
Wait a while Grandma, I'll go call the doctor. Hold on!

446
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:08,420
She almost has pneumonia. Give her 5 litter of oxygen.

447
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:10,040
Yes.

448
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:23,030
Could it be that...her condition was truly bad this morning?

449
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:27,690
If I had checked properly like what the Matron said...

450
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:32,840
Toyo-san's condition is a bit...

451
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:36,120
Yes. She has a high fever...

452
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:39,060
What? Hello?

453
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:42,790
Well...

454
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:44,110
How was it?

455
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:46,960
Not good. They won't come if it's just a "high fever".

456
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,480
That's...

457
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:52,900
They said to call only if it was really critical.

458
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:56,610
Seriously...what do they think parents are?

459
00:31:56,610 --> 00:31:59,130
That's mean...but...

460
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:02,130
Well, it's quite common, you know.

461
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:07,810
They don't want to look after the elderly, so they send them to hospitals instead of senior centers.

462
00:32:07,810 --> 00:32:13,650
While you were here, you haven't seen anybody visit, right?

463
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:16,020
Now that you mention it...

464
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:19,340
It may seem like she's troubling you purposely,

465
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:22,860
but don't you think it might have been because she's lonely?

466
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:27,040
You see, veterans like us can handle her well.

467
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:31,280
But you, you give honest reactions, don't you?

468
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:35,030
I bet Yoshida-san had fun.

469
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:51,150
Chief!

470
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:57,990
Chief, is it okay if I stay by Yoshida-san's side for the night?

471
00:32:57,990 --> 00:33:01,600
It's alright, I've already informed the nurse on night shift.

472
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,540
But I...

473
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:05,920
Furthermore, interns can't take night shifts.

474
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,440
But!

475
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,510
You really...

476
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:11,710
-Saeki-san,
-Oh, Matron.

477
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:13,770
How was Yoshida-san's family?

478
00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:16,590
Well, they won't come.

479
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:21,150
I see. It's a problem, huh?

480
00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:25,720
At times like these, if only some acquaintance could come,

481
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:29,020
we might be able to find someone to stay with her instead...

482
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:34,020
Huh? An acquaintance...

483
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,320
I-I am...?

484
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,410
Irie-san! What are you doing?

485
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:46,730
It's time your practicum ended, right? Hurry up and get changed!

486
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:47,790
Yes.

487
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:51,750
After that, whatever you do is up to you.

488
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:55,880
As long as it doesn't interfere with your practicum tomorrow.

489
00:33:57,750 --> 00:34:00,970
Yes! Excuse me.

490
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,920
Irie-kun.

491
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:27,360
How is Yoshida-san?

492
00:34:30,410 --> 00:34:32,890
Her breathing is still heavy.

493
00:34:32,890 --> 00:34:35,770
Her fever hasn't gone down.

494
00:34:35,770 --> 00:34:38,050
If I had...

495
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:42,330
You already did what you could.

496
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:47,350
What's left is having faith in her capacity to recover.

497
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:52,470
Anyway, stay beside her for now.

498
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:55,390
Yeah.

499
00:34:57,050 --> 00:34:58,630
I'm leaving.

500
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:02,650
Okay. Thanks for coming.

501
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:06,250
Kotoko.

502
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:09,250
Stay firm.

503
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:12,410
Yes.

504
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:45,160
What's wrong? Grandma Toyo, where are you hurting?

505
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:57,800
Oh right...Grandma Toyo suffers from neuralgia
(pain along a damaged nerve).

506
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:03,690
You'll get better in a little while, right?

507
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:15,160
It doesn't feel right when you are quiet.

508
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:25,420
Was your husband similar to Irie-kun?

509
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:31,140
Well, although there aren't many good men like Irie-kun...

510
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:39,160
We probably have the same interest in guys, right?

511
00:37:07,070 --> 00:37:10,030
Heavy!

512
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:17,070
What is this? It's my first time seeing a nurse
who sleeps on her patient!

513
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:19,010
Grandma Toyo? How's your fever?

514
00:37:19,010 --> 00:37:22,170
I don't have a fever at all.

515
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,820
It's gone.

516
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:30,660
Grandma Toyo, this is great! Thank goodness!

517
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:33,210
Le-Let go!

518
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:35,660
That's great.

519
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:46,760
A while ago, I was not being nice to you. I'm sorry.

520
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:49,460
Were you? I don't remember.

521
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:56,100
Truthfully, I heard from Marina-san, that Keita-san likes you.

522
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:59,960
Somehow, I...

523
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,570
Marina (said that)?

524
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:05,400
That girl! Wait a minute...

525
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,840
Akiko-chan, do you like Keita??

526
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:11,210
Huh? That is...

527
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:15,150
I thought so!

528
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:19,310
Keita nags a lot, but he's a good guy.

529
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:21,650
All the best! I'll support you!

530
00:38:21,650 --> 00:38:23,700
Kotoko-san.

531
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:30,220
Ah, but Kotoko-san, about Keita-san...do you...

532
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:36,440
No, no, no. Actually, I'm Dr. Irie Naoki's wife.

533
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:39,230
Eh? Eeh?

534
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:47,230
Oh, after I became close to Shion-kun ~

535
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:51,610
It can't be helped. Meeting and parting are pairs.

536
00:38:51,610 --> 00:38:55,730
Good luck on becoming a fine nurse, Moto-oniichan.
[Onii-chan= Older brother]

537
00:38:55,730 --> 00:38:58,770
It's not older brother! Older sister!

538
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:09,490
Thank you! Manarin...

539
00:39:09,490 --> 00:39:11,140
Manarin?

540
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:16,080
From now on, we're gonna support Manarin and

541
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:22,320
Kotorin equally.

542
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:26,640
Sorry!

543
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:30,260
Please do me a favor and forget about me.

544
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:36,760
Sorry.

545
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:44,620
I fell again although I got better thanks to you ...

546
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:47,560
I'm over here.

547
00:39:48,770 --> 00:39:52,300
I'm so pitiful...

548
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:53,830
It's okay.

549
00:39:53,830 --> 00:39:59,430
Rather than that, why don't you show me your wound
one more time as a last memory?

550
00:40:02,330 --> 00:40:07,800
Aiko-chan, today is that last day. Up till now, thank you.

551
00:40:10,010 --> 00:40:13,610
What's wrong? Are you feeling sick?

552
00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:18,650
It's okay. Aiko-chan, you know, you'll be able to walk.

553
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:22,730
I have to say good-bye to Grandma.

554
00:40:25,330 --> 00:40:31,490
But, somehow, I feel sort of sad.

555
00:40:31,490 --> 00:40:35,170
No, no. I have to smile.

556
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:36,950
Let's go!

557
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:45,000
Grandma Toyo!

558
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:54,280
Wh-what!? Why are you and Irei-kun taking a picture together like that?

559
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:57,200
Shut up! This is a patient's privilege.

560
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:01,380
No fair!

561
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:04,140
Hey, Igarashi-senpai, can you take one of me, too?

562
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:06,440
Huh? Cut it out. You're training right now.

563
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,890
Please, I'm sorry!
-No way.

564
00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:10,310
Oh, please!
-No way!

565
00:41:10,310 --> 00:41:13,100
-Please, then let me borrow it!
-What are you doing?

566
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:15,450
You chose a pretty good girl, didn't you?

567
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:18,100
Right?

568
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:25,160
She is clumsy but has guts.

569
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:35,040
Okay, say cheese.

570
00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:06,720
Rika-chan will be coming to stay at our house.

571
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,330
Naoki!

572
00:43:08,950 --> 00:43:10,730
What is this!?

573
00:43:10,730 --> 00:43:13,190
Before going to America, I should've claimed Naoki.

574
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:16,900
I feel I'm left out.

575
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:19,560
She is an irritating but cute girl.

576
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:23,240
You must have a strong bond as a couple.

577
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:27,960
Yes. I'm Naoki Irie's wife!

578
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:29,710
Speaking of Naoki...

579
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:33,230
he's good at kissing.
