1
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:12,890
Oh, that girl...

2
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:35,480
You…You've come to our house before.

3
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:39,990
I'm sorry! I'm uh…uhm...

4
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:44,880
That uniform, Tonan Middle School's?

5
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:50,940
You're Yuuki's friend!

6
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,260
I'm sorry!

7
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,010
Ah, wait!

8
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:04,490
You like Yuuki, don't you?

9
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:13,810
You're from F Class?!?

10
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:18,080
Yes. It seems like I'm bad at studying.

11
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,790
I want to be in the same class as Yuuki-kun.

12
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:24,660
I keep aiming to get into the A class but...

13
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:28,500
I understand!

14
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,560
Same! We're the same! I was in the F class, too!

15
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,480
What? You were in the F class also?

16
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:38,900
Indeed. We were despised as dunces of Tonan.

17
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,750
I was in that F Class!

18
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:43,770
Onee-san. (Older sister)

19
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,920
What? Onee-san? You're making me blush.

20
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:53,780
But older sister, you're married to Yuuki-kun's
older brother, right?

21
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,590
Well, that is true.

22
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:00,500
How did you manage to get married?

23
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:04,360
i heard that Irie-kun's older brother is also an amazing genius

24
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:07,350
and hates women.

25
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:12,350
I guess there was no particular decisive fact, but

26
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:15,800
after I confessed to him, I kept pushing and pushing

27
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,990
for the past four years.

28
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:24,080
You're persistent... I wonder if I can be like you.

29
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,250
Konomi, what do you like about Yuuki?

30
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:32,250
What part? Lets see...

31
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:35,230
How he's smart!

32
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:38,210
And those cold eyes!

33
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:41,320
He has a good looking face.

34
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:46,150
His height…well, he'll grow.

35
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,290
Idiot.

36
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:02,170
That's how you see him...

37
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:06,230
You know what they say about 'Love is blind'.

38
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:07,890
What?

39
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:09,930
No-no, it's nothing.

40
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:15,100
Ah, that's right. Are you making contact with him somehow?

41
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:18,920
About that…I haven't even talked to him once.

42
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,030
Not even once?!

43
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:26,170
He probably doesn't even know about my existence.

44
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:30,190
He's in the A class, and I'm in the F class after all.

45
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:32,670
The distance between the A class and F class...

46
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:35,660
It's really not that much.

47
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:38,900
But in my heart,

48
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:43,120
the distance between us is a far away desert land.

49
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:52,600
I understand! I can understand!

50
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:58,820
It's as if I'm looking at my past self.

51
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,920
Onee-san!

52
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:06,160
There are quite a few problems with Yuuki's
personality, but

53
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,700
I'll root for you!

54
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:12,030
Let's do our best and win him over.

55
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,350
But...

56
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:18,470
Yuuki's older brother said things like he hated
people that were dumb.

57
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:20,790
But we are married right now.

58
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:24,300
Leave it up to Kotoko onee-san!

59
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,910
Is what I've said...

60
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,700
What Kotoko! Don't get in the way.

61
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,650
I didn't mean to.

62
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:48,850
Then since a while ago why have you

63
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:52,010
been sticking around me dozing off?

64
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:54,960
Dozing off, you say?

65
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,310
- I found a thread...
- If you don't have any business here, then

66
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:59,170
go away.

67
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,410
He's awfully defensive,

68
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:07,890
or perhaps, he is his usual self.

69
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:12,760
Hey, do you know a Sagawa Konomi?

70
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:15,130
Sagawa Konomi?

71
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:19,240
She is my friend of friends' niece.

72
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:22,440
Seems like she's attending Tonan Middle School.

73
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,220
She is your friend of friends' niece?

74
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:27,700
Yes-yes! I heard she's really cute!

75
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:32,330
Come to think of it, I think she's in the same grade as you.

76
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:33,680
I don't know her.

77
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,460
You don't know her?

78
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,580
There is no such girl in my class.

79
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:41,380
I don't remember any other girls outside of the A class.

80
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:45,910
Well, he is that type of person.

81
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:50,040
Then-then-then-then!

82
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,820
Yuuki, do you have any girl you like?

83
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:53,930
What?

84
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:56,070
-A girl you like!
-What?

85
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:59,100
Then, any interest in girls?

86
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,140
I don't have any!

87
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:07,440
Then that means you don't have any girl you like right now.

88
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,870
Well…after looking at you,

89
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,040
living being's called "girls,"

90
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:16,030
I loose my interest in them even more.

91
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:21,340
Girl he likes, none.

92
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:22,290
Send!

93
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:24,260

117
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:25,370
#10
Naoki-san, please take care of Kotoko

118
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:27,520
Eat a lot, alright?

119
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,420
How annoying!

120
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:32,470
Irie-kun, I'll serve your meal right away.

121
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:35,960
Here you go.

122
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:40,190
-Oh yeah, I went to see Satomi's baby today!
-Oh really?

123
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:42,180
Satomi-chan's baby?

124
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:43,910
How's Satomi? Is she doing well?

125
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:46,860
She's fine and happily being a new mother!

126
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,990
The baby's very adorable, too!

127
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:52,120
Look!

128
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:56,960
Wow! Looks exactly like Satomi-chan!

129
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:01,050
Baby was so adorable and put me in tears.

130
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:05,320
Indeed adorable.

131
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,990
Are you crying, Dad?

132
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:09,280
No way. Why do I need to cry?

133
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,840
Aihara-san?

134
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,840
Well, I've known Satomi-chan and Junko-chan

135
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,650
for a long time, so they are like my daughters.

136
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:18,740
Dad...

137
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:22,710
If you're like that now, what would you do when Kotoko-chan has a baby?

138
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:25,030
Kotoko-chan's baby must be

139
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:29,840
unbelievably adorable.

140
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:33,190
Kotoko's baby...

141
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,030
Aihara-san!

142
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:39,710
Oh no, I just remember the time when she was little.

143
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:42,870
What was she like... when she was little?

144
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:45,940
She cried screaming all day.

145
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:49,280
Etsuko and I were at a loss in the beginning.

146
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:52,110
And soon after that, she was silent all of a sudden.

147
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:55,450
Then we were flurried thinking that she might be dead.

148
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:58,180
So what was I doing?

149
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,220
You were just sleeping.

150
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:02,470
Oh my!

151
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:04,890
You are no different right now.

152
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:06,370
I guess you are right.

153
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:08,460
You haven't improved since then.

154
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:11,520
Hey now, Yuuki.

155
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:16,160
Speaking of which, I haven't seen Kotoko's baby pictures.

156
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,350
You know, our house was burned down.

157
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:21,580
- Because of the meteorite?
- Right.

158
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:24,140
So we don't know where the pictures went.

159
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:27,640
Is that so? That's a pity!

160
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:31,260
I don't know about when I was baby, but dad said

161
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,720
my face hasn't changed since I was little.

162
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,370
Kotoko-chan is always cute.

163
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:37,430
You mean she's childish?

164
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:41,570
I don't know anything about her mom.

165
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:44,670
You don't? I guess you're right.

166
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:47,860
I don't have any pictures of her anymore.

167
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:51,080
She was a lovely lady...Etsuko-san.

168
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,220
Oh, please...!

169
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:57,100
At least, for me she was.

170
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:00,010
Wasn't she a Miss Akita Komachi?

171
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:03,030
- Miss Akita Komachi?
- So I've heard.

172
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:05,010
You said I look like mom, didn't you?

173
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:08,370
I don't remember her much, but she was graceful and classy,

174
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:11,200
I remembered her being extremely beautiful.

175
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:16,270
She looks similar to Kotoko and extremely beautiful?

176
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:20,570
Father-in-law, isn't it Kokoto's moms' memorial day coming up next week?

177
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:23,430
Oh, that's right.

178
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:25,900
You knew, Irie-kun?

179
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:28,470
Every year, you two always visit her grave around this time.

180
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:32,600
I guess you're right. Since Estuko-san passed away...

181
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:37,000
how many years has it been?

182
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,230
She was a 1st grader, so

183
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:43,220
it has been 18 years.

184
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:45,550
Already?

185
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:48,920
We'll visit her again this year with two of us.

186
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,570
I'd like to come with you this year.

187
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:56,200
I've been wanting to pay my respect every year.

188
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,520
Wait, but it's an odd place in a remote location.

189
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:02,700
He's right. Besides, I'm sure you have a lot to study.

190
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,300
I'm grateful for your consideration.

191
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,350
You don't need to force yourself.

192
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:11,120
I'm not forcing myself, I have spare time around that time.

193
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,610
You're originally from Akita, right?

194
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:17,340
If we take Shinkansen, it'll be alright.

195
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:20,050
But...

196
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:22,980
I also would like to see the pictures of my mother-in-law.

197
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:26,240
Miss Akita Komachi...

198
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,900
It's not stopping...

199
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:46,840
Because her mother was a "rain girl", you see.
(Rain girl/boy in Jap refers to a person who brings the rain wherever they go)

200
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:52,800
It will take just about 30 minutes if we catch the next bus.

201
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,960
Hey, Naoki-kun?

202
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:02,260
Why don't we just visit the grave and go home this time?

203
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:04,520
We can visit her mom's house next time.

204
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:07,480
It might be rude to pay a visit soaking wet like this.

205
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,500
That sounds good. Nice idea, Dad.

206
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,920
Why don't we stop by a hot springs resort and eat a hot-pot dish or something?

207
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,120
We can't do that.

208
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,250
What?

209
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:18,610
Mother's already got in touch with the family in Akita.

210
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:22,710
Asking them to take care of us, thanking them for the trouble.

211
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:29,500
You're hiding something, right?

212
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:40,570
Can't help it then...we have to give up.

213
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:42,400
Give up?

214
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,650
You'll see when we get there.

215
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:58,630
How do we move on from here? By taxi?

216
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,210
Ah...

217
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:04,150
Well, how we move on...

218
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:09,310
Oh, there's Kotoko!

219
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,440
Kotoko-san~!

220
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:16,980
Welcome ~! Naoki-san~!

221
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:28,870
I'm glad you came.

222
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:31,630
Nice to meet you.

223
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:36,330
Kotoko-chan, Shigeo-kun, it's been a while.

224
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:42,650
I'm Uncle Tsuruzo, an older brother to Kotoko's mom.

225
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:45,360
Come on, let's come this way!

226
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,300
Come this way, hurry up!

227
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:49,670
Come this way!

228
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:07,620
Let us now have Miss Kumashiro present the bouquet.

229
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:13,080
Please accept the bouquet.

230
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,640
Welcome to Kumashiro.

231
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,660
Thank you.

232
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:37,530
I remember Kotoko-chan as a toddler.

233
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:40,690
Yeah, she really grew up.

234
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:45,010
Naoki-san is a very intellligent husband.

235
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:47,630
-They say that he's going to become a doctor.
-Wow!

236
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,280
Now-now-now!

237
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:53,320
Naoki-san, please say a few words.

238
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:56,660
-Uncle!
-It's fine, it's fine! Alright, here.

239
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:03,270
Please go ahead.

240
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:06,610
Nice to meet you. I am Irie Naoki.

241
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:09,060
Nice to meet you!

242
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:13,970
Thank you for this unimaginably warm welcome.

243
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:15,790
You're welcome.

244
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:20,610
But...the 'ki' in Naoki should be the first character in 'jyu moku'...

245
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:23,410
Ah! We got it wrong!

246
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:26,070
We misspelled it?

247
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:30,750
And if I may correct one more, the first character in "welcome"
is also misspelled...

248
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:31,810
It's not that one??

249
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:33,440
We got it wrong!

250
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,900
There's also an extra stroke in the second character.

251
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:41,610
Ah...he's really an intelligent son-in-law!

252
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:46,110
Kotoko-chan, your husband surpasses our expectations.

253
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:49,260
That's great, that's great!

254
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:53,280
Okay, let me take you to the house now.

255
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,980
No thank you, but thank you for your kindness.

256
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,800
It's enough if just the three of us go visit the tomb.

257
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,640
What are you saying Shigeo-kun?

258
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:05,040
If I let you go home like this, Ecchan will come out as "mokko."

259
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,050
Mokko?

260
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:10,100
Mokko is a ghost.

261
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:17,930
Let's get in (the van) now.

262
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:30,340
My niece in Tokyo brought her husband here.

263
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:35,040
We're gonna have a party tonight. Why don't you come?

264
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,500
- Yeah.
- Okay, come-come-come!

265
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:42,790
-Why are our relatives always like that?
-Shh!

266
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:43,910
You're too loud!

267
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:49,690
But...it's so embarrassing don't you think?
When Irie-kun is here...

268
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:53,440
What's with this car? Are they taking part in an election campaign or something?

269
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:57,140
Besides, why is Miss Kumashiro sitting in the passenger seat?

270
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:00,640
And why are we ...?

271
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,810
I got used to it quite a bit now.

272
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:07,140
Sorry about it Naoki-kun.

273
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:12,870
My wife's side of the family loves pageantry.

274
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:15,030
I'm different alright.

275
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:18,390
I can never get used to it.

276
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:23,450
That's why I usually visit the grave without telling anyone.

277
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:26,860
Could it be that...dad also received this kind of welcome
when you first came?

278
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:30,420
Exactly, that's right!

279
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:33,840
Having left Saga and moved to Tokyo, I met my wife and got married.

280
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:37,460
I got really shocked when I visited here for the first time.

281
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:38,960
I think I understand.

282
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,240
Well, but you did a great job, Naoki-kun.

283
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,980
I got all shook up, and I didn't even think about that.

284
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,180
I can share this feeling only with you.

285
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:57,650
You and I are comrades now.

286
00:18:57,650 --> 00:19:00,950
I am reluctant to share the feeling, though.

287
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:03,870
Yup ... I agree.

288
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:12,520
Finally...it's finally revealed!

289
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:15,600
Our embarrassing relatives...

290
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,480
Even though Irie-kun was the only person whom I wished
wouldn't come to know of this...

291
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:24,220
I just hope nothing more than this will happen in time to come!

292
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:29,290
1, 2, 3!

293
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:31,510
[Welcome, Irie Naoki!]

294
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,460
Hey, come on. Have some.

295
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,200
Welcome, Naoki-san.

296
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,980
Ah, thank you.

297
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:49,270
It's been some time, right Miharu-chan?

298
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:51,870
Kotoko Nee-chan, I'm Hidemi!

299
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:53,930
What? Is that so?

300
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:58,040
You're mistaken again. There isn't anybody named Miharu here.

301
00:19:58,590 --> 00:19:59,820
Oh, well ...

302
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:06,000
Kotoko-chan's had a bad memory ever since she was little.

303
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,540
How dare you say that? Uncle Jouzo,

304
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:11,220
you mistook somebody else's child for your own child at the zoo

305
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:13,780
and brought the stranger back home.

306
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:18,450
You do remember silly things like that.

307
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:20,320
It was also the child's fault.

308
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,600
She followed me without saying anything.

309
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:27,030
You're blaming a child despite your carelessness?

310
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:30,590
What a petty argument!

311
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:34,830
I wanna see him!

312
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:39,860
What are you doing, guys?

313
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:42,640
This Nii-chan is the one who married Koto-rin , isn't he?

314
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,560
He is a celebrity.

315
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:47,630
Please give me your autograph!

316
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:52,740
Hey, you guys! Irie-kun is not a celebrity.

317
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:57,500
Excuse me. May we come in?

318
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:00,640
The ladies from the Konoshiro Senior Club.

319
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,030
Look, there he is!

320
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:08,040
Here, hold this meat and noodles.

321
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,680
Oh my, he is so handsome!

322
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:14,500
So you are Kotoko-chan's husband?

323
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,270
Oh,

324
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:19,080
I have a sore throat.

325
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:23,420
Would you take a look at it?

326
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:33,290
When I see Koto-chan's husband, my chest feels very tight.

327
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:34,750
What do you think is wrong with me?

328
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:37,420
I'm first.

329
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:39,480
No, I'm the first.

330
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:52,200
Here it is!

331
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,610
This is Ecchan's album.
(Ecchan: nickname for Etsuko, Kotoko's mom)

332
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:55,010
I want to see! I want to see!

333
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:58,070
Some of the pictures are from her elementary school days.

334
00:21:58,070 --> 00:22:01,250
I haven't seen these before.

335
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:07,190
Mom?

336
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:13,620
She used to eat takoyaki from the shop on her way from school.

337
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:17,160
She said it was really yummy.

338
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,990
She looks exactly like Kotoko.

339
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:22,870
She had a mole here.

340
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,270
No, she didn't have a mole there.

341
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:30,660
Ah, but...

342
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:35,300
Look closely. That's seaweed, isn't it?

343
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,410
Seaweed?

344
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:47,890
My goodness, my mom ...

345
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:10,150
[Being punished for being late for school]

346
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:14,590
[Passionately singing her favorite songs]

347
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:15,460
Oh, Ecchan!

348
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,990
Mom!

349
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:23,740
Why are there pictures like this?

350
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:25,770
Well...

351
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:35,870
Huh!? "Miss Tonburi"?
(Kochia scoparia seed)

352
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:38,750
What in the world?

353
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:41,280
You said she was Miss Akita Komachi.
(Akita komachi: Akita beauty)

354
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,770
But Dad told me so.

355
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:47,750
She told me so.

356
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:50,350
Of course, she would have been "Miss Tonburi".

357
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:57,560
But ... actually, she was beautiful, graceful, classy, calm

358
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:01,120
and intelligent, I thought.

359
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:05,980
Ecchan was intelligent and calm?

360
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:09,390
No way!!

361
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:10,320
Uncle.

362
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:15,670
Ecchan had been restless, and her grades were among the lowest in the grade.

363
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:20,040
Her athletic ability sucked, too.

364
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:23,610
Mom ... !!!

365
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:28,850
She used to like a boy in the neighboring village.

366
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:35,180
We all made a fuss about her almost getting frozen to death waiting for him one time.

367
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:37,130
Frozen to death?

368
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:42,120
When we found her, she was half buried in the snow.

369
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:49,160
I've never seen Irie-kun laugh like this.

370
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,180
Ah, that's painful.

371
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:53,820
She was remarkably like you.

372
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:56,660
Her face and her character ... !!

373
00:24:56,660 --> 00:25:00,840
All of our family members are like this.

374
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,940
I'm going to bed!

375
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:09,920
Hey, we'll visit the grave in the morning!

376
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:12,100
I know!

377
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:14,380
Naoki-san,

378
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:16,110
let's drink.

379
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:18,510
Thank you.

380
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:33,410
Irie-kun...

381
00:25:57,370 --> 00:26:02,550
Let's see ... The first time I came here was ...

382
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:05,400
25 years ago.

383
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:08,690
But I didn't stop by (this house) every time.

384
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:11,780
That's enough.

385
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:12,930
That's good.

386
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:14,970
Sorry.

387
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:20,740
- So you met your wife when you were about 20?
- Yup.

388
00:26:22,810 --> 00:26:26,590
I was still a low-level apprentice.

389
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:29,760
She was 19, I think.

390
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:33,840
Each of us had just left our hometowns and gone to Tokyo.

391
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:40,950
When I was walking downtown, I saw a woman collapse suddenly.

392
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:43,710
Oh, my goodness.

393
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:49,480
I rushed to her and talked to her. She said she hadn't eaten for three days.

394
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:52,070
- She collapsed by the roadside, huh.
- Yeah.

395
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:55,400
If I were not there, who knows what would have happened to her?

396
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:58,460
So I thought I had to feed her something,

397
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:00,420
and I cooked a meal for her.

398
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:04,600
Then she finished one bowl of rice so fast, and asked for four more.

399
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,960
That's pretty awesome.

400
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,870
She must've been starving, but

401
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:14,100
Father, the meal must have been exceptionally delicious.

402
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,520
I wonder...

403
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:24,630
She was the first person who appreciated the food I cooked.

404
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:30,240
She looked really happy when she was eating.

405
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:36,140
Since then, she had started coming to my restaurant almost every day.

406
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:38,780
She always ate cheap meals.

407
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:43,720
She usually sat right in front of me before I knew it.

408
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:46,700
Yeah ... before I knew it.

409
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:50,190
After all, she is Kotoko's mom.

410
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:51,830
That's right.

411
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:54,360
She really loved delicious food.

412
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:57,080
But she was terrible at cooking.

413
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:00,660
How in the world could she have made such tasteless meals?

414
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:03,690
She is just like her.

415
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:10,340
I decided to feed her something good no matter what.

416
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:13,240
You fell for how she ate, didn't you?

417
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:17,320
I might have.

418
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:22,900
Naoki-kun, please keep this secret to Kotoko.

419
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,650
Oh, really?

420
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:27,340
I am kind of embarrassed.

421
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:34,710
Well, Miss Akita Komachi turned out to be Miss Tonburi ...

422
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:37,390
What a gap!

423
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:40,940
Yes, the gap is big.

424
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:45,220
Akita Komachi sounds like a beauty for sure.

425
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:49,020
But Tonburi ... it doesn't sound right.

426
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:53,250
She didn't have to lie, though.

427
00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:58,050
Your wife did a good job.

428
00:28:58,050 --> 00:29:00,550
Yes, she did.

429
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:04,980
Go ahead.

430
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:09,290
Mom.

431
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,950
Mom?

432
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:26,500
Mom...

433
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:32,030
I wonder if she slept here looking at the ceiling here.

434
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:43,220
Until now, I didn't know anything about my mom.

435
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:46,450
The little I knew about my mom, the reality of my mom

436
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:50,160
was so different from what I pictured.

437
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:55,560
Somehow, I feel a bit closer to her than before.

438
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:10,780
But, I'm surprised.

439
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:18,100
Irie-kun has been considerate of my mom.

440
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:25,670
I haven't talked about my mom with him much because I was a litte shy about it.

441
00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:28,150
I wonder why....

442
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:31,100
it's odd.

443
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:35,520
But, I was happy.

444
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:38,500
Naoki-san, what does it mean 'to strangle with floss silk'?

445
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:43,280
The floss silk is known as soft and fine-grained but also durable.

446
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:47,160
With that said, it means to torture someone gradually.

447
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:52,280
Wow, torturing gradually...I see.

448
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:57,450
Kotorin Onii-chan, I don't really get this.

449
00:31:57,450 --> 00:32:01,930
It's simple if you apply this to the quadratic formula.

450
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:07,670
You're amazing.

451
00:32:07,670 --> 00:32:11,720
If you just memorize the formula, it's pretty easy.

452
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:15,190
Kotorin Onii-chan, what is this called?

453
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:17,010
Taketori no Okina.

454
00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:20,580
Oh? Okina.

455
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:24,510
Kotorin Onii-chan, what should I put in this (space)?

456
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:25,700
"From".

457
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:28,030
Huh? Can you say it again?

458
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:30,910
"Cheese is made from milk", so...

459
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:37,300
Cheese is made from milk.

460
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:39,300
It's not "Miruku" (Japanese pronunciation), it's "milk".

461
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:41,910
Miruku.

462
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:43,330
Milk.

463
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:46,710
Irie-kun!

464
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:51,880
What is going on here, Temple School?
(Elementary school in Edo era)

465
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:57,590
Naoki-san, what does it mean 'the bad wife will ruin the farm for a hundred years'?

466
00:32:57,590 --> 00:33:02,420
That means, a husband who has a bad wife will have misfortune for life.

467
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:04,490
Ah, I see.

468
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:09,090
What are you talking about Miharu-chan?
"Bad wife?"

469
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:13,260
I told you I'm Hidemi. Don't make me repeat that, Kotoko Nee-chan!

470
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:15,210
Is that right...

471
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:19,890
Naoki-san, I want to go pick flowers with you later.

472
00:33:19,890 --> 00:33:21,000
Okay.

473
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,280
- Let's play with the RC car.
- Let's go catch some bugs.

474
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:28,850
I want to play soccer.

475
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:31,800
You guys! We need to go

476
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:34,610
to the grave!

477
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:39,570
Naoki-san! The elders in the neighborhood have been complaining with pain lately.

478
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:43,710
Would you take a look at them?

479
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:46,130
That's fine.

480
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:48,440
Irie-kun...

481
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:52,890
Here, sit here.

482
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:55,530
- Are you okay?
- Be careful.

483
00:33:56,590 --> 00:34:01,910
Ugh! There is a clinic, so why don't you go there instead?

484
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:07,140
You guys are so shameless!

485
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:10,090
Mischievous Kiss 2: Love in Tokyo

486
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:17,640
Look at the time, we're so late!

487
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:24,790
We should always go to the grave in the morning.

488
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:30,420
Kotoko-chan, unexpectedly you're old-fashioned.

489
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:34,610
You know, that's common sense!

490
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:36,380
Hey, hey, Kotoko.

491
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:40,270
I'm surprised to hear you talk about common sense.

492
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:44,120
Why are you speaking like I'm a senseless bonehead?

493
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:47,550
Hey now, it's alright.

494
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:52,690
We often go in the afternoon, but we have never been accursed.

495
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:54,700
Ecchan will never do that to us.

496
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:59,050
- I agree!
- Of course not.

497
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:01,870
I was curious since earlier, but

498
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:06,120
why are you all following us?

499
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:12,360
Don't ask why ...

500
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:15,660
We just want to visit the grave with your husband.

501
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:17,580
That's right, we want to go.

502
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:23,200
Today's the day that Irie-kun is
going to meet my mom for the first time.

503
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:28,000
Because this is really super important to me!

504
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,570
Irie-kun didn't come here to be hinderd by you all.

505
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:34,950
Hey! Kotoko!

506
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:40,250
He finally came here

507
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:42,880
to see my mom, but...

508
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:50,290
I guess, Kokoto-chan is right.

509
00:35:50,290 --> 00:35:53,760
We got carried away because we were so happy

510
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:59,520
to see Naoki-san. We are sorry.

511
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:04,040
You should spend quality time with Ecchan.

512
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:06,310
We're sorry, Kotoko.

513
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:07,790
Let's go home, everyone.

514
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:09,880
Okay, let's go.

515
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:12,780
I'm really sorry.

516
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:26,580
Your relatives...they are carefree,

517
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:32,300
overjoyed, obliging and enthusiastic.

518
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:35,950
I know, right? I'm sorry, Irie-kun.

519
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:38,670
I'm really sorry.

520
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:40,640
They're just like you.

521
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:43,740
Like me?

522
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:48,330
That's why I have fun and never get bored.

523
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:55,070
I kind of like it.

524
00:36:58,350 --> 00:37:02,450
Why don't you call them back. Let's go together

525
00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:04,980
to visit the grave.

526
00:37:13,850 --> 00:37:16,210
We're almost there, Irie-kun.

527
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:21,560
My mom's grave is over there...

528
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:25,580
What a flashy sign!

529
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:28,780
This way to Aihara Etsuko's grave

530
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:33,280
What's this?

531
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:38,670
Huh? What is it?

532
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:42,620
Miss Tonburi
The caviar from the fields

533
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:45,410
What's all this?

534
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:47,430
It's easy to find it, isn't it?

535
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:50,940
What do you mean? We have been here many time, so,

536
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:52,730
of course, we know where it is.

537
00:37:52,730 --> 00:37:54,770
This isn't for you, Kotoko-chan.

538
00:37:54,770 --> 00:37:57,730
We did this for Naoki-san, to spot it easily.

539
00:37:57,730 --> 00:37:59,790
That's a given.

540
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:03,700
Ecchan always enjoyed the festival spirit.

541
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:08,540
Thank you very much. It was easy for me to spot

542
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:10,470
Kotoko's mom's grave.

543
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:14,330
You're welcome!

544
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:20,730
Since we've arrived here safely, can we clean these up a little?

545
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:22,760
Of course, go ahead.

546
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:25,710
I'd like to sprinkle some water on the tombstone.

547
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:28,090
Take them down.

548
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:33,530
Sorry to ruin your beautiful decorations.

549
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:38,310
Oh no, this is stuck in here.

550
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:42,010
[Aihara's family grave]

551
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:54,190
Actually, Etsuko was supposed to be buried at my side of the family.

552
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:56,730
But because she passed away so soon...

553
00:38:56,730 --> 00:39:00,070
I thought she would like to be buried next to her parents,

554
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:03,090
so I decided to make Aihara's family grave here.

555
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:05,010
I see.

556
00:39:05,850 --> 00:39:10,320
When I die, I plan to be buried with Etsuko here.

557
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:14,260
So I'll leave Kotoko in your hands.

558
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:17,040
Yes.

559
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:22,050
Etsuko,

560
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:25,420
Kotoko's husband is here today.

561
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:30,820
This good looking man is too good for Kotoko, right?

562
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:34,270
Don't get too excited over him, Etsuko.

563
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:44,720
I appreciate your sincerity, but you don't have to
do all these things alright?

564
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,290
Okay!

565
00:39:46,290 --> 00:39:49,610
-Do you really understand?
-I understand!

566
00:40:13,790 --> 00:40:17,880
Mom, this is Irie-kun.

567
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:20,770
My husband.

568
00:40:20,770 --> 00:40:25,160
He came just to see you today, Mom.

569
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:29,040
He's an amazing person, right?

570
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,870
He's the person

571
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:34,750
I really, really like.

572
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:45,580
Irie-kun,

573
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:49,620
what did you wish to mom?

574
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:54,490
It's a secret between your mom and I.

575
00:41:01,330 --> 00:41:03,360
What is it?

576
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,830
Nothing~

577
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:07,930
What a weird fella.

578
00:41:07,930 --> 00:41:11,720
Shall we get souvenirs for everyone back in Tokyo later?

579
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:14,570
You really like souvenirs, don't you?

580
00:41:14,570 --> 00:41:16,840
I wonder what will be good?

581
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:21,690
Anyways, I think Tonburi is a must.

582
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:24,840
Irie-kun!

583
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:28,590
Pleased to meet you, Naoki-san.

584
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:34,660
Please take good care of Kotoko.

I'll consider it if you get into the top 100.

I remember something like this from before.
