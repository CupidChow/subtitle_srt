1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:02,820
Please take this patient to the room.

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:04,350
He has a compound fracture to his femur.

3
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:05,560
I understand.

4
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:07,380
Dr. Nishigaki!

5
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:08,650
He told us to wait.

6
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:10,020
That won't do.

7
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:12,160
If we wait any longer, it'll become dangerous.

8
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,760
But..

9
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,180
We must suture the blood vessel here.

10
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:18,090
I have to stay firm.

11
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:21,040
I can't be a hindrance to Irie-kun!

12
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,370
Mosquito clamp!

13
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:24,860
Y- Yes!

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,610
I'm sorry!

15
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:38,410
My mind is totally blank... it's over...

16
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:43,330
The patient will... Irie-kun will... all because of me...!

17
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:45,820
What should I do!?

18
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:50,820
Hey.

19
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:54,990
Stand up.

20
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:12,160
There's no choice since I can't use my hands.

21
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,310
Seriously!

22
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:15,260
What are you going to do if you get scared?

23
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:17,540
Irie-kun, aren't you scared?

24
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:18,920
That's a given.

25
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:23,430
Listen, I've patiently studied for so many years.

26
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,650
There's no way I don't have the confidence.

27
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:30,870
I'm probably better than Dr.Nishigaki.

28
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:33,940
This patient is lucky.

29
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:39,690
That's why even with just one or two of your mistakes,
I won't let this patient die.

30
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:42,880
All you have to do is to do what I say.

31
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:45,790
Yes.

32
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:49,060
If you understand, hurry up and wash your hands
and get new surgical instruments prepared.

33
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:51,000
Yes!

34
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,190
Wait, what are you doing?

35
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:00,950
Assistant Chief...

36
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:04,650
Dr.Irie, did you get Dr.Nishigaki's approval?

37
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:06,450
-No.
-What?

38
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:10,400
This patient's condition suddenly became worse, and he needed to be treated as soon as possible.

39
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:15,460
Dr.Nishigaki is in the middle of an operation and is
unable to leave, so I decided to do it.

40
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:17,070
To decide that kind of thing on you own...

41
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:18,930
Kotoko, go quickly.

42
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,900
Yes.

43
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:24,850
Even you, too, Irie-san...

44
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,700
I understand,

45
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:34,280
but I can't let Irie-san be the sole assistant.

46
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,910
I'll help as well.

47
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:38,760
Let me help you as a circulating nurse.

48
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,920
Please do.

49
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:47,060
Suddenly breathing became easier and I can properly see my surroundings.

50
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:50,210
Yes, it'll be alright.

51
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:54,030
Mosquito clamp.
-Yes.

52
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,140
Scissors.

53
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:02,230
Yes.

54
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,680
I'm going to suture the blood vessel. Give me 6-0 (suture).

55
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,660
Yes.

56
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:31,260
The operation went on magically well.

57
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:34,920
Irie-kun was operating without any hesitation.

58
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,450
Please prepare saline solution.

59
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:38,820
Yes.

60
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:42,420
Even the Assistant Chief who was uncertain at the beginning

61
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:45,620
began to trust me.

62
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:49,950
Although it's only my second time assisting in an procedure,

63
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:54,380
those words Irie-kun said so confidently

64
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:59,280
might really be correct, is what I thought.

65
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:11,270
Irie-kun...All the best!

66
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:18,730
Alright.

67
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:21,350
- Gauze.
-Yes.

68
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:29,920
It's alright now.

69
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,030
Yes.

70
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:34,620
It was a success!

71
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:37,900
Dr.Irie, good work.

72
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,390
It was an amazing procedure.

73
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:40,880
Thank you.

74
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,460
Would you please ask if an operating room is available?

75
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:45,310
Yes.

76
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:52,320
Irie-kun.

77
00:04:55,190 --> 00:05:00,230
It seems like the patient's operation ended well.

78
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:02,230
I see.

79
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:07,140
Um..Irie-kun.

80
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:11,950
It was good, wasn't it? That you succeeded with the procedure.

81
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:17,970
Irie-kun's procedure saved the patient.

82
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:20,820
Irie-kun, you were really amazing.

83
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:24,200
I'm really happy.

84
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:31,030
I..

85
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:33,370
At that time..

86
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:40,300
If it weren't for your headbutt, I might have escaped...

87
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:46,100
Being all afraid...

88
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:51,150
Not being able to do anything...

89
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:55,140
Irie-kun..

90
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:58,400
I was scared.

91
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:04,820
I was really scared, too.

92
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:10,520
But...but at that time you confidently...

93
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:16,260
I had to say that. Your mind was probably in a blank, right?

94
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:21,000
That kind of emergency patient was a first for me.

95
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:25,550
I'm surprised.

96
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,100
About what?

97
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:34,320
That even you have things you're scared of, Irie-kun.

98
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:43,090
It's great, isn't it?

99
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:45,820
The patient was saved.

100
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:54,070
It's great you became a doctor.

101
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:58,290
You're right.

Love in TOKYO

124
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:05,860
[Meeting room]

125
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:10,120
This is unheard of!
[#14: Fighting with love]

126
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,320
An intern performing an operation without guidance by a mentor.

127
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,870
It's something we would have never thought about
when we were interns!

128
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:18,770
No, even now!

129
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:25,890
Dr. Irie's mentor is Dr. Nishigaki, right?

130
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:26,680
Yes.

131
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:33,130
It's true we've heard that Dr. Irie is an outstanding intern.

132
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:35,750
But just because...

133
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:40,240
Well, although coincidentally

134
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,040
the procedure turned out fine this time,

135
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:47,280
if anything had gone wrong,

136
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:52,640
the situation would not be settled just because
an individual offers to take all the responsibility.

137
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:58,060
If we set a precedence like this,

138
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:02,200
things are going to get complicated in the future.

139
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:08,500
It's also the fault of the person who allowed him
to have such confidence, right, Dr. Nishigaki?

140
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:16,280
After all, if I had been Dr. Irie's mentor,

141
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:20,350
this wouldn't have happened.

142
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:27,390
Well, I don't think we can dismiss this issue so easily.

143
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:29,500
We have to make absolutely clear who is responsible.

144
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,550
May I know what's the problem?

145
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:36,870
The only reason I became a doctor was to help patients.

146
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:37,740
Hey!

147
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:41,320
The rules don't matter as long as I achieve that.

148
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,510
Also, the patient's condition didn't allow for a moment's delay.

149
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:51,310
Dr.Nishigaki was in the middle of another patient's operation.

150
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:56,120
Then there's no choice but for me to do it, was
what I thought.

151
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:59,030
But you still should have sought Dr. Nishigaki's judgment.

152
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:01,580
Dr. Nishigaki's patient was also in critical condition.

153
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:04,540
I couldn't have disrupted his focus at that time.

154
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:09,240
Besides, I was confident that I could save that patient.

155
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,790
That's why I did that. That's all it was.

156
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:15,220
Responsibility, punishment...

157
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:20,220
If I am to take or receive any, please don't beat
around the bush

158
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:23,280
and tell me straightforwardly.

159
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,380
What an arrogant intern you are!

160
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:31,570
Dr. Nishigaki,

161
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:35,630
how in the world are you acting as a mentor?

162
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:43,600
We need Dr. Irie to take some kind of responsibility for it, too.

163
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:47,540
Irie-kun is an outstanding doctor!

164
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,310
Saying 'intern' all the time...

165
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:58,490
Please don't make an intern out to be a newbie
who can't do anything!

166
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:00,060
Who are you?

167
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:04,840
Irie-kun is confident because he is genuinely capable.

168
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:10,340
Well ... Irie-kun might have broken rules.

169
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:13,140
But at that moment,

170
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:17,040
saving the patient who was in a critical condition
was all Irie-kun could think about!

171
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:21,080
Thanks to Irie-kun the patient was saved.

172
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:25,730
He can continue living his life.

173
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:33,560
Doctors…you doctors, are amazing, you know?

174
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:41,830
Irie-san! What are you doing!?

175
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:44,530
Doctors, I'm so sorry!

176
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:47,480
Yeah, she's really something.

177
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:53,620
Shimizu-san, what in the world is this little girl thinking?

178
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:56,070
No one's a match for her...

179
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:59,140
But doctors...

180
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:04,880
I was also assisting to Dr.Irie's procedure last night.

181
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,620
From my experience assisting in operations,

182
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:13,210
it was an amazing procedure that wouldn't have been
expected of at the level of an intern.

183
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:16,670
If not for that, I'm afraid the patient would have already...

184
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,690
Assistant Chief ...

185
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:22,740
The patient is now recovering in stable condition.

186
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:26,490
I wanted to relay just that.

187
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:29,740
Then, please excuse me.

188
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,310
Come on, we're going Irie-san!

189
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:36,110
Ah, oh excuse me.

190
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:48,230
Now, what do you think Dr.Nishigaki?

191
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:52,180
Ah, yes...

192
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:59,590
His actions were undeniably reckless...

193
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:04,350
But...in last night's case, considering his bad condition,

194
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:08,000
it wouldn't have been surprising if the patient had passed away.

195
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,030
To say he saved him...

196
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:16,860
I can't necessarily disapprove his actions.

197
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:22,280
If I had been an intern, I wouldn't have done that...

198
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,980
I see.

199
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:35,870
Well…let's leave this matter at this then, shall we?

200
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:37,900
But Professor...

201
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:45,080
Dr.Irie, despite you being young, I think your judgment
was impressive.

202
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:50,220
However, the trust between doctors and patients
have to be earned.

203
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:55,650
We can't help that patients tend to think of interns
as being inexperienced.

204
00:14:55,650 --> 00:15:01,530
We can not let the patients feel uncomfortable.
You understand this right?

205
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:03,030
Yes.

206
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:06,980
Okay, we will leave the matter at that then.

207
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:10,670
Okay, Dr. Nishigaki, please submit a letter of apology.

208
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:11,460
Huh?

209
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:15,600
Take responsibility as the mentor, alright?

210
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,090
Yes.

211
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:30,500
Seriously...

212
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,180
I am a person of good conduct, but

213
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:37,770
taking care of this arrogant intern causes me ...

214
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:41,210
If you want, I will write the letter for you.

215
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:43,280
Shut up!

216
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,880
You should behave like an intern!

217
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,690
Well, go ahead and write the letter of apology.

218
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:50,610
Oh, no! You don't have to ...

219
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:53,650
If I let you do such a thing, I will be in trouble.

220
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:12,480
- You are Sagawa-san, right?
- Ow! oh.

221
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,110
Sorry for suddenly calling out to you.

222
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:16,480
Yeah...

223
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,390
Oh, Konomi-chan.

224
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:20,110
Konomi-chan!
- Shh!

225
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:21,800
What's the matter?

226
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:25,110
-Shh!!
- This guy said he wanted to have a chat with you.

227
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:34,880
Umm...I go to Nishi High, around the next train stop. The other day, I saw you, Sagawa-san.

228
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,850
You were shopping around here, weren't you?

229
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:41,520
-Who are those boys!?
-You're loud! Be quiet!

230
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:44,310
- Ah sorry.
- You left an impression on me.

231
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:50,750
Then I had noticed you ride the same train every morning.

232
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:55,560
I thought you were cute, and became interested.

233
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,500
So...

234
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:02,680
If it's alright, I would like to go out with you.

235
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:05,240
Sagawa-san, you go to Tonan, right?

236
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,940
It's near my school, too.

237
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:10,420
If it's okay, could we meet every now and then?

238
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:15,150
Let me tell you as his friend ... this
guy is really a good person!

239
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,960
But..

240
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:22,040
Wait…this looks like a problem!

241
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:25,430
Konomi-chan is being confessed to!
What are you going to do!?

242
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:28,010
What do you mean do something... ?

243
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:31,770
Perhaps, do you have a boyfriend?

244
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:35,580
-Boyfriend…
-Sagawa-san is cute after all.

245
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:39,240
So you do have a boyfriend?

246
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,030
Boyfriend..

247
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:46,280
Say it! Say it Konomi-chan! That you have a
boyfriend named Irie Yuuki.

248
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,930
Hey!

249
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:52,040
I don't have a boyfriend.

250
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,940
Wow! Yay!

251
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:57,010
Then why don't you date this guy?

252
00:17:57,010 --> 00:18:00,520
He's a really good guy. You can start off just texting him!

253
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:04,620
But... I'm sorry.

254
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:12,910
Really, really sorry.

255
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:18,460
Oh wait! Even just your phone number ... or e-mail address!

256
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:22,160
Konomi-chan is popular isn't she...

257
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,360
Right, Yuuki-kun?

258
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,210
Yuuki-kun?

259
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:31,050
I'm going home.

260
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:33,920
Yuuki-kun!

261
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:38,800
So you hook the yarn and pull it.
[Next day]

262
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,460
That's right, pull it out...

263
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:47,200
Right, right, right. You pull it out while being careful not to make it loose.

264
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,230
Ah, ah...that doesn't look right...

265
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:57,080
At this speed I don't think I'm going to make it in time
for Valentine's Day, right?

266
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:00,260
All the best! Try again.

267
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:06,890
It seems we have another student for the impromptu knitting class for Valentine's Day.

268
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:10,600
Yes~. Come on in!

269
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,770
Hello.

270
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:17,290
I'm in your care again today.

271
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:19,800
Welcome, Konomi-chan.

272
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,820
Hey, hey, have you made progress?

273
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:24,950
Somehow...

274
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:29,360
How nice! Mine is still only this small...

275
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:37,600
Yuuki-kun, hello! Sorry for always coming over.

276
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,260
What did you come for?

277
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,570
Not much...

278
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:50,350
What? It's obvious she came to see your face!

279
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,900
So that's what it was, you wanted to see my face.

280
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:04,780
Doing something like a girlfriend would, even though
you aren't.

281
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:08,920
What a thing to say! Yuuki!

282
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:13,210
Right! Why do you have to needle her like that?

283
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,710
I'm sorry.

284
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:21,340
That's right...

285
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:28,840
You're right ... I'm not your girlfriend ...

286
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:32,000
I got ahead of myself.

287
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,300
This is weird, isn't it?

288
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,650
Sorry...

289
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,420
I'll get going.

290
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:51,120
Konomi-chan!

291
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,600
I'm sorry!

292
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,760
-Konomi-chan!?
-Konomi-chan!

293
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:02,270
What happened? Konomi-chan was crying you know.

294
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:06,220
- I knew it!
- I knew it!

295
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,780
Yes?

296
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,240
Onii-chan, do you have a minute?

297
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,750
Yeah. What is it?

298
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:02,310
Oh, well ... it's nothing special.

299
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:07,970
You don't have a night shift tonight?

300
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:09,490
No.

301
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:13,090
What's that you're studying?

302
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:15,830
About Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome.

303
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:18,890
Eh, that sounds hard.

304
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:23,630
Hey, so being a doctor ...

305
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:26,090
You have something to ask, right?

306
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:28,490
What's the matter?

307
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:32,710
Well…how do I say this...

308
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:37,970
You...

309
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:41,950
What part of Kotoko did you end up liking?

310
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:47,610
I mean, she's not a girl you would seem to end up liking.

311
00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:50,630
But when did you end up liking Kotoko?

312
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:54,610
What's wrong?

313
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:56,550
Is it about Konomi-chan?

314
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:58,430
Huh?

315
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:01,430
Well...

316
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:05,410
To think the day I would talk to you about this has come...

317
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:14,470
Well ... she had kept saying "I love you" like an incantation.

318
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:16,590
That annoyed me.

319
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:17,810
Huh?

320
00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:22,790
But thinking that it was annoying became my routine.

321
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:28,110
When I heard she would stop liking me,

322
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:30,370
I remember getting annoyed.

323
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:33,050
I am...

324
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:38,270
going to quit loving you.

325
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:45,150
The truth was, I was supposed to be relieved.

326
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:53,830
You know Kotoko can't do 90% of things I can do.

327
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:56,810
The 10% I can't do,

328
00:23:56,810 --> 00:24:01,450
things that I definitely can't accomplish, she's able to do them.

329
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:07,310
I might have gotten addicted to that.

330
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:13,990
I don't really know what's going on anymore,

331
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:18,310
about Konomi's feelings, or my own feelings.

332
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:27,930
Tutoring her, being forced to watch a movie, or going into
a cafe with her;

333
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:31,790
those times, I say that it's annoying but

334
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:35,130
did I really think so?

335
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:41,610
When I saw her being confessed to by another guy,

336
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:44,330
I got mad for some reason and

337
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:46,870
ended up saying terrible things to her.

338
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:49,770
What?

339
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:51,690
Sorry.

340
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:57,270
Just, we really are siblings,

341
00:24:57,270 --> 00:25:00,030
I fully realized it.

342
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:02,450
Huh? Realized what?

343
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:05,310
If you don't understand, ask Konomi-chan.

344
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:09,430
That's the easiest and correct thing to do.

345
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:15,810
Sorry for disturbing you. I'm going to sleep.

346
00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:23,030
Yuuki, I'll teach you something I learned from
Kinnosuke before.

347
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:26,550
According to him,

348
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:29,890
apparently it's something called 'jealousy'.

349
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:01,810
I - I'm saying this in advance,

350
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:04,890
I definitely wasn't waiting for you because it's Valentine's, alright?

351
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:07,190
It just so happened that today's Valentine's, okay?

352
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:11,310
Then why did you wait?

353
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:13,150
"Why"...

354
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:21,170
I...I'm sorry.

355
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:25,930
About that time, I'm sorry.

356
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:33,170
But you were the reason I said those things.

357
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:36,570
Me?

358
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:42,010
Because you said you didn't have a boyfriend.

359
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:49,190
That's what you said to the guy who confessed to you,
right? That why I...

360
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:51,470
How do you know that?

361
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:54,790
I just happened to pass by and saw it.

362
00:26:54,790 --> 00:27:00,010
You always say you like me and everything.

363
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:05,750
But..

364
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:09,150
I didn't have a choice.

365
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:10,510
Huh?

366
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:14,510
I…I really like you.

367
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:18,830
That hasn't changed since middle school.

368
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:23,750
But no matter how much I like you.

369
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:27,250
if you don't like me...

370
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:31,650
I can't call you my boyfriend.

371
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:37,550
It seems like I'm threatening you.

372
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:44,650
I…uhm I…I'm fine with a one-sided love.

373
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:50,610
I…but I…I do admire a mutual love, but...

374
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:58,210
Oh, that's right…perfect timing.

375
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:02,070
It's a present for Valentines.

376
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:07,270
How is it…?

377
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:25,550
It's good.

378
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:28,370
It suits you.

379
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:40,510
Ah! I…accidentally...

380
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:43,450
Accidentally...?

381
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:47,670
I didn't kiss you accidentally, alright!

382
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:51,490
It's because I like you.

383
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:54,010
Because I like you, Konomi.

384
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:59,630
That's why, if you're ever confessed to by another guy,

385
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:02,690
you have to say you have a boyfriend.

386
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:05,950
Yes.

387
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:12,350
Yes.

388
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:15,570
Don't cry.

389
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:19,010
Say it one more time?

390
00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:20,870
What?

391
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:23,070
That you like me...

392
00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:26,650
I can't say that multiple times!

393
00:29:26,650 --> 00:29:28,650
But you already said it twice...

394
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:32,590
I already said it twice! Just two times is hard enough.

395
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:43,030
Thank you.

396
00:29:58,810 --> 00:30:00,990
I'm home...

397
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:12,370
Hey, Kotoko.

398
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:15,450
If you sleep in such a place, you'll catch a cold.

399
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:21,850
Irie-kun, welcome back.

400
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:27,470
Oh, I don't know when I fell asleep.

401
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:32,010
I'm going to go take a bath, so go to sleep first.

402
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:49,430
Thanks for the hard work! Here, Irie-kun, I made coffee.

403
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:54,570
Why are you giving me coffee right before I go to bed?

404
00:30:58,670 --> 00:31:00,970
Do you want me to help you make a nursing care plan again?

405
00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:03,750
Oh, please!

406
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:05,970
Because ... because ..

407
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:10,870
No matter how many times I make plans, Assistant Chief Shimizu and Chief criticize them.

408
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:15,170
Once in a while, I want to turn in a plan that no one will complain about.

409
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:18,670
Please ... just some advice will be fine.

410
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:23,170
You can just tell me some essential points. Please~!

411
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:27,030
Seriously.

412
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:34,370
Come on, hurry up and sit.

413
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:38,800
Really? Great!

414
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:45,860
Dr.Irie, thank you very much.

415
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:48,030
Take care of yourself.

416
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:51,020
Please take good care of yourself!

417
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:09,720
You seem very exhausted.

418
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:12,210
Chief.

419
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:15,530
Yes, I've been lacking sleep lately.

420
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:16,830
Is that so?

421
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:19,530
Anyway, that's all the patients for the morning.

422
00:32:19,530 --> 00:32:21,420
Please have a good rest.

423
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:24,170
You have another operation in the afternoon, right?

424
00:32:24,170 --> 00:32:26,450
Yes. Thank you.

425
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:28,200
Oh, right. Kotoko-san,

426
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,410
she's been working hard lately.

427
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:36,030
Looks like she put in a lot of effort into the nursing care plan
that she submitted today.

428
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:38,230
Is that so?

429
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:40,630
Irie!

430
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:43,180
Irie!

431
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:45,880
Irie!

432
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,930
Where are you?

433
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:51,160
Why don't you come out, idiot?

434
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,500
Hey, Irie!

435
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:56,250
Do you know where Irie Naoki is?

436
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:57,830
Kin-chan, Chris?!

437
00:32:57,830 --> 00:33:00,510
Oh, Kotoko!

438
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:03,580
Where is Irie now?

439
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:06,930
Irie-kun should be examining patients there now, but...

440
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:08,490
What's going on here?

441
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:10,830
Such a commotion. You're in the hospital, you know?

442
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:12,340
What happened, Kinnosuke?

443
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:15,090
Irie! This is terrible!

444
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:16,950
Chris, Chris is in trouble!

445
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:19,610
Calm down. What happened?

446
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:24,310
I screwed up.

447
00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:30,090
Gauze.

448
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,990
Bandage.

449
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:46,140
The frying oil spilled on Chris!?

450
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:48,230
Yes...

451
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:51,250
The oil spilled on her legs in the kitchen.

452
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:54,640
And I completely blanked out.

453
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:58,590
I could have gone to a hospital nearby, but
before I realised it I was already here.

454
00:33:58,590 --> 00:34:01,310
I know I always speak disparagingly about Irie, but

455
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:05,630
all I thought of right then was Irie.

456
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,570
If something happened to Chris, I...

457
00:34:09,570 --> 00:34:12,490
It's alright, you were right to have her checked out by Irie-kun!

458
00:34:12,490 --> 00:34:14,880
Because Irie-kun is amazing.

459
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:17,540
I hope you are right.

460
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:22,030
Oh, Chris!

461
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:25,050
Chris, are you alright? Does it hurt?

462
00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:27,160
Just a little...

463
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:29,760
Chief, she's my friend.

464
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,750
I'll escort her.

465
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:33,360
Ok, then I'll leave her to you.

466
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:35,360
Then, husband, please come in.

467
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:38,550
Dr. Irie has something to talk to you about.

468
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:40,140
What?

469
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,310
Husband?

470
00:34:46,930 --> 00:34:50,000
Well? How is Chris?

471
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,130
I'm about to explain it to you.

472
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:55,980
So just sit… husband.

473
00:35:00,690 --> 00:35:04,230
Okay, about Chris ...

474
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:07,820
She's got a second-degree burn which went through to the dermis.

475
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:08,770
Okay ...

476
00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:13,270
The pain will probably persist for a while,
so she should be hospitalised until her condition improves.

477
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:14,950
Okay...

478
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:16,260
Regarding scars...

479
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:18,150
What?

480
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:21,180
It might scar a little.

481
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:23,860
She might have to have plastic surgery depending on the condition.

482
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:26,510
W-w-wait a minute.

483
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:28,680
To say it might leave a scar...

484
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:32,640
Chris is still unmarried, you know.

485
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:36,490
If she gets scarred like that, I don't know how to say sorry to a guy who's going to marry her.

486
00:35:36,490 --> 00:35:40,250
But aren't you going to make her your bride?

487
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:45,450
If so, then there shouldn't be a problem, right?

488
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:48,370
W-What are you saying!?

489
00:35:48,370 --> 00:35:51,980
Otherwise, do you plan on giving her to someone else?

490
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:54,190
No way!

491
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,930
I won't.

492
00:35:56,930 --> 00:35:58,630
What?

493
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:02,450
There's no way I'd do that!

494
00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:06,840
I won't give her to anyone else.

495
00:36:11,810 --> 00:36:13,580
What?

496
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:15,330
Do you have a problem?

497
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:19,440
Then, why don't you say that to Chris?

498
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:24,510
I know that...

499
00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:32,040
Take your time, Chris.

500
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:34,490
1, 2...ok.

501
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:44,290
Kotoko, you really are a nurse.

502
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:46,400
I'm impressed.

503
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,410
Is that so?

504
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:54,030
Kin-chan was amazing earlier, carrying you.

505
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:56,630
I've never seen Kin-chan like that.

506
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:58,790
He was more flustered than I was.

507
00:36:58,790 --> 00:37:03,170
Well, he gets flustered really easily. Well, I'm the same way, though ...

508
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:08,410
You must be very important to Kin-chan.

509
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:10,560
You think so?

510
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,930
How are you feeling, Chris?

511
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:13,200
See!

512
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,270
Kinnosuke.

513
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:15,870
Are you okay? Does it hurt?

514
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:19,630
It's alright, the painkillers are starting to work.

515
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:23,320
Oh, by the way, what did Irie say?

516
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:27,190
If you leave it for a few days, it should be fine.

517
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:31,540
Oh, will there be a mark left?

518
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:33,330
Don't worry,

519
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:35,460
I told him to take care of it.

520
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:38,120
If he leaves a scar on you, he will get a good beating by me.

521
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,420
Kin-chan!

522
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:41,480
You don't need to worry about anything Chris.

523
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,780
Irie and Kotoko are both here.

524
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:45,790
I'm coming to see you every day, too.

525
00:37:45,790 --> 00:37:47,680
Okay.

526
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:51,060
Kin-chan...

527
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:55,440
Suzuki-san in Room 205 took a painkiller at 15:00.

528
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,270
Please check whether she has any pain after taking the medication.

529
00:37:58,270 --> 00:38:00,590
Okay, I understand.

530
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:06,090
Then, I'll be leaving first!

531
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:08,990
Thank you for the hard work!
-Thanks for the hard work!

532
00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:12,030
Ah, I'm so hungry.

533
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:14,880
Bye.
-See you.

534
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,550
Okay, I'll be on a night shift.

535
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:20,100
It's bad for the skin, isn't it?

536
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:21,050
Oh, Irie-san.

537
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:23,020
Oh, Chief! I'll get going first.

538
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:24,170
Thanks for the hard work.

539
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:28,710
Oh, by the way, has Dr.Irie seem tired at home lately?

540
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:31,010
Is there something wrong with Irie-kun?

541
00:38:31,010 --> 00:38:34,800
Dr.Irie has been busy with large surgeries, right?

542
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:38,640
It doesn't seem like he's been getting much sleep lately.

543
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:46,390
The nursing care plan is "to discuss a pain management method with a doctor."

544
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:54,520
As for today, he had to take care of the emergency patient right after he finished working at the outpatient clinic.

545
00:38:54,520 --> 00:39:00,220
Then it was the operation right after, so he
probably didn't get to eat.

546
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:03,680
It also seems like the operation's going to take a long time.

547
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:08,840
Irie-san, although you're also working and it must be difficult,

548
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:13,320
please also take good care of Dr. Irie's nutrition and health.

549
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:18,910
Precisely because the job of a doctor is harsh on both physical and mental health,

550
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:23,690
and you are a doctor's wife.

551
00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:27,140
Yes. Thank you.

552
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:36,590
Speaking of which...I'm doing nothing lately.

553
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:40,160
Leaving all the cleaning and cooking to mother,

554
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:45,130
and making my husband who already lacks sleep
stay up all night...

555
00:39:49,370 --> 00:39:55,190
It's already over 6 hours since Irie-kun entered
the operating room...

556
00:39:58,070 --> 00:40:00,390
Alright!

557
00:40:04,370 --> 00:40:06,710
Woah, amazing!

558
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:10,070
Kotoko-chan, what's with all these?

559
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:12,770
It seems like Irie-kun's operation is going to
take a long time today.

560
00:40:12,770 --> 00:40:17,220
I was thinking that I should bring him a bento
filled with nutritious food.

561
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:19,320
Wow.

562
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,240
Amazing!

563
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:24,190
Onii-chan will be really happy!

564
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:27,050
Is that so?

565
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:32,320
Wait for me, Irie-kun.

566
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:35,830
I've made lots of delicious food!

567
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:41,840
Irie-kun!

568
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:44,140
You finished the operation, right? You worked well.

569
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:50,940
Well...well, actually, I was hoping you'd eat this for me...

570
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,470
Irie-kun..

571
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:10,790
Irie-kun?

572
00:41:12,190 --> 00:41:14,180
Irie-kun?

573
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:18,390
Hey, Irie-kun?

574
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:21,070
Hey, Irie-kun?

575
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:25,380
Hey! Irie-kun!

576
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:27,000
Hey! Irie-kun!!

577
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,010
Irie-kun! Hey!

578
00:41:30,010 --> 00:41:33,250
Irie-kun..! Irie-kun!

579
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:36,190
Wake up!

580
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,270
[#15: Proposal of tears]
Because of me...

581
00:43:05,270 --> 00:43:08,320
Onii-chan is so clumsy.

582
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:11,090
You should have somersaulted and then landed.

583
00:43:11,090 --> 00:43:13,880
Because I'm the nurse in-charge of Irie-kun!

584
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:16,170
-Don't fumble about with the needle!
-Tada!

585
00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:19,700
It stinks of garlic!
-It tastes horrible.

586
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:21,020
Em...Can I have a few words with you?

587
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:24,070
I was wondering...how did you propose to Kotoko?

588
00:43:24,070 --> 00:43:28,360
I just decided to. In front of our parents.
I knew the answer anyway. Is it helpful?

589
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:29,710
No way!

590
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:34,360
Won't you break up with Irie...and marry Kinnosuke?
