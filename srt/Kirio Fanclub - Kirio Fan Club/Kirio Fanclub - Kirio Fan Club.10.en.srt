Me and Aimi said they were dazzling →

11
00:01:09,103 --> 00:01:12,506
Do you know why?

12
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:18,512
That's because you were there.

13
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:20,347
(Kirio) What is that?

14
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:23,417
It has nothing to do with me, does it? (Wave) It's not irrelevant at all!

15
00:01:23,484 --> 00:01:26,587
(Kirio) Did Miyoshi see me at the hospital?

About Kirio-kun!

21
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:42,169
Kirio-kun is actually a kind person.

(Kirio) That's what it is... (Wave) Kirio-kun →

23

24
00:01:46,807 --> 00:01:49,810
(Aimi) Hay fever is dangerous and tends to cause nosebleeds.

25
00:01:49,877 --> 00:01:51,645
(Wave) I'm going to use strange stamps.

26
00:01:51,712 --> 00:01:54,081

00:01:54,148 --> 00:01:57,651
(Nami) Aimi-chan That's a fantasy. (Aimi) That's right.

28
00:01:57,718 --> 00:02:00,788
(Waves) When drinking juice, I chew on the straw.

29
00:02:00,855 --> 00:02:03,190
(Aimi) Health: Where you are worried and get a message

30
00:02:03,257 --> 00:02:06,160
(Wave) The casual clothes are completely "just right."

31
00:02:06,227 --> 00:02:08,129
(Aimi) The same thing that makes you laugh.

32
00:02:08,195 --> 00:02:11,699
(White) Actually, I'm not that good at soccer.

That's why Kirio-kun...

37
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:25,846
I want you to laugh.

38
00:02:27,815 --> 00:02:31,318
(Nozomi) Ken-kun should laugh.

39
00:02:32,453 --> 00:02:36,090
(Aimi) Yes, it's okay to cry.

40
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:39,493
Crying, laughing, laughing, crying.

41
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,862
Crying, laughing...

42
00:02:41,929 --> 00:02:44,732
I hope it becomes like that.

43
00:02:44,798 --> 00:02:46,934

49
00:03:02,616 --> 00:03:04,418
(Aimi) Oh, that's good!

50
00:03:04,485 --> 00:03:06,120
The joke is probably the Dragon!

51
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:09,657
(Wave) It's going to do it, so let's make you laugh! (Aimi) Oh!

52
00:03:09,723 --> 00:03:13,661
(Shora) Excuse me, I thought this was crazy.

53
00:03:13,727 --> 00:03:16,363

00:10:59,192 --> 00:11:02,095
(♪～)

175
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:05,565
(♪~) <Delicious Kirio-kun>

176
00:11:05,632 --> 00:11:08,802
(♪~) <I like you>

177
00:11:08,869 --> 00:11:11,872
<<That means →

178
00:11:11,938 --> 00:11:13,640
It was a lie≫

179
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,947
(Mizuki) Isn't that Someya-san? (Mao) Eh.

180
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:22,783
Why does Someya-san take Ekoma?

181
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:25,819
(Mizuki) He's smart so he can go even higher. (Mao) Hey.

182
00:11:25,886 --> 00:11:28,822
If you could even take the exam to Someya, the magnification would be awful.

183
00:11:28,889 --> 00:11:33,160
(Mizuki) I've increased the number of cram schools, but if I fail after this...

184
00:11:33,226 --> 00:11:34,861
Hmm...

185
00:11:34,928 --> 00:11:38,999
(Waves of junior high school students) I wonder if all of my middle school children will fall.

186
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:45,705
(Wave) <Ah, wait>

187
00:11:45,772 --> 00:11:47,607
<<Abdominal pain>

188
00:11:47,674 --> 00:11:52,779
<My stomach hurts, I feel like I'm incredibly gross...I want to cry>

189
00:11:52,846 --> 00:11:54,781
(Aimi, a junior high school student) Um.

190
00:11:54,848 --> 00:11:58,485
My face is amazing. OK?

191
00:11:58,552 --> 00:12:01,521
(Waves) My stomach hurts a little.

192
00:12:01,588 --> 00:12:05,392
But it's okay. (Aimi) Ah...Is that so?

193
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:09,396
(Wave) <What is this girl>

194
00:12:09,463 --> 00:12:12,933
<<In this state, you can be approached by someone you don't know>

195
00:12:12,999 --> 00:12:14,701
<No way>

196
00:12:14,768 --> 00:12:17,137
(Aimi) Ah, sorry, is that a bit of a helping hand?

197
00:12:17,204 --> 00:12:18,839
(Wave) What? Huh?

198
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:22,509
(Aimi) Here's a pain point that works for diarrhea.

199
00:12:23,844 --> 00:12:28,648
(Wave) <Eh... Isn't it better if your rival normally has diarrhea? ≫

200
00:12:28,715 --> 00:12:32,085
<Ah>

201
00:12:32,152 --> 00:12:35,355
<<You thought you were a fellow diarrhea...? ≫

202
00:12:39,126 --> 00:12:43,029
>> "The sound of kicking a big stone"

203
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:45,098
(Wave) Ah... >> "The sound of kicking a big stone"

204
00:12:45,165 --> 00:12:49,569
(Wave) Even though I'm in my third year of junior high school, I'm kicking a huge stone.

205
00:12:49,636 --> 00:12:54,841
>> "The sound of kicking a big stone"

206
00:12:54,908 --> 00:13:00,113
(Nami) <Aimi-chan has since passed the same high school>

207
00:13:01,915 --> 00:13:05,218
<Even after enrolling →

208
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:08,255
I've been watching you forever≫

209
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:12,292
(Tanaka) Congratulations to all 2nd Class 6th Class on their promotion.

210
00:13:12,359 --> 00:13:14,728
I'll now distribute my career path preferences.

211
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:17,430
(Wave) <Become in the same class in second grade>

212
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:21,801
<I noticed>

213
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:28,675
<Who is Aimi looking?>

214
00:13:31,411 --> 00:13:34,080
Is that what it is...

215
00:13:41,555 --> 00:13:44,825
(Wave) <This is my determination>

216
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:55,235
(Wave) Hey, Miyoshi-san.

217
00:13:57,704 --> 00:14:01,975
(Aimi) Ah, um, Someya? (Wave) That's all.

218
00:14:02,042 --> 00:14:04,978
Miyoshi-san, what do you do?

219
00:14:05,045 --> 00:14:07,247
If Kirio-kun is →

220
00:14:07,314 --> 00:14:10,317
I turned the skin on my heels and stored them in a bottle.

221
00:14:10,383 --> 00:14:12,919
(Aimi) Huh? Ah? Huh?

222
00:14:12,986 --> 00:14:16,890
(Nami) Miyoshi likes Kirio-kun, doesn't he?

223
00:14:18,925 --> 00:14:22,629
Wow...I guess that's what I do too.

224
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:25,632
(Aimi) Oh, ok.

225
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:29,502
(Wave) So how much Miyoshi-san →

226
00:14:29,569 --> 00:14:33,240
I wanted to know if he likes Kirio-kun.

227
00:14:33,306 --> 00:14:38,945
When Kirio-kun flips the skin on his heel and stores it in a bottle →

228
00:14:39,012 --> 00:14:41,548
I wonder what I think.

229
00:14:42,782 --> 00:14:46,052
(Aimi) That's... put it in the safe instead of a bottle →

230
00:14:46,119 --> 00:14:50,056
I'm sure I'll give you advice.

231
00:14:50,123 --> 00:14:53,994
(Waves) Right?

232
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:57,330
After all, it's true, Miyoshi-san.

233
00:14:57,397 --> 00:15:01,268
No, Aimi-chan.

234
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:14,948
(Wave) From today →

235
00:15:15,015 --> 00:15:17,183
It's Kirio fan club.

236
00:15:21,354 --> 00:15:23,857
(Wave) <Aimi-chan>

237
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:28,728
≪You're so much more interesting than anyone else →

More messy than anyone else →

239
00:15:31,831 --> 00:15:36,303
He was much more kinder than anyone else.

240
00:15:36,369 --> 00:15:38,772
<<Even if you say anything in your mouth →

241
00:15:38,838 --> 00:15:42,142
In the end, it's honest and straightforward.

242
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:45,779
<Me, Aimi-chan is that>

243
00:15:48,081 --> 00:15:50,150
<I love you>

244
00:15:52,052 --> 00:15:54,387
<I thought that at that time>

245
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:59,559
<<I think this time should last forever>

246
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:03,797
<But that's over now>

247
00:16:03,863 --> 00:16:07,934
<Because I was prepared>

248
00:16:08,001 --> 00:16:11,805
<I'll do anything for the person I like>

249
00:16:11,871 --> 00:16:17,077

<Not available>

252
00:16:28,922 --> 00:16:33,026
(Aimi) I love Kirio-kun.

253
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:37,797
So with me...

254
00:16:42,369 --> 00:16:45,905
(Aimi) No, with us.

255

Wow, waves! (White) Aimi...

259

(Aimi) I think it was revealed in the song earlier, but →

260
00:17:02,422 --> 00:17:05,558
We've always loved Kirio-kun!

261
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:07,627
And then! Always together →

262
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:10,196

So if you like, then just go for it from now on.

It's so hard≫

273

But it's about falling in love with others.

(Aimi) That's fine now, just touch the eraser.

(Kirio) Let's go Mitsuda.

282
