1
00:00:04,405 --> 00:00:07,308
(Mitsuda) Nsan Esaki Hesacodon San Esaki Hesacodo.

2
00:00:07,375 --> 00:00:09,777
Nsan Esaki Hesacodon San Esaki Hesacodo.

3
00:00:09,844 --> 00:00:12,079
Nsan Esaki Hesacodon San Esaki Hesacodo.

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:18,252
Nsan Esaki Hesacodon San Esaki Hesacodo.

5
00:00:20,788 --> 00:00:25,359
Ha... it's over... what do you think?

6
00:00:25,426 --> 00:00:28,329
Have you lost your memory?

7
00:00:29,864 --> 00:00:32,867
(Aimi) It's still there... ahhhh.

8
00:00:32,933 --> 00:00:36,804
>> Sorry I'm new to this kind of magic...

9
00:00:36,871 --> 00:00:40,875
I mean, "I want to erase my memories"...

10
00:00:40,941 --> 00:00:43,511
Was there something?

11
00:00:43,577 --> 00:00:48,649
(Wave) Yesterday, I got into an argument with Kirio-kun.

12
00:00:48,716 --> 00:00:50,918
>> An argument with Kirio?

13
00:00:50,985 --> 00:00:54,288
That means... it's a relationship that allows you to fight!

14
00:00:54,355 --> 00:00:58,025
That's good, isn't it? (Wave) There's no way it's okay... Ah!

15
00:00:58,092 --> 00:01:00,828
Aimi-chan... Aimi-chan!

16
00:01:03,497 --> 00:01:05,366
That's it →

17
00:01:05,433 --> 00:01:09,136
That was the feeling...

18
00:01:09,203 --> 00:01:12,273
>> But why are you in an argument?

19
00:01:12,339 --> 00:01:15,676
(Wave) On the way home from school, with Aimi's grandpas →

20
00:01:15,743 --> 00:01:18,746
I played soccer on the riverbank. >>Huh?

21
00:01:20,047 --> 00:01:22,817
(Wave) Then Kirio-kun →

22
00:01:22,883 --> 00:01:24,752
"It's not fun"...

23
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:29,623
>> Did you say it's not fun? Kirio-san.

24
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:32,526
(Wave) Yes, "The two seem to be having fun, but →

25
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:35,763
I'm not having fun."

26
00:01:36,964 --> 00:01:39,900
>> That's a lie. (Wave) What a lie... →

27
00:01:39,967 --> 00:01:41,836
Mitsuda-kun, what does that mean?

28
00:01:41,902 --> 00:01:44,672
>> I was thinking of staying quiet...

29
00:01:44,738 --> 00:01:47,775
Kirio-san, I told me before.

30
00:01:47,842 --> 00:01:50,411
Looking at you →

31
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:53,781
"It's painful because you're probably thinking it's fun."

32
00:01:53,848 --> 00:01:56,283
(Wave) What... >> What do you mean, that is... →

33
00:01:56,350 --> 00:02:00,955
It was a way of saying that it suppressed the feeling of fun.

34
00:02:01,021 --> 00:02:04,024
He also said, "It's dazzling and painful because we're friends."

35
00:02:05,893 --> 00:02:09,163
(Aimi) What did you do...

36
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:13,300
What did I do to Kirio-kun...

37
00:02:13,367 --> 00:02:15,336
>> Miyoshi-san...

38
00:02:15,402 --> 00:02:17,738
(White) Aimi-chan?

39
00:02:19,006 --> 00:02:21,308
(Aimi) Wave... sorry.

40
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:23,911
I was lying...

41
00:02:23,978 --> 00:02:29,750
This is the story I mentioned before about how I fell in love with Kirio-kun.

42
00:02:29,817 --> 00:02:32,620
(Waves) They said they picked up an eraser.

43
00:02:32,686 --> 00:02:35,856
(Aimi) That's a lie.

44
00:02:35,923 --> 00:02:39,426
Actually, I've known Kirio-kun for a long time →

45
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:43,230
I had fallen in love with Kirio-kun before.

46
00:02:45,466 --> 00:02:49,069
(Wave) Why didn't you tell the truth?

47
00:02:50,171 --> 00:02:52,306
(Aimi) There was no way I could say it.

48
00:02:54,275 --> 00:02:57,444
I saw Kirio-kun just before he was enrolled →

49
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:00,147
Completely at first glance →

50
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:04,218
The reason I fell in love with him was Kirio-kun's smile.

51
00:03:05,152 --> 00:03:09,890
But Kirio-kun's precious friend dies →

52
00:03:09,957 --> 00:03:15,029
That smile has disappeared... →

53
00:03:15,095 --> 00:03:17,464
There was no way I could say it.

54
00:03:19,066 --> 00:03:24,071
(Wave) Perhaps the lyrics to the song that licks tears.

55
00:03:24,138 --> 00:03:26,173
>> What lyrics?

56
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:30,611
(Wave) I see, Aimi-chan is always →

57
00:03:30,678 --> 00:03:32,880
He wanted to make Kirio-kun smile.

58
00:03:32,947 --> 00:03:36,550
(Aimi) Hehe... you're stupid.

59
00:03:36,617 --> 00:03:39,954
It all had backfired, but he didn't realize it.

60
00:03:41,422 --> 00:03:43,223
Hey Mitsuda.

61
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:46,193
After all, I don't have to erase my memory.

62
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:51,765
Instead, please change it to the world line where Kirio-kun's friend lives.

63
00:03:51,832 --> 00:03:54,401
>> No, he's not a god.

64
00:03:54,468 --> 00:03:58,806
And if that were possible, if the world line changed →

65
00:03:58,872 --> 00:04:03,444
Miyoshi-san, I wonder if you won't be able to meet Kirio-san?

66
00:04:06,714 --> 00:04:08,782
(Aimi) That's fine.

67
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:12,319
If that doesn't mean Kirio-kun won't hurt →

68
00:04:12,386 --> 00:04:14,989
That's fine.

69
00:04:15,055 --> 00:04:19,960
I wish I hadn't met Kirio-kun...

70
00:04:20,027 --> 00:04:21,996
If I don't meet Kirio-kun →

71
00:04:22,062 --> 00:04:24,732
He didn't hurt Kirio-kun either...

72
00:04:24,798 --> 00:04:28,469
(White) Aimi... >> Miyoshi-san.

73
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:30,704
Are you an idiot?

74
00:04:33,207 --> 00:04:36,210
That's too self-conscious.

75
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:39,146
(White) No, Mitsuda-kun... (Aimi) Mitsuda What does that mean?

76
00:04:39,213 --> 00:04:42,349
>> Even if I don't meet you, Kirio's friend is dead →

77
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:45,786
It remains that Kirio is on the verge of sadness.

78
00:04:45,853 --> 00:04:50,557
Either way, Kirio-san can't laugh.

79
00:04:51,558 --> 00:04:55,496
(Aimi) What is it Mitsuda You! >> Because that's the case!

80
00:04:55,562 --> 00:04:59,366
No matter how you do it, time can't be turned back.

81
00:05:03,537 --> 00:05:07,641
If I don't meet, I'll be me.

82
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:10,878
He's really selfish as far as he goes.

83
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,016
but.

84
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:19,219
For you like that...

85
00:05:19,286 --> 00:05:21,822
no.

86
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:24,625
To you like that →

87
00:05:24,692 --> 00:05:26,927
I was saved.

88
00:05:29,063 --> 00:05:32,866
From the beginning, he was incredibly selfish →

89
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:35,636
We are our top priority

90
00:05:35,703 --> 00:05:39,707
"Do that and do this" "I want to do that and do this" →

91
00:05:39,773 --> 00:05:42,142
How many times have you been caught up in it?

92
00:05:43,177 --> 00:05:44,945
But →

93
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:47,047
Even though it's selfish →

94
00:05:47,114 --> 00:05:48,916
That's how I stepped in with my shoes →

95
00:05:48,982 --> 00:05:52,886
The crowbar on the door that had been closed was opened →

96
00:05:52,953 --> 00:05:56,423
It was your first time.

97
00:05:58,492 --> 00:06:00,427
As I said before →

98
00:06:00,494 --> 00:06:03,230
Time cannot be reversed and the past cannot be changed.

99
00:06:03,297 --> 00:06:05,199
But →

100
00:06:05,265 --> 00:06:07,067
Just one →

101
00:06:07,134 --> 00:06:09,803
There's something you can do.

102
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:15,309
(Aimi) What can we do...?

103
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,411
>> It's about changing the future.

104
00:06:17,478 --> 00:06:20,514
Like you did to me.

105
00:06:20,581 --> 00:06:23,517
Take it to Kirio-san, who has lost his precious friend →

106
00:06:23,584 --> 00:06:25,552
What impact will you guys have? →

107
00:06:25,619 --> 00:06:28,188
I don't know.

108
00:06:28,255 --> 00:06:32,459
But I →

109
00:06:32,526 --> 00:06:36,363
I want to believe that you guys can save Kirio.

110
00:06:43,804 --> 00:06:47,141
You guys might be awkward guys.

111
00:06:47,207 --> 00:06:52,079
But there's no other.

112
00:06:52,146 --> 00:06:55,182
You're such a friend →

113
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:57,618
Those who are encouraging.

114
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:04,892
(Aimi) Mitsuda Suddenly, he spoke casually.

115
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:09,696
>> Ah, ah... Really you.

116
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:12,299
That's really what it is.

117
00:07:12,366 --> 00:07:14,535
Hmm, I'm so annoying, really.

118
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:16,937
Be kind and get carried away!

119
00:07:17,004 --> 00:07:19,840
(Aimi) Sorry, this atmosphere is combined with →

120
00:07:19,907 --> 00:07:22,209
I couldn't help but touch it.

121
00:07:22,276 --> 00:07:27,014
Also, the feeling of the protagonist suddenly seems like a terrible thing, isn't it?

122
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:31,185
But thank you Mitsuda.

123
00:07:31,251 --> 00:07:34,254
I think so too.

124
00:07:34,321 --> 00:07:38,859
He's glad he became friends with Mitsuda.

125
00:07:38,926 --> 00:07:42,029
The waves too! (Wave) Yes of course!

126
00:07:43,163 --> 00:07:45,632
>> Hmm!

127
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:48,635
(Aimi) Okay, thanks to that, I made up my mind.

128
00:07:48,702 --> 00:07:50,637
Mitsuda A while ago →

129
00:07:50,704 --> 00:07:53,173
He said that in the future it could be changed.

130
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,875
>> Yes.

131
00:07:54,942 --> 00:07:58,011
(Aimi) Me, Kirio-kun...

132
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:04,017
Create a world that is free from all suffering and sorrow!

133
00:08:08,422 --> 00:08:11,992
>> No, I'm not in the wrong direction...

134
00:08:14,294 --> 00:08:31,245
(♪～)

135
00:08:31,311 --> 00:08:48,262
(♪～)

136
00:08:48,328 --> 00:08:52,966
(♪～)

137
00:08:53,967 --> 00:08:56,937
(Tanaka) Now let's check the meaning of the words.

138
00:08:57,004 --> 00:09:00,173
"consumerism" is consumerism.

139
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:07,447
Since it is a singular noun, the verb is the third person singular form "is".

140
00:09:07,514 --> 00:09:10,884
"encouraged" is encouraged.

141
00:09:10,951 --> 00:09:15,088
You are in passive voice with "are encouraged."

142
00:09:15,155 --> 00:09:20,193
｢more goods and services than
they truly need｣は→

143
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:22,829
Comparison syntax.

144
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:26,566
So, can someone translate it?

145
00:09:26,633 --> 00:09:30,837
Um, then Inoue.

146
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:33,206
Please translate it into Japanese.

147
00:09:51,658 --> 00:09:55,996
(Aimi) Wow!

148
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:07,507
(Wave) It's already a week, Kirio-kun is no longer coming to school.

149
00:10:07,574 --> 00:10:09,209
(Aimi) Yes...

150
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:14,281
(Wave) I'll read it as it is... I think it's safe.

151
00:10:14,348 --> 00:10:17,818
(Aimi) That's right, I'm in the same situation too.

152
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:21,722
wave. (Wave) Huh?

153
00:10:21,855 --> 00:10:24,391
(Aimi) There's a photo taken by Nami the other day, right?

154
00:10:24,758 --> 00:10:26,793
(Wave) Which photo...?

155
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:30,998
(Aimi) This is it. (Wave) Ah, this is "lol"

156
00:10:31,064 --> 00:10:33,900
(Aimi) This →

157
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:37,404
You can send it to Kirio-kun. (Wave) What?

158
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:40,140
(Aimi) So if Kirio-kun laughs →

159
00:10:40,207 --> 00:10:42,309
You can send it.

160
00:10:42,376 --> 00:10:44,911
(Nami) But Aimi-chan said she definitely shouldn't send it.

161
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:48,148
It's just the two of them secrets.

162
00:10:48,215 --> 00:10:52,719
(Aimi) It's true that this will be drawn before you laugh.

163
00:10:54,588 --> 00:10:57,457
If it's like this →

164
00:10:57,524 --> 00:10:59,659
Let's go and see Kirio-kun. (Wave) What?

165
00:10:59,726 --> 00:11:01,428
(Aimi) Mitsuda said that, but →

166
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:03,497
There's nothing we can do without meeting you, right?

167
00:11:03,563 --> 00:11:06,500
(Nami) But... I don't know Kirio-kun's address.

168
00:11:06,566 --> 00:11:10,203
(Aimi) That's fine as long as you can tell me.

169
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:14,975
(Tanaka) What is the address of the student who can't teach you?

170
00:11:15,042 --> 00:11:17,277
(Wave) Why? >> Ah, sorry.

171
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:20,180
That's the rule.

172
00:11:20,247 --> 00:11:23,150
(Aimi) That's it... >> And what is Kirio →

173
00:11:23,216 --> 00:11:26,686
I'm in touch so don't worry.

174
00:11:26,753 --> 00:11:30,991
Many students tend to take time off during the exam season.

175
00:11:31,058 --> 00:11:35,028
(Aimi) That's fine now! This national civil servant!

176
00:11:35,095 --> 00:11:38,799
(Wave) Excuse me! (Tanaka) Miyoshi!

177
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:46,173
(Tanaka) What a way to talk to the teacher...

178
00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:52,412
Teachers are not national civil servants, but local civil servants...

179
00:11:52,479 --> 00:11:54,147
(Female Teacher) Mr. Tanaka.

180
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:56,149
I've got a call from No. 2.

181
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:58,251
From Kirio Ken.

182
00:11:58,318 --> 00:12:00,887
(Tanaka) Ah thank you very much

183
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:06,560
hello? Oh.

184
00:12:06,626 --> 00:12:08,361
Kirio Are you okay?

185
00:12:08,428 --> 00:12:12,432
Yes, it's the date for the interview...

186
00:12:12,499 --> 00:12:15,368
(Aimi) It might not be good.

187
00:12:15,435 --> 00:12:19,906
I always felt like I had understood Kirio-kun.

188
00:12:19,973 --> 00:12:23,210
But in reality, Kirio-kun's address is also →

189
00:12:23,276 --> 00:12:25,078
Kirio-kun's feelings too →

190
00:12:25,145 --> 00:12:27,848
I didn't know anything

191
00:12:29,983 --> 00:12:32,586
Kirio-kun said exactly.

192
00:12:32,652 --> 00:12:34,754
I... →

193
00:12:34,821 --> 00:12:38,125
Even though he doesn't know anything, he's irresponsible.

194
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:45,065
The waves said to me before, "It's fine to stick with Kirio-kun" →

195
00:12:45,132 --> 00:12:47,701
I've said something but...

196
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:52,205
I'm like this, let alone be attached to Kirio... →

197
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:55,675
He's just a nuisance.

198
00:12:55,742 --> 00:12:57,410
(White) Aimi...

199
00:12:57,477 --> 00:12:59,980
(Aimi) The Nami is actually Kirio-kun...

200
00:13:00,046 --> 00:13:02,115
(Wave) Why are you saying that?

201
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:09,389
(Wave) I know.

202
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:13,894
Aimi jumps over responsibility, irresponsibility, and so on →

203
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:17,397
I really love Kirio-kun.

204
00:13:19,332 --> 00:13:22,502
I know, I was trying to record Kirio-kun's smell →

205
00:13:22,569 --> 00:13:26,139
He even took a deep breath as he passed by, then blocked his nose and almost died.

206
00:13:29,609 --> 00:13:31,344
(Aimi) Phaaa!

207
00:13:31,411 --> 00:13:34,214
Hey, why did you get it? (Wave) So →

208
00:13:34,281 --> 00:13:37,083
How much Aimi thinks about Kirio-kun →

209
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:40,387
I know forever...

210
00:13:43,089 --> 00:13:44,758
Always →

211
00:13:44,825 --> 00:13:46,993
Because I was watching it by my side.

212
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:50,997
(Aimi) I was watching it by my side...

213
00:13:53,767 --> 00:13:55,435
Of course, we'll be together every day...

214
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:57,671
(Seirah's voice) Wow! ! !

215
00:13:57,737 --> 00:13:59,539
(Aimi) What?

216
00:13:59,606 --> 00:14:02,909
>> Kirio-senpai to school tomorrow at 6pm!

217
00:14:02,976 --> 00:14:06,413
(Aimi) What? >> Tomorrow, 6pm Kirio Senpai, attending school interview

218
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:09,015
(Wave) What? Suddenly, what...?

219
00:14:09,082 --> 00:14:12,752
Or rather, is it a soccer club manager?

220
00:14:12,819 --> 00:14:16,356
>>Huh! It's dangerously recognized, I can't die.

221
00:14:16,423 --> 00:14:18,325
Yes, that's right.

222
00:14:18,391 --> 00:14:21,828
Please listen without asking anything I've heard everything up until now.

223
00:14:21,895 --> 00:14:24,531
sorry! (Aimi) What... what?

224
00:14:24,598 --> 00:14:26,233
(Wave) Close...scary...

225
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:28,068
(Aimi) I mean, Kirio-kun doesn't know what's wrong...

226
00:14:28,134 --> 00:14:32,305
>> I just learned that Kirio-senpai will go to school tomorrow and have an interview.

227
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:34,674
(Wave) What, but why...

228
00:14:34,741 --> 00:14:37,510
>> Because I've heard everything. (Aimi) So, what do you think?

229
00:14:37,577 --> 00:14:40,013
>> Everything so far.

230
00:14:41,414 --> 00:14:44,618
Last week's story of Aimi-senpai at the chemistry room →

231
00:14:44,684 --> 00:14:48,822
I think I probably understand what Kirio-senpai means...

232
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:51,958
So, Kirio-senpai doesn't go "that" →

233
00:14:52,025 --> 00:14:54,361
I have to do something about it. So →

234
00:14:54,427 --> 00:14:57,530
He sneaks into the staff room in an attempt to obtain information about Kirio-senpai...

235
00:14:57,597 --> 00:14:59,933
(Wave) I understand. (Aimi) Do you understand?

236
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,704
(Wave) I understand but... why would you tell us that?

237
00:15:04,771 --> 00:15:07,841
>> That's what's decided, right?

238
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,809
I….

239
00:15:10,977 --> 00:15:12,746
While knowing, I have the power to take action →

240
00:15:12,812 --> 00:15:16,016
Because he's the type of high-quality otaku who is most useful!

241
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:20,553
(Aimi) What? I'm sorry.

242
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:24,190
It didn't come in at all because creepy fear was the winner.

243
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:26,026
Let's talk a little more from the beginning...

244
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:28,428
(Wave) Movement….

245
00:15:28,495 --> 00:15:31,097
That's right. (Aimi) What a wave?

246
00:15:31,164 --> 00:15:33,833
(Wave) You should take action, right? (Aimi) Scary and scary What's the waves too?

247
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:36,936
(Nami) Aimi-chan... Let's meet Kirio-kun tomorrow.

248
00:15:37,003 --> 00:15:39,406
This opportunity cannot be missed.

249
00:15:39,472 --> 00:15:43,977
So Aimi-chan has one idea.

250
00:15:44,044 --> 00:15:45,745
(Aimi) Ideas? >> Ideas?

251
00:15:45,812 --> 00:15:50,917
(Wave) Oh...it's a bit difficult to talk about. >> Ah, it's fine!

252
00:15:50,984 --> 00:15:54,087
I've already heard about the conversation between the two of you!

253
00:15:54,154 --> 00:15:56,122
(Aimi) That's why it's scary.

254
00:16:04,164 --> 00:16:07,434
(Aimi) Wow, it's another hour.

255
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,437
(White) Aimi-chan should I prepare soon.

256
00:16:11,438 --> 00:16:14,441
(Aimi) Oh no, I'm gonna squeal...

257
00:16:14,507 --> 00:16:17,811
(White) Aimi-chan, it's okay, calm down. (Aimi) Yes.

258
00:16:18,178 --> 00:16:20,080
(Tanaka) What about your mother?

259
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:24,050
(Kirio) It's kind of like work... sorry.

260
00:16:24,117 --> 00:16:26,619
(Tanaka) Yes.

261
00:16:26,686 --> 00:16:30,390
Kirio... Are you okay?

262
00:16:35,061 --> 00:16:37,964
(Tanaka) The guys in my class were also worried.

263
00:16:38,031 --> 00:16:41,201
Miyoshi and Someya.

264
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:50,777
(Kirio) I said something terrible

265
00:16:52,746 --> 00:16:54,381
(Kirio) But... →

266
00:16:54,447 --> 00:16:58,418
I also thought that might have been good.

267
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,822
(Kirio) Because →

268
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:05,959
For me now →

269
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:09,028
Because you don't need anything important.

270
00:17:09,095 --> 00:17:10,897
(Tanaka) Huh?

271
00:17:12,265 --> 00:17:16,803
(Kirio) If I could do something important... I'm sure I'll lose it again.

272
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:27,614
(♪～)

273
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,482
(Kirio) Excuse me.

274
00:17:31,584 --> 00:17:33,486
(White) Kirio-kun.

275
00:17:37,257 --> 00:17:40,727
(Wave) Short comedy! (Aimi) "Dragon office worker"!

276
00:17:40,794 --> 00:17:43,897
(Wave) Ah, will a new graduate join the company today?

277
00:17:43,963 --> 00:17:45,665
I wonder what kind of kids will come?

278
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:48,501
(Aimi) Excuse me. (Wave) is a dragon! ?

279
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:51,538
(Aimi) Yes, it's a dragon I heard that your company is black!

280
00:17:51,604 --> 00:17:53,406
So I came to burn it down!

281
00:17:53,473 --> 00:17:56,943
Gooooo! (Waves) Wow!

282
00:18:01,181 --> 00:18:03,917
(Aimi) It's crazy, it was so exciting...

283
00:18:05,718 --> 00:18:08,087
Wait, Kirio-kun! Sorry for letting go!

284
00:18:08,154 --> 00:18:11,491
But this is... the first day I laughed with Kirio-kun →

285
00:18:11,558 --> 00:18:13,293
It's a dragon!

286
00:18:13,993 --> 00:18:15,662
hang on!

287
00:18:19,199 --> 00:18:21,468
(Momose) Satsuki Thank you for waiting.

288
00:18:21,534 --> 00:18:23,870
(Satsuki) Good job...

289
00:18:23,937 --> 00:18:27,040
That's Momose.

290
00:18:28,374 --> 00:18:33,146
(Satsuki) That... I have something I want to talk about.

291
00:18:40,153 --> 00:18:43,323
Is "footsteps" (Momose) a dragon?

292
00:18:43,323 --> 00:18:45,091
(♪~) (Aimi) Wait, Kirio-kun!

293
00:18:45,158 --> 00:18:47,093
(♪~) (Momose) Kirio?

294
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,696
(♪~) >> Hey Kirio! (Satsuki) Kirio?

295
00:18:49,762 --> 00:18:51,898
(♪~) >> What, wait Momose!

296
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:54,234
(♪~) (Aimi) Kirio-kun, wait! (Momose) Kirio!

297
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,336
(♪~) (Satsuki) Why are you running...!

298
00:18:56,402 --> 00:18:59,272
(♪~) (Aimi) I have something I want to tell Kirio-kun...!

299
00:18:59,339 --> 00:19:01,941
(♪~) (Aimi) Kirio-kun!

300
00:19:02,008 --> 00:19:04,711
(♪~) (Mitsuta) Miyoshi and Someya with Kirio →

301
00:19:04,777 --> 00:19:06,646
(♪~) >> I hope we can't make up!

302
00:19:06,713 --> 00:19:10,049
(♪~) >> I hope Miyoshi and Someya don't get well!

303
00:19:10,116 --> 00:19:12,519
(♪~) >> Miyoshi and Someya-san continue to go on from now on →

304
00:19:12,585 --> 00:19:15,722
(♪~) >> I hope you don't have fun and laugh!

305
00:19:15,788 --> 00:19:18,725
(♪~) (Aimi) Mitsuda... (Waves) A ​​spell for the full moon...

306
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:22,462
(♪~) (Satsuki) Two anti-sama? (Mitsuda) Wow, I was surprised.

307
00:19:22,529 --> 00:19:24,731
(♪~) (Momose) Mitsuda... what are you doing?

308
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:27,166
(♪~) (Mitsuda) Why are you guys here?

309
00:19:27,233 --> 00:19:31,304
(♪~) (Momose) No, we... chase after Kirio...

310
00:19:31,371 --> 00:19:39,045
(♪～)

311
00:19:39,112 --> 00:19:41,180
(Aimi) Kirio-kun.

312
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:45,652
I have something I want to apologise to Kirio-kun

313
00:19:47,153 --> 00:19:49,222
Immediately after enrolling in the hospital →

314
00:19:49,289 --> 00:19:52,392
I've learned about Kirio-kun's friend...

315
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:55,328
I kept quiet about it.

316
00:19:56,963 --> 00:19:59,065
(Kirio) What is that...

317
00:19:59,132 --> 00:20:01,968
So you can say that well.

318
00:20:02,035 --> 00:20:04,037
(Aimi) Kirio-kun's favorite soccer →

319
00:20:04,103 --> 00:20:06,773
I think it would be fun if we could do it together!

320
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:10,076
But I couldn't leave it alone.

321
00:20:11,678 --> 00:20:14,747
(Kirio) Please, don't mind me

322
00:20:14,814 --> 00:20:18,217
It's tough! Looking at Miyoshi and Someya!

323
00:20:27,126 --> 00:20:31,831
(Kirio) If it continues like this... I want to disappear.

324
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:34,133
From the front of the two.

325
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,169
(Aimi) Kirio-kun.

326
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:40,707
(Kirio) The two of them were dazzling all the time.

327
00:20:41,975 --> 00:20:45,178
That's true for Momose and Satsuki.

328
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,180
Even when you say "Good morning" →

329
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:49,315
Even when I take sleepy classes →

330
00:20:49,382 --> 00:20:51,517
Even when club activities are troublesome →

331
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:55,388
Even when I'm talking about something that doesn't matter...

332
00:20:55,455 --> 00:20:57,724
I was too glaring.

333
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:01,728
(Kirio) Everyone is just as fun as it is, isn't it?

334
00:21:01,794 --> 00:21:04,197
Of course that's right...

335
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,099
But →

336
00:21:06,165 --> 00:21:09,535
Every time I feel unpleasant, I am reminded of

337
00:21:11,337 --> 00:21:14,240
Next to me, already →

338
00:21:14,307 --> 00:21:17,043
There's no "someone you love."

339
00:21:19,412 --> 00:21:23,349
(Kirio) But I can't be the only one to laugh.

340
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:25,785
that's why….

341
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:29,656
(Kirio) I want to disappear anymore...

342
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:34,127
(Kirio) If it disappears... →

343
00:21:34,193 --> 00:21:36,195
