1
00:00:06,374 --> 00:00:08,442
(Aimi) What? Wave What did you say now?

2
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:11,312
(White) So what will Aimi do?

3
00:00:11,379 --> 00:00:14,382
What if Kirio-kun's fart was so loud that it pulled out.

4
00:00:14,448 --> 00:00:16,717
(Aimi) What? It's too happy.

5
00:00:16,784 --> 00:00:19,253
(Wave) Even if it was 700 million decibels?

6
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,889
(Aimi) Even if Kirio-kun is far away,

7
00:00:21,956 --> 00:00:24,091
It's great to feel close to you.

8
00:00:24,158 --> 00:00:27,161
(Waves) But if you were by your side, your eardrum might break.

9
00:00:27,228 --> 00:00:28,963
(Aimi) It won't tear.

10
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:31,198
Because I can hear the fart beside Kirio-kun →

11
00:00:31,265 --> 00:00:32,967
It's not a relationship.

12
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:35,803
(Wave) That's right.

13
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:40,708
(Aimi) Only the chosen ones can hear Kirio-kun's fart.

14
00:00:40,775 --> 00:00:44,912
(Wave) Is the chosen one a lover?

15
00:00:44,979 --> 00:00:48,382
(Aimi) What? Are you trying to tell Kirio-kun that he has a girlfriend?

16
00:00:48,449 --> 00:00:52,887
(White) I don't want to think so, but I can't say there's no one there, right?

17
00:00:52,953 --> 00:00:55,122
(Aimi) Well.

18
00:00:55,189 --> 00:00:57,158
Damn it.

19
00:00:57,224 --> 00:01:00,060
We don't know anything about Kirio-kun.

20
00:01:00,127 --> 00:01:04,231
(Wave) I'd like to have a chance to talk about it.

21
00:01:04,298 --> 00:01:07,902
(Aimi) Let's ask about your favorite color?

22
00:01:07,968 --> 00:01:10,471
(Wave) Are you willing to expand the story?

23
00:01:10,538 --> 00:01:14,308
Please send me something more forgotten.

24
00:01:14,375 --> 00:01:17,545
It's like being grateful.

25
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:31,692
(Wave) This is it.

26
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,062
This is Aimi! Kirio-kun's Gakuran!

27
00:01:35,129 --> 00:01:36,864
Maybe there's still?

28
00:01:36,931 --> 00:01:38,933
Deliver it and get the opportunity to talk...

29
00:01:38,999 --> 00:01:43,237
(Aimi) Silly! Just shut up the waves.

30
00:01:43,304 --> 00:01:46,507
(Wave) Sorry, it would be bad if someone asked me.

31
00:01:46,574 --> 00:01:51,278
(Aimi) That's wrong, the brim will fly to the exhibit.

32
00:01:51,345 --> 00:01:53,814
You know what this is?

33
00:01:53,881 --> 00:01:56,617
It's Kirio-kun's extremely valuable personal belongings.

34
00:01:56,684 --> 00:01:59,720
It's polite to first watch the item before delivering it...

35
00:01:59,787 --> 00:02:02,823
Hey! Waves What are you holding it with you?

36
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:05,559
(White) I'll deliver it to Kirio-kun.

37
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:08,762
(Aimi) What? It's Zuri, that's it!

38
00:02:09,864 --> 00:02:14,135
Here it is! Let's make a fair decision by rock-paper-scissors.

39
00:02:14,201 --> 00:02:18,105
The winner will deliver school run to Kirio-kun.

40
00:02:18,172 --> 00:02:20,975
(Wave) There's nothing I can do about it.

41
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:23,210
(Aimi) Let's go!

42
00:02:23,277 --> 00:02:26,013
First, goo Rock-paper-scissors Kenpon!

43
00:02:33,187 --> 00:02:35,422
(Wave) Wow, Aimi-chan. (Aimi) What?

44
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:38,959
(Wave) This is the first time I've seen someone using both hands in rock-paper-scissors.

45
00:02:39,026 --> 00:02:41,795
(Aimi) What? Is it used for generations in my family? Huh?

46
00:02:41,862 --> 00:02:44,064
(Wave) No no! Restarting!

47
00:02:44,131 --> 00:02:46,567
(Aimi) Twitch I understand.

48
00:02:46,634 --> 00:02:49,637
So, let's do this within one minute...

49
00:02:50,804 --> 00:02:53,140
(Nami) What do you like about Kirio-kun?

50
00:02:53,207 --> 00:02:56,010
(Aimi) The one who can write more wins.

51
00:02:56,076 --> 00:02:59,313
(Wave) Oh no, this can't be wrong

52
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:03,684
(Aimi) Which one is stronger? My feelings for Kirio-kun.

53
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:06,554
(Waves) Good.

54
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,289
(Aimi) Start! (Wave) Start!

55
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:19,466
(♪～)

56
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:21,368
(♪~) Wow!

57
00:03:21,435 --> 00:03:24,738
(♪～)

58
00:03:24,805 --> 00:03:28,142
That's no good. Aimi-chan makes money with organs!

59
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:32,446
(Aimi) What? In fact, I love all the organs so it's no problem, right?

60
00:03:32,513 --> 00:03:34,815
So this is a landslide victory.

61
00:03:34,882 --> 00:03:37,885
It's going to be a relationship where you can listen to Kirio-kun's farts.

62
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:42,222
(Wave) Wait, Aimi-chan.

63
00:03:42,289 --> 00:03:45,826
This is something different.

64
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:48,963
Which one wins?

65
00:03:49,029 --> 00:03:52,933
We're friends, right?

66
00:03:55,369 --> 00:03:58,572
(Aimi) No, it's a rival.

67
00:03:59,673 --> 00:04:01,375
If you want to fall in love with someone →

68
00:04:01,442 --> 00:04:04,578
Be prepared to kick others off.

69
00:04:04,645 --> 00:04:09,950
"I like the same person, but let's work together and be friends" →

70
00:04:10,017 --> 00:04:13,587
I dream too many waves.

71
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:27,568
(Wave) Wait, Aimi-chan.

72
00:04:27,635 --> 00:04:29,903
Ah! (Aimi) Ah!

73
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:33,674
<Dear Kirio-kun>

74
00:04:33,741 --> 00:04:35,409
<I like you>

75
00:04:35,476 --> 00:04:39,880
(Wave) Ahhh! (Aimi) Hey! It's gone.

76
00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:43,250
<But I didn't know>

77
00:04:43,317 --> 00:04:47,721
<It's so hard to fall in love with someone>

78
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:53,360
<The person you like is completely attached to, right?>

79
00:04:53,427 --> 00:04:57,297
(Wave) What should I do? Aimi-chan.

80
00:04:57,364 --> 00:04:59,400
(Aimi) <But if they're two people>

81
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:02,269
I have no choice but to cooperate.

82
00:05:02,336 --> 00:05:04,338
<No>

83
00:05:04,405 --> 00:05:06,340
Take off your shoes.

84
00:05:06,407 --> 00:05:08,676
"There are things that can be done because we are two people."

85
00:05:08,742 --> 00:05:10,678
Right!

86
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:14,281
(Wave) Hmm! Aimi-chan, Mihidari!

87
00:05:14,348 --> 00:05:16,216
(Aimi) Which one?

88
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,255
(Wave) It's arrived! (Aimi) Wow!

89
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,490
(Waves) Me. (Aimi) Why?

90
00:05:23,557 --> 00:05:25,626
(Wave) Looking at it, Kirio-kun's Gakuran shines.

91
00:05:25,693 --> 00:05:28,462
(Aimi) No, give it back! Hey!

92
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:31,098
(Waves) Ah, smell it. (Aimi) You definitely should stop.

93
00:05:31,165 --> 00:05:34,068
Why do you smell it? (Waves) It smells nice.

94
00:05:34,134 --> 00:05:36,203
(Aimi) By the way, what does it smell like!

95
00:05:37,237 --> 00:05:41,308
(Wave) This was good.

96
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:43,877
Ha, I'll go to Kirio-kun →

97
00:05:43,944 --> 00:05:47,214
I thought it was a chance to get closer.

98
00:05:47,281 --> 00:05:49,049
(Aimi) Don't be greedy, waves.

99
00:05:49,116 --> 00:05:51,985
It wasn't the timing yet.

100
00:05:52,052 --> 00:05:54,188
(Wave) I see.

101
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:58,425
(Aimi) But.

102
00:06:01,228 --> 00:06:02,896
memorial!

103
00:06:02,963 --> 00:06:06,333
>> “Smartphone shutter sound”

104
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,570
(Aimi) That's about allowed. (Wave) Send it later.

105
00:06:10,671 --> 00:06:14,675
Hey Aimi-chan, Kirio-kun, let's go home with a sniff.

106
00:06:14,742 --> 00:06:16,944
(Aimi) What? What is that, it's the best.

107
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:19,046
Then, from me, "Kirio-kun."

108
00:06:19,113 --> 00:06:22,182
(White) Ah, Aimi-chan is already over.

109
00:06:22,249 --> 00:06:24,318
(Aimi) Hahaha... “lol”

110
00:06:31,325 --> 00:06:33,861
(Kirio) Ah, there was.

111
00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:42,669
Scared.

112
00:06:58,252 --> 00:06:59,920
(Waves) Parrot.

113
00:07:01,054 --> 00:07:20,440
(♪～)

114
00:07:20,507 --> 00:07:40,093
(♪～)

115
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:46,800
(Female teacher) 23 paragraphs First sentence.

116
00:07:46,867 --> 00:07:50,037
So as I explained earlier, →

117
00:07:50,103 --> 00:07:53,407
"Even though there is an animal desire →

118
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:56,977
Depending on the situation and the relationship with the other person →

119
00:07:57,044 --> 00:08:01,148
There is also the view that we may choose to be lonely →

120
00:08:01,215 --> 00:08:05,786
It must be said to be truly Sumatra-like. "It says, but →

121
00:08:05,853 --> 00:08:09,723
This Sumatra-like thing... (Kirio) Dr. I have a nosebleed.

122
00:08:09,957 --> 00:08:13,493
(Female teacher) Oh, it's awful. Kirio-kun goes to the health room right away and take a break.

123
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,964
(Kirio) Eh, ah, yes.

124
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:21,101
(Yoshizawa) What? Dr. Isn't it too impatient just a nosebleed?

125
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:23,503
Hey.

126
00:08:23,537 --> 00:08:26,039
(Female teacher) Don't underestimate a nosebleed!

127
00:08:26,106 --> 00:08:29,843
If everyone is feeling unwell, feel free to use the health room.

128
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:33,447
(Students) Yes.

129
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:39,152
"Door opening and closing sound"

130
00:08:40,921 --> 00:08:43,891
(Aimi) Throwed. (Wave) Thrown.

131
00:08:43,957 --> 00:08:45,859
(Aimi) Nami What's wrong?

132
00:08:45,926 --> 00:08:48,295
(Wave) I suddenly got a headache.

133
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:51,198
(Aimi) Seriously? I also suddenly have a stomachache.

134
00:08:51,265 --> 00:08:52,866
What? Sorry.

135
00:08:52,933 --> 00:08:55,235
Maybe you're about to go to Nami Health Office?

136
00:08:55,302 --> 00:08:57,404
(Wave) Ah, yes, I'm going to do it.

137
00:08:57,471 --> 00:09:00,140
The teacher said that if you're not feeling well, you can use the health room.

138
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:04,211
(Aimi) What? Seriously? I'm going too though. (Wave) Wow, that's right.

139
00:09:04,278 --> 00:09:07,247
(Aimi) Maybe I'll take a break in the bed in the health room?

140
00:09:07,314 --> 00:09:12,052
(Wave) What? But there are only two health room beds, right?

141
00:09:12,119 --> 00:09:15,822
(Aimi) One of them is Kirio-kun...

142
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:17,925
Ah, my stomach hurts!

143
00:09:17,991 --> 00:09:21,228
Nami: That's bad. I'm the one sleeping next to Kirio-kun!

144
00:09:21,295 --> 00:09:25,799
(White) Aimi-chan, don't you have to take it with you? Agreeing to Kirio-kun.

145
00:09:25,866 --> 00:09:28,535
(Aimi) Visiting you? (Wave) That's right.

146
00:09:28,602 --> 00:09:31,538
Come on, you'll take it to someone hospitalized, right?

147
00:09:31,605 --> 00:09:35,509
(Aimi) That's true. (Nami) I'm sure Kirio-kun will be happy too.

148
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:40,981
(Aimi) Well then, I might... pick some kind of flowers or something.

149
00:09:41,048 --> 00:09:42,783
(White) Aimi-chan Likes!

150
00:09:42,849 --> 00:09:44,685
Flowers like those blooming in the courtyard →

151
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:47,387
Save it. (Aimi) Oh.

152
00:09:47,454 --> 00:09:50,424
So what will Nami bring to Kirio-kun?

153
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:52,426
(Wave) Hmm.

154
00:09:52,492 --> 00:09:54,194
feeling?

155
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:56,063
(Aimi) I got fucked!

156
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:58,498
From the beginning, you were planning to outdo it like that?

157
00:09:58,565 --> 00:10:01,168
Wait, waves!

158
00:10:01,234 --> 00:10:03,904
Ah, it hurts... (White) Aimi-chan.

159
00:10:03,971 --> 00:10:07,507
(Aimi) I did this. (White) Aimi-chan, what's wrong?

160
00:10:07,574 --> 00:10:09,743
(Aimi) Both ankles have broken.

161
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:12,713
(Wave) I'm standing normally, but is it okay?

162
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:16,183
(Aimi) For now. But that's how it goes, I'm not going to get any better.

163
00:10:16,249 --> 00:10:20,020
This is completely useless unless you check in the health room.

164
00:10:21,822 --> 00:10:24,524
So I'm going to the health room. (White) Aimi's liar!

165
00:10:24,591 --> 00:10:27,060
Zuu! Good legs! (Aimi) Shut up!

166
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:29,796
I really want to sleep next to Kirio-kun!

167
00:10:29,863 --> 00:10:32,566
(White) Aimi-chan I agree.

168
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:36,169
But what we should do now:

169
00:10:36,236 --> 00:10:38,839
Is this really what it is?

170
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:46,646
I also want to hear him slept in the bed next to Kirio-kun.

171
00:10:46,713 --> 00:10:50,217
But now... don't do anything unnecessary →

172
00:10:50,283 --> 00:10:54,788
I think true kindness is to let him rest.

173
00:10:57,424 --> 00:11:01,795
(Aimi) That's true. The doctor also told me not to underestimate a nosebleed.

174
00:11:01,862 --> 00:11:06,066
Anyway, why did Kirio-kun have a nosebleed?

175
00:11:06,133 --> 00:11:10,170
(Waves) Hmm, it's not too hot.

176
00:11:12,706 --> 00:11:17,677
Ah, is it damaged in the mucous membrane of your nose?

177
00:11:17,744 --> 00:11:21,481
(Aimi) Right, there's a wound in my nose.

178
00:11:21,548 --> 00:11:26,253
Does that mean Kirio-kun is digging his nose?

179
00:11:26,319 --> 00:11:29,456
Come to think of it, I also picked my nose a lot when I was a kid.

180
00:11:29,523 --> 00:11:31,858
I had a lot of nosebleeds.

181
00:11:31,925 --> 00:11:33,960
That's why Kirio-kun is digging his nose →

182
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:35,729
It's not decided.

183
00:11:35,796 --> 00:11:39,099
No, that's fine. If it were Kirio-kun, he would just dig his nose all the way through.

184
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:41,768
Kirio-kun, who picks his nose, is also full of humanity...

185
00:11:41,835 --> 00:11:44,438
(White) Aimi-chan.

186
00:11:44,504 --> 00:11:48,375
I don't like "pick it up."

187
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:54,648
(Wave) Isn't "picking" not okay?

188
00:11:56,750 --> 00:12:00,754
(Aimi) Waves Let's go, the health room. (Wave) What?

189
00:12:00,821 --> 00:12:02,923
(Aimi) I'll ask Kirio-kun directly.

190
00:12:02,989 --> 00:12:04,858
Pick your nose...

191
00:12:04,925 --> 00:12:06,526
Shall I pick it?

192
00:12:06,593 --> 00:12:08,195
Are you worried about the waves too?

193
00:12:08,261 --> 00:12:10,297
(White) That kind of difficult answer is to Kirio-kun...

194
00:12:10,363 --> 00:12:12,199
>> “The sound of opening doors”

195
00:12:12,265 --> 00:12:14,101
(Kirio) Excuse me.

196
00:12:16,636 --> 00:12:21,041
(Aimi) Ki... Kirio-kun. (Wave) Nosebleeds Are you okay?

197
00:12:21,108 --> 00:12:24,277
>> It's fine, it stopped right away.

198
00:12:24,344 --> 00:12:27,681
(Aimi) Maybe she hit her nose?

199
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:30,317
No, what do you mean, a nosebleed →

200
00:12:30,383 --> 00:12:32,853
Me, I didn't come out.

201
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:37,758
So why is it getting a nosebleed? →

202
00:12:37,824 --> 00:12:41,061
There was a bit of a thing that caught my eye a little while ago.

203
00:12:41,128 --> 00:12:43,096
>> Ah, I see.

204
00:12:43,163 --> 00:12:46,967
I'm actually hay fever and it's dangerous.

205
00:12:47,033 --> 00:12:48,935
(Aimi) Hay fever.

206
00:12:49,002 --> 00:12:51,838
>> Every year at this time of year, I blow my nose.

207
00:12:51,905 --> 00:12:55,408
It's common, nosebleeds.

208
00:12:55,475 --> 00:12:58,445
(Aimi) I'm glad it looked okay.

209
00:12:58,512 --> 00:13:02,816
(Wave) Somehow... take away iron or something.

210
00:13:02,883 --> 00:13:05,852
>> Yes, thank you.

211
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:11,024
Hackshon!

212
00:13:13,393 --> 00:13:16,229
(Aimi) It's going to become pollen.

213
00:13:21,601 --> 00:13:24,004
(Aimi) I want to eat a hamburger with Kirio-kun.

214
00:13:24,371 --> 00:13:26,573
(Nami) I want to take a photo with Kirio-kun.

215
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,842
(Aimi) I want to go on a drive with Kirio-kun.

216
00:13:28,909 --> 00:13:31,545
(Nami) I want to have an umbrella with Kirio-kun.

217
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:34,381
(Aimi) I want to go to the haunted house with Kirio-kun.

218
00:13:34,447 --> 00:13:38,785
(White) Kirio-kun and Kirio-kun...

219
00:13:38,852 --> 00:13:40,487
"Sniffing sound"

220
00:13:40,554 --> 00:13:43,690
(Aimi) Nami What's wrong? Are you crying?

221
00:13:43,757 --> 00:13:46,726
(White) Ah, with Kirio-kun...

222
00:13:46,793 --> 00:13:49,162
(Aimi) With Kirio-kun?

223
00:13:49,229 --> 00:13:51,464
(Wave) A convenient accident occurs →

224
00:13:51,531 --> 00:13:53,400
While I was doing it, I went to a small locker →

225
00:13:53,466 --> 00:13:55,101
I'm trapped.

226
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:59,105
We felt each other's heartbeat so much... we cried.

227
00:14:00,106 --> 00:14:02,709
(Aimi) Huhhh? Oh, that's the trick!

228
00:14:02,776 --> 00:14:04,744
Are you trying to get me upset like that?

229
00:14:04,811 --> 00:14:08,014
"I want to do an endless endurance race with Kirio-kun!"

230
00:14:08,081 --> 00:14:10,584
(White) Yes, next It's Aimi's turn.

231
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:13,553
(Aimi) Waves slurp, slurp, slurp, slurp!

232
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,388
(Wave) If you don't answer within 10 seconds, you'll lose.

233
00:14:15,455 --> 00:14:19,125
I'm so happy

234
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:24,497
(Momose) Huh? Seriously?

235
00:14:24,564 --> 00:14:27,400
That's a lie, hey hey...! (Kirio) What's wrong?

236
00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:31,137
(Momose) No, it seems that humans average between 10 and 20.

237
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:32,839
(Kirio) What?

238
00:14:32,906 --> 00:14:34,975
(Momose) Number of moles in the whole body.

239
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:38,478
I had 53 of them too! what? disease?

240
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:42,682
See, it's a little crowded...

241
00:14:42,749 --> 00:14:44,784
(Kirio) That's not a mole, it's a freckle, isn't it?

242
00:14:44,851 --> 00:14:47,921
(Momose) No, isn't it a mole? What about Kirio?

243
00:14:47,988 --> 00:14:50,557
Is it just one mole on my whole body? At the mouth.

244
00:14:50,624 --> 00:14:53,293
(Kirio) What kind of thing is it?

245
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,528
(Satsuki) So true!

246
00:14:55,595 --> 00:14:57,397
(Kirio) Satsuki. (Satsuki) Let's go home together!

247
00:14:57,464 --> 00:15:00,634
(Momose) Oh, the basketball club is back now (Satsuki) Yes.

248
00:15:02,002 --> 00:15:06,106
(Satsuki) Ah, these kids are here again!

249
00:15:06,172 --> 00:15:11,177
(Momose) Ah, it looks like those cats Miyoshi and Someya.

250
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:16,416
Look, this is Miyoshi and this is Someya.

251
00:15:16,483 --> 00:15:19,819
Those two are always together

252
00:15:19,886 --> 00:15:25,792
But they're completely different types, so why are they together?

253
00:15:25,859 --> 00:15:28,395
(Kirio) Isn't it because they're friends?

254
00:15:28,461 --> 00:15:30,463
(Momose) Of course, that's true.

255
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:34,167
The type who looks like a single wolf and doesn't like being with others →

256
00:15:34,234 --> 00:15:38,738
A calm and small animal type that everyone will love.

257
00:15:38,805 --> 00:15:43,176
(Satsuki) Hmm, that's so different. (Momose) Yes.

258
00:15:43,243 --> 00:15:46,246
(Satsuki) What about Kirio? Which type?

259
00:15:46,313 --> 00:15:48,815
(Momose) Stop it, that's it.

260
00:15:51,017 --> 00:15:53,586
(Kirio) What? Ah, sorry I didn't hear it.

261
00:15:53,653 --> 00:15:55,922
(Satsuki) Which one do you know is the type?

262
00:15:55,989 --> 00:16:00,226
That... Someya-san or Miyoshi-san?

263
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:02,696
(Kirio) Hmm.

264
00:16:02,762 --> 00:16:06,299
Ah, I'm coming, so I'll hurry a little.

265
00:16:06,366 --> 00:16:09,269
(Satsuki) Ah, I ran away!

266
00:16:09,336 --> 00:16:13,273
(Momose) Satsuki Don't say anything unnecessary.

267
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:16,142
(Satsuki) Sorry.

268
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:20,280
(Momose) Kirio has always had a wallow for us.

269
00:16:20,347 --> 00:16:24,317
(Satsuki) Hmm, it's a little cool though.

270
00:16:24,384 --> 00:16:27,120
(Momose) I mean cool →

271
00:16:27,187 --> 00:16:30,857
I don't know what you're thinking.

272
00:16:30,924 --> 00:16:33,259
(Satsuki) So you're hiding it from Kirio?

273
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:35,695
There's a girl in the same class that I like.

274
00:16:35,762 --> 00:16:40,233
(Momose) Well, it's also important to make Kirio feel at ease.

275
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,669
All sorts of things are troublesome.

276
00:16:46,072 --> 00:16:49,109
(Momose) Kirio, what if he liked that girl too.

277
00:16:51,211 --> 00:16:53,847
(Satsuki) Kaaaaaa Youth!

278
00:16:53,913 --> 00:16:55,648
(Momose) Shut up. (Satsuki) Wow, youth!

279
00:16:55,715 --> 00:16:57,984
(Momose) Wait, yaro! I'll fight back!

280
00:16:58,051 --> 00:17:00,286
(Aimi) I want to connect with Kirio-kun over Wi-Fi!

281
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:03,356
(White) I want to have a lifelong story with Kirio-kun!

282
00:17:03,423 --> 00:17:06,826
(Aimi) I want to wrap Kirio-kun and everything in this world in gyoza!

283
00:17:06,893 --> 00:17:09,429
I want to drain all the water in the pond with Kirio-kun!

284
00:17:09,496 --> 00:17:12,866
(Nami) I want to scream at the museum with Kirio!

285
00:17:12,932 --> 00:17:16,569
(Aimi) With Kirio-kun... >> "Aimi's belly sound"

286
00:17:16,636 --> 00:17:19,372
(White) Yes Aimi-chan loses.

287
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,041
(Aimi) Damn it's like I'm going to give in to hunger.

288
00:17:22,108 --> 00:17:26,012
(Wave) This proves that I have stronger love.

289
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:29,849
(Aimi) Baaka What do you say... >> "Aimi's belly sound"

290
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:33,353
(Aimi) Ahhh!

291
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:38,858
(Nami) Hey, Aimi-chan What made you fall in love with Kirio-kun?

292
00:17:38,925 --> 00:17:40,894
(Aimi) Ah? What is it? Suddenly.

293
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,264
(Wave) That's fine, tell me.

294
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:46,499
(Aimi) That's...

295
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:51,371
(Tanaka) Yes Congratulations to all 2nd Class 6th Class on their promotion.

296
00:17:51,438 --> 00:17:56,576
I'll give out a career plan request sheet right away.

297
00:18:02,382 --> 00:18:04,717
(Aimi) Wow!

298
00:18:06,986 --> 00:18:11,591
Sorry, there's an eraser at my feet.

299
00:18:11,658 --> 00:18:13,693
(Kirio) Ah.

300
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,962
"The sound of hitting your head against the desk"

301
00:18:16,029 --> 00:18:19,199
(Tanaka) What's the sound now?

302
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:23,403
(Kirio) Ah, sorry, I hit my head on the desk.

303
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:26,739
(Tanaka) Be careful.

304
00:18:26,806 --> 00:18:30,643
Um, what's your name?

305
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:33,780
(Kirio) This is Kirio.

306
00:18:33,847 --> 00:18:35,682
(Tanaka) Yes.

307
00:18:42,255 --> 00:18:45,124
(Aimi) At that time, I fell in love with her at first sight.

308
00:18:45,191 --> 00:18:47,327
(Waves) Haha, shallow.

309
00:18:47,393 --> 00:18:49,028
(Aimi) That's fine.

310
00:18:49,095 --> 00:18:53,967
Something about hitting my head for me...it made me feel bad.

311
00:18:54,033 --> 00:18:56,302
(Wave) Hmm.

312
00:18:56,369 --> 00:19:00,507
Well, it's true that you'll do something for yourself →

313
00:19:00,573 --> 00:19:02,942
That's nice, isn't it?

314
00:19:04,277 --> 00:19:07,080
(Aimi) What about the waves? What about the waves?

315
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,815
(Wave) What do you mean?

316
00:19:08,882 --> 00:19:12,285
(Aimi) Since when did you fall in love with it?

317
00:19:12,352 --> 00:19:14,854
(Wave) I...

318
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:23,196
(Wave) I've always loved it since the winter of my third year of junior high school.

319
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:28,067
(Aimi) So I've loved it since before BC. (Wave) Yes?

320
00:19:28,134 --> 00:19:30,370
(Aimi) Oh, don't lie, understandably!

321
00:19:30,436 --> 00:19:33,540
In the third year of junior high school, he hasn't even met Kirio-kun yet.

322
00:19:33,606 --> 00:19:35,575
That's how I got my background mount.

323
00:19:35,642 --> 00:19:38,344
>> "Aimi's belly sound"

324
00:19:41,881 --> 00:19:47,020
(White) Let's go home If things continue like this, Aimi-chan looks like she's going to die.

325
00:19:47,086 --> 00:19:48,955
(Aimi) Yes I'm back.

326
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:57,664
(White) It was fun Kirio-kun's game (Aimi) I'll never lose next time.

327
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:03,303
(Wave) But what kind of feeling is that you want to break the plate with Kirio-kun.

328
00:20:03,503 --> 00:20:06,873
(Aimi) That's it, it's my first time working together.

329
00:20:06,873 --> 00:20:11,945
(Wave) Will it be destroyed for the first time? (Aimi) Creation has happened from destruction.

330
00:20:12,445 --> 00:20:14,480
The waves were also popular.

331
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:17,150
"I want to be decorated in a frame with Kirio-kun."

332
00:20:17,217 --> 00:20:19,852
(Wave) Once it's all set in the frame together →

333
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:22,622
Isn't it finished now?

334
00:20:22,689 --> 00:20:24,624
(♪~) (Aimi) What's the perfection?

335

00:21:29,922 --> 00:21:32,258
(Aimi) Can you make a machine that reproduces body odor?

347
00:21:32,325 --> 00:21:34,560
Is Mitsuda called Mitsuru?

348
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:36,829
(Wave) It's true that you often hear strange rumors.

349
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:39,165
(Mitsuda) It's Jujutsu. (Aimi) Jujutsu?

350
00:21:39,232 --> 00:21:42,468
>> If you use it all up without anyone seeing it, your wish will come true.

00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:50,309
(Aimi) Kirio-kun. (Kirio) Miyoshi-san?

355
00:21:50,376 --> 00:21:52,412
(Nami) I want to create a love song for Kirio-kun! ?

356
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:54,213
(Aimi) Voice Idiot, so ugh!

357
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:58,885
