1
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,617
(White) Aimi-chan School starts tomorrow →

2
00:00:16,684 --> 00:00:19,186
Why did you go out of your way to get it today?

3
00:00:19,253 --> 00:00:21,922
(Aimi) It was this morning that I remembered.

4
00:00:21,989 --> 00:00:24,792
(Wave) A lunch box you forgot to bring home before the holidays?

5
00:00:24,792 --> 00:00:27,995
(Aimi) If the holidays continue like this, Kirio-kun will be disillusioned.

6
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:31,832
He was told, "Miyoshi-san was surprisingly dirty."

7
00:00:34,835 --> 00:00:36,470
That's fine.

8
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:39,807
(Nami) Kirio-kun is not the kind of person who says such a terrible thing.

9
00:00:39,874 --> 00:00:43,811
(Aimi) No, I don't know about the waves, the lunch box I left on my break →

10
00:00:43,878 --> 00:00:47,181
How will it be? (White) Aimi-chan, is she a habitual offender?

11
00:00:47,248 --> 00:00:50,284
(Aimi) Well, thank you for coming along with me.

12
00:00:50,351 --> 00:00:54,889
I'm sure I'm scared of school alone at night...

13
00:00:54,955 --> 00:00:59,660
That's how it's foggy...

14
00:00:59,727 --> 00:01:02,496
Hey, what are you doing on Kirio-kun's desk?

15
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:06,000
That's no good! (Wave) Eh, that's fine.

16
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,836
It's not like Kirio-kun will see him.

17
00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:11,071
(Aimi) That's not what it is.

18
00:01:11,138 --> 00:01:13,641
I was trying to do it!

19
00:01:13,707 --> 00:01:16,811
Ah, it's already been overwritten by the wave butt!

20
00:01:16,877 --> 00:01:20,314
Kirio-kun's chair! What are you doing? Damn it!

21
00:01:20,381 --> 00:01:24,018
(White) Just a moment Aimi-chan, stop it! (Aimi) I want to feel Kirio-kun too!

22
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:26,387
(Wave) My Kirio-kun! (Aimi) Ah!

23
00:01:26,454 --> 00:01:28,622
(Waves) Oh! (Aimi) What is that all of a sudden.

24
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:31,525
(Wave) No way Aimi-chan, there... Hi, people...!

25
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:34,495
(Aimi) What?

26
00:01:34,562 --> 00:01:36,931
Ah?

27
00:01:37,898 --> 00:01:38,732
Ahhh!

28
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:55,749
(♪～)

29
00:01:55,816 --> 00:02:12,700
(♪～)

30
00:02:12,766 --> 00:02:17,771
(♪～)

31
00:02:21,575 --> 00:02:23,577
(Wave) Ha ha ha... (Aimi) Ha ha ha...

32
00:02:24,945 --> 00:02:27,181
(Wave) What... (Aimi) Mitsuda?

33
00:02:27,748 --> 00:02:30,084
(Mitsuda) That's dazzling.

34
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:34,221
(Aimi) I was surprised - why is that so?

35
00:02:34,288 --> 00:02:36,457
Maybe Mitsuda would also get his lunch box?

36
00:02:36,457 --> 00:02:38,592
>>Huh? It's not.

37
00:02:38,592 --> 00:02:40,728
I came to do magic.

38
00:02:40,794 --> 00:02:44,398
(Aimi) Is that what you can do again? I guess that's possible at home.

39
00:02:44,465 --> 00:02:49,703
>> That's...hahaha...

40
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:51,739
Today, it can only be done here.

41
00:02:51,805 --> 00:02:54,174
(Wave) What does that mean? >> This magic →

42
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:57,511
You need a large area that doesn't block the light of the full moon.

43
00:02:57,578 --> 00:02:59,947
Today, those conditions are met

44
00:03:01,148 --> 00:03:03,751
The key on the roof that I borrowed before my break.

45
00:03:03,817 --> 00:03:05,920
I came to get this.

46
00:03:05,986 --> 00:03:08,189
(Aimi) So we'll go home.

47
00:03:12,493 --> 00:03:16,597
>> If so, could I tell you something special?

48
00:03:16,664 --> 00:03:18,365
This magic.

49
00:03:18,432 --> 00:03:22,703
(Aimi) Wow, isn't it a magical technique? I really want to curse you, do it.

50
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:24,705
(White) Hey Mitsuda-kun.

51
00:03:24,772 --> 00:03:30,377
Is that cursing type? A type that will come true?

52
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,882
>> The latter.

53
00:03:34,949 --> 00:03:37,284
(Aimi) Please let me know.

54
00:03:37,351 --> 00:03:38,953
>> Yes.

55
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:41,689
Hehe... hehe.

56
00:03:42,523 --> 00:03:44,892
First, please get into this position

57
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:46,594
(Aimi) What?

58
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:50,130
>> Looking at the economy like this, the sky and the ground look the other way around.

59
00:03:50,197 --> 00:03:52,967
This theory and Kotodama's way of thinking is mashed up →

60
00:03:53,033 --> 00:03:54,635
It's this magic.

61
00:03:54,702 --> 00:03:57,304
In other words, while peering through your legs, you do the opposite of your wish →

62
00:03:57,371 --> 00:03:59,974
He keeps screaming loudly and has mysterious powers →

63
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,076
If you continue to be exposed to the moonlight of the sacred full moon →

64
00:04:02,142 --> 00:04:04,378
The effect will double... (Wave) See you tomorrow.

65
00:04:04,445 --> 00:04:07,314
>> What a hey! (Wave) No matter how much your wish comes true →

66
00:04:07,381 --> 00:04:09,717
That's really embarrassing

67
00:04:09,783 --> 00:04:11,619
>> Was that what it was?

68
00:04:11,685 --> 00:04:14,688
What are your feelings for Kirio?

69
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:42,249
(Aimi) I don't want to wake up with Kirio-kun and start a wonderful day!

70
00:04:42,316 --> 00:04:44,251
(Wave) A little dust in Kirio-kun's room →

71
00:04:44,318 --> 00:04:46,787
I don't want to put it in my mouth! (Aimi) On a trip with Kirio-kun →

72
00:04:46,854 --> 00:04:48,922
I don't want to buy some weird keychains and laugh at each other!

73
00:04:48,989 --> 00:04:51,358
(Wave) I don't want to touch Kirio-kun's gums with my bare hands!

74
00:04:51,425 --> 00:04:54,528
(Aimi) I don't want to do a pure white puzzle with Kirio-kun!

75
00:04:54,595 --> 00:04:56,697
(White) Kirio-kun and I have some food and stuff, all alone →

76
00:04:56,764 --> 00:05:00,267
I don't want to wash away on a deserted island! >> Ah.

77
00:05:00,334 --> 00:05:03,871
(Aimi) Mitsuda. (Wave) How much more should I continue?

78
00:05:03,937 --> 00:05:05,539
>> Sorry.

79
00:05:05,606 --> 00:05:07,675
The full moon was tomorrow.

80
00:05:10,444 --> 00:05:13,147
(Aimi) What?

81
00:05:13,213 --> 00:05:16,784
Haha Hahaha... (Wave) Ahaha.

82
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:22,222
(Aimi) Hahaha... “lol” (Wave) Hahaha... “lol”

83
00:05:22,289 --> 00:05:24,558
>> Hahaha... “lol” (Aimi) Hahahahaha...

84
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:27,494
Mitsuda Come over here. >> Yes.

85
00:05:27,561 --> 00:05:29,897
(Wave) Hahaha... “lol” >> Hahaha... “lol”

86
00:05:29,963 --> 00:05:33,067
(Aimi) Come on, sit here. >> Yes.

87
00:05:33,133 --> 00:05:35,069
Hahaha... “lol” (Wave) Hahaha... “lol”

88
00:05:35,135 --> 00:05:37,571
Hahaha... “lol” (Aimi) Hahaha... “lol”

89
00:05:37,638 --> 00:05:39,273
>> Hahaha... “lol”

90
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,575
(Aimi) Take a deep breath.

91
00:05:41,642 --> 00:05:43,477
>> Hmm.

92
00:05:43,544 --> 00:05:45,479
En! ! !

93
00:05:48,615 --> 00:05:50,684
(Tanaka) Makida. >> \Yes.

94
00:05:50,751 --> 00:05:53,320
(Tanaka) Masuda. >> \Yes.

95
00:05:53,387 --> 00:05:56,457
(Tanaka) Mitsuda. (Mitsuda) Yes.

96
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:58,826
(Tanaka) Miyoshi.

97
00:05:58,892 --> 00:06:02,362
Miyoshi. Is Miyoshi a day off?

98
00:06:02,429 --> 00:06:05,599
Well, Murata. >> \Yes.

99
00:06:10,304 --> 00:06:14,208
(Mitsuda) Ah, that Someya-san.

100
00:06:14,274 --> 00:06:17,811
Miyoshi-san, what's wrong...

101
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:20,581
What!

102
00:06:20,647 --> 00:06:24,084
Miyoshi-san, were you cursed?

103
00:06:24,151 --> 00:06:25,953
(Wave) It's not a curse.

104
00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:28,655
It looks like Aimi has a cold.

105
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:33,494
>> I'm sorry yesterday.

106
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,529
But what is that wording?

107
00:06:35,596 --> 00:06:41,168
(Wave) Ah, the end of the holidays, this is my lament that I missed seeing Kirio-kun for the first time.

108
00:06:41,235 --> 00:06:43,871
>>I see.

109
00:06:43,937 --> 00:06:46,140
So today it's Someya-san →

110
00:06:46,206 --> 00:06:48,976
So you can have Kirio all to yourself.

111
00:06:49,042 --> 00:06:53,213
(Wave) Eh...haha That's right.

112
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,849
>> Hahaha... “lol”

113
00:06:57,084 --> 00:07:01,421
(Aimi) I don't think he's thinking of running away from the waves.

114
00:07:03,891 --> 00:07:06,827
Kirio-kun, what's wrong with Kirio-kun?

115
00:07:08,796 --> 00:07:11,231
Oh ha ha ha...

116
00:07:11,298 --> 00:07:14,635
No, that's dangerous! Kirio-kun's intake is too low →

117
00:07:14,701 --> 00:07:19,139
Just sitting down the chair made me get excited... haa...

118
00:07:29,883 --> 00:07:33,454
(Aimi) Is this guy joking?

119
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,823
The only nutrient that you sleep in is →

120
00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:38,959
That's information about Kirio-kun!

121
00:07:39,026 --> 00:07:42,996
(Tanaka) Some verbs use O →

122
00:07:43,063 --> 00:07:45,065
Be careful.

123
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:49,069
Eh, as you can see from this, it's SVOO.

124
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:53,473
By using TO for things from people →

125
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:57,544
From things to people. do you understand?

126
00:07:57,611 --> 00:07:59,913
Well then...

127
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:03,584
(Aimi) I know that, but... I'm lacking in a vitamin called Kirio-kun →

128
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,886
It's about to die.

129
00:08:08,689 --> 00:08:11,692
Ah, I'm curious, that's bad.

130
00:08:11,758 --> 00:08:13,794
Maybe I'll go to school now.

131
00:08:13,861 --> 00:08:15,729
>> “Smartphone notification sound”

132
00:08:17,731 --> 00:08:20,601
(Aimi) Aaaah? picture? Wait, wait, no no no no!

133
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:22,903
Kirio-kun is messaging!

134
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:26,607
What a dream? No, I vomit, my heart hurts.

135
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:29,276
hang on.

136
00:08:29,343 --> 00:08:32,079
Yes, open, open, open, open.

137
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:42,522
(Aimi) I see, are you hallucinating because of the fever?

138
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:45,492
Because Kirio-kun is waves →

139
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:48,996
That's just a strange dream.

140
00:09:01,441 --> 00:09:05,946
(Aimi) I see. That's the setting right away...

141
00:09:06,013 --> 00:09:08,882
But I'll borrow a smartphone from Namigirio-kun →

142
00:09:08,949 --> 00:09:11,718
Normally I would never do it.

143
00:09:11,785 --> 00:09:14,187
How did you stop the distance from it?

144
00:09:15,422 --> 00:09:18,725
Ahh! He himself appears...

145
00:09:18,792 --> 00:09:22,195
Oh, wait, it's impossible. This is completely Kirio.

146
00:09:22,262 --> 00:09:24,731
Because high school students who use "sweat" in this era →

147
00:09:24,798 --> 00:09:26,533
It's just Kirio-kun.

148
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,335
Oh no, it's so bad, help me.

149
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:32,372
Is Kirio-kun worried about me now?

150
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,609
Ah wow!

151
00:09:35,676 --> 00:09:38,946
What is "Shinpai Daifuku"?

152
00:09:39,012 --> 00:09:42,015
Ah, Kirio kumm!

153
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:43,817
Hahaha... “lol”

154
00:09:47,788 --> 00:09:50,557
(Nami) Thank you Kirio-kun for lending me your smartphone.

155
00:09:50,624 --> 00:09:52,826
(Kirio) Ah, did you get it back?

156
00:09:52,893 --> 00:09:56,697
(Wave) Yes, when I told him about the situation, he was actually praised.

157
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:58,799
>> A lecture broadcast...

158
00:09:58,865 --> 00:10:01,268
Miyoshi is so serious.

159
00:10:01,335 --> 00:10:09,042
(Wave) Ah, yes, that might happen...

160
00:10:10,877 --> 00:10:13,513
>> That Someya-san.

161
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,215
(Wave) Yes.

162
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:17,784
>> Someya-san and Miyoshi-san →

163
00:10:17,851 --> 00:10:20,454
Have you been the same since junior high school?

164
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,289
(Wave) No, why?

165
00:10:22,356 --> 00:10:26,927
>> No, what do you mean, the two... because we're good friends.

166
00:10:27,928 --> 00:10:30,831
(Nami) Kirio-kun and Momose-kun are also good friends.

167
00:10:30,897 --> 00:10:34,401
>> Ah, yes, but that guy →

168
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:37,638
Because it's like that with anyone.

169
00:10:37,704 --> 00:10:39,406
(Wave) That's right.

170
00:10:39,473 --> 00:10:42,242
>> So →

171
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:44,978
Because I don't have one.

172
00:10:45,045 --> 00:10:47,547
For Someya-san →

173
00:10:47,614 --> 00:10:50,183
People like Miyoshi.

174
00:10:56,089 --> 00:10:59,292
Oh, there's no deep meaning.

175
00:10:59,359 --> 00:11:01,028
(Wave) Yes.

176
00:11:05,866 --> 00:11:09,536
(Kitahara) What should I do if I'll take it to Someya-san →

177
00:11:09,603 --> 00:11:11,304
The magnification might be incredible.

178
00:11:11,371 --> 00:11:13,440
(Shimizu) Even though I increased the number of cram schools in my school →

179
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:15,809
If this falls...

180
00:11:15,876 --> 00:11:18,211
Hmm...

181
00:11:21,882 --> 00:11:25,719
(Aimi) "Miyoshi-san, are you feeling well? Sweat?" →

182
00:11:25,786 --> 00:11:27,421
Because you said it →

183
00:11:27,487 --> 00:11:30,424
February 12th is Kirio Memorial Day.

184
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:32,426
Today I'll be Kirio-kun →

185
00:11:32,492 --> 00:11:35,128
As someone who was worried about his health →

186
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:38,799
Live a strong and supple life...

187
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:41,668
>> “Smartphone notification sound”

188
00:11:41,735 --> 00:11:43,437
(Aimi) Kirio-kun?

189
00:11:51,812 --> 00:11:53,980
(Aimi) Report as I don't need it today!

190
00:12:04,658 --> 00:12:06,493
(Aimi) Good morning!

191
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,296
(White) Good morning Aimi-chan, you're in great health.

192
00:12:09,362 --> 00:12:11,898
(Aimi) Kirio-kun's power blows away the cold.

193
00:12:11,965 --> 00:12:13,567
Thank you today I'm saying that.

194
00:12:13,633 --> 00:12:16,203
And then the conversation got lively.

195
00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:18,171
(Satsuki) So true!

196
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:21,675
(Kirio) Oh, Satsuki, Ahhhhh.

197
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:24,878
(Satsuki) Huh? Momose was also so handsome that he didn't notice it.

198
00:12:24,945 --> 00:12:27,781
(Momose) Is it just your face? He's also handsome inside.

199
00:12:27,848 --> 00:12:29,616
(Satsuki) Where is it?

200
00:12:29,683 --> 00:12:32,986
(Aimi) What is it? That damn damn, probably born in May.

201
00:12:33,053 --> 00:12:36,623
(Nami) Kirio-kun You called Satsuki by your younger name.

202
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:40,060
We've only been called by our last name.

203
00:12:40,127 --> 00:12:43,763
(Aimi) No, there is still a possibility that "sa" is the surname and "tsuki" is the name.

204
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:46,666
(Wave) What kind of name? (Aimi) No, there might be.

205
00:12:46,733 --> 00:12:48,702
(Waves) Isn't there?

206
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:52,105
(Aimi) Just because when he was in the first year he was in the same class as Kirio-kun.

207
00:12:52,172 --> 00:12:54,608
I'm sure I'm in my current class and don't take anybody else...

208
00:12:54,674 --> 00:12:57,811
(Hashimoto) Satsuki Good morning, thank you for lending me your notebook.

209
00:12:57,878 --> 00:12:59,546
It was really helpful! (Satsuki) That's good.

210
00:12:59,613 --> 00:13:01,381
(Fukushima) Thanks to the change of day →

211
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:03,283
Yesterday, I made it in time for part-time job, thank you!

212
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:05,318
(Satsuki) That's good, I'm glad, please say it anytime.

213
00:13:05,385 --> 00:13:09,089
(Fukushima) It's a relief! (Wave) It's really popular.

214
00:13:09,156 --> 00:13:13,226
(Aimi) I'm sure those kinds of people have a secret face.

215
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:15,295
If I knew that, Kirio-kun would be the one.

216
00:13:15,362 --> 00:13:17,397
(Wave) What's the hidden face?

217
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:19,733
(Aimi) There's a bad attitude or a bad personality.

218
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:22,569
(White) It's Aimi's face.

219
00:13:22,636 --> 00:13:24,371
(Aimi) Huh?

220
00:13:24,437 --> 00:13:27,007
(Satsuki) Ah, that's right I bought this one just a while ago.

221
00:13:27,073 --> 00:13:30,010
Kirio's favorite. (Kirio) Oh! Cheese croquette bread.

222
00:13:30,076 --> 00:13:32,379
(Satsuki) I quickly got it, but it was almost sold out!

223
00:13:32,445 --> 00:13:34,581
(Kirio) What? It's been six months since I last visited.

224
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:37,050
thank you. (Satsuki) That's good.

225
00:13:37,117 --> 00:13:39,352
(Momose) Yes, a few, a few, a few! My thing! ?

226
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:42,689
(Satsuki) Momose Do you want it? (Momose) I want it, I'm hungry

227
00:13:42,756 --> 00:13:46,092
(Satsuki) Actually. (Momose) Actually? (Satsuki) Actually, there is!

228
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:48,128
(Momose) Psycho!

229
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:53,033
(White) Aimi-chan Thank you so much.

230
00:13:53,099 --> 00:13:54,901
(Aimi) I'm alive.

231
00:13:54,968 --> 00:13:58,838
(Wave) Isn't there still a fever? (Aimi) Chigewa.

232
00:13:58,905 --> 00:14:03,743
Nami: I can't be at ease when I see something like that...

233
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:08,615
(Waves) It's certainly a little too close to the distance.

234
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:15,922
(Aimi) If you think about it, you'll even send me a message →

235
00:14:15,989 --> 00:14:18,825
I guess he's sending more to him.

236
00:14:18,892 --> 00:14:23,430
Anyway, we send each other photos of each other's throat penis every night...

237
00:14:23,496 --> 00:14:25,665
Ahhh!

238
00:14:25,732 --> 00:14:27,801
(Wave) It's really hot.

239
00:14:31,438 --> 00:14:35,041
(Aimi) Wave Me →

240
00:14:35,108 --> 00:14:39,579
I can't talk to Kirio like that...

241
00:14:41,848 --> 00:14:45,919
He also knows Kirio-kun's favorite bread →

242
00:14:45,986 --> 00:14:47,587
More than anything →

243
00:14:47,654 --> 00:14:51,625
He can make Kirio-kun so happy.

244
00:14:51,691 --> 00:14:58,064
Satsuki will continue to create various Kirio-kun expressions from now on.

245
00:14:58,131 --> 00:14:59,799
So →

246
00:14:59,866 --> 00:15:03,203
What should be by Kirio-kun's side...

247
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:05,639
(Wave) What are you feeling weak?

248
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:09,643
Aimi said that.

249
00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:13,647
If you're going to fall in love with someone, be prepared to kick someone off.

250
00:15:13,713 --> 00:15:16,316
That's what Aimi said at that time →

251
00:15:16,383 --> 00:15:20,854
I'd decided to do anything for the person I like.

252
00:15:20,921 --> 00:15:23,390
Certainly, Kirio-kun's expression just now is →

253
00:15:23,456 --> 00:15:25,625
Maybe only that girl can bring it out.

254
00:15:25,692 --> 00:15:30,096
In that case, let's make Kirio-kun laugh, not just smile.

255
00:15:31,831 --> 00:15:33,967
(Blue Beauty) wave….

256
00:15:34,034 --> 00:15:38,438
(Wave) Isn't that what it means to be prepared to fall in love with someone?

257
00:15:38,505 --> 00:15:40,440
So if Aimi stops →

258
00:15:40,507 --> 00:15:42,776
I'll only go first.

259
00:15:44,344 --> 00:15:45,979
(Aimi) No way.

260
00:15:46,046 --> 00:15:50,684
I don't want to be ahead of the waves.

261
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:56,122
But... I don't want to give it to Satsuki like this.

262
00:15:56,189 --> 00:15:58,792
(Wave) If that's the case, you wouldn't say anything crying!

263
00:16:02,429 --> 00:16:05,398
(Aimi) Yeah! I'll do it fair and proud!

264
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:08,435
Let's spread rumors that his staple food is soil!

265
00:16:08,501 --> 00:16:11,604
(Wave) Aimi-chan is the most insidious in Japan.

266
00:16:11,671 --> 00:16:13,840
(Aimi) So is there any other good way?

267
00:16:13,907 --> 00:16:16,343
(Wave) First, just ask.

268
00:16:16,409 --> 00:16:18,311
(Aimi) Huh? What is it?

269
00:16:18,378 --> 00:16:21,414
(White) What does Satsuki think about Kirio-kun?

270
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:23,350
(Aimi) No, you're bacca, that's too aggressive.

271
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:25,418
What would he do if he taunts Kirio-kun?

272
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:27,554
(Wave) Yes, take that back.

273
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:31,591
If Satsuki-chan told Kirio-kun, he might be aware of it, right?

274
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,062
If I can't hear Aimi, I'd do it.

275
00:16:36,129 --> 00:16:38,932
(Aimi) No, I'll ask.

276
00:16:44,604 --> 00:16:47,640
(White) Ah, Satsuki-chan is alone.

277
00:16:47,707 --> 00:16:49,642
Aimi-chan First off...

278
00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:51,177
(Aimi) Do you like Kirio-kun?

279
00:16:51,211 --> 00:16:53,947
Do you like Kirio-kun? Do you like Kirio-kun?

280
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:57,417
Do you like Kiriokun? Kiriokun is Kiriokun?

281
00:16:57,484 --> 00:17:00,587
Kikikiri Kirioooookunsky!

282
00:17:00,653 --> 00:17:02,589
mosquito?

283
00:17:05,658 --> 00:17:09,195
(Satsuki) Okunski?

284
00:17:09,262 --> 00:17:11,831
(Aimi) Ah, no...

285
00:17:12,832 --> 00:17:16,136
Sorry... sorry.

286
00:17:22,075 --> 00:17:24,277
(Wave) Ahhh.

287
00:17:25,278 --> 00:17:27,580
Aimi-chan →

288
00:17:27,647 --> 00:17:31,317
Sometimes he's surprisingly clumsy.

289
00:17:32,318 --> 00:17:35,422
(Aimi) I can't say anything.

290
00:17:35,488 --> 00:17:38,224
But it's impossible to hear them when they pass by.

291
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:40,493
(Wave) No one has said that.

292
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,262
(Aimi) So, how do you say to ask?

293
00:17:42,328 --> 00:17:46,399
(Wave) That's easy, just take time after school →

294
00:17:46,466 --> 00:17:48,701
Please come to the back of the gym.

295
00:17:48,768 --> 00:17:52,071
(Aimi) What? Are you stupid, waves! You must be wary.

296
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,776
(Aimi) Wait!

297
00:17:57,777 --> 00:18:00,046
(Satsuki) Momose!

298
00:18:00,113 --> 00:18:02,449
(Aimi) Why did you suddenly come? (Waves) Shh!

299
00:18:02,515 --> 00:18:04,684
(Satsuki) Huh? Kirio: It's not the same.

300
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:07,454
(Momose) You really like Kirio.

301
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,989
(Satsuki) So how many times do you say it, do you know?

302
00:18:10,056 --> 00:18:12,592
Kirio is a friend.

303
00:18:12,659 --> 00:18:16,162
What's with Momose like that? What is your favorite girl?

304
00:18:16,229 --> 00:18:18,565
(Momose) Ah, that's →

305
00:18:18,631 --> 00:18:21,201
Even if you send a message it won't last long.

306
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:22,869
(Satsuki) Hmm.

307
00:18:22,936 --> 00:18:25,371
Well, Momose is probably not going to go anyway →

308
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:28,608
Just like this... (Momose) No.

309
00:18:28,675 --> 00:18:31,044
I'll invite you to play.

310
00:18:32,378 --> 00:18:36,950
(Momose) No, but I'm embarrassed to suddenly say that.

311
00:18:37,016 --> 00:18:40,186
Kirio Can I invite you? Yes, let's do that.

312
00:18:40,253 --> 00:18:43,923
My favorite girl, her friend, me, and Kirio.

313
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:47,160
A double date with the four of us?

314
00:18:47,227 --> 00:18:48,828
(Satsuki) Will Kirio invite him too?

315
00:18:48,895 --> 00:18:52,332
(Momose) Yes. Ah...

316
00:18:52,398 --> 00:18:55,435
Satsuki: Are you lonely to be left out?

317
00:18:55,502 --> 00:18:59,506
(Satsuki) No, not that.

318
00:18:59,572 --> 00:19:04,077
That's kind of saddening Kirio.

319
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,246
(Momose) What? why.

320
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:09,282
(Satsuki) Because about Kirio →

321
00:19:09,349 --> 00:19:12,485
That means you use it to talk to someone you like.

322
00:19:12,552 --> 00:19:14,888
Both us and Momose.

323
00:19:16,289 --> 00:19:17,924
(Momose) Yes?

324
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:19,759
(Satsuki) So true!

325
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:22,729
(Kirio) Oh, Satsuki, Ahhhhh.

326
00:19:22,795 --> 00:19:26,232
(Satsuki) Huh? Momose was also so handsome that he didn't notice it.

327
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:28,468
(Momose) Is it just your face?

328
00:19:28,535 --> 00:19:30,803
My too?

329
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:34,274
(Satsuki) Oh no, no, no, it's a mistake.

330
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:37,210
(Momose) Yes, then, again.

331
00:19:37,277 --> 00:19:39,145
(Satsuki) Again.

332
00:19:44,784 --> 00:19:46,486
(Satsuki) What?

333
00:19:46,553 --> 00:19:48,521
(Aimi) I'll support you so much.

334
00:19:48,588 --> 00:19:50,456
(Wave) Good luck!

335
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:53,860
>> What? What? (Aimi) I'm rooting for you so much.

336
00:19:53,927 --> 00:19:55,562
>> What, it's scary. (Wave) Do your best.

337
00:19:55,628 --> 00:19:57,463
>> What, I really don't know.

338
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:01,301
(Aimi) What's wrong? wave.

339
00:20:03,236 --> 00:20:05,905
(Wave) Aimi-chan.

340
00:20:05,972 --> 00:20:10,710
I think that's probably the person Momose-kun liked earlier.

341
00:20:17,917 --> 00:20:19,652
(Wave) I think it's me. (Aimi) Oh! ? Eh wait a minute.

342
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:21,821
But then, isn't there a possibility that Momose likes might be me?

343
00:20:21,888 --> 00:20:24,257
(White) Aimi-chan Will Momose-kun be receiving a message?

344
00:20:24,324 --> 00:20:28,695
(Aimi) No, not at all. (Wave) So I think it's mine...

345
00:20:28,761 --> 00:20:33,499
We've been coming quite a bit since the four of us exchanged contact details.

346
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:38,638
(Aimi) This guy is insane...

347
00:20:38,705 --> 00:20:41,741
Ah this.

348
00:20:41,808 --> 00:20:45,378
Will the four decide on a double date?

349
00:20:45,445 --> 00:20:50,083
(♪~) (Aimi) So that means you can go to a family restaurant with Kirio-kun???

350
00:20:50,149 --> 00:20:53,586
(♪~) (Aimi) In other words, Momose and the waves stick together →

351
00:20:53,653 --> 00:20:57,156
(♪~) (Aimi) Me and Kirio-kun will automatically stick together...?

352
00:20:57,223 --> 00:21:00,059
(♪～)

353
00:21:00,126 --> 00:21:02,895
(♪~) (Aimi) That's OK! (Wave) What is that? Aimi-chan.

354
00:21:02,962 --> 00:21:05,231
(♪~) I'm completely ignoring my feelings!

355
00:21:05,298 --> 00:21:07,867
(♪~) (Aimi) It's a shame that Nami will be sacrificed.

356
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:11,571
(♪~) Aimi-chan. (Aimi) From now on, Nami & Momose.

357
00:21:11,638 --> 00:21:14,641
(♪~) (Aimi) It's a pair of me and Kirio-kun.

358
00:21:14,707 --> 00:21:17,543
(♪~) (Aimi) Ahhh, it's going to make you feel lonely, the waves are chanting

359
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:20,246
(♪~) That's definitely not the case!

360
00:21:20,313 --> 00:21:24,917
(♪～)

361
00:21:24,984 --> 00:21:26,919
(♪~) (Seirah) No way.

362
00:21:26,986 --> 00:21:31,057
(♪~) >> No no no no no...

363
00:21:31,124 --> 00:21:35,028
(♪~) >> That's... no good.

364
00:21:35,094 --> 00:21:37,764
(♪~) >> Aimi Senpai Nami Senpai.

365
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:42,869
(♪~) >> I definitely don't want that to happen!

366
00:21:44,203 --> 00:21:46,539
(Aimi) One-shot jokes are done!

367
00:21:47,106 --> 00:21:50,476
(Seirah) A truly miraculous encounter! Friendship!

368
00:21:50,543 --> 00:21:53,813
(Aimi) Kirio-kun's casual clothes are either uncool or uncool.

369
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,948
(Wave) Clothes that only have the hoodie part →

370
00:21:56,015 --> 00:21:58,785
What if you wear it? (Aimi) Where's the hoodie?
