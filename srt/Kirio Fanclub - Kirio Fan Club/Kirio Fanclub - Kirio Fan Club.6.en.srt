1
00:00:05,306 --> 00:00:07,141
(Aimi) What should I do? Waves.

2
00:00:07,208 --> 00:00:10,845
It's really come true... A date with Kirio-kun.

3
00:00:10,911 --> 00:00:12,580
(Wave) Studying outside school.

4
00:00:12,646 --> 00:00:17,318
(Aimi) It's dangerous, Kirio-kun's casual clothes, and dies normally.

5
00:00:17,385 --> 00:00:19,286
(Momose) Kirio Quickly.

6
00:00:21,455 --> 00:00:25,026
(Wave) I'll prepare to show you a wonderful side.

7
00:00:25,092 --> 00:00:28,429
(Aimi) So let's show off a wonderful side to one competition.

8
00:00:28,496 --> 00:00:30,731
(Wave) Understood, it's a competition to show off a wonderful side.

9
00:00:30,798 --> 00:00:33,334
(Aimi) Oh, it's a competition to show off your wonderful side!

10
00:00:33,401 --> 00:00:35,870
What is that "lol" (Wave) Hahaha... "lol"

11
00:00:38,572 --> 00:00:55,523
(♪～)

12
00:00:55,589 --> 00:01:12,473
(♪～)

13
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:18,179
(♪～)

14
00:01:20,381 --> 00:01:22,049
(Momose) Ah, it's salmon.

15
00:01:22,083 --> 00:01:25,519
Hey, which one do you like, salmon, salmon, or salmon? Me, salmon.

16
00:01:29,924 --> 00:01:35,663
(Momose) It's huge and amazing. (Mitsuda) My impression is that I am elementary school student.

17
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:37,698
(Momose) Huh? What's that?

18
00:01:38,999 --> 00:01:40,634
(Aimi) Kirio-kun do you know?

19
00:01:40,701 --> 00:01:42,803
How much food a sperm whale eats per day →

20
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:44,772
It's about a tonne.

21
00:01:44,839 --> 00:01:47,741
(Kirio) Wow, that much? (Aimi) Then there's a makoto →

22
00:01:47,808 --> 00:01:50,778
It is said that he once fought back a whaling ship and sunk it →

23
00:01:50,845 --> 00:01:54,548
It is said that there are also cases where there are individuals with a rough temperament.

24
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:57,251
(White) Aimi-chan is erudite and highly recommended!

25
00:01:57,318 --> 00:01:59,386
A wonderful side to show off the competition is serious!

26
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:01,489
(Aimi) Sperm is present on Earth →

27
00:02:01,555 --> 00:02:03,991
The largest of the creatures with teeth →

28
00:02:04,058 --> 00:02:05,726
Over 1000m deep →

29
00:02:05,793 --> 00:02:08,295
You can dive without taking a breath.

30
00:02:08,362 --> 00:02:10,531
(Kirio) Wow.

31
00:02:10,598 --> 00:02:13,133
(Waves) Ah, I'm snuggling with my glasses that I don't have.

32
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,236
(Momose) Someya's That Camera?

33
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:19,039
(Wave) Ah, this is a used up camera.

34
00:02:19,106 --> 00:02:21,976
(Momose) Ah, you may have heard of something.

35
00:02:22,042 --> 00:02:25,012
You don't know until you develop what kind of photos you can take

36
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:28,883
(Wave) Yes, it's fine to take a picture with your smartphone, but →

37
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:33,387
After all, I want to leave these kinds of memories in real life.

38
00:02:33,454 --> 00:02:36,857
I've only had one field trip with everyone.

39
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:42,496
(Momose) Someya-san, you're so emo.

40
00:02:46,567 --> 00:02:52,273
(Aimi) A wonderful side The winner of the show-and-see competition is Nami.

41
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:54,575
What is it? Not your own good?

42
00:02:54,642 --> 00:02:56,777
How do you make everyone look wonderful?

43
00:02:56,844 --> 00:02:59,113
If you do that, you're at a loss!

44
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:02,683
(White) Aimi... (Aimi) Ah, damn it.

45
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:05,953
Kirio-kun must have been thrilled too.

46
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:08,923
Ah, I'm about to vomit now.

47
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:11,926
Thank you Wave Photos I'm so damn excited.

48
00:03:11,992 --> 00:03:15,796
What? I'm almost crying.

49
00:03:15,863 --> 00:03:19,466
Huh? (White) Aimi-chan Emotionally unstable.

50
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:25,940
(Waves) Huh? What about Mitsuda-kun and Kirio-kun?

51
00:03:26,006 --> 00:03:27,975
(Momose) No, they're them →

52
00:03:28,042 --> 00:03:30,077
I went somewhere while I was still there.

53
00:03:30,144 --> 00:03:34,081
(Aimi) What... >> It's really not cooperative.

54
00:03:34,148 --> 00:03:36,116
So turn it with three of us.

55
00:03:36,183 --> 00:03:37,885
(Wave) That's right.

56
00:03:37,952 --> 00:03:41,722
>> Oh, that's so funny, let's go

57
00:03:41,789 --> 00:03:46,427
(Aimi) Aaaaahhhhhh.

58
00:03:46,493 --> 00:03:49,229
(White) Aimi-chan? Are you okay?

59
00:03:49,296 --> 00:03:53,767
(Aimi) Ahhhh...

60
00:03:53,834 --> 00:03:56,870
(Wave) What's wrong, Aimi-chan? (Aimi) What about Kirio-kun?

61
00:03:56,937 --> 00:03:58,539
(Waves) There's it's okay, it's okay.

62
00:03:58,606 --> 00:04:01,108
(Aimi) I haven't shown the good points yet.

63
00:04:04,678 --> 00:04:07,481
(Mitsuda) I also got some rare incense that could be used in Jujutsu.

64
00:04:07,615 --> 00:04:10,517
Ahhh...

65
00:04:10,684 --> 00:04:13,787
Sperm...

66
00:04:16,323 --> 00:04:17,958
(Mitsuda) Huh?

67
00:04:18,025 --> 00:04:19,960
Kirio-san?

68
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:24,264
(Mitsuta) Kirio-san...?

69
00:04:25,366 --> 00:04:27,134
(Kirio) Ah Mitsuda.

70
00:04:27,201 --> 00:04:30,004
(Mitsuda) You're not the same as everyone else.

71
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,506
(Kirio) Ah...

72
00:04:32,573 --> 00:04:34,241
Just a moment.

73
00:04:34,308 --> 00:04:36,377
(Mitsuda) It seems like everyone is still in the museum.

74
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:38,912
I have to meet up soon...

75
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:42,216
(Kirio) I wonder if I'll take a rest until everyone comes here.

76
00:04:44,018 --> 00:04:45,753
"Notification sound"

77
00:04:47,121 --> 00:04:49,790
(Mitsuta) He's in a museum shop...

78
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:55,963
(Kirio) Anyway...it's fine even if I'm not there.

79
00:04:58,432 --> 00:05:01,402
(Aimi) They're the same group as Kirio-kun!

80
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:04,271
(White) Thank you Mitsuta-kun!

81
00:05:04,338 --> 00:05:06,807
(Mitsuda) Kirio-san. (Kirio) Yes?

82
00:05:06,874 --> 00:05:11,045
(Mitsuda) What do you think of Miyoshi and Someya?

83
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:14,581
(Kirio) What... what?

84
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:17,584
(Mitsuta) No, what do you mean...

85
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:20,754
It's just a matter of what you think as a person!

86
00:05:22,456 --> 00:05:24,191
(Kirio) As a person...

87
00:05:26,393 --> 00:05:30,297
(Kirio) Those two are always the same →

88
00:05:30,364 --> 00:05:32,900
Being good friends →

89
00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:36,136
I'm dazzling.

90
00:05:36,203 --> 00:05:38,706
that's why….

91
00:05:38,772 --> 00:05:41,709
I guess it's going to be tough.

92
00:05:41,775 --> 00:05:44,244
(Mitsuda) What?

93
00:05:44,311 --> 00:05:46,380
(Kirio) Me →

94
00:05:46,447 --> 00:05:49,983
It's painful to think it's fun.

95
00:05:54,621 --> 00:05:58,358
(Mitsuda) Is this something that Kirio-san can't do?

96
00:05:58,425 --> 00:06:00,694
I think it's fun.

97
00:06:08,268 --> 00:06:11,338
(Mitsuta) I was like that until a while ago.

98
00:06:11,405 --> 00:06:13,941
I can't be honest →

99
00:06:14,007 --> 00:06:16,043
Cursing your situation →

100
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:18,846
I'm annoyed by everything →

101
00:06:18,912 --> 00:06:22,116
Of course, it's boring.

102
00:06:22,182 --> 00:06:25,986
But one day I thought so.

103
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:28,856
"Ah, it's fun."

104
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,927
(Mitsuda) That's not a misunderstanding or mistake →

105
00:06:33,994 --> 00:06:36,130
I don't think it's a different way to suppress it.

106
00:06:37,431 --> 00:06:41,101
(Mitsuda) There's no way you can't have fun, probably.

107
00:06:43,036 --> 00:06:44,838
(Mitsuda) That's why Kirio-san.

108
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:48,842
It might be good to be honest at times like this

109
00:06:50,611 --> 00:06:53,347
(Mitsuta) Ah... sorry for being so arrogant.

110
00:06:55,282 --> 00:06:58,552
(Momose) Oh, I'm so happy.

111
00:06:58,619 --> 00:07:01,255
(Aimi) Now~｡ (Mitsuta) What is that outfit?

112
00:07:01,321 --> 00:07:05,058
(Momose) Oh. Jan!

113
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:08,028
Somehow, Miyoshi suddenly started buying it.

114
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:09,897
Let's all have matching ones together.

115
00:07:09,963 --> 00:07:12,933
Hi, this is Mitsuda's.

116
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,701
(Mitsuda) What...

117
00:07:16,336 --> 00:07:18,205
(Aimi) Kirio-kun.

118
00:07:19,873 --> 00:07:22,176
Yes, this is Kirio-kun's thing.

119
00:07:22,242 --> 00:07:24,378
(Kirio) Thank you...

120
00:07:43,163 --> 00:07:45,098
(Mitsuda) Sperm. >> “Camera shutter sound”

121
00:07:45,165 --> 00:07:48,001
Hehehe... “lol”

122
00:07:48,068 --> 00:07:49,803
Sperm.

123
00:07:49,870 --> 00:08:04,985
(♪～)

124
00:08:05,052 --> 00:08:10,824
(♪~) (Hope) Ah hahaha...

125
00:08:10,891 --> 00:08:13,760
Ken-kun is really interesting.

126
00:08:20,901 --> 00:08:22,803
(Nozomi) Ken-kun.

127
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:26,240
This is the best. (Kirio, a junior high school student) Right?

128
00:08:26,306 --> 00:08:28,208
(Looking) Thank you. (Kirio, junior high school student) Yes.

129
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:35,349
(Kirio, junior high school student) Nozomi.

130
00:08:37,551 --> 00:08:39,419
(Kirio, junior high school student) Isn't it okay?

131
00:08:40,787 --> 00:08:42,789
(Looking) Huh?

132
00:08:45,425 --> 00:08:47,694
(Kirio, a junior high school student) He won't die, right?

133
00:08:57,704 --> 00:08:59,373
(Kirio, junior high school student) Oh... I don't want to.

134
00:08:59,439 --> 00:09:01,275
Why? I don't understand!

135
00:09:01,341 --> 00:09:03,677
Even in high school, do you do it together? (Nozomi) Ken-kun.

136
00:09:03,744 --> 00:09:05,612
(Kirio, a junior high school student) If I'm no good then →

137
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:07,681
What should I do? (Nozomi) Ken-kun.

138
00:09:07,748 --> 00:09:11,218
Ken-kun is →

139
00:09:11,285 --> 00:09:13,553
LOL.

140
00:09:15,355 --> 00:09:20,093
(Nozomi) Ken-kun is about me →

141
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,231
He's been making me laugh forever.

142
00:09:25,699 --> 00:09:29,536
(Want to do so) So →

143
00:09:29,603 --> 00:09:32,272
Don't cry, Ken.

144
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:37,210
(Looking) Because →

145
00:09:37,277 --> 00:09:41,181
If Ken was laughing →

146
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:43,216
I….

147
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,721
(Want to do) Always.

148
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:54,127
(Want to do) Surely.

149
00:09:55,429 --> 00:10:00,000
(Looking) Absolute →

150
00:10:00,067 --> 00:10:02,102
Because I'll live.

151
00:10:08,241 --> 00:10:11,278
(Kirio, junior high school student) Sorry, that's right.

152
00:10:11,345 --> 00:10:13,013
That's right.

153
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,781
Hope will not die.

154
00:10:14,848 --> 00:10:17,651
I won't die →

155
00:10:17,718 --> 00:10:22,856
I'll laugh until Nozomi gets better.

156
00:10:22,923 --> 00:10:25,459
Even after that, I'll keep laughing.

157
00:10:25,525 --> 00:10:30,197
And me...me...

158
00:10:30,263 --> 00:10:31,898
(Looking) In the bathtub →

159
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:34,401
Poop floats.

160
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:36,436
Right? (Kirio, junior high school student) Yes.

161
00:10:36,503 --> 00:10:39,139
I'm floating in the bathtub!

162
00:10:39,206 --> 00:10:41,908
Hahaha... “lol” (no) Hahaha... “lol”

163
00:10:47,781 --> 00:10:50,017
(Kirio, junior high school student) Hahaha... "lol" Yes.

164
00:10:57,224 --> 00:11:01,094
(Mitsuta's voice) There's no way you can't enjoy it, maybe.

165
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:05,665
(Kirio) Don't put it simply.

166
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:19,312
(♪～)

167
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:22,215
(♪~) >> For me, it's already...

168
00:11:22,282 --> 00:11:29,256
(♪～)

169
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:58,919
(Aimi) What?

170
00:11:58,985 --> 00:12:00,987
(Wave) Huh?

171
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:04,024
(Aimi) Just now the waves →

172
00:12:04,091 --> 00:12:06,326
In the hallway... →

173
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:07,994
With Kirio-kun... →

174
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:10,630
Did you talk about something?

175
00:12:10,697 --> 00:12:14,901
(Wave) What? Ah...yeah.

176
00:12:14,968 --> 00:12:17,871
(Aimi) Oh!

177
00:12:17,938 --> 00:12:19,539
That's right.

178
00:12:19,606 --> 00:12:23,243
What? picture? What were you talking about? ? ?

179
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:26,179
Ah, not particularly? ? ?

180
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:27,848
Is it okay? ? ? ?

181
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:30,517
Not particularly? ? ? Roughly? ? ?

182
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:32,953
That's fine, isn't it? ? ? (Wave) Yes.

183
00:12:34,187 --> 00:12:36,189
Secret~~~.

184
00:12:38,024 --> 00:12:40,060
(Aimi) Don't ride it!

185
00:12:40,127 --> 00:12:42,195
(Wave) Wow! Sorry, I understand!

186
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:44,564
So, a quiz. (Aimi) Ah?

187
00:12:44,631 --> 00:12:48,068
(White) 1 A story about Kirio-kun's hobbies.

188
00:12:48,135 --> 00:12:51,771
2. A story about Kirio-kun's future.

189
00:12:51,838 --> 00:12:55,675
3 Kirio-kun's childhood dream.

190
00:12:55,742 --> 00:13:01,081
4. A story about someone you're interested in, Kirio-kun.

191
00:13:01,148 --> 00:13:02,949
(Aimi) 5 Talk about the weather!

192
00:13:03,016 --> 00:13:04,918
(Wave) Don't increase your options without permission.

193
00:13:04,985 --> 00:13:08,355
(Aimi) Wait forever, it's impossible. Four options I don't like all of them though.

194
00:13:08,421 --> 00:13:10,857
(Wave) Please choose one of these.

195
00:13:10,924 --> 00:13:12,959
(Aimi) No no I don't want to choose one.

196
00:13:13,026 --> 00:13:15,529
I don't want to choose everything!

197
00:13:15,595 --> 00:13:18,298
Yes, that's right!

198
00:13:18,365 --> 00:13:21,368
I don't need anything anymore!

199
00:13:21,434 --> 00:13:23,837
That's right.

200
00:13:23,904 --> 00:13:27,707
Let's live a life without choosing anything anymore

201
00:13:27,774 --> 00:13:30,243
(Wave) Minimalist♪

202
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,546
I won't tell you unless I choose.

203
00:13:34,414 --> 00:13:38,952
(Aimi) Aaaaa!

204
00:13:41,922 --> 00:13:43,523
１。

205
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:45,392
Kirio-kun's...a hobby...

206
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:47,727
(Waves) Don't hear it.

207
00:13:47,794 --> 00:13:50,330
(Aimi) 1 A story about Kirio-kun's hobbies...

208
00:13:50,397 --> 00:13:51,998
(Waves) Bang.

209
00:13:52,065 --> 00:13:53,667
(Aimi) 2. Kirio-kun's future.

210
00:13:53,733 --> 00:13:55,468
(Waves) Bang.

211
00:13:55,535 --> 00:13:57,971
(Aimi) 3 Kirio-kun's young... (Waves) Bang.

212
00:13:58,038 --> 00:13:59,906
(Aimi) What...

213
00:13:59,973 --> 00:14:02,275
Well then...

214
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:04,511
(Wave) The correct answer is 4.

215
00:14:04,578 --> 00:14:08,215
It was about someone I was interested in, Kirio-kun.

216
00:14:11,751 --> 00:14:13,587
(White) Aimi-chan, sorry.

217
00:14:13,653 --> 00:14:16,590
I'm actually about Sakirio-kun →

218
00:14:16,656 --> 00:14:18,391
I'm alone →

219
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:20,827
I'm going to have you let me do it!

220
00:14:23,096 --> 00:14:26,266
Hey, Aimi-chan?

221
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:30,070
Wow, hard! Cold! Sorry Aimi-chan, you're kidding!

222
00:14:30,136 --> 00:14:31,938
The person Kirio-kun is interested in is →

223
00:14:32,005 --> 00:14:35,609
It's about Tanaka-sensei! (Aimi) What?

224
00:14:35,675 --> 00:14:39,946
(Waves) Look, the teacher's cough and runny nose were amazing during today's English class, right?

225
00:14:40,013 --> 00:14:44,251
So he just said to Kirio-kun, "Tanaka-sensei has a cold."

226
00:14:44,317 --> 00:14:48,021
So you don't have to worry about that... (Aimi) Ugh.

227
00:14:48,088 --> 00:14:51,291
(Wave) So sorry.

228
00:14:52,292 --> 00:14:55,028
(Aimi) And what about Kirio-kun? (Wave) What?

229
00:14:55,095 --> 00:14:57,797
(Aimi) What did Kirio say?

230
00:14:57,864 --> 00:14:59,899
(Wave) Keep facing forward →

231
00:14:59,966 --> 00:15:03,370
Just saying, "Ah, that's right..."

232
00:15:03,436 --> 00:15:06,940
So it wasn't in the conversation

233
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:08,775
(Aimi) That's...

234
00:15:08,842 --> 00:15:11,778
You're probably interested.

235
00:15:11,845 --> 00:15:15,782
But it's true that Kirio-kun is doing well recently.

236
00:15:15,849 --> 00:15:17,517
(Waves) That's right...

237
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:21,187
(Aimi) Since studying outside school, Kirio-kun hasn't had an approaching event...

238
00:15:23,323 --> 00:15:25,792
Shall I send you a message?

239
00:15:25,859 --> 00:15:28,495
(Wave) Wow Aimi-chan is aggressive!

240
00:15:28,561 --> 00:15:33,667
(Aimi) Well? See, too? Have you been backing up lately?

241
00:15:33,733 --> 00:15:37,203
About this? That's how it can be done, right?

242
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:43,443
>> "Notification sound"

243
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:50,350
(Aimi) Hey, sorry, this is the rainbow, a little correction...

244
00:15:50,417 --> 00:15:54,020
yeah? What's up? wave. (Wave) What? Ah... uhh.

245
00:15:54,087 --> 00:15:56,356
(Aimi) What is that?

246
00:15:57,590 --> 00:16:01,661
Haaaaah, did you send it to Kirio-kun first?

247
00:16:01,728 --> 00:16:03,763
Show me a bit! (Wave) No, it's not...

248
00:16:06,433 --> 00:16:11,071
(Aimi) What do Momose wants to talk about?

249
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:13,373
(Waves) 5. Talk about the weather.

250
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,442
(Aimi) That's the case, isn't it?

251
00:16:15,508 --> 00:16:18,345
So what are you going to do? Are you going to date? With Momose.

252
00:16:18,411 --> 00:16:20,013
(Wave) What are you talking about Aimi!

253
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:23,883
(Aimi) Nami: Feel free to leave Kirio-kun to me.

254
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:25,585
(Wave) Don't say anything you like.

255
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:29,356
Also, it's not that he's ever confirmed that he'll be confessed to.

256
00:16:29,422 --> 00:16:32,025
(Aimi) No, no matter how you look at it, it's a confession.

257
00:16:32,092 --> 00:16:35,161
I had realised it was a wave, so Momose felt like it was a feeling.

258
00:16:35,228 --> 00:16:37,864
(Wave) That's...

259
00:16:37,931 --> 00:16:39,766
(Aimi) Don't go.

260
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:43,103
It means that you've reached the point where you can't ignore it.

261
00:16:46,306 --> 00:16:49,809
(Aimi) Come on, come quickly.

262
00:16:49,876 --> 00:16:52,479
Momose-kun is waiting.

263
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:59,552
(Momose) Sorry, call me.

264
00:16:59,719 --> 00:17:01,621
(Wave) Yes.

265
00:17:03,757 --> 00:17:06,860
(Aimi) Wow, this time has finally arrived.

266
00:17:06,926 --> 00:17:10,997
The waves say "Fufu" →

267
00:17:11,064 --> 00:17:12,966
I don't think I can refuse.

268
00:17:43,063 --> 00:17:45,532
(Aimi) Wow, that's dangerous!

269
00:17:45,598 --> 00:17:48,368
Don't tell me about something cliched, Peach.

270
00:17:48,435 --> 00:17:51,704
>> Be honest →

271
00:17:51,771 --> 00:17:53,873
I fell in love at first sight.

272
00:17:54,941 --> 00:17:57,777
I saw Tokisometani at the entrance ceremony →

273
00:17:57,844 --> 00:18:00,980
Zun Dong Bang?

274
00:18:01,047 --> 00:18:03,249
It's coming...

275
00:18:03,316 --> 00:18:05,885
(Aimi) Onomatopoeia is too bad. >> So that →

276
00:18:05,952 --> 00:18:08,822
They will be in the same class in two years →

277
00:18:08,888 --> 00:18:11,558
Suge~ I was happy.

278
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:14,260
On my last outdoor study →

279
00:18:14,327 --> 00:18:18,064
I feel that not only his face but his insides are good too.

280
00:18:18,131 --> 00:18:20,533
So that's it...

281
00:18:25,004 --> 00:18:27,040
Please go out with me.

282
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,209
With me.

283
00:18:34,013 --> 00:18:36,382
(Wave) Thank you.

284
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:39,919
But I'm sorry.

285
00:18:42,856 --> 00:18:44,457
Me →

286
00:18:44,524 --> 00:18:47,327
There's someone else I think of.

287
00:18:51,731 --> 00:18:54,901
>>Huh...

288
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:58,304
I see...

289
00:19:00,573 --> 00:19:03,910
yeah? "I'm thinking" →

290
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:06,880
Do you mean you like it?

291
00:19:06,946 --> 00:19:10,283
(Wave) Yes I like it...

292
00:19:13,786 --> 00:19:18,191
(Wave) I was almost in love with it at first sight too.

293
00:19:18,258 --> 00:19:20,693
It's the same as Momose-kun.

294
00:19:22,762 --> 00:19:24,364
But →

295
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:29,002
In my case, Momose-kun hugged me →

296
00:19:29,068 --> 00:19:34,974
Maybe it's a little different to the way you like it.

297
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:36,709
So →

298
00:19:36,776 --> 00:19:38,511
Momose-kun is amazing.

299
00:19:38,578 --> 00:19:40,446
This is how it was conveyed straightforward.

300
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:44,384
>> No...it's not that very.

301
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:46,686
I've been dumped.

302
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:51,925
Someya-san won't tell you?

303
00:19:51,991 --> 00:19:53,893
That feeling.

304
00:19:55,428 --> 00:19:58,865
(Wave) I guess it's not possible...

305
00:19:58,932 --> 00:20:02,602
Because I'm →

306
00:20:02,669 --> 00:20:06,339
Because he is timid and has no way.

307
00:20:06,406 --> 00:20:10,944
By the side, always →

308
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:14,013
All I can do is sneakily look at.

309
00:20:15,915 --> 00:20:19,185
But even so...

310
00:20:20,587 --> 00:20:23,456
Yes.

311
00:20:23,523 --> 00:20:25,558
I think that's good.

312
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:33,099
>> I really like it.

313
00:20:34,801 --> 00:20:38,471
Yabbe, I'm jealous.

314
00:20:38,538 --> 00:20:41,874
Or who is that?

315
00:20:41,941 --> 00:20:44,310
Maybe I'm an acquaintance?

316
00:20:44,377 --> 00:20:46,179
Ah, maybe...

317
00:20:46,246 --> 00:20:49,949
(Wave) I won't say it.

318
00:20:50,016 --> 00:20:53,553
I can't say it... to anyone.

319
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:10,069
