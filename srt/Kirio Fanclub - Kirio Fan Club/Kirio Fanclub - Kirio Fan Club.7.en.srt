1
00:00:08,876 --> 00:00:11,379
(Aimi) Uhhhh.

2
00:00:11,445 --> 00:00:14,949
Uhhhh.

3
00:00:15,116 --> 00:00:19,153
(Momoko) Aimi-chan Hey, Aimi-chan (Aimi) Huh?

4
00:00:19,153 --> 00:00:22,723
(Momoko) I'm coming soon~ Let's go (Aimi) No way.

5
00:00:22,723 --> 00:00:25,760
Because I haven't found a flat stone yet.

6
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,898
(Miyu) Hey, it's already gone. (Aimi) Yes. I'll search by myself.

7
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:33,768
(Momoko) Let's go.

8
00:00:33,834 --> 00:00:37,705
(Miyu) Aimi-chan always, Ahhhh.

9
00:00:37,772 --> 00:00:39,707
(Momoko) So hot.

10
00:00:41,809 --> 00:00:44,478
(Aimi) Oh, this is nice.

11
00:00:46,614 --> 00:00:48,215
I did it!

12
00:00:48,282 --> 00:00:52,386
(♪～)

13
00:00:52,453 --> 00:00:56,524
(♪~) (Aimi, a junior high school student) Ah, that cloud, this is the shape of a poop.

14
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:59,460
(♪～)

15
00:00:59,527 --> 00:01:01,128
(♪~) (Aimi) Ah... do you know?

16
00:01:01,195 --> 00:01:03,264
(♪~) (Aimi) Actually, the fact that human butts are split...

17
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:05,866
(♪~) (Rino) Um, Miyoshi-san.

18
00:01:05,933 --> 00:01:07,535
(♪~) (Aimi) Yes.

19
00:01:07,601 --> 00:01:11,038
(♪~) (Rino) I want to stop going home with me now.

20
00:01:11,105 --> 00:01:13,874
(♪~) >> We are told by the teacher.

21
00:01:13,941 --> 00:01:15,543
(♪~) >> Because Miyoshi is alone →

22
00:01:15,609 --> 00:01:17,611
(♪~) >> Please let me join.

23
00:01:17,678 --> 00:01:21,615
(♪~) >> I'm a class representative and it's close to my house.

24
00:01:21,682 --> 00:01:24,885
(♪~) (Hiyori) The atmosphere is somehow different.

25
00:01:24,952 --> 00:01:28,656
(♪~) >> I don't think it fits with our group...

26
00:01:28,722 --> 00:01:30,324
(♪~) (Rino) So... →

27
00:01:30,391 --> 00:01:33,828
(♪~) >> Please go home alone from tomorrow!

28
00:01:33,894 --> 00:01:36,063
(Hiyori) Let's go.

29
00:01:40,734 --> 00:01:48,809
"The sound of kicking stones"

30
00:01:57,184 --> 00:01:58,786
"The sound of knocking on the door"

31
00:01:58,853 --> 00:02:00,754
(Toranosuke) Hey, Aimi Let's go in.

32
00:02:00,821 --> 00:02:02,823
"The sound of the door opening"

33
00:02:04,425 --> 00:02:06,393
Yes, rice crackers.

34
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:09,597
(Aimi) Hey, Grandpa, that's it...

35
00:02:09,663 --> 00:02:12,233
>> Huh? what up.

36
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:14,168
(Aimi) Being alone →

37
00:02:14,235 --> 00:02:16,470
Is it that bad?

38
00:02:18,405 --> 00:02:21,709
Do you have to have friends?

39
00:02:21,775 --> 00:02:25,513
>> A friend.

40
00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:28,549
Well, there's no need to force it to make it, right?

41
00:02:28,616 --> 00:02:30,618
(Aimi) What? Hey, that's it!

42
00:02:30,684 --> 00:02:32,586
It's okay if you're not there.

43
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:36,090
>> Rather, it's not to make it →

44
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:41,028
Before I knew it, the one next to me was my friend.

45
00:02:42,096 --> 00:02:44,832
Aimi also had someone like that, and when she got it →

46
00:02:44,899 --> 00:02:47,034
Take good care of it.

47
00:02:48,369 --> 00:02:51,739
(Aimi) I don't know, that's it.

48
00:02:51,805 --> 00:02:54,775
Because I had friends →

49
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:56,710
There's no one.

50
00:03:03,317 --> 00:03:05,319
(Blue Beauty) wave….

51
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:10,157
(Wave) We are friends, right?

52
00:03:10,224 --> 00:03:13,060
(Aimi) No, it's a rival.

53
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:20,234
different! Different, different, different!

54
00:03:20,301 --> 00:03:22,369
It's so funny...

55
00:03:22,436 --> 00:03:26,373
It's so funny...it's so funny!

56
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,910
Chiggy Chiggy Chiggy Chiggy Chiggy Chiggy Chiggy Chiggy Chiggy!

57
00:03:29,977 --> 00:03:33,981
(Male) Should I use jigame hotpot for dinner today?

58
00:03:34,048 --> 00:03:35,716
Okay.

59
00:03:39,153 --> 00:03:56,103
(♪～)

60
00:03:56,170 --> 00:04:13,053
(♪～)

61
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:18,826
(♪～)

62
00:04:20,361 --> 00:04:23,564
(Seira) There's too little spring break event.

63
00:04:23,631 --> 00:04:27,801
I tried to observe Kirio-senpai, but he didn't go to club activities.

64
00:04:27,868 --> 00:04:30,304
Manager: Can I go home?

65
00:04:30,371 --> 00:04:32,473
(Morino) That's a problem, Tashiro-san.

66
00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:34,808
(Seirah) Hmm.

67
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,477
"Chimes that announce visitors"

68
00:04:36,543 --> 00:04:38,612
(Seira) You're here...sorry.

69
00:04:38,679 --> 00:04:41,815
There are two of them. >> ＼Please come with your favorite seat.

70
00:04:45,252 --> 00:04:47,054
(Shora) Ah, customer!

71
00:04:47,121 --> 00:04:50,290
yes. (Shora) Those seats are my favorite seats...

72
00:04:50,357 --> 00:04:52,926
No, it's a reserved seat.

73
00:04:52,993 --> 00:04:54,628
Please come to this seat.

74
00:04:54,695 --> 00:04:57,097
Ah yes. (Seirah) Yes.

75
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:08,208
(Morino) When did you know?

76
00:05:08,275 --> 00:05:10,844
sorry….

77
00:05:12,346 --> 00:05:13,947
"The sound of opening doors"

78
00:05:14,014 --> 00:05:15,616
(Seira) Manager.

79
00:05:15,683 --> 00:05:17,918
(Morino) Ah, thank you for your hard work.

80
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:19,687
(Seirah) Did you enjoy life?

81
00:05:19,753 --> 00:05:22,790
(Morino) Huh? Will I be killed now?

82
00:05:24,925 --> 00:05:27,528
(Seirah) What are you talking about, it's not true.

83
00:05:27,594 --> 00:05:29,830
It's about whether you have any regrets in life.

84
00:05:29,897 --> 00:05:34,001
(Morino) That's a line exclusively for those who are pointing at the gun Tashiro-san.

85
00:05:35,602 --> 00:05:38,739
(Morino) Are you worried about life or regret it?

86
00:05:39,773 --> 00:05:41,975
(Seirah) That's...

87
00:05:42,976 --> 00:05:45,112
(Seirah) It's simply too much fun life →

88
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:48,549
I wanted to hear some opinions that aren't the case.

89
00:05:48,615 --> 00:05:51,685
(Morino) Tashiro-san is so rude that it makes me numb.

90
00:05:51,752 --> 00:05:54,488
But I don't hate it.

91
00:05:56,690 --> 00:06:00,861
(Morino) Of course I have regrets.

92
00:06:00,928 --> 00:06:03,397
I was in a band when I was a student.

93
00:06:03,464 --> 00:06:06,033
I was so bad that I broke up.

94
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,102
(Seirah) Reason for the breakup: That's interesting.

95
00:06:08,168 --> 00:06:10,471
(Morino) I wonder if I should practice more then →

96
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:15,409
I'm full of regrets about having talent in the first place.

97
00:06:15,476 --> 00:06:20,013
But I might like to regret it quite a bit.

98
00:06:21,081 --> 00:06:24,451
(Morino) Because regret is, so to speak, →

99
00:06:24,518 --> 00:06:26,920
Because it's growing pains.

100
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:30,457
(Seirah) Growth pain? (Morino) Yes.

101
00:06:30,524 --> 00:06:32,993
In fact, thanks to that failure at that time →

102
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:37,097
Now I've improved and I'm starting a relaxed, fun, and end up in a band of old men.

103
00:06:37,164 --> 00:06:41,268
So I'll still be able to fail and regret life →

104
00:06:41,335 --> 00:06:43,437
Looking at Tashiro-san and those kids →

105
00:06:43,504 --> 00:06:47,307
It's kind of exciting to me too.

106
00:06:47,374 --> 00:06:48,976
(Seira) Manager. (Morino) Huh?

107
00:06:49,042 --> 00:06:50,644
(Seirah) Have you left anything you said?

108
00:06:50,711 --> 00:06:52,846
(Morino) Huh? Will I be killed after all?

109
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:26,446
(Tanaka) I'm a third year student starting today.

110
00:07:26,847 --> 00:07:32,186
Take classes with the aim of taking the exam carefully.

111
00:07:32,252 --> 00:07:35,656
Of course, spend time with this member →

112
00:07:35,722 --> 00:07:38,325
It's the last year →

113
00:07:38,392 --> 00:07:43,497
I want them to have fun and have lots of memories together, but →

114
00:07:43,564 --> 00:07:46,600
Don't neglect your studies.

115
00:07:46,667 --> 00:07:51,505
At the end of this month, the first mock exam will be held in his third year.

116
00:07:51,572 --> 00:07:53,440
And one more thing.

117
00:07:53,507 --> 00:07:56,677
Providing a career path request survey.

118
00:07:58,745 --> 00:08:00,848
(White) Aimi-chan!

119
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:04,551
(Aimi) What...huh?

120
00:08:04,618 --> 00:08:08,288
(Wave) It's not "Aaaah!" I was worried!

121
00:08:08,355 --> 00:08:10,557
(Aimi) What... what?

122
00:08:10,624 --> 00:08:16,230
(Wave) Why did things go wrong throughout spring break?

123
00:08:16,296 --> 00:08:20,000
Aimi-chan, what's up?

124
00:08:20,067 --> 00:08:23,003
(Aimi) What do you think...

125
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:24,838
You are the one, what's wrong?

126
00:08:24,905 --> 00:08:26,507
(Wave) What?

127
00:08:26,573 --> 00:08:29,409
(Aimi) It's about Momose. Did you get told?

128
00:08:30,744 --> 00:08:34,081
(Wave) You're sure you refused.

129
00:08:34,147 --> 00:08:39,052
(Aimi) Why? (Wave) Why is it obvious!

130
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:44,358
(Aimi) Ah, I see, that's obvious!

131
00:08:44,424 --> 00:08:47,227
Because the waves... →

132
00:08:47,294 --> 00:08:50,998
Nami also likes Kirio-kun.

133
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,338
So we were all from the beginning...

134
00:08:59,406 --> 00:09:01,942
And... and...just quickly.

135
00:09:02,009 --> 00:09:05,078
My friends are also a little bit.

136
00:09:05,145 --> 00:09:06,747
That's ok!

137
00:09:06,813 --> 00:09:09,149
(White) What, Aimi!

138
00:09:10,284 --> 00:09:12,452
(Aimi) It wasn't important to me from the beginning.

139
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:16,323
It was different at first, but before I knew it, it was important...

140
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:20,727
Not just one important thing →

141
00:09:20,794 --> 00:09:22,396
If I were alone, I would have been alone →

142
00:09:22,462 --> 00:09:24,965
As the two of us, there are more and more things we want to cherish...

143
00:09:25,032 --> 00:09:27,634
(Wave) Wait a minute, Aimi!

144
00:09:30,537 --> 00:09:33,740
(Aimi) Haa haa...

145
00:09:33,807 --> 00:09:36,576
(White) Aimi-chan.

146
00:09:36,643 --> 00:09:38,912
Let's talk properly.

147
00:09:38,979 --> 00:09:42,416
Have you ever wanted to say something?

148
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,920
(Aimi) I don't know, how I feel!

149
00:09:46,987 --> 00:09:49,957
(Wave) I don't know, I don't know, but →

150
00:09:50,023 --> 00:09:53,360
I don't know, so I want to know, I'm friends.

151
00:09:57,297 --> 00:10:01,902
(Aimi) That's right, they're friends.

152
00:10:01,969 --> 00:10:03,637
Because I'm a friend →

153
00:10:03,704 --> 00:10:06,873
I'm sure they're worried because they're important friends.

154
00:10:08,542 --> 00:10:12,779
I like Kirio-kun!

155
00:10:12,846 --> 00:10:15,816
Nami also likes Kirio-kun!

156
00:10:15,882 --> 00:10:18,452
I fell in love with the same person →

157
00:10:18,518 --> 00:10:21,788
It's too late now but I knew it →

158
00:10:21,855 --> 00:10:24,524
What should I do about this?

159
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:31,531
I was misunderstood.

160
00:10:31,598 --> 00:10:35,802
This is how we are together every day →

161
00:10:35,869 --> 00:10:39,606
It usually lasts forever.

162
00:10:39,673 --> 00:10:44,177
But that's not obvious.

163
00:10:44,244 --> 00:10:47,147
I fell in love with Kirio-kun.

164
00:10:47,214 --> 00:10:50,150
Become friends with the rain.

165
00:10:50,217 --> 00:10:52,519
More important things are coming.

166
00:10:54,087 --> 00:10:58,325
I was scared to go back to being alone.

167
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:03,764
So, is it someone you like or a friend?

168
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:06,500
I can't choose either.

169
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:13,173
(Wave) I... →

170
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,876
That's fine.

171
00:11:15,942 --> 00:11:18,478
(Aimi) What's good?

172
00:11:19,546 --> 00:11:24,084
(Nami) It's fine if Aimi-chan sticks to Kirio-kun.

173
00:11:24,151 --> 00:11:26,353
(Aimi) Yeah, that's a lie!

174
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:28,021

177
00:11:37,397 --> 00:11:40,434
(Wave) Aimi-chan →

178
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:44,604
I prefer to lie about my feelings.

179
00:11:44,671 --> 00:11:48,108
So if Aimi-chan is →

180
00:11:48,175 --> 00:11:51,578
If I were to tell Kirio-kun about his feelings →

181
00:11:51,645 --> 00:11:53,914
I….

182
00:11:55,782 --> 00:11:58,085
Push your back.

183
00:11:59,352 --> 00:12:01,388
(Blue Beauty) wave….

184
00:12:07,761 --> 00:12:09,796
(Grandma) You guys →

185
00:12:09,863 --> 00:12:12,599
Youth, isn't it?

186
00:12:17,304 --> 00:12:19,639
Hahaha... “lol”

187
00:12:26,847 --> 00:12:29,516
(Wave) Hey Aimi?

188
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:31,585
(Aimi) What is it?

189
00:12:31,651 --> 00:12:34,287
(Wave) That's what I said earlier.

190
00:12:34,354 --> 00:12:37,524
Aimi won't be alone

191
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:43,230
If Aimi-chan goes ahead with Kirio-kun, no matter what happens →

192
00:12:43,296 --> 00:12:46,333
Ah, there's nothing I can do about it.

193
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,735
(Aimi) Ah?

194
00:12:48,802 --> 00:12:50,804
(Wave) I →

195
00:12:50,871 --> 00:12:53,106
She's next to Aimi.

196
00:12:55,642 --> 00:12:57,711
(Aimi) And...but if the waves →

197
00:12:57,777 --> 00:13:00,046
What if you stick together with Kirio-kun?

198
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:03,083
(Wave) That's fine, because...

199
00:13:05,218 --> 00:13:07,654
Because →

200
00:13:07,721 --> 00:13:11,024
I'm Aimi's →

201
00:13:11,091 --> 00:13:13,627
Isn't it a friend?

202
00:13:16,263 --> 00:13:18,298
(Aimi) Waves.

203
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:21,067
When you go to Kirio-kun's house,

204
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:23,803
Let's go together. (Wave) Yes.

205
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:26,773
So I'll get my duplicate key and go home.

206
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:31,044
(Aimi) Huh? You're sober, you idiot.

207
00:13:31,111 --> 00:13:33,980
(Wave) Did you just say you're stupid? (Aimi) Yes I said it's an idiot.

208
00:13:34,047 --> 00:13:36,349
(White) Aimi's idiot. (Aimi) Yes, I'm not an idiot.

209
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,218
(White) Aimi's clumsy. (Aimi) Yes, it's not clumsy.

210
00:13:38,418 --> 00:13:40,587
(White) Aimi's stupidity. (Aimi) It's not stupid.

211
00:13:40,754 --> 00:13:42,923
(White) Aimi's squid. (Aimi) Squid! ?

212
00:13:48,595 --> 00:13:50,697
(Waves) Ah, it's raining in the afternoon.

213
00:13:50,764 --> 00:13:53,266
You didn't bring an umbrella with you.

214
00:13:54,267 --> 00:13:56,336
(Aimi) Hey, waves. (Wave) Huh?

215
00:13:56,403 --> 00:13:59,172
(Aimi) I'll check it out a little.

216
00:14:00,273 --> 00:14:04,344
The pee will soon rain.

217
00:14:04,411 --> 00:14:07,480
The pee flows into the sewer, right?

218
00:14:07,547 --> 00:14:11,184
And while it was purified, it flowed into the river →

219
00:14:11,251 --> 00:14:13,753
The river leads to the sea →

220
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:16,823
The seawater evaporates and turns into clouds.

221
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:20,694
And the clouds will rain, right?

222
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:24,231
In other words, the rain comes from Kirio-kun's pee.

223
00:14:24,297 --> 00:14:27,234
So it's fine if you don't have an umbrella.

224
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:31,671
(Wave) Isn't that the source of everyone's pee?

225
00:14:34,341 --> 00:14:36,543
(Aimi) We're not doing anything.

226
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:41,348
(Waves) and the others? Aimi-chan: Kirio-kun has been experiencing withdrawal symptoms due to lack of food.

227
00:14:41,414 --> 00:14:43,016
(Aimi) It's going to come out.

228
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:46,253
I haven't been able to talk much lately.

229
00:14:48,521 --> 00:14:50,490
(White) Aimi-chan.

230
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:55,195
Maybe it's about time for us to step on.

231
00:14:55,262 --> 00:14:58,665
If you're still in a state of mind, you'll be completely in exam mode.

232
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:02,202
I think now is the time to take the lead.

233
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:04,371
I couldn't do it with Kirio-kun until now →

234
00:15:04,437 --> 00:15:08,241
Let's think about something fun.

235
00:15:08,308 --> 00:15:12,045
(Aimi) Is it something I couldn't do before...

236
00:15:12,112 --> 00:15:14,948
Then, I'll go and see a movie or something with the three of us.

237
00:15:15,015 --> 00:15:16,983
(Wave) Three of us... so good!

238
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:18,785
(Aimi) No, but damn boring~ If it were a movie...

239
00:15:18,852 --> 00:15:20,520
(Wave) That's it, Aimi!

240
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:24,257
What we have been able to speak honestly with Kirio-kun up until now →

241
00:15:24,324 --> 00:15:26,426
There were almost none, right?

242
00:15:26,493 --> 00:15:29,129
So if it's boring, "That's boring" →

243
00:15:29,195 --> 00:15:32,766
Don't you think it's better to have a relationship where you can laugh?

244
00:15:34,801 --> 00:15:37,971
(Aimi) We can laugh together... can we?

245
00:15:38,038 --> 00:15:41,007
That's right!

246
00:15:41,074 --> 00:15:42,842
(Momose) Yes, yes.

247
00:15:42,909 --> 00:15:45,979
Kirio-chan hasn't been showing his face into club activities lately.

248
00:15:46,046 --> 00:15:48,915
Me, I'm lonely.

249
00:15:48,982 --> 00:15:51,484
(Uda) Momose!

250
00:16:02,562 --> 00:16:04,397

00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:07,100

252
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:10,136
(Wave) We were talking together.

253
00:16:10,203 --> 00:16:13,606
(Aimi) If you like, this weekend or something like this →

254
00:16:13,673 --> 00:16:17,010
Why don't you go and see the movie together?

255
00:16:17,077 --> 00:16:21,047
(Kirio) Ah... uh...

256
00:16:25,385 --> 00:16:27,887
sorry.

257
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:33,493
(Wave) Ah, maybe there are weekends plans?

258
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:36,596
Ah, a club game.

259
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:41,034
(Aimi) If possible, next week or next month would be fine.

260
00:16:41,101 --> 00:16:42,702
(Wave) Let's go see the movie.

261
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:46,840
>> No, sorry, that's not...

262
00:16:46,906 --> 00:16:52,245
I'm not good at dark places and big sounds...

263
00:16:56,349 --> 00:17:00,687
(Aimi) Ah, what? Ah, haha, it's okay, it's okay! ! ! !

264
00:17:00,754 --> 00:17:04,290
I see. If you're not good at dark and loud sounds.

265
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:06,259
Then it's time for that next time!

266

(Kirio) What a sudden thing.

273
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:33,153
(Momose) No, Someya and others invited me to do a movie just now →

274
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:35,555
Because I refused.

275
00:17:35,622 --> 00:17:37,490
(Kirio) I was listening.

276
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:41,060
(Momose) Are you at other schools? she.

277
00:17:41,127 --> 00:17:44,130
(Kirio) But there's none.

278
00:17:46,933 --> 00:17:50,937
(Momose) Ah, that's right!

279
00:17:51,004 --> 00:17:52,972
What a massive amount.

280
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:58,077
Kirio: Why don't you be a little more friendly?

281
00:17:58,144 --> 00:18:01,214
Everyone is getting along well.

282
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:10,356

(Satsuki) What's wrong? You're not doing well.

287
00:18:38,852 --> 00:18:41,321
(Satsuki) Well, Kirio is...

288
00:18:41,387 --> 00:18:43,490
He's the cool type from the beginning, right?

289
00:18:43,556 --> 00:18:46,526
(Momose) That's right.

290

(Satsuki) What? Wait then Momose →

300
00:19:30,203 --> 00:19:33,172
Someya-san knows that she likes Kirio →
