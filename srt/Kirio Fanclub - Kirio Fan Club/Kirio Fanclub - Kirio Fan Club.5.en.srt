1
00:00:03,137 --> 00:00:05,473
(Aimi) From now on, Nami & Momose.

2
00:00:05,506 --> 00:00:07,975
It's a pair of me and Kirio-kun.

3
00:00:08,042 --> 00:00:11,178
Ah, it's going to make me lonely, waves.

4
00:00:11,245 --> 00:00:13,748
(Wave) That's definitely not the case!

5
00:00:18,786 --> 00:00:20,688
(Seirah) No way.

6
00:00:20,755 --> 00:00:24,825
No no no no no...

7
00:00:24,892 --> 00:00:28,329
That's... no way.

8
00:00:28,396 --> 00:00:30,931
Aimi Senpai Senpai Nami Senpai.

9
00:00:30,998 --> 00:00:36,604
I definitely don't want that kind of thing!

10
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:43,577
What should I do... I have to stop it somehow...

11
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:46,113
What should I do... Calm down...

12
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:48,549
Let's calm down and organize our minds...

13
00:00:48,616 --> 00:00:50,418
Calm down...

14
00:00:52,286 --> 00:00:55,623
Yes, I decided to support the two of you.

15
00:00:55,689 --> 00:00:57,625
That day.

16
00:00:57,691 --> 00:01:00,428
Here you go "Happy Soccer Live!"

17
00:01:00,494 --> 00:01:03,697
The bathing scene of my favorite, Shun-kun!

18
00:01:03,764 --> 00:01:06,967
Ahhhh, no matter how many screenshots it doesn't fade!

19
00:01:07,034 --> 00:01:09,603
Tashiro Seira handle name: Kirari.

20
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:12,506
Increased resolution of Hapisaka and Shun-kun →

21
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:16,110
I also became the manager of the soccer club to learn about the real world.

22
00:01:16,177 --> 00:01:19,447
There are no precious members like Shun-kun in the 3D, but →

23
00:01:19,513 --> 00:01:24,952
Everything is the path to understanding Shun-kun

24
00:01:25,019 --> 00:01:29,023
(Aimi) Yesterday I went on a date with Kirio-kun.

25
00:01:30,391 --> 00:01:33,260
>> Nunu? My Happy Otaku Time →

26
00:01:33,327 --> 00:01:35,930
I never knew he would get in the way with his boring romance pride!

27
00:01:35,996 --> 00:01:38,399
(White) E Aimi-chan What does that mean?

28
00:01:38,466 --> 00:01:41,735
(Aimi) I was invited to the cafe after the club activities →

29
00:01:41,802 --> 00:01:43,704
The cola float ice cream that came out →

30
00:01:43,771 --> 00:01:46,006
It's as big as a soccer ball

31
00:01:46,073 --> 00:01:49,076
Then the scene suddenly changed.

32
00:01:49,143 --> 00:01:51,378
(Wave) Are you talking about a dream?

33
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:53,948
(Aimi) Twitch: Did you find out?

34
00:01:54,014 --> 00:01:56,050
>> What's that guy?

35
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:58,219
It feels like an otaku! Who do you like?

36
00:02:00,321 --> 00:02:02,122
My uniform?

37
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:05,392
Is Kirio-kun probably about Kirio-senpai?

38
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:08,496
(Aimi) Well, isn't Nami appearing in Kirio-kun's dream?

39
00:02:08,562 --> 00:02:11,432
(Waves) I... that's not too much of a dream.

40
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,735
(Aimi) Wow.

41
00:02:14,802 --> 00:02:16,704
I haven't been to the Hatto

42
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:19,540
Well, I'm busy because I'm coming.

43
00:02:19,607 --> 00:02:23,010
The waves also need to make more effort. (Wave) What is effort?

44
00:02:23,077 --> 00:02:25,646
(Aimi) It's definitely going to make Kirio-kun dream.

45
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:32,887
📱You dream of Kirio-kun (Aimi)You dream of Kirio-kun.

46
00:02:32,953 --> 00:02:35,890
You dream of Kirio-kun You dream of Kirio-kun.

47
00:02:35,956 --> 00:02:38,726
(Nami) Aimi-chan did you have that ritual every night?

48
00:02:38,792 --> 00:02:43,163
(Aimi) Then I put a piece of paper with the words Kirio-kun written on it here and went to sleep.

49
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,432
>> Oh o →

50
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:47,401
Oh!

51
00:02:47,468 --> 00:02:49,870
(Nami) I accept Aimi's hard work.

52
00:02:49,937 --> 00:02:53,207
But what's more important is not to bring out Kirio-kun in his dreams →

53
00:02:53,274 --> 00:02:55,543
Isn't it going to appear in Kirio-kun's dream?

54
00:02:55,609 --> 00:02:58,312
(Aimi) Is that so? I wasn't interested at all, but

55
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:01,081
It's the kind of thing that you've become interested in after you've come into your dreams.

56
00:03:01,148 --> 00:03:03,551
(Wave) That's right. (Aimi) That's a great idea!

57
00:03:03,617 --> 00:03:06,120
Okay, I'm gonna vomit in front of Kirio-kun tomorrow.

58
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,789
(Waves) Nightmare! I'm having nightmares! (Aimi) It doesn't matter if it's a nightmare!

59
00:03:08,856 --> 00:03:11,325
(Wave) No, more, it's like they'll get excited about the same topic...

60
00:03:11,392 --> 00:03:14,695
(Aimi) If that's the case, it won't make a lasting impression, I'll definitely vomit!

61
00:03:14,762 --> 00:03:17,031
(Wave) No good. >> Oh yeah!

62
00:03:17,097 --> 00:03:19,767
It's so good!

63
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:21,936
A truly miraculous encounter!

64
00:03:22,002 --> 00:03:27,274
Although we are different fans, I thought we were residents of the same planet.

65
00:03:27,341 --> 00:03:32,112
And that day, this feeling changed to certainty.

66
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:58,305
(Aimi) Damn it~ We don't know anything about Kirio-kun.

67
00:03:58,372 --> 00:04:01,742
(Wave) I'd like to have an opportunity to talk about it.

68
00:04:01,809 --> 00:04:03,911
(Aimi) Let's ask about your favorite color.

69
00:04:03,978 --> 00:04:07,548
(Wave) Are you willing to expand the story?

70
00:04:07,615 --> 00:04:11,118
Please send me something more forgotten~ →

71
00:04:11,185 --> 00:04:14,188
It's like being grateful.

72
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:20,461
>> “Footsteps”

73
00:04:23,664 --> 00:04:26,533
(Wave) This is it! This is Aimi!

74
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,736
Kirio-kun's school run!

75
00:04:28,802 --> 00:04:30,638
There are probably still.

76
00:04:30,704 --> 00:04:33,140
Wait Aimi-chan.

77
00:04:33,207 --> 00:04:37,044
This is something different.

78
00:04:37,111 --> 00:04:39,980
Which one wins?

79
00:04:40,047 --> 00:04:44,018
We're friends, aren't we?

80
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:50,124
(Aimi) No... he's a rival.

81
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,792
If you want to fall in love with someone →

82
00:04:51,859 --> 00:04:54,595
Be prepared to kick others off.

83
00:04:54,662 --> 00:04:59,833
"I like the same person, but let's work together and be friends" →

84
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,803
I dream too many waves.

85
00:05:06,073 --> 00:05:10,744
>> I can't believe it's so hard to have an idol in 3D...

86
00:05:11,745 --> 00:05:15,182
But while overcoming the barrier of being a fellow stakeholder,

87
00:05:15,249 --> 00:05:17,785
Deepen bonds, precious relationships →

88
00:05:17,851 --> 00:05:21,221
It certainly was there!

89
00:05:21,288 --> 00:05:23,624
(Waves) Ah, smell it. (Aimi) You definitely should stop.

90
00:05:23,691 --> 00:05:26,360
Why are you smelling it? (Wave) Nice.

91
00:05:26,427 --> 00:05:28,362
(Aimi) By the way, what kind of smell does it smell like!

92
00:05:28,429 --> 00:05:30,964
(Wave) One more time. (Aimi) Hey, stop it!

93
00:05:31,031 --> 00:05:34,768
I'm the one who's going to be a slut. (Waves) Ah, it smells nice.

94
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:36,537
(Aimi) Hey, return the wave!

95
00:05:38,739 --> 00:05:40,641
memorial!

96
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:43,010
>> Kaa!

97
00:05:43,077 --> 00:05:45,345
Friendship~~~~~~!

98
00:05:45,412 --> 00:05:49,149
Ah, I love it!

99
00:05:51,752 --> 00:05:55,923
From this day on, I have decided to support two of them.

100
00:05:55,989 --> 00:05:58,859
And Aimi-senpai and Nami-senpai →

101
00:05:58,926 --> 00:06:02,096
Watching over precious relationships →

102
00:06:02,162 --> 00:06:04,331
It became my mission.

103
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,735
(Seirah) Please let me work here!

104
00:06:07,801 --> 00:06:10,771
(Morino) No, we're not currently recruiting part-time jobs.

105
00:06:10,838 --> 00:06:12,539
(Seirah) Next Tuesday →

106
00:06:12,606 --> 00:06:15,542
It's fine only from 4pm to 6pm!

107
00:06:15,609 --> 00:06:18,312
(Morino) Is it a work experience?

108
00:06:21,315 --> 00:06:25,018
(Morino) You... a student at Ekoma High School?

109
00:06:25,085 --> 00:06:28,088
(Seirah) Yes. (Morino) I'm sorry.

110
00:06:28,155 --> 00:06:30,390
I hear something strange though.

111
00:06:30,457 --> 00:06:32,826
Do you know Dragon Kirio?

112
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:35,996
(Seira) Dragon Kirio?

113
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:38,532
Are you talking about Kirio-senpai?

114
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:40,601
(Morino) Ah, that's right!

115
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:43,103
That means you know Kirio-kun too...

116
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:45,672
He's really popular after all!

117
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,544
(Seirah) No, objectively speaking, it's not particularly popular.

118
00:06:50,611 --> 00:06:53,347
I'm also bad at soccer. (Morino) What? Is that so?

119
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,816
(Shoura) Also, at first glance she looks smart, but →

120
00:06:55,883 --> 00:06:58,051
You may be a bit unfamiliar with studying.

121
00:06:58,118 --> 00:07:01,455
(Morino) What? What? Ah, is that so? Wait a minute!

122
00:07:01,522 --> 00:07:04,458
Ah, that's right! wait a minute!

123
00:07:04,525 --> 00:07:06,994
Ah, I'm hired already!

124
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,762
(Seirah) What? Ah?

125
00:07:10,664 --> 00:07:27,614
(♪～)

126
00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:44,631
(♪～)

127
00:07:44,698 --> 00:07:49,703
(♪～)

128
00:07:53,774 --> 00:07:55,909
(Morino) Welcome. (Seira) Welcome.

129
00:07:57,377 --> 00:07:59,313
(Aimi) Yeah...all four.

130
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:01,548
(Morino) Four people to the seat by the window...

131
00:08:01,615 --> 00:08:03,684
(Seira) I'll show you! please!

132
00:08:07,855 --> 00:08:09,656
(Shoura) Chu Chu...

133
00:08:09,723 --> 00:08:13,460
The distance between a junior high school student on a double date!

134
00:08:13,527 --> 00:08:16,563
Ah, come on here! yes.

135
00:08:18,966 --> 00:08:20,734
(Seira) Please.

136
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:30,477
(Shora) Hey, I've seen that before, wait.

137
00:08:30,544 --> 00:08:32,913
I mean, I'm already adolescent middle school student →

138
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,681
Aimi Senpai and Nami Senpai →

139
00:08:34,748 --> 00:08:36,750
It's so tough it can't be done!

140
00:08:36,817 --> 00:08:40,254
Anyway, thank you for everything.

141
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,055
Thank you world.

142
00:08:42,122 --> 00:08:45,158
Thank you, the creator of the universe!

143
00:08:45,225 --> 00:08:47,394
(Aimi) From now on, Nami & Momose.

144
00:08:47,461 --> 00:08:50,597
It's a pair of me and Kirio-kun.

145
00:08:50,664 --> 00:08:53,500
(Seirah) No, calm down, sparkle.

146
00:08:53,567 --> 00:08:56,036
You shouldn't be happy.

147
00:08:56,103 --> 00:08:58,405
Because today...

148
00:08:58,472 --> 00:09:00,340
The important relationship between your favorites →

149
00:09:00,407 --> 00:09:03,210
It's a day that might change!

150
00:09:06,446 --> 00:09:10,183
(Shiro) Sorry for the wait, this is a cola float.

151
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,852
(Kirio) What?

152
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:13,587
(Momose) Is the ice cream not big?

153
00:09:13,654 --> 00:09:15,856
(White) Aimi-chan's dream...?

154
00:09:15,923 --> 00:09:17,724
(Seirah) If you think about it, then →

155
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:20,494
We had exactly 10,000 customers.

156
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:22,863
(Momose) Amazing!

157
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:26,466
I'll enjoy having this. (White) That's good Momose-kun.

158
00:09:28,535 --> 00:09:31,338
(Momose) I see! It's tough to eat...

159
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:35,509
(Shora) Okay, Momose-senpai's consciousness has now shifted away from Nami-senpai.

160
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:39,680
It's not the time to be obsessed with ice cream and believing in love.

161
00:09:40,981 --> 00:09:44,418
(Shora) This is the way a nerd otaku does it.

162
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,257
(Momose) Eeee!

163
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:53,827
(Aimi) Kirio-kun! (Wave) Are you okay?

164
00:09:53,894 --> 00:09:55,862
(Momose) Sorry, Kirio! (Kirio) Ah.

165
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:57,731
(Morino) Are you okay?

166
00:09:57,798 --> 00:09:59,700
(Kirio) Ah, no, I actually dropped it... sorry.

167
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:02,002
(Morino) No no no... Please use this.

168
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:04,571
Dragon Kirio.

169
00:10:04,638 --> 00:10:06,473
(Kirio) What...me?

170
00:10:08,075 --> 00:10:10,243
(Morino) Ah, um...

171
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:12,112
Right, right?

172
00:10:15,582 --> 00:10:17,451
(Morino) Excuse me.

173
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:22,856
(Seirah) It's hell!

174
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,893
(Seira) Manager is doing something wrong!

175
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:30,097
You can't help but tell the two of you about Kirio-senpai!

176
00:10:30,163 --> 00:10:33,667
That's what I sent an 18+ fan fiction to the original author →

177
00:10:33,734 --> 00:10:36,303
Impressions It's like I'm looking for it!

178
00:10:39,206 --> 00:10:42,376
(Seirah) What should we do, the two of you are in a difficult situation...

179
00:10:42,442 --> 00:10:44,778
At times like this, as a heavy-paying nerd →

180
00:10:44,845 --> 00:10:47,214
How is it best to move...

181
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:52,652
(Aimi) I made a one-shot joke! (Seirah) What?

182
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:55,822
(Aimi) Ah, I've gained weight recently so I've been bothering me about my upper arms.

183
00:10:55,889 --> 00:10:57,924
That's right, tear your upper arms off!

184
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:00,027
But throwing it away is bad for the environment →

185
00:11:00,093 --> 00:11:03,096
Put it on my arm! No, then Zero's arm is on the left →

186
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:07,300
I think the right one has just become the arm of 4!

187
00:11:07,367 --> 00:11:15,942
(♪～)

188
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:17,811
What is that? Aimi-chan.

189
00:11:17,878 --> 00:11:19,780
Because he's not a comedian.

190
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:21,548
(Aimi) That's so good →

191
00:11:21,615 --> 00:11:24,351
If Kirio-kun smiles, that's it.

192
00:11:24,418 --> 00:11:26,987
Shall I give it a try? (Wave) I understand.

193
00:11:27,054 --> 00:11:30,157
(Aimi) Torn off her right upper arm and transplanted her.

194
00:11:30,223 --> 00:11:32,659
In the end, the left side is his fourth arm!

195
00:11:32,726 --> 00:11:34,761
Ahahaha... “lol” (Wave) Ahahaha... “lol”

196
00:11:34,828 --> 00:11:39,066
Hahaha! Aimi-chan is so funny!

197
00:11:39,132 --> 00:11:41,701
That means, you can take the "2" on your upper arm as a number →

198
00:11:41,768 --> 00:11:44,538
That means subtracting and adding between your arms.

199
00:11:44,604 --> 00:11:46,673
Hahaha... “lol”

200
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:49,242
(Shora) As expected from Nami-senpai.

201
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:52,379
The hell that the store manager created is explained as a joke →

202
00:11:52,446 --> 00:11:55,482
It was offset by the hell of a comedian murderer!

203
00:11:56,516 --> 00:11:59,586
(Shora) You understand, Momose-senpai, for you →

204
00:11:59,653 --> 00:12:03,323
There's no way you can break into the two of you!

205
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:10,931
(Momose) What is Dragon Kirio?

206
00:12:10,997 --> 00:12:13,533
(Wave) Ah, um, that's...

207
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:19,940
(Aimi) Kirio-kun, sorry.

208
00:12:20,006 --> 00:12:22,843
Before, I happened to be on Kirio-kun's desk →

209
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:25,812
I saw that it says "DRAGON"...

210
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:28,782
That story is about waves here...

211
00:12:28,849 --> 00:12:31,585
He's talking about it being interesting.

212
00:12:31,651 --> 00:12:35,589
But it's not to make fun of me.

213
00:12:35,655 --> 00:12:39,426
(White) Me too... sorry Kirio-kun.

214
00:12:39,493 --> 00:12:41,361
(Kirio) Ah, that's it →

215
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:43,563
There's a classical Japanese professor, Wakita.

216
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:46,433
(Wakita) Yes, huh, today is so famous →

217
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,468
The Tale of the Heike...

218
00:12:48,535 --> 00:12:52,606
(Kirio) Professor Wakita was wearing something printed on it with the DRAGON printed on it.

219
00:12:52,672 --> 00:12:55,208
I'm feeling really curious about that.

220
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:57,277
I'm kind of addicted...

221
00:12:57,344 --> 00:12:59,713
I've written it on my desk.

222
00:13:01,581 --> 00:13:04,451
(Kirio) That's all...

223
00:13:04,518 --> 00:13:07,454
Both of them were curious about DRAGON too.

224
00:13:07,521 --> 00:13:09,122
Hahaha... “lol”

225
00:13:09,189 --> 00:13:12,459
I might be both of them and the same thing.

226
00:13:17,998 --> 00:13:20,000
(Momose) What is that?

227
00:13:20,066 --> 00:13:22,536
That's good! Put that kind of thing on me too!

228
00:13:22,602 --> 00:13:24,571
Name it! (Aimi) Huh?

229
00:13:24,638 --> 00:13:27,207
Peach Momose. (Momose) Huh? It's just like that!

230
00:13:27,274 --> 00:13:29,009
No, it's even more cool...

231
00:13:29,075 --> 00:13:30,777
(Seira) Manager.

232
00:13:30,844 --> 00:13:34,114
Maybe those two are okay.

233
00:13:34,181 --> 00:13:36,950
(Morino) That's right, Tashiro-san.

234
00:13:37,017 --> 00:13:38,752
(Seira) Manager.

235
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:42,022
When do you think your part-time job payments are paid?

236
00:13:42,088 --> 00:13:46,359
(Morino) It's thick. Tashiro-san is the end of the month.

237
00:13:46,426 --> 00:13:48,828
(Seirah) It's late.

238
00:13:48,895 --> 00:13:51,665
(Kirio) Ah, we're on the train.

239
00:13:51,731 --> 00:13:54,701
(Momose) Thank you for today, again.

240
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:01,942
(Aimi) Ah... Kirio-kun!

241
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:04,344
See you tomorrow.

242
00:14:04,411 --> 00:14:06,746
(Kirio) Yes, tomorrow.

243
00:14:14,721 --> 00:14:18,291
(Momose) Oh, what will you do on-site study next week?

244
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:23,663
(Momose) Kirio should also be thinking about it and decide on the team.

245
00:14:25,232 --> 00:14:27,067
(Kirio) Yes...

246
00:14:28,435 --> 00:14:31,972
(Kirio, junior high schooler) Can you go? Studying outside school.

247
00:14:33,406 --> 00:14:37,777
(Kirio, junior high school student) See, I couldn't attend the sports festival either.

248
00:14:41,748 --> 00:14:44,317
(Hope) I want to go on a field trip.

249
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:47,487
(Kirio, junior high school student) Okay! Well, we're definitely the same group!

250
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:49,589
(Hope) Yes.

251
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,502
(Kirio, junior high school student) What a surprise.

252
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:04,604
(Want to do) What? Ken-kun.

253
00:15:04,671 --> 00:15:08,875
(Kirio, junior high school student) I've got a dream for the future.

254
00:15:08,942 --> 00:15:11,811
(Hope) Yes.

255
00:15:11,878 --> 00:15:14,648
(Kirio, a junior high school student) I want to poop in the bath.

256
00:15:14,714 --> 00:15:17,017
(Hope) What! (Kirio, a junior high school student) And... →

257
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:20,587
I'd like to see if poop comes up!

258
00:15:20,654 --> 00:15:24,190
(Nozomi) Hahaha... “lol” (Middle school student Kirio) Hahaha... “lol”

259
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:27,894
Poop... how will it come to mind... "lol"

260
00:15:31,031 --> 00:15:33,500
(Nozomi) Ken-kun is really interesting!

261
00:15:33,566 --> 00:15:35,302
(Kirio, junior high school student) Hahaha... “lol”

262
00:15:38,638 --> 00:15:42,609
(Hope) I'm looking forward to studying outside school.

263
00:15:43,043 --> 00:15:44,644
(Kirio, junior high school student) Yes!

264
00:15:44,644 --> 00:15:46,546
Hahaha... “lol”

265
00:16:04,431 --> 00:16:06,700
(White) Aimi-chan, what are you doing?

266
00:16:06,766 --> 00:16:09,969
(Aimi) It's definitely going to be an image training session where you can hold hands with Kirio-kun.

267
00:16:10,036 --> 00:16:11,938
(Waves) What a practice.

268
00:16:12,706 --> 00:16:15,542
(Aimi) The waves are really carefree. (Wave) What?

269
00:16:15,608 --> 00:16:18,211
(Aimi) Oh, do you know the current situation?

270
00:16:18,278 --> 00:16:21,281
We've finally got closer to Kirio-kun.

271
00:16:21,348 --> 00:16:23,316
In preparation for a close out-of-school study next week →

272
00:16:23,383 --> 00:16:25,752
I'm preparing my heart.

273
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:27,587
(Wave) I mean, Aimi-chan →

274
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:30,123
What if you're doing image training?

275
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:32,992
There's something I need to think about more.

276
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,129
(Aimi) That's...

277
00:16:38,198 --> 00:16:40,767
(Uda) What? Why did you go on a field trip?

278
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:42,969
It has to be run by five men.

279
00:16:43,036 --> 00:16:45,538
And the soccer club! It's impossible.

280
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:49,376
(Aimi) Ah, I'm going to study outside of school.

281
00:16:49,442 --> 00:16:52,812
(Wave) It's uncertain, isn't it? (Aimi) I'm worried.

282
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:55,181
(Nami) Kirio-kun's casual clothes. (Aimi) The group decided.

283
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:00,820
(Aimi) What? Sorry Wave.

284
00:17:00,887 --> 00:17:03,356
Um, hm?

285
00:17:03,423 --> 00:17:05,625
What's uncertain? Say it all.

286
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:08,261
(White) What... Kirio-kun's casual clothes.

287
00:17:09,662 --> 00:17:12,232
(Aimi) Huh? picture? teeth? Are you really saying it?

288
00:17:12,298 --> 00:17:14,734
Such a fun ranking for high school life →

289
00:17:14,801 --> 00:17:17,704
It's been 10 years in a row and it's been ranked number one no.

290
00:17:18,772 --> 00:17:20,940
Wow, a little wave.

291
00:17:21,007 --> 00:17:23,576
Are you worried, are you probably worried?

292
00:17:23,643 --> 00:17:26,980
What if Kirio-kun's casual clothes were uncool?

293
00:17:28,415 --> 00:17:31,317
Baaaa! Idiot waves! ?

294
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:35,488
Kirio-kun's casual clothes are either uncool or uncool.

295
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:38,825
Just being able to see it is now the finish line! Do you understand?

296
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:40,527
(White) So is Aimi okay?

297
00:17:40,593 --> 00:17:42,295
If Kirio-kun is →

298
00:17:42,362 --> 00:17:45,331
What, what if you put on the pointed shoes.

299
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:48,301
And bare feet. (Aimi) I guess I'll have no choice but to go and stab her.

300
00:17:48,368 --> 00:17:50,637
If it were you, Misaki Kirio-kun, what would you say →

301
00:17:50,703 --> 00:17:52,439
Even if you wear a set made from Yuba...

302
00:17:52,505 --> 00:17:54,441
(Wave) Well then! Parker's →

303
00:17:54,507 --> 00:17:56,609
What if you wear clothes that only have the plaid part?

304
00:17:56,676 --> 00:17:58,411
(Aimi) Where's the hoodie?

305
00:17:58,478 --> 00:18:00,447
More than that, before the waves,

306
00:18:00,513 --> 00:18:02,449
It's not going to start unless the teams join together.

307
00:18:02,515 --> 00:18:06,019
If the teams were split, there would be almost no time to talk to Kirio-kun.

308
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:09,956
That's the point of going. (Wave) That's true, but...

309
00:18:10,023 --> 00:18:12,625
(Aimi) The problem is the boys from the soccer club.

310
00:18:12,692 --> 00:18:14,994
He's always hanging around Peach, right?

311
00:18:15,061 --> 00:18:17,430
(Wave) Yes. (Aimi) If it goes in a reasonable way →

312
00:18:17,497 --> 00:18:19,365
It should gather there...

313
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:22,435
If that's the case, we won't have a chance.

314
00:18:22,502 --> 00:18:24,971
(Wave) Yes. (Aimi) There.

315
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:27,574
There's one idea.

316
00:18:36,649 --> 00:18:38,351
(Mitsuda) What exactly are you using today?

317
00:18:38,418 --> 00:18:40,186
Well, I guess it's Kirio-san anyway.

318
00:18:40,253 --> 00:18:42,021
(Aimi) You know well, Mitsuda.

319
00:18:42,088 --> 00:18:44,023
(Wave) There will be some field trips next time, right?

320
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:47,727
(Aimi) We really wanted to be in the same group as Kirio-kun.

321
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:50,263
So what is that? A lure?

322
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:53,600
(Wave) Yes, attract me. (Aimi) Yes, that attraction →

323
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:55,735
I wonder if it's a magical one.

324
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:57,403
>> Are you studying outside the school?

325
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:01,040
For me, who is not good at group activities, this is a bit unimportant.

326
00:19:01,107 --> 00:19:04,043
First of all, there was a Jujutsu Expo in Kansai that day...

327
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:06,145
(Aimi) What is that, that jujuju...

328
00:19:06,212 --> 00:19:07,814
Can you tell me?!

329
00:19:07,881 --> 00:19:09,649
>> Why do I have to get scolded?

330
00:19:09,716 --> 00:19:12,819
It's a Jujutsu Expo. World famous cursed collectors also come to Japan →

331
00:19:12,886 --> 00:19:15,455
There is also the exhibition of rare magical objects and the history of magic...

332
00:19:19,025 --> 00:19:20,627
Are you not too interested?

333
00:19:20,693 --> 00:19:23,630
(Aimi) Instead, just teach me about Attraction Magic!

334
00:19:23,696 --> 00:19:26,399
>> Ha...If you tell me, please go home quickly.

335
00:19:26,466 --> 00:19:28,501
(Aimi) Oh, I understand.

336
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:37,210
>> First, open the messaging app and type "Let's become the same group."

337
00:19:37,243 --> 00:19:40,547
(Aimi) Yes. >> I'll send it to Kirio.

338
00:19:42,582 --> 00:19:44,484
(Aimi) Isn't that a real approach?

339
00:19:44,551 --> 00:19:46,386
Mitsuda, you're taking it off!

340
00:19:46,452 --> 00:19:49,522
You can't do that so let's rely on you! Hey, waves!

341
00:19:49,589 --> 00:19:51,724
>> “Supo” (Aimi) Wow!

342
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:53,560
Wow, oh oh...

343
00:19:53,626 --> 00:19:56,696
Wow, that's amazing, hey!

344
00:19:58,064 --> 00:20:00,667
In fact, wait and send it to the group!

345
00:20:00,733 --> 00:20:02,368
(Wave) Eh, it's true!

346
00:20:02,435 --> 00:20:04,637
(Aimi) The group that Momose created at that time.

347
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:07,240
Kirio-kun is there so I was nervous and didn't use it much →

348
00:20:07,307 --> 00:20:09,242
I don't know what it works here.

349
00:20:10,243 --> 00:20:12,345
Wow, Momose is here right away!

350
00:20:12,412 --> 00:20:15,048
It was because I got caught by a fishing hook called a wave.

351
00:20:15,114 --> 00:20:16,849
(Waves) too.

352
00:20:22,455 --> 00:20:25,525
(Aimi) What is that? That's right, see.

353
00:20:25,592 --> 00:20:27,627
It's over.

354
00:20:27,694 --> 00:20:30,330
Damn Mitsuda! Nothing works, isn't it?

355
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:32,999
>> Please don't blame me. >> “Supo Supo”

356
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:35,001
(White) Aimi-chan, this is it! Look.

357
00:20:40,773 --> 00:20:50,583
(♪～)

358
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:52,719
(♪~) >> Just a moment! What are you doing whatever you want!

359
00:20:52,785 --> 00:20:56,889
(♪~) (Aimi) Shut up. Mitsuda-oh needs you.

360
00:20:56,956 --> 00:20:59,058
(♪~) >> What's the convenient thing...

361
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:01,160
(♪~) >> No no, I won't go, me!

362
00:21:01,227 --> 00:21:03,429
(♪~) (Aimi) I mean, I was deliberately absent from school events →

363
00:21:03,496 --> 00:21:05,231
(♪~) (Aimi) It's embarrassing when you become an adult →

364
00:21:05,298 --> 00:21:08,134
(♪~) (Aimi) It's better to go. >> Don't say something decent all of a sudden.

365
00:21:08,201 --> 00:21:11,237
(♪~) >> “Supo” (Wave) Ah, reply has come!

366
00:21:11,304 --> 00:21:14,707
(♪~) (Aimi) Okay! >> I'm irritated about how you say it.

367
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:18,211
(♪~) (Aimi) Now we're the same group as Kirio-kun!

368
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:21,814
(♪~) Thank you Mitsuta-kun! >> Well...

369
00:21:21,881 --> 00:21:27,553
(♪~) (Aimi) The same group~ The same group as Kirio-kun~ (Nami) That's amazing Aimi-chan!

370
00:21:29,555 --> 00:21:31,858
(Aimi) It's really come true... a date with Kirio-kun.

371
00:21:31,924 --> 00:21:33,893
(Wave) The competition is serious about showing off their wonderful side!

372
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,595
(Momose) Sorry, call me...

373
00:21:35,662 --> 00:21:38,164
(Wave) I was almost in love with it at first sight too.

374
00:21:38,231 --> 00:21:40,566
(Aimi) Let's live a life without choosing anything anymore.

375
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:43,670
(White) Aimi-chan? Hard! Cold!
