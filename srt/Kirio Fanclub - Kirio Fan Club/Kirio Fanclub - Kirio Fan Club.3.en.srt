1
00:00:04,038 --> 00:00:07,108
(Wave) Hey Aimi-chan. (Aimi) Huh?

2
00:00:07,174 --> 00:00:10,144
(Wave) On the sleeve of Kyousa Kirio-kun's shirt →

3
00:00:10,211 --> 00:00:12,446
Did you see Kapikapi rice?

4
00:00:12,513 --> 00:00:15,282
(Aimi) That's obvious, soak it in hot water →

5
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:17,651
I want to eat it as ochazuke.

6
00:00:17,718 --> 00:00:19,754
(Wave) Kirio-kun's umbilical cord also →

7
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:23,424
I want to return it to its original state with hot water.

8
00:00:23,491 --> 00:00:27,061
(Aimi) I wish there were two Kirio-kun.

9
00:00:28,062 --> 00:00:29,797
(Wave) Why?

10
00:00:29,864 --> 00:00:33,401
(Aimi) So, why don't you go on a date with the three of you?

11
00:00:34,068 --> 00:00:35,870
(White) Kirio-kun! (Aimi) Kirio-kun!

12
00:00:35,936 --> 00:00:38,506
(White) Kirio-kun I want to try ice cream over there.

13
00:00:38,572 --> 00:00:40,307
(Aimi) Kirio-kun! Crepe shop over there →

14
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:43,043
There's free toppings! (White) Kirio-kun Kirio-kun!

15
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:44,945
(Aimi) Kirio-kun Kirio-kun! (White) Kirio-kun!

16
00:00:45,012 --> 00:00:47,715
(Aimi) Kirio-kun! (White) Kirio-kun!

17
00:00:47,782 --> 00:00:50,951
No... Kirio-kun is ripping.

18
00:00:51,018 --> 00:00:54,789
(Aimi) If it breaks, I can't go on a date.

19
00:00:54,855 --> 00:00:57,024
(White) Is it a date...

20
00:00:57,091 --> 00:01:00,561
If I were to go to the zoo with Kirio.

21
00:01:00,628 --> 00:01:02,563
(Aimi) Yes, yes, it's out. Anyway, I'll go to the zoo →

22
00:01:02,596 --> 00:01:04,198
Someone who thinks it's fine.

23
00:01:04,265 --> 00:01:06,834
(Waves) The season is summer That day is a hot day →

24
00:01:06,901 --> 00:01:08,736
Kirio-kun gives water from a plastic bottle →

25
00:01:08,803 --> 00:01:10,504
They'll buy it but →

26
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:12,339
The water droplets on my cheeks →

27
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:16,677
Was it a drop of water from a plastic bottle or a sweat dripping from Kirio-kun?

28
00:01:16,744 --> 00:01:18,412
(Aimi) Animals have to do with it!

29
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,450
Also, I won't allow Kirio-kun's sweat-filling course!

30
00:01:22,516 --> 00:01:25,553
That's right, indoors! Put it in an aquarium!

31
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:29,790
(Wave) I understand, the aquarium date is here →

32
00:01:29,857 --> 00:01:32,560
Firstly, the building is dark →

33
00:01:32,626 --> 00:01:34,728
Naturally, the two of them get closer.

34
00:01:34,795 --> 00:01:37,565
So my shoulders bumped into each other →

35
00:01:37,631 --> 00:01:39,667
We both began to get excited.

36
00:01:39,733 --> 00:01:43,737
I went to the jellyfish section and it was so beautiful...

37
00:01:43,804 --> 00:01:45,639
(Aimi) And there she's stumbling on Aimi!

38
00:01:45,706 --> 00:01:48,709
(Wave) Hey Aimi-chan! (Aimi) Hi, keep on going.

39
00:01:48,776 --> 00:01:51,111
(Wave) And bye bye to Aimi-chan.

40
00:01:51,178 --> 00:01:53,714
This time, we headed to the Penguin corner...

41
00:01:53,781 --> 00:01:57,284
(Aimi) But Kirio-kun is somehow excited →

42
00:01:57,351 --> 00:01:59,286
"Sorry Someya-san."

43
00:01:59,353 --> 00:02:03,524
"I found a sea jewel called Miyoshi..."

44
00:02:03,591 --> 00:02:06,060
Ah, rain, my fantasies!

45
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:10,364
(Wave) Ah, you said you were delusional, Aimi-chan.

46
00:02:10,431 --> 00:02:12,266
(Aimi) Hmm.

47
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:16,971
I want to go on a real date with Kirio-kun.

48
00:02:17,037 --> 00:02:33,988
(♪～)

49
00:02:34,054 --> 00:02:51,005
(♪～)

50
00:02:51,071 --> 00:02:56,076
(♪～)

51
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:04,518
(Wave) I see Kirio-kun →

52
00:03:04,585 --> 00:03:06,987
I do walks on weekends and other places.

53
00:03:07,054 --> 00:03:09,390
nice.

54
00:03:09,456 --> 00:03:14,461
(Aimi) It's nice to look like Kirio... Yes.

55
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:16,363
(Wave) Hey, Kirio-kun.

56
00:03:17,031 --> 00:03:19,466
(Aimi) If that's fine →

57
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:23,404
Why not go for a picnic this Sunday?

58
00:03:28,576 --> 00:03:30,210
(Aimi) It's gone.

59
00:03:30,277 --> 00:03:32,780
(White) It was Aimi who started telling me to do it.

60
00:03:32,846 --> 00:03:34,982
A conversation simulation with Kirio-kun.

61
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:36,684
(Aimi) That's right, but →

62
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,787
I never thought it would be such a hollow thing.

63
00:03:41,255 --> 00:03:43,023
(Wave) Ahhh...

64
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:45,159
(Aimi) It's so sad.

65
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:51,065
(Wave) Aimi-chan The cause of this feeling of emptiness →

66
00:03:51,131 --> 00:03:52,766
Which one becomes Kirio-kun →

67
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:54,802
I wonder if it can be resolved?

68
00:03:54,868 --> 00:03:57,972
(Aimi) Does that mean I'm imitating Kirio-kun?

69
00:03:59,306 --> 00:04:02,509
No, I think I should stay with myself.

70
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:04,545
(Wave) Song lyrics? (Aimi) That's right →

71
00:04:04,612 --> 00:04:06,213
I'm too afraid to do it.

72
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,682
(Wave) This won't help but escape from the emptiness.

73
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:11,251
Let's try it, Kirio-kun!

74
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:14,588
(Aimi) What from me? (Nami) This is the first step towards Kirio-kun!

75
00:04:14,655 --> 00:04:17,124
(Aimi) I understand...

76
00:04:18,492 --> 00:04:20,594
“Coughing”

77
00:04:20,661 --> 00:04:23,797
"Ki... Kirio Ken, please."

78
00:04:23,864 --> 00:04:25,499
(Wave) Kirio-kun came to take the interview! ?

79
00:04:25,566 --> 00:04:27,935
(Aimi) What? interview? Don't be kidding me

80
00:04:28,002 --> 00:04:31,005
(Wave) After all, Kirio-kun didn't have a millimeter of elements.

81
00:04:31,071 --> 00:04:33,774
I don't want to make it look similar, so "lol"

82
00:04:33,841 --> 00:04:37,344
I was surprised. (Aimi) Ichiichi: What a good way to say it.

83
00:04:37,411 --> 00:04:41,882
(Nami) Aimi-chan It's no good if you don't observe Kirio-kun more.

84
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:43,684
(Aimi) What? I can observe it.

85
00:04:43,751 --> 00:04:46,053
If you say that, try the waves

86
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,589
(Wave) That's good. (Aimi) Hmm.

87
00:05:05,239 --> 00:05:08,742
(Waves) Hehe! (Aimi) Kirio is gonna be there...

88
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:11,078
Wow, it's so similar.

89
00:05:11,145 --> 00:05:13,681
Kirio-kun is currently in class? (Wave) Yes.

90
00:05:13,747 --> 00:05:16,083
(Aimi) What? Is there anything else you can do?

91
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:18,986
(Wave) So...

92
00:05:19,053 --> 00:05:22,656
"Ah, um, yes."

93
00:05:22,723 --> 00:05:24,491
(Aimi) It's Kirio-kun!

94
00:05:24,558 --> 00:05:26,727
(Wave) "Ah, sorry, uh →

95
00:05:26,794 --> 00:05:30,531
136 pages?" (Aimi) Kirio-kun!

96
00:05:30,597 --> 00:05:34,802
(Wave) "Haha, I really like that kind of thing."

97
00:05:34,868 --> 00:05:38,072
(Aimi) Ha ha ha fog...

98
00:05:38,138 --> 00:05:41,842
What? what? picture? teeth? I've never heard of it now.

99
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:44,244
Nami: What did Kirio say to you?

100
00:05:44,311 --> 00:05:47,881
(Wave) Huh? Not particularly... I imagine it though? (Aimi) Huh? Just replace it!

101
00:05:47,948 --> 00:05:50,751
I'll have to watch the real Kirio-kun!

102
00:05:50,818 --> 00:05:52,720
(Wave) I understand.

103
00:05:54,888 --> 00:05:56,857
(Aimi) "I'm Kirio! Nami-chan, sorry →

104
00:05:56,924 --> 00:06:01,161
I like Aimi! Ahahahaha"

105
00:06:03,997 --> 00:06:07,067
Who is it, damn it?

106
00:06:07,134 --> 00:06:09,203
After all, I can't play Kirio-kun.

107
00:06:09,269 --> 00:06:12,706
In the first place, I can't imitate Kirio-kun.

108
00:06:12,773 --> 00:06:14,374
(Wave) Why?

109
00:06:14,441 --> 00:06:19,113
(Aimi) Because Kirio-kun is a god. (Wave) God?

110
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:22,716
(Aimi) Of course, I want to talk to Kirio-kun and get closer...

111
00:06:22,783 --> 00:06:25,919
It's not something to be treated in such a lighthearted way.

112
00:06:25,986 --> 00:06:30,524
After all, Kirio-kun will be a distant existence for the rest of our lives.

113
00:06:30,591 --> 00:06:33,293
(White) Aimi-chan, look.

114
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,796
Kirio-kun's desk.

115
00:06:35,863 --> 00:06:37,464
(Aimi) Ah!

116
00:06:37,531 --> 00:06:41,735
(Nami) Kirio-kun is not a god, nor is he a distant being.

117
00:06:41,802 --> 00:06:44,004
He's the same human being as us.

118
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:46,206
Because on the desk →

119
00:06:46,273 --> 00:06:48,742
I'm going to write it as a dragon.

120
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,313
(Aimi) Fifth grade!

121
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,616
Waves Thank you, I've woken up!

122
00:06:55,682 --> 00:06:58,185
I can do it Kirio-kun!

123
00:06:58,252 --> 00:07:01,088
I feel like I've learned about Kirio-kun!

124
00:07:01,155 --> 00:07:03,490
I'm sure I can do it as well as the waves right now!

125
00:07:03,557 --> 00:07:05,425
(Wave) So, let's start practicing conversation again.

126
00:07:05,492 --> 00:07:07,494
(Aimi) Yes, I'm Kirio-kun!

127
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:16,003
(Wave) Amazing Aimi...

128
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:17,938
That engui feel →

129
00:07:18,005 --> 00:07:20,774
I think Kirio really can't see it.

130
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:24,278
(Aimi) Someya-san, what's wrong? Talk.

131
00:07:24,344 --> 00:07:26,914
(Wave) Ah! Umm, that.

132
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,582
Um...

133
00:07:28,649 --> 00:07:31,752
What do you think of me?

134
00:07:32,886 --> 00:07:34,488
(Aimi) DRAGON's... (White) Aimi-chan.

135
00:07:34,555 --> 00:07:38,725
(Aimi) Pi! It's impossible after all. My head is full of dragons, so I can't!

136
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:40,828
(Morino) Dragon...Kirio?

137
00:07:40,894 --> 00:07:45,732
"The sound of the entrance bell"

138
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:48,068
(Aimi) Tokugawa Iemitsu Tokugawa Ieyasu →

139
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:49,837
Tokugawa Ietsuna The Tokugawa family...

140
00:07:49,903 --> 00:07:51,839
(Wave) What happened suddenly? Aimi-chan's family?

141
00:07:51,905 --> 00:07:55,242
(Momose) Huh? Are you two studying?

142
00:07:55,309 --> 00:07:57,344
Or is this okay? (Wave) Yes.

143
00:07:57,411 --> 00:08:00,447
Aimi-chan, why don't you come over here?

144
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:07,054
(Momose) Let's go.

145
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,998
(Waves) We'll do some in the bathroom.

146
00:08:18,065 --> 00:08:20,734
(Momose) Well, we'll order it.

147
00:08:20,801 --> 00:08:24,037
(Wave) Yes. (Momose) Kirio Do you eat potatoes?

148
00:08:24,104 --> 00:08:26,840
(Kirio) Ugh, that's fine. (Momose) Oh well.

149
00:08:28,742 --> 00:08:31,812
(Aimi) What should I do? What should I do? What should I do? What should I do...

150
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:33,580
(White) Aimi-chan, calm down.

151
00:08:33,647 --> 00:08:36,817
(Aimi) ♪ Kirio-kun's voice is thrilled in front of me

152
00:08:36,884 --> 00:08:39,453
♪ But for some reason, he has become a confused (wave) rapper.

153
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,256
(Aimi) That's amazing. What are you going to do? I don't know what to talk about.

154
00:08:42,322 --> 00:08:45,759
(Wave) What are you talking about? It's time for the results of your practice to be tested.

155
00:08:45,826 --> 00:08:49,363
(Aimi) That's right... when you see her in front of you.

156
00:08:49,429 --> 00:08:52,699
(Nami) You said that Kirio-kun is the same person.

157
00:08:52,766 --> 00:08:55,702
(Aimi) I see, the dragon...

158
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:58,005
If I'm clumsy enough →

159
00:08:58,071 --> 00:09:02,142
You think we're pooping, right?

160
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:04,211
(Wave) Let's go back Aimi-chan. (Aimi) No, I've waited!

161
00:09:04,278 --> 00:09:06,747
I haven't decided what to talk about yet, and if →

162
00:09:06,813 --> 00:09:08,782
If you ask me, "Did you poop?", how would you answer? →

163
00:09:08,849 --> 00:09:10,450
Shouldn't you simulate it?

164
00:09:10,517 --> 00:09:14,121
(Wave) Hmm, then Aimi-chan will stay here forever.

165
00:09:14,187 --> 00:09:18,091
I'm the only one who's back in my seat and invites Kirio-kun.

166
00:09:18,158 --> 00:09:20,260
On a date. (Aimi) Deh, haa?

167
00:09:20,327 --> 00:09:22,663
What are you suddenly saying? (Wave) It's not a sudden thing.

168
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:24,631
(Aimi) Well, wait, waves! Calm down.

169
00:09:24,698 --> 00:09:26,700
Even if you wait a little longer for the timing.

170
00:09:26,767 --> 00:09:30,504
(White) Aimi's weak waist. (Aimi) Huh? I can even invite you!

171
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:35,242
(Morino) Potato Sorry for keeping you waiting. (Momose) I'm jealous.

172
00:09:35,309 --> 00:09:37,411
What's the first time I've spoken properly?

173
00:09:37,477 --> 00:09:39,880
(Wave) Yes, that's right.

174
00:09:39,947 --> 00:09:41,581
that….

175
00:09:41,648 --> 00:09:45,319
What are the two doing on weekends or on weekends?

176
00:09:45,385 --> 00:09:47,988
(Momose) Saturdays are basically club activities.

177
00:09:48,055 --> 00:09:49,990
On Sundays, I go out to play.

178
00:09:50,057 --> 00:09:54,328
(Wave) Wow, is that so? What about Kirio-kun?

179
00:09:54,394 --> 00:09:56,096
(Kirio) Hmm.

180
00:09:56,163 --> 00:10:00,767
I usually sleep on Sundays.

181
00:10:00,834 --> 00:10:05,339
(White) I see... club activities are tiring.

182
00:10:05,405 --> 00:10:08,375
(Momose) This guy doesn't come often even if I invite him to play.

183
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:10,644
(Wave) That's right...

184
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:16,750
(Aimi) K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K-

185
00:10:16,817 --> 00:10:19,786
(Wave) He said he was sleeping on Sundays.

186
00:10:19,853 --> 00:10:23,757
(Aimi) Kokoko...then this Sunday.

187
00:10:23,824 --> 00:10:26,226
(Waves) Apparently the weather is nice too, so please

188
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:28,428
If it's fine, that's it.

189
00:10:28,495 --> 00:10:32,132
(Aimi) Slurp and twitch!

190
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:38,138
Why not go with your family?

191
00:10:38,205 --> 00:10:41,575
(Kirio) What a picnic?

192
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:44,044
Maybe I'll think about it.

193
00:10:45,512 --> 00:10:48,682
(Momose) That's right, we'll exchange contact details.

194
00:10:48,749 --> 00:10:51,485
Horror Kirio too. (Kirio) Yes.

195
00:10:52,953 --> 00:10:54,921
(Momose) Actually, you're in a class group.

196
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:58,358
Can I add that then? (Aimi) Oh, yes.

197
00:10:58,425 --> 00:11:01,428
Um, mine...this.

198
00:11:02,929 --> 00:11:07,100
(Nami) Is Kirio-kun the guy called "K"?

199
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:08,969
(Kirio) Yes, that's right.

200
00:11:24,051 --> 00:11:26,253
(Morino) Dragon Kyrio...

201
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:33,427
(Aimi) The sky is blue...

202
00:11:33,493 --> 00:11:36,430
The plants are fresh...

203
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:40,967
People are alive...

204
00:11:42,602 --> 00:11:47,074
God is sometimes mean...

205
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:51,678
How helpless I am.

206
00:11:51,745 --> 00:11:55,715
(White) Aimi-chan's behavior is strange.

207
00:11:57,117 --> 00:12:00,654
(Aimi) It's the best, Daro! (Wave) What?

208
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,823
(Aimi) I said it was obvious!

209
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:04,724
Waves, you can't stay sane.

210
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:08,061
I exchanged contact information with Kirio-kun!

211
00:12:08,128 --> 00:12:10,564
(Wave) Are you not happy?

212
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:13,200
(Aimi) At first I was really happy.

213
00:12:13,266 --> 00:12:16,103
But I realized it.

214
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:18,872
That means we know each other's contact information →

215
00:12:18,939 --> 00:12:20,607
In other words….

216
00:12:20,674 --> 00:12:22,843
Kirio-kun sends me anything - the situation →

217
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:25,178
It's probably happening!

218
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:28,215
(Wave) That's been the case before, right?

219
00:12:28,281 --> 00:12:32,552
(Aimi) Yes, I don't understand anything about stupid waves. Is it an IQ6?

220
00:12:32,619 --> 00:12:36,056
Think about it, I don't know about contact information until now →

221
00:12:36,123 --> 00:12:37,791
It's only natural that nothing comes →

222
00:12:37,858 --> 00:12:40,827
In a way, it was a protected situation.

223
00:12:40,894 --> 00:12:44,865
But now I've been freed from those constraints like this.

224
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:48,802
Kirio-kun can send a message to me,

225
00:12:48,869 --> 00:12:51,371
What if they still haven't sent it?

226
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:53,874
It's a broken heart!

227
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,143
(Wave) Ahaha... “lol”

228
00:12:56,209 --> 00:12:58,745
(Aimi) Huh? Oh, what are you laughing!

229
00:12:58,812 --> 00:13:02,082
(White) Because Aimi-chan is wrong.

230
00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:03,750
(Aimi) What?

231
00:13:03,817 --> 00:13:06,319
(Wave) I've proved it myself now

232
00:13:06,386 --> 00:13:09,389
I can't send a message even though I like it.

233
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:11,825
(Aimi) What... (Wave) Kirio-kun is now →

234
00:13:11,892 --> 00:13:15,762
At this moment, I wonder if I'll contact you or send you something →

235
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:19,566
It could be that you're in conflict. (Aimi) What?

236
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:21,968
So you're in love with each other!

237
00:13:22,035 --> 00:13:26,573
What? Was I in love with Kirio-kun?

238
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:31,945
Hey, what are you doing?

239
00:13:32,012 --> 00:13:35,649
１ ２ ３ ４。

240
00:13:35,715 --> 00:13:38,451
(Wave) What? What? Scary Aimi-chan, what? (Aimi) 5 6.

241
00:13:38,518 --> 00:13:41,121
It's counting the number of seconds before it's read.

242
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:44,891
Umm, 20→

243
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:47,060
21 22。

244
00:13:47,127 --> 00:13:50,697
I'll compare which one was read earlier than when I sent it or which one was sent.

245
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:57,237
291 292 293→

246
00:13:57,304 --> 00:13:59,506
294. (Wave) Ah, it's already read!

247
00:13:59,573 --> 00:14:02,008
(Aimi) What? 294 seconds is how many seconds?

248
00:14:02,075 --> 00:14:05,345
(Wave) It's 294 seconds, right? (Aimi) Ah.

249
00:14:05,412 --> 00:14:09,749
Wow! Help me what? What is this stamp?

250
00:14:09,816 --> 00:14:12,819
Kirio-kun, what are you paying for? cute.

251
00:14:12,886 --> 00:14:16,590
Let Kirio-kun, who paid for this, pay for it. Hey!

252
00:14:20,393 --> 00:14:22,062
(White) Aimi-chan.

253
00:14:22,128 --> 00:14:25,131
You're probably trying to send the same thing to Kirio-kun and make an appeal.

254
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:28,868
(Aimi) That's bad. I'll use the waves!

255
00:14:28,935 --> 00:14:31,938
Well, first of all, let's say hello.

256
00:14:32,005 --> 00:14:34,741
Kirio-kun...

257
00:14:34,808 --> 00:14:37,310
Oh no! I just sent "ki"!

258
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:39,913
(White) Aimi-chan It's cancelled the transmission!

259
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:42,449
(Aimi) To and cancelled...

260
00:14:42,515 --> 00:14:44,551
Ah! It's been read!

261
00:14:44,618 --> 00:14:47,087
And for now, stamps...

262
00:14:48,088 --> 00:14:51,458
Kikiki has been read! I'm watching it now!

263
00:14:51,524 --> 00:14:55,829
Oh no, it's so crazy that I'm in Kirio-kun's head right now.

264
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,697
Kirio-kun is in my head →

265
00:14:57,764 --> 00:15:00,834
I'm in Kirio-kun's mind.

266
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,169
The universe for the two is now complete.

267
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:06,573
(Wave) Hey, Kirio-kun seems to be playing something.

268
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,375
(Aimi) Ah!

269
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:11,077
It's here!

270
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:15,982
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, for a long time.

271
00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:17,984
(Wave) It's all lies.

272
00:15:21,221 --> 00:15:25,692
(Aimi) Wow, I did it...!

273
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:28,695
Yes it's over I can't do it, I'm too creepy.

274
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:31,531
It's decided that it's a completely crucial player.

275
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:34,567
A family member's self-satisfaction, a classmate or something else

276
00:15:34,634 --> 00:15:38,305
It's creepy and scary, and it's over.

277
00:15:38,371 --> 00:15:41,041
(Wave) Wait, Aimi-chan, maybe it's okay.

278
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:44,778
See, I have 80,000 followers of Daifuku bastards!

279
00:15:46,346 --> 00:15:48,882
(Aimi) Daifuku bastard!

280
00:15:56,156 --> 00:15:58,191
(Wave) Thank you Wave!

281
00:16:04,331 --> 00:16:07,534
(Waves) Sweat Because...

282
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11,671
(Aimi) Sweat.

283
00:16:14,007 --> 00:16:16,743
sweat. (Waves) Sweat...

284
00:16:32,092 --> 00:16:34,661
>> “The sound of a bicycle bell”

285
00:16:34,728 --> 00:16:36,329
"Bicycle brake sound"

286
00:16:36,396 --> 00:16:39,432
(Aimi, a junior high school student) Grandpa's graduation ceremony is over.

287
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:41,101
(Toranosuke) Wow, congratulations.

288
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:42,936
(Aimi) Thank you, it's crazy, it's not possible!

289
00:16:43,003 --> 00:16:44,904
Because my teeth break.

290
00:16:44,971 --> 00:16:47,974
>> I'll get nutrients and get discharged from the hospital soon.

291
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:51,311
You won't be able to make it in time for Aimi's entrance ceremony, right?

292
00:16:51,378 --> 00:16:55,248
(Aimi) It's okay, it's not allowed to enter at the entrance ceremony.

293
00:16:55,315 --> 00:16:58,151
>> Eh! What's up with now?

294
00:16:58,218 --> 00:17:00,453
(Aimi) It's not the volume of a sick person's voice.

295
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,857
>> Ahhh ha ha.

296
00:17:03,923 --> 00:17:05,892
(Aimi) Well, I'm glad he looked fine.

297
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:07,994
Let's grated this and eat it.

298
00:17:08,061 --> 00:17:10,029
It's grated. >> Yes.

299
00:17:17,003 --> 00:17:18,872
(Middle school student Kirio) And in the end, she was inside the shampoo bottle →

300
00:17:18,938 --> 00:17:21,674
Even if I mix it with rinse, I didn't like it →

301
00:17:21,741 --> 00:17:25,211
Divide it into another container half...

302
00:17:25,278 --> 00:17:27,881
But this is the end

303
00:17:27,947 --> 00:17:30,350
Rinse-in shampoo bottle →

304
00:17:30,417 --> 00:17:33,420
Two bottles are just finished, but haha... "lol"

305
00:17:33,486 --> 00:17:36,856
Sorry I laughed so much that I started crying "lol"

306
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:50,270
(Aimi) It's totally disgusting...

307
00:17:56,876 --> 00:18:00,113
(Aimi) Ki...

308
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:01,781
miracle!

309
00:18:01,848 --> 00:18:04,851
(Male student) Kirio is also in four groups.

310
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:06,586
(Kirio) Ah, it's true.

311
00:18:06,653 --> 00:18:10,089
(Boy student) Please, 1st year. (Aimi) Kirio-kun...

312
00:18:10,156 --> 00:18:12,092
Kirio-kun!

313
00:18:14,027 --> 00:18:15,929
(Kirio) The atmosphere seems to be good too.

314
00:18:15,995 --> 00:18:19,165
Let's get out of the hospital soon and go to high school together.

315
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:34,547
(Aimi) What...

316
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:40,520
>> “Crying”

317
00:18:40,587 --> 00:18:42,722
(Kirio) Nozomi Sorry.

318
00:18:49,829 --> 00:18:52,932
(Kirio) Sorry, sorry Nozomi...

319
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,636
(Kirio) Me...

320
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:01,808
(Kirio) I couldn't make it in time...

321
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:07,180
"cry"

322
00:19:07,247 --> 00:19:09,382
(Kirio) Sorry... sorry...

323
00:19:09,449 --> 00:19:12,519
(Yumiko) Ken... (Kirio) Nozomi...

324
00:19:12,986 --> 00:19:18,892
(Yumiko) Thank you for being with me forever.

325
00:19:19,893 --> 00:19:22,128
