1
00:00:03,471 --> 00:00:07,475
(Tanaka) Verbs are past tense, when they become past participle →

2
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:12,213
Please be aware that there are irregular changes.

3
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:17,885
What is the difference between independent participle and participle syntax?

4
00:00:17,952 --> 00:00:22,723
Even if the participle group and the subject of the main sentence do not match →

5
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:24,658
It can be expressed using participles.

6
00:00:24,725 --> 00:00:26,427
"The sound of a pen falling"

7
00:00:26,494 --> 00:00:28,562
(Tanaka) Independent participle syntax also →

8
00:00:28,629 --> 00:00:31,031
The meaning of the expression is →

9
00:00:31,098 --> 00:00:33,300
Same as participle syntax →

10
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:36,337
I will judge based on the context.

11
00:00:39,306 --> 00:00:41,242
(Mitsuda) Yamagishi.

12
00:00:42,109 --> 00:00:49,984
(Mitsuda) Hit your little finger on the corner of your chest of drawers →

13
00:00:52,286 --> 00:00:54,955
I'm bleeding a little.

14
00:00:56,323 --> 00:00:58,459
(Aimi) Thank you.

15
00:00:58,526 --> 00:01:00,895
Yes. (Mitsuda) Hello.

16
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:12,907
(Mitsuda) Ishizuka.

17
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,109
On the way home →

18
00:01:15,443 --> 00:01:19,647
A strange old man called out to me...

19
00:01:20,981 --> 00:01:24,385
(Male student) Be careful, thank you. (Everyone) Thank you very much.

20
00:01:31,559 --> 00:01:34,128
(Yuna) Hey Mitsuta It's really gloomy and it's impossible.

21
00:01:34,195 --> 00:01:37,565
(Rin) I understand - Life doesn't seem to be fun, lol.

22
00:01:37,631 --> 00:01:40,301
(Yuna) Hey, do you know that? Rumors about Mitsuda Mitsuru.

23
00:01:40,367 --> 00:01:42,670
Collect girls' hair.

24
00:01:42,736 --> 00:01:45,406
(Rin) Is it something that you simmer and make into soup and drink?

25
00:01:45,473 --> 00:01:48,542
(Yuna) That! Kissho!

26
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:51,645
(Aimi) Can you drink it? What hair soup for someone you like?

27
00:01:51,712 --> 00:01:54,448
(Wave) Cold soup is also good.

28
00:01:54,515 --> 00:01:57,184
(Aimi) Is Mitsuda called Mitsuru?

29
00:01:57,251 --> 00:02:00,254
(Wave) It's true that we often hear strange rumors.

30
00:02:00,321 --> 00:02:02,323
Apparently he's doing a suspicious experiment.

31
00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:04,158
(Aimi) Experiment? (Wave) Yes.

32
00:02:04,225 --> 00:02:07,394
They are trying to cultivate human nails and clone them →

33
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:10,397
It is said that they are trying to retrieve DNA from the drool.

34
00:02:12,533 --> 00:02:15,102
(Aimi) Wow...hehehe.

35
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:32,119
(♪～)

36
00:02:32,186 --> 00:02:49,136
(♪～)

37
00:02:49,203 --> 00:02:54,208
(♪～)

38
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:06,253
(♪～)

39
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:10,524
(Mitsuda) Lice It's lice.

40
00:03:10,591 --> 00:03:12,626
Huh, is it a new species?

41
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:16,363
No, no, lice.

42
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:19,466
No, it's a new species Hahaha... “lol”

43
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:22,102
(Aimi) Can you make a machine that reproduces body odor? ?

44
00:03:24,171 --> 00:03:27,107
Well done! (Waves) Salt?

45
00:03:27,174 --> 00:03:29,843
(Aimi) What are you doing all of a sudden? >> Please don't get near!

46
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,645
What are you all suddenly?

47
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:34,081
Unauthorized, I went to my castle. (Aimi) Castle?

48
00:03:34,148 --> 00:03:37,952
This is probably everyone's chemistry room! (Wave) Well, Aimi-chan.

49
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:41,455
Mitsuda-kun, I'm sorry all of a sudden.

50
00:03:41,522 --> 00:03:46,327
We heard that Mitsuda-kun is doing various experiments.

51
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:50,531
(Aimi) I wonder if you could help me out.

52
00:03:50,598 --> 00:03:53,267
Actually, there's someone we like.

53
00:03:53,334 --> 00:03:57,338
I can't say anyone, but I'm a very far-reaching person.

54
00:03:57,404 --> 00:04:00,674
But I want to get closer somehow

55
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:05,079
That's why I thought I could not reproduce it with the power of chemistry.

56
00:04:05,145 --> 00:04:07,314
I can't tell anyone but →

57
00:04:07,381 --> 00:04:09,083
Kirio-kun's body odor.

58
00:04:09,149 --> 00:04:11,719
(White) Aimi-chan is saying it! He's calling him Kirio!

59
00:04:11,785 --> 00:04:14,888
(Aimi) No way! >> I can't do that, but that's it.

60
00:04:14,955 --> 00:04:16,991
(Aimi) Huh? I can't make cloned humans, but

61
00:04:17,057 --> 00:04:18,993
Why can't you make a machine that reproduces body odor?

62
00:04:19,059 --> 00:04:21,228
>> I can't even make cloned humans!

63
00:04:21,295 --> 00:04:23,764
(Aimi) On the other hand, can you make a machine that reproduces bad breath?

64
00:04:23,831 --> 00:04:26,100
>> What "opposite" is it?

65
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:28,969
Ha... I don't know who said it, but →

66
00:04:29,036 --> 00:04:32,640
In the first place, I have not done such a bad experiment.

67
00:04:32,706 --> 00:04:35,876
(Wave) So what do you mean here?

68
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:49,790
>> What I'm doing →

69
00:04:49,857 --> 00:04:52,092
It's a magical technique.

70
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:53,794
(Aimi) Jujutsu?

71
00:04:53,861 --> 00:04:55,963
>> To curse people you dislike or get in the way →

72
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:59,800
I'm trying out a variety of magical techniques.

73
00:04:59,867 --> 00:05:02,536
(Aimi) Curse the person in the way... >> Now you understand.

74
00:05:02,603 --> 00:05:05,973
This is a story that has nothing to do with you, who are full of minds about love.

75
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,409
(Aimi) When a powerful rival appears, his finger hair will be

76
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:10,811
Something like an unusually long curse. (Wave) And then →

77
00:05:10,878 --> 00:05:12,780
A curse that causes perms to smash onto growing finger hair.

78
00:05:12,846 --> 00:05:16,583
>> Have you heard about it? (Aimi) I'm listening to it, isn't it?

79
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:19,186
>> Anyway, please go home quickly

80
00:05:21,455 --> 00:05:23,290
(Wave) Wait.

81
00:05:23,357 --> 00:05:25,693
Curses and spells →

82
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,195
The way of thinking is the same.

83
00:05:28,262 --> 00:05:30,664
(Aimi) What is that?

84
00:05:30,731 --> 00:05:33,333
(Wave) Originally, curse was →

85
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,470
It's meant to remove disasters.

86
00:05:36,537 --> 00:05:40,874
That you can curse something →

87
00:05:40,941 --> 00:05:43,077
The opposite can also be done.

88
00:05:44,378 --> 00:05:46,880
(Aimi) I see. Nami is smart!

89
00:05:46,947 --> 00:05:48,816
Mitsuda! Let's have love with Kirio-kun.

90
00:05:48,882 --> 00:05:51,351
>> What benefits do I have for that?

91
00:05:51,418 --> 00:05:54,822
(Aimi) I'd be happy if you could tell me.

92
00:05:56,924 --> 00:06:00,527
>> I understand. I'll tell you properly (Aimi) I did it!

93
00:06:00,594 --> 00:06:03,864
>> However, one of them won the game.

94
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:07,901
(Aimi) It's all good, this guy >> Did you say something?

95
00:06:07,968 --> 00:06:10,904
(Aimi) This guy is just awful every time!

96
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:12,873
>> K...Don't yell it out near me.

97
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:15,743
(Aimi) Why is she alone, it's not going to decrease.

98
00:06:15,809 --> 00:06:20,447
(Nami) No, Aimi-chan, what Mitsuda-kun is saying might be correct.

99
00:06:20,514 --> 00:06:22,182
(Aimi) Huh? (Wave) Because →

100
00:06:22,249 --> 00:06:24,118
There's only one Kirio-kun.

101
00:06:24,184 --> 00:06:26,720
It's no surprise that both of them will fall in love with each other.

102
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:31,658
(Wave) It's impossible.

103
00:06:32,926 --> 00:06:34,795
(Aimi) If that were the case, it would be a step back.

104
00:06:34,862 --> 00:06:38,732
Mitsuda Tell me a spell! (White) Aimi-chan It's unfair.

105
00:06:38,799 --> 00:06:40,801
(Aimi) Well then, um...

106
00:06:40,868 --> 00:06:44,538
Ah, hair in order of longest! (Wave) Anything like that is fine!

107
00:06:44,605 --> 00:06:48,475
Let's compete in arm wrestling here fairly.

108
00:06:48,542 --> 00:06:51,245
(Aimi) Ha...it's irrelevant.

109
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:59,052
(Aimi) Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, have both hands!

110
00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:02,689
What's fair about this? (Wave) What? It's a handicap to physical differences.

111
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:05,325
This is a serious battle, so the conditions have to be met.

112
00:07:05,392 --> 00:07:07,261
(Aimi) Ah, shut up, I understand!

113
00:07:07,327 --> 00:07:11,331
Even if you have a handicap, you can just win by winning.

114
00:07:11,398 --> 00:07:13,500
Well, start!

115
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:15,903
(Wave) Ugh... (Aimi) Ugh!

116
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:17,571
(Wave) Hmm!

117
00:07:17,638 --> 00:07:19,339
(Aimi) Ah! Hmm!

118
00:07:19,406 --> 00:07:20,941
(Wave) Ugh! (Aimi) Hmm.

119
00:07:21,008 --> 00:07:22,843
(Wave) Ugh! (Aimi) Yes!

120
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:25,979
Yes, huh. (Wave) Ahhhh.

121
00:07:26,046 --> 00:07:29,983
>> Really... how desperate are you guys?

122
00:07:31,385 --> 00:07:34,588
(Aimi) Ha ha... Ah, I understand!

123
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:37,558
That's fine, Mitsuda! You decide. >> It's already annoying →

124
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:39,660
Including which one Kirio-san might choose →

125
00:07:39,726 --> 00:07:41,795
Leave your luck to heaven. (Wave) What?

126
00:07:41,862 --> 00:07:44,198
Does that mean you will tell the two of you?

127
00:07:44,264 --> 00:07:46,333
(Aimi) So, do that from the beginning!

128
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,468
>> Looks arrogant in the position to be taught...

129
00:07:48,535 --> 00:07:51,371
(Aimi) Instead, it's a really effective one.

130
00:07:52,773 --> 00:07:55,375
>> Now, prepare an eraser

131
00:07:56,777 --> 00:07:58,679
Make a wish for your own eraser.

132
00:07:58,745 --> 00:08:01,682
In this case, write "I hope I can fall in love with Kirio-kun" →

133
00:08:01,748 --> 00:08:04,685
If you use it all up without anyone seeing it, your wish will come true.

134
00:08:04,751 --> 00:08:07,421
(Aimi) What? >> So please do your best and use it all up

135
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:10,657
(Aimi) Mitsuda is clearly taking a break.

136
00:08:10,724 --> 00:08:13,093
That's what all elementary school students in this world do →

137
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,296
All the elementary school students in this world are falling out without any problems.

138
00:08:16,363 --> 00:08:19,666
He was completely licked. (Waves) Right.

139
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:24,371
>> I previously won 300,000 yen in lottery.

140
00:08:30,477 --> 00:08:33,513
(Aimi) It's done! This is perfect.

141
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:37,751
I'll have to study a lot to make it all up quickly.

142
00:08:41,421 --> 00:08:44,558
(Aimi) Start dash, it's amazing!

143
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:47,794
What is it?! I wish that would be allowed.

144
00:08:50,597 --> 00:08:52,199
>> What, are you stupid?

145
00:08:52,266 --> 00:08:56,003
(Aimi) I guess it would be faster to burn it. >> Well, that's how I got into high school.

146
00:08:56,069 --> 00:08:59,706
(Wave) No no. Aimi-chan should burn the eraser.

147
00:08:59,773 --> 00:09:02,976
(Aimi) Yes, yes, I understand.

148
00:09:04,645 --> 00:09:06,713
Ahh! Ah, it's hot!

149
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:09,316
(White) Aimi-chan, are you okay? >> You're really stupid.

150
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:11,251
(Aimi) It hurts. (Wave) Ah.

151
00:09:17,491 --> 00:09:21,161
>> "Door opening and closing sound"

152
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:25,799
Was it okay? Miyoshi-san.

153
00:09:25,866 --> 00:09:28,735
(Wave) Yes, I'm going to cool it down now.

154
00:09:28,802 --> 00:09:32,139
You cleaned up, thank you

155
00:09:32,205 --> 00:09:35,108
>> No, more than that, you →

156
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:38,445
When it comes to Kirio-san, it's always like this?

157
00:09:38,512 --> 00:09:41,882
(Wave) Ah, yes, well.

158
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,719
>> That's good, it's easy.

159
00:09:45,786 --> 00:09:48,121
(Wave) What?

160
00:09:48,188 --> 00:09:50,457
>> No hesitation, no doubt →

161
00:09:50,524 --> 00:09:52,492
You can just love people purely →

162
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:55,829
I said it was easy and nice.

163
00:09:57,664 --> 00:10:00,867
Don't fall in love with others, you can't fall in love with them.

164
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:06,173
There's no way I can think of such a person.

165
00:10:06,239 --> 00:10:11,011
This way, you can have fun every day and every day →

166
00:10:11,078 --> 00:10:13,313
I can even feel jealous.

167
00:10:18,251 --> 00:10:22,322
(Wave) Certainly we →

168
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:25,192
Every day is so fun.

169
00:10:26,226 --> 00:10:29,730
But this fun time →

170
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:33,266
I don't think it's because there's someone I like.

171
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:37,170
Because I'm still having fun now.

172
00:10:37,237 --> 00:10:39,272
>> Please don't say something beautiful.

173
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:41,174
(Waves) Even if it's beautiful →

174
00:10:41,241 --> 00:10:44,978
Whether it's fun or hard →

175
00:10:45,045 --> 00:10:46,880
I.

176
00:10:51,551 --> 00:10:56,123
(Wave) I want to cherish this time the most

177
00:11:02,729 --> 00:11:04,464
>> “The sound of the door opening”

178
00:11:04,531 --> 00:11:07,401
(Aimi) Amazing Mitsuda! (White) Aimi-chan, are you okay?

179
00:11:07,467 --> 00:11:09,770
Or rather, did something good happen?

180
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:11,538
(Aimi) Do you want to hear? (Wave) I want to hear it.

181
00:11:11,605 --> 00:11:13,240
>> I don't know. (Aimi) That's it →

182
00:11:13,306 --> 00:11:15,409
I passed Kirio-kun a little while ago →

183
00:11:15,475 --> 00:11:17,577
We talked so much!

184
00:11:17,644 --> 00:11:19,546
(Waves) Extremely full? (Aimi) Yes.

185
00:11:19,613 --> 00:11:21,782
Mitsuda's guy is damn...

186
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:24,718
Wow, Kirio-kun!

187
00:11:24,785 --> 00:11:27,788
(Kirio) Miyoshi-san? (Aimi) Ah, ah...

188
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:30,757
Yes... club activities now? >> Yes.

189
00:11:30,824 --> 00:11:33,260
(Aimi) I see. Club activities That's right.

190
00:11:33,326 --> 00:11:38,632
Ah, Ah, yes, that's club activities!

191
00:11:42,502 --> 00:11:47,074
(Aimi) After all, the amazing spell is working.

192
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:50,277
Thank you Mitsuda! >> What...

193
00:11:50,343 --> 00:11:53,146
(Aimi) I wonder what would be good next.

194
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:55,348
Someone warped into Kirio-kun's room.

195
00:11:55,415 --> 00:11:57,951
(Wave) It's not magic anymore, it's magic.

196
00:11:58,018 --> 00:11:59,786
(Aimi) Because I haven't used up all the erasers →

197
00:11:59,853 --> 00:12:02,289
I was able to talk to Kirio-kun! Isn't it magic?

198
00:12:02,355 --> 00:12:05,125
(White) Hmm, Aimi-chan is just enough to be able to talk.

199
00:12:05,192 --> 00:12:08,762
Kirio-kun talks to me and I end up going home with him.

200
00:12:08,829 --> 00:12:10,630
So, "Someya-san"

201
00:12:10,697 --> 00:12:13,166
It's surprisingly easy to talk to."

202
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:15,936
(Aimi) Nami: Because I couldn't talk to Kirio-kun →

203
00:12:16,002 --> 00:12:20,774
He's probably jealous! (Wave) It's the future that's coming, isn't it?

204
00:12:23,543 --> 00:12:26,179
(Wave) I was so confused that I was able to talk to Kirio-kun →

205
00:12:26,213 --> 00:12:28,048
It was a great achievement for the injury.

206
00:12:28,115 --> 00:12:31,017
(Aimi) What? Injury? proverb?

207
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:33,453
Wave: Don't make a smart appeal.

208
00:12:37,457 --> 00:12:40,327
(Waves) Huh? Aimi-chan walks weird

209
00:12:50,403 --> 00:12:52,772
(Kirio) Oh, Miyoshi-san.

210
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:57,244
(Aimi) Ki... Kirio-kun, can you use it for me?

211
00:12:57,310 --> 00:13:01,181
(Kirio) Have you ever counted the number of moles in your entire body?

212
00:13:02,215 --> 00:13:04,451
(Aimi) But there isn't.

213
00:13:04,518 --> 00:13:06,620
(Kirio) Yes...

214
00:13:06,686 --> 00:13:09,389
(Momose) No, I counted it, and there were 53 of them.

215
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:12,325
I wanted to know if there are a lot or a few.

216
00:13:12,392 --> 00:13:15,328
I've come, let's go.

217
00:13:18,331 --> 00:13:21,067
(Wave) What? The number of moles.

218
00:13:27,374 --> 00:13:31,478
(White) Aimi-chan What is the consultation?

219
00:13:31,545 --> 00:13:33,980
(Aimi) I can't say it out loud though.

220
00:13:39,386 --> 00:13:41,421
(Wave) What?

221
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:43,557
Do you want to make a love song for Kirio-kun?

222
00:13:43,623 --> 00:13:46,860
(Aimi) My voice is stupid, so gross!

223
00:13:46,927 --> 00:13:49,396
Waves can play the piano, right?

224
00:13:49,462 --> 00:13:52,532
That's why I want them to compose it.

225
00:13:52,599 --> 00:13:56,436
(White) Aimi-chan is so emotional.

226
00:13:56,503 --> 00:14:00,073
(Aimi) I thought I fell in love with Kirio-kun →

227
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:05,045
I'm finding more and more fun to see my vision being colored.

228
00:14:05,111 --> 00:14:07,814
I wonder if I can't put this feeling into reality.

229
00:14:07,881 --> 00:14:09,783
(♪～)

230
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:12,085
(♪~) (Aimi) Don't play a terribly tune!

231
00:14:13,486 --> 00:14:16,423
(Wave) So let's start with the lyrics.

232
00:14:16,489 --> 00:14:18,358
I want to think about it together.

233
00:14:18,425 --> 00:14:20,093
(Aimi) It's irresistible.

234
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,096
So let's make one phrase at a time.

235
00:14:23,163 --> 00:14:25,832
(Wave) Ah, Aimi-chan will probably write about organs again.

236
00:14:25,899 --> 00:14:28,435
(Aimi) Don't write it, it's a love song.

237
00:14:43,016 --> 00:14:45,185
(Wave) Which day did you see who's tears?

238
00:14:45,252 --> 00:14:47,420
Suddenly, it's too unrelated to Kirio-kun

239
00:14:47,487 --> 00:14:49,422
(Aimi) Shut up, that's fine.

240
00:14:49,489 --> 00:14:52,192
I wanted it to feel a bit emo.

241
00:14:52,259 --> 00:14:54,127
Hora Next wave.

242
00:15:03,536 --> 00:15:05,305
(Aimi) Are you kidding me?

243
00:15:05,372 --> 00:15:07,641
A good start is the worst.

244
00:15:07,707 --> 00:15:11,912
(Wave) What? So Aimi-chan, don't you want to lick Kirio-kun's tears?

245
00:15:11,978 --> 00:15:14,047
(Aimi) Lick it!

246
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:22,989
(Aimi) It's a phrase that you don't often see in the lyrics.

247
00:15:23,056 --> 00:15:24,958
I'll write about how you want to lick your tears →

248
00:15:25,025 --> 00:15:27,994
I think they corrected the course to explain it.

249
00:15:31,798 --> 00:15:35,101
(Aimi) This is the important part of the A-melo ending!

250
00:15:35,168 --> 00:15:37,504
This isn't a love song →

251
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:39,906
It's a tear-skinned song!

252
00:15:39,973 --> 00:15:42,942
What is a tear-skinned song?

253
00:15:44,144 --> 00:15:47,280
I'll write something that I'll leave it to me for now.

254
00:15:47,347 --> 00:15:49,716
(Nami) Aimi-chan is amazing too, isn't she an amateur.

255
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:51,718
(Aimi) Shut up.

256
00:16:02,195 --> 00:16:05,765
(White) Aimi suddenly looks like a professional.

257
00:16:05,832 --> 00:16:08,668
(Aimi) The strength of her love for Kirio-kun Don't underestimate her.

258
00:16:08,735 --> 00:16:12,138
I'll write it this way. (Wave) Yes!

259
00:16:12,205 --> 00:16:18,845
(♪～)

260
00:16:18,912 --> 00:16:23,316

00:16:23,383 --> 00:16:25,518
