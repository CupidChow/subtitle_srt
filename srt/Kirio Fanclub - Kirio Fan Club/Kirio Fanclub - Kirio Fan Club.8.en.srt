1
00:00:08,376 --> 00:00:10,044
(Kirio) Excuse me.

2
00:00:14,148 --> 00:00:18,185
(Aimi) Kirio-kun, calling him... I wonder if he's okay.

3
00:00:20,588 --> 00:00:24,091
(White) Aimi-chan Have you ever thought about it?

4
00:00:25,326 --> 00:00:27,895
Kirio-kun is about his mother →

5
00:00:27,962 --> 00:00:30,731
What if I called you mom?

6
00:00:30,798 --> 00:00:33,734
(Aimi) Huh? Nami, what if Kirio-kun called him "Mama" →

7
00:00:33,801 --> 00:00:36,303
Are you telling me you don't like it? (Wave) No, I wasn't saying that.

8
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:39,440
But somehow "mama" is →

9
00:00:39,507 --> 00:00:41,809
Are you not nervous?

10
00:00:43,711 --> 00:00:45,780
(Aimi) What exactly does it mean?

11
00:00:45,846 --> 00:00:48,516
(Wave) Most adults don't call you "mama" anymore →

12
00:00:48,582 --> 00:00:50,718
Become a "mother" when elementary school students

13
00:00:50,785 --> 00:00:53,187
I think it's because I naturally switched to it →

14
00:00:53,254 --> 00:00:58,192
What if Kirio-kun, who is currently in his third year of high school, called him "Mama."

15
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:00,461
One day, after dinner →

16
00:01:00,528 --> 00:01:03,197
I'm going to declare it to my mother.

17
00:01:03,264 --> 00:01:07,968
"I'll call you mom today."

18
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:12,139
(Aimi) Wow, I'm getting nervous. (Wave) Right?

19
00:01:12,206 --> 00:01:15,876
I'm sure we'll take the time to make it about three days before that declaration.

20
00:01:15,943 --> 00:01:20,781
"My little sister is in the living room, so I'll stop it now."

21
00:01:20,848 --> 00:01:23,984
So I'll practice in the room.

22
00:01:24,051 --> 00:01:27,087
"Mom, today, ok... →

23
00:01:27,154 --> 00:01:29,323
I'll call you mom."

24
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:31,225
You're going to bite it.

25
00:01:31,292 --> 00:01:34,962
I gradually gotten irritated and started hitting some kind of wall or something.

26
00:01:35,029 --> 00:01:38,966
(Aimi) Oh. (Wave) So my mother got mad →

27
00:01:39,033 --> 00:01:42,870
I'll lose sight of the timing of the declaration again for about a week.

28
00:01:42,937 --> 00:01:47,141
(Aimi) Isn't he over puberty? Don't give it a realism in an unpleasant way.

29
00:01:47,208 --> 00:01:49,143
Kirio-kun, that's not the case.

30
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:51,946
Kirio-kun will never hit the wall.

31
00:01:52,012 --> 00:01:54,381
(Wave) I don't know...

32
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:56,217
So what about Aimi?

33
00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:59,787
Kirio-kun, do you think you're calling your mother?

34
00:01:59,854 --> 00:02:03,791
(Aimi) Huh? Hmm...

35
00:02:05,726 --> 00:02:09,029
(Tanaka) Is it still not decided?

36
00:02:09,096 --> 00:02:12,766
In this case, a three-way interview is also necessary.

37
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:16,403
(Kirio) What... is it a three-way interview?

38
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,672
(Aimi) "Oh my mother"

39
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:21,075
"Bum" might fit well.

40
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:24,245
Kirio-kun's kindness and coolness make him "my mother."

41
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:29,650
You might say things over the phone, "How's your mother lately?"

42
00:02:29,717 --> 00:02:34,154
One day, I felt nostalgic about the taste of the pork soup I made.

43
00:02:34,221 --> 00:02:37,324
"You're so happy..." I'm crying

44
00:02:37,391 --> 00:02:40,561
(White) Sorry, wait Aimi-chan.

45
00:02:40,628 --> 00:02:45,366
Are you talking about 42-year-old Kirio-kun?

46
00:02:45,432 --> 00:02:49,203
Isn't it too early to call "Oh my mother"?

47
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:53,040
After all, Kirio-kun is not "mom" or "mom" →

48
00:02:53,107 --> 00:02:56,944
I think it's safe to call you "mom."

49
00:02:57,011 --> 00:03:01,949
(Aimi) It's safe. What's safe is just the standard for waves.

50
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:04,184
Kirio-kun is Kirio →

51
00:03:04,251 --> 00:03:07,087
It doesn't matter what you call your mother.

52
00:03:07,154 --> 00:03:09,823
(Wave) Is that what it is?

53
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:13,994
What is Aimi's statue of Kirio-kun →

54
00:03:14,061 --> 00:03:16,997
Is that what it is?

55
00:03:17,064 --> 00:03:18,732
(Aimi) Huh?

56
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:20,734
(Wave) Kirio-kun, despite my love →

57
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:24,572
I wonder if it's okay to blur around that.

58
00:03:24,638 --> 00:03:27,875
(Aimi) Huh? Shut up, I'm not squealing at all.

59
00:03:27,942 --> 00:03:29,577
It's so clear.

60
00:03:29,643 --> 00:03:31,445
(Wave) Then Kirio-kun is about his mother →

61
00:03:31,512 --> 00:03:34,248
Maybe I'm calling it something. (Aimi) Ah, that's right, I understand!

62
00:03:34,315 --> 00:03:38,619
It's really starting to see! (Wave) Hmm, what? Are you a mom?

63
00:03:38,686 --> 00:03:40,321
(Aimi) No!

64
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:42,456
(Wave) Mom? (Aimi) That's not the case either.

65
00:03:42,523 --> 00:03:45,225
(Tanaka) Then contact your parents...

66
00:03:45,292 --> 00:03:47,061
(Kirio) Ah, ah...

67
00:03:47,127 --> 00:03:50,864
(Tanaka) Is there any inconvenience? (Kirio) Ah, no, that...

68
00:03:50,931 --> 00:03:54,234
Because I think I'm busy →

69
00:03:54,301 --> 00:03:56,637
Mom.

70
00:03:56,704 --> 00:04:00,107
Ah...no, that...mother.

71
00:04:00,174 --> 00:04:01,909
(Tanaka) Hahaha... “lol”

72
00:04:01,976 --> 00:04:06,280
If that's the case, I have to make sure I don't worry.

73
00:04:06,347 --> 00:04:09,850
My mom. (Kirio) Yes...yes.

74
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:11,552
(Wave) Mother Lord! (Aimi) No!

75
00:04:11,619 --> 00:04:13,220
(Wave) Mum! (Aimi) No!

76
00:04:13,287 --> 00:04:14,888
(Wave) Kaka! (Aimi) No!

77
00:04:14,955 --> 00:04:16,624
(Wave) Dad! (Aimi) Dad?

78
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:18,425
(Wave) Dad. (Aimi) Kirio-kun says "daddy" →

79
00:04:18,492 --> 00:04:20,661
That's strange. (Wave) Then it's a bit.

80
00:04:20,728 --> 00:04:22,997
(Aimi) Chichi? So, what do you call your real dad?

81
00:04:23,063 --> 00:04:25,633
(Wave) Old man. (Aimi) No, that's why old man?

82
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:27,668
(Wave) Father! (Aimi) I won't call you.

83
00:04:27,735 --> 00:04:44,685
(♪～)

84
00:04:44,752 --> 00:05:01,702
(♪～)

85
00:05:01,769 --> 00:05:06,874
(♪～)

86
00:05:09,109 --> 00:05:15,683
(Wave) This is a problem: The order to abolish swords was issued in 1876.

87
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:19,353
What is Kirio-kun's lunch yesterday?

88
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:22,456
(Aimi) A purchasing curry bread! (Wave) Right!

89
00:05:22,523 --> 00:05:24,758
(Aimi) Ahhh with Kirio-kun →

90
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:28,462
I want to suck the contents from both sides of the curry bread.

91
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:30,931
(White) Aimi-chan has a strange face. >> “Shutter Sound”

92
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:32,700
(Aimi) Nami, what are you laughing?

93
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:35,269
(White) Can I send this photo to Sakirio-kun?

94
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:38,305
(Aimi) That's fine, isn't it? Hey, don't send it.

95
00:05:38,372 --> 00:05:42,743
(Wave) I understand. (Aimi) It's just a secret between the two of them!

96
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:45,079
(Wave) Yes, it's a secret.

97
00:05:45,145 --> 00:05:48,782
(Aimi) Tekasa Kirio-kun, what will he go to in the career path?

98
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:51,385
I hope to go to the same university a lot.

99
00:05:51,452 --> 00:05:55,856
(Wave) Ah, I was thinking of saying that... (Aimi) Huh?

100
00:05:55,923 --> 00:05:59,293
(Wave) The other day you issued a career path request questionnaire, right?

101
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:02,863
I could see it at that time...

102
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:07,201
Kirio-kun's third request was blank...

103
00:06:09,403 --> 00:06:13,774
(Aimi) Wave...this is a chance! (Wave) What...?

104
00:06:13,841 --> 00:06:16,110
(Aimi) Because Kirio-kun's career path hasn't been decided, so it's no surprise →

105
00:06:16,176 --> 00:06:19,179
That means there's still a chance that you can go to the same university.

106
00:06:19,246 --> 00:06:21,949
(Wave) That's if you're going to go to university.

107
00:06:22,015 --> 00:06:24,218
(Aimi) If you're in the same high school and university, then it's good →

108
00:06:24,284 --> 00:06:27,221
Maybe we can find employment, family, and graves together?

109
00:06:27,287 --> 00:06:31,992
(White) Aimi-chan is surprisingly the type who fits into the shape.

110
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:36,063
(Aimi) Shut up, you don't want to get hooked on anything other than the type. Who is Kirio-kun?

111
00:06:37,498 --> 00:06:41,068
No, wait.

112
00:06:41,135 --> 00:06:43,103
If there is something other than the mold you can get hooked on →

113
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:45,939
I would like to keep an attitude that I can always get hooked.

114
00:06:46,006 --> 00:06:49,243
(White) I mean, Aimi-chan is doing mathematics?

115
00:06:49,309 --> 00:06:51,545
(Aimi) This "miracle" that allowed Kirio-kun to meet him →

116
00:06:51,612 --> 00:06:54,515
It's based on the probability perspective.

117
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:01,088
(Wave) I saw the digits for the first time...

118
00:07:02,456 --> 00:07:04,892
(Momose) Kirio I'm quitting club activities.

119
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:07,895
(Satsuki) What? (Momose) Well then.

120
00:07:07,961 --> 00:07:11,431
(Satsuki) Summer tournament is coming soon. (Momose) Well, that's fine...

121
00:07:11,498 --> 00:07:14,234
That guy is a turn I wish he was left alone.

122
00:07:14,301 --> 00:07:16,303
I don't know though.

123
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:21,508
(Seira) Huh?

124
00:07:28,182 --> 00:07:29,883
(Hoshira) Thank you for your hard work.

125
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,785
(Morino) Ah, thank you Tashiro-san.

126
00:07:31,852 --> 00:07:35,322
I've been working a lot lately, but are I OK with club activities?

127
00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:38,659
(Shora) Ah, I'm off club activities.

128
00:07:38,725 --> 00:07:41,428
(Morino) Oh! Is that so? (Seirah) Hmm...

129
00:07:41,495 --> 00:07:43,831
There's no point in being there.

130
00:07:43,897 --> 00:07:46,400
Kirio Senpai quits club activities →

131
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:50,003
Because Aimi-senpai and Nami-senpai no longer come to watch club activities.

132
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:53,106
Dragon Kirio The soccer club has left.

133
00:07:53,173 --> 00:07:56,009
(Seirah) Well, when I think about it →

134
00:07:56,076 --> 00:07:58,545
It's not a regular or anything →

135
00:07:58,612 --> 00:08:02,216
I was originally bad at soccer, and I've been even worse lately.

136
00:08:02,282 --> 00:08:04,384
(Morino) That's right...

137
00:08:04,451 --> 00:08:08,722
(Shora) Also, it seems like things have been wrong lately.

138
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:12,826
(Seirah) Is it adolescence? I don't know what it is, but →

139
00:08:12,893 --> 00:08:17,431
I have to make Kirio-senpai more energetic, it's a problem.

140
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:21,301
I don't want to see my two favorites feeling sad...

141
00:08:22,636 --> 00:08:24,872
(Morino) I see.

142
00:08:24,938 --> 00:08:28,041
(Seirah) Ha... I'm curious after all.

143
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:32,145
(Shora) I'll look into Kirio-senpai!

144
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:36,717
"The sound of the door opening and closing" (Morino) What is the shift today?

145
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:48,161
(Shora) Hey hey hey hey hey!

146
00:08:48,228 --> 00:08:49,897
This is bad.

147
00:08:49,963 --> 00:08:53,200
Me, Kirio-senpai, is too low!

148
00:08:58,105 --> 00:08:59,940
My favorite...

149
00:09:00,007 --> 00:09:04,711
It's no exaggeration to say that it's a relative of second grade...!

150
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:17,157
(Seirah) I'm not excited at all.

151
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:22,396
Ah, it's so fun to follow those two.

152
00:09:24,097 --> 00:09:27,601
No... This is also to protect my favorite smile!

153
00:09:27,668 --> 00:09:31,104
Install your special gaze!

154
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:32,873
Appe!

155
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:54,261
(Foggy Tail) Look….

156
00:09:54,328 --> 00:09:58,799
(Seira) Nozomi... Shinkansen?

157
00:09:58,865 --> 00:10:01,435
Maybe Tetsu otaku! ?

158
00:10:01,501 --> 00:10:06,473
(Kirio) I... I just broke my promise

159
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,508
(Seirah) Promise...?

160
00:10:08,575 --> 00:10:11,078
(Kirio) The soccer club has also stopped.

161
00:10:12,913 --> 00:10:17,351
(Kirio) And I also ended up not floating in the bathtub yet.

162
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:21,989
(Seirah) What? Poo in the bathtub?

163
00:10:22,055 --> 00:10:24,658
(Kirio) He told me to laugh, but →

164
00:10:24,725 --> 00:10:27,027
I can't laugh at all.

165
00:10:30,697 --> 00:10:33,700
(Kirio) I'm tired already.

166
00:10:42,275 --> 00:10:44,444
(Foggy Tail) Look.

167
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:50,017
(Kirio) I might want to go too... that's it.

168
00:10:51,451 --> 00:10:54,621
(Seira) Which one is that? ? ?

169
00:10:57,391 --> 00:11:01,495
(Shora) Kirio-senpai goes over there! ?

170
00:11:01,561 --> 00:11:03,697
What should I do? It's bad...

171
00:11:03,764 --> 00:11:07,768
In the end, I don't know anything about Kirio-senpai...

172
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:10,504
Hmm...

173
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:12,806
Calm down, Hoshira.

174
00:11:12,873 --> 00:11:15,375
There must be other ways.

175
00:11:15,442 --> 00:11:19,012
Remember Kirio-senpai's actions...

176
00:11:21,314 --> 00:11:26,753
(Kirio) Sorry I accidentally got involved in taping...

177
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:29,856
(Aimi) Ugh, it's okay...

178
00:11:29,923 --> 00:11:35,429
(Kirio) I mean, maybe it was actually this way

179
00:11:35,495 --> 00:11:37,664
(White) Kirio-kun...!

180
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:45,072
(Seirah) Huh? Is this official?

181
00:11:45,138 --> 00:11:47,307
Was it a fantasy...

182
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:50,110
Ah, it's true for otaku.

183
00:11:50,177 --> 00:11:53,180
It's no longer possible to distinguish between formula and delusion...

184
00:11:53,246 --> 00:11:58,051
No, no, no, more based on historical facts...

185
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,855
Ah...

186
00:12:04,524 --> 00:12:07,527
(Shora) Please! Please tell me about Kirio-senpai!

187
00:12:08,128 --> 00:12:10,330
(Mitsuda) What? Who is it? Suddenly.

188
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:13,066
(Shora) Anyway, I want you to let me know!

189
00:12:13,633 --> 00:12:15,802
I was watching.

190
00:12:15,869 --> 00:12:18,371
When you're on the field trip, you'll be with Kirio-senpai →

191
00:12:18,371 --> 00:12:20,740
We're talking intimately. (Mitsuda) What, why are you studying outside the school...

192
00:12:20,807 --> 00:12:23,176
(Seirah) Please do not touch it.

193
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,812
I have to know more.

194
00:12:25,946 --> 00:12:27,981
About Kirio-senpai.

195
00:12:29,116 --> 00:12:31,551
(Mitsuda) Is that what it means...

196
00:12:31,618 --> 00:12:35,122
You too like Kirio.

197
00:12:35,188 --> 00:12:36,790
(Seirah) What?

198
00:12:36,857 --> 00:12:40,560
(Mitsuda) I can't even tell you anything even more.

199
00:12:40,627 --> 00:12:43,029
I have to be obedient to myself too.

200
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:45,866
I feel hesitant to be my friends' rivals →

201
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:48,235
It's about sending salt.

202
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:52,939
(Seira) A rival to my friends...

203
00:12:54,007 --> 00:12:55,976
(Shora) Hey hey hey.

204
00:12:56,042 --> 00:12:58,812
Here's where my favorite foods are here!

205
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:00,614
(Mitsuda) What?

206
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:04,551
(Seirah) Well, you knew I had little friendship!

207
00:13:04,618 --> 00:13:08,054
It's so vogue, there's a service spirit!

208
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:13,260
(Seirah) I took it as just your pride!

209
00:13:13,326 --> 00:13:16,796
With that excitement in my heart, I can jump even higher!

210
00:13:16,863 --> 00:13:19,132
(Mitsuda) What? (Shora) I'll do some research myself!

211
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:21,234
thank you very much!

212
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:27,707
(Mitsuda) Hmm...

213
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:33,380
There are only weird people who like Kirio.

214
00:13:34,614 --> 00:13:38,752
(Nami) Kirio-kun retired from club activities early →

215
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:43,023
I wonder if it was to get serious about taking the exam...

216
00:13:43,089 --> 00:13:45,258
(Aimi) Hmm...

217
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:47,827
(Momose) Huh... do your best!

218
00:13:47,894 --> 00:13:50,330
(White) Ah Momose-kun... what's wrong?

219
00:13:50,397 --> 00:13:53,733
(Momose) I'm trying to get some forgotten items... (Wave) That's right...

220
00:13:55,969 --> 00:13:58,672
(Momose) That's great, studying? (Wave) Yes.

221
00:13:58,738 --> 00:14:01,608
Momose-kun's career path has been decided? (Momose) Yes.

222
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:03,843
I think I can recommend sports.

223
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:06,479
(Aimi) Eh, amazing.

224
00:14:06,546 --> 00:14:08,348
(Momose) Well then.

225
00:14:08,415 --> 00:14:11,718
(Aimi) Ah, that's it. (Momose) Yes?

226
00:14:11,785 --> 00:14:14,020
(Aimi) What is Kirio-kun →

227
00:14:14,087 --> 00:14:16,356
I wonder what will happen in the university?

228
00:14:16,423 --> 00:14:21,461
(Momose) Ah, I don't know, I.

229
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:25,565
(Aimi) Ah, I see... wouldn't you talk about that kind of thing?

230
00:14:25,632 --> 00:14:27,634
(Momose) Yes, it won't.

231
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:31,471
I don't... what do I mean now →

232
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:33,807
It's a bit sloppy isn't it?

233
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:36,076
(Wave) What's subtle?

234
00:14:41,181 --> 00:14:45,018
>> Actually, there was a bit of a dispute the other day.

235
00:14:45,085 --> 00:14:48,822
Kirio just stopped working as a club →

236
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:51,258
It's a bit awkward.

237
00:14:51,324 --> 00:14:53,860
(Wave) That's right...

238
00:14:53,927 --> 00:14:57,230
>> Well, it's a silly thing

239
00:14:57,297 --> 00:15:02,202
(Nami) I mean, Kirio-kun is fighting...

240
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:05,305
>> No, it's like a fight →

241
00:15:05,372 --> 00:15:08,241
I'm one-sided.

242
00:15:10,377 --> 00:15:14,948
What the hell is there a cold guy, right?

243
00:15:15,015 --> 00:15:18,151
I don't know what you're thinking.

244
00:15:18,218 --> 00:15:22,389
So I thought, "I'd like to be a little more friendly."

245
00:15:24,524 --> 00:15:28,094
But I also listened to it silently.

246
00:15:28,161 --> 00:15:30,630
I'm getting irritated.

247
00:15:31,631 --> 00:15:33,700
Because →

248
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:37,237
Someya-san invited me to do a movie...

249
00:15:37,304 --> 00:15:39,572
(Aimi) That's not true.

250
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:41,775
different….

251
00:15:41,841 --> 00:15:45,845
Kirio-kun isn't cool →

252
00:15:45,912 --> 00:15:49,282
Amiraculous It's not so bad, really...

253
00:15:51,518 --> 00:15:55,555
It's really amazing, I laughed happily.

254
00:15:59,092 --> 00:16:00,927
>> I see.

255
00:16:00,994 --> 00:16:04,364
I won't show you that kind of thing to me.

256
00:16:04,431 --> 00:16:07,033
(Aimi) Ah, no... not that.

257
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,803
What do you mean...

258
00:16:14,841 --> 00:16:18,778
(Aimi) I don't even know that Peach Taro.

259
00:16:18,845 --> 00:16:20,447
Shaking the waves is correct.

260
00:16:20,513 --> 00:16:23,550
(Wave) Stop talking about that too...

261
00:16:28,855 --> 00:16:30,990
(Wave) Hey Aimi-chan, just now →

262
00:16:31,057 --> 00:16:34,461
Kirio-kun said he would laugh a lot, but...

263
00:16:35,462 --> 00:16:37,831
He laughed so much with joy.

264
00:16:40,433 --> 00:16:42,035
(Aimi) Ahhh!

265
00:16:42,102 --> 00:16:44,871
That's right, um.

266
00:16:44,938 --> 00:16:47,907
Actually, Nami: Have you ever seen Kirio-kun's smile?

267
00:16:47,974 --> 00:16:50,310
Dasse, soooo good.

268
00:16:50,377 --> 00:16:54,214
(Wave) You've seen smiles before! (Aimi) Wow.

269
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:58,518
So I'll show you that kind of wave! (Wave) What?

270
00:16:58,585 --> 00:17:01,654
(Aimi) It's definitely Kirio-kun's best smile.

271
00:17:01,721 --> 00:17:04,457
wave! Leave it to me tomorrow after school!

272
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:09,229
(White) Aimi-chan, what do you want to do? I'm scared.

273
00:17:09,295 --> 00:17:16,569
>> “Chime Sound”

274
00:17:18,004 --> 00:17:20,140
(Aimi) Amazing.

275
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:31,751
(Aimi) Do you have some time from now on? Tell me about soccer.

276
00:17:33,686 --> 00:17:35,555
(Kirio) What...? (Aimi) Ah, this?

277
00:17:35,622 --> 00:17:38,057
This is my grandpa and his friends,

278
00:17:38,124 --> 00:17:40,593
I want you to teach soccer for exercise.

279
00:17:41,961 --> 00:17:44,731
(Toranosuke) Aimi... I guess I made friends...

280
00:17:44,798 --> 00:17:47,734
(Aimi) Hahaha... “lol” (Toranosuke) Hey!

281
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:50,970
(Kirio) A bit...

282
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:53,039
(Aimi) Kirio-kun We'll be going with you too, so it's fine!

283
00:17:56,242 --> 00:18:01,047
(Toranosuke) Haa, ah, haa, haa...

284
00:18:16,729 --> 00:18:20,567
(Aimi) Hey, old man, you're not very fit!

285
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:24,571
(Toranosuke) Ah, it's the Sanzu River where you can see the river.

286
00:18:24,637 --> 00:18:27,240
(Aimi) It's a real river! (Male A in his 70s) I haven't done it!

287
00:18:27,307 --> 00:18:32,145
(Female in my 70s) It's impossible for me to play ball games.

288
00:18:32,212 --> 00:18:35,048
(Male B, 70s) Hey, everyone is going home.

289
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:48,428
(Aimi) Kirio-kun...

290
00:18:51,498 --> 00:18:55,568
(Aimi) Ah, thank you Kirio-kun, ball.

291
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:57,837
(Kirio) Yes...

292
00:18:57,904 --> 00:18:59,672
(Aimi) Actually →

293
00:18:59,739 --> 00:19:01,541
Soccer is an excuse.

294
00:19:01,608 --> 00:19:03,743
Oh, you know, we couldn't go to a movie together.

295
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:07,180
I thought it would be better to play outside like this!

296
00:19:08,281 --> 00:19:10,483
It can also be used as a breather when studying for the exam →

297
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:13,219
Above all, Kirio's favorite soccer →

298
00:19:13,286 --> 00:19:16,055
I think it would be fun if we could do it together!

299
00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:22,328
>> I see.

300
00:19:22,395 --> 00:19:24,664
That's right.

301
00:19:25,698 --> 00:19:28,635
What do you do like this... →

302
00:19:28,701 --> 00:19:32,272
It must be fun for the two.

303
00:19:33,439 --> 00:19:35,608
(Aimi) What...

304
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:37,310
Ah, yes! It's fun.

305
00:19:37,377 --> 00:19:40,413
But Kirio-kun too... >> Me... →

306
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,651
It's not particularly fun at all.

307
00:19:44,717 --> 00:19:48,588
(Wave) What? What's wrong, Kirio-kun suddenly.

308
00:19:48,655 --> 00:19:51,491
>> Suddenly?

309
00:19:51,558 --> 00:19:53,459
It's not sudden.

310
00:19:56,629 --> 00:19:59,198
forever….

311
00:19:59,265 --> 00:20:03,102
Forever, forever, forever...

312
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:07,373
tough. >> "The sound of a soccer ball falling"

313
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:15,048
(Aimi) I'm sorry Kirio-kun, that...

314
00:20:16,449 --> 00:20:21,054
I just wanted Kirio to laugh like I used to...

315
00:20:22,889 --> 00:20:24,757
>>Huh?

316
00:20:24,824 --> 00:20:27,160
What is that?

317
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:31,064
(Aimi) Ah... that...

318
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:33,266
>> Miyoshi-san →

319
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:35,702
What do you know about me?

320
00:20:39,138 --> 00:20:43,242
Even though I don't know anything...

321
00:20:43,309 --> 00:20:45,111
Don't say anything irresponsible!

322
00:20:45,178 --> 00:20:47,614
(♪~) Kirio-kun, that's it...

323
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,683
(♪～)

324
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,418
(♪~) (Aimi) That's right.

325
00:20:52,485 --> 00:20:56,255
(♪~) (Aimi) Sorry, Kirio-kun! Forget everything!

326
00:20:56,322 --> 00:20:59,826
(♪~) What a moment, Aimi! wait a minute!

327
00:20:59,892 --> 00:21:09,602
(♪～)

328
00:21:09,669 --> 00:21:12,372
(♪~) (Seirah) It's an emergency...

329
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:15,808
(♪~) >> Aimi Senpai Nami Senpai...

330
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:18,511
(♪~) Wait a minute, Aimi-chan, wait!

331
00:21:18,578 --> 00:21:21,047
(♪~) Aimi-chan... Aimi-chan!

332
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:27,553
(♪～)

333
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:30,590
(♪~) What kind of feelings?

334
00:21:30,657 --> 00:21:33,559
(♪～)

335
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:35,662
(♪~) Aimi-chan?

336
00:21:35,728 --> 00:21:37,563
(♪～)

337
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:41,401
(♪~) Aimi-chan? what happened?

338
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:43,169
(♪~) Aimi...

339
