1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:00,950
My head hurts.

3
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:10,050
How did I get here?

4
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:14,830
Yul.

5
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,480
Are you sober now?

6
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,450
Why did you drink so...

7
00:01:29,539 --> 00:01:30,510
Also,

8
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:32,900
what do you expect me to do when you just black out like that?

9
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:35,539
I had such a hard time carrying you to the bed with this arm.

10
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:39,030
Did you carry me to the bed?

11
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,910
Otherwise,

12
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:42,470
do you think you just went and slept there on your own accord?

13
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:47,350
Are you seeing someone?

14
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:51,250
What?

15
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:51,970
Bro.

16
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:53,900
I'm asking if you're seeing someone.

17
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:55,850
Yes.

18
00:01:59,039 --> 00:01:59,530
I am.

19
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:01,820
What?

20
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,810
I'm seeing someone.

21
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,979
Why do you have so many questions...

22
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:26,650
I'm sorry.

23
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:31,250
You got drunk and talked a lot,

24
00:02:31,329 --> 00:02:32,880
vomited, and made such a scene.

25
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,610
And now you're saying you don't remember anything?

26
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:40,550
Not all of it.

27
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:43,910
But there's something I know I don't want to remember.

28
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:45,390
What?

29
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:47,860
Nothing.

30
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:50,300
I'm really sorry

31
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:52,900
about yesterday.

32
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:58,590
Then...

33
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,420
I'll get going.

34
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:01,730
Huh?

35
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:16,329
Goodbye, bro.

36
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:23,460
What's wrong with him?

37
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:27,940
Was I too harsh?

38
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:41,320
What's up, man.

39
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,220
Chan, why do you look unhappy?

40
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:48,430
Brother.

41
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,900
What should I do now?

42
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,400
Did you confirm how you feel yesterday?

43
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:00,070
You like Chief Baek's grandson, right?

44
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:03,660
Oh!

45
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:07,090
But why do you look so...

46
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:08,910
He said he's seeing someone.

47
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:09,660
Goodness.

48
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,730
What should I do now?

49
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,130
I've confirmed my feelings.

50
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:18,089
Chan, if he's seeing someone, then that's it.

51
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:21,410
It's not right to keep going.

52
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:23,540
It's right to give up.

53
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:25,300
I know.

54
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,470
Stay away from Chief Baek's grandson for now,

55
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,840
until you get over him.

56
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:33,600
Okay.

57
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:40,030
[Bro Yul]

58
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,760
Brother!

59
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,090
He's calling. What should I do?

60
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,050
Should I answer it for you?

61
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:47,120
No.

62
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,390
I can keep my distance from him without others' help.

63
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:59,060
Yes, bro.

64
00:04:59,300 --> 00:04:59,720
Are you busy?

65
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:00,590
No.

66
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:03,200
Grandpa suddenly asked me to send him a package.

67
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,040
Okay. I'll be right there.

68
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:08,940
Brother, I'll be right back.

69
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:11,040
Chan, you just said you wanted to keep a distance from him.

70
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:12,070
I'll be right back.

71
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:14,630
Gosh.

72
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,700
Look how happy he is.

73
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:21,840
Sorry to bother you.

74
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:23,050
It's inconvenient for me because of my arm.

75
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,130
Bro, come on.

76
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:27,820
I'm glad you asked for my help.

77
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:28,800
But still...

78
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,490
Bro, do you want to get groceries at the supermarket on the way?

79
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:33,610
The supermarket?

80
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,510
The post office is far from here,

81
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,360
so we all send packages at Neodeul Supermarket.

82
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:41,510
Bro, is there anything you want to eat?

83
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:42,710
Oh.

84
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:45,250
There's a shop that sells delicious Korean sweet pancakes.

85
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:46,570
Korean sweet pancakes?

86
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:48,010
Sure, let's eat that.

87
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,690
Hello, Yul.

88
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,040
Hertz?

89
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:42,260
So you are Hertz,

90
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:43,820
the genius composer.

91
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,200
I'm your fan.

92
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:35,990
When I become a musical actor,
I want to work with you.

93
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,490
I'll sing the songs you compose.

94
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:45,750
Wouldn't that be great?

95
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:59,200
[Every moment is you
Every moment shines brightly
You were my only light
Afraid I'd lose my way if I let go of your hand
Filling my precious song
With my voice meticulously]

96
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,650
I was so nervous at the audition hall.

97
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,830
I can do better if I get to do it again.

98
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,240
It's okay.

99
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:18,520
Should I give up here?

100
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:21,080
Inseo.

101
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,450
You will succeed.

102
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:25,840
Okay?

103
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:51,610
Say it again.

104
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:58,170
I like him.

105
00:08:58,820 --> 00:08:59,280
I like Inseo.

106
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,080
Is this the time for you to act like this?

107
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:04,610
You're so foolish.

108
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:13,910
I'll give up on music

109
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:17,620
as per your wish.

110
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,610
[Inseo: k]
[Don't forget to have your lunch
I haven't heard from you in a while...
Where are you?
At the practice room?]

111
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,750
[Inseo: Sorry ): I didn't see your message because of the dinner gathering.
I'm going home now.]

112
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:51,280
Let's go.

113
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:52,060
Okay.

114
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:58,640
Are you still practicing?

115
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:01,630
Yes, I'm alone in the practice room.

116
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,100
Yul!

117
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:45,720
You're always like this.

118
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:47,340
You always do whatever you want.

119
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,180
What a cold welcome.

120
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:51,630
I traveled a long way to get here after all.

121
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:54,080
I was serious

122
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:56,130
when I asked to take a break from each other.

123
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:58,290
Yul.

124
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:00,510
Are you still angry?

125
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:04,200
I really have nothing to do with that guy.

126
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:05,940
It really was a misunderstanding.

127
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:09,300
What did you say?

128
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,310
[Manager]

129
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,190
Don't tell me...

130
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,300
you're skipping your musical meetings again?

131
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,030
It's just practice anyway.

132
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:28,560
Then why didn't you answer my calls?

133
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:30,470
And what's with that arm?

134
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,960
That's not important right now.

135
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:34,620
Gosh, I've already told you many times that I'm sorry.

136
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:36,640
Isn't that enough?

137
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,220
You really...

138
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,600
I need some fresh air.

139
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:57,150
Yechan.

140
00:11:58,580 --> 00:11:59,350
I'm sorry, but...

141
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:01,730
could you send the package for me?

142
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,420
Yes, I'll do it for you.

143
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:05,740
Thank you.

144
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:07,910
It's not a big deal.

145
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:12,160
Wow... your grandpa's place is really nice.

146
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:15,310
You should've asked me to come along instead of coming here alone.

147
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,880
Is he bro's boyfriend?

148
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:29,360
He's handsome and refined indeed.

149
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:30,760
I...

150
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,760
I'm no match for him.

151
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:36,140
What am I talking about? Why would I be his opponent?

152
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:38,500
I've decided to give up, didn't I?

153
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:41,480
You're just bro's friend, okay?

154
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:43,620
A friend that helps him out

155
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:45,830
when he needs help.

156
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:49,540
Chan, you're here.

157
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:51,170
Yes.

158
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:55,100
He said this package is to be sent to Seoul for the chief.

159
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,290
Is that so?

160
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:58,630
How's the chief?

161
00:12:58,790 --> 00:12:59,970
He said the chief's fine.

162
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,210
That's great.

163
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:04,330
Chan, wait here. I'll go get the delivery bill.

164
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:05,040
Okay.

165
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,760
Even if we're just friends,

166
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:12,670
it's still okay to give gifts, right?

167
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:28,420
Your hobby is so cute.

168
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:32,870
It's not for me.

169
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:36,150
I heard that bro used to play the piano.

170
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:38,600
So, as a gift...

171
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:41,950
Um...

172
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:43,820
Can I have a look at it?

173
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:46,900
Oh, sure.

174
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,070
What are you doing?

175
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:57,630
This...

176
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,530
You don't know how much pain this will bring to Yul, right?

177
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:02,270
Why?

178
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:04,890
And so what if you find out why?

179
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:06,550
What?

180
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:08,180
What are you going to do if you find out why?

181
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,120
You're insignificant to Yul anyway.

182
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,150
Yechan.

183
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:30,750
Are you crying?

184
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:32,680
N-No.

185
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:33,340
What is it?

186
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:34,640
What happened?

187
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,450
Nothing.

188
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:43,760
We just had a chat.

189
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:46,940
Korean sweet pancakes!

190
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:52,280
The Korean sweet pancake place was closed.

191
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:55,210
I was really craving for it...

192
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,450
Did you really crave this that much?

193
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:08,490
Yes.

194
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,930
I buy it every time I go to the supermarket.

195
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,230
Thank you, bro.

196
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:25,490
Your arm hasn't even healed yet...

197
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:28,630
It's okay. Eat up.

198
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:34,660
Ouch, it's hot.

199
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:37,390
Eat slowly. It's all yours anyway.

200
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:40,720
You have one too.

201
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,110
I told you to eat it all.

202
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:49,810
That's too much. You didn't even ask me if I want one?

203
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:52,880
Have one, please.

204
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:55,190
Don't you dislike sweet food?

205
00:15:57,210 --> 00:15:58,240
I'm just kidding.

206
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:00,630
By the way, Mr. Yechan, how old are you?

207
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:03,260
I'm 20 years old.

208
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:05,810
Oh... so you're a college student?

209
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:08,130
No, I'm farming.

210
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:10,360
Wow, that's impressive.

211
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:12,910
There's nothing impressive about that...

212
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:14,830
Right, Mr. Yechan, have you watched a musical before?

213
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:20,730
Come to Seoul. I'll give you a ticket.

214
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:23,540
Okay.

215
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:25,110
By the way, Yul,

216
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:26,530
where's your room?

217
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:28,410
There's a bed, right?

218
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:34,230
You're leaving now?

219
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:35,890
Yes.

220
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:40,150
Since your friend's here too,

221
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,900
I'll get going.

222
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:44,020
But it's so late already.

223
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:46,630
Take care.

224
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:49,530
Okay.

225
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:51,670
And...

226
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:57,330
I'll be busy and can't go with you when you have to remove your cast...

227
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,350
It's okay.

228
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,710
Don't worry.

229
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,440
I can go with him.

230
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:05,859
Then I'll get going.

231
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:07,599
Okay, be careful.

232
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,990
I guess it's right for me to back off.

233
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:54,300
That's the right choice.

234
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:00,070
I...

235
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:02,990
know nothing.

236
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:11,800
And I'm a nobody.

237
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:43,800
This feels nice, like we're on a trip together. It's been a while.

238
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:47,800
Why don't I stay here for a few days?

239
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:54,270
You've changed a lot.

240
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:08,140
I'm tired.

241
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:10,000
Aren't you going to sleep?

242
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:10,860
Let's...

243
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:12,190
have a talk.

244
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,680

[Neodeul Hospital]

248
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:32,750
Does it hurt?

249
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:34,320
No.

250
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:36,820
You might need some time to get used to it.

251
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,400
You'll need your guardian's help...

252
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:42,670
Why didn't he come with you today?

253
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:44,110
The tall guy with the large frame...

254
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,280
He's busy.

255
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:57,590
Are you going to keep ignoring your manager's calls?

256
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:01,220
Forget it.

257
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:10,560
Why did you suddenly stop?

258
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,280
Inseo.

259
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,670
If you're not going to drive, then I'll go for a smoke.

261

263
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:51,520
Fine.

264
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:53,060
Let's go back together then.

265
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:54,940
What?

00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,500
Let's go back to Seoul together.

272
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:13,740
Okay?
