[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:50,650
Why are you barging into the house of someone you just met?

3
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,060
- Sir, you can't do this.
- I told you to move!

4
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:54,580
My gosh, seriously.

5
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,940
According to Article 366 of Criminal Law,

6
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:03,380
you can be sentenced to three years in prison or 7 million KRW fine.

7
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:04,560
Fine? What are you talking about?

8
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:05,840
If you abuse animals,

9
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:08,930
you can be sentenced to three years in prison or 30 million KRW fine.

10
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:10,440
Animal abuse?

11
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:12,330
I caught you red handed. How dare you say it's not abuse?

12
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,520
You even stole other people's dog.

13
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:15,810
What? What did I steal?

14
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,870
That dog isn't yours.

15
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:18,140
It doesn't seem to be your dog either.

16
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,039
Move aside!

17
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:20,080
No.

18
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:20,990
I said get move aside!

19
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,110
I refuse.

20
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:23,150
You...

21
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:24,080
Who do you think you are?

22
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:33,710
Goodness.

23
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,680
What are you doing?

24
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:37,810
He suddenly barged in.

25
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:39,850
Trying to take Dongshik away.

26
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:40,750
D-dongshik?

27
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:43,360
How do you know his name?

28
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:44,229
What about it?

29
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,580
It's my grandpa's dog.

30
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:46,900
What?

31
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:49,240
Oh.

32
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:51,850
You're the guy who was looking for the dog.

33
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:54,580
So the dog in the photo is Dongshik?

34
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,770
They are of totally different body sizes though.

35
00:01:58,190 --> 00:01:59,000
Oh!

36
00:01:59,450 --> 00:01:59,910
What?

37
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:02,510
- Are you Chief Baek's grandson?
- What?

38
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:04,580
Yes, that's right.

39
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,300
Really?

40
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:07,370
Yes.

41
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:11,580
Hey.

42
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,160
Why is that dog wet all over?

43
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:17,300
It looked dirty. I wanted to bathe it.

44
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:19,850
But he suddenly...

45
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:28,579
Hey. But why is he wet too?

46
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,980
Are you going to bathe him too?

47
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,079
Are you going to bathe him?

48
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,210
No, what are you talking about?

49
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:39,660
Dongshik, come here. Let's go.

50
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:41,540
I'm really fine.

51
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,600
What do you mean? Your clothes are wet.

52
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:45,680
It'll dry soon.

53
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,680
I won't dry that fast.

54
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:51,280
I'm really fine.

55
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:54,950
No. Chan isn't normally like that.

56
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,970
He thinks of Dongshik as his younger brother

57
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:59,880
and didn't think too much.

58
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:00,920
Sorry.

59
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,250
I'm sorry.

60
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,960
No, I misunderstood you too.

61
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:09,780
I even splashed water on you.

62
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,200
I'm really sorry.

63
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:11,850
It's okay.

64
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:17,720
What are you doing? Go get some clothes.

65
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:18,390
Okay.

66
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:34,360
Oh my.

67
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:35,560
So dazzling.

68
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,200
You're still shining even from a distance.

69
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:39,800
Is it because you're from Seoul?

70
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,860
Oh, and this.

71
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:44,230
- I'll do it myself.
- I'll wash it for you.

72
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:51,500
- Oh my god. He only knows farming.
- His skin is so dark.

73
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:52,640
In inherited this from you.

74
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:55,320
When I was young, I was as pale as white jade.

75
00:03:55,329 --> 00:03:56,240
I guess you don't know what white jade is.

76
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,190
You're hopeless. Do you want to die?

77
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,860
I'll get going then.

78
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:03,670
Hey, you...

79
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:05,530
I'm cooking right now. Leave after eating.

80
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:06,200
What?

81
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:07,220
It'll be ready soon.

82
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,070
No, it's okay. I...

83
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,030
I have to go somewhere. I have to go.

84
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:12,920
Oh, really?

85
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:13,230
Yes.

86
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:13,850
Where are you going?

87
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,370
I'm going to the supermarket.

88
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:21,459
I'm have to buy a lot of daily necessities. I have to go.

89
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:24,040
The supermarket?

90
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:24,700
Yes.

91
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,490
I see.

92
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,350
What?

93
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:31,020
What are you talking about?

94
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:34,409
It's okay.

95
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,810
- Ma'am, it's fine.
- Goodness.

96
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:44,400
Ma'am, it's really, really fine.

97
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:46,500
Come on, get in.

98
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:52,180
Here.

99
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:54,430
What are you doing?

100
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:55,550
Drive safely.

101
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,270
- Okay.
- Okay.

102
00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:00,440
Dongshik, go on a date with your mom.

103
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:04,370
Put on your seat belt. Seat belt.

104
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:05,500
Okay.

105
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:10,540
It's here.

106
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,380
What's wrong with this?

107
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,290
It's an old car.

108
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:21,060
Let me help you.

109
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:22,540
No, I can do it myself.

110
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:57,220
You don't have to give me a ride.

111
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:00,390
It's on my way anyway.

112
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,870
And I did something wrong too.

113
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:04,810
I feel sorry.

114
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,240
Okay.

115
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,450
But I misunderstood you too.

116
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,530
You really don't have to worry about what happened just now.

117
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:17,700
By the way,

118
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,980
how old are you?

119
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:22,560
I'm 27. You can speak comfortably...

120
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:24,310
Sure, bro.

121
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:26,670
Bro?

122
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:28,610
I'm 20 years old.

123
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:29,670
I can call you bro, right?

124
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:30,840
What?

125
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,540
You don't like it?

126
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,000
No, that's it it. Uh...

127
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,470
Mister.

128
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:37,380
Mister?

129
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:41,900
I can call you bro, right?

130
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:43,990
Yeah, sure.

131
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:58,800
Okay, let's get off.

132
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:11,960
By the way, did you get home safely yesterday?

133
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,530
It was raining so heavily and your car was stuck in the mud.

134
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:16,960
That's why I kept looking.

135
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:22,900
Why does he keep looking at me?

136
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:28,240
Oh...

137
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:30,760
So you were looking so seriously at the car?

138
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:32,730
Yes, I was worried.

139
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,110
Yes. Thanks to you, I got home safely.

140
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,400
Thank goodness.

141
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,280
Oh, right I heard the chief's grandson is studying law, and he's really proud of that.

142
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:44,470
Are you that grandson?

143
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:45,940
Yes.

144
00:07:46,659 --> 00:07:49,710
- Wow you're really amazing
- No.

145
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,070
You must be really smart.

146
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,590
That's why you said the law right away just now.

147
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:57,930
You're so cool.

148
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,690
I didn't go to college.

149
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,270
My mom was really sad.

150
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:04,220
Well...

151
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:06,000
I don't know what others think,

152
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:08,170
but I really like farming.

153
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:11,170
And I don't regret it at all.

154
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:16,430
Am I talking too much by myself?

155
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:21,230
Doing what you like

156
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:22,970
is really cool.

157
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:32,669
Why?

158
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,900
Uh... Nothing.

159
00:08:38,929 --> 00:08:40,220
Bro.

160
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:43,000
Why are you being cool all by yourself?

161
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,330
Does it hurt?

162
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:49,800
This is the supermarket?

163
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,400
Yes, don't underestimate it. There's nothing it doesn't sell.

164
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,920
Chan, you're here.

165
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,220
Hello, Grandma.

166
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,480
How have you been, Grandma?

167
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:03,280
I'm glad you're here.

168
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:05,520
I made some rice beverage.

169
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,480
Take some.

170
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,850
My gosh, it must've been tiring for you to make it.

171
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,520
You should have it yourself.

172
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:12,220
I made it for you.

173
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,420
It was raining so heavily that day. You and Village Head Ma worked hard.

174
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:21,140
If you hadn't fixed the roof for me, my shed would have flooded.

175
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:22,700
It's nothing.

176
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,560
Take it.

177
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:24,790
I'll take it.

178
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,680
Thank you, I will eat it well, Grandma.

179
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:30,640
Hello.

180
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,380
- Chan, you're here.
- I'll do it.

181
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,540
I'm a strong man.

182
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:35,870
Gosh, thank you so much.

183
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,060
Who are you?

184
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:53,720
You look familiar.

185
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:56,970
Well...

186
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:01,090
He's the grandson of Chief Baek from Seoul.

187
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,750
Yes, I'm Seon Yul.

188
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,100
Nice to meet you.

189
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:08,300
He's handsome.

190
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,640
He studied law in Seoul.

191
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:15,180
He can become a lawyer, a prosecutor, a judge.

192
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:16,950
He does that kind of work.

193
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:20,490
My goodness. He's amazing.

194
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,590
Do you want some coffee?

195
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:24,830
Hey.

196
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,830
Go get some ice cream.

197
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:29,860
Thank you.

198
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:33,650
What about you? Do you want some coffee?

199
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:34,940
No, it's okay.

200
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,360
Drink it. It's okay.

201
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,280
It's okay.

202
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:46,590
How was yesterday?

203
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:47,680
Yesterday?

204
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:51,170
Gosh, I've cleaned everything up.

205
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:55,120
There's nothing to worry about as long as Yechan is here.

206
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:57,730
Complimenting me like this makes me embarrassed.

207
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:01,090
If it weren't for you, this countryside wouldn't be able to operate normally.

208
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:04,600
Village Head Ma is here too.

209
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,690
Yes.

210
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:06,210
You do it.

211
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:15,540
Everyone here is kind and nice, right?

212
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:18,600
Yes.

[Strong Farmer]

214
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:34,110
But, do you find me uncomfortable?

215
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:35,590
What?

216
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:37,990
You drop the honorifics with me.

217
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,760
You can relax when you talk to me.

218
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:44,250
You're seven years older than me.

219
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:46,350
Okay. I will take it slowly.

220
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,530
I don't think you should eat this.

221
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:56,760
Mr. Yechan, let's go.

222
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,650
Is he interrupting me?

223
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:02,630
Are you going to pay?

224
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:03,960
Yes, please.

225
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:17,840
Thank you, Mr. Yechan.

226
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:18,580
You're welcome.

227
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:19,680
Take care.

228
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,780
I'll be on my way.

229
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:36,000
Bro.

230
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,080
Take this with you.

231
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:43,510
The rice beverage from the old lady at the supermarket.

232
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,230
It's for you, though?

233
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:47,900
I have another bottle.

234
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:51,020
It's okay. I don't like rice beverage.

235
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,320
Don't say that. Take this back and have a taste.

236
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:55,900
Grandma's rice beverage is really good.

237
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:00,850
Bro, take it back.

238
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:01,900
I'm really okay.

239
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:04,330
This is how the villagers live.

240
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:06,050
Share good food with each other.

241
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,320
We help each other when we're in trouble.

242
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:08,730
So, bro,

243
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:10,370
you don't have to feel burdened. Take it back.

244
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:13,180
I shall leave. Enjoy it!

245
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:15,610
You can't ask me for it later.

246
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,350
They're overly kind.

247
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,940
It's time to eat.

248
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,030
Did you sleep well?

249
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:29,960
Good boy.

250
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:32,380
Eat up.

251
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,940
You're eating well.

252
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:16,170
Hi, Village Head.

253
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:23,200
Hey, have some of this.

254
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:25,670
It's good for your health and it tastes good.

256
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:27,030
Thank you, sir.

257
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:36,110
It's delicious.

258
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:44,270
Did something good happen?

259
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:47,630
Yes, I think

260
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:49,450
I've made a new friend in a long time.

261
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:50,630
Friends?

262
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:51,640
Friend?

263
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:53,030
Chan.

264
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:54,960
I'm Chan's friend too.

265
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,340
Aren't we friends?

266
00:15:57,610 --> 00:16:00,940
You're 24 years older than me.

267
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,050
We are not really friends...

268
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,240
Chan, age means nothing to me.

269
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:07,940
Besides,

270
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,800
no one ever says I look 44 years old.

271
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,640
Of course. You look very young, Mark.

272
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:16,100
By the way, that friend you mentioned,

273
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,460
is that tall guy who ran around with you yesterday?

274
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,230
Did you see him too?

275
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:24,080
He's really handsome, isn't he?

276
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:26,700
He has fair skin,

277
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,510
and is handsome.

278
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,540
He's also very smart...

279
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:33,470
Chan, you can't judge a person by his looks.

280
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,120
I don't judge people by their looks.

281
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:36,560
Then what?

282
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:42,990
It's cool to do

283
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:44,620
what you like.

284
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:46,710
Then what's the reason.

285
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:49,710
There's a reason.

286
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:51,370
Chan.

287
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:52,760
You're keeping a secret from me?

288
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:54,040
That's too much.

289
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,470
Yes, Chief.

290
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:08,560
Yes.

291
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:12,040
Really?

292
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:14,170
Yes, I got it.

293
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:39,090
Did you just wake up, bro?

294
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:40,350
Let's go.

295
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,410
How did you...

296
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:46,000
How did you get in here?

297
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,400
This is clearly trespassing.

298
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:51,010
Chief gave me the key.

299
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,480
I have to feed the fish.

300
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:04,120
I got the card. Let's go.

301
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:05,980
Where are we going?

302
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:08,310
Farm experience.

303
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:11,120
Didn't Chief ask you to do it?

304
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:12,210
Farm experience?

305
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:14,560
He didn't tell me that.

306
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,860
Chief called me

307
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:21,250
and asked me to take you there.

308
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,290
No way.

309
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:26,620
Anyway, I got a good volunteer. It's nice.

310
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:27,910
What volunteer?

311
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,340
We're going to be late. Let's go.

312
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:34,510
Wait. I need to make a call.

313
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:42,060
Grandpa.

314
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,650
What is this farm experience out of nowhere?

315
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,390
I've never done that before–

316
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:48,240
Chan will help you a lot.

317
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:49,230
Don't worry.

318
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:53,310
- Grandpa...
- What? It's best to do physical work when you're lost in your thoughts.

319
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:55,830
Sleeping pills...

320
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:57,150
That's it. Do well!

321
00:18:58,130 --> 00:18:58,660
Grandpa!

322
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:00,970
Grandpa...

323
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:08,320
Bro Yul,

324
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,050
I'll go to the car first.

325
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:24,580
Every year, there are students from

326
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,940
Hope Orphanage who comes to experience.

327
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:30,270
Just think of it as having fun with them.

328
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:33,810
Time flies when you're with the kids.

329
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:35,910
Farming isn't that difficult either.

330
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:39,530
Just follow me. You're smart.

331
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:40,460
- You can learn very quickly...
- Mr. Yechan.

332
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,350
Yes?

333
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:43,250
Just drive quietly.

334
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:54,240
You're so mean.

335
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:56,510
What?

336
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,450
Why do you keep calling me Mr. Yechan?

337
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:00,050
Why?

338
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:01,580
I'm calling you bro.

339
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:03,430
Why are you still calling me with honorifics?

340
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:04,770
Just call me Yechan.

341
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,690
-That's good– 
-Be careful!

342
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:18,280
Are you okay?

343
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:21,350
I...I'm really sorry.

344
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,790
I'm sorry. I keep saying I will drive you.

345
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:26,070
I knew it'd always run out like this.

346
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,850
That's not important right now.

347
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,510
-Are you okay, bro?
-Yechan.

348
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:32,610
I'm asking if you're okay.

349
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,510
Why is my heart beating so fast?

350
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:22,950
bro.

351
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:25,400
Kids are like strawberries.

352
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,280
We have to treat them carefully so they won't get hurt.

353
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,410
- I will feed it to those who have their mouths opened first.
- Ah...

354
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:30,340
Excuse me.

355
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:32,190
It's rude of you

356
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,730
to answer someone's phone.

357
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:35,330
Bro.

358
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,210
I'm leaving first.

359
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:38,090
Bro!

360
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,520
Did something happen between you and Joohee?
