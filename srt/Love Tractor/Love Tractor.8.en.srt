1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:53,260
Do you think I can't find you

3
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,000
if you hide?

4
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:00,720
I just need some time.

5
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:01,670
What?

6
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,190
Instead of going to Harvard,

7
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:06,330
you're hiding in this small countryside.

8
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,080
What time do you need?

9
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,110
Does that make sense?

10
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:12,230
You loser.

11
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:15,250
Are you going let this chance go to waste in such an important time on impulse?

12
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:18,720
Go pack your things.

13
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:25,450
I'm not acting on impulse.

14
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:27,120
What?

15
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:31,000
After seeing you,

16
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:32,420
I've made up my mind further.

17
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:36,320
I quit.

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:37,450
Law school.

19
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:38,240
You punk.

20
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:43,800
You're not going to let go?

21
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:47,940
I didn't get hit

22
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:49,620
because I couldn't stop it all this while.

23
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:51,140
What?

24
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,009
I don't want to be interfered by you anymore.

25
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,570
From now on, I will be living my own life,

26
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,220
doing what I want to do.

27
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:03,130
Please stay out of my life.

28
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:16,060
Wooshik.

29
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:18,060
Bro will be fine, right?

30
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:23,810
I'm so worried I'm going to die.

31
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:26,900
That's right.

32
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:29,410
How would you know how I feel?

33
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,880
The atmosphere was so scary yesterday.

34
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,790
I can't stand it anymore.

35
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:47,100
Bro! Are you in there?

36
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:52,790
What's all this?

37
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:57,510
Brother!

38
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:09,310
Brother.

39
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:11,840
You're here.

40
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,510
What's all this?

41
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:19,450
The friend I met yesterday sent me the equipment.

42
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:20,410
They arrived this morning.

43
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:21,850
All of these?

44
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:22,960
Yes.

45
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:25,630
I said I'd do it so he sent it to me right away.

46
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:26,360
Wow.

47
00:03:27,329 --> 00:03:29,760
So you're going to start music again?

48
00:03:32,329 --> 00:03:33,350
Yes.

49
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:39,900
Good luck.

50
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:42,329
Your father

51
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,930
will understand in the future.

52
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:53,050
Bro!

53
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,329
Is there anything I can help with?

54
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:58,410
Well...

55
00:03:58,510 --> 00:03:59,260
Just tell me.

56
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,470
I'll do my best to help you.

57
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:05,750
Oh. There is one thing.

58
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:06,230
Yes?

59
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:07,230
What is it?

60
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:09,490
I can't focus if you're here.

61
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:19,170
Bye.

62
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,420
You're too much.

63
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,080
Am I really that annoying?

64
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,020
You said you'd help me with anything.

65
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:27,100
That's true, but...

66
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:27,500
Go ahead.

67
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,050
I'll call you when I'm done.

68
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:30,360
Bro!

69
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:33,580
You didn't even say goodbye properly.

70
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:36,550
How heartless.

71
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,100
I don't have any appetite.

72
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:40,610
Son.

73
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:42,550
You've eaten a whole bowl of rice.

74
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,840
Even if I don't have an appetite, I should eat up.

75
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,110
What kind of nonsense is that?

76
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,670
I'm saying this because I feel empty.

77
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,080
Son...

78
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:57,900
Are you going crazy? I'm scared.

79
00:04:58,630 --> 00:04:59,810
I'm already crazy.

80
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:02,730
Eat more if you're crazy.

81
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:03,750
Okay?

82
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:04,500
I'm going to eat more anyway.

83
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:06,250
Okay, let's start with the soup.

84
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,770
Yul, I miss you so much.

85
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:19,980
Bro, have you been well?

86
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,110
Are you okay?

87
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:25,910
I'm fine.

88
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:29,150
Isn't it heavy?

89
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:31,700
This is nothing. It's not heavy at all.

90
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:34,100
Yechan, I'm the one who finds it heavy.

91
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:35,860
Move it quickly.

92
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:37,330
Okay.

93
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:43,710
I thought my arm was going to break.

94
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:44,560
Bro,

95
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,610
I think my heart is going to break.

96
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,870
Lovesickness is scary.

97
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:04,120
Be quiet, Dongshik.

98
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,200
Dongshik, be quiet.

99
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,920
I'll just peek at your brother's hair and come out.

100
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:15,570
Okay?

101
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,650
I won't get in bro's way.

102
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:20,800
I'll just take a peek and come out.

103
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,120
Be quiet.

104
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:40,730
What's going on?

105
00:06:58,380 --> 00:06:58,550
Bro?

106
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:01,170
Bro!

107
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,030
Bro!

108
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:06,210
Are you okay?

109
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:15,050
You're not a normal stubborn.

110
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,780
You look so pale. Why aren't you going to the hospital?

111
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,410
I didn't sleep for a few days. What's there to go to the hospital for?

112
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,640
You're not eating either, are you?

113
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,730
Look at your skinny frame.

114
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,210
Are you an idiot?

115
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,190
Can't you eat and sleep?

116
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,210
Yechan, are you mad?

117
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:37,070
No, I'm not mad.

118
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:38,310
I'm just speechless.

119
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:39,370
Really?

120
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:42,420
Do you know how shocked I was when I saw you fainted there?

121
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:45,580
If I really listened to you and didn't come to see you, what would have happened?

122
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:47,590
You're really mad.

123
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:49,610
I'm not mad!

124
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:50,630
Seriously.

125
00:07:52,659 --> 00:07:55,370
You're the only one who worries about me.

126
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:00,260
I'm glad you know.

127
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:04,550
Bro.

128
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:07,010
Can you take back telling me to go home?

129
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:08,270
Okay?

130
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:13,100
I know I'd be a hindrance to your work,

131
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,670
but I really...

132
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,190
Just like a TV,

133
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,790
I will be just be here quietly.

134
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:22,440
Just leave me at home.

135
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:23,540
TV?

136
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:26,860
Yes. Just take me as a TV.

137
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:29,510
I can't not see you.

138
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:36,020
It's about 60 inches, right?

139
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:37,289
What?

140
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,110
If you're a TV.

141
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,820
Does that mean I can stay here?

142
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:48,970
Yes.

143
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:54,600
Then why make say something so difficult to understand?

144
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,920
I almost couldn't understand.

145
00:08:58,450 --> 00:08:59,820
Why are you laughing?

146
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:01,520
Seriously.

147
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,640
You know you're handsome when you smile.

148
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:06,540
At times like this...

149
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,260
Bro!

150
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:28,430
Let's eat first.

151
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:32,410
Thank you.

152
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:27,930
Giving a bracelet

153
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:30,810
means this person means a lot to me.

154
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:32,210
What?

155
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:33,410
That's what it means.

156
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,820
Hang in there, bro!

157
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:37,790
No!

158
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,080
No!

159
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:51,510
I like you.

160
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:55,080
I like you.

161
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:57,840
Bro.

162
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,190
Keep making music.

163
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,140
Okay?

164
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,570
Bro, please continue.

165
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,110
Bro!

166
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:32,970
What happened?

167
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:49,570
I'm done.

168
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:53,940
Whoa. It's been hard on you!

169
00:12:57,730 --> 00:13:00,160
Congratulations, bro!

170
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:01,990
It's all thanks to you.

171
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,260
When did I...

172
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:06,020
I didn't do anything.

173
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:10,500
Thank you so much.

174
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,660
Come on. Do you want to see my heart explode?

175
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:27,540
Bro!

176
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,760
Can't you play that song for me?

177
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:32,990
What?

178
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,430
Can't you play it for me?

179
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:05,890
Whoa! Bro!

180
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:07,370
This song is really great.

181
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:09,270
This song will be a hit.

182
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:12,860
You don’t know the latest music, do you?

183
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,290
Of course I know.

184
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:19,040
I listen to the recent top 100 songs.

185
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:36,250
Yechan.

186
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:38,500
What?

187
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:39,840
Give me your arm.

188
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:41,490
Why?

189
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:48,970
What? You're giving me this?

190
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:52,250
You want me to do something so childish by myself?

191
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:52,920
This...

192
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:55,890
Then this is a couple bracelet with you?

193
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,510
Well...

194
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:58,740
Something like that...

195
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,420
Are we a couple?

196
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:04,950
You gave me a bracelet.

197
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:08,760
I...

198
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:10,410
From now on,

199
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:12,550
you're very important to me.

200
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:18,780
Couple?

201
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,310
Dongshik, let's eat.

202
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:36,690
Hello?

203
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,270
Hey.

204
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:38,960
What's with this song?

205
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:41,220
It's not your style.

206
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:42,100
Why? What's wrong?

207
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:43,240
You don't like it?

208
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:44,040
No.

209
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:45,390
I like it so much.

210
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:48,310
Hey, Seonyul, what's wrong with you? Did something good happen?

211
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,180
The song is exploding with sweetness.

212
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:50,700
Really?

213
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,370
Everyone in the company is going crazy. Everyone wants to see you immediately.

214
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:56,060
Let's finish the rest in Seoul. Okay?

215
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:56,710
What?

216
00:16:57,270 --> 00:16:59,130
I found a studio for you.

217
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:02,400
In Seoul?

218
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:05,119
Yes. You just have to come. You know what I mean right?

219
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,210
We'll talk about the details when we meet.

220
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:09,140
When do I have to go?

221
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:22,579
Dongshik.

222
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:24,300
Will Yechan be okay

223
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:26,619
if I go to Seoul?

224
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:39,350
So nice.

225
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,430
The weather is nice too.

226
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:47,190
Aren't you riding too slowly?

227
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:48,840
Hey!

228
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:51,340
Hurry up.

229
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:54,270
Oh!

230
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:56,950
You're faster than I thought.

231
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:05,110
I'm going ahead.

232
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:08,480
You go first. I'll catch up.

233
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,330
Follow me.

234
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:29,370
That's cool.

235
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,410
Hurry up.

236
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:05,860
We just have to go this way.

237
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:15,300
Be careful.

238
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:17,840
This is it.

239
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:21,400
I've always wanted to show it to you.

240
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,420
Bro!

241
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:28,920
Isn't the scenery amazing?

242
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:36,390
Come down quickly.

243
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:38,110
The water is cold and nice.

244
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:41,390
Oh!

245
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:44,230
The 60-inch TV fell into the water.

246
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:45,860
What?

247
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:48,680
Are you going to continue treating me like a TV?

248
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:54,410
I'm sorry.

249
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:56,800
Do you want to see how strong TV is?

250
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:57,900
I said I'm sorry.

251
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:00,440
It's too late.

252
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:02,280
Wait!

253
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:03,270
Wait.

254
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:10,480
Wait. Wait.

255
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:12,930
What?

256
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:16,300
Gosh.

257
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:44,910
Wow.

258
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:50,830
Wow.

259
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:54,990
It's suddenly raining.

260
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:58,450
It's a nice rain, though.

261
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:01,710
You're right.

262
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:06,920
I...

263
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:10,030
want to play with you every day.

264
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:15,610
Right?

265
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:17,790
Yes.

266
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:19,750
I had fun too.

267
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:34,330
Yechan.

268
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,370
-Right... -Bro!

269
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:37,560
Hm?

270
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:42,860
Can you

271
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,370
grant me a wish?

272
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:48,620
Before you go to Seoul.

273
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,330
Did you know?

274
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:02,270
No, how did you know?

275
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:05,060
Dongshik told me.

276
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:07,140
Dongshik.

277
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:09,070
Will Yechan be okay

278
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:11,340
if I go to Seoul?

279
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:21,770
Yechan, what's your wish?

280
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:23,890
Hold on.

281
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:41,430
What are you doing?

282
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,830
Pick it up!

283
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:48,500
Hello.

284
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:51,130
You're right next to me. What are you doing?

285
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:53,150
Look at your phone. Hurry.

286
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:57,230
Okay.

287
00:22:58,800 --> 00:22:59,810
What did you do today?

288
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:05,140
It's been a while since I slept in.

289
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:06,940
I came to the stream.

290
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:09,930
What else?

291
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,790
What else?

292
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:13,360
Ah.

293
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:15,690
I saw a 60-inch TV swimming.

294
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:17,500
Seriously?

295
00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:18,620
Goodness.

296
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:20,410
You told me to look at my phone.

297
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:23,590
This is practice.

298
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:25,500
Practice for when we are apart.

299
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:29,670
In this way,

300
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:31,300
we can see each other's face

301
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:33,750
even when we are far apart.

302
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:45,620
Bro.

303
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:48,240
Just go to Seoul.

304
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:52,880
Write lots of great songs there.

305
00:23:57,170 --> 00:23:57,890
When you go to Seoul,

306
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,770
call me every day.

307
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:02,290
That's my wish.

308
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:11,490
Is it too much if it's every day?

309
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:14,080
Once every two days?

310
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:17,790
Or once every three days?

311
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:45,370
Bro!

312
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:48,510
Are you busy?

313
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:49,100
No.

314
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:50,660
Not at all.

315
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:53,730
I wrote a song today. Do you want to listen?

316
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,110
No.

317
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:56,330
Listen.

318
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:03,580
I put Dongshik's voice in.

319
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:06,870
It's been a month since he left.

320
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,590
We video call every day.

321
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,090
Dongshik looks like he got fatter.

322
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:14,660
I told you not to feed too much.

323
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:16,650
Come on.

324
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:18,340
It's just looking a little fatter on screen.

325
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:22,010
Yechan, have you eaten?

326
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:22,760
Yes.

327
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:24,720
I had two bowls.

328
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:26,660
Wait.

329
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:28,630
You don't have any appetite, do you?

330
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:31,490
It's all because you're not here.

331
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:34,390
Eat three bowls for dinner.

332
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:35,230
Okay.

333
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:38,590
What about the farm? Is it okay?

334
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:41,800
Though I'm looking at him, I'm still missing him.

335
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:45,080
Your dialect sounds weird.

336
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:47,440
I finally understand what the lyrics mean.

337
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,090
Sometimes,

338
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:01,510
when I miss you too much,

339
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:04,320
I want to rush to Seoul right away.

340
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:09,590
My God! What's wrong with you, Village Head Ma?

341
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:12,330
-You rascal. -I'm an adult after all.

342
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:14,510
I will be strong

343
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:16,620
and support bro's dream.

344
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:21,330
I miss you, Yul.

345
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:29,070
Dongshik, you miss Yul too, right?

346
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,080
My eyes are so swollen.

347
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:55,340
[Yul]

348
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:00,380
Is he busy?

349
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:03,540
What is he doing to be so busy?

350
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,120
Is that Yul?

351
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:27,970
Bro!

352
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:32,590
Bro!

353
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,420
I really missed you.

354
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:40,240
I'm home.

355
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:03,710
I missed you too.

356
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:06,820
Strongly,

357
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:09,130
all the wait is worth it.
