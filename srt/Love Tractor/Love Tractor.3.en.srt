[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:48,960
Every year, kids from Hope Orphanage

3
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:51,370
come here for a field trip.

4
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,580
Just have fun with them.

5
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:58,870
Time will fly by when we're with the kids.

6
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:01,900
There's nothing difficult about the farming tasks too.

7
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,400
Just follow me.

8
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,700
-Since you're smart, it won't take long...
-Mr. Yechan.

9
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:07,350
Yes.

10
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:09,410
Let's just go in silence.

11
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:20,310
Bro, aren't you going overboard?

12
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:22,640
Huh?

13
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:24,440
Why do you keep calling me Mr. Yechan?

14
00:01:25,039 --> 00:01:26,039
What's wrong with that—

15
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:27,630
I call you bro,

16
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:29,400
but why do you speak formally to me?

17
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:30,840
Just call me Yechan.

18
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:32,600
-Wouldn't that be nice...
-Watch out!

19
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:44,289
Are you okay?

20
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:48,160
Bro, I'm r-r-really sorry.

21
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,780
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have insisted on driving you there.

22
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:52,090
I knew that goats would run onto the road often like this.

23
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:53,870
Wait, that's not what's important right now.

24
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:55,580
-Bro, are you okay...
-Yechan!

25
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:58,700
I'm asking if you're okay.

26
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:16,920
Are you hurt?

27
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:18,980
N-N-No.

28
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,550
I was just a little shocked.

29
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:23,900
Get off.

30
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:24,860
What?

31
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:26,870
I'll drive.

32
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:29,329
-It's okay. I can...
-I got my license seven years ago.

33
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:30,590
What about you?

34
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:46,040
Aren't you getting off?

35
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,980
Yes, I'm getting off.

36
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,000
Wait, what's going on?

37
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:52,920
Hold on.

38
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:01,450
Let's go.

39
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:04,490
Okay.

40
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,160
Okay.

41
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:22,510
Why are you laughing?

42
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:25,660
Hurry up. We have a lot to do.

43
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:34,010
Bro.

44
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:35,510
Gently...

45
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:36,570
Pluck.

46
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:38,980
It's easy to pluck them if you do it like this.

47
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:40,890
When the kids arrive, teach them like this.

48
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:42,290
Okay.

49
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:44,970
Wait.

50
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,680
How did this...

51
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:50,680
Ahem. You can't do it with brute force.

52
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:53,420
Gently pull it downwards like this.

53
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:01,990
You're so smart,

54
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:04,380
but you're clumsy with your hands.

55
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:05,600
Clumsy?

56
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:08,430
It means you're bad.

57
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:09,470
Screw you.

58
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,350
Okay, look carefully.

59
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:14,380
Here.

60
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:17,320
Don't just pluck it with brute force. Pull it downwards.

61
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:20,560
Try it.

62
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,140
Okay, got it.

63
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:27,740
Grab it...

64
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,050
Wait, it's simple.

65
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:37,159
Am I crazy?

66
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:40,590
Why is my heart beating so fast since just now?

67
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:46,870
What now?

68
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:48,800
Oh um...

69
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,600
It's nothing! Nothing's going on!

70
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,050
Oh, the kids are here!

71
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:58,659
Wow, there they are!

72
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,580
Over there.

73
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:05,290
Everyone. If you see these red, ripe strawberries,

74
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:06,920
grab it gently with your wrist,

75
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:08,410
pull it downwards,

76
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:09,420
and pluck!

77
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:12,800
This way, the strawberries won't get bruised.

78
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:13,920
Got it?

79
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:15,590
-Yes. -Yes.

80
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:17,520
Then, shall we all try it?

81
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,690
-Yes. -Yes.

82
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:21,940
But this teacher is not good at picking.

83
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:22,910
Bro.

84
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:24,510
How could this be?

85
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,180
That's strange.

86
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:27,710
Why can't you do it when you're the teacher?

87
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:31,400
-His hand are poopy!
-He just said poop!

88
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:39,470
-Mr. Poop! -Mr. Poop!

89
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:40,970
Wow, it's a giant strawberry!

90
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:45,570
-Who wants to eat the giant strawberries?
-Me! Me!

91
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:48,200
I'm going to give it to whoever opens their mouth the widest.

92
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:54,210
I thought he was just a kid, but he's quite good at this.

93
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:55,900
Excuse me.

94
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,870
[The call was not connected]

95
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:07,970
[You'll be directed to voicemail after the beep]

96
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:09,550
[There will be a surcharge...]

97
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,050
Hello?

98
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,000
I was just borrowing this phone.

99
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,700
Hold on.

100
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:27,950
Sir, you got a call.

101
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,900
[Father]

102
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:41,310
Hello.

103
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,100
Are you crazy?

104
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,810
It's not enough that you handed in a blank exam paper,
but you even gave up the Harvard vacancy to someone else?

105
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:46,820
Do you think just anyone can get that spot?

106
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:49,240
If I only got the spot because of your connections, then I'm glad I didn't go.

107
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:50,159
Where are you now?

108
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,710
-Where are you hiding...
-I'll take care of my life myself.

109
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,090
Don't worry about it.

110
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:54,680
Is it

111
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,159
because of that fellow, Kwon Inseo?

112
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,850
Is that why you're not going to America in protest?

113
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,910
If you're done, I'm hanging up.

114
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,690
Why did you do that?

115
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:08,330
What?

116
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:10,300
Why are you so rude to your dad?

117
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,400
It's none of your business.

118
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,670
And do you know how rude it is

119
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,530
to pick up other people's calls?

120
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:23,520
I can't even...

121
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,790
talk to my dad when I want to.

122
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:29,010
I...

123
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:50,460
Bro.

124
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:52,940
Kids are like strawberries.

125
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,850
They need to be dealt with carefully to avoid hurting them.

126
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:58,050
Do you go along with all of their wishes just because they are kids?

127
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:00,070
I'm saying not to be too harsh on them.

128
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,850
-Just coax them nicely.
-Manners should be taught properly.

129
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:04,960
Bro, but still...

130
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:05,980
They're still young.

131
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:07,240
I'm leaving.

132
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:09,140
Bro!

133
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:20,660
How can he just leave because he's angry?

134
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,640
How can he be so heartless?

135
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:27,080
He could have just talked to the kid nicely.

136
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,260
No wonder they say people from Seoul are cold.

137
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,040
That saying must be true.

138
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:32,770
Where's Chief Baek's grandson?

139
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:33,799
Where did he go?

140
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,770
Well...

141
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:38,700
Something urgent came up.

142
00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:41,730
Sir, I want strawberry jam too.

143
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:42,770
Okay.

144
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:44,290
Thank you.

145
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:46,100
Joohee.

146
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,600
Come here.

147
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,050
Come here.

148
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:52,370
Sir, I smell something burning.

149
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:53,290
Where? Where?

150
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,350
It's fine, don't worry.

151
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,670
It's not too burnt.

152
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,670
I don't want that.

153
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,500
Don't worry. I'll make a new batch for you.

154
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,410
Where did she go?

155
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:09,840
Sir, make another batch for us quickly.

156
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,660
Okay, I'll do it right away.

157
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:39,710
[Seo Yechan]

158
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:44,550
Bro!

159
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:49,550
Bro, open the door!

160
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,840
Bro, did something happen between you and Joohee?

161
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,440
Did you come here to talk about that?

162
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:07,930
Didn't I tell you? I just taught her some basic etiquette.

163
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,500
Bro, well...

164
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,100
Stop it. I'm tired.

165
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,340
She's disappeared!

166
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,880
I have nothing more to say to you.

167
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:40,870
I can't even...

168
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,380
talk to my dad when I want to.

169
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:45,700
I...

170
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:53,770
I knew she'd cause trouble one day.

171
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,850
She thinks she's different from us.

172
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,390
You used to cry every night too.

173
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,010
No, I didn't!

174
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,450
We don't cry anymore!

175
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:02,460
It's this kid.

176
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,370
I've already informed the police station. We'll go look for her now too.

177
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:09,600
I sent a photo of Joohee to everyone.

178
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:10,410
You got it, right?

179
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:13,020
Call me when you see Joohee.

180
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:14,320
Yechan.

181
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,950
Didn't Chief Baek's grandson come along?

182
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,960
He said he has no clue.

183
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:22,120
-I'll drive around the area to look for her.
-Okay.

184
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:29,440
Due to the spread of gray clouds, there'll be brief showers throughout Gyeongsang Province.

185
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:31,880
In many areas, there'll be rain or...

00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:33,480
Oh no. What should I do?

187
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:35,970
Joohee!

188
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,130
Kid!

189
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:38,390
Joohee!

190
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:39,810
Joohee!

191
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:40,720
Kid!

192
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:42,920
Joohee!

193
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:46,120
Joohee! The sun is setting. Joohee!

194
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:47,080
Joohee!

195
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:48,500
Kid!

196
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:22,290
Hey, kid!

197
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:28,980
You...

198
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:34,340
How can you be here?

199
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,130
Get in.

200
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,540
Hey, where are you going?

201
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:47,240
[Inseo]

202
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:52,770
Where did the kid go?

203
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:54,510
Hey, kid!

204
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:57,370
Kid!

205
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,700
Gosh, where did she go?

206
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:11,080
Hey, kid!

207
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:14,730
Your dad called!

208
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:18,240
Really? Really?

209
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:32,050
It was a lie.

210
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:38,170
Wait.

211
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:44,140
Wait!

212
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:46,980
Hey, kid!

213
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:49,920
Wait! Stop! Wait!

214
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,210
Be careful!

215
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:25,430
You're awake?

216
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:41,110
Don't tell me...

217
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:42,700
I...

218
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,000
From above...

219
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:47,290
Yes, we fell from there.

220
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:50,210
How could you have just kept on running without looking?

221
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:55,650
Blood...

222
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,000
Oh no.

223
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,000
It's okay.

224
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:02,620
Does it hurt a lot?

225
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:06,940
That's not the problem right now.

226
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,370
I think I sprained my ankle,

227
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,760
so I can't climb up.

228
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:16,630
What?

229
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:18,670
I also left my phone in the car.

230
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:21,670
Then...

231
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:25,800
We're trapped here.

232
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:38,040
Wait, is this Yul's car?

233
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:06,130
Help!

234
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:08,600
Help!

235
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:12,390
Stop screaming. It's just a waste of your energy.

236
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,910
We could die if we just wait here and do nothing!

237
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:16,850
We won't die.

238
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:17,780
Tsk.

239
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:19,820
How do you know?

240
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:25,750
After we realized you disappeared, everyone is looking for you.

241
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:28,060
So, someone will come soon.

242
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:39,810
And do you know how rude it is

243
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:41,700
to pick up other people's calls?

244
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:43,730
Bro.

245
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:46,820
Kids are like strawberries.

246
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:49,200
They need to be dealt with carefully to avoid hurting them.

247
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:12,859
It's okay.

248
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,210
Sir, your hands are big.

249
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,990
My dad's hands are big too.

250
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:40,390
I miss my dad.

251
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:52,810
If I can live with my dad again,

252
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,170
I can attend piano lessons.

253
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:59,500
My dad loved it when I played the piano.

254
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:05,460
But...

255
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:18,050
Your situation is the opposite of mine.

256
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,900
My father

257
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,700
really hated when I played the piano.

258
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:31,020
Did you play the piano too?

259
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:32,760
Yes.

260
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:37,660
But why does your dad hate the piano?

261
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:42,390
Who knows?

262
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:48,000
My father...

263
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,590
hated everything I liked.

264
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:57,060
I'm sorry,

265
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:00,920
for picking up your dad's call just now.

266
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:07,360
I'll have to pick up the call someday anyway.

267
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,100
I can't run away from it forever.

268
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:12,520
Even so...

269
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:23,230
By the way,

270
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:26,480
don't you feel a little cold?

271
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:29,910
I think it's hot.

272
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:32,270
Really?

273
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:34,170
Oh no.

274
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,440
You're bleeding.

275
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:42,620
Oh no!

276
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:45,930
What do we do?

277
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:48,890
No!

278
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:52,120
No! Don't die!

279
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:54,720
No!

280
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:03,030
No!

281
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:08,760
Bro!

282
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,950
Bro, hang in there!

283
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:14,500
What's going on?

284
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:15,870
Bro!

285
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,620
Why do I see his face?

286
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:23,340
Is this a dream?

287
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:54,680
[Love Tractor]

288
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,980
Why didn't you tell me you were going to look for the kid?

289
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:58,390
How can you just faint there like this?

290
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:59,650
Thank you, Yechan.

291
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:02,640
Pfft. Do you think it's settled just because you're smiling?

292
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:04,750
I'm not leaving.

293
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:06,540
Of course I have to take care of you.

294
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:10,220
I can't leave someone who hurt his hand alone.

295
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:11,860
Can't I?

296
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:12,870
Then, first of all,

297
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:14,620
take it off.
