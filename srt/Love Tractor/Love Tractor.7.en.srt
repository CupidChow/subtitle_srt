00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,040
Bro!

188
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:01,510
Bro.

189
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:04,570
Are you not in?

190
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:06,870
Bro?

191
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:09,640
Bro.

192
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:24,380
[The phone is turned off]

193
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:26,510
[You'll be directed to voicemail]

194
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:29,780
Bro!

195
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,520
Yul!

196
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:36,180
Bro!

197
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,780
What's going on? He even turned his phone off.

198
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
If you go all out all the time, he'll lose interest

199
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:46,740
and run away eventually.

200
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:52,200
Don't tell me he ran away?

201
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:15,260
Didn't I throw this away?

202
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:18,570
Don't tell me

203
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,820
he picked it up again?

204
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:22,950
Did he abandon me

205
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:25,480
even though he got the melodeon back?

206
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:38,030
You have holes too.

207
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,390
I have many holes in my heart now too.

208
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,310
What are you doing?

209
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:13,960
Huh?

210
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:16,830
Why are you saying such strange things while crying?

211
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:19,990
You're back?

212
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,620
Hey, I can't breathe.

213
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,900
I can't breathe either.

214
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,130
I thought I was going to suffocate and die.

215
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:35,790
What's wrong with you?

216
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:38,440
I thought

217
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:40,320
you ran away.

218
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,210
Where did you go?

219
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:43,230
Me?

220
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:45,250
I just left to meet a friend.

221
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:48,890
How can you do this? You should inform me if you're going somewhere.

222
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:50,080
Because I didn't know you were going out,

223
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,610
you have no idea how worried I was.

224
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:53,090
I'd only been out for a few hours.

225
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:53,960
Is it worth getting this worried over that?

226
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:54,960
Yes!

227
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:58,290
So, in the future,

228
00:13:58,330 --> 00:13:59,770
you must tell me when you go out.

229
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:01,810
You really...

230
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:07,540
Bro.

231
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,270
Are you hungry?

232
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,740
No.

233
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:19,600
Goodness.

234
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:32,880
It tastes better outdoors.

235
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:35,430
Didn't you say you weren't hungry?

236
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:39,030
Come on.

237
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:39,950
Bro.

238
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,710
There's always room for instant noodles even if I'm not hungry.

239
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,000
By the way,

240
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:47,210
why did you

241
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:49,310
turn off your phone just now?

242
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:51,010
That made me more worried.

243
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:52,810
My phone ran out of battery.
I'm charging it right now.

244
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:55,080
You're from Seoul.

245
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,850
Don't you have a battery pack?

246
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,660
My friend visited suddenly, so I didn't think that far.

247
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:00,790
I didn't know he'd come all the way here.

248
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,270
Why...

249
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,080
did your friend come to you?

250
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:07,530
He asked me to work with him.

251
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:11,020
Work?

252
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:12,680
What work?

253
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:18,050
Music.

254
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:21,130
I was originally pursuing music.

255
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:26,770
That's why you played the piano.

256
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:29,530
But my dad was vehemently against it.

257
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:32,100
That's why I went to law school.

258
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:41,770
What do you think?

259
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:44,600
I mean your music.

260
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:46,580
Didn't you want to start over?

261
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,220
Because it's not that simple...

262
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,200
If it's something you like,

263
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:54,570
you should do it.

264
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:00,950
Someone once said

265
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,560
that doing what you like

266
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:07,030
is what's really cool.

267
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:14,480
Bro.

268
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,280
You like music, right?

269
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,310
That's why...

270
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:21,700
you picked this up, didn't you?

271
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:27,860
Then...

272
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,140
Start over.

273
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:36,530
But I haven't played the piano for a long time, so I'm rusty.

274
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:38,600
I don't have my equipment here too.

275
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:40,670
Like a piano?

276
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:42,400
Well...

277
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:45,200
It doesn't have to be a piano...

278
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,610
There's a piano here.

279
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:47,920
What?

280
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,770
Are you talking about this broken melodeon?

281
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,240
Goodness.

282
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:58,780
Of course not.

283
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,020
There's really a piano here. Let's go.

284
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:02,300
What?

285
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:03,810
Hurry up.

286
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:05,349
Where are we going all of a sudden?

287
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:06,270
Goodness.

288
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:07,750
Hey! Hey!

289
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,770
You'll find out.

290
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:09,440
Where?

291
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,290
Hurry up.

292
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,369
[Father]

293
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:24,339
There's a piano in such a place?

294
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:26,420
Come on, bro.

295
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,770
Were you fooled all the time while growing up?

296
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,850
There really is a piano here.

297
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,550
But why is there a piano here...

298
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:36,350
Come on, hurry up.

299
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:51,730
Huh?

300
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:01,850
See? I told you there's a piano.

301
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:12,770
Bro, what's wrong?

302
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:48,260
This is my piano.

303
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,880
I played it when I was a kid.

304
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,070
I thought it was thrown away,

305
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:00,530
but here it is.

306
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:05,090
Oh, that's why the chief tuned it himself.

307
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:09,320
He never played the piano, but he's been taking care of it.

308
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:11,830
After spending some time over there,

309
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:13,660
you'll end up liking it too.

310
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:34,060
Bro.

311
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,790
Sit down.

312
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:38,280
Okay.

313
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:51,020
Bro.

314
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:52,850
Play a song for me.

315
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,460
Well...

316
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:02,330
Do you have a favorite song?

317
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:06,060
"Chilgap Mountain".

318
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:13,150
I don't know that song.

319
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:15,490
How about a children's song?

320
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:18,840
"Butterfly"?

321
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:24,140
I'll play that one.

322
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:40,480
This is Do, right?

323
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:45,500
No, it's next to that.

324
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:48,160
Here?

325
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:49,810
No.

326
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:54,910
Here.

327
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:56,070
Oh.

328
00:20:56,530 --> 00:20:59,610
Do, Re, Mi, Fa, So.

329
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:02,030
Is this right?

330
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:08,520
Try following me.

331
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:21,860
Can you do this?

332
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:24,830
Let me try.

333
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,770
Three, four.

334
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:41,810
Wow.

335
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:43,340
It's amazing.

336
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,440
Bro, now play it by yourself.

337
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,040
Slowly.

338
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:10,190
What do you think?

339
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:23,620
I really couldn't help it.

340
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:26,520
It's all your fault.

341
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,860
Who told... who told you to be so cool?

342
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,950
Who would play "Butterfly" in such a cool manner?

343
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:41,120
Music

344
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:43,420
is like farming.

345
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:51,160
If you approach your craft with love,

346
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:53,050
the results reflect it honestly.

347
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:56,430
Of course,

348
00:23:57,290 --> 00:23:58,660
I don't know the technical terms,

349
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:00,500
but I can feel it with my heart.

350
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:04,780
Bro,

351
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:07,460
you've always been very cool thus far.

352
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:08,640
But,

353
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:10,950
just now, you were really...

354
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:14,150
the coolest I've seen of you.

355
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:18,600
Bro.

356
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,820
You must keep pursuing music.

357
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:23,870
Okay?

358
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:27,180
You must.

359
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:41,470
Why are you following me instead of going home?

360
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,930
Bro, I'm sending you home first.

361
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,020
But...

362
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:52,180
why are you keeping such a distance from me?

363
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:56,360
What?

364
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,540
I can't hear you.

365
00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:02,060
What if I get the impulse to kiss you again?

366
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,190
Go home.

367
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:09,740
Who asked you to be so cool?

368
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,870
You should go now.

369
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:16,000
I'm going to go home after I see you get home.

370
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:30,010
Father.

371
00:25:56,530 --> 00:25:59,510
[Love Tractor]

372
00:25:59,650 --> 00:26:00,870
Did you think I wouldn't be able to find you?

373
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,160
Go pack your things now.

374
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,490
Dongshik.

375
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:04,940
Will Yechan be okay

376
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:07,350
if I return to Seoul?

377
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:10,850
Hurry up.

378
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:14,750
Wow.

379
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:19,530
Bro.

380
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,690
Can you...

381
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,020
grant me just one wish?
