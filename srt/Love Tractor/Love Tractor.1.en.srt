00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:51,050
Because of the burglar who trespassed at night,

3
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:52,510
the plaintiff got shocked and fell down backwards.

4
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,710
But the burglar threatened the injured plaintiff,

5
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,410
stole the valuables, and ran away.

Firstly, trespassing,

special first-degree burglary...

8
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:04,099

But why?

14
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:16,940
Why is it injury caused by burglary?

15
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:18,500
The burglar didn't cause the injury.

16
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:21,330
Didn't the plaintiff get shocked and fall down on his own accord?

17
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:24,260
Since it was at night, the burglar was aware that the house was occupied.

18
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:26,270
So even if it wasn't intentional,

19
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,050
because the injury was caused by the trespassing,

20
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:30,560
it's related to the defendant's crime.

21
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:32,930
That's why the clause of injury caused by burglary is also applicable.

186
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:31,760
you'll be sentenced to up to three years in prison, or fined up to 7 million won.

187
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:32,930
What fine?

188
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:34,260
If it involves animal abuse,

189
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,300
you'll be sentenced to three years in prison, or fined up to 30 million won...

190
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:38,820
Animal abuse?

191
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,660
You're caught red-handed, yet you're still trying to deny it?

192
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:42,870
You even stole someone else's dog...

193
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,150
What? I didn't steal it.

194
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,170
That's not your dog.

195
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:46,510
It doesn't seem to be yours too?

196
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:47,360
Move.

197
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:48,400
Move...

198
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,330
I said move!

199
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:50,420
I don't want to.

200
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:51,410
You dog thief!

201
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:52,450
Who do you think you are?

202
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,510
[Love Tractor]

203
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:59,570
But, who are you?

204
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:02,790
Oh! Then are you Chief Baek's grandson?

205
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:03,240
What?

206
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:06,230
The chief was always boasting about his grandson who's attending law school.

207
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:09,340
No wonder the legal terms just rolled off your tongue just now.

208
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:10,580
You were so cool!

209
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:12,400
How dazzling!

210
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,780
You're very handsome.

211
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:15,640
Can I call you bro?

212
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:16,840
Bro?

213
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,280
I can call you bro, right?

214
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,560
Come on, be my bro.

215
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:21,280
This is how people live here.

216
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:23,020
We share good food,

217
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:24,130
and help each other when we have difficulties.

218
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:25,460
So, bro,

219
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,910
don't feel burdened and just have it.

220
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:27,930
People in this neighborhood

221
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:29,310
are so friendly and nice, right?

222
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:30,580
They're too friendly.

223
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:32,040
What's up, man?

224
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:34,600
It's been a while since I've made a friend.

225
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,210
Goodness.

226
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,040
Mr. Yechan.

227
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,170
Yes?

228
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:43,660
Let's just go quietly.

229
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:45,550
Bro, don't you think you've gone too far?
