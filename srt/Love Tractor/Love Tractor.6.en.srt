00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:05,239
Ouch!

3
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:07,090
You've been sitting in a daze since just now.

4
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:08,250
What are you doing?

5
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:09,090
What about me?

6
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:12,150
Oh, right. I heard you left halfway when working in the field with Village Head Ma yesterday.

7
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:13,050
What are you doing? Get a grip!

8
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:15,850
Hey! It hurts.

9
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,760
What hurt? It doesn't hurt.

10
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:20,010
It hurts. It really hurts.

11
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,810
I really don't want to be like this anymore.

12
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:26,320
I don't want to do this either.

13
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,450
It hurts because I can't control my heart so I'm hurting a lot.

14
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,090
It really hurts.

15
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:36,690
Is our son really hurt?

16
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:37,990
Huh?

17
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:43,580
I'll do something to make you feel better.

18
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:47,340
It won't hurt if I hit you a little more.

19
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:49,050
Stop talking nonsense.

20
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:51,070
Take this to Yul and come back.

21
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,580
Oh, right. Take the clothes Yul left here and return it too.

22
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,150
To him? Me?

23
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:57,440
You're always at his house.

24
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:02,660
Why?

25
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:05,190
Did you two fight? Is it because you had a fight?

26
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,150
It's not like that.

27
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,450
Whatever. I will bring it over.

28
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,060
Fine, I'll go.

29
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:14,940
I'll go.

30
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,050
What's wrong with him?

31
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:26,150
This is not the time to be delivering him corn.

32
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:29,280
No.

33
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:32,230
It's not a big deal to give a neighbor some corn.

34
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:39,890
What's going on?

35
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,660
Come back to Seoul with me.

36
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:48,880
Let's go back

37
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,540
and start afresh, the two of us.

38
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:52,660
Yul.

39
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,460
I can't leave you here alone.

40
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:57,470
So let's go back together.

41
00:02:58,850 --> 00:02:59,090
Okay?

42
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:01,490
Yul!

43
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:02,580
No!

44
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:16,829
Don't go.

45
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:25,660
Yechan.

46
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,850
What do you mean?

47
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:37,700
Corn.

48
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,880
Have some corn before leaving...

49
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:44,370
It was steamed just now. It's really delicious.

50
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,950
So don't go anywhere else. Let's share and eat it.

51
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:50,680
This is not the time for you to interfere.

52
00:03:51,329 --> 00:03:53,140
It's not even a situation where you should joke around.

53
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:56,510
I'm sorry.

54
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:59,120
-If you're sorry, then stop being a bother here.
-Hey!

55
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:00,510
Stop it.

56
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:02,190
Am I the one who should be stopping here?

57
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,180
He's the one who should be leaving, no?

58
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:08,180
Go inside first.

59
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,720
What do you mean go inside? Shouldn't you be telling him to leave?

60
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,120
It's okay. You go in first.

61
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:17,610
Hey, Seonyul.

62
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:20,100
What are you doing?

63
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,690
I'm asking what are you doing?

64
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:27,620
Hey, can't you hear me?

65
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,620
Say something too.

66
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:40,280
Yul.

67
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,310
Go back to Seoul now.

68
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:57,840
What about you?

69
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,240
I want to stay here.

70
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:03,430
You...

71
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,930
If you don't come with me now, it's over between us.

72
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,300
Seonyul!

73
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:15,160
Let's break up.

74
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:17,810
We...

75
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,680
ended a long time ago.

76
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:21,910
We just don't want to admit it.

77
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:29,300
Is it because of him?

78
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:34,100
It's not like that. It's a problem between the two of us.

79
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:35,100
Then why are you suddenly like this?

80
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,470
Is it because of that incident?

81
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:39,930
Inseo...

82
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,240
It was hard for me too.

83
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:47,280
You even gave up music because of me.

84
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:50,220
That's why I started having less things to talk to you about.

85
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:51,870
So...

86
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,600
The thing about me giving up music,

87
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:56,690
-about this... -You...

88
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:00,300
are having a hard time not being able to fall asleep. I know that too.

89
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,270
Should I ask you to start doing music again?

90
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,960
Or should I break up with you? I have thought about this thousands of times.

91
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:09,740
But...

92
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:13,590
I don’t want you to give up on me for music.

93
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:20,030
Yul...

94
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:24,610
I know I'm selfish...

95
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:27,390
But how can we break up?

96
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:32,010
I'm sorry.

97
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:36,670
You must've had a hard time too.

98
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:39,800
But...

99
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,720
you don't have to feel burdened.

100
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:44,960
It was my choice.

101
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:46,700
-But you regret it– -No.

102
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:49,170
Even if I go back to that time,

103
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:50,920
I would still make the same choice.

104
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:56,909
I have never regretted the time I was dating you.

105
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:01,120
But Inseo...

106
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:04,770
This isn't dating between us.

107
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:06,560
It's not love either.

108
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:09,840
You know that too, don't you?

109
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,090
Let's stop it.

110
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,170
It's right to end it here.

111
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:34,690
Is he really going back to Seoul?

112
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,409
Bro...

113
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:51,760
Where's your friend?

114
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:53,020
He left.

115
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:56,870
He won't come again.

116
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,140
Dongshik, what are you doing here? Dongshik.

117
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:42,850
Did you run away from home
because you missed me so much?

118
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:45,990
I haven't seen you for days. Did you come all the way here?

119
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:48,240
Dongshik.

120
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:50,030
Hey, are you okay?

121
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:51,330
Dongshik.

122
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:02,160
Dongshik, is bro okay?

123
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:04,550
Is he doing well?

124
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:09,370
I'm really worried,

125
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,150
but I don't know if I can go to him.

126
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,510
Should I go take a look?

127
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:31,870
Bro.

128
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:33,370
Did you take it out?

129
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:37,440
No, I didn't take it out.

130
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:39,670
I was going to work in the fields.

131
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,790
Dongshik suddenly came

132
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:45,020
so I came to take it home.

133
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:48,460
It's been a while.

134
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:51,740
Why?

135
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:55,020
Is something on my face?

136
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:57,550
Bro,

137
00:09:58,350 --> 00:09:59,100
are you sick?

138
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:02,940
No, I just didn't sleep well.

139
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:07,460
I'm fine, really.

140
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,040
Come with me.

141
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:13,530
What?

142
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,090
Where are you going?

143
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:35,550
50,000 KRW a day.

144
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:37,070
What?

145
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:39,180
When you can't sleep or eat well,

146
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:40,550
physical work is the best.

147
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:45,790
Come over quickly.

148
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,500
Come quickly!

149
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:12,460
A daily salary of 50,000 KRW is not enough no matter how you think about it.

150
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:14,150
It's lower than basic salary.

151
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:16,940
Gosh, I got caught.

152
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,640
I picked this from the nearby farm.

153
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:38,060
Try one.

154
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:40,670
Hey, you need to wash it first.

155
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,850
They don't sprinkle pesticide. You can eat it directly.

156
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:49,330
Gosh. Have one.

157
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,080
It's sweet.

158
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,640
I stole it so it tastes so good.

159
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:10,920
You stole it?

160
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,510
You can't do that.

161
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:14,570
But it's delicious.

162
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:34,960
Hello?

163
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,240
Hey, Chief Baek's grandson.

164
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:37,660
Are you still sleeping?

165
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,430
Yes.

166
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:40,920
Is there anything I can help you with?

167
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:41,940
Chief Baek's grandson.

168
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:44,360
Do you want to make a pot of wine together?

169
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:47,210
I make it with the Chief every year.

170
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:48,830
Okay.

171
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:49,880
I'll be there.

172
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:52,540
Okay. Got it.

173
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:53,680
Okay.

174
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:05,180
Bro!

175
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,090
Are we making it in this house?

176
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:18,720
Yes. We make it in the Chief's house every year.

177
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:20,970
Thank you for agreeing, Chief Baek's grandson.

178
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,540
I was worried you'd turn me down.

179
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:26,250
Shall we get started?

180
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:27,160
Okay.

181
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:29,000
Let me try.

182
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:32,870
Here.

183
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:34,470
Good.

184
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:37,830
You can drink with the villagers after it's fermented.

185
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:39,570
It's finally over.

186
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:40,930
No!

187
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,920
It's not over yet. This is the start. Start.

188
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:44,480
What?

189
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:46,770
Oh.

190
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,280
Then now I can also...

191
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:52,610
Come over too, Chan. You're an adult now.

192
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,810
What? What are you talking about?

193
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:58,170
We have to drink the wine we made last year.

194
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:00,130
What? Now?

195
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:04,560
Yes. I can only make wine until last year. I couldn't drink it.

196
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:07,200
You're 20 years old so you can drink all you want now.

197
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,660
Let's just have some chives pancakes.

198
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:11,270
Take out the radish kimchi and let's eat.

199
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:12,200
Take it out and eat.

200
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:15,710
Chives? Raddish?

201
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,890
So you were talking about chives pancakes and radish kimchi.

202
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:39,030
Chief Baek's grandson. Here.

203
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:40,560
Chan.

204
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,660
Thank you.

205
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:48,930
Thank you.

206
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:58,860
The raspberry is amazing.

207
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:01,220
My wife likes it too.

208
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:03,840
If she likes it too, you should invite her over too.

209
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:05,630
Chan.

210
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:07,850
Even if I drink alone, my wife will be happy.

211
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:10,940
But for the two of you,

212
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:14,670
the night must be long.

213
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:17,640
Here. Cheers.

214
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:19,790
To tonight.

215
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:21,390
To tonight!

216
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:30,640
It's really good.

217
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:34,310
The raspberries here are the best. Chief Baek's grandson, do you like it?

218
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:35,390
Yes, it's good.

219
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,790
Why... are you looking at me like that?

220
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:45,150
Parting is bitter.

221
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:46,290
But

222
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,760
you will soon meet a sweet love

223
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:50,880
like raspberries.

224
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:54,390
Hey! It's a secret.

225
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:57,990
What are you talking about? There are no secrets in the countryside.

226
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,580
Even so...

227
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:01,240
It's okay.

228
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:02,910
I did break up.

229
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:09,900
I didn't mean to tell people about it...

230
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:11,760
It's okay.

231
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:14,200
So, Chief Baek's grandson,

232
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,280
let's have a drink and forget it all!

233
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:23,030
Come on, Chan. Have another drink.

234
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:27,270
Here.

235
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:31,340
Let's cheers.

236
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:31,820
Cheers!

237
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,900
-Cheers. -All right.

238
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,990
Drink slowly.

239
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:48,050
I only had two glasses.

240
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,480
It's easy to get drunk on self-made wine like this.

241
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,810
I can drink more.

242
00:20:57,630 --> 00:20:59,420
Good. Drink up.

243
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:02,120
You don't get drunk after labor work.

244
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:03,640
You don't get drunk after labor work.

245
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:05,110
You don't get drunk after labor work.

246
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:16,760
No matter how much you drink, you won't get drunk.

247
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:26,840
Yechan.

248
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:32,230
Bro...

249
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:37,130
Are you done cleaning up?

250
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,200
Is it because I drank?

251
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:42,890
It's hot.

252
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:50,140
Bro... Why are you suddenly...

253
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:51,580
Aren't you hot?

254
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:55,920
It's a little hot.

255
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,640
Why are you looking at me like that?

256
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:56,850
What? What is that?

257
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:57,690
Was it a dream?

258
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:02,000
I must be crazy.

259
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:05,080
Why did I have such a embarrassing dream? Gosh.

260
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:08,760
Goodness. Seriously...

261
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,610
How am I going to face bro now?

262
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:11,620
You still know your place.

263
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:18,040
If you drink like this again, I'll scold you.

264
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:20,240
Oh... Yes...

265
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:38,070
You're blushing really hard.

266
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,070
Seems like we need to turn on the air conditioner.

267
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:41,990
Bro!

268
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:43,420
What?

269
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,540
I...

270
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:49,470
I have to go. I can't.

271
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,340
This place is too...

272
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:52,550
What?

273
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:03,640
It's too dangerous.

274
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:05,730
Because it's too hot?

275
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:08,770
Yes. So I will...

276
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,070
get going...

277
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,630
Just turn on the air conditioner.

278
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:22,680
I'm sorry. I-I'm sorry!

279
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:29,020
What is he so sorry for?

280
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,670
I must be crazy, crazy!

281
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:38,880
How could I have such...

282
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:46,520
Will your face look better if you wash your face like this?

283
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,780
Hey, save some water.

284
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:50,580
Come on!

285
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:52,640
You're not paying for the water so you can waste water like this?

286
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,400
No matter how much you wash your face, you still look like your dad.

287
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,160
I'm much better than Dad.

288
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,540
You two look the same.

289
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,140
Dad is your husband.

290
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:02,270
You're right.

291
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:03,940
It must be my fault.

292
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,570
I suddenly feel like crying.

293
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:06,530
Mom?

294
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:11,580
So you have to choose someone who's pretty, okay?

295
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:12,950
I'm good at choosing people...

296
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:14,690
I'm really good at it...

297
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:16,630
What did you say?

298
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:19,920
Gosh.

299
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:31,610
What is he doing?

300
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,810
Gosh. What do I do now?

301
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:44,650
I really can't look at your face.

302
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:47,200
Dongshik, slowly.

303
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:52,400
Yechan!

304
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:13,440
Is he busy?

305
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:33,050
I'm sorry bro...

306
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:37,160
When I see you...

307
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:40,600
I don't even have the courage to hear your voice.

308
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,130
Seo Yechan!

309
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:11,970
Bro...

310
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,110
Don't you want your bag?

311
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:19,930
You're not answering my calls.

312
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,540
-Well...
-You run away as soon as you see me.

313
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:27,350
I didn't...

314
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:31,690
Seo Yechan.

315
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:33,220
Yes?

316
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:35,950
Look at me properly.

317
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:41,940
I told you to look properly!

318
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:48,370
What's the problem?

319
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:49,210
Hmm?

320
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:52,100
Did I upset you?

321
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:55,400
-No! Why would I be–
-Then why are you avoiding me?

322
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:01,230
Why are you avoiding me?

323
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:04,380
Yechan.

324
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,390
Seo Yechan!

325
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:10,330
Because I get nervous.

326
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:12,840
What?

327
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:16,760
I get nervous whenever I see you.

328
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:25,860
I like you.

329
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,840
[Love Tractor]

330
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:15,700
Try to make Chief Baek's grandson fall for you.

331
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:17,900
But there's something really important.

332
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:19,220
It is playing hard to get.

333
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:21,330
I don't want to play hard to get.

334
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:24,530
I'm going to be completely straightforward.

335
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:26,060
Bro! Where are you?

336
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,800
If you push too hard, it'll break.

337
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:29,550
Then he'll run away.

338
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:33,740
Did he abandon me

339
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,140
and start playing his harmonica again?
