[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:55,760
Bro!

3
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,660
Can you hear me?

4
00:00:57,910 --> 00:00:59,360
Do you recognize me, bro?

5
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:02,410
It hurts.

6
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:03,700
Does it hurt a lot?

7
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:08,030
I said my ears hurt. Be softer.
I can hear you.

8
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:11,310
What? You startled me.

9
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:13,760
Are you okay?

10
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:20,250
Where's that kid?

11
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:22,800
Joohee isn't hurt.

12
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,730
She went back to the orphanage cause she's all right.

13
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:27,230
That's a relief.

14
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:28,750
A relief?

15
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:32,220
What? Your arms and feet  are all in cast, how is this a relief?

16
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,500
Why are you scaring me like this?

17
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:37,410
You left your phone in the car.

18
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,009
And you fainted there like that too.

19
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:41,020
You were so indifferent before.

20
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:43,280
If you're going to look for the kid, at least tell me that.

21
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,100
I didn't even know that.

22
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:47,280
I'm disappointed in you.

23
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:53,759
Stop just smiling. Say something.

24
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:57,520
I'm sorry.

25
00:01:59,789 --> 00:01:59,800
I really...

26
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,300
Do you know how worried I was?

27
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,860
Thank you, Yechan.

28
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:06,580
For finding me.

29
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:11,870
You think just a smile will fix it?

30
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:24,660
Thank you.

31
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:25,960
It's nothing.

32
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:27,730
You should go eat. Go ahead.

33
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,170
I'm not leaving.

34
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:30,930
Huh?

35
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:33,329
They said family can take care of the patients here.

36
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:36,079
Of course I have to take care of you.

37
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,350
You don't have to do that though?

38
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,120
You're busy with the farm, no?

39
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:42,400
Don't worry.

40
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:44,370
Village Head Ma said he'll take care of me for a few days.

41
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:46,740
No, you don't have to do this.

42
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:50,240
Let's eat.

43
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,520
I'll–

44
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:56,010
You hurt your hand.

45
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:02,220
You're eating well.

46
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,440
Have some soup too.

47
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:06,550
Have some soup.

48
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:08,160
Oh, no.

49
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:10,360
It's okay.

50
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,750
I'll clean it for you.

51
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:14,260
I'll do it myself.

52
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:17,070
You're a patient. Let me help you. Just stay still.

53
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:19,670
Just stay still?

54
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:26,870
Wash your face.

55
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,420
Forget it.

56
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,070
You have to. Come on.

57
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,480
With the towel on.

58
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,780
It's pretty.

59
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:39,420
Wipe your eyes too.

60
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:43,200
Wipe this side too. That side too. Blow your nose too.

61
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:48,700
You're so handsome.

62
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:51,850
Look at him. He's handsome, isn't he?

63
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:57,630
What is this?

64
00:03:58,910 --> 00:03:59,380
Toothpaste.

65
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:01,510
T-toothpaste?

66
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:03,540
Wow.

67
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:07,690
Do you want me to brush your teeth?

68
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:08,730
You're so noisy.

69
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,010
Stay still.

70
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,370
Down there.

71
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:19,390
Hey, that's not it.

72
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,410
It's a bit difficult.

73
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:44,400
You can't sleep?

74
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:46,280
Should I turn off the lights for you?

75
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,500
No, it's okay.

76
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:56,510
Is there anything that can help you sleep?

77
00:04:56,909 --> 00:04:57,880
It's okay.

78
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:01,430
You're busy with your farm. Is it really okay for you to be here?

79
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,010
Go home and sleep.

80
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,020
It's uncomfortable here.

81
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:36,300
I guess it's not.

82
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,170
You can be discharged now.

83
00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:00,260
Your leg muscles were just stimulated temporarily.
It's stable now.

84
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,460
We'll have to keep an eye on his arm for another week.

85
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:03,550
Okay.

86
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:05,860
Doctor, well...

87
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:09,290
With his arm injury, it doesn't affect his fingers, does it?

88
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:13,340
He plays the piano. His fingers are important.

89
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,940
He didn't hurt his nerves. There should be no problem.

90
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:17,160
Thank you, doctor.

91
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:18,410
Don't worry. I'll get going.

92
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,730
That's great, isn't it?

93
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:27,060
How did you know I could play the piano?

94
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:29,640
When Joohee was leaving,

95
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,260
she told me you play the piano

96
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,720
and that you really liked playing it.

97
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:37,600
What's wrong?

98
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:43,750
I'm tired.

99
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:44,890
Can you leave?

100
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:45,830
What?

101
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:48,530
I want to rest alone.

102
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:53,680
Okay, I'll come back tomorrow.

103
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:54,040
No.

104
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:56,930
I can take care of myself.

105
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:58,010
You don't have to come again.

106
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:03,110
Okay.

107
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,330
What's wrong with him all of a sudden?

108
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:32,570
Hello.

109
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:43,059
Luckily, you recovered quickly. You can be discharged soon.

110
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:44,480
You have a lot of belongings.

111
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,570
You don't have a family to accompany you to discharge.

112
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:48,470
Yes.

113
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:49,980
I think it'll be hard.

114
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:51,570
Get home safely.

115
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:01,790
Brother.

116
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:04,930
You look fine.

117
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:06,180
It's better now.

118
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,040
Hello.

119
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:48,040
What is it?

120
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:50,660
I came because I heard you were discharged.

121
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,840
Oh, yes.

122
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:53,910
Come in.

123
00:09:56,890 --> 00:10:01,580
Gosh, this place is totally different. It's so clean.

124
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:04,410
This is beef bone soup.

125
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:08,230
This is the best for bones. Eat well.

126
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,910
Why did you bring beef bone soup...

127
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:13,090
I didn't even visit you when you were hospitalized.

128
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:15,190
We're neighbors. It's nothing.

129
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:17,230
Just say thank you and take it.

130
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:17,910
Okay?

131
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:19,490
Thank you.

132
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:24,300
You have to eat it up, all right?

133
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:24,800
Yes.

134
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:32,980
Oh...

135
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:34,890
H-hello.

136
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:36,190
I heard you got hurt.

137
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:37,310
Are you okay?

138
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:39,990
I'm fine.

139
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,220
Eat up.

140
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:44,910
Thank you.

141
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:49,530
Hey, how's your injury?

142
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:50,460
I'm fine.

143
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:53,140
Take this. You need to eat well to get better.

144
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:02,670
People in the countryside...

145
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:04,710
Are so warm.

146
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:38,400
It's good.

147
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,990
No, I'll take care of myself. You don't have to come.

148
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,050
Hey, you!

149
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:53,110
This is driving me crazy.

150
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:54,110
Dongshik, you...

151
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:55,870
Come on, try running out again.

152
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,320
This is driving me crazy.

153
00:11:58,780 --> 00:11:59,290
Hey, what are you doing?

154
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:02,230
Bro.

155
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,700
Why are you fighting with Dongshik?

156
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:06,950
What's with you too.

157
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:08,890
Well...

158
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:11,060
I personally made a cake

159
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,890
to celebrate your discharge.

160
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,510
But he suddenly rushed over.

161
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:19,110
I was shocked and overturned it.

162
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:23,880
The dough kept getting burnt so I made it for the whole day.

163
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,750
I really wanted to give it to you.

164
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,800
It was delicious too.

165
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:42,150
It's delicious.

166
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:49,170
What's with that bag?

167
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:52,920
Well...

168
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:56,350
You can't leave someone who injured their arm alone.

169
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,800
So I thought I'd stay here to accompany you

170
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:02,060
until your cast is removed.

171
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:03,550
What?

172
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:07,470
Can't I?

173
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,380
Can't I, bro?

174
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,080
Okay, firstly...

175
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:19,830
Take it off.

176
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:23,290
What?

177
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,020
You're telling me to take it off?

178
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:27,150
Yes.

179
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:35,410
You want to go in with cream all over you?

180
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:36,510
Take it off and wash it.

181
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,240
You're making me so embarrassed.

182
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:41,120
What?

183
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:43,420
It's embarrassing.

184
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,140
Go home and wash then. I'm going in.

185
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:51,180
I-I'll do it now quickly.

186
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:52,360
I'll do it now.

187
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:05,640
Down there.

188
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:06,620
Huh?

189
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:07,530
Down there.

190
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:08,100
Where?

191
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:09,570
Give it to me.

192
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:15,660
Gosh. Seriously?

193
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,350
Got it.

194
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,240
What are you doing?

195
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:40,900
I bought it because I heard it helps with sleep.

196
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:42,990
Should I put it in your room?

197
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:06,940
I'm not used to sleeping in the room.

198
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:08,860
You sleep on the sofa.

199
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,960
If you keep flipping, I will feel uncomfortable and can't sleep either.

200
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:30,810
Go on and sleep.

201
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:32,990
That's a bit...

202
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,820
You're the patient.

203
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:35,760
You're a guest.

204
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:41,980
I'm really fine.

205
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:43,610
I won't move anymore.

206
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:48,520
I'm going to sleep here.

207
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:50,230
It's up to you if you want to go up and sleep.

208
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:52,410
Why?

209
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,770
Should I turn this off?

210
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:10,990
No.

211
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:14,930
I heard it helps with sleep,

212
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,560
so I bought it online.

213
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,540
Let's sleep.

214
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,090
Why do you keep doing this?

215
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:34,750
Why do you keep...

216
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,230
Yechan.

217
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:39,120
Are you okay?

218
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:42,270
Ah.

219
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:44,000
That's when it started.

220
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:49,460
Because of that accident... No matter how much I think about it, I must be really severely hurt.

221
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:50,960
No.

222
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:54,450
The X-ray showed no fractures.

223
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:57,090
No, but after the accident,

224
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:58,690
my chest has been hurting.

225
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,880
Your blood pressure is normal.

226
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,670
There's nothing unusual.

227
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:11,700
I heard that if the heart beats fast, it could be arrhythmia.

228
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,280
It's not.

229
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:16,460
Then...

230
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:18,890
I don't smoke or drink.

231
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:22,540
My paternal side has diabetes. Could it be something to do with the genetics?

232
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,210
No.

233
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:29,400
I've been picking random things and eating them.

234
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:31,850
Could it be a parasite worm that eats up hearts?

235
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,830
Heart... No.

236
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,130
Really?

237
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:41,400
Then why is this happening?

238
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:47,890
Chan.

239
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:50,290
That's not an illness.

240
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,080
Then what is it?

241
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:51,990
It's love.

242
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:53,280
Love.

243
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:54,930
Huh?

244
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,370
Love.

245
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,500
Chan you like that person now.

246
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:02,140
No way.

247
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:04,240
I haven't known him for long.

248
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:04,870
Hey man.

249
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:07,450
Time doesn't matter in love.

250
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:09,600
Feeling's what's important.

251
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:11,510
Feeling?

252
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,540
You said your heart beats fast

253
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,470
when you see him, right?

254
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:17,960
You get nervous too.

255
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,250
It's not an illness, there's only one answer.

256
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,130
You like Chief Baek's grandson, right?

257
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:23,880
I like him?

258
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:24,640
But...

259
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:26,480
is Mr. Baek's grandson seeing anyone?

260
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:30,140
Well...

261
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,000
I'm not sure.

262
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,700
Then let's start with that.

263
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:36,080
It's important. It could mean an obstacle.

264
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,560
And then?

265
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:39,610
It will also confirm your feelings.

266
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:41,420
If he answers no, he doesn't have one,

267
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:44,800
you will be in a good mood for no reason.

268
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:45,560
Good mood?

269
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:48,120
If he says yes, then your heart, boom...

270
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:49,910
And you crumble,

271
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:53,950
it means you're in love with Mr. Baek's grandson.

272
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,510
Ask him, Chan.

273
00:19:58,920 --> 00:19:59,710
Go! Go!

274
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:03,490
How can I

275
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,790
ask that question?

276
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,300
If he's seeing anyone...

277
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:13,790
Well...

278
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:27,340
Bro!

279
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,850
Bro!

280
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,390
Bro...

281
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:39,810
I'm here.

282
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,050
You reek of alcohol.

283
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:46,480
Why did you drink so much?

284
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,060
Just...

285
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,040
Just one glass?

286
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:51,750
It doesn't look like it.

287
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,510
I drank three bottles.

288
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:56,810
Rice wine.

289
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:00,400
You said you were going to work. Why did you drink so much?

290
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,910
Gosh, farmer

291
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:06,950
usually drink a little when they snack.

292
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:09,580
Who drinks three bottles of makgeolli?

293
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:15,820
I

294
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:19,390
want to know a lot about you.

295
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,170
Hm...

296
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:24,450
What do you like?

297
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:27,200
What do you like to eat?

298
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:29,460
What color do you like?

299
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:36,250
What else?

300
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:43,160
MBTI.

301
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:47,410
Hey, go to bed if you're drunk.

302
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:50,870
Hey.

303
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:53,730
Don't do this. Tell me.

304
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:55,380
I told you to go to bed.

305
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,740
Are you seeing anyone?

306
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,140
What?

307
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:09,400
Hey.

308
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,210
I'm asking if you're seeing anyone.

309
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:18,680
Yes, I do.

310
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:21,000
Huh?

311
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:24,130
I'm seeing someone.

312
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:27,270
Your heart, boom...

313
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,060
And if you crumble,

314
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,370
that means you're in love with Mr. Baek's grandson.

315
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:15,910
Do you not remember anything?

316
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:18,170
Not entirely.

317
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:19,100
He said he's seeing someone.

318
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:20,680
What should I do now?

319
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:21,970
Now,

320
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:23,910
I've confirmed my feelings.

321
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:25,230
If he's seeing someone, the game is over.

322
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,940
If you keep this up, it'll be too much.

323
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:29,650
You're just his friend.

324
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:30,970
Just a friend who'd lend a helping hand

325
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:32,840
when he needs help.
