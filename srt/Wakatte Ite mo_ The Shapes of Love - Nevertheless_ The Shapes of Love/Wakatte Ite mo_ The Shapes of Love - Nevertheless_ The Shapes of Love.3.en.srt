1
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,933
Good luck on your project.

2
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:26,586
I shouldn't take a step forward.

3
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:32,175
I'm aware of that.

4
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:38,389
That's why I couldn't
trust my own potential

5
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:42,060
and parted ways with the world

6
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:44,229
of art.

7
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:48,191
For example,
why don't you place these hands down?

8
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:49,526
- I see.
- Yeah.

9
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:52,445
When you do that,
it might emphasize the idea

10
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:55,406
that the weight of the wings
is preventing her from flying.

11
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:00,995
You're right. It gives off that image.

12
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:06,459
I was envious of people
who were devoted to their passion.

13
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:09,462
Careful, Hikari. Come on. Walk straight.

14
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:13,550
Come on. Get your act together.

15
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:16,219
- Saki,
- What?

16
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:19,097
- you talk like a samurai.
- What?

17
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:22,058
What the hell?

18
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:26,187
To me, she was shining so bright,
not caring about what others thought.

19
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:31,025
- What?
- You were in a bad mood today.

20
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:34,696
Personally, if there are only two men left
in this world, I'll choose Ruki.

21
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,533
I liked this free-spirited girl.

22
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:42,370
Hey, be careful.

23
00:02:42,453 --> 00:02:46,124
The last one to the convenience store
is buying ice cream!

24
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:47,458
Start!

25
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:49,210
And…

26
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:51,671
I wanted to hold her close.

27
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:53,339
Saki.

28
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:56,718
I know I shouldn't take a step forward…

29
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,679
Megu. Wait for me.

30
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:02,515
- …but nevertheless…
- Don't run! Hey!

31
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:23,221
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

32
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,058
- What are you making?
- Don't look.

33
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:28,226
What?

34
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:32,105
How can you wake up so early
when you were that drunk last night?

35
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:33,189
Right?

36
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:40,697
I'm so thankful for yesterday, Saki.

37
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:45,368
If you're this touchy-feely with everyone,
people will take it the wrong way.

38
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:47,829
I only do this to you, Saki.

39
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:53,960
Oh, never mind, I do it with you too.

40
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:04,429
I'm perfectly happy as long as I can
just snuggle with Azuki and Saki.

41
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:06,264
You dummy.

42
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,442
Instead of just sketching,

43
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:23,031
try to see beyond the surface
and think of the inner structure.

44
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:26,284
For example, it's easy to grasp
the structure

45
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:28,953
of the collarbone, elbow, and hip joint.

46
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,999
- I'm sure there was no special meaning
- When you raise your right arm,

47
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:35,126
- to that kiss.
- the structure changes,

48
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:39,881
‪so please keep that in mind…

49
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:54,854
- Thank you, everyone.
- Thank you.

50
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:57,523
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

51
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:15,041
- Suffering from lovesickness?
- Stop it.

52
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:19,378
Wait, you're really warm.

53
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,881
You're burning up.

54
00:06:22,381 --> 00:06:24,759
- Am I?
- Yeah. Are you okay?

55
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:27,720
Ren!

56
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:30,431
Stop it.

57
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:37,814
- What?
- Did you lose weight?

58
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:41,234
Here.

59
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:43,111
Thank you.

60
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:46,364
I was so happy to be back in Japan again

61
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:50,118
that I made reservations today
at a Japanese restaurant. Can you come?

62
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:52,745
Oh, I can't today.

63
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:55,915
Are you meeting up with your latest fling?

64
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:58,626
No…

65
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:03,214
Introduce her to me.
I also want to catch up with you.

66
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:06,467
I don't think I need
to introduce her to you.

67
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:08,845
You're so cold.

68
00:07:09,428 --> 00:07:11,389
You're apprehensive as usual.

69
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,394
Nick.

70
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,569
I'm doing the tour with him.

71
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:27,905
We'll have fun by ourselves today.
I'll contact you later.

72
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,117
Have fun.

73
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:39,792
Welcome.

74
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:42,587
Oh, it's Sou.

75
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:44,589
You were here?

76
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:47,717
Upon closer look,
you're pretty good-looking, Osakabe.

77
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:53,306
If you were going to eat lunch,
you should've invited me.

78
00:07:56,893 --> 00:08:01,105
Oh yeah, Miu has a fever. Poor girl.

79
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:04,025
Welcome. By the way, Hikari,

80
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:06,861
I saw that handsome guy from the other day
walking with a beautiful girl.

81
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:08,362
- I saw that too.
- You too?

82
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:09,947
What was she like?

83
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:13,659
- She was looking down, but she was pretty.
- Looking down, but pretty?

84
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:16,037
- Hikari.
- What?

85
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,413
Don't be too nosy.

86
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:21,334
Fine, fine. Stop being so jealous.

87
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,044
I know what I want.

88
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:28,925
Fried chicken lunch set. Large rice.
Cold tofu too.

89
00:08:33,137 --> 00:08:35,306
What's happening with the materials
for training next week?

90
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:37,642
Miu's in charge of that.

91
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:42,480
- Is Miu taking a day off today?
- Yeah, she's not feeling well.

92
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:44,649
What? Is she all right?

93
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:47,610
- She looked sick yesterday.
- Oh, really?

94
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:52,323
- Oh, but I have the data.
- Really? Can I see it?

95
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:54,825
- Mr. Kousaka.
- Yes?

96
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:56,827
Kamakura Banksy

97
00:08:57,578 --> 00:08:59,539
revealed another artwork.

98
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:01,457
- I see.
- Do you know anything?

99
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:04,627
No.

100
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:06,879
I thought so.

101
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:15,930
Can I have you take this portfolio
to Ms. Hamasaki?

102
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:18,474
Sure.

103
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:24,021
I want you to give her some advice too.

104
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:27,233
She's a little too serious.

105
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:57,972
Can you leave any packages
by the door, please?

106
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:00,141
It's Kousaka.

107
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:02,893
What?

108
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:08,274
Mr. Kousaka.

109
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:10,192
Are you okay?

110
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:14,405
Sorry, my place is a mess right now,

111
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:17,116
so can you wait just a little bit?

112
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:30,171
Thanks for letting me in.

113
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:33,382
This is from Ms. Usami.

114
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:35,551
Thank you.

115
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:39,639
- I'll leave this here for you too.
- Thank you.

116
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:55,821
Your fever has gone down.

117
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:02,119
I just had a little headache, that's all.

118
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:04,205
Did something happen?

119
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:09,335
I'm fine. It's a personal issue.

120
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:15,174
You never talk about yourself.

121
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:19,553
I can say the same for you too.

122
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,557
You're interested in my story?

123
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,562
I can't say that I'm not.

124
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:39,532
Hey, stop!

125
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:41,909
Give it back!

126
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:44,578
Why are you trying to hide it?

127
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:48,249
It's not good at all.

128
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:54,296
I like it.

129
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:56,632
What?

130
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:00,803
Unleashing your emotions

131
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:03,681
honestly into your artwork

132
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:05,683
is not something everyone can do.

133
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:14,442
Mr. Kousaka,

134
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:17,403
what motivates you to create your art?

135
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:30,040
You never talk about yourself.

136
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:37,006
Anyways, make sure you rest well.

137
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:40,384
You're looking a little pale.

138
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:42,678
I'll stay here until you go to sleep.

139
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:44,889
What?

140
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:46,640
Good night.

141
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:00,613
Here.

142
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:05,910
Thank you.

143
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:34,522
Why can't we remember
our dreams after we wake up?

144
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:39,568
I feel like

145
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:43,405
I had a strange dream once again.

146
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:54,375
I can't get any closer to him.

147
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:28,409
Are you feeling better?

148
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,954
I'm a lot better. I'll go to work today.

149
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,831
Today is Sunday.

150
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,960
You're too serious.

151
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,588
That's what Ms. Usami said,
but she was right.

152
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:47,636
Let's go somewhere.

153
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:59,189
Can I put on some make-up first?

154
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:06,363
- Ms. Usami told me the same thing.
- That being too serious is your weakness?

155
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:07,448
Yeah.

156
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:10,576
I want someone to say that to me.

157
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,912
You won't be hearing that
in your lifetime.

158
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:17,249
Yeah, I gave up on that.
No point in hoping for the impossible.

159
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,751
You give up so easily.

160
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,378
All right, let's have fun today.

161
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:27,593
True, it's not like I get paid overtime
for working on my day off.

162
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:30,012
- That's the spirit!
- All right.

163
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:35,976
- Um…
- Yeah?

164
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,812
- Can I open the window?
- Yeah.

165
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:53,535
It feels strange.

166
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:00,125
I was thinking that even when I'm alone,

167
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:03,170
time is passing by just like this.

168
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,465
- Yeah, you're serious after all.
- Hey.

169
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:07,466
Are you making fun of me?

170
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:08,509
‪-It's coming this way.
‪-Really?

171
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:09,510
No, I'm not.

172
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:12,513
‪-Look.
‪-It's coming.

173
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,723
- You're laughing.
- Really?

174
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:15,849
What?

175
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,060
Forget it.

176
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:19,228
‪Look!

177
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:23,357
Thank you for waiting.

178
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,859
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

179
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:27,653
Thank you.

180
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:28,946
Look, it's golden.

181
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:32,658
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

182
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:40,124
You have a mustache.

183
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:42,501
- You have one too, Saki.
- No way.

184
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:33,886
How can they go in the water
when it's this cold?

185
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:37,556
Wetsuits are pretty warm.

186
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:40,768
Megu, you've surfed before?

187
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:44,730
I've been surfing ever since
I was a teenager.

188
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:55,783
I guess there's a side of you
that I don't know about.

189
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:20,766
Saki, your hands are way too cold.

190
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:25,646
You're warm.

191
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:40,035
You're working on your project
on your day off?

192
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:44,081
The Art Festival this year
is my last chance.

193
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:46,542
Last chance?

194
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:51,463
I chose this course to go to Spain
as part of the sculpture team.

195
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:54,758
But before I knew it,
this was already my last year.

196
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:57,761
I see.

197
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:02,599
What about you, Mr. Kousaka?
Why did you come back to Japan?

198
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:07,146
Before I knew it, I was creating things,

199
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:09,940
and before I knew it,
I became famous overseas,

200
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:11,984
and before I knew it,
I had come back here.

201
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:14,820
Even though I didn't do anything.

202
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:25,372
Sometimes I just want to knock you down,
Mr. Kousaka.

203
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:27,249
I'm just kidding.

204
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:34,631
I came back here as a favor
for an old acquaintance of mine.

205
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:37,176
- I see.
- Yeah.

206
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:41,471
An old acquaintance.

207
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:49,563
Is there anywhere else you want to go?

208
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:57,404
I was able to enjoy the famous date spots
that everyone posts about. I'm satisfied.

209
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,741
Thank you for everything today.

210
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:06,246
Then, let's head back.

211
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:14,463
I want to see the butterfly.

212
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:19,718
Please.

213
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:43,116
This place is very you, Mr. Kousaka.

214
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,245
Don't be so formal with me
when you're in my house.

215
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:50,207
I thought you don't invite people
to your house.

216
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:53,418
Did I say that?

217
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,480
You're so fickle.

218
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:11,413
Mr. Kousaka.

219
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:15,375
Ren.

220
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:20,255
Ren.

221
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:27,679
I won't be able to turn back.

222
00:22:40,358 --> 00:22:41,651
I'm fine with that.

223
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:45,048
Thanks.

224
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:53,014
Hey!

225
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:54,641
- Let me use it.
- Here.

226
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:56,560
‪Stop it!

227
00:24:00,188 --> 00:24:01,690
Stop tousling my hair.

228
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:06,069
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

229
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:17,706
Good morning, Ren.

230
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:22,627
Good morning.

231
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:16,056
But I found earrings at his place.

232
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:20,143
He likes you, right, Miu?

233
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:25,106
He hasn't said so in words.

234
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:29,736
You don't like how the relationship
is ambiguous?

235
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:35,951
I don't know if I should
get more involved than I already am.

236
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,079
I don't know if he understands

237
00:25:39,162 --> 00:25:41,706
the concept of being
in a normal relationship.

238
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:46,628
What's "normal"?

239
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:53,426
To make it clear that you're dating,

240
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:55,887
no cheating.

241
00:25:56,429 --> 00:25:58,473
And what else?

242
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:03,144
Spend time together, I guess.

243
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:08,400
A "normal" love affair

244
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:11,027
might not exist.

245
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:36,261
It's rare to see you working
on a project this late.

246
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:40,098
I'll be leaving soon.

247
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:47,564
Really? You're so thoughtful. Thanks.

248
00:26:47,647 --> 00:26:53,069
Miu, you use the word "normal"
so naturally.

249
00:26:53,611 --> 00:26:56,531
What do you mean by that?

250
00:26:58,325 --> 00:27:03,872
Being normal is very hard for some people.

251
00:27:10,503 --> 00:27:11,629
Admit it.

252
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:15,508
You just wanted someone
to give you a nudge, right?

253
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:20,930
You may be right.

254
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:26,978
Miu, you're the type that would step out
even if someone tries to stop you.

255
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:36,237
If you want to see him,
I think it's okay to go see him.

256
00:27:39,657 --> 00:27:40,950
Okay.

257
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:43,078
What is it?

258
00:27:52,545 --> 00:27:53,880
Um…

259
00:27:54,547 --> 00:27:56,049
- Want to switch drinks?
- I like you!

260
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:06,851
You might be trying to pretend
like nothing happened the other day,

261
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:10,355
but I want to go out with you.

262
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,203
Just keep that in mind.

263
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:45,807
CAN I GO SEE YOU RIGHT NOW?

264
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:56,443
Saki.

265
00:29:00,363 --> 00:29:01,698
Megu,

266
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:04,951
are you having fun right now?

267
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:10,915
What's this phone call about?
You're so cute when you're drunk.

268
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:17,172
Hello? Are you still there?

269
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:24,804
Megu…

270
00:29:25,638 --> 00:29:26,598
Yes?

271
00:29:27,807 --> 00:29:29,642
What do you want right now?

272
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:33,146
I want you to come back home right away.

273
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:39,569
What I want is…

274
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:47,535
Hey.

275
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:50,288
Hello?

276
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:54,501
Ice cream.

277
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:59,714
I'm so confused, but I want Häagen-Dazs.

278
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:06,638
Your choice is way too fancy,
so forget it.

279
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:09,265
What? Then I'll have
the Yukimi ice cream instead.

280
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:11,684
I know I have to take a step forward…

281
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:14,729
but nevertheless…

282
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:19,484
I know I shouldn't take a step forward…

283
00:30:20,568 --> 00:30:22,070
but nevertheless…

284
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:49,556
Chiaki.

285
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:17,704
