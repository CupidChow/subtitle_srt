1
00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:17,434
It's hot, so be careful.

2
00:00:21,813 --> 00:00:23,356
Thank you.

3
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:42,250
It's delicious.

4
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:47,088
I'm glad.

5
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:17,118
She was trying to hold back tears.
I had never seen her

6
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:19,537
like that before.

7
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:29,506
UMAMIYA

8
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:35,470
Excuse me.

9
00:01:35,553 --> 00:01:37,472
Oh, you must be done serving lunch.

10
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:40,767
You made it just in time.

11
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:43,353
Oh, really?

12
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:44,646
Thank you.

13
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:47,565
- Please come inside.
- Thank you.

14
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,841
I kind of knew that I would
end up liking her.

15
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:15,718
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

16
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:18,638
I might not pass the exam
to become an assistant.

17
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:20,348
You'll do well, Megu.

18
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:21,891
Let's work hard together. Okay?

19
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:24,644
Her face when she's being kind.

20
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:26,604
What else are they doing?

21
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,772
Her face when she's in love.

22
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:29,274
Let me check.

23
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:32,527
I was just admiring her.

24
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:33,778
Thank you.

25
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:40,785
That should've been enough, but…

26
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:52,005
I want to be by her side…

27
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:55,300
but nevertheless…

28
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,333
May I come in?

29
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:18,800
I'm sorry…

30
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:22,011
about the other day.

31
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:27,100
I spoke rashly even though
I know nothing about you.

32
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:31,354
It's okay.

33
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:35,275
But I believe what I said.

34
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:41,990
You're going to exhibit your work
at the Art Festival, right?

35
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:45,243
Yes.

36
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,747
I'm also interested

37
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:52,750
in what you had mentioned.

38
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:59,507
I wonder who he really is.

39
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:07,682
Did you come here to tell me that?

40
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,226
No.

41
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:13,229
I…

42
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:17,483
wanted to know
what you were seeing, Ms. Hamasaki.

43
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:26,284
I've been

44
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:28,911
in a dilemma for a while.

45
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:36,711
I'm envious
that you can find yourself in a dilemma.

46
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,849
He would take a blank white canvas

47
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:55,480
and get absorbed with adding color to it.

48
00:05:57,356 --> 00:05:58,816
I always watched him do that.

49
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:02,737
I was the closest spectator.

50
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:08,284
- Two beers, please.
- Okay.

51
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:11,412
Chiaki,

52
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:14,207
you're a curator for which museum?

53
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:16,584
She's a freelancer

54
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:18,252
and has achieved a lot overseas too.

55
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:19,545
Wow.

56
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:21,464
You're so amazing.

57
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:23,549
Finding new talent

58
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:26,511
is one of your important duties, right?

59
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:29,931
I was also in charge of Mr. Kousaka's
touring exhibition.

60
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:31,974
I'm so jealous
you get to take care of him.

61
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:34,310
Looking after someone
who can't take care of themself

62
00:06:34,393 --> 00:06:37,230
- is backbreaking work.
- Hey.

63
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:40,525
- What do you mean by that?
- She's exposing him.

64
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:42,443
By the way,

65
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:45,738
my nephew came back to Japan
the other day…

66
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:47,323
Thank you.

67
00:06:47,406 --> 00:06:50,785
He built an artist-in-residence program
in Mashiko.

68
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:52,036
What is that?

69
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:56,457
It's a place where you can reside
as you work and create artwork.

70
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,668
Basically, it's where
you can enjoy your youth.

71
00:06:58,751 --> 00:06:59,710
That's right.

72
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:02,296
Would you like

73
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,798
to come take a look?

74
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:06,759
- What?
- That sounds like so much fun.

75
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:08,386
Is it like a training camp?

76
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:10,346
I'll go! I want to go to a hot spring too.

77
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,181
- Let's go.
- This isn't a vacation.

78
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:17,061
If you continue straining yourself
in one location,

79
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:19,313
the process of creating
can become more of a task.

80
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:21,691
You're right.

81
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:23,818
Loosening up and relaxing

82
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:26,279
is a part of the creation process.

83
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:28,489
- That's right.
- All right!

84
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:30,533
May I go too?

85
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:31,742
What?

86
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:35,246
I want to get to know everyone
in preparation for the Art Festival.

87
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:36,873
Good idea.

88
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:39,542
- That'll be perfect.
- Nice.

89
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:42,128
- Here's the fried horse mackerel.
- Wow.

90
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:43,671
- It's here.
- Here's the fried chicken.

91
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:45,631
Ruki, you should come too.

92
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:47,383
- Where?
- Ms. Usami.

93
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,302
Cooking is also a form of art, right?

94
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:52,513
I approve of that point of view.

95
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:54,682
Thank you.

96
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:57,518
A chef needs more than cooking skills.

97
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:59,145
Go and get some real-life experience.

98
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:01,397
- Mr. Suzuki.
- Here's the fried chicken.

99
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:05,318
Saki, you have a lot
of unused paid vacation days.

100
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:07,361
I do, but…

101
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:10,615
Maybe I'll go if Ruki is going.

102
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:13,201
I don't really understand what's going on.

103
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,661
- Let's go.
- Yeah, come along.

104
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:18,122
- This is delicious.
- Oolong tea, please.

105
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:20,249
I'll be leaving now.

106
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:23,252
- Take care.
- You're leaving already?

107
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,837
She's so good.

108
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,714
- Take care.
- Thank you for waiting.

109
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:28,841
- I'll be going now.
- Okay.

110
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:31,052
- Thank you for the meal.
- Take care.

111
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:34,764
Let me pay for the udon the other day.

112
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:36,516
Don't worry about that.

113
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,809
It was my treat. Or more like…

114
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:41,062
I made it for you.

115
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:43,481
Are you sure?

116
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:46,609
Thank you.

117
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:48,319
If you want to eat it again, come anytime.

118
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:50,238
It was really good.

119
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:51,489
‪I'm glad.

120
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:53,783
See you later.

121
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:00,748
Bye.

122
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:25,856
Ms. Usami, what kind of relationships
have you been in?

123
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,651
Oh, I wonder.

124
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:31,821
I can't imagine you being in love.

125
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:36,033
Don't ask such private questions.

126
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:37,451
Ms. Usami, I feel like

127
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,412
your car has gotten even more rugged.

128
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:42,665
- You're right.
- Strong and sturdy is sexy, isn't it?

129
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:44,834
A wild girl at heart. You're the best.

130
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:49,088
- You brought so much stuff.
- Strong and sturdy is sexy?

131
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:50,548
Because we'll play games at night.

132
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:51,507
Saki, being strong is…

133
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:54,135
- This bag will help us enjoy our youth.
- What do you mean?

134
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:56,887
- What's with that face?
- I have to process it mentally…

135
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:01,684
- Who wants to do a game tournament?
- Me.

136
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:04,186
- Oh?
- Me.

137
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,896
- Here? Right now?
- Me.

138
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:15,990
Your driving has improved.

139
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:17,033
Has it?

140
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:21,746
I haven't forgotten how a local
in Barcelona grabbed you by the collar.

141
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,081
You gave the wrong direction, Chiaki.

142
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:27,168
- You're blaming other people now?
- Hey, what do you think of this new dish?

143
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:30,254
- Wow that looks delicious.
- Come taste it once I complete it.

144
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:32,548
I look forward to it.

145
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:35,176
It turned out pretty well.

146
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:36,510
Looks good.

147
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:43,976
Follow your heart

148
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,354
and let your hands take over.

149
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:51,025
Emptying your mind
is also a necessary technique to learn.

150
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:55,696
It's been a while since we've
worked on a project like this.

151
00:10:57,698 --> 00:10:59,575
I forgot how much fun it was.

152
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:08,042
Shintaro, sorry for bringing
such a big group.

153
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:09,377
No problem.

154
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:12,630
It makes me happy to see
a group of new possibilities.

155
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:15,674
I want to gather young artists like this

156
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:17,676
and provide them with support here.

157
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:22,390
There are lots of people
who aren't aware of their own talent.

158
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:24,767
- Ms. Hayako.
- Yes?

159
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:30,731
You made a bowl?

160
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,486
Oh, this is supposed to be a cup.

161
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:37,113
- Really?
- Yeah.

162
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:39,865
Are you having fun?

163
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:42,284
What about you?

164
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:44,161
Yeah, I'm having fun.

165
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:45,204
I'm glad.

166
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:03,639
Everyone, go with your driver.

167
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:05,766
- Okay.
- Thank you.

168
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:09,353
- I'll lead the way.
- Thank you.

169
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:11,814
Thanks.

170
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:17,695
Miu.

171
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,781
Want to go shopping for ingredients?

172
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:23,033
I was told I can use that car.

173
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:29,957
‪Want to ride in the back?

174
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,209
‪-I can get on?
‪-Yeah.

175
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:40,050
You should probably sit down.

176
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:42,052
‪Excuse me.

177
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:12,917
Miu, why did you get into sculpting?

178
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:13,959
What are you making?

179
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:18,214
I…

180
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:22,092
wanted something that was certain.

181
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:24,178
Oh, this one?

182
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:25,471
How can I explain it?

183
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:31,268
Something that exists with certainty.

184
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:36,565
I wanted something that was tangible.

185
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:45,032
I think I understand that feeling.

186
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:49,828
There's nothing more certain than food.

187
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:52,831
You're right.

188
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:57,211
After all, humans are sustained by food.

189
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:04,301
In that case, there's nothing
more uncertain than a person's heart.

190
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:10,849
Maybe that's why people
want to create things.

191
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:16,522
I see.

192
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:24,655
The truth is,

193
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:31,120
I was given an offer to open
a new restaurant in Tokyo.

194
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:32,913
What? Really? That's amazing.

195
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:38,294
It was always my dream
to open up my own place.

196
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:44,174
You're moving forward
toward your goal, Ruki.

197
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:52,933
Although I'm a little sad
to leave Kamakura.

198
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:59,273
I couldn't imagine my life

199
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,110
without him.

200
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,746
- Oh.
- Hey, Ruki,

201
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:15,414
you wore that the wrong way.

202
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:16,916
- Is it?
- Ms. Hamasaki, Mr. Ruki.

203
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:19,627
BATHHOUSE

204
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:22,630
No way.

205
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:26,258
‪-You didn't notice?
‪-No.

206
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:28,427
The water is so soft.

207
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:30,179
It feels so good.

208
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:32,306
By the way, Miu,

209
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:34,516
thanks for going shopping
to buy stuff for the barbecue.

210
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,352
I didn't do anything at all.

211
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,229
Ruki is making all the preparations.

212
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:43,233
Ruki

213
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:46,403
is so nice that I feel like
he has some dark secret he's hiding.

214
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:47,905
Stop that, Megu.

215
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:50,950
I'm a little jealous.

216
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:54,161
I can tell that you guys
have been together for a long time.

217
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,413
We're besties.

218
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:58,457
I'm so envious.

219
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:01,585
Let's all take it easy and get along.

220
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:03,796
- Right?
- Yeah.

221
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:07,716
Take it easy, huh?
I wonder if I can do that.

222
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:11,303
Stop putting up barriers already.

223
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:12,346
‪Sorry.

224
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:29,822
Um…

225
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:35,619
What do you think about Miu?

226
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:40,708
I wonder.

227
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:49,341
I really like Miu.

228
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:55,431
How can you say you "really like" someone
so carelessly?

229
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:01,311
I'm not saying it carelessly.

230
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,649
And? What's the point you want to make?

231
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:13,824
I will make sure she's happy.

232
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:16,952
So,

233
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:21,123
please don't do anything
that would hurt her.

234
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:26,795
Is she hurt?

235
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:33,969
I'll be going now.

236
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:49,610
- How is it?
- It's cute.

237
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:52,112
- Is it cute?
- It's nice.

238
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:53,989
Barbecue is ready.

239
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,908
- Thank you.
- All right!

240
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:57,367
We're drinking already.

241
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:59,036
- Hurry on over.
- Okay.

242
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:00,704
- Let's go, everyone.
- Can I leave this?

243
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:02,414
Miu, let's go.

244
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:04,875
I'll go after I finish this part
I'm working on.

245
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,460
Okay.

246
00:18:06,543 --> 00:18:09,880
- It smells amazing.
- I want to finish my work.

247
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:11,799
Stop that!

248
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,101
Miu.

249
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,020
What is it?

250
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:34,029
Do you like Ruki?

251
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:40,369
You don't know anything at all.

252
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:44,540
I want to know.

253
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:52,172
What about you?
What's going on with you and Chiaki?

254
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:55,259
Chiaki is nothing like that.

255
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:05,435
Then, what about me?

256
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:14,736
Hey.

257
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:17,656
Everyone's waiting.

258
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:20,868
Okay.

259
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:36,425
That looks so good!

260
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:39,094
Is there a secret malicious side to you?

261
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,430
- What?
- He might have it.

262
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:42,681
I'm so curious now.

263
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:44,808
I'm not a good person.

264
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:46,894
Saki's artwork is really amazing.

265
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:49,897
- Ms. Kawase made all this?
- Yeah.

266
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,773
- This one too?
- Yeah.

267
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:54,610
- Amazing.
- Yeah, she's amazing.

268
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:56,820
- She quit art already?
- Where's the water?

269
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:59,323
It's over there.

270
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:00,949
- Thanks.
- Sure.

271
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,284
Such a waste of talent.

272
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:05,245
She used a face as a motif for this…

273
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:07,789
Are you okay?

274
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:10,792
- Can I see this?
- Yes, of course.

275
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,753
- Don't overdo it.
- Yeah. Thanks.

276
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:13,754
Are there more photos?

277
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:20,844
- But she's no longer doing this?
- Yeah.

278
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:38,278
I want to be by her side…

279
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:40,822
but nevertheless…

280
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:45,953
I never did anything about it.

281
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:51,083
Are you okay?

282
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:56,213
I'm trying to clear my mind.

283
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:01,176
I'm going to stop

284
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:03,845
being a bystander.

285
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:25,158
I like you.

286
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:36,211
I've liked you

287
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:39,715
for a long time, Miu.

288
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:55,772
Chiaki!

289
00:22:00,944 --> 00:22:02,779
- Can you call for an ambulance?
- Yes.

290
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:05,282
- Shintaro, where's the hospital?
- Give me that blanket.

291
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:07,701
Chiaki.

292
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:11,288
- Is she okay?
- Chiaki!

293
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:13,749
- Chiaki!
- Thank you.

294
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:16,126
Chiaki, can you hear me?

295
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:19,338
- Chiaki.
- Chiaki.

296
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:20,964
Are you okay?

297
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:23,717
Chiaki!

298
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:38,727
