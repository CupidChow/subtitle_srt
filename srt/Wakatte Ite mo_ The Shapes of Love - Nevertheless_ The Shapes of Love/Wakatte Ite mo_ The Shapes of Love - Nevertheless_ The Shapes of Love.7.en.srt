1
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:07,966
Miu.

2
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:13,012
I want to see you.

3
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:19,227
Me too.

4
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:25,066
I'll wait at that spot
where we took shelter from the rain.

5
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:30,780
Got it.

6
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,630
Are you okay?

7
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:28,643
Chiaki gave it her best for a long time.

8
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:31,646
What do you mean by "gave it her best"?

9
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:35,858
It was bound to end like this.

10
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:41,072
Isn't it futile to say things like that?

11
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:10,184
MEMORIAL SERVICE FOR CHIAKI IMAI

12
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,565
Wait.

13
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:24,741
Why…

14
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:27,493
didn't you tell me anything?

15
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:31,205
Would it have changed anything if I did?

16
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,543
Not really.

17
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:37,628
But…

18
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,089
I wish I knew.

19
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:42,216
And what would you have done?

20
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:45,303
I just wanted to--

21
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:48,681
Were you going to tell me
to stay by Chiaki's side until she died?

22
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:52,518
Or that you were going to wait for me
until she died?

23
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,812
- That's not what I mean.
- Then what?

24
00:05:57,565 --> 00:05:59,400
You always try to hide
your true feelings like that.

25
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:00,860
It's my personal problem.

26
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:04,655
It has nothing to do with you, Miu.

27
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:11,496
<i>There was a night…</i>

28
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,666
<i>when I thought I had touched his heart.</i>

29
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:57,291
I guess butterflies can tell
who's special and who's not.

30
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,636
They all come, but they always leave.

31
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:15,393
Doesn't that…

32
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,857
…make you lonely?

33
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:24,944
I wonder.

34
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:30,283
But there's no such thing as forever.

35
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:33,369
There's always an end.

36
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:42,044
Yeah, there's no love that lasts forever.

37
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:50,386
<i>The man that I considered</i>
<i>as someone extraordinary…</i>

38
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:56,684
<i>looked lonelier than anyone else.</i>

39
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:14,744
Isn't <i>soba</i> something you eat
after you move?

40
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:19,832
This <i>soba</i> is to celebrate New Year's.

41
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,176
Hey.

42
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:32,803
What?

43
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:36,974
Never mind. Nothing.

44
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:41,145
Is it about what I said the other day?

45
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:50,154
I think I was going crazy
spending too much time with you.

46
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:56,410
Thank you for the food.

47
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:00,748
Azuki.

48
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:06,087
- We're parting ways with this house.
- <i>We will soon be going different ways.</i>

49
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:07,922
It's sad, huh?

50
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:15,555
- It'll be lonely.
- <i>I know that I'm empty.</i>

51
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:17,306
Nice to meet you.

52
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,850
I look forward to working with you all.

53
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:24,105
<i>I knew right away that he was the same.</i>

54
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:28,234
Ms. Yoshino, it's nice that you don't have
regularity in your color schemes.

55
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:31,862
Usually one unconsciously
veers towards their favorite color.

56
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:36,492
I'm not too particular about color.

57
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,619
I always paint after emptying my mind.

58
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:42,039
Not being particular is a type of talent.

59
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:46,502
You don't really mean that.

60
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:50,256
That's not true.

61
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:57,013
<i>Because I'm empty…</i>

62
00:09:57,096 --> 00:10:00,558
How about carving a scenery

63
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:03,477
based on the motif, right onto the stand?

64
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:06,022
This might be cute.

65
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:09,275
<i>…I can understand people who are replete.</i>

66
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:10,860
Use the moon…

67
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:15,156
- <i>But…</i>
- I'm sorry it'll be incomplete.

68
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:16,782
<i>she was…</i>

69
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:19,118
I understand.

70
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:22,371
<i>…trying to empty herself.</i>

71
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:30,171
Are you okay?

72
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,089
Yeah.

73
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:37,178
In the end, I'm sure no one
wants any of my particularities.

74
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:44,226
<i>That's why I…</i>

75
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:46,604
I'll help you out.

76
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:49,440
<i>…I wanted to be right next to her</i>

77
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:52,652
<i>to pick up all of her pieces.</i>

78
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:54,779
I don't want you to lose
your particularity, Saki.

79
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:57,323
<i>Or so I thought.</i>

80
00:10:58,449 --> 00:10:59,909
I like you,

81
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:01,952
Megu.

82
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:05,665
Not as a friend.

83
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:08,292
What?

84
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:13,547
I was asked to move to Mashiko.

85
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:17,718
I see.

86
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:28,270
I'll go buy some ice cream.

87
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:34,985
<i>I ran away.</i>

88
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:40,699
<i>I was afraid to face my own feelings.</i>

89
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:02,471
It's from Chiaki.

90
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:06,142
Chiaki?

91
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:12,815
She was preparing this on the down low.

92
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:18,696
She felt guilty
for bringing you back to Japan.

93
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:22,658
She wanted you to spread your wings
overseas once again.

94
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:29,874
It's so her, isn't it?

95
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:37,798
Ren.

96
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,220
What are you seeing right now?

97
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:02,406
<i>Ren.</i>

98
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,200
<i>Let's go eat hamburgers.</i>

99
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:05,951
<i>Look this way. Ren.</i>

100
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:07,661
<i>That hamburger was the best.</i>

101
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:09,371
<i>It's still on your face.</i>

102
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:16,086
<i>At least give me some excitement.</i>
<i>Give me one year of your life, Ren.</i>

103
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:18,047
<i>Be my boyfriend just one more time.</i>

104
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,841
<i>I endured it for 17 years.</i>

105
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,843
<i>I hope you'll praise me someday.</i>

106
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,471
<i>Ren.</i>

107
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:56,544
Mr. Kousaka.

108
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:03,217
Good morning.
You didn't take your car today?

109
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,343
Good morning.

110
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:08,472
I heard your exhibition in New York
has been decided.

111
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:13,811
I'm sorry I can't stay
to see everyone's final completed project.

112
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:17,231
You don't really mean that.

113
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:22,027
You said that to me before too.

114
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:28,158
I don't have any reason to stay here
any longer either.

115
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:32,288
We're both empty.

116
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:39,795
Bye.

117
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:49,889
It'll be lonely
now that Mr. Kousaka will be leaving.

118
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:52,224
Even if I'm here?

119
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:53,893
I don't mean it that way.

120
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,185
I know.

121
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:58,272
Sou.

122
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:02,818
You just got jealous over me, right?

123
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:05,446
It's only natural.

124
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:06,780
How should I say this?

125
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:13,245
I'm afraid
of seeing you lose those feelings, Sou.

126
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:15,372
Why are you sure
that I'm going to lose it?

127
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:19,209
Those things started to scare me
the moment we started dating.

128
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:24,882
What did I say right now
that could've possibly made you smile?

129
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:26,508
Well…

130
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:28,844
Basically,

131
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:32,681
you don't want me to change, right?

132
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:35,267
Of course.

133
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:37,561
Why wouldn't that make me happy?

134
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:43,442
You're strange, after all.

135
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:49,615
I'm sorry for the sudden change
in my schedule.

136
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:54,870
I knew from the very beginning

137
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:58,624
that I wouldn't be able to keep you here
at the university forever.

138
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:04,171
It was a short while,

139
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:06,465
but thank you very much.

140
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:10,135
Likewise. Thank you.

141
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:30,447
Okay, okay.

142
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:31,865
- It's not there, right?
- Yeah.

143
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:40,833
<i>He left, and I didn't see him after that.</i>

144
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:45,796
He is our new substitute teacher.

145
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:47,006
Mr. Tsuchiya.

146
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:51,135
I specialize in metal, but I've dabbled
in all sorts of materials, so please…

147
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:53,762
<i>It was as if nothing had ever happened.</i>

148
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:54,805
Nice to meet you.

149
00:16:57,474 --> 00:16:59,727
<i>All that was left</i>
<i>was the empty everyday routine.</i>

150
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:08,527
15TH KAMAKURA ART FESTIVAL 2025

151
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:13,866
It makes the imagination run wild.

152
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:15,367
Just as I expected.

153
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,554
<i>I was reminded of my helplessness.</i>

154
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:45,939
<i>I could no longer remember</i>
<i>why I was even creating art.</i>

155
00:17:56,992 --> 00:17:59,953
<i>The person you are calling is unavailable.</i>

156
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:04,291
<i>Please leave</i>
<i>your name and message after the beep.</i>

157
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:07,544
<i>Hello.</i>

158
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:11,673
<i>How's the creating process coming along?</i>

159
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:15,636
<i>If there's anything I can do,</i>

160
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,054
<i>please tell me.</i>

161
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:22,726
Later. Bye.

162
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:49,753
You're going to use metal?

163
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:51,755
Hello.

164
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:53,882
Let me sit.

165
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:58,262
Did Mr. Kousaka

166
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:02,057
leave anything behind with you,
Ms. Hamasaki?

167
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:07,771
I wonder.

168
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:15,070
Looking at Mr. Kousaka

169
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:18,031
is painful.

170
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:23,245
I haven't been able

171
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:26,498
to fully understand why that is.

172
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:33,338
This can be said for Chiaki too,

173
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:36,717
but no matter how fleeting
it may have been,

174
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:41,346
people always leave something behind
with everyone they've met.

175
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:44,433
Like a scar.

176
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,396
That's why, Ms. Hamasaki,

177
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:54,568
you can't disassociate
"living" and "creating"

178
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:56,653
so easily.

179
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:06,205
The process you took to observe someone

180
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:09,625
is where you will find yourself.

181
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:21,720
Moments of pain
open doors of opportunities.

182
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:24,514
Do your best.

183
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:28,977
Yes.

184
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:31,772
See you later.

185
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:35,609
Thank you.

186
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:45,827
<i>What did he leave behind with me?</i>

187
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:49,581
<i>What was I able</i>

188
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:52,876
<i>to leave behind for him?</i>

189
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:28,537
Megu? What are you doing here?

190
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:31,081
Don't look so surprised.

191
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:34,293
I've never seen you stay late
to work on your project.

192
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:37,129
I can get serious
when I put my mind to it.

193
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:39,881
I know that.

194
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:44,511
Wanna eat?

195
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:52,644
Are you lost?

196
00:21:57,941 --> 00:21:59,067
I…

197
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:02,904
get anxious when I think
that I might be empty inside.

198
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:07,743
You feel that way too?

199
00:22:08,618 --> 00:22:11,705
- It's only normal.
- I didn't expect you to.

200
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:20,172
- What is it?
- Nothing.

201
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:25,302
It reminded me of how Saki scolded me
for using the word "normal".

202
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:32,768
Unlike me, she's good at everything,

203
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:35,520
but I realized that maybe
she couldn't take a step forward.

204
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:39,983
She's serious too.

205
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:42,819
Yeah.

206
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:47,824
The university at night is thrilling.

207
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:49,367
Remember the "test of courage" game?

208
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:51,161
How nostalgic.

209
00:22:51,244 --> 00:22:53,413
The legendary "spirited away" incident.

210
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:55,415
We were searching for like two hours.

211
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:57,667
It was a big incident.

212
00:22:57,751 --> 00:23:00,253
Four police cars came too.

213
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:04,883
Saki got scared the moment it began,

214
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:08,011
so she left and stayed home all alone,
shaking in fear.

215
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,430
It's funny every time I hear it.

216
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:13,600
She said she didn't want to be a downer.

217
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:15,769
Normally, you would tell someone
you're leaving.

218
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:17,729
But she's not normal.

219
00:23:18,313 --> 00:23:20,816
We're using the word "normal"
a lot right now.

220
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:25,278
Can I ask you a question?

221
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:26,863
Yeah?

222
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:32,577
You like Mr. Kousaka, right?

223
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:36,873
Yeah.

224
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:39,042
I liked him.

225
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:40,961
Past tense?

226
00:23:55,642 --> 00:23:56,726
I…

227
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:00,021
think…

228
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:03,733
I like Saki.

229
00:24:08,446 --> 00:24:09,573
I see.

230
00:24:14,077 --> 00:24:16,746
That's not the reaction I was expecting.

231
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,206
What were you expecting?

232
00:24:19,082 --> 00:24:22,252
I thought you would get weirded out.

233
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:24,921
No way. Because…

234
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:27,257
there's no such thing as "normal", right?

235
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:30,468
Right.

236
00:24:33,346 --> 00:24:37,350
<i>I'm thinking of making it for Saki.</i>

237
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:40,145
- <i>Your artwork?</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

238
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:44,107
<i>I was trying to draw something out</i>
<i>from myself,</i>

239
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:46,234
<i>but nothing was coming out.</i>

240
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:50,197
<i>But when I thought that I could</i>
<i>make something to show Saki,</i>

241
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,365
<i>ideas came to me so naturally.</i>

242
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:54,701
<i>I see.</i>

243
00:25:07,797 --> 00:25:09,716
<i>What could I leave behind?</i>

244
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:13,887
<i>While I was consumed with that thought,</i>

245
00:25:15,555 --> 00:25:16,681
<i>Megu was</i>

246
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:20,685
<i>creating things to embody</i>
<i>her feelings for Saki.</i>

247
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:25,482
<i>I had</i>

248
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:28,443
<i>received many things from him.</i>

249
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:35,325
<i>It made me want to embody that.</i>

250
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:40,288
<i>Until then…</i>

251
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,457
<i>I…</i>

252
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:14,698
You finished?

253
00:26:17,784 --> 00:26:18,827
Yeah.

254
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:44,894
Good morning.

255
00:26:45,895 --> 00:26:47,063
Hey.

256
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:50,233
- These are for you.
- Thank you.

257
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:03,621
GOKURAKUJI

258
00:27:11,629 --> 00:27:12,756
I'll be off.

259
00:27:15,508 --> 00:27:16,426
Take care.

260
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:41,284
<i>I realized that I wanted to be</i>
<i>by your side forever.</i>

261
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:44,829
<i>So, I decided to take a step forward.</i>

262
00:28:22,325 --> 00:28:23,660
I brought you a present.

263
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:00,989
I…

264
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:06,286
like you, Saki.

265
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:24,637
You tend…

266
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:31,352
to pack a lot into small things.

267
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:35,190
That's the Megumi I've always loved.

268
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,134
‪Megu.

269
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:15,480
<i>Even if I am to get hurt…</i>

270
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:21,486
<i>that's fine.</i>

271
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:50,139
Miu.

272
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:56,688
In my own way, I want to express

273
00:30:58,064 --> 00:31:00,108
the things I received from you
when we were together.

274
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:05,655
I see.

275
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,243
I always

276
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:14,747
wanted you to look my way.

277
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:19,002
But I won't see you anymore.

278
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:39,350
