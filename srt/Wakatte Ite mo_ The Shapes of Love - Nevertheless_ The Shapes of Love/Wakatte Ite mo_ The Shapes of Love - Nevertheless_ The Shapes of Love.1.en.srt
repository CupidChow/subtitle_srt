1
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:21,938
Knowing that forever doesn't exist…

2
00:00:23,481 --> 00:00:24,899
but nevertheless…

3
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:31,990
Knowing not to hold out hope…

4
00:00:33,908 --> 00:00:35,452
but nevertheless…

5
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:01,144
Knowing that it's going to end in pain,
but nevertheless…

6
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:11,905
We are drawn towards the light.

7
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:21,039
Love

8
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:24,834
only leaves behind scars.

9
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:31,841
My time

10
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:34,803
has stopped ever since that day.

11
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:39,474
It's a bit erotic.

12
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,393
Isn't it a little too explicit?

13
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:45,104
I'm sure someone modeled for this.

14
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:46,314
- You think so?
- Of course.

15
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:49,025
- What kind of situation is this?
- You never know.

16
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:50,860
- You never know.
- I guess so.

17
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:02,664
BEAUTIFUL WINGS

18
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:03,706
Miu.

19
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:09,796
It's the worst.

20
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:12,757
What is?

21
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:15,426
Your artwork.

22
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:19,139
Don't you remember?

23
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:22,433
Remember what?

24
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:26,062
That's you when you were crying
and begging me not to break up with you.

25
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,275
Are you jealous that my work
is being recognized?

26
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:35,238
I was hurt.

27
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:38,324
Art needs context.

28
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:42,162
One can't produce good results
just by interacting with oneself.

29
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:44,164
I've said this so many times before.

30
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:49,043
You always want to remain
in the same place.

31
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:56,551
Stop justifying yourself by creating
pieces based on your stagnant life.

32
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,099
Goodbye.

33
00:03:23,202 --> 00:03:25,830
It was an image of me

34
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:28,791
only thinking with my head
and never being able to fly away.

35
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,544
- Good work.
- You too.

36
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:38,176
Ever since that day,
I stopped holding expectations.

37
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:49,896
So that no one could ever hurt me.

38
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:55,360
So that no one could ever steal my heart.

39
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:00,615
If I was going to get hurt,

40
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:05,286
I'd rather not hope for anything
to begin with.

41
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:09,123
That's what…

42
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:19,968
I thought…

43
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,641
Sorry.

44
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:45,201
But I came to want him for myself.

45
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,045
I knew I shouldn't hold out hope…

46
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:00,758
but nevertheless…

47
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:12,538
A substitute teacher?

48
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:18,002
While I'm busy managing the Art Festival,

49
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:20,838
I want someone to look after
the grad students.

50
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:23,549
So, an acquaintance recommended
someone to me.

51
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:27,762
Yeah, the students this year are behind
in their graduation projects.

52
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:32,475
I know you're worried about the students,
but think about yourself too.

53
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,770
You're right.

54
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:40,066
The qualification exam
to study abroad in Spain--

55
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:43,027
I know that this year is the last.

56
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:47,615
Mr. Kousaka is an artist
with lots of experience

57
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:49,158
working in Europe.

58
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:51,786
I think it'll be a good inspiration
for you, Hamasaki.

59
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:54,997
Ren Kousaka.

60
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:59,502
Oh, about that incident the other day
with the statue…

61
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:03,339
Can you give your report
to the administration office?

62
00:07:03,422 --> 00:07:06,134
It seems like they're going
to report the damage to the police,

63
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:08,302
but you didn't see his face, right?

64
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:11,097
I didn't.

65
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,309
He ran away.

66
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:18,312
But you know,

67
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,233
he has good sense when it comes to art.

68
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:31,534
I don't like it.

69
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:34,579
UMAMIYA

70
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:36,164
I see.

71
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:40,501
I gave up on going abroad
and started working.

72
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:44,088
So, I think Ms. Usami is placing
her expectations on you now.

73
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:45,965
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

74
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:48,134
It's not your fault, Saki.

75
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:50,011
The problem lies entirely with me.

76
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:53,389
By any chance,

77
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:58,227
are you still hung up over that jerk?

78
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:08,613
In the end, love just hurts you
and leaves you with a scar.

79
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:14,869
Instead of wasting my heart on that,
I'd rather focus on my art.

80
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,788
Or so I thought, but…

81
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,208
But?

82
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:23,586
I didn't submit anything
in the competition last year.

83
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:25,755
I see.

84
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:29,800
My job contract as an assistant
will end next semester too.

85
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:32,011
The advertising industry is fun.

86
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:35,306
If you're interested, I'll hook you up.

87
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:36,849
Thank you.

88
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:43,022
All right. Thanks for the meal.

89
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:46,234
I'm going to meet Megu later on
at the university.

90
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:49,362
What? Megu is more at a standstill
than I am.

91
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:51,906
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

92
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:54,742
What's wrong with the assistants
at Kamakura Art?

93
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:57,703
Being an assistant kind of leaves you
in a lurch.

94
00:08:57,787 --> 00:09:01,707
I'm sorry. As someone who ran away,
I have no right to judge you.

95
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,459
I didn't mean it like that.

96
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:06,587
I know. Bye. See you.

97
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:09,048
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

98
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:11,175
Here you go.

99
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:14,387
- Thank you.
- Are you at a dead end?

100
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:19,016
It's difficult when I'm told to do
as I please.

101
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:23,813
Our pacific saury is served with
the gokuwase mandarin orange.

102
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:28,025
It comes out in a poem called
"Pacific Saury Song" that Grandpa likes.

103
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:29,110
I see.

104
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:31,696
Using settings from stories or poems

105
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:34,198
might expand one's imagination
when creating something.

106
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:39,662
Oh, sorry, it's not like I know
anything about art.

107
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,372
Ruki, stop slacking off.

108
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:42,790
Okay.

109
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:46,377
Thank you. I'll keep that in mind.

110
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:16,699
BUTTERFLIES

111
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,595
- Saki!
- Good to see you.

112
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:43,517
- You're working hard.
- Yeah.

113
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:48,064
Wow.

114
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:49,815
Here, grab my hand.

115
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:55,571
You scared me.

116
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:59,200
There's something comforting
about the way you smell.

117
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:02,244
You're going to get clay all over me.

118
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:05,414
Well, what's going on?

119
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,917
I broke up with my boyfriend.
I have nowhere to live.

120
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,920
What? Already?

121
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:15,758
Because he kept trying to kiss me
even when I wasn't feeling well, and--

122
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:20,054
That's why I told you
not to go out with him.

123
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:30,356
I'll do the housework and everything,
so can you let me stay at your place?

124
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:31,440
Please!

125
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:38,864
- Only until you find your own place.
- Hooray!

126
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:42,701
- Are you really going to look for a place?
- Yay!

127
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:44,703
BUTTERFLIES
HERMAN HESSE

128
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:48,184
Can I sit here?

129
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:50,311
Sorry.

130
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:55,232
What?

131
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:01,697
I'll have what she's having.

132
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:03,157
Okay.

133
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:13,876
I'm going to report you.

134
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:15,794
Even though you didn't tell on me
until now?

135
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:22,510
You're in art school,
so you could've drawn a sketch of me.

136
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:28,349
Draw me.

137
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:50,955
Please don't look at me.

138
00:13:58,837 --> 00:14:00,130
You like butterflies?

139
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:02,633
It's a reference for my work.

140
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:07,304
Miu.

141
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:09,473
What?

142
00:14:10,849 --> 00:14:11,976
How do you know?

143
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:15,521
How do you write it?

144
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:20,484
- I won't tell you.
- Give me a hint.

145
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:27,366
It might be connected to butterflies.

146
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:32,413
"Beautiful wings."

147
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:36,166
It suits you.

148
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:39,920
Is that so?

149
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:53,225
What are you doing?

150
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:41,607
Want one?

151
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:44,360
No, thanks.

152
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:09,134
Actually, I want one.

153
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:14,682
Here.

154
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:23,983
You okay?

155
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:33,951
Let's get out of here.

156
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:35,744
What?

157
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:45,754
Oh.

158
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:48,507
This is my pet butterfly.

159
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:50,843
It's beautiful.

160
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:53,053
Is it in a cage?

161
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:54,263
Wanna come and see?

162
00:16:57,933 --> 00:17:02,312
Grandma told me not to follow
suspicious people.

163
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:04,523
Then, do you want to report me?

164
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:07,443
Maybe I will.

165
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:16,660
Why did you do that?

166
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:24,418
Don't you have days
when nothing matters anymore?

167
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:33,177
I think that only people who are blessed
can say things like that.

168
00:17:57,284 --> 00:17:59,078
- Let's go.
- What?

169
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:06,752
Sorry.

170
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:08,629
For what?

171
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:11,757
I always bring the rain.

172
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:15,135
You're way too self-conscious.

173
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,389
But now we can take shelter from the rain.

174
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:56,093
Do you do this to everyone?

175
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:08,856
Hey, Ren!

176
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:11,191
- Long time no see.
- Long time no see.

177
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:12,776
This rain is crazy, isn't it?

178
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:16,864
Listen, the other day, I went to Okinawa,
but look at this.

179
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:18,740
It's Takuma with a different girl.
Isn't it crazy?

180
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,409
- Oh yeah.
- Right?

181
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:23,162
That's why we were planning
to go eat somewhere with Tomo.

182
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:24,955
- You should come too, Ren.
- Now?

183
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:26,456
I'll be going now.

184
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:33,463
Sorry about that.

185
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:36,425
- No problem.
- Really?

186
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:38,010
- It's been too long.
- Let's go.

187
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:47,895
Ren.

188
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:52,274
Long time no see.

189
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:54,818
You came back?

190
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:58,697
Knowing you, I thought
you'd stay in Spain.

191
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:03,994
I haven't set foot in a school
in a long time.

192
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:09,416
- School doesn't suit you.
- Same goes for you.

193
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:15,422
- How long will you be here?
- Just today.

194
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:19,259
Ms. Usami asked me for a favor,
so I did one lecture.

195
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:20,552
I'm leaving now.

196
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:23,347
I see. I'll be going now.

197
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:27,643
Ren.

198
00:20:29,978 --> 00:20:31,313
Is this what you wanted?

199
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:53,835
Hey.

200
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:56,004
Hey.

201
00:20:57,589 --> 00:21:00,384
Who do you think is the culprit
behind the paint incident?

202
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:01,468
‪No idea.

203
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:04,972
That mural was amazing.

204
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:07,391
It'd be awesome if he's handsome too.

205
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:09,184
Is that right?

206
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,062
You work out every day, don't you?

207
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:14,398
If that culprit appears again,

208
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:17,192
catch him and bring him to me.

209
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,695
Is looks all that matters to you?

210
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:23,115
Someone whose looks are through the roof
can get away with anything.

211
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:26,118
Hey, you. You're thinking
like a crazy person.

212
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:29,621
You're pretty crazy for addressing
a girl as "you".

213
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:32,791
Good morning.

214
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,795
Ms. Usami, I thought you had a meeting.

215
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:40,841
I'm here to introduce
your new substitute teacher.

216
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:44,720
My name is Ren Kousaka. Nice to meet you.

217
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:48,849
Sou, this is an example
of "looks that are through the roof".

218
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:53,979
- Whoa, it's really him.
- You know him?

219
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:55,022
Let me introduce everyone.

220
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:57,607
- I'm a huge fan.
- Are you serious?

221
00:21:58,191 --> 00:22:00,986
This is Ms. Yoshino and Ms. Hamasaki.

222
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:03,947
They're my assistants.

223
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:07,034
If you have any questions,
please ask them.

224
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:07,993
Okay.

225
00:22:08,618 --> 00:22:11,580
I'm Megumi. Call me Megu.
Nice to meet you.

226
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:12,956
Nice to meet you.

227
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:19,796
Nice to meet you. I'm Miu Hamasaki.

228
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:27,012
Nice to meet you.
I look forward to working with you.

229
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,143
Nice to meet you.

230
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:35,604
I'm Akane Yagihashi, a first year student.

231
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:36,855
I'm Mizuho Hasegawa.

232
00:22:36,938 --> 00:22:38,565
- Nice to meet you.
- Likewise.

233
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:40,692
UMAMIYA

234
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:41,902
I have a favor.

235
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:44,696
Please let me be
your girlfriend for just three seconds.

236
00:22:45,947 --> 00:22:48,200
- Akane.
- Stop it.

237
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:49,618
Just three seconds?

238
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:51,578
- What?
- What did he say?

239
00:22:51,661 --> 00:22:54,456
‪Mr. Kousaka!

240
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:58,251
You were doing the Europe Touring
Exhibition until a couple of days ago.

241
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:00,087
Yeah, you know about that?

242
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:03,090
You must be busy. Why did you decide
to come to our university?

243
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,344
Kamakura is my hometown.

244
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:09,888
I thought I'd enjoy the air here
for a change of pace.

245
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:13,391
I'm so happy I can share this air
with you right now.

246
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:15,727
- Me too.
- Same here.

247
00:23:18,396 --> 00:23:20,482
Is this a bat?

248
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:22,818
No, it's a butterfly.

249
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:24,361
- A butterfly?
- Yeah.

250
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:28,615
You use butterflies as your motif
in a lot of your work,

251
00:23:28,698 --> 00:23:30,617
but is there a special reason for that?

252
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:34,079
Can you stop being a die-hard fan
at a place like this?

253
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:36,164
- I have to take this chance.
- As we're drinking.

254
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:38,125
‪Right.

255
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:42,254
- Thank you.
- Thank you for the food!

256
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:47,717
- Miu, this is yours, right?
- Oh yeah, thanks.

257
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:50,929
Hello?

258
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:55,016
Okay.

259
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:57,310
Bye.

260
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:04,442
- I'll be leaving now.
- What?

261
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:07,821
- You have a girlfriend waiting for you?
- No, I don't.

262
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:12,742
The wings of a butterfly seem like
they'll break with just a touch.

263
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:14,828
Get home safe.

264
00:24:17,372 --> 00:24:18,915
"Beautiful wings."

265
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:22,043
- What?
- It suits you.

266
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:30,886
All right. Who wants to drink
at Saki's house?

267
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:33,138
- Me!
- Me too.

268
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:34,973
‪Okay.

269
00:24:35,056 --> 00:24:37,976
- Let's go, Miu.
- Yeah, sure.

270
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:48,737
Give me one year…

271
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:52,115
of your life, Ren.

272
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:59,414
One small blue butterfly…

273
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:04,127
is carried away by the wind.

274
00:25:06,254 --> 00:25:08,757
The sudden shower
of color of iridescent pearls,

275
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,761
sparkles, flickers, and fades away.

276
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:17,599
Hey! What are you doing? Stop right there.

277
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:22,520
Just like that, it sparkles for a moment…

278
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:27,317
Just like that, it's carried away
by the wind…

279
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:32,280
and happiness sent me signals

280
00:25:36,284 --> 00:25:38,703
as it sparkled, flickered, and faded away.

281
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:56,471
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

282
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:13,738
- Good work today.
- You too.

283
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:18,952
- Thank you for your hard work.
- You too.

284
00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:22,914
Where's the key for the storage warehouse?

285
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:26,334
Ms. Usami asked me to organize things
before the Art Festival.

286
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,296
Megu, you're assisting a class
after this, right?

287
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:30,672
I'll check it out for you.

288
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:32,716
Are you serious? You're the best!

289
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,551
Thank you. That'll be a big help.

290
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:05,206
Can I tag along too?

291
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:06,666
What?

292
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:10,628
Oh…

293
00:27:11,629 --> 00:27:12,881
Sure.

294
00:27:16,843 --> 00:27:17,969
‪STORAGE WAREHOUSE

295
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:19,888
What's stored here?

296
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:21,723
It's mostly pieces

297
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:24,476
that students
didn't collect after graduation.

298
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:29,022
Does that mean they left it here
to be disposed of?

299
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:32,275
To be more precise,

300
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:34,861
there are many students
who don't come to retrieve it,

301
00:27:34,944 --> 00:27:37,197
so we dispose of it.

302
00:27:56,966 --> 00:28:01,346
Are you going to submit your work
this year at the Art Festival?

303
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:06,601
I'm not sure.

304
00:28:10,271 --> 00:28:12,565
It's about yourself, but you don't know?

305
00:28:15,902 --> 00:28:19,239
I don't know because it's about myself.

306
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:18,590
What?

307
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:21,593
What are you doing?

308
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:27,182
Something like this without any aspiration
isn't worth keeping around.

309
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:33,730
Here.

310
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:01,049
I…

311
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:06,262
have been unable to move on
ever since that day.

312
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:08,681
That's you when you were crying
and begging me

313
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:09,891
not to break up with you.

314
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:11,976
You always want to remain
in the same place.

315
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:30,578
No matter how badly I get hurt,

316
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:33,498
I get drawn

317
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:36,209
toward the light.

318
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:54,185
The time that had stopped

319
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:56,521
started moving again.

320
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:04,529
Well?

321
00:31:07,323 --> 00:31:09,158
Not bad.

322
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:34,934
I knew I shouldn't hold out hope…

323
00:31:37,854 --> 00:31:39,397
but nevertheless…

324
00:31:45,111 --> 00:31:46,279
Bye.

325
00:34:34,947 --> 00:34:36,949
