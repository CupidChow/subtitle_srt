1
00:00:30,947 --> 00:00:32,532
<i>The view in front of me…</i>

2
00:00:35,326 --> 00:00:37,579
<i>was always the white ceiling.</i>

3
00:00:44,669 --> 00:00:46,379
- Hey.
- Ren!

4
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:47,630
I bought hamburgers.

5
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:50,133
- Awesome.
- Will the smell give it away?

6
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:53,553
I'll follow you forever.

7
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:55,513
You're way too easy.

8
00:00:57,932 --> 00:00:59,100
Let's eat.

9
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:01,895
- It's okay for you to eat dinner here?
- My parents won't be coming home.

10
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:07,734
Delicious.

11
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:14,074
<i>He was the one that added color</i>
<i>to the blank ceiling.</i>

12
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:18,453
WAGATSUMA
CHILDREN'S ATELIER

13
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:36,137
These were left out. Minus one point.

14
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:39,766
It's cute.

15
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:41,559
What's with that stern look?

16
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:50,693
Ren. Let's go eat hamburgers.

17
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:53,571
<i>The doctor said my recovery was a miracle.</i>

18
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,534
<i>Ren guided me</i>

19
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:00,620
<i>to the world of art.</i>

20
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:04,499
<i>The world seen through Ren's eyes</i>

21
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:07,168
<i>was all that I had.</i>

22
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:08,378
Look this way.

23
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:27,939
Chiaki.

24
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:33,736
Let's go back to being friends.

25
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:38,950
<i>I knew that he was</i>
<i>the most important person</i>

26
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:42,120
<i>in my life.</i>

27
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:48,626
<i>So I chose to be as close to him</i>
<i>as possible.</i>

28
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:52,881
Ren.

29
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:59,012
If you're only creating art,
you'll fail your course.

30
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:01,055
What's the point if I can't make art
when I want to?

31
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:02,140
There you go again.

32
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:04,767
It's pointless for you
to be taking all these notes.

33
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:11,357
Why do you always have to be like this?

34
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:13,234
You little…

35
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:15,862
- You're so strong.
- Give it back.

36
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:18,281
Thank you.

37
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:25,914
Chiaki.

38
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:33,796
‪EXAM ROOM

39
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,756
Well…

40
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:39,052
There was always the risk of a relapse.

41
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,930
You'll get better, right?

42
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:45,308
<i>It didn't seem like</i>

43
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:47,769
<i>there would be a second miracle.</i>

44
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:50,939
I don't know.

45
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:14,504
Ren, you should concentrate
on the things you need to do.

46
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:17,590
That's impossible.

47
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:19,884
Hurry up.

48
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:21,052
Don't run.

49
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:29,477
Then…

50
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:33,523
at least give me some excitement.

51
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,026
What?

52
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:44,242
<i>Let me have fun and enjoy</i>
<i>the time I have left.</i>

53
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:49,872
FIRST UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT
KOUZOU OBAYASHI

54
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,974
- WHEN'S YOUR NEXT APPOINTMENT?
- NO NEED TO COME WITH ME

55
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:17,775
<i>He added color once again</i>

56
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:21,738
<i>to my blank ceiling.</i>

57
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:29,495
<i>And by doing that, I was the one</i>

58
00:05:31,372 --> 00:05:33,082
<i>taking away his freedom.</i>

59
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:38,588
<i>He's the most important person in my life…</i>

60
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:42,425
<i>but nevertheless…</i>

61
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:45,154
Chiaki.

62
00:06:47,406 --> 00:06:48,741
Chiaki.

63
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:58,126
Ren.

64
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:05,800
I want to smoke.

65
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:14,642
What are you saying?

66
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:41,961
It smells like you, Ren.

67
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:43,880
Stop sniffing.

68
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:47,091
It's so calming.

69
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:06,444
Chiaki.

70
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:11,157
It tastes so good.

71
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:15,161
Are you okay?

72
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:18,998
Let's go back inside.

73
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:21,626
I…

74
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:27,173
- don't have much longer.
- Stop that.

75
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:29,550
It's the truth.

76
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:45,399
I was told I only have a few months.

77
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:48,236
- Stop it.
- That's why

78
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:52,949
one or two cigarettes
won't make any difference.

79
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:06,087
I was so happy you came back to Japan.

80
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:17,265
But…

81
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:20,643
it's really scary after all.

82
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:29,944
Chiaki.

83
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:42,582
Ren.

84
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:50,840
Be my boyfriend just one more time.

85
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,052
One last time.

86
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:00,725
I want you to see me and only me.

87
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:22,079
Have you heard any updates on Chiaki?

88
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,667
Chiaki

89
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:29,086
was discharged from the hospital.

90
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:33,049
Maybe I pushed her a little too hard.

91
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:36,594
But she looked really healthy.

92
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:39,639
I hope it's nothing serious.

93
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:50,358
Good morning.

94
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:52,735
Chiaki.

95
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:56,405
- Sorry for causing you trouble.
- Are you okay?

96
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:59,784
Sorry for making you worry.

97
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:03,162
Starting tomorrow,
I'll be back to my usual routine.

98
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:07,333
Please don't push yourself too hard.

99
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:10,419
Please make sure to watch over her.

100
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:11,879
Yes.

101
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:15,716
I'll go and talk to the students.

102
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:19,261
Yeah, please do that.

103
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:20,388
Okay.

104
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:24,600
I'm sorry for making you wait.

105
00:11:24,683 --> 00:11:26,936
No, I should be the one apologizing

106
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:30,231
- for taking up your time.
- Not at all.

107
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,402
The truth is, during the training camp,
I asked Ms. Yoshino

108
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:38,239
to show me some pictures of your work.

109
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:45,871
I understand this is not something
to say carelessly,

110
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:49,792
but I don't think your talent
should be buried away.

111
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:53,003
‪What?

112
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:57,842
Won't you please give it another chance?

113
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:06,475
The atelier in Mashiko
has everything you would need, Ms. Kawase.

114
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:08,644
So, you can come right away.

115
00:12:10,729 --> 00:12:12,690
At such a nice place?

116
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,192
It's too far to commute,

117
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:17,903
so you will have to move there.

118
00:12:19,738 --> 00:12:23,325
But I am willing to wait until you're
confident about this, Ms. Kawase.

119
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:24,702
So, I'd be grateful

120
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:28,289
if we could meet occasionally so that
I could explain things in more detail.

121
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:40,092
<i>To him,</i>

122
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,929
<i>the most important person in his life</i>

123
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:47,183
<i>is not me.</i>

124
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:57,985
Hello. Ruki?

125
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,156
<i>If possible, can you come</i>
<i>to Umamiya tomorrow?</i>

126
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:08,871
Sure.

127
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:16,128
- Thank you.
- Take care.

128
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:19,256
Thank you for dropping me off.

129
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,341
Not at all.

130
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:22,259
It's nothing, Ms. Kawase.

131
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,386
- Anything for you.
- Stop that.

132
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:27,348
Oh, please! Stop that.

133
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:30,267
I'm the one who came to ask for a favor.

134
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:32,311
Thank you.

135
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:34,313
- I'll contact you again.
- Okay.

136
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:38,526
I'm back.

137
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:46,867
You were with Mr. Shintaro?

138
00:13:47,826 --> 00:13:51,539
What? Oh, yeah.

139
00:13:56,544 --> 00:14:01,048
He asked me
if I wanted to start working as an artist.

140
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:07,137
Good for you!

141
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:10,516
- I heard you showed him my work, Megu.
- Yeah.

142
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:14,019
I want as many people as possible
to see your work, Saki.

143
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:15,521
Thank you.

144
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:23,654
I wanted to be the person
who liked you the most, Saki.

145
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,661
Don't say "like" so carelessly.

146
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:35,332
Why?

147
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:42,256
I like you…

148
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:49,471
Megu.

149
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:55,102
We're mutual then.

150
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:03,736
Not as a friend.

151
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,280
What?

152
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:18,667
I was asked to move to Mashiko.

153
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,338
I see.

154
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:32,264
I guess this means my dream came true.

155
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:35,100
My dream was for your work
to become known by the world.

156
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:40,230
I haven't made any decisions yet.

157
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:52,201
I'll go buy some ice cream.

158
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:16,684
- Sorry for making you wait.
- Thanks for coming.

159
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:18,686
What is it?

160
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:22,439
There's something I want to show you.

161
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:31,824
Please go inside.

162
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:44,628
Wow.

163
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:55,973
It's beautiful.

164
00:16:58,058 --> 00:17:01,103
I know this is out of character.

165
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:30,174
Miu,

166
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,011
you're the most important person
in my life.

167
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:40,851
Please

168
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:43,645
go out with me.

169
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:20,057
I can't give you an answer right away.

170
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:24,269
But I want

171
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:26,855
to get to know you more, Ruki.

172
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:37,991
Thank you.

173
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:42,704
Thank you.

174
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:50,254
This is cute.

175
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:54,133
This is too good.

176
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:56,468
A hamburger is what you really wanted?

177
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:58,929
It has to be hamburgers.

178
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:01,140
Delicious.

179
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,435
When it comes to crepes,
it has to be sugar butter.

180
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:09,314
The hamburgers got me
expelled from the hospital.

181
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,568
Oh yeah, you're right.

182
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:15,112
We got in so much trouble.

183
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:18,866
But that hamburger was the best.

184
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:21,535
I know for sure this is better.

185
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:23,787
I agree this is good,

186
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:25,664
but the chocolate banana crepe
is more famous.

187
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:27,249
You don't get it at all.

188
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:31,003
The guilty pleasure of eating a hamburger

189
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:33,630
when you're not supposed to
is what makes it taste good.

190
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:36,091
- Really?
- Yeah.

191
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:38,510
I can't agree with that.

192
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,804
It's still on your face.

193
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:48,270
- Here's the new dish I made.
- Wow.

194
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:52,816
It's made with vegetables
freshly harvested in Kamakura.

195
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:56,278
It looks delicious. Thank you.

196
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:02,492
- It's good.
- Really?

197
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:09,124
- How about this?
- Where will you wear that?

198
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,918
The Art Festival.

199
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:14,504
That's nice,

200
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:19,384
- but this suits you more, Chiaki.
- This one?

201
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:24,556
- Sorry about this.
- What's going on?

202
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:28,185
Mr. Suzuki keeps asking me
to send him pictures.

203
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:29,811
Oh, Mr. Suzuki.

204
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:46,453
If you can be born again,
what do you want to be?

205
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:09,810
NEW MENU ITEM IS COMPLETE
APPROVED BY OUR REGULAR CUSTOMER

206
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:21,613
That's not an answer.

207
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:22,614
Forget it.

208
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:24,366
Sorry about this.

209
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:26,618
- What's going on?
- I'll pick expensive sushi.

210
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:28,954
Mr. Suzuki keeps asking me
to send him pictures.

211
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:30,205
Oh, Mr. Suzuki.

212
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:38,255
Ren, how about this?

213
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:21,423
We walked a lot, so you must be tired.

214
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:25,177
Not at all. I had fun.

215
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:09,096
I'm sorry.

216
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:21,775
Being with that person

217
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:25,237
might get you hurt.

218
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:33,286
I know.

219
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:50,137
Then…

220
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:53,515
if he's that important to you,

221
00:23:54,641 --> 00:23:56,643
you'll have to tell him how you feel.

222
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:13,243
Thank you.

223
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:19,457
Come and eat at our place anytime.

224
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:25,755
Thank you.

225
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:33,180
This is so strong.

226
00:24:35,473 --> 00:24:37,851
Because I don't drink often.

227
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:41,021
- I see.
- Yeah.

228
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:43,273
I'm doing something out of character.

229
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:50,322
Are you okay?

230
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,035
What are you thinking about right now?

231
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:05,962
Hey, Chiaki.

232
00:25:06,504 --> 00:25:07,547
You're fired.

233
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:09,966
What?

234
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:14,721
From playing the role of my boyfriend.

235
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:20,727
Thank you for playing pretend
and being my boyfriend.

236
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:32,197
You're important to me, Chiaki.

237
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:38,536
I know that.

238
00:25:46,294 --> 00:25:48,338
But we can't be lovers.

239
00:25:56,012 --> 00:25:57,764
I like someone.

240
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,439
I see.

241
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:11,486
You finally have someone you like, huh?

242
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:23,665
Isn't it pretty painful?

243
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:32,340
I endured it for 17 years.

244
00:26:33,216 --> 00:26:34,884
So, I hope you'll praise me someday.

245
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:52,444
Get off.

246
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:54,779
I'll take you home.

247
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:56,781
You really don't get it.

248
00:26:56,865 --> 00:27:00,493
<i>For anyone heading</i>
<i>to the Kamakura Museum of Literature,</i>

249
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:02,537
<i>please get off at the next stop.</i>

250
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:06,249
If you don't confess your feelings now,
you'll regret it.

251
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:35,904
<i>The most important person in my life…</i>

252
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:40,075
<i>I realized it's you.</i>

253
00:27:51,961 --> 00:27:53,088
Hello.

254
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:55,882
<i>Miu.</i>

255
00:27:59,677 --> 00:28:00,887
I want to see you.

256
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,143
Me too.

257
00:28:10,688 --> 00:28:13,149
I'll wait at that spot
where we took shelter from the rain.

258
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:18,488
Got it.

259
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:53,661
