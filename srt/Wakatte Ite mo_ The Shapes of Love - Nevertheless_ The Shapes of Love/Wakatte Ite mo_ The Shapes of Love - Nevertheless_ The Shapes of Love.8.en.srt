1
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:14,597
Miu.

2
00:00:18,768 --> 00:00:21,271
In my own way, I want to express

3
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,816
the things I got from you
when we were together.

4
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:30,155
I see.

5
00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:34,743
I always

6
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:39,164
wanted you to look my way.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,376
But I won't see you anymore.

8
00:00:47,964 --> 00:00:51,468
Thank you for everything until now.

9
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,638
Bye.

10
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:11,738
<i>I knew that forever</i>

11
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:15,241
<i>didn't exist.</i>

12
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:24,334
<i>I succeeded at everything I did.</i>

13
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:31,508
<i>But still…</i>

14
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:36,763
<i>I can't dance with someone</i>
<i>who's not committed.</i>

15
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:44,437
<i>I couldn't succeed</i>

16
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:48,691
<i>in becoming the most important person</i>
<i>in her life.</i>

17
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,068
I WON'T BE BACK TONIGHT
GET DINNER WITH THIS

18
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:53,988
Chiaki. Let's go back to being friends.

19
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:55,990
<i>I couldn't succeed</i>

20
00:01:57,033 --> 00:02:00,620
<i>in reciprocating feelings</i>
<i>for the person who was always by my side.</i>

21
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:03,373
- You're Kousaka?
- Yeah.

22
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:06,918
Some of us are going out for drinks.
Do you want to come along?

23
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:09,212
<i>Just like butterflies</i>
<i>that flock to flowers,</i>

24
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:11,256
<i>they came as they pleased</i>

25
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,343
<i>and flew away as they pleased.</i>

26
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:18,805
The director from an artist-in-residence
in Germany recommended me,

27
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:21,850
so I will be living and working
in Europe for a while.

28
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:25,687
<i>Gradually, I got used to giving people</i>
<i>what they expected of me.</i>

29
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:30,275
<i>I lost track of my identity.</i>

30
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:36,114
‪Bye.

31
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:46,291
<i>That was when I saw her artwork.</i>

32
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:47,876
WINGS

33
00:02:49,168 --> 00:02:52,005
<i>She had expressed her inner feelings</i>

34
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:54,507
<i>without fear.</i>

35
00:02:58,136 --> 00:02:59,387
<i>That was something</i>

36
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:03,308
<i>I was unable to do.</i>

37
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:10,815
<i>If I'm going to lose everything,</i>

38
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:13,735
<i>I won't hope for anything.</i>

39
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:19,949
FIRST UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT
KOUZOU OBAYASHI

40
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:25,288
<i>That's what…</i>

41
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:26,331
Sorry.

42
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:29,876
<i>…I thought…</i>

43
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:38,718
<i>It felt as though her eyes, full of hope,</i>

44
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:42,764
<i>saw right through me.</i>

45
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:50,813
- Can I sit here?
- What?

46
00:03:53,107 --> 00:03:56,194
Are you going to submit your work
this year at the Art Festival?

47
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:58,655
<i>In this world,</i>
<i>where forever does not exist,</i>

48
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:01,532
<i>she was enduring pain,</i>

49
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:06,829
<i>while desperately searching</i>
<i>for something she desired.</i>

50
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:10,708
<i>Why doesn't your work</i>
<i>have any trace of hesitation?</i>

51
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:13,878
I think they're pieces created by someone
who has never been hurt.

52
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:25,056
Sometimes I just want to knock you down,
Mr. Kousaka.

53
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:27,892
I just want to see an artwork
that reveals Mr. Kousaka's true self.

54
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:30,853
<i>It was as if I was being guided</i>
<i>by a light.</i>

55
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:33,439
<i>Before I knew it,</i>

56
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:35,525
<i>I was searching for her.</i>

57
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,737
<i>In order to prevent the sadness</i>
<i>of losing her,</i>

58
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:43,241
<i>I kept turning my back.</i>

59
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:45,868
Then, what about me?

60
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:48,079
<i>Forever</i>

61
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:51,958
<i>didn't exist</i>

62
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:54,961
<i>after all.</i>

63
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:33,184
Stop touching my stuff.

64
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:36,145
You can't work in this condition.

65
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:39,482
If you have something to say,
just call me.

66
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:42,819
I had to come here
because you wouldn't pick up.

67
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,826
You're such a nuisance.

68
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:56,124
Sorry.

69
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:13,808
I wanted to dance,
even if it meant that you'd hate me.

70
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:18,938
That was the only way
I was able to survive.

71
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:34,078
The more you possess things
that are precious to you,

72
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:37,290
the more you will experience pain.

73
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:42,003
I caused a lot of pain,

74
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:46,132
and I also experienced pain,
but I have no regrets.

75
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:49,969
I see.

76
00:07:57,935 --> 00:08:00,646
I know I have no right to say anything.

77
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:10,823
But don't go on living looking as if
you've given up on everything.

78
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:12,700
It's pathetic.

79
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:18,331
What the hell?

80
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:25,755
If you have nothing to believe in,

81
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:28,758
then at least live as you please.

82
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,358
I'll be off now.

83
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:08,881
<i>She has been and always will be</i>

84
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:11,592
<i>a selfish person.</i>

85
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:19,684
<i>But no matter how badly she got hurt,</i>

86
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:23,980
<i>she never took her eyes</i>
<i>off of what she desired.</i>

87
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,211
You're over the age limit.

88
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:53,551
This place hasn't changed at all.

89
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:55,845
I have no money to make any changes,
that's all.

90
00:09:58,347 --> 00:10:01,183
A child's ability to concentrate
is impressive.

91
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,605
You looked like that when you were young.

92
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,155
- By the way…
- What?

93
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:16,741
What's with this?

94
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:18,284
Can you take it down?

95
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:22,747
It's to advertise how we produced
Ren Kousaka.

96
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,665
You're so sly.

97
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:28,586
I guess a great artist like yourself
won't understand.

98
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:39,472
If you have something to say, just say it.

99
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:47,688
Your techniques have leveled up,
and you're highly valued,

100
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:49,607
so I think that's really amazing.

101
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:52,068
But…

102
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:55,780
you're not one-of-a-kind.

103
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:02,161
I already know that.

104
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:05,039
Why can't you create things anymore?

105
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:09,877
I was empty to begin with,
so I think my true nature is coming out--

106
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,588
No, you were impudent and shameless
to begin with.

107
00:11:12,671 --> 00:11:15,591
Since when are you putting up a front,
trying to act cool?

108
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:23,057
You're not the only one hurt and in pain.

109
00:11:38,697 --> 00:11:41,075
For what purpose am I making things,

110
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:46,205
and for what purpose am I living?
I have absolutely no idea.

111
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:49,417
I see.

112
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:55,798
Even if I hold out hope,

113
00:11:58,175 --> 00:12:00,010
it'll disappear someday.

114
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:09,770
But…

115
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:16,110
I wanted her to keep on living.

116
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:29,373
You know, I actually had a kid.

117
00:12:30,749 --> 00:12:33,878
It died before it was even born.
But because of that,

118
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:36,005
my wife and I parted ways,

119
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:40,843
and I burned all of the work
I had done until then.

120
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:46,807
But why do you think

121
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:51,145
I'm still making small artworks like this?

122
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:58,611
Creating things

123
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:01,071
is the desire to embody
the feelings of the moment

124
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:03,991
and maintain it forever.

125
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:08,287
Everything will disappear one day.

126
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:12,416
But the desire to hold onto them forever

127
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:16,295
won't ever subside,
as long as you are alive.

128
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:24,303
You still have that desire, right?

129
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:51,080
He's leaving now.

130
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:54,166
- Bye.
- Bye.

131
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,377
- Bye.
- Bye.

132
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:58,045
See you.

133
00:14:54,768 --> 00:14:56,562
<i>I lived my life</i>

134
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,608
<i>avoiding the pain that comes with a loss.</i>

135
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:12,661
<i>I decided not to turn my back</i>
<i>on what I desire…</i>

136
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:16,832
‪Cheers! -Araki, Yagihashi, Shindo!

137
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,334
<i>and even if I am to get hurt,</i>

138
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:21,629
<i>I want to be with someone.</i>

139
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:23,964
‪You two are so close.

140
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:26,133
‪No, we're not.

141
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:30,137
<i>I felt that way</i><i>for the first time.</i>

142
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:35,059
- The moon is beautiful.
- Yeah.

143
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:11,261
It's nice.

144
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,016
How long have you been there?

145
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:23,983
It's beautiful.

146
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:32,324
This is how you appear in my eyes,
Mr. Kousaka.

147
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:37,705
What?

148
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:40,457
Hold on.

149
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,960
Mr. Kousaka?

150
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:47,047
- Mr. Kousaka.
- Hey.

151
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:49,174
It's Kamakura Banksy.

152
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:52,761
- I thought he had disappeared.
- You went all out.

153
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:56,015
It's better to make a comeback
with a bang.

154
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:58,183
I brought alcohol.

155
00:16:58,267 --> 00:16:59,560
You were back here?

156
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:03,022
I'm going back again.
I just came today to drop her off.

157
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:05,190
You're the one that said
you wanted to come, Saki.

158
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:07,401
Is that right?

159
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:09,570
I'm glad everyone is doing well.

160
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:13,490
Right back at you.

161
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,246
This is nice.

162
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:23,000
Can I ask one question?

163
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:32,885
What's going through your mind
as you live your life?

164
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,513
Were you the type to ask these questions?

165
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,558
- Let's start with Sou.
- Why me?

166
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:42,019
- Hurry.
- Hurry up.

167
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,068
I…

168
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:53,280
don't have a special talent
like Mr. Kousaka.

169
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,831
- <i>I know that I'm not special…</i>
- I like you!

170
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:06,251
<i>but nevertheless…</i>

171
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:19,014
Stop being so jealous.

172
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,933
<i>I want to cherish you…</i>

173
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:24,103
<i>but nevertheless…</i>

174
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:32,444
I like you.

175
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:36,698
<i>I want to be by your side…</i>

176
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:40,035
<i>but nevertheless…</i>

177
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:52,631
<i>He's the most important person in my life…</i>

178
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:55,384
<i>but nevertheless…</i>

179
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:05,185
<i>I know I'm empty…</i>

180
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,313
<i>but nevertheless…</i>

181
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,950
<i>I know I shouldn't take a step forward…</i>

182
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:23,370
<i>but nevertheless…</i>

183
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:30,836
And?

184
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,088
What about you, Mr. Kousaka?

185
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:50,522
<i>I know I'll get hurt…</i>

186
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:55,903
<i>but nevertheless…</i>

187
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:01,783
<i>But even then…</i>

188
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:21,803
Are you struggling?

189
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:31,897
Why are you here?

190
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:41,406
What kind of structure are you going with?

191
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:52,125
I won't bother you again.

192
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:55,837
Just let me help.

193
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:07,099
Stick this part together with metal,
and it'll become stable.

194
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:08,976
What about this visible part?

195
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:10,978
- <i>I thought he was someone extraordinary,</i>
- It'll be fine as long as you

196
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:11,895
cut this part off in the end.

197
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:13,855
- <i>but he was someone who lived life</i>
- The key is

198
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,983
- <i>trying to avoid getting hurt.</i>
- to insert it vertically.

199
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:20,362
<i>She never lost hope,</i>
<i>even after she got hurt.</i>

200
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:23,865
- <i>She was a courageous person.</i>
- Don't press too hard. Take it slow.

201
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,200
‪Okay.

202
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:28,120
<i>This moment together felt endless…</i>

203
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:32,207
<i>and yet it felt as though</i>
<i>it was too short.</i>

204
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:36,420
<i>I wanted this moment to last forever.</i>

205
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:39,923
- I'll hold onto this, so you align it.
- Okay.

206
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:46,263
<i>Forever doesn't exist.</i>

207
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:50,934
<i>That's why…</i>

208
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,855
<i>I want to embody the pain we endured…</i>

209
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:58,775
<i>and our lives at this very moment…</i>

210
00:22:00,902 --> 00:22:02,195
<i>Into something tangible.</i>

211
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:14,666
I'll be going now.

212
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:22,591
Thank you.

213
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:27,179
Me too.

214
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:28,972
Thank you.

215
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:34,102
When are you leaving?

216
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:38,106
I'm planning to go as soon as possible.

217
00:22:40,817 --> 00:22:41,777
I see.

218
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:50,619
Thank you for everything.

219
00:22:55,373 --> 00:22:56,833
Thank you for everything.

220
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:13,433
I'll head back now.

221
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:20,273
Okay.

223
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:43,768
‪Give it back.

224
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:48,189
That's my line.

225
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:10,837
Miu,

226
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:14,841
I like you.

227
00:27:21,514 --> 00:27:22,474
Ren.

228
00:27:26,102 --> 00:27:28,313
I know that forever doesn't exist.

229
00:27:34,944 --> 00:27:36,321
But I still

230
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:41,951
like you, Miu.

231
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:49,876
Yeah.

232
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:53,880
I…

233
00:27:57,217 --> 00:27:58,718
like you too, Ren.

234
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:11,106
You won't regret it?

235
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:18,071
Of course I will.

236
00:28:36,631 --> 00:28:38,633
<i>I shouldn't hold out hope…</i>

237
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:40,510
<i>Forever doesn't exist…</i>

238
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:44,514
<i>But nevertheless…</i>
