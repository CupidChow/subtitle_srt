1
00:00:14,931 --> 00:00:16,224
Chiaki.

2
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:24,566
Um…

3
00:00:47,922 --> 00:00:49,257
Miu.

4
00:00:49,924 --> 00:00:51,259
Hey.

5
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:54,345
Didn't expect to see you
walking around here.

6
00:00:55,972 --> 00:00:57,057
Yeah, I guess.

7
00:00:58,516 --> 00:01:00,518
Oh, is this about Mr. Kousaka?

8
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:04,189
What are you talking about?

9
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:07,442
Did you fall for him?

10
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:12,405
Don't drink too much, and go home.

11
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,408
Bye.

12
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:24,501
That path is tough to handle.

13
00:01:26,127 --> 00:01:28,046
I already know.

14
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:38,890
I was never good with farewells
to begin with.

15
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:45,563
I couldn't even throw away
my old, tattered shoes.

16
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:57,242
Coming.

17
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:58,535
‪Hey.

18
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:00,578
- Hey, Tetsuo.
- I was drinking nearby.

19
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:01,746
Come in.

20
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:04,958
Neither of us meant anything special
to each other.

21
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:06,417
- Can I stay the night?
- Yeah.

22
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:13,216
You can stay, but we can't do it tonight.
I'm sorry.

23
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:14,342
What?

24
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:17,053
Are you serious?

25
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,138
- Yeah.
- What should I do?

26
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:21,766
Call me some other time.

27
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:25,103
That's why there were no breakups
to begin with.

28
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:27,105
Okay. Bye.

29
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:29,274
Hey.

30
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:33,862
Don't you get bored
of making statues of Buddha?

31
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:35,738
Before I knew it,

32
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:40,243
I couldn't remember what it felt like
to like someone.

33
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:45,039
Upon closer look,
you're pretty good looking, Osakabe.

34
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:49,127
By never getting serious with anyone,

35
00:02:50,795 --> 00:02:52,505
I protected myself.

36
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:53,715
I like you.

37
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:56,384
I want to go out with you.

38
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:58,928
Just keep that in mind.

39
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:03,308
The truth is, I want to cherish you…

40
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:06,352
but nevertheless…

41
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:10,458
CAN I GO SEE YOU RIGHT NOW?

42
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,019
Hello?

43
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:32,814
Okay.

44
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,067
Sorry.

45
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:40,029
EXHIBITION IN SPAIN
BY REN KOUSAKA AND CHIAKI IMAI

46
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:41,489
Um…

47
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:01,134
Hello.

48
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:04,637
Sorry. She's my childhood friend.

49
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:07,974
She came back
after being away for a long time.

50
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,520
Let's meet tonight.

51
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,442
Do you have time?

52
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:19,152
No.

53
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:22,905
But…

54
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:26,868
- yes.
- Which is it?

55
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:29,037
Depends on why we're meeting.

56
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,332
I have a work-related favor.

57
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:35,752
What is it?

58
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:05,907
Thanks for coming.

59
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:11,162
Thanks for helping me out, Ms. Hamasaki.

60
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:14,957
Come in, Mr. Kousaka.

61
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:31,516
Can't you sketch a human body
without any model?

62
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:39,440
I can draw my own hands and feet.

63
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:46,239
But capturing a woman's delicate foot

64
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:48,533
requires practice.

65
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:55,414
Do you do this to people
who aren't your girlfriend?

66
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:01,379
Is there any meaning
to making things official by going out?

67
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:05,216
There's plenty of meaning to it.

68
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:11,806
Stop it.

69
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:27,613
I just want to stay with you like this.

70
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:35,181
Stop it.

71
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:15,388
Hello.

72
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:19,600
What is it?

73
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:23,396
Okay.

74
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:26,065
Don't overdo it.

75
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:32,905
Bye.

76
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:44,125
I thought I was able to become
his special someone.

77
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:50,840
But…

78
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:54,468
I'm just one of the many butterflies.

79
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:07,148
We received a request from the students.

80
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,316
Request for what?

81
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,234
Regarding Mr. Kousaka's special lecture.

82
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:12,612
- Are you serious?
- They want him to do another one.

83
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:15,114
They just want to stare at his face.

84
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:18,284
- But he's a good teacher.
- Yeah.

85
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:22,580
I wonder if there's anything
he's not good at.

86
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:25,666
- Maybe he's a horrible singer.
- Stop it.

87
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,460
- Miu.
- What?

88
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:29,503
Enemy on our radar.

89
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:31,464
- What?
- Over there.

90
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,592
‪-It's a little short.
‪-Yeah, the neck is short.

91
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:37,887
‪-It's hard to tell what it is.
‪-You should make it longer.

92
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,097
‪I can't tell what it is.

93
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,141
Hey.

94
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:47,063
Mr. Kousaka, you can't bring a girl
and shatter our dreams.

95
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:50,066
This is Chiaki Imai. She's a curator.

96
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:53,944
She'll be helping out the Art Festival
this year.

97
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:58,282
Nice to meet you. I'm Chiaki Imai.
Looking forward to working with you.

98
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:03,579
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

99
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:19,428
You're Ms. Hamasaki, right?

100
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:21,847
Yes.

101
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:25,184
I'm sorry I wasn't able to formally
introduce myself earlier.

102
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:28,687
I will be participating
in the upcoming Art Festival.

103
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:30,272
I'm Chiaki Imai.

104
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:36,195
Um…

105
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:38,364
- You and Mr. Kousaka--
- Chiaki.

106
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:42,034
- Stop wandering off on your own.
- Sorry.

107
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:46,080
- I'll take you home.
- No, I'll walk home.

108
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:48,082
I can't let you do that.

109
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:52,128
Then I'll accept your offer.

110
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,672
Sorry for disturbing you.

111
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:58,467
Not at all. Thank you for your hard work.

112
00:11:58,551 --> 00:11:59,885
You too.

113
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:28,038
- Excuse me. Can I have some rice?
- Sure.

114
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:30,708
Oh.

115
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:34,253
Hey.

116
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:36,046
Hey.

117
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:41,093
- What?
- Tetsuo?

118
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:42,887
Why are you here?

119
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:53,189
Why did we stop meeting up?

120
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:56,984
I don't think there was
a particular reason.

121
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:01,155
It all worked out in the end.

122
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:05,326
I don't remember anything we talked about.

123
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,205
I don't think we were ever
that interested in each other.

124
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:20,007
How's it going lately?

125
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,510
What are you up to?

126
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:23,844
Lately?

127
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:28,599
What?

128
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,434
Well…

129
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:33,479
Someone told me straight out

130
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:37,024
that he likes me,
and I'm troubled by that.

131
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:40,653
Why are you troubled by that? Why?

132
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:43,113
Have you ever told someone
straight out that you like them?

133
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:47,660
Well…

134
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:49,870
probably not.

135
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:51,622
- Thought so.
- Yeah.

136
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:53,499
- Me neither.
- Thought so.

137
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:04,051
What?

138
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:06,095
- What is it?
- Nothing.

139
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:09,014
- I just remembered something.
- What?

140
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:16,647
He's the really overwhelming type.

141
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:27,032
Someone overwhelming
is perfect for people like us.

142
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:38,252
- You might be right.
- Yes, I am.

143
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:26,133
Thank you.

144
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:29,762
- Welcome.
- Mr. Suzuki.

145
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:32,973
- The three of you are such good friends.
- Aren't we?

146
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:35,935
Welcome. Hi.

147
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:37,853
- Three, please.
- Table for three.

148
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,272
- Oh, it's that trio.
- Hey.

149
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:42,107
- Hey.
- There they are.

150
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:43,192
Welcome.

151
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:46,195
- Hello.
- Hey there.

152
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:49,239
Would you like to join us?

153
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,743
- Yeah, let's.
- Let's all eat together.

154
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:54,495
‪Thank you.

155
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:55,412
‪LUNCH MENU

156
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:58,165
By the way, there's a new piece
by Kamakura Banksy.

157
00:15:58,248 --> 00:15:59,208
Really?

158
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,501
- I saw it too.
- You did?

159
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:01,877
- When will they get caught?
- Yeah.

160
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,337
The culprit's pretty persistent.

161
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,880
What's Kamakura Banksy?

162
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:09,426
Lately, an unknown artist is leaving
street art around this area.

163
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:10,928
Yeah, like this.

164
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:13,180
I like this one.

165
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:14,807
I don't want to accept this as art.

166
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:17,393
- There's this one too.
- They're great artwork.

167
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,770
- This is the new one from this morning.
- This one?

168
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:21,897
It's rare to find cynical artwork
in Japan.

169
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,024
- Yeah.
- I agree.

170
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:25,943
- It's pretty.
- Yeah, it really is.

171
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:27,945
There's a fan club on Instagram.

172
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:29,363
Are you serious? Unbelievable.

173
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:31,365
It's that amazing, huh?

174
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:32,700
I bet you this artist is crazy.

175
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:34,576
- The crazy ones are the hottest.
- No way.

176
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,829
I wonder.

177
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:39,540
But the police have opened up
an investigation on this.

178
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:43,127
I can't understand anyone who would
ruin their lives for something like this.

179
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:47,673
Good work.

180
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:49,758
You too.

181
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:55,973
Chiaki is fast becoming a popular figure.

182
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:58,392
She treated all of the students
to a meal just now.

183
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:00,811
I see.

184
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:09,653
Um…

185
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:11,447
Can I ask you one question?

186
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:21,707
What did you want to talk about?

187
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:30,174
You're Kamakura Banksy, aren't you?

188
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:35,054
Yesterday's Banksy artwork

189
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:37,848
was done by you, right?

190
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:47,941
It is.

191
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:57,326
I did it.

192
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,298
How did you find out?

193
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:15,260
I found out by looking at the shoes
in this artwork.

194
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:22,142
I told you about how I couldn't
throw away my favorite shoes.

195
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:23,936
You remembered that story.

196
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:29,233
Why did you think it was me?

197
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:33,904
Because it reminded me of a butterfly.

198
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,824
- This is the new one from this morning.
- This one?

199
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:38,700
- Yeah.
- Wow.

200
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,536
I thought it was Mr. Kousaka.

201
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:45,082
You seemed to be the type
that hates this kind of stuff.

202
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:49,586
It's too direct.

203
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:12,526
If you're going to do it,
draw something better.

204
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:21,118
Hey.

205
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:28,917
Why are you doing this?

206
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:42,139
It was half admiration toward Mr. Kousaka…

207
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:46,059
Hey! What are you doing? Stop right there.

208
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:47,227
…and the rest is…

209
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:49,354
- Do you know about Kamakura Banksy?
- What is that?

210
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:50,314
Let me show you.

211
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:52,900
It was a statement
to express my existence.

212
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:00,073
It's a turn off, isn't it?

213
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,994
I'm actually relieved.

214
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:10,709
To know that a part of you
is a little jaded.

215
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:25,974
I don't know much about
relationships and stuff,

216
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:33,857
but I might want to give
this relationship thing a try.

217
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:02,302
You're so warm.

218
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:20,904
Let's do this, boyfriend.

219
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:24,408
Don't call your boyfriend
by the third person.

220
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:26,118
Nice comeback.

221
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,752
Why did you do it?

222
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:45,220
Why did you splash paint on the statue?

223
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:55,439
I wanted to show that to someone.

224
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:01,486
Yesterday's drawing was done by you,
right, Ren?

225
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:06,074
Why…

226
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:08,452
did you do it?

227
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:33,810
Because I wanted to draw.

228
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:50,827
Is there a need to express your talent
in this manner?

229
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:56,875
What do you mean by "in this manner"?

230
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:01,630
I believe that Mr. Kousaka

231
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:03,590
can throw his hat into the ring

232
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:06,718
and play fair and square
without breaking any rules.

233
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:12,307
Ms. Hamasaki,

234
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:15,268
you're striving to be an artist, right?

235
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:16,937
What?

236
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:21,358
Isn't it restricting to live
within set boundaries?

237
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:25,403
I…

238
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:28,949
don't think art is only about
pushing beyond the boundaries.

239
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:30,992
I don't want you to tell me

240
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:33,286
about our world of art
with such a narrow-minded view.

241
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:34,329
Chiaki.

242
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:37,415
Ms. Hamasaki,
you can afford to think that way.

243
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:42,087
I…

244
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:47,175
just want to see an artwork
that reveals Mr. Kousaka's true self.

245
00:23:53,306 --> 00:23:54,808
What do you think, Ren?

246
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:11,283
I'll be going now.

247
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:25,172
I should've known from the very beginning,

248
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:28,466
but I held onto expectations

249
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:30,886
and got hurt all on my own.

250
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:32,846
I'm an idiot.

251
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:36,474
Miu.

252
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:49,487
Don't go.

253
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,686
Hey there.

254
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:28,151
At times like this,

255
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:33,281
people can't help but look for comfort
in other people's kindness.

256
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:01,971
