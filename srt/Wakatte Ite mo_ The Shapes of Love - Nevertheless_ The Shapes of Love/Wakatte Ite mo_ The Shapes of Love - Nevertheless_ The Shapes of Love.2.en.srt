1
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:12,220
Coming.

2
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:10,737
Hello.

3
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:13,948
Miu. We have an emergency meeting today.
You coming?

4
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:15,366
Oh.

5
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:18,078
Oh crap. Thanks for calling.

6
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:30,715
I can't ever tell anyone
about the dream I had today.

7
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:50,610
Sorry.

8
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,202
Hello.

9
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:02,956
Oh.

10
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:09,379
When?

11
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:15,927
To him,

12
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:18,930
I'm not someone special…

13
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:23,059
I know…

14
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:27,564
that I'm not someone special.

15
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:33,570
I was scared of how people's hearts
keep on changing.

16
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:36,906
I wanted something that wouldn't change,

17
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:40,243
so I started carving wood.

18
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:42,996
Excuse me.

19
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:46,332
I don't need any superficial familiarity.

20
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:51,963
I was fine as long as I was able
to face myself.

21
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:57,176
Or so I thought…

22
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,511
Good morning.

23
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:01,389
Good morning.

24
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:04,851
Seeing her smiling face…

25
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:08,980
stirred something in my heart.

26
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:12,525
I'm

27
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:16,029
not a special existence in her life.

28
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:18,156
- Do you know about Kamakura Banksy?
- What?

29
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,199
You don't? Let me show you.

30
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:27,290
Even as an artist,

31
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:30,627
I was nobody special.

32
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,675
The more I admire people,

33
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:38,593
‪THE GENIUS "REN KOUSAKA"

34
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:40,178
the more I get hurt.

35
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:46,059
That's why I'm, once again,
emptying my mind and carving wood.

36
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:10,166
I know I'm not special…

37
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,128
but nevertheless…

38
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:21,362
Oh, look.

39
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:23,573
- It's Mr. Kousaka.
- You're right.

40
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,455
Was that a woman in his car?

41
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:31,956
- She was pretty.
- Yeah.

42
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,499
- What?
- What's going on?

43
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,001
I don't know who she is.

44
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:39,213
The statue incident
that occurred the other day…

45
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:42,383
I'm sorry.

46
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:46,846
…and the culprit behind

47
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:49,140
the "Kamakura Banksy"
that's gaining attention online

48
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:54,145
might be the same person.
Or so the police have informed us.

49
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:57,398
There's a chance
that it might be one of our students,

50
00:05:57,482 --> 00:06:00,526
so we will try to gather information

51
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,653
as we conduct the interviews.

52
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:06,783
Now, onto the main topic.

53
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:11,245
Mr. Kousaka, were you aware

54
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:14,707
of the artworks by Kamakura Banksy?

55
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:18,544
I'm aware of it since
the students showed it to me.

56
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:22,715
Do you have any idea of who it might be?

57
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:27,470
I'm the one who drew the mural
and splashed paint on the statue.

58
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:30,640
What do you mean?

59
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:35,603
I didn't think that statue belonged here.

60
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:38,064
You committed a crime.

61
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:43,069
This university president exploited
so many people for his work.

62
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:44,737
You're aware of that, right, Ms. Usami?

63
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:50,743
That issue has nothing to do with this.

64
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:53,162
I didn't do the other stuff, though.

65
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:57,875
I don't draw this kind of childish,
extrapunitive art.

66
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:03,631
Ms. Hamasaki, you were at the scene
when this happened, right?

67
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:08,553
- Um…
- I made sure my face was hidden.

68
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:12,515
- Yes.
- Excuse me.

69
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:14,725
There's a fire in the courtyard.

70
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:15,852
Fire?

71
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:19,605
‪It's burning.

72
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,190
- Move that.
- Stand back.

73
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:26,028
What happened?

74
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:28,531
- Hikari's artwork burned down.
- Sorry.

75
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:34,620
- Are you okay?
- I hadn't done welding in a long time.

76
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:35,746
- Sorry.
- Let's go to the infirmary.

77
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:40,168
Hikari, you okay?

78
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:41,961
She has minor burns.
Can you report it and clean up here?

79
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:43,171
Okay.

80
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:45,465
- Be careful of the glass.
- You okay?

81
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:54,432
Give me your hand.

82
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:57,310
Are you sure it's okay?

83
00:07:57,393 --> 00:07:58,394
What do you mean?

84
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:01,814
For keeping you to myself.

85
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,192
This is no time for jokes.

86
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:08,362
Oh, I saw you this morning.

87
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:09,572
You should've said something.

88
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:13,159
The lady next to you was beautiful.

89
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:15,870
I see.

90
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:17,914
On the other hand,

91
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:21,334
you care about Miu, don't you?

92
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:25,463
Hold onto that.

93
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:29,300
There. All done.

94
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:31,969
Thank you.

95
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:37,266
Mr. Kousaka,

96
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,603
we're cut from the same cloth.

97
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:44,982
Ms. Shiina…

98
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:46,400
Call me Hikari.

99
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:57,036
If you label yourself as something,
it'll just restrict you.

100
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:06,587
Osakabe?

101
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:19,600
Oh, Miu.

102
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:20,851
Are you all right?

103
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:23,521
Look, he treated my wound.

104
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:26,774
You can't do anything until you write
an apology letter, okay?

105
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,528
I'm sorry. Yes, will do.

106
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:32,905
- Thank you.
- Sure.

107
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:48,045
Why did you voluntarily confess
to the paint incident?

108
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:52,883
Because it seemed like
keeping that secret was bothering you.

109
00:09:57,763 --> 00:10:00,224
What will you do if you get charged?

110
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:03,102
Then you won't be able to stay here,
and other workplaces won't--

111
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:18,534
I can't…

112
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,705
get drawn into his eyes.

113
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:34,133
You're injured.

114
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:54,278
I can tend to it myself.

115
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,199
Okay. Here you go.

116
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:01,452
Thank you.

117
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:22,473
There's something going on
between Miu and Mr. Kousaka.

118
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:29,230
You get injured because you're thinking
about dumb things like that.

119
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:31,148
Are you mad or something?

120
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:34,693
You're grumpier than usual.

121
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:35,945
Not really.

122
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,330
Oh, I found a match.

123
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:51,210
You never learn, do you?

124
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:56,006
Look at this.

125
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:59,593
In his introduction, he wrote how
many years he was going out with his ex.

126
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:00,803
What is he trying to prove?

127
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:05,015
Stop talking about immoral things
in front of Buddha.

128
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:07,435
What? Immoral?

129
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:10,855
I've never heard that word being used in
normal conversation.

130
00:12:10,938 --> 00:12:12,982
You need to get some.

131
00:12:18,737 --> 00:12:19,697
Hey.

132
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:24,201
Don't you get bored
of making statues of Buddha?

133
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:31,750
The thought of "getting bored"
is ridiculous to begin with.

134
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:34,211
Because the interactions I have
with myself will never end.

135
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:39,133
Are you going to become a monk?

136
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:43,262
That's better than living a life
controlled by lust.

137
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:07,286
I don't think you'll look good
with a bald head.

138
00:13:07,786 --> 00:13:09,538
You should give up on being a monk.

139
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,461
I'm leaving now. I can't concentrate.

140
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:18,297
What? Why? Let's go together.

141
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:20,633
You need to work on your art.

142
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:22,134
You won't make it in time
for the festival.

143
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:37,608
How boring.

144
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:58,504
His artwork…

145
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:02,341
His gaze…

146
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:05,928
lacks hesitation.

147
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:09,306
And? You ended up staying overnight?

148
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:12,726
Apparently, he doesn't believe
in relationships, but he was good looking,

149
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:13,727
so I okayed it.

150
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:17,314
A guy like that is perfect
just for having fun.

151
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:18,357
You can't get serious.

152
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:21,402
Someone who has

153
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:25,614
lived his whole life
thinking he is special.

154
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:28,993
Someone who has been living

155
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:31,662
in a completely different world from me.

156
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:33,080
‪EXHIBITION IN SPAIN BY
‪REN KOUSAKA X CHIAKI IMAI

157
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:34,748
But…

158
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:38,127
there's loneliness in his eyes.

159
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:44,884
How does the world appear in his eyes?

160
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:51,223
‪WHITEBAIT AND LETTUCE
‪JAPANESE STYLE FRIED RICE

161
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:54,184
A heart emoji? You're so cute, Suzuki.

162
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:55,394
Right?

163
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,439
It feels great to receive
this kind of feedback.

164
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:03,569
It catches your eye, huh?

165
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:05,946
But don't get too excited
and press "like".

166
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,908
They'll get a notification that you
liked it. It'll come across as pushy.

167
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:10,326
I wasn't asking for advice.

168
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:13,495
Good evening.

169
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:14,872
Good evening.

170
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:16,916
Welcome.

171
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:18,751
Did we get here too early?

172
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:20,544
Not at all.

173
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:23,631
I'm so glad.

174
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:24,924
Come in.

175
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:27,509
I'm pretty sure it's Mr. Kousaka.

176
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:29,094
These artworks started appearing

177
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:31,680
in Kamakura right around
the time he came back here.

178
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:34,934
But this artwork has a different vibe
from Mr. Kousaka's usual pieces.

179
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:39,063
After all that he's accomplished,
would he do something this risky?

180
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:41,231
You'll understand if you see him, Saki.

181
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:42,858
He's pretty crazy.

182
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,443
Yeah, I wouldn't rule him out.

183
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:47,237
And he seems to be taken with you,
but what do you think, Miu?

184
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:48,989
- What?
- What?

185
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:51,408
Stop making it sound like that.

186
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:55,829
I don't think it's him.

187
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:57,581
Why don't you think it's him?

188
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:59,750
Well, it's just a feeling, but…

189
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:03,921
All right, let's plan a drinking party
at his house and investigate.

190
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:08,175
- Good idea!
- Miu, you're curious about his life too.

191
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:10,260
No, I am not.

192
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:14,139
Liar! You look really curious.

193
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:16,350
- Yes, you do.
- No, I am not.

194
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:18,519
Here's the stewed fish.

195
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:21,188
- Wow.
- That looks delicious.

196
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:22,898
Wow.

197
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,025
I'll take the empty cups.

198
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:26,652
Thank you.

199
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:33,575
Personally, if there are only two men left
in this world, I'll choose Ruki.

200
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:38,622
- Now that's a hot topic to discuss.
- Sorry we're late.

201
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,166
Just as we were talking about him.

202
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:46,005
We were just talking about
going to your house.

203
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:48,298
I don't invite people over much.

204
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:50,968
- Even your girlfriend?
- You prefer her place instead?

205
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:55,347
Nice to meet you. I'm Kawase.

206
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:57,474
Nice to meet you. I'm Kousaka.

207
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:02,563
- No way!
- I'm serious. I buy short-sleeves too.

208
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:03,647
‪No way!

209
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:07,901
It's time to ask Mr. Kousaka
some questions.

210
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:09,653
We'll write our questions down,

211
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:12,156
so you have to answer
whichever one you pick out.

212
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:13,532
- What?
- I have to answer?

213
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:14,658
Yes, you have to.

214
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:15,826
More importantly,

215
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:20,831
may I ask how one can become
a great artist?

216
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:23,459
- Why all of a sudden?
- Stop with those boring questions.

217
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:27,421
How do you define "great"?

218
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:29,798
To stand the test of time.

219
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:36,096
I wonder if forever exists.

220
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,352
Well, that's…

221
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:44,897
Of course, it exists.

222
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,482
- It does?
- Yes, one can dream.

223
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:49,109
- Forever doesn't apply to you, Hikari.
- Hey.

224
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:51,862
Here's your refill.

225
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:53,489
- I want beer.
- Beer. Okay.

226
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:55,908
- I want a highball, please.
- Okay, highball.

227
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:57,451
Me too, please.

228
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:00,704
I think I'll head back soon and work.

229
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:03,749
- What? Really?
- You're boring as always.

230
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:05,709
Megu, you have to work
on your project too.

231
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:08,378
I don't like to worry about the future.

232
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:10,255
- That's so you.
- That's dangerous.

233
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:13,133
Well, I'll go now in search of forever.

234
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:14,968
- Be safe, Miu.
- Yeah.

235
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:17,387
- Bye.
- Be careful.

236
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:20,474
- On to the second round?
- Shall we?

237
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:22,434
- Mr. Kousaka?
- Yes?

238
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:26,063
Are you the Kamakura Banksy
that everyone is talking about?

239
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:35,322
Let's drink.

240
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:40,077
Hey, let's talk about something more fun.

241
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:08,313
Walk straight.

242
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:10,190
Hikari, be careful.

243
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:12,901
Watch it, you two.

244
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,528
Hey, be careful.

245
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:17,281
- We're this way. See you.
- Huh? Oh, right…

246
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:19,199
- Bye.
- Bye.

247
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:21,785
Thank you.

248
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:25,330
Watch out.

249
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:29,626
I wanted Mr. Kousaka to take me home.

250
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,045
Sorry you're stuck with me.

251
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,010
Hey.

252
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:47,477
Are you serious? Come on.

253
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,614
You want me to get some water?

254
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:17,341
Upon closer look,
you're pretty good looking, Osakabe.

255
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:34,942
- What brings you here?
- You're working hard.

256
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,158
Here you go.

257
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:45,244
No, thanks.

258
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:50,749
I'll leave it here.

259
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:56,004
- You're observant.
- You didn't eat anything.

260
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:12,145
What do you see, Ms. Hamasaki?

261
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:24,950
Why doesn't your work
have any trace of hesitation?

262
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:29,538
Is that how it comes across?

263
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:36,086
I think they're pieces created
by someone who has never been hurt.

264
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:41,758
Is that right?

265
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,426
I know that I'm not special…

266
00:22:25,552 --> 00:22:26,970
but nevertheless…

267
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:35,979
I still want to reach deeper into
his heart.

268
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:30,158
I know I'm not special…

269
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:33,662
but nevertheless…

270
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:55,929
