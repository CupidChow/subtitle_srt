1
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,400
The Moon Goddess has arrived.

2
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,480
Begin the ritual.

3
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,400
What?

4
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,840
How could this happen?

5
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,840
Xu Qiniang.

6
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:12,960
Madam Qiu.

7
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,880
I should be asking you that.

8
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:15,960
What did you say?

9
00:01:16,039 --> 00:01:17,840
I helped you to save my father.

10
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,440
But where is my father now?

11
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,760
Your father?

12
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,210
After all I've done for you,

13
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,920
you actually killed him.

14
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,640
We're going to change into beautiful clothes.

15
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,120
Miss Yu.

16
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,440
Miss Yu.

17
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,530
Miss Yu, wake up.

18
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,440
Miss Yu,

19
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,250
don't go there! Wake up!

20
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,440
Miss Yu is fine.

21
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:40,020
Her body is just temporarily possessed.

22
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,840
Temporarily possessed?

23
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,650
When the ritual begins,

24
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,000
will she still be alive?

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,800
Miss Xu.

26
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:49,900
Why are you aiding these villains

27
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,400
in harming innocent lives?

28
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,200
I didn't.

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,320
Officer, I didn't.

30
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,520
I only preserved those bodies

31
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,479
and reassembled them.

32
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:58,600
I didn't kill those people.

33
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,600
But do you realize

34
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,280
those bodies

35
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,440
were all brutally murdered by them?

36
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,920
How are you any different from an accomplice?

37
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,600
But I was only trying to save my father.

38
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,000
I had no choice.

39
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,880
When I recited your father's rhyme

40
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,140
and saw your reaction,

41
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,840
I knew you were a filial daughter.

42
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,840
But do you know

43
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,930
Madam Qiu has deceived you?

44
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,000
You're desperate to save your father,

45
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,040
but Madam Qiu

46
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,180
treats his life as worthless.

47
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,200
Officer, what do you mean?

48
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:30,740
Your father has already been killed by Xiang Qi.

49
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,530
That's impossible.

50
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,040
She promised me.

51
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,690
Don't be deceived by them anymore.

52
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,579
Look at what they've done.

53
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,290
Look at those bodies you turned into puppets.

54
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,020
They were parents in life,

55
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,720
and someone's children too,

56
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,380
yet they ended up as mere sacrifices in a ritual.

57
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,600
Miss Xu.

58
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:53,920
Miss Xu.

59
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,490
I know what I must do now.

60
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,120
These youngsters are beyond teaching.

61
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,120
I gave you mortals a chance to ascend,

62
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,579
yet you fail to cherish it.

63
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,040
Prince.

64
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,320
You mortals dare to offend me?

65
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,050
Fang Daming!

66
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:36,360
Summon the Imperial Guards immediately.

67
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,640
Kill them all.

68
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,760
Where is the Commander?

69
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:42,090
The Commander is already waiting for you in the underworld.

70
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,680
Brother.

71
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,000
You brought troops to intrude on my Eastern Palace.

72
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Are you trying to repeat the coup of the previous dynasty?

73
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,600
By the Emperor's decree.

74
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,440
The Crown Prince has conspired with sorcerers to commit treason.

75
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:03,040
The Fourth Prince is ordered to lead the Right Imperial Guard to suppress the rebellion.

76
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,040
Setting aside what the Commander of the Imperial Guard controls,

77
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,320
there's not only the Right Imperial Guard,

78
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:09,000
but also the Left Imperial Guard and the forces under the General.

79
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,730
Even if Father Emperor because of this ritual...

80
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,800
What about the Crown Prince?

81
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,880
It would never fall to a mere Governor of Bingzhou.

82
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,279
Unless he could in a single night

83
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,880
slaughter our entire Li Tang clan.

84
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,880
Is that possible?

85
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,480
Your Highness has just enlightened me.

86
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,520
Fang Daming and the Commander

87
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,180
truly have no reason to rebel.

88
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,000
Judging by who benefits,

89
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,440
it can only be the Crown Prince pulling the strings.

90
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,159
Brother.

91
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,800
His Majesty's health is concerning.

92
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,260
If he were to pass away now,

93
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,520
the one who would benefit

94
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,960
would only be the Crown Prince.

95
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:39,760
If so,

96
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,360
that explains everything.

97
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,320
That sorcerer can freely enter and exit the Eastern Palace.

98
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,200
It was originally under the Commander's control,

99
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,080
a place established by the Left Imperial Guard.

100
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,040
Then your previous

101
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,400
false accusation of trespassing in the palace

102
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,330
makes sense now.

103
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,760
This matter involves the Crown Prince.

104
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,200
It's of great importance.

105
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,460
We cannot be careless.

106
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:56,800
I have a plan.

107
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,440
Your Highness will send me to the Crown Prince.

108
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,560
He will surely reveal his true intentions.

109
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:05,120
When the time comes, Your Highness need only find an opportunity to enter the palace and report to the Emperor.

110
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,580
Explain everything then.

111
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,960
I'd like to hear the details.

112
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,690
Every word I've spoken is true,

113
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,730
I beg Your Majesty to see the truth.

114
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,440
Master Tiangang.

115
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,040
What do you think?

116
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,160
I believe they are telling the truth.

117
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,000
Deliver my decree.

118
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,210
I have underestimated you.

119
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,840
Your calculations were flawless,

120
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,500
and your foresight is divine.

121
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,640
You're certainly no less skilled than your master, Tiangang.

122
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,360
Human hearts are unfathomable.

123
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,680
But human nature is predictable.

124
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,540
Royal Brother,

125
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,120
if you surrender now,

126
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,480
given Father Emperor's favor toward you,

127
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,560
I can still spare your life.

128
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,800
Since I dare to act,

129
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,400
I must have absolute certainty of success.

130
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,800
I had hoped to claim the Mandate of Heaven

131
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,400
and rightfully ascend the throne.

132
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,560
If that's not possible,

133
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,890
then I'll have to repeat the events of the previous dynasty.

134
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,360
Even flawed jade is acceptable.

135
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:08,880
Madam Qiu.

136
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,280
Imperial Guards, attention!

137
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,480
Arrest the Crown Prince's conspirators!

138
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,010
Yes, sir!

139
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:23,960
Move quickly!

140
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,320
Kill them all

141
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,060
then attack the Taiji Palace!

142
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,440
Yu Jianying,

143
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,240
wake up!

144
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:35,840
Lady Yu!

145
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,440
Lady Yu, wake up!

146
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,650
It's me, Wuming.

147
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,720
Lady Yu!

148
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,240
Lady Yu, wake up!
