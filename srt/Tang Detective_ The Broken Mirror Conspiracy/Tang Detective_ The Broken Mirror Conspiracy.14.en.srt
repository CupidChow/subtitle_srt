1
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:52,440
Speak.

2
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,720
Are you going to talk or not?

3
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,280
Haven't eaten today, have you?

4
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,840
Put some more effort into it.

5
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,320
I'm feeling quite itchy.

6
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,000
Why are you being so stubborn?

7
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,760
Just tell us where the Xuanyuan Mirror is,

8
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,360
and your suffering will end.

9
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,720
For one thing,

10
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,800
I know nothing about your damn Xuanyuan Mirror.

11
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,240
Even if I did know,

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,640
I would never tell you.

13
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,380
I'll show you what happens to the stubborn ones.

14
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:23,840
Sir.

15
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,160
Did you find out where the mirror is hidden?

16
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:26,680
No.

17
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,160
This fellow is quite stubborn.

18
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,220
He refuses to talk.

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,840
Don't bother anymore.

20
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,760
Notify the Ministry of Justice.

21
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,840
Execute him in three days.

22
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:33,680
What about the Xuanyuan Mirror?

23
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,210
Are we giving up the search?

24
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,380
It doesn't matter.

25
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:37,920
I have my own plans.

26
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:55,560
Yu,

27
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:56,490
you're back.

28
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,610
Quick, help me with something.

29
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,680
Hold this end.

30
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,720
No.

31
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,020
Then where did those marks come from?

32
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:22,079
What are you talking about, Wuming?

33
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,560
The needlework for flesh is different from embroidery.

34
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,480
Small needles are used when the body isn't stiff yet,

35
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,000
otherwise, large needles are needed.

36
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,880
Thick thread is for large pieces of flesh.

37
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,680
Thin thread is for small pieces.

38
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,320
Silk thread is used for the face.

39
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,480
I understand now.

40
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,040
Yu,

41
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:43,850
let's go.

42
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,130
Dinner's ready!

43
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,300
Where is everyone?

44
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,650
Father has been kidnapped.

45
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,040
Father.

46
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,140
Brother Xu.

47
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,610
Long time no see.

48
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,480
Wuming.

49
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,860
What are you doing?

50
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,210
I have something

51
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,040
to ask of you.

52
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,480
Ask away then.

53
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,240
Why did you tie up my father?

54
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,440
I wouldn't resort to this

55
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,680
if I wasn't afraid you'd refuse.

56
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,280
Wuming

57
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,840
apologizes for this.

58
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,400
What exactly do you want?

59
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,460
Why not just tell me

60
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,960
instead of being so secretive?

61
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,620
Brother Xu.

62
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:19,160
Your family's corpse-stitching technique that has been passed down for generations

63
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,019
isn't known only by Miss Xu, is it?

64
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,640
Though I'm not as diligent as my sister,

65
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,240
the family craft

66
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,170
I have indeed mastered.

67
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,620
That's what I thought.

68
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,660
Brother Xu, a month ago

69
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,020
did you go to Bingzhou?

70
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,530
How did you know?

71
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,530
Gulanduo's seven-aperture heart

72
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,960
you took it and stitched her up, didn't you?

73
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,360
At first

74
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,159
I suspected Miss Xu did it.

75
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,720
But Gulanduo

76
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,330
was killed in Bingzhou.

77
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,960
According to the timeline,

78
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:01,440
Miss Xu should have been retrieving bodies in Quanxian Village.

79
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,040
I couldn't figure this out

80
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:04,680
until

81
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:05,760
you showed up.

82
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,520
The Xu family has always been morticians.

83
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,120
We take hearts and stitch bodies as requested.

84
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,280
What's the problem?

85
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:12,940
No problem.

86
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,690
Then this proves

87
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,480
that Miss Xu's death

88
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,410
was no accident,

89
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,460
but deliberately planned by you.

90
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:23,560
You.

91
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,880
I've done the calculations.

92
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,810
It won't hit you.

93
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:37,480
You.

94
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,130
What do you mean?

95
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,690
I'm just recreating

96
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,159
how you killed Miss Xu

97
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,040
and disguised it as an accident.

98
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,680
You were actually waiting by the road

99
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,560
for Miss Xu

100
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,360
to fall into your trap.

101
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,690
Be careful, Miss Xu.

102
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,360
While everyone was busy rescuing people,

103
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,760
you put the silk thread back in your pocket.

104
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,780
To disguise this murder plan as an accident,

105
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,320
only the unique silk thread from your Xu family,

106
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,400
as thin as hair

107
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,130
yet as strong as iron, could accomplish this.

108
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,000
Besides Miss Xu herself,

109
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,480
you're the only possible culprit.

110
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,280
Nonsense!

111
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,640
Do you have any evidence?

112
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,540
I've tested it.

113
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,300
Ordinary hemp rope

114
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,650
cannot leave such marks on a wooden stick.

115
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,960
Only the ice silk thread unique to your Xu family

116
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,620
can do this.

117
00:06:39,159 --> 00:06:40,690
If you still won't admit it,

118
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:43,040
I'll take this stick and the suture thread

119
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,800
to the Wannian County magistrate

120
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,240
and demonstrate this method.

121
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:46,880
Tell me,

122
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,850
will the county magistrate

123
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,640
believe you

124
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:50,880
or believe me?

125
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,600
Fine.

126
00:06:55,159 --> 00:06:56,720
Even if I did this,

127
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,480
why didn't you report to the authorities?

128
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,010
Why did you kidnap my father

129
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,320
and trick me into coming here?

130
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,440
How is it, Uncle?

131
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,840
Making you sit quietly and watch the show,

132
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,720
isn't it fun?

133
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,580
Fun indeed.

134
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:07,960
This big rock

135
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,520
came crashing down suddenly

136
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,920
and gave me quite a scare.

137
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,930
If you agree to one request from me,

138
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,320
I won't report this to the authorities.

139
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,760
Li Chong, remnant of the former dynasty,

140
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,940
has been a fugitive until now,

141
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,400
showing no remorse,

142
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,000
robbing households,

143
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,620
stealing from gentry,

144
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,560
committing heinous crimes,

145
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,360
sentenced to be executed at noon.

146
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,240
The time has come.

147
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,840
Proceed with the execution.
