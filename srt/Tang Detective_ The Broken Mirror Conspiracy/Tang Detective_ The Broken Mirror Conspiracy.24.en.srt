1
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,440
Miss Yu, wake up.

2
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:52,650
It's me, Wuming.

3
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:53,600
Miss Yu.

4
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,239
Miss Yu, wake up.

5
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,080
How could this happen?

6
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:18,920
The puppets are impervious to weapons.

7
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:19,520
What else can we do?

8
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,960
Even your Imperial Guards have no solution.

9
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,360
What could I possibly do?

10
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,120
Could it be that our great Tang dynasty

11
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,580
has truly reached its end?

12
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:37,120
You're reluctant to hurt her.

13
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:40,000
Yet every thrust of her sword aims for your vital points.

14
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,280
Your strength is limited.

15
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,800
But she never tires.

16
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,400
How can you possibly win?

17
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,680
Madam Qiu truly lives up to her reputation as a senior of the Tiangang Sect.

18
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,080
It seems today I, Wuming,

19
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,479
am powerless to change the situation.

20
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,940
Since you are a disciple of my Tiangang Sect,

21
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:56,600
you can now betray Master Tiangang.

22
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,400
Join me instead,

23
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,400
and I'll guarantee you wealth and glory.

24
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,200
Madam Qiu thinks so highly of me.

25
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,160
Is it because you calculated

26
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,280
that I am the chosen one?

27
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,200
That's right.

28
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,720
If I am the chosen one,

29
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:11,600
then why did you take Miss Yu's soul?

30
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,840
You are both chosen ones,

31
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,280
but unfortunately with different destinies.

32
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,640
What does this mean?

33
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,370
You are the God of Literature descended to earth,

34
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,680
but Lady Yu is Mars descended to the mortal realm.

35
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,520
Glowing flames

36
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,160
and chaotic temptation.

37
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:28,920
So...

38
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,960
Though she was born into nobility

39
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,680
and possesses exceptional beauty,

40
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,480
she brings disaster to her clan.

41
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,840
A star of solitary doom.

42
00:02:37,079 --> 00:02:39,280
So that's why you wanted to use a magic formation

43
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,720
to transfer her fate to the royal family.

44
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,320
To cause the death of His Majesty and the other princes.

45
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,640
And then steal my destiny for the Crown Prince.

46
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,300
This way...

47
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,040
there would be no more concerns.

48
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,440
Your destiny is so important,

49
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:55,280
and only I can change the fate of the Li clan.

50
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,200
Why would I do this?

51
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,800
As long as we are together...

52
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:04,720
Isn't the divine right to rule in our hands?

53
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,000
Silly child.

54
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,600
So imperial power and divine right are at your disposal.

55
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,800
But have you ever considered

56
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,680
that I, Wuming,

57
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,500
would never serve a villain who treats lives as worthless?

58
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,880
Good disciple, open the window

59
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:23,480
and let the moonlight in.

60
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,560
This old bastard,

61
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,720
why is he here?

62
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,640
I didn't want to fight against my fellow disciple,

63
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:36,880
but Sister, you dared to betray Tiangan,

64
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,500
steal the divine mandate,

65
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,520
and disrupt the imperial court.

66
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,250
Your crimes are unforgivable.

67
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,600
You pretend to be so noble,

68
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,440
yet you've enjoyed wealth and glory for years in office.

69
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:51,000
Have you ever thought about our bond as fellow disciples?

70
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,800
I will destroy your future.

71
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,040
What about you?

72
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,240
Then don't blame me for disregarding our fellowship.

73
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:01,120
I want to see how you're better than me

74
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,040
and worthy of the title Master Tiangan.

75
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,840
Earth.

76
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,440
Heaven.

77
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,120
Lady Yu.

78
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,880
Lady Yu, wake up.

79
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,760
Kill me.

80
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,080
Kill me now.

81
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,520
Lady Yu.

82
00:04:47,159 --> 00:04:47,880
Wake up.

83
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,440
Yu Jianying.

84
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,400
Imperial Guards.

85
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,040
Arrest the Crown Prince's faction.

86
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:06,680
Yes, sir.

87
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,260
Take them away.

88
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,080
Move.

89
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:18,960
Master.

90
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,400
Master.

91
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:22,920
Disciple.

92
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,280
That soul-capturing creature fears moonlight.

93
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,160
Quickly take Miss Yu

94
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,440
to the center of the moonlight.

95
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:27,970
Alright.

96
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:31,840
Master.

97
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,320
Will Miss Yu disappear?

98
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,880
Miss Yu is still alive.

99
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,380
She's not a puppet.

100
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,760
Her mind has merely been corrupted by the soul-eating worms.

101
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,820
It's not a problem.

102
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,260
By the Moon Goddess above.

103
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,520
I, Wuming, offer my life as the Star of Literature

104
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,380
in exchange for Yu Jianying's life as the Mars Star.

105
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,159
Fire!

106
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,840
Earth!

107
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,880
By the mandate of heaven,

108
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,000
the Emperor decrees:

109
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,680
The Crown Prince has plotted rebellion

110
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:10,320
and shall be detained and tried by the Court of Justice.

111
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,280
The Fourth Prince has meritoriously quelled the rebellion,

112
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,240
showing loyalty to the throne and love for the country.

113
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,120
He shall succeed as Crown Prince on a chosen day.

114
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,800
Wuming, the Judicial Officer of Bingzhou,

115
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,720
has rendered meritorious service in protecting the Emperor

116
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,450
and is transferred to Chang'an as Minister of the Court of Justice.

117
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:30,160
All others involved shall receive rewards and titles.

118
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,450
My disciple,

119
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,620
you've achieved great merit.

120
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,040
You've finally been transferred to Chang'an,

121
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,440
yet you want to resign and travel the world.

122
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,240
Don't you think it's a waste?

123
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,860
Master, I keep your teachings close to my heart.

124
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,050
But what happened to Lady Yu

125
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,720
was due to my negligence.

126
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,380
I only wish to travel the world

127
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,640
to find a cure for her.

128
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,659
Very well then.

129
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,120
I won't try to persuade you anymore.

130
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,760
Take care on your journey.

131
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,440
If you need anything,

132
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,600
send me a message by carrier pigeon.

133
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,120
Nameless.

134
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,680
Do you know who

135
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,000
replaced you after you resigned as the Minister of Justice?

136
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,680
Who?

137
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,640
I heard he's also a genius,

138
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,240
incredibly intelligent,

139
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,920
transferred from another province.

140
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,040
What's his name? The one with surname Xu?

141
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:26,680
Huai'en.

142
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,560
Such a feminine name.

143
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,600
Why are there so many geniuses appearing these days?

144
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,360
Exactly.

145
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,040
He must be a fake genius,

146
00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:34,680
definitely not as smart as my brother.

147
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,200
Brother, Yu'er wants a hug.

148
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:37,730
Alright.

149
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,520
Hug me.

150
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,480
A'lang.

151
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,720
Didn't you say that from now on

152
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,920
you would stay with us

153
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,770
and never change your mind?

154
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,240
I changed my mind.

155
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,120
Goodbye.
