1
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:50,680
Tell me

2
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,620
what Madam Qiu wants you to do.

3
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:54,760
Where is

4
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,320
your sister now?

5
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,080
My sister and I

6
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,860
started practicing leatherworking skills

7
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,080
to bring back our father's soul.

8
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:07,800
So you are the heirs of the Xu family leatherworkers.

9
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:08,920
Yes.

10
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,080
I wonder

11
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,850
what brings this lady here.

12
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,000
This body might need stitching.

13
00:01:17,039 --> 00:01:18,760
The body is already so badly damaged.

14
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,360
Is there any point in stitching it?

15
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,000
This is my son.

16
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,240
I just want my son to be buried whole.

17
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,560
If you can restore his body,

18
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,360
even if only 70 percent,

19
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,800
I will reward you generously.

20
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,240
But...

21
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:35,880
I...

22
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,259
No problem, ma'am.

23
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,180
We'll prepare right away.

24
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:39,930
Brother,

25
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:41,620
with more money

26
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,700
we could treat Father's illness.

27
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,160
All right.

28
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,000
Done.

29
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,620
Madam, please take a look.

30
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,200
The bones and joints are perfectly set.

31
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,280
Excellent.

32
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,600
Truly the Xu family's special skill.

33
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,640
You two.

34
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,360
If I can cure your father's brain illness,

35
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,680
would you both serve me in return?

36
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,040
This is the soul-summoning ritual.

37
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,160
Now,

38
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,680
I can summon back your father's soul

39
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,160
from the afterlife.

40
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,920
As long as we can bring back my father's soul,

41
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:36,920
my brother and I

42
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,290
are at your service.

43
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,960
To complete the ritual,

44
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,200
we need a few more items.

45
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,800
We'll need to rely on your corpse-stitching skills.

46
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,810
We all obey Grandmother's orders.

47
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,280
Your paper craft shop burns incense all year round.

48
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,400
Your father's mental condition

49
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,800
was caused by inhaling incense for years.

50
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,730
It's poisoning,

51
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,080
not a lost soul.

52
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,610
What happened next?

53
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,320
She ordered us to help her

54
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,800
collect various corpses

55
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,440
and stitch the strong bodies

56
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,800
into puppets

57
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,360
to serve as vessels for their ritual array.

58
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,930
Did she find the body of the Chosen One?

59
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,160
The Chosen One?

60
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,610
I don't know.

61
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,240
I only know

62
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,360
that the stitched bodies

63
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,610
never satisfied her

64
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,300
and could only be used as puppets.

65
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,480
She always refused to perform rituals for my father

66
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,400
to summon his soul.

67
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,000
After Miss Xu faked her death,

68
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,930
where did she go?

69
00:04:41,159 --> 00:04:42,800
She knew you came to investigate.

70
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,330
She said you were officials

71
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,340
investigating our corpse theft and puppet making.

72
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,200
So she arranged for my sister to fake her death.

73
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:50,760
Run!

74
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,080
No, wait.

75
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:51,520
You need to go now.

76
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,240
There's clearly one...

77
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,120
Go quickly!

78
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:53,840
I'm telling you to leave.

79
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,700
Did you hear me?

80
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,260
Get out!

81
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,440
Hurry!

82
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,159
That day, get out.

83
00:04:57,159 --> 00:04:57,600
Get out!

84
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,440
After you left,

85
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,040
Quick, go!

86
00:04:59,480 --> 00:04:59,840
Go!

87
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:04,860
Sister!

88
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,040
Brother!

89
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:06,440
Qiniang,

90
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:06,960
are you alright?

91
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,440
I'm fine.

92
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,200
How did you get out from inside?

93
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,680
Was it fun in there?

94
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,880
- Come out!
- Come out!

95
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:12,800
Come here.

96
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,600
It's not fun in there.

97
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,400
You can't play there.

98
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,160
It's not fun.

99
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,020
Get up quickly.

100
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,280
What were you doing in there?

101
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,600
That man called Wuming is no ordinary person.

102
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,240
I'm afraid he won't give up so easily.

103
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,880
But I've already followed Grandmother's instructions

104
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,320
and fooled them with my fake death.

105
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,520
Where else can I hide?

106
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,320
Besides,

107
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,040
the puppet for my father's soul-summoning ritual

108
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,440
isn't even finished yet.

109
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,520
Come with me to a safer place

110
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,159
to complete your father's soul-summoning ritual.

111
00:05:37,159 --> 00:05:37,920
Where to?

112
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,400
The palace.

113
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,080
The imperial palace is guarded by the Golden Tiger Army.

114
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,800
No one will find you there.

115
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:45,280
But I'm just a commoner.

116
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,600
How can I enter the palace?

117
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,240
I have my ways.

118
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,240
Follow me.

119
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,520
Brother.

120
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,040
While I'm gone,

121
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,900
you must take good care of Father.

122
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,880
You need to listen to your brother, understand?

123
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,880
Don't be naughty anymore, be good.

124
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,370
Be obedient.

125
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,840
Qiniang.

126
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,620
Where are you going, Qiniang?

127
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,720
Qiniang, where are you going?

128
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,290
Qiniang.

129
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,240
Qiniang.

130
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,200
It's nothing.

131
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:30,800
Son.

132
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,520
Be good.

133
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,040
What did Qiniang go to do?

134
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,500
She was taken into the palace.

135
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,400
Could it be that Madam Qiu

136
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,920
is someone from the palace?

137
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,360
Then why did they dig up

138
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,880
the eyeless woman from her grave?

139
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,740
What do they want with the corpse?

140
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,840
I don't know.

141
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,640
Madam Qiu told me to dig it up.

142
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,400
She said

143
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,400
that woman's eyes are treasures

144
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,260
and her body has great use.

145
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,020
Madam Qiu needs Miss Liu's corpse

146
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,800
because Miss Liu's eyes produced blood beads.

147
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,760
And Miss Liu

148
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,640
is the vessel

149
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,100
for the puppet needed in this ritual.

150
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,560
Miss Liu is the chosen one.

151
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,930
Her life has been so bitter.

152
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,940
Kidnapped and sold as a child.

153
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,340
Fallen into the mortal world.

154
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,200
She finally escaped her fate.

155
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,600
Fought against destiny.

156
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,360
Yet had her eyes gouged out.

157
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,620
Died in a foreign land.

158
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,000
And now even in death,

159
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,480
she's being used as a puppet.

160
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,330
How could she be the chosen one?

161
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:36,960
I thought

162
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:40,520
she had taken away the puppets from the secret chamber.

163
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,520
I never expected.

164
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,940
She would use the puppet I sewed with my own hands

165
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,320
to kill my father.

166
00:07:57,159 --> 00:07:59,090
She's been deceiving me all along.

167
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,640
Deceiving my sister too.

168
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,850
Now you see how ruthless she is.

169
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,800
But it's too late.

170
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,400
She must have discovered that she

171
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,860
helped us rescue Li Chong.

172
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,440
She thought she had joined our side,

173
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,500
so she controlled the puppets to kill us and silence us.

174
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,410
Lord Wuming.

175
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,440
You must find a way to save my sister.

176
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:16,970
Alright.

177
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,440
I promise you.

178
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,800
Could the puppet fate-stealing formation

179
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,540
be the work of someone inside the palace?

180
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:32,559
