1
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,780
Where's that person just now?

2
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,240
Which person are you referring to?

3
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,160
The one who was eating,

4
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,800
who looks 30% human and 70% ghost.

5
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,200
Yes.

6
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,200
That one who clearly looks like trouble,

7
00:00:59,200 --> 00:00:59,920
with that cunning face.

8
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:00,320
Right.

9
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,800
Talking behind someone's back like this

10
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,060
isn't very nice, is it?

11
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:06,600
Tell me.

12
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,000
Didn't you two go your separate ways?

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,120
Why are you secretly following me?

14
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,400
Who's secretly following you?

15
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,560
We're just...

16
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,200
Well...

17
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,280
How do we explain this, Miss Yu?

18
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,920
Miss Liu saved our lives.

19
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,039
If you can save her,

20
00:01:18,039 --> 00:01:18,800
so can we.

21
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:19,240
Right.

22
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,539
Miss Yu is correct.

23
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,720
This matter falls under my official duties.

24
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,250
But having your assistance

25
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,400
makes me very happy.

26
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:26,860
Waiter!

27
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:29,740
Thank you, sir.

28
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,600
Why is this village so dilapidated?

29
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,240
Legend has it that this village has a magical spring.

30
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,000
Its water can extend life and health.

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,920
That's why it's called Quanxian Village.

32
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,080
The villagers were strong and healthy.

33
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,880
Rarely suffering from illness.

34
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,680
Did you get it wrong, boy?

35
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,600
This place is completely different

36
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,000
from what you described.

37
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,700
It's getting late.

38
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,900
It's going to rain.

39
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,000
Let's quickly find a place to stay for the night.

40
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,330
Okay.

41
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,600
Master Tiangang's formation symbols...

42
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,840
How did they end up here?

43
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,760
I asked him to find some firewood.

44
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,090
Why is he taking so long?

45
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:08,880
Li Chong.

46
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,640
Why did you cut so much firewood?

47
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,370
Just in case.

48
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,680
In case of what?

49
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,960
I think you just have too much energy

50
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,360
with nowhere to spend it.

51
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,040
If we run out of firewood again,

52
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,440
I won't have to go out alone to collect more.

53
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,680
Alright, let's talk about what matters.

54
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,540
Since they've targeted the lady,

55
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:26,920
[Chess piece]

56
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,200
I might as well be the bait.

57
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:28,600
No way.

58
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,610
Absolutely not.

59
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,480
If we wait too long, Miss Liu could be in danger.

60
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,540
We don't have a better plan right now.

61
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:35,640
Then,

62
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:36,800
Wolf and I

63
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,610
will help you secretly.

64
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,010
This place once filled with divine energy

65
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,640
has now become like this.

66
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,400
There must be a hidden story behind it.

67
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:13,730
Hmph!

68
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,140
What nonsense!

69
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,850
What Quanxian Village?

70
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:18,279
Prolonging life and health?

71
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:19,610
All lies to fool people.

72
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:22,640
Oh no!

73
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,520
Granny!

74
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,370
Are you alright?

75
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,740
Something must have happened to Miss Yu.

76
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,409
Let's go.

77
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,000
What are you doing?

78
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,760
Let me go!

79
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,400
Don't touch my eyes!

80
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,880
My eyes!

81
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,370
Is anyone there?

82
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,680
Bastards!

83
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,320
You said you'd protect me secretly.

84
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,600
Where are you when I need you?

85
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,360
Wuming!

86
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,560
Li Chong!

87
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,240
Come save me now!

88
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,280
I won't forgive you even if I die!

89
00:05:59,240 --> 00:05:59,640
Who's there?

90
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,040
Who?

91
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,290
What do you want?

92
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,160
My eyes...

93
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,920
You guys.

94
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:09,960
That's right.

95
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,480
It's us.

96
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,040
Besides us,

97
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,120
who else would protect you in secret?

98
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,120
Get lost!

99
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,240
Shh!

100
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,800
Keep your voice down.

101
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,560
Now is not the time to make a scene.

102
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,820
Your eyes are safe now.

103
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,860
Be careful or your mouth won't be.

104
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,360
Anyway, between me and you two,

105
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,200
there's endless hatred

106
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,730
across all rivers and seas.

107
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,160
How can you say that about us?

108
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,200
We've been so good to you.

109
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,360
I understand you saying that about him,

110
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,120
but me?

111
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,680
I have nothing but passion

112
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,720
and sincerity for you.

113
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,680
How could you say such things?

114
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,200
Get out!

115
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,220
You get out too!

116
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,050
I'll remember this.

117
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,720
I'm not done with you two.

118
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:52,020
If I weren't busy saving Miss Liu,

119
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,440
you,

120
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,800
and you,

121
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,420
would both be dead.

122
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,180
Actually, it's like this.

123
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,090
What is this?

124
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,000
Knockout drops.

125
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,600
Miss Yu is really in trouble.

126
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,860
We don't have Miss Yu's tracking skills,

127
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,120
but we're not completely helpless.

128
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,440
That's right.

129
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,720
The sachet you gave to Miss Yu,

130
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,560
if I'm not mistaken,

131
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,080
it's one of a pair, isn't it?

132
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,000
How did you know?

133
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,730
Hand it over.

134
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,120
What do you want it for?

135
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,720
Do you want to save her or not?

136
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,140
Do you have a dog's nose or something?

137
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:00,420
Miss Yu.

138
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:01,540
Miss Yu.

139
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,040
She's been drugged.

140
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,640
She won't wake up so quickly.

141
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,680
This is a petition for sacrificing to the mountain god.

142
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,010
It seems these people kidnapped Miss Liu.

143
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:14,880
Wolf.

144
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,680
If we want to rescue Miss Liu,

145
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,280
we'll need your quick hands.

146
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,360
What do you mean?

147
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,840
Get some sheep blood from the sacrifice

148
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,000
and hide it in the organs.

149
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,360
Then chop some green onions.

150
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,490
I'll explain the details to you later.

151
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:27,680
Okay.

152
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,000
Let me go!

153
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,760
Don't touch my eyes!

154
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,840
Don't touch my eyes!

155
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,600
My eyes!

156
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,520
Green onions.

157
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,240
Sheep blood.

158
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,680
You're being too cruel.

159
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,200
Better safe than sorry.

160
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:02,600
Shh.

161
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,100
Someone's coming.
