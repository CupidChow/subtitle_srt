1
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,080
That's a secret symbol of Tiangangzong.

2
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,720
It's similar to the incantation

3
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,160
that old woman was chanting.

4
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,520
Tiangangzong.

5
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,000
Master Tiangang.

6
00:00:59,000 --> 00:00:59,800
That's right.

7
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,360
Whether this ancient mirror

8
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,760
is truly the Wuji Mirror,

9
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,680
and whether that old woman's ritual

10
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,280
has any connection to Tiangangzong,

11
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,080
only Master Tiangang in Chang'an

12
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,039
can answer these questions for us.

13
00:01:09,039 --> 00:01:11,520
Master Tiangang is the Imperial Preceptor of Great Tang.

14
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,850
He resides in Chang'an.

15
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,810
How could commoners like us see him whenever we wish?

16
00:01:19,039 --> 00:01:19,600
Wuming.

17
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,760
Where did you get

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,840
your Qin King's Bone-Reflecting Mirror?

19
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,170
Now you've hit the mark.

20
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,240
Actually,

21
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,690
Master Tiangang

22
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,720
is my teacher.

23
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,720
This Qin King's Bone-Reflecting Mirror

24
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,920
was also passed down to me by my teacher.

25
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,080
A place where all nations gather

26
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,600
and all people pay homage.

27
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,729
It truly is extraordinary.

28
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,680
What's the special occasion today?

29
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,660
You two are dressed like a divine couple.

30
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,479
You really know how to talk.

31
00:01:58,479 --> 00:01:59,009
Say more.

32
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,320
I love hearing it.

33
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,360
Li Chong,

34
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,360
do you smell something sour?

35
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,120
Sour?

36
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:06,620
No, I don't.

37
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,009
You're jealous.

38
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,009
You're sick.

39
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:13,720
What smell?

40
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,720
Be more specific.

41
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,920
Karma.

42
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,250
The hexagrams show anomalies.

43
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:12,880
Hmm.

44
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,250
The mandate of heaven is changing.

45
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,160
Disciple Wuming requests an audience.

46
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,079
I, your disciple Wuming,

47
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:26,079
bring my close friends Li Chong

48
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:26,840
and Yu Jianying

49
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,079
to pay respects to you, Master.

50
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:29,840
Greetings, Master Tiangang.

51
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,960
After two years in official service,

52
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,960
you return now.

53
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,420
Is it about the Quanxian Village matter?

54
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,810
I have come this time...

55
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,760
Are you really the master's disciple?

56
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,480
The master doesn't seem interested in talking to you.

57
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,410
What do you know?

58
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,340
My master is calculating heavenly secrets.

59
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,080
In front of the master,

60
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,740
could you be more respectful?

61
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,600
I am Imperial Advisor Tiangan.

62
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,240
I pay my respects to the direct grandson of the former crown prince.

63
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,320
Please forgive my rudeness.

64
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,160
I hope for your understanding.

65
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,820
The direct grandson of the former crown prince?

66
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,600
Master, please rise.

67
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,800
Please get up.

68
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,120
Master,

69
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,360
are you mistaken?

70
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,300
I'm really not any crown prince's grandson.

71
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,440
I understand.

72
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,720
Years ago, our current emperor raised an army

73
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,360
and overthrew the previous dynasty.

74
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:41,440
All descendants of the former royal family were executed.

75
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,960
If your identity is exposed,

76
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,880
imprisonment would be inevitable.

77
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,040
Rest assured, young prince.

78
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,440
As the Imperial Advisor,

79
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,520
I protect the prosperity of Tangfeng.

80
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,000
I would never interfere with state affairs or cause chaos.

81
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,200
About your identity,

82
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,080
I will keep it strictly confidential.

83
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,159
Young prince?

84
00:04:58,159 --> 00:04:58,720
Master?

85
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,360
Are you sure you're not mistaken?

86
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,560
You've been companions for so long,

87
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,120
yet you don't know the young prince's true identity.

88
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,320
It seems your two years of training

89
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,280
are still insufficient.

90
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,160
I...

91
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:12,640
How

92
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,600
could someone so naive

93
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,440
possibly be the Crown Prince's grandson?

94
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,500
Mind your manners.

95
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,520
Wolf.

96
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,480
Can't you see it yet?

97
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,160
You've been hiding your true self quite well.

98
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,960
If you didn't come to bring the young lord to see me,

99
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,240
then why have you

100
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,760
returned this time?

101
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,120
It's like this.

102
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:42,640
Master,

103
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,020
do you recognize this?

104
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,440
You're correct.

105
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,200
These cloud inscriptions

106
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,200
are indeed the secret talismans of our Tiangang Sect.

107
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,320
As for the ritual in the cave you mentioned,

108
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,700
we'll discuss that later.

109
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,640
Regarding this ancient mirror,

110
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,240
it is indeed the Wuji Mirror,

111
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,140
which along with my Liubi Mirror,

112
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,280
the Qin King's Bone-Reflecting Mirror I gave you,

113
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,880
and His Majesty's Xuanyuan Mirror,

114
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,210
are known as the Four Great Divine Mirrors of ancient times.

115
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,000
Miss Yu.

116
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,760
Your father can finally be saved.

117
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,920
You won't have to wander the jianghu anymore.

118
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,360
Sigh. If I didn't need to hide my identity,

119
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,520
I could just tell them I'm actually looking for the Xuanyuan Mirror.

120
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,980
Tomorrow is the deadline.

121
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,600
How am I going to deliver?

122
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,880
That's wonderful!

123
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,140
My father can be saved.

124
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:50,960
Disciple.

125
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,090
Master's telepathic message.

126
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,000
I'm waiting for you at Ting Manor.

127
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:07,820
Master,

128
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,320
why did you summon me

129
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,410
so late at night?

130
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,290
Sit down.

131
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,760
Wuming.

132
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,050
You are still as clever as ever,

133
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,480
truly the God of Literature incarnate.

134
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,680
The God of Literature incarnate.

135
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,480
I summoned you late at night

136
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,560
to speak with you away from

137
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,090
those two friends of yours.

138
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,560
I want to tell you

139
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,920
about what happened in the cave.

140
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,780
Please enlighten me, Master.

141
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,240
Living in this world,

142
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,460
our fates are predetermined.

143
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,100
If one wishes to defy fate,

144
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,580
one must pay a price

145
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,680
equal to the destiny they seek.

146
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,280
In our Tiangang Sect,

147
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,760
there are three secret arts of fate manipulation.

148
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,920
The Upper Art: Borrowing Fate from the North Star.

149
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,000
The Middle Art: Transforming Fate at Wushan.

150
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,659
The Lower Art: Stealing Fate through Puppetry.

151
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,880
Let's set aside the upper and middle arts for now.

152
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,640
Only this Lower Art of Stealing Fate through Puppetry

153
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,840
is the most powerful.

154
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,800
It can steal not only one's fortune

155
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,600
and lifespan,

156
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,440
but even

157
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,920
the destiny of an emperor's nation.

158
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,120
Because of its immense power,

159
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,520
to perform this art,

160
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,840
one must construct

161
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,360
the Grand Formation of Fate-Stealing Puppetry.

162
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,480
The conditions required to build this formation

163
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,840
are extremely strict

164
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:20,840
and sinister.

165
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,960
In the Tiangang Sect,

166
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,840
it has long been classified as a forbidden art.

167
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,500
Master, are you saying

168
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,610
that the villain is refining blood pearls

169
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,520
to complete this formation?

170
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:34,360
Indeed.

171
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,720
To construct this formation,

172
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,400
one needs the extremely rare

173
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,809
Seven-Aperture Clever Heart.

174
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,059
Seven-Aperture Clever Heart...

175
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,000
