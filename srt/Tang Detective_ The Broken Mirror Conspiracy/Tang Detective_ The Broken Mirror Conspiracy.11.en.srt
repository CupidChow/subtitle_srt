1
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,320
Master, you mean

2
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,050
the demon refined the blood pearls

3
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,360
to complete this formation?

4
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,200
Indeed.

5
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,560
To construct this formation

6
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,240
requires the extremely rare

7
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,850
Seven-Aperture Spiritual Heart.

8
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,970
Seven-Aperture Spiritual Heart?

9
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,640
Her heart is missing.

10
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,640
The heart is gone.

11
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,240
Could it have been eaten by a demon?

12
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:16,920
Not at all.

13
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,760
There are suture marks here.

14
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,760
The technique is exquisite.

15
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,920
Without the Qin King's Bone-Viewing Mirror,

16
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:23,050
we wouldn't have discovered it at all.

17
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,800
The Destiny Blood-Soaked Eyeball

18
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,600
refined into the blood pearl.

19
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:33,320
It's done.

20
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,210
The blood pearl has actually been completed.

21
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,560
And also

22
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,800
using a Destiny Person's body as a vessel

23
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,200
to create a puppet.

24
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,690
These three combined as one

25
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,759
will complete the formation.

26
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,880
To take someone's fate,

27
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,880
the person's presence is not required.

28
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:07,080
Just a strand of hair or a fingernail

29
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,440
can be used through the puppet

30
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,080
to summon that person's destiny

31
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,440
and transfer it into another's body.

32
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,500
If that's the case,

33
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:17,880
Gulanduo's

34
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,360
missing heart

35
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,280
must be the Seven-Aperture Spiritual Heart.

36
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,540
She has found the Seven-Aperture Spiritual Heart as well.

37
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,410
I believe so.

38
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,660
We couldn't find a motive for her murder before,

39
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,160
but it was for that heart.

40
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,300
If that's true,

41
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,960
to complete this formation,

42
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,880
all that remains is a Destiny Person's body

43
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,480
made into a puppet.

44
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:39,720
Master,

45
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,600
who is the one

46
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,610
constructing this formation?

47
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,730
In my sect, those who know this evil technique

48
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,760
I believe

49
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,440
only my senior sister

50
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,040
Madam Qiu.

51
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,079
Your name is Yu Jianying, isn't it?

52
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:56,160
I'll remember you.

53
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,440
If you manage to survive,

54
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,770
I will come back for you.

55
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:04,860
Master,

56
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,040
where

57
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,640
can we find Madam Qiu?

58
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,120
Unlike me, my senior sister

59
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,650
didn't become an official.

60
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,360
She wanders constantly,

61
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,840
elusive as a dragon.

62
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,960
We must stop Madam Qiu from completing this formation,

63
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,200
or more innocent people

64
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,400
will fall victim to her.

65
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,040
But

66
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,520
how can we find

67
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,760
the Chosen One before she does?

68
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,560
The Chosen One

69
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,700
cannot be sought, only encountered.

70
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:29,680
However,

71
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,960
if you want to stop my senior sister,

72
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,160
there is another way.

73
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,360
Those who can make puppets

74
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:37,160
in our Great Tang territory, only one family remains.

75
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:37,920
That is

76
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,480
the leatherworker in Chang'an's East Market,

77
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,320
the Xu family.

78
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,960
The Xu family?

79
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,040
What about Miss Liu's wounds?

80
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,360
You should thank this lady.

81
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,840
She's a leatherworker from Chang'an

82
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,100
who prepared Miss Liu's funeral makeup.

83
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,840
May I ask your name?

84
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,800
Where do you live?

85
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,520
I will certainly visit to express my gratitude.

86
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,180
I'm Xu Qiniang from Chang'an.

87
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,280
Xu Qiniang...

88
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,640
So it's her.

89
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,280
Imperial Master Tiangang

90
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:27,040
I pay my respects to the direct descendant of the former crown prince.

91
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,120
Please forgive my rudeness.

92
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,960
I hope for your understanding.

93
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,380
The direct grandson of the former crown prince.

94
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,280
Please rise, Master.

95
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,440
Please get up.

96
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:38,680
Master,

97
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,360
did you make a mistake in your calculation?

98
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,820
I'm really not any crown prince's grandson.

99
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,000
I understand.

100
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,320
Years ago, the current Emperor raised an army

101
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,960
and overthrew the previous dynasty.

102
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:53,040
All descendants of the former royal family were executed.

103
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,520
If your identity is exposed,

104
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,400
imprisonment would be inevitable.

105
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,520
Rest assured, young prince.

106
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,000
As the Imperial Advisor,

107
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,960
I protect the prosperity of Tang Feng,

108
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,440
and would never interfere with state affairs.

109
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,600
Your identity

110
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,680
I will keep it secret.

111
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,840
No.

112
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,280
How is that possible?

113
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,370
According to Master Tiangang,

114
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,200
that mirror thief must be him.

115
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,440
I had just tracked him to the Governor's mansion

116
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,100
when he was pursued by Wuming.

117
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:26,880
The motive,

118
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,800
the timing,

119
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,560
plus his exceptional lightness skill -

120
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,280
my deduction can't be wrong!

121
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,480
Why is my thinking

122
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,610
becoming more and more like Wuming's?

123
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,960
Miss Yu.

124
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:55,000
I shall make you my royal consort.

125
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,120
However,

126
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,850
this fool doesn't look like a mirror thief at all.

127
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,600
Perhaps I'm overthinking this.

128
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:04,890
Li Chong.

129
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,780
He's sleeping so soundly.

130
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,200
Why is the window open?

131
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,620
Are you sure this is the place?

132
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,920
This is the address Master Tiangang mentioned.

133
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,240
I grew up in Chang'an.

134
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,880
I shouldn't be mistaken.

135
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:35,890
Let's go inside and take a look.

136
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,659
Is anyone here?

137
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,280
No wonder it looks so dark from outside.

138
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,410
What does this mean?

139
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,680
There's not a trace of yang energy here.

140
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,600
Legend says that umbrellas inside a house

141
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,200
allow one to see spirits from the netherworld.

142
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,320
This place is already heavy with yin energy.

143
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,400
And they've opened so many umbrellas inside.

144
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,640
It's like they're inviting ghosts for a meeting.

145
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,240
Look.

146
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,580
These paper figures have no eyes.

147
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,240
Paper figures are made without eyes

148
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,640
and without the final touch.

149
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,770
It's to prevent them

150
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,880
from lingering in the world of the living.

151
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,280
Lingering in this world?

152
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,240
Aren't they just paper figures?

153
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,560
How could they possibly long for worldly matters?

154
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,760
Paper is so precious,

155
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,840
yet it's used for funeral rituals.

156
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,600
This is to replace human sacrifices.

157
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,760
Before burial,

158
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:53,159
these paper figures are treated as if they were alive.

159
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:55,680
Look,

160
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,170
there's incense burning here.

161
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,140
Two short sticks and one long.

162
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,420
It seems someone died away from home.

163
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,280
These eyeless paper figures

164
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,480
remind me of Miss Liu.

165
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,560
Could this be related to what happened in Quanxian Village?

166
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,490
It's hard to say.

167
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,930
If only these paper figures

168
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,700
could tell us the answers.

169
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,040
Don't say that!

170
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,600
These paper figures

171
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,320
look quite realistic.

172
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,520
The paper figures are alive!

173
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,960
Plop plop!

174
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,840
Taking a big fall!

175
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,480
Got the plop disease!

176
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,640
Call a plop doctor to cure the plop disease!

177
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:38,080
What a mischievous ghost!

178
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,799
This person is such a prankster!

179
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:41,460
You're playing tricks again.

180
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,560
Miss Xu.

181
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,600
It's you all.
