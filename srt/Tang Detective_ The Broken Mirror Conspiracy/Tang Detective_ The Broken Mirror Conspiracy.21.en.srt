1
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,560
This person's distinctive feature is having an exquisite face.

2
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,020
If you see a beautiful nun,

3
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,420
you can cast the spell.

4
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,360
They're facing away from me.

5
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,560
How am I supposed to know which one it is?

6
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,039
It must be her.

7
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,420
So easily frightened.

8
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,130
Why hasn't she come out yet?

9
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,320
Master Facao,

10
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,900
your deduction is correct, isn't it?

11
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:51,420
Don't rush.

12
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,840
Wait a little longer.

13
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,840
Have you memorized

14
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,240
everything I taught you?

15
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:56,900
Yes, I have.

16
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,860
Here she comes.

17
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,600
Wait.

18
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Are you from the Xu family, the tanners in East Market?

19
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:08,889
Yes, Sister.

20
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,360
I am Xu Yan, the eldest son of the Xu tanner family.

21
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,020
Excellent!

22
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,680
I was just about to look for you.

23
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,400
Mr. Xu,

24
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,840
please come with me to Gannian Temple.

25
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,770
I need your help.

26
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,240
Lead the way, Sister.

27
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:20,900
Please.

28
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:26,680
Go.

29
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,660
The bones have been taken care of.

30
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,720
Thank you for your help, patron.

31
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,720
Please take this silver.

32
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,660
Remember, don't tell anyone about this.

33
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,720
I won't take this money.

34
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:41,980
Keep it, Abbot.

35
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,260
Buy some good vegetarian dishes.

36
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,680
Eat whatever you can.

37
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,260
Eat more while you can.

38
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,600
Patron.

39
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,880
What do you mean?

40
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,040
There's something I'm not sure if I should mention.

41
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,320
Please, feel free to speak.

42
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,760
Abbot, do you know

43
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,920
where these bones came from?

44
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,240
Where they came from?

45
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,570
In our funeral business, there's a legend

46
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,840
that these are bones that have become spirits.

47
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,040
How is that possible?

48
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,720
Our temple is protected by Buddha's light.

49
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,440
It's precisely because of Buddha's light.

50
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,160
These bones

51
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,440
must have been buried here before the temple was built.

52
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,360
They're over a hundred years old.

53
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,000
After absorbing Buddha's light for a century,

54
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
they've transformed into spirits.

55
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,840
According to our funeral business legends,

56
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,040
once bones become spirits,

57
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,320
they take the form of the first person they see

58
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,320
and transform into their appearance.

59
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,320
Then they turn that person into bones

60
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,250
as a substitute.

61
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,280
You mean Mingyue has already...

62
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,960
Abbot, you must investigate.

63
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,820
If this is true,

64
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,360
the bone spirit will drain the life essence of those nearby

65
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,220
until they die.

66
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,880
So this money,

67
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,720
you should keep it for yourself, Abbot.

68
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,600
Mr. Xu,

69
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,480
in your funeral business,

70
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,480
is there any way to break this curse?

71
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,200
The Abbot is wise indeed.

72
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,730
There is indeed a solution.

73
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,900
As it happens, my two senior brothers know this method.

74
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,480
Amitabha.

75
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,140
Who goes there?

76
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,520
This is a Buddhist sanctuary.

77
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,050
How dare he act so brazenly!

78
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,440
Mind your words, patron.

79
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,899
This is the Fourth Prince.

80
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,680
Fourth Prince?

81
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,120
Mei'er.

82
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:28,800
Silang.

83
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,200
Are you alright, Mei'er?

84
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,040
I'm fine.

85
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,320
Just a bit startled.

86
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,040
I heard from the servants

87
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,320
that you were unwell.

88
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,650
I was worried about you.

89
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,840
I'm just a nun.

90
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,360
Your Highness,

91
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:55,820
why trouble yourself over me?

92
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,980
Why is the Fourth Prince here?

93
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,080
What are you saying, Mei'er?

94
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,560
Isn't Mingyue His Majesty's favored consort?

95
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,320
In my heart,

96
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,620
you will always be the one I care for most.

97
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,500
Listening to them talk

98
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,060
makes me tremble all over.

99
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:13,760
Wow!

100
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,000
We seem to have seen something we shouldn't have.

101
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,200
Are we going to be silenced?

102
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:18,960
No.

103
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,200
I was planning to pass information to His Majesty

104
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,720
through Concubine Mingyue.

105
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,760
But unexpectedly,

106
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,160
the Fourth Prince showed up out of nowhere.

107
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,160
Heaven truly blesses our Great Tang.

108
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:28,640
Lang.

109
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,160
It's up to you now.

110
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,440
Why is it me again?

111
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:35,970
Who's there?

112
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,360
How dare you! Who are you?

113
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,520
I am Wu Ming.

114
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,240
I am A Lang.

115
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,400
We pay our respects to the Fourth Prince.

116
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,200
What is the meaning of this?

117
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,120
We have urgent matters concerning the fate of the Tang Dynasty to report.

118
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:50,980
We had no choice

119
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,740
but to resort to this desperate measure.

120
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:57,760
You...

121
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,520
Guards!

122
00:05:58,840 --> 00:05:59,440
Protect the prince!

123
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,160
Someone come quickly!

124
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,600
There are assassins targeting royalty!

125
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,840
Go report to the Imperial Guards!

126
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,970
Inform His Majesty!

127
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:04,840
Enough.

128
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,720
What is the

129
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,060
matter? Speak.

130
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,280
Your Highness,

131
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,920
someone intends to harm His Majesty.

132
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,320
The Emperor is in danger.

133
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:16,920
What?

134
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,450
According to what you said,

135
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,960
Fang Daming, the Governor of Bingzhou,

136
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
wants to collaborate with a martial arts practitioner

137
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,060
to overthrow our Great Tang Dynasty.

138
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,460
That's simply preposterous.

139
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,840
Not to mention the jurisdiction of the Jinwu Guard Commander,

140
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,120
who only controls the Right Jinwu Guard,

141
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,600
while there's still the Left Jinwu Guard and the General's forces.

142
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,600
Even if Father Emperor were affected by this sorcery,

143
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,560
there's still the Crown Prince.

144
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,640
How could power possibly fall to a mere Governor of Bingzhou?

145
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,000
Unless he could somehow in a single night

146
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,600
slaughter our entire Li family.

147
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,520
Is that even possible?

148
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,380
Fourth Prince,

149
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,960
in this matter, it's better to believe it exists

150
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,560
than to doubt its existence.

151
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,160
If this weren't true,

152
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,280
why would these people spend years

153
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,240
meticulously killing so many people

154
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,720
just to construct this magic formation?

155
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,560
That may be so,

156
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,280
but I don't have Father Emperor's summons.

157
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,540
Entering the palace without permission

158
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,960
is also punishable by death.

159
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,560
Fourth Prince only needs to find a way

160
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,120
to get us into the palace

161
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,330
to stop the sorcerer's ritual.

162
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,690
If anything goes wrong,

163
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,040
it will all be my doing alone,

164
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,480
and will absolutely not implicate you, Fourth Prince.

165
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,520
If everything goes as I predict,

166
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,840
then you, the Prince of Qin, will have the merit of protecting the Emperor.

167
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,400
Once you've achieved this extraordinary merit,

168
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,280
His Majesty might grant Master Mingyue to you,

169
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,560
which is not impossible.

170
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,040
Mei'er,

171
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,480
what do you think?

172
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,760
My prince, what this legal official says is absolutely right.

173
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,220
If you want to rescue me from Gannian Temple,

174
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,480
without achieving extraordinary merit,

175
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,340
I'm afraid it would be difficult.

176
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,000
All right.

177
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,480
I'll do as you say.

178
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,160
This is the Crown Prince's residence.

179
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:02,600
Yes.

180
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,680
Although I cannot take you into the palace,

181
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,520
my royal brother, as the Crown Prince,

182
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,640
can freely enter and exit the Eastern Palace.

183
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,840
The best plan now is to have the Crown Prince take you into the palace.

184
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,920
When you meet my brother,

185
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,600
repeat what you told me.

186
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,960
I understand, Your Highness.

187
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,160
Thank you for your help, Fourth Prince.

188
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:19,440
Executive Producer

189
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,040
