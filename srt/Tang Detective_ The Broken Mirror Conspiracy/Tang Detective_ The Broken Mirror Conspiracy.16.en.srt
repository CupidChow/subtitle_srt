1
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:50,800
Mr. Xu,

2
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,780
this finger guard belongs to you, right?

3
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,160
No.

4
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,120
What's wrong?

5
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,340
Afraid to admit it?

6
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,220
This finger guard fell off the corpse in the box.

7
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:13,800
This finger guard

8
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:14,940
Miss Xu has one too.

9
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,890
It must be custom-made for your Xu family.

10
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,039
To prove that

11
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,600
the corpse was Miss Xu,

12
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,240
you casually put your own finger guard

13
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,840
on the female corpse's hand.

14
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,370
But your fingers are thick,

15
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,000
so it easily fell off when placed on the corpse's hand.

16
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,240
That's why I found it.

17
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,530
If this finger guard

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,440
fits your finger,

19
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:35,840
it will prove

20
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,800
that the corpse is not Miss Xu.

21
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:40,920
Mr. Xu,

22
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,620
do you dare to try it on?

23
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,200
Wu Ming

24
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,600
You're too clever for your own good.

25
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,860
But I can't understand

26
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,280
why you and Miss Xu

27
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,600
went to such lengths to fake your deaths,

28
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,840
just to deceive us.

29
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,890
If I'm not mistaken,

30
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,900
the brother and sister

31
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,820
have been helping Madam Qiu collect corpses

32
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,600
to make puppets.

33
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,440
Miss Xu

34
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,930
I came here today

35
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,920
not only to express my gratitude,

36
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,480
but also to ask for your guidance.

37
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,720
I dare not claim to be worthy of teaching you.

38
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,000
I'm just a humble craftsman,

39
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,280
but I'll tell you everything I know.

40
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,240
Miss Liu,

41
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,100
the wounds on the corpses,

42
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,010
how did Miss Xu stitch them?

43
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,090
Come and see.

44
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,880
The needlework for flesh is different from embroidery.

45
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,800
Small needles are used before rigor mortis sets in,

46
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,360
otherwise large needles are needed.

47
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,120
Thick thread is for large pieces of flesh.

48
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,800
Thin thread is for small pieces of flesh.

49
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,060
Silk thread is used for facial features.

50
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:48,200
And this gold thread

51
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,360
is buried inside to connect the bones.

52
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,920
It's also for good fortune,

53
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,980
so in the next life,

54
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,240
they may be adorned with gold and silver.

55
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:55,880
Miss Xu,

56
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,520
do you know

57
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,280
how to sew puppets?

58
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,080
What puppets?

59
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,520
I've never heard of them.

60
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,080
Girl,

61
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,490
there's a body at the execution ground

62
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,380
and visitors are present.

63
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,640
We've accidentally discovered

64
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,240
where they keep the puppets.

65
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,520
They're afraid of being exposed,

66
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,800
so they faked their deaths

67
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,460
to escape our investigation.

68
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,000
Look.

69
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,920
Miss Liu,

70
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,720
why is her body here?

71
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,440
Yes.

72
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,440
Didn't we bury Miss Liu?

73
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,970
Could she have risen from the dead?

74
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,320
Wuming.

75
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,500
Wuming, you...

76
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,079
This...

77
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,840
I believe under this stone platform

78
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,680
is the entrance to the secret chamber.

79
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,280
Brother Xu, you shouldn't need someone to move the platform

80
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,810
before you admit it, right?

81
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:52,720
You...

82
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,280
Let go! Let go!

83
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,160
Alright.

84
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,440
Don't bother.

85
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,460
Your guess is correct.

86
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,980
Then can you tell us

87
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,650
who exactly are you helping

88
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,180
to make these puppets?

89
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,720
Where is Miss Xu now?

90
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,160
No!

91
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:07,840
Don't!

92
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,250
I work for Madam Qiu.

93
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:13,840
Father!

94
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,240
Father!

95
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,200
Why? Why?

96
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,400
I created you all.

97
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,210
Why do you have to drag us down with you?

98
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,360
Xu Yan, run!

99
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,530
Are you okay?

100
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,200
I'm fine.

101
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,000
Miss Yu.

102
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,080
We didn't live together.

103
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,560
Dying together wouldn't be so bad.

104
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,640
Stop talking nonsense.

105
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,040
Who wants to die with you?

106
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:54,640
Look at the situation we're in.

107
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,280
Stop with this talk.

108
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,340
Come help quickly!

109
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,360
These puppets won't stop until death.

110
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,690
We can't keep fighting like this forever.

111
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,010
So they're afraid of sunlight.

112
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,440
My father...

113
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,320
Your father is dead. Go now!

114
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,040
Father, run!

115
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,480
He... in this condition...

116
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,490
Will he become a puppet too?

117
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,920
Can't you say something more positive?

118
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,240
No,

119
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,600
look at the state he's in.

120
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,760
How can I say anything positive?

121
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,400
May he find peace in the afterlife soon.

122
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,530
It's corpse poison.

123
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:03,960
Disciple.

124
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,400
Chang'an will face great changes.

125
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,040
I've emerged to save the common people.

126
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,240
Chang'an will undergo changes.

127
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,040
Master Tiangang truly is an immortal.

128
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,080
He even predicted the great changes in Chang'an.

129
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:15,920
I hope Master

130
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,320
will remain safe.

131
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,320
You've seen it yourself.

132
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,760
These evil people will do anything

133
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,520
even controlling the bodies of the dead

134
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,520
treating human lives as worthless.

135
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,720
Do you realize

136
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,200
you and Miss Xu

137
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,010
are helping the wicked?

138
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,400
If you don't turn back from this wrong path.

139
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,440
The door is right there.

140
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,500
Leave immediately

141
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,330
and I won't report you to the authorities.

142
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,480
Even if you don't want to save the people of the Great Tang,

143
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,880
you should think about your sister.

144
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,540
Once her puppet is completed,

145
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,650
her fate won't be much better than your father's.

146
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,010
What do you want to know?

147
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,960
I'll tell you everything I know,

148
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,220
holding nothing back.

149
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,530
I only ask that you three save my sister

150
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,000
and not let her follow in my father's footsteps.

151
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,530
Alright,

152
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,040
I promise you.

153
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,200
Tell me,

154
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,720
what does Madam Qiu want you to do?

155
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,320
Where is

156
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,880
your sister now?
