1
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,730
Impossible.

2
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,730
What's impossible?

3
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,160
The blood vine

4
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:01,690
bursts through the intestines from inside the abdomen.

5
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,920
It emerges from the abdomen.

6
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,160
Could it be the work of evil spirits?

7
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,000
There are no such things as evil spirits in this world.

8
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,800
I believe someone is clearly putting on an act

9
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,000
to cover up the truth.

10
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,039
Devouring human hearts,

11
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:12,880
drinking human blood -

12
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:13,840
if not evil spirits, then what?

13
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,680
If they were evil spirits,

14
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,800
why wouldn't they eat the entire person?

15
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:16,840
Why leave a corpse behind?

16
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,640
A demon that doesn't eat humans.

17
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,330
I heard there's a demon called the Jinhua Cat.

18
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,920
It turns into a woman when meeting a man,

19
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,850
and into a man when meeting a woman.

20
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,650
Ridiculous.

21
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:00,760
Nonsense.

22
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,900
Then how do you think she died?

23
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,840
Gulanduo had a red mark on her ankle,

24
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:10,340
clearly caused by wearing shackles for a long time.

25
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,880
Shackles?

26
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,690
So you're saying...

27
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,490
She was forced to become a tribute.

28
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,960
Go ahead.

29
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,120
Let me kiss you once.

30
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,079
Life is hard,

31
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,490
being a woman makes it even harder.

32
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,890
Who would willingly become a gift sent to a foreign land?

33
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,520
I'll ask you one more time,

34
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,640
will you comply or not?

35
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,520
I won't.

36
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,000
Swallow it.

37
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,440
You're saying she swallowed a whip to kill herself?

38
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,120
Such a long whip.

39
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,120
Try swallowing one yourself.

40
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,680
At least it's more believable than your cat demon nonsense.

41
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,360
It must be the work of a cat demon.

42
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,490
You explain it then.

43
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,160
She was a dancing girl offered as tribute from the Western Regions.

44
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,480
Her meals and daily activities

45
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,200
were all attended to by designated people.

46
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,320
Killing her would not have been easy.

47
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,640
Miss Gulanduo.

48
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,780
Your meal is ready.

49
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,280
Non-toxic.

50
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,600
Gulanduo's maid?

51
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,360
The delegation has so many maids.

52
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,890
How would we know which one?

53
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:32,760
Besides,

54
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,800
we can't even get into the governor's mansion now.

55
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,320
Then we'll have to rely on Lang's

56
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,520
skills of climbing walls and rooftops.

57
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:51,840
Miss,

58
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,960
this must be fate.

59
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,280
I'll burn more spirit money for you.

60
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,210
Please don't come back to haunt me.

61
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,040
Wait.

62
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,640
Alisa,

63
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,680
why did you try to harm me?

64
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,880
Alisa,

65
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,240
why did you do this to me?

66
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,959
I'm right here.

67
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,120
Why did you try to harm me?

68
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,610
It wasn't me.

69
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:28,600
It was him.

70
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,560
He made me do it.

71
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,360
It was him.

72
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:38,159
She fainted already?

73
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:40,020
Can't even handle a little scare.

74
00:04:42,159 --> 00:04:43,360
I was right, wasn't I?

75
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,200
It must be her.

76
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,240
Who am I?

77
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:45,680
The phantom thief.

78
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,600
Stop talking nonsense.

79
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,260
Get to work.

80
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,640
Tell me now.

81
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,159
What connection do you have

82
00:04:56,159 --> 00:04:57,240
to Turandot's death?

83
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,300
Who are you people?

84
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,600
Why have you tied me up?

85
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,240
I'm with the diplomatic mission.

86
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,280
If anything happens to me,

87
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,360
the delegation won't let you get away with it.

88
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,040
Your life is in our hands now.

89
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,840
You'd better cooperate.

90
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,440
Don't be afraid, miss.

91
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,800
As long as you tell the truth,

92
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,260
we guarantee your safety.

93
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,240
You coward,

94
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,800
getting soft every time you see a woman.

95
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,040
How dare you hit me?

96
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,560
If we fail this mission,

97
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,840
we'll all die here.

98
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:24,600
Then so be it.

99
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,960
I haven't even gotten married yet.

100
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,880
Perfect.

101
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,080
I'll find a woman

102
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,160
to keep me company on the way to hell.

103
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,000
I said.

104
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,080
How vulgar.

105
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:39,960
Yes.

106
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,120
I killed Gulanduo.

107
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,409
Why did you kill her?

108
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,159
What grudge did you have against her?

109
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:45,960
Or perhaps

110
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,400
someone else ordered you to do it?

111
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,600
I have no grudge against Miss Gulanduo.

112
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,409
It's just...

113
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:06,520
Run!

114
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,000
The soldiers are coming!

115
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,240
Go!

116
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,080
Killing my dancers wasn't enough for you?

117
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,600
You even slaughtered my maids.

118
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,280
Do you really think the blades of my grassland aren't sharp?

119
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:22,760
Wuming!

120
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,200
What are you doing?

121
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:24,800
Governor.

122
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,440
Let me explain.

123
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,600
There's nothing to explain.

124
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,200
Soldiers!

125
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,640
Arrest this suspect!

126
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,360
Kill them!

127
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:43,880
Run!

128
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,000
Run!

129
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:00,900
After them!

130
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,760
Am I dead?

131
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,360
Have I met Buddha?

132
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,040
What are you doing?

133
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,600
You pervert!

134
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,720
Why did you hit me?

135
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,680
Hit you?

136
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,280
I'll kill you!

137
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,100
You'd better not move.

138
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,320
You might hurt yourself.

139
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,680
You scoundrel!

140
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,560
Taking advantage of someone in distress. You'll come to no good end!

141
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,240
I'll kill-

142
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:04,640
Miss Yu

143
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:06,850
I apologize.

144
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,080
Such a beautiful face

145
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,900
would be a shame to tattoo.

146
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,800
Better to keep her

147
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,660
to serve the Tang Dynasty.

148
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,400
Yes.

149
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,800
Hey!

150
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:37,380
What are

151
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,040
you all doing?

152
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:39,760
A-Lang,

153
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:40,960
go fetch some water

154
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,120
so Miss Yu can freshen up.

155
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,160
Freshen up?

156
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,160
Look at you,

157
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,780
your hair is a mess.

158
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,130
You'll feel better after cleaning up.
