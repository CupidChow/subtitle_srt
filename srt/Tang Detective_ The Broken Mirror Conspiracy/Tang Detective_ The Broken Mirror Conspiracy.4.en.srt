1
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:51,960
Get out!

2
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,040
If you want to scream, do it outside.

3
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,370
Don't act crazy in here.

4
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,600
Did you bully her?

5
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,930
It's not what you think.

6
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,770
I was just treating her wounds.

7
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,240
Treating wounds?

8
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
How's your wound?

9
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,160
It's fine now.

10
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,610
I'll get you some water.

11
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:11,880
Wait.

12
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,280
What you just saw...

13
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,520
If you dare tell anyone about it...

14
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,050
I won't let you off the hook.

15
00:01:19,039 --> 00:01:21,770
And you said nothing was going on between you two.

16
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,400
So this is

17
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,970
what you meant by important business.

18
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:41,560
We've been searching for the mirror for three days

19
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,960
and still found nothing.

20
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,400
Now he's brought me to a place like this.

21
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,640
About the Bone-Reflecting Mirror,

22
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,240
I will definitely get to the bottom of it later.

23
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,210
Don't worry.

24
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,200
I won't be as weak-willed as him.

25
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,880
Young master.

26
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,040
Come on in, is this your first time here?

27
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,200
Would you like to go in for a drink?

28
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,120
You're so handsome, young master.

29
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:08,720
Go inside.

30
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,440
Yes,

31
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,170
find a girl to keep you company.

32
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,730
What are you looking at, young master?

33
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,360
Young master.

34
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,400
Little darling, don't run away.

35
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:25,920
Darling.

36
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,560
Who's that?

37
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,280
How dare you hit me!

38
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:29,920
You stinking man!

39
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,320
Guards! Kill him for me!

40
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,280
Stop! Don't run!

41
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:49,920
It's us.

42
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,090
Well, that's great.

43
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,880
Our secret investigation has become public now.

44
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,200
You never said why you came to this red-light district.

45
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,680
I thought you came to meet a lover.

46
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,520
Him? Looking for a lover?

47
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,320
Why are you so worked up about it?

48
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:45,840
No.

49
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,370
What exactly did you two do last night?

50
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,000
Where does one find paradise?

51
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,659
Freedom and pleasure are in my district.

52
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,320
Others come to my district

53
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,120
all seeking pleasure with beautiful women.

54
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,320
Yet you come here brandishing weapons.

55
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,480
May I ask what

56
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,780
is your intention?

57
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,860
Who is this guy?

58
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,200
He's even reciting poetry.

59
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,440
The monopolizer of Bingzhou Prefecture,

60
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,040
brothels, gambling houses,

61
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:09,920
porters,

62
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,920
the underground emperor of all lowlifes,

63
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,800
Wang Ji.

64
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,050
I doubt even the Emperor enjoys

65
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,440
such pleasures as he does.

66
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,920
The power behind him is not to be underestimated.

67
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,000
I've been a judicial officer at the Governor's office for over a year.

68
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,680
Whenever I investigate anything related to his businesses,

69
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,360
Lord Fang always tells me to back off.

70
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,680
It seems the power behind him

71
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,160
is too much even for Lord Fang to challenge.

72
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,240
Disgusting.

73
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,640
A man growing inside a pile of fat.

74
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,560
I've already reported to the Governor.

75
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,760
The soldiers are probably on their way.

76
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,840
I advise you to speak up now.

77
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,800
If you want to make a living in my territory,

78
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,520
kneel down

79
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,840
and kowtow to me.

80
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,800
Perhaps I'll overlook your disruption

81
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,680
and spare your lives.

82
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,280
Qingyue.

83
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,800
You reported us to the authorities?

84
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,560
I'm afraid by the time the soldiers arrive,

85
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,620
we'll have already

86
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,200
executed you on the spot.

87
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,920
You, a mere judicial officer,

88
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,850
why don't you tell me

89
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,840
what crime I've committed?

90
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,800
This pleasure house of yours

91
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,760
appears to be a place for seeking pleasures,

92
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,640
But behind closed doors,

93
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,880
what business are you really running?

94
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,760
Do I need to spell it out?

95
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,920
My pleasure house

96
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,800
is a place for official courtesans.

97
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,920
We pay taxes

98
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,000
and receive monthly stipends.

99
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,760
Tell me what illicit business

100
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,040
I'm supposedly running.

101
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,300
If what you say is true,

102
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,820
then there's no issue.

103
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,640
I just have one question.

104
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,480
Do all the women in your establishment

105
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,080
have proper purchase contracts?

106
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,760
As soon as I entered, I noticed the women here have diverse appearances,

107
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,280
none of whom are citizens of our Great Tang.

108
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,520
Most are women from the Western Regions.

109
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,760
Since the founding of our dynasty,

110
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,360
after the Emperor's eastern campaign against Goguryeo,

111
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,560
there have been no more wars.

112
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,400
Where did you get so many slaves to purchase?

113
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,159
Not to mention your unauthorized

114
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:51,400
private trading - do you know the penalty for that?

115
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,060
If my suspicions are correct,

116
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:53,880
these slaves

117
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,120
must have been captured through your illicit dealings with foreign territories.

118
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,200
If this provokes a dispute between two nations

119
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,360
and leads to another war,

120
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,560
that's a capital offense that would exterminate nine generations of your family.

121
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,800
How dare you

122
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,800
act so brazenly on my territory!

123
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,160
I'll do whatever I want,

124
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,120
what are you going to do about it?

125
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,850
Just as I suspected.

126
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,920
You're still trying to take advantage at a time like this?

127
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,440
What?

128
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,280
Did he take advantage of you?

129
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,780
Did he or didn't he?

130
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:33,700
Young hero,

131
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:34,920
spare my life!

132
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,640
If you want money,

133
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,400
I'll take you to my hidden compartment.

134
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,600
Who wants your money?

135
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,040
Let me ask you something.

136
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,640
These women obey your every command,

137
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,560
have you been feeding them

138
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,080
a mind-controlling drug made from datura flowers?

139
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,200
Datura flowers?

140
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,940
I know nothing about that!

141
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:48,640
Young hero,

142
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,440
easy, please!

143
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,200
These young women have clearly been drugged.

144
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:52,659
Tell me,

145
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,400
where did you get this mind-controlling drug?

146
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,120
I...

147
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:56,920
bought it.

148
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,840
Where did you buy it?

149
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,440
From... um... somewhere...

150
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,660
Blood vines again.

151
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,800
Every time at the most critical moment, blood vines appear.

152
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,460
And you still say it's not the cat demon's doing?

153
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,160
What happened here?

154
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,090
The magistrate used blood vines to kill Lord Wang Ji.

155
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,600
It's that Wuming again.

156
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,060
Officers, hear my orders!

157
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,490
Arrest the fugitive Wuming immediately.

158
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,520
If there's any resistance...

159
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,360
Kill without mercy.

160
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,000
Yes, sir.

161
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,090
Search thoroughly, all of you.

162
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,039
How does Fang Daming always show up at the perfect time?

163
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,100
There's no way out.

164
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,200
Grab your weapons and fight them!

165
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,160
You only know how to fight.

166
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,220
When will you start using your brain?

167
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:50,880
Hurry, this way!

168
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:52,680
First you drug us unconscious,

169
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,160
then you save us.

170
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,080
What exactly are you up to?

171
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,600
This isn't the place to talk.

172
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,600
Please follow me.

173
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:58,880
Fine.

174
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,120
Even if it leads to hell,

175
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,800
it's better than staying here as a scapegoat.

176
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,330
Let's go.

177
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:22,800
Chief Producer

178
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,080
Zhao Wentao

179
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:23,610

Weng Linjue, Ren Wei, Lu Gaofeng, Liu Chao, Shi Mingming, Chen Guanhua, Li Jiayi, Yao Mingxing

182
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:25,500
Planner

183
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:26,640
Coordinator

184
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,560
Executive Producer

185
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:27,920
General Producer

186
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:28,560
Chen Bin, Liu Xiyang
