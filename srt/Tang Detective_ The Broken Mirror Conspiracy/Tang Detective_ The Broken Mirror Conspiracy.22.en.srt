1
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,540
If that's the case,

2
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,010
we can't waste a moment.

3
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,160
What's your name?

4
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,020
Your Highness,

5
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,400
my name is Wuming.

6
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,020
Wuming.

7
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,120
Come with me to Jiucheng Palace immediately.

8
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,240
We must find that sorcerer.

9
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:04,239
Yes.

10
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,090
Brother.

11
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,320
Don't you think this matter is

12
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,280
absurd?

13
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,680
This concerns our father the Emperor.

14
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,880
Better to believe and be wrong

15
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,210
than not believe at all.

16
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,460
Thank you for your trust, Your Highness.

17
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:18,760
Fourth Prince.

18
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,160
I entrust my friend Alang

19
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,280
to your care.

20
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,920
I'll take Alang immediately

21
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,080
and support you from outside the palace.

22
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,280
If you need anything,

23
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,660
find me outside the Vermilion Bird Gate.

24
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:29,480
Brother.

25
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,520
I, your humble brother,

26
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,320
take my leave.

27
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,520
You two, move faster.

28
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:44,880
Okay.

29
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:45,600
Dui.

30
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,080
Dui.

31
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:46,720
Come over here.

32
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,720
Dui.

33
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,080
Come.

34
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,520
Put these things over there.

35
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:50,800
Ze.

36
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,130
Come, you come here.

37
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,690
Put the stuff there.

38
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,160
Come,

39
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,010
put your things over there.

40
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,000
Xu Qiniang is indeed here.

41
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,380
Your Highness.

42
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:12,080
This is the puppet formation they've built to steal fortune.

43
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,120
Yes, Wuming,

44
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,560
you were right.

45
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
That's why I

46
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,000
trust you.

47
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,280
Wuming.

48
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,800
All of you be careful.

49
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,280
Wuming, wake up.

50
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,170
Put this in the right position.

51
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:35,800
Wuming.

52
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:37,560
Wuming.

53
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,280
Wuming.

54
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,490
How are you, Wuming?

55
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,420
Does your head still hurt?

56
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,079
Miss Yu,

57
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,570
why are you here too?

58
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,540
I was captured by the puppets.

59
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,370
After I left that day...

60
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,640
All of this

61
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,520
was planned by the Crown Prince.

62
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,520
The Crown Prince?

63
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,760
He sent people to seize the Xuanyuan Mirror

64
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,880
so that His Majesty would pass away sooner,

65
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,079
allowing him to legitimately ascend to the throne.

66
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:21,410
The Xuanyuan Mirror we sent people to find

67
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,210
never left the Eastern Palace.

68
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,960
The God of Literature has awakened.

69
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,640
I really don't understand you clever people.

70
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,840
You had already left,

71
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,840
yet you came back right into my trap.

72
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,210
As a judicial official,

73
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,600
I must seek justice for those who died unjustly,

74
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,680
clear their names,

75
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,280
and find the murderer.

76
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,680
You're such a blockhead.

77
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,880
The killer

78
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:50,520
is standing right in front of you.

79
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,520
You've investigated

80
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,320
and found him.

81
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:52,970
And then?

82
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,560
What's the point?

83
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,880
I will bring you all to justice.

84
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,200
Bring to justice.

85
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,520
I am the Crown Prince!

86
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,480
Didn't you say he was smart?

87
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,280
He seems completely foolish to me.

88
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,640
When the emperor breaks the law,

89
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,240
he is guilty as any commoner.

90
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,040
Fine.

91
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,440
I'll take that as a good omen.

92
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,520
Tonight I will complete the ritual,

93
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,800
become emperor,

94
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,640
and then we'll see how you can punish me.

95
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,840
Wuming, are you crazy?

96
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,800
Why provoke him?

97
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,800
You won't even get to punish him.

98
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,040
You could lose your life at any moment.

99
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:32,840
Don't worry.

100
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,170
I'm still useful to him.

101
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,170
He won't kill me.

102
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,120
What use could you possibly be to him?

103
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,320
You'll find out later.

104
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:39,920
By the way.

105
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,080
Why did they capture you?

106
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,200
What did they do to you after?

107
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,680
This old woman Qiu

108
00:04:48,159 --> 00:04:49,440
took blood from my fingertip

109
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,040
and dropped it onto a mirror.

110
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,800
As I expected,

111
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,560
Miss Yu, this important task

112
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,720
depends on you now.

113
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,660
What are you doing?

114
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:11,760
Could it be

115
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,210
that Miss Yu is also chosen by destiny?

116
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:21,840
It worked.

117
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,040
The blood pearl actually formed.

118
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,020
This is bad.

119
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,520
No wonder they want to capture you.

120
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,580
What time is it now?

121
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,800
It should be around 9 PM now.

122
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,760
Only one hour left

123
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,240
before the ceremony begins.

124
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,520
Little boy sits on the bench,

125
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,840
crying and begging for a wife.

126
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,800
Little boy sits on the bench,

127
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,980
crying and begging for a wife.

128
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,200
Little boy sits on the bench,

129
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,180
crying and begging for a wife.

130
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,720
You seem quite happy now,

131
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,120
but I wonder if you'll still be happy later.

132
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,380
Don't come any closer!

133
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,159
Miss Yu!

134
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:01,960
No!

135
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,000
What have you done to her?

136
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,120
Untie her.

137
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,760
Don't worry.

138
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,160
It's not time for her to die yet.

139
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,680
I just made her more obedient.

140
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,280
We're going to change into pretty clothes.

141
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:20,960
Miss Yu!

142
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,160
Miss Yu, wake up!

143
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:24,840
Miss Yu,

144
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,800
wake up!

145
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,600
It's almost time, Fourth Prince.

146
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,240
Let's begin.

147
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:33,840
We cannot

148
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,520
act rashly.

149
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,320
I would be accused of treason.

150
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,780
How long do we have to wait?

151
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,800
It's time now.

152
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,840
Withdraw from Anfu Gate.

153
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,290
Why are we withdrawing?

154
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,680
Between yin and yang,

155
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,080
all energies share one source.

156
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,520
Beyond heaven and earth,

157
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,040
spirits transcend form.

158
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,600
The hour of midnight has arrived.

159
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,920
Raise the altar.

160
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,680
Those chosen by heaven take their places.

161
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,240
The law is an eternal treasure,

162
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,320
man but a temporary vessel.

163
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,800
People perish, but laws remain.

164
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,000
The vessel protects the dynasty.

165
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,200
The Emperor returns to his place.

166
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,400
Transfer the soul, exchange the body.

167
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,200
Fulfill heaven's destiny.

168
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,380
Seven orifices bright and clear.

169
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,920
Blood pearls spring forth.

170
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,040
Revere the celestial spirits.

171
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,760
Bless us with prosperity.

172
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,560
The Moon Goddess arrives.

173
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,640
Begin the ritual.

174
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:31,880
