1
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,090
Arrest these three people.

2
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:04,760
Don't move!

3
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,090
Don't move! Don't move!

4
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,400
Governor,

5
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,620
what is this about?

6
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,120
Why am I being arrested too?

7
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:10,760
Why?

8
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,880
Do you know who she is?

9
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,780
She's a gift from the Western Regions for the Tang Emperor.

10
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,220
Miss, are you looking at me

11
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,600
or at the bronze mirror in my hand?

12
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,360
If I say I'm looking at the mirror,

13
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,960
would you be willing to give it to me?

14
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,400
That depends on whether we can escape

15
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,400
from this prison.

16
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,200
Miss,

17
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,440
if you'll live to take it.

18
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,100
It's just a worthless mirror.

19
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,400
You people are so provincial.

20
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,580
Worthless mirror?

21
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,040
Do you know what this mirror really is?

22
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:02,880
I don't know

23
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:03,920
and I don't care.

24
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,680
I, the Phantom Wolf Thief, have traveled far and wide for years.

25
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,160
I've seen all kinds of treasures.

26
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,220
This shabby mirror

27
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,780
doesn't impress me at all.

28
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,120
I'm not bragging,

29
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,680
but even the chopsticks in my home

30
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,400
are made of the finest white jade.

31
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,640
Anything that touches my mouth

32
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,720
must be washed with hot spring water.

33
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,720
Wolf,

34
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,880
if the Imperial Guards want something,

35
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,540
they must have their reasons.

36
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,250
It's not as simple as you think.

37
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,960
Imperial Guards?

38
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,240
How did this minor official

39
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,840
recognize my identity?

40
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,440
This person has an unusual background.

41
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,170
When I confronted her earlier,

42
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,650
I noticed what she wears

43
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,200
is a flexible finger-coiling sword,

44
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,460
which only the Imperial Guards possess.

45
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,680
I presume this lady

46
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,180
is from Chang'an City.

47
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,400
Listen, Wolf.

48
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,160
How dare you claim

49
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,880
to be so worldly?

50
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,760
What 'Wolf'?

51
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,079
I told you, I'm the Phantom Wolf Thief!

52
00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:57,960
You're full of hot air.

53
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,640
Phantom Wolf

54
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,040
is just a thief.

55
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,380
What's there to be so arrogant about?

56
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,160
These chains are used for death row prisoners.

57
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,620
Forged from refined iron.

58
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,400
The locking mechanism was created by descendants of the Mohist School.

59
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,000
You

60
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,650
should stop wasting your efforts.

61
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,040
I can see you have extraordinary bearing.

62
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,079
You're quite knowledgeable.

63
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:33,280
I assume you come from a distinguished background?

64
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,880
But why do you insist on doing such things?

65
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,079
Petty thievery

66
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,160
is beneath me.

67
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,560
Forget it.

68
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,120
I have nothing to say to commoners like you.

69
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,140
Hey, neighbor.

70
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:45,880
Tell me.

71
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,440
What treasure is this bronze mirror?

72
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,600
I'll steal it for you.

73
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,720
I think you

74
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:52,680
want to keep it for yourself.

75
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,130
Even if he exposes my identity,

76
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,560
I cannot let him know

77
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,420
I'm here for the Xuanyuan Mirror.

78
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,080
Legend says there were four divine mirrors in ancient times.

79
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,200
The Xuanyuan Mirror grants longevity.

80
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,360
The Qin King's Bone-Viewing Mirror

81
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,490
can reveal one's bones and meridians.

82
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,320
The Six-Nose Mirror reveals cause and effect.

83
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,120
The Painless Mirror can heal wounds and ailments.

84
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,160
My father was once a palace guard.

85
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,160
He was infected by some evil energy from an unknown source.

86
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,040
He fell ill.

87
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,519
No medicine could cure him.

88
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:20,680
I've traveled everywhere

89
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,440
just to find the legendary Painless Mirror

90
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,440
to heal my father.

91
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,490
You have good eyes for a constable.

92
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,960
This sword at my waist

93
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,130
was indeed given to me by my father.

94
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,440
Free food

95
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,570
might as well eat it.

96
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,800
Once I'm full,

97
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,260
I'll escape from here.

98
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:04,760
Are you crazy?

99
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,640
Lang,

100
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,200
Miss Yu

101
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,840
saved your life.

102
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,320
Even if this meal doesn't poison us,

103
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,520
the next one might.

104
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,160
It seems this cell

105
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,160
is truly unbearable.

106
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,120
I can't die in here.

107
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,330
I'm leaving now.

108
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,480
Do you know what kind of place the Governor's Office is?

109
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,480
Guards every three steps,

110
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,320
sentries every five steps,

111
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,720
all with different passwords.

112
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,320
Without knowing the passwords,

113
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,000
even if you escape from this prison,

114
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,480
you still can't get out of the Governor's Office.

115
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,400
Since you know so much about the Governor's Office,

116
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,000
I'd like to hear what brilliant ideas you have.

117
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,640
Create a diversion

118
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,600
and that's it.

119
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,280
Help! There's a fire!

120
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,040
Come quickly! Save us!

121
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,080
Help! Help us!

122
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,120
Someone come!

123
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,160
Fire! Come put it out!

124
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:02,800
Hurry!

125
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,240
Come put out the fire!

126
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,320
What are you doing?

127
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,000
Wouldn't it be faster to skip to the fire-setting part?

128
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,800
Then why did you set fire to the hay in my cell?

129
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,260
Aren't you coming with me?

130
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,000
How else would I know if what you said was true?

131
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I never said I wasn't coming, Wolf.

132
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,920
Help! Someone!

133
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,000
Fire! Come quickly!

134
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,080
Yes!

135
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,240
Yes!

136
00:06:57,159 --> 00:06:58,760
Quick, change your clothes.

137
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:00,720
Sword.

138
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:04,800
Take him away!

139
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,360
I've been wronged, sir!

140
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:06,920
Shut up!

141
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,440
It seems our prison break

142
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,360
has been announced throughout the city.

143
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,690
We escaped from prison,

144
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,440
but we can't get

145
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,600
through the city gates.

146
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,480
If necessary, we'll force our way out.

147
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,280
Let's just break through first.

148
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,620
Forcing our way out

149
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,040
would only further confirm

150
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,500
that we're the murderers.

151
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,640
What do you mean by that?

152
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,200
Don't blame me.

153
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,460
I didn't say anything.

154
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,620
Our only option now

155
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:39,600
is to investigate secretly

156
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,930
and find the real killer

157
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:42,400
to clear our names.

158
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,250
Where should we go next?

159
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,240
Autopsy.

160
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,210
Do you have to be so blatant?

161
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,560
Actions speak louder than words.

162
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,890
You haven't exactly been quiet yourself.

163
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,640
This foreign girl

164
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,880
is truly beautiful,

165
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,080
even in death.

166
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,720
One more word and I'll knock your teeth out.

167
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,120
What he's holding isn't the Xuanyuan Mirror.

168
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,720
It's a bone-viewing mirror.

169
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,080
So where is the real Xuanyuan Mirror?

170
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,040
Her heart is missing.

171
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,880
Could it have been eaten by some demon?

172
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,560
Not at all.

173
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,360
There are suture marks here.

174
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,280
The technique is exquisite.

175
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,560
Without the Qin King's bone-viewing mirror,

176
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,960
we would never have discovered this.

177
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,760
Where did he get that bone-viewing mirror?

178
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,200
He must know

179
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,880
about these ancient divine mirrors.

180
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,880
Perhaps we can investigate the theft of the Xuanyuan Mirror.

181
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,159
It's the vines around the neck,

182
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:40,890
causing death by suffocation.

183
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,520
But these vines...

184
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,480
Impossible.

185
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,610
What's impossible?

186
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:55,840
The blood vine

187
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:59,250
bursts through the intestines from inside the abdomen.

188
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:02,920
Zhao Wentao

189
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:03,320
Producer

190
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,600
