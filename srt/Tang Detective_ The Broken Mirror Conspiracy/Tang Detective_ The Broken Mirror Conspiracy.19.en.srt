1
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,080
Yu Jianying

2
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:52,960
She's an undercover agent

3
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:53,800
on a field mission

4
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,080
and hasn't been seen for days.

5
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,080
Miss Yu hasn't returned to the Imperial Guard.

6
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:57,920
So where

7
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,400
did she spend the night?

8
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,080
But

9
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,680
how do you know that lady?

10
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,600
We've known each other since childhood.

11
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,240
Lady?

12
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,000
Is that what you all call her?

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,400
Yu Jianying has a fierce character

14
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,320
and speaks very little.

15
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,960
Among the few women in the Imperial Guard,

16
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,080
she stands out exceptionally.

17
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,720
She's even stronger than us men.

18
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,080
So naturally we call her Lady.

19
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:16,680
Indeed,

20
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,880
Miss Yu is a heroine among women.

21
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,010
Wait, that's not right.

22
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,400
Yu Jianying is the daughter of a foreign rebel general.

23
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,930
How could you have known her since childhood?

24
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,800
I followed my father on campaigns against foreign lands since I was young.

25
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,640
I met her when her family was captured and brought back to Tang.

26
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,400
So

27
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,410
you're from a military family?

28
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,039
Yes.

29
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,360
I heard from a female officer in the Imperial Guard

30
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,759
that she has characters tattooed on her body.

31
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:42,020
Do you know about this?

32
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,720
Tattoos are usually put on the face.

33
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,960
How could they be on her body?

34
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,160
That's because our chief

35
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,160
saw that she was beautiful,

36
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,160
and also a foreign noble,

37
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,320
with excellent martial skills,

38
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,759
so he wanted her to serve the Great Tang.

39
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,760
So he ordered characters to be tattooed on her body.

40
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,090
Where these tattoos are

41
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,640
is unknown.

42
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,770
Calling her Lady

43
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,370
is actually quite fitting.

44
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,440
Since she joined the Imperial Guard

45
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,320
she never saw herself as a woman.

46
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,560
She trained rigorously

47
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,760
and showed exceptional talent.

48
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,800
We men all pale in comparison to her.

49
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:23,960
Again!

50
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,960
Stop! Don't run!

51
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,680
Stop running!

52
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,079
Completely useless.

53
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,240
Being a woman

54
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,210
and a foreigner,

55
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,720
though from a prestigious family,

56
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,650
she's the only one left of her clan.

57
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,120
No matter how influential her background,

58
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,280
she's still an orphan.

59
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,360
In the Imperial Guard full of nobles,

60
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,720
she endured endless mockery and bullying.

61
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,320
The fact that she's made it this far

62
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,079
means she's finally risen above it all.

63
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:32,440
It hasn't been easy for her.

64
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:33,760
Lady Yu,

65
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,880
where are you now?

66
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,079
The 8th day of the ninth lunar month.

67
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:46,340
The day after Xu Qiniang faked her death.

68
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,930
The Imperial Preceptor...

69
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,760
Could it be related to my master?

70
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,040
What's wrong with you?

71
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,100
Is there a problem?

72
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,370
Excuse me, Officer.

73
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,000
The sacrificial offering this time...

74
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,160
Did the Imperial Guards verify what it was?

75
00:03:59,160 --> 00:03:59,890
This time...

76
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,560
I happened to be on duty at Yanxi Gate.

77
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,600
I remember.

78
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,480
Imperial Preceptor,

79
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,279
for your entry to the palace,

80
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:18,339
do you have a written imperial edict?

81
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,890
Please proceed,

82
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:28,960
open the gate.

83
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,400
Why aren't you inspecting the boxes?

84
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,000
Master Tiangang is the Imperial Preceptor.

85
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,480
Everything he brings is for blessing His Majesty.

86
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,080
The Imperial Guards usually don't inspect them.

87
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,140
In the procession,

88
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,840
there really was a hunchbacked old woman

89
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,240
traveling with the Imperial Preceptor.

90
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:41,600
Yes,

91
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,760
because of her unusual hunched appearance,

92
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,690
I deliberately took a closer look.

93
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,960
How is this possible?

94
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,620
It's actually Master.

95
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,000
If this is true,

96
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:54,560
His Majesty is in danger.

97
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,880
At this critical moment,

98
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,000
Wuming, take my written order

99
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,240
and enter the palace first.

100
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,680
I'll gather the Imperial Guards and follow shortly.

101
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,810
I obey your command.

102
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,120
I've been running for so long.

103
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,520
Why haven't I seen a single Imperial Guard?

104
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,880
Who dares

105
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,520
to enter the imperial palace armed

106
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,080
with intent to assassinate His Majesty?

107
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,920
I have written orders from the Commander of the Imperial Guard.

108
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,120
I'm not trespassing.

109
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,170
Why are you acting this way?

110
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,880
We were just having a pleasant conversation at the Imperial Guard camp.

111
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,240
Who had a pleasant conversation with you?

112
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,440
How could I, a member of the Imperial Guard,

113
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,300
ever associate with an assassin?

114
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,740
It's been a day and night already.

115
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,880
Miss Yu hasn't returned

116
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,210
and no news from Wuming.

117
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,880
It's driving me crazy.

118
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:57,920
No.

119
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:58,840
Mr. Li,

120
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:00,600
don't forget

121
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,080
you're a wanted criminal sentenced to death.

122
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,480
You can't wander around.

123
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,120
Master's six-nose mirror.

124
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,440
Indeed, a literary genius descended from heaven.

125
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,080
It's you,

126
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,760
Governor Fang.

127
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,320
No wonder you're exceptionally intelligent.

128
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,800
Our meticulous plan

129
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,400
was completely exposed by you,

130
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,260
and you even tracked us down here.

131
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,600
Not only that,

132
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,080
this man has a powerful destiny.

133
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,940
He has the power to turn the tide when all seems lost,

134
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,920
and save a falling empire.

135
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,140
If that's the case,

136
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,370
if he could serve under my command,

137
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,820
wouldn't that be twice the result with half the effort?

138
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,540
Truly a literary genius descended from heaven.

139
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,280
I bet even the Emperor doesn't have

140
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,360
such pleasures.

141
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,600
The power behind him cannot be underestimated.

142
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,840
I've been a legal advisor at the Governor's office for over a year.

143
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,480
Whenever I investigate anything related to his businesses,

144
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,120
Lord Fang always tells me to back off.

145
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,440
It seems the power behind him

146
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,840
is too much even for Lord Fang to challenge.

147
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,560
What happened?

148
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,690
The Legal Advisor killed Master Wang Ji with blood vine.

149
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,900
It's Wuming again.

150
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,480
Officers, hear my command!

151
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,810
Arrest the fugitive Wuming immediately.

152
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,520
Yes, sir!

153
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,520
How does Fang Daming always arrive so promptly?

154
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,240
No wonder when trouble happened at Jile House,

155
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,800
you were the first to arrive.

156
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,880
So it was you protecting Wang Ji all along.

157
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,480
Kill!

158
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,540
If you don't kill me today,

159
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,520
I'll never die!

160
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,280
No wonder Hawule was so fearless.

161
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,650
Take out this woman's heart

162
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,290
and sew up the wound.

163
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,400
Yes, sir.

164
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,640
If I'm not mistaken,

165
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,040
Gulanduo's death

166
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,640
is also connected to you.

167
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,800
So the mastermind behind all this

168
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,400
is you,

169
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,400
Fang Daming,

170
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,080
Governor Fang.
