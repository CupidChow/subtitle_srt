1
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,200
Scallions

2
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:53,920
Lamb blood.

3
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,360
You guys are too cruel.

4
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,880
Better safe than sorry.

5
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:00,200
Shh.

6
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,220
Someone's coming.

7
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,440
Miss Yu,

8
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,840
I'm afraid you'll have to bear with this a little longer.

9
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,160
No.

10
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,680
What are you going to do now?

11
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,160
Your kind gesture to Miss Liu

12
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,200
shouldn't go to waste.

13
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:19,860
Why don't we

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,120
turn the tables on them?

15
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:21,560
Yes.

16
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:23,980
Let's do it.

17
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:47,640
Let's go.

18
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,980
So this is the source of the Fairy Spring.

19
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,520
These two have been diverting the water,

20
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,579
causing the village spring to dry up.

21
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:57,640
Clouds inscribe the void,

22
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,400
at the dawn of catastrophe,

23
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,320
now distant, now near,

24
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,410
sometimes sinking, sometimes floating,

25
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,650
wandering in five directions,

26
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,000
within a measure of 10 feet,

27
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,360
to perform the cave scriptures,

28
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,120
and write spiritual talismans,

29
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,079
bright in existence,

30
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,760
dark in nothingness.

31
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,040
Bow to the ground,

32
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,200
kowtow three times to seek spirits.

33
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,560
Another one.

34
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,680
What is that?

35
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,079
These young women

36
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,120
are the closest to what our master needs.

37
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,520
The blood pearls still couldn't be refined.

38
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,440
Give me the eyeballs.

39
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,320
Blood pearls.

40
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,380
Your eyes are still there.

41
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,240
Of course.

42
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,279
Speak.

43
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,300
What happened?

44
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:19,800
Come out.

45
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:21,880
Don't be afraid, Miss Yu.

46
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,080
Come to your brother.

47
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,320
Kill them.

48
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,240
Wolf.

49
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,640
How much have you eaten these days?

50
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,570
You're so heavy.

51
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,560
You're just too weak.

52
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:00,820
I...

53
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,280
My body is all muscle.

54
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,800
Try to hold him back.

55
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,600
I'll go save them.

56
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,860
You underestimate me.

57
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,720
The Phantom Wolf has never lost.

58
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,100
Go quickly.

59
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:32,800
Miss Yu.

60
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:33,760
Miss Yu.

61
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,340
You're finally awake.

62
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,520
Wuming.

63
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,840
You made me charge into battle.

64
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,400
While you're flirting with girls.

65
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,240
When I get out of here.

66
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,600
I'll be the first to settle scores with you.

67
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,130
I'll go help Li Chong first.

68
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:11,880
Miss Liu.

69
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,000
Miss Liu.

70
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,560
Miss Liu.

71
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,680
No, don't.

72
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,140
It's me.

73
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,450
I'm Yu Jianying.

74
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,130
Don't be afraid.

75
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,360
I'm here.

76
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,600
Please.

77
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:30,800
Save the girls.

78
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,680
Miss Liu.

79
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,180
This wicked old woman.

80
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,560
Today I'm going to kill you.

81
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,360
And gouge out your eyeballs too.

82
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,360
No, please.

83
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,560
Miss, I was forced to do this.

84
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,320
I had no choice.

85
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,480
Please spare this old woman.

86
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,080
You are a kind person, miss.

87
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,780
You have a generous heart.

88
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,920
Please let this old woman go.

89
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,160
Done.

90
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,260
The blood pearl actually worked.

91
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,530
Don't get entangled with them.

92
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,320
Are you okay?

93
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:37,850
I'm fine.

94
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:38,620
After them!

95
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,240
Your name is Yu Jianying, right?

96
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,440
I will remember you.

97
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,600
If you manage to survive,

98
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,930
I will come back for you.

99
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,360
The smoke is poisonous.

100
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,420
There's no way out.

101
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,760
We have to jump down the waterfall.

102
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,490
It's so high.

103
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,600
If we don't die from the fall, we'll drown.

104
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,720
Jumping gives us a slim chance of survival.

105
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,040
Staying here means certain death.

106
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:00,600
Wait.

107
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,560
Let's take Miss Liu with us.

108
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,890
She's suffered enough.

109
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,690
I don't want her body to be destroyed after death.

110
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:08,970
You go first.

111
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,500
I'll check if anyone else is still alive.

112
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,400
Nameless

113
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:24,920
Dance.

114
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:26,560
