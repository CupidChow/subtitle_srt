1
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,530
Why are they in such a state?

2
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,890
Who locked them up here?

3
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,200
Wang Ji, that beast!

4
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,360
Death is too easy for him.

5
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,760
He should be sliced by a thousand blades

6
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,039
and burn in the cauldrons of hell.

7
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:12,880
These women,

8
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,360
were they all recently purchased by Wang Ji?

9
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,360
You're right.

10
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,080
After Wang Ji buys these girls,

11
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,080
he controls them with mind-altering drugs.

12
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,600
Some of them adapt to the drugs

13
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,480
and become courtesans of the pleasure house,

14
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,160
trapped there for life.

15
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,600
Others lose their minds

16
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,039
and become lost in hallucinations

17
00:01:31,039 --> 00:01:32,680
until their lives waste away,

18
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,140
just like these ones here.

19
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:35,640
Miss Yu.

20
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,600
Since you know what this beast has done,

21
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,800
why are you helping such evil?

22
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,759
Why did you bring us here?

23
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:41,220
What's your real purpose?

24
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:42,680
Let go of her first.

25
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,810
You're about to strangle her to death.

26
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,800
This place is hidden,

27
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:47,940
but it's also safe.

28
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:49,800
If she truly wanted to harm us

29
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,759
or avenge Wang Ji,

30
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:52,200
she wouldn't have brought us here.

31
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,000
Miss Qingyue,

32
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,800
you need our help, don't you?

33
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,320
One year ago,

34
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,360
I and other girls

35
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:04,450
were kidnapped by Western bandits and brought to the Tang Dynasty.

36
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,360
This girl has beautiful eyes.

37
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,920
She'll fetch a good price.

38
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,680
No!

39
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,079
My eyes!

40
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,040
Take her away.

41
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,160
My eyes!

42
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,360
No!

43
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,240
Please don't!

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,680
Stop!

45
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:28,840
Stop!

46
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,480
I'll take this woman.

47
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,160
Out of gratitude for saving my life,

48
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,880
I entrusted my broken self to Wang Ji.

49
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,440
Qingyue.

50
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,440
I saved your life.

51
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,280
How have I treated you?

52
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,560
Feed these drugs

53
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,120
to them.

54
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,360
The Pleasure House is a place

55
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,880
for officials and nobles to enjoy themselves.

56
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,840
For me,

57
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,530
just being alive is enough.

58
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,440
Later, more Western girls were brought in.

59
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,250
Qingyue.

60
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,600
You've known all along this was a mind-control drug

61
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,079
and you've been helping the villain all these years.

62
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:20,960
I know.

63
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,090
I've known from the beginning.

64
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,520
That's why I killed him

65
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:26,360
to redeem myself.

66
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,520
What?

67
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,040
You killed Wang Ji?

68
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,000
You're the cat demon who controls the blood vine!

69
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,040
What cat demon?

70
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,600
I really wonder if your head is filled

71
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,860
with nothing but mush.

72
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:36,210
What does that mean?

73
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,240
Miss Qingyue,

74
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,760
the blood vine seed

75
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,240
was fed to Wang Ji by you.

76
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,320
Yes.

77
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:44,740
Qingyue...

78
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:58,840
Miss Qingyue,

79
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,640
I know everything you've done

80
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,000
was because you were trapped with no choice.

81
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,680
You saved us today.

82
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,560
We certainly won't reveal

83
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,720
the cause of Wang Ji's death.

84
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,320
Exactly!

85
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,360
That fat pig

86
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,360
died too quickly.

87
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,000
We should have tortured him for a few more days.

88
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,480
I know you're not a bad person.

89
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,880
But that blood vine seed,

90
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,000
where did it come from?

91
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,860
Please tell us.

92
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,920
You served me well this time.

93
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,880
Here's your money.

94
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,480
That chubby guy got off easy.

95
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,760
This time,

96
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,480
I'm giving you this.

97
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,040
What is this?

98
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,520
This is a deadly seed.

99
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,440
If there's someone you don't like,

100
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,400
feed it to them.

101
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,560
Wait a moment.

102
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,600
Slow down!

103
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,760
We can't leave the city gate.

104
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,960
We can only see you off this far.

105
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:03,620
Go quickly.

106
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,040
Thank you all.

107
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,800
Get up.

108
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,140
It's not a big deal.

109
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,840
You can't bear to let go?

110
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,400
You can't bear to go after them?

111
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,960
I never thought that our Master Wuming, as a legal official,

112
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,220
would personally let a murderer go free.

113
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,840
Don't forget.

114
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,159
We're also suspects.

115
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:36,920
Now,

116
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,770
it's our turn to fight back.

117
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,560
Water on the left side of your head,

118
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,080
flour on the right side.

119
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,210
What does that mean?

120
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,700
Just shake it and you'll find out.

121
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:58,960
Sir,

122
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,560
a dancer from the Western Regions delegation requests to see you.

123
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,560
She says Master Hawule

124
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,400
knows you've been exhausted these days

125
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,560
and sent her to attend to you,

126
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,290
to help you relax before sleep.

127
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:11,220
The Western Regions certainly understand social graces.

128
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,120
She is indeed more robust than Central Plains women.

129
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:15,720
Alright.

130
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,920
You all may go rest as well.

131
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,960
No need to stand guard outside anymore.

132
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:19,490
Yes, sir.

133
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,760
Come here.

134
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,040
Let's see how you'll help me relax.

135
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,760
Governor,

136
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,280
is the pressure alright?

137
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,240
You've got quite a grip, miss.

138
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,000
These Western Region women are good in every way,

139
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,640
except for their body hair.

140
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,680
It's a bit excessive.

141
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,500
Don't move.

142
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:16,960
Wu Ming,

143
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,680
you're incredibly audacious.

144
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,160
I had no choice.

145
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,520
Please forgive me, Governor.

146
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,800
Killing the dancer offered to His Majesty was 'no choice'?

147
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,080
Silencing witnesses was 'no choice'?

148
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,800
And kidnapping a court official was also 'no choice'?

149
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,930
If you truly believe I am the murderer,

150
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:29,800
what's my motive?

151
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,280
The dancer sent from the Western Region to the Great Tang is dead.

152
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,960
Whether it concerns the Western Region or the Great Tang,

153
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,200
any motive would suffice.

154
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,000
His Majesty only needs a culprit.

155
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,860
And that dancer

156
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,800
died right after you touched her.

157
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,260
If I were truly the killer,

158
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,440
why would I make things so complicated?

159
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,360
I could have just finished her off directly.

160
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,520
Wouldn't that be simpler?

161
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,360
His Majesty is wise.

162
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,040
How could he not understand the true cause and effect?

163
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:48,700
Don't move.

164
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:49,960
Governor.

165
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,650
Forgive my offense.

166
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,720
Gulanduo died from the blood vine piercing through her abdomen,

167
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,080
causing excessive blood loss.

168
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,240
The blood-thirsty vine is vicious.

169
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,200
It feeds on human blood

170
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,280
and grows wildly when it tastes blood.

171
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,640
Finding the cause of death will clear your suspicion.

172
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,160
The blood vine emerged from her abdomen,

173
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,080
which indicates

174
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,140
someone fed her the blood vine seeds.

175
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,480
Gulanduo's meals and daily routines

176
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,360
were all handled by designated staff.

177
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,440
You mean

178
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,640
Ailisha?

179
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,320
But she's dead too.

180
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,850
That's why we captured her.

181
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,720
She was killed

182
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:33,159
before she could reveal the murderer.

183
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:34,400
I have no grudge

184
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,400
against Miss Gulanduo.

185
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:35,799
Yes.

186
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,000
Words alone are not proof.

187
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,860
It's possible that you killed her

188
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,360
using the same method to divert suspicion.

189
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,320
Gulando and Elisa's deaths

190
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,600
have identical causes and conditions,

191
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,880
but with one difference.

192
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,800
What's the difference?

193
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,930
Their expressions.

194
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,800
Gulando's face showed ecstasy,

195
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,160
while hers did not.

196
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,760
You mean Gulando didn't feel any pain?

197
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,440
That's because Gulando

198
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,400
had taken a drug

199
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,000
called Mihun powder.

200
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,640
It's made from Western Region's datura flowers.

201
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,840
Mihun powder weakens one's willpower.

202
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,400
It amplifies physical desires

203
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,530
and makes the victim

204
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,680
obey the one who administered it.

205
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,810
The Pleasure House?

206
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,120
Are you saying

207
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,120
the killer is at the Pleasure House?

208
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,840
Wang Ji has been feeding the courtesans at the Pleasure House

209
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,120
with mind-controlling drugs.

210
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:35,720
That's why

211
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,040
the Pleasure House has become what people call

212
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,160
a paradise on earth.

213
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,800
The Pleasure House is full of government courtesans.

214
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,400
Wang Ji wouldn't dare go that far.

215
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,560
The courtesans at Jile House

216
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,040
were mostly abducted

217
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,060
without any purchase contracts.

218
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,610
This greatly reduced Jile House's expenses.

219
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,920
The abducted women were defiant

220
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,680
and even tried to escape or rebel.

221
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:57,360
So Wang Ji used mind-control drugs to subdue them.

222
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,080
Is that why you killed them?

223
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,600
Don't falsely accuse me.

224
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,360
Wang Ji wasn't killed by me.

225
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,080
It was because the women under his control

226
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,410
couldn't bear his abuse

227
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,260
and obtained bloodvine seeds from traffickers

228
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,320
to kill him.

229
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,480
These are deadly seeds.

230
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,480
If you don't like someone,

231
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,610
just feed it to them.

232
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,520
Wait a moment.

233
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,640
According to my investigation,

234
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,920
when Yu Jianying escaped,

235
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,120
the poison on the arrow that wounded her

236
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,360
came from

237
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,680
the datura flower.

238
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,600
Human trafficker

239
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:52,960
Arrow wound

240
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,200
Bloodthirsty vine seeds

241
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,200
Datura flower

242
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,440
