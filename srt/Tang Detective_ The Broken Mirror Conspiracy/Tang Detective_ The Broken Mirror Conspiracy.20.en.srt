1
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,040
So the mastermind behind all this

2
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,520
is you,

3
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,520
Fang Daming,

4
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,200
Governor Fang.

5
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,720
Congratulations.

6
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,640
You got it all right.

7
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,680
Don't you feel all the mysteries have been solved?

8
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,720
A sense of sudden enlightenment.

9
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,960
I don't understand.

10
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,900
Why did you do all this?

11
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,640
What's your purpose?

12
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,340
If you really want to know,

13
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,280
then submit to my command,

14
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,880
use your talents,

15
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,480
and help me achieve greatness.

16
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,280
Then,

17
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,320
you'll understand how great my cause truly is.

18
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,800
You call killing innocent people

19
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,680
a great cause?

20
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,740
Success is built on the bones of many.

21
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,039
Great achievements require sacrifices.

22
00:01:34,039 --> 00:01:35,080
Even our Emperor

23
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,960
stands on the bones of countless soldiers,

24
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,840
and his own two brothers

25
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,120
died by his blade.

26
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:41,960
Only then

27
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,479
could he build such a prosperous empire.

28
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,280
So,

29
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,960
you want to use the Puppet Formation

30
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,560
to destroy our Tang Dynasty?

31
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,440
Not at all.

32
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,640
I want to revitalize our great Tang.

33
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:55,880
Nonsense!

34
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,090
Our Tang Dynasty's prosperity

35
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,900
cannot be achieved through such evil means.

36
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,280
What utter absurdity!

37
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,660
It seems that clever mind of yours

38
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,120
needs more time to come around.

39
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,240
No matter.

40
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,340
I'll wait patiently for you to change your mind.

41
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,680
The Chosen One.

42
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,360
The Chosen One.

43
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,720
I am the Chosen One.

44
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,240
How would you like to deal with him, sir?

45
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:27,770
Kill him.

46
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,079
We can't kill him yet.

47
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,880
I still have important use for him.

48
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,840
There are only a few days left

49
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,480
until the full moon ritual begins.

50
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,600
Starve him for these few days.

51
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,460
I don't believe

52
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,520
that after days without food or water,

53
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:40,120
he'll still be so stubborn when the time comes.

54
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,480
Come on.

55
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,090
How about it?

56
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,040
Want some?

57
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,840
Let us know when you change your mind.

58
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,280
Otherwise, once you're starving,

59
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,840
it'll be too late to regret.

60
00:02:58,880 --> 00:02:59,760
Who cares?

61
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,920
In a few more days,

62
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,720
he'll die of thirst if not hunger.

63
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,680
Come, brother, have a drink.

64
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,680
Come, drink up.

65
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,440
Drink. Keep drinking.

66
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,280
Come.

67
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:24,840
Wuming

68
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,610
How are you feeling?

69
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:28,960
Wuming

70
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:34,880
You haven't eaten for a long time,

71
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,940
you can only have plain porridge now.

72
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,160
Do you know

73
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,160
breaking someone out of prison is punishable by death?

74
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:41,880
I know.

75
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,890
Then why did you still do it?

76
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,880
Disrupting an execution

77
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,880
and replacing a condemned prisoner are also capital offenses.

78
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,440
If you can sacrifice so much for me,

79
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,480
why can't I do the same?

80
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,079
Besides,

81
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,960
I'm already a dead man.

82
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,880
Have you ever heard of a dead man fearing death?

83
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,900
Let me do it myself.

84
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,120
How did you know

85
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,580
I was imprisoned by the Imperial Guards?

86
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,960
You went to the Imperial Guards headquarters

87
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,680
to report the case and look for Miss Yu.

88
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,520
If I didn't go to the Imperial Guards to find you,

89
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,680
should I have gone to the Wannian County office instead?

90
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,240
Oh!

91
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,940
You've gotten smarter this time.

92
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,920
After being with you all for so long,

93
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,279
if I still didn't understand what 'water on the left,

94
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:21,740
flour on the right' means,

95
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:24,690
then my head would truly be filled with porridge.

96
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,940
I didn't know you were coming,

97
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,880
please forgive me for not greeting you properly.

98
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,680
Drinking while on duty?

99
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,240
You two must be tired of living.

100
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,240
We wouldn't dare.

101
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,720
The Commander ordered us

102
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,440
to eat and drink in front of that prisoner called Nameless

103
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,520
to break his spirit.

104
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,880
Yes, we weren't being lazy.

105
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,840
We were following the general's orders.

106
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,970
So that guy is indeed imprisoned here.

107
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,560
Very good.

108
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,680
The Commander

109
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,880
specifically sent me to reward you two.

110
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:45,840
Here.

111
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,440
So?

112
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,010
I'm impressive, right?

113
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,040
But anyway.

114
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,880
I've been at the Imperial Guard camp

115
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,010
but couldn't find any trace of Lady Yu.

116
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,810
I find this suspicious too.

117
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,760
Lady Yu's disappearance

118
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,080
must be connected to those evil people.

119
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,360
I just never expected

120
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,320
that the Imperial Guard Commander

121
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,850
would be working with them.

122
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,570
It seems we can't enter the Imperial City now.

123
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:15,800
Enough.

124
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,240
Stop being mysterious.

125
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,520
I know you already have a plan, don't you?

126
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,540
You really do know me well.

127
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,160
Could you please lower your voice?

128
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,560
This is a sacred Buddhist place.

129
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,320
Nonsense.

130
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,760
Try staying up all night without sleep.

131
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,560
Abbot,

132
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,080
this is Master Xu Yan from the paper craft shop,

133
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,120
and these two behind him are his assistants.

134
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,600
Thank you for your help, sir.

135
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,460
Please come in.

136
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,200
Abbot,

137
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:29,760
this is...

138
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,680
Last night, while the nuns were performing evening prayers,

139
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,960
something strange happened.

140
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,090
A person appeared walking to this spot

141
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:37,890
and turned into a pile of bones.

142
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,680
The temple is full of nuns,

143
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,640
and we dare not touch such impurity.

144
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:45,200
We only ask that you come to collect the remains.

145
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,620
Why not report it to the authorities?

146
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,680
To be honest with you, sir,

147
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,940
the nun in the meditation hall last night

148
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,480
was Master Mingyue,

149
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,880
who has a special status.

150
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,920
And these bones are dressed in imperial robes,

151
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,960
though they are just theatrical costumes.

152
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,080
If we report this to officials,

153
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,720
it might damage Master Mingyue's reputation.

154
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,520
I must trouble you, Mr. Xu,

155
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,160
to collect these remains as soon as possible.

156
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,440
Please keep this matter confidential.

157
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,040
You truly are prescient.

158
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,660
We have to rely on your skills as a phantom thief.
