1
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:51,760
Mr. Fang.

2
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:56,800
I...

3
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:57,840
I was just...

4
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,370
Mr. Fang.

5
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,460
You were distracted just now.

6
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,480
I implore you, Governor,

7
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,240
to thoroughly investigate Hawule

8
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,700
for those innocent women.

9
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,050
Please investigate thoroughly, sir.

10
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,900
Search carefully.

11
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,480
Governor,

12
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,720
there's no one inside.

13
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,240
All the tributes, supplies and necessities

14
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,080
were left behind.

15
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,400
It appears to be a hasty escape.

16
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,200
They've fled.

17
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:35,280
Wuming

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,520
It seems you were telling the truth.

19
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,000
Hawule must have discovered that his crimes

20
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,800
were exposed.

21
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,320
He fled to escape punishment.

22
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,720
What exactly went wrong?

23
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,320
How did Hawule know in advance?

24
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:45,920
It's fine.

25
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,729
He won't get far.

26
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,200
Leave it to me.

27
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:50,560
Go.

28
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,320
Quickly, assemble!

29
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,360
Follow the magistrate.

30
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:52,890
Yes, sir.

31
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:53,840
Hya!

32
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:54,680
Hya!

33
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,200
Hya!

34
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,240
Hya!

35
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:11,720
Hawule.

36
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,480
You've committed murder under the name of Western Regions envoy,

37
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,280
abducted young women,

38
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,240
and forced them into trafficking.

39
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,280
Now the evidence is conclusive.

40
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,210
Will you confess and face justice?

41
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,200
You people,

42
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,240
you've repeatedly ruined my plans,

43
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,640
forcing me to fight for my life against you.

44
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:31,920
Hawule.

45
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,320
Do you admit your guilt?

46
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,920
I am a dignified ambassador.

47
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,000
You, a mere judicial officer,

48
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,040
want me to confess?

49
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:37,920
I refuse.

50
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,840
Stubborn even at death's door.

51
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,700
Such a villain.

52
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,400
Just kill him and be done with it.

53
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:41,760
Wait.

54
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,840
There's something I still don't understand.

55
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,120
Gulanduo was your tribute to His Majesty.

56
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,250
Why did you kill her?

57
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,000
Offering her to the Tang Emperor

58
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,600
was just to get some rewards.

59
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,640
Someone offered a higher price.

60
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,100
So I killed her.

61
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,850
In your eyes, human life

62
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,010
is truly just a game.

63
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,600
A mere weak woman

64
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,050
can't ride horses to pacify the realm,

65
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,840
nor farm to feed herself.

66
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,200
How is she different from an ant?

67
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,480
Even ants are living beings.

68
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,720
Your crimes are unforgivable.

69
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,120
No!

70
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,200
Hand him over to Commander Fang.

71
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,530
The law will punish him.

72
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:19,640
Miss Yu,

73
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,610
you must not!

74
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,480
The suspect has been caught.

75
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,610
You mustn't commit needless killing.

76
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,320
Stab him!

77
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,360
Stab him!

78
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,420
If you don't kill me today,

79
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,400
I'll never die!

80
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,760
Die!

81
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,440
Miss Yu!

82
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,200
Come on!

83
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,959
The culprit has been arrested.

84
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,089
As for what follows,

85
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,560
Magistrate Fang will report to His Majesty.

86
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,620
You two are now free

87
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,160
and may come and go from Bingzhou as you please.

88
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:23,890
I wonder what

89
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,180
your plans are now?

90
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,940
I, the phantom thief Minglang, am back in business!

91
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,440
Lang.

92
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,000
If you dare

93
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,040
to commit crimes right under our noses again,

94
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,280
I won't be so lenient.

95
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:35,840
Miss Yu,

96
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,140
what about you?

97
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,360
I will continue searching for the Wuji Mirror

98
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,320
to extend my father's life.

99
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:40,720
Good.

100
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,560
I'll mobilize everyone in the magistrate's office

101
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,490
to help you locate the Wuji Mirror.

102
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,010
As we part today,

103
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,680
I don't know when we'll meet again.

104
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,140
Miss Yu,

105
00:04:49,159 --> 00:04:50,620
take care on your journey.

106
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,120
Farewell.

107
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,120
Miss Yu.

108
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,170
The shopkeeper says

109
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,370
this sachet can ward off evil and harm.

110
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,540
I'm giving it to you

111
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,720
to keep you safe on your journey.

112
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,920
There aren't so many

113
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,240
mystical things in this world.

114
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,300
Even if there were,

115
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,850
what good would a sachet do?

116
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,560
I only trust the sword at my waist.

117
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,720
Miss Yu, actually I...

118
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,400
Although it can't ward off evil,

119
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,260
on your journey

120
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,200
you'll inevitably encounter insects.

121
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:29,880
This sachet

122
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,380
still has some use.

123
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,250
Thank you, then.

124
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,360
Miss Yu.

125
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,680
In the future,

126
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,159
without someone like me with superior martial skills

127
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:41,040
to protect you.

128
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,400
Don't be impulsive

129
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,730
and stay out of trouble.

130
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:44,480
Sir.

131
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,520
This blind young lady

132
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,780
insists on seeing you.

133
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,360
Miss Chumo.

134
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:52,970
All these years,

135
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,360
I've been wandering the martial world alone.

136
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,200
I can no longer stay in Bingzhou.

137
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,440
Why don't I accompany you on your journey?

138
00:05:59,440 --> 00:05:59,800
So you'll have someone to look after you.

139
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,260
Wuming.

140
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,520
I don't know.

141
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,240
Miss Chumo.

142
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,130
Didn't you leave Bingzhou?

143
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,960
Didn't she leave with Miss Liu?

144
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,120
Your eyes.

145
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:19,840
Sir.

146
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,920
Please, sir, you must save Sister Liu.

147
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,800
I wonder what you think, miss.

148
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,840
Her eyes.

149
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,370
Please get up first.

150
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,400
What happened?

151
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:35,920
That day

152
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,159
Sister Liu

153
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,000
after she rescued us.

154
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,560
Ma'am.

155
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,440
Ma'am.

156
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,440
Ma'am.

157
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,240
We are all muleteers.

158
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,040
There are no inns or posts here.

159
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,440
Could we have some water?

160
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,480
Thank you, ma'am.

161
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,360
Take it easy.

162
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,120
Where are you young ladies

163
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,880
heading together?

164
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,580
Going home.

165
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:29,800
Ladies,

166
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,120
where do you live?

167
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:31,840
We...

168
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,320
Sister...

169
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,460
Drink this.

170
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,680
Why don't you

171
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,040
stay in our Quanxian Village?

172
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,240
My eyes!

173
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,360
Stop!

174
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,080
Chumo!

175
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:01,800
Sister Liu!

176
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,600
I'm here.

177
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,320
My eyes!

178
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,520
Chumo!

179
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,080
Where are you taking her?

180
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,520
Get away!

181
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,760
Chumo, run!

182
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,920
Chumo, hide here first.

183
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:23,960
This way.

184
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,000
Hurry!

185
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,049
Giddyup!

186
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:43,580
Faster!

187
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,560
Save my wife!

188
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,800
I hired a porter

189
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,650
to take me back to Bingzhou.

190
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,600
I had no other choice.

191
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,130
I can only come to beg for your help.

192
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,210
I implore you, Magistrate,

193
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,760
please save Sister Liu.

194
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:01,960
Hya!

195
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,760
Please enjoy your meal, sir.

196
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,400
Miss Yu.

197
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,760
Why are we secretly following him?

198
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,560
Aren't you going to look for the Wuji Mirror?

199
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,160
We still have four days left.

200
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,960
The Xuanyuan Mirror is still missing.

201
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,440
I should be searching for it.

202
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,600
But Miss Liu has mysteriously disappeared.

203
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,760
How can I not help?

204
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,480
At Jile House,

205
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,520
Miss Liu saved my life.

206
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,680
Now that I know about this,

207
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,240
how can I stand by and do nothing?

208
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,160
Besides, if he tries to save her alone,

209
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,220
wouldn't that make us dishonorable?

210
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,640
I understand now.

211
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,320
He must have fallen for Miss Liu.

212
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,720
Miss Liu is so loyal and kind.

213
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,320
If he rescues her by himself,

214
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,280
she'll definitely offer herself to him in gratitude.

215
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:46,800
Then,

216
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,520
we'll be indebted to Miss Liu for life,

217
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:48,960
right?

218
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:52,820
Where is he?
