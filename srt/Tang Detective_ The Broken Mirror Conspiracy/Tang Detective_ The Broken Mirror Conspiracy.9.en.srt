1
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:07,400
Legend has it that there were four divine mirrors in ancient times.

2
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,520
The Xuanyuan Mirror could extend one's lifespan.

3
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,680
The Qin King's Bone-Viewing Mirror

4
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,920
could reveal the bones and meridians in a person's body.

5
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,640
The Six-Nose Mirror could reveal cause and effect.

6
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,640
The Wuji Mirror could heal wounds and pain.

7
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,400
Legend has it that this village has a magical spring.

8
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,120
Its water can extend one's lifespan.

9
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,450
That's why it's called Quanxian Village.

10
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,180
He actually came back to life.

11
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,340
Tough as nails.

12
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,560
Thank you for saving me, miss.

13
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,520
I wonder if you've seen

14
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,580
a man and two women?

15
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,120
I haven't seen any people,

16
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,920
but there are plenty of corpses.

17
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,079
Come give me a hand.

18
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:20,010
I'll take you to find your friends.

19
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:21,520
All right.

20
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,000
Yu!

21
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:30,560
Wolf!

22
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,079
Wuming!

23
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,600
I'm glad you're safe.

24
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:38,920
That's great!

25
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,640
Now we can dig one less grave.

26
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,000
Are you hurt?

27
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,160
No.

28
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,640
You've got some incredible luck, kid.

29
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,160
Both of us are covered in bruises,

30
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,360
our arms are swollen,

31
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,240
and you don't have a scratch on you.

32
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,560
Of course I'm tough.

33
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,480
Let's not talk about this now.

34
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,480
Where is Miss Liu?

35
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,180
What about Miss Liu's wounds?

36
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,480
We should thank this lady.

37
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,040
She's a mortician from Chang'an.

38
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,300
She prepared Miss Liu's body for burial.

39
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,960
May I ask your name?

40
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,920
Where do you live?

41
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,640
I will certainly visit to express my gratitude.

42
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,100
Chang'an. I'm Xu Qiniang.

43
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,840
No need to thank me.

44
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,560
I was already paid by the villagers

45
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,890
to retrieve the bodies.

46
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,640
Saving you

47
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,720
was just something I did along the way.

48
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,160
Preparing this lady's body

49
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,290
was also no trouble.

50
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,640
Consider it a good deed.

51
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,640
A river scavenger?

52
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:26,960
Yes.

53
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,040
Something's wrong with that river.

54
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,480
Bodies appear there frequently.

55
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,160
Over time, it becomes filled with dark energy

56
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,690
and attracts water ghosts.

57
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,850
The river runs below the cliff.

58
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:39,040
It's a perfect place for killers to dispose of bodies.

59
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:40,360
You all are quite lucky

60
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,680
not to have been dragged away as substitutes by water ghosts.

61
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,480
Substitutes?

62
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,520
There are no ghosts or spirits in this world.

63
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:49,579
Just people who use such superstitions to harm others.

64
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,880
How do you know there are no spirits?

65
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,060
If spirits punished evil,

66
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,960
why would we need imperial laws?

67
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,810
You're free to disbelieve,

68
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,770
but please help prepare these bodies for burial.

69
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,000
Someone who doesn't respect spirits...

70
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,330
why bother saving them?

71
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:08,880
Wuming,

72
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,480
give me a hand.

73
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,210
Hurry up!

74
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:17,760
Miss Liu,

75
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:19,640
rest in peace.

76
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,680
May you be reborn soon

77
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,130
and not suffer like this again.

78
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,340
I'll take that as a yes.

79
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,060
Thank you for your help, miss.

80
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,440
You won't even spare the female doctor?

81
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,800
Your eyes are practically glued to her.

82
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,360
How are your

83
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,320
injuries healing?

84
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,380
These minor wounds

85
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,440
mean nothing to someone of my destiny.

86
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,170
I'll be fine.

87
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,480
I just need two days of rest.

88
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,360
This time,

89
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,850
not only did I cause both of you to get hurt,

90
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,800
but I also failed to rescue Miss Liu.

91
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,920
How could there be such heartless people

92
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,980
who treat lives as worthless in our great Tang Dynasty?

93
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:31,920
Be careful.

94
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,840
Do you think

95
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,080
they gouged out so many young girls' eyes

96
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,480
just to make offerings to the mountain god?

97
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,970
It seems this matter

98
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,560
is not so simple.

99
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,700
Quanxian Village was named after its fairy spring.

100
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,800
Now the fairy spring of Quanxian Village

101
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,130
has become a pool of foul, stagnant water.

102
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,720
Perhaps this is why

103
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,800
the villagers of Quanxian

104
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,480
believed the sorcerers' deception

105
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,680
and helped them harm those young girls.

106
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,640
The village is so impoverished

107
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,040
likely because they spent all their money

108
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,970
buying girls for these sorcerers.

109
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,890
Deceived by sorcerers.

110
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,760
So that means

111
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,480
the ones behind all this

112
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,160
are those two criminals.

113
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,360
Do you think those villagers are really that stupid?

114
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,560
Those two evil sorcerers

115
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,000
they kill when ordered to kill

116
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
and gouge out eyeballs when told to.

117
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:20,920
That's right.

118
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,920
Get a new one.

119
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,400
It seems their dark rituals contaminated the sacred spring,

120
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,460
causing the water to become tainted.

121
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,920
The sorcerers used this to bewitch the villagers

122
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,250
for their own purposes.

123
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,480
It's a pity we couldn't kill those two sorcerers

124
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,540
to avenge Miss Liu.

125
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,520
After I recover,

126
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I'll use my tracking skills

127
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,810
to find those two demons

128
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,320
and bring them to justice

129
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,760
to avenge Miss Liu.

130
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,600
Your tracking technique

131
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,860
is indeed impressive,

132
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,080
but it only works if the trail is fresh.

133
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,050
We've delayed for days,

134
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,320
so tracking them

135
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,940
will be difficult now.

136
00:06:57,159 --> 00:06:57,840
Besides,

137
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,840
those villagers are deeply bewitched.

138
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,320
If we show up again,

139
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,280
they might attack us as a mob.

140
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,280
We can't just sit here and do nothing,

141
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,880
letting Miss Liu die in vain.

142
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,400
Of course not.

143
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,280
The key to this case

144
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,400
is to find out why those two demons

145
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,840
are removing people's eyes

146
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,770
and using blood for their rituals.

147
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,300
Are they trying to make

148
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,000
an elixir of immortality?

149
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,360
But I've never heard

150
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,480
of such evil methods for making elixirs.

151
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,120
Indeed.

152
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,320
They put Miss Liu's eyeballs

153
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,680
into her blood.

154
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,920
There's no reason for them

155
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,780
to come to such a remote mountain.

156
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,600
This ritual

157
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,970
depends most crucially

158
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,320
on that spring water.

159
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,520
Look.

160
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,000
But I still don't understand

161
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,880
what's with that spring water

162
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,480
and what this ancient mirror means.

163
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,600
The fairy spring can remove blood stasis

164
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,530
and heal the body

165
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,160
because of this ancient mirror.

166
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,570
This ancient mirror

167
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,880
must be the Disease-Free Mirror that Miss Yu has been looking for.

168
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,210
That's what I think too.

169
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,840
We both fell off the cliff at the same time.

170
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,000
I was unconscious in the water for a long time,

171
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,320
yet not only did I survive,

172
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,520
my body remained completely unharmed.

173
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,580
He actually survived.

174
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,450
He's tough as nails.

175
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,000
But this ancient mirror is so corroded.

176
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,130
Can it still be used?

177
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,400
Do you remember?

178
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:44,920
The symbols on the cave wall

179
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,160
that we saw?

180
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,760
One zhang away.

181
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,200
To reveal the cave's secrets.

182
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,720
Those strange symbols you recognize?

183
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,920
Those are secret symbols of the Tiangang Sect.

184
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,680
They're similar to the incantation

185
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,200
that old woman was chanting.

186
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,560
Tiangang Sect.

187
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,320
Master Tiangang.

188
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,040
Executive Producer

189
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:08,440
Presenter
