1
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:52,680
Using

2
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,200
the art of Purple Star divination

3
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,800
to fulfill

4
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,080
the Emperor's destined wishes.

5
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,840
I pray for the power of stars to protect our great Tang Dynasty.

6
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,360
I humbly beseech heavenly grace

7
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,440
to grant the Emperor ten more years of life.

8
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,800
Your Majesty, what's wrong?

9
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,039
Your Majesty!

10
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,039
Your Majesty!

11
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,680
Your Majesty!

12
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,520
Your Majesty!

13
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,039
Your Majesty!

14
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,080
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

15
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:04,600
You

16
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:05,720
must

17
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:06,680
pay!

18
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,039
The evil concubine has brought disaster to our nation.

19
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:12,720
She should be forced to become a nun and banished to the Cold Palace.

20
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,000
Order the Imperial Guards

21
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,530
to thoroughly investigate these evil deeds.

22
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,480
Assemble! Assemble!

23
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,600
Hurry!

24
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,400
The case of the stolen Xuanyuan Mirror

25
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,130
must be solved within ten days.

26
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,200
The purpose of this mission

27
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,320
and your identity as Imperial Guards

28
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,520
must not be revealed.

29
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,000
Once you find the Xuanyuan Mirror,

30
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,360
return to the capital immediately

31
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,720
and do not engage in unnecessary combat.

32
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,320
If you fail to find the Xuanyuan Mirror,

33
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,040
bring your heads when you return.

34
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:55,560
Here.

35
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,579
Dismissed.

36
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,480
Yu Jianying.

37
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,360
I'm here, sir.

38
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,200
Ying'er.

39
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,840
Please speak, Foster Father.

40
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,800
Within the imperial court,

41
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,120
there have always been criticisms about female soldiers in the Jinwu Guard.

42
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,680
If you can accomplish this mission,

43
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,880
you will surely silence those critics.

44
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,280
You must not disappoint me.

45
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,320
Moreover, among the Jinwu Guard,

46
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:20,200
you are the top expert in tracking and pursuing criminals.

47
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,600
I'm counting on you this time.

48
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:25,079
I will not fail your expectations.

49
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:31,520
Guards!

50
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,600
Go check over there.

51
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,160
Yes, sir.

52
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,860
The mirror thief's tracks

53
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:05,010
disappeared at the entrance of the Governor's mansion.

54
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,610
Could someone from the Governor's mansion be responsible?

55
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:14,920
Officer,

56
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,920
may I ask why there's such a commotion inside?

57
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,640
Today the Governor is hosting a banquet

58
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,040
to welcome Ambassador Hawule from the Western Regions.

59
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,370
No unauthorized persons allowed inside.

60
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,480
So this is the Governor's mansion.

61
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,760
I've been looking everywhere but couldn't find

62
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,620
my invitation.

63
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,680
Officer, please verify this.

64
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,080
So you're an honored guest of the Governor.

65
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:29,880
Forgive me.

66
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,480
Daniu!

67
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,200
Miss.

68
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,520
Please.

69
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,520
Thank you.

70
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,960
I've been traveling for days without a proper meal.

71
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,820
Time to enjoy some good food here.

72
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,100
Governor Fang.

73
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,880
I'd like to toast you.

74
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,600
You've gone to such great lengths

75
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,260
to entertain our delegation.

76
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,890
Hawule is deeply grateful.

77
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:10,600
To you.

78
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,480
It's nothing worth mentioning.

79
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:12,810
Come,

80
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,840
let's drink to our heart's content today.

81
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,500
Bottoms up!

82
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,100
Cheers!

83
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,130
Come, have another!

84
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,440
I heard the dancing girl you're presenting to His Majesty

85
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,280
is of exceptional beauty

86
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,800
and extraordinary dancing skill.

87
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,880
We've never had the privilege to see such Western beauty.

88
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,640
Might we have the honor of seeing her?

89
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,720
That's no difficulty at all.

90
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,080
At Governor Fang's request,

91
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,740
Hawule wouldn't dare refuse.

92
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,159
Guards!

93
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,500
Bring her here.

94
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:45,760
Go now!

95
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,130
Yes, sir.

96
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,170
She'll be here shortly.

97
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,280
Look, look!

98
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,120
How graceful!

99
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:02,920
Indeed!

100
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,640
Such figure!

101
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,840
Truly extraordinary!

102
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,480
Marvelous!

103
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,440
Look, look!

104
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,880
Look at her figure, her hands,

105
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,880
those movements!

106
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,960
Wonderful!

107
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,240
Excellent!

108
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,480
Stop right there!

109
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,920
You brazen thief! Drop your weapon!

110
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,360
There's a path in heaven you refuse to take.

111
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,200
Yet you insist on breaking into hell where there's no door.

112
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,400
Of all places to flee,

113
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,480
you chose Bingzhou.

114
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,880
Today, even with wings, you cannot escape.

115
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,140
Listen, you petty judicial officer,

116
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,680
your monthly salary is just a few taels.

117
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,680
Why risk your life

118
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,200
chasing me for three days and nights?

119
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,240
I only stole 5.4 taels of silver.

120
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,360
Is it really worth all this?

121
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:26,840
Wu Ming

122
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:27,770
How dare you!

123
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,810
I am hosting important guests.

124
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,320
And you've brought your thief-catching right into my residence.

125
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,240
Governor, sir,

126
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,000
this man is a serious criminal wanted by the court,

127
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,840
the notorious thief Minglang.

128
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,840
I have been tracking him for half a year.

129
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,960
If I have disturbed you,

130
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,560
please accept my apologies.

131
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,680
Ambassador, please don't be alarmed.

132
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,880
This is Wu Ming, a judicial officer of my prefecture.

133
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,280
This young man is quite talented.

134
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,400
He came to Bingzhou last year.

135
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,060
He has solved many cold cases.

136
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,570
Thief Minglang,

137
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,880
if you don't want to add another charge to your crimes,

138
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,360
release that dancing girl.

139
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,880
Then please order your men to let me go, Governor.

140
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,140
Then I'll release her.

141
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:02,920
You're still running.

142
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,360
Wolf.

143
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,880
You've been running for three days and nights.

144
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,600
Aren't you tired?

145
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,400
What Wolf?

146
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,840
I told you my name is Phantom Thief Mingwolf.

147
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,440
Phantom Thief Mingwolf.

148
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,120
I call you that because it's easier.

149
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:09,640
Stop running.

150
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,040
Why don't we take a break?

151
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:11,840
What do you mean easier?

152
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,770
You'd better...

153
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,280
Xuanyuan Mirror.

154
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,520
Thanks, miss.

155
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:21,900
Still running!
