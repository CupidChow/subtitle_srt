1
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,780
Li Chong, remnant of the former dynasty,

2
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,560
has been on the run until now.

3
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,320
Refusing to repent,

4
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,840
he robs households,

5
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,400
steals from gentry,

6
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,130
his crimes are heinous.

7
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,160
Sentenced to be executed at noon.

8
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,800
The time has come.

9
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,320
Proceed with execution.

10
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,400
Kneel down.

11
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,460
Kneel down now!

12
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:42,820
What's happening?

13
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,850
Is someone trying to rescue the prisoner?

14
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:51,240
Execute him immediately!

15
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,039
Why is the wind so strong?

16
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:03,640
Go

17
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:04,940
identify the body.

18
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:07,880
Yes, sir.

19
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,400
The coroner has confirmed the identity.

20
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,000
The prisoner is indeed dead.

21
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,200
Very good.

22
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,560
Come help here.

23
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,680
It's all my fault.

24
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:30,840
My fault.

25
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,780
This is not your fault.

26
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,900
Don't take it to heart.

27
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,860
Let's hurry up.

28
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,520
Don't delay the funeral arrangements.

29
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,480
What took you so long?

30
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,200
If you had come any later,

31
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,480
I would have suffocated to death.

32
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,600
How long has it been since you took a bath in prison, Wolf?

33
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,800
You stink.

34
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,250
Try being locked up in the imperial prison for a few days.

35
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,200
I am a bit smelly.

36
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,600
But it smelled quite nice in the coffin.

37
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,460
I thought it was my natural scent.

38
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,770
You're still laughing?

39
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,760
I was nearly scared to death.

40
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,000
Li Chong.

41
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,400
I'm sorry.

42
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,210
Why are you suddenly apologizing?

43
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,640
I'm fine, aren't I?

44
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,560
However,

45
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,560
it would have been better if you had given me a heads-up.

46
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,090
If we had given any warning,

47
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,040
your head

48
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,760
would have rolled.

49
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,840
The time has come.

50
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,240
Proceed with the execution.

51
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:05,900
Kneel down.

52
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,290
I said kneel!

53
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,690
What's going on?

54
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,940
Is someone trying to break up the execution?

55
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:21,320
Execute immediately!

56
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,240
Wuming

57
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,280
Miss Yu

58
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,480
You two saved my life.

59
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,200
Though I, Li Chong, am of noble birth,

60
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,200
I understand the principle that even a small favor

61
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,040
deserves great gratitude in return.

62
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,700
From now on,

63
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,450
I will stay by your side.

64
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,520
I'll face whatever enemies come,

65
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,880
and overcome any obstacle.

66
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,880
I'm willing to serve you both faithfully

67
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,810
with no regrets.

68
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:47,720
Wolf

69
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,290
When did you become so serious?

70
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,600
I'm not used to it yet.

71
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,730
What are you saying?

72
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,490
Haven't I always been serious?

73
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,400
It's about time to leave.

74
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,040
I don't want the authorities to know

75
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,240
that I'm hiding a dead fugitive in my home.

76
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:02,760
Mr. Xu,

77
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,250
thank you for your help.

78
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,760
Thanks to you today,

79
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,960
I was able to escape unharmed.

80
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,020
No need to thank me.

81
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,360
If Wuming hadn't blackmailed me

82
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,760
about killing my sister,

83
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:13,920
I wouldn't have helped.

84
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,560
What?

85
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,290
You killed your sister?

86
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,400
Mr. Xu,

87
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,320
you don't need to pretend anymore.

88
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,320
Actually, Miss Xu

89
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,260
is not dead.

90
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,240
You...

91
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,220
What nonsense are you talking about?

92
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,280
Didn't you replicate

93
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,560
all my methods of murder?

94
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:32,840
I...

95
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,000
I've already confessed to the murder.

96
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,200
Don't protect me

97
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,860
just because I helped you.

98
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,960
It's rare to see someone so eager to claim the title of murderer.

99
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,760
I'm asking for your help, Mr. Xu.

100
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,240
Actually, I wanted to verify my deduction.

101
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,280
What's wrong?

102
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,340
Is there a problem?

103
00:05:55,159 --> 00:05:55,960
This smell...

104
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,400
I understand now.

105
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,480
Among the debris that hit Miss Xu's box

106
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,880
there was a strange odor.

107
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,100
It's the same as

108
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,280
what we smelled last time in the secret room

109
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,610
at the paper craft shop.

110
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:16,720
This corpse

111
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,860
looks somewhat familiar.

112
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,330
It's that demon.

113
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,620
How did he end up dead here?

114
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:24,840
I knew it.

115
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,920
How could anyone be impervious to weapons?

116
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,880
This has the same smell

117
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,800
as the corpse Mr. Xu used to replace Li Chong.

118
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,730
What do you mean?

119
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,080
The same smell?

120
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,370
How does that prove Miss Xu isn't dead?

121
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,840
These bodies

122
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,400
all have one characteristic:

123
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,130
they don't decompose for days.

124
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,770
If my deduction is correct,

125
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:42,760
this smell

126
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,680
must come from a preservative

127
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,010
unique to the Xu family,

128
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:49,000
which can slow down the decomposition of corpses.

129
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,600
There's really no smell of decay

130
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,060
but rather a faint scent of medicinal herbs.

131
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,580
So what if there is?

132
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,840
My Xu family, as a lineage of morticians,

133
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,920
naturally has our own embalming compounds.

134
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,720
That's right.

135
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,760
It would be fine if it was just elsewhere.

136
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,680
But why

137
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,640
is there the same smell on Miss Xu's

138
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,760
damaged trunk?

139
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,040
That can only mean one thing.

140
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,320
That trunk

141
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,770
already contained a preserved corpse

142
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,120
with its face deliberately destroyed.

143
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:44,840
You mean

144
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,880
the dead person

145
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,080
was a corpse hidden in the box beforehand

146
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,080
not Miss Xu?

147
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,240
That's right.

148
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,120
Miss Xu must have

149
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,280
used the moment when the box fell toward her

150
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,409
to hide among the funeral procession.

151
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,880
Nonsense!

152
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,720
This is merely your speculation.

153
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,850
Where's your proof?

154
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,500
What evidence do you have?

155
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,460
Brother Xu.

156
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,980
Is your finger bothering you?

157
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,520
Is it because something is missing?

158
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:14,860
Brother Xu.

159
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,290
This finger guard belongs to you, doesn't it?

160
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,440
No.
