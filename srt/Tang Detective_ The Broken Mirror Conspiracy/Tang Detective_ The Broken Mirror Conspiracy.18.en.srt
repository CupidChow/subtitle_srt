1
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,840
There are major changes happening in Chang'an City.

2
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,400
I've emerged to save the people.

3
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,880
Could it be that Madam Qiu's murders

4
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:00,040
aren't just about stealing others' fortune?

5
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:00,560
No.

6
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,400
I need to go to the palace.

7
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,340
Do you know what time it is?

8
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,520
The palace gates are already closed.

9
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,600
Even during daytime without the Emperor's summons,

10
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,000
you cannot enter the palace as you please.

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,800
Even if I can't enter the palace,

12
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,760
I must report this to the Imperial Guards.

13
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,280
No.

14
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,160
Going to the Imperial Guards now

15
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,480
would be walking right into a trap.

16
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,810
What do you mean by that?

17
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,420
Wu Ming isn't Li Chong.

18
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,800
Why would he fear the Imperial Guards?

19
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,560
Do you know

20
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,130
that Madam Qiu's puppet formation

21
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,160
is stealing the Tang Dynasty's fortune?

22
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,680
This concerns the safety of the imperial family

23
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,680
and the lives of millions of citizens.

24
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,440
The Imperial Guards may choose to ignore it,

25
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,170
but I cannot.

26
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,440
What on earth are you talking about?

27
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,560
Why bring up the Imperial Guards again?

28
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,420
Such an unlucky thing to mention.

29
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:41,360
Miss Yu

30
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,640
is with the Imperial Guards,

31
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,840
so she naturally knows things we don't.

32
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,289
Since you already know,

33
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,330
I won't hide it anymore.

34
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,600
I am an undercover agent of the Imperial Guards,

35
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,240
tasked with investigating the theft of the divine mirror from Changsheng Temple.

36
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,040
What?

37
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,420
So I almost died at the execution ground.

38
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,199
All thanks to you.

39
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,680
I'm sorry.

40
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,360
I oversimplified things.

41
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,200
Miss Yu.

42
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,380
You can go back and report now.

43
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,780
At least your efforts following us weren't wasted.

44
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,280
That's right.

45
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,960
I revealed to the Imperial Guards

46
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,420
Li Chong's true identity.

47
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,530
Almost getting him killed.

48
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,400
But no matter what you think,

49
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,680
nobody is leaving this place today.

50
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,329
I know I've let you down.

51
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,800
I'm not asking for forgiveness.

52
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:54,410
We may never meet again.

53
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,810
All these years,

54
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,560
I've struggled within the Imperial Guard,

55
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,890
enduring countless contemptuous looks.

56
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,680
That was truly what I wanted.

57
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,640
Everything I've done in the Imperial Guard

58
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,570
was for our family's restoration.

59
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,680
Both of them treated me with sincerity.

60
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,440
As we part today,

61
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,960
I don't know when we'll meet again.

62
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,520
Miss Yu,

63
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,860
take care on your journey.

64
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,400
Farewell.

65
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,320
Miss Yu.

66
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,490
The shopkeeper says

67
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,200
this sachet can ward off evil

68
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,850
and is a gift for you.

69
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,280
It will keep you safe on your journey.

70
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:51,840
Miss Yu,

71
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,560
your father can finally be saved.

72
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,820
You no longer need to wander the jianghu.

73
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,570
That's wonderful! My father can be saved.

74
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,600
This matter began because of me,

75
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,610
so I will resolve it myself.

76
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:23,520
Miss Yu.

77
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,360
Excuse me.

78
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,600
Anyway, I have nothing but hatred for you two,

79
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,060
across all lands and seas.

80
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,560
How can you say that about us?

81
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,680
We've been so good to you.

82
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,010
I understand you criticizing him, but me?

83
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,880
You shouldn't face this alone.

84
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,490
Ridiculous.

85
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,000
You're just a minor legal officer from Bingzhou.

86
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,360
The General isn't someone you can see whenever you please.

87
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,480
I truly have important matters to report.

88
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,000
Please inform your superior.

89
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,560
Tell him a disciple of Master Tiangang seeks an audience.

90
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,680
Yu Jianying, the secret agent of the Imperial Guard, is also my close friend.

91
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,080
Disciple this, disciple that.

92
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,200
Close friend this, close friend that.

93
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,040
This is a restricted military area.

94
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,200
Stop making noise here.

95
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,330
Leave immediately.

96
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,690
Commander Fang.

97
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,210
Commander Fang.

98
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,080
My general has been waiting for you for a long time.

99
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,010
Commander Fang.

100
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,080
Wuming.

101
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,130
That's how it is.

102
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,760
I request that the general

103
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,280
immediately send someone to investigate in the palace.

104
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:45,000
This case sounds too absurd.

105
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,400
I cannot just take your word for it

106
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,400
and send the Imperial Guards to search the palace.

107
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,040
If we can find this

108
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,560
Xu Qiniang.

109
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,480
If we cannot find this Xu Qiniang

110
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,560
and disturb the tranquility of the palace

111
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,020
His Majesty will blame us.

112
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,960
That would be a capital offense.

113
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,600
Don't you agree, Commander Fang?

114
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,460
The general is absolutely right.

115
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,200
Wuming.

116
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,040
I know you are upright and honest

117
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,160
and have solved many strange cases.

118
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,000
You are a pillar of my Bingzhou Prefecture.

119
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,360
But this matter concerns the royal family.

120
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,840
It might even disturb His Majesty.

121
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,040
This is no child's play.

122
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,280
Do you have any evidence?

123
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,880
It's not time to reveal that yet.

124
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,040
Right now, Li Chong is with Xu Yan.

125
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,400
There is indeed no physical evidence.

126
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,660
But there is a witness.

127
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,440
The witness is now under protection.

128
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,760
But you're talking about Xu Qiniang's brother?

129
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,520
Yes.

130
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,040
Generally speaking, this case

131
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,159
is just about a missing woman from the lower class,

132
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:41,020
and her brother's one-sided statement to find her.

133
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,400
Even if there is a witness,

134
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,040
I don't think we should easily believe it.

135
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,370
The general is correct.

136
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,300
But does the general know,

137
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,260
if what Xu Yan says is true,

138
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,000
that someone can freely enter and exit the palace,

139
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,200
if something really happens in the palace,

140
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,659
His Majesty will blame us.

141
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,840
Wouldn't that be negligence of the Imperial Guards?

142
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,570
How dare you!

143
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,500
You, a mere judicial officer,

144
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,160
if Commander Fang and I weren't old military friends,

145
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,640
you wouldn't even be allowed into my camp.

146
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,120
What?

147
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,180
Are you trying to threaten me?

148
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,960
Brother, please calm down.

149
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,800
How dare Wuming threaten the general?

150
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,200
He's just doing his duty.

151
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,600
Commander Fang is right.

152
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,800
I'm just concerned for His Majesty.

153
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,960
I've offended the general

154
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,160
and beg for forgiveness.

155
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,360
Brother, what Wuming says makes sense.

156
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,460
How about this:

157
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,600
The Imperial Guards keep records of everyone entering and leaving the palace.

158
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,880
Brother, you can send someone

159
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,040
to go with Wuming to check.

160
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,080
If they discover suspicious people entering the palace,

161
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,610
we can make a decision then.

162
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,420
Let's follow my wise brother's suggestion.

163
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,130
General Xie.

164
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,480
These are the records from the past half month.

165
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,480
The entry and exit records for Anfu Gate, Shunyi Gate,

166
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,720
Yanxi Gate, Jingfeng Gate, Hanguang Gate,

167
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,080
Anshang Gate and Zhuque Gate

168
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:46,000
are all on the table.

169
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,640
Take your time checking them.

170
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,570
So many records.

171
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,730
How long will this take?

172
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,760
That's your problem.

173
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,159
Check them yourself.

174
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,200
I don't mean to trouble you, sir.

175
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,040
I have a close friend

176
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,040
named Yu Jianying

177
00:07:58,159 --> 00:07:59,560
who also works in the Imperial Guard.

178
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,440
I wonder if you

179
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,600
could ask her to come here

180
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,280
to help me.

181
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,760
Yu Jianying?

182
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:05,680
She's an undercover agent.

183
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,520
She's on a field mission

184
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,450
and hasn't been seen for many days.

185
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,440
Miss Yu didn't return to the Imperial Guard.

186
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,300
So where did she

187
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,120
