00:32:55,362 --> 00:32:56,682
I went

754
00:32:58,482 --> 00:33:00,242
far away to study.

755
00:33:03,242 --> 00:33:03,882
Then...

756
00:33:05,042 --> 00:33:06,882
Then I...

757
00:33:06,882 --> 00:33:07,522
I was very scared.

758
00:33:08,522 --> 00:33:09,202
Why?

759
00:33:10,658 --> 00:33:11,842
Because I was alone.

760
00:33:14,682 --> 00:33:16,522
When I was little,

761
00:33:16,522 --> 00:33:17,282
at 16,

762
00:33:18,122 --> 00:33:19,722
I carried

763
00:33:19,722 --> 00:33:22,322
my luggage to go study,

764
00:33:22,802 --> 00:33:24,442
to handle enrollment application,

765
00:33:24,522 --> 00:33:25,130
to

766
00:33:27,082 --> 00:33:28,122
find the dormitory.

767
00:33:29,802 --> 00:33:30,842
I was living

768
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:32,482
with my roommates.

769
00:33:32,482 --> 00:33:34,802
I left

770
00:33:36,202 --> 00:33:40,282
my family

771
00:33:42,282 --> 00:33:43,882
very early.

772
00:33:56,986 --> 00:33:59,168
We just lived our lives separately.

773
00:33:59,354 --> 00:33:59,874
Well,

774
00:33:59,874 --> 00:34:01,834
this time I got sick.

775
00:34:02,794 --> 00:34:03,914
We became a family.

776
00:34:10,634 --> 00:34:13,226
[From one person]

777
00:34:13,226 --> 00:34:20,650
[to a family again]

778
00:34:21,418 --> 00:34:22,474
So I really envy you.

779
00:34:22,474 --> 00:34:23,074
You know?

780
00:34:24,106 --> 00:34:25,554
Do you understand my envy for you?

781
00:34:25,706 --> 00:34:26,378
I understand.

782
00:34:26,378 --> 00:34:27,074
So...

783
00:34:27,146 --> 00:34:28,426
I envy you too.

784
00:34:28,426 --> 00:34:29,194
What do you envy about me?

785
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:31,074
What do you envy about me?

786
00:34:31,178 --> 00:34:33,258
Because I'm an actress?

787
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:33,834
Yes.

788
00:34:33,834 --> 00:34:35,714
But I studied fashion design before.

789
00:34:35,714 --> 00:34:37,834
Actually, anyone can be an actor.

790
00:34:38,394 --> 00:34:40,154
Yes, of course.

791
00:34:40,154 --> 00:34:40,954
Everyone can become an actor.

792
00:34:40,954 --> 00:34:42,354
I thought actors needed
to have educational background.

793
00:34:42,994 --> 00:34:43,914
Actors need to have educational background.

794
00:34:43,914 --> 00:34:44,458
Yes.

795
00:34:44,954 --> 00:34:46,634
Having an educational background

796
00:34:46,634 --> 00:34:47,394
is beneficial for actors.

797
00:34:47,394 --> 00:34:49,114
If an actor

798
00:34:49,114 --> 00:34:50,434
is just good-looking

799
00:34:50,434 --> 00:34:51,834
and that qualifies them to become actors,

800
00:34:51,834 --> 00:34:52,554
they

801
00:34:53,474 --> 00:34:54,674
wouldn't understand the script,

802
00:34:55,194 --> 00:34:56,594
know how to act,

803
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:57,914
or understand what others are saying.

804
00:34:57,914 --> 00:34:59,274
They wouldn't understand what the script is about.

805
00:35:03,154 --> 00:35:05,194
Doesn't your family raise cattle or something?

806
00:35:06,954 --> 00:35:07,754
My family...

807
00:35:11,114 --> 00:35:12,114
A little Teddy dog.

808
00:35:14,714 --> 00:35:16,194
You don't seem like a local dog.

809
00:35:17,274 --> 00:35:17,834
Baby.

810
00:35:17,834 --> 00:35:19,114
Don't bark, that's enough.

811
00:35:19,114 --> 00:35:19,714
Don't bark anymore.

812
00:35:20,274 --> 00:35:21,738
Don't bark anymore.

813
00:35:21,738 --> 00:35:22,354
That's enough.

814
00:35:22,994 --> 00:35:24,314
Good dog, don't bark anymore.

815
00:35:25,034 --> 00:35:26,074
Don't bark anymore.

816
00:35:26,074 --> 00:35:27,434
See, it's so quiet now.

817
00:35:28,234 --> 00:35:28,874
Alright.

818
00:35:28,874 --> 00:35:29,394
You're really good at training dogs.

819
00:35:29,394 --> 00:35:31,234
Alright, baby, don't bark anymore.

820
00:35:32,994 --> 00:35:33,754

A big smile.

825
00:36:03,034 --> 00:36:03,690
Does it look good?

826
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:04,522
Yes.

827
00:36:04,522 --> 00:36:05,314
Take a picture for me.

828
00:36:05,314 --> 00:36:06,594
I'll be in the same position as you.

829
00:36:06,858 --> 00:36:07,554
Alright.

830
00:36:07,554 --> 00:36:08,106
Okay.

831
00:36:13,954 --> 00:36:14,994

the stone mill for making Tsampa.

937
00:41:15,874 --> 00:41:16,754

Tsampa?

939
00:41:17,554 --> 00:41:18,274
Then it can

00:41:18,274 --> 00:41:19,874
turn into a small device.

941
00:41:22,354 --> 00:41:23,074

00:47:06,554 --> 00:47:07,634
he can make a pair for you.

1135
00:47:07,634 --> 00:47:08,234
Yes.

1136
00:47:08,554 --> 00:47:09,354
I want a pair.

1137
00:47:10,194 --> 00:47:11,914
Hurry up. Help me talk about the order.

1138
00:47:12,994 --> 00:47:14,034
Place the order.

1139
00:47:14,674 --> 00:47:15,474
Make an appointment.

1140
00:47:15,474 --> 00:47:16,634
Place the order.

1141
00:47:17,114 --> 00:47:19,234
When are you coming tomorrow?

1142
00:47:19,234 --> 00:47:20,634
When will you start making it?

1143
00:47:20,634 --> 00:47:21,194
This?

1144
00:47:21,954 --> 00:47:23,594
When do you need it?

1145
00:47:23,594 --> 00:47:26,154
Can you finish it in four days?

1146
00:47:26,154 --> 00:47:27,234
Four days?

1147
00:47:27,234 --> 00:47:28,594
When can you finish it?

1148
00:47:28,594 --> 00:47:30,154
Three and a half days.

1149
00:47:30,914 --> 00:47:32,354
Three and a half days.

1150
00:47:32,354 --> 00:47:33,074
The fourth day.

1151
00:47:33,074 --> 00:47:34,554
They can be picked up on the fourth day.

1152
00:47:34,554 --> 00:47:35,514
On the fourth day.

1153
00:47:36,594 --> 00:47:37,194
Price.

1154
00:47:37,954 --> 00:47:38,634
She asked how much.

1155
00:47:38,634 --> 00:47:39,674
Back then...

1156
00:47:39,674 --> 00:47:41,914
For the cloth shoes,

1157
00:47:42,714 --> 00:47:44,914
150 yuan a day.

1158
00:47:45,914 --> 00:47:46,754
150 yuan a day.

1159
00:47:48,354 --> 00:47:49,954
For four days... Three days?

1160
00:47:49,954 --> 00:47:50,994
Three days, right?

1161
00:47:50,994 --> 00:47:52,274
How much for three days?

1162
00:47:52,834 --> 00:47:54,314
150 plus 150 plus 150.

1163
00:47:54,314 --> 00:47:56,274
300... 450.

1164
00:47:56,274 --> 00:47:56,994
450 yuan.

1165
00:47:57,314 --> 00:47:57,962
Okay.

1166
00:47:58,674 --> 00:48:00,330
He is the only one
making it in the village.

1167
00:48:00,938 --> 00:48:02,274
- Right?
- He's good at it.

1168
00:48:02,274 --> 00:48:02,994
Is he the only one?

1169
00:48:02,994 --> 00:48:03,554
His craftsmanship is the best.

1170
00:48:03,554 --> 00:48:04,634
Other people don't make them?

1171
00:48:05,154 --> 00:48:06,354
Other people can't.

1172
00:48:07,234 --> 00:48:07,794
They don't know how.

1173
00:48:07,794 --> 00:48:08,914
Doesn't he pass on his skills?

1174
00:48:08,914 --> 00:48:09,594
No.

1175
00:48:09,594 --> 00:48:10,754
Why not?

1176
00:48:10,754 --> 00:48:12,474
Because no one wants to learn it.

1177
00:48:12,474 --> 00:48:13,274
No one wants to learn it.

1178
00:48:16,074 --> 00:48:17,754
[Why does no one want to learn it?]
Now no one inherits it.

1179
00:48:17,754 --> 00:48:19,634
[I want to learn it]
But I paid to learn it.

1180
00:48:19,634 --> 00:48:20,834
But you don't want to learn it?

1181
00:48:21,754 --> 00:48:22,794
I have never learned it.

1182
00:48:23,754 --> 00:48:24,514
How come?

1183
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:28,394
There is an old man

1184
00:48:28,394 --> 00:48:30,234
in this mountain area,

1185
00:48:30,234 --> 00:48:32,314
making such handicrafts.

1186
00:48:32,314 --> 00:48:34,594
Quietly doing it like this, all the time.

1187
00:48:35,274 --> 00:48:36,394
I can't see it under the sun.

1188
00:48:37,594 --> 00:48:39,234
Let me block the sunlight for you.

1189
00:48:39,554 --> 00:48:40,634
No one came to learn his skills.

1190
00:48:40,634 --> 00:48:42,354
No one would notice him.

1191
00:48:43,274 --> 00:48:44,354
After getting to know him,

1192
00:48:44,354 --> 00:48:45,794
I can feel

1193
00:48:45,794 --> 00:48:47,474
he wants to leave something behind.

1194
00:48:47,994 --> 00:48:49,154
Whether it's his work

1195
00:48:49,154 --> 00:48:50,434
or his skills.

1196
00:48:50,434 --> 00:48:52,514
He wants to leave them to future generations.

1197
00:48:52,834 --> 00:48:53,794
Actually, in him,

1198
00:48:53,794 --> 00:48:55,554
I see persistence.

1199
00:48:56,114 --> 00:48:58,474
The persistence of an artisan,

1200
00:48:58,474 --> 00:48:59,714
which I admire so much.

1201
00:49:01,514 --> 00:49:03,594
Grandpa can also play bone flute.

1202
00:49:03,594 --> 00:49:05,034
He made this himself.

1203
00:49:06,074 --> 00:49:06,994
This is from an eagle.

1204
00:49:06,994 --> 00:49:08,554
Made of eagle bones, right?

1205
00:49:09,194 --> 00:49:10,954
This is made of eagle bones.

1206
00:49:33,274 --> 00:49:34,074
Beautiful sound.

1207
00:49:34,074 --> 00:49:34,874
Applause.

1208
00:49:36,714 --> 00:49:38,274
Applaud, if you have nothing to do.

1209
00:49:39,154 --> 00:49:40,874
Everybody not holding anything should clap.

1210
00:49:43,194 --> 00:49:44,114
Such beautiful sound.

1211
00:49:45,514 --> 00:49:46,114
Does it look good?

1212
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:47,834
Good?

1213
00:49:49,354 --> 00:49:49,994
[Photo taken and edited by Rosy]
How about it?

1214
00:49:50,834 --> 00:49:51,674
Look, good?

1215
00:49:53,514 --> 00:49:54,274
Good.

1216
00:49:54,274 --> 00:49:54,914
Very good.

1217
00:49:55,594 --> 00:49:56,314
It's taken so nicely.

1218
00:49:56,314 --> 00:49:56,994
Is it good?

1219
00:49:57,914 --> 00:49:59,954
I'm old, and my hands dirty.

1220
00:50:00,474 --> 00:50:01,714
Very dirty.

1221
00:50:01,714 --> 00:50:02,834
No calluses,

1222
00:50:02,834 --> 00:50:03,994
no real skills.

1223
00:50:04,354 --> 00:50:05,754
This is your

1224
00:50:07,474 --> 00:50:08,394
medal.

1225
00:50:09,434 --> 00:50:10,874
A craftsman's medal.

1226
00:50:10,874 --> 00:50:13,234
This is why you're so great.

1227
00:50:13,234 --> 00:50:13,834
Right?

1228
00:50:16,914 --> 00:50:17,634
Medal.

1229
00:50:18,314 --> 00:50:18,834
Right?

1230
00:50:18,834 --> 00:50:19,514
Right.

1231
00:50:25,554 --> 00:50:26,394
Let me.

1232
00:50:27,114 --> 00:50:27,778
I'll do it.

1233
00:50:27,778 --> 00:50:28,434
It's okay.

1234
00:50:28,434 --> 00:50:29,154
Is this it, Grandpa?

1235
00:50:29,674 --> 00:50:30,314
Thank you so much.

1236
00:50:30,314 --> 00:50:31,434
Is it this patterned one?

1237
00:50:31,434 --> 00:50:32,594
Yes, right.

1238
00:50:33,394 --> 00:50:34,434
Look at us,

1239
00:50:34,994 --> 00:50:36,514
taking things from them.

1240
00:50:37,314 --> 00:50:38,994
We didn't even pay a deposit.

1241
00:50:40,514 --> 00:50:42,114
This is not finished yet.

1242
00:50:42,114 --> 00:50:43,394
Why don't you take this one instead?

1243
00:50:43,794 --> 00:50:44,714
What?

1244
00:50:44,714 --> 00:50:45,714
This is not finished yet.

1245
00:50:45,714 --> 00:50:46,874
Why don't you take this one instead?

1246
00:50:47,074 --> 00:50:47,834
This is already finished.

1247
00:50:47,834 --> 00:50:48,474
This is yours.

1248
00:50:48,474 --> 00:50:50,834
It's okay.

1249
00:50:51,354 --> 00:50:52,074
It looks so good.

1250
00:50:52,914 --> 00:50:54,114
Do you want to try it on?

1251
00:50:54,114 --> 00:50:55,074
Show it.

1252
00:50:55,074 --> 00:50:55,954
Okay.

1253
00:50:58,034 --> 00:50:59,354
But I don't have a dress like yours.

1254
00:50:59,354 --> 00:51:00,634
Will it look very strange.

1255
00:51:00,634 --> 00:51:02,114
If you don't mind, you can wear mine.

1256
00:51:02,114 --> 00:51:02,754
Do you mind?

1257
00:51:02,754 --> 00:51:03,954
I don't mind.

1258
00:51:03,954 --> 00:51:04,554
I'll get it.

1259
00:51:04,554 --> 00:51:05,394
Okay.

1260
00:51:06,354 --> 00:51:07,274
So, when she comes back...

1261
00:51:08,194 --> 00:51:09,754
Which one do you want to wear?

1262
00:51:11,682 --> 00:51:12,274
See if you want...

1263
00:51:12,274 --> 00:51:13,554
So formal!

1264
00:51:13,554 --> 00:51:14,714
I feel like I'm going to walk on the red carpet.

1265
00:51:14,714 --> 00:51:15,474
Babe, take this.

1266
00:51:15,474 --> 00:51:16,714
Can you help me hold this? It's heavy.

1267
00:51:17,634 --> 00:51:18,954
I'll wear...

1268
00:51:19,634 --> 00:51:21,114
Can I choose whatever I want?

1269
00:51:21,114 --> 00:51:22,034
Yes.

1270
00:51:22,034 --> 00:51:23,674
What is the...

1271
00:51:23,674 --> 00:51:25,090
Is there any difference?

1272
00:51:25,346 --> 00:51:25,874
The color.

1273
00:51:25,874 --> 00:51:26,850
It doesn't matter, right?

1274
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:27,354
Yes.

1275
00:51:27,354 --> 00:51:29,026
So I can choose whatever I want?

1276
00:51:29,026 --> 00:51:29,634
Choose one.

1277
00:51:29,634 --> 00:51:30,914
I'll choose this one.

1278
00:51:30,914 --> 00:51:31,434
Black!

1279
00:51:31,434 --> 00:51:32,074
Yes.

1280
00:51:32,074 --> 00:51:32,914
There's also this one.

1281
00:51:32,914 --> 00:51:33,594
Then I'll choose this one.

1282
00:51:33,594 --> 00:51:34,794
You want to wear the black one?

1283
00:51:34,794 --> 00:51:35,314
Okay.

Thank you.

1285
00:51:36,194 --> 00:51:37,234
You're so slim.

1286
00:51:37,234 --> 00:51:38,114
Not really.

1287
00:51:40,634 --> 00:51:41,554
You have a great body shape.

1288
00:51:41,554 --> 00:51:42,234
Thank you.

1289
00:51:47,074 --> 00:51:48,674
Feels like dopamine style.

1290

Dopamine style.

1291
00:51:51,314 --> 00:51:53,754
Do you know how to dance Tibetan dance?

1292
00:51:53,754 --> 00:51:54,354
No.

1293
00:51:54,354 --> 00:51:55,874
I'll teach you. Just like this.

1294
00:51:55,874 --> 00:51:57,154
Dance like this.

1295
00:51:57,154 --> 00:51:58,354
Aren't you going to teach me?

1296

Let Yongji dance.

1297
00:51:59,954 --> 00:52:00,802
She dances very well.

1298
00:52:00,802 --> 00:52:01,394
Yes.

1299
00:52:01,394 --> 00:52:03,074
Yes, she dances very well.

1300
00:52:03,074 --> 00:52:04,194

1301

Yes, she is professional.

1302

So lively.

1303
00:52:18,114 --> 00:52:19,994
Her paces are so fast.

1304
00:52:21,314 --> 00:52:22,554
She already learned it.

1305
00:52:26,634 --> 00:52:27,674
Do you know why I love

short video app?

1307
00:52:28,234 --> 00:52:30,234
Because I can only do upper body moves.

1308
00:52:34,674 --> 00:52:35,674
Very impressive.

1309
00:52:37,474 --> 00:52:38,994
Already started to grasp it.

1310
00:52:38,994 --> 00:52:40,434
Very good, the next step.

1311
00:52:41,794 --> 00:52:43,514
I seem to have got the rhythm.

1312
00:52:44,354 --> 00:52:45,074
Yes.

1313
00:52:45,074 --> 00:52:46,274

1328

01:02:43,618 --> 01:02:44,338
I quite like it.

1508
01:02:44,338 --> 01:02:46,058
I like it so much.

1509
01:02:46,058 --> 01:02:46,858
You like it so much?

1510
01:02:47,218 --> 01:02:47,938
Really.

1511
01:02:47,938 --> 01:02:50,258
It's a billion times better than I imagined.

1512
01:02:50,258 --> 01:02:52,058
I feel it's better than in the city.

1513
01:02:52,058 --> 01:02:53,258
Well,

1514
01:02:53,258 --> 01:02:55,618
I don't feel it's hard to adapt at all

1515
01:02:55,618 --> 01:02:59,458
or uncomfortable or something.

1516
01:02:59,458 --> 01:03:01,498
Yes, I feel the people here are very hospitable.

1517
01:03:01,498 --> 01:03:03,458
In the city, everyone is busy.

1518
01:03:03,458 --> 01:03:04,178
Here, people are...

1519
01:03:04,178 --> 01:03:05,578
Every time, we meet someone...

1520
01:03:05,578 --> 01:03:07,978
They listen carefully when we speak.

1521
01:03:07,978 --> 01:03:08,658
Yes.

1522
01:03:08,658 --> 01:03:09,738
When I say hello to a grandpa,

1523
01:03:09,738 --> 01:03:10,778
he's like "Hello."

1524
01:03:10,778 --> 01:03:11,658
Yes.

1525
01:03:11,658 --> 01:03:12,698
Very hospitable.

1526
01:03:14,298 --> 01:03:15,578
Hello, Grandma.

1527
01:03:19,338 --> 01:03:20,058
Hello, Sir.

1528
01:03:20,298 --> 01:03:21,058
Hello.

1529
01:03:29,098 --> 01:03:29,858
Let's sit over there.

1530
01:03:29,858 --> 01:03:31,098
I feel it's warmer over there.

1531
01:03:34,218 --> 01:03:35,618
Oh, I need to apply some allergy medicine for you.

1532
01:03:38,338 --> 01:03:39,378
Why do I need to apply this?

1533
01:03:42,898 --> 01:03:43,738
What happened?

1534
01:03:44,218 --> 01:03:45,058
Altitude stress.

1535
01:03:46,098 --> 01:03:46,938
Really?

1536
01:03:46,938 --> 01:03:48,498
With altitude stress, it came out.

1537
01:03:51,218 --> 01:03:52,338
Why with altitude stress,

1538
01:03:52,338 --> 01:03:54,218
the things inside will spray out?

1539
01:03:54,218 --> 01:03:55,338
Why does it bulge?

1540
01:03:55,698 --> 01:03:56,898
Because of the air pressure.

1541
01:03:59,098 --> 01:04:00,218
What is air pressure?

1542
01:04:09,098 --> 01:04:10,938
Didn't you learn it in 7th grade?

1543
01:04:12,378 --> 01:04:13,018
We probably

1544
01:04:13,018 --> 01:04:14,818
will learn it next semester.

1545
01:04:20,722 --> 01:04:21,490
Be careful.

1546
01:04:25,458 --> 01:04:26,194
Thrilling.

1547

[Be Myself will come back soon]

1548
01:04:36,410 --> 01:04:40,544

1549
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:47,930

1550
01:04:50,810 --> 01:04:51,650
Be careful.

1551
01:04:55,650 --> 01:04:56,370
Exciting.

1552
01:05:14,850 --> 01:05:15,530
Don't you feel

1553
01:05:15,530 --> 01:05:17,810
these people are very interesting?

1554
01:05:19,410 --> 01:05:20,650
Really, I feel...

1555
01:05:24,090 --> 01:05:25,930
Sometimes, I feel very touched.

1556
01:05:27,770 --> 01:05:28,490
For example?

1557
01:05:30,090 --> 01:05:31,050
Right. You know what?

1558
01:05:31,050 --> 01:05:32,010
Last night,

1559
01:05:32,010 --> 01:05:33,650
before I went to sleep,

1560
01:05:33,650 --> 01:05:34,410
Tudou told me

1561
01:05:34,410 --> 01:05:36,850
if I needed to go to the bathroom

1562
01:05:36,850 --> 01:05:37,930
or couldn't find something,

1563
01:05:37,930 --> 01:05:39,410
I must wake him up at night.

1564
01:05:39,410 --> 01:05:40,210
Then I said no need.

1565
01:05:40,210 --> 01:05:41,290
He said, "You must wake me up,"

1566
01:05:41,570 --> 01:05:42,770
[Nao's night adventure]
"if you go somewhere."

1567
01:05:42,770 --> 01:05:44,170
[It's a must. Okay.]

1568
01:05:44,170 --> 01:05:44,890
Then I said okay.

1569
01:05:44,890 --> 01:05:46,650
After I woke up later,

1570
01:05:46,650 --> 01:05:48,490
I wanted to drink a glass of hot water.

1571
01:05:48,490 --> 01:05:50,050
But I couldn't find hot water

1572
01:05:50,050 --> 01:05:51,370
and I didn't know where it was.

1573
01:05:51,370 --> 01:05:53,090
So I woke up

1574
01:05:53,090 --> 01:05:53,930
Tudou.

1575
01:05:56,250 --> 01:05:58,090
He boiled water for me.

1576
01:05:58,090 --> 01:05:59,610
Then the circuit breaker tripped

1577
01:06:00,010 --> 01:06:01,570
and it exploded.

1578
01:06:01,970 --> 01:06:02,930
I was very scared.

1579
01:06:02,930 --> 01:06:04,890
At that time, he was very brave.

1580
01:06:04,890 --> 01:06:05,770
After the circuit breaker tripped,

1581
01:06:05,770 --> 01:06:08,930
he quickly unplugged the charger

1582
01:06:10,450 --> 01:06:12,250
and then the others were also woken up.

1583
01:06:12,490 --> 01:06:13,170
At that time,

1584
01:06:13,170 --> 01:06:14,970
I was very... How should I put it?

1585
01:06:14,970 --> 01:06:16,850
I felt very uncomfortable.

1586
01:06:16,850 --> 01:06:18,010
Because after I woke up,

1587
01:06:18,010 --> 01:06:19,570
I ended up waking everyone up.

1588
01:06:19,570 --> 01:06:20,130
So...

1589
01:06:22,250 --> 01:06:23,250
You felt a bit guilty.

1590
01:06:23,250 --> 01:06:25,050
Yes. Then he didn't blame me.

1591
01:06:27,490 --> 01:06:28,810
I think you don't have to feel guilty.

1592
01:06:28,810 --> 01:06:30,530
Because the tripped circuit breaker

1593
01:06:30,530 --> 01:06:32,050
wasn't caused by you.

1594
01:06:33,530 --> 01:06:35,930
They sincerely wanted to be good to you.

1595
01:06:36,930 --> 01:06:37,570
Do you understand?

1596
01:06:45,690 --> 01:06:47,170
I remember when you were filming the commercial,

1597
01:06:47,170 --> 01:06:49,290
your mom was almost crying.

1598
01:06:49,290 --> 01:06:49,890
She hadn't seen it before.

1599
01:06:49,890 --> 01:06:51,250
I didn't tell you that.

1600
01:06:51,250 --> 01:06:52,010
What do you mean?

1601
01:06:52,730 --> 01:06:53,930
They haven't really seen me

1602
01:06:53,930 --> 01:06:55,170
when I am at work.

1603
01:06:57,050 --> 01:06:58,250
They also feel

1604
01:07:00,130 --> 01:07:01,450
that I'm doing so well now,

1605
01:07:01,450 --> 01:07:02,530
so I shouldn't complain.

1606
01:07:03,010 --> 01:07:04,610
They're also like this, actually.

1607
01:07:07,970 --> 01:07:08,770
Well,

1608
01:07:09,850 --> 01:07:12,010
they're not biased toward me, you know?

1609
01:07:12,730 --> 01:07:13,610
They're not biased.

1610
01:07:13,610 --> 01:07:15,410
They're quite fair and just.

1611
01:07:21,370 --> 01:07:23,370
So I don't talk about unhappy things

1612
01:07:23,370 --> 01:07:24,410
at home.

1613
01:07:27,050 --> 01:07:28,050
I won't talk about unhappy things.

1614
01:07:47,850 --> 01:07:48,530
Sometimes,

1615
01:07:48,530 --> 01:07:50,570
they just can't help you share any pressure.

1616
01:07:50,570 --> 01:07:51,730
But it feels like...

1617
01:07:51,730 --> 01:07:52,330
Do you still remember

1618
01:07:52,330 --> 01:07:53,010
when filming "Love's Ambition",

1619
01:07:53,010 --> 01:07:54,050
I didn't want to tell my parents.

1620
01:07:54,050 --> 01:07:55,130
I just wanted to talk to you.

1621
01:07:55,988 --> 01:07:56,666

Right?

1624
01:07:58,172 --> 01:07:59,061
Yeah.

1625
01:08:06,530 --> 01:08:07,650
Can I take a look at this?

1626
01:08:08,290 --> 01:08:09,290
What's so interesting about this?

1627
01:08:09,690 --> 01:08:11,450
This feels so cute.

1628
01:08:11,450 --> 01:08:12,770
How to use this, like this?

1629
01:08:12,770 --> 01:08:14,130
Reversed.

1630
01:08:14,130 --> 01:08:14,930
Like this.

1631
01:08:16,026 --> 01:08:17,266
Actually, it is quite useful.

1632
01:08:18,362 --> 01:08:19,762
Look, for example, when I'm standing now,

1633
01:08:19,762 --> 01:08:22,082
actually, my weight is all on the cane.

1634
01:08:22,082 --> 01:08:22,682
Really?

1635
01:08:22,682 --> 01:08:23,962
Really. If you take the cane away,

1636
01:08:23,962 --> 01:08:25,242
I will fall.

1637
01:08:25,242 --> 01:08:25,962
Let me try.

1638
01:08:26,442 --> 01:08:26,962
Don't fall.

1639
01:08:26,962 --> 01:08:27,522
I'll hold you.

1640
01:08:27,522 --> 01:08:28,626

01:08:32,002 --> 01:08:33,802
Actually, it's very comfortable.

Well,

1645
01:08:34,402 --> 01:08:36,362
if I stood like this before,

1646
01:08:36,362 --> 01:08:38,562
my legs had no strength

1647
01:08:38,562 --> 01:08:39,922
and I might not be able to stand for long.

1648
01:08:39,922 --> 01:08:41,362
I might want to lean on something.

1649

If I have a cane, whatever I do,

1650
01:08:43,762 --> 01:08:45,362
I just need to lean on it.

1651
01:08:45,362 --> 01:08:46,762
It gives me a sense of security.

1652

I felt quite calm.
