It's true.

565
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,280
The big goose is protecting the little goose.

566
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,280
The big goose is obviously afraid

567
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,120

568
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,560
How can they have such good emotions?

569
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,400
Let them play by themselves, Zhaxi.

570
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:47,840
We are about to

571
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:48,960

Okay, you can taste

574
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,400

radish dumplings

578
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,040
Radish dumplings are so big.

579
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:09,600
Yes.

580
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:10,680
And this is

Sit down.

587
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,640
As if this is my home.

588
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,280
Can I taste it?

589
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,080
Yes.

590

Thank you.

591

Sweet.

592
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,800
Do you want to eat it with some buttered tea?

593
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,360
It has a wheat fragrance.

if you are used to eating it.

598

What's wrong? What does it taste like?

599
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,360
You can taste it.

600

Taste it.

601
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,200
I will taste half of it.

602

Just in case, right?

603
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:46,520
It's okay.

to grind it.

609
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,280
And then

Tug-of-war competition, and running competition.

677

What's going on here?

979

Do you mean a spider web?

Don't look at the camera.

981
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,760
You made that expression too early.

982
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:25,640
Too stiff.

Why is there no network?

These are the stars I photographed at night.

988
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,440
This is much better than that

989
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:24,360
in our big city.

990
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:26,560
This is the sunrise over the golden mountains.

991
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:29,440
Guess what this is.

992
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:31,080
What is this?

993
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:33,080
This is a flower stuck in cow dung.

994
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:34,400
Although it smells a bit,

995
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,520
it's quite pretty.

996
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:38,440

- Okay.

1012
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:04,640
The one against the light,

1013
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:05,960
and then the two brothers walk by.

1014
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:07,080
The one where the two walk by together

1015
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:07,880
was shot really well.

1016
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:10,960
Just mainly trying to express something.

00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:29,360
Actually, the depth...

1026
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:31,440
Art is not...

1027
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:32,760

It just has some details inside.

1035

It's like a flower growing on cow dung.

1036
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:03,200
What it wants to express is

1037
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:04,760
that not everything

1038
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:06,840
is absolutely good or bad.

1039
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:07,760
It is mainly through

1040
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,080
your own perception

1041
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:10,560

There is a part...

1044

It says in the clip

1045
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,080
that this is a worn out basketball, right?

1046
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:18,800
This ball is a bit worn out.

1047
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,440
A worn out basketball is like,

he took off his adult disguise

1049

and then became his childhood self.

1050
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:25,240
Then, the next part goes back to his childhood.

he threw while wearing urban clothes,

1055
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:37,880
but found his sleeve dirty and stopped throwing.

1056
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:39,240
Then he dusted off his sleeve.

1057
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:41,320
Finally, his brother helped him

1058
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:43,200
put on the clothes
he used to wear in the countryside,

1059
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:44,560

1064

Skipping stones is to show the use of uselessness.
