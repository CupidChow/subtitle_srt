195
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,240
Just kidding. It's okay.

196
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,320
Can you guys teach her how to play?

197
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,320
She wants to play too.

198
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,280
No,

199
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,560
I want to watch them play.

200
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,720
How do you know if it's fun without trying it?

201
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,920
Look, I can play too.

202
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,360
Look.

203
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,640
Sorry.

204
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,080
Come on.

205
00:08:59,080 --> 00:08:59,680
I'll try it.

206
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,320
Grab it like this.

207
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,200
Yeah.

208
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,040
Tilt your body a bit.

209
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:05,720
Squat a bit.

210
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,400
Got it?

211
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,200
Feel it?

212
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,000
Yeah.

213
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,520
Try it.

214
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,280
Do you know how to serve?

215
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:16,960
Very good.

216
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,040
Careful. Like this.

217
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:20,960
Look.

218
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,800
Do you...

219
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,680
Do you want to eat something, Zhaxicuo?

220
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,680
Sure.

221
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,840
I really like you.

222
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,080
Yongji, get her something to eat.

223
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,440
Yongji's photos are amazing, you know?

224
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,280
Did you know before?

225
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,000
I didn't know.

226
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,480
Show her the photos.

227
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,680
She takes great photos.

228
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,200
Really?

229
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,680
Look, look at her photos.

230
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,520
[Photographer, Zeren Yongji]
She takes great photos.

231
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,280
She's even better than many photographers.

232
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,280
You look great in the Tibetan costume.

233
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:53,920
Me?

234
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:54,240
Yeah.

235
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:54,848
Thank you.

236
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,000
She takes great pictures.

237
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,560
Are you here for fun?

238
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,040
Yeah.

239
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,160
I came to hang out with them.

240
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:03,680
Really?

241
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,200
Yeah.

242
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,720
How did you...

243
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,680
Did you know each other?

244
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,280
We met when we were one year old.

245
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,840
We were born together.

246
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,080
No, we...

247
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,040
A bit like you.

248
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,280
This is my dad.

249
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,160
Good-looking.

250
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,640
Yeah.

251
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,840
Is this a cat or a dog?

252
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,280
It looks like a cat.

253
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,200
It's black.

254
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,000
My aunt has one.

255
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,680
Our cat gave birth to it.

256
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:55,680
[A new friend arrives
and brings a little disappointment.]

257
00:10:57,394 --> 00:11:06,624
[Pride and disappointment are at odds, with a hint
of possessiveness, how can she express herself?]

258
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,160
You need to control its direction.

259
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,040
Your bat has been

260
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,400
facing this way.

261
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,800
You need to control its direction.

262
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,920
Keep it straight

263
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,840
and it'll hit the center.

264
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,920
Otherwise, it will go over there.

265
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,240
Where did you go, Yongji?

266
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,000
Where did you go?

267
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,840
Your brother brought you that thing.

268
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,000
Thank you.

269
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,200
What's wrong?

270
00:11:36,305 --> 00:11:36,896
[Nothing.]

271
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,320
What's wrong?

272
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,080
[Nothing.]

273
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,360
Something's wrong. What is it?

274
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:41,760
I won't know

275
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,760
what's wrong unless you tell me.

276
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,520
I can't guess what it is.

277
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,760
What's wrong, Yongji?

278
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:48,680
What's wrong?

279
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,024
[Nothing.]

280
00:11:49,425 --> 00:11:55,480
[There is a touch of emotion hidden in "nothing".]

281
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,320
What's wrong?

282
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,080
Nothing.

283
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:58,960
Still "nothing"?

284
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,360
Tell me.

285
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,400
If you trust me.

286
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,640
If you tell me...

287
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,360
Trust me.

288
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,120
I will solve it for you, right?

289
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:08,640
Right?

290
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,320
Tell me.

291
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,280
I don't think

292
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,120
she wants to talk about her concerns.

293
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,040
I'm not very good at dealing

294
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:28,960
with this kind of situation.

295
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:33,920
Baozi.

296
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,080
Baozi, what's wrong?

297
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,080
Baozi, don't be afraid.

298
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,160
Come on.

299
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,040
Baozi, come on.

300
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,560
Baozi, come on.

301
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,760
Let's go, Baozi.

302
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,280
It's okay, don't be afraid.

303
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,000
Let me touch you.

304
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,560
Don't be afraid.

305
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,400
Baozi, don't be afraid.

306
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,240
Why are you scared?

307
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,200
What's wrong?

308
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,200
Baozi, don't be afraid.

309
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:03,600
Come here.

310
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:04,800
Baozi, come on.

311
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:06,960
Baozi.

312
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:09,960
It was scared to tears.

313
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,160
But I don't know why.

314
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,880
It might have never left home.

315
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,760
Let's take it back.

316
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,120
We'll send the dog home

317
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,000
and come back.

318
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,080
Tudou and I will go.

319
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,520
Try to figure out

320
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,600
why you were upset.

321
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,520
Okay.

322
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,560
I think it can walk now.

323
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,800
Baozi, good boy. Let's go.

324
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,344
Look.

325
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,040
It might have been scared.

326
00:13:46,201 --> 00:13:50,816
[It's normal for people to be upset.
But we have to know the cause.]

327
00:13:50,816 --> 00:13:53,200
I just need to know why.

328
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,560
But I don't know

329
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,960
why she was upset.

330
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,520
She wouldn't tell me

331
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,680
when I asked her.

332
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,560
So I don't know what to do.

333
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,200
You don't really

334
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,920
talk about it when you feel upset,

335
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,360
do you?

336
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,360
No, we don't.

337
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:08,928
Then...

338
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,280
Then maybe she's just

339
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,520
upset inside

340
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,400
and doesn't want to talk about it.

341
00:14:13,943 --> 00:14:15,808
[Do you think she is happy?]

342
00:14:15,808 --> 00:14:18,880
[I don't think so.]

343
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,280
Baozi is back.

344
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,280
Bye, Grandpa.

345
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,464
Grandpa, bye.

346
00:14:22,464 --> 00:14:23,040
Bye.

347
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:23,744
Let's go.

348
00:14:23,744 --> 00:14:24,360
Let's go.

349
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,120
Let's go.

350
00:14:26,144 --> 00:14:27,280
[She and emotions]

351
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,840
Do you know why she's unhappy?

352
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,520
No.

353
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,000
I have no idea.

354
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,320
But you're her big brother.

355
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,920
Does her mom know?

356
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:36,960
Does Mom know?

357
00:14:38,247 --> 00:14:39,456
[Mom favors the little brother.]

358
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,240
She's the second child

359
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,720
among the three.

360
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,880
She can easily be overlooked.

361
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,880
The parents probably

362
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,760
invested the most in the first child.

363
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,640
And they have to

364
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,160
take great care

365
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,760
of the youngest child.

366
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,720
So I think...

367
00:14:56,756 --> 00:14:58,816
[She needs attention.]

368
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:02,040
Firstly, her grades are not good.

369
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,600
Secondly, our little brother has good grades.

370
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,120
And Mom thinks

371
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,280
whatever he says

372
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,320
must be right.

373
00:15:12,055 --> 00:15:14,720
[I was very much like her when I was young.]

374
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,160
I can even recall

375
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,640
the frustration from childhood.

376
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,560
I wanted to learn,

377
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,960
but I couldn't.

378
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,240
I have no siblings.

379
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:25,800
I also feel

380
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,320
that no one defends me.

381
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,400
And I had poor grades when I was little.

382
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,560
I was bad at everything.

383
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:31,880
I just felt

384
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,120
that I was unnecessary.

385
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,800
I'm an unnecessary member of my family.

386
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,400
She has said similar things.

387
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,680
She said that, right?

388
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,200
Yeah.

389
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,280
She tends to defend Mom.

390
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,880
She takes our mom's side.

391
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,360
In the end, Mom's favorite wasn't her.

392
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,120
It was our little brother.

393
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,520
She loves Mom more, right?

394
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,560
Let's sit a bit.

395
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,400
Dad sometimes

396
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,200
criticizes Mom.

397
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,280
It's Yongji

398
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,800
who defends Mom.

399
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,560
When your dad criticizes your mom,

400
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:06,160
Yongji usually takes your mom's side.

401
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,160
Right?

402
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,440
She speaks up for Mom.

403
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,400
But

404
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,640
when she needs Mom to defend her,

405
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,000
Mom is against her

406
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,032
and defends our little brother.

407
00:16:16,032 --> 00:16:16,640
So,

408
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,080
do you think it's her fault

409
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,640
or her little brother's fault in this conflict?

410
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,640
Both of them are at fault.

411
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,680
Both of them are at fault?

412
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,184
So your mom shouldn't take a side.

413
00:16:25,184 --> 00:16:25,760
Right?

414
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,800
They should acknowledge their mistakes

415
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,320
and apologize to each other.

416
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,280
In your perspective,

417
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:30,880
your mom

418
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,288
shouldn't defend either of them.

419
00:16:32,288 --> 00:16:32,920
Right?

420
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:33,632
Yeah.

421
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,240
I see.

422
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,320
What do you want to do in the future?

423
00:16:47,904 --> 00:16:48,560
Me?

424
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,080
What do you want to do when you grow up?

425
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:51,440
Be a soldier.

426
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:52,720
A soldier.

427
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,080
A soldier? You want to join the army?

428
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,480
Yes.

429
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,000
Enter the military academy?

430
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:58,520
What's wrong?

431
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,160
Sounds good.

432
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,320
And it suits you.

433
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,560
Soldiers suffer physical challenges.

434
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,120
Others suffer

435
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,480
psychological challenges.

436
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,400
You won't see your family for years.

437
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:11,800
It's okay.

438
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,760
That's called handsome.

439
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:16,960
That's called courage.

440
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:17,960
That's called willpower.

441
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,800
That is true.

442
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,440
My dad used to be a soldier in Beijing.

443
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:23,968
Before.

444
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,480
You can talk with him.

445
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,240
He also thinks so.

446
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,680
He often shows me

447
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,840
photos from

448
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:33,600
his army days.

449
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,800
I think that was when

450
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,760
he looked the most handsome.

451
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,040
Your brother is here.

452
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:41,680
He's coming.

453
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,240
He is here.

454
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,440
No wonder it took so long.

455
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,280
You're here all along.

456
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,560
Do you like your brother?

457
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:56,720
Yes?

458
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,280
Yes.

459
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,240
Although you're the youngest,

460
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,720
I think you are the most mature.

461
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,520
At home,

462
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,680
you are your brother's

463
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,440
best partner, right?

464
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,040
Yeah.

465
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:08,992
You are a man, right?

466
00:18:08,992 --> 00:18:09,720
Yes.

467
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:10,360
You are a man.

468
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,120
Right.

469
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,120
A man must take responsibility

470
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,040
and have a sense of duty, right?

471
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:15,800
So you must protect

472
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,280
every woman in your family, okay?

473
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:17,840
Okay.

474
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,800
Not just your mom,

475
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,440
your sister too, right?

476
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,120
Right.

477
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,400
So sometimes, can you

478
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,640
let your sister choose what she wants?

479
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:25,800
Can you?

480
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,200
What should you do?

always something we can feel with certainty.]

from the same family?

495

Yes.

I'm good at cooking too!

Okay.

It's okay.

Let me help.

504
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,160
I can do it.

What are you recording?

The kids in the village

are so real.

514

Look at them.

515
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,360
They gradually forget about the camera.

In the future,

769
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,560
whenever you feel sad,

770
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,560
and you can't find someone to talk to,

771
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,480

As adults,

774
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,960
we often put filters

775
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,160
over our eyes.

776
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,600

778
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:07,640
Very good.

779
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,440
In fact, I think

Does your father love you?

784
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,000
Yes. Quite a lot.

785
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:35,560
Really?

What about your mom?

788

If she can't figure out what we want,

789
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,400
doesn't that mean she doesn't love us?

790
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,440
So you need to communicate.

791
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,600
I'm teaching you to communicate.

792
00:31:46,144 --> 00:31:46,840
[Love is communication, not guessing.]

793
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,120
For instance,

794
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,080
if you feel unhappy,

795
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,280
but don't say anything,

796
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,520
they will never know what you want.

797
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:56,320
The way they love you will always be wrong.

798
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,760
Like your mom,

00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,680

801
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,480
They don't know what you want.

802
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,680
Because whenever you're angry,

803
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,480
you don't speak.

804
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:08,320
If so, everyone feels

805
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,400
very uncomfortable.

806
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,640
Everyone feels upset.

807
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,720
Your older brother, younger brother,

808
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:17,520
all feel uncomfortable.

809
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,640
They will wonder what's wrong,

810
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,680
why you're unhappy.

811
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,720
That's why communication is so important.

812
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:26,840

813
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,080

I can tell that she loves you.

834
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,400

1328
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:25,920
Right now in Yajiang,

1329
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:29,000
forest fire prevention is strictly enforced.

1330
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,640
I believe so.

1331
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:32,600
The temperature is naturally high in this place.

1332
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:32,920
Yes.

1333
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:35,160
And it's very dry.

1334
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:37,080
These are dead wood and stuff.

1335
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:37,400
Right?

1336
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:39,240
They can easily catch fire.

1337
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:39,800
Yes.

1338
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:42,480
Are those horses?

1339
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:42,760
Yes.

1340
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:44,240
Those are the horses from our village.

1341
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:53,360
During summer,

1342
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:54,600
there is water here,

1343
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:56,160
and it turns into a lake.

1344
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:02,640
My dad and I

1345
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:04,600
patrol around here every day.

1346
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:05,720
You just walk around here?

1347
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:07,480
So you check for any mountain fires

1348
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:09,000
and other dangers?

1349
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:09,600
Yes.

1350
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:22,600
And if there were

1351
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:23,600
any small mountain fires,

1352
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:26,200
my dad would use the water in his bucket...

1353
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:26,800
To extinguish them.

1354
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:28,960
Yes, my dad is in charge of this area.

1355
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:31,200
So he is in charge of this area.

1356
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:38,880
This is one of our checkpoints.

1357
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:39,680
Those who want to enter the mountain

1358
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:42,440
must have all their lighters and such confiscated.

1359
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:44,240
And there's a monitoring station here.

1360
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:46,880
If by any chance there's a fire here someday,

1361
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:48,680
we can know it immediately.

1362
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:51,840
One person protects the entire mountain.

1363
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:52,720
And

1364
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:53,720
once the mountain is protected,

1365
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:54,760
the villagers at the foot of the mountain

1366
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:56,440
are also fully protected.

1367
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:57,000
Yes.

1368
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:13,560
Amazing, sir.

1369
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:23,120
Let's take photos here.

1370
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:24,800
You want to take photos here?

1371
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:25,400
Yes.

1372
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:27,440
There are trees and other things here.

1373
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:28,920
We can take photos of them too.

1374
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:29,720
Okay.

1375
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:30,720
Then we can just

1376
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,360
take the photos here.

1377
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:35,480
Let's do it here.

1378
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:37,000
Should we stand like this?

1379
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Yes, stand facing me.

1380
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,240
Just like this, stand over there a bit.

1381
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:40,400
Sir, let me carry this.

1382
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:41,400
Let me carry it.

1383
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:42,000
This?

1384
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:42,960
Can I carry it?

1385
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:45,320
A little bit...

1386
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:47,960
It's not bad.

1387
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:49,200
This is nice.

1388
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:51,400
Okay, I'll carry it for you.

1389
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:52,400
Let's take a couple of photos.

1390
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:53,800
First, walk inside.

1391
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:54,960
Then walk outside, okay?

1392
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:55,600
Okay.

1393
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:56,520
First, walk inside?

1394
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:57,000
Yes.

1395
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,560
Come on. Ready?

1396
00:51:58,920 --> 00:51:59,520
Go.

1397
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,240
Turn around.

1398
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:04,520
Does this feel uncomfortable?

1399
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:07,720
Turn to one side.

1400
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:09,720
From the middle.

1401
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:11,240
Turn around and look from the middle, okay?

1402
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:11,720
Okay.

1403
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:12,440
From the middle?

1404
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,800
Go.

1405
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:15,960
Turn around and smile.

1406
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:19,080
Good.

1407
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:19,920
Come back.

1408
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:21,160
Bao, let go of your dad's hand.

1409
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:22,160
Run. Start running.

1410
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:22,600
Okay.

1411
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:23,720
Run.

1412
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:24,240
Laugh.

1413
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:30,320
I really want to laugh.

1414
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:37,440
It's quite beautiful.

1415
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:40,680
It looks great.

1416
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:41,520
It's so funny.

1417
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,400
When you look back,

1418
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,920
it feels like you're protecting this forest.

1419
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:50,360
And your dad is holding your hand.

1420
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:52,240
It means he's also protecting you.

1421
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:53,600
I think so too.

1422
00:52:58,120 --> 00:53:00,080
My dad has worked here as a ranger

1423
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:01,200
for over 20 years.

1424
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:03,320
Over 20 years?

1425
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:05,640
So your dad started this job when you were born?

1426
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:06,760
About right.

1427
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:08,440
So what are you studying now?

1428
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:10,280
Modern agricultural equipment.

1429
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:13,600
You still want to work in agriculture.

1430
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:14,640
You'll come back someday?

1431
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:16,080
You want to come back?

1432
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:19,880
[For their family,]

1433
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:20,720
[at this moment,]

1434
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:22,440
[it seems like being a ranger]

1435
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:24,800
[is no longer just a job]

1436
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,400
[but an accomplishment.]

1437
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:32,640
[If someone guards something for 20 years,]

1438
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:36,160
[I think the emotions are different.]

1439
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
[His daughter is 20 years old.]

1440
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,800
[And he's been doing this job for 20 years.]

1441
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:46,120
[In front of this mountain he's been protecting,]

1442
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:48,680
[a glance back with his daughter]

1443
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:51,560
[is very moving.]

1444
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:01,160
It's snowing.

1445
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:04,040
It's snowing.

1446
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:13,520
I've never seen such heavy snow.

1447
00:55:36,416 --> 00:55:52,320
[The ad is aired at this period of time]

1448
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:08,720
Our themes are

1449
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:10,640
"Thirty thousand times of peace and joy"

1450
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:13,120
and "Thirty Thousand Glances Back."

1451
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:17,360
So you want to shoot

1452
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:19,840
which one?

1453
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:21,480
What's wrong?

1454
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:22,040
What's wrong?

1455
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:23,600
What's wrong?

1456
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:24,480
It's nothing.

1457
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:27,640
[One hour ago]

1458
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:28,840
Village hunk, take a shot.

1459
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:31,560
Nice.

1460
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:37,000
I've taken many photos. They all look great.

1461
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:38,800
Come on. Let's play soccer.

1462
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:39,240
Okay.

1463
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:39,760
Come on.

1464
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:43,880
Come on. Start!

1465
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:55,240
Nao.

1466
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:56,600
Nao.

1467
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:03,080
Nice shot.

1468
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:03,960
Nice shot.

1469
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:06,640
Nao, do you want to take a break?

1470
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,360
No need. It's okay.

1471
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:12,920
Are you alright?

1472
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:13,520
I'm fine.

1473
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:16,960
What's wrong?

1474
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:17,760
I'm fine.

1475
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:19,800
I'm too tired and feeling dizzy.

1476
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:22,200
Dizzy?

1477
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:23,600
I'm just too tired

1478
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:26,240
and can't stand up.

1479
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:27,120
Let me help you up.

1480
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:28,280
Get up.

1481
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:30,080
It's okay. He is just...

1482
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:32,080
It's okay. I'm just a little tired.

1483
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:33,120
I'm fine.

1484
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:38,920
Sit down.

1485
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:40,160
Sit on this stool.

1486
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:40,720
Thank you.

1487
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:41,360
Are you alright?

1488
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:41,920
I'm fine.

1489
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:43,360
You go ahead and talk first.

1490
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:44,400
Are you alright?

1491
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:45,040
I'm fine.

1492
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:45,720
Really, I'm fine.

1493
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:46,440
I'm just feeling dizzy.

1494
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:55,440
It's snowing.

1495
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:56,400
Look at the snow.

1496
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:57,520
It's so beautiful.

1497
00:57:58,120 --> 00:57:59,600
I will take some photos.

1498
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:00,640
Do you need my help?

1499
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:02,440
I'll take photos for them.

1500
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:06,320
Keep inhaling.

1501
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:09,040
Quick, the snow will be gone soon.

1502
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:10,304
Okay, thanks, Grandpa.

1503
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:11,520
It's so beautiful.

1504
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:15,440
Look at the snow.

1505
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:19,440
Pretty good. Looks nice.

1506
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:22,080
It looks very clear.

1507
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:23,000
Okay.

1508
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:30,000
Where are you, Nao?

1509
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:30,760
What's wrong?

1510
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:32,960
I'm fine.

1511
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:34,240
What did I tell you?

1512
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:35,240
How many times have I told you?

1513

Can you jump here?

1515

1527
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:53,680
You will feel uncomfortable

Of course.

Today I took a photo of someone looking back.

I took a photo of the mountain guardian.

1599
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:05,520
There's a man

1600
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:07,800
who has been a forest ranger for 20 years.

1601
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:13,320
He has to check the mountain every day.

1602

Right on the mountain.

1603
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:17,200
The forest on the mountain

1604
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:18,680
might start small fires.

1605
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:20,960
If they didn't keep watching,

1606
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:23,720
the small fires would turn into big fires.

1607
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:27,440

1665

Move a bit more inside.

1667
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:33,600

01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:01,760
So cool.

1700
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:02,400
Alright, come on.

1701
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:03,440
You can take a few steps forward.

1702
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:04,240
And then you can stop

1703
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:05,120
and not go any further.

1704
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:06,200
The pace is too fast.

1705
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:07,400
Don't rush.

1706
01:06:07,640 --> 01:06:08,800
Don't look at the camera.

1707
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:10,120
You made that expression too early.

1708
01:06:10,120 --> 01:06:11,240
Too fake.

1709
01:06:11,240 --> 01:06:12,000
Again.

1710
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:12,560
One more time.

1711
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:16,160
We're having iron pot stew tonight.

1712
01:06:16,680 --> 01:06:17,680
This is awesome.

1713
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:19,000
These rice noodles are really delicious.

1714
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:20,440
Rosy's food is so tasty.

1715
01:06:22,680 --> 01:06:24,680
Do we have to leave tomorrow?

1716
01:06:28,560 --> 01:06:29,400
This is a hat

1717
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:31,280
we kept for seven years.

1718
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:32,440
I want to give it to you.

1719
01:06:35,720 --> 01:06:37,120
Thank you.

1720
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:39,200
I don't want
to read the letter anymore. Is it okay?
