00:01:58,750 --> 00:01:59,590
I've prepared

00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:00,810
a week's worth of supplies.

7
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:02,270
I'll return the car first.

Who are you people?

00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:14,800
Don't be nervous, Mr. Ding.

10

We

11
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:18,270

Medicine.

16
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,150
Atropine and quinine?

17
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:32,829
Yes.

18
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:37,150
Those aren't easy to get.

19
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:40,210
The Japanese are strict now.

20
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,820
You'll be beheaded if you get caught.

21
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:45,310
We have money.

22
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:49,110
It's not doable even with money.

23
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:51,430
You don't know.

24
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:54,829
The Japanese regulate medicine

25
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:56,810
more strictly than guns.

30
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:06,950
How do I know

If you can't get the medicine today,

00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:11,140
I'll shoot you.

35
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:14,390
I'm asking you if you have the medicine or not!

Don't scare him.

He got shot in the head before.

39
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:26,930
He has a bad temper.

40
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,850
He's not as easy-going as me.

41
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:32,390
To be honest,

42
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,810
if you don't help us get the medicine,

43
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:37,730
you won't be able to leave this house.

44
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:40,550

46
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:43,540
Those people will kill you.

47
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:46,350
Get us the medicine

48
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:48,910
and you can go wherever you like.

49
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,430
We won't care.

50
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:52,590
And if you need anything,

51
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,190
we can safely escort you

56
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:07,300
I have 3,000 pieces of atropine and quinine.

57
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:09,030
If you want them,

58
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:10,510
you have to take them all.

59
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:15,030
I only want legal tender, US dollars and gold bars.

60
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:19,240
I don't want reserve bonds

61
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,959

62
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:24,670

We'll do as you say.

64
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:33,350
Director, we found Ding Jiansheng.

65
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:34,659
Where is he?

66
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:36,930
He was at Shanghai Rong Society Club,

67
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:39,820
but he was taken away.

68
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:41,080
Did Gu Yizhong do it?

69
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:41,920
No.

70
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,830
He was in Suzhou.

71
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:47,490
I also checked the other guys in the station.

72
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:50,030
Other than us,

73
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:52,710
no one was working in Shanghai today.

74
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:54,350
I suspect

75
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:56,770
it was people from Taihu Lake.

76

00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:32,470
There's no water.

84
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,800
Can I have a piece of pancake too?

85
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:44,760
Is there a problem?

86
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:54,300
Ding Jiansheng might be in Gu Yizhong's hands.

00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,230
Who is Ding Jiansheng?

88
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:04,470
Lian Jinhai was killed because of this man.

89
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:05,680
He's traded

90
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:07,770

91

In 1937,

119
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:43,250
you asked me to go to Wuhan

120
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:45,880
and stayed in Nanjing alone.

121
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:47,909

But as the Director of No. 90,

161

00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:15,380

00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:44,480
including people related to No. 90,

192
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:45,830
it's easy to come in,

193
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:48,500
but it's hard to get out.

194
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:50,450
Right, Gao Hu?

195
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:54,870
Director,

196
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,990
what's the use of the communists taking Ding Jiansheng?

197
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:59,740
They can't be helping the Japanese

198
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:01,230
solve the military rice case, right?

199
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:01,880
Yes.

200
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:04,100
I don't understand either.

201
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:04,960
It's okay.

202
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:07,290
I'll write a report to Mr. Kondo

203
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:09,630
and tell him that Ding Jiansheng

204
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:11,350
is in the hands of the communists.

205
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:12,270
Is that okay?

206
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:13,340
Director Zhou,

207
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,590
you're taking a drastic measure.

208
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:17,800
You know I'm investigating this case.

209
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:20,110
If I catch Ding Jiansheng in the future,

210
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:20,910
it'll be obvious

211
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:22,470
that Mr. Si gave Ding Jiansheng to me.

212
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:24,030
Are you trying to frame me?

213
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:26,940
You're right.

214
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:30,240
In that case,

215
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:31,930
there is indeed a problem.

216
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:34,320
Then I won't write this report.

217
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,100
Give me Ding Jiansheng.

218
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:40,610
His corpse is fine too.

219
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:47,550
Yizhong,

220
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,160
how about this?

221
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,750
Let's

222
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:52,570
make a deal.

223
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,640
I won't write the report.

224
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:57,600
I don't care why you came

225
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:58,430
to No. 90

226
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:01,700
and I won't investigate how your father died either.

227
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:04,510
Just give Ding Jiansheng to me.

228
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:06,470
Okay?

229
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:11,320
Director Zhou,

230
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:14,290
I appreciate your kindness,

231
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,510
but I really don't know

232
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:18,230
where Ding Jiansheng is.

233
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:21,690
Sorry, I have another question.

234
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:23,670
Should I report to you directly

235
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:25,830
or to Mr. Kondo about the military rice case

236
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:27,710
in the future?

237
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,120
Report to Kondo.

238
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,070

239
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,400
What did you call Kondo?

240
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:39,870
Mr. Kondo.

244
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:51,100
You say that so naturally

245
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:51,640

248
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:03,450
You should stop interacting with Huang Xinzhai.

to serve Division Commander for 49 days.

00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,840
and I'm a woman.

378
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:22,790
Will this cause trouble for you?

379
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:24,640
Ignore them.

380
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:26,840
You sing well.

381
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:28,250
Your time slot

382
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:30,030
used to only get dozens of customers.

383
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:31,750
After singing for a few days,

384
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:33,790
you've gotten around 100 customers.

385
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:35,320
You've become popular too.

386
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,590
The Guangyu Performers' Guild

387
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:40,160
just wants a few coins.

388
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:41,240
How about this?

389
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:44,230
I'll apply for it tomorrow.

390
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:06,150
What's wrong?

391
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,400
You don't have enough funds?

392
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:11,990
This time,

393
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,600
we prepared 60,000 legal tender.

394
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,850
After giving my team the oeprational fee

395
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:19,610
and renting a car in Shanghai,

396
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:20,730
we only have

397
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:24,220
59,200 left in total.

398
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:29,630
This batch of medicine costs 100,000.

399
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:31,360
They don't sell retail either.

400
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,440
Where can we get so much money?

401
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,830
This is

402
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,590
my father's gift for Junsheng.

403
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,770
I want to save some money for Junsheng.

404
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,080
Take it all.

405
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:28,340
Save some money to feed Junsheng with.

406
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:31,710
If you have money leftover after buying the medicine,

407
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:32,920
give it back to me.

408
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:44,710
For some reason,

409
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:47,260
my eye has been twitching

410
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:48,960
since yesterday.

411
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:52,000
My heartbeat is erratic too.

412
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:55,660
Where did you go

413
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:56,650
this morning?

414
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:08,940
Zhiping, I have something to tell you.

415
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:11,280
It's about time for me

416
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:12,390
to meet with Zhou.

417
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,740
You go first.

418
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:17,710
We'll talk when you're back.

419
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:21,230
Is it something important?

420
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:23,230
It concerns my loyalty to the Party.

421
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:31,790
Do you think I'm a good party member

422
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:33,540
and a firm believer?

423
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,370
Why are you talking about this?

424
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:39,920
What happened?

425
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:43,020
Nothing.

426
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:44,800
You go first.

427
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:46,130
I'll tell you when you're back.

428
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:46,640
Okay?

429
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:17,990
Where is Ding Jiansheng?

430
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,860
Ruotong and He are watching him.

431
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:23,800
After we make the deal safely,

432
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,000
they'll release him.

433
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:29,640
The money is in the case.

434
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:31,570
There are 59,200 in legal tender

435
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,240
and ten gold bars.

436
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:34,590
Each bar is worth 4,000.

437
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:36,110
It's just about 100,000.

Alright.

Zhiping.

445
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:06,470
This is a small gesture of goodwill. It's not much.

446
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:13,280
Be careful.

You want to buy medicine?

454
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,540
Ding Jiansheng must have told you

455

on the phone.

456
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:20,610
Where will the medicine be used?

457
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,200
It won't be in Suzhou.

Why are there gold bars?

476
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,970

It was quite dangerous.

Why didn't you tell us earlier

527
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:18,110
that the medicine was sold by Japs?

528
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:19,570
We almost got into a fight.

529

If it weren't for your son,

538
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,560
we would have had a fight.

539
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:40,100
Drink some water.

540
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,570
Send the medicine to the liaison.

541
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:42,990

This is what I promised the middleman.

546

547
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:01,930
What middleman?

548
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:05,080
Ruotong, you need to follow the Party's principles.

shouldn't you let me go?

552

Otherwise, my son won't forgive you.

553
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:13,390
Once it's done,

554
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:14,520

555
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:23,660

Okay, don't worry.

557
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:28,270

558
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:30,710
with Ding?

559
00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:32,440
Send him back to Shanghai

560

as promised.

561
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,450
Ding is quite knowledgeable.

562
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:40,440
He can even build connections with the Japanese.

563
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:41,580
How about this?

564
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:43,340
Detain him for two more days.

565
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:45,510
I'll ask the superiors

566
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:46,590
before making a decision.

567
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:48,120
We can't break our promise.

568
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:51,630
I promised his son

569
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:52,960
to release him when we get the medicine.

570
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:53,590
No hurry.

571
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,270
I'll ask the superiors.

572
00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:57,950
Wait for my news.

573
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:03,270
Did you change your mind?

574
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:04,890
I've done everything for you

575
00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:06,400
and you still want to detain me?

576
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,460
Mr. Si doesn't do business like this.

577
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:09,810
If you keep doing this,

578
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:10,989
no one will dare to do business with you anymore.

579
00:34:10,989 --> 00:34:12,080
Mr. Ding, please...

580
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,030
Keep it down.

581
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:14,429
Alright.

582
00:34:18,449 --> 00:34:19,969
Eat something first.

583
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:21,560
Don't worry.

584
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:23,030
We'll do

585
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:24,699
what we promised you.

586
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:30,270
Mr. Ding, calm down.

587
00:34:32,090 --> 00:34:33,409
Pour me some water.

588
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:36,280
Ding Jiansheng is with the communists right now.

589
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:38,510
Major.

590
00:34:46,139 --> 00:34:49,670
Zhou, I heard you have a wanted criminal of the Changzhou military rice case.

591
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:52,080
Is this the news about Ding Jiansheng?

592
00:34:52,219 --> 00:34:52,739
Yes.

593
00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:55,659
I was preparing to write a report for you.

594
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:57,110
It is said that

595
00:34:57,110 --> 00:34:59,590
Ding Jiansheng is with the communists now.

596
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:01,510
It's the Suzhou Communists.

597
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:04,870
Is Mr. Gu's intelligence accurate?

598
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:05,700
Yes.

599
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:08,090
We must catch Ding Jiansheng

600
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:09,630
and punish the smugglers

601
00:35:09,730 --> 00:35:13,260
to uphold the order of food in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai.

602
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:14,960
It's time to use

603
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:16,470
your Cell 8.

604
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,780
I heard you've lost control

605
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:23,640
of Cell 8.

606
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:25,570
It's absolutely a rumor.

607
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:27,340
I still have Cell 8's kompromat

608
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:28,630
in my hands.

609
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:30,380
He won't dare to leave.

610
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:32,190
Good.

611
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:34,840
Have him give Ding Jiansheng to us.

612
00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:36,150
If Cell 8

613
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:38,280
can't complete the mission this time,

614
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:40,310
you won't be the director of No. 90 Agent Station

615
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:41,490
anymore.

616
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:47,020
Mr. Kondo,

617
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:48,810
I hope you won't forget

618
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,960
that we had an agreement

619
00:35:50,990 --> 00:35:52,590
when No. 90 was established.

620
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:54,750
For the personnel appointment,

621
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:55,670
the affairs of Chinese people

622
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:57,080
should be handled by the Chinese.

623
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:57,810
So,

624
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,670
it's not up to you

625
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:02,560
if I'm the director or not.

626
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,680
It's up to Mr. Li.

627
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:15,850
To put it nicely, he's an agent.

628
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:16,910
In reality,

629
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:18,410
he's sinister,

630
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:22,270
cunning, selfish, and doubts everything.

631
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,670
But I always feel

632
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:27,050
the way Director Zhou acts at work

633
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:28,430
is very tough.

634
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:34,510
That's because

635
00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:38,330
he has Mr. Li from the agents' headquarters behind him.

636
00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:40,070
The other thing

637
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:42,550
is all because of you.

638
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:44,590
Me?

639
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:45,700
Cell 8.

640
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:51,860
Director Huang, you must be joking.

641
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:54,210
You know I'm not Cell 8.

642
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:57,350
But what does this have to do with

643
00:36:57,350 --> 00:36:58,750
Zhou Zhifei being tough?

644
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:05,830
Yizhong, let me ask you.

645
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:08,640
What's the policy of Chairman Wang of Nanjing?

646
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:12,700
Peace, build the country, and fight the communists.

647
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:16,570
Who is the one damaging the peace?

648
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,140
The Communist Party.

649
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:24,190
Peace, build the country, and fight the communists.

650
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:26,050
The first two parts are nonsense.

651
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:30,020
The last part is the main point.

652
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:31,450
Fight the communists.

653
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:33,670
What does this have to do with Cell 8?

654
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:35,380
Using the internal cells

655
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:39,060
to destroy the CPC force

656
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,490
in Suzhou.

657
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:43,260
This is why Mr. Kondo

658
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:45,050
gives him some respect.

659
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:47,480
Otherwise, he would've been gone already.

660
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:53,990
The operation in Garden of Pleasance

661
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:56,270
was leaked by Cell 8.

662
00:37:56,370 --> 00:37:57,490
That's right.

663
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:03,810
Yizhong,

664
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:07,080
are you trying to trick me

665
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:09,010
into saying who Cell 8 is?

666
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:19,030
Vice Director Huang,

667
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:21,730
you won't know

668
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,270
even if I am.

669
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:28,100
Yes.

670
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:32,450
Zhou Zhifei

671
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:34,780
uses Cell 8 to make a living

672
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:36,700
in No. 90.

673
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:38,310
He plays

674
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:40,790
this card well.

675
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:43,380
But in my opinion,

676
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,880
Mr. Kondo overestimates

677
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:47,790
Cell 8.

678
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:49,030
Without him,

679
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:51,240
I can still accomplish things.

680
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:53,430
You mean

681
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:56,640
you also have internal cells?

682
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:57,630
No, I don't.

683
00:38:57,630 --> 00:38:58,750

684
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:07,970
Miss, this way.

685
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:20,790
You're here?

686
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:22,250

are all here.

688
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:27,070
Thank you.

689
00:39:27,090 --> 00:39:27,890
No problems?

690
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:28,440
No problem.

691
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:28,870
I'm leaving.

692
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:29,500
Wait.

693
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:34,730
Someone asked me to give you this letter.

694
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:40,520
Sit here and read it.

695
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:42,490
You pay for the coffee.

696
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:44,270
Thank you.

A friend.

702
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:20,030
Did you give her the note?

703
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:21,550
Yes.

704
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:22,770
I'm curious

705
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:24,910
what's written on this note.

706
00:40:28,290 --> 00:40:30,350
It's better for you if you don't know.

707
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,430
Do you think I want to know

708
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:32,890
about your stupid things?

709
00:40:32,990 --> 00:40:34,130
This is the last time.

710
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:36,060
Don't make me send messages again.

711
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:37,390
Alright, get off.

712
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:43,390
I have to give you some advice.

713
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,850
If you fail

714
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:46,950
at what you're doing,

715
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:48,510
you'll go down in history as a villain.

716
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:51,110
No one will praise you even if you win.

717
00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:52,980
Look at how you're risking your life.

718
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:55,490
Are you trying to find the person who hurt you

719
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,480

00:40:58,830 --> 00:41:00,640

722
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,930
