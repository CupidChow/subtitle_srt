[Episode 9]

4
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:42,950
The lead on Cell 8 might be cut off.

5
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:46,009
Could it be that he hasn't returned to Suzhou?

6
00:01:46,009 --> 00:01:46,479
No.

7
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:48,229
He is in Suzhou.

8
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,430
I marked the note I left him.

9
00:01:52,539 --> 00:01:53,440
He saw the note.

10
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:55,430
But he didn't respond.

11
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:59,910
It seems like he wants to burn bridges.

12
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:01,070
It's not that easy.

13
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:03,500
for him to kick down the ladder.

14
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,270
I see.

15
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,520
The one who wants Gu Yizhong dead

16
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:09,080
the most right now is Cell 8.

17
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,009
Once Gu Yizhong is dead,

18
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,030
everyone will think

19
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:14,070
Gu Yizhong is Cell 8.

20
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:15,950
Then the real Cell 8

21
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:18,310
will remain unidentified

22
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:19,220
and safe.

23
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,180
In this way,

24
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:22,470
he won't need to

25
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,300
provide me with any more intel.

26
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:27,420
Now I understand.

27
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,310
I understand why you allowed Gu Yizhong

28
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:30,710
to operate within No. 90.

29
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:33,260
As long as Gu Yizhong is around,

30
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:34,750
for Cell 8,

31
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:36,320
he's a counterbalance.

32
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:37,980
But Zhifei,

33
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:39,190
do you think

34
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:41,520
Kondo will truly trust Gu Yizhong?

35
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,220
Hard to say.

36
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:45,480
The Japanese are rigid.

37
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:47,110
They don't know how to adapt.

38
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:48,510
They invested too much effort

39
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:49,900
in Gu Xixing before.

40
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:51,190
Now, they've finally

41
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:52,570
found a breach

42
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,820
with Gu Yizhong.

43
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,870
They won't let go so easily.

44
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:57,000
Understood.

45
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:58,950
But Gu Yizhong is no fool.

46
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:01,960
Keeping him around will be trouble sooner or later.

47
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:05,350
He's more useful alive than dead.

48
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:07,440
But he doesn't listen to us.

49
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:09,470
I'm afraid he'll ruin things.

50
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:10,930
Then make him kill someone

51
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,290
as a pledge of loyalty.

52
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:13,110
This way,

53
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:14,590
no matter if he participates

54
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:15,870
in the peace movement or nor,

55
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:18,390
he'll have no chance to turn back.

56
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:19,790
Got it.

57
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:21,320
I'll make the arrangements.

58
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,650
Once he's in No. 90, he won't have a choice.

59
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,070
He will eventually

60
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:26,990
sink with us as a traitor.

61
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:30,150
Jinhai,

62
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,100
let me correct you.

63
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:34,910
You, me, both of us,

64
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:37,150
are participating in the peace movement.

65
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,030
Don't call it treason, it sounds awful.

66
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:39,829
Right. Right.

67
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,430
Peace movement.

68
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:43,590
I got confused

69
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:45,010
by those people outside.

70
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:48,350
By the way,

71
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:49,870
there's news about her.

72
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:50,510
She...

73
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,680
Well,

74
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:03,750
Jiuzhao is not good at killing.

75
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,660
But he's good at finding people.

76
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:08,190
Guess where Ms. Ou, Ou Xinping,

77
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:09,520
is hiding?

78
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,430
I've guessed countless places.

79
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,910
I couldn't figure it out.

80
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:14,640
Gu's Garden.

81
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:21,120
I never thought of Gu's Garden.

82
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:21,630
Yes.

83
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:23,310
This old agent

84
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,270
is crafty.

85
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:28,090
I never expected that place.

86
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:30,420
The intel from No. 76 in Shanghai says

87
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:32,080
that Ms. Ou's current position is

88
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,110
Head of the Jiangsu Operations for CBIS.

89
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:35,310
She's been promoted.

90
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:38,360
Zhifei.

91
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:40,510
I know I shouldn't ask,

92
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:41,960
but I still want to know,

93
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:43,430
what did Xu Enzeng write

94
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:44,560
in his letter to you?

95
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:45,890
Take a guess.

96
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,110
What would that old fox write to me?

97
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:52,870
Could it be that Xu wants to recruit you

98
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:54,430
and the people of No. 90

99
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:56,460
back to CBIS?

100
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:00,850
You're improving.

101
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:05,500
If I go back to CBIS,

102
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:07,270
what do you think?

103
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,160
No matter where you go,

104
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:10,600
I'll follow.

105
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,250
Yesterday, I told Yuqing

106
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:21,510
that we, as spies,

107
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,390
live in constant fear.

108
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:26,140
If we retire someday,

109
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:29,110
I'll go abroad and buy an island.

110
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:31,470
Then we can live there.

111
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:34,190
I'll bring you and Xiaolan along.

112
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:35,830
Are you going?

113
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:36,990
Yes.

114
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:44,500
Jinhai.

115
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:49,470
Jinhai.

116
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:53,680
Here's some money. Take it.

117
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:54,620
No.

118
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:55,390
Take it.

119
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:56,060
I have money.

120
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,950
You and Yuqing have helped us a lot.

121
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:58,790
I won't take it.

122
00:05:58,790 --> 00:05:59,320
Take it.

123
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:00,840
Go.

124
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:03,250
Thank you, Zhifei.

125
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:12,880
Jinhai.

126
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:15,490
Be careful.

127
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:18,460
Bye.

128
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:34,340
I've been waiting for you.

129
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:35,630
What's the matter?

130
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:39,510
I want to see Gu Yizhong.

131
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:42,990
Uncle Gu has severed ties

132
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:44,610
with him.

133
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:47,110
He's also not allowed to return to Gu's Garden

134
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:48,460
If he doesn't come back,

135
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:50,630
can you find him?

136
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:52,850
I promised Uncle Gu

137
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:54,400
I wouldn't associate with him anymore.

138
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,080
Haimo,

139
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:00,860
do you want him to become a traitor?

140
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:03,970
That's his problem.

141
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,360
Haimo,

142
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:06,900
we both know

143
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,980
he must have a reason for going to No. 90.

144
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:13,010
The Party just wants to have a serious talk with him.

145
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:18,690
Last time at the noodle shop, he almost died.

146
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:20,550
I can't be foolish again.

147
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:21,460
Haimo.

148
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,080
I won't tell anyone.

149
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:25,620
You, he, and I.

150
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,060
Only the three of us know.

151
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:38,310
Today

152
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:40,590
is our new recruits' final assessment.

153
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,310
It's also a technique commonly

154
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:44,830
used by professional spies,

155
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:45,950
which is murder.

156
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,590
You heard correctly.

157
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:48,390
It's murder.

158
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:54,730
[Li's Bun Shop]

159
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:52,040
There isn't much work these days.

160
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:54,590
Isn't it? Times are tough.

161
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:06,720
What do you need?

162
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:09,220
I'm looking for Young Master Gu Yizhong.

163
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,790
Today, in this place

164
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,380
borrowed from the Japanese,

165
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:16,130
I'll teach you how to kill.

166
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,600
When executing a gunshot,

167
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:29,100
aim at the forehead.

168
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:30,150
Like this.

169
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:32,299
This has two benefits:

170
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:33,990
First, it ensures a one-shot kill.

171
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:36,429
Second, it prevents splattering brain matter everywhere.

172
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:37,110
Got it?

173
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,780
Cui Yaomin collaborated with the enemy.

174
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:42,690
After a special court review,

175
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:44,390
approved by the Pacification Operation Committee,

176
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:45,480
Suzhou office

177
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:46,880
has sentenced him to death,

178
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,400
depriving him of public rights for life.

179
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,660
Execute immediately.

180
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,240
Who will do it?

181
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:54,490
Gu Yizhong.

182
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:56,120
You do it.

183
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:02,100
Section Chief Lian,

184
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:03,590
I can't kill.

185
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,360
I asked you to come up.

186
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:10,360
You'll do it.

187
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:21,990
Take it.

188
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:35,610
If you want to join No. 90,

189
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:39,000
you must pass this test.

190
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:40,380
Here.

191
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:43,630
Look here.

192

Where did you hear that name?

378
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:21,760
Cui Yaomin mentioned it before he died.

379
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,590
That's why he was killed.

If you want to stay alive in No. 90,

382
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,240
never mention

383
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,270
this name again.

384
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:31,190
Never.

385
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:32,550
I'm leaving.

386
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,300
I want to see Kondo.

387
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,930
Even Mr. Kondo can't save you now.

388
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:39,400
In No. 90,

389
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:41,670
as long as it doesn't involve the Japanese,

390
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:43,670
Zhou Zhifei does whatever he wants.

391
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:46,690
Lian Jinhai and him were like brothers.

392
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,470
None of the shady things of Zhou were done

393
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:50,190
without Lian Jinhai's help.

394
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:51,920
With Lian dead,

395
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:55,020
do you think Zhou Zhifei will spare you?

396
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:57,080
Pray for yourself.

397
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:58,350
Open the door!

398
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,080
Vice Director Huang is here too?

399
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:07,610
Gu, you're not telling the truth.

400
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,230
If you're not going to confess,

401
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:11,060
why waste my time?

402
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:12,710
Captain Zhang, go ahead.

403
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:20,220
Gu, Director Zhou wants to see you.

404
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:22,910
Bad news, Sir.

405
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,440
Director Zhou has taken Gu Yizhong away.

406
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:27,460
Zhou just left my office.

407
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:29,220
He said he would treat Gu Yizhong well.

408
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,940
Director Zhou wants to kill Gu Yizhong!

409
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:31,810
Sir,

410
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:35,810
Director Zhou will definitely kill Gu Yizhong.

411
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:36,750
Wu Youmin.

412
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:37,350
Here.

413
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:38,450
Lu Feishan.

414
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:39,030
Here.

415
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:40,200
Jiang Xiaoyun.

416
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:40,830
Here.

417
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,020
Gu Yizhong.

418
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:45,000
Here.

419
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:47,880
Gu Yizhong deserves to die.

420
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:49,670
But if Gu Yizhong dies,

421
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:50,430
Gu Xixing

422
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:52,530
will never accept to be the magistrate.

423
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:53,790
And Sir, your plan

424
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:55,110
will be greatly affected.

425
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:56,150
Dear trainees,

426
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:57,930
I announce

427
00:21:58,270 --> 00:21:58,750
Sir.

428
00:21:58,770 --> 00:21:59,970
that from now on,

00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:01,850

of the Suzhou Agent Station.

433
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:10,350
Some of you may work

434
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:12,150
in the Suzhou headquarters in the future.

435
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:12,950
Some of you...

436
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:13,750
Huang.

437
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,180
Do you like opera?

438
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:16,900
Yes.

439
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,810
Sir, if you also like Peking opera,

440
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:20,110
I can bring you the best performer

441
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:20,950
in Suzhou.

442
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,310
Let's watch this show.

ranking first in all assessments.

448
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:35,140
He is awarded the title of Outstanding Trainee of this class.

449
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:36,930
What is Zhou Zhifei planning?

[Outstanding Strategy and Unique Brilliance]

451
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,170
He's definitely going to kill Gu, Sir.

452
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:42,890
Zhou is cleverer than you.

453
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:45,860
He's great.

456

The appointment for the magistrate of Wu County is here.

457
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:01,950
Wang Zemin is out.

458
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:04,750
It's Gu Xixing, right?

459
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,210
This is troublesome.

460
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:09,420
Wang Zemin

461
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:11,660
is sure to come here and complain.

462
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:13,830
Let him wait a bit longer.

463
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:17,390
Gu Xixing won't accept it.

464
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:20,560
I think so too.

465
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:22,420
This old man is so stubborn.

466
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:27,030
His son is with you, right?

467
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:30,460
The kid studied abroad

468
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,890
and is a schoolmate of Liang Qichao's son,

469
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:35,990
Liang Sicheng.

470
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:37,980
How is he?

471
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:43,320
He's quite talented.

472
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:45,120
He ranked first

473
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:47,830
in everything during the training.

474
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:51,910
Is he your man?

475
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:53,030
Not really.

476
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:55,310
I don't even know

477
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:56,370
whose man he is now.

478
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:58,510
No matter who he was before,

479
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,850
make him yours.

480
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:06,630
I'll try.

must be taken,

00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:15,430
but we can't rush it.

484
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:18,670
We need to keep Gu steady

485
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,800
and handle things beautifully.

489
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,460
Have you been waiting for a long time?

490
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:56,550

00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:04,900

493
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,270
or work-related issues,

494
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:07,670

00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:11,310
I actually envy

Outstanding Trainees like you.

498
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:15,950
Let me tell you a secret.

499
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:19,810
In 1927,

500
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:21,950
I accompanied an officer

501
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:25,100
to the Soviet Union for agent training.

502
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,370
He was that year's

503
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:29,090
Outstanding Trainee.

504
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:31,150
I'm not qualified to be trained

505
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:34,230
because I was just accompanying him there.

506
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:41,140
Just now,

507
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:42,990
I went to Kondo's office.

508
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:45,670
He gave me something

509
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,850
and asked me to pass it along to you.

510
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:51,070
You know, Mr. Kondo

511
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,840
has always admired your father.

512
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:57,500
Plus, there's a unanimous decision

513
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:00,510
to appoint your father

00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:04,290

00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:04,090
This is the appointment letter.

518
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:07,200
Could you deliver it?

519
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:10,070
My father is stubborn

520
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:12,440
and almost impossible to persuade.

521
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,590
Mr. Kondo knows that.

522
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:16,150
If others can't do it, you can.

523
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:17,440
You are his son.

524
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:20,270
Sir.

525
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,770
I was disowned by my father,

526
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,600
and everyone in Suzhou knows it.

527
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,890
No matter what, blood is thicker than water.

528
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:28,140
Kondo said this appointment letter

529
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:30,670
must be delivered by you personally.

530
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:31,950

Chairman Gao of Jiangsu Province

532
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:35,310
will also announce the news.

533
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:37,020
Sir,

534
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:38,930
I can't do it.

535
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:42,910
You were just titled Outstanding Trainee.

536
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:45,570
And you already forgot

537
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:47,970
the primary duty of an agent

538
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:52,920
according to the agent's code?

539
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:56,110
Obey orders.

540
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:56,870
Exactly.

541
00:26:57,650 --> 00:26:59,070
I want to see Mr. Kondo.

542
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:00,590
You can see him,

543
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:03,430
but I bet

544
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:05,680
he'll say the same thing.

545
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:08,890
Three days later,

546
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:11,270
it will be your father's 60th birthday.

547
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:13,220
With the appointment letter

548
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,640
and the birthday celebration,

549
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:16,610
just imagine,

550
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:19,350
Gu's Garden will be filled with double joy.

551
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:20,910
What do you think?

552
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:41,430
Yizhong.

553
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:45,980
You should know

554
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,710
the relationship between Lian Jinhai and me, right?

555
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:50,770
He's been with me for almost 20 years.

556
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:52,730
Now he's gone.

557
00:27:54,670 --> 00:27:58,110
His wife often comes to No. 90

558
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:00,930
and asked us to hand over the culprit.

559
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,910
I've been covering for you.

560
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:08,560
Here's the deal.

561
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:10,350
Do me this favor

562
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:13,150
and give this to your father.

563
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:15,990
I'll consider the matter

564
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:17,860
with Jinhai settled.

565
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:19,700
What do you say?

566
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:30,520
You have a cousin

567
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:32,000
locked up at No. 90, right?

568
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,680
Help me with this,

569
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,150
and I'll let him go too.

570
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:38,030
My cousin is innocent.

571
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:40,140
Who at No. 90

572
00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:41,740
is innocent?

573
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,070
You're still young.

574
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,800
Of course, I can't release him for nothing.

575
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:51,110
You need to understand

576
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:52,230
the rules of No. 90.

577
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,570
Have their family

578
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,320
bring twenty gold bars:

579
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:57,600
ten for the brothers' expenses

580
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:58,620
and ten

581
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,100
I'll deliver

582
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,400
to Lian Jinhai's family for you.

583

[Xie Wenchao, Director of the Kunshan Agent Substation of the Wang Regime]

584
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:32,290
The Director is in the first room on the second floor.

585

[Parents Deceased. No Siblings]

586
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:42,350
You've served in the military before, right?

587
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:43,070
Yes, sir.

Military Police Third Regiment.

589
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:47,430
That's Chiang's "Imperial Guard".

590
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:52,050
When I transferred Jinhai

591
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,350
back to Suzhou from Kunshan

592
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:55,890
to be the Chief of the Investigation Department,

593
00:29:55,890 --> 00:29:58,090
I recommended you to the headquarters

594
00:29:58,310 --> 00:30:00,190
to act as the interim chief of the Kunshan Substation.

595
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:00,950
Thank you.

596
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:04,150
I haven't had the chance to thank you in person.

597
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:08,000
Jinhai always praised you

598
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:09,630
for being capable and loyal.

599
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:11,660
Now that Jinhai is gone,

600
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:13,430
I need a reliable person

601
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:15,270
in Investigation.

602
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:17,510
I want you

603
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:19,830
to act as the interim Station Chief.

604
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:22,110
If there are no problems in three months,

605
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:24,070
I'll make it permanent.

606
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:26,920
Your salary will be at the Chief's rate

607
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,870
starting this month.

608
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:30,850
I will serve you

609
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:32,330
with utmost loyalty, Sir.

610
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:36,060
Can I trust you

611
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,590
like I trusted Lian Jinhai?

612
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:39,070
No problem, Sir.

613
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:39,990
Good.

614
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:44,030
Your first task is to dig up information

615
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:48,180
on Gu Yizhong for me.

616
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:49,670
Yes.

617
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:53,410
Thank you, sir.

618
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,090
Thank you, sir.

619
00:30:58,090 --> 00:30:58,580
Zheng.

620
00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:00,580
Yizhong, you're finally here.

621
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:02,390
Gu.

622
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:05,070
Hello, Zheng.

623
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:05,890
Hello.

624
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:08,820
Did the Director send you again?

625
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:09,710
What?

626
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:11,640
No. I came to take Cousin Lu Zheng home.

627
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,200
Zheng.

628
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,070
Let's go

629
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:15,070
Let's go.

630
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:16,510
Let me take the coat.

631
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:18,990
It's cold. Put it on for Zheng.

632
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:20,500
Here, Zheng.

633
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,390
Let me tell you.

634
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:23,720
This place is hellish.

635
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:24,780
Zheng.

636
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,990
I'm sorry you've suffered in there.

637
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:30,180
Did they beat you?

638
00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:33,730
The prison guards are ruthless.

639
00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:36,240
I took a hard beating

640
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:37,950
when I first got here,

641
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:40,710
but it's been better lately.

642
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:42,440
Still,

643
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:45,350
the toilet stinks terribly.

644
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:46,750
Don't blame Gu.

645
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:47,670
He's been trying to figure out

646
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:48,870
how to get you out.

647
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:51,720
If he hadn't become the Outstanding Trainee,

648
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,420
they might not have let you go.

649
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:54,730
Outstanding Trainee?

650
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:56,580
You don't know?

651
00:31:56,930 --> 00:31:58,140
It's great news.

652
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:01,730
Turn left up ahead, please.

653
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:20,940
Coming.

656

Zheng.

657
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:26,590
Wait.

658
00:32:28,810 --> 00:32:30,330
Why are you with him?

659
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:32,880
Have you fallen in with him too?

660
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:33,750
Uncle.

661
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,130
Zheng is quite weak now.

662
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:37,900
Let him go inside first.

663
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:39,310
Yes, yes, let's go in first.

664
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:39,830
Sorry.

665
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:42,430
But you two can't come in.

666
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:45,320
We don't want to cause misunderstandings

667
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,450
with the neighbors.

668
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,780
Dad, what happened?

669
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:49,090
No time to explain. Let's go.

670
00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:49,690
Uncle.

671
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:50,750
Don't.

672
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:51,950
Don't call me that.

673
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:54,470
I can't bear it, Mr. Gu.

674
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:55,950
Let's go.

675

To get Zheng out,

676
00:32:57,150 --> 00:32:58,920
they wanted twenty gold bars.

677
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:00,300
I vouched for it,

678
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:02,460
so you need to pay up.

679
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:05,070
Wait.

680
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:06,270
Let's go.

681
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,770

00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:08,580

684
00:33:10,770 --> 00:33:11,390
Let's go.

685
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:17,970
Gu, how could he say that?

686
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:19,320
Is he really your uncle?

687
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:25,030
Here.

Everyone in Suzhou knows

689
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:36,490
the Gu family now has an agent.

Gu Yizhong

691
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:39,190
has joined No. 90

692
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:40,980
and became a Japanese agent.

693
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:43,480
Impossible.

694
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:45,070
I'll run a bath for you

695
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:46,910

Please leave Suzhou before your birthday.

702

Uncle,

703
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,280
Yizhong is saying

704
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:28,280
you need to leave Suzhou quickly.

705
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:31,030
The Japanese can't get what they want through persuasion,
so they'll use force.

706
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:32,370
Persuasion or force,

707
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,860
it's clear what they want.

708
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,909
They're trying to kill two birds with one stone,

709
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:36,960
forcing Yizhong

710
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:38,290
to drag you into this.

00:34:38,739 --> 00:34:39,389
Uncle,

712
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:42,040
the safest place now is the French Concession in Shanghai.

713
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,239
Let's go to Shanghai.

714
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,570
I've already decided

719
00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:56,590
Since when are you afraid of the Japanese?

720
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:57,150
I...

721
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:00,810
Mr. Li,

722
00:35:01,290 --> 00:35:03,190
Mr. Li, if you like Suzhou-style mutton slices,

723
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:03,910
I'll take you

724
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:06,170
to the old restaurant on Pingjiang Road.

725
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:08,990
They've been perfecting their craft for 50 years.

727
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,590
Mr. Li never dines out.

728
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:17,470
These days,

729
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:20,960
with the war spreading across the country,

730
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,710
it's hard

731
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:26,440
to enjoy local delicacies.

732
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:28,310
Fortunately,

733
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:30,750
we still have Suzhou

734
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:34,750
and its mutton.

735
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:35,790
Yes.

736
00:35:36,850 --> 00:35:37,720
Jinhai

737
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,180
has always been smart.

738
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:41,760
He's a seasoned spy.

739
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:43,180
Who would've thought

740
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:44,990
he'd end up being taken down

741
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:47,140
by a new trainee in the training class?

742
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,630
Jinhai

743
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:51,020
was careless.

744
00:35:52,970 --> 00:35:55,990
Zhou, Kondo from No. 90...

745
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,260
That Japanese

746
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:58,970
is hard to deal with.

747
00:35:59,350 --> 00:36:00,180
He must

748
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,660
be a real nuisance for you.

749
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:04,130
Mr. Li,

750
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:07,330
perhaps you could speak to Chief Seiki

751
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:09,830
about transferring him to the front lines.

752
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:11,300
Kondo Masao

753
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:15,060
graduated from the Imperial Japanese Army Academy in 1930,

754
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:18,480
a year ahead of Haruki.

755
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,350
During the February 26 Incident in Japan,

756
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:23,550
he was said to be one of the masterminds.

757
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:26,590
If it weren't for his influential family background,

758
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:28,120
he and the other extremists

759
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:30,310
would have been executed.

760
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,300
I heard

761
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:40,200
Kondo wants Gu Yizhong

762
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:43,050
to deliver an appointment letter to his father.

763
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:48,610
These Japanese are really naive

764
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:51,710
if they think Gu Xixing will listen to them.

765
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:53,790
Not only will the birthday banquet be held,

766
00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:55,650
but it will also be a grand affair.

767
00:36:56,990 --> 00:36:59,590
We'll invite all the notable people in Suzhou.

768
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:02,510
I've been in hiding for four years

769
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,120
and I don't want to hide anymore.

770
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:09,400
By the way,

772
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:13,150

773
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:13,590
Yes.

774
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:16,250
How's the food?

775
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:17,610
It's good.

776
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:21,730
I never thought

777
00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:23,730
someone of Mr. Li's stature

778
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:25,190
would be so approachable.

779
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:26,350
Zhifei,

780
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,990
thank you for introducing me to Mr. Li.

781
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:30,870
No need for thanks.

782
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:32,750
We're all brothers here.

783
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:35,270
Why have you changed cars again?

784
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:38,880
German-made, bulletproof.

785
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:41,030
Even a machine gun can't penetrate it.

786
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:43,480
I'll ask someone

787
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,750
to get you a new one.

788
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:46,870
No need.

789
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:48,650

790
00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:50,180

792
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:54,640

793
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,120
Sorry, Zemin.

794
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,510
I didn't get you the appointment letter.

795
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:03,040
The equipment you bought is wasted.

796
00:38:09,310 --> 00:38:09,950
How about

797
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:12,800

798
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,830
Chairman Gao.

799
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:15,560
Forget it.

800
00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:18,230
I've lost all hope.

801
00:38:18,310 --> 00:38:19,630
You don't look like

802
00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:21,170
someone who's lost hope.

803
00:38:24,290 --> 00:38:25,540
To be honest,

804
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:29,400
even though Gu Xixing has the appointment letter,

805
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:32,180
it's not certain he'll become the magistrate.

806
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:34,810
Nothing is set in stone until the end.

807
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:38,040
Mr. Li seemed

808
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:39,290
to appreciate you

809
00:38:40,410 --> 00:38:41,270
How about this?

810
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:42,890
I'll prepare a big gift

811
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,080
for Mr. Li

812
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:45,570
and send it over tomorrow.

813
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:48,680
I'll prepare yours too.

814
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:51,280
Aren't you disheartened?

815
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:57,120
We can discuss my gift later.

816
00:38:57,270 --> 00:38:59,330
Just make sure Mr. Li's gift is ready.

817
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:02,430
I need you to help me with something.

818
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:03,720
Go ahead.

819
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:06,350
Jinhai's death was unjust.

821

Yes.
