That's right.

14
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:07,360
Haimo,

15
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,550
kowtow to your father-in-law.

16
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,360
No need to do that.

17
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,910
We can't be impolite.

18
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:24,460
Please,

19
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:26,070
have a seat.

20
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,720
Zhang Yuquan is my uncle.

21
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:30,120
My maiden name is Li.

22
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,220
My short-lived husband is surnamed Weng,

23
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,990
so everyone calls me Mrs. Weng.

24
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,550
Haimo is an unlucky one.

25
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:40,250
At 11,

26
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,350
my aunt died of illness.

27
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:44,150
Uncle took her

28
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:46,920
to make a living by singing in the restaurants and tea houses

29
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,920
in Guangzhou.

30
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:51,050
In 1938,

31
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,240
the Japanese broke into Guangzhou.

32
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,960
One day, the Japanese in Shamian

33
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:58,360
insisted on listening to the story-telling and ballad-singing in Suzhou dialect.

34
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,650
They asked my uncle to sing for them in their barracks.

35
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:02,510
Uncle would rather die than obey,

36
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:04,190
so he smashed his Sanxian.

37
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:05,830
In the end,

38
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,090
he was beaten to death

39
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:11,480
by the cursed Japanese.

40
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:15,520
Better a glorious death than a shameful life.

41
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:18,210
That does sound like Yuquan's dignity.

42
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:22,420
Poor Haimo.

43
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:24,630
She lost both her mother and father.

44
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:27,230
Yuquan's family

45
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,590
is my family.

46
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:31,510
I knew

47
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:34,230
you were a loyal man, Mr. Gu.

48
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:36,960
Yuquan and I

49
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:39,520
got to know each other at Huangpu, Guangzhou.

50
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:40,710
In 1926,

51
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:43,150
Chiang betrayed the revolution

52
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:45,350
and stirred up the Zhongshan Incident.

53
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:46,550
At that period,

54
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:49,490
assassinations were rampant in Guangzhou.

55
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,910
Someone offered 100,000 silver dollars

56
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:53,630
to get me killed.

57
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,510
At that critical moment,

58
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:58,500
if Yuquan hadn't

59
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:01,190
hidden me at home for 17 days,

60
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,850
I would have been dead long ago.

61
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:05,310
At that time,

62
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:06,990
Yuquan and I

63
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:08,470
arranged the marriage between Yizhong

64
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:10,390
and Miss Haimo.

65
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:11,860
Later,

66
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:13,630
I went north with the army

67
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:16,029
and was then demobilized in Suzhou.

68
00:04:16,029 --> 00:04:17,890
I was drifting from place to place

69
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,970
and thus lost contact with Yuquan.

70
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:25,530
Miss Haimo.

71
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:26,890
Come here.

72
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:28,150
Hurry.

73
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:30,110
Let Uncle Gu take a good look at you.

74
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:40,080
You still look the same as when you were young.

75
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:41,870
Back then,

76
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:45,409
you served me fish and egg soup every day.

77
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:47,000
Do you still remember?

78
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:50,790
Okay, don't worry.

79
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:54,130
Take my home as your own home.

80
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:56,620
If you don't mind,

81
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:57,710
stay here.

82

83

84
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,300
Thank you, Mr. Gu.

86
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:10,990
was indebted to you and your father.

87
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,860

Sorry for the bad conditions here.

111
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:26,920
Since the "pacification" operation,

the stubborn and collaborationist forces of the enemy's

113

114

116
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:34,150
were completely destroyed.

117
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:35,550
And some of our comrades were sacrificed.

118
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:37,220
So, we have to be vigilant

119
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:39,360
and increase the safety measures.

120

133
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:11,710
we suspect there's a traitor inside the organization.

134
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:13,040
Don't mention that now.

135

136

all about what happened recently.

137
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:21,350
The night before the operation,

138
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:24,030
I received a call from Xiao Junxia from Shanghai.

139
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:27,230
He asked for a planimetric map of the Garden of Pleasance.

140
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:33,810
This is a little gift from me.

141
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:35,430
Please accept it.

142
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,150
What do you mean?

143
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:39,990
This marriage

144
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,600
was decided by me and Yuquan together.

145
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:45,710
I won't deny it.

146
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,760
But we've lost contact for so many years,

147
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:50,880
and the children have grown up.

148
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:52,420
Yizhong

149
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,159
has fallen in love with someone else.

150
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,409
Although I'm old,

151
00:07:58,159 --> 00:07:59,820
it's a new society, after all,

152
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:02,750
so I know marriage cannot be forced.

153
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:04,550
I'm ashamed.

154
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,070
I apologize to you

155
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,480
on behalf of my son.

156
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:13,150

157
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:13,830
Look.

158
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:15,110
See?

159
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,610
Sworn brothers, bosom friends…

160
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,670
Those only exist in the operas.

161
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,160
People tend to favor the wealthy,

162
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,850
making it difficult to consider the plight of the less fortunate.

163
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:24,530
Haimo.

164
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,040
Go ahead.

165
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,640
Haimo,

166
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,530
not only does Mr. Gu want to break off the engagement,

167
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:41,570
but he also wants to kick us out.

168
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:42,169
No.

169
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:45,830
You misunderstood me.

170
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:47,990
I just said

171
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:50,790
this marriage wouldn't work out,

172
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,550
but I never meant to drive you away.

173
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:55,490
If you are willing,

174
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,310
you can take Gu's Garden as your home.

175
00:08:58,910 --> 00:08:59,550
I will also

176
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:01,720
take Miss Haimo

177
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:04,860
as my own daughter.

just let me know.

00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:06,120
The 6th Division, New Fourth Army.

192
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:09,070
He's from the 8th Company, 3rd Battalion, New 1st Regiment,

193
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:11,020
16th Brigade, 6th Division, New Fourth Army.

194
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,240
It's quite detailed.

195
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:15,680
Where is this Liu Qiangbao

196
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:17,170
at the moment?

197
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:19,050
He didn't escape.

198
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:20,620
He's sacrificed.

199
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,590
What you said

200
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:28,310
is somewhat odd.

201
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,510
No. 90 execution ground

202
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:33,950
isn't a place from which you can escape easily.

203
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:34,480
Besides,

204
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:36,510
Liu Qiangbao died.

205
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,110
In your opinion,

206
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:40,090
who is the traitor?

207
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:44,050
Eagle is the most suspicious.

208
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,600
What do you think?

209
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:49,910
I also suspect it's Eagle.

210
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:50,390
Sir.

211
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:51,290
Come in.

212
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:54,790
Eagle.

213
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:58,000
Okay.

214
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:01,310
Let me introduce him.

215
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:03,090
This is Comrade Zhou Zhenwu,

216
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,390
whose alias is Eagle.

217
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:06,720
He's our liaison in our Suzhou office

218
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:08,130
of the New Fourth Army.

219
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:09,320
Section Chief Wang.

220
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,390
Now, Zhenwu,

221
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:13,650
tell us what happened.

222
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:16,150
The Garden of Pleasance operation failed,

223
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:17,950
and Sitong Rice Store was taken.

224
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:19,300
I quickly sent someone to inform

225
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,460
Comrade Hu Zhiping.

226
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:22,210
The comrade who rushed there found

227
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:24,390
that Hu Zhiping's residence was full of the Japs.

228
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:26,450
Hu Zhiping and his wife were missing.

229
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:28,310
I had made an appointment with Hu Zhiping

230
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:30,430
to meet each other the next day at Drunk Deities Restaurant.

231
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:31,380
I must go.

232
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:34,310
I needed to confirm whether the special agent, Hu Zhiping

233
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:35,200
was safe.

234
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:37,310
But you didn't show up the next day.

235
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,030
Who said I didn’t?

236
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:44,760
Ruotong went there in my place.

237
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:47,710
I was afraid Hu Zhiping would be ambushed.

238
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,630
It is a wrong decision to send Xiao Ruotong

239
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:52,230
to inform Hu Zhiping.

240
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,230
[Unity]

241
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:54,990
You said you went to Drunk Deities Restaurant,

242
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:56,160
but what about Good Friends Cafe?

243
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,290
I was at Good Friends Cafe at that time.

244
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:00,150
Unexpectedly,

245
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:02,750
Duan Wentao showed up suddenly.

246
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:04,070
Who is Duan Wentao?

247
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:04,600
He's an agent planted in No. 90

248
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,230
by the Jiangsu Provincial Committee.

249
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:07,830
His code name is Flying Bird.

250
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,150
He had been in No. 90

251
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:10,230
as a sleeper agent.

252
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:12,390
Half a year ago,

253
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:14,840
when I went to the Suzhou liaison office of the New Fourth Army,

254
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,430
the organization activated him,

255
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:17,470
and I was the one to contact him.

256
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,270
He maintained direct contact with me only.

257
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:20,670
No one knew his identity,

258
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:22,540
except me.

259
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:26,780
Who knows if you're lying?

260
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:27,940
My cover identity

261
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:29,710
is that of a Good Friends Cafe worker.

262
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:30,920
[Receptionist]

263
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,580

264
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:32,190
This...

265
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,900
[Jiangsu Daily]

266
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:34,290
is the last piece of information

267
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:36,420
conveyed by Flying Bird with his life.

268
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:38,750
Traitor inside,

269
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:39,900
Cell 8.

270
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:39,950
[Jiangsu Daily]

271
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:47,770
[Traitor inside, Cell 8]

272
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:49,120
Cousin-in-law.

273
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:51,150
it's not appropriate.

274
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:52,740
Why not?

275
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:54,680
The Gu family broke off the engagement.

276
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,520
They did us wrong first.

277
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:58,060
Besides,

278
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:01,470
Young Master Gu only has a girlfriend.

279
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:02,950
It's not like he's married.

280
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:05,670
He's a young man from a rich family. Who knows what will happen?

281
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:08,190
Maybe he'll get tired of his girlfriend in a few days.

282
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:10,050
But we have to take up

283
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:11,540
the position in Gu's Garden.

284
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,750
Before we came, didn't you say

285
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,680
that once the thing was done, we'd…

286
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:22,020
We need to buy some clothes.

287
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:23,810
Suzhou

288
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:26,590
is as big a city as Shanghai,

289
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:29,110
not like Guangzhou.

290
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:30,890
With the way you dress,

291
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:32,940
people will look down upon you.

292
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,350
Mr. Gu won't even want to look at you.

294
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:42,650
What are you doing?

295
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:45,280
You even eavesdrop on women's conversation?

296
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:46,940
No.

297
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,180

298
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:51,110
what kind of cuisine you like.

299
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:53,140
Shandong cuisine, Canton cuisine, Chaoshan cuisine,

300
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,110
or Huaiyang cuisine?

301
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:55,260
Tell me, so can I prepare it.

302
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,390

00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:01,140
don't bully women like us

306
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:04,990
No, no. I won't.

307
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:05,720
Take care.

308
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:10,330
I'll be slower.

321
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:39,550

323
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,820
Gu Yizhong, let me ask you.

324
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:45,960
After you shot

325
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,160
at Good Friends Cafe,

326
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:49,280
did the men from No. 90 chase you?

327
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:51,780
You mean

328
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:53,950
men from No. 90

329
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:55,830
let them go on purpose.

330
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:56,650
Gu Yizhong,

331
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:58,450
as a scholar,

332
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,600
you've never been trained properly.

333
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,600
How could you escape

334
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,760
under the nose of

335
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:04,250
a dozen of the No. 90 agents?

336
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,580
Scholars are not fools.

337
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:06,700
When doing underground work,

338
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:07,870
if you've never been trained,

339
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:08,800
you are an idiot!

340
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:10,050
What do you mean?

341
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:11,470
Be polite!

00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:14,580
Xiao Ruotong.

344
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:17,390
I hope you can confess to the organization.

345
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:18,230
Confess what?

346
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,010
We didn't lie at all!

347
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,310
Comrade Xiao,

348
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,610
do you have anything to say?

349
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:27,590
That night, the people from No. 90

350
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:29,360
didn't chase us. That's true,

351
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:32,340
but they shot me and Yizhong many times.

352
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,070
It may be a fluke to escape once.

353
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:36,530
How could it still be a fluke to escape twice?

354
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,070
You escaped from the Stump Execution Ground

355
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:41,710
and broke through from Good Friends Cafe like magic.

356
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:42,370
Gu Yizhong,

357
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:44,850
do you think you are that capable?

358
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:49,360
You can't talk about ice with a summer insect!

359
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,230
Comrade Zhenwu,

360
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,810
how do you explain

361
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:57,090
the time that we were ambushed

362
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:59,110
at Drunk Deities Restaurant?

363
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,510
Gu Yizhong obviously didn't know about

364
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:02,390
our meeting.

365
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:04,390
Also,

366
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:05,950
Our address.

367
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:08,960
You rented the house.

368
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:10,560
No one knew that.

369
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,680
Gu Huizhong is Gu Yizhong's sister.

370
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:17,310
How can you prove that they didn't communicate?

371
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:18,940
Why are you making this about my sister?

372
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:20,230
You are the prime suspect.

373
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:21,630
It doesn't mean others are innocent.

374
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:23,830
You made the plans for the Garden of Pleasance operation.

375
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:24,990
Everyone participating in the operation

376
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:25,870
was sacrificed

377
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:27,110
except Yizhong and me.

378
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:28,310
Speaking of suspect,

379
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:30,250
you are the first to be suspected.

380
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:32,270
The Garden of Pleasance operation

381
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:34,200
was a task given to me by Hu Zhiping.

382
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:35,910
Hu Zhiping must be involved.

383
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,630
He provided the information about Nakanishi Tarou.

384
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:40,430
The photos

385
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:42,330
were also provided by him.

386
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:45,090
How dare you suspect Zhiping?

387
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,450
Zhiping was arrested by the Japanese in 1938.

388
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,530
He was tortured for a month.

389
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:52,980
Not one of his reporting up or reporting down was arrested.

390
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,800
How dare you doubt his loyalty to the party?

391
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,070
Do you think your husband is the only one

392
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:57,110
who is so loyal?

393
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:58,700
Every one of us is!

394
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,270
Every warrior who has been baptized on the battlefield

395
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,520
is injured!

396
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:04,410
Everyone has had a narrow escape!

397
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:07,720
What are you doing?

398
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:08,910
We are communists,

399
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:11,020
not gangsters in the street.

400
00:17:12,329 --> 00:17:14,430
Are you competing with who's worse injured?

401
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:15,560
How inappropriate!

402
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:22,640
That engagement document

403
00:17:24,569 --> 00:17:26,200
is exactly the same

404
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:27,390
as my copy.

405
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:29,650
It was written by Yuquan and me.

406
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:30,830
Sir.

407
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,670
They chose to come here at this time.

408
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:35,310
Something is fishy.

409
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:36,750
The Japs are forcing us,

410
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,480
and Young Master is in trouble.

411
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:40,630
And the one who's engaged since little just came now.

412
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:41,870
Miss Haimo

413
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,330
looks like

414
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:47,990
when she was young.

415
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,700
Her family situation matches, too.

416
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:54,470
Miss Haimo looks innocent.

417
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:55,930
I think she's the real one.

418
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:00,230
But that cousin-in-law, Mrs. Weng,

419
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,690
has a fishy background.

420
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:04,390
We must beware of

421
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,320
this so-called cousin-in-law.

422
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,390
Got it.

423
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:13,500
To be fair,

424
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,040
I shouldn't cancel the arranged marriage.

425
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:18,160
But…

426
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:22,390
you know about

427
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:24,390
Yizhong and Miss Xiao.

428
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:32,070
Filial piety, brotherly love, loyalty, and keeping one's word.

429
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:34,220
The Gu family doesn't keep our word.

430
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:46,320
[The rain-washed apricot blossoms blush with a deepening red; the sun-kissed willows unfold in tender green]

431
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:50,350
Go in.

432
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:05,220
[The rain-washed apricot blossoms blush with a deepening red; the sun-kissed willows unfold in tender green]

433
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:08,150
Zhifei.

434
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,420
[3 p.m. the day after tomorrow, Hanshan Temple, Spring]

435
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,420
[I only hope that your heart is like mine; and I won't let you down]

436
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:24,710
Spring?

437
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:26,360
She's in Suzhou?

438
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:32,660
Could it be Huang Xinzhai and his lot

439
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,570
cheating you?

440
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:35,880
This code name is used solely

441
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,710
when she contacts me.

442
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:39,880
No one else knows it except you.

443
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:47,600
She came to Suzhou now.

444
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:49,350
What does it mean?

445
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:51,910
Didn't she go to Chongqing with Xu Enzeng?

446
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:53,920
Spring has worked at CBIS for a long time.

447
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,150
Xu Enzeng has always thought highly of her.

448
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:58,410
He sent her to Suzhou in person this time.

449
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:00,350
I'm afraid the target is you and me.

450
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:03,050
I think they have something to do

451
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:05,480
with the case of Guo Jingji's murder.

452
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,690
What should we do?

453
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:10,830
Betrayal? Going back?

454
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:11,590
Betrayal?

455
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:14,090
Are you able to do that?

456
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:16,700
Mr. Li and I are sworn brothers.

457
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:18,750
If I leave,

458
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:20,830
how could he let me go easily?

459
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:22,510
Besides,

460
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,920
it's been a few years. Even if we go back now,

461
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,520
Xu Enzeng wouldn't trust us.

462
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,250
I think it's good to be at No. 90 now.

463
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,440
Today's situation

464
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,310
wasn't so easy to get.

465
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,810
Then, let's just follow the Japanese.

466
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:39,540
We have to go all the way, whichever way we choose.

467
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:43,070
Zhifei,

468
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:45,480
how about we strike first?

469
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:46,190
No.

470
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:47,590
Zhifei.

471
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,020
If you ask me, Spring is a potential threat.

472
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:50,710
Enough.

473
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:52,400
Zhifei, let me say one more thing.

474
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,830
I heard that Ding's incident

475
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:55,230
was schemed by the CBIS.

476
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:56,030
They're good at the honey trap.

477
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:56,710
Enough!

478
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:03,170
After all,

479
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:05,880
I was the one who let her down first.

480
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:08,190
Zhifei,

481
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:12,070
I have something that I've been

482
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,140
wanting to ask you for many years,

483
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:16,020
but I haven't been daring to ask you.

484
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:16,950
Then, don't ask.

485
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,340
Back then,

486
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,810
all of us thought

487
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:28,320
you and Spring were a perfect match.

488
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:30,510
Why didn't you two end up together?

489
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,750
We met in 1927.

490
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,880
She is my first love.

491
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:45,890
Not long after we got together,

492
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:47,570
we separated

493
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:49,790
because we chose different sides.

494
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:51,710
In 1931,

495
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,270
Gu Shunzhang betrayed us.

496
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,630
I was arrested.

497
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,120
I don't know if it's fate

498
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,950
or if someone did it on purpose,

499
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:02,040
but coincidentally,

500
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,440
the person who interrogated me was Spring.

501
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:06,660
We met again like that.

502
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:09,300
We…

503
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:13,030
If I hadn't been married

504
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,560
and just had Youfei,

505
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:17,720
I'm afraid we'd get back together.

506
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,490
This time, will you meet

507
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:20,670
Spring or not?

508
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,540
With her character,

509
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:26,490
she won't give up

510
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:28,610
if she doesn't get to see us.

511
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:31,150
You go and see her.

512
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:34,420
And then send her back to Chongqing.

513
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:36,950
Let me tell you,

514
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:39,510
this thing must be kept top secret.

515
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,070
If the Japanese

516
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:42,790
or Mr. Li knows about this,

517
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:46,280
I'm afraid both of us will die.

518
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:47,870
Got it.

537
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:56,650
Director, we received a telegram.

No. 8, Chongshan Island, West Taihu Lake.

539
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,360
Send a copy to Kondo immediately.

540
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:10,000
This is me.

[Chongshan Island, West Taihu Lake]

542
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:11,700
what I got from Gu Yizhong.

543
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:14,490
This paper recorded in detail

544
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:16,470
the location of the Chongshan Island base.

545
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:17,600
That's impossible.

546
00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:19,150
Gu Yizhong doesn't even

547
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:20,630
know how to use the radio.

548
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:23,350
I don't believe it's Gu Yizhong, no matter what.

549
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:24,750
The New 1st Regiment, 16th Brigade, 6th Division

550
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:25,950
has replied to us.

00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:28,310
In the 8th Company, 3rd Battalion of their Regiment,

552
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:30,640
there's no one called Liu Qiangbao at all.

553
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:31,670
Besides,

554
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,230
when the military doctor dressed

555
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:35,550
Gu Yizhong's wound,

556
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:38,030
he found his wound very suspicious.

557
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:39,980
The possibility that he had hurt himself couldn't be ruled out.

558
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:41,550
And he knows clearly

559
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:42,460
this place is

560
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,190
called Chongshan Island.

561
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:45,430
Gu Yizhong has been lying all this time.

562
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:46,670
Our Gu family

563
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:47,630
is a family

564
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:50,240
which values reputation more than our lives.

565
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:52,370
Yizhong would never do such a thing.

566
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:52,710
Sit down.

567
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:53,190
I was...

568
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:54,750
Please sit down!

569
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:56,780
Okay.

570
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:15,110
Huizhong.

571
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:19,400
How is it?

572
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:22,110
Do they still think Yizhong is the traitor?

573
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:23,870
The Enemy Intelligence Section

574
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:25,130
has sentenced Gu Yizhong to death.

575
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:26,180
What?

576
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:27,560
How can it be?

577
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:29,180
The judicial committee

578
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:31,560
had three votes in favor and two against.

579
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:34,200
It's just a verdict of the Enemy Intelligence Section of the Division.

580
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:37,660
They still need to apply to their superiors for the execution.

581
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:39,310
Don't worry. I'll find a way

582
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,910
to file a complaint to the Ministry of Political Affairs of the New Fourth Army.

583
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:42,710
I believe

584
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:43,840
the higher-ups

585
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:45,480
will tell right from wrong.

586
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:48,430
Ruotong!

587
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,060
Yizhong can't be a traitor.

588
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:53,790
I brought him up.

589
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:54,890
He's a righteous person,

590
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:56,830
and he has a strong sense of right and wrong.

591
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:58,310
He may be impulsive,

592
00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:00,230
but it's impossible for him

593
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:02,380
to ever betray our country and people!

594
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:03,600
Huizhong,

595
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:05,070
our priority

596
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:06,650
is to relocate immediately.

597
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:07,970
Our base is exposed.

598
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:11,280
Take cover!

599
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:19,420
Hurry!

600
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,140
Huizhong.

601
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:21,740
The water broke.

602
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:24,600
Hurry!

603
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:27,480
What's going on?

604
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:31,650
Comrade!

605
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:32,710
I'm still here!

606
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:34,190
Yizhong, Yizhong!

607
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:34,720
Ruotong!

608
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:35,440
Yizhong!

609
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:36,950
Yizhong.

610
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:37,920
Ruotong, trust me.

611
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:38,770
I'm not a traitor.

612
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:39,710
I didn't kill him.

613
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:40,940
Of course I trust you.

614
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:42,030
The base is exposed.

615
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:44,030
All the people have been relocated.

616
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:49,580
Yizhong.

617
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:51,050
As long as you trust me.

618
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:51,860
Let's go.

619
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:04,190
The organization has verified it.

620
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:05,750
There's no one

621
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:06,510
called Liu Qiangbao.

622
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:07,230
Impossible.

623
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:08,910
I don't know what went wrong,

624
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:10,110
but now the organization has identified

625
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:11,110
you as a traitor.

626
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,130
Leave now. You must leave.

627
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:13,700
No.

628
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,820
I'll stay with you.

629
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:17,410
Xiao Ruotong, what are you doing?

630
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:18,550
Yizhong,

631
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,120
you have to prove your innocence.

632
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:20,960
Understand?

633
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:22,030
Run!

634
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:22,770
Ruotong.

635
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:23,440
Run!

636
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:24,730
Gu Yizhong, stop!

637
00:29:24,770 --> 00:29:26,740
Gu Yizhong, stop!

638
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:28,480
Don't go!

639
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,110
Gu Yizhong is a traitor.

640
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:31,130
How can you let him go?

641
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:32,510
Do you have no respect for rules and regulations?

642
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:33,560
He's not!

643
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:38,950
Go!

644
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:39,630
Leave me alone.

645
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:40,340
Hurry!

646
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:42,970
Zhiping!

647
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,790
Quick, send her to the boat. I'll cover you.

648
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:49,480
Yes!

649
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:50,670
-Zhiping!
-Go.

650
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:51,980
Ye, come with me.

651
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,760
Yes!

652
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:15,080
Leave me alone.

653
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,320
Leave me alone.

654
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:17,800
Go!

655
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:19,560
Leave me alone!

656
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:34,670
Huizhong!

657
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:37,790
Zhiping.

658
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:42,410
Zhiping!

659
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:47,040
Zhiping!

660
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:49,870
Zhiping!

661
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:57,600
Huizhong!

662
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,270
Huizhong!

663
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,380
Sister.

664
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:01,630
Sister.

665
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:02,580
It's okay now.

666
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:04,150
Gu Yizhong.

667
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:06,110
Are you a traitor or not?

668
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:07,880
How could I be a traitor?

669
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:08,840
Trust me.

670
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:11,650
How was the base exposed?

671
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,200
Look outside.

672
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:16,370
So many comrades are sacrificed.

673
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:17,770
It's all because of you.

674
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:19,280
You have to trust me.

675
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:20,830
I want to trust you, too.

676
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:22,640
Why did you become a traitor?

677
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:24,000
Why? Why?

678
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:24,880
Sister.

679
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:26,630
Are you a traitor or not?

680
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:28,010
Are you a traitor or not?

681
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:28,990
Are you crazy, Huizhong?

682
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:30,370
This is your brother!

683
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:33,130
Sister.

684
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:36,350
Brother-in-law, take my sister away.

685
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,090
I'll distract the Japs.

686
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,240
Take my sister away!

687
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:39,900
Yizhong!

688
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:40,850
Yizhong!

689
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:42,310
Take care of my sister.

690
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:06,890
I dispatched the army, navy, and air force,

691
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:09,620
but the New Fourth Army still got away! Darn it!

692
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:11,510
Exactly.

693
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:14,330
Director Zhou, you've made a big fool of yourself.

694
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:15,710
What big fool?

695
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:17,400
Who are you calling a fool?

696
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:21,710
Sir.

697
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:25,670
My information is accurate.

698
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:28,620
The New Fourth Army is on Chongshan Island.

699
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:30,750
Whether they're eliminated or not

700
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:32,230
has nothing to do with us.

701
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:33,520
Did Cell 8's…

702
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:34,550
Shut up!

703
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:39,820
Now,

704
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:42,800
only one thing is fortunate for us.

705
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:44,790
The New Fourth Army's

706
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:46,390
command center was exposed.

707
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:47,110
Next,

708
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:49,030
who is the first to be suspected?

709
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:50,410
That's Gu Yizhong.

710
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:51,920
Soon,

711
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:53,380
his identity as a traitor

712
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:55,190
will be confirmed by the Communist Party.

713
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:55,920
In this way,

714
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:57,620
his father, Gu Xixing,

715
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:01,080
will have no choice but to participate in the peace movement.

716
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,920
You said Gu Xixing

717
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:05,110
is a man who wouldn't participate in the peace movement

718
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:06,910
even if his child is killed.

719
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:08,530
Isn't that so?

720
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:11,030
Gu Yizhong used to be a communist,

721
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:13,790
So the old man dared to say that.

722
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:15,610
But what if he is a traitor?

723
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:17,230
Even if we don't kill him,

724
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:18,780
someone will.

725
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:19,920
At that time,

726
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:22,910
between Gu Xixing and the Communist Party,

727
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,790
there would be a blood feud.

728
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:26,070
In this way,

729
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:29,030
Gu Xixing will get involved soon.

730
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:33,660
Huang!

731
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:34,960
What do you think?

732
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:39,120
It's a long story, Sir.

733
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:41,140
According to Records of the Three Kingdoms,

734
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:42,710
the best strategy is to win over hearts and minds.

735
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:43,310
Enough.

736
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:43,970
Attacking…

737
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:46,240
All of you, get out.

738
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:47,350
Yes.

739
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:52,170
Zhou Zhifei.

740
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:53,070
Wait.

741
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,350
I forgot.

742
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:55,790
There's good news.

743
00:33:58,450 --> 00:33:59,690
The Ministry of Education and Culture of the Empire

744
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:01,390
has issued two student placements for pupils

745
00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:03,610
in Suzhou for studying in Japan.

746
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:06,590
Your son is on the list.

747
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:09,110
Sir... No.

748
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:10,280
My son is too young.

749
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:10,830
Zhou...

750
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:12,030
This is the Empire's

751
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:13,840
top prize for the Chinese

752
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:14,900
who are loyal to us.

753
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:17,560
Minister Zhou's son

754
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:18,710
and President Mei's daughter

755
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:19,840
are both on the list.

756
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,380
The grandson of Chairman Gao

757
00:34:22,409 --> 00:34:25,139
and your son are the only two in Jiangsu Province.

758
00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:27,870
You must cherish the honor given by the Empire.

759
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:32,860
Got it.

760
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:42,560
Thank you.

761
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:51,190
Director.

762
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:53,230
What does Mr. Kondo mean?

763
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:55,280
If you send your son to Kyoto,

764
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:56,030
then…

765
00:34:57,310 --> 00:35:00,040
wouldn't that make him a hostage of the Japanese?

766
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:05,330
You like Japan so much.

767
00:35:05,850 --> 00:35:07,380
Why don't I talk to Mr. Kondo

768
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:09,150
to give my son's place to your son?

769
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:09,670
Okay?

770
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:10,600
No.

771
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:12,550
My son is still young.

772
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:13,830
And you're the director of our station.

773
00:35:13,830 --> 00:35:15,230
I'm just a vice director.

774
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:24,300
♫She has a melon-seed-shaped face♫

775
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:27,810
♫Her brows are like willow leaves and her eyes have tender, lingering looks♫

776
00:35:27,850 --> 00:35:30,040
♫She has a delicate nose and a red cherry-like little mouth♫

777
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:32,380
♫A big, big flower♫

778
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:40,590
♫Tucked at her temple♫

779
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:42,030
Good, Miss Haimo.

780
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:44,030
Enough.

781
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:48,030
I've heard to my heart's content.

782
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:50,380
I'm even sweating.

783
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:51,410
Mr. Gu.

784
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:53,550
I've embarrassed myself.

785
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,360
Not at all.

786
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:55,800
You played well.

787
00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:57,820
I became friends with your father

788
00:35:57,990 --> 00:36:00,650
because I listened to his Northeast Beginning.

789
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:02,930
You sing as well as him now.

790
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:05,070
When my father taught me,

791
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,990
he said our family's Zhang school Yu tune

792
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:09,670
actually incorporates Ma Rufei's Ma tune,

793
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:12,870
emphasizing a seamless flow of sounds like flowing clouds and running water.

794
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:16,310
The sound is still there, but the old friend is gone.

795
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:19,330
Since the Japanese occupied Suzhou,

796
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,540
and Mr. Xue and Mr. Shen went to Chongqing,

797
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:24,860
I've never heard

798
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,370
such good story-telling and ballad-singing in Suzhou dialect.

799
00:36:27,370 --> 00:36:28,770
Mrs. Wang, give me a hand…

800
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:32,300
Mr. Gu, you're here.

801
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:34,290
Why did you buy so many things?

802
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:35,550
I walked from one end to the other

803
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:36,680
of Guanqian Street.

804
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:37,790
I didn't buy much stuff.

805
00:36:37,790 --> 00:36:39,310
This is all I have.

806
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:42,230
They all say Suzhou is more prosperous than Shanghai.

807
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:44,430
I think it's just better than Hong Kong.

808
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,220
You've even been to Hong Kong?

809
00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:52,050
We lived in Guangzhou before.

810
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:54,530
Of course we have been to Hong Kong.

811
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:55,950
Mrs. Weng,

812
00:36:56,810 --> 00:36:59,670
if you're going shopping in Guanyung Street again,

813
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:02,250
ask Fugui to go with you.

814
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:04,570
Let him help you carry things.

815
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:38,570
It's all your fault.

816
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:40,030
You disrespected Kondo

817
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:41,030
and offended him.

818
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:43,830
Youfei is still so young.

819
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:45,880
How can he study abroad?

820
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:47,030
Listen.

821
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:48,750
I don't agree.

822
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:50,070
Go tell the Japanese.

823
00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:51,230
That's not my thing.

824
00:37:51,410 --> 00:37:53,050
I don't care about your work,

825
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:55,560
but you must make our kid stay here.

826
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:04,030
How about this?

827
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:04,740
Zhou,

828
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:07,690
go apologize to Kondo.

829
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:09,430
I can give him the dozens of

830
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:10,910
yellow croakers I saved.

831
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:12,170
What else does he like?

832
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:13,310
He must love antiques, right?

833
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:16,030
We have some vases from the Ming Dynasty, right?

834
00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:16,990
Give them all to him!

835
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:18,870
I won't give in to Kondo.

836
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:20,710
If I bow to Kondo,

837
00:38:20,830 --> 00:38:22,690
how can I lead No. 90 in the future?

838
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:23,510
You're a traitor.

839
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:25,470
How can you still have a sense of honor?

840
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:26,950
I don't care!

841
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:29,510
There's no way to send the child away.

842
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:31,630
Oh my god, this is my only son.

843
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:33,460
You want to send him away? No way.

844
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:34,320
Or I...

845
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:35,630
I'll go to Shanghai.

846
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:37,370
I'll go beg Mr. Li. Is it okay?

847
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:39,970
Isn't he close to Haruki or Kagesa

848
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,010
or what is the name?

849
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:42,230
Stop embarrassing yourself.

850
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:43,030
Okay?

851
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,190
We are nothing.

852
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,890
Mr. Mei's eldest daughter

853
00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:48,880
and Minister Zhou's younger son

854
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,120
both went to Japan.

855
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:51,870
And the chairman of Jiangsu Province…

856
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:53,590
His grandson is on the list, too.

857
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:54,670
What are you comparing with them? Status

858
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:55,810
or money?

859
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:58,240
I'm nothing!

860
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:00,720
Zhou.

861
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:03,180
Youfei can't leave.

862
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:07,110
Youfei can't leave. No.

863
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:08,860
I only have this one son.

864
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:09,750
If he's sent away,

865
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:11,470
I'll jump into the Taihu Lake.

866
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,750
You all force me.

867
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:16,350
If you jump,

868
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:17,710
why don't we jump together?

869
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:19,640
Our whole family can die together!

870
00:39:19,930 --> 00:39:21,070
If it weren't for you

871
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:22,020
and this family,

872
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:24,160
do I have to bow to the Japanese?

873
00:39:25,370 --> 00:39:26,910
Do I need to be a traitor?

874
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:45,670
Dad.

875
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,330
Sorry. The horizontal stroke is too thick again.

876
00:39:48,330 --> 00:39:49,090
It's okay.

877
00:39:50,450 --> 00:39:51,780
It's fine if it's thick.

878
00:39:53,170 --> 00:39:55,910
Let's call it a day.

879
00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:57,190
Go have a rest.

880
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:58,570
I want to practice more.

881
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:40,690
Why don't you knock before coming in?

882
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,110
Why do I have to knock on the door of my own room?

883
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:43,630
Others will find it weirder.

884
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:45,270
You made Mr. Gu pleased.

885
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:46,900
You did a good job.

886
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:51,300
He really understands story-telling and ballad-singing in Suzhou dialect.

887
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:53,830
He even gave me a monthly ticket to a storytelling theatre.

888
00:40:53,830 --> 00:40:55,030
What else did he say?

889
00:40:56,270 --> 00:40:56,830
Nothing.

890
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:08,830
Didn't I ask you to find out

891
00:41:08,830 --> 00:41:10,670
where Young Lady and Young Master Gu went?

892
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:12,190
You're being disobedient again.

893
00:41:12,190 --> 00:41:13,400
I told you before we came

894
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,470
that you have to report to me

895
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:16,070
what you see and hear in time.

896
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:18,070
I'm not in your line of work.

897
00:41:18,270 --> 00:41:19,200
I don't know how.

898
00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:23,950
What do you mean by "our line of work"?

899
00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:25,160
What do we do?

900
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:32,180
If you dare to ruin my plan,

901
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:33,920
even if I don't kill you,

902
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:36,820
your brother will die anyway.

903
00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:39,470
Captain Dai from the flight group

904
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:41,470
is waiting for my reply every month.

905
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:03,140
Yizhong, why are you soaked?

906
00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:04,660
You really got me into trouble.

907
00:42:04,370 --> 00:42:06,070
[Manager of Yizhong Architecture Research Society, Lu Zheng]

908
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:06,750
A few armed men came this afternoon.

909
00:42:06,970 --> 00:42:08,150
They said if I have news about you,

910
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:09,410
I should inform No. 90.

911
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:11,630
Yizhong, you...

912
00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:17,070
Why are you running a high fever?

913
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:19,190
Cold. Cold.

914
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:24,740
I'll get you some medicine.

915
00:42:30,470 --> 00:42:31,700
Who is Eagle?

916
00:42:32,310 --> 00:42:34,140
You escaped from the Stump Execution Ground

917
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:36,260
and broke through from Good Friends Cafe like magic.

918
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:38,400
Do you think you are that capable?

919
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:40,070
The organization has verified it.

920
00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:40,630
There is no one

921
00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:42,110
called Liu Qiangbao.

922
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:43,950
Run!

923
00:42:43,970 --> 00:42:46,190
Why did you become a traitor?
