00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:55,400
Second,

383
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,280
as you all know,

384
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:59,370
I came from Chongqing

385
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:01,960
under the instructions of Mr. Dai.

386
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:04,060
Mr. Dai said

387
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:06,620
some friends

388
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,510
in Suzhou

389
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:11,020
need special care.

390
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,280
Next,

391
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:17,950
we'll call the roll.

392
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:20,750
If you're here, say "Here"

393
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:22,280
and come onto the stage.

394
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:24,630
Yes.

395
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:28,060
Gao Guanwu.

396
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:28,870
Here!

397
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:32,550
Great!

398
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:37,150
Wan Lilang.

399
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:38,460
Here!

400
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:40,910
Good. Good.

401
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:45,070
Wang Zemin.

402
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:45,890
Here. Here.

403
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:50,000
Xie Wenchao.

404
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:51,530
Thank you, Sir.

405
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:53,610
Wu Yihe.

406
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:54,180
Here!

407
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,550
Chen Dengshu.

408
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:02,190
Me, me, me.

409
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,770
Chen Sinian.

410
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:05,630
Here.

411
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:08,870
He Moning.

412
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:09,510
Here.

413
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:13,070
Zheng Donghua.

414
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:13,780
I'm here!

415
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:17,610
Han Renyi.

416
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:18,990
Here. Here.

417
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:22,350
Zhao Yongchang.

418
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:26,510
Sir, that's all.

419
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:29,910
Commissioner Zhou.

420
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:31,200
What about us?

421
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:35,650
[Springtime in Harmony and Clarity]

422
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,300
Is everyone here?

423
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:32,950
Yes.

424
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:34,750
No hurry.

425
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:36,430
Next time.

426
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:39,650
Everyone.

427
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,430
The National Government has issued

428
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:44,470
the Regulations for Punishing Traitors.

429
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:46,950
Mr. Dai personally wrote the list of names of the traitors.

430
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:49,580
There are 4,753 traitors

431
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:51,810
in total in the whole country.

432
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,830
45 of them are in Jiangsu Province,

433
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:57,710
and 13 of whom are in Suzhou.

434
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:00,190
Now,

435
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,970
all the traitors in Suzhou

436
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:04,510
are already on the stage.

437
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:06,360
Step back.

438
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:07,810
-Zhifei.
-Back off!

[Springtime in Harmony and Clarity]

00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,190
You know my contribution

441
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:10,210
to the Kuomintang.

442
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:11,470
This is uncalled for, is it?

443
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:12,350
Zhou,

444
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:13,510
you're such a jerk!

445
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:14,670
You called us here for dinner,

446
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:15,770
but it turned out to be a trap!

447
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:17,000
Exactly!

448
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:18,210
Take them away!

449
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:21,830
Go!

450
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:22,750
Zhou Zhifei!

451
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,030
Zhifei! Zhifei!

452
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:27,060
I still have gold bars.

Everyone,

to those traitors who were on the stage.

00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,070
I hope all of you

continue to serve our party.

Are you Mrs. Gu?

477
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:56,770
Director Lin, the guest is here.

478
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:05,470
Are you Mrs. Gu?

00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,750
Yes, you are…

00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:10,030
My surname is Lin.

481
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:11,550
I'm Lin Guoping, the former director

This is Chief of Staff Chen.

484
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:17,470
Hello, Mrs. Gu.

485
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,160
Have a seat.

486
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:28,790
Any proof?

487
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:30,350
Sorry.

488
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:31,590
I understand.

We have a letter

490

from Mr. Gu to Division Commander Luo.

491
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:36,910
I was there.

492
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:40,380
Mr. Gu saved my life.

[Dear Wuqiang]

494
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:47,610
It is his handwriting.

495
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:51,150
The Party saw the missing person notice you published

496
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:53,030
and sent me to contact you.

497
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:54,910
What about Luo Wuqiang?

498
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:58,070
Division Commander Luo has crossed the Yangtze River and gone north.

499
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:00,630
The two parties are negotiating in Chongqing.

500
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:02,890
To show our determination to seek peace,

501
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:05,430
we decided to give up the area of Jiangsu and Shanghai.

502
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:06,990
The New Fourth Army in South Jiangsu

503
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:09,110
have all been transferred to North Jiangsu

504
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:11,110
and the base of the Dabie Mountains.

505
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:14,150
You've given up Suzhou?

506
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:15,930
You can't say that.

507
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:18,070
The evacuation is temporary.

508
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:19,190
We'll be back.

509
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:20,960
Mrs. Gu,

510
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:23,230
Tell us about Gu Yizhong.

511
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:26,110
We care about his situation very much.

512
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:29,670
He's locked up in Shizikou Prison.

513
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:32,790
They arrested him under the Regulations for Punishing Traitors.

514
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:34,450
The NBIS said he was a traitor.

515
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:35,950
He is not.

516
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:38,530
All these years,

517
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:40,590
he has been working for you.

518
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:43,070
You can't just abandon him.

519
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:44,190
You have to publicly testify

520
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:45,630
that he is an underground operative of the Party

521
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:47,230
and that he has been working for the anti-Japanese resistance.

522
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:48,430
Mrs. Gu, don't worry.

523
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:49,990
We're here

524
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:51,870
to especially rescue Mr. Gu.

525
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:56,100
The organization will never abandon

526
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:57,750
a comrade who has contributed greatly

527
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:59,430
to the country and the nation.

528
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:01,990
Go back and tell Comrade Gu

529
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:04,730
to make use of the prison and the court

530
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:06,630
to fight against the agents of the NBIS

531
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:08,830
and the reactionary faction of the KMT.

532
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:11,190
Do you admit that he is a comrade?

533
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:14,500
The organization knows Gu Yizhong

534
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,900
is our comrade who has lost contact with us.

535
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:17,950
All these years,

536
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:20,030
we've been trying to find

537
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:22,150
and build contact with him.

538
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:26,630
Shizikou Prison doesn't allow me in.

539
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:27,980
I can't see him, either.

540
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:29,910
We'll arrange that.

541
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:32,470
We have someone in Shizikou Prison.

542
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:35,840
Hurry up.

543
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:36,720
Hurry up.

544
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:39,030
This place is so shabby.

545
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:41,610
The NBIS are such scoundrels.

546
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:43,510
We, the Pioneer Team, have done so much work!

547
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:44,910
How can they renounce us?

548
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:45,880
Hurry up!

549
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:47,030
Hurry!

550
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:48,510
Hurry up. Go!

551
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:49,790
Get up. Hurry!

552
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:50,970
Go!

553
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:51,680
Hurry up!

554
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,430
Go! Hurry up!

555
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:54,670
Go!

556
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:56,560
Go! Move!

557
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:59,110
Hurry up!

558
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:07,180
They got in touch with me.

559
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:12,590
Luo Wuqiang?

560
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:19,630
This is a letter from him.

561
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,040
[To Gu Yizhong]

562
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:28,050
[Back then, you risked your life to save me and helped me flee from Suzhou]

563
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:28,050
[Yizhong, it's been two years since we parted]

564
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:32,460
What did he say?

565
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:34,030
They told me not to worry.

566
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,270
They will try their best

567
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:37,150
to get me out.

568
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:42,190
I'm relieved, then.

569
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:48,790
I brought you

570
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:50,350
some daily necessities.

No, I guessed it.

I really forgot.

586
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:48,230
Haimo,

587
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:49,910
thank you.

588
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:55,600
If I can get out this time…

589
00:28:57,430 --> 00:28:59,360
You will definitely be acquitted.

590
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:01,030
I'll find the best lawyer

591
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:04,110

and all the people in Suzhou

594
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:09,550
know

595
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:11,080
what kind of person you are.

597

and what difficulties we've been through.

598
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:19,440
It was under Japanese occupation before,

599
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:21,390
so we had no place to seek justice.

We are all Chinese.

602
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:28,070
I don't believe there's still no way to seek justice.

603
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:28,950
Nor do I believe

604
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:31,390
that people like Zhou Zhifei

605
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:32,920
won't be punished.

00:34:46,139 --> 00:34:47,590
You need Mr. Dai himself

720
00:34:49,429 --> 00:34:50,230
Do you have it?

721
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:50,889
I guess not.

722
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:55,230
I, Zhou Youren,

723
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:56,230
have it.

724
00:34:57,310 --> 00:34:59,310
I am a real underground operative.

725
00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:03,650
Shameless!

726
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:08,070
I'm not here to quarrel with you.

727
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:12,440
Yizhong,

728
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:18,170
let me tell you a piece of the latest news.

729
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:21,390
Mr. Dai's latest instruction is

730
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:25,750
that the purge of traitors this time focuses only on the positions,

731
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:26,870
not the crime.

732
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:29,470
So, we're pursuing accountability

733
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:30,830
from the top down.

734
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:32,390
For example,

735
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:35,870
A governor-level official is sentenced to death.

736
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:39,150
A minister, life sentence.

737
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:41,270
An undersecretary, seven to ten years in prison.

738
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:43,950
A chief of a bureau, three to five years.

739
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:45,670
So,

740
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:47,790
as your crime is simple,

741
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:51,020
I guess you'll only be sentenced to three years.

742
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:53,110
If you have a good attitude,

743
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:56,030
I'll plead with the judge.

744
00:35:56,590 --> 00:35:57,990
After you're convicted,

745
00:35:58,310 --> 00:35:59,310
I can get you out of there

746
00:35:59,310 --> 00:36:00,390
after a year or so.

747
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:02,070
How is it?

748
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:04,070
You said so much

749
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:06,910
just because you don't want me to expose

750
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:09,110
your atrocious crimes in court, right?

751
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:09,950
Look.

752
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:12,510
We're talking about your business.

753
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:14,370
Why do you have to get me involved?

754
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:16,230
Are you going to testify against me

755
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:17,290
in court tomorrow?

756
00:36:17,350 --> 00:36:18,030
Why?

What do you think?

759

Let's help each other.

Cut the crap.

761

Your crimes

762
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:34,570
are serious enough for you to be sentenced to death.

763
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:35,710
See you in court.

764
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:49,550

The director of the Suzhou Branch of the Political Security Bureau.

777
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:31,550
What was your occupation

778
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:33,070
before working for the Wang Regime?

779
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:35,510
An architect specializing in historic buildings at Yizhong Architecture Research Society.

780
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:37,110
Any other political status?

781
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:39,150
No.

782
00:37:39,350 --> 00:37:41,550
You've never been a member of any party,

783
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:43,280
including the Communist Party?

784
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,190
Tell the truth.

785
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:47,190
No.

786
00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:50,870
But I've participated in the Communist Party's operation

787
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:52,630
as an active applicant.

788
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:54,630
Also, I've been working for the New Fourth Army.

789

Stop.

790
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:57,950

791
00:37:58,070 --> 00:38:01,070
how you joined the Wang Regime's intelligence agency

792
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:02,700
and your experience there.

793
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:04,710
And I've been working for the New Fourth Army

794

and serving the anti-Japanese cause.

795
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:09,220
On October 12, 1941,

796
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:12,230
I accidentally participated in

797
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:14,430
an operation of the anti-Japanese underground organization

798
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:16,290

Is that all you have to say?

801
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:36,950
That's right.

802
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,260
Anything else you want to add?

803
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:41,210
Not for the moment.

804
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:44,130
Bring in the prosecution's witness.

805
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:56,590

even went as far as killing his father

816
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:29,020
to earn the trust of

817
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:30,910

the Japanese advisor at No. 90.

819
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:37,220
Everyone in Suzhou

820
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,780
knew about it at the time.

[Arresting the CPC member, Lu Junnuo]

822
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:40,910
Gu Yizhong's father, Gu Xixing,

823
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:42,910
was a senior member of the Kuomintang.

824
00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:44,950
He was also a famous general in the Northern Expedition.

825
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:48,230
He had contributed a lot to the Kuomingtang State.

826
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:50,270
Back then, he retired

827
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:52,110
and returned to live in Suzhou.

828
00:39:52,110 --> 00:39:54,710
The Japanese invited Master Gu many times

829
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:56,590
to become the magistrate of Wu County,

830
00:39:56,590 --> 00:39:59,710
but he'd rather die than obey.

831
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:01,870
But he could never have expected

832
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:04,680
that he'd be killed

833
00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:06,370
by his own son, Gu Yizhong.

834
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:09,390
Both humans and gods were outraged by this matter.

835
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:11,230
The law can't tolerate it.

836
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:21,150
Gu Yizhong,

837
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:23,790
how do you explain yourself?

838
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:28,150
Gu Yizhong.

839
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:29,200
Please answer.

840
00:40:38,830 --> 00:40:41,710
Among all Zhou Zhifei's accusations just now,

841
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:44,070
only one thing was true.

842
00:40:44,830 --> 00:40:46,910
My father did die inside No. 90.

843
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:49,270
Here's the thing.

844
00:40:51,390 --> 00:40:52,990
Zhou Zhifei and the Japanese

845
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:54,510
took me and my father

846
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:55,550
to No. 90.

847
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:58,270
He threatened my father with my life

848
00:40:58,270 --> 00:41:00,930
and forced him to be the magistrate of Wu County.

849
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:03,690
My father would rather die than obey.

850
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:05,390
In order to save my life

851
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:07,170
and protect the reputation of the Gu family,

852
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:08,380
he shot himself

853
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:10,670
in front of my eyes.

854
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:15,390
I was the only one there.

855
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:19,680
That is the truth.

856
00:41:20,310 --> 00:41:21,010
Your Honor,

857
00:41:22,310 --> 00:41:24,110
I have a document here to prove

858
00:41:24,830 --> 00:41:26,750
that after Gu Yizhong joined No. 90,

859
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:29,630
he actively supported the "pacification" operation of the Wang Regime,

860
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:31,230
promoted Japanese culture,

861
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:33,500
and corrupted the minds of our compatriots.

862
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:36,710
He also participated in eliminating the Loyal and Righteous Army

863
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:38,910
and killing the CBIS agents many times.

864
00:41:39,350 --> 00:41:40,390
That's slander!

865
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:42,950
The one who killed the CBIS agents

866
00:41:42,950 --> 00:41:43,910
was Zhou Zhifei,

867
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:45,060
which is you,

868
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:46,950
Zhou Youren.

869
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:50,360
Gu Yizhong, you should show us the evidence.

870
00:41:52,790 --> 00:41:53,620
Gu Yizhong.

871
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:56,350
According to what you just said,

872
00:41:56,350 --> 00:41:58,390
though you were working for the Wang Regime,

873
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:01,390
you've been working for the New Fourth Army in secret.

874
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:02,590
Do you have a witness?

875
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:07,060
My teacher,

876
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:10,410
who was also my handler in the CPC,

877
00:42:10,950 --> 00:42:11,830
Huang Qiushou.

878
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:13,470
Where is he?

879
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:15,350
Is he here?

880
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:17,060
In 1943,

881
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:19,310
he died, unfortunately.

882
00:42:20,870 --> 00:42:22,830
Then, after 1943,

883
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:26,150
has the CPC still had contact with you?

884
00:42:34,790 --> 00:42:35,310
No.

885
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:36,590
That means

886
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:38,510
no one can prove

887
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:40,550
you were actually helping the New Fourth Army

888
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:43,240
while you were working for the Wang Regime?

889
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:49,310
Gu Yizhong, please answer my question.

890
00:42:52,050 --> 00:42:52,980
That's correct.

891
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:56,230
Since there is no witness…

892
00:42:56,390 --> 00:42:58,470
I can prove Gu Yizhong's innocence.
