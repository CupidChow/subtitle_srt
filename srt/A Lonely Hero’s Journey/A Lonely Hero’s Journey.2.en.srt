00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,610
at the Suzhou Leyi Girls' School!

195
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,910
But you disregarded your reputation and dignity

196
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:29,470
and eloped

197
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:31,290
with your student, Gu Huizhong!

198
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,090
Then you left for ten years with her

199
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:34,750
without any news whatsoever!

200
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:37,390
Now she is pregnant

201
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:38,830
and going home to seek refuge.

202
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:40,310
Is this your so-called protection?

203
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:42,100
You're no better

204
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:43,310
than a stray dog!

205
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:45,190
Dad.

206
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,750
I don't care what you do

207
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,150
or what beliefs you have!

208
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:58,630
If a man

209
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:01,150
can't protect his woman,

210
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:03,470
then he is a loser!

211
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:05,790
You're right, Dad.

212
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:09,030

look at you.

214
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:14,030
Are you going to be on the run

215
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:15,070
with a big belly?

216
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:18,590

218
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,800
What are your plans for the future?

219
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:30,450
You have to find a safe place

The Yuqing Hall of our Gu family

222
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:39,010
upholds the four principles and eight virtues.

223
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:40,730
The eight virtues include

224
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:44,090
filial piety, brotherly love, loyalty, integrity,

225
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:47,150
propriety, righteousness, probity, and a sense of shame.

226
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:49,150
I don't expect you to have filial piety.

227
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:50,870
But you have to remember

228
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:53,050
the remaining seven virtues:

229
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:54,990
brotherly love, loyalty, integrity,

230
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:58,150
propriety, righteousness, probity, and a sense of shame.

231
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:00,410
Since you can't be there for your family,

232
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:02,630
you can't let the country down anymore!

233
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:05,360
Understand?

234
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:07,660

Give them some more money.

to a safe place.

251
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:27,830

00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:32,390

254
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:33,750
He can take us

Where are the agents?

259
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:46,200
That's strange.

260
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:48,110
They have no intention of coming in

261
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:49,730
but are standing at the door.

00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,300

Miss Ruotong, why are you here?

267
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:12,040
Come on, Dalong.

268
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:13,160
Put this down.

269
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:14,940
Go get some water with me.

270
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:15,550
Let's go.

271
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:20,590
I have to go back personally

272
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:22,270
and ask the base authorities.

273
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:23,820
How long will it take?

274
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,460
There's been a lot of tension lately.

275
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:27,920
It'll take three to five days at the soonest.

276
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:29,520
We can’t wait that long.

277
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:32,420
There's a traitor at Suzhou’s liaison point.

If we don’t report it to the organization in time,

00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:36,000
the loss will be unimaginable.

280

of this radio station.

00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:41,340
Without the organization's approval,

no one is allowed to go to the base.

285
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,340
This is an inviolable order.

286
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:46,790
The location of the base must not be exposed.

287
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:48,270
But this is an emergency.

288
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:52,780
I can use the radio station to send a telegram

289
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:54,710
to apply to the base on your behalf.

290
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:55,650
Is that okay?

291
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:58,190
Okay.

292

If there's a reply tonight,

we'll leave at three in the morning.

to find Yizhong.

00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:13,710
No, it's too dangerous.

301
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,510
Yizhong has no experience fighting against the Japs.

302
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:18,109

337
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,570
and left just as quickly.

342
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,600
Can they tell me

343
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:00,040
about their organization?

344
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:11,250
Are you in the same organization as they are?

345

00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,370
are both troublemakers.

00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:24,320
I'm not trying to hide it from you.

I know you won't object

00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:27,240
to me doing this.

351
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:29,930
Uncle Fu Gui told me

352
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:31,610
that back then, Grandpa

353
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:32,230

355
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:34,910
You also ran away from home

356
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:37,130
and applied for the Baoding Military Academy.

357
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:38,450
Fu Gui told you that?

358
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:42,050
At that time, I thought

00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:44,790
the revolution and the Northern Expedition were ongoing,

360
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:47,120
so China was going to progress from now on,

361
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,560
and the people would live a good life.

362
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:54,350
I didn't expect, after all these years,

363
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,750
that China would still be in chaos

364
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:00,390
and even attract the Japs next door.

365
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:01,310
So, Dad,

366
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,490

00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:05,030
Yes.

369

The Japs have gone too far!

370
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,610

372
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:40,990
Go.

373
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:53,770
My 60th birthday is next month.

374
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,560

572
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,130
Director Zhou,

573
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:27,470
you don't have to

574
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:29,920
keep it a secret from Mr. Kondo, right?

575
00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:35,690
Sir,

576
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:41,530
I promise you

577
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:44,170
that my Cell 8 will soon find the location

578
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:47,160
of the base of the 6th Division of the New Fourth Army.

579
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:54,870
Who is it?

580
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,300
Shuisheng, it’s me.

581
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:00,160
Yizhong!

582
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:00,790
Huizhong.

583
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:01,550
You...

584
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:05,230
You're hurt. Are you alright?

585
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:05,800
I'm fine.

586
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:07,200
Are you alright?

587
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:10,100
Do you remember Zhiping?

588
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:11,870
It's been more than ten years.

589
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:14,610
Mr. Hu.

590
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:17,030
Call him Zhiping. He is your brother-in-law.

591
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:19,300
We're officially married.

592
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:24,910
Zhiping.

593
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:28,220
I've found the lead on them.

594
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:29,670
Soon,

595
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:31,850
I'll be able to find out on which island

596
00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:33,750
the 6th Division of the New Fourth Army is hiding.

597
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:34,990
You find it?

598
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:38,060
Chen Gang has found their radio station.

599
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:40,350
It's right near the pier in Xiao Village.

600
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,940
They'll definitely go into Taihu tonight.

601
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:44,540
The lake is full of our people

602
00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:47,410
and the officers of the Water Inspection Station.

603
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:49,630
They can't escape.

604
00:33:50,410 --> 00:33:51,010
Sir,

605
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:52,720
then I beg you

606
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:53,940
to cancel the operation immediately.

607
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:55,480
This will ruin my original plan.

608
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,670
It can't be canceled.

609
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:58,230
It's all set up!

610
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:01,050
Mr. Kondo...

611
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:10,190
Is Duan Wentao the Eagle?

612
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:11,659
I can't tell you

613
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:12,560
who Eagle is.

614
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:15,270
But he's definitely not.

615
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:20,440
How did you get here?

616
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,340
We drove here.

617
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:24,230
Where is the car?

618
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:25,590
I parked it on Hengshi Street.

619
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:27,389
Hengshi Street is very close by.

620
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:29,870
The enemy will find us here sooner or later.

621
00:34:31,449 --> 00:34:32,920
Can we set off early?

622
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:35,679
The police from the Water Inspection Station

623
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:37,270
are patrolling the lake.

624
00:34:39,790 --> 00:34:40,750
Whatever.

625
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:43,330
The lake is foggy at night.

626
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:44,820
They can't see clearly.

627
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:46,130
Let's take two boats,

628
00:34:46,219 --> 00:34:47,420
and I'll lead the way.

629
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:14,240
What's wrong?

630
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:26,510
The short Japs are catching up to us.

631
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:39,590
Sit down.

632
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:44,940
Bingmei, what's going on?

633
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:46,230
They're on our tail.

634
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:48,290
You go first.

635
00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:49,190
I’ll distract them.

636
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:50,210
What about you, Shuisheng?

637
00:35:50,210 --> 00:35:51,080
No time for this.

638
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,310
It'll be too late if we don't leave now!

639
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:53,970
Dalong, go to your mom's boat.

640
00:35:54,890 --> 00:35:56,500
Here, come here.

641
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:58,040
Go.

642
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:07,340
When the war started,

643
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:12,630
-we traveled day and night.
-Here!

644
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:16,380
On that day,

645
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:19,750
we arrived in Changsha County.

646
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:23,990
Guan Yu fought against old Yang Ling first,

647
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:30,390
and then hero Huang Hansheng.

648
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:33,270
When the war started...

649
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:33,990
Who is there?

650
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:35,190
-Stop!
-Guan Yu...

651
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:40,470
Shuisheng!

652
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:41,110
Dad!

653
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:42,670
Don't shout.

654
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:43,150
Dad.

655
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:44,510
Don't shout.

656
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:45,140
Stop!

657
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:12,580
Iwai's squad

658
00:37:12,650 --> 00:37:13,920
didn't get anything.

659
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:15,360
Kondo was so pissed.

660
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:18,840
If the Japanese could understand

661
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:19,950
our Chinese,

662
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,500
why would Chairman Wang

663
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:24,160
establish the collaborationist government?

664
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,270
Zhifei, well,

665
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:27,750
the communists would never expect

666
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:28,880
us to make Gu Yizhong

667
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,270
the scapegoat.

668
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:32,360
At least for now,

669
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,760
he's the primary suspect

670
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,550
for the CPC.

671
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:38,550
Besides,

672
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:41,190
I have Cell 8.

673
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:44,630
When it comes to infiltration,

674
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:46,110
you're at the top.

675
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:48,840
The New Fourth Army nest in Suzhou.

676
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:50,750
Wan Lilang and the others at No. 76 in Shanghai

677
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:52,270
can do nothing about it.

678
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,590
But it's only been six months,

679
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:55,470
and you've planted a mole in it.

680
00:37:55,490 --> 00:37:57,180
We have Cell 8,

681
00:37:57,710 --> 00:37:58,760
while they

682
00:37:58,760 --> 00:37:59,960
planted Duan Wentao.

683
00:38:01,830 --> 00:38:03,230
That's a rhyme.

684
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,480
I have a Cell 8,

685
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:07,460
while they had Duan Wentao.

686
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:10,170
In that case,

687
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:12,790
I guess it's a draw.

688
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:14,950
Zhifei, we won this round.

689
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:17,620
Now Duan Wentao is dead.

690
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:20,640
Our Cell 8 is still alive and can be put to good use.

691
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:22,990
Right,

692
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:24,990
tell Chen Gang from the Telecom Department

693
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:26,590
that he is fired.

694
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:28,000
Zhifei,

695
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:30,200
Chen Gang is an expert in wiretapping.

696
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:30,910
He was properly trained

697
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:32,650
in the NBIS Military Radio Training Class.

698
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:34,870
No matter how skilled he is, we can use him.

699
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:35,850
He gave the information to Huang Xinzhai

700
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:37,690
without telling us.

701
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:39,260
Why should we keep someone like him?

702
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:40,770
I've told Mr. Li about it.

703
00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:42,920
He will send a new guy here tonight.

704
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:43,800
Got it.

705
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:51,470
[New Fourth Army 6th Division Taihu Lake Base]

706
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:54,350
Be careful, Huizhong.

707
00:38:54,350 --> 00:38:55,310
Be careful.

708
00:38:59,010 --> 00:38:59,650
Here.

709
00:38:59,810 --> 00:39:00,520
One, two!

710
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:02,350
One, two!

711
00:39:03,370 --> 00:39:04,340
One, two!

712
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:05,590
One, two!

713
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:06,120
Bingmei,

714
00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:09,290
why isn’t Shuisheng here?

715
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:14,020
Comrade,

716
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:15,870
Shuisheng

717
00:39:16,830 --> 00:39:18,500
sacrificed himself

718
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:21,970
in order to protect us on the lake.

719
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:26,020
We have an emergency report.

720
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:27,960
We need to see your leaders.

721
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:30,460
Do you have a gun with you? Hand over the gun.

722
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:34,320
What?

723
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:35,210
Hand over your gun.

724
00:39:35,210 --> 00:39:35,880
We're on the same side.

725
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:36,730
Why?

726
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,410
Listen, comrade,

727
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:39,980
do you know the discipline?

728
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:41,160
What discipline?

729
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:42,050
Yizhong.

730
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:45,590
Newcomers on the island are not allowed to carry weapons.

731
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,590
You'll get it back when you're cleared.

732
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:49,470
Yizhong, give it to them.

733
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:59,670
One, two, one! One, two, one!

734
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:05,430
These rooms are all empty.

735
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:06,570
One room

736
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:07,890
for each of you four.

737
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:10,790
My husband and I have to stay in separate rooms too?

738
00:40:10,790 --> 00:40:12,050
My sister is pregnant.

739
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:13,360
She needs someone to take care of her.

740
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,120
I told you.

741
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:15,890
One room for each.

742
00:40:16,490 --> 00:40:16,970
Also,

743
00:40:17,330 --> 00:40:19,370
no one is allowed to go out without permission.

744
00:40:19,370 --> 00:40:20,270
This is the discipline!

745
00:40:20,270 --> 00:40:21,150
Why?

746
00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:23,310
We're all on the same side.

747
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,510
Why are you treating us

748
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:25,310
like prisoners?

749
00:40:25,310 --> 00:40:25,860
Yizhong!

750
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:26,890
Yizhong.

751
00:40:27,410 --> 00:40:29,190
There's a traitor inside the organization.

752
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:30,720
All four of us are suspects,

753
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,380
including your sister and me.

754
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:37,470
Comrade, is there a military doctor?

755
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,270
He has a gunshot wound on his arm.

756
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,170
He needs to be treated.

757
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:41,700
I'll arrange it right away.

758
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:53,920
Hello, Director.

759
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:56,670
