00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:27,750
effective immediately,

382
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:30,800
the Agent Headquarters will be dissolved

383
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:34,010
and reorganized as the Political Security Bureau.

384
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:39,710
Suzhou Agent Station

385
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:43,950
will be renamed the Suzhou Branch

386
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:47,210
directly under the Political Security Bureau,

387
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:51,990
with Gu Yizhong as the Chief.

388
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:55,630
And,

389
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,190
Xie Wenchao.

390
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:01,270
Yes.

391
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:05,190
You will be the Deputy Chief of the Suzhou Branch.

392
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,230
Everyone, please welcome.

393
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:19,710
[Nation's Valuable Asset]

394
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:20,570
Does anyone

395
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:23,470
have anything to say?

396
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:26,710
Alright, dismissed.

397
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:27,830
Dismissed.

398
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:34,660
Chief Gu.

399
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:39,490
The Bureau has assigned you a deputy.

400
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:41,550
Wenchao,

401
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:43,350
you already know him.

402
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:46,590
He used to work at Suzhou Station

403
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:49,250
and later transferred to the Headquarters,

404
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:51,270
working in my Intelligence Station.

405
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:52,600
He's an expert

406
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:54,400
at dealing with the CPC,

407
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:57,310
and he's also familiar with the situation in Suzhou.

408
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:58,070
This time,

409
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:00,050
your old acquaintance

410
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:02,050
is here to be your deputy.

411
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:04,210
You two should cooperate well

412
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:05,830
from now on.

413
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,040
Yizhong.

414
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:11,910
We meet again.

415
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:21,780
Why do you seem a bit unhappy, Chief Gu?

416
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:22,950
No,

417
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:25,250
it's just a bit sudden.

418
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:30,090
Chief Gu.

419
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:32,550
The responsibilities handed to you

420
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:34,630
this time are quite heavy.

421
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:37,800
Thank you, Mr. Wan, for your trust.

422
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:39,190
Don't mention it.

423
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:42,770
It was the Japanese who recommended you.

424
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:43,890
I'm just here

425
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:46,150
to announce it.

426
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:48,200
Chief Gu.

427
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:51,080
You've really impressed them,

428
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:55,510
making Kondo so happy.

429
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:58,800
I didn't expect you to be so adept at this game.

430
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:00,550
Chief Wan,

431
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:03,130
Mr. Kondo is not here today.

432
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:04,710
Why don't I host a banquet

433
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:07,760
to welcome you and express our gratitude?

434
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:10,030
There's no need for that.

435
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:11,630
Oh, it's absolutely necessary.

436
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:12,110
Yes.

437
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,440
[Nation's Valuable Asset]

438
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:14,290
You must honor us with your presence.

439
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:16,880
Wenchao, what do you think?

440
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:19,890
There's a new Chaozhou restaurant in Suzhou

441
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:21,780
called Fengxiang Restaurant.

442
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:23,980
I've heard the food there is quite good.

443
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:28,870
Looks like

444
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:33,910
I can't refuse this generous offer.

445
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:37,760
It would be an honor.

446
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:46,350
Here.

447
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:49,340
What took you so long?

448
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:50,390
You wouldn't believe it.

449
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:51,710
The station accountant

450
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:52,970
was dragging his feet.

451
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:57,250
This should be enough.

452
00:28:57,870 --> 00:28:58,870
On our way here,

453
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,710
Wan Lilang's secretary hinted

454
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:03,800
that we should follow the rules, Chief Gu.

455
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:05,830
That Xie really lucked out,

456
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:08,170
getting a Deputy Chief position.

457
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:12,960
Chief Wan, you're leaving so early?

458
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:14,670
I'm getting old

459
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:16,210
and can't stay up late.

460
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:17,810
You young people

461
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:19,430
carry on.

462
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:20,270
Chief Wan.

463
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:21,230
I was hoping

464
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:23,150
you could stay in Suzhou for a few more days

465
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:25,540
so I could properly fulfill my duties as host.

466
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:26,470
I can't.

467
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:28,690
I have to return to Nanjing tomorrow.

468
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:32,350
The Agent Station has been reorganized into the Bureau,

469
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:34,410
and there's a lot of work to hand over.

470
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:36,590
Suzhou is just the first stop;

471
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:38,830
there are other places I need to visit to make the announcement.

472
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:39,300
Yes.

473
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,350
The signs need to be changed.

474
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:41,410
There's no choice;

475
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:43,840
Minister Zhou doesn't like it,

476
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:45,830
so it's now called the Political Security Bureau.

477
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:47,150
That's really hard work for you.

478
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:47,910
Chief Wan.

479
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:49,310
Chief Wan.

480
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:52,030
We have a small token of our appreciation

481
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:53,670
from the Suzhou Branch.

482
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:56,310
-Don't worry.
-Yizhong.

483
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:57,770
It's just a small gesture.

484
00:29:58,310 --> 00:29:59,550
No savings certificates,

485
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:00,960
just a few gold bars—

486
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:02,330
hard currency.

487
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:05,110
We're all good brothers;

488
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,430
no need to be so formal.

489
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:14,740
Keep up the good work.

490
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:16,810
Now is a golden opportunity

491
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:19,290
for everyone to make a fortune together.

492
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:21,010
Take care.

493
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,240
Jiping, see Chief Wan out.

494
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:23,790
Chief Wan.

495
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:24,150
Take care.

496
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:25,180
The car is ready.

497
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,630
Sir.

498
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:03,050
Among the poems about Suzhou,

499
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:06,590
the one I like the most

500
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:09,680
is by poet Yang Wanli of the Song Dynasty.

501
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,880
Do not blame the lone boat for drifting aimlessly;

502
00:31:13,050 --> 00:31:15,600
my very self is but a wandering vessel.

503
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,970
[August 1945, Gu's Garden]

504
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:38,110
Central News Agency reports

505
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:42,070
from Washington on the 13th that

506
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:45,430
the four major allied powers—China, the United States,

507
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:46,670
Britain, and the Soviet Union—

508
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:49,070
have accepted Japan's offer to surrender.

509
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:51,550
However, it is explicitly stated that

510
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:53,700
the Japanese Emperor must follow

511
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:56,320
the orders of the Allied Commander-in-Chief,

512
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:58,310
and Japan's future

513
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:01,470
will be determined by a general election.

514
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:04,870
Secretary of State Byrnes

515
00:32:04,910 --> 00:32:06,440
and President Truman

516
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:08,160
hastily conferred,

517
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:09,940
and within an hour,

518
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:11,530
they relayed their decision to the Japanese government.

519
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:13,870
Uncle, I'm full.

520
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:16,150
Mrs. Wang.

521
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:17,310
Coming.

522
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,820
Take Junsheng out to play.

523
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:19,690
Alright.

524
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:20,750
Put a jacket on him.

525
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:21,510
Okay.

526
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:22,140
Go.

527
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:24,670
Come, let's play.

528
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:29,230
This morning, I heard on the streets that

529
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:31,110
the Japanese were hit by some kind of bomb.

530
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:31,750
Is it true?

531
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:33,470
The US Army did it.

532
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:35,070
The Central News Agency reports that

533
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:36,750
hundreds of thousands were injured or killed.

534
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:38,680
The destructive power is immense.

535
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:40,960
Japan is on the brink of surrender.

536
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:43,570
Then we won't have to fight anymore.

537
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:46,430
But with so many Japanese in Suzhou,

538
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:47,390
will they

539
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:49,230
be willing to surrender?

540
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:50,550
Soon, the streets

541
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:51,870
will be in chaos again.

542
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:56,270
And with our status,

543
00:32:57,070 --> 00:32:58,470
once the Japanese leave,

544
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,990
no matter who takes over,

545
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:02,050
they probably won't treat us kindly.

546
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:16,390
Haimo,

547
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:18,600
we need to leave.

548
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:19,880
Where to?

549
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:22,200
I've already made arrangements.

550
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,590
We'll go to the Sanxiang Temple.

551
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:24,550
We leave today.

552
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:26,400
Today?

553
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:28,840
But today doesn't work.

554
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:30,790
I have an appointment with Dr. Su

555
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:32,620
to check Junsheng's teeth.

556
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:34,620
He's been waking up in pain at night.

557
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:37,990
Alright then,

558
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:39,790
let's see the dentist first.

559
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:41,350
I'll head back to No. 90 in the meantime.

560
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:42,470
We'll depart at noon.

561
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:44,070
Why are you going back there?

562
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:49,110
There are some important documents I need to handle.

563
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:49,830
I'm telling you,

564
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:52,030
a cornered beast is the most dangerous.

565
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,310
You need to be careful.

566
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:00,660
Don't worry.

567
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:01,790
Also,

568
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:04,100
don't tell Mrs. Wang

569
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:05,770
or anyone else about this.

570
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:08,469
I've left some money for her,

571
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:10,590
enough for her to live out her years.

572
00:34:11,389 --> 00:34:12,989
Finish up and start packing.

573
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:17,780
So you've been planning to leave for a while, huh?

574
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:18,940
Such a big move,

575
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:20,909
and I didn't even notice.

576
00:34:21,929 --> 00:34:23,130
You've really become

577
00:34:24,389 --> 00:34:26,400
a full-fledged spy, haven't you?

578
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:35,909
That's ridiculous.

579
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:37,199
What are you doing?

580
00:34:37,429 --> 00:34:38,510
This is outrageous.

581
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:39,389
Exactly.

582
00:34:39,469 --> 00:34:40,150
They're robbing people.

583
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:42,150
Give it back to me!

584
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:44,080
-Don't move.
-Give it back.

585
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:12,120
[Suzhou Branch, Directly under National Government Political Security Bureau]

586
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:38,790
This is asking for trouble!

587
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:41,730
What's going on? Why all the cursing?

588
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:44,970
It's all because of that Xie Wenchao.

589
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:46,470
Yesterday,

590
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:48,330
out of nowhere,

591
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:50,790
he decided to transfer all the captured

592
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:52,030
Communists and New Fourth Army members

593
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:53,790
from Changshu, Kunshan, and Taicang

594
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:55,590
to the Suzhou headquarters.

595
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:57,670
There are 70 to 80 people.

596
00:35:58,230 --> 00:36:00,160
Where are we supposed to keep them?

597
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:02,470
And where's the money for their food coming from?

598
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:04,270
What's Xie Wenchao trying to do?

599
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,110
He went with the Investigation Department

600
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:08,390
and did it personally.

601
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:10,540
He claims it was a direct order

602
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,340
from Wan Lilang in Nanjing

603
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:15,140
to severely punish the Communist New Fourth Army.

604
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,550
Given the current situation,

605
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,040
why is he still causing trouble?

606
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:22,590
Xie has Wan Lilang

607
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:24,300
backing him up.

608
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:26,310
We old-timers have to be cautious around him.

609
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:27,310
I'm ignoring him.

610
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,080
After all,

611
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:31,130
No. 90

612
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:34,520
is still under Japanese control.

613
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:36,870
Where's Mr. Kondo?

614
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:37,870
Why isn't he here?

615
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:38,790
He

616
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:40,690
is crazy.

617
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,510
He's been locked up

618
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:45,630
since the day before yesterday,

619
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,920
shouting in Japanese

620
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:48,950
from time to time.

621
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:50,910
It's terrifying,

622
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:53,960
and no one dares to go in.

623
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,880
They might really be on the brink of defeat.

624
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:07,570
[We don't know whether we're crazy or stupid] [All we can do is to move forward]

625
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:09,020
Mr. Gu,

626
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:16,460
Japan is going to lose the war.

627
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:18,190
That was inevitable.

628
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:21,710
I still remember

629
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,240
when we first met

630
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,000
four years ago,

631
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:30,260
you told me that

632
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:34,890
the Chinese nation wouldn't lose this war,

633
00:38:35,490 --> 00:38:36,820
that the Chinese people

634
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:39,590
would defeat us utterly.

635
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:44,120
On August 6th in Hiroshima

636
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:47,460
[We don't know whether we're crazy or stupid] [All we can do is to move forward]

637
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:46,000
and August 9th in Nagasaki,

638
00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:47,830
both cities were hit

639
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:49,920
by powerful bomb attacks from the U.S. military,

640
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,720
causing countless casualties.

641
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:53,620
On August 9th,

642
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:57,280
the Soviet Red Army launched a massive offensive

643
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,390
against the Japanese Kwantung Army in Northeast China.

644
00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:01,070
Today,

645
00:39:01,830 --> 00:39:03,660
your Emperor also announced

646
00:39:03,830 --> 00:39:06,090
acceptance of the Potsdam Declaration.

647
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:08,130
Your headquarters

648
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:10,390
will soon

649
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:14,950
have no choice but to surrender to China, Britain,

650
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:16,480
the United States, and the Soviet Union.

651
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,140
Our headquarters' strategic miscalculations

652
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:21,990
might be the reason for our failure.

653
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:32,150
Mr. Gu, are you a communist?

654
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:34,030
No.

655
00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:35,110
Then you're with the Kuomintang?

656
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:35,750
No.

657
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:41,880
Then who exactly are you?

658
00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:55,410
I'm just an ordinary Chinese citizen.

659
00:40:03,790 --> 00:40:04,670
Kondo Masao,

660
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,720
I hope you will acknowledge your defeat

661
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:09,900
and surrender—

662
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:13,170
to the New Fourth Army at Taihu Lake.

663
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:23,950
Chiang Kai-shek in Chongqing,

664
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:25,710
under the banner of resistance,

665
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:26,970
is in fact corrupt

666
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:28,400
and infighting,

667
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:31,350
just like the Wang Regime in Nanjing—

668
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:32,880
both are rotten to the core.

669
00:40:33,350 --> 00:40:36,010
I'm sure you wouldn't want to surrender to them.

670
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:40,690
I hope

671
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:41,790
you will surrender to the vibrant and vigorous

672
00:40:41,790 --> 00:40:43,250
Chinese Communist Party.

673
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:46,390
They are the only party

674
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:48,630
capable of leading China into the future.

675
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:49,960
Only they can represent

676
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:51,660
the interests of the vast majority

677
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:53,030
of the Chinese people.

678
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:56,750
Kondo,

679
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:01,160
I hope you will return Suzhou to us,

680
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:03,990
the people of Suzhou.

681
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:14,150
Kondo.

682
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:21,270
Alright.

683
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:25,830
I will persuade General Officer Kobayashi

684
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:28,750
to surrender Suzhou to the New Fourth Army.

685
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:33,370
Please contact them

686
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:36,030
and arrange to accept our surrender.

687
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:36,910
Deal.

688
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:46,670
I'll leave it to you.

689
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:55,180
Junsheng.

690
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:55,910
You're back.

691
00:41:56,910 --> 00:41:58,540
Hurry, pack your things.

692
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:02,350
I've packed everything.

693
00:42:02,350 --> 00:42:04,110
But that radio is too big.

694
00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:05,040
I can't carry it.

695
00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:07,970
Leave that behind.

696
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:10,600
Haimo, stop packing for a moment.

697
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:15,630
Here.

698
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:18,030
What is this?

699
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:19,550
A map to Sanxiang Temple.

700
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:20,990
Look.

701
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:26,580
[Qi Gate] [Sanxiang Temple]

702
00:42:21,550 --> 00:42:22,750
This is Qi Gate.

703
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:25,310
After you pass through Qi Gate

704
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:26,890
and head east for about ten li,

705
00:42:26,890 --> 00:42:29,090
there's a place called Sanxiang Temple

706
00:42:29,230 --> 00:42:30,110
In the temple,

707
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:31,260
there's an old monk,

708
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:32,800
who is my father's cousin.

709
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:34,390
When you get there,

710
00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:36,110
he will arrange a place for you to stay.

711
00:42:36,110 --> 00:42:36,590
Oh,

712
00:42:36,870 --> 00:42:38,770
and before you go, stop by Dingjue Temple

713
00:42:38,770 --> 00:42:39,770
to pick up the car.

714
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:41,280
You're not coming with us?

715
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:44,620
There are some urgent matters I need to handle.

716
00:42:46,110 --> 00:42:46,640
Alright.

717
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:01,270
Haimo.

718
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:05,760
If you don't leave,

719
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:07,600
we won't leave either.

720
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:10,350
Junsheng.

721
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:11,790
Go find Mrs. Wang.

722
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:15,950
Haimo, stop packing.

723
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:17,830
Don't think you can get rid of me.
