00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:40,420
Sorry.

5
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:42,330
Sorry for disturbing you so late.

6
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,229
Is this your first time here?

7
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:45,070
Yes.

8
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,240
I have some personal matters

9
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:50,870
I'd like to discuss with you.

10
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:52,630
Here's the thing.

11
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,539

12
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,210
Here, let me show you something first.

13
00:01:59,070 --> 00:01:59,700
This.

14
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:00,710
Just a moment.

15
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:02,590
I know

16
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:04,850
you like studying Chinese calligraphy.

17
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:07,120
This is quite valuable, right?

00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:15,930
is the only authentic work

23

"The towering and majestic mountains and the long-flowing rivers,
along with the myriad forms and shapes of nature,

29
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:37,630

at Yangtai Temple.

32
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,470
This was originally in the palace,

33
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:45,750
owned by royal courts.

34
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:47,810
But somehow, at the end of the Qing dynasty,

35
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:49,600
it found its way out,

36
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:52,150
and eventually, I acquired it.

37
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:55,740
I brought it today,

38
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:57,690
so you can enjoy it for a few days.

39
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:10,640
What is your intention?

40
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,260
Are you trying to bribe me?

41
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:13,230
No, no, no.

42
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,940
Just an exchange of thoughts.

43
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:20,000
What do you want?

44
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:22,070
Just say it directly.

45
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:26,520
I just want to talk to you

46
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:29,010
about my son's situation.

47
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,010
About your son?

48
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,200
He wrote a letter to me,

49
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:36,590
saying that his studies in Japan

50
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,800
are quite fulfilling.

51
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:40,590
The school

52
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:42,190
has taught them many things,

53
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:44,150
and he is deeply grateful

54
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:46,390
to the Empire of Japan.

55
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:49,040
But

56
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:52,850
since my son is Chinese,

57
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:54,829
when he went to study in Japan,

58
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:57,230
he couldn't quite adapt to the environment.

59
00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:00,600
Additionally, his personality isn't very sociable,

60
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:03,030
so he often gets beaten up

61
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:06,080
by a group of Japanese kids.

62
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:08,270
I actually think it's not a bad thing

63
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:10,110
—it's a form of training.

64
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:11,680
But

65
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:14,020
when he wrote to his mother about this,

66
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,899
she ended up crying

67
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:18,320
and hopes I could come

68
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,190
and ask you

69
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:23,250
if you could make a call to their school superintendent

70
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:26,070
and ask them to stop bullying my son.

71
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:31,140
The education in Japan has always been strict.

72
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:34,310
It's common for students to fight.

73
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:37,040
Your son will get used to it.

74
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,780
But there's another matter I want to discuss with you.

75
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:46,140
Regarding the Ding Jiansheng case,

76
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:49,510
you need to work with Gu Yizhong to resolve it quickly.

77
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:50,270
This case has caused a lot of trouble

78
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:51,550
for the military.

79
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:53,150
Rest assured.

80
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:56,270
I'll do my best with the Ding Jiansheng case.

81
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:57,770
But could you also...

82
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:01,190
Help with my son's issue?

83
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:04,790
Anyway, I won't bother you any longer.

84
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:05,990
Please get some rest.

85
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:10,960
Mr. Zhou.

86
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,620
Take this calligraphy work back.

87
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:16,330
I've already appreciated it.

88
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:18,210
No, no, no, please keep it.

89
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:18,830
It's a gift...

90
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:20,490
I'm leaving it for you to enjoy.

91
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:21,810
Just leave it here.

92
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:24,790
This is the first time I've seen such calligraphy.

93
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:28,770
You should still take it back.

94
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,620
It's truly a fine piece.

95
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,920
How about this? Leave it here for a few days.

96
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:50,080
Please take it back.

97
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,470
I really want you to have it.

98
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:56,430
I insist, please take it back.

99
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,820
This is the note Lu Zheng gave me today.

100
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:04,800
[Whoever targeted Ding Jiansheng is the Cell 8]

101
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:08,640
Could it be Gu Yizhong?

102
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:09,870
I can't say for sure.

103
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:12,150
But the painting

104
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,130
we got at the Rong Society last time

105
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,160
did resemble his style.

106
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:21,350
If Gu Yizhong is really Cell 8

107
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:24,560
and he wanted to take us out,

108
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,140
we would've never managed to bring

109
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:29,170
Ding Jiansheng back from Shanghai to Suzhou.

110
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:31,770
Plus, there'd be no need for him to pass us notes

111
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:33,560
or draw pictures for us.

112
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:36,750
It doesn't make sense for him to be both Cell 8

113
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,430
and the person feeding us information.

114
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:42,630
Actually, after the Cui Yaomin incident,

115
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:45,159
I pretty much ruled out

116
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:47,050
Gu Yizhong as a suspect for Cell 8.

117
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:52,310
We wronged him.

118
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:56,450
I've been waiting for you to say that.

119
00:06:59,030 --> 00:06:59,990
I hope

120
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:04,160
you can tell him that yourself.

121
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:07,390
If I get the chance,

122
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:10,870
I will.

123
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,710
Gu Yizhong isn't Cell 8.

124
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:21,670
Neither am I, and neither are you.

125
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,340
That leaves just two suspects:

126
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:27,770
Hu Zhiping and Huizhong.

127
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,800
Hu Zhiping has been involved in

128
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,480
all our activities in Suzhou.

129
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:36,680
He knows about this liaison point too.

130
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,000
If he were Cell 8,

131
00:07:40,659 --> 00:07:41,710
why hasn't he

132
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:43,340
exposed this liaison point?

133
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:46,630
And why is he still helping us buy supplies?

134
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:47,830
It doesn't add up.

135
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:52,170
So,

136
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:55,030
that leaves us with one suspect

137
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,080
—Gu Huizhong.

138
00:07:58,510 --> 00:07:59,590
Huizhong?

139
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,850
There's no way she's a traitor.

140
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:07,000
There's something I haven't told you.

141
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:09,260
Gu Huizhong knows

142
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:11,130
Zhou Zhifei's wife, Ji Yuqing.

143
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:14,050
They were classmates at Leyi Girls' School.

144
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:19,990
Now, I'm leaning towards thinking it might be Gu Huizhong.

145
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:21,110
Or maybe

146
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:23,970
both she and her husband have turned against us.

147
00:08:33,309 --> 00:08:34,830
I've got a plan.

148
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:39,429
We can use Ding Jiansheng

149
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:43,070
to lure Cell 8 Cell out into the open.

150
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:50,620
He didn't accept it?

151
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:51,860
No.

152
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:54,520
He doesn't want to do me the favor.

153
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,440
I didn't expect it,

154
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:01,430
but it turns out this Japanese is pretty upright.

155
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:02,390
Kondo

156
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:03,850
is like a monk.

157
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:06,750
He barely leaves No. 90,

158
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:08,390
and his only hobby

159
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:09,910
seems to be figuring out

160
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:11,770
how to deal with us Suzhou people.

161
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:14,000
He didn't accept it.

162
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:15,790
That's good.

163
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,310
When Mr. Chiang, the collector,

164
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:21,330
offered to trade this for a person,

165
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,320
he said this antique calligraphy piece

166
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,800
was worth fifty gold bars.

167
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,160
I'll send it back to the bank's safety tomorrow.

168
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:28,990
No need.

169
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,410
Just keep it at home.

170
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:32,070
I heard that Major General Di

171
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:33,600
is into calligraphy too.

172
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:35,370
It might come in handy

173
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:37,380
with him.

174
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,930
That military rice case of mine...

175
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:44,050
It's only a matter of time before they investigate.

176
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:48,040
Take it.

177
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,730
But don't touch my gold bars.

178
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:51,990
Also,

179
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:54,190
tell your brother to lay low for a while.

180
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,640
I already warned Ji Yuping

181
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:00,230
—keep him hidden in the French Concession.

182
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:02,720
No dance halls, no cinemas, no cafés.

183
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,050
Not for now.

184
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:12,110
What are you two talking about here?

185
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:14,010
How come you came out of that room?

186
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:15,910
I was feeling cooped up.

187
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,150
I went in there to find a book to read.

188
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,130
Don't go in there again.

189
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:23,860
That room's full of hidden guns.

190
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:25,660
Even I don't like going in there.

191
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:26,300
Okay.

192
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:29,890
Well,

193
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:32,350
the three of us can't even play mahjong,

194
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:34,350
as it requires four players.

195
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:36,940
It's boring.

196
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:39,980
What book did you find?

197
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:13,950
I'll go watch a movie with you some other day.

198
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,180
It'll be fine, Mom.

199
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:23,950
The water's nice and warm.

200
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:26,510
I'm fine.

201
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:28,190

Look.

209

A baby bottle?

210
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,910
You've been wanting one, right?

211
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:07,240
Got it from the Daimaru Department Store.

212
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:09,980
Suzhou Department Store was perfectly fine,

213
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,260
but as soon as the Japanese came,

214
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,780
it turned into Daimaru.

215
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:18,880
Oh, and some good news

216
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:22,720
—our supplies have made it to the base.

They'll be able to use them soon.

00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:40,670
What happened?

223
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:48,870
Zhiping,

224
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,530
do you trust me?

225
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:58,730
Why are you suddenly asking about trust?

226
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:12,110
Huizhong, I love you

227
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:14,950
more than everything.

228
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:17,130
I can't even imagine

229
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:19,130
how I would've gotten through

230
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:20,720

without you by my side.

232
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:29,510
But what I'm asking is—do you trust me?

233
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:30,510
Of course.

234
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:38,630
I need to confess.

235
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,220
To you and to The Party.

236
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:49,640
What do you need to confess?

237
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:58,710
Do you remember, back at the base,

238
00:14:58,750 --> 00:14:59,790
you asked me

239
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:02,110
where I disappeared to

00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:03,710

before the Garden of Pleasance operation?

242
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,230
Where did you go?

243
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:11,270
I went to Zhou Zhifei's house

244
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:13,150
—the Director of No. 90.

245
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:16,830
At that time, Junsheng was due

246
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:18,480
in just a couple of weeks,

247
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:21,230
so I wanted to buy some fabric

248
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:23,440

259
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:48,370

maybe through her connections,

about this important situation now?

321
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:22,960
I meant to tell you,

but our safe house got compromised,

323
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,130
and we had to relocate.

324

After retreating to the base,

325
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:28,570
we got caught up in investigating Cell 8,

326
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:32,770
and I was afraid it would cause misunderstandings
that I couldn't clear up.

327
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,220
With Gu Yizhong's current identity,

328
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:57,230
and you being his sister,

329
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:01,290
and you being classmates with Zhou's wife,

330
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,650
and the fact that you went to their house

331
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:06,350
just before the Garden of Pleasance operation failed

332
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:08,280
—it's hard not to raise suspicions

00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:13,310
I swear,

335
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:15,570
I've never done anything

336
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:17,270

00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:20,430
I believe you 100%.

338
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,280
But your problem is

339
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,160
that you didn't report your encounter

340
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:28,250
with Zhou Zhifei to the Party in time.

341
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:36,790

00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:49,390
Once the Party knows about this,

347
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:54,190
it could lead to unnecessary misunderstandings.

00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:05,990
I'm scared I made a huge mistake

352
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:09,110
that might drag you down with me.

00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:14,350
The Jiangsu Provincial Committee leaders

on their way to the Huainan base,

356
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:20,230
and I'm responsible for coordinating it.

00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:22,510
Once we've safely escorted them out,

358
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:25,290
we'll head back to the base

359
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:28,190
and explain everything

360
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:29,450
to the Party.

361
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:32,910
How long will that take?

362
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:35,100
I'm really anxious.

363
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:43,630
Don't be.

364
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:48,630
Right now,

365
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:50,290
there's nothing more important

366
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:52,420
than ensuring the safety

367

00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:24,810
You must know where she lives.

376
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,820
Don't you dare think of using your sister to climb the ranks.

377
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:27,300
I...

378
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:30,900
Mr. Gu, don't come here

379
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:32,180
anymore.

380
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:33,000
Mrs. Wang,

381
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:34,850
I know you care about her,

382
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:36,070
but I really need to talk to her

383
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:37,430
about something very important.

384
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:38,960
If she doesn't know in time,

385
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:39,870
it could be dangerous.

386
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:40,880
Please, just tell me.

387
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,140
Don't try that with me.

388
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:43,650
You should just leave.

389
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:52,560
During the Spring and Autumn period,

390
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:54,850
King Fuchai of Wu was deceived by slander

391
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:57,550
and forced his loyal minister Wu Zixu to commit suicide.

392
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:58,680
Before he died,

393
00:21:58,710 --> 00:21:59,970
Wu Zixu told his family

394
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,560
to dig out his eyes

395
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:03,970
and hang them on the east gate of Wu County,

396
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:06,220
so he could witness the fall of the Wu State with his own eyes.

397
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:07,280
Seven years later,

398
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,450
Wu was indeed destroyed by Yue.

399
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,720
You've heard this story

400
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,840
from my father, haven't you?

401
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:18,510
Do you know

402
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:20,570
why my father hasn't been buried yet?

403
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:22,070
As long as the Japanese

404
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:23,710
are still in Suzhou,

405
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,960
my father will never be laid to rest.

406
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:31,240
Your father is like Wu Zixu.

407
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:34,430
So, Mrs. Wang,

408
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:37,350
don't you want to see

409
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:39,090
my father buried peacefully?

410
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:43,950
Young Master,

411
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:46,230
Young Master, Young Lady didn't let me

412
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:48,430
take her all the way to the door that day,

413
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:49,910
but I know

414
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:51,510
she lives

415
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:53,820
around Jiuru Alley.

416
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,120
Thank you, Mrs. Wang.

417
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:35,790
It's an emergency.

418
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:37,280
Don't say anything first.

419
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:39,760
Is Ding Jiansheng with you?

420
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:58,820
I can take care of him,

421
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:02,730
but you'll have to trade my kompromat for it.

422
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:05,350
How dare you bargain with me?

423
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:09,590
What do you want your kompromat for?

424
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:10,650
You want to get rid of me?

425
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:13,170
Yes, I want out.

426
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:27,680
She's getting suspicious.

427
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:30,790
If she reports her visit

428
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:32,020
to your house,

429
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:34,670
the Party will immediately suspect me.

430
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,080
She is your wife.

431
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:40,410
You should be able to persuade her.

432
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:41,610
I can't persuade her.

433
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:44,500
Sooner or later, she'll figure it out.

434
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,710
She's not like me.

435
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:51,740
Now Eagle and Xiao Ruotong

436
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:53,680
have started to suspect me too.

437
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,450
And with the medicine deal,

438
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,860
Gu Yizhong is definitely helping

439
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,020
Xiao Ruotong in secret.

440
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,020
Here's what you do

441
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:03,780
—tell me the New Fourth Army's

442
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:05,680
contact point in Suzhou,

443
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:07,300
and I'll

444
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:08,530
take care of the rest.

445
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:11,370
That will get a lot of people killed.

446
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:12,520
I only

447
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:15,580
promised you

448
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:18,150
the address of the Taihu Lake base.

449
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:19,670
I won't

450
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:21,730
give you any more information.

451
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:24,360
You're still too scared.

452
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:29,410
What are you afraid of?

453
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,490
They're only suspicious.

454
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:32,660
They can't prove anything.

455
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:33,890
Now everyone thinks

456
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:35,590
Gu Yizhong is Cell 8.

457
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:37,290
With him taking the fall for you,

458
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:38,490
what's there to fear?

459
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:41,340
Now tell me,

460
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:43,100
where is Ding Jiansheng?

461
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:48,800
I don't want to do this anymore.

462
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:56,420
Hu,

463
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:00,190
I totally understand you.

464
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:03,310
You're thinking you can

465
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:04,560
get your kompromat,

466
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:07,550
go back to the Communist Party,

467
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:09,630
and pretend nothing ever happened,

468
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:11,650
right?

469
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:12,920
Start fresh?

470
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:16,290
That's where I came from.

471
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:18,270
Let me put it this way.

472
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:21,250
From the moment you started working with me,

473
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:24,230
from the moment your wife first suspected you,

474
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:26,510
there's no going back.

475
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,940
You have to work with me.

476
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,880
I'm the only one who can help you.

477
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:34,860
Do you hear me?

478
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:36,440
If you want Ding Jiansheng,

479
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:38,720
trade my kompromat for him.

480
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:40,120
That's the deal.

481
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:42,550
Don't expect anything else.

482
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:45,790
Let me think about it.

483
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:48,190
And from now on,

484
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:51,750
if you don't have a gun in your pocket,

485
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:53,290
don't try to scare people.

486
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:20,110
Ji Yuqing went to the theater.

487
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:21,370
You didn't go with her?

488
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:26,850
Could I go out just like that?

489
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:34,600
Something's up.

490
00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:41,850
Tell me.

491
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:43,900
Being in this line of work,

492
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:47,880
we have too many secrets that we have to take to the grave.

493
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:49,610
Always keeping it bottled up.

494
00:28:58,750 --> 00:28:59,310
Tell me.

495
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:20,590
The Japanese want me to hand over Ding Jiansheng.

496
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:24,270
If I do,

497
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:26,290
it's a death sentence.

498
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:28,310
If I don't,

499
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:31,850
I'll probably lose my position as the Director.

500
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:35,030
Kondo didn't leave you

501
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:36,090
any way out, did he?

502
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:37,990
It's Gu Yizhong.

503
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:41,790
He's just a blank slate,

504
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,500
only recently became a special agent.

505
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,750
How could he outsmart you,

506
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:46,830
a veteran agent of over ten years?

507
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:50,110
Unless... there's someone

508
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:51,970
from the Communist side guiding him.

509
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:53,140
Who knows?

510
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:56,110
Someone like Gu Yizhong

511
00:29:56,810 --> 00:29:59,530
—educated, spent time abroad

512
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:03,190
—can be pretty scary

513
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:05,750
when he plays dirty.

514
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:11,260
Don't forget

515
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:13,490
how Gu Shunzhang used to teach

516
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:14,930
at the training school on Changle Road in Nanjing

517
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:16,720
when he was with CBIS.

518
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,140
The safest person

519
00:30:19,170 --> 00:30:20,240
is a dead one.

520
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:30,730
♫The willows sway, the flowers bloom, the orioles sing sweetly♫

521
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:33,100
I can't do it.

522
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:35,240
♫Spring once again whispers its arrival to the world♫

523
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:34,910
They're all watching me.

524
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:39,790
♫With mountain brows and watery eyes, a gentle smile appears♫

525
00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:37,750
Then you might as well wait for Gu Yizhong

526
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:39,010
to catch you off guard.

527
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:44,330
♫I once again fall into the embrace of love♫

528
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:49,710
♫Like a pair of phoenixes soaring in the clouds♫

529
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:51,550
Zhifei, why do you always forget about me?

530
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:55,000
♫So carefree and at ease♫

531
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:58,110
♫Like a pair of phoenixes soaring in the clouds♫

532
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:02,940
Don't keep bringing up the past.

533
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:04,680
You misunderstood.

534
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,060
If you can't handle it,

535
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:10,020
I can do it for you.

536
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:13,370
Have you forgotten my identity?

537
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,030
Sometimes I wonder,

538
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:30,710
if we weren't agents,

539
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:32,540
if we were just ordinary people,

540
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:35,070
life would be pretty nice.

541
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:38,770
Don't say foolish things.

542
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:42,550
Let my people take care of Ding Jiansheng.

543
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,690
I'll think about it some more.

544
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:56,680
Zhifei,

545
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,850
you're right.

546
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:02,810
If only we were ordinary people.

547
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:29,710
Zhou.

548
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:37,480
You're back.

549
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:41,300
Yuanhe,

550
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:43,220
are you feeling better?

551
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:46,100
My stomach still feels a bit uncomfortable.

552
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:47,200
I just came down

553
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:48,830
and saw Director Zhou,

554
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:50,950
so I had a chat with him.

555
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:53,530
He kept talking about Youfei.

556
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:57,000
Director Zhou is really a good father,

557
00:32:57,030 --> 00:32:57,920
a good husband.

558
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:03,720
That's rare.

559
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:05,070
Yuanhe, did you know?

560
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,830
Zhou

561
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,420
never talks about our son

562
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:09,510
in front of others.

563
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,360
Really?

564
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:12,750
No.

565
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,850
In No. 90,

566
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,890
I talk about our son to others.

567
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,160
Mr. Li's mistress?

568
00:33:49,910 --> 00:33:51,020
I'm the fool here.

569
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:52,140
Zhou Zhifei.

570
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,370
Tell me the truth.

571
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,480
What's your relationship with her?

572
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:58,770
If you don't,

573
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:00,780
I'm calling Mr. Li right now.

574
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:05,110
I'll make a long-distance call.

575
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:06,000
If you make that call,

576
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,070
we're as good as dead.

577
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:09,150
Don't push me too far.

578
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:11,310
How can I tell you who she is?

579
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:13,060
If Kondo finds out

580
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:15,270
Mr. Li arranged for her to stay at our house,

581
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:17,170
Mr. Li will be dead too.

582
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:19,100
Then our whole family will be buried alive.

583
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,159
Do you understand?

584
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:23,790
She's from Chongqing?

585
00:34:26,739 --> 00:34:28,860
Then why is she pestering you?

586
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,020
Do they want you to go back?

587
00:34:31,090 --> 00:34:32,130
Can I even go back?

588
00:34:33,489 --> 00:34:34,590
If I return to Chongqing,

589
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:36,650
do you think Mr. Li would let me leave?

590
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:38,530
And if I don't go back,

591
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:40,580
will Xu Enzeng spare me?

592
00:34:41,969 --> 00:34:44,810
Why are you all pushing me to the edge?

593
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:46,900
I'm losing my mind!

594
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:58,150
Zhou,

595
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:00,020
don't be like this.

596
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:02,940
I don't care if she's from Chongqing

597
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:04,300
or with Mr. Li

598
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,840
—I just want to ask you one thing.

599
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,670
Did you sleep with her or not?

600
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:10,570
Sleep with her? Do you think I dare?

601
00:35:10,570 --> 00:35:12,220
With a woman from CBIS?

602
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:13,600
With Mr. Li's woman?

603
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:17,180
Ji, please use your brain.

604
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:19,650
Stop being paranoid.

605
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:22,510
My job is already hard enough.

606
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:23,850
I need your support.

607
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:27,140
From the moment I chose to be with you,

608
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:30,240
I've never considered being with anyone else.

609
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:35,800
Zhou,

610
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:39,230
you better not be lying to me.

611
00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:41,150
Don't make trouble.

612
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:51,830
Ms. Haimo. Ms. Haimo.

613
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:53,370
Be careful.

614
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:55,460
Let go! Let go!

615
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:57,660
How can you do this?

616
00:35:58,470 --> 00:35:59,350
Mr. Du.

617
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:00,550
I can't perform now

618
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:01,460
I can't just stay here

619
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:02,320
doing nothing.

620
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:03,710
What are you saying?

621
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:05,350
You don't need to worry about that.

622
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:06,260
By the way,

623
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:08,730
your guild application has been approved.

624
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:11,060
You can start performing again tomorrow.

625
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:12,550
But didn't the Guangyu Performers' Guild

626
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:13,910
ban female performers?

627
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:14,790
Yes.

628
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:16,110
And that's what surprised me.

629
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:16,710
This time,

630
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:18,990
they approved it without hesitation.

631
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:20,400
I think

632
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:21,750
someone

633
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:23,380
must have spoken up for you.

634
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:30,340
It seems

635
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:33,580
this friend of yours has some real influence.

636
00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:35,990
Guangyu Performers' Guild's patron

637
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:37,030
is Wang Zemin.

638
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:39,180
He's always been cold towards me,

639
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:40,010
but today,

640
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:42,780
he was unusually warm and friendly.

641
00:36:57,140 --> 00:37:00,370
♫It is Wu Yuan♫

642
00:37:04,130 --> 00:37:12,010
♫Journeying through hardships under the stars and moon♫

643
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:24,760
♫The foolish king, cruel and unjust♫

644
00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:32,600
♫Killed my father and brothers, wiped out my entire family♫

645
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:40,440
♫I bear the weight of national and familial vengeance♫

646
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,730
Bravo!

647
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:43,500
Bravo!

648
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:45,320
Bravo! Bravo!

649
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:57,560
Ms. Haimo,

650
00:37:57,850 --> 00:37:59,980
can you get in touch with Xiao Ruotong?

651
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:02,230
I have something urgent to tell her.

652
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,570
After our last meeting at the hospital,

653
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:04,900
I haven't seen her.

654
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:07,280
Maybe you could ask the hospital staff.

655
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:11,790
They're usually elusive.

656
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:14,340
Also,

657
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:17,880
thank you for lighting incense for my father every day.

658
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:21,510
Uncle Gu was so kind to me.

659
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:23,870
This is the least

660
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:24,980
I can do.

661
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:29,990
The situation in Suzhou is deteriorating.

662
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:31,220
I suggest you

663
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:33,300
return home as soon as possible.

664
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:34,890
I was planning to leave

665
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:37,790
after Uncle Gu's

666
00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:39,490
49th-day memorial.

667
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:42,230
Then I'll head to Chongqing.

668
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:44,740
I'm sorry

669
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:46,880
for causing a misunderstanding

670
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:49,400
between you and Miss Xiao last time.

671
00:38:50,270 --> 00:38:51,720
If you're in a hurry

672
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:55,460
to find her,

673
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:57,370
I can go out and see

674
00:38:58,110 --> 00:39:00,310
if I can bump into her.

675
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,910
I have plenty of free time

676
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:03,200
during the day,

677
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:05,030
except for an afternoon ballad.

678
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,400
No, it's okay.

679
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:08,410
I'll figure it out myself.

680
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:09,530
Thanks.

681
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:30,190
It's me.

682
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:38,430
Didn't I tell you?

683
00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:39,770
We can't meet

684
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:40,590
unless it's an emergency.

685
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:41,920
I have an urgent matter.

686
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:42,920
You're exposed?

687
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:44,800
I need baby formula.

688
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:46,230
What?

689
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,970
My baby has no formula to drink.

690
00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:49,160
I desperately

691
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,280
need two cans.

692
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:54,090
You're a seasoned agent,

693
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:56,240
and you risked meeting me

694
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,430
just for some formula?

695
00:39:57,430 --> 00:39:58,290
Let me tell you,

696
00:39:58,590 --> 00:40:00,230
I'm not buying you formula.

697
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:04,770
Tomorrow, same time, same place.

698
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:06,410
If I don't get the formula,

699
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:07,440
I'm out.

700
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,070
I won't provide

701
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:09,950
any more intel.

702
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:10,880
Don't you dare!

703
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:24,630
Boy or girl?

704
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:27,230
Boy.

705
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:28,750
I guessed right.

706
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:32,430
When your wife came to my place that time,

707
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,530
I saw her belly and said

708
00:40:33,530 --> 00:40:34,910
it was definitely a boy.

709
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,810
Two months now, right?

710
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:38,790
Five days short.

711
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:40,600
Is he chubby?

712
00:40:41,370 --> 00:40:42,170
Looks like me.

713
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:49,020
Almost forgot.

714
00:40:49,610 --> 00:40:51,600
You guys have limited funds.

715
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:53,370
Here,

716
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:57,780
take this and buy some supplements.

717
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:01,160
I don't need your money.

718
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:06,720
After the formula runs out, let me know.

719
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:14,630
Do you know

720
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:17,200
why I'm willing to buy you two cans of formula?

721
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,670
Because I'm a father too.

722
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:57,840
[Wang's Oil Shop]

723
00:42:26,870 --> 00:42:28,270
Can I leave now?

724
00:42:31,270 --> 00:42:32,550
I'm sorry, Mr. Ding.

725
00:42:33,070 --> 00:42:34,470
You can't leave just yet.

726
00:42:35,110 --> 00:42:36,070
Why?

727
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:39,450
You've bought the meds and the syringes.

728
00:42:39,450 --> 00:42:40,650
What more do you want?

729
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:42,510
Right now, people from No. 90

730
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:44,270
are looking for you everywhere.

731
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:45,630
Without our help,

732
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:47,030
if you go out on your own,

733
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:49,690
you might not make it out of Suzhou alive.

734
00:42:57,510 --> 00:42:59,390
I'm taking him with me.
