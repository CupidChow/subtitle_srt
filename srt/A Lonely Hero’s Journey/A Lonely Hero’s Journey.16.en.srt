191
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:27,650
Then, how are we going to contact each other?

192
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:31,210
I'll ask Liaison He to inform you.

193
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:47,230
His words just now were flawless.

194
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:48,960
But I still think

195
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:51,590
that he is most likely Cell 8.

196
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:52,750
Our top priority

197
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:54,350
is to stop the leaders of the Provincial Committee

198
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:55,610
from contacting them.

199
00:16:58,590 --> 00:16:59,910
But how can we get in touch

200
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:02,510
with the leaders of the Provincial Committee?

201
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,390
Huizhong has the radio

202
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:06,450
to communicate with the higher-ups.

203
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:07,920
I'll send someone

204
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,950
to Taihu Lake Base

205
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:10,240
and report what happened here

206
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,440
to the leaders there.

207
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:14,490
Ruotong,

208
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,670
since the liaison point of the Rickshaw Shop has been abolished,

209
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:18,730
we need to find another place to stay.

210
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:20,810
Do you have another place to stay

211
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:22,280
in Suzhou?

212
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,710
I'm familiar with Suzhou.

213
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:24,440
Don't worry.

214
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:27,230
Don't stay too far from the Rickshaw Shop.

215
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,740
If you need to contact the Party urgently,

216
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,070
leave a note in your room

217
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:31,740
at the Rickshaw Shop.

218
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,670
I'll come back to check regularly.

219
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:34,490
Remember.

220
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:35,760
When I'm not around,

221
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,280
all operations must be terminated.

222
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:50,180
[Cholera is rampant] [Close Down]

223
00:17:53,550 --> 00:18:01,760
[Cholera is rampant] [Close Down]

224
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,450
After I found out who the target was,

225
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:08,980
I immediately informed Vice Director Huang.

226
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:12,110
I didn't expect still, someone to beat me to it.

227
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:13,430
Who is it?

228
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:16,710
Zhou!

229
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:19,510
Who do you think did it?

230
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,910
You're in charge of the Ding Jiansheng case.

231
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:24,990
You tell us.

232
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:29,110
I do have something

233
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:30,830
to ask you, Director Zhou.

234
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:39,100
Who, besides children,

235
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:40,110
would want to

236
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:41,790
stomp on a record like this?

237
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:43,490
Well, I'm curious

238
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:44,540
about the contents of

239
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,870
this record.

240
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:48,480
Record.

241
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,030
It's either some famous parts of Peking Opera

242
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:53,520
or Golden Voice, Zhou Xuan's songs.

243
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:54,730
What else can it be?

244
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,580
I heard from the clerk in the data room

245
00:18:57,810 --> 00:18:59,420
that some documents from No. 90

246
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:00,820
were also on record.

247
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:04,300
Gu Yizhong, if you want to say

248
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:06,180
that this record is from No. 90,

249
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:07,000
just say it.

250
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,010
Report!

251
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:09,790
Come in.

252
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:15,350
Sir,

253
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:16,990
the firearms officers said

254
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,470
that the bullet that penetrated Ding Jiansheng's head

255
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:19,990
was a 7.62

256
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:21,790
by 54-millimeter rifle bullet.

257
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,550
This was dug out

258
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:27,010
of Ding Jiansheng's head.

259
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:28,470
The killer should be

260
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:30,090
a very professional sniper.

261
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:33,790
Mosin-Nagant, a Soviet sniper rifle.

262
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,230
Only the communists in Yan'an

263
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:36,310
have Soviet stuff.

264
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:39,230
So, the Communist Party killed him?

265
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:44,830
This type of sniper rifle is very expensive.

266
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:46,070
The Communist Party is too poor.

267
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:47,440
Even if they can get the guns,

268
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,170
they can't afford the bullets.

269
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:52,840
I think it was the Kuomintang in Chongqing who did it.

270
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:55,910
Zhou, what do you think?

271
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:03,350
How about you do it?

272
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:04,790
Director Zhou, when it comes to this matter,

273
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:05,850
you are my teacher.

274
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:06,920
Please.

275
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,040
After the Japanese-Soviet Battle of Nomenkan,

276
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,640
Dai Li of the NBIS

277
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:15,030
bought a batch of these sniper rifles

278
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:16,340
from the Soviet Union.

279
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,950
The rifles were used to train assassins

280
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:21,620
at the special training class of NBIS in Linli, Hunan.

281
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,470
This bullet head was notched

282
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:24,790
and soaked in poison.

283
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,950
Shoot Ding to death with a single bullet,

284
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:30,150
very much like NBIS's style.

285
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:33,350
Sir,

286
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,990
the CBIS is also a major suspect.

287
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:40,270
I received a tip-off

288
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:42,830
that Hawkeye had infiltrated Suzhou.

289
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,980
Director Zhou, you didn't hear about it?

290
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:47,430
No.

291
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:54,990
Who is Hawkeye?

292
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:57,030
Director Zhou used to work for CBIS.

293
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,380
He should be very familiar with that man.

294
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:05,110
Hawkeye, his real name should be Feng Zhiguo,

295
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,070
from the Northeastern Army.

296
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:08,750
The top assassin in the CBIS.

297
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:10,830
There is something about him.

298
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:13,430
Within a thousand meters, he shoots with great accuracy

299
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:15,420
and kills the enemy with only one bullet.

300
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:18,030
A while ago, in the case of

301
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:21,220
the magistrate of Wu County, Guo Jingji, being murdered,

302
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:24,080
Guo Jingji was also killed by a shot from a distance.

303
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,870
The style of the two cases is very similar.

304
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:27,580
So it's very likely that Ding Jiansheng was killed

305
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:29,580
by the people who killed Guo Jingji.

306
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:30,670
This is total BS.

307
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:33,240
Ding Jiansheng was a businessman.

308
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:36,150
There is no need for the CBIS to make such a fuss.

309
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:38,520
Director Zhou, so, you really don't know?

310
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:44,980
Sir, Ding Jiansheng was involved

311
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:45,950
in the Changzhou military rice smuggling case

312
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:48,270
that Gu Yizhong is investigating.

313
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,810
If CBIS wants to silence him,

314
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:53,250
there is a chance that they'll collaborate

315
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:54,450
with their mole here.

316
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:56,710
Sir, you know

317
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:59,320
that half of our people at Suzhou Agent Station

318
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,990
used to work for the CBIS.

319
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:02,570
Yes.

320
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:04,130
I left CBIS

321
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:05,810
and turned towards the light.

322
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,080
Are you suspecting me?

323
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:08,110
No.

324
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,810
Director Zhou, I didn't mean that.

325
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:10,810
Don't be nervous.

326
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:12,020
I'm not nervous.

327
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:13,430
I'm angry!

328
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:15,150
Sir,

329
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:18,320
it's been three years since I joined the peace movement.

330
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,760
For the past three years,

331
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:22,110
I've been giving my best effort every day.

332
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:25,780
You're in the least place to suspect me, understand?

333
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,800
Sir, I have another tip-off.

334
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,540
It's also related to Hawkeye.

335
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:33,210
Director Zhou,

336
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,200
I heard that the code name of the new Director of

337
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:39,200
the Jiangsu Operation Zone of CBIS is "Spring."

338
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,560
There is a saying in the CBIS that goes,

339
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:43,230
"Where there's Hawkeye, there's Spring, and where there's Spring, there's Hawkeye."

340
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:44,190
So, I think

341
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:45,710
that Spring must have long infiltrated

342
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:46,750
Suzhou.

343
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:50,500
Is "Spring" a code name or a real name?

344
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:53,880
Mr. Kondo is asking you.

345
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,790
By the way, Director Zhou,

346
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:58,550
I heard that you have a lover

347
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:02,060
who is Xu Enzeng's trusted follower in the CBIS.

348
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:05,140
I wonder if Xu Enzeng

349
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:07,160
would appoint her as the Director.

350
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:10,330
I also wonder if "Spring"

351
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:13,230
is a woman.

352
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:15,440
Huang Xinzhai, you bastard!

353
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:16,730
Sir, help me!

354
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:18,230
Are you trying to get me killed?

355
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,980
I'm not capable of that.

356
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:20,870
Let go of me.

357
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:22,080
Let go of me!

358
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:24,430
Sir!

359
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:27,790
My son

360
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:28,990
is in Japan now.

361
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:30,870
I'll bet

362
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,230
my whole family's life.

363
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:35,030
I'll give up my life

364
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:37,810
if I have anything to do with Spring and Hawkeye.

365
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:40,070
Sir!

366
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:40,590
Sir!

367
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:41,540
Enough. Enough!

368
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:46,440
Catch Hawkeye, Spring,

369
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,390
and everyone from CBIS!

370
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:49,230
Leave it to me!

371
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:50,470
Gu Yizhong,

372
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:54,050
you're in charge of this case.

373
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:56,030
Do it now.

374
00:23:58,210 --> 00:23:59,270
Within three days,

375
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:00,760
I'll catch Hawkeye.

376
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:07,630
Your man is exposed.

377
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:09,270
Who?

378
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:11,950
Huang Xinzhai has started to suspect

379
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:14,640
that Ding Jiansheng was killed by your Hawkeye.

380
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:21,760
What are you doing here?

381
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:23,230
We're talking about business.

382
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:24,430
Then I have to listen.

383
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,750
Who knows if you will talk about business

384
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:27,880
mixed with affairs?

385
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:30,470
Director Zhou, come in and have a seat.

386
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:36,310
Huang Xinzhai also found out that you and Hawkeye

387
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:37,400
are in Suzhou.

388
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:41,590
We did have a traitor among us

389
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:42,960
who had turned to Huang Xinzhai.

390
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,350
But I've killed him.

391
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:48,550
Kondo is a paranoid man.

392
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,990
He has already suspected that

393
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:51,870
I've got something to do with the military rice case.

394
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:52,950
Now he suspects

395
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:55,370
that Ding Jiansheng was killed by your men.

396
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:56,350
If he finds out

397
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:57,850
that I'm in touch with you,

398
00:24:58,050 --> 00:25:00,000
not even Mr. Li can protect me.

399
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:04,330
So, Hawkeye can't be kept around.

400
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,160
Then I'll tell him to pull out.

401
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:06,970
He can't.

402
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:09,440
The city is under siege now.

403
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:10,510
There's only one gate

404
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:12,070
out of the whole city.

405
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,390
That's more reason for him to leave.

406
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:14,130
Suzhou is so small,

407
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:15,320
and there is no concession to hide.

408
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,400
Didn't you say

409
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:19,660
that only the dead tell no tales?

410
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:23,790
Miss Weng, how cruel of you!

411
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:25,990
Keep quiet for now.

412
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:28,870
Anyway, you can't let Hawkeye

413
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:30,120
live.

414
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:32,640
He is the best assassin in the CBIS.

415
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:34,840
If Mr. Xu knows that I abandoned him,

416
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:36,190
he won't let me off.

417
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:38,650
Today, Huang Xinzhai sent an indirect threat

418
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:40,760
in front of Kondo, hinting at our connection.

419
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,620
implying that we were in contact.

420
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:44,790
If Kondo gets suspicious,

421
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:47,280
he'll send someone to monitor my house soon.

422
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,630
Don't worry.

423
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:51,290
I'll leave here soon.

424
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:54,220
That's the only sentence

425
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,150
I understand.

426
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:56,480
Don't leave here yet.

427
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:59,800
The whole city is full of Huang Xinzhai's men.

428
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:01,710
The military police are out there, too.

429
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:03,770
It's safer for you to stay at my place.

430
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:05,440
I'll go back to No. 90

431
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:06,730
to see what's going on.

432
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:08,920
Don't go out.

433
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:11,340
You, keep an eye on Miss Weng for me

434
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:12,900
in case she goes somewhere.

435
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,700
Don't get too close to the window.

436
00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:21,420
Do you have plenty of

437
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:23,970
female agents there?

438
00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:27,380
But only a few and far between of them

439
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:29,430
can reach your level, right?

440
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:34,270
Mrs. Zhou, I have something to do.

441
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:35,660
Zhou Zhifei lied to me.

442
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:43,920
He said he didn't dare sleep with women from the CBIS.

443
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,530
You two must have slept together.

444
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:48,390
You're not Mr. Li's woman either.

445
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:55,550
Me, I'm way out of his league.

446
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:02,950
Close the door.

447
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:15,210
What are you burning in the middle of the night?

448
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:16,500
You might choke our son.

449
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,630
Open the window.

450
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,810
Something happened again?

451
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:27,190
Don't go to the Rickshaw Shop recently.

452
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:29,450
The liaison point has been compromised.

453
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:35,350
When will the leaders of the Provincial Committee arrive?

454
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:35,920
Soon.

455
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:38,670
I wrote a report

456
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:40,790
on my visit to Zhou Zhifei's house.

457
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,880
I'd like you to pass it on to the leaders of the Provincial Committee.

458
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:44,610
Is that okay?

459
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:46,950
You know

460
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:50,330
you may be isolated for the inspection for that,

461
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:54,790
and we would all be summoned back to the base.

462
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,070
It's still better than

463
00:27:58,070 --> 00:28:00,000
keeping it under wraps out of fear.

464
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:08,790
Zhiping,

465
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:11,640
from the moment

466
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:13,220
you introduced me to join the Party,

467
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:15,150
you've been teaching me to be a person

468
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:17,680
of absolute loyalty and honesty to the Party.

469
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:23,770
I'm facing my mistakes head-on.

470
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:26,030
I won't let you face it alone.

471
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:28,750
If you want to confess,

472
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,560
let's do it together.

473
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:35,030
Your mistake

474
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:38,150
is my mistake.

475
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:51,230
[Li's]

476
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:53,910
How much is it?

477
00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:01,390
How is it?

478
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:02,990
They're soggy.

479
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,890
[Li's Roasted Snacks]

480
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:15,410
[Li's]

481
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:30,650
You're exposed.

482
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:32,910
Impossible.

483
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:35,210
The mission was completed cleanly.

484
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:37,870
It's not our operation zone's fault.

485
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:39,970
I suspect someone at the top is colluding with them

486
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:41,830
and using us as bargaining chips.

487
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:45,000
We need to report this to Mr. Xu.

488
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:46,270
They are already suspecting

489
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:47,930
that you shot Ding Jiansheng.

490
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:49,020
Now they're investigating

491
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:50,270
Guo Jingji's murder.

492
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,400
You can't stay in Suzhou now.

493
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:57,560
This is a ticket to Shanghai

494
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:58,670
and a letter.

495
00:29:58,790 --> 00:29:59,850
When you return to Chongqing,

496
00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:01,850
be sure to give it to Mr. Xu yourself.

497
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,960
What will you do if I leave?

498
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:05,870
I'll be fine.

499
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:06,710
I have him.

500
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,020
Zhou Zhifei is fickle.

501
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:10,080
He betrayed the CPC and joined the CBIS.

502
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,990
Then he betrayed CBIS and joined the Wang Regime.

503
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:13,180
Be careful

504
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:15,030
when dealing with him.

505
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:16,900
Don't worry. Just go.

506
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:20,760
I can handle Zhou Zhifei now.

507
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:40,350
Go.

508
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:42,660
Don't move,

509
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:43,870
or I'll kill him!

510
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:45,530
Don't shoot!

511
00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:48,500
I want him alive.

512
00:31:50,050 --> 00:31:50,680
Disperse!

513
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:51,690
Tell me

514
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,840
who you met just now,

515
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:55,920
and I'll guarantee you'll be fine.

516
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:09,910
Why did you shoot?

517
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:11,660
I was afraid he would shoot you.

518

[Mr. Xu's Eyes Only]

519
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:22,110
Sorry.

520
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:24,730
I have to bring this back to Zhang Jiping.

521
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:27,670
Take the body back to No. 90.

522
00:32:27,670 --> 00:32:28,430
Yes, sir!

523
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:47,370
Hawkeye, Feng Zhiguo.

524
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:49,510
The top assassin in the CBIS.

525
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:51,070
What a pity.

526
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:53,090
He can't talk now.

527
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:57,750
How did Li Jiuzhao know where Hawkeye was?

528
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:11,670
Director Zhou sent

529
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:13,360
Li Jiuzhao and the others.

530
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,870
He's fast.

531
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:19,400
Suzhou is so big.

532
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:21,750
It's not that easy to find someone.

533
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,200
Unless...

534
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:25,430
Someone already knew his whereabouts.

535
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,180
Before Hawkeye died,

536
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:29,770
he met a woman.

537
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:32,120
What does she look like?

538
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:36,990
Medium figure

539
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:38,490
with a wide-brimmed hat.

540
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:39,950
She wears a black trench coat

541
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:41,350
and black leather shoes.

542
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:45,950
Spring.

543
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,640
She must be Spring.

544
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:53,120
Bro, once we catch her,

545
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,270
Zhou Zhifei will be doomed,

546
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:57,890

You want it?

Not a problem.

551
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:08,929
I'll ask someone to send it to you later.

552
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,460
Thank you, Vice Director.

553
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:12,909
I'll give you a watch to play with later.

554
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,250
Yizhong, you...

555
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:18,340
You don't have to.

556
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:19,530
I should.

557
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:20,889
No problem. No problem.

00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,080
Yizhong,

559
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:36,590

Why are you kneeling again?

561
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:40,090
How is your mother?

562
00:34:40,350 --> 00:34:41,350
My mother made it,

563
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:43,620
all thanks to the atropine you gave me.

564
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:44,679
I'll only say this.

565
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,480
From now on, you own my life.

566
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,340
You can take it whenever you want.

567
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:49,710
Come on, get up.

568
00:34:49,739 --> 00:34:51,469
I won't get up unless you agree.

569
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,790
Gao Hu,

570
00:34:58,170 --> 00:34:59,700
I really need your help now.

571
00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:03,100
But you can't let anyone at the station

572
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:05,110
know about this.

Mr. Jiang.

579
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:41,470
Get lost!

Come out!

Get out!

00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:44,780
Close the door! Close the door!

00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:51,390
This old bastard is really troublesome.

He never stops.

585
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:54,150
Lower your voice.

00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:12,290

Oh no!

Mr. Jiang, are you okay?

Are you okay?

593
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,790
Mr. Li, he's at it again.

594
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:46,990
It's been several times

595
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:48,570
that he has wanted to kill himself.

596
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:49,680
Don't worry.

597
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:51,710
Jiang Boxian is afraid of death.

598
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:54,390
He wouldn't dare kill himself.

599
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:58,080
This place is being targeted.

600
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:00,470
Transfer him to Suzhou.

601
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:14,800
Ou Xinping,

602
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:16,580
this isn't child's play.

603
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:20,070
You had someone else send

604
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:22,440
the letter I asked you to give to Xu Enzeng?

605
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:23,600
Do you know

606
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:25,580
Kondo almost got the letter?

607
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:27,850
Something happened to Hawkeye?

608
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:29,470
You promised me before

609
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:31,130
that you would keep him alive!

610
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:35,760
How can you be more ruthless than before, Zhifei?

611
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,890
In this situation,

612
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:40,350
save yurself first before you want to save others.

613
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:41,670
Do they suspect you?

614
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:44,550
Now Gu Yizhong

615
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:46,360
is teaming up with the Vice Director, Huang Xinzhai,

616
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,590
to come after me.

617
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:50,110
Huang Xinzhai used to work for NBIS.

618
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,860
He and Mr. Li are nemesis.

619
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:54,880
Now, they dealt with Hawkeye,

620
00:37:55,390 --> 00:37:57,520
and you're next.

00:37:57,630 --> 00:37:59,230

622
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:02,320

Do something for me.

00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:11,520
by Shanghai Headquarters, No. 76.

627
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:15,880
Isn't that old opium addict Jiang Boxian

628
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,160
in Chongqing?

629
00:38:18,350 --> 00:38:20,800
I just received a cipher telegram from Mr. Xu.

630
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,350
Mr. Lifu ordered us

631
00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:24,210
to save him

632
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:25,850
at all costs.

633
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:33,640
The Shanghai Headquarters arrested him.

634
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:37,230
I'm just the Director of Suzhou Station. I can't do anything.

635
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:38,220
I have a tip-off

636
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:39,970
that the traitor in Shanghai

637
00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:41,570
wants to silence Jiang Boxian.

638
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:42,830
So, Mr. Li

639
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:43,670
wants to transfer him

640
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:45,110
to your No. 90 in Suzhou.

641
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:46,670
He is Generalissimo Chiang's

A current member of the Kuomintang Central Committee.

644
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,090
I don't think it's that simple.

645
00:38:58,030 --> 00:38:59,880
Mr. Xu asks us to save him,

646
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:01,230
and so we will.

647
00:39:01,650 --> 00:39:02,430
Sorry.

648
00:39:02,450 --> 00:39:04,290
I don't work for Mr. Xu.

649
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:18,730
Xinping,

650
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,140
why do you

651
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:22,590
have to work for Xu?

652
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:27,230
Why don't you join us too?

653
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:29,430
Mr. Li is

654
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:30,660
our former superior.

655
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:33,010
He needs people right now.

656
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:38,410
I always adhere to the group's guiding principles.

657
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:42,320
You're still set in your own ways.

658
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:46,700
We women are all like that.

659
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:55,810
What are you doing?

660
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,990
If my guess is right,

661
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:01,560
you didn't write anything, right?

662
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:04,020
I don't know what to write to him.

663
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:06,130
You never intended to come back to work for him.

664
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:06,660
Yes.

665
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:14,480
Xu Enzeng didn't deserve our loyalty.

666
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:15,240
Understand?

667
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:18,100
Mr. Li is different.

668
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:21,400
When my mother passed away,

669
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,350
I couldn't go to my mother's funeral

670
00:40:24,350 --> 00:40:25,830
because of work.

671
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:28,070
It was Mr. Li

672
00:40:28,110 --> 00:40:30,000
who wore white and knelt for me.

673
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:32,360
Just for this favor alone,

674
00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:34,040
I owe him for a lifetime.

675
00:40:35,270 --> 00:40:36,470
What about Xu Enzeng?

676
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:38,000
What did he do for us?

677
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:39,590
Other than

678
00:40:39,610 --> 00:40:41,260
inviting us to his villa

679
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,290
to eat those awful Western dishes

680
00:40:43,290 --> 00:40:44,820
and saying something nice,

681
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,540
what else did he do?

682
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:49,790
Xinping,

683
00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:51,750
join us.

684
00:40:52,570 --> 00:40:53,910
Mr. Li is different.

685
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:56,620
He's always looking out for...

686
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,160
You've got nothing but your home in your heart.

687
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,950
But beyond your home, there's still a country.

688
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:00,880
In these times,

689
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:04,320
it's already impressive to keep a home safe.

690
00:41:04,350 --> 00:41:05,480
You're impressive.

691
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,280
I'll leave your home now.

692
00:41:10,310 --> 00:41:11,860
Sir, we have a visitor.

693
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:12,760
Who is it?

694
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,440
He said he was Gu Yizhong.

695
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:24,970
I'll be right away.

696
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,230
Not bad.

697
00:41:51,450 --> 00:41:52,880
You can find my home.

698
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,610
Suzhou is not so big.

699
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,950
Director Zhou, can you let me,

700
00:41:59,010 --> 00:42:01,140
an uninvited guest, into your home?

701
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,080
No.

702
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:05,340
If you have anything to say, you can say it here.

703
00:42:06,450 --> 00:42:07,970
Kondo ordered me

704
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:09,660
to investigate Ding Jiansheng's murder.

705
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:10,190
At the station...

706
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:11,850
You don't have to tell me that.

707
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:13,750
There's a principle in agent work.

708
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:14,840
The right hand doesn't need to know

709
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:16,170
what the left hand does.

710
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,190
But no matter how hard I investigate,

711
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:21,320
someone is always one step ahead of me.

712
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:23,360
Ding Jiansheng is dead,

713
00:42:23,730 --> 00:42:24,930
and so is Hawkeye.

714
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,290
They've all been silenced.

715
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:30,140
So you've come to my home today to investigate,

716
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:32,140
and you think I'll be the next to die.

717
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:33,280
Is that what you've come here

718
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,530
to tell me?

719
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:37,830
I'm here about Spring,

720
00:42:40,370 --> 00:42:43,230
the Director of the Jiangsu Operation Zone of CBIS.

721
00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:45,570
Director Zhou,

722
00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:49,510
I suppose you've had dealings with her before?

723
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:52,750
Come in and have a drink.
