What is it this time?

6

Mr. Kondo is back.

7
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:58,289
Isn't he coming back next month?

8
00:01:58,289 --> 00:02:00,550
So many big things have happened at the station.

9
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:01,590
How could he not come back?

10

Should we send him to the military court

18
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,240

00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:21,670
Really?

193
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:23,010
The bed is so stiff.

194
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:49,190
Mr. Huang?

195
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,020
I've been following you since morning.

196
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:04,850
Gu Yizhong.

197
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:07,240
Calm down. Don't be impulsive.

198
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:09,540
My dad is dead,

199
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,120
and now my sister is dead too.

200
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:14,650
It's all Zhou Zhifei's fault.

201
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:17,990
If I don't take revenge by killing this traitor,

202
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:21,150
I'll be ashamed to be my father's son and my sister's brother.

203
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:23,030
You'll only avenge your personal vendetta

204
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:24,500
by shooting him.

205
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:25,670
Do you know

206
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:28,190
who really caused the deaths

207
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:28,910
of your father and sister?

208
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:29,970
It's the Japanese,

209
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:30,890
the invaders.

210
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:32,390
Since the War of Resistance against the Japanese broke out,

211
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:33,790
countless Chinese have died

212
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:35,190
because of the invasion.

213
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:36,910
If the country is in chaos, the family will be in chaos.

214
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:38,580
I am doing the people a favor.

215
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:41,710
Kill this traitor

216
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:44,010
for the 400,000 people of Suzhou.

217
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:47,240
Yizhong, you still don't understand!

218
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,750
The scholars use their words to subvert the law,

219
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,190
while the martial heroes use their strength to break the rules.

220
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:51,250
Where is justice?

221
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:53,750
I'm asking you. Where is justice?

222
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,310
Right. Where is justice?

223
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,630
Villains succeed while justice is obscured.

224
00:16:58,630 --> 00:16:59,790
Are we going to

225
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:00,550
give this world

226
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:02,230
to these shameless traitors?

227
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:03,030
Of course not.

228
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:04,790
Zhou Zhifei is a lackey who has served three masters.

229
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,510
Traitors like him who betray the country and the Party

230
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:09,220
should face the judgment of history

231
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:11,130
and the bullets of the people.

232
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:15,390
If you kill Zhou Zhifei like this now,

233
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:18,550
you'll be exposed.

234
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:19,500
It's not worth it.

235
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,829
The judgment of history

236
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,480
and the bullets of the people.

237
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,030
Yes!

238
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,190
This is justice.

239
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,270
Yizhong.

240
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:31,610
Put your gun away.

241
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:36,240
Killing Zhou Zhifei would only bring momentary satisfaction.

242
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:38,350
Even if we killed Zhou Zhifei,

243
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:40,300
there would be other traitors.

244
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,500
Why don't we use his conflict with Kondo

245
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:46,780
as a cover for your infiltration at No. 90?

246
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:49,430
I joined No. 90

247
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:52,720
only to prove my innocence.

248
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,720
Now that the truth is revealed,

249
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,320
I don't know what else I can do.

250
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:09,590
There are too many things you can do.

251
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,750
If it weren't for the clues you provided,

252
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,990
there is no way that He Shunjiang and Zhou Zhenwu

253
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:19,050
could have gotten so many medicines.

254
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:20,030
How important

255
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,310
those medicines are

256
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:23,350
for the soldiers of the New Fourth Army

257
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:24,680
on the battlefield!

258
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:26,750
If you hadn't been at No. 90,

259
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:29,680
Xiao Junxia wouldn't have been saved.

260
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,320
They are all thanks to you.

261
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:33,640
That's what you're here for at No. 90.

262
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,000
Yizhong.

263
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:40,930
I know you're lonely.

264
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:43,870
This time, the Party sent me back specifically

265
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:46,800
to activate your identity quickly

266
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:49,470
and coordinate our work in the Suzhou and Shanghai regions.

267
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:51,370
There is a photo studio on Pingjiang Road

268
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:52,430
called Rongguang.

269
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:54,230
It's one of our liaison points.

270
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:55,340
From now on,

271
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:58,070
you can go to that liaison point to communicate with me alone and directly.

272
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:00,590
I'm now officially your superior.

273
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:05,200
Please believe

274
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:08,180
that you are not fighting alone.

275
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:22,660
Yizhong, come.

276
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:24,420
Look at our Suzhou.

277
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:31,810
The city under the sun

278
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:33,350
is so beautiful.

279
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:36,190
Our home is so beautiful.

280
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:40,530
Yizhong.

281
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:42,050
I know

282
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:45,340
that you're not a communist yet.

283
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,290
But I hope that the belief in Communism

284
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:50,110
can give you strength

285
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:53,670
and lead you out of the endless darkness.

286
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:26,360
♫We've never met before♫

287
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:37,600
♫Why does he show surprise at seeing me?♫

288
00:20:43,060 --> 00:21:01,740
♫He is refined and scholarly in appearance♫

289
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:13,870
Regarding Huizhong's death

290
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:17,620
and the fact that Hu Zhiping was Cell 8,

291
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,760
Junxia has written a detailed report,

292
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:21,750
which will be sent to the Enemy Intelligence Section,

293
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:24,810
Division Ministry of Political Affairs, by liaisons.

294
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:27,020
Yizhong,

295
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,400
your name has finally been cleared.

296
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:36,530
I've sacrificed too much

297
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:39,830
for this day.

298
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:43,000
My dad is gone.

299
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:46,100
Now my sister is gone too.

300
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:50,230
I have no family.

301
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:52,100
You still have me.

302
00:21:57,010 --> 00:21:57,820
Ruotong,

303
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:01,350
do you remember how we used to be here

304
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:02,900
before the war?

305
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:07,220
At that time, we were full of hope.

306
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:09,490
What is hope?

307
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:13,240
It's beautiful dreams

308
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:15,290
and noble ideals,

309
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:17,990
or the candle in the dark?

310
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:22,510
At that time, no matter what happened,

311
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:23,760
I always told myself

312
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:25,640
to be full of hope

313
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:26,830
and keep going.

314
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:30,530
But reality always

315
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:33,690
extinguishes my candle again and again.

316
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:38,120
I'm alone at night now.

317
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,740
I have no strength

318
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:42,430
to light the candle again.

319
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:48,740
Yizhong.

320
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:53,990
There's still hope.

321
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:56,980
There will be.

322
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:05,710
The Party has agreed

323
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:07,790
for you to go back to the base with us.

324
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:11,750
Junxia is already making arrangements for it.

325
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,480
We'll be able to leave as soon

326
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:15,770
as everything is set.

327
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:21,950
What?

328
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:24,770
There are things

329
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:29,480
that I don't know how to say.

330
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:33,430
It's okay. Then don't say it.

331
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,750
Stop frowning,

332
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:45,430
okay?

333
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:05,800
Ruotong,

334
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:08,170
when do you think

335
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:11,300
we'll be able to be together

336
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:13,360
like this,

337
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:16,300
carefree and quiet?

338
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,380
I think it'll be soon.

339
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:27,060
Soon.

[Ready for Battle]

341
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:49,000
What took you so long?

342
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:51,270
Mr. Kondo is getting tired of waiting.

343
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:52,350
He asked me to come out and check

344
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:53,220
where you were.

345
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:54,340
Hurry up.

346
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:55,410
I'm off work.

347
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:56,410
Off...

348
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:59,120
Agents are always on duty.

349
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:01,790
Sir,

350
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:05,220
I was about to rest

351
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:08,410
when Vice Director Huang said that you have an urgent matter.

352
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:09,210
What's wrong?

353
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:12,390
You and your wife moved to the dormitory at the station,

354
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:12,950
right?

355
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:14,810
Yes.

356
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:18,260
Kumindang in Chongqing is vicious

357
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:20,490
and has been trying to assassinate me.

358
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:22,280
Ou, the Director, ordered it?

359
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,420
I don't know about that.

360
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:24,790
I'm also investigating it.

361
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:27,320
I've informed the military police in Suzhou.

362
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:30,630
Suzhou's eight land city gates and three water city gates

363
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:33,880
have been tightly controlled for entry and exit.

364
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:37,040
The Kumindang can't come in.

365
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:38,350
Thank you.

366
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:40,090
Sir, you're so powerful.

367
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:44,110
While I was away,

368
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,110
something went wrong at No. 90?

369
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:57,220
Sir, nothing serious happened.

370
00:25:57,510 --> 00:26:00,710
It's just that our dungeon had a big hole blown in it,

371
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:03,360
and a communist escaped.

372
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:04,390
Huang,

373
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:07,140
you're full of lies.

374
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:08,390
Sir,

375
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:11,170
my loyalty to you is immense.

376
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:23,510

00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:27,040
Sir,

379
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:29,120
who is this person in the photo?

380
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:30,410
You don't know him?

381
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:32,990
Zhou Zhifei, do you know him?

382
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:33,830
I don't know.

383
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:36,340
An important person in the Kuomintang.

384
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:39,070
Jiang Boxian, a member of the Central Committee.

385
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,030
It's said that he sneaked into Beijing and Shanghai

386
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:44,790
and was captured by No. 76.

387
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:48,790
The military police in Shanghai came to the Agent Headquarters to ask for him.

388
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:51,090
Li said that he didn't know anything.

389
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:54,240
According to reliable information,

390
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,550
Jiang is in Suzhou,

391
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:57,280
at our No. 90.

392
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:01,400
S-S-Such a serious matter happened.

393
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:02,110
Sir, I...

394
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:03,860
How come I don't know anything?

395
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:06,470
Then Director Zhou must know about it.

396
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:08,760
Director Zhou, you must know about it.

397
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,220
How would I know?

398
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:11,520
You are the director of the station...

399
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,650
I've asked Warden Lu.

400
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:15,050
Zhou Zhifei,

401
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:17,120
when did you take Jiang into custody,

402
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,420
and where is he now?

403
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:20,050
Sir,

404
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:22,600
in the cases I've been handling recently,

405
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,560
this person doesn't

406
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,600
ring a bell to me.

407
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:27,250
Our Warden Lu.

408
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,590
He is usually careful and meticulous

409
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:30,950
in his work.

410
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:32,230
Our prison has been recognized

411
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:33,270
as a model prison

412
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:35,950
for two consecutive years by the Headquarters.

413
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,000
Actually, it's very simple.

414
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,290
[Jiang Boxian; Chongqing Government Central Committee]

415
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:39,970
Let's pull up the prison records

416
00:27:39,970 --> 00:27:41,090
and check them,

417
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:43,140
and they will tell us everything.

418
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:45,540
The Warden said the exact same thing as you.

419
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,740
Have you coordinated the story?

420
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:49,090
I don't know.

421
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:51,880
Huang!

422
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,310
You really don't know?

423
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:55,310
Tell me the truth.

424
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:56,430
I...

425
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,180
Sir,

426
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:00,870
I remember now.

427
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:02,830
One night,

428
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:04,810
I saw Zhang Jiping and others

429
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:08,480
take one person to the dungeon.

430
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:09,870
But

431
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:11,790
he's not the person in the photo.

432
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:15,310
Could it be that some of the information

433
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:16,700
was not accurate?

434
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:20,880
Get out!

435
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:21,510
Yes!

436
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:33,790
Your son sent you another letter.

437
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:40,240
The Osaka Army Local Juvenile School

438
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:43,000
is recruiting young cadets from the Kyoto International Students Academy

439
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,730
to train military cadres for the Empire of Japan.

440
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:54,350
I have recommended your son.

441
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:59,140
My son has been weak since childhood.

442
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:01,190
He's supposed to be particularly unsuited

443
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:02,780
to be a military talent.

444
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:05,940
Please reconsider it, sir.

445
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:13,460
Jiang Boxian.

446
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:25,100
[To Mr. Zhou Zhifei]

447
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:36,830
Young Master, you're back. Have you eaten?

448
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:38,430
How about I make some food for you?

449
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:39,180
I'm okay.

450
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:41,280
Let me hug you.

451
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:47,910
Is he good today?

452
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:50,090
Yes, he ate well and slept well.

453
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:52,150
Fortunately, Nanny Yu had enough breast milk.

454
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:54,050
Junsheng is well-fed.

455
00:29:55,910 --> 00:29:57,150
Where is Haimo?

456
00:29:57,790 --> 00:30:00,590
She went to the Feng Garden Story-telling Theatre this afternoon and hasn't come back yet.

457
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:03,230
Usually, she should be back by this hour.

458
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,560
Junsheng,

459
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:09,730
good boy.

460
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:10,490
Mrs. Wang.

461
00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:11,040
Come on.

462
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:11,770
Let me hold him.

463
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:12,390
Okay.

464
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:16,530
There's a car parked at your door.

465
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:18,460
Listen to the driver when you get in.

466
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,420
[Gu's Mansion]

467
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:21,140
Otherwise, you'll never see Haimo again.

468
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:35,370
Put the hood on.

469
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:50,600
Get on the boat.

470
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:07,250
What are you doing here?

471
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,110
Go now.

472
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:09,850
A pair of lovebirds.

473
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:12,040
Haimo doesn't belong in our world.

474
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:13,540
Don't drag her into this.

475
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:16,610
No wonder she follows you with all her heart.

476
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,940
You're indeed a Romeo.

477
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:19,960
Too bad you're a special agent now.

478
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,120
Tell me.

479
00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:25,350
What will it take for you to let her go?

480
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:26,270
Jiang Boxian.

481
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:27,870
It's hard.

482
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:29,610
Then dig the dungeon again

483
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:31,050
or think of other ways.

484
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:33,510
Mrs. Weng,

485
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,070
Jiang Boxian is no longer at No. 90.

486
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:37,950
Zhou Zhifei has transferred him to a secret location.

487
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:39,150
No one knows where he is.

488
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:40,270
Even if we find out where he is,

489
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:41,630
no one can rescue him.

490
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:44,110
That's why we thought of you.

491
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:45,520
It's a good deal for you.

492
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:50,270
Haimo is a better match for you than that schoolgirl.

493
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:51,140
Don't listen to her.

494
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:51,790
Shut up.

495
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:52,470
Go!

496
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:53,870
Did I tell you to talk?

497
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:54,750
She's not my cousin-in-law!

498
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:55,130
Go!

499
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:56,070
If you dare lay a finger on her again,

500
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:57,290
there will be no deal!

501
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:00,950
Deal, then.

502
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:02,430
Mrs. Weng,

503
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:04,510
you should come to Zhou Zhifei for this.

504
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:05,910
Isn't he one of yours?

505
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:08,590
He's the one who wants me dead.

506
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:11,350
A shameless traitor to CBIS and the country.

507
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:13,750
You have two days.

508
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:16,190
Trade that old man for her.

509
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:17,160
Two days?

510
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:18,690
I can't do it.

511
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,220
You can't?

512
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:21,910
You...

513
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:22,560
Yizhong.

514
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:23,450
Don't agree to it.

515
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:24,510
She's only acting.

516
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:25,030
Go!

517
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:26,990
Am I acting?

518
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:31,530
In two days,

519
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:33,530
if I can't see Jiang Boxian,

520
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:35,770
you can just wait to collect her body.

521
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:37,070
The Japanese military police

522
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:38,760
are also looking for Jiang Boxian.

523
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,870
If the Japanese got him first,

524
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:43,470
the Kuomintang should have also surrendered,

525
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:44,250
just like the Wang Regime.

526
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:44,860
So,

527
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,380
no matter who you are working for,

528
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:49,800
you should be a patriot.

529
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:50,880
Helping me

530
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:52,860
is helping yourself.

531
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:56,270
Deal.

532
00:33:00,890 --> 00:33:03,290
[Your son, Youfei, kowtow]

To bring glory to Father and Mother.

535
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:10,680
You take a look.

536
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,910
You check the letter

537
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:13,550
and see if he gets beaten again?

538
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:14,870
What's there to see?

539
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:17,200
It's not like he wanted to write it.

540
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:18,710
It's him.

541
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:19,750
It's his handwriting.

542
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:20,470
I recognize his handwriting...

543
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:22,470
Can't I recognize his handwriting?

544
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:24,020
Take a closer look

545
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:27,150
and see what the difference is

546
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:28,610
from what he wrote before.

547
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:31,370
He didn't write like this before,

548
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:33,620
neat and graceful.

that it's a sample letter

someone told him to copy.

554
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:41,480
Why did he have to copy a sample letter?

555
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:44,230
It's not like he hasn't written a letter to us before.

556

To make you rest assured.

557
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:50,830

558
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:52,030
tell me.

If the Japanese

really force Youfei to join their army,

561
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:57,930
and then one day

562

00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:06,210
Are you crazy?

566
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:09,610
Isn't it enough for me to be a traitor?

567
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:11,790
You still want your son to become a Japanese soldier

568
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:14,020
and then come back to fight against us Chinese?

569
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:15,620
Are you still Chinese or not?

570
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:17,270
Get up!

571
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:17,929
Okay. Okay.

572
00:34:17,949 --> 00:34:18,670
What?

573
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:21,750
It almost went off.

574
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:23,389
What's wrong with you?

575
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:25,650
Why are you hiding guns on the bed?

576
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:31,659
Did the Japanese ask you

577
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:32,889
to hand over someone,

578
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:35,710
but Mr. Li doesn't allow you to do so?

579
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:38,590
Who told you that?

580
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:40,949
Don't always gossip with them.

581
00:34:41,989 --> 00:34:43,719
Don't ask me about my business.

582
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:47,480
I don't want to live here for even a single day.

583
00:34:48,489 --> 00:34:49,790
Did you bring any fancy dresses

584
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:50,800
in your luggage?

585
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,580
Why are you asking?

586
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:55,690
I'll take you out for a business occasion tomorrow.

587
00:34:55,690 --> 00:34:56,500
Really?

588
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,700
Let me tell you.

589
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:05,180
Staying in your shabby dormitory every day,

590
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:07,590
makes me feel like I'm constantly surrounded

591
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:10,020
by the smell of dried salted fish.

592
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:15,950
Do you think I should wear the green one

593
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:17,960
or the floral one?

594
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:22,320
Darn it.

595
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:25,320
I don't think I brought that green one.

596
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:52,160
Yizhong.

597
00:35:57,870 --> 00:35:58,830
Good news.

598
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:00,250
We can leave tomorrow.

599
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:01,420
Junxia has a connection

600
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:03,030
who's a battalion commander in the Peace Army.

601
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:05,310
It just so happens that they're going out of town tomorrow for the "pacification" operation.

602
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:07,110
We can disguise ourselves as soldiers

603
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:08,190
and sneak out of the city gate.

604
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:09,990
Let's pass Chang Gate and go to Changshu.

605
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:14,880
♫Wisps of clouds adrift in the sky♫

606
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:11,140
Our unit

607
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:12,770
has built a new base there.

608
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:14,930
I've got the clothes for you.

609
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:17,500
This is the military uniform of the Peace Army.

610
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:24,090
♫A gentle breeze whispers by on the ground♫

611
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:26,750
I can't go with you tomorrow.

612
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:28,190
Why?

613
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:32,430
Haimo was kidnapped by the people of CBIS.

614
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:35,930
♫Soft fingers of breeze tousle my hair♫

615
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:34,630
I have to save her.

616
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:36,670
They're forcing me to rescue Jiang Boxian.

617
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:40,970
♫How can I not think of her?♫

618
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:38,020
Jiang Boxian?

619
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:40,350
Junxia's opium-smoking cellmate?

620
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:41,920
That's him.

621
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:43,890
Ruotong.

622
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:45,580
Haimo saved my life

623
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:47,560
and has been helping Gu's Garden.

624
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:49,120
I can't just leave her.

625
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:56,390
♫The moonlight in love with the ocean♫

626
00:36:52,870 --> 00:36:54,490
Tomorrow, you and Junxia will leave first.

627
00:36:54,490 --> 00:36:55,510
Once I solve it,

628
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:57,510
I'll go to Changshu to find you.

629
00:36:57,510 --> 00:36:58,030
Okay?

630
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:05,100
♫The ocean is in love with the moonlight♫

631
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:01,190
Okay.

632
00:37:03,370 --> 00:37:05,030
Saving her is more important.

633
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:16,640
♫This honey-like silver night♫

634
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:22,370
♫How can I not think of her?♫

635
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:22,500
It's been a long time since we

636
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,300
listened to this song together.

637
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,770
Yizhong, do you remember

638
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:32,400
the time when you just came back to China?

639
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:35,120
When we went on a picnic in the Lingering Garden,

640
00:37:35,930 --> 00:37:37,520
you sang this song for me.

641
00:37:39,210 --> 00:37:40,700
At that time, I thought

642
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:46,470
♫Fallen blossoms drift slowly with the river♫

643
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:44,110
that I must be the happiest person in the world.

644
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:48,470
It's strange. Lately, I...

645
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:55,120
♫Fish swim slowly beneath♫

646
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:52,190
I've been missing the old times.

647
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:55,560
The time

648
00:37:56,970 --> 00:37:58,700
you were by my side.

649
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:05,320
♫Swallow, what are you saying?♫

650
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:03,270
I'm still waiting for you

651
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:04,670
to sing this song for me.

652
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:10,150
♫How can I not think of her?♫

653
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:23,240
♫The withered trees shake in the cold wind♫

654
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:23,110
I miss it too.

655
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:29,510
♫Wildfires burn in the dusk♫

656
00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:39,400
♫The western sky still has some residual glow♫

657
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:56,430
When will Zhou Zhifei come to see me?

658
00:38:57,310 --> 00:38:58,020
Tell him.

659
00:38:58,530 --> 00:38:59,660
Either kill me

660
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:00,910
or let me go.

661
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:02,530
There's no way

662
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:03,950
I'm going to be a traitor!

663
00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:06,590
Jiang,

664
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:07,860
don't be angry.

665
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:10,710
Let me prepare another opium pipe for you.

666
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:12,030
Pipe?

667
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:13,020
All you know is it!

668
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:14,820
Is this really the time for that?

669
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,360
You... give me a massage.

670
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:20,870
Why are you so angry?

671
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:22,530
Tell him to come and see me now!

672
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:39,190
Mr. Jiang.

673
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:41,430
I'm sorry. I'm busy.

674
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:42,840
I happen to be free today,

675
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,060
so I came to see you.

676
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:46,030
Hypocrite.

677
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:48,590
Who is the one beside you?

678
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:50,270
She is my wife, Ji.

679
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:52,590
This is Mr. and Mrs. Jiang,

680
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:54,110
whom I've been telling you about.

681
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:55,110
Mr. Jiang, hello.

682
00:39:55,790 --> 00:39:56,220
Hello.

683
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:57,570
Mrs. Jiang, hello.

684
00:39:58,770 --> 00:40:00,570
I heard from Zhou

685
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:02,160
that you're from Jintan.

686
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:04,290
We're from Yixing.

687
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:05,950
Our hometowns are very close.

688
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:07,200
Yixing?

689
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,330
It's true, we're close.

690
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:10,410
Jiang,

691
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:12,910
the Director's wife is our fellow townsman.

692
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:14,810
Then you have to take good care of Jiang.

693
00:40:14,810 --> 00:40:15,870
Well, it's my duty.

694
00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:19,310
I've been meaning to come and visit you for a long time.

695
00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:20,970
How about this?

696
00:40:21,310 --> 00:40:22,750
I don't like

697
00:40:22,770 --> 00:40:24,270
their men talking about business.

698
00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:25,430
How about you take me inside?

699
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:25,870
Sure.

700
00:40:25,870 --> 00:40:26,800
Let's talk about women's stuff.

701
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,540
Sure.

702
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:28,750
Please come in.

703
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,240
Well, we're going inside, Mr. Jiang.

704
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,280
Okay, please.

705
00:40:33,310 --> 00:40:34,150
Director, excuse me.

706
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:34,830
Suit yourself.

707
00:40:34,830 --> 00:40:36,490
Let's go. I was just telling Jiang

708
00:40:36,490 --> 00:40:37,750
that I wanted to go out.

709
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:41,650
Mr. Jiang,

710
00:40:42,350 --> 00:40:43,910
how is the environment here?

711
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:44,970
Do you like it here?

712
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:47,200
I'm here to say

713
00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:48,950
that if you have any requests,

714
00:40:48,950 --> 00:40:50,280
just tell them.

715
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:53,750
I'll try to satisfy you with whatever I can on my end.

716
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:55,480
You're still so hypocritical.

717
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:57,630
No wonder you work for the Wang Regime.

718
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:00,930
I'll ask you one question.

719
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:03,580
Do you want to keep me here forever?

720
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:04,670
Of course not.

721
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:06,650
Mr. Li said

722
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,730
that if you could cooperate with us,

723
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:10,670
we could send you back to Chongqing at any time.

724
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:11,150
Of course,

725
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:12,990
or anywhere in China you prefer.

726
00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:18,510
Do you think I'll still believe you?

727
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:23,200
I think you still have

728
00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:25,580
trust in us.

729
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:28,330
Otherwise, you would...

730
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:30,580
Otherwise, you could have

731
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:32,430
gone out through the tunnel

732
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:35,250
with that Communist Xiao, right?

733
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:37,460
That day,

734
00:41:38,690 --> 00:41:41,850
I had too much opium.

735
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:42,960
To leave there?

736
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,050
I don't think so.

737
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:49,310
I think you did it on purpose.

738
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:54,470
You...

739
00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:02,230
The Communist Party

740
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:03,930
forbids everything.

741
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,380
I'm really...

742
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,140
I can't take it.

743
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:09,080
I feel the same.

744
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:11,100
I know them too well.

745
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:12,810
Not only you;

746
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:16,080
if I were you today and rejoined the Communist Party,

747
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:18,480
I wouldn't have been able to take it either.

748
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:20,750
We wouldn't have such a comfortable environment

749
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:21,810
as this,

750
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:22,630
right?
