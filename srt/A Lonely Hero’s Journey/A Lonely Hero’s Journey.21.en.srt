4
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:44,030
I was eager to see you

5
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:46,850
because I wanted to confirm who Cell 8 is.

6
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:50,310
Hu Zhiping.

7
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:51,470
Do you have any evidence?

8
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:53,020
I've never had solid evidence,

9
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:54,340
but I'm sure

10
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:56,670
Cell 8 is him.

11
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,150
Is there a situation?

12
00:01:59,070 --> 00:01:59,550
No.

13
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:02,750
Huizhong has been complaining

14
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,270
about not being able to buy milk powder.

15
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:05,910
I managed to get a can for the baby,

16
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:07,610
though it's Japanese.

17
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:09,789
Great!

This is really helpful.

19
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:14,550
Huizhong has been so worried about the milk powder

20
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:16,480
that she hasn't been able to sleep.

21
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:17,890

It's the least I could do.

24

I'm Zhou Zhifei, Director of Suzhou Agent Station.

381
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:34,830
You traitor!

382
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:37,450
Since you know me,

383
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:41,710
we can speed up the process.

384
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:44,860
This photo was taken

385
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:46,600
this afternoon

386
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:48,610
when your wife was at my house.

387
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:52,250
We just developed it.

388
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:54,970
Look here, look here.

389
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:56,390
Okay.

390
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:57,890
Who is the lady next to her?

391
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:01,950
Ji Yuqing, my wife.

392
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:04,000
Without my permission,

393
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:05,910
your wife can't leave my house.

394
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:06,930
Despicable!

395
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:12,840
Since our wives can be friends,

396
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:15,390
we can be friends too.

397
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:17,590
You help me with a small favor,

398
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:19,390
and I'll let your wife come home.

399
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:20,640
He threatened me

400
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:24,190
with you and our baby.

401
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:36,380
Hu Zhiping.

402
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:39,000
your wife is pregnant.

403
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:41,430
You should buy some good things.

404
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:44,430
This is third-grade.

405
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:45,710
Next time, I'll send you

406
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:47,550
first-grade date.

407
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:50,330
Help me with a small favor

408
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:52,400
—not just for yourself,

409
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:53,960
but for your wife

410
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:56,400
and the child soon to be born.

411
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:00,860
If I don't do what they ask,

412
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:03,170
he'll kill you immediately.

413
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:04,830
Huizhong,

414
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:07,390
I can't sacrifice your life

415
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:11,070
because of my own decisions.

416
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:12,920
My name is Hu Zhiping,

417
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,750
from Baoshan County, Jiangsu.

418
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:16,870
I now

419
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:19,350
voluntarily join Suzhou's

420
00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:20,860
No. 90 Agent Station,

421
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:24,010
code name:

422
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:26,110
Cell 8.

423
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:29,110
I have betrayed my oath

424
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:34,000
and become a disgraceful traitor.

425
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:35,980
Zhou Zhifei also threatened me,

426
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:38,290
saying that if I ever turned back,

427
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:40,750
he would make

428
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:43,110
my secret defection recording public.

429
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:46,280
I destroyed Nakanishi Tarou's photo.

430
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:48,710
To cooperate with Zhou Zhifei

431
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:50,270
and continue completing the mission,

432
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:53,230
I could only forge a photo

433
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:54,500
to hand over to Eagle.

434
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:55,910
I knew

435
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:59,070
that was a trap.

436
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:00,750
I knew that

437
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,570
the action team

438
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:05,900
wouldn't return,

439
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:08,870
but there was no turning back for me.

440
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:11,410
You keep saying

441
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:14,390
everything is for me,

442
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:16,550
but why did you set up my brother?

443
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:17,480
I didn't.

444
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:21,030
That was never my intention.

445
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:23,320
After the incident,

446
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:26,010
everyone started suspecting Eagle.

447
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:29,680
I thought of using this opportunity

448
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,190
to pin the blame on Eagle

449
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:32,890
so that

450
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:35,700
I could completely clear my name.

451
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:39,860
But who could have predicted

452
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:42,430
that Gu Yizhong would suddenly get involved?

453
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:44,410
You better treat me to a meal for this.

454
00:31:44,410 --> 00:31:45,310
Just a meal.

455
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:45,930
Bro,

456
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:47,840
have any of you seen a woman

457
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:49,550
of medium build, short hair,

458
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:50,510
with a tiger tooth?

459
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:51,030
Have you seen her?

460
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:51,760
Tiger tooth?

461
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:53,430
Have you seen anyone like this?

462
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:54,970
So many people come and go every day.

463
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:56,170
How could I remember?

464
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:57,410
Think carefully.

465
00:31:57,510 --> 00:31:59,030
She left around 3 p.m.,

466
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:00,590
holding a child probably.

467
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,750
I can't recall.

468
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:07,110
I saw her.

469
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:09,270
Around 3 p.m.,

470
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:10,380
I gave them a ride.

471
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:12,890
Where did they get off?

472
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:17,790
Here, take this.

473
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:20,190
Okay, okay. I'll take you there right away.

474
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:22,030
Would you really stand by

475
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:23,570
and watch Zhou Zhifei kill me

476
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:24,770
instead of saving me?

477
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:27,330
Really, Huizhong,

478
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:30,240
I've been trying to break free

479
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:31,930
from this devil, Zhou Zhifei.

480
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:32,880
I...

481
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:55,470
Everything I'm telling you is true.

482
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:12,400
Since I met you at 17,

483
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:16,130
you've been my spiritual mentor.

484
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:19,940
I still vividly remember

485
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:24,830
the first time I saw you.

486
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:29,460
The school bell

487
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:31,780
had just finished ringing,

488
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:35,160
and you walked up to the podium

489
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:37,130
in a long coat and black shirt.

490
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:42,070
There were patches on your elbows,

491
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,590
trousers, and even on your shoes.

492
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:50,100
You always liked to jump around

493
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:53,300
while lecturing.

494
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:56,100
The students would laugh at you in private,

495
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:58,640
calling you the beggar teacher.

496
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:00,390
But soon,

497
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,720
everyone grew to like you,

498
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:05,990
and

499
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:09,429
the idealistic glow

500
00:34:10,429 --> 00:34:12,350
you radiated.

501
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,580
Under your teaching and guidance,

502
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:19,480
I gradually came to understand the Party,

503
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:22,310
and the organization.

504
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:28,520
You were the one who taught me what faith is

505
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:30,429
and what revolution means.

506
00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:36,730
I defied my father's objections

507
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:39,929
and eloped with you without hesitation.

508
00:34:43,889 --> 00:34:45,260
All these years,

509
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:48,090
no matter how bitter or tiring it was,

510
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:51,830
I wasn't afraid,

511
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:53,670
because all my love and faith came from you.

512
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:55,429
But now you're telling me

513
00:34:57,310 --> 00:34:59,640
that you've already betrayed all of this,

514
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:02,000
betrayed the Party,

515
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:05,190
and the promises you made to me.

516
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:11,470
Hu Zhiping.

517
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:18,870
Are you even human?

518
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:22,330
I...

519
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:26,510
In 1927,

520
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:29,710
during the lowest point of the revolution,

521
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:32,650
I joined the Communist Party.

522
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:35,230
In these 14 years,

523
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:38,870
I've never done anything

524
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:40,470
to betray the organization.

525
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:45,380
Never?

526
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:48,010
Just this once.

527
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:51,670
The Garden of Pleasance operation.

528
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:54,020
I made a mistake, just this once.

529
00:35:57,830 --> 00:35:59,220
I've sacrificed

530
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:02,060
everything I could

531
00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:04,750
for the revolution.

532
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:09,630
Why should I

533
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:11,950
suffer a lifetime of torment

534
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:15,350
for one mistake?

535
00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:19,430
It's not over yet;

536
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:22,320
there's still a chance

537
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:25,020
to change everything.

538
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:26,230
Let's go.

539
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:26,950
Go?

540
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:28,810
Where are we going?

541
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:30,910
Leave Suzhou and go to Hong Kong,

542
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:33,000
away from all this turmoil,

543
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:36,870
and return to the peaceful life we once had.

544
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:40,670
I'm no longer the beggar teacher.

545
00:36:41,350 --> 00:36:42,500
We have money now.

546
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:43,870
Let's go, shall we?

547
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:45,870
A peaceful life?

548
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:50,810
You harmed my brother,

549
00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:53,410
caused my father's death,

550
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:55,330
and killed so many comrades.

551
00:36:55,330 --> 00:36:56,440
Do you really think

552
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:59,190
we can go back to the way things were?

553
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:04,140
You have only one option now:

554
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:07,590
surrender yourself to the Party.

555
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,680
Too many people have died because of me.

556
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:16,930
The Party won't spare me.

557
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:17,710
Huizhong.

558
00:37:19,390 --> 00:37:20,620
Listen to me.

559
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:22,670
Trust me.

560
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:25,060
Let's go now.

561
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:27,070
Take Junsheng,

562
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,440
and escape

563
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:30,050
to Hong Kong.

564
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:31,360
Nothing will happen.

565
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,160
Huizhong.

566
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:35,670
I know you've heard me.

567
00:37:35,770 --> 00:37:36,550
Don't come any closer.

568
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:37,520
Let me finish.

569
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:38,160
Let's go.

570
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:39,920
Don't come closer, Hu Zhiping.

571
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:41,150
Don't come over.

572
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:42,910
You won't shoot.

573
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,970
I know you love me.

574
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:46,700
You won't shoot.

575
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:48,950
Put the gun down.

576
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:49,550
Let go!

577
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:51,610
Put the gun down and listen to me.

578
00:37:51,830 --> 00:37:53,760
Drop your gun and listen to me.

579
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:21,550
This is the place.

580
00:38:23,530 --> 00:38:24,280
Thank you.

581
00:38:24,310 --> 00:38:25,240
Keep the change.

582
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:34,150
Ping.

583
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:34,950
Huizhong.

584
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:37,580
You shouldn't have done...

585
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:42,590
Huizhong!

586
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:02,560
Hu Zhiping.

587
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:05,710
I'm asking you one last time:

588
00:39:06,990 --> 00:39:09,390
the leaders of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee,

589
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:12,190
Eagle, and the New Fourth Army's liaison point

590
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:13,120
—where are they?

591
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:15,020
Tell me.

592
00:39:15,450 --> 00:39:17,160
And we'll be done.

593
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:21,270
I won't say anything else to you.

594
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:24,370
I won't provide

595
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:26,870
any more information.

596
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:29,550
Hu Zhiping,

597
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:34,920
don't be ungrateful.

598
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:38,180
She's still alive.

599
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:39,880
I need to save her.

600
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:42,180
She's still breathing.

601
00:39:56,630 --> 00:40:00,090
Embroidering mandarin ducks...

602
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:08,860
suddenly a heartless blow

603
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:18,050
separates them.

604
00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:23,760
[Minfu Alley]

605
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:34,360
[Minfu Alley]

606
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:19,430
Huizhong.

607
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:20,990
Huizhong.

608
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:22,630
I'm Yizhong.

609
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:29,470
Huizhong.

610
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:31,350
I'm Yizhong.

611
00:41:31,350 --> 00:41:32,320
Wake up.

612
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,410
I'm here, Huizhong.

613
00:41:37,390 --> 00:41:37,990
Huizhong.

614
00:41:39,870 --> 00:41:41,270
I didn't betray...

615
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:41,660
Huizhong.

616
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:42,390
The Party...

617
00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:44,390
Yizhong.

618
00:41:44,890 --> 00:41:46,750
I'm innoc...

619
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:51,830
Sister.

620
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:55,770
Is anyone there?

621
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,390
My sister needs to go to the hospital.

622
00:41:57,390 --> 00:41:57,830
Huizhong!

623
00:41:57,830 --> 00:41:58,860
Wake up, Huizhong.

624
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:00,480
♫Who am I, who do I stand for?♫

625
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,370
♫Back to back♫

626
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:04,490
♫When ideals and reality♫

627
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:06,170
♫Are at odds♫

628
00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:07,020
Huizhong.

629
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:08,830
♫Covered in wounds♫

630
00:42:07,390 --> 00:42:08,170
Huizhong.

631
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:09,950
Don't leave me behind.

632
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:12,370
♫Exhausted♫

633
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:11,020
Huizhong.

634
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:15,390
♫Is it a lost path, is it despair♫

635
00:42:15,350 --> 00:42:17,010
Is anyone there?

636
00:42:15,430 --> 00:42:17,150
♫Or the darkness of night?♫

637
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:19,150
Is anyone there?

638
00:42:17,350 --> 00:42:19,260
♫Searching in the lighthouse♫

639
00:42:19,310 --> 00:42:20,930
♫For a ray of light♫

640
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:23,410
♫A wandering heart♫

641
00:42:23,910 --> 00:42:27,650
♫Longs for comfort♫

642
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:31,190
♫Unable to shed tears♫

643
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:35,110
♫What kind of taste is this?♫

644
00:42:35,370 --> 00:42:38,140
♫Used to facing it alone♫

645
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:42,580
♫Not expecting company♫

646
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:45,600
♫The closer they are♫

647
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,700
♫The more they are your weakness♫

648
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:49,700
Director, something big has happened!

649
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:55,980
♫No one is invincible♫

650
00:42:51,550 --> 00:42:53,140
You're always so jumpy.

651
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:54,360
What's happened this time?
