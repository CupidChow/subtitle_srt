is officially a member of No. 90,

16

given to our organization before his sacrifice.

00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:07,590
that Gu Yizhong is indeed an informant for our Party.

39

Yes.

He's not guilty.

even if he were an undercover agent for the CPC,

00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:13,940
Zhou Youren.

192
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:16,940
Or should I call you Zhou Zhifei?

193
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:18,240
Your Honor,

194
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:20,050
I have some

195
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:21,390
more compelling evidence here.

196
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:22,590
We have found some original materials

197
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:23,660
from the No. 90

198
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:24,870
Suzhou Agent Station,

199
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:25,850
which include documents

200
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:27,750
signed personally by Zhou Zhifei.

201
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:28,360
Please have a look.

202
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,100
Present it.

203
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:32,870
Zhou Youren,

204
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,830
you used to be called Zhou Zhifei, didn't you?

205
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:38,800
I've had several names.

206
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,350
You were the Director at No. 90,

207
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:42,020
right?

208
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:44,320
That was many years ago.

209
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:47,500
Is this report written by you?

210
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:50,550
It contains a comprehensive and detailed account

211
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:51,830
of how Ou Xinping

212
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:53,810
and other agents were betrayed.

213
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:55,350
I don't need to read it.

214
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:56,210
It's a forgery.

215
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:59,300
Not only does it have your signature,

216
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,700
but the entire document was written by you.

217
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:04,650
It couldn't be that someone forced you to write it, could it?

218
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:06,180
The signature is a forgery.

219
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:06,900
Your Honor,

220
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:09,070
we request the next witness to be called.

221
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:09,800
Call them in.

222
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:34,320
I didn't die.

223
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:41,980
Director Zhou,

224
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:43,950
it's me.

225
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:46,380
I'm Zhang Jiping.

226
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:52,390
Don't you recognize me?

227
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:53,720
This is absurd!

228
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:54,910
Absurd!

229
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,000
Let me tell you,

230
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:00,780
I am the chief commissioner

231
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:04,720
of the Traitor-purging Committee of the National Government.

232
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:06,430
I was sent here by Mr. Dai

233
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:08,950
to assist in eliminating traitors.

234
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:09,750
Jin Jichang!

235
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:11,680
Make a quick decision

236
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:13,200
and eliminate the traitor!

237
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:13,930
Hurry up!

238
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:23,990
We are going to eliminate the traitor.

239
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:28,330
We aim to eliminate the real traitor, Zhou Zhifei.

240
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:34,510
How dare you?

241
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:38,470
Take him down!

242
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:45,290
I will report this to Nanjing.

243
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:47,180
I will have Mr. Dai

244
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:49,310
send troops here immediately!

245
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:51,740
Nothing that happens in this court today

246
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,030
will count!

247
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:54,070
Take him down!

248
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:55,280
How dare you!

249
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,440
What are you doing? Let go of me!

250
00:13:58,630 --> 00:13:59,350
Let go!

251
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:00,950
Jin Jichang!

252
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:02,790
How dare you!

253
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:03,710
Take him away!

254
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:06,380
Let go!

255
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,520
What are you doing?

256
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,920
I'm going to call Mr. Dai.

257
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:38,170
[Jiangsu High Court]

258
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:49,990
What?

259
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:52,960
You've been in there so long

260
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:56,560
that you're not used to the outside world?

261
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:58,830
I'm used to it.

262
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:02,710
I'm so used to it.

263
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:11,210
You shouldn't come here often.

264
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:14,470
Youfei

265
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:17,330
came back from Japan two days ago.

266
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:19,310
I said I was bringing him to see you.

267
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:21,230
Why didn't you let him come?

268
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:26,120
What's the point of coming to a place like this?

269
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,310
It's filthy.

270
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,470
Don't worry.

271
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:32,210
I'll be out in a couple of days.

272
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:36,470
Zhou.

273
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,550
It's okay. Just say it.

274
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:41,630
He's one of us.

275
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:46,710
Is Mr. Dai not protecting you anymore?

276
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:51,390
Nothing is final until the very end.

277
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:52,630
Let me tell you,

278
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:59,750
Xu Enzeng is to blame.

279
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:04,860
Didn't he send me a letter a few years ago,

280
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:07,280
hoping I'd return to the CBIS?

281
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:08,950
I ignored him.

282
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,830
Later, when I left No. 90,

283
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:14,870
Xu Enzeng thought I'd definitely go back to the CBIS.

284
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:15,990
But he didn't expect

285
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:18,450
that I'd join forces with Mr. Dai of the NBIS.

286
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:20,330
You don't understand.

287
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:21,860
The CBIS and the NBIS

288
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:23,850
have always been sworn enemies,

289
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:25,790
like ice and fire—completely incompatible.

290
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:26,910
This Xu

291
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:28,990
has really made an enemy out of me.

292
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:33,070
It was Xu Enzeng

293
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:34,990
who went to Mr. Lifu

294
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:35,930
and accused me,

295
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:37,980
leading to what happened in court.

296
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:43,190
Xu Enzeng holds grudges like that?

297
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:44,190
Of course.

298
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:47,350
Xu Enzeng claims to have

299
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:50,110
a master's degree from CMU in the U.S.,

300
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:51,110
but in fact,

301
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:52,790
he's just a petty man.

302
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:55,390
Well,

303
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:57,610
wait outside for a minute.

304
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:02,950
Zhou.

305
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:05,230
I need you to find someone for me.

306
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:07,609
Do you remember a man

307
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:09,180
named Jiang Boxian?

308
00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:10,349
Yes.

309
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,540
His wife once gave me gold bars.

310
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:13,869
This Jiang Boxian

311
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:15,849
is extremely capable.

312
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:18,829
First, he's said

313
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:21,430
to be a distant relative of Chiang.

314
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:22,470
Second,

315
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:24,810
he has very good relationships

316
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:26,349
with both Xu Enzeng and Dai Li.

317
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:28,510
Oh, right. He is now in Suzhou,

318
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:31,230
living in Crane Garden, which belonged to Mr. Li.

319
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:33,550
He likes money.

320
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:36,030
Give him a little something for me

321
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:38,070
and ask him to apologize to Xu Enzeng

322
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:39,510
on my behalf.

323
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:40,550
That way,

324
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:43,000
Mr. Dai can easily go along with it

325
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:43,870
and get me released.

326
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:44,950
Okay, Zhou.

327
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,630
I know what to do.

328
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:50,430
Ji,

329
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:54,390
there's something

330
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:56,720
I don't think I've ever said to you before.

331
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,430
I love you.

332
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:07,830
Go back.

333
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:12,310
Zhou,

334
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,350
I heard what you just said.

335
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:02,350
Mr. Jiang.

336
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,910
Zhifei's request is not easy to handle.

337
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:16,630
Mr. Jiang,

338
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:19,110
our entire family

339
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,840
is relying on you.

340
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:29,430
All our possessions are here.

341
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:32,830
I only ask you

342
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:36,030
to save Old Zhou's life.

343
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:36,710
Wait.

344
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:41,630
This thing you're wearing is our family heirloom.

345
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:43,510
It's from the palace.

346
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:45,860
Yes.

347
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:48,070
Yes.

348
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:53,630
It was a gift from Mrs. Jiang back then.

349
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:56,630
Ever since Zhou was imprisoned,

350
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,710
I've lost weight,

351
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:01,590
and it no longer fits me.

352
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:07,230
Please help me

353
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:09,950
thank Mrs. Jiang.

354
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:15,150
Look at this hand.

355
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:20,960
These little things...

356
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:24,830
I hope

357
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:29,190
Mrs. Jiang finds them to her liking.

358
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:38,030
Please make sure

359
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:40,350
to put in a good word for Zhou

360
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:43,270
in front of Mr. Dai.

361
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:46,670
Unfortunately,

362
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:51,190
Dai Li's plane crashed into Daishan in Nanjing

363
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,110
the day before yesterday.

364
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,350
He's dead.

365
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:02,920
A crash?

366
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:08,720
Mr. Yunong has passed away?

367
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,790
It's in the newspapers today.

368
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:27,200
Yunong!

369
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,710
Zhou, do we have any other options?

370
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:58,760
[Keep quiet] [Keep quiet]

371
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,990
All rise.

372
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:00,600
Zhou Zhifei, the criminal,

373
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:03,340
conspired with an enemy nation

374
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:05,160
to rebel against his own country.

375
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,950
He is sentenced to death,

376
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,450
stripped of his civil rights for life,

377
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:11,880
and all his assets

378
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:13,570
are to be confiscated.

379

I'll go to Nanjing.

386

I'll kneel at Mr. Chen Lifu's door.

We won't accept this verdict.

388
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:39,350
We will appeal to the end.

389
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:40,950
I've already hired a lawyer.

390
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,610
Didn't you say Director Ye...

391
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:44,190
-Ji.
-You know him, right?

392

Don't.

00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:52,110

396

397
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:57,910
Didn't I ask you to bring him?

Is he here?

399
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:10,800
Alright.

400
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,590
I'll go get him.

401
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:25,710
Go in there and see your father.

402
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:28,510
See your father.

403
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:47,740
Lift your head.

00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:00,450
Dad won't be around in the future.

409
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:04,030

00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:51,430
Never, in this life, do anything to betray your country.

421

You sent a note saying you wanted to see me.

426
00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:39,010
It's been five years.

427
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:40,790
It's time

428
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:43,390
to settle the grudge between us today.

429
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:46,720
I've been waiting for this day for a long time.

430
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:51,110
Fate truly plays tricks on people.

431
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,190
Just a few days ago,

432
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:56,230
I came to this very cell

433
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:58,470
in this Zhong prison to see you.

434
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:02,650
Who would have thought that now, the roles would be reversed,

435
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:07,510
and I'd end up being the one condemned to death for treason and colluding with the enemy.

436
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:10,580
You know what?

437
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,330
The two words "being flexible"

438
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:16,180
have led you to this end.

439
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:17,500
I don't think so.

440
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:20,230

00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:24,440
I wouldn't be here.

443

One can't defeat their fate.

444
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:30,970
You really are incorrigible.

445
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,390

446
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:38,070
I taught you this trick

447
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,120
back in the agent program.

448
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,720
And now you use it against me.

449
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:43,030

450
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:46,200

00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:00,610
Go ahead, shoot me.

456
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:02,460
Shoot me dead.

457
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:05,260
I asked you here today

458
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:08,310
because I want you to end me with your own hands.

459
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,070
I, Zhou Zhifei,

460
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,110
don't want to die

461

at the hands of some nobodies.

462
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:17,340
Dying by your gun feels worth it.

463
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:17,880
Come on.

464
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:32,740
I'm different from you.

465
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:36,750
Instead of settling a personal grudge with a single shot,

466
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:37,790
the people's bullets

467
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:39,520
and the public trial of history

468
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:43,170
have far greater significance in serving as a warning.

469
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:48,490
As an agent,

470
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:51,560
you have to be ruthless.

471
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:54,810
That's something you still haven't learned from me.

472
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:57,120
I really want to ask you a question.

473
00:29:57,510 --> 00:30:00,640
I've been lying in this bed of yours for the past two days.

474
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:04,390
At night, they turn off the lights.

475
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:06,320
When the lights go out, I get scared

476
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:09,550
and feel like I'm falling into a dark,

477
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,250
bottomless pit,

478
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:14,980
falling deeper and deeper,

479
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:16,960
never reaching the bottom.

480
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:22,880
I'm so frightened.

481
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:26,490
Gu Yizhong,

482
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:29,040
how did you manage

483
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:32,590
to bear the name of a traitor for five years,

484
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:34,790

485

and with your family destroyed,

486
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:39,830
and still make it to today?

487
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:52,070
Mr. Sicheng once said:

488
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:55,150
"Arches above become beams,

489
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:57,290
arches below become columns.

490
00:30:58,510 --> 00:31:00,310
Beams and columns are straight,

491
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:01,810
but arches are curved.

492
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:05,240
Curves and straight lines alternate,

493
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:08,360
so the strength is boundless."

494
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:17,150
I see.

495
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:21,390
You used curves against straight lines

496
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:24,430
and outplayed my "being flexible."

497
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:26,680
Zhou Zhifei, you are wrong.

498
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:27,790
It was faith.

499
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:30,390
To live in this world,

500
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:31,790
one must have some faith.

501
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:35,520
But you have lost these things.

502

00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,710
Why haven't the people from the Taihu Lake

568
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:32,870
contacted you yet?

569
00:38:34,370 --> 00:38:36,100
They've all moved to Shandong.

570
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,450
You've been left behind again?

571
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:40,340
No.

572
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:42,200
Division Commander Luo said

573
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,720
he would send someone to contact me soon

574
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:45,520
and take me to the Shandong base.

575

Junsheng.

576
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:48,790
Junsheng, come here.

577
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:52,880
Junsheng,

578
00:38:53,050 --> 00:38:54,510
why are your shoes on the wrong feet again?

579
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:56,800
It was Uncle who put them on for me.

580
00:38:58,070 --> 00:39:00,110
Can you be more concerned about the child?

581
00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:01,030
To me,

582
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:04,950
raising a child is harder than restoring ancient buildings.

583
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:07,470
I told you to keep Miss Haimo,

584
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:08,670
but you didn't.

585
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:10,790
Now you regret it, don't you?

586
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:12,270
Do you miss her?

587
00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:15,070
Let me tell you,

588
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:17,450
you won't find another girl like Haimo

589
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:18,980
anywhere in the world.

590
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,960
Her name is Lin Shujuan.

591
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:22,380
I don't care what her name is.

592
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:24,040
You shouldn't have let her go.

593
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,550
You've lived together for five years.

594
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:27,950
How can you have no feelings for each other?

595
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:29,790
You were afraid to express

596
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:30,920
your true feelings.

597
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:31,800
Hypocritical.

Sir,

among the famous lines of poetry about Suzhou,

610
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:50,670
I like the Song poet Yang Wanli's

611
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:54,520
"Do not blame the lone boat for drifting aimlessly;

612
00:41:55,230 --> 00:41:58,270
my very self is but a wandering vessel."

613
00:42:06,450 --> 00:42:08,190
I prefer Du Fu's

614
00:42:09,790 --> 00:42:12,320
"I am a lonely boat yearning for my hometown."
