192
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:48,020
You're welcome.

193
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:48,950
Go close the door.

194
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:49,470
Okay.

195
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:50,870
Let me do it.

196
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:51,630
No need.

197
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:52,710
Come on, this room.

198
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:54,270
Thank you.

199
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:58,690
Here we are.

200
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:05,770
Easy, easy.

201
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:19,270
Who are you?

202
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:20,960
What do you want?

203
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:26,430
I want to see Division Commander Luo, Luo Wuqiang.

204
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:27,160
Impossible.

205
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:29,470
Chief of Staff Chen said

206
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:31,820
you had important information.

207
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,970
I won't say anything

208
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:35,750
until I see him.

209
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:38,150
The troops have just moved.

210
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:39,190
Moved to where?

211
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:39,990
I don't know.

212
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:43,420
I won't tell you, even if I know.

213
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:45,850
If you have anything to report,

214
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:49,190
I can help you pass it on to Division Commander Luo.

215
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:51,870
You guessed correctly.

216
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:54,350
I'm the Regimental Chief of Staff for the 16th Brigade of the 6th Division.

217
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:56,550
I was injured in battle last month

218
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:58,550
and fell into the clutches of the puppet army.

219
00:13:58,550 --> 00:13:59,750
No matter who you are,

220
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,120
thank you for saving me.

221
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:09,720
Chief of Staff Chen, how long will it take you to find the troops?

222
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,490
Captain Jiang knows

223
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,380
the locations of troop shelters.

224
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:14,600
In one or two days,

225
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:17,960
I should be able to catch up with Division Commander Luo's troops.

226
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,220
Do you have any papers?

227
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:25,470
Is this okay?

228
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:41,110
Mrs. Gu.

229
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:43,710
Mrs. Gu.

230
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,630
We don't have anything fancy here in the countryside.

231
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:49,300
I've made some sweet boiled eggs for you.

232
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,360
Thank you, Mrs. Lu.

233
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,620
Don't say that.

234
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:54,510
We can't have you here,

235
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:55,430
even if we want to.

236
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:57,240
It's our honor to have you here.

237
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,860
Why isn't Mr. Gu here?

238
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:02,350
He...

239
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,340
He'll be here in a couple of days.

240
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:08,010
He has something urgent to deal with.

241
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:09,120
That's good.

242
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:10,660
When Mr. Gu comes,

243
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,420
your family will be reunited.

244
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:14,230
Eat it while it's hot.

245
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:19,830
[To the New Fourth Army: send troops as soon as you receive the letter]

246
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:27,390
[Xiao Ruo...]

247
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:32,610
[Xiao Ruotong's friend]

248
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:37,920
This is urgent.

249
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:39,200
I'm counting on you.

250
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:40,670
I'll go to the troop now.

251
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:42,970
You can rest here tonight

252
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,390
and go back to Suzhou tomorrow morning.

253
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:44,990
No.

254
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:46,640
I have to leave tonight.

255
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,530
See you,

256
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:49,290
Comrade Gu.

257
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:53,550
Comrade Chen.

258
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:02,630
Comrade Gu, I'll only see you off here.

259
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:03,670
Follow this road,

260
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:04,960
and you'll reach the main road soon.

261
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,000
Follow the main road,

262
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,110
and you will arrive in Suzhou shortly.

263
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:09,110
Take this.

264
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:13,430
Take care.

265
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:50,510
Forward to Captain Zhang, Zhang Jiping,

266
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:53,670
at the Political Security Bureau, Suzhou Branch.

267
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,980
Deputy Chief Xie,

268
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,800
why are you pointing a gun at me

269
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:27,670
in the early morning?

270
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:29,000
Your lantern

271
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:30,600
has run out of kerosene,

272
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:34,990
and your shoes are caked with thick black mud.

273
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:38,150
You must have done

274
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:41,190
a lot of walking last night, didn't you?

275
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:42,970
Yeah.

276
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:45,470
I was pleasantly surprised by the beautiful scenery

277
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:46,530
outside of Suzhou.

278
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:49,130
Don't point your gun at me.

279
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:51,510
Deputy Chief Xie,

280
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:53,910
have you heard of the verse

281
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:56,030
"The night fair's bright as day;

282
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:58,330
Outside temples boats stay" by Du Xunhe?

283
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:01,630
I don't read much.

284
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:05,560
I only know, "Beyond the city wall, from the Temple of Hanshan;

285
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:09,160
Bells break the ship-borne roamer's dream and midnight still."

286
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,160
That's a good line as well.

287
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:14,910
There are so many good poems praising Suzhou.

288
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:16,210
Unfortunately,

289
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,310
people at this time

290
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:20,870
don't know how to appreciate it.

291
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:21,950
You're right.

292
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:23,240
I just wonder

293
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:25,300
if that ship that arrived here last night

294
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,910
filled with Messrs. Si?

295
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:28,490
Yes, all Messrs. Si

296
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:30,470
armed with Mauser rifles.

297
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:31,650
Straightforward.

298
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:34,270
Looks like you don't even bother to hide the fact

299
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:35,510
that you're colluding with and sponsoring the CPC.

300
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:37,430
Chief Wan kept telling me

301
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:39,190
to watch out for you.

302
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:40,950
It seems

303
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:42,990
that you sent the New Fourth Army officers

304
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:45,720
to the other side of Taihu Lake last night, right?

305
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:48,290
You're not stupid.

306
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,720
Now that you've admitted it.

307
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,520
Take him down.

308
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:51,270
Wait!

309
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:55,030
Deputy Chief Xie,

310
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:59,110
you're not very educated and don't read newspapers,

311
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,720
but you don't listen to the radio either?

312
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:04,390
Haven't you heard of the Potsdam Proclamation?

313
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:06,770
The Japanese Emperor is about to surrender.

314
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:08,430
Don't you want to leave yourself a way out?

315
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:09,090
I know that.

316
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:11,350
Even if the Japanese Emperor surrenders

317
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:12,390
and Japan loses,

318
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:14,390
it's not the turn of those Communist scoundrels

319
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:15,870
to take over Suzhou.

320
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,700
This city still belongs to our Kuomintang.

321
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:19,990
Kuomintang?

322
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:22,670
You mean the Kuomintang in Chongqing, right?

323
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:23,790
Don't forget,

324
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:25,520
you work for Wang Jingwei.

325
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:27,350
You're not on the same team with them.

326
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:28,510
In the end,

327
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:30,390
you're still a traitor.

328
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:33,290
Mr. Gu, you're indeed knowledgeable.

329
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:36,350
You're so upright, even when you're colluding with the CPC.

330
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:37,110
Come back to No. 90 with me

331
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,110
and get tortured!

332
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:39,830
Take him away!

333
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,500
Deputy Chief Xie,

334
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:48,590
how about I give you one more credit?

335
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:51,160
There's a radio in the back.

336
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:52,350
Open the back lid.

337
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:07,200
[Letter of Appointment]

338
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:08,390
We hereby appoint Gu Yizhong

339
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:12,390
as the General Officer-in-Charge of the Suzhou Special Region of NBIS.

340
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:13,230
Dai Li.

341
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:16,070
Did you see it clearly?

342
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:17,200
That's impossible.

343
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:18,990
You must have forged it.

344
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,120
Deputy Chief Xie,

345
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:24,250
in this situation,

346
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:26,130
both Zhou Fohai and Wan Lilang

347
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,200
have been trying everything

348
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,510
to reach Mr. Dai.

349
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:30,750
What's this for?

350
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:32,550
It's for

351
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:34,030
not getting shot for being traitors

352
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:35,350
after the war.

353
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:38,870
Now, behave yourself and follow me.

354
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:40,270
When Suzhou is restored,

355
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,840
I'll tell Mr. Dai

356
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:43,270
that you were

357
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:46,350
an underground worker for the Chongqing Kuomintang

358
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:47,410
to spare your life.

359
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:52,790
Chief Gu,

360
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:56,390
you're following Chongqing Kuomintang's orders

361
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:57,650
while helping the CPC.

362
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:00,230
Which side are you on?

363
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:04,870
What do you think?

364
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:20,470
Go in.

365
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:46,170
Which one of you is the leader?

366
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,200
I know you don't trust me.

367
00:22:58,430 --> 00:22:59,510
But listen to me.

368
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:01,350
Japan has been defeated.

369
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:04,350
Don't die in their prison

370
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:06,070
before the dawn of victory.

371
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:10,510
You're all in the New Fourth Army soldiers, right?

372
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:11,590
I'll lead you out.

373
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:14,190
Time is running out.

374
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,400
Who is the leader?

375
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:35,810
Are you sure about this?

376
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:37,410
Yes, I saw it with my own eyes.

Chief Gu has been arrested.

379
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:43,190
That's impossible.

380
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:44,580
Who would have the nerve?

381
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:45,730
Deputy Chief Xie caught him.

382
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:46,300
I heard

383
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,790
that Chief Gu was with Chongqing's Kuomintang.

384
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:50,450
That's even more impossible.

385
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:53,150

386
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:54,910
Mr. Dai signed it himself.

387
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:57,400
Deputy Chief Xie has put him in jail.

388
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,870
But he's worried that the letter is true,

389
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:00,850
so he's calling Nanjing

390
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,480
to ask Chief Wan.

391
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:04,150
Captain, didn't you say

392
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:05,670
Gu Yizhong has something to do with Mr. Si?

393
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:07,270

394

565
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:22,950
Thank you, Gu,

566
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:24,990
for coming to see me at this time.

567
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:31,430
I thought it must be something very important.

568
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:33,770
I've contacted the New Fourth Army.

569
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:36,750
They will come and take over Suzhou.

570
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:39,470
That's not what I want to say.

571
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:44,430
Here, have some tea.

572
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:52,210
I'm afraid I won't be able to enjoy

573
00:31:52,390 --> 00:31:54,120
next year's fresh Longjing tea

574
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:56,560
before Tomb-Sweeping Day.

575
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:02,230
It must be quite lively outside now.

576
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:07,750
Suzhou people only do this on Chinese New Year's Eve.

577
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:12,980
[We don't know whether we're crazy or stupid] [All we can do is move forward]

578
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:13,310
I really like Suzhou.

579
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:15,400
Unfortunately, my wish...

580
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:19,070
The people of Amaterasu

581
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:22,160
can't live in Suzhou anymore.

582
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:26,270
I'm sorry about that.

583
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:28,990
You Japanese should live

584
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:30,030
on your own land.

585
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:35,200
Do you know?

586
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:38,470
I always thought that Zhou Zhifei was my enemy,

587
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:40,790
but actually, you're

588
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:42,830
my real opponent.

589
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:47,870
Although you and I are on different sides,

590
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:49,550
I respect you very much.

591
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:51,950
Because you and I

592
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,750
are people of faith.

593
00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:01,790
Japan lost this war.

594
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:09,230
However,

595
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:12,070
as a soldier,

596
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,130
I must be responsible for this.

597
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:28,510
Mr. Gu,

598
00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:33,240
please be my kaishakunin.

599
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:41,530
You want me to behead you

600
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,300
after you disembowel yourself?

601
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:47,470
The Commander-in-Chief of the Kuomintang

602
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:49,600
Military Commission's Special Operations for Suzhou

603
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,570
is here!

604
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:56,590
Major!

605
00:35:58,250 --> 00:35:59,260
What happened?

606
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:01,650
Zhou Zhifei!

607
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:03,240
I'm Zhou Youren.

608
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:04,550
Zhou Zhifei

609
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:06,830
is the alias I used

610
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:09,100
while I was an undercover at No. 90.

611
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,530
Sir, don't do this.

612
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:13,390
Let me help you.

613
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,680
You don't need to do this.

614
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:22,460
Why kill yourself?

615
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:27,420
You really joined the NBIS.

616
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:31,450
It's all thanks to Mr. Dai's magnanimity

617
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:32,730
and open-mindedness,

618
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:36,750
taking in all the heroes of the world.

619
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:39,690
Why didn't he choose you?

620
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:41,320
It's true to say

621
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:45,040
that you're a lackey who has served three masters.

622
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:47,620
This is the "go with the flow"

623
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:50,010
that I've been telling you about before.

624
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:01,120
What are you doing here?

625
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:02,890
I see.

626
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:07,830
You want to sacrifice your life for your Emperor

627
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:11,320
and gain posthumous fame as a martyred samurai.

628
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,220
And you want Gu Yizhong to be your kaishakunin.

629
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:18,230
Why didn't you help him?

630
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:20,940
Pick up the knife.

631
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:22,450
With a swift swing,

632
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:23,670
chop off his head

633
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:26,380
to avenge your father and sister.

634
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:28,690
Come on.

635
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:30,030
Go on.

636
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:31,930
Finish him.

637
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:33,190
Take it.

638
00:37:35,830 --> 00:37:36,980
Hurry up.

639
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:40,550
Gu Yizhong,

640
00:37:41,870 --> 00:37:44,110
you are a scholar after all.

641
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:45,270
Come on.

642
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:47,310
Major,

643
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:49,190
since we've been a part of each other's lives for a while,

644
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:50,390
let me help you.

645
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,120
I was just joking.

646
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:05,320
I won't let him die like that so easily.

647
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:06,420
Guards!

648
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:09,090
Take the Jap away

649
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:10,300
and send him to the prisoner-of-war camp

650
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:12,430
to await the Military Commission's verdict!

651
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:13,070
Yes!

652
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:22,400
Zhou Zhifei!

653
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,720
You bastard!

654
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:28,630
I won't stoop down

655
00:38:29,530 --> 00:38:30,770
to kill him.

656
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:34,650
Yizhong,

657
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:36,880
we meet again.

658
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:47,510
I, as the commander of the Suzhou Special Operations Group

659
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:49,290
appointed by Mr. Dai

660
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:52,530
from the Military Commission,

661
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:54,160
am here to reclaim Suzhou.

662
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:56,650
I didn't expect my first case to be about you.

663
00:38:57,270 --> 00:38:59,150
You're a traitor.

664
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:01,330
Surprised, right?

665
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:05,150
You traitor!

666
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,720
If you had any dignity,

667
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:10,180
you wouldn't dare stand here and talk to me.

668
00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:12,510
How about this?

669
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:15,950
Let's see if the people of Suzhou

670
00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:17,940
will eat you raw

671
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:19,830
if we throw you out on the street?

672
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,340
The one that the people of Suzhou want to eat raw is you.

673
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:24,190
No. No.

674
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:25,500
You must think

675
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:27,840
I'm a traitor as well, right?

676
00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:30,310
"Infiltration,"

677
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:31,310
remember?

678
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,830
I was a traitor sent by the NBIS

679
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:37,370
to infiltrate No. 90.

680
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:38,630
And you?

681
00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:41,730
Are you going to tell me

682
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:43,250
it was the New Fourth Army

683
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:44,510
or the Communist Party

684
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:46,270
that asked you to infiltrate No. 90?

685
00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:47,910
Didn't you say you weren't?

686
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:53,990
I don't have time to listen to your nonsense.

687
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:54,990
I'm going home.

688
00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:56,990
Stop!

689
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,160
Gu Yizhong.

690
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:01,670

Sir,

729

it's Yu Bailu from the Civil Affairs Bureau of Jiangsu Provincial under the Wang Regime.
