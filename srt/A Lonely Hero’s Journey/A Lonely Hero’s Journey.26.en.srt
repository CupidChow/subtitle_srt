Do I look like—

193
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:35,670
You don't know

194
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:38,080
how horrible Kondo has been

195
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:40,190
recently.

196
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:42,670
He's always arbitrary.

197
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:43,470
Gu Yizhong is—

198
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:44,360
Zhifei.

199
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:47,770
Do you know

200
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:51,450
something big happened recently?

201
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,080
Are you talking about No. 90?

202
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:58,590
The Japanese Navy

203
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:00,270
attacked the base camp

204
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:02,670
of the US Pacific fleet,

205
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,620
Pearl Harbor.

206
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:06,790
You mean this?

207
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:08,520
I heard it on the radio that day.

208
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,220
These Japanese...

209
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:12,680
I underestimated them.

210
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:14,670
I didn't expect them to be so powerful.

211
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:16,400
They severely hurt the US Navy.

212
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:17,960
In this way,

213
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:20,630
the Japanese in Suzhou will be more arrogant.

214
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:23,780
What do you think

215
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:25,870
about this matter?

216
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:30,190
First,

217
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:32,220
I didn't expect

218
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:35,050
that the US isn't that powerful.

219
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:36,740
Second,

220
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,260
in this way,

221
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:41,510
Japan will probably become

222
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:43,190
a new hegemon

223
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:45,630
in the future international system

224
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:47,530
and be parallel to Germany.

225
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:48,540
So,

226
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:50,180
our decision

227
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:52,200
with the Wang government was correct.

228
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,100
What decision?

229
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,890
Leaving Chongqing.

230
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:56,700
In the future,

231
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:59,470
the Wang government will be the only one in China.

232
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:00,930
Take a guess.

233
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:04,020
How will Chongqing

234
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:06,350
and Mr. Chiang feel

235
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:08,480
after knowing about this?

236
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,670
I haven't paid attention to

237
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,890
what Chiang is up to.

238
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:12,790
Let me tell you.

239
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:14,920
A few days ago,

240
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:20,360
Lin Sen from Chongqing

241
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,790
represented the National Government

242
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:24,860
and officially declared war

243
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:26,740
on the Axis Powers

244
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:28,210
of Japan, Germany,

245
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:32,430
and Italy.

246
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,590
Why do I feel that Chongqing

247
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:41,320
has been fighting against Japan all these years?

248
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:44,500
It just happened.

249
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:48,710
They just officially declared war.

250
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:52,650
I understand.

251
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:56,460
The US can't beat Japan.

252
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:58,590
They hope Chiang can help them.

253
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:00,430
You still don't understand.

254
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,880
The Japanese are doomed.

255
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:09,290
Back when Mr. Chiang was in Shanghai,

256
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:11,430
he bet all the chips he had

257
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:12,990
in his hand.

258
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:14,020
Why?

259
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:18,770
It was so the US and Great Britain

260
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:19,920
could see

261
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:24,320
that China is capable of fighting.

262
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,070
He wanted to get them involved

263
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:27,940
and use their power

264
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:30,230
to send the Japanese back to their island.

265
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:31,560
Did the Americans come?

266
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:34,420
Now, the Americans

267
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:36,430
are really here.

268
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:42,970
Comrade Xiao really looks like a lady

269
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:44,530
in this qipao.

270
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:46,910
I haven't worn a qipao in a long time.

271
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:48,210
I'm not used to it.

272
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:51,230
It's just that your face

273
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:53,030
is too tan.

274
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:54,550
When can you recover?

275
00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:57,750
To recover...

276
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,070
Section Chief Wang,

277
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:00,970
if I stayed in my room for a week,

278
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:02,560
I should probably recover.

279
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:05,910
We don't have that much time.

280
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:06,590
Five days.

281
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:08,710
Five days?

282
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,110
Five days is fine.

283
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:12,520
As long as I can participate in the mission,

284
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,260
I can just apply some powder.

285
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:20,480
Let me tell you one more thing.

286
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:23,010
Chairman Wang.

287
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,960
Representing the Nanjing government,

288
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:31,130
he officially declared war

289
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:34,240
on the US

290
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:36,820
and Mr. Chiang's Chongqing.

291
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:38,990
But guess how the Japanese

292
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:40,230
answered him?

293
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:45,580
The Japanese basically said

294
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:46,810
that we...

295
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:51,130
aren't qualified.

296
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:52,850
I can understand that.

297
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,330
The Wang government

298
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:57,600
has no military strength.

299
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:01,070
So, Mr. Li,

300
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:02,550
I understand now.

301
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:05,109
You said

302
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:08,740
to take Luo Wuqiang's troops under your command

303
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,819
and we need to build our armed forces.

304
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:12,260
You've been waiting for this day.

305
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:13,720
Who will win in the future?

306
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,170
It's uncertain.

307
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,640
But we must have guns.

308
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:21,410
With guns and manpower,

309
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,740
no matter what happens in the future,

310
00:17:23,859 --> 00:17:25,300
we can have a seat

311
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:27,510
at the table.

312
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:29,970
I came to Suzhou

313
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,980
not to hear about this or that

314
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,440
from No. 90.

315
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:35,270
They're all trivial matters.

316
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,550
Luo Wuqiang.

317
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:40,990
He

318
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,960
is the target of this operation.

319
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:46,150
Commander of the Peace Army's 33rd Independent Division,

320
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:46,910
Luo Wuqiang.

321
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:50,030
This is yours and Junxia's citizen IDs

322
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:52,310
and your new identities.

323
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:52,000
[Citizen ID]

324
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:54,900
[Name: Lu Junnuo]

325
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,250
Sneak back to Shanghai

326
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:59,360
and enter the 33rd Independent Division of the Peace Army.

327
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,350
Your mission

328
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:02,830
is to interact with as many soldiers as possible

329
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:05,090
and try to get Luo Wuqiang to our side.

330
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:05,490
[Name: Zhu Yuqing]

331
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,350
Bring Luo Wuqiang

332
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:09,310
into the team of the Anti-Japanese National United Front.

333
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:10,420
In this case,

334
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:12,790
do I need to eliminate all the communist forces

335
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:14,150
in Suzhou

336
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:15,200
as soon as possible?

337
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,130
You're wrong again.

338
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:17,670
Not only can we not

339
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:18,940
eliminate them all,

340
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,510
but our priority now

341
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:22,190
is also to unite

342
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:25,160
every force

343
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:28,610
that can be united in Suzhou.

344
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:31,770
I'm exhausted.

345
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:34,740
Put them upstairs.

346
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:37,480
Where are the slippers? Give me the slippers.

347
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:40,360
Lyuzhu.

348
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:41,320
Don't lose them.

349
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:46,770
[Movie star, Lyuzhu]

350
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,870
Suzhou's Daimaru Department Store

351
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:48,070
is nothing compared

352
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:49,540
to the Shanghai New World.

353
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:51,910
These shoes are so expensive and stiff.

354
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,900
I won't wear them anymore.

355
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:58,720
Let me show you something nice.

356
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:00,070
Is it pretty?

357
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,670
Yes.

358
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:04,370
It's the only one in Suzhou

359
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,550
It's just a little small.

360
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:07,760
This is too small?

361
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:10,720
When we go back to Shanghai,

362
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:12,640
go find a Jewish artisan

363
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:14,920
and customize one with a bigger jewel.

364
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:17,510
I went to buy fur clothing today,

365
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:18,430
but they said they're out.

366
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:19,510
They told me to wait.

367
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:21,050
Why should I wait?

368
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:22,350
I asked them who bought it,

369
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:23,680
but they didn't tell me.

370
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:25,640
Lyuzhu.

371
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:27,300
This is

This is Miss Lyuzhu,

377
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:39,160
Nice to meet you.

378
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:41,990
-Hello.
-You're the...

379
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:45,230
The man from Suzhou that you kept calling

380
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,920
late at night?

381
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:50,310
Alright.

382
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:52,400
We're discussing work.

bring her to Shanghai to buy foreign goods.

She has been nagging me for a long time.

00:29:58,670 --> 00:29:59,350
I thought

590
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:00,870
that if there's nothing going on this weekend,

591
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:02,460
I'll take her to Shanghai,

592
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:03,680

about these small things in the future.

00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:44,130
you have to pay heed to it.

Otherwise,

00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:46,710
they might nag your ears off

00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:55,860
No, no.

00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:40,870
He's so stingy.

762
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:42,310
Yes,

763
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:44,840
but I'm already satisfied.

764
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:05,940
Tomorrow is Father's death anniversary.

765
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:07,480
I've prepared some offerings.

766
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,140
What else do you think we need?

767
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:13,390
Yizhong?

768
00:37:14,350 --> 00:37:14,990
Yizhong?

769
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:22,620
Tomorrow is Father's death anniversary.

770
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:28,690
You can arrange it.

771
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:31,250
I trust whatever you arrange.

772
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:35,040
Got it.

773
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:42,280
I won't ask anything I shouldn't know.

774
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:43,670
I'm not interested

775
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,220
in your stupid things.

776
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:52,630
Director,

777
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:57,110
this is an express delivery from Shanghai.

778
00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:24,110
Something is wrong with this photo.

779
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:40,990
Look.

780
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:42,910
This backside.

781
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:45,110
Does it seem familiar?

782
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:48,910
It's your old friend.

783
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:51,990
Give it to me.

784
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:17,190
Here.

785
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:23,450
What's with this?

786
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:26,190
Why has your father

787
00:39:26,270 --> 00:39:27,530
still not been buried?

788
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:29,230
Mr. Kondo,

789
00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:32,200
the Gu family has many customs.

790
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:34,710
Burials can't be done unless it's an auspicious day.

791
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:36,910
Burials must also be in a place with good feng shui.

792
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:38,970
It's been like this for generations.

793
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:40,240
I can't let it go awry

794
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:41,740
in my generation.

795
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:44,550
I heard that Master Gu left a will

796
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:48,190
that he can only be buried after we, the Japanese,

797
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:49,810
leave Suzhou.

798
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:54,100
The Chinese need to rest in peace.

799
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:55,590
Of course, I also hope

800
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:57,190
my father can be buried soon.

801
00:39:58,510 --> 00:39:59,590
But we've hired

802
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:01,280
many feng shui masters.

803
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:02,550
They all said we must continue to

804
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:04,480
choose a date, time, and location.

805
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:06,510
Once everything is set,

806
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:07,770
he will soon be buried.

807
00:40:07,830 --> 00:40:09,830
But I hope you understand that since

808
00:40:09,830 --> 00:40:11,150
the Empire of Japan

809
00:40:11,270 --> 00:40:12,750
has occupied Suzhou,

810
00:40:13,270 --> 00:40:14,680
we will never give it up.

811
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:17,270
Suzhou is our Kyoto in China.

812
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:19,330
Do you understand?

813
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:41,670
Why?

814
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,570
We have lived in Suzhou

815
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:45,030
for 2,500 years.

816
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:47,650
The Japanese are too domineering.

817
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:48,410
Stop it.

818
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:54,590
Are you addicted to being a traitor?

819
00:40:54,590 --> 00:40:55,830
You are so timid.

820
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:03,500
Mrs. Wang.

821
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:05,900
Young Master.

822
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:07,280
Where did you get this?

823
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:10,190
It's a gift from the new neighbors across the street.

824
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:11,550
I didn't have time to open it

825
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:12,480
to see what it is.

826
00:41:21,310 --> 00:41:22,190
Rice balls?

827
00:41:22,990 --> 00:41:24,370
I said there's no need,

828
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,110
but they insisted on giving it to me.

829
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:27,270
I had to accept it.

830
00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:29,420
Were these only given to us

831
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:31,550
or did other neighbors receive them?

832
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:33,810
I think they gave it to all the neighbors.

833
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:34,920
Young Master,

834
00:41:35,070 --> 00:41:37,090
what should we do?

835
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:39,630
Since it's here, just eat it.

836
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:41,910
I don't think the Japanese were sincere.

837
00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:42,950
The rice balls are cold.

838
00:41:42,950 --> 00:41:44,240
Let me heat them up.

839
00:41:44,350 --> 00:41:45,410
No need, Mrs. Wang.

840
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,990
The rice balls are called sushi in Japan.

841
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:49,120
They're eaten cold.

842
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:51,710
You'll have diarrhea if you eat cold food.

843
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:53,240
Just make a bowl of hot soup.

844
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:55,210
I'll go now.

845
00:41:57,470 --> 00:41:58,900
Do you think there's anything wrong

846
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:00,390
with the Japanese that just moved in?

847
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:01,870
Are they here to spy on us?

848
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,910
[Nation's Valuable Asset]

849
00:42:04,310 --> 00:42:05,030
Director.

850
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:08,310
The guy guarding Gu's Garden

851
00:42:08,350 --> 00:42:09,070
said...

852
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:11,030
He said a Japanese family

853
00:42:11,290 --> 00:42:12,750
moved next to Gu's Garden.

854
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:15,910
Yesterday, they specially gave sushi

855
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:17,990
to Gu's Garden.

856
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:19,810
They're just rice balls.

857
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:21,480
What do the Japanese do?

858
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,360
Not sure yet.

859
00:42:24,070 --> 00:42:26,000
Then why are you reporting it to me?

860
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:27,840
Don't pay attention to all this

861
00:42:27,870 --> 00:42:29,130
useless information.

862
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:30,600
If you can't do it,

863
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:33,310
I'll have Xie Wenchao come back from Shanghai.

864
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:36,010
♫Her brows are like willow leaves and her eyes have tender, lingering looks♫

865
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:38,170
♫She has a delicate nose and a red cherry-like little mouth♫

866
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:40,530
♫A big, big flower♫

867
00:42:40,730 --> 00:42:48,620
♫Tucked at her temple♫

868
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:51,810
♫As pretty as a flower♫

869
00:42:52,590 --> 00:42:55,040
♫Her brows are like willow leaves and her eyes have tender, lingering looks♫

870
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:55,910
♫She has a delicate nose♫

871
00:42:57,390 --> 00:42:57,990
Madam,

872
00:42:58,390 --> 00:43:00,490
the Japanese sir from across the street is here.
