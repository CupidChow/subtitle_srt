According to our intel,

00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:07,590
last night in Suzhou, your son attempted

454
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:10,050

so I'm here to confirm.

457
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:16,680
Ask my son

458

about what he did.

Mr. Gu,

462
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:27,310
as I've mentioned to you before,

463
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:29,710
since Guo Jingji, the magistrate of Wu County, was assassinated,

464
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:31,880
his position has been vacant.

465
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:34,990
After careful consideration,

466
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:38,780
I believe that only you

467
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:40,650
can take up this post.

468
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:44,430
I've made it clear many times.

469
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:48,560
I'm not interested in politics now.

470
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:51,860
Mr. Gu, don't you care about your son?

471
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:52,870
He disrupted the unity

473
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,320
Are you forcing me

00:30:58,350 --> 00:30:59,610
to make a deal with you?

475
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:06,290

476
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:09,630
The Gu family is very influential in Suzhou.

478
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:14,310

480
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:19,270
Are you going to just watch

Don't give me that.

If you don't take up the post of magistrate,

it'll end badly for you!

486
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:32,850
I'll have to give the order

488
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:34,950
Go ahead.

00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:37,250
As an old Chinese saying goes,

490
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:40,130

491
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:41,690

504
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:17,590
You should be

505
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:19,450
very familiar with the way there.

506
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:29,470
Dad.

507
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:31,510
What happened to Yizhong?

508
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:33,160
I don't know.

509
00:32:34,670 --> 00:32:36,530
Later, I'll send Fu Gui to find out

510
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:38,440
what he's done.

511
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:44,770
After I return to the base,

512
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,660
I'll ask the division commander to kill you all.

513
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:48,400
Comrade,

514
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:50,940
are you from the New Fourth Army?

515
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:53,640
I'm from the 16th Brigade of the 6th Division.

516
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:56,290
Where are you from?

517
00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:59,200
I'm from Jiangnan Volunteer Resistance Army.

518
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,130
Have some water.

519
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:03,400
What's wrong with him?

520
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:05,850
We don't know.

521
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:15,220
You must help Yizhong.

522
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,900
You know the things

523
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:19,470
Yizhong has done?

524
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:23,560
Back then,

525
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:25,670
I sent him to study architecture abroad

526
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,990
to keep him away from politics.

527
00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:32,610
But he still got involved.

528
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:34,310
Where could he hide?

529
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:36,170
The country is about to fall.

530
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:37,700
Can anyone not be affected?

531
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:39,970
A bunch of poor students

532
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:43,220
who know nothing about warfare

533
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:44,870
and don't even have a gun.

534
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:46,950
They can fight the Japanese?

535
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:49,250
They'll only get themselves killed.

536
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:51,150
Death is better than being displaced

537
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:52,550
after the country falls.

538
00:33:53,670 --> 00:33:55,030
Stop arguing.

539
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:00,050
Think of a way to save Young Master.

540
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:00,670
Save him?

541
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:02,110
How can I save him?

542
00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:04,370
Have you forgotten about Gao Guanwu?

543
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:06,230
He invited you over a few days ago.

544
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:08,050
I'll go find the invitation.

545
00:34:08,929 --> 00:34:11,130
He's the chairman of Jiangsu Province.

546
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:13,620
Wang Jingwei appointed him!

547
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,360
Just a foolish title!

548
00:34:15,389 --> 00:34:15,780
Then…

549
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:18,010
Then go to Chen Qun.

550
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:19,340
You're out of your mind!

551
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,590
Who are those people you mentioned?

552
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,150
Traitors!

553
00:34:23,449 --> 00:34:24,929
Scum!

554
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:27,690
You want me to turn to them?

555
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:29,030
Company Commander Fu.

556
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:31,179
Do you want to drag me down like them?

557
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:32,630
Sir, I wouldn't dare!

558
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:35,760
But I just can't

559
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:38,909
watch Young Master die without doing anything.

560
00:34:38,989 --> 00:34:39,630
Dad.

561
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:41,360
They're

562
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:42,550
using Yizhong's life

563
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:44,900
to force me to be the magistrate of Wu County.

564
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:46,170
I want to save Yizhong.

565
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:47,150
But how can I

566
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:48,630
betray my country

567
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:50,429
and my people?

568
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:53,469
Then fight with them!

569
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:55,929
The Japanese have ruled Suzhou for so many years.

570
00:34:55,929 --> 00:34:57,830
I've had enough of them!

571
00:34:58,750 --> 00:34:59,390
Sir,

572
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,680
let's break into the prison!

573
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:02,800
Qi!

574
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:04,110
Yes!

575
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:05,150
Is everyone here?

576
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:05,910
Gather everyone.

577
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:06,850
Get the whole sergeant

578
00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:07,390
up here!

579
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:09,840
Fall in!

580
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:15,480
Listen.

581
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:17,470
We're going to save Young Master.

582
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:18,070
Let's go!

583
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:18,980
Yes!

584
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:20,300
Stop!

585
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:22,980
Yizhong has been arrested.

586
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:25,710
Do you want them to be arrested too?

587
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:27,640
How can a small group like yours

588
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:29,300
break into the prison?

589
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,350
But we have to do something

590
00:35:30,350 --> 00:35:31,750
to save Young Master!

591
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:32,910
Close the gate.

592
00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:34,430
No one from the Gu family

593
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:35,890
is allowed to go out today.

594
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:36,820
Sir.

595
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:39,150
Bring them over!

596
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:41,610
Move!

597
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:43,330
Move!

598
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:44,490
-Move!
-Move!

599
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:46,610
Hurry!

600
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:47,890
Go up.

601
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:48,950
Come up.

602
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:53,910
Director. Director. Come here.

603
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:55,230
What are you looking at?

604
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:55,830
Go up.

605
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:58,000
-Move!
-What are you looking at? Go up.

606
00:35:58,430 --> 00:35:59,580
What's going on?

607
00:35:59,810 --> 00:36:00,950
They'll be executed.

608
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:02,410
You can't shoot Gu Yizhong.

609
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:03,160
Why?

610
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,660
Mr. Kondo went to Gu's Garden early in the morning

611
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:07,540
because of Gu Yizhong.

612
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,030
To make Gu Xixing

613
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:10,690
participate in the peace movement,

614
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:13,540
Mr. Kondo has put in a lot of effort.

615
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,890
Now that we've finally caught Gu Yizhong,

616
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:17,960
if you ruin Mr. Kondo's plan…

617
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:19,270
What can he do to me?

618
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:20,510
Huang Xinzhai.

619
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:22,690
Are you Chinese or not?

620
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:26,400
You bow and scrape to the Japanese

621
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:27,910
and call them sirs.

622
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,200
Did they raise you or what?

623
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:32,750
Or do you want

624
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:33,950
to take my place?

625
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:36,210
No, no. It's not like that.

626
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:36,910
D-Director.

627
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:37,790
These men

628
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:39,200
won't confess

629
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:41,000
or join the peace movement.

630
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:42,420
Why should we keep them?

631
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,550
All they do is waste food.

632
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:47,820
I don't care if you're from Chongqing

633
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,110
or Yan'an.

634
00:36:49,330 --> 00:36:50,100
Lian Jinhai.

635
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:50,710
Yes.

636
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:52,760
Take them out and shoot them.

637
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,540
For social happiness,

638
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,290
for the survival of the nation,

639
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:05,350
we must strengthen unity and fight resolutely!

640
00:37:05,350 --> 00:37:12,430
In the war against invasion and nation-building,
we hold high the banner of independence and freedom!

641
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:14,000
Forward! Forward!

642
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:15,870
We are the New Fourth Army!

643
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:17,710
Forward! Forward!

644
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:19,390
We are the New Fourth Army!

645
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:21,020
Forward! Forward!

646
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:24,710
We are the New Fourth Army!

647
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:30,910
Ominous!

648
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:32,830
Stop watching. Break it up!

649
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:13,000
[Top one]

650
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:32,730
[Ready for Battle]

651
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:33,270
You're finally back. Something terrible has happened.

652
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:34,390
Director Zhou has sent Gu Yizhong

653
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:35,620
to Stump.

654
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:36,750
He's to be executed.

655
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:37,950
He'll die!

656
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,650
[Ready for Battle]

657
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,030
Wentao.

658
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:45,000
[Duan Wentao, Chief of the Intelligence Department of the Suzhou agent station]

659
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:44,150
I know

660
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:46,510
you and Huang Xinzhai are close.

661
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:49,750
But in the current situation,

662
00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:53,010
you should be able to tell an enemy from a friend.

663
00:38:53,870 --> 00:38:54,350
Yes.

664
00:38:54,890 --> 00:38:55,930
Then please

665
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:58,370
keep tracking his movements for me,

666
00:38:58,370 --> 00:38:58,960
okay?

667
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:00,110
Yes.

668
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:00,810
Sir,

669
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:03,390
there are men of No. 90 among those who were sent

670
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:04,670
to Stump to be executed.

671
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:06,470
Something's definitely wrong.

672
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:09,290
Sir.

673
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:18,240
Where is Gu Yizhong?

674
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:20,030
Sir,

675
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:21,250
he's been taken away for execution.

676
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:22,510
Mr. Li has approved it.

677
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:23,990
Don't think too much of Mr. Li

678
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:25,720
just because he has the support

679
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:27,830
of Lieutenant Colonel Seiki.

680
00:39:28,050 --> 00:39:28,830
Don't forget

681
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:30,290
who they take orders from!

682
00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:31,890
Who Mr. Li takes orders from

683
00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:33,110
is none of my business.

684
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:34,070
I just know

685
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:36,120
I only take orders from Mr. Li.

686
00:39:36,490 --> 00:39:38,150
He wanted to kill him, so I did.

687
00:39:38,450 --> 00:39:40,310
The Special Agent Headquarters have made it clear

688
00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:41,750
that all affairs related to the Chinese people

689
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:43,430
should be handled by us Chinese ourselves.

690
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:45,790
This was a promise personally made by your senior advisor,

691
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:48,010
Major General Kagesa, to Chairman Wang

692
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:49,670
when the Headquarters were established.

693
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:51,130
I hope you can adhere to it.

694
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:57,720
Not Gu Yizhong!

695
00:39:57,910 --> 00:39:58,670
What does shooting

696
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:00,870
Gu Yizhong have to do with what you said?

697
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:04,030
Sir.

698
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:05,910
I know

699
00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:08,050
you want to use Gu Yizhong's life

700
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:10,790
to force his father to join the peace movement.

701
00:40:10,790 --> 00:40:11,950
But I'm Chinese.

702
00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:13,410
I know them.

703
00:40:14,690 --> 00:40:16,680
An old warlord like Gu Xixing

704
00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:18,510
is just like Wu Peifu.

705
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:20,820
They value honor more than their lives.

706
00:40:21,570 --> 00:40:22,100
So,

707
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:24,570
I took the liberty of taking Gu Yizhong away.

708
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,110
I want to use Gu Yizhong

709
00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:27,650
to find out where the New Fourth Army

710
00:40:27,650 --> 00:40:29,170
is hiding on Taihu Lake.

711
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:30,730
After I get what I want,

712
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:32,340
I'll return him in one piece.

713
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:43,350
Uncle Gu!

714
00:40:43,370 --> 00:40:44,030
Ruotong.

715
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:45,430
Huizhong! Huizhong!

716
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:47,770
[Blessed]

717
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:47,830
Please save Yizhong.

718
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:49,710
He's been taken to Stump.

719
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,470
Where is that place?

720
00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:53,580
It's where No. 90 shoots people.

721
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:55,180
It's outside the Chang Gate.

722
00:40:55,350 --> 00:40:56,790
That Japanese fooled us!

723
00:40:56,810 --> 00:40:59,140
Sir, they're going to shoot Young Master.

724
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:00,090
Uncle Gu.

725
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,110
Dad.

726
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:04,590
Uncle Gu.

727
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:07,590
Please save Yizhong.

728
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,030
Company Commander Fu.

729
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:09,560
Yes!

730
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:10,990
Get the car.

731
00:41:10,990 --> 00:41:11,500
Yes.

732
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:13,460
We're going to Stump!

733
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:27,110
Get off!

734
00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:28,000
Get off, all of you!

735
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:28,600
Hurry!

736
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:30,330
-Get off.
-Get off. Hurry.

737
00:41:30,350 --> 00:41:31,470
-Hurry!
-Hurry up.

738
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:33,410
Hurry up. Stop dawdling.

739
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:38,060
Don't look back.

740
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:40,440
There's someone you care about.

741
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,640
You can't die like this.

742
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:42,670
I'll stall them later.

743
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:43,640
You take the chance to escape.

744
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:44,510
If you can escape,

745
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:45,740
go back to the base

746
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:47,230
and tell the division commander

747
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:47,870
that I, Liu Qiangbao,

748
00:41:47,870 --> 00:41:49,860
from the 8th Company, 3rd Battalion, 1st Regiment, 16th Brigade,

749
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:51,450
didn't become a traitor.

750
00:41:53,370 --> 00:41:54,460
Where is the base?

751
00:41:55,890 --> 00:41:56,830
You don't know?

752
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:57,940
How would I know?

753
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:03,380
Move!

754
00:42:03,450 --> 00:42:04,030
Move!

755
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:06,690
