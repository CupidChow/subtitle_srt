00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:41,479
This was found at Huang Xinzhai's place.

5
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:44,930
I didn't pay attention last time.

6
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:47,810
Later, the more I look at it, the more it looks like a person.

7
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:50,370
The butler of Gu Yizhong.

8
00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:52,370
His name is something like Fu Gui.

9
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:02,370
Why did Huang Xinzhai

10
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,880
draw a portrait of Fu Gui?

11
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:07,030
I don't think Huang Xinzhai is capable of that.

12
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,710
It's the brushwork of Painter Li from the Fourth Branch,

13
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:10,910
who specializes in painting portraits of suspects.

14
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:13,030
It's the portrait of the person who rented the house

15
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:15,690
and who masterminded the digging of the tunnel.

16
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:18,750
Huang Xinzhai

17
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,490
didn't do anything good when he was alive.

18
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:24,210
But he did us a big favor after he died.

19
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:25,710
Sir,

20
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:27,680
once we arrest Fu Gui,

21
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:30,000
Gu Yizhong will show his true colors.

Mr. Gu,

23

24
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,270
I have an appointment with an undercover agent

26
00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:45,960

Mr. Iwai said you want to see me for some urgent matter.

33
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,930
I like this garden very much.

34
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,470
This is

35
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:19,079
a typical Suzhou landscape

36
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:22,430
with pavilions and winding paths leading to a secluded place.

37
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:24,090
I didn't expect that Mr. Kondo

38
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:25,950
loves gardens of Suzhou so much.

there's Director Zhou in the senior level

and directors of various departments in the lower level.

56
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:12,490
I'm just an ordinary agent.

57
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:14,540
It would be hardly convincing.

58
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:17,070
Are you worried that Zhou Zhifei won't agree?

59
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:26,970
To be honest, I don't like Mr. Zhou.

60
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,770
He doesn't do things for the peace movement.

61
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,570
He only does things for himself.

62
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:33,710

75
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:06,030
I heard Wang Zemin say before

76
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:09,070
that the Japanese wanted to found this association.

77
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:09,990
They wanted to govern the cultural,

78
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:12,850
industrial, and commercial industries of Suzhou.

79
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,550
But they shouldn't ask Gu Yizhong

80
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:18,010
to lead the association.

81
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,840
His resume doesn't qualify him for the work.

82
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,050
Every one of us in the station

83
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:22,840
is more qualified than he is.

84
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,640

90
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:45,510
He speaks English, knows architecture well,

91
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:46,450
and can draw.

92
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,530
How can you compare with him?

93

100
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:02,730

00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:26,190
She's just a lady performer of storytelling accompanied by string instruments.

190
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:27,850
She's by no means a CBIS agent.

191
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:30,790
Really?

192
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,500
I tell nothing but the truth.

193
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:35,310
You're engaged and living in the same room.

194
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:37,130
Why aren't you married?

195
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,780
I don't think people from Suzhou do this.

196
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:48,190
Sir.

197
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:51,210
I was born and raised in Suzhou,

198
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:53,330
and I've never heard of it.

199
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:55,810
But my intelligence shows

200
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:58,590
that Zhang Haimo and Ou Xinping

201
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:02,000
traveled from Hong Kong to Shanghai by British ship,

202
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:05,120
then came to Suzhou from Shanghai by Beijing-Shanghai Railway Line,

203
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,120
and finally moved into Gu's Garden.

204
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:07,870
By the way,

205
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,340
we seized the payroll book

206
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,620
of Suzhou Zone of the CBIS.

207
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:14,560
Sir, please take a look.

208
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:16,120
Zhang Haimo

209
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:18,620
[Zhang Haimo, Member, 35 yuan, Salary]

210
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,920
receives an allowance of 35 yuan per month.

211
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:20,950
It is absolutely true.

212
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:30,840
How do you explain this?

213
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,100
Yeah.

214
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:36,020
Explain to Mr. Kondo.

215
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:40,190
[Zhang Haimo, 35 yuan, Salary]

216
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,590
Sir, please take a look.

217
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,520
It does have Haimo's name on it.

218
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,680
[Zhang Haimo, Member, 35 yuan, Salary]

219
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:56,840
But Haimo's name is at the end.

220
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,910
It looks like it was added temporarily.

221
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:00,070
Plus, the signature

222
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,070
is not Zhang Haimo's handwriting at all.

223
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:04,030
We seized this

224
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:04,870
from Deyunzhi Travel Agency.

225
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:06,130
It should be credible.

226
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:11,650
Sir.

227
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:13,810
After Haimo came to Suzhou,

228
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:15,970
except having been to Feng Garden Story-telling Theatre,

229
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:18,050
she has been staying in Gu's Garden to take care of my father.

230
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:19,510
My father also

231
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:21,950
handed over the title deed of Gu's Garden to her before he died.

232
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:23,390
Haimo is simple-minded by nature.

233
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:26,230
She only performs storytelling accompanied by string instruments and knows nothing about politics.

234
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:28,440
If she hasn't been made use of by someone with intentions,

235
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,990
there's absolutely no way she could get involved.

236
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:30,850
How about this?

237
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:33,680
Zhang Haimo is currently in No. 90.

238
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,830
Let's put her to the torture.

239
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:37,750
Then everything will be clear.

240
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:40,750
I can guarantee with my life

241
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,130
that she has nothing to do with the CBIS.

242
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:44,230
I can also guarantee with my life

243
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:45,480
that Zhang Haimo

244
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,060
is a CBIS agent.

245
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:57,270
Since you're engaged and you love each other,

246
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:59,910
why didn't you get married earlier?

247
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,460
My father passed away suddenly.

248
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:08,310
It would be against the etiquette for me

249
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:09,390
to get married during the mourning period.

250
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,430
The matter is urgent. Nowadays, during the war,

251
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:14,690
you don't need to consider things like etiquette too much.

252
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:26,640
Sir.

253
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:28,030
What's up?

254
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:30,270
Zhang Haimo has been tied up in the interrogation room.

255
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:31,870
Please let us know what to do.

256
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:33,070
How about this?

257
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:34,780
I'll interrogate her myself.

258
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:35,660
Wait.

259
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:50,590
Gu,

260
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:55,130
do you dare to vouch for this woman?

261
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:58,640
I can vouch for her with my life.

262
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:01,240
Fine.

263
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:04,610
Release her.

264
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:07,700
No.

265
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:09,030
I have a suggestion.

266
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:13,540
You two should get married.

267
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,540
It would also be a joyful event for No. 90.

268
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:18,610
That's it.

269
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:20,400
Zhou, allocate some budget

270
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:21,270
and make the wedding

271
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:22,310
a decent one.

272
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:28,390
Sir, well…

273
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:29,270
Go ahead.

274
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:35,370
Thank you, Sir.

275
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,740
Congratulations!

276
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:43,950
Sir,

277
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:46,390
I think Gu Yizhong not only…

278
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:48,250
Let's talk about it no more.

279
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:54,210
Gu Yizhong.

280
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:57,470
He's of use to me for something else.

281
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:59,070
Huang Xinzhai died.

282
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:01,720
No. 90 is lacking a Vice Director.

283
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,640
I was about to discuss this with you, too.

284
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:07,280
There's a suitable candidate I would like to recommend.

285
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,920
I think Captain Zhang Jiping

286
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,740
is a strong fit for the position.

287
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:12,730
Gu Yizhong.

288
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:13,960
How is that possible?

289
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:14,710
We're suspicious of him…

290
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:15,970
I've already decided.

291
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:21,660
This is the appointment letter signed by Mr. Li,

292
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:24,110
[An internal appointment letter. To Gu Yizhong]

293
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:26,010
which appointed Gu Yizhong as Vice Director of Suzhou Agent Station.

294
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:37,470
I'm leaving.

295
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:04,220

[The Clouds Are Gone]

298
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,070
Come here.

299
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:47,550
Get in the car first.

300
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:50,660
Don't worry about me.

301
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,070
It's okay.

302
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:05,100
Haimo is innocent.

303
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:07,730
In the current situation,

304
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,110
who dares to say

305
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:11,440
that they are innocent?

306
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:17,120
If you don't let go of Haimo,

307
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:19,540
I'll report to Kondo

308
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:21,070
that Ou Xinping was lurking

309
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,200
at your place.

310
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:23,970
Also,

311
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:26,480
you released Jiang Boxian on purpose.

312
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:30,380
Whatever.

313
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:31,610
Tell Kondo.

314
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,060
Do you have evidence?

315
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:35,880
At the front gate of Willow Garden,

316
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:38,220
you helped Ou Xinping.

317
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:43,680
You were really there that day.

318
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:48,680
When my father was alive, he liked collecting binoculars,

319
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,540
which were used in the German army

320
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:52,150
and allowed one to see very far.

321
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:53,070
So,

322
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,830
you killed the first-class shooter

323
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:57,270
of the Peace Army?

324
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,980
He killed too many people.

325
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,010
That was his retribution.

326
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:03,080
This is good.

327
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,360

330
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:15,300
do you think

331
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,770
can avoid retribution?

332
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:28,380
Don't underestimate Kondo.

333
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:31,210
He asked you to marry Haimo

334
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,630
in the hope

335
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:34,850
that you would leave the Communist Party.

336
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:36,710
Just like some time ago he asked me

337
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:39,150
to execute Ou Xinping personally.

338
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:41,200
In No. 90,

00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,660
if you want to live one more day,

340
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:46,270
you must learn

341
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:48,150
to read the minds of the Japanese.

342
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:49,600
Otherwise,

343
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,920
you wouldn't even know how you died.

346
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:02,460
can easily be trusted by the Japanese.

347
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:06,680
But those of you who were from the Communist Party are different.

348
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:09,610
The Communists

349
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,180
are firm in their belief.

350
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:15,060
If you really want to defect

351
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:16,980
and be trusted by the Japanese,

352
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,620
it will be much harder than we do.

353
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:21,620
But luckily,

354
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:23,420
for now,

355
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:26,880
Kondo still trusts him.

00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,210
No.

what else did Kondo say?

373
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,990
That day, he dragged me to his private residence,

374
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:48,000
saying that he wanted to found the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association

375
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,390
and appoint me as president

to manㅁㅎㄷ the matter.

377
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:52,690
He also said

378
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:55,260
that he couldn't trust Zhou Zhifei.

379
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,280
By the way,

380
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:58,890
Zhou Zhifei called me Vice Director just now.

381
00:21:58,890 --> 00:21:59,850
That's strange.

382
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:00,950
That matches up

383
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:04,190
with the intelligence that our undercover agent in No. 76 got.

384
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:05,790
Mr. Li just signed you on

385
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:07,250
as Vice Director of No. 90.

386
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:09,570
I heard that the Japanese requested it.

387
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:15,270
The Japanese are obviously trying

388
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:16,300
to drag me into it.

389
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,960
Back then, they didn't let my father off.

390
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:22,230
Now they don't want to let me off either.

391
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,230
There are only two options.

392
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:26,070
Leave No. 90

393
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:26,910
or

394
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:28,950
make use of the current situation

395
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:30,110
and marry Haimo.

396
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:32,350
Impossible.

397
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:34,230
I can't marry Haimo.

398
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:34,870
Sir,

399
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:36,660
I've already proposed to Xiao Ruotong.

400
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:38,020
And she accepted it.

401
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:38,880
I endured humiliation

402
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,120
just for this day.

403
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:42,540
I didn't ask you to really marry Haimo.

404
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:44,330
It's just a fake marriage.

405
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:48,320
What do you mean?

406
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:50,120
In our undercover work,

407
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:51,750
we often need to pretend to be a couple with someone

408
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:52,710
and work together.

409
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:54,630
It's called "setting a trap" in the party.

410
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:55,630
I don't accept it.

411
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,820
I don't want to do this.

414
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:04,590
sacrificed himself.

415
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,920
It happened just now.

416
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:07,510
The agents of No. 90

417
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:08,750
went to Dingjue Temple to arrest him.

418
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:10,160
He would rather die than being arrested.

419
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,820
And he died with the enemies.

420
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:15,450
Impossible.

421
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:16,740
I contacted Xiao Ruotong a long time ago

422
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:17,730
and let her tell him to leave Suzhou.

423
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,640
Why was he still in Dingjue Temple?

424
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,240
It's impossible. I don't believe it.

425
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,500
He didn't want to leave

426
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:25,150
because he didn't want to stand by

427
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:26,480
and give up his hometown

428
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,590
to the Japanese.

429
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:30,060
So he had to fight

430
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:31,680
even if he would have to die.

431
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:38,290

I don't want to force you.

434
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:48,970
Now, Kondo asked you to be the Vice Director.

435
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:50,830

Please don't blame Miss Xiao.

446
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:59,270
I decided not to leave.

447
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:01,980
As a soldier,

448
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,130
I should have died on the battlefield.

449
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:06,980
It's already a great shame to live a few more years.

450
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:11,460
I had been following Division Commander closely

451
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:12,870
for decades.

452
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,050
Before he died, Division Commander once said

453
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:18,760
that the Gu family has been a distinguished family for a hundred years.

00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:29,700
weighs heavier than my life.

458
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:32,550

522
00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:34,910
that there was no ancient architecture in China,

523
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:38,230

Our country is on the brink of survival.

558
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:21,140
We must fight without concern for ourselves.

559
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:26,410
Mr. Gu,

560
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:29,640
if you have anything to say,

561
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,140
just say it.

562
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:35,100
I'll do whatever you say.

563
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:52,070
Haimo,

564
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:57,640
will you marry me?

565
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:45,310
Junxia.

566
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:47,330
Look.

567
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:50,000
The color of the yarn is nice, isn't it?

568
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,540
Yes.

569
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,340
It's getting cold.

570
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:55,740
I'm going to knit a new scarf for Yizhong.

571
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:56,740
He will need it.

572
00:32:56,950 --> 00:32:57,560
Ruotong.

573
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:01,660
What's wrong?

574
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:07,070
Why do you look so serious?

575
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,520
Is the ship not able to leave?

576
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:11,170
We're not able to go back?

577
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:12,530
The ship can leave.

578
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:14,190
But he just

579
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:16,150
can't leave with us for now.

580
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:17,710
Why?

581
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:20,220
I don't know the specific reason either.

582
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:23,590
Is there something holding him up?

583
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:26,390
Did something happen at the agent station?

584
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:27,390
Did they suspect him?

585
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:28,070
Is he in danger?

586
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:29,350
No. Not at all.

587
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:31,840
He suddenly decided not to leave.

588
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:34,430
There must be a reason.

589
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:36,080
I'll go ask him.

590
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:36,670
No, you can't go.

591
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:37,390
Why?

592
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:40,910
Ruotong.

593
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:45,460
Forget him.

594
00:33:47,010 --> 00:33:47,910
Why?

595
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:49,670
Because he's getting married.

596
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:51,140
Nonsense!

597
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,680
Why didn't I know that he…

598
00:33:54,010 --> 00:33:55,400
How can he get married?

599
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:56,570
Who would he marry without me?

600
00:33:56,570 --> 00:33:57,230
Haimo.

[Pavilion of Pleasantness]

602
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:11,510
You should tell her face to face.

603
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:17,860
I'll regret it if I do so.

604
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:21,520
I don't have the courage to stand in front of her

605
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,139
or say those words.

606
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:27,560
I let her down.

607
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,550
The wedding will be held the day after tomorrow.

608
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:34,010
A Western-style wedding.

609
00:34:34,469 --> 00:34:36,070
It will be held in the church.

in your heart.

614
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:25,370
No one can replace her.

615
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,760
I only have one wish now.

616
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:33,810
That is to avenge the deaths of Uncle Gu,

618
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:37,540
and Butler Fu.

619
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:40,390
I'm a woman without talent.

620
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,740
If I can set a trap with you by pretending to be a couple,

621
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:45,870
I'm willing to do so.

622
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:48,870
Don't worry.

623
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,130
I can play the role of the wife well.

624
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:53,960
I'm just afraid

625
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,100
that you can't play the role of the husband well.

This is the first time

00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:54,430
I received a wedding invitation from Chinese people.

634
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:57,350
But is it appropriate for me to attend it?

he's dating a female Communist?

647

Not that female Communist.
