The pharmacy contacted them

324

but they didn't have it as well.

325

They said malaria is prevalent around
Taihu Lake.

malaria.

It's not that easy.

00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:10,270
I understand.

00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,760
I completely understand.

358
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,670
It's all because of him.

00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:53,750
I can't say it.

374
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:01,330
It's all his fault.

375
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,430
It’s not your fault.

376
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:06,230
Alright. Just let it out.

377
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:07,300
Cry. Let it out.

378
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,590
Zhou, be honest.

379
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:11,870
Do you know

380
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:12,970
what's going on here?

381
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:15,170
I don't know what you are talking about.

382
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:20,930
Mrs. Weng and Mr. Li

383
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:23,680
has been together for seven or eight years.

384
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,830
She had an abortion for Mr. Li twice.

385
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:29,610
She is not able to give birth anymore.

386
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,760
Mr. Li is leaving her.

387
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:33,660
Just say it.

388
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,450
Women will be tortured

389
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,680
to death by men sooner or later.

390
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:41,560
Mrs. Liu.

391
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:44,350
Mr. Zhou has been back for a long time.

392
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:46,330
Where is the lotus seed soup?

393
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:52,530
You...

394
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,700
That's enough.

395
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:57,410
I'm not lying at all.

396
00:23:57,650 --> 00:23:59,310
You're not telling the truth.

397
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,640
I finally know

398
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:03,120
why you like her.

399
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:05,330
Because she is stupid.

400
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:07,150
So as a cunning man like you,

401
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:09,280
you can be relieved when you come home.

402
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:13,740
Yes.

403
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:17,910
Yes, a fool has a blessing.

404
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:20,880
Who exactly are you calling a fool?

405
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:22,950
Me.

406
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,010
You definitely are not.

407
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:26,470
Let me get you some.

408
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:27,390
No thank you.

409
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:27,990
Drink mine.

410
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:29,630
No, you finish yours.

411
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:31,030
Drink it. You've been tired all day.

412
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:31,590
Finish yours.

413
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:32,230
No.

414
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:36,550
Yuanhe,

415
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:40,150
let me tell you.

416
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:44,830
Make yourself at home from now on.

417
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:47,670
You can stay as long as you want.

418
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:52,470
I hope I'm not bothering you.

419
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:53,850
Not bothering at all.

420
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:55,210
As long as I'm here,

421
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:56,750
I won't let Mr. Li

422
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:57,950
leave you like this.

423
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:00,880
Let's put aside

424
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:02,070
Mr. Li's family matters.

425
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:03,400
I can't forget about it.

426
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:04,430
I can't stand

427
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:06,180
a woman to be bullied like this.

428
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,030
Fine.

429
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:09,160
If it's not working,

430
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:12,470
I'll take you to Shanghai to find Mrs. Li.

431
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:13,260
Right?

432
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:14,950
Let's play tough.

433
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:17,000
Mrs. Li can control Mr. Li.

434
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:18,730
With your support,

435
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:20,450
I won't be afraid anymore.

436
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:26,390
It's been almost eight years.

437
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:30,200
They either give you the man or the money,

438
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:30,750
right?

439
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:32,830
We have to earn something.

440
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:33,350
Yes.

441
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:36,100
We can't let those cold-hearted men

442
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:37,470
live a good life.

443
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:40,440
Let me think about it.

444
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:43,880
Considering this situation,

445
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:46,390
you can't let it go

446
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:47,230
without a hundred gold bars.

447
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:48,540
You'll make a scene.

448
00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:50,960
Don't meddle in Mr. Li's affairs, okay?

449
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:55,350
Fine.

450
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:57,430
We can't afford to offend your lord.

451
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:58,070
Alright?

452
00:25:58,090 --> 00:25:59,770
Let’s talk about it later.

453
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:02,990
We received some new fabrics from the
cloth store.

454
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:04,430
The color and style

455
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:05,880
are all one of a kind.

456
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:08,230
Let's pick out some, shall we?

457
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:09,750
- Which one do you like?
- Okay.

458
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:11,020
I'll ask the tailor to come in

459
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:12,000
tomorrow to measure our sizes.

460
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,330
Let's make some cheongsams for good luck.

461
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:14,910
OK.

462
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:15,700
Let's go.

463
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,190
Zhou is not clean either.

464
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:31,160
No way.

465
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:36,790
Wan Lilang in No. 76

466
00:26:36,810 --> 00:26:39,170
just arrested a CBIS liaison.

467
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:41,390
According to the liaison,

468
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:43,220
Xu Enzeng assigned

469
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:45,820
a new Operations Department Head

470
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:47,450
to Suzhou,

471
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:49,050
called Ou Xinping.

472
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:52,110
Do you know who Mr. Ou is?

473
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:56,510
Director Zhou's old lover.

474
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:03,630
Director Zhou betrayed CPC,

475
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,300
and joined CBIS

476
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:08,110
because he was tricked by this Qu beauty.

477
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:13,150
This time, Qu

478
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:14,950
came back to Jiangsu to be the district head.

479
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:17,480
I don't believe she won't find Director Zhou.

480
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:19,820
When I catch the big fish,

481
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:22,690
I'm going to get to the bottom of it,

482
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:24,160
and Zhou will be doomed.

483
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:27,100
By that time, No. 90

484
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:30,640
will be ours, Yizhong.

485
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:31,930
Here.

486
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:41,150
How are you feeling?

487
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:42,620
Are you feeling better?

488
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:44,110
Yes.

489
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:47,990
This is...

490
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:51,420
This is my friend.

491
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:53,030
You have to wait.

492
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:54,190
I'll get the nurse.

493
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:54,910
It's time for your shot.

494
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:55,640
Dr. Lu,

495
00:27:57,190 --> 00:27:58,550
I came today

496
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:00,630
to ask you a favor.

497
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:01,950
Go ahead.

498
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:04,230
My friend

499
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:06,310
needs some quinine.

500
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:08,550
Can you help him?

501
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:10,340
How much do you need?

502
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:11,180
About 1,000.

503
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:14,630
[quinine injection]

504
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:16,730
I personally called Manager Shen

505
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:17,560
from Baiji Pharmacy,

506
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,030
and they only gave me three.

507
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:19,910
The Japanese

508
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:21,490
are very strict with this.

509
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:22,910
Without the movement permit

510
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:24,330
obtained from the Japanese office,

511
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:26,110
any person more than ten quinine injections

512
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:27,830
will get executed immediately.

513
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:28,630
We have channels

514
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:30,070
to transport them out of Suzhou safely.

515
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:31,730
I won’t cause you any trouble.

516
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,630
And the payment will be paid

517
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:34,650
through legal tender.

518
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:35,930
I'm just a doctor.

519
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:38,520
I don't know much about these businesses.

520
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:39,830
Miss Xiao,

521
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:41,670
you might as well take the shot.

522
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:43,310
No, I'm good.

523
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:46,980
I'll pay for these three injections.

524
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:48,350
Yizhong has told me,

525
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,950
but you must get these three injections.

526
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:51,350
No.

527
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:54,070
There are many people who need these three.

528
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:54,670
I'm sorry.

529
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:56,350
[quinine injection]

530
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,620
Then I can't

531
00:28:57,770 --> 00:28:58,950
give you the injections.

532
00:28:58,950 --> 00:28:59,630
Dr. Lu.

533
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:01,090
Miss Xiao.

534
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:03,510
Don't underestimate malaria.

535
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:05,150
Hundreds of people in Suzhou died

536
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:06,910
because of this disease this year.

537
00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:09,110
These three are only enough to save you.

538
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:10,440
After the injection,

539
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,950
we must hand in the empty bottle to Mr. Shen.

540
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:13,200
Not a single one can go missing.

541
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,730
The Japanese are watching.

542
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:19,570
Never ming, Dr. Lu.

543
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:21,810
Administer the injection to her.

544
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:36,300
[Zhaohe Hospital]

545
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:39,760
Let's go.

546
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:42,930
Miss Xiao,

547
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,170
please wait.

548
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:47,470
Do you really want to the injections?

549
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:49,350
I do know a way.

550
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:51,790
Can we talk in private?

551
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:56,670
Go ahead.

552
00:29:57,150 --> 00:29:59,190
A man named Ding Jiansheng

553
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:00,640
owns a trading company

554
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:01,910
called Xinglong Trade Company.

555
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:03,670
It specializes in scarce supplies.

556
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:06,440
Quinine, atropine,

557
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:08,170
Yunnan Baiyao for gunshot wounds.

558
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:09,510
They got anything you need.

559
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:10,570
In large quantity.

560
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:12,270
Where is he now?

561
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:14,310

751

♫Red hot mamma♫

♫Red hot mamma♫

754
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:56,970
Go away.

755
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:17,710
Move! Move!

756
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,130
He ran away.

757
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:27,340
Let’s go.

758
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,060
Back to Suzhou.

759
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:34,490
Not going after him.

760
00:40:34,490 --> 00:40:36,300
I saw a man in a trench coat.

761
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,260
He looked like Gu Yizhong.

762
00:40:38,690 --> 00:40:39,450
This time,

763
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:40,700
we have to catch him.

764
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:41,890
Brother.

765
00:40:43,470 --> 00:40:44,600
Where is the ticket?

766
00:40:46,990 --> 00:40:47,770
It's is here.

767
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:48,340
Upstairs.

768
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:48,940
Thank you.

769
00:41:12,990 --> 00:41:13,630
Hurry up.

770
00:41:13,810 --> 00:41:14,630
Hurry up.

771
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:16,010
Close the door.

772
00:41:21,990 --> 00:41:23,940
Gao Hu, where's Gu Yizhong?

773
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,230
Did he go to Shanghai?

774
00:41:27,910 --> 00:41:28,940
My brother...

775
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,180
I'm asking you.

776
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:38,870
So crowded here.

777
00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:41,590
Captain Zhang, did anything happen?

778
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:47,330
Gao Hu, be honest,

779
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,040
did he just come back?

780
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:52,570
Gu and I have been drinking all night.

781
00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:54,110
That's why we wanted to take a rest.

782
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:54,910
Exactly.

783
00:41:58,470 --> 00:41:59,930
Where is your trench coat?

784
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:00,920
Trench coat?

785
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:04,230
Do you mean this one?

786
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:15,370
Let's go.

787
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:27,540
Gu,

788
00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:30,720
my mom's illness depends on your medicine.

789
00:42:44,050 --> 00:42:44,580
Sit down.

790
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:46,390
Mr. Ding, don't be nervous.

791
00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:47,750
We

792
00:42:48,370 --> 00:42:50,230
want to do business with you.
