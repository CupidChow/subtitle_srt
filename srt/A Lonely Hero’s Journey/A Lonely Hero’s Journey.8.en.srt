Sit down.

41
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:54,010
As soon as Yizhong arrived there,

00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,910

under the Ming Dynasty.

Once he surrendered to the Qing Dynasty,

he was regarded as a traitor of the Ming Dynasty
for the rest of his life,

46

and listed as one of the traitor officials
in history.

Since the Japanese occupied Suzhou,

48

is that?

Cousin-in-law,

75
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:20,500
I recently was thinking we shouldn't lie to
him.

76
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:23,610
Others are begging for this chance.

I can't do this anymore.

85
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:50,050
I don't want to stay in Gu's Garden anymore.

00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:53,570
Where are you going to go?

87
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:55,470
Master Gu is very ill right now.

88
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:56,620
His daughter is missing.

89
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,020
His son became a traitor.

90
00:06:58,470 --> 00:06:59,880
What's he going to do if you leave him?

91
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,790
With his health condition, is he

92
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:02,390
able to survive this winter?

93
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,830
Shouldn't you pretend to

94
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:05,310
have a conscience?

95
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:20,450
Did Master arrange

96
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:22,750
Gu Yizhong to join No. 90?

97
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:25,310
If we could act this out,

98
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:27,830
they could too.

99
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:32,440
I wish it could be like this.

100
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:37,070
Slow down.

101
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:48,470

103
00:07:57,590 --> 00:07:58,450

104
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:08,070
Don't worry. It's just some scratches.

105
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:09,240
You'll be okay soon.

106
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:15,910

107
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:17,590
You'll recover very soon.

108
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:26,630
It's a minor issue.

109
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:29,100
Our training used to be even

110
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,000
more rigorous than yours.

111
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,919
Let me give you some private lessons.

112
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:40,549
Please do, Director Zhou.

113
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:45,220
Blending in is the most difficult skill for
a secret agent.

114
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:49,390
It's not about how smart the that person is.

115
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:54,630
It's about how stupid the opponent is.

116
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:57,630
Do you know my background?

117
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:03,550
During the 1927 Revolution,

118
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,880
I became a member of the Communist Party.

119
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:09,630
My superior was called Gu Shunzhang.

120
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:13,080
Back then, a group of young fellows

121
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,030
at your age followed him.

122
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:18,010
We devoted ourselves to the cause,

123
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:20,140
and were committed unconditionally,

124
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:23,270
hoping that one day we could make changes.

125
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:25,840
Then I got arrested.

126
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:28,830
I was tortured for seven days and nights,

127
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,090
and almost died.

128
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:35,370
Someone came in to persuade me to surrender.

129
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,610
Do you know who that person was?

130
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:41,790
It was Gu Shunzhang, that bastard.

131
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:44,950
He betrayed us.

132
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:46,790
I never thought

133
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:50,020
that he would betray us.

134
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:52,640
From that day on,

135
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,620
my heart died and I lost hope.

136
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:57,500
Then you joined

137
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,650
CBIS in 1932.

138
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,700
Who told you that?

139
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,820
Among the four departments of No. 90,

140
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:08,990
the intelligence department is the most
unreliable.

141
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:11,070
Those idiots.

142
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:14,370
Come on, tell me.

143
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:16,830
Tell me everything you know about me.

144
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,770
You made your success under Xu Enzeng
in CBIS.

145
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:28,550
In 1939,

146
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,680
No. 76 agent headquarters was established.

147
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:33,870
The first big case solved by Mr. Li

148
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:36,750
is to arrest

149
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,760
all the CBIS personnel in Shanghai-Suzhou
area.

150
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,220
There were over 40 people.

151
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:43,990
The only one who escaped was the District
Chief, Xu Zhaolin.

152
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,990
A man who was arrested at the same time

153
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:47,790
was also the deputy District Chief

154
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:48,850
named Zhou Youren.

155
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:50,710
Director Zhou,

156
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:53,530
that must be your alias.

157
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:57,810
You really are someone who studied abroad.

158
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,110
Go on.

159
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,570
It was a big headline

160
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,120
in Shanghai News.

161
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:06,230
You can find it

162
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:08,030
in the photo resource room at the station.

163
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:11,070
Director, I want to ask you.

164
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:13,430
Are you

165
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:15,710
working against

166
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,510
or working for them in No. 90?

167
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:26,730
You really are a talent.

168
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:29,030
You are wasting your talent in No. 90.

169
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:32,180
You should really be in No. 76.

170
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:33,600
Go work for Mr. Li.

171
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,390
You haven't answered my question.

172
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:37,990
Director.

173
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,830
How should I put it?

174
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,740
Today in No. 90,

175
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,730
or the entire Wang government,

176
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,460
which one of them is sincere?

177
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,270
Including Zhou Fohai, Chen Gongbo,

178
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:07,750
Minister Ding and Mr. Li,

179
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:11,950
in my opinion,

180
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,100
they are all there to please the Japanese

181
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:16,810
and Chairman Wang.

182
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:19,760
Then do you know

183
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:21,920
why everyone is so focused?

184
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,540
It's simple.

185
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:26,990
Money, power.

186
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:30,250
Mr. Li once said

187
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:34,910
if we can catch big fish by the river,

188
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:37,700
why should we go inside the river

189
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:39,870
to catch the small fish and shrimp?

190
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:42,550
Yizhong, it's good that you're here.

191
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,070
We will catch big fish together.

192
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:58,250
I'm not interested in money.

193
00:12:58,770 --> 00:12:59,770
You're too young.

194
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:02,670
Still too young.

195
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,430
If you didn't accuse me

196
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:05,430
of being Cell 8,

197
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:07,720
I wouldn't have ended up like this.

198
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:10,510
Yizhong.

199
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:13,200
You know that I didn't mean to do it.

200
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:14,430
Let me put it this way.

201
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:17,360
I thought you were a student.

202
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,710
You'd surrender in less than a few rounds.

203
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:22,590
You're good.

204
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:24,560
Not only did you not give up,

205
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,730
but also you made it to No. 90.

206
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:29,990
I'm quite impressed.

207
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:35,030
Yizhong, come here.

208
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,390
Have a seat.

209
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,920
Let me tell you something.

210
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:44,560
Something from the bottom of my heart
that could put me in danger.

211
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,150
No. 90

212
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:48,130
is just a place

213
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:49,830
where we met by chance.

214
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:54,200
The Japanese will eventually get kicked
out of Suzhou.

215
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,270
By then, this place will still be ours.

216
00:13:57,290 --> 00:13:58,860
I don't care whether the future government

217
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:01,230
belongs to Jiang or Wang.

218
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:05,690
I don't care who you'll listen to in the future.

219
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:10,370
I want to be your friend.

220
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:14,470
I mean it.

221
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,670
Really?

222
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:22,710
Yes.

223
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,360
Can you tell me

224
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:28,030
who is Cell 8?

225
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:34,470
In the end,

226
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:37,550
you're still working for the Communist Party,

227
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:38,100
aren't you?

228
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,750
I'm working for myself!

229
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:41,010
Cell 8 has almost killed me!

230
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:42,740
I need to get rid of him quickly!

231
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:48,510
I really underestimated you!

232
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:51,470
You are more stubborn than your father.

233
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:55,390
Don't blame me for not convincing you.

234
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:57,680
Get out of No. 90 as soon as possible.

235
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,430
Or else,

236
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,830
you'll die in No. 90.

237
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,280
Director.

238
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:11,590
What?

239
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,810
Can I stop monitoring Gu?

240
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:16,150
He knows

241
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:17,140
every move I make.

242
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:18,470
I can't do this anymore.

243
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:19,300
I can't do it.

244
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,590
Don't you have a gun?

245
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:21,190
Kill him.

246
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,320
If you kill me,

247
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,220
will he kill you too?

248
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:13,640
[Director of No. 76 Agent Headquarter and
Pacification Operation Committee Secretary General Mr. Li]

249
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:16,630
Mr. Li.

250
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:20,180
Kondo, how are you?

251
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:22,510
Not good.

252
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:24,410
Sir Kondo has been concerned about

253
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:26,770
the magistrate of Wu County.

254
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:30,300
Guo Jingji has been dead for so long.

255
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,520
You still can't find a candidate.

256
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:35,830
Chairman Gao of Jiangsu Province

257
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:37,430
specifically called me,

258
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:41,510
saying that if you don't make a decision,

259
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,070
he will.

260
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:46,350
I came to Suzhou

261
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:48,710
just for this matter.

262
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:49,470
Got it.

263
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:51,750
I still recommend

264
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:54,140
Wang Zemin, who I mentioned to Sir Kondo.

265
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:55,990
First, it's because this man

266
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:57,630
is widely known in Suzhou.

267
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,950
The people admire him.

268
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:03,910
He can't do it.

269
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:08,430
He's greedy and corrupted.

270
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:09,390
Those

271
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:12,140
are just slanders.

272
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:15,270
Wang Zemin is very rich.

273
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,680
His family is loaded.

274
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,740
How could he use the magistrate position

275
00:17:19,869 --> 00:17:21,099
to make more money?

276
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:22,980
If you hire him,

277
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,200
I will get rid of him.

278
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:27,349
Alright.

279
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:28,930
How about this?

280
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:30,030
No. 90

281
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:31,490
won't make any proposals.

282
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:32,390
Mr. Li,

283
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:34,340
tell the Civil Affairs Bureau

284
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,920
to propose a candidate.

285
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:38,700
Zhifei.

286
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:42,470
Although "pacification" operation bureau

287
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:45,070
of Kunshan, Changshou and Taicang

288
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:48,600
report directly to the Pacification Operation
Committee,

289
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,890
the work of "pacification" operation

290
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:54,020
needs a lot of local support.

291
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:55,880
That's why

292
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:57,780
all local agent stations

293
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:59,950
should participate in the selection

294
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:01,150
of local officials.

295
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:05,910
It's also something that the highest leader
has endorsed.

296
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:08,960
We ought to follow.

297
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:09,670
Got it.

298
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,340
Mr. Kondo.

299
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:16,020
Gu Xixing.

300
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:18,740
If Gu Xixing is willing to,

301
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:20,700
he'll be the most ideal candidate.

302
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,390
But the problem is

303
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,670
No. 90 has been trying to persuade him
for six months,

304
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:27,410
he rejected us for six months.

305
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:28,790
What could we do?

306
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,870
We can't keep the position of the magistrate
of Wu County

307
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:32,750
vacant while waiting for him.

308
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:34,490
How about this?

309
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:36,550
I think

310
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:38,550
we can let...

311
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:39,310
Wang Zemin.

312
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:40,630
Wang Zemin

313
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:44,150
will take over the acting magistrate for
a while.

314
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:44,920
Is that okay?

315
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:48,110
Gu Xixing's son

316
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:49,540
is now working for No. 90.

317
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,470
I think this means Gu Xixing

318
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:52,830
is softening his stance.

319
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:55,510
You Chinese all care about your reputation.

320
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:56,550
You want face.

321
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:59,350
Since Gu Yizhong is willing to enter No. 90,

322
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:01,990
Gu Xixing could be the magistrate of Wu
County.

323
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:06,440
That's not necessarily true.

324
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:09,600
The Yamato people always rise above the
difficulties.

325
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:12,310
Many examples can prove that.

326
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:16,680
For example, building a peace government
along the riverside.

327
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:19,510
Besides, you guys,

328
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:23,110
Chen Gongbo, Zhou Fohai, Ding,

329
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:25,590
and you, Mr. Li,

330
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:28,200
didn't you all get in the water?

331
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:34,840
That's too much!

332
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:35,850
Major Kondo.

333
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:39,420
I won't allow you to slander Mr. Li.

334
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:43,640
Mr. Li is devoted to the peace movement.

335
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:46,360
He has always been considerate of Japan.

336
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:49,010
I hope you can apologize.

337
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:53,310
Zhifei.

338
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:00,250
In that case,

339
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,960
I'll leave the candidate of the magistrate
of Wu County

340
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:08,390
to be decided by Major Kondo.

341
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:11,440
I have something else to do.

342
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:14,380
I won't ask Mr. Kondo to stay for dinner.

343
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:37,970
His name is Cui Yaomin.

344
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:41,670
He came from Shanghai to meet us.

345
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:45,130
He claimed that he could buy quinine with
his connections.

346
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:47,190
You got it?

347
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:52,190
He's not our man.

348
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:54,500
He is a middleman.

349
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:59,090
He's a student of the famous Du Yuesheng
from Shanghai.

350
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,520
After Du Yuesheng fled to Hong Kong,

351
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,890
he was appointed to take care of

352
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:07,010
everything at Shanghai Pier.

353
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:11,190
It is said that he has many connections.

354
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:14,230
Chongqing and Nanjing

355
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,180
both respect him a bit.

356
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:20,440
Is this two-faced person reliable?

357
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:24,520
With money, you can ask him to do anything.

358
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:26,770
It works on him.

359
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:32,740
I found him

360
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:34,100
through a connection in Shanghai.

361
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:38,590
The old scalpers were either arrested or
fled away.

362
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:41,910
Only he has some connections

363
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,370
who are willing to deal with us.

364
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,450
When will he arrive?

365
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:47,310
Tomorrow.

366
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:49,230
Two in the afternoon.

367
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:51,360
Caizhi Pavilion Tea House.

368
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:53,630
Okay.

369
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:56,110
I'll meet him

370
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:58,630
by then.

371
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:00,490
Bring a copy of Jiangsu Daily.

372
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:04,390
He will have a copy of Shanghai News
in front of him.

373
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:07,260
He wants money.

374
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:09,320
No matter what price he offers,

375
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,400
say yes first and we'll discuss it later.

376
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:14,680
Our priority is to buy quinine.

377
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:15,430
Yes.

378
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:19,950
Mr. Li, did you see that?

379
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:23,430
I said I wanted to stay with you,

380
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:26,440
but you sent me to No. 90 in Suzhou.

381
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:28,480
How did he treat me?

382
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:30,040
The Japanese.

383
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:32,730
He looks down on us.

384
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:33,910
Zhifei.

385
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:36,910
You've never

386
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:38,790
worked at No. 76.

387
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:42,830
Not to mention a Japanese Major,

388
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:45,790
even an ordinary soldier

389
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:49,030
can piss Ding and me off.

390
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:52,220
Peace National Movement.

391
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:56,630
We must be firm.

392
00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:01,190
What should we do with Wang Zemin?

393
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,690
We'll make things work out sooner or later.

394
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:08,030
Let's put it aside

395
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:09,710
for now.

396
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:12,510
A few days ago,

397
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:15,650
I asked Jinhai to send some gifts to your
residence.

398
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:17,750
They're from Wang Zemin.

399
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:20,310
I received the gifts.

400
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:22,870
Ask him to stop sending them.

401
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:24,180
It's okay.

402
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:27,910
If wealthy people like them are willing to
contribute,

403
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:29,190
just let them do so.

404
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:30,450
It doesn't matter.

405
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:32,910
I think Kondo

406
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:34,510
is the most troublesome.

407
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:36,020
He just wouldn't listen.

408
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:37,530
I told him Gu Xixing

409
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:38,510
is stubborn.

410
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:39,640
He wouldn't listen.

411
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,470
Gu Xixing.

412
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:46,660
He doesn't consider the face of Chairman
Wang.

413
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:49,100
He's just a Japanese Major.

414
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,880
What can he do with it?

415
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:54,670
If he wants to try,

416
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,270
Just let him do it.

417
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:59,630
He'll come back to you

418
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:01,330
once he reaches a dead end.

419
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:02,910
By then,

420
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:05,450
he will understand

421
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,360
that this is China.

422
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:14,070
If he leaves us on our land,

423
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:16,530
the Japanese won't able to

424
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:18,480
do anything without us.

425
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:20,030
Right.

426
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:24,630
Let these Japanese understand

427
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:28,630
that nothing can be done

428
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:32,470
without our support.

429
00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:56,480
What are you doing?

430
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:58,440
What are you doing?

431
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:00,420
You got the wrong person.

432
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,610
Xinzhai.

433
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:06,900
Why are you in such a hurry to see Sir?

434
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:09,270
Mr. Kondo went out early in the morning.

435
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:12,830
Did the big fish confess?

436
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:15,670
Why are you running?

437
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:17,270
Why are you being so distant?

438
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:19,030
Mr. Li is here.

439
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:20,770
He came to Suzhou for work inspection.

440
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:22,070
Director and Mr. Kondo

441
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:23,350
all went to Li Mansion.

442
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:27,120
That's strange.

443
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:31,790
Didn't they invite you?

444
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:36,580
Section Chief Lian, you're joking.

445
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,440
They...

446
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:46,270
The man's name is Cui Yaomin.

447
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:47,500
He's from Shanghai.

448
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,410
I heard that he's meeting someone

449
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:51,030
from CPC tomorrow afternoon.

450
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:51,960
What else did he confess?

451
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,110
That's all I heard.

452
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:55,190
Huang Xinzhai asked me to leave.

453
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:03,110
Yizhong, get changed quickly.

454
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:04,150
We got operation.

455
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,110
Where is my gun?

456
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:14,640
You weren't given a gun.

457
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:22,540
Where are we going?

458
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:23,800
What is the operation?

459
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:25,150
It's a secret.

[Sino-Japanese Relations]

461
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:29,790
Gu Yizhong.

462
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:32,640
Where are you taking the prisoner?

463
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:34,240
A secret operation.

464
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,300
What secret operation?

465
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:37,050
Cui got a lot of intelligence to offer.

466
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,410
[Sino-Japanese Relations]

467
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:37,860
Take him back.

00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:38,990
Vice Director Huang.

469
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:41,950
It was Director Zhou who wanted to interrogate
Cui.

470
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:43,750
Mr. Kondo is waiting for me

471
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:44,950
to interrogate Cui.

472
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:45,930
Take him back.

473
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:47,430
Let the Japanese wait then.

474
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:47,960
Let's go!

475
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:49,190
I'm not going.

Go!

477
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:56,950
Sir,

478
00:26:57,650 --> 00:26:59,590
Cui Yaomin confessed

479
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:01,630
that he made a deal with the New Fourth Army

480
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:02,630
to trade quinine.

481
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:03,820
Quinine?

482
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:04,680
Quinine.

483
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:06,340
If we investigate him,

484
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:07,990
maybe we can find

485
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:10,320
an information network of intelligence.

486
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:12,450
Even Lian Jinhai takes credit for it.

487
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:16,520
Sir, I felt very wronged.

488
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,810
Zhou told me that Cui Yaomin

489
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:23,950
was going to meet someone from CPC.

490
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:26,910
It might be a big fish, Sir.

491
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:27,860
Zhou said this is

492
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:30,190
a good opportunity to test if Gu Yizhong

493
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:32,520
is still colluding with the Communist Party.

494
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,320
I agree.

495
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:37,890
Gu Yizhong doesn't look like an accomplice.

496
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:39,950
That's not important.

497
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:40,830
Right.

498
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:41,970
What matters is whether

499
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:44,410
Gu Xixing takes part in the peace movement.

500
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:47,750
Now Gu Yizhong is a bait.

501
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:49,440
It doesn't matter if he works for the
Communist Party.

502
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,680
It doesn't matter if he saves people
from Communist Party.

503
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,010
As long as he's exposed,

504
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:53,950
we can use him

505
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:55,500
to threaten Gu Xixing.

506
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:58,720
Yes.

507
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:03,350

508
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:04,190

520

00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:42,470
or a test.

What's the big deal of being an agent?

569

What's the big deal of being an agent?

570
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:53,790
Enough.

If you didn't go today,

I might not have a chance to come back.

I saw Gu Yizhong today.

He was with No. 90.

645
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:05,830
Based on your relationship with Gu Yizhong,

646
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:08,430
it's understandable

647
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,230
that you don't believe he's a traitor.

648
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:19,560

649
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,690
I hope you to be rational

00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,470
in this matter.

652
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:00,350
and almost got arrested.

653

Gu Yizhong was

00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,290
among the agents in the operation.

655
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:14,470
Are you sure?

656
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:16,790
I knew that Gu Yizhong

657
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:19,790
didn't die a few days ago.

658
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:22,890
Eagle has informers too.

659
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,330
He saw him going back

660
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:27,360
to Gu's Garden with people from No. 90.

661
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,160
I couldn't prove it at the time,

662
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:30,860
so I didn't tell you.

663
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:35,780
He's not dead.

664
00:37:36,850 --> 00:37:37,850
Then why did my dad

665
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:40,350
hold a funeral for him?

666
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:44,390
Father, you knew

667
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:46,830
that Gu Yizhong was still alive.

668
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:49,320
Yes.

669
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,720
He went to No. 90 to be a traitor.

670
00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:56,120
You knew that too.

671
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:03,230
Yes.

672
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,810
Dad, I don't understand

673
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,320
How could you let him do that?

674
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:14,990
What is a traitor?

675
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:17,470
That's a lackey of the Japanese.

676
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:18,930
You told us about the four social values

677
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:20,310
and eight virtues since we were young.

678
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:21,840
To be filial piety, brotherly love, loyalty, integrity,

679
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,510
propriety, righteousness, probity, and a sense of shame!

680
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:25,470
He became a disgrace to the Gu family.

681
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:26,530
Take a look at this.

682
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:33,640
This was from when we were kids.

683
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:35,830
You still kept it?

684
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:40,890
Do you remember this?

685
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:48,450
[Practice makes you famous, reasonably reassured]

686
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:49,180
These are Yizhong's shoes when he was young.

687
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:51,390
You bought them for him

688
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:53,880
when he was nine.

689
00:38:58,880 --> 00:38:59,990
Your mother told me

690
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:02,360
you saved up pocket money for a year

691
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,310
in order to buy these shoes.

692
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:08,230
He wore these shoes

693
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:11,230
and ran around the street,

694
00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:13,480
yelling

695
00:39:14,290 --> 00:39:16,700
"My sister bought this pair for me."

696
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:19,010
Since young,

697
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:23,720
you've been protecting and helping him.

698
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:26,590
You were afraid he'd get hurt.

699
00:39:27,350 --> 00:39:29,010
You even helped him in a fight.

700
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:31,350
I don't understand

701
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:34,870
now that you've grown up,

702
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:39,120
how did things end up like this?

703
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:43,190
Father.

704
00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:47,390
I have my belief,

705
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:49,390
and my responsibility.

706
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:50,750
Right.

707
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:53,030
You have your belief.

708
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:55,910
I won't stop you

from your anti-Japanese work.

710
00:39:59,150 --> 00:39:59,710
But if

711
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:01,750
you still think me as your father,

712
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:04,550
promise me one thing.

713
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:08,470
What is it?

714
00:40:08,930 --> 00:40:10,190
You have to promise me.

715
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:12,930
Huizhong,

716
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:16,440
you are a mother now.

717
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:18,760
You should know

718
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:23,500
parents and siblings are connected by blood.

719
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,740
No matter how great the belief is,

720
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,750
we can't live without family.

721
00:40:30,270 --> 00:40:32,190
We cannot abandon family.

722
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:35,670
Keep these shoes.

723
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:37,390
Remember,

724
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:41,150
no matter when,

725
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:43,430
no matter what,

726
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:47,230
Yizhong will always be your brother.

727
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:49,990
You are his sister.

728
00:41:49,650 --> 00:41:55,420
[Who is number eight? 90.]

[If you don't get in touch with me within a
week, I'll make it public]

730

We might lose the clue of Cell 8.

731
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:23,710
Don't we have

732
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:25,110
his dark secret contact?

733
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:27,600
I contacted him twice,

734
00:42:28,270 --> 00:42:29,350
but no reply.

735
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,710
Could it be that he hasn't returned to
Suzhou?

736
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:33,190
No.

737
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:34,900
He is in Suzhou.
