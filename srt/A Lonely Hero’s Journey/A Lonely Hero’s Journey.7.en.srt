[Episode 7]

4
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:24,770
To find the traitor,

5
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:26,430
you must join No. 90

6
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:28,829
and obtain Cell 8's info.

7
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:48,190
We'll reclaim the three northeastern provinces

8
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:49,590
and defeat the invaders!

9
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:51,810
We must unite and fight against Japan!

10
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,100
Stop the civil war

11
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:54,720
and fight against the invaders!

12
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,110
Come on.

13
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,710
Yizhong, come on.

14
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:05,850
To keep you amused.

15
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,990
My senior and I

16
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:11,280
grew up together in Pennsylvania.

17
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,610
Jinhai!

18
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:39,030
What are you eating?

19
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,160
I made some noodles.

20
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:43,430
Take better care of yourself.

21
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,500
How's it going?

22
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:49,240
We’ve checked

23
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,430
all major hospitals in Suzhou,

24
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,360
but there's no trace of Gu Yizhong.

25
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:54,990
Since they're putting on an act, they'll go all the way.

26
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:57,190
They won't send him to large hospitals.

27
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:02,350
Then, could he still be hiding in Gu's Garden?

28
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:07,550
Gu Yizhong is badly injured.

29
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:09,110
If he was in Gu's Garden,

30
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:12,070
we should be able to see a doctor coming in or out.

31
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:14,950
No, no record of any doctor coming or going.

32
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:17,630
This is strange.

33
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,390
Zhifei.

34
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:26,870
Since Ms. Ou knows Gu Yizhong is still alive,

35
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:28,760
she should know where he is.

36
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:30,560
Why don't we ask her?

37
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,350
Do you not feel ashamed enough?

38
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:33,630
We can't even find a half-dead man

39
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:35,310
in Suzhou,

40
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:37,150
and we still need to ask for CBIS's help?

41
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:38,480
What were you thinking?

42
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,710
Isn't his uncle a doctor?

43
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:45,870
Yes, his uncle works at Zhaohe Hospital.

44
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:46,790
Did you check him?

45
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:47,470
Yes.

46
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:48,750
The first thing I did was send Li Jiuzhao

47
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,670
to check Zhaohe Hospital. Nothing suspicious.

48
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:52,710
That Dr. Lu studied in Germany.

49
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:54,560
He's very smart.

50
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:56,790
I doubt he would place Gu Yizhong

51
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:57,830
in a public ward.

52
00:04:58,390 --> 00:04:59,750
Jinhai, take people

53
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:01,040
to check there yourself.

54
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,700
The capital's air force engaged the enemy in aerial combat.

55
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,630
Two enemy aircraft, both light bombers,

56
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:07,750
were shot down.

57
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:11,940
After their defeat, the enemy forces scattered and retreated.

58
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:14,000
They failed to approach the capital.

59
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,370
Uncle Gu, is the news true?

60
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:21,000
We get the Shanghai News from the Shanghai Concession.

61
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:24,390
It's the only newspaper we can trust now,

62
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:27,240
unlike Jiangsu Daily,

63
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:29,400
which is full of nonsense all the time.

64
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,110
Then it's true.

65
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:33,990
Haimo,

66
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:36,790
you seem very interested in news

67
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:37,960
about our Air Force.

68
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:41,710
Did someone you know serve in the Air Force?

69
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:42,830
No.

70
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,870
Uncle Gu, I'll go check

71
00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:47,310
if your decoction is ready.

72
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:47,830
Okay.

73
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:55,310
Division Commander, there are signs that someone

74
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:56,570
has come to the Young Master's tomb.

75
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:58,550
I asked the neighbors,

76
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:00,350
and they said that they saw some men

77
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:02,480
sneaking around there two nights ago.

78
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:05,310
They might be from No. 90.

79
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:06,260
Yes.

80
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:07,760
If they open the coffin,

81
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:08,830
they'll find out.

82
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:14,890
How is Yizhong's injury?

83
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,510
He's recovering well, but...

84
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:19,990
he's not in the best of spirits.

85
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:21,060
He's not in the best of spirits?

86
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:21,720
Yes.

87
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:27,450
Ask him to go to Hong Kong as soon as possible.

88
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:28,950
The latest cruise to Hong Kong

89
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:30,270
will depart in a week.

90
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:35,110
Then ask him to hide in the Shanghai Concession for a couple of days.

91
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:36,720
Got it. I'm on it now.

Dad, since ancient times, it has been hard to balance loyalty and filial piety.

Our family motto is "Filial Piety, Brotherly Love, Loyalty, and Integrity."

159

I can't achieve filial piety and brotherly love.

Let me at least fulfill the values of loyalty and integrity.

161
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:47,150
What good is there in upholding only loyalty and integrity,

162
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:51,150
if we abandon propriety, righteousness,  probity, and a sense of shame?

00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:09,670

00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:03,190
the undercover "Cell 8"

188
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:05,850
in the Communist Party, right in front of No. 90.

189
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:08,390
Cell 8?

190
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:16,780
Gu Yizhong, I knew you'd be alive.

191
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:18,870
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

192
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:20,920
Mr. Kondo wants to see you.

193
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:22,670
Mr. Gu, please.

194
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:35,010
Mr. Kondo,

195
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:37,610
Gu Yizhong has something to tell you.

196
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,270
Let him in.

197
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:43,180
Come on.

198
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:52,190
Are you Cell 8?

199
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:53,700
I'm not.

200
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,970
But not only you,

201
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:59,820
the New Fourth Army is also after me.

202
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:01,350
In their eyes,

203
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:03,840
I'm Cell 8.

204
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:07,430
Since you had a narrow escape,

205
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:10,140
you can choose to go to Shanghai or Hong Kong.

206
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,790
Why did you come to us?

207
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,870
I don't want to hide

208
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,340
and live in the dark

209
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:18,990
like a street rat.

210
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,190
I want to join No. 90!

211
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:26,520
The one we need is your father,

212
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:28,040
not you.

213
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:30,640
Section Chief Lian, hello.

214
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:34,310
Zhifei, Gu Yizhong is here.

215
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,630
I could've shot him just now.

216
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:38,330
But he claimed to be Cell 8.

217
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:40,330
Do you think he's crazy?

218
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:47,710
I didn't kill him with that shot.

219
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:50,370
My father

220
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:53,640
is a soldier who never gives in.

221
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,230
What about you?

222
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:56,410
I want to live.

223
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:58,670
What makes you think

224
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:00,030
that we will accept you?

225
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:03,060
You need me.

226
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:07,510
We don't need anyone.

227
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:11,280
In the past, China had Wang Kemin and Liang Hongzhi,

228
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:16,020
and now you have Wang Jingwei, Chen Gongbo, and Zhou Fohai.

229
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:19,550
Do you want to be like them?

230
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:23,130
I really want to join your agent station!

231
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:36,670
Do you really want to be a traitor

232
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:38,950
like them?

233
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,250
You're acting!

234
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:45,420
No one will risk their life to act.

235
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,400
I'll tear off your mask!

236
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:48,400
Come with me!

237
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:53,830
Aim!

238
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:59,110
Ready!

239
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:09,430
Speak the truth!

240
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:17,910
Mr. Lu Xun said,

241
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:21,470
"Beasts always go alone,

242
00:17:23,869 --> 00:17:25,930
and only cows and sheep form groups."

243
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:29,190
You can't scare me

244
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,510
with this.

245
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:28,230
Jinhai, you can go back to work.

246
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:32,640
Director,

247
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:36,070
Mr. Kondo asked me to bring Yizhong

248
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:37,350
to greet you.

249
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,230
He has decided to join us,

250
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,590
and Mr. Kondo has approved it.

251
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,540
I really don't understand

252
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:59,830
why the Japanese would believe you.

253
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:00,750
They don't,

254
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:02,640
but they know I'm useful.

255
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,100
What's the darn use of you?

256
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:05,910
If so,

257
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,590
it's your father, Gu Xixing, who is of some use to us,

258
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:09,160
not you.

259
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:12,110
Director Zhou, everyone knows the use of the useful,

260
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,480
not the use of the useless.

261
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:20,200
Can your theory about usefulness or uselessness

262
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:21,830
save your life?

263
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:25,920
Once you've faced death, you're not afraid anymore.

264
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,070
Guys, you should stop bickering.

265
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:32,390
Yizhong, let's go.

266
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,670
The car is ready downstairs.

267
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:36,830
Director, I have to go back with him

268
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:38,690
to Gu's Garden to get his luggage.

269
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:58,350
Okay, Mr. Gu,

270
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:00,210
welcome to No. 90.

271
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:05,410
He still needs your guidance in the future.

272
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:06,670
Yizhong?

273
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:08,030
Yizhong!

274
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:16,400
Do you think it's really that easy

275
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,310
to be a traitor?

276
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:20,430
Or do you think anyone

277
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:22,000
can leave No. 90 alive?

278
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:26,970
You're on your own now.

279
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:29,250
Take care.

280
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:30,610
You too.

281
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:33,790
Take care.

282
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:41,210
In today's world, everyone should take care of themselves.

283
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:43,590
Director, I'll leave you to it.

284
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:51,050
Sir, Gu Yizhong is not trustworthy.

285
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:53,160
I suspect he is a spy

286
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:54,330
sent by the Communist Party.

287
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:55,790
What evidence do you have?

288
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:57,230
It's my speculation.

289
00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:00,020
I think he came to No. 90

290
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,910
to find out who Cell 8 is.

291
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:05,390
I don't even know who Cell 8 is.

292
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:07,150
Can he find it?

293
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:09,110
Zhou,

294
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:13,250
do you not have confidence in your ability to keep secrets?

295
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:16,270
I'm certainly confident about that.

296
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:17,430
However, I still suspect

297
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:19,540
that Gu Yizhong has ulterior motives.

298
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:21,750
I also doubt if his heart

299
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:24,830
is true to our Empire of Japan.

300
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:28,030
Are you truly loyal to our Empire?

301
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:29,510
Also, are Lian Jinhai and Huang Xinzhai

302
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:30,780
all truly loyal to our Empire?

303
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:33,010
All the Chinese people close to us

304
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,570
are all for their own interests.

305
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:37,140
In order to survive,

306
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:39,150
Gu Yizhong risks Gu Xixing and Gu's Garden's reputation

307
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:40,570
to join the peace movement.

308
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:41,830
If you didn't take him in,

309
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:43,270
don't you think it'd make us petty?

310
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:45,950
How could we start the Greater East Asian War?

311
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:49,250
How can we convince the people of Suzhou to believe us?

312
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:58,230
Our slogan is

313
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:02,470
"Sincerely cooperate to promote Japan and China together."

314
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:05,470
Letting Gu Yizhong join No. 90

315
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:10,070
is the same as asking your son to study in Kyoto.

316
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:12,880
They're all friendly gestures

317
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:15,350
from the Empire as a good neighbor and friend.

318
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:15,990
Yes.

319
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:18,650
Also,

320
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,760
we have received a letter from Kyoto.

321
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:26,530
Your son is doing very well at school there.

322
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,750
Like father, like son.

323
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,850
Thanks for the Empire's cultivation.

324
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,200
Report!

325
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:40,520
Come in.

326
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:48,990
Huang,

327
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:53,300
Zhou Zhifei is suspicious of Gu Yizhong's sincerity.

328
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:56,830
You analyze whether his sincerity is genuine.

329
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:00,790
If it's genuine,

330
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:02,650
Gu Yizhong came to us too suddenly.

331
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:04,450
He doesn't have enough reasons.

332
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:05,750
If it's fake,

333
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:07,780
participating in the peace movement

334
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:09,430
is no joke.

335
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:11,650
Gu Yizhong can escape at any time.

336
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:13,950
So,

337
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:16,550
I... I really can't figure out

338
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:19,030
if he's genuine to us or not.

339
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,320
Please enlighten me, sir.

340
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:24,420
It's fake.

341
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:26,670
I see.

342
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:31,510
Then, you still want to keep him?

343
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:33,340
I want to make the fake real.

344
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:37,330
Both Gu and his son will have to serve the Empire of Japan.

345
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:39,630
430,000 citizens of Suzhou

346
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,440
will have to participate in the peace movement

347
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,120
and become good citizens of the Empire of Japan.

348
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:48,250
Now I understand.

349
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:50,970
Sir, you are the one

350
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:52,450
with a hidden motive here.

351
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,550
Gu Yizhong is a hostage,

352
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:57,920
after he comes to No. 90.

353
00:23:57,990 --> 00:23:59,150
Then Gu Xixing will have no choice

354
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:00,960
but to take office

355
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:02,760
as the magistrate of Wu County.

356
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:05,070
If he still won't take office this time,

357
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:07,230
kill both Gu and his son.

358
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:08,830
Both of them, dead!

359
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:11,350
Yes!

360
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:57,390
What's going on?

361
00:24:57,690 --> 00:24:58,740
Didn't they say that Young Master Gu

362
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:00,780
was dead a few days ago?

363
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:03,710
Why did the Gu family

364
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:04,750
have such scum?

365
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:07,170
What is he doing with the people from No. 90?

366
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:10,510
How can you still be in the mood to fondle your pipa?

367
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:12,110
The Gu family is in chaos now!

368
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,670
Thank God, you two aren't married.

369
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:28,720
Otherwise, our reputation wouldn't be able to

370
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,870

The Investigation Department is responsible for security and assassination.

555

and secret identities.

00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:14,720
Among the skills of a secret agent,

560
00:38:14,810 --> 00:38:17,260
shadowing is a very important task.

561
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:19,120
It's also called stalking.

562
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:21,540
It means we need to

563
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,150
recognize the face and figure out

564
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:25,150
the identity of the person we're following.

565
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:28,140
This requires us to learn how to protect ourselves

566
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:29,950
and be skilled at disguises

567
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:31,080

What is the source of the information?

573
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:12,750
We're commonly said to rely on internal cells.

574
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:18,070
How can we build an internal cell?

575
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:20,010
There are two key aspects of the work,

To make people from the other side ours,

582
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:50,430
we must have evidence of their dirt.

they would be dead by now.

00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:46,950
we can’t stay here anymore.

605
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:48,230
How about we run away?

606
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:51,310
Why are you here?

607
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:54,500
To be an agent.

I'm sorry. I should call you Young Master Gao.
