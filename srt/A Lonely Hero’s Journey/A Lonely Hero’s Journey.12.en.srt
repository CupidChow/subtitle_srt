I have come to deeply understand the sincerity and kindness of the Gu family.

00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:38,740
It is heartbreaking

203

Mr. Gu, don't be modest.

Just tell the truth.

248
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:01,910
This is a typical Suzhou-style bonsai technique.

249
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:03,460
It features coarse wiring and fine pruning.

250
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:06,340
The artist has styled it to resemble a tree

251
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:09,070

254
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:17,040
But the stand is incorrect.

255
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:21,730
Suzhou bonsai emphasizes

256
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:23,790
the combination of three elements:

257
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:27,390
the scene, the pot, and the stand.

258
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,820
These three must complement each other; none can be missing.

259
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:33,190
This round pot paired with a hexagonal stand

260
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:34,990
seems somewhat uncoordinated.

261
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:39,100
If you could replace it with a Ming dynasty-style square stand,

262
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:41,560
it would better highlight the bonsai's solitary elegance

263
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:44,020

00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:41,630
It was my fault.

378
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:43,190
Mr. Li called me yesterday,

379
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,830
and I got so busy that I forgot about it.

380
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:46,240
I forgot to mention it to my wife.

381
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,080
Have a seat.

382
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:47,800
That's good.

383
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,820
Otherwise, I would have been too rude.

384
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:50,800
It's no trouble at all.

385
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,230
Our guest room is available.

386
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:53,510
It's on the second floor,

387
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:54,990
next to our son's room.

388
00:24:57,870 --> 00:24:58,670
Zhou,

389
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:02,560
keep Miss Weng company.

390
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:03,830
I'll go to the kitchen

391
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:04,840
to remind them

392
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:06,670
to prepare a few extra good dishes for the evening

393
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:08,150
so we can have a drink together.

394
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:08,630
Okay.

395
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:14,510
What do you want?

396
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,710
Haven't you been inquiring about my address?

397
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:19,640
You don't need to inquire anymore.

398
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:22,520
If Kondo finds out you're at my house,

399
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:24,200
either you die or I die.

400
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:25,150
Leave now.

401
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:26,070
Don't stay at my house.

402
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:27,270
I came here with no intention of leaving.

403
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:28,620
I forgot to ask that...

404
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:32,000
She doesn't eat spicy food.

405
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:34,870
Yes, I'm from Guangdong. I'm not used to eating spicy food.

406
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:36,920
Right, I just came out to ask

407
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:38,790
if Miss Weng has any dietary restrictions.

408
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:40,470
Well, don't add chili to the dishes tonight.

409
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:40,910
Okay.

410
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:43,110
Zhou?

411
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:45,930
Come over and see

412
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:47,390
if the fish needs scaling.

413
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:48,070
Okay.

414
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:50,070
Excuse me.

415
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:57,930
Is she really Mr. Li's friend?

416
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:00,570
Could she be my friend?

417
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:02,590
Maybe.

418
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:04,670
You seemed off

419
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:05,890
when you saw her.

420
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:07,630
No.

421
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:09,730
Zhou Zhifei,

422
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:12,700
don't mess around.

423
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:15,360
I'll call Shanghai later

424
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:16,590
and ask Mrs. Li.

425
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:17,670
Don't.

426
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:20,390
I guessed it right, didn't I?

427
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:22,550
She's a mistress.

428
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:26,430
Is she Mr. Li's mistress?

429
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:28,390
How did you know?

430
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,320
Let me tell you.

431
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,240
A woman's intuition is the most accurate.

432
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,270
The moment I saw her,

433
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,490
I could tell.

434
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:39,620
Mr. Li's friend?

435
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:41,220
She's not a proper friend.

436
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:42,290
Keep your voice down.

437
00:26:42,290 --> 00:26:43,320
Let me tell you.

438
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:45,320
When Mrs. Li

439
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,710
came to Suzhou for cards a few days ago,

440
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:47,770
she mentioned that

441
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,520
Mr. Li had been coming home late

442
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:53,740
and smelled of perfume.

443
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:56,420
Just keep this to yourself.

444
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:58,000
Don't tell anyone else.

445
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:59,870
Of course I won't.

446
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:02,080
I certainly dare not offend your boss.

447
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:04,730
I won't call her.

448
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:06,450
Besides,

449
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:09,830
Miss Weng is a nice person.

450
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:13,950
Who gave it to you?

451
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:17,260
It's flawless.

452
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:20,130
You just met her, and you accepted her gift?

453
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:21,430
Give it back to her.

454
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:23,300
You're unwilling to spend on it.

455
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:26,070
This bracelet is worth two gold bars

456
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:27,710
at Ying's Jade Shop.

457
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:29,910
Miss Weng.

458
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:33,090
Are you familiar with Suzhou?

459
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:34,390
Not really.

460
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:36,360
It's alright, I'm here to help.

461
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:38,990
Suzhou is extremely cold

462
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:40,560
this winter,

463
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,430
but there are still plenty of places

464
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:43,490
to eat and have fun.

465
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:46,030
Well, thank you, Mrs. Zhou.

466
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:47,580
Not at all.

467
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:02,260
Brother, can you teach me to play chess?

468
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:04,650
Yu!

469
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:07,870
He killed his own dad.

470
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:09,270
Don't play with him!

471
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:10,270
Go! Let's go home!

472
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,250
Take her back.

473
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:18,360
Don't get close to my daughter!

474
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:34,050
If you need anything,

475
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,000
just tell Mrs. Liu.

476
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:37,290
Make yourself at home.

477
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,230
Thank you.

478
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:40,230
It's nothing.

479
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:44,430
Let me tell you.

480
00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:47,190
Mr. Li

481
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:49,680
has been taking good care of Zhou.

482
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:51,300
If Zhou

483
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:53,960
gets something good outside,

484
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:56,380
the first person he thinks of is Mr. Li,

485
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:57,870
not me.

486
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:00,710
Mr. Li really is a nice person.

487
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:03,710
Men who do great things are all like this.

488
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:05,610
You are so lucky, Mrs. Zhou.

489
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:07,160
Don't call me Mrs. Zhou.

490
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:08,590
It's too formal.

491
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:09,730
Call me Yuqing.

492
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:11,110
Mrs. Liu,

493
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,430
can you make the bed quickly

494
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:15,580
so that Yuanhe can rest early?

495
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:25,470
Sleep early.

496
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,290
I have something to tell you, Zhou.

497
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:08,390
Xiaolan sent a letter from Yixing today.

498
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:09,910
Really?

499
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:13,890
How is she doing in Yixing?

500
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:20,590
She said she wanted to remarry.

501
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:21,470
Remarry?

502
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:23,510
Who is she going to marry?

503
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:26,270
She said she's going to marry a doctor.

504
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:31,230
We need to give them a cash gift.

505
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:31,910
No.

506
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:35,560
It hasn't been long since Jinhai passed away.

507
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:38,340
We'll keep sending the money

508
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:40,250
for Jinhai's son every month.

509
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:50,230
Do you think Mrs. Li

510
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:53,070
knows about Miss Weng?

511
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,030
If she knew,

512
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:57,030
would she be here?

513
00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:59,770
Mrs. Li is not someone to be trifled with,

514
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:03,300
but Mr. Li really has a lot of nerve.

515
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:05,470
Even though his wife keeps such a tight watch on him,

516
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:07,130
he still dares to mess around.

517
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:10,680
He caused trouble in Shanghai and moved it to Suzhou.

518
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:12,670
Last year,

519
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:14,720
Mrs. Li took

520
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:16,320
Wu Sibao's wife, She Aizhen,

521
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,230
and a whole group of spies' wives

522
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:21,430
to find Liu Xiujuan

523
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:24,560
at the Outer Group of No. 76, right?

524
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:28,080
It was reported in the tabloids, and everyone knew about it.

525
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:30,270
And now, not long after,

526
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:34,520
Mr. Li has returned to his previous behavior.

527
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:40,000
Don't worry about

528
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:41,630
other people's matters.

529
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:42,910
Anyway,

530
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:44,510
just tell the subordinates that...

531
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:45,750
I know.

532
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:47,640
Cousin.

533
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:52,430
Zhou,

534
00:31:53,790 --> 00:31:55,110
is Miss Weng

535
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:57,790
also a spy?

536
00:31:58,510 --> 00:32:00,590
Only Mr. Li knows about that.

537
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:03,110
The way she looks at people

538
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,200
is so sharp.

539
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:13,340
You should talk less

540
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:15,230
with her at home

541
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:19,170
and avoid gossiping about other people's affairs.

542
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:21,270
I'm worried that

543
00:32:21,290 --> 00:32:23,150
Mr. Li might not want us to...

544
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:07,060
Ji is next door.

545
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,060
Why are you afraid of everything?

546
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:13,540
You are afraid of the Japanese,

547
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:14,670
afraid of your wife.

548
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:17,870
Now you are even afraid of me.

549
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:22,310
You weren't like this before.

550
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,350
Xinping.

551
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:28,990
Zhifei.

552
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:31,570
Many things have happened to me these years.

553
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:33,730
You don't understand.

554
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:37,960
They sent my son

555
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,040
to Japan to study.

556
00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:43,100
But it's actually just to use him as a hostage.

557
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:44,870
My agent station

558
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:47,550
is full of Mr. Li's informants,

559
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,670
lackeys of the Japanese,

560
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,590
and people from the NBIS.

561
00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:56,470
Now even the New Fourth Army has infiltrated.

562
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:58,230
It's really difficult for me.

563
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:00,510
I'm in a dilemma.

I always think of you.

00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,810
