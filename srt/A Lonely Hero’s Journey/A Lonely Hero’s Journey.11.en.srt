00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,670
If you're interested,

5
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,539
why don't we imitate Bai Juyi—

6
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,330
enjoy the moon, drink tea,

7
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:48,950
play the zither, and sing together?

8
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:50,479
Wouldn't it be delightful?

9
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:17,930
Yes, he's here.

10
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:19,680
Got it.

11
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,150
It's from Director Zhou.

12
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:28,030
He wants you to see him in the meeting room immediately.

13
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:30,230
He has something important to discuss.

14
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:59,630
Gao Hu, keep an eye on him.

15
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:07,310
Go in.

16
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:10,150
I really admire

17
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:12,030
what you did during the Northern Expedition.

18
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:13,430
If you have time,

19
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:15,180
can you come to No. 90

20
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:17,230
to teach our comrades

21
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:18,880
and share your experience?

22
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:25,820
Yizhong, you're here.

23
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:33,310
Yizhong.

24
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:34,790
Come on in.

25
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:46,590
Yizhong, your father really cares about you.

26
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:49,180
How is your injury?

27
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:58,250
Director Zhou, what are you doing?

28
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:03,630
I want to verify something.

29
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:06,660
Master Gu,

30
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:08,430
weren't you afraid of

31
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:11,270
killing your son by that shooting?

32
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,230
Everyone can

33
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:18,070
kill a traitor.

34
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:20,050
Stop putting on a play.

35
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,990
The act of "Execution at the Military Gate"

36
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:24,150
was so real

37
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,470
that I almost believed it.

38
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,070
Did this bullet

39
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:32,240
come out of your gun?

40
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:33,710
The model matches.

41
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:36,230
At the scene,

42
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,780
if everyone's testimony is correct,

43
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:41,340
you only shot once.

44
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,510
But this bullet

45
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:45,409
was found in the pillar

46
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,570
of your Gu's Garden.

47
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:49,400
Then, here comes the question. Mr. Gu,

48
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:52,190
what's with your gunshot wound?

49
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,630
If you were shot in this part,

50
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:57,770
you wouldn't have stopped bleeding.

51
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:02,030
Director Zhou, don't beat around the bush.

52
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:08,890
Kondo is disappointed in you.

53
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:11,950
Your Gu's Garden looks beautiful,

54
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:13,870
but there are secrets hidden.

55
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:17,340
It's not like that Japanese man is your father.

56
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:18,610
Why do you obey him so?

57
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:21,430
You can't say that.

58
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:25,460
I have a job at No. 90.

59
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:26,970
I just obey my superior.

60
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:28,970
You were a soldier.

61
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:30,340

I admire the way you conduct yourself,

64
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:37,790
so I want to persuade you.

65
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:39,390
Of course,

66
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:41,520
this is also Mr. Kondo's intention.

67
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:44,260
Are you willing

68
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:46,870
to be the magistrate of Wu County?

69
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:50,180
What do you think?

70
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:52,400
I think you can consider it.

71
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:56,310
I...

72
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,150
would rather die.

73
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:03,810
Master Gu,

74
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:06,990
I hope you can understand the current situation.

75
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,610
Please reconsider it.

76
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:09,250

I can't help you then.

79

Once again, on behalf of me,

80
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:22,020
I pay my respects to you.

81
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:25,050

in this gun.

86
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:46,950
Mr. Kondo's request is very simple.

87
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:49,350
He missed the great show.

88
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:52,310
He hopes that you, the Commander of the 21st Division of the KMT Army,

89
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:54,570
the major general, can put on a real act of

90

"Execution at the Military Gate."

91
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:59,220
Mr. Kondo wants to watch it.

92

What do you mean?

93
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,530
Mr. Kondo has issued the order:

94
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:07,950
Either Master Gu becomes the magistrate of Wu County

95
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:11,180
or only one of you

96
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:12,640
can

97

get out of No. 90 alive.

Not only are you a traitor yourself,

100
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:48,990
but you also implicate me!

101
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:50,590

But now,

Shut up!

Look at you.

120

If your mother were alive,

121
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,550
she'd be sad.

I'm clear about it.

Then, can I still be the magistrate

bestowed by the Japanese?

416
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:01,360
Of course you can.
