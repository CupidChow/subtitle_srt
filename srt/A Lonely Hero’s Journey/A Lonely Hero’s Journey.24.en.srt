4
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,640
I'll follow your order.

5
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:48,310
Is it true that you had a relationship with Ou Xinping in the past?

6
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:49,170
Yes, it's true.

7
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,110
Ou Xinping and I

8
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:53,830
used to be colleagues,

9
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,670
and we were also romantically involved.

10
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:57,670
This is something

11
00:01:57,789 --> 00:01:59,600
everyone in the CBIS knows.

12
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,310
Besides,

13
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,430
I've included it

14
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:03,430
in my records,

15
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,310
which both Mr. Li and Mr Seiki

16
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:06,220
have reviewed.

17
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,789
What about this time? Have you been in contact?

18
00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:11,720
Absolutely not.

19
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,660
You're lying!

20
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,890
Huang told me

21
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:19,850
that he suspects Ou is staying at your place.

22
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:24,660
This Huang Xinzhai.

23
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:26,750
Sir,

24
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:27,970
how about this?

25
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,720
If you don't believe me,

26
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,030
send the military police

27
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,230

28

Feel free to search

29
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:35,510
and see if there's any evidence

30
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:37,710
that Ou Xinping has been staying there.

31
00:02:38,829 --> 00:02:40,440
Huang Xinzhai is trying

32
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:42,670
to use my past relationship with Ou Xinping

33
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:44,870
to spread rumors about me and ruin my reputation.

34
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:47,130
He wants to frame me as the spy from Chongqing

35
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:48,750
to divert suspicion away from himself.

36
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:51,310
I can't defend myself no matter what I say!

37
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:53,670
If you

38
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:55,550
don't trust me,

39
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:57,520
how about this?

40
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,050
Remove me from my position.

41
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:02,260
If I have any ties with the CBIS,

42
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,210
not to mention you,

43
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:05,710
Mr. Li would be the first

to go after me!

45
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:12,030
But couldn't Mr. Li himself

46
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:14,470
be colluding with the CBIS?

47
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,390
I don't know about that.

48
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:23,270
You and Ou are old acquaintances.

This is a bit challenging.

you filthy traitor.

191
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:05,670
Okay. Deal.

192
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:10,490
As long as you're willing to help,

193
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:12,990
we'll never see each other again.

194
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,640
Let me ask you:

195
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,080
how did the CBIS find out

196
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:21,230
that Jiang Boxian was at the Willow Garden?

197
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:22,830
Did you forget what I do?

198
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:23,750
Right.

199
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:27,750
Infiltration has always been your specialty.

200
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,230
So,

201
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:30,780
that means our No. 90 Agent Station

202
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:32,110
is no exception, right?

203
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:35,010
There are moles of yours here, aren't there?

204
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:36,110
Yes.

205
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:39,270
I want to know how many.

206
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:47,710
One.

207
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:49,590
Let me take a guess.

208
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:55,070
Is it Li Zhigang?

209
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:56,790
No.

210
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:58,390
Cai Heping?

211
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,480
No.

212
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:02,910
Liu Zhengyi?

213
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:05,630
No.

214
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:08,240
Could it be Huang?

215
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:15,290
That bastard Huang Xinzhai!

216
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:17,270
He's playing both sides.

217
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,270
I must kill him.

218
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,210
I guessed right, didn't I?

219
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:21,420
It's Huang Xinzhai.

220
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,840
Thank you for your cooperation.

221
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:28,080
I will plead with Mr. Kondo

222
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:31,660
to show you leniency.

223
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:34,580
I'll never see you again.

224
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:37,110
Take care.

225
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:56,510
You filthy traitor.

226
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:24,750
I don't want to see you again either!

227
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:31,150
You don't know how to appreciate kindness!

228
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,740
[The sooner you confess, the sooner you'll be free][The sooner you cooperate, the sooner your suffering will end]

229
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,990
Can you think of a way

230
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,900
to save my cousin-in-law?

231
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,560
You know what she does, right?

232
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:36,150
Yes.

233
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:37,310
She's a CBIS agent.

234
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:41,470
She used me

235
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:44,430
to infiltrate Gu's Garden

236
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:46,360
using Haimo's identity

237
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,270
to carry out her work.

238
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:50,510
It was deadly dangerous.

239
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:52,630
Weren't you afraid?

240
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:54,790
I was terrified every day.

241
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:56,510
Sometimes,

242
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:58,510
just thinking about the guns she had

243
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:01,290
made me wake up in the middle of the night.

244
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:04,030
But she told me

245
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:07,310
that if I didn't cooperate with her,

246
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:10,370
my brother in the air force would suffer.

247
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:12,750
I had no choice.

248
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:16,470
Yet, I still failed to protect my brother.

249
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:25,230
So what's your real name?

250
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:29,480
My name is...

251
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:34,150
Just call me Haimo.

252
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:36,950
If it weren't for Haimo,

253
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:40,080
I wouldn't have met my cousin-in-law,

254
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:45,910
and I wouldn't have met Uncle Gu

255
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:47,590
or you.

256
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:54,150
Yizhong,

257
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:57,550
could you do me a favor?

258
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:12,190
Zhou?

259
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:14,960
Are you trying to scare me to death?

260
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:17,829
Have you eaten?

261
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,270
Let me tell you,

262
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:25,510
we've only been away for a few days,

263
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:25,960
right?

264
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:27,819
And now half of my bag of dried delicacies

265
00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:29,550
has been eaten by Mrs. Liu.

266
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:31,430
I wanted to deduct her wages!

267
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:35,000
But then I thought,

268
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:35,980
forget it.

269
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:38,740
You don't even like them.

270
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:41,640
If she wants to eat them, let her have some.

271
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:44,590
I can't be bothered to be angry with her.

272
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:50,150
What's wrong?

273
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:53,720
Are you tired from work at the station?

274
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:57,400
Could it be that Ou has returned to Suzhou?

275
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:00,200
Let's not mention her.

276
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,030
Let's not mention her.

277
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:02,630
We agreed not to mention her.

278
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:05,700
I'll run a bath for you.

279
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:08,200
You can soak for a while.

280
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:12,510
By the way,

281
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,440
Mr. Li called.

282
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:16,270
He said he had come to Suzhou

283
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:17,600
and asked you to go over.

284
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:25,580
[Harmony Brings Prosperity]

285
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:35,030
Please.

286
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:39,310
Bye.

287
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:15,230
He really ran away?

288
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:19,720
He was taken by the CBIS.

289
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:21,590
I believe what you said,

290
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:24,550
but the Japanese don't.

291
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:26,830
Advisor Mei

292
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:30,270
came all the way to Suzhou to ask me for him.

293
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:31,750
Tell me,

294
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:33,630
what should I do?

295
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:37,110
It was my fault for being incompetent

296
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:38,910
and causing you embarrassment.

297
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:51,910
Didn't I specifically tell you?

298
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:54,160
If it really comes to it,

299
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:55,390
just take him out.

300
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:57,710
The situation

301
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:00,820
was a bit complicated that day.

302
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:01,830
Zhifei,

303
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:05,510
you're such a meticulous person.

304
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:07,360
What was wrong with you?

305
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:10,330
Was it because of your son?

306
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:11,430
No.

307
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:19,520
Then what about her?

308
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:22,550
What are you planning to do with her?

309
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:24,590
My informant told me

310
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:27,910
that Jiang Boxian has already returned to Chongqing.

311
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,150
In 1927,

312
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:52,710
you almost

313
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:55,580
married her.

314
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:19,860
You really had feelings for her.

315
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:23,710
I suppose so.

316
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:29,710
Back then,

317
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:32,950
I really didn't know.

318
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:38,280
Maybe I shouldn't have introduced Yuqing

319
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:39,400
to you.

320
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:41,430
It wasn't your fault.

321
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:44,740
It was my own indecisiveness.

322
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:45,810
Can you bear it?

323
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:05,190
Kondo really has you

324
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:07,240
by the throat.

325
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:12,150
The Japanese believe

326
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:15,270
that she has no use anymore.

327
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:19,470
They've sent me several reports

328
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:22,250
recommending her execution.

329
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:28,350
I've agreed to it.

330
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,230
It's set for tomorrow.

331
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:51,440
Is there any possibility

332
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,970
that she could be persuaded

333
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:56,110
to join our side?

334
00:22:58,670 --> 00:22:59,510
I've tried.

335
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:01,710
She refused.

336
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:10,910
Tomorrow,

337
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:13,200
I'll find a excuse

338
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:15,440
to send you to Shanghai.

339
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:16,230
No need.

340
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:21,790
Are you going to the execution ground?

341
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:23,030
I want to see...

342
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:24,470
if I can be of any help.

343
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:27,270
Then tomorrow

344
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:33,110
will be a big test for you.

345
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:47,460
Thank you.

346
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:48,390
You're welcome.

347
00:23:59,030 --> 00:23:59,850
Cousin.

348
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:02,920
Cousin.

349
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,780
I didn't expect you to come and see me.

350
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:13,320
Take it slow.

351
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,300
Someone asked me to come.

352
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:28,030
Haimo asked you to come?

353
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:33,030
Can you hang in there?

354
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:39,370
Compared to the suffering I've endured over the years,

355
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:40,830
it's nothing.

356
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:57,540
Haimo prepared a table of Cantonese dim sum for you.

357
00:24:57,950 --> 00:24:59,750
She said it's all your favorites

358
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:03,510
and it's still warm.

359
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:06,590
So much.

360
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:10,190
This is

361
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:13,310
my last meal, right?

362
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:18,200
The document is out.

363
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:20,110
Tomorrow.

364
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:21,210
A firing squad?

365
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,230
Great.

366
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:30,390
It's better than being hanged.

367
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:33,840
I don't want to be a ghost with my tongue sticking out.

368
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:52,450
I brought you a bottle of wine.

369
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:54,180
Would you like some?

370
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:59,030
Men use alcohol to summon their courage;

371
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:01,110
women don't need it.

372
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:18,710
Haimo specifically asked me

373
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:21,390
to bring you a piece of clothing.

374
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:27,150
I'll put it here.

375
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:38,990
I want to

376
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:41,550
ask you a favor.

377
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:52,070
I'm not a good person.

378
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:56,070
But Haimo

379
00:26:57,270 --> 00:26:58,430
is a good girl.

380
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:01,740
She has a poor background

381
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:08,150
and no one to rely on.

382
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:11,110
She has no family left.

383
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:13,270
I'm about to die.

384
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:19,270
Please

385
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:21,970
take care of her for me.

386
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:28,030
Don't let her end up

387
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:30,150
on the streets,

388
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:34,300
being bullied.

389
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:40,310
Don't let her genuine feelings for you go to waste.

390
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:50,310
Don't worry.

391
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:52,870
I'll treat her

392
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:55,350
like my own sister.

393
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:02,120
You don't understand us women either.

394
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:07,630
Just forget what I said.

395
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:24,720
It's really delicious.

396
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:34,470
By the way,

397
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:43,070
please tell Mr. Huang

398
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:46,120
that I regret not taking his advice

399
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:49,810
and that I'll have to see him in the next life.

400
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:30,350
Where's Zhou Zhifei?

401
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:52,150
In 1927,

402
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:55,920
I once went boating in Suzhou

403
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:57,490
with a woman.

404
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,330
The sun was shining brightly that day,

405
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:04,010
and I was accompanied by a beautiful lady.

406
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:05,970
It was the happiest day of my life.

407
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:09,600
was the happiest day in Zhifei's life.

408
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:23,710
It was also

409
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:27,750
the happiest day in my...

410
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:42,370
♫That fallen leaf is like a fleeting dream♫

411
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:48,800
♫In prison, we vow to forget each other♫

412
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:56,280
♫Dancing in both camps while family ties are dissolving♫

413
00:30:57,110 --> 00:31:02,820
♫Numbly struggling, while feeling lost♫

414
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:09,550
♫In the whirlpool of betrayal, escaping is impossible♫

415
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:16,130
♫The grand finale of the rise and fall is nothing but an empty display♫

416
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:20,070
♫Is it truly because you were compelled by circumstances♫

417
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:23,160
♫Or had no choice?♫

418
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:30,570
♫Or is it simply because you have a heart of stone?♫

419
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:27,920
Zhou Zhifei is indeed quite something.

420
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:30,810
He's a smart man.

421
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:36,880
♫Ambition is swelling, and the flames of war are rising♫

422
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:34,670
Director, you're off work?

423
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:36,960
I'm here to get your signature.

424
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,830
There's some money for you.

425
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:43,520
♫Acting accordingly in the game of power♫

426
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:42,510
What money?

427
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,570
Bounty payment.

428
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:47,440
♫Is it the fierce storm♫

429
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:47,230
Don't we get a 200-yuan bounty

430
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:48,830
for every Chongqing spy we execute?

431
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:50,510
♫And hidden dangers♫

432
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:51,790
This is the bounty for killing Ou Xinping.

433
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:54,560
♫Or the fickleness of human nature?♫

434
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:52,720
Here you are.

435
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:24,330
Zhou, you are back?

436
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:03,710
Why is there around 200 yuan?

437
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:08,670
It's the bounty for Ou Xinping's execution.

438
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:10,390
So ominous.

439
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,550
Mr. Huang.

440
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:12,719
What happened in Willow Garden was really a massacre.

441
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:17,110
The situation was urgent at the time,

442
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:18,310
so I made a decision

443
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:20,270
without reporting it.

444
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:22,040
You did the right thing.

445
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:25,070
At least you prevented the Japanese

446
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:26,710
from catching Jiang Boxian.

447
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,810
Who could have imagined

448
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:34,630
that so many lives

449
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:38,840
would be lost in an instant?

450
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,460
I understand how you feel.

451
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:42,590
You're an educated person

452
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:44,520
who hasn't received any training.

453
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:46,830
Mr. Huang,

454
00:34:49,469 --> 00:34:50,270
I'm so tired.

455
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:54,790
I don't want to do it anymore.

456
00:34:55,790 --> 00:34:57,050
Don't be discouraged.

457
00:34:57,150 --> 00:34:58,590
The road to resisting the Japanese is still long.

458
00:34:58,590 --> 00:35:00,320
We can't just give up so easily.

459
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,550
No, Mr. Huang.

460
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:08,280
Actually, I've been thinking about this for a long time.

461
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:11,350
Over this period,

462
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:14,430
I've almost lost sight of who I am.

463
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:17,180
I feel like I can't even tell what's true

464
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:18,230
and what's false

465
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:20,230
about the things I do and say every day.

466
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:20,910
If this goes on,

467
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:22,590
I'll eventually break down.

468
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:30,110
I'm sorry, Mr. Huang.

469
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:34,150
I didn't…

470
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:37,310
I didn't stick to it.

471
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:45,150
Whatever you decide,

472
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:47,800
I'll respect your choice.

473
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:53,710
Mr. Huang, no matter what,

474
00:35:55,310 --> 00:35:57,350
I definitely can't

475
00:35:57,350 --> 00:35:59,150
return to No. 90, that hellhole.

476
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:02,520
I want to leave Suzhou as soon as possible.

477
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:04,110
I don't want any burdens.

478
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:07,270
Right now,

479
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:10,410
I just want to stroll on a sunlit path.

480
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:14,230
It must be full of hope.

481
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:18,270
Same here.

482
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:24,960
I also want that.

483
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:28,360
That day will come eventually.

484
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:30,510
China will win.

485
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:33,800
Junxia!

486
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:41,030
What is it that made you so happy?

487
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:44,230
Yizhong said he's coming with us,

488
00:36:44,350 --> 00:36:45,760
to the base.

489
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,330
Here's the note he gave me.

490
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:52,180
[I'll take care of things at Gu's Garden and then join you to set off together]

491
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:52,180
[I've decided to go with you to the New Fourth Army base]

492
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:53,210
Great.

493
00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:54,840
He's been through so much.

494
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:55,970
He deserves a break.

495
00:36:57,430 --> 00:36:58,800
The road for the Peace Army to leave the city

496
00:36:58,800 --> 00:36:59,740
is a no-go.

497
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:01,570
I'll think of another way.

498
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:03,740
We can go to Shui Sheng's place

499
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:04,790
to take the water route.

500
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:06,640
We'll dress as fishermen

501
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:08,960
and depart from the lake in the early morning.

502
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:09,480
Okay.

503
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,070
Then let's go to Changshu to find our troops.

504
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:13,530
I heard the 18th Brigade is in Mount Maoshan.

505
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:14,600
But don't worry.

506
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,230
As long as they're still around,

507
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:17,690
we'll be able to find them.

508
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:31,110
Was she in pain

509
00:37:32,010 --> 00:37:32,830
when she died?

510
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:40,000
Zhou Zhifei did it himself.

511
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:45,230
My cousin loved him deeply.

512
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,840
How could he do that?

513
00:37:49,790 --> 00:37:51,510
Is he human or a beast?

514
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:56,540
Did she leave any words?

515
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,530
She said you are a good girl,

516
00:38:02,290 --> 00:38:04,890
that the whole thing has nothing to do with you,

517
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:07,330
that it was she who dragged you into this,

518
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,080
and that she feels sorry for you.

519
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:15,130
Actually, she didn't say those things, did she?

520
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:17,270
You made up

521
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:19,550
those words to lie to me.

522
00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:23,820
But I like hearing them.

523
00:38:35,310 --> 00:38:35,840
Haimo,

524
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:39,140
I'm leaving Suzhou.

525
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:42,480
Where are you going?

526
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:43,800
I can't say for now.

527
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:46,430
Will you come back?

528
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:50,470
I'm afraid I won't be back anytime soon.

529
00:38:56,790 --> 00:38:57,700
Don't worry.

530
00:38:58,510 --> 00:38:59,440
After you leave,

531
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:02,480
I'll take good care of this mansion for you.

532
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:03,310
Haimo,

533
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:07,110
not only am I leaving, but you should also leave.

534
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:09,280
Once the people from No. 90 find out I'm missing,

535
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,140
they will search the entire city.

536
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:12,550
It will be dangerous for you

537
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:13,470
if you stay.

538
00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:16,430
I don't know where else I can go.

539
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:17,880
Didn't I tell you?

540
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:19,270
You can go to Hong Kong.

541
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:20,590
I have connections there

542
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:22,320
who can arrange things for you.

543
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:28,870
Mr. Gu,

544
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:32,310
can I go with you?

545
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:41,750
Haimo,

546
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,360
my situation is quite complicated.

547
00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:47,990
Even if I go to Taihu Lake,

548
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:51,720
I'll have to undergo a lengthy investigation.

549
00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:53,630
You would suffer a lot

550
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:55,680
if you follow me.

551
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:58,850
Besides,

552
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,610
you've already endured so much

553
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:03,190
since coming here.

554
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:07,160
You should stay away from these conflicts

555
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:09,230
and live a life you're meant to live.

556
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:11,310
What is the life I'm meant to live?

557
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:16,110
Singing ballads?

558
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:18,110
Earning money?

559
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:21,110
Forcing a smile?

560
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:24,300
Living like this,

561
00:40:24,950 --> 00:40:27,550
what's the difference between me and a corpse?

562
00:40:28,690 --> 00:40:30,160
Haimo, you must believe

563
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:32,570
that we will eventually win the War of Resistance.

564
00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:34,550
The Japanese will eventually be driven out of China.

565
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:36,000
That day will come.

566
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:39,190
I believe

567
00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:42,630
that we will eventually win the War of Resistance.

568
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:43,910
But I'm not certain

569
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:46,290
that we will see each other again.

570
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:55,350
Mr. Gu,

571
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:57,500
goodbye.

572
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,670
On the early morning of December 7, 1941,

573
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:22,070
183 aircraft launched

574
00:41:22,070 --> 00:41:24,030
from six Japanese aircraft carriers

575
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:26,840
flew through the clouds and fog to attack Pearl Harbor.

576
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:29,990
The hastily prepared American forces suffered heavy losses.

577
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:31,450
Of the eight battleships,

578
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:32,730
four were sunk,

579
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:33,920
one ran aground,

580
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:36,230
and the rest were severely damaged.

581
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:37,430
Six cruisers

582
00:41:37,430 --> 00:41:39,590
and three destroyers were hit,

583
00:41:39,990 --> 00:41:42,590
188 planes were destroyed,

584
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,790
and thousands of officers and soldiers were casualties.

585
00:41:44,790 --> 00:41:46,790
Most of the facilities on the island

586
00:41:46,830 --> 00:41:48,580
and in the harbor were destroyed or damaged,

587
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:51,510
resulting in a tremendous victory for the Japanese.

588
00:41:51,730 --> 00:41:53,430
The international situation has drastically changed.

589
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:55,490
We must evacuate as soon as possible.

590
00:42:03,930 --> 00:42:06,650
We have made one concession after another

591
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:07,880
to the United States,

592
00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:13,950
yet not only did they freeze trade with Japan,

593
00:42:13,970 --> 00:42:16,230
but they also demanded that the Empire of Japan

594
00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:19,670
withdraw unconditionally from China.

595
00:42:19,690 --> 00:42:21,950
For the survival of the Empire,

596
00:42:21,970 --> 00:42:24,290
for world peace,

597
00:42:24,370 --> 00:42:26,770
and for the well-being of the Asian people,

598
00:42:26,870 --> 00:42:28,010
it is necessary and imperative

599
00:42:28,010 --> 00:42:31,780
for the Empire of Japan

600
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,940
to go to war with the United States.

601
00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:36,230
Hurray!

602
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:37,430
Hurray!

603
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:38,510
Hurray!

604
00:42:41,870 --> 00:42:42,600
Kondo Masao,

605
00:42:42,910 --> 00:42:44,380
defeating the United States

606
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:45,970
is a tremendous victory.

607
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:48,360
Why are you so downcast?

608
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:50,140
What do you mean?

609
00:42:50,450 --> 00:42:51,200
I believe

610
00:42:51,510 --> 00:42:53,260
the Empire of Japan should advance northward

611
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:54,660
to attack the Soviet Union.

612
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:57,250
Going south and waging war against the British and Americans

613
00:42:57,250 --> 00:42:58,650
is not the best strategy.

614
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:00,240
You bastard!

615
00:43:01,510 --> 00:43:02,110
Sir,

616
00:43:02,130 --> 00:43:03,260
I'm sorry.

617
00:43:04,630 --> 00:43:05,270
Sir,

618
00:43:06,070 --> 00:43:08,330
this was found at Huang Xinzhai's house.

619
00:43:10,030 --> 00:43:11,630
I didn't notice it last time,

620
00:43:11,910 --> 00:43:14,790
but the more I look at it, the more it resembles someone.

621
00:43:14,790 --> 00:43:17,350
It's the butler of Gu Yizhong,

622
00:43:17,410 --> 00:43:19,260
named Fu Gui.

623
00:43:22,430 --> 00:43:24,400
Why did Huang Xinzhai

624
00:43:24,430 --> 00:43:25,440
draw a portrait of Fu Gui?
