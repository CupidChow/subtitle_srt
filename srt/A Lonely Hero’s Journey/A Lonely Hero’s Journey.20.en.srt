Why do you suspect me?

178

If you want to frame me,

182
00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:14,250
why beat around the bush?

183

390
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:52,110
The Japanese Communist Party member

391
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:54,290
named Nakanishi Tarou that we were going to save

392
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:56,020
was not the person in the photo.

393
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:01,820
Something is wrong with this photo.

394
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:04,620
After we were ambushed during that night's oepration,

395
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:05,270
I suspected

396
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:06,800
we had an internal traitor.

397
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,400
I reviewed all the details

398
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:11,430
and filtered all the participants.

399
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,800
But I overlooked the photo.

400
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:16,220
It was only after I met Nakanishi Tarou

401
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:17,080
that I realized

402
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:18,290
the entire operation

403
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:20,490
was a trap all along.

404
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:22,740
Whoever gave this photo

405
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:25,640
is Cell 8.

406
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:28,750
Who gave you this photo?

407
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:30,750
Zhou Zhenwu.

408
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,060
[Temple Donation Box]

409
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:48,990
Xiao Junxia was kidnapped by the Communist Party.

410
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:50,270
Who?

411
00:30:50,290 --> 00:30:51,620
Xiao Junxia is not dead.

412
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,340
I thought

413
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:00,040
everyone died that day, except Gu Yizhong.

414
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,330
Why did you keep him around?

415
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:04,510
His family is rich, right?

416
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:07,090
I wanted to keep him in exchange for some money.

417
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:09,090
You're still thinking about money?

418
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:13,170
Gu Yizhong joined forces with your people outside

419
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:14,150
to take him away

420
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:15,390
from No. 90's dungeon.

421
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:17,320
It was a two-sided collaboration.

422
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:22,170
Xiao Junxia was saved.

423
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,610
He will suspect me

424
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:26,360
once he meets up with Eagle.

425
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:28,080
You mean

426
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:29,980
Hu Zhiping gave you this photo?

427
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:30,870
Yes.

428
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,960
This was the photo.

429
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:34,600
I remember it very clearly.

430
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:37,540
I'm going to retreat from them.

431
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:41,740
Before that,

432
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:43,310
you have to tell me the liaison point

433
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:44,570
of the New Fourth Army.

434
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:46,010
I won't.

435
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,380
You want your wife to know

436
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:48,830
that you're Cell 8?

437
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:55,500
Give me some time.

438
00:31:55,530 --> 00:31:56,670
I don't have time.

439
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:05,310
The traitor is Hu Zhiping.

440
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:06,590
We must cut off

441
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:08,520
all contact with him immediately.

442
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:14,110
The leaders of Jiangsu Provincial Committee

443
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:16,170
crossed Suzhou's borders recently.

444
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:17,450
All activities were arranged

445
00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:18,290
by Hu Zhiping.

446
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,880
If Hu Zhiping is Cell 8,

447
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:24,520
Zhou Zhifei will inform him soon

448
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:26,400
that I have been saved.

449
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:27,820
He'll grow desperate and panic.

450
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,310
The leaders will be in danger.

451
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:30,660
We have no clue about

452
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:31,440
when they came,

453
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,550
where they live,

454
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:33,630
and where they'll enter and exit.

455
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:34,860
We can't contact the leaders of the provincial committee either.

456
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:36,460
We must find him immediately

457
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:37,620
and stop him.

458
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:40,070
I'll contact the liaison immediately.

459
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:44,560
Huizhong.

460
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,080
Huizhong.

461
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:33,190
Come in.

462
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:35,370
Director.

463
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:36,970
The special agent is here.

464
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:38,900
Mr. Ji.

465
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:40,270
It's been six months.

466
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:41,050
How have you been?

467
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:41,840
Have a seat.

468
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:44,590
I flew from Chongqing to Guilin,

469
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:45,910
then Guilin to Hong Kong,

470
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:47,720
and then took a British ship to Shanghai.

471
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,400
It took more than half a month.

472
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:51,350
After doing office work for so long,

473
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:53,870
my back can barely hold up anymore.

474
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:56,390
Director, you guys talk.

475
00:33:56,390 --> 00:33:57,970
I'll arrange lunch for the special agent.

476
00:33:57,970 --> 00:33:59,600
Deputy Director Shen, stay here

477
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,660
to listen to Mr. Xu's verbal message.

478
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:05,950
This was specifically instructed

479
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:07,510
by Mr. Xu before I left.

480
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,630
To Xinping and Yifei,

481
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:22,520
you two have gone to Suzhou with your men for three months.

482
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:25,540
I listened hard but did not hear of any news.

483
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:26,219
Why?

484
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:28,429
Mr. Jiang Boxian

485
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:30,030
is a party pioneer.

486
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:31,800
He has been captured for days.

487
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:34,010
Three risky rescues have been ordered,

488
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:36,150
but there's still no trace of him.

489
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:37,389
Traitor Zhou Zhifei

490
00:34:37,389 --> 00:34:38,949
was an exemplary party member

491
00:34:38,949 --> 00:34:40,679
but decided to follow the traitorous Wang.

492
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:43,230
You guarantee that he sides with goodness.

493
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:45,150
The letters I wrote

494
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:47,070
have also received no responses.

495
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:49,449
If it's confirmed that he can't be used by the party,

496
00:34:49,449 --> 00:34:51,500
we must sanction him severely.

497
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:52,630
Xinping

498
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:54,889
has always been braver than men.

499
00:34:54,949 --> 00:34:56,270
Why are you so timid

500
00:34:56,290 --> 00:34:58,890
after entering Suzhou?

501
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:03,170
Sincerely, Enzeng.

502
00:35:07,290 --> 00:35:08,940
Xinping, sit down.

503
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:09,990
Sit down.

504
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:15,870
I failed Mr. Kejun.

505
00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:17,530
I don't deserve to sit.

506
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:20,600
You exaggerate.

507
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:21,890
Have a seat.

508
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:24,900
Director Ou,

509
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,500
you've always been admired by our comrades.

510
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:29,350
But I heard that, a few days ago,

511
00:35:29,350 --> 00:35:31,810
five more men died in the military hospital.

512
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:33,550
Since you ask,

513
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:34,500
I don't dare to hide anything.

514
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,760
No. 90 guards heavily.

515
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:37,750
Jiangsu District will create another plan

516
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:38,550
to save Mr. Jiang.

517
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:39,320
Xinping.

518
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:40,890
Saving people and killing

519
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:42,520
are two things.

520
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,620
If you can't accomplish one,

521
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:45,310
I'm afraid it'll be difficult

522
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,790
to explain to Mr. Kejun.

523
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:51,630
Do you have any new plans

524
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:53,150
about sanctioning Zhou Zhifei?

525
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:54,750
We're working on a strategy.

526
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:58,570
Director Ou, you had a good chance

527
00:35:58,780 --> 00:35:59,840
but you has lost it.

528
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:10,270
Why do you say that?

529
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:12,630
Rumor has it that

530
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:14,900
Director Ou has been hiding in Zhou's Mansion.

531
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:16,390
Is it true?

532
00:36:18,830 --> 00:36:19,510
Yes.

533
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:24,270
Deputy Director Shen didn't report this to me.

534
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:24,710
I

535
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:26,440
arrived in Suzhou two days ago.

536
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:28,750
I asked some old friends and found out about it.

537
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:30,750
Zhou Zhifei has always been cunning.

538
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:32,470
His residence is not known to outsiders.

539
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:35,610
Regarding the specific location of Zhou's Mansion,

540
00:36:36,370 --> 00:36:37,500
I think you

541
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:39,150
must still remember, right?

542
00:36:45,610 --> 00:36:46,650
Director Ou,

543
00:36:46,850 --> 00:36:49,570
please write down the specific location of Zhou's Mansion

544
00:36:49,570 --> 00:36:51,440
and have the operations team

545
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:53,480
carry out the mission.

546
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:24,590
No. 2, Minsheng Lane, Shantang Street.

547
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,070
[No. 2, Minsheng Lane, Shantang Street.]

548
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:33,950
It's the same.

549
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:36,230
You already had the address?

550
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:40,030
I was afraid the intelligence from the NBIS

551
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:41,400
might have mistakes,

552
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:43,430
so I asked you to confirm it.

553
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:45,990
I appreciate it.

554
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:47,530
Deputy Director Shen,

555
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:50,170
please

556
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,200
give orders to our operations team.

557
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:08,310
Han, No. 2, Minsheng Lane, Shantang Street.

558
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:09,470
Action.

559
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:11,590
Zhou Zhifei's car is bulletproof, right?

560
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:13,850
Both teams have armor-piercing shells.

561
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:16,680
They specialize in hitting bulletproof cars.

562
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:19,470
The three of us will wait here

563
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:21,950
for the good news.

564
00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:32,470
Sir!

565
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:34,620
Do you need a car?

566
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:36,390
Ruotong said Junxia wants to see you.

567
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:37,190
It's urgent.

568
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:45,960
Sir, here.

569
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:52,820
Who is it?

570
00:38:53,870 --> 00:38:54,570
It's me.

571
00:38:54,650 --> 00:38:56,570
[After drinking the jade nectar, walking through bamboo forest]

572
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:56,870
I found where the special agent is staying.

573
00:38:56,870 --> 00:38:58,290
Why don't you have Li go with you?

574
00:38:58,290 --> 00:38:59,090
It's too late.

575
00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:00,700
I’ll check it myself.

576
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:02,750
Ruotong,

577
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:05,350
the tea house is not safe now.

578
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:06,710
Be careful.

579
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:07,990
Got it.

580
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:11,710
Sir, we're here.

581
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:13,810
Turn left and go upstairs.

582
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:16,610
Stay outside and observe.

583
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:17,340
Got it.

584
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:20,180
Thank you, sir.

585
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,150
Who is it?

586
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:37,920
It’s me,

587
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:47,710
Ruotong.

588
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:48,320
Yizhong.

589
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:49,400
Where is Junxia?

590
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:50,630
Follow me.

591
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:52,870
Junxia.

592
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:55,780
Yizhong.

593
00:39:59,490 --> 00:40:00,180
Junxia.

594
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:07,020
Don't get up.

595
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:12,780
A world-class architect like you

596
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:14,340
is now in this state?

597
00:40:19,470 --> 00:40:20,280
Give it to me.

598
00:40:21,490 --> 00:40:22,710
Don't laugh at me.

599
00:40:23,450 --> 00:40:24,780
You look good.

600
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:27,600
You're a professional Kuomintang employee.

601
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:44,560
How is it?

602
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:46,870
Can you handle it?

603
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:48,020
It's alright.

604
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:57,630
By the way,

605
00:40:57,670 --> 00:40:59,050
I've prepared some sulfanilamide for you.

606
00:40:59,050 --> 00:41:00,190
It's the most effective antibiotic.

607
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:01,720
Hurry and give it to Junxia.

608
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:05,860
Be careful.

609
00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:09,480
Yizhong,

610
00:41:10,090 --> 00:41:11,420
you've had it difficult

611
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:12,630
these days.

612
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:20,700
Any hardship

613
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:24,220
is worth it for this moment.

614
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:30,540
I'm still here.

615
00:41:30,570 --> 00:41:32,090
Don't get too romantic.

616
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:36,910
Junxia.

617
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:39,980
I thought you'd died.

618
00:41:40,650 --> 00:41:41,890
I didn't expect

619
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:44,170
to see you again.

620
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:46,240
How is that possible?

621
00:41:47,110 --> 00:41:47,810
I haven't attended

622
00:41:47,810 --> 00:41:49,540
your wedding with Ruotong yet.

623
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:52,330
I haven't heard you call me Brother-in-law yet.

624
00:41:53,850 --> 00:41:54,820
Alright.

625
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:56,100
Junxia, sit down.

626
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:56,960
You're still injured.

627
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:57,430
Yes.

628
00:42:38,290 --> 00:42:39,940
Zhou, why are you here?

629
00:42:41,570 --> 00:42:43,530
You're just going to make me stand outside?

630
00:42:43,530 --> 00:42:44,700
Can't I come in?

631
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:01,430
I wanted to see you urgently

632
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:03,700
to confirm who the Cell 8 is.

633
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:07,900
Hu Zhiping.
