[Episode 19]

4
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,810
Chief Wan Lilang

5
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:43,640
specifically sent me a team

6
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:45,270
from No. 76.

7
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:46,789
Two people in the team

8
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:48,240
know Ou.

9
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:53,750
What is it?

10
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:56,870
This pen is out of ink.

11
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,950
I'm here to get some ink from you.

12
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:00,560
Ink, right?

13
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,280
This way, this way.

14
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,650
This way.

15
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:04,950
Here.

16
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:13,320
Sir.

17
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:15,600
Six men from Kunshan arrived.

18
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:16,670
They've been divided into three groups

19
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:18,150
to keep an eye on Gu Yizhong all day.

20
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,020
As you ordered,

21
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:20,710
they are all men he doesn't know.

22
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:21,200
Good.

23
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,590
Remind them

24
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:26,630
to monitor and record

25
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:28,310
all the calls Gu Yizhong makes or receives.

26
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:28,820
Yes.

27
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:31,950
Plus, tell the people who follow him not to watch every move he makes.

28
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:33,079
Give him some space.

29
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,290
Go catch him when he takes the bite.

30
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:36,150
Yes, sir.

31
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:37,230
One more thing.

32
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:42,740
I just heard Huang Xinzhai and Gu Yizhong

33
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,040
mention Ou Xinping.

34
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:45,079
That's good.

35
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,750
If Vice Director Huang is capable

36
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:51,150
of catching the Director of Jiangsu District of CBIS,

37
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:52,390
maybe the Japanese

38
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:54,190
will reward our entire station.

39
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:55,120
That's good.

40
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,190
Got it.

41
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:58,110
OK.

42
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:27,910
Ji Yuqing.

43
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,480
Let me out!

44
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:32,170
Even if you beg, it won’t work.

45
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:34,060
I won’t fall for it.

46
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:50,990
What's wrong?

47
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:53,230
Nothing.

48
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:55,930
You're eating

49
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:57,230
a piece of ginger.

50
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,190
Mr. Gu.

51
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:11,950
I want to say.

52
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:13,950
Would you like to

53
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:15,770
listen to our ballads?

54
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,070
Whether singing or listening to the ballads,

55
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:20,610
we're

56
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:21,589
all happy.

57
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:28,100
Haimo.

58
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:31,710
Her surname is Ou.

59
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:32,510
Who?

60
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:34,470
Your cousin-in-law.

61
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,510
Why did you suddenly mention her?

62
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:41,640
Someone from No. 90 is looking for her.

63
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:48,190
Are you suspecting that I'm still in touch with her?

64
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:52,030
If she contacts you,

65
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:54,150
tell her Suzhou is no longer safe.

66
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:56,390
There are people everywhere trying to catch her.

67
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:56,990
You got it?

68
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,590
Actually, I shouldn’t interfere in your affairs,

69
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:04,650
and I don’t want to.

70
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:09,590
Have you and Miss Xiao

71
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,920
been up to something recently?

72
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:14,730
No.

73
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,340
You're so boring.

74
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:19,590
You keep your mouth shut about your own business.

75
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:21,720
But you're so keen on prying into mine.

76
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:22,720
If this continues,

77
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,350
even if I know

78
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:24,490
something about my cousin-in-law,

79
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,740
I won't tell you.

80
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:33,230
I'm sorry.

81
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,010
Your apology lacks sincerity.

82
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,390
Actually, my cousin-in-law

83
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:41,800
is a bit mean,

84
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:43,650
but she's not a bad person.

85
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:45,760
At least better than

86
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:47,190
those people from No. 90.

87
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:54,540
Mr. Gu.

88
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:56,350
Do you

89
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,870
want to hear me sing?

90
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,190
I'll go get my pipa.

91
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,040
Okay, thank you.

92
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:09,540
You wish!

93
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:11,960
Give me the bowl. I'll wash the dishes.

94
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:13,810
Where is Mrs. Wang?

95
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:15,210
I gave her a day off.

96
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:17,720
I'm done.

97
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:19,530
I'll wash the bowl myself.

98
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:22,650
Thank you.

99
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:25,920
Okay.

100
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,510
Ji, I'm back.

101
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:13,110
Sir.

102
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,670
It's disgusting.

103
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:22,230
Didn't I tell you not to get close to her?

104
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:24,310
She said she had an old jade bracelet.

105
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:25,780
It was taken from Dowager Empress Cixi’s tomb.

106
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:31,560
[Gather the turnips and carrots, yet throw away the roots and stems. Do not forsake the promises of the past: until death, I will not part from you]

107
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:31,560
[The valley wind blows swiftly and fiercely. Dark clouds gather and heavy rain pours. Husband and wife encourage each other and unite as one. We should not be angry at each other]

108
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:28,190
The valley wind blows swiftly and fiercely.

109
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:29,910
Dark clouds gather and heavy rain pours.

110
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:31,710
Husband and wife encourage each other and unite as one.

111
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:33,190
-We should not be angry at each other.
-What’s written in that letter?

112
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:34,830
-Gather the turnips and carrots.
-Your hands are broken? Why are you so slow?

113
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:36,950
-It's a complicated knot.
-You’re just greedy for money.

114
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:38,830
What’s written in the letter?

115
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:39,789
Zhou.

116
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:41,440
Damned woman!

117
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:42,630
Since

118
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:44,660
the door is locked,

119
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:46,190
she could have just reached out

120
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:47,350
and handed the bracelet over.

121
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:48,610
She even kills people.

122
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:50,440
And there're also

123
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:51,390
some bodyguards outside.

124
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:52,430
I specifically instructed them

125
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:53,430
to keep an eye on her.

126
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:54,460
She's been doing this for a long time.

127
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:56,390
Do you think those bodyguards can stop her?

128
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:58,260
Don't burn it in the house.

129
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:00,990
What’s written in that letter?

130
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:02,790
It’s a secret telegram to Mr. Li.

131
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,750
If she's been doing this a long time,

132
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:10,150
you must have known each other

133
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,370
in Nanjing, right?

134
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:17,190
Don’t try to fool me with anything about Chongqing

135
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:19,030
or Mr. Li.

136
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:19,870
I’ve already figured it out.

137
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:21,350
There’s something between you two.

138
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:22,320
Zhou Zhifei.

139
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:24,180
You must explain everything to me today.

140
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,810
Or I won’t let you off.

141
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:30,370
Who exactly is this Ou Xinping?

142
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,860
Do you really want to know?

143
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:36,550
Yes.

144
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:42,360
I'll only say it once.

145
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:44,780
You keep your mouth shut.

146
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:47,920
This is top secret.

147
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:48,680
Understand?

148
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,710
Promise me.

149
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:55,630
I won’t say anything.

150
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:01,820
Ou Xinping.

151
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:03,730
Her last name isn't Ou.

152
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:06,320
Even the name Xinping is fake.

153
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,500
Her surname Ou is fake?

154
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:09,270
Yes.

155
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:14,350
Do you remember

156
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:18,310
Mrs. Li led a group to beat a woman 2 years ago?

157
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,830
What was her name?

158
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:23,900
Liu Xiujuan, right?

159
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:25,150
Yes, yes.

160
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:27,120
Mr. Li...

161
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,030
Mr. Li had an affair with

162
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:30,290
that woman from No. 76.

163
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:31,770
It even made the tabloids.

164
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:37,140
Ou is Liu Xiujuan?

165
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:39,390
After Mrs. Li beat her,

166
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:40,650
Liu Xiujuan

167
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:41,780
got so angry

168
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,150
and stole some of Mr. Li’s documents.

169
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:45,550
And she fled to Chongqing

170
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:47,060
to join the CBIS.

171
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:48,570
Xu Enzeng thought

172
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:49,650
she had some value.

173
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,790
So he gave her a meaningless position.

174
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:53,190
Called her the Director.

175
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:55,030
But after some time,

176
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:57,190
he realized Liu Xiujuan was useless.

177
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:59,220
She's just a woman.

178
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:02,350
So he sent her to Nanjing

179
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:05,430
and wanted to get her to turn Mr. Li.

180
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:08,020
But Mr. Li isn’t someone easily swayed.

181
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:09,510
He turned Liu Xiujuan back to his side

182
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:11,070
in no time.

183
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:13,550
Now Liu Xiujuan

184
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:15,160
is also known as Ou Xinping.

185
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:16,870
She came to Suzhou this time

186
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:18,470
with the codename Mrs. Weng.

187
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:19,430
Mr. Li

188
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:21,390
worried that his wife

189
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:24,190

191

193

Alright.

194
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:34,230
Now you’ve caused such a mess

195
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:35,490
and I lost this person.

196
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:41,160
How am I supposed to explain this to Mr. Li?

197
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:44,440
Well.

198
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:47,070
Mr. Li wouldn't blame you, right?

199
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,390
Why wouldn’t he?

200
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:50,630
What do you think No. 90 does?

201
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:53,670
It's not just my negligence at work.

202
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:56,150
I might even be prosecuted

203
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:57,560
and sentenced to death.

204
00:11:58,750 --> 00:11:59,990
But she ran away on her own.

205
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:01,470
It's none of our business.

206
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:03,350
If you hadn’t let her go out of greed,

207
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:04,390

-Is her surname Ou or Liu?

00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:40,610
Is everyone here?

everyone else is here.

How about safety?

The travel agency is flying the German flag,

570
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,200
and the boss is a German count.

571
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,420
The Japanese wouldn’t easily enter,

572
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:50,250
let alone people from No. 90.

573
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:56,360
Don't slack off.

574
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:58,350
There are two hidden sentries

575
00:30:58,350 --> 00:30:59,930
and three mobile sentries guarding the outside.

576
00:30:59,930 --> 00:31:02,590

This is a telegram from ten o'clock this morning.

I got special instructions

from Chongqing to give this to you.

590
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:27,670
There are a few routine telegrams.

What about the Commercial Press's edition

00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,550

610
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:08,660
is still unknown to the Japanese.

611
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:10,480
But this Vice Director Huang

612

00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:35,200
Make sure Gu Yizhong knows.

625

Let's add more fuel to the fire,

626
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:38,450
and force him to act.

634

living in Room 302 upstairs.

One day, they were drunk.

They said they had a big task

637
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:56,050
to catch the female agent from Chongqing.

638
00:32:56,270 --> 00:32:57,390

No need.

Seems like all sorts of people have come.

642
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:08,110
I'll ask Huang Xinzhai to handle this.

643

648
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:20,550

just keep an eye on Gu Yizhong for me.

00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:25,530
Yes.

652
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,170
Yes.

00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:27,250
Captain Zhang.

654
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:28,830
Any other orders?

655
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:32,390

Mr. Sha went to the toilet.

660
00:34:22,489 --> 00:34:23,739
Don't move!

Where is Mr. Sha?

662
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:26,310
He's not surnamed Sha.

663

Your surname is not Lu.

Or I'll shoot.

I'll count to three.

670

Then we'll die together!

Wait.

Get him out.

677
00:34:51,330 --> 00:34:52,300
What's going on?

678
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:53,560
I've talked to Wu.

679
00:34:53,659 --> 00:34:55,270
You can't play dirty even if you want to raise the price.

680

Y-You are all liars.

the Party won’t let you off!

692

Wait, Mr. Sha.

709

I'm so ashamed.

723
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:13,530

What did he say?

726
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:18,070
He said he would find a way to contact Junxia

727
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:19,450
and ask him to

728
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,610
tell us his location from the dungeon.

729
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:23,370
He gave me this.

730
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:40,850
Here are the eggs.

731
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:41,570
Thank you.

732

As you ordered,

733
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,990
I boiled them in cold water for seven minutes.

734
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:48,190
They're the tenderest eggs. Bin Da Egg.

This isn’t about eating eggs, is it?

737
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:01,300
It's fine.

738
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,210

00:39:54,830 --> 00:39:55,430
Okay.

755
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,220
Mrs. Jiang.

756
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:02,970
-Don’t panic.
-Who are you?

757
00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:04,460
I'm a friend of Mr. Jiang.

758
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:07,570
He's imprisoned in the secret dungeon of No. 90,

759
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:09,170
and we’re planning a rescue.

760
00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:13,390
[Zuiningbo]

761
00:40:13,490 --> 00:40:15,000
Are you from Chongqing?

762
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:17,270
I need you

763
00:40:17,270 --> 00:40:19,600
to take one thing inside and give it to him.

764
00:40:21,570 --> 00:40:22,590
He doesn't eat eggs.

765
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:23,230
I know.

766
00:40:24,370 --> 00:40:25,580
Hide the egg inside the food box

767
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:27,120
and bring it in.

768
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:29,560
We’ll get him out.

769
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:30,900
[Zuiningbo]

770
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:30,860
Get in.

771
00:40:32,450 --> 00:40:36,470
[Zuiningbo]

772
00:40:44,890 --> 00:40:46,410
I swear I just saw him here.

773
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:53,270
Brother.

774
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,140
Did you see my hat?

775
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:13,100
Brother,

776
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:16,440
what are you reading that's got you so engrossed?

777
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:19,010
It's more captivating than my opium.

778
00:41:20,850 --> 00:41:22,160
Beloved China.

779
00:41:23,410 --> 00:41:25,180
Beloved China?

780
00:41:25,390 --> 00:41:26,020
Now?

781
00:41:28,370 --> 00:41:30,760
A handwritten copy of Beloved China

782
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:32,870
[Beloved China]

783
00:41:30,810 --> 00:41:32,310
written by Mr. Fang Zhimin.

784
00:41:32,310 --> 00:41:35,170
A cellmate who was sacrificed earlier gave it to me.

785
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:37,990
Fang Zhimin?

786
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:39,530
I've heard of him.

787
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:41,260
The head of the Red Army, right?

788
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:44,290
He was executed by the National Government in 1935.

789
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:46,520
Sacrificed.

790
00:41:47,070 --> 00:41:48,350
He was sacrificed.

791
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:51,400
But he was just a soldier.

792
00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:52,830
He could write articles?

793
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:55,300
This is a cell.

794
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:56,710
The walls of this cell

795
00:41:57,010 --> 00:41:59,210
are covered with white paper.

796
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:01,210
And though time has passed

797
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:03,610
and the paper has turned a dull yellow,

798
00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:05,970
with several large black patches

799
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:08,300
where the rain has leaked in.

800
00:42:08,930 --> 00:42:09,870
No, no.

801
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:11,180
That sounds terrible.

802
00:42:11,590 --> 00:42:13,590
When sunlight shines in

803
00:42:13,870 --> 00:42:16,070
or a bright electric light is turned on,

804
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:19,780
the room still appears bright and white.

805
00:42:25,390 --> 00:42:26,370
Lin,

806
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:28,790
your wife sent you some food.

807
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,560
This should be the beloved one.

808
00:42:50,470 --> 00:42:51,190
An egg?
