Nobody knows.

Sit.

00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:01,280
Spring's real name is Ou Xinping.

9
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:02,910
She's one of the 20 Arhats

10
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:04,540
of the CBIS's Zhengyuan Shop.

11
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:05,230
Xu Enzeng really trusts her.

What are you doing?

13
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:08,530
I heard that you

14
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:10,889
switched from the CPC
to the more enlightened path now

15
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:12,490
because of Ou Xinping.

Mr. Kondo already knew them.

20
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:28,980
I also reported to Mr. Li.

I guess she should be

27
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,710
somewhere no one expects.

28
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,829
The safest place in Suzhou

29
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:50,980

00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:01,490

Otherwise, the one standing here today

38
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:15,870
would be Sergeant Iwai from the military police.

39
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:17,070
Then I should thank you.

40
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:18,670

00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:21,970
But you can't smear that lady.

191
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:24,500
She has nothing to do with me.

192
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:27,390
You called her a traitor's woman

193
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,150
and unjustly tarnish her reputation.

194
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:31,280
How can she make a living in the future?

195
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:32,710
Do you think it's fun

196
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:33,840
to bully a weak girl?

197
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:37,570
All you do is talk. "Defeat this."

198
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:38,590
"Down with that."

199
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:41,390
The Japanese and the traitors are right in No. 90.

200
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:43,060
If you're really patriotic,

201
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:43,710
pick up your gun

202
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:45,270
and go to No. 90 with me to fight!

203
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:46,400
Are you going or not?

204
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:49,430
You bullied our compatriots
in the story-telling theatre.

205
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:50,960
What kind of heroes are you?

206
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:52,200
Are you even men?

207
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:55,270
Mr. Du.

208
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:57,790
Sorry.

209
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:00,630
I've affected the story-telling theatre's business.

210
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:04,500
From tomorrow onwards, I'll quit.

211
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:05,990
No.

212
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:09,070
The customers nowadays all love your show.

213
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:11,110
Don't worry.

214
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:13,550
If anyone dares to make trouble again,

215
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:15,270
I will risk my life

216
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,560
to fight against them.

217
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:17,390
Mr. Du.

218
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:18,670
Ms. Haimo,

219
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:20,520
someone sent you an invitation.

220
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,980
[To Ms. Zhang Haimo]

221
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:21,470
Thank you.

222
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,420
[To Ms. Zhang Haimo]

223
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,710
Who would send you an invitation?

224
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:35,420
You must be careful when making friends.

225
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:36,880
The world is not peaceful.

226
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:39,840
As a girl working outside,

227
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:42,050
you should protect yourself.

228
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:43,480
Got it, Mr. Du.

229
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:45,030
I know what to do.

230
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:46,070
Okay.

231
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,630
Are you Miss Zhang?

232
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:52,190
Yes.

233
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:53,690
Please come in.

234
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:01,590
You're here.

235
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:04,250
Have a seat.

236
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:14,790
Long time no see.

237
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:17,550
Not really.

238
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:24,630
You went to the story-telling theatre today.

239
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:28,230
You saw me?

240
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:30,390
I'm not blind.

241
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:32,390
But Mr. Gu,

242
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:35,470
you used to listen to the gramophone.

243
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:39,870
What? You've developed an interest in ballads?

244
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:44,070
As expected, after going to the story-telling theatre,

245
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:45,800
you're getting more eloquent.

246
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:48,560
I'm in the underworld,

247
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,150
so I have no choice.

248
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:53,590
Haimo,

249
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:55,960
I asked you here today

250
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,270
to ask you about someone.

251
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:01,110
Your cousin-in-law.

252
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:06,630
After we left Gu's Garden,

253
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:08,110
we went our separate ways.

254
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:12,660
Actually, she's not your cousin-in-law.

255
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:13,560
Now that you've already known it,

256
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,820
why do you still ask me?

257
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,830
I know a little,

258
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:18,440
but not all.

259
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:20,140
Actually,

260
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:23,030
she's not my cousin-in-law.

261
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:26,680
Of course, I'm not Zhang Haimo.

262
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:29,340
I guessed so.

263
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:33,310
I heard she was a progressive student
when she was young.

264
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:36,630
She went to a military academy in Guangzhou.

265
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:37,830
Then, here she is.

266
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:40,820
But you'd better

267
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:42,190
not ask about her.

268
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:44,490
She and the organization behind her…

269
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:49,230
Whoever gets involved will be unlucky.

270
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,190
No matter when or where,

271
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,230
as long as you have news about her,

272
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:54,740
tell me immediately.

273
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,090
This is very important.

274
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,140
My cousin-in-law is worth so much?

275
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:17,740
It has nothing to do with her.

276
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,010
This is for you from me.

277
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:20,890
You helped me a lot.

278
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:22,830
I can't repay you.

279
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:30,630
I don't understand.

280
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:33,870
It's not much,

281
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:36,630
but it's enough for you
to buy fields in your hometown

282
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:38,030
and live a peaceful life.

283
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,830
I know. What I owe you

284
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:43,390
can't be repaid with this little money.

285
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,680
But this is a token of my gratitude.

286
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:46,990
I hope you can understand.

287
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:51,220
Mr. Gu, you're chasing me away?

288
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:52,520
That's not what I mean.

289
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:55,950
Haimo, in Suzhou,

290
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:57,430
I'm kind of notorious now.

291
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:59,000
If you stay here,

292
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,540
your reputation will be affected, too.

293
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:01,270
I don't care.

294
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:09,590
Haimo, if you want to sing ballads,

295
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,860
you can go to Shanghai.

296
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:11,630
With your skills,

297
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:13,630
you can be a famous star in Shanghai.

298
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:15,230
And the income in a story-telling theatre in Shanghai

299
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:16,630
is higher than in Suzhou.

300
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,030
If that's not okay either,

301
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:20,270
you can go to Hong Kong.

302
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,070
My father had some connections there.

303
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:23,730
Maybe I can arrange it for you.

304
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,310
You're a funny person.

305
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:28,310
Just now,

306
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:29,960
you asked me to find out

307
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:32,840
my cousin-in-law's whereabouts in Suzhou for you.

308
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:34,910
But then, you asked me to leave Suzhou

309
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,770
and develop a career in Shanghai.

310
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:39,190
And now, you even want me to go to Hong Kong.

311
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:40,990
What on earth do you want me to do?

312
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:46,830
I...

313
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:51,830
Now that you know I'm not the real Haimo,

314
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:55,390
don't you want to know my real name?

315
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:59,960
Then I'll just be Zhang Haimo, Mr. Gu.

316
00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:02,250
[Abundant Blessings]

317
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:09,550
Why are you here?

318
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:11,830
Don't forget that before Uncle Gu left,

319
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:13,860
he entrusted the Garden to me.

320
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:21,140
[Abundant Blessings]

321
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:16,190
I have a set of keys

322
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:18,470
for all the locks in this Garden.

323
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:22,430
Sit down and eat.

324
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,100
Why aren't you eating?

325
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:45,470
Haimo, what do you want?

326
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:56,910
Look at this garden.

327
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:59,550
It's only been a while since Uncle Gu left,

328
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:01,750
but the garden already looks deserted.

329
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:04,070
Go get Mrs. Wang back

330
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:04,790
for help.

331
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,390
So, what I said to you

332
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:07,480
was all in vain?

333
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,450
I know what you want to say.

334
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:12,630
Now that everyone thinks

335
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:14,050
I'm a member of your family,

336
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:14,990
then, I'll be it.

337
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,590
I might as well

338
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:18,480
live here

339
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:21,000
and save the board and room expenses in the story-telling theatre.

340
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:21,710
Haimo…

341
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:22,630
Back then, Uncle Gu

342
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:23,890
acknowledged me as his goddaughter

343
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:25,090
in front of everyone.

344
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:26,330
Now, I want to be back and live in Gu's Garden.

345
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:28,330
Are you going to turn your back on me?

346
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:29,070
I...

347
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:30,340
I won't be a freeloader.

348
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:32,570
I'll cook, clean the house, and look after it, too.

349
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:34,770
I'll be in charge of these three things.

350
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:36,490
Don't worry.

351
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:39,020
I won't interfere with your life

352
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,970
or affect your work.

353
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:43,080
Just...

354
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:45,150
Just treat me as a housekeeper.

355
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:47,670
Besides,

356
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,130
you don't want

357
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:50,470
the garden

358
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:51,990
that your father spent so much energy on

359
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:53,110
to decay, do you?

360
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:57,270
But we'll be the only ones living here.

361
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:58,940
Aren't you afraid that the outsiders would…

362
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:00,250
I'm a girl and I'm not even afraid.

363
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:00,850
As a man,

364
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:02,590
are you afraid of others gossiping about you?

365
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:04,350
In these times, the reputaion is nothing,

366
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:06,350
as long as you know yourself what you're like.

367
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:07,350
You even dare to work

368
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:08,400
at No. 90.

369
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:09,880
Why do you care about this?

370
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:12,750
But Mr. Gu,

371
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:14,050
I'll still go to Feng Garden

372
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:15,850
to sing ballads each afternoon.

373
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:17,250
I can support myself.

374
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:22,190
Neither of us

375
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:23,910
is doing a favor to the other.

376
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:26,110
Is anyone home?

377
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,690
We're from the vegetable farm.

378
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:28,910
We're here to deliver the vegetables.

379
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:29,470
Coming.

380
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:35,750
I...

381
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,030
Ms. Haimo.

382
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,230
What? Do you want to see me?

383
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:47,270
Mr. Du,

384
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:50,200
from now on, I can only perform for the matinees.

385
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,910
I can't come in the evening.

386
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:52,990
Can't come?

387
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:54,750
Why?

388
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:56,570
There are the most guests

389
00:20:56,570 --> 00:20:57,700
in the evening show.

390
00:20:58,310 --> 00:20:59,660
Every actor in our theatre

391
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:00,920
wants to perform

392
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:01,940
in the evening.

393
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:06,470
Are you still burdened

394
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:07,830
because of what happened before?

395
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:08,390
No.

396
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:10,190
Something happened at home.

397
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:11,820
Home?

398
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:14,470
You...

399
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:16,330
When did you have a home in Suzhou?

400
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:22,560
Back to Gu's Garden?

401
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,070
I thought

402
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:28,620
you rented a house outside.

403
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,390
Ms. Haimo,

404
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:34,490
why can't you get it straight?

405
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:36,590
I told you long ago

406
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,310
that people all avoided

407
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:40,630
people like Gu Yizhong.

408
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:41,510
But instead,

409
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:42,900
you go to him yourself!

410
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,620
If you have any difficulties,

411
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:47,430
just tell me.

412
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:48,700
Don't forget

413
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:50,410
your master, Zhang Yuquan,

414
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:50,790
was…

415
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:52,910
Mr. Du, thank you for your concern.

416
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:58,650
I know what I'm doing.

417
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:02,230
Sometimes people are just like this,

418
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:03,590
muddleheaded.

419
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:05,330
You knew it was a fire pit,

420
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:07,330
but you'd still jump down.

421
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:27,380
I asked someone to check the inn opposite.

422
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:28,510
No one was watching.

423
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:29,860
Don't worry.

424
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:31,020
I have no tail.

425
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:32,950
It's just that they left.

426
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:34,680
The tail is still there.

427
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:41,290
What are you talking about?

428
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:41,990
Just eat.

429
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:46,230
Gu Yizhong's men are not here.

430
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,870
But Huang Xinzhai's men from the NBIS

431
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,230
are still watching you.

432
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:52,920
Right at the sweet potato stall at the corner.

433
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:56,240
Shall I get someone to deal with Huang?

434
00:22:56,610 --> 00:22:57,140
No need.

435
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:58,580
Keep him for now.

436
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,660
He's still useful.

437
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:06,070
Did the lady performer go back to Gu's Garden?

438
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:09,910
That kid just doesn't get it.

439
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,020
Has she taken the oath?

440
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:13,390
She's not one of us yet.

441
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:16,170
Can you speak plainly?

442
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,810
I heard that she's quite good at ballads.

443
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:24,890
How about I ask the Guangyu Performers' Guild

444
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:26,110
to bring her on board?

445
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,360
Maybe we can use her later.

446
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,850
Don't think about it.

447
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:31,410
She hates our work.

448
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:33,340
I'm sick of

449
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:34,450
you agents, too!

450
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:39,640
Can't even have a meal properly!

451
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:51,790
Go.

452
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:02,670
Go.

453
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:04,030
Be gentle.

454
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:04,870
Be careful.

455
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:06,430
Don't push! Don't push!

456
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:10,250
[Path to Freedom]

457
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:13,270
Captain Zhang,

458
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,320
why did you bring him here in person?

459
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:19,500
This man is important.

460
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,760
Don't let him die.

461
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:22,270
Who is he?

462
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:26,050
Lin Changxing.

463
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:27,220
Where should we lock him?

464
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:28,350
No. 1 in the dungeon.

465
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:30,200
The director personally ordered it.

466
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,460
His level of confidentiality is so high?

467
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,310
Don't let the Japanese know

468
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:41,510
about this man named Lin.

469
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:42,600
Understood.

470
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:45,230
Captain Zhang, the Japanese

471
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:46,800
don't come to our dungeon often.

472
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,260
They think it stinks here.

473
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:49,370
Don't worry.

474
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,110
No one will know he is here.

475
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:02,540
Go!

476
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:07,030
Sir.

477
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:08,780
Open the door!

478
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:09,220
Yes.

479
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,510
Xiao Junxia, I found you a companion.

480
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:31,190
What is this place?

481
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:33,010
I don't want to be locked up here!

482
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,750
Do you know who I am?

483
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:37,440
You can't lock me up here.

484
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:38,810
Do you know who I am?

485
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:40,460
I can't be locked up here!

486
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:41,870
I can't be locked here!

487
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:45,730
What is it?

488
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,520
Like a ghost.

489
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:57,540
What the heck is this place?

490
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,980
What a horrible place!

491
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:27,500
Huizhong.

492
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:31,000
Why are you looking for me so urgently?

493
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:35,420
I'm worried that the rickshaw shop will be exposed,

494
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:37,350
and you and Eagle will be in danger.

495
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:39,850
Why do you say that?

496
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:41,280
I just had this feeling.

497
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:45,460
The liaison point of the rickshaw shop has been cancelled.

498
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:46,880
Ding Jiansheng is dead.

499
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:50,370
Ding Jiansheng is dead?

500
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:52,090
How?

501
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,400
Didn't Zhiping tell you?

502
00:26:55,810 --> 00:26:56,590
Zhiping said

503
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:58,790
he was going to take him to do something.

504
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,820
But as soon as they got there,

505
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,250
he was shot to death.

506
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:04,000
Do you know who did it?

507
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:06,550
No.

508
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:11,540
But one thing is for sure.

509
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:14,360
It's related to Cell 8.

510
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:18,830
And before Ding Jiansheng died,

511
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:21,620
I received a secret letter.

512
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:23,850
The one who killed Ding Jiansheng

513
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:25,950
is Cell 8.

514
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:31,520
Who sent the secret letter?

515
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:33,670
I guess it's Yizhong.

516
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:39,190
You're still suspecting Cell 8?

517
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:41,020
Don't you, Huizhong?

518
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,510
Yizhong is your brother.

519
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,720
If we can prove

520
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:45,830
his innocence,

521
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,020
we should all be happy.

522
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:52,980
My heart is in a mess because of this.

523
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,400
Huizhong,

524
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:03,270
think about it.

525
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,070
Yizhong must have had

526
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:08,550
a hard time these days.

527
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:10,990
We must find out

528
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:12,270
the real mastermind

529
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:13,270
to clear his name.

530
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:15,430
I believe in this world,

531
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:17,710
there is not many people Yizhong

532
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:18,870
can trust.

533
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:21,200
Apart from me,

534
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,940
there's only you, his sister.

535
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:30,900
Excuse me.

536
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,960
Have you seen this woman?

537
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:34,690
She has short hair

538
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:36,110
and a protruding canine.

539
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:37,440
Take a closer look.

540
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:39,240
No.

541
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:45,670
Excuse me.

542
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:47,790
Have you seen this woman?

543
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:48,670
With short hair?

544
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:49,070
No.

545
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:49,530
She has a protruding canine.

546
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:50,990
Please take a closer look.

547
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,200
Excuse me.

548
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,440
Have you seen this woman?

549
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:02,540
She has short hair.

550
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,290
-One of her canine teeth protrudes.
-No.

551
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:04,750
Please take a closer look.

552
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:16,430
Who?

553
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,550
Huizhong.

554
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:33,610
What took you so long?

555
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:36,990
The nearby pharmacy is closed.

556
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:40,590
I told you not to buy it.

557
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:42,020
It's late.

558
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:54,850
I saw Yizhong

559
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:57,230
at the intersection.

560
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:06,650
How did he find this place?

561
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:11,350
He came for us?

562
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:14,030
I think so.

563
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,320
Zhiping.

564
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:23,390
Tomorrow, I'll go find a place to stay.

565
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:25,380
We have to move.

566
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:29,100
Everything is settled?

567
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:29,870
Yes.

568
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:32,270
He has been locked up in the dungeon.

569
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:35,230
He chose to take the hard way.

570
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:37,940
Let's see how long he can last.

571
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:40,230
Mr. Li.

572
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:44,510
Why did Jiang Boxian come to Shanghai at this time?

573
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:47,290
He's the secret envoy sent by Chiang.

574
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:51,430
He came to negotiate with the Japanese in private.

575
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:55,960
Chiang really wants to negotiate with the Japanese?

576
00:30:56,030 --> 00:30:59,350
Mr. Wang knows Mr. Chiang well.

577
00:31:00,810 --> 00:31:03,790
Chiang always talks about fighting against Japan.

578
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:06,320
But in the end, he's still the same—

579
00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:08,900
looking for a backup plan for himself.

580
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:13,390
What he really cares about

581
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:15,000
is to wipe out the CPC.

582
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:18,310
Unfortunately,

583
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:20,400
though Ye Ting was arrested

584
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,350
during the South Anhui Incident,

585
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:23,630
there comes Chen Yi.

586
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:27,830
The New Fourth Army have developed 6 more divisions.

587
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:29,970
They're everywhere near Taihu Lake.

588
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:31,970
Troublesome!

589
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:35,750
Mr. Li, the Japanese

590
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:36,810
already chose to

591
00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:38,410
work with Mr. Wang.

592
00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:39,790
Why did they still contact

593
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:41,630
Chongqing in private?

594
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:45,930
Do you think the Japanese

595
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:47,710
are so united?

596
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:51,220
Their headquarters

597
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:53,580
are divided to the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff

598
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:55,110
and the Navy General Staff .

599
00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:58,770
And often, the Army has one thought,

600
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:00,300
and the Navy has another.

601
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:04,390
One wants to go north

602
00:32:04,410 --> 00:32:06,140
to fight against the Russians,

603
00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:08,700
while the other is trying to go south

604
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:11,200
to get oil and rubber.

605
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:14,550
It is very complicated.

606
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:16,430
I see.

607
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:19,510
Just like our CBIS and NBIS.

608
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:20,630
It's the same.

609
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:22,110
We're all humans.

610
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:24,220
All humans are the same.

611
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:26,360
Sir,

612
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,930
the Japanese

613
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:31,950
wants to negotiate with Chongqing.

614
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:35,030
The contact between them

615
00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:36,590
is in our hands.

616
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:39,270
The agent of the Japanese

617
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:40,740
must know about this.

618
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:43,590
Why don't they dare to ask us for this person?

619
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:45,920
They came to negotiate with the Japanese.

620
00:32:46,930 --> 00:32:50,550
Can they put it in public?

621
00:32:52,050 --> 00:32:53,110
It's not glorious.

622
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:55,990
Mr. Wang also said,

623
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:59,790
if the Japanese really come to ask for him,

624
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:02,840
push them back.

625
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:06,450
Let's pretend that we don't know anything.

626
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:10,310
If things get too ugly,

627
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:13,220
get rid of him.

628
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:15,970
I can just go back

629
00:33:16,670 --> 00:33:17,870
and get rid of him now.

630
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:19,440
Only when it's necessary.

631
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:21,470
He's been a member of the Central Committee for a long time.

632
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:23,130
He's also Chiang's relative.

633
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:26,380
We'd better keep him as long as it's possible.

634
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:27,090
Got it.

635
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:29,550
Remember,

636
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,140
don't let Kondo know.

637
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:33,680
He won't.

638
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:35,220
Kondo

639
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,980
went to Nanjing for a meeting recently.

640
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:38,240
He won't be back soon.

641
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:39,670
Besides,

642
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:41,640
Jiang Boxian is being locked in the dungeon.

643
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:44,300
The people working in the dungeon are all my men.

644
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:46,910
The Japanese at No. 90

645
00:33:46,930 --> 00:33:49,980
can't go down there without my order.

646
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:54,730
I don't care about Kondo.

647
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,240
I'm not afraid of them.

648
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:08,790
You always say the Japanese are against you.

649
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:10,239
Why is that?

650
00:34:11,739 --> 00:34:13,159
I think you should

651
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:16,010
look for the reason in yourself.

652
00:34:17,290 --> 00:34:18,550
I don't have a problem.

653
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:26,630
Who's Kondo?

654
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,600
The advisor at No. 90.

655
00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:30,600
The advisor at No. 90.

656
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:31,510
Zhifei.

657
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:37,030
One more friend, one more way.

658
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:42,520
One less enemy, one less obstacle.

659
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:45,320
You mean, on the surface, I should

660
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:47,389
show respect to Kondo, right?

661
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:51,040
Keep it in mind.

662
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:59,030
Why are you knocking at your own house?

663
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:00,520
Come out and have a little chat.

664
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,720
Come inside, if you've anything to say.

665
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:09,310
What?

666
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:12,040
Are you afraid I'll eat you?

667
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:13,550
What is it?

668
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:18,380
Jiang Boxian is at No. 90,

669
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,490
but I can't save him.

670
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:22,580
Mr. Li is watching closely.

671
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:24,150
And No. 76 in Shanghai

672
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:25,570
specially sent two teams

673
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:26,720
to keep an eye on him.

674
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,870
You promised to help me.

675
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:32,510
Do you know why Jiang Boxian

676
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:33,940
came to Suzhou?

677
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:41,590
To negotiate with the Japanese secretly.

678
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:45,590
It's not my responsibility but that of the higher-ups.

679
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:47,390
I'm only in charge of saving him.

680
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:49,550
Look at you.

681
00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:52,230
As agents,

682
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:55,300
we shouldn't just be information brokers.

683
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:58,060
We should also be political police

684
00:35:58,370 --> 00:36:00,100
and have political awareness.

685
00:36:00,530 --> 00:36:02,110
Even Chiang Kai-shek is seeking peace

686
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:03,950
with the Japanese in private.

687
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,360
Why do you agents

688
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:07,590
still risk your lives for him?

689
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:09,160
That's impossible.

690
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:10,670
Don't be too naive.

691
00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:13,670
Everyone wants to leave a way out for themselves.

692
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:15,090
What you're saying now

693
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:16,690
is for the newspaper.

694
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:19,530
If Chiang Kai-shek fights with the Japanese every day

695
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:20,880
and ends up exhausted,

696
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,880
guess who will gain from the result?

697
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:25,550
Everyone can puzzle it out.

698
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:30,480
Think of a way out for yourself.

699
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:32,710
You don't have to tell me this.

700
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:33,970
I just focus on my task.

701
00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:36,710
Mr. Xu sent another telegram to press me.

702
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:37,710
You really

703
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:39,270
won't change at all.

704
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:41,990
Stop sending telegrams.

705
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:44,750
Huang Xinzhai is an expert

706
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:46,150
at finding telegraphs.

707
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:48,480
Recently, the Japanese gave him

708
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,160
a device for him to find telegrahs.

709
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,000
He'll know where your telegraph is with it.

710
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:52,920
Be careful.

711
00:36:56,290 --> 00:36:57,820
Then you have to think of a plan to save Jiang.

712
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:59,160
I don't have a plan.

713
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:01,290
How will you explain to Mr. Xu?

714
00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:02,550
I don't care about him.

715
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:03,890
I work for Mr. Li.

716
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:06,110
I can't betray Mr. Li.

717
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:08,310
What did Mr. Li give you?

718
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:09,990
You betrayed Xu Enzeng.

719
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:11,110
You betrayed me.

720
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,480
But you just can't bear to betray Mr. Li.

721
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:17,360
Does he love you that much?

722
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:19,470
Only I know how it feels, I guess.

723
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:23,550
Xinping, how about this?

724
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:25,430
I won't help you save him.

725
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:26,910
But I can guarantee

726
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:30,110
my men won't hurt Jiang Boxian.

727
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:32,120
He won't confess under duress.

728
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:33,150
Besides,

729
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:35,750
we won't let him contact the Japanese.

730
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:38,780
As long as he's tough enough to not confess,

731
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:40,190
no one outside will know the fact

732
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:42,230
that Chongqing wants to negotiate with Japan

733
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:42,900
in secret.

734
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:44,660
What do you think?

735
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:47,370
What about Jiang Boxian?

736
00:37:47,370 --> 00:37:48,370
Why do you care?

737
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:50,320
Just take him as an abandoned pawn.

738
00:37:50,890 --> 00:37:53,170
Zhou Zhifei, come down.

739
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:54,510
Coming.

740
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:02,620
Calm down.

741
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:04,990
Go.

742
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:13,090
Liu.

743
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:14,370
Here.

744
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,380
Here's Cui Yaomin's file.

745
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:24,340
Okay.

746
00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:26,770
Sign here.

747
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:34,780

[Note: Xiao Junxia]

749
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:40,580
Go!

750
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:40,770
[Note: Xiao Junxia]

00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:47,700
Here.

752
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,820
You have a lot of files.

753
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:51,990
Yes, these cabinets are all full.

754
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:54,850
I'm going to ask Vice Director Huang to buy two more.

755
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:04,680
Xiao Junxia,

756
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:06,230
come with us.

757
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:08,540
Take him away!

758
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:25,210
Section Chief Xie.

760
00:39:49,490 --> 00:39:50,490
I'm really sorry.

763
00:39:58,030 --> 00:39:59,100
I'm really sorry.

764
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:01,080
I forgot something. I was in a hurry to go back.

765
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:03,000
Don't be so flustered in the future.

766
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
I'm really sorry.

767
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:48,230
Did he see it clearly?

768
00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:49,390
Yes.

769
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:50,530
He saw Xiao in person once.

770
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:52,700
Then, he saw the name on the file once again.

771
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:53,360
Okay.

772
00:40:54,330 --> 00:40:56,140
I really want to see

773
00:40:56,410 --> 00:40:57,310
how Gu Yizhong

774
00:40:57,350 --> 00:40:59,990
will do, facing this dilemma?

775
00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:02,390
What if he thinks it's a trap

776
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:04,260
and won't rescue him?

777
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,860
Then I'll give him the task

778
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:07,990
of executing Xiao Junxia himself.

779
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:10,130
In this way,

780
00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:13,460
he'll never be able to clear his name for the rest of his life.

781
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:29,680

782
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:31,260
Come here.

783
00:41:35,110 --> 00:41:36,570
Would you take the trouble

784
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:38,480
to send the prisoner to the dungeon

785
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,450
and hand him over to Lu?

786
00:41:39,450 --> 00:41:40,490
He's a cop.

787
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:42,550
Ask him to sign on the file

788
