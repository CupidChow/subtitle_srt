[Episode 23]

4
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:39,830
You…

5
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:42,310
just relax.

6
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:44,070
Since you're here,

7
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,229
you can go out for a walk.

8
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:50,190
There are many good places in Suzhou.

9
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:51,680
You can visit anywhere.

10
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,810
In that case,

11
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,570
let's go visit the Willow Garden.

12
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:01,270
Sure.

13
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:03,470
Two years ago,

14
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:06,780
I tried to copy the Painting of the Tiger Hill,

15
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,710
but I just couldn't present

16
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:11,520
the garden part very well.

17
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:14,290
Mr. Jiang.

18
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:18,950
Do you have the Painting of the Tiger Hill by Qian Gu of the Ming Dynasty

19
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:20,120
in your hands?

20
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:23,660
That is a rare treasure.

21
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:24,960
Did you bring it?

22
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:26,240
I want to see it, too.

23
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:30,350
No problem.

24
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:34,710
You said tomorrow yourself.

25
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:36,420
Do you hear that?

26
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:38,770
I'm going on a trip tomorrow.

27
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:40,910
Stop making excuses.

28
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:43,150
Mr. Jiang, don't be angry.

29
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:44,420
Mr. Li has ordered us

30
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,190
to only listen to Mr. Zhou

31
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:48,440
when it comes to matters in Suzhou.

32
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:50,250
I've no objection.

33
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:53,840
Then...

34
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,750
that's it.

35
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:57,270
Okay.

36
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:03,530
I'll send some to you later.

37
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:05,000
Thank you so much.

38
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,270
You're welcome.

39
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:07,270
See you.

40
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:07,750
See you.

41
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:08,470
Okay, Mrs. Jiang.

42
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:08,870
Take care.

43
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:09,150
Goodbye.

44
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:09,460
Goodbye.

45
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:09,670
Okay.

46
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:11,110
Tell me if you need anything.

47
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:11,510
I will.

48
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:15,150
Go back.

49
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:20,680
Have you made a deal with Jiang?

50
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:23,790
I gave him a chance to escape.

51
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,460
Whether he lives or dies

52
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:26,790
depends on his own fate.

53
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:30,410
It's coming, Zhou!

54
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:34,200
There are not only ten gold bars

55
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:38,030
but also a bracelet.

56
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,530
You just like these worthless things.

57
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:43,870
Do you know what's his most valuable possession?

58
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:48,030
The Painting of the Tiger Hill from the Ming Dynasty

59
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:49,010
is in his hands.

60
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:50,450
That is priceless.

61
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:54,020
Go back now.

62
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:55,030
Get it.

63
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:56,870
Go back to No. 90.

64
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:07,930
Sir!

65
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:10,230
How many times have I told you?

66
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:11,690
You're always in a flurry.

67
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:13,240
Sir.

68
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:14,690
Gu Yizhong is here.

69
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:17,649
Didn't he run away?

70
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:20,000
He came to work as usual in the morning.

71
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,300
Warden Lu is not here?

72
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:31,630
Lu ran away.

73
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:33,110
Why did he run away?

74
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:34,770
It's all because of that hole.

75
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:36,190
The Japanese put pressure on him.

76
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:37,190
Lu is not stupid.

77
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:39,490
He can't stay here as a scapegoat, right?

78
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:45,510
That's interesting.

79
00:04:46,909 --> 00:04:48,290
Cell 8 was exposed.

80
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,550
And he saved Xiao Junxia.

81
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:53,040
Logically, in the communist party,

82
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,300
he should be able to prove his innocence.

83
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,260
But he still came back.

84
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:59,030
Interesting.

85
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:01,870
He is Mr. Si's spy.

86
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:03,320
No doubt about that.

87
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:05,310
If so,

88
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:07,550
what can you do?

89
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:10,830
He has Mr. Si as his backer and is undercover.

90
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:12,490
Kondo is also protecting him.

91
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:14,990
What can we do?

92
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:15,990
Yes.

93
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:17,110
About Lu,

94
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:19,070
is everything arranged for him?

95
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:19,790
Yes.

96
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,830
I let the warden escape overnight.

97
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:24,030
I guess he's already out of Jiangsu now.

98
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:26,690
There's another news.

99
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:28,320
You need to spread it for me.

100
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,600
Surely, he couldn't quit a job

101
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,800
that earns 80 a month!

102
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,690
Money isn't as important as life.

103
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,870
But Lu prefers the money.

104
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:48,890
Everyone, assemble!

105
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:52,630
Mr. Kondo is going to give us all a speech.

106
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:53,909
Let's go!

107
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:55,880
Yizhong.

108
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:57,550
Did something happen again?

109
00:05:58,030 --> 00:05:58,909
Yesterday afternoon, Iwai went out

110
00:05:58,909 --> 00:05:59,750
with four or five people,

111
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:00,790
and he didn't come back until midnight.

112
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:01,190
Clang…

113
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:03,470
Clang, clack… They kept at it almost all night.

114
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:05,470
I wonder who's in trouble this time.

115
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:06,670
Attention!

116
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:11,000
The news that the dungeon was blown up

117
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,590
has been spread to Nanjing.

118
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:17,350
Everyone in the advisory body and the military police

119
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:18,700
is laughing at me.

120
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:21,830
Someone has to

121
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,900
pay the price for this matter!

122
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:28,400
Bring him over.

123
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:37,870
For the last time,

124
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:39,950
where is Jiang?

125
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:42,030
I really don't...

126
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:02,790
This is the result of deceiving and betraying the imperial army.

127
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:08,870
The person in the photo is Jiang Boxian.

128
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:11,170
He's hiding somewhere in Suzhou.

129
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:13,030
Whoever finds him

130
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:15,270
will be awarded 10,000 yuan.

131
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:18,340
If you know something

132
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:20,100
but not report it,

133
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:22,630
you will end up

134
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:23,950
like Lu.

135
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:28,860
Understand?

136
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:29,510
Yes!

137
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:39,170
Director,

138
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:42,550
I think the dungeon incident

139
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:44,680
must have something to do

140
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,880
with someone inside our agent station.

141
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:48,570
Who do you think

142
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:50,270
he could be?

143
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:53,230
Could it be…

144
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:54,870
Gu Yizhong?

145
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:57,190
Or…

146
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:58,909
Vice Director Huang.

147
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:01,070
Just get to the point.

148
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:02,870
Don't beat around the bush.

149
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:03,590
Okay.

150
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:07,510
According to the landlord in Pishi Street,

151
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:08,470
that house

152
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:09,920
was only rented out seven or eight days

153
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,120
before the incident.

154
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:14,370
They needed to dig a tunnel from that house

155
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:15,570
to our agent station.

156
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:17,890
Meanwhile, the person was also aware of the existence of the secret canal.

157
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:20,630
If it was not someone who was a professional architect

158
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:22,960
and knew the underground structure well,

159
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,950
it was impossible to make it.

160
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:31,910
Gu Yizhong's major is architecture.

161
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,900
That's one of the reasons.

162
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,510
Secondly,

163
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,919
the tunnel goes straight to the cell,

164
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:41,070
which means they knew

165
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:42,840
the exact location of the cell.

166
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:46,320
I checked the records of access to the prison.

167
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:48,110
Before the incident,

168
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:50,870
Gu Yizhong had been to the prison.

169
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:57,870
What's the third point?

170
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:58,670
Thirdly,

171
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:02,660
Xiao Junxia was Gu Yizhong's former leader.

172
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,830
Logically speaking,

173
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:06,510
they must have had a strong emotional connection.

174
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:07,740
There's the motive.

175
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:10,350
So, about the dungeon incident,

176
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:13,010
Gu Yizhong is the most suspicious.

177
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:25,550
Vice Director Huang,

178
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:28,030
what do you mean by telling me this?

179
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:28,830
Director.

180
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:30,910
This is an important matter.

181
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:33,590
I dare not neglect it.

182
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:36,400
Don't worry, Director.

183
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:38,590
Whether it's a friend or family,

184
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,710
as long as it affects the great cause of the Empire's

185
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:41,510
peace movement,

186
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:42,910
I can sacrifice them all!

187
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:45,470
Amazing.

188
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:47,950
You're such a talent.

189
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:49,510
So mean.

190
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:52,950
Director.

191
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:56,670
But you've always taught us not to do anything

192
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:59,840
that will only hurt others but bring no benefits to ourselves.

193
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,450
Look.

194
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:03,820
You only remember the useless things that I said.

195
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:09,060
Director,

196
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:13,790
do you have something

197
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,680
on Gu Yizhong?

198
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:19,160
Why did you start to accuse me, too?

199
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:20,630
No, well...

200
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:23,660
You have a blood feud with him.

201
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:25,010
Think about

202
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,470
Gu Yizhong's father's death

203
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:27,800
and his sister's death,

204
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,110
right?

205
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:30,030
And Director,

206
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:34,380
why didn't you tell Mr. Kondo

207
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:36,650
but let Lu take the blame?

208
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,160
Xinzhai.

209
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:43,100
Why didn't you tell the Japanese

210
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:45,150
what you just said to me,

211
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,800
but instead, you came to me?

212
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:51,990
After all, these are just speculations.

213
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,450
We can't arrest him without evidence.

214
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:55,860
That's right!

215
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:58,110
After all this time,

216
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:00,750
it's the first time we've been on the same page.

217
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:02,440
Listen.

218
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:04,000
Now, in Suzhou Station,

219
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,350
there are both CBIS

220
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:08,150
and NBIS members.

221
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,370
And now, there's even a Mr. Si.

222
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:11,570
It's so lively now.

223
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:13,150
Right?

224
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:14,510
Director,

225
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,390
don't listen to their nonsense.

226
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,630
What NBIS?

227
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:20,870
I'm always at your command.

228
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:22,350
Thank you.

229
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:24,000
Director,

230
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:27,270
don't let Xie Wenchao investigate me anymore.

231
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:30,740
I have nothing to do with Chongqing.

232
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:31,600
Really?

233
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:32,990
Really!

234
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:35,590
I promise

235
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:37,950
I won't tattle on you

236
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:39,990
to the Japanese.

237
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:41,950
Have you done that before?

238
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:44,430
No, of course not!

239
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:45,070
Really?

240
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:46,290
Really, really.

241
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,940
They were all just regular work reports.

242
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:51,870
Xinzhai.

243
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,230
Thank you

244
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:54,790
for being so honest with me.

245
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:55,860
Tonight,

246
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:57,870
I'll borrow your kitchen.

247
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:00,470
Right!

248
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:02,980
Let's have a drink

249
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:03,910
to relax a little.

250
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:04,790
No, no.

251
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:06,430
You misunderstood.

252
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:06,960
Xinzhai.

253
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:10,390
I'm going to treat someone to dinner

254
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:11,560
at the dorm tonight.

255
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:13,010
But we don't have a kitchen in our place.

256
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:14,040
So, I want my wife

257
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:17,070
to cook some dishes in your kitchen.

258
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:18,230
Is that okay?

259
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:19,190
Sure.

260
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,250
How about

261
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:22,450
you come too and have a drink tonight?

262
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,170
No.

263
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:25,150
I happen to have something to do tonight.

264
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:26,750
Okay. That's too bad, then.

265
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:29,270
I'll tell your wife.

266
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,350
Yizhong.

267
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:14,870
You're here.

268
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:16,790
Come in and sit down.

269
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:18,450
Come in.

270
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:19,970
Make yourself at home.

271
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:21,790
My wife

272
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:23,630
learned that I was going to treat you to dinner,

273
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:24,830
so she made you some dishes

274
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:26,360
from our hometown, Yixing.

275
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:30,130
Braised bamboo shoots with salted pork.

276
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:31,470
Matsutake mushroom.

277
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:32,630
Try them.

278
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,230
Here's a toast to you.

279
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,270
You…

280
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:52,630
You're just like an old agent.

281
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,470
Look.

282
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:58,670
It's Wu Sibao's fault.

283
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,230
He was locked in No. 90

284
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:04,130
and was poisoned to death.

285
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:06,590
From then on,

286
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:08,480
the agents

287
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:10,690
could no longer trust each other.

288
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,410
Director, you called me here.

289
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:18,230
Just say it directly.

290
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:22,870
In this Braised bamboo shoots with salted pork,

291
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:23,990
the bamboo shoots

292
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:26,310
are a big deal.

293
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:29,200
They were brought here

294
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:30,750
by Mr. Li's friend from North Fujian

295
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,550
at the beginning of the year.

296
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:34,870
They're different from ours.

297
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:36,470
We use spring bamboo shoots.

298
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:38,280
They use winter bamboo shoots.

299
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:46,030
My wife and I

300
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,120
have been reluctant to eat them.

301
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:50,010
We have stored them in the fridge.

302
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,550
Knowing you were coming for dinner,

303
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:55,550
I especially went back to the Mansion to get them here.

304
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:03,790
Yizhong,

305
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:05,670
your sister's death

306
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,630
really had nothing to do with me.

307
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,680
Believe it or not,

308
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:15,490
it hurts me, too.

309
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:17,200
After all,

310
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,640
she died in the hands of her beloved one.

311
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:26,520
She loved the wrong person.

312
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:28,570
Maybe.

313
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:31,750
Your brother-in-law,

314
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:35,630
I mean Hu Zhiping,

315
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:38,070
was shot to death by me.

316
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:40,800
I kind of took revenge for your sister,

317
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,100
right?

318
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:44,860
This is to your sister.

319
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:52,200
Why did you come back to No. 90?

320
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,870
I have unfinished things to do, of course.

321
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:00,070
Are you targeting me?

322
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:03,750
I'm not like you.

323
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:06,640
You only care about personal grudges.

324
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:10,320
Do you know why?

325
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,540
That's because I know

326
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:14,950
matters of national interest

327
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:17,020
are beyond the capabilities

328
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:18,690
of small potatoes like us.

329
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:22,720
Cell 8 has been exposed.

330
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,430
You saved Xiao Junxia, too.

331
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:28,870
Listen to me.

332
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:31,090
Let go when you should.

333
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:36,520
Why don't you brush off your robes and leave, when matters are settled?

334
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:43,690
Is No. 90 a place that one can leave so easily?

335
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:45,830
Director,

336
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:47,750
I remember you told us

337
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,080
when giving us classes,

338
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:50,720
that our work as agents,

339
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:52,630
in the end,

340
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,640
is political work.

341
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:57,640
We should be loyal to the party,

342
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,640
to the country,

343
00:16:59,310 --> 00:16:59,910
and to our leader.

344
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:01,240
You're in it for one day,

345
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:04,990
and you'll be in it for the rest of your life.

346
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:07,720
Yizhong.

347
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:09,660
Well said!

348
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,290
You're indeed my best student.

349
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:16,790
I almost believed it.

350
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:21,960
Director.

351
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,050
In this world,

352
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:26,550
everyone has shortcomings.

353
00:17:27,569 --> 00:17:29,700
No need to die for the Japanese, right?

354
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:34,270
Everyone has seen

355
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:36,200
the end of Lu Yaoting today.

356
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,550
That is also what I wanted to say.

357
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:43,750
Yizhong,

358
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:47,230
we have no grudge against each other,

359
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:47,760
right?

360
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:50,450
Your father's death has nothing to do with me.

361
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:52,310
Your sister's death has nothing to do with me, either.

362
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:53,380
We have no grudge.

363
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,850
Even if there is,

364
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:57,470
it's your grudge against the Japanese.

365
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,110
Right?

366
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:01,150
Of course.

367
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:03,070
So,

368
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:04,830
I won't stand in your way.

369
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:05,470
And you…

370
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:09,870
give me an out, too.

371
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:10,450
Okay?

372
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:17,700
You're right, Director.

373
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:21,830
That's why I always think

374
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,630
you're the most promising one

375
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:25,030
at No. 90.

376
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:28,420
Mr. Li will come to Suzhou

377
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:29,630
in a while.

378
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:32,030
I'll introduce you to him by then.

379
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:36,590
You haven't answered me

380
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:40,140
why you came back to No. 90, have you?

381
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,870
For Jiang Boxian, right?

382
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,430
The reward of 10,000 yuan

383
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:52,070
is not easy to get.

384
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:58,110
Mr. Gu,

385
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,910
would you value 10,000 yuan?

386
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,200
You.

387
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:09,550
Go tell your friends,

388
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:13,190
Jiang Boxian is a wanted criminal by Mr. Li.

389
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:14,920
No one can take him away.

390
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:17,670
The one who wants Jiang Boxian most now

391
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:19,870
is Kondo, right?

392
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:21,480
No, it's me.

393
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:24,640
Everyone thinks

394
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:28,150
Jiang Boxian was under my control.

395
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:31,630
As time goes on,

396
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:33,500
try to imagine

397
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:36,310
my suffering.

398
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:51,950
Director,

399
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:54,190
thank you for inviting me.

400
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:55,430
See you.

401
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:04,400
Are you leaving already?

402
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,820
The dishes are not all served yet.

403
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:12,860
Yizhong.

404
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,760
Vice Director Huang?

405
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:21,750
What happened?

406
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:24,360
The chopsticks were not even used.

407
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:32,270
They've cooked the bamboo shoots saved for

408
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:33,490
the Spring Festival.

409
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:37,470
How is it possible that Zhou Zhifei didn't get great benefits?

410
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:38,160
Yizhong.

411
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:40,550
Don't believe him.

412
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,080
That old man never tells the truth.

413
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:46,270
Not necessarily.

414
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:49,420
See?

415
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:50,650
You're poisoned.

416
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:52,650
You're already poisoned, Yizhong.

417
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:57,160
Do you want to make contributions with me?

418
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:01,150
Tell me.

419
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,690
I found traces of Jiang Boxian.

420
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:11,030
The two agents

421
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:12,830
from No. 76 got drunk.

422
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:16,410
They said Jiang Boxian would go to Willow Garden tomorrow.

423
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:20,590
Vice Director Huang.

424
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:21,870
It seems that you'll earn

425
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:23,060
10,000 yuan soon.

426
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:27,270
It's not about money.

427
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:30,950
Yizhong,

428
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:34,750
I need help now.

429
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,110
If you work with me,

430
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:42,020
I won't mistreat.

431
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:48,830
Think about it.

432
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:51,750
Consider it.

433

435
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:06,180
I got it.

436
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:08,520
You didn't call the extension number?

437
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:11,290
Oh, I listened to you. I dialed directly.

Tomorrow afternoon, Willow Garden.

440
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:18,740

441
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:30,040
You're here, sir.

442
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,040
Have a seat upstairs.

443
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,140
Take care, sir.

444

449
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:56,150
Why did you pick such a place to meet?

450
00:22:57,230 --> 00:23:00,630
The lowly brothels are the second best place

451
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:01,990
for a temporary meeting

452
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:03,270
of agents.

453
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:05,670
Only the NBIS teaches things like that.

454
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,010
If Mr. Xu knows

455
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:10,090
we come to such a place to talk business,

456
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:12,230
he'll scold us.

457
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:15,020
That's why

458
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:19,150
Mr. Xu couldn't climb as high as Mr. Dai.

459
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:22,890
You looked for me so urgently.

460
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:23,970
Have you found him?

461
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:29,310
We have the time and place of Jiang Boxian's whereabouts.

00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:32,030

Xinzhai,

478
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:30,910
that's too much to talk like that.

Back in Chongqing,

480
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:32,550
I took better care of your mother

481
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:33,950
than my own mother.

482
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:36,860

484
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:40,120
Why are you suspicious now?

485
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:41,510
No, no, no.

486
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,700
If it weren't for my old mother,

487
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:48,270
I wouldn't do such a risky thing.

Zhou Zhifei was assassinated.

He has already suspected

490
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:55,750
that I leaked his home address.

491
00:24:57,150 --> 00:24:58,290

492
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:00,440

00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:08,000
wait at the back door of the Willow Garden.

497
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,190
Say it.

498
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:25,330
Tomorrow afternoon, Jiang Boxian will go to the Willow Garden.

499
00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:26,750
How many people will there be? How many guns?

500
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:28,410
I don't know the exact number.

501
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:30,750
The security of Jiang Boxian

502
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:31,870

503
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:32,590
from No. 76.

504
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:34,590
He has two bodyguards.

505
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:37,670
The number of security guards outside is unknown.

506
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,620

Cousin-in-law,

509
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:45,660
I'm somewhat suspicious of this piece of intelligence.

510
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:48,920
Jiang Boxian's whereabouts have always been mysterious.

511
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:50,870
No one from No. 90 knew about anything about it

512
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:51,950
except Zhou Zhifei.

513
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:53,030
But last night,

514
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:55,190
there suddenly was news.

515
00:25:57,300 --> 00:26:01,590
You think the information is unreliable because it comes from a single source?

516
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:02,520
On the contrary,

517
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:04,150
there are two sources

518
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:05,470
confirming this information.

519
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:07,070
It is just too coincidental.

520
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:08,550

521
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:10,670
someone leaked the news on purpose.

522

00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:13,230

a member of the Central Committee of Kuomintang for a long time.

00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:11,540

00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:16,110
to talk with the Japanese secretly,

00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:04,300
had something to do with him.

762
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:05,310
These gold bars

763
00:42:05,370 --> 00:42:06,500
were found

764
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:07,960
in Huang Xinzhai's house.

765
00:42:08,990 --> 00:42:10,980
So, you've been investigating him for a long time.

766
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:12,870
Why didn't you report it earlier?

767
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,770
Didn't you ask us

768
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:17,700
to unite and make a good job of the peace movement?

769
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:20,950
I wouldn't dare to tell on him.

770
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:23,640
I was afraid you'd say I undermined the unity.

771
00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:26,370
Besides, I didn't have enough evidence.

772
00:42:26,370 --> 00:42:27,120
Now, it's different.

773
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:27,750
By the way,

774
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:29,270
look.

775
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:31,880
There's a photo here.

776
00:42:31,910 --> 00:42:33,530
It's the photo taken when he was meeting

777
00:42:33,530 --> 00:42:34,920
with the Chongqing agents.

778
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,270
We took it on the spot.

779
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:39,450
And the previous Willow Garden operation.

780
00:42:39,450 --> 00:42:40,430
Huang Xinzhai

781
00:42:40,450 --> 00:42:42,540
listened to the order of the Chongqing regime

782
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:44,190
and saved Jiang Boxian.

783
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:45,230
Luckily,

784
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,550
you saw through their plot in time.

785
00:42:48,790 --> 00:42:50,190
Jiang Boxian has escaped?

786
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:50,920
Don't worry.

787
00:42:51,170 --> 00:42:53,230
The entire city has been locked down.

788
00:42:53,510 --> 00:42:55,310
We can catch him sooner or later.

789
00:42:58,350 --> 00:42:59,480
Where is Ou Xinping?

790
00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:06,450
I'll follow your instructions.

791
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:09,650
Is the rumor about your relationship with Ou Xinping true?
