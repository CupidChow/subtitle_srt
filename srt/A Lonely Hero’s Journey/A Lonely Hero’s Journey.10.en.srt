This notice Gu Xixing posted

00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:54,539
is his way of telling his son,

10
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:56,150
"I'm not leaving.

11
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,740
And even if I do leave, it will only be after my 60th birthday."

12

Director,

14
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,710
could you assign someone else

15
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:14,290
to monitor Gu Yizhong?

16
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,350
He's too cunning.

17
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:16,820
I really can't do it.

18
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:21,950
Either you recommend someone to me,

19
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:24,280
or I'll go.

20
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:25,790
I'll monitor him myself.

21
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:31,970

You keep it.

34
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:51,230
I don't think that's appropriate.

35
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:53,290
I have many watches like this at home.

36
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:55,570
You keep it for appreciation.

37
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:00,050
Then, I'll just accept it.

I'll tell Miao later.

148

187
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:46,170
Okay. Coming.

188
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:49,670
So comfy.

189
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:16,790
Division Commander.

190
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:22,650
Sir...

191
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:27,600
Are you eavesdropping?

192
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:28,930
Not in that mood.

193
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,200
I'm going to

194
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:32,830
decline Master Gu's kindness.

195
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:34,030
What did you just say?

196
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:36,490
I'm not the real Haimo.

197
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:39,130
I can't do this anymore.

198
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:42,390
I'm going to Master Gu now

199
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,850
to tell him everything.

200
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:46,190
Stop!

201
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:50,130
This hairpin of mine has been soaked in potassium cyanide.

202
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:52,710
It's for killing myself when there's no other choice.

203
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:54,720
If I just jabbed a little bit harder,

204
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:57,510
you'd be dead for sure, even if you had nine lives.

205
00:13:57,510 --> 00:13:58,950
I'm not kidding.

206
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:02,070
Also, don't forget

207
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:05,280
that if anything goes wrong

208
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:06,550
with this operation,

209
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:08,640
your brother in the Air Force

210
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:10,510
will soon be dead too.

211
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:12,070
Do you hear me?

212
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:18,770
From your brother.

213
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:22,020
Forwarded from the liaison office.

214
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:23,720
For the sake of your brother

215
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:25,550
serving in the army for the country,

216
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:27,380
I'll let it slide today.

217
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:31,550
But if you threaten to disrupt the operation again,

218
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:33,590
there will be consequences.

219
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:44,390
Dear Sister Juan,

220
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:46,110
It's been months since we parted.

221
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:47,240
I miss you very much.

222
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:51,380
I've graduated from Aviation School and am serving in the Air Force now.

223
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:53,090
Conditions at the base are very difficult,

224
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:54,940
and the food here is coarse and hard to swallow.

225
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:56,920
But we are very passionate.

226
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,910
The thought of piloting the plane into the air

227
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:00,260
and fighting against the Japs,

228
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:01,720
fills us with high morale.

229
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:05,030
The only thing I miss now is

230
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:08,880
when I can visit Gele Mountain with you again.

231
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:28,600
Yizhong,

232
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:31,810
why didn't you call me when you were done?

233
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:33,540
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

234
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:34,800
I've asked the manager

235
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,180
to put our expenses today on your tab.

236
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:37,790
Okay.

237
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:39,540
Let's go.

238
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,480
According to our information,

239
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,670
the Japanese issued an ultimatum,

240
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:50,510
demanding Gu Yizhong

241
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:53,790
deliver the appointment letter for the magistrate of Wu County

242
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:56,390
to Master Gu at his birthday banquet tomorrow.

243
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:58,550
Mr. Xixing

244
00:15:58,870 --> 00:15:59,990
was with the left Kuomintang

245
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:01,850
during the Northern Expedition.

246
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:03,710
He left the army of his own accord

247
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:05,350
because he couldn't stand Chiang Kai-shek's usurping power.

248
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:07,290
He is very influential

249
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:09,030
in Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou,

250
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:10,550
and even Shanghai.

251
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:15,470
So, the Wang Regime and the traitors

252
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:18,330
have always wanted to pull him to their side.

253
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:19,910
Master Gu

254
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,350
won't work for the Japanese.

255
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:24,270
The Party is worried

256
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:26,960
that if the Japanese fail to persuade him,

257
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:29,240
they will kill him.

258
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:30,900
What's our plan?

259
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:32,750
The Provincial Committee ordered

260
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,030
to protect Gu Xixing

261
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:36,720
at all costs

262
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:39,590
and crush the plot of the Japs and traitors.

263
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,190
The best way is to relocate Master Gu

264
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:45,710
to another place as soon as possible.

265
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:49,000
Huizhong has come to persuade him.

266
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:51,430
But Master Gu

267
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:54,250
insists on leaving after his birthday banquet.

268
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:55,830
No amount of persuasion will help.

269
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:56,950
What is Master Gu

270
00:16:58,190 --> 00:16:59,110
waiting for?

271
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:00,430
His son.

272
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:05,220
If Gu Yizhong shows up,

273
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:08,109
we can take this chance and bring him back together.

274
00:17:08,109 --> 00:17:09,710
Our mission this time

275
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,550
is to ensure Master Gu's safety.

276
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:15,619
Before he

277
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:18,079
safely leaves Suzhou,

278
00:17:18,109 --> 00:17:19,710
we can't do anything rashly.

279
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:24,030
I'm worried that if we miss this opportunity,

280
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:25,520
it'll be hard

281
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:27,380
to see Gu Yi Zhong again.

282
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:27,940
Ruotong,

283
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,930
listen to the special agent.

284
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:32,860
I think this is a good chance.

285
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:34,510
If we can't find out

286
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:35,870
who Cell 8 really is,

287
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:37,120
none of us

288
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:38,510
will be safe.

289
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:41,820
I repeat.

290
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:45,870
There's only one mission tomorrow.

291
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:48,880
Protect Master Gu.

292
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:52,680
What is this for?

293
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:54,450
Pear-syrup candy.

294
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:57,070
I notice you've been coughing for the last couple of days.

295
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:58,400
It's good for coughing.

296
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:08,330
There's something

297
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:11,520
I've been trying to tell you.

298
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:15,100
A communist

299
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:18,540
should focus on the big picture.

300
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:20,550
When it comes to missions,

301
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:22,680
we must learn to control our emotions.

302
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:41,230
When I was in the New Fourth Army,

303
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:43,430
I served as a guard for Commissar Xiang.

304
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,350
After I was shot and injured,

305
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:51,010
he encouraged me to work for the underground organization in Suzhou.

306
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:03,190
This is the award

307
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:06,060
I received from Commissar Xiang himself.

308
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:06,380
[First Place]

309
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,150
Is our boy asleep?

310
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:17,830
Yes.

311
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:19,690
He's almost awake.

312
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:23,150
This is a ten-yuan savings certificate.

313
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:25,390
You can buy two cans of infant formula tomorrow.

314
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:26,920
Where did you get the money?

315
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:27,830
You...

316
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:32,270
Don't tell me you misappropriated

317
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:33,910
the Party's money for medicine.

318
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:36,820
Am I the kind of person who would use the organization's resources for personal matters?

319
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:37,830
Don't worry.

320
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:39,590
I borrowed the money from He.

321
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:43,470
Ruotong,

322
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:47,510
you haven't been feeling well recently.

323
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:48,740
You need to rest more.

324
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:51,190
Don't participate in

325
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:53,210
Gu's Garden's operation tomorrow.

326
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,200
No.

327
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:56,850
I request to join the operation tomorrow.

328
00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:58,950
I'm more familiar with Gu's Garden than any of you.

329
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:02,060
Zhou, please trust me.

330
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:11,740
I've been thinking about it.

331
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:14,740
You'd better not go to

332
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:17,030
your dad's birthday banquet tomorrow.

333
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:21,160
Dad kept telling me

334
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:23,110
that he wanted to see our son.

335
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,710
I can't let him be alone

00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:26,910
on his 60th birthday

00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:29,030

It's getting cold.

341
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:00,320
You should rest early.

342
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:02,010
Thank you, Haimo.

343
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:05,770
You're really a good girl.

344
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,690
But you're not the real Haimo, are you?

345
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:17,150
Why did you say that?

346
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,910
When Yuquan and I were hanging out,

347
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:27,170
he once swore to me

348
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:29,910
that he would never let his daughter

349
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:31,630
sing ballads.

350
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:34,270
He said he would send her to school.

351
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:39,710
Nothing can be hidden from you.

352
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:47,020
Yes.

My surname is not Zhang.

354
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:51,750
It's okay.

00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:54,190
Where is the real Haimo?

356
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:56,100
She died

357
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:57,500
when she was 11.

358
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:01,340
My cousin-in-law made up her story,

359
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:03,270
except for the fact

360
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:05,830
that Mr. Yuquan was killed by the Japanese.

00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,200
Were you Yuquan's student, studying at his house?

362

After Haimo passed away,

363
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:19,400
he took me as his student

364
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:22,010
and taught me how to sing ballads.

365

00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:46,280
It's been a long day.

748
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:48,430
I'm fine.

749
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:52,770
What's that sound?

750
00:41:55,830 --> 00:41:57,230
It's the darn Japs!

751
00:41:57,230 --> 00:41:57,890
Don't move!

752
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:12,620
How are you, Mr. Gu?

753
00:42:16,350 --> 00:42:17,570
If you're in the mood,

754
00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:19,560
why don't we follow Bai Juyi's example

755
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:21,430
and enjoy the moon and tea,

756
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:22,930
play the zither, and sing together?

757
00:42:22,930 --> 00:42:24,020
Wouldn't that be delightful?
