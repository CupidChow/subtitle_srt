00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:10,389
The Gu family is

5
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:11,850
indeed very quiet.

6
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,370
Yes, Zhifei.

7
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,640
Unit 2 of Field Duty has been watching them the whole time.

8
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,770
No one went in or out.

9
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,650
Was Gu Yizhong's body carried back to Gu's Garden?

10
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:23,960
It was carried back on that same day.

11
00:02:24,579 --> 00:02:27,140
Then, the next day,

12
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:29,000
a coffin was delivered inside.

13
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:34,140
That old man, Gu Xixing…

14
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:37,930
For the sake of his reputation…

15
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,510
You know what?

16
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:43,930
Today is the seventh day after Gu Yizhong's death.

17
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,290
He doesn't even hold a funeral.

18
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:50,630
Gu Xixing was a soldier.

19
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,770
He saw too many dead people,

20
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:55,520
so he became cold-hearted.

21
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:00,110
Zhifei, you know Gu Xixing always

22
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:01,990
has a walking stick with him.

23
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:04,280
But every time I saw him,

24
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:06,150
I felt...

25
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:08,330
What are you afraid of?

26
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:09,070
I'm not afraid.

27
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:10,200
I just feel his eyes

28
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:12,110

29
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:13,640
my internal organs.

30
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,540
Just like that.

31

33
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:23,090
We definitely have a blood feud.

34
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:26,040
To be honest, I really don't want to

35
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:28,210

36
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:30,190
It was not your fault.

37
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,870
Gu Yizhong wanted to die.

38
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:32,870
What could we do?

39
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:34,510
Besides,

40
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:35,300
Zhifei,

41
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:36,890
now that Gu Yizhong is dead,

42
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:38,230
isn't it safer

43
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:39,070

44
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:41,480
For now.

45
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,390
As soon as I activate Cell 8

46
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:46,460

47
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,270
they'll know immediately

48
00:03:48,579 --> 00:03:50,070
the dead one is fake.

I've been reflecting on myself these days.

52
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:33,860
Maybe Gu Yizhong

53
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,190
had his reasons.

54
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Can you leave me alone for a while?

55
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:51,320
You've been like this for seven days.

56
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:51,950

57
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:53,290
He was forced to die.

58
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:59,230
Everyone was pushing him.

59

60
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,130
all of us are responsible.

61
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:10,390
Gu Yizhong was not Cell 8.

62
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,830
Nor are we.

00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:19,040
Then, only Hu Zhiping and his wife can be it.

65

wanting to report this to the superiors,

66
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,670
but I had no evidence.

67
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:24,520

68

00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:31,370
that the baby was born at the wrong time.

191
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:33,510
Let me hold him for a while.

192
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,710
You've been holding him all the way.

193
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:37,000
No need. He'll wake up if you move him.

194
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:40,670
He takes after you. He's too vigilant.

195
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,550
Welcome.

196
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:49,170
Thank you.

197
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,870
Hello, Comrade Special Agent.

198
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:55,850
Comrade He Shunjiang.

199
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:58,440
Yes, you can just call me He.

200
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,580
Hello, Comrade Zhou Zhenwu.

201
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,760
We meet again.

202
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:08,110
Comrade Special Agent, sit down and talk.

203
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:18,240
Huizhong.

204
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:22,930
Ruotong.

205
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:31,550
The Japanese and the puppet forces' "pacification" operation is rampant.

206
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:33,550
The New Fourth Army and the stubborn and collaborationist forces of the enemy

207
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:36,860
have fought dozens of battles.

208
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:41,600
A large number of injured patients need medicines urgently.

209
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,710
Malaria is currently prevalent around the Taihu Lake area.

210
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:47,670
Many soldiers have high fever and diarrhea,

211
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,810
which have greatly affected their combat power.

212
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:52,150
The Jiangsu Provincial Committee

213
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:54,280
asked me to come back to Suzhou to work.

214
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:56,190
The priority

215
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:58,910
is to buy

216
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:02,150
quinine, the special medicine to cure malaria.

217
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,440
I know about quinine.

218
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:07,990
When I was in Southern Jiangxi Guerrilla,

219
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:09,710
quinine was the most effective life-saving medicine.

220
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:11,750
The medicine is strictly regulated now.

221
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:12,890
Don't mention quinine.

222
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:14,910
Even ordinary medicines are very hard to get.

223
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:16,030
Not only medicine,

224
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:18,580
rice, cotton…

225
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:21,740
these are all controlled by the Japanese.

226
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:25,950
Since the "pacification" operation, the enemy has intensified inspections.

227
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:26,470
Without a movement permit

228
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:27,990
from the No. 7 Office,

229
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,830
it's hard to ship these goods out.

230
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:33,190
The organization will handle the transportation problem.

231
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:36,390
He,

232
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:40,130
I have work to discuss with Zhou.

233
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:43,480
Okay, I'll go prepare dinner.

234
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,150
Zhou.

235
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,980
Everyone was upset

236
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,450
because of the suspicion about Cell 8.

237
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:59,900
We said something aggressive

238
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:00,980
to each other.

239
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:05,829
I apologize if I offended you.

240
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:11,030
Thank you.

241
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:17,230
You trusted Yizhong, right?

242
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:22,750
To be honest,

243
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:25,770
Zhou Zhenwu's suspicion of him

244
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:27,109
was barely solid.

245
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:30,840
I didn't believe it either.

246
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:33,480
But what happened on the island

247
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:35,670
did baffle me.

248
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:42,880
Why was he in the radio room?

249
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:44,760
Why did that young soldier

250
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,490
die in front of him?

251
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:51,190
How can I explain those?

252
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:52,510
But…

253
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:59,190
he had no chance to explain now.

254
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:08,550
That's the point I feel saddest about in my heart.

255
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,240
He's dead,

256
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,040
and he left such a big suspicion.

257
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:25,990
In my heart,

258
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:31,350
Yizhong always looked like when he was 12.

259
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:34,470
Carefree.

260
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:36,830
Energetic.

261
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,550
I want him

262
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:43,540
to live in my heart forever.

263
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:24,150
[Zhaohe Hospital]

264
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:37,350
Excuse me.

265
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:38,010
It's okay.

266
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:39,260
Be careful.

267
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:44,270
Be careful.

268
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:07,910
I made pork rib soup today.

269
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:22,670
Drink more meat soup. You'll recover soon.

270
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:37,750
Yizhong.

271
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:40,630
What are you doing?

272
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:43,430
You haven't opened your mouth for food for days.

273
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:44,390
You should know

274
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:45,840
if Miss Haimo hadn't

275
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:48,070
dug you out from the pile of dead people,

276
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:49,830
you would have been long dead

277
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:51,710
because of excessive blood loss.

278
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:57,770
For the past seven days,

279
00:20:57,770 --> 00:20:59,380
your wound has healed well.

280
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,690
But your body

281
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:03,550
needs nutrition now, understand?

282
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:12,530
Maybe my soup is not good.

283
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:19,290
This pen is yours, right?

284
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:21,430
I got it back for you.

285
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,630
It must be from Miss Xiao.

286
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:30,910
I've tried it. It's still working.

287
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:32,790
But this hole

288
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:34,470
needs to be mended.

289
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:39,820
[To Yizhong]

290
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:55,940
[To Yizhong]

291
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:04,990
What kind of official is a "magistrate"?

292
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:07,030
It's what we call the head of a county.

293
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:08,830
That's how the Japanese call it.

294
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:11,480
Wang Zemin is so generous to give out gold bars

295
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:14,540
to be a county magistrate?

296
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:16,970
I bet one could embezzle much money as a magistrate.

297
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:18,110
Think about it.

298
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:20,850
Wu County rules nearly 500,000 households in Southern Jiangsu.

299
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:22,380
It's a land of fish and rice.

300
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:24,630
There are just too many chances of corruption.

301
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:26,950
But if he wants to be the county magistrate,

302
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:28,170
he should give the gold bars

303
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:29,920
to the provincial chairman.

304
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:32,450
Why did he send them to you?

305
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:36,150
The provincial chairman doesn't have the final say about Wu County's magistrate.

306
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:38,260
Isn't the "pacification" operation going on now?

307
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:40,590
It's up to Mr. Li,

308
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,790
the secretary general of the Pacification Operation Committee.

309
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:43,790
In Suzhou,

310
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:46,250
everyone knows that I represent Mr. Li.

311
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:51,470
So, it's all thanks to Bodhisattva Li. So heavy.

312
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:53,060
-As usual.
-It's so heavy.

313
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:55,590
Give half to Mr. Li.

314
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,160
Why?

315
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:03,430
Mr. Li

316
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,930
doesn't even know about it.

317
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:06,970
Shallow.

318
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:09,310
Why does Mr. Li trust me?

319
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:11,690
Because I never lie to him,

320
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,440
even if he's not around.

321
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:16,600
We can't lie to Mr. Li.

322
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:19,340
Zhifei.

323
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:22,070
Jinhai.

324
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:23,210
Hi, Jinhai.

325
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:25,040
Yuqing.

326
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:28,630
Spring.

327
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:42,580
[If you still don't want to see me, the letter Mr. Xu wrote to you will be sent to the Japanese]

328
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,920
If you still don't want to see me,

329
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,880
the letter Mr. Xu wrote to you

330
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,520
will be sent to the Japanese.

331
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,420
She's getting mad.

332
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:55,850
Have your men found

333
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,360
her whereabouts?

334
00:23:57,850 --> 00:23:58,620
Not yet.

335
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:02,040
Zhifei, if you still don't meet her,

336
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:03,990
I'm afraid she'll really send the letter to the Japanese.

337
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:04,590
I will...

338
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:06,370
I will meet her.

339
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:09,520
Okay, I'll choose the location.

340
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:11,070
I'll bring more people with me by then.

341
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:12,390
Even if she has three heads and six arms,

342
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:14,190
she has to listen to us in Suzhou.

343
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:15,270
You go and arrange it.

344
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:15,980
Got it.

345
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:22,270
Did you burn something again?

346
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:23,160
It stinks.

347
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:25,100
Jinhai has left?

348
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:25,830
Yes.

349
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:30,110
By the way, did Jinhai's wife Xiaolan

350
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:31,590
book a woolen coat

351
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:33,630
at the Damaru Department Store?

352
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,590
You pay for her.

353
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:37,910
Got it.

354
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,710
These little gold bars, should I save them in the bank tomorrow

355
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:44,110
or put them in the safe at home?

356
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:45,510
Just put them in the safe.

357
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:47,670
It's almost full.

358
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:49,530
We need to buy a new one.

359
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,750
Uncle Gu, it's time to have your medicine.

360
00:24:57,750 --> 00:25:01,110
The weather has turned cold. The medicine is even more bitter when it's cold.

361
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:02,770
Drink it while it's still hot.

362
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,630
It's an old illness.

363
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,400
It relapses every time when it's this season.

364
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:12,060
It's useless whether I take the medicine or not.

365
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:15,310
I've prepared some brown sugar cubes this time.

366
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:17,030
Take one after you drink the medicine.

367
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:18,960
It won't feel that bitter this way.

368
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:22,650
Do you think I'm a kid who's afraid of bitter things?

369
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:27,110
Don't worry about the decoction in the future.

370
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:28,770
Mrs. Wang and others can do it.

371
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:30,310
Every time Mrs. Wang gives you the medicine,

372
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:32,030
you always pour it away secretly.

373
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:34,550
That's why Mrs. Wang asked me to come.

374
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:39,070
Okay.

375
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:45,710
Here.

376
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,480
It's not bitter at all.

377
00:25:58,790 --> 00:25:59,430
Haimo,

378
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:01,350
tell me,

379
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:05,050
you've only been in Gu's Garden for a few days,

380
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:07,480
but all the men and women here

381
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:09,900
are close to you. They all like you.

382
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:14,620
Uncle Gu, I like this place, too.

383
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:18,540
Does your cousin-in-law know Yizhong's thing?

384
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:19,830
I didn't tell anyone.

385
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:23,590
Yes, this matter is of great consequence.

386
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:25,720
The fewer people know, the better.

387
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:27,410
Don't worry, Uncle Gu.

388
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:29,590
You took me and my cousin-in-law in.

389
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:31,390
We should do anything for you.

390
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,290
When this matter is over,

391
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:39,220
I'll find you a good family.

392
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:42,920
I'll take you as the daughter of the Gu family

393
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:45,110
and marry you off in a grand manner.

394
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:48,510
Uncle Gu,

395
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:51,680
are you chasing me away?

396
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:52,910
Of course not.

397
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:55,880
No matter who you marry,

398
00:26:56,930 --> 00:26:59,470
Gu's Garden will always be your home.

399
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:04,300
You are still alone.

400
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:10,480
There are only so many places in my heart.

401
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:12,470
Someone hasn't left.

402
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:14,990
No one else can come in.

403
00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:22,910
Please forgive me for leaving without saying goodbye.

404
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:25,790
I'm curious.

405
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:27,990
How is your wife?

406
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,140
What kind of person is she?

407
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:33,240
Why can she make you so devoted?

408
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:37,850
Mr. Li introduced her to me.

409
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,760
She was just an ordinary person.

410
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,420
Do you love her?

411
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,160
We live a life together.

412
00:28:46,970 --> 00:28:49,230
Why haven't you been unwilling to see me?

413
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:53,190
You work for the CBIS and I, the Wang government.

414
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:55,850
You fight against Japan, and we launch the peace movement.

415
00:28:55,850 --> 00:28:57,310
We are on different sides.

416
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:59,590
We have to draw our guns when we meet.

417
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:04,640
Do you want to be a traitor that badly?

418
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:07,190
That's your understanding.

419
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:08,840
Without us

420
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:10,260
bearing a bad reputation as traitors,

421
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:11,430
how can people enjoy the peace

422
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:13,190
in Suzhou today?

423
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:16,680
Mr. Li said it's not easy to start a war,

424
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:18,950
but it's harder to make peace.

425
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:26,210
You sold our country in the guise of making peace.

426
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:28,730
You call that saving the country? Shameless.

427
00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:32,160
Only the future generations can tell who's right or who's wrong.

428
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,110
Not us. We can't make it out.

429
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:37,830
Director Zhou,

430
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:41,510
looks like

431
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:44,240
you're going to kill us all today.

432
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:46,510
Two by the lake.

433
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:48,270
Four over there.

434
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:52,190
And the ones behind.

435
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:54,270
They are all your men, right?

436
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,590
Yes.

437
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:00,550
I haven't made much progress

438
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:02,670
in business these years.

439
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:05,660
Good for you.

440
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:08,310
The gunman you arranged in the pavilion

441
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:09,930
must be a top player.

442
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:12,080
Feng Zhiguo.

443
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:15,970
Guo Jingji was killed not long ago.

444
00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:16,930
He did it, right?

445
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:19,820
You really made a lot of effort.

446
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:21,870
You even transferred the No.1 assassin of the CBIS

447
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:23,430
to Suzhou.

448
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:25,470
It seems that Xu

449
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:27,550
is really hung up

450
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:29,490
on me and Suzhou.

451
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:34,030
Xu values Suzhou very much.

452
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:36,710
If I don't get out of the car

453
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:38,030
in half an hour,

454
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:40,120
your car will be riddled

455
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:42,830
by our No. 1 killer.

456
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:45,990
Then you'll die, too.

457
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:51,310
That's good. We can die in the car together.

458
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:56,750
The letter from Mr. Xu.

459
00:30:57,990 --> 00:31:00,670
Write a letter in reply after reading it.

460
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:02,980
I can take it back to Chongqing.

461
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,580
Xinping, don't make it hard for me.

462
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:07,830
You're pushing me into a fire pit.

463
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:09,000
I don't want it.

464
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:11,560
The Japanese will be doomed sooner or later.

465
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,910
If you have no group to support you,

466
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:14,010
what will your wife and children do?

467
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:15,740
I'm doing this as a favor to you.

468
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:19,390
You don't understand our situation.

469
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:21,230
When No. 90 Agent Station

470
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:22,490
was just established,

471
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:23,620
the Japanese sent

472
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:25,230
a man named Kondo as the advisor.

473
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:26,440
The moment he came to our agent station,

474
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,990
he purged it

475
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:29,850
and killed all the people

476
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:30,750
who were related to the NBIS or CBIS,

477
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:31,670
including those who just played mahjong

478
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:33,420
and had a meal with them.

479
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:34,520
I risked my life

480
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:36,270
to come and meet you today.

481
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:37,710
Don't make it hard for me.

482
00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:39,230
I made

483
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,270
a pledge, too.

484
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,070
I told them before I came

485
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:44,660
that I'd get your letter back to Chongqing.

486
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:47,190
I said if the mission failed, I'd kill myself.

487
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:52,180
I'll accept this letter.

488
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:55,520
Give me some time to reply to it.

489
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:57,830
How can I contact you?

490
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:03,140
There's a No. 9 Tailor Shop in front of the Xuanmiao Taoist Temple.

491
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:04,830
Go in and find Master Hou.

492
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:08,240
Tell him you want to make a suit

493
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:10,070
worn by Chaplin in Modern Times.

494
00:32:10,450 --> 00:32:11,510
He will arrange it.

495
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:22,070
Modern Times.

496
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,980
Is it the movie I took you to watch?

497
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,020
Someone said

498
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:30,230
Chaplin's suit looked cool.

499
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:46,140
You'd better get off now.

500
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:49,750
We don't want Feng Zhiguo

501
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,750
to riddle my car with gunfire.

502
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,090
Didn't you just say

503
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:56,740
you want to die together?

504
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:05,720
I still want to watch a movie if there's a chance someday.

505
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,800
Go now.

506
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:16,500
Protect yourself

507
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:18,780
in Suzhou.

508
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:29,400
I'm leaving.

509
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:39,430
A piece of intelligence for you.

510
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:41,890
Gu Yizhong is not dead. He's still in Suzhou.

511
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,670
Zhifei, didn't we agree

512
00:33:57,670 --> 00:33:59,070
we'd do it when you rolled down the window?

513
00:33:59,070 --> 00:33:59,930
What happened?

514
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:01,650
Gu Yizhong is not dead.

515
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:04,260
That little chick

516
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:06,470
tricked us, the eagles.

517
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:09,270
I'll investigate it now.

518
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:13,949
Dear Zhifei,

519
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:16,080
We've always been close.

520
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:18,230
I've always been tolerant of you.

521
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:21,760
How could you betray me and act so rebelliously?

522
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:25,150
Where is justice? Where is your conscience?

523
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:28,190
Xinping insisted that it was a momentary lapse

524
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:29,850
that you sided with them,

525
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:33,650
and you're unwilling to commit treason and betray the people.

526
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:36,940
So, I ordered Xinping to take the risks and go there again

527
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:39,900
to deliver my message to you.

528
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:43,219
If you can lead all the agents in the Suzhou agent station

529
00:34:43,219 --> 00:34:46,280
to forsake darkness for light,

530
00:34:46,389 --> 00:34:48,989
then I will forgive all your past wrongdoings.

531
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:52,750
And I'll apply an exceptionally generous reward for you.

532
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:55,880
It's time to atone for your crime by doing this good deed.

533
00:34:55,949 --> 00:34:58,230
I hope you won't let me down.

534
00:34:58,590 --> 00:35:01,430
This letter will be delivered by Spring for me.

535
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,420
Sincerely Yours, Enzeng.

536
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:54,830
[Feng Garden]

537
00:36:17,350 --> 00:36:18,280
Comrade Zhenwu.

538
00:36:18,930 --> 00:36:21,870
The special agent has been waiting for you for a long time.

539
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:23,200
Comrade Special Agent,

540
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,760
why did you bring Junsheng here?

541
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:28,950
Huizhong has a long telegram to send today.

542
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:30,030
She's busy.

543
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,090
I went to find the medicine.

544
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:36,200
The medicine in the black market

545
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,890
is under strict inspection by No. 90.

546
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:39,150
Even if someone has it,

547
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:40,480
no one dares to sell it.

548
00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:43,090
I've asked the hospitals, too.

549
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:44,390
Quinine is a scarce good.

550
00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:46,430
One hospital only has one or two bottles at most.

551
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:48,760
And they need to record who they sell it to.

552
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:53,910
The base is rushing me one telegram a day.

553
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,550
How about I have a try?

554
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:05,050
Let me soothe the baby.

555
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:07,420
Here.

556
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:09,000
Little Junsheng.

557
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,460
Let me hold you.

558
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,330
Comrade Special Agent,

559
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:18,080
I want to discuss something

560
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,230
with you.

561
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:21,990
It's about Xiao Ruotong.

562
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:25,030
It's inappropriate for her to stay in Suzhou

563
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:26,560
to do underground work now.

564
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,030
I disagree.

565
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:35,360
Comrade Special Agent,

566
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:36,480
I think...

567
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:37,550
I think my current state

568
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:38,670
is perfectly fine.

569
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:41,090
But only Zhou Zhenwu, He, and I knew about

570
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:43,990
the day Yizhong asked me to meet.

571
00:37:44,790 --> 00:37:46,590
How did people from No. 90 know?

572
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:50,070
You're suspecting me again.

573
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:52,640
Why did you go to Pingjiang Road this morning?

574
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:55,320
You've become capable now.

575
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:56,610
You followed me?

576
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:58,500
He went to the story-telling theatre in Pingjiang Road.

577
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,270
The people of No. 90 often go there.

578
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:00,870
Stop it!

579
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:02,510
We just said

580
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,830
we should trust one another.

581
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:07,930
And you suspect each other immediately.

582
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:09,780
Let's put Gu Yizhong's death

583
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:10,810
and Cell 8

584
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:11,990
aside.

585
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:14,870
Now, our task is

586
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:17,470
getting quinine.

587
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:19,510
Sister.

588
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:29,240
I know everything.

589
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,400
Why? Why?

590
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,130
Why did you kill me?

591
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:36,270
What's wrong?

592
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:41,990
I dreamed about Yizhong.

593
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:44,030
He said...

594
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:47,550
What did he say?

595
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:52,350
Nothing.

596
00:38:58,070 --> 00:38:58,790
Huizhong.

597
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:03,170
You just miss him too much.

598
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:05,810
That's why you dreamed of him.

599
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:09,990
Everything will pass.

600
00:39:21,450 --> 00:39:23,070
I saw her

601
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:27,650
on the day of the funeral procession.

602
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:33,580
I don't understand

603
00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:37,150
what you and Miss Xiao are doing.

604
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:40,800
But I think

605
00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:44,670
if two people have feelings for each other,

606
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:48,110
they shouldn't give up easily.

607
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,540
Back then, my parents

608
00:39:58,030 --> 00:40:00,560
passed away one after the other in Guangzhou.

609
00:40:00,990 --> 00:40:02,380
Just like you,

610
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:06,760
I thought there was no point in living on.

611
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:11,000
I wanted to follow them.

612
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:12,980
Then, one day,

613
00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:14,310
I had a dream.

614
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:15,800
In the dream,

615
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:17,610
they said nothing

616
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:19,070
but kept crying.

617
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:21,290
Later, I realized

618
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:25,270
that they didn't do it for themselves,

619
00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:28,830
but for me.

620
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:34,830
They didn't want me to do that.

621
00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:41,310
They didn't want me to…

622
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:50,550
Actually,

623
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:54,950
life is never perfect.

624
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:00,950
But when you suffer,

625
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:07,250
think about the people you love

626
00:41:09,350 --> 00:41:10,710
or those who love you.

627
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,150
Even if it's for them,

628
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:19,270
you should hang in there for some more time.

629
00:41:19,870 --> 00:41:22,070
Even if you don't do it for yourself,

630
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:26,430
think about Miss Xiao.

631
00:41:28,810 --> 00:41:30,490
Even if it's for her,

632
00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:33,740
can't you hang in there?
