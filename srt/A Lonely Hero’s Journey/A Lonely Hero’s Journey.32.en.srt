Miss Lu, have some tea and eat something.

00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:02,960
Go away.

Where is this?

8
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:23,230
You can't tell me?

9
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:30,060
Did Ms. Lyuzhu use to live here?

10
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:31,550
How did you know?

11
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:33,910
A typical lady's bedroom

00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:36,020

13
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:42,360
Why is Ms. Lyuzhu not here anymore?

14
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:44,160
I don't know.

15
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:46,350
I'm just in charge of taking care of you.

16
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:48,230
If you want to eat or drink anything,

17

Did I burn you?

19
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:04,110
As servants, we have tough skin.

20
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:06,130
We're not afraid of getting burned.

21
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:09,240
How should I address you?

22
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:10,670
My surname is Liu.

00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:12,440
You can call me Aunt Liu.

We found Miss Lu.

27
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,670
She's fine.

28
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,910
She's in Suzhou.

29
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:23,680
She's absolutely safe.

I just want my governess to get back to Changshu

as soon as possible.

33
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:36,110
My children keep pestering me

and throwing tantrums.

35
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:39,910
They want to see Ms. Lu.

No problem.

to clear some misunderstandings.

40
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:55,790
I dare not go to Suzhou.

41
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,230
I bet

42
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:59,270

You can choose Shanghai or Nanjing.

47
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:11,790

Luo Wuqiang, listen.

Ms. Lyuzhu

61
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:49,950

She sings Kun opera very well.

63

Ask her to sing for you when you're free.

64
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,070
I advise you

65
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:03,270
to not trust the Communist Party.

report back yet?

82

No.

00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:42,740
or Commander Luo.

175
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:44,070

we'll have a chance to control Luo Wuqiang.

191
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:37,710
Luo Wuqiang will sell out his country?

192
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:45,070
Where is Lu Junnuo now?

193
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:48,230
Lu Junnuo was detained by Mr. Li secretly.

194
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:50,900
Now, Zhou Zhifei is guarding her.

195
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:55,150
Zhou Zhifei kept it from me again.

196
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:56,870
Mr. Li

197
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:58,480
wants to build an army alone

198
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,110
to fight against the Japanese Empire,

199
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:01,880
sabotage the "pacification" operation,

200
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,130
and build a third government

201
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:05,330
in addition to the Nanjing Government.

202
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:08,470
It is said that there is even a radio in his house

203
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:10,080
and he contacts Chongqing.

204
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:14,050
Lieutenant Colonel Haruki warned him before.

205
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,910
The Chinese are never reliable.

206
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:19,110
It's traitors who are not reliable.

207
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:21,310
Also,

208
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:24,390
after Ding Jiansheng's case,

209
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:26,990
I've been investigating the military rice case.

210
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:29,150
Zhou Zhifei used the Shengyoulong Trading Co.

211
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:31,050
run by his brother-in-law Ji Yuping

212
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:32,590
and resold military provisions seven times

213
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:34,180
since the start of the "pacification" operation.

214
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:35,750
He's sold more than 150 million kilograms of military rice

215
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,280
and made over 20 million in profit.

216
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,150
This caused

217
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:39,870
the rice price of Jiangsu and Shanghai to skyrocket,

218
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:40,590
which has greatly damaged

219
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:42,790
the reputation of the Japanese Empire.

220
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:52,230
Zhou Zhifei is evil.

221
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:54,590
That's right.

222
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,640
Because he has Mr. Li behind him.

223
00:12:58,230 --> 00:12:59,550
I need to call Li

224
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:02,470
and ask him to give us Lu.

225
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:03,270
No.

226
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:05,030
Sir,

227
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,100
Mr. Li will deny

228
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:09,070
that Lu Junnuo is in their hands.

229
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:10,490
If we push him too hard,

230
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:12,130
he might kill her instead.

231
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:16,800
Have you forgotten the case of Jiang Boxian in 1941?

232
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,230
In the end, Jiang Boxian went missing.

233
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,200
Even his body went missing.

234
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,550
It's all their doing.

235
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:26,350
Gu, what do you think?

236
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:28,310
I don't think we should hesitate.

237
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,440
As long as we get Lu Junnuo

238
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:31,910
from Mr. Li immediately,

239
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:34,160
we'll have the initiative.

240
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,880
Do you know

241
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:38,430
where Lu Junnuo is?

242
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:39,180
I have a spy.

243
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:42,190
Sir, please send

244
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:43,740
Sergeant Iwai to assist me.

245
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:45,710
I will try to bring her back

246
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:47,470

248
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:52,030
You'd better not lie to me

249
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:53,870
like Zhou Zhifei and Huang Xinzhai did.

250
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:55,530
Otherwise, I will send troops

251
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:57,150

252
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:58,440

253
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:01,110
I will burn Gu's Garden down!

264
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:16,490
Where is Lu Junnuo?

265
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:32,060
Why should I tell you?

266
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:36,180
Mr. Kondo orders you to give Lu Junnuo

267

268
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,330

Our nation is in danger.

and believe that you will make the right choice.

403

Faced with our country's survival,

I was thinking

the cost for rice will rise some more

525
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:35,690

00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:35,889
Did that Ji Yuping

569
00:34:35,889 --> 00:34:37,090
confess everything?

570
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:40,949
Thank you.

571
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,370
Go back now.

572
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:44,050
I'll check it out.

573
00:34:50,610 --> 00:34:51,389
Come in.

574
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:52,670
Iwai is coming in.

575
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:03,170
Zhou Zhifei's brother-in-law is a coward.

576
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:06,670
He confessed without a fight.

577
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:10,830
He admitted that he sold military provisions,

578
00:35:10,850 --> 00:35:13,250
not only rice but also cotton and medicine,

579
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:18,350
but he denied the matter with the pass.

580
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:20,870
Secretly

581
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:23,490
arrest Zhou Zhifei.

582
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:27,310
Yes.

583
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,490
Take the valuable things.

584
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:21,310
Okay.

585
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,420
Mr. Kondo,

586
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:45,970
I'm innocent!

587
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:47,370
Please let me go.

588
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:48,750
I have a lot of things—

589
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:49,550
Go over there.

590
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:51,740
Sit down.

591
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:06,790
I heard you have something to tell me personally.

592
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:09,160
Sir,

593
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:11,110
we've been tricked.

594
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:13,050
We fell into Gu Yizhong's trap.

595
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:14,710
It's all a misunderstanding.

596
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:17,550
You established a company with your brother-in-law

597
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:19,410
and resold military provisions.

598
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:22,340
You sold our military's rice

599
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,020
to the New Fourth Army.

600
00:39:24,350 --> 00:39:27,180
This was also Gu Yizhong's trap?

601
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:27,860
Iwai.

602
00:39:28,790 --> 00:39:30,200
In the Wang government,

603
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:31,450
do you think I'm the only one

604
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:32,780
reselling provisions?

605
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,780
There are so many.

606
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:37,360
Ji Yuping has confessed everything

607
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:39,290
about how he got the rice

608
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:40,740
and where he sold it to.

609
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,070
It's clear.

610
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:43,310
Yes.

611
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:44,590
I plead guilty.

612
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:47,150
I did sell military rice.

613
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:49,390
Sir,

614
00:39:50,210 --> 00:39:51,880
please give me a chance.

615
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:54,430
I want to make up for my mistake.

616
00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:55,090
Can I?

617
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:02,970
I have an important

618
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:04,540
military information

619
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:05,850
to report to you.

620
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:08,660
There's a senior agent

621
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:10,780
from the communists

622
00:40:10,810 --> 00:40:13,350
who infiltrated the Suzhou Agent Station.

623
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:15,900
His code name is Lonely Boat.

624
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:19,550
Lonely Boat?

625
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:20,230
Yes.

626
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:21,790
Who is it?

627
00:40:22,310 --> 00:40:25,010
I only have a suspicion now,

628
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:28,140
but I'm confident

629
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:30,670
I can hand this person to you

630
00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:31,920
to punish,

631
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:33,910
but I have one condition.

632
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:38,140
If I can find Lonely Boat,

633
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:40,990
I hope you can give me a chance.

634
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:42,480
Of course.

635
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,320
I can quit my job from No. 90.

636
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,630
I just want to take my wife and child

637
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:48,180
to farm in the countryside.

638
00:40:48,350 --> 00:40:50,070
Just give me a way out, okay?

639
00:40:54,790 --> 00:40:55,630
Yes.

640
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,030
Thank you.

641
00:40:57,170 --> 00:40:59,230
I knew you'd say yes.

642
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:00,090
Thank you.

643
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:03,510
You two

644
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:06,130
are very familiar with this person.

645
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:10,530
Gu Yizhong.

646
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:13,750
Don't doubt me.

647
00:41:13,790 --> 00:41:16,070
Do you remember Wang Mingzhong?

648
00:41:16,770 --> 00:41:18,190
A few days ago,

649
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:20,010
Commander Luo Wuqiang

650
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:21,580
came to our No. 90 to get him.

651
00:41:22,010 --> 00:41:24,860
Wang Mingzhong, the Communist liaison,

652
00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:26,230
later died in No. 90.

653
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,510
He was Lonely Boat's superior.

654
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:31,910
After he died,

655
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:34,780
I found a book of poems on him.

656
00:41:34,990 --> 00:41:36,030
This book

657
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:38,010
was the token used

658
00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:40,180
when he met with Lonely Boat in person.

659
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:41,320
I have an idea.

660
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:44,210
Let's get someone to call Gu Yizhong.

661
00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:46,050
Tell him the communists

662
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:48,480
sent someone

663
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:50,490
with a book of poems.

664
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:52,430
I guess Gu Yizhong

665
00:41:52,450 --> 00:41:53,840
must have this book.

666
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,810
Have him come for a liaison.

667
00:41:56,070 --> 00:41:58,250
Then, the truth will be revealed

668
00:41:58,590 --> 00:42:00,520
that Gu Yizhong is Lonely Boat

669
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:02,340
and we'll catch them all.

670
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:03,430
Iwai,

671
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:05,250
this book of poems

672
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:07,010
is in the second drawer

673
00:42:07,270 --> 00:42:08,510
of my office.

674
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:09,490
Go get it.

675
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:11,650
You'll know after trying.

676
00:42:16,690 --> 00:42:18,450
Okay, this is it.

677
00:42:20,350 --> 00:42:21,190
Slowly.

678
00:42:28,430 --> 00:42:29,390
You're so smart.

679
00:42:31,010 --> 00:42:31,600
Hello?

680
00:42:32,310 --> 00:42:34,550
Hello, is this Mr. Gu Yizhong?
