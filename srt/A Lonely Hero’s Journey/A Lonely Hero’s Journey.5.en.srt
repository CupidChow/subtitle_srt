[Episode 5]

4
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:05,550
Dad.

5
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,389
Why haven't you eaten anything?

6
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,850
What a waste of Mr. Liu's culinary talent.

7
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:14,750
Dad,

8
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:16,440
please believe me.

9
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:17,430
I haven't done anything

10
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:18,760
to betray the Gu family.

11
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:28,990
Actually, what the Japanese did

12
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:31,110
was aimed at me.

13
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:34,710
They won't give up

14
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:36,790
until they drag me down.

15
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:39,910
I've been thinking about it,

16
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:41,960
and there's only one solution:

17
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:43,030
you must...

18
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:44,630
leave.

19
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:45,760
Leave Suzhou.

20
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:48,910
I have a former subordinate named Chen Hanyu

21
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:50,460
who's in exile in Hong Kong.

22
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,550
Go and find him with my letter.

23
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:54,240
He will look after you.

24
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,440
Dad, I'm not leaving.

25
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:56,750
I'm not a traitor.

26
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:59,060
I need to stay to prove my innocence.

27
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,660
Do you have any evidence?

28
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:02,270
Dad.

29
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:03,910
There's someone at No. 90

30
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:05,500
who can prove my innocence.

31
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:06,690
Him.

32
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:11,770
Among the agents at No. 90,

33
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:13,470
who can you outsmart?

34
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,030
I...

35
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,090
Your cousin is still imprisoned in there.

36
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:22,150

[To Yizhong]

38
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,579
This was given to me by Ruotong.

39
00:03:25,579 --> 00:03:26,640
Why is it with you?

40
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:29,050
The Japanese sent it to me.

41
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:31,840
Yizhong,

42
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:33,630
I'm old.

43
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:36,030
I swore a solemn oath

44
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,910
not to leave Suzhou,

45
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:39,730
not to leave your mom,

46
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,280
and not to leave this Gu's Garden,

47
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:44,770
which was established by our ancestors.

48
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,630
But you're different.

49
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:48,230
If you stay here,

50
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:50,130
you will only become a tool

51
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:51,950
for the Japanese to threaten me.

52
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,270
So,

53
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:55,000
you must leave.

54
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:57,750
As for being falsely accused of

55
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,750
being a traitor and a collaborator,

56
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:01,610
as time goes by,

57
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,080
the truth will come out.

58
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:03,750
Dad,

59
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:05,380
if I leave,

60
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:06,430
the Japanese will be even less likely

61
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:07,750
to let you go.

62
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:11,030
Sit.

63
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:15,470
Yizhong,

64
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,649
in 1928,

65
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:21,790
the Japanese brazenly fired on our Northern Expedition Army.

66
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:24,590
I ordered a counterattack to hit the Japanese invaders hard.

67
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:26,060
But Generalissimo Chiang

68
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:28,590
feared it might escalate the situation,

69
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:30,790
so he ordered me to withdraw the troops,

70
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:34,230
which led to the death of negotiator Cai Gongshi

71
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:38,110
and the massacre of over ten thousand soldiers and civilians in Jinan.

72
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:39,300
After that,

73
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:42,159
I resigned from the Revolutionary Army in anger.

74
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:44,590
But the desire for vengeance

75
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:47,500
has never left me for a single day.

76
00:04:49,659 --> 00:04:51,790
You should avoid the immediate threat

77
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,300
and flee to a distant land.

78
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:54,990
You must be alive.

79
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,990
I'm not afraid.

80
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:58,980
At 60 years old,

81
00:04:59,159 --> 00:05:00,760
I am not even afraid of death,

82
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:02,320
let alone the Japanese.

83
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:04,320

84

89

Please don't make things difficult for the Division Commander anymore.

94
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:22,870

Is it a boy or a girl?

102
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:37,800
I only heard the baby's cry,

103
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:39,730
but it sounded strong.

104

113
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:11,310
what about Haimo?

114
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:12,190
Fu Gui,

115
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:14,290
what's the situation with these two?

116
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:15,550
Young Master, it's an old story.

117
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:16,870
Didn't I tell you that day?

118
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:18,380
I'm your cousin-in-law.

119

Haimo and you

120
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,390
were engaged by your father when you were kids.

121
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:24,250
Why have I never heard about this?

122
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:25,590
Can we talk about it another day?

123
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:26,830
We are really in a hurry now.

Where have you been?

383
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:41,110
I went to the story-telling theatre to listen to stories.

384
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:42,940
You still have the mood for that?

385
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:44,670
That student girl named Xiao is here,

386
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:46,670
having a secret talk with the Master in the study.

387
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:48,080
You are his future wife.

388
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:49,990
Don't act like a concubine.

389
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:51,630
In my opinion,

390
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:52,810
we should just go in

391
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:54,340
and speak to him frankly,

392
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:55,220
face-to-face.

393
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,990
Master Gu has already made it clear about the engagement.

394
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:59,270
Don’t make trouble anymore.

Whatever.

396
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:02,150
If you don't start caring about it,

397
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:04,670
we won't be able to stay at Gu's Garden any longer.

398
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:05,560
We won't

399
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:07,390
be able to stay in Suzhou either.

400

I don't even know

401

402

I want to see Yizhong.

403
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:24,140
I want to know where he is.

404
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:27,400
I just want to ask him face-to-face

405
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:29,440
why things

406
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:31,670
have turned out this way.

407
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:33,990
Uncle Gu,

408
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:36,500
I believe in Yizhong.

409
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:38,370
I really want to help him.

410
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:39,940
But hiding like this

411
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,230
isn't a solution.

412
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:44,390
I think if I can find him

413
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:45,430
and bring him back,

414
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:46,390
he can clear

415
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:48,230
everything up.

416

I want to help him.

417
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,460
But I don't know where he is right now either.

418
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:57,610
Yesterday,

419
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,480
I told him to hide in Hong Kong for a while.

420
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:04,270
But on the way to the train station,

421
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:05,710
he ran away.

422
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:07,540
I have no idea where he went.

423
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:09,520
If you don’t believe me,

424
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:10,920
I can have Fu Gui come

425
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:13,090

426
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:14,650

427
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:17,570
No need, Uncle Gu. Please don't say that.

428
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,800
Well, where could he have gone?

429

432
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:32,350
is still detained at No. 90

433
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:34,310
because of him.

434
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:38,110
His companions at the Architecture Research Society

435
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:40,710
also said they haven't seen him for almost half a month.

437
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:44,480

442

vouch for my son with my life.

443
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:00,320

He refused to tell me where he lives.

But he looked like he was hiding,

465
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:03,310
very afraid of running into acquaintances.

466
