When your stepfather got drunk, he would beat others.

He beat them so hard.

But I understand human beings.

74

When he beat me,

75
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:33,670
if I screamed,

76
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:36,240
he would get happier as he beat me more.

77
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,500
But if I stayed silent,

78
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,650

00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:21,230
Sometimes, I would think

121
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:24,390
that if one is still alive,

122
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:27,160
there will still be hope.

123
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:31,270

125
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:34,990
Right.

126
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:39,510
I can't think about too much now.

127
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:41,720
After this meal,

128
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,180

385
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:06,660
There's a fight outside the Chang Gate.

386
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:08,810
It should be the ones from the Military Police Headquarters

387
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:10,470
and Luo Wuqiang's entourage.

388
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:11,790
Where is Luo Wuqiang?

389
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:13,210
I think he has escaped.

390
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:15,160
Escaped?

391

Mr. Li.

392
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,510
Yes, Sir. I understand.

393
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:34,040
You want to see Luo Wuqiang whether he's alive or dead.

394
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:35,300
Got it.

395
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:48,310
Please calm down.

396
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:52,540
We've already set up checkpoints at all the exits of the city.

397
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:57,830
Luo Wuqiang will never be able to escape from Suzhou.

398
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:14,550
Ms. Lyuzhu.

399
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:16,490
Vice Director Gu wants to see you.

400
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,160
What do you want to see me for?

401
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:20,260
Aunt, get out.

402
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,000
Close the door.

403
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:34,490
I don't like her.

404
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:37,380
She looks at others with vicious eyes.

405

Ms. Lyuzhu.

406
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:43,010
I would like to ask for a favor indeed.

407
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:58,020
Is that how you ask for help?

408
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,310
Is it comfortable?

409
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:48,440
Is it that if I do you this favor,

410
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:52,090
you'll listen to me on everything in the future?

411
00:29:56,610 --> 00:29:57,710
Sleep with me.

412
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:08,390
Don't worry.

413
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:10,360
You have such a handsome face.

414
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,600
I won't let you

415
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,790
be killed by Mr. Li's random shooting.

416
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:23,490
Tell me. What is it?

417
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:30,230
Ms. Lyuzhu.

418
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:32,110
I want to borrow your car

419
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:34,510
and send a person out of the city.

420
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:48,730

421
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:49,460

422
00:30:56,670 --> 00:30:58,430
Honey. Mr. Li.

423
00:30:58,430 --> 00:30:59,150
Isn't she…

424
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:03,670
Mr. Li, why are you hiding here?

425
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:05,150
I've been looking for you.

426
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,680
Gao Hu, remember to leave from the Qi Gate.

427
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,160
It's more secluded there.

428
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,790
If someone stops and blocks you,

429
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:19,450
tell them Mr. Li has something urgent

430
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:21,510
and has to get out of the city tonight.

431
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,640
Don't wipe it off. It can save your life.

432
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:26,150
Take care.

433
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:27,270
Go.

00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:54,580
Nor the Xu Gate either.

438

Ms. Lu.

439
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:57,830
These are the only four gates that one can pass through in Suzhou.

440
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:59,630
And there's a curfew after 8 p.m.

441
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:01,670
I'm afraid we can't get out of the city today.

442
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:02,230
No.

443
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:04,990
Company Commander Meng,

444
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:06,730
we can try taking the waterway.

445
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:08,190
Go to the water city gate, Pan Gate.

446
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:10,100
Boats can pass through it at night.

447
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:10,990
Let's try then.

448
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:12,860
Go to the Pan Gate.

449
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:17,900
Miss Lu, come with us.

450
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:25,010

Even if you don't know Mr. Li,

454
00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:51,540
don't you know this car either?

455
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:04,250
Let them pass.

456
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:10,710

458
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:15,280
Close the city gate.

00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:46,850

460
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:47,510

What about Ruotong?

525
00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:53,790
She's missing.

526
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:57,910
I searched for her all night.

527
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:08,510
Maybe she escaped out of the city.

528
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,050
Miss Xiao is such a nice person.

529
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,470
Heaven helps the worthy.

530
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:15,730
It's not easy

531
00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:18,650
to escape from Suzhou.

532
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:24,850
Where is she?

533
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:26,510
He went back to Changshu.

534
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:28,030
I'm asking about Lyuzhu.

535
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:30,640
I called Changshu Substation yesterday.

536
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,230
They said

537
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,660
they saw Ms. Lyuzhu's car

538
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:36,320
drive into Luo Wuqiang's barracks in Changshu.

539
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:39,950
I think she was held hostage by Luo Wuqiang.

540
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:41,560
Mr. Li, don't worry.

541
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:43,220
I'll go to Changshu.

542
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:45,230
I'll get her back for you.

543
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:45,830
Stop.

544
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:48,150
Sit down.

545
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,440
Forget it.

546
00:37:59,770 --> 00:38:03,060
I'm just afraid that Luo Wuqiang has shaken the military morale

547
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:04,860
and joined the Communist Party.

548
00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:07,210
Damn Japanese!

549
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:09,340

Hello.

00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:17,700
Mr. Luo.

552
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:21,150
I've known it all.

553
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:25,310
So I rushed back to Suzhou immediately.

554
00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:26,950
I just got into my house.

555
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:31,430
Since I'm back, I will definitely

556
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,310
settle this matter for you.

557
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:34,500
I've said it.

558
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:38,150
I will ensure your absolute safety in Suzhou.

559
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:40,550
Miss Lu?

560
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:42,950
Didn't she go with you?

561
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:45,990
Okay.

562
00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:48,290
As long as she's in Suzhou,

563
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:50,820
I will be able to find her.

564
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:53,700
I will ensure her absolute safety

565
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:55,660
in Suzhou.

566
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:56,590
Okay.

567
00:39:02,450 --> 00:39:03,510
Mr. Li.

568
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:04,550
Sorry.

569
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:07,070
We lost sight of Miss Lu.

570
00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:10,830
She's under my control.

571
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,310
Your No. 90 is useless.

572
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:15,630
I've specifically

573
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:16,750
deployed two special operations groups

574
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:18,950
from No. 76 to keep an eye on her.

575
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:20,310
Where is she now?

576
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:23,830
She's in Lyuzhu's house.

577
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:30,730
I'm ashamed.

578
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:36,630
We can't lose sight of Luo Wuqiang.

579
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:41,990
I was so afraid that he would join the New Fourth Army.

580
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:44,110
But the Japanese just…

581
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,150
I also didn't expect

582
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:49,710
that the Japanese could do something like that.

583
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:50,550
Fortunately,

584
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,250
he cares about Lu Junnuo.

585
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:57,750
That means we still have a chance.

586
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:00,180
Go keep an eye on her personally.

587
00:40:00,850 --> 00:40:02,050
Don't lose her again.

588
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:03,590
Don't worry.

589
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,320
I'll keep an eye on her 24 hours a day.

590
00:40:11,290 --> 00:40:12,040
Remember.

591
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,350
Don't let her

592
00:40:15,350 --> 00:40:16,920
step out of that house.

593
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:24,710
[Harmony Brings Prosperity]

594
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,140
[Harmony Brings Prosperity]

595
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:50,930
I'm just going to give Commander Luo a call.

596
00:40:50,930 --> 00:40:52,070
Sorry, Miss Lu.

597
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:53,010
I can do anything

598
00:40:53,010 --> 00:40:54,270
besides making a call.

599
00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:57,220
Aren't you just putting me

600
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,410
under house arrest?

601
00:40:58,590 --> 00:40:59,650
Where are you from?

602
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:00,930
Are you an agent?

603
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:04,240
Miss Lu, don't make it hard for them.

604
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:05,910
It's Mr. Li's idea

605
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:07,240
to make you stay here.

606
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:11,080
Director Zhou.

607
00:41:12,350 --> 00:41:13,710
Who is Mr. Li?

608
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:15,570
You don't know him?

609
00:41:16,770 --> 00:41:17,530
Anyway,

610
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,820
if Mr. Li doesn't give the order,

611
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:22,480
you can only stay here.

612
00:41:28,010 --> 00:41:29,260
Miss Lu.

613
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:32,390
I advise you to be obedient.

614
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:36,390
We're all rough fellows who do dirty work.

615
00:42:07,350 --> 00:42:08,650
Why are you still up?

616
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:10,670
You still couldn't find her?

617
00:42:12,790 --> 00:42:13,390
Thank you.

618
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:17,170
You can sleep on the bed today.

619
00:42:17,170 --> 00:42:17,990
Get some good sleep

620
00:42:17,990 --> 00:42:19,520
and think of a way tomorrow.

621
00:42:19,610 --> 00:42:20,480
I'm fine.

622
00:42:21,090 --> 00:42:23,350
I'm not sleepy. You can go to sleep first.

623
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:26,700
Haimo.

624
00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:28,510
Have a good sleep.

625
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:29,840
Think of a way tomorrow.

626
00:42:30,610 --> 00:42:31,310
Haimo.

627
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:33,320
Don't think about anything.

628
00:42:33,610 --> 00:42:34,530
Go to sleep first.
