[Episode 30]

4
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:42,350
Mr. Xixing is a man of integrity and righteousness.

5
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:44,140
When he led his army in the Northern Expedition,

6
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:46,380
from Shaoguan all the way to Jinan,

7
00:01:46,509 --> 00:01:47,910
he achieved remarkable military feats

8
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:49,970
and became a role model we all admire.

9
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:51,920
What a pity.

10
00:01:59,270 --> 00:01:59,930
Commander,

11
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:01,430
look at you.

12
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:03,590
Didn't we agree to come here for a meal?

13
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:06,200
Why are you constantly talking about politics and military matters?

14
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,080
Yes.

15
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:07,950
No more talk about this topic.

16
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,229
-Yes, yes, let's eat.
-Let's not talk about it.

17
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:10,630
No more talk about pre-war matters.

18
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,360
Let me explain.

19
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:13,310
Today,

20
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,230
it can be said that Zhou and I

21
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:18,060
have thoughtfully prepared a family banquet.

22
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,150
But we really don't know

23
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:20,860
if it suits everyone's taste.

24
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:24,430
This is authentic Suzhou cuisine.

25
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:26,310
Here, have a try.

26
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:27,090
Here, Commander.

27
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:27,930
Miss Lu.

28
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:29,190
Mrs. Zhou.

29
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:31,160
She doesn't eat coriander.

30
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:32,420
It's okay.

31
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:33,550
It's okay.

32
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:34,680
You can eat something else.

33
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,930
I'll do it myself.

34
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:38,310
Come on, eat up.

35
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:39,680
Is there any chili?

36
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:40,510
Yes.

37
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,140
Our Zhou,

38
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:45,730
knowing that you like chili,

39
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:48,020
specially sent the driver

40
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:50,040
to Shanghai last night to get some.

41
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:51,620
Director Zhou, that's very considerate of you.

42
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:53,230
I was just worried you might not be used to the food here.

43
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:54,160
Actually,

44
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,870
I didn't use to eat spicy food much before.

45
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:56,990
But in 1927,

46
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,550
when I was with General Feng overseeing Henan,

47
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:01,220
our troop was stationed in Minquan County.

48
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:02,360
That place was damp,

49
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:03,990
so I got into the habit of eating chili.

50
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:04,910
Now, without it,

51
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:07,060
nothing tastes good to me.

52
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:09,590
I heard that when Mr. Feng was governing Henan,

53
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,690
he established five counties named Liberty, Equality,

54
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:13,710
Fraternity, Democracy, and People's Rights.

55
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:15,710
It was quite celebrated at the time.

56
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:17,770
But now,

57
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:21,090
the country is in ruins, and old friends are scattered.

58
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:22,910
Let's not talk about pre-war events.

59
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:23,630
Let's not talk about pre-war events.

60
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:24,150
Okay, okay.

61
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:24,880
Let me try it.

62
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:28,950
It tastes good, but it's not spicy enough.

63
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:29,680
Not spicy enough.

64
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,360
I got it.

65
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:31,270
It's good enough.

66
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:32,470
Next time, I'll know.

67
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:33,870
By the way, Miss Lu,

68
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,950
which university did you attend back then?

69
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:38,510
A very famous one, Soochow University.

70
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:39,360
Impressive.

71
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,250
Soochow University in Suzhou

72
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:42,960
has quite a reputation.

73
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:46,010
After 1937,

74
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:47,300
Soochow University moved from Suzhou

75
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,310
to the French Concession in Shanghai.

76
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:51,520
I happened to start my studies in 1938,

77
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,120
so I missed out

78
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,350
on the wonderful campus life in Suzhou.

79
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:57,920
Soochow University?

80
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:00,890
It reminds me, Vice Director Gu,

81
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:02,890
one of your old acquaintances...

82
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:04,980
An old friend of yours

83
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,940
also attended Soochow University, right?

84
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,120
Zhou,

85
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:13,290
don't you have anything else to talk about?

86
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:15,750
Aren't you afraid of making Mrs. Gu jealous?

87
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,410
Yuqing, it's okay.

88
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,510
It's all in the past.

89
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:22,290
See? She doesn't mind.

90
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:25,440
I remember that old friend of Vice Director Gu

91
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:26,470
was named Xiao...

92
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:27,270
Xiao Ruotong.

93
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:31,410
Yes, it was Soochow University, right?

94
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:33,920
Was there such a student

95
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:36,460
at Soochow University in Shanghai?

96
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:38,930
Xiao Ruotong, right?

97
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:42,159
We must be from different years. I don't know her.

98
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:46,659
Director Zhou.

99
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:49,140
Why are you so interested

100
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:50,500
in this Miss Xiao?

101
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:51,670
Here's the thing.

102
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:54,830
She caused my brother here a lot of trouble.

103
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:55,960
Recently,

104
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:57,710
we confirmed through various pieces of evidence

105
00:04:57,710 --> 00:04:59,490
that Xiao Ruotong

106
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:01,020
is a female communist.

107
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:02,980
As a result,

108
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,680
after he included her

109
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:07,110
in his records,

110
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:09,990
Yizhong almost got into trouble with the Japanese.

111
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:11,750
So I have a very strong impression

112
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,040
of this Xiao Ruotong.

113
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,720
Yizhong, is that true?

114
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:17,800
Commander Luo, that's all in the past.

115
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:19,560
It's not worth mentioning.

116
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:22,070
Miss Lu is such a distinguished person.

117
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:23,600
She's not worth comparing.

118
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:25,470
Forget it. Let's not mention it.

119
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:26,750
Director, why do you

120
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,190
keep talking about me today?

121
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:30,130
Are you suspicious of me?

122
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:33,100
No, no, no, it just came up.

123
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:34,230
If Commander weren't here,

124
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:36,360
I might have already been at No. 90.

125
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,540
Director Zhou.

126
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:43,570
Did you invite us here for a meal

127
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:45,909
or to learn about our family history?

128
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:47,470
A meal, of course.

129
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:50,909
I think it's time to change this nasty habit

130
00:05:50,909 --> 00:05:51,990
in No. 90.

131
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:53,110
Yes.

132
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:57,950
Mr. Li left me here

133
00:05:57,970 --> 00:05:59,770
when he went to Nanjing.

134
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:01,510
Finally, we're having a meal,

135
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:02,950
and you're asking all sorts of questions.

136
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:04,230
It's a trap.

137
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,670
Have you been interrogating prisoners so much

138
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:07,790
that you're now questioning us?

139
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:09,150
No, no, no.

140
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:11,550
Let's not talk about other things.

141
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:12,550
-How about this?
-That's right.

142
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:13,230
It's a misunderstanding.

143
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:14,490
Fill it up for me. Here.

144
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:15,910
I'll pour myself...

145
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:19,200
No, put it down. I'll pour myself three drinks as punishment.

146
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,480
No wonder I couldn't find anyone.

147
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:23,000
You're all hiding here.

148
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:25,060
We're late.

149
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:26,320
We're late.

150
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:27,670
I'm so sorry.

151
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:30,790
Commander Luo, I'm so sorry.

152
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:31,950
Hurry and sit down.

153
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:32,950
Let me introduce.

154
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:35,230
Move.

155
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:38,040
This is Wang Zemin.

156
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,420
Let me introduce him to you.

157
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,260
He is the magistrate of Wu County.

158
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,659
You've known each other.

159
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:45,200
This is Ms. Lyuzhu,

160
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:47,680
a famous actress in the Kunqu opera world.

161
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:51,020
And you must be Miss Lu, right?

162
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:53,470
Hello, I'm Lu Junnuo.

163
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:56,730
Everyone in Suzhou is talking about Commander Luo

164
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:58,190
keeping a mistress.

165
00:06:58,450 --> 00:06:59,500
Gosh! You...

166
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:01,850
You're quite something.

167
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,380
Commander Luo, this...

168
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:05,550
-Commander Luo.
-She's kidding.

169
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:06,730
What about her?

170
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,800
This is my wife, Haimo.

171
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:12,790
Haimo?

172
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,730
I've already spoken to her over the phone.

173
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:19,590
Mrs. Gu is a female ballad singer?

174
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,670
I'm just making a living.

175
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:25,590
You really have a way with words.

176
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:26,710
Well, that's true.

177
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:29,670
But it's nothing compared to you Kunqu opera performers.

178
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:32,720
This is high art, which is appreciated by the court.

179
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:33,880
Haimo, eat something first.

180
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,430
Mrs. Gu is indeed impressive.

181
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:37,270
Even so, I can't keep men.

182
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:40,600
See?

183
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,730
What Mrs. Gu said

184
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:43,900
has thrown all the men

185
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,120
into the water.

186
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:46,159
Right on target.

187
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:47,750
Please excuse me.

188
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:50,730
Director Gu, may I borrow your wife for a moment?

189
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:53,070
Miss Haimo, could you please represent

190
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:54,940
all the women here

191
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:56,750
and toast Miss Lu?

192
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:57,780
No, no, no.

193
00:07:57,909 --> 00:07:58,830
I should do it.

194
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:00,160
Let me fill it up for you.

195
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:04,710
Let me make the toast.

196
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:08,390
Please take care of us in the future,

197
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,390
Mrs. Gu.

198
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:24,750
I really like Suzhou.

199
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,780
Commander Luo,

200
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:29,530
what are your views on the future situation?

201
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,750
I'd like to hear them.

202
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:33,400
Director Zhou and Mr. Li

203
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:34,870
are truly united in purpose.

204
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:36,309
Why did both of you ask me

205
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:38,150
about my views on the situation?

206
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:39,650
I don't have any views.

207
00:08:40,309 --> 00:08:42,270
I'm just a leader in the army.

208
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:44,710
I don't understand politics.

209
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:45,460
I don't.

210
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:48,990
You're hiding it.

211
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:51,850
You're keeping it to yourself and don't want to say.

212
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:53,990
Yizhong,

213
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,860
you studied in America.

214
00:08:58,030 --> 00:09:00,070
Now it's 1943.

215
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:03,150
Since the outbreak of World War II in 1939,

216
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:04,630
it has been almost 4 years.

217
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:07,660
Do you think the Axis will win

218
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:09,530
or will the Allies?

219
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:13,390
Last month, on July 10th,

220
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:16,160
160,000 Allied troops from the U.S. and the U.K.

221
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,510
launched a collective attack on Sicily, Italy,

222
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:20,470
with pincers from the east and west.

223
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:21,350
I believe

224
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:24,410
that Italy will eventually be unable to resist.

225
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:26,320
That would be troublesome.

226
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:29,430
If the Axis loses one member

227
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:32,720
and is left with only Germany and Japan,

228
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,630
that would be a problem.

229
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,200
If the U.S. wins,

230
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:39,990
the dollar is likely to rise.

231
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,790
I didn't stockpile enough dollars a few days ago.

232
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:44,600
Mr. Wang,

233
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:46,510
you should keep stockpiling.

234
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:47,510
It can't be wrong.

235
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,010
[Welcome Pavilion]

236
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:49,470
Miss Lu.

237
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,300
Five Bamboos.

238
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:52,240
Is Commander Luo pursuing you?

239
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:54,970
No, Mrs. Zhou, don't misunderstand.

240
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:56,380
It's obvious.

241
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,820
The way he looks at you is different—

242
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:02,110
full of romance.

243
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:05,010
Let me be candid with you.

244
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:06,240
Please don't mind me.

245
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:08,450
Even though he is remarrying,

246
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:11,590
I've heard that Commander Luo is quite a good man.

247
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:12,830
He's upright.

248
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:14,090
Don't say that.

249
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:15,430
Men are all the same—

250
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:17,430
they always prefer the new.

251
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,630
Before getting married, they think the world of you,

252
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:22,550
but after marriage, they don't even bother to look at you.

253
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:23,880
That's not always true.

254
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:26,450
Look at Vice Director Gu and Mrs. Gu;

255
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:29,430
they're even sweeter after marriage than before.

256
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,470
We're always sweet in front of others.

257
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:33,950
I've seen Vice Director Gu in action.

258
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:35,790
When he talks,

259
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:37,310
he can't stop

260
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:39,120
mentioning his wife.

261
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:41,450
But at home, he's always nitpicking.

262
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:43,490
It's only when he's out

263
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:45,950
that he starts saying nice things about me.

264
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:48,410
Now, those people in the Nanjing government

265
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,810
are like headless chickens.

266
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:53,510
It's laughable.

267
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:57,300
They still think Japan can win.

268
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:58,790
Ridiculous.

269
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:02,070
If it weren't for the corruption among the Kuomintang,

270
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:04,670
the country wouldn't be in such a state.

271
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:06,230
Exactly.

272
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:09,310
It suddenly reminds me that

273
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:11,390
Mr. Li often reprimands us

274
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:14,590
using General Feng's words:

275
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:17,990
A table full of desserts,

276
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:20,900
and half a table of fruits—

277
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:24,350
how could you possibly understand the people's hardships?

278
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,470
A meeting scheduled for two,

279
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:29,270
and everyone shows up by four—

280
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:31,910
is this the spirit of revolution?

281
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:33,760
Absurd!

282
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,040
Utterly absurd.

283
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:38,600
To be honest,

284
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:41,110
the part of General Feng's words

285
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:44,270
I remember most clearly is actually another one:

286
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:46,670
Please share with us.

287
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:50,400
The Japanese army is threatening our country

288
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:52,830
and oppressing our 400 million people.

289
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:55,640
Our compatriots are crying out and vowing

290
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:58,230
to defend the motherland with their lives.

291
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:01,890
Let alone us, patriotic soldiers

292
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:04,850
of iron and blood?

293
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:12,550
You're not pregnant yet?

294
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:16,350
Have you seen

295
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:17,790
the Japanese Western doctor

296
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:19,320
that Mr. Wang introduced to you?

297
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,190
Yes.

298
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:24,470
I've been taking so much medicine that I'm reluctant to take it now.

299
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:26,550
Alright, leave it to me.

300
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:29,790
Women

301
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,190
can do without anything,

302
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:34,410
but not without children.

303
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:41,030
It's my turn.

304
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,110
Mine.

305
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:44,210
I have mahj.

306
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,400
What exactly does Lyuzhu do?

307
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,730
She works for Mr. Li.

308
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:58,750
So she's a female agent then.

309
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:03,790
I heard Mr. Li especially likes female subordinates.

310
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:05,170
How did you know?

311
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:06,270
Ji Yuqing told me.

312
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:07,980
It seems you really need

313
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,810
to be careful with this Lyuzhu.

314
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:15,710
I'm not jealous;

315
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:17,880
I'm just worried about you.

316
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:21,830
About what?

317
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:23,710
I know you're blaming me.

318
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,520
It was my fault.

319
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:30,880
I shouldn't have said that to her.

320
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:32,290
I was too headstrong.

321
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:36,270
You're overthinking it.

322
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:38,890
I actually think you did a good job.

323
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:41,950
A normal wife would feel unhappy

324
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:43,550
in that situation.

325
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:45,350
You acted well.

326
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:48,220
I was really angry,

327
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:49,280
not just acting.

328
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:05,070
At dinner today,

329
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:06,690
Zhou Zhifei kept asking questions.

330
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:08,150
Did he recognize Ruotong?

331
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:13,320
He probably has doubts.

332
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,320
What should we do?

333
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:15,740
Why didn't you notify her

334
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:17,400
to leave Suzhou immediately?

335
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,460
They'll take care of

336
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:22,160
their own business.

337
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:28,070
So, you're not

338
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,550
on the same team as them?

339
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:32,750
Actually,

340
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,810
sometimes I really admire Miss Xiao.

341
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:37,310
She plays Miss Lu

342
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:38,750
so well.

343
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,450
If I hadn't known her before,

344
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:46,030
I might have been completely deceived.

345
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:48,950
Rest early.

346
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,590
Who are you lying to?

347
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,950
Who can sleep tonight?

348
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:10,350
What's wrong?

349
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:13,590
Why do you look so pale?

350
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:16,590
I saw him

351
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:19,380
tonight.

352
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,270
Gu Yizhong?

353
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:24,600
It really is Zhou Zhifei's plot. Don't worry.

354
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:27,070
Don't worry.

355
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,900
I didn't show any signs,

356
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:32,600
and he didn't expose me.

357
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,330
By the way,

358
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:40,200
did you see Junxia today?

359
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:41,230
How did he respond

360
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,900
to my request for evacuation?

361
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:45,020
Junxia left early this morning.

362
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:47,390
I waited for him at the pharmacy for several hours

363
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:48,450
but didn't see him.

364
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:50,430
I was afraid that staying out too long

365
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:51,790
might raise suspicion with the spies,

366
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:52,710
so I came back.

367
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,540
What are you thinking?

368
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:00,510
Today, I found

369
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:02,330
that Miss Lu

370
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:04,320
plays mahjong quite well.

371
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:06,550
She also knows a lot about good places to eat

372
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:07,950
and have fun in Shanghai.

373
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:10,240
She doesn't seem like a communist.

374
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:13,880
Do you think communists don't know these things?

375
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:15,870
They specialize in deceiving people like you.

376
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:17,550
Whether she's a communist or not

377
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:18,840
will become clear once you capture

378
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,910
and interrogate her.

379
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:21,770
Who do you think Commander Luo is?

380
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:25,110
Even Mr. Li has to show him respect

381
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,290
and try to curry favor with him now.

382
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:30,150
Tomorrow,

383
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:32,870
take out all the legal tender, yen, and military tickets

384
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:33,670
from home.

385
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:36,030
I'll have Wang Zemin take them to Shanghai

386
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:37,550
to exchange for U.S. dollars.

387
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:38,650
No way.

388
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:40,750
There's too much. I don't trust Wang Zemin.

389
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,280
Then call your brother back

390
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:43,890
to help with the exchange.

391
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:47,990
I have no confidence

392
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:50,510
in the current situation.

393
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:52,650
We need to prepare for the worst.

394
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:02,160
Who exactly are you?

395
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:07,470
Ms. Lyuzhu, be serious.

396
00:17:09,109 --> 00:17:10,530
You're a communist?

397
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:12,710
You shouldn't say such things lightly.

398
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:13,710
I may lose my head.

399
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:17,540
Are you scared?

400
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:21,140
Then don't be a communist if you're scared.

401
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:24,770
But don't worry.

402
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:27,670
I won't expose you.

403
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:37,540
I'm upright and honest,

404
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,550
with nothing to be ashamed of.

405
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:41,680
I'm not afraid of being exposed by you.

406
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,650
If you still don't believe me,

407
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:47,570
we can go and see Director Zhou right now.

408
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:52,020
How boring.

409
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,710
Aren't people usually afraid

410
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:55,070
when they see a gun?

411
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:57,630
Why didn't you react at all?

412
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:02,180
Ms. Lyuzhu!

413
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:03,000
Get out!

414
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:04,900
Are you crazy?

415
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:06,550
Where did you get the gun?

416
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,780
Where did I get the gun?

417
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,120
Mr. Li gave it to me.

418
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:19,820
For self-defense?

419
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:23,350
Self-defense?

420
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:28,990
It's for suicide.

421
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,440
To keep scummy men like you

422
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:32,330
away from me.

423
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:35,440
Ms. Lyuzhu, I sincerely advise you

424
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:38,030
not to play with guns.

425
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:39,430
Guns can hurt people.

426
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:41,190
I want to play with it.

427
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:47,010
I like how you look as a righteous gentleman.

428
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:48,710
Get lost!

429
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:00,250
Last time you mentioned

430
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,860
you liked mung bean cakes.

431
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:04,430
I brought a few boxes for you.

432
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:08,440
I'm leaving now.

433
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:13,360
You knew Lu Junnuo before?

434
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:15,470
No.

435
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:19,530
You're lying.

436
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:23,740
Women's intuition is quite accurate.

437
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,360
The way you looked at her

438
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:27,270
was different from how you look at us.

439
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:28,670
You're overthinking it.

440
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:30,350
I only met her for the first time

441
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:32,480
when Director Zhou hosted that event.

442
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:40,430
I'm not interested

443
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,910
in you two.

444
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,670
But don't say I didn't warn you—

445
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:46,200
they're investigating Lu Junnuo.

446
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:51,270
They?

447
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:52,620
No. 76.

448
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,630
They are worse than No. 90.

449
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:59,400
She's just a governess.

450
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:01,550
Why are they investigating her?

451
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,150
I heard that

452
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,900
they want to recruit Luo Wuqiang's troops,

453
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:11,480
but Commander Luo is reluctant to agree.

454
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:13,660
The main reason is that

455
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:16,330
Miss Lu is obstructing it.

456
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,970
There are so many things involved.

457
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:21,810
It's like our theater troupe.

458
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:29,950
How are they investigating Miss Lu?

459
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:31,790
I don't know.

460
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:38,410
Didn't you say you don't know Miss Lu?

461
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:40,690
Then why are you concerned about her?

462
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:41,350
I'm not.

463

466
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:13,910
and urge Luo Wuqiang to start a rebellion.

467
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:16,010
More importantly,

468
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:19,110
when I went to Yancheng Army Headquarters last month

469
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:20,920
for the rectification study,

470
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,870
Minister Liu from the Jiangsu Provincial Committee

471
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:24,110
specifically contacted me

472
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:24,940
and said

473
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:27,910
that they have an informant among the Wang Regime officials

474
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:28,860
in Suzhou.

475
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:31,070
This informant can obtain core intelligence

476
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:33,530
about the Wang Regime and even the Japanese.

477
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:36,670
Because the contact was sacrificed,

478
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:37,730
this informant

479
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:39,630
lost contact with the Provincial Committee.

480
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:40,110
Well,

481
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:43,440
that will make it very difficult to re-establish contact.

482
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,590
However, before the contact was sacrificed,

483
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:47,150
they left behind the contact method and code

484
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:49,600

491
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:04,110

492
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,770
this poetry collection

493
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:07,510

00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:10,960
First, make the connection, then confirm the code.

you can set off for Suzhou tomorrow

They plan to launch the attack early tomorrow morning.

leaving the troops without a leader,

727
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:21,200

728
