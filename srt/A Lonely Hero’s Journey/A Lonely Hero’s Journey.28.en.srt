191
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,160
what does that mean?

192
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,550
The Japanese are also thinking of a way out.

193
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:07,270
At this stage of the war,

194
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:11,550
no one knows what will happen tomorrow.

195
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:13,990
Zhifei,

196
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:18,390
I came to Suzhou this time

197
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:22,310
to actually find out

198
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,290
about Luo.

199
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:27,370
You mean Luo Wuqiang?

200
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,430
What's the latest update on the Wu Plan?

201
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:35,990
I don't know what has been going on

202
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:38,240
in the Japanese Command Center recently.

203
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,300
Recently, I can't ask out

204
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:42,350
those military doctors or translators

205
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:44,100
who I could ask out before.

206
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:47,670
They won't even go to the comfort stations.

207
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:49,340
It's not strange.

208
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,180
Things have changed.

209
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:53,370
You mean,

210
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:55,580
the Wu Plan is related to Luo Wuqiang?

211
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,680
It's possible.

212
00:15:57,630 --> 00:16:00,190
Yes, I also heard

213
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,690
that because Luo Wuqiang

214
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:05,510
has 8,000 men and 8,000 guns,

215
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:08,510
Zhou Fohai has been trying to win him over,

216
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,090
hoping he could join the Armed Police Forces.

217
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:12,500
Is that true?

218
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:15,110
Armed Police Forces.

219
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:17,280
You have seen their gear.

220
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:20,320
It's all German equipment.

221
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:23,510
Even the Central Army can't compete with that.

222
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,920
The 33rd Independent Division is amazing.

223
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:33,670
Zhou Fohai is right to have this idea.

224
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,090
So, he wants to win him over;

225
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:37,710
can we also...

226
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:38,670
Of course.

227
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:40,840
Chairman Wang has always been in your corner.

228
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:43,430
We can't say

229
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:45,090
who will win in the future.

230
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:49,190
But, as long as we have people

231
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:51,350
who have the power and can build an army,

232
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:53,350
it can also give us

233
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:55,600
a seat at the table in the future.

234
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:57,760
Mr. Li,

235
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:00,970
you're really foresighted.

236
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,550
It doesn't matter

237
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:05,690
who Lonely Boat is.

238
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:09,040
Just let him stick there

239
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:10,020
like a nail.

240
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,040
Maybe

241
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:16,950
we'll need to use him.

242
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:22,390
Got it.

243
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:24,069
How is Yuqing?

244
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,050
My Yuqing?

245
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,350
Who else could it be?

246
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:34,030
She's good. Just live a life.

247
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:38,260
There is a great wisdom in living a life.

248
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:41,850
It's not easy to live a good life.

249
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,380
Who doesn't want that?

250
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:47,830
My wife has been giving me a hard time lately,

251
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,600
a mess.

252
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:55,220
By the way,

253
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:57,610
I don't know if you still remember

254
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:58,960
a friend of mine,

255
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:01,380
Lyuzhu.

256
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:05,440
You've seen her before.

257
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,450
The one in the Kun Opera business, right?

258
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:13,850
Does your wife get mad at you because of her?

259
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:19,030
She can't stay in Nanjing anymore.

260
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:20,790
I wonder

261
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:24,010
where she can find a place to stay.

262
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,000
Ask her to come to Suzhou.

263
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:31,270
Ask Ms. Lyuzhu to come to Suzhou. I'll arrange everything for her.

264
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:32,110
To Suzhou?

265
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:34,950
Why haven't I thought of that?

266
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:40,550
The scenery, weather, and stores

267
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:41,440
are all good.

268
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:42,550
I'll arrange it.

269
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:44,810
Then I'll leave this

270
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:47,910
to you.

271
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:49,280
I got it.

272
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,870
It's just to resettle a woman.

273
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,730
Why are you so worried?

274
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:02,470
You don't understand.

275
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:03,400
This woman

276
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:05,030
is a big trouble.

277
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:06,350
Why?

278
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:08,190
Back then, Mr. Li

279
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,990
placed her in Shanghai

280
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,200
and asked Zhang Dabao from the Garrison Headquarters

281
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,260
to take care of her.

282
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,560
In less than two months,

283
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,760
Zhang Jiabao was executed by shooting.

284
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:20,460
Then he sent her to Nanjing,

285
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,910
and she was suspected of having an affair with Xie Changle,

286
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:25,070
the Deputy Governor of Jiangsu Province.

287
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:27,710
Xie Changle was shot to death.

288
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,120
She is indeed a troublemaker.

289
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:33,890
We can't do this.

290
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,790
Do I dare not do the Bodhisattva's business?

291
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,590
Find an excuse.

292
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:41,150
What excuse?

293
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:46,740
Leave this tricky task

294
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:48,310
to Gu Yizhong.

295
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,360
Gu Yizhong? Why?

296
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:52,790
You are uncouth

297
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:54,910
and don't know how to take care of women.

298
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:56,830
But Gu Yizhong is different.

299
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:58,850
Last time, when I was at the dinner party

300
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:00,910
of the Shanghai Cultural Committee,

301
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:03,440
I noticed that all the ladies were around him.

302
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:05,510
Well, you ask Gu Yizhong

303
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:07,150
to take care of Lyuzhu.

304
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:08,720
If he takes good care of her,

305
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:10,820
you get the credit.

306
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,110
Then, if Lyuzhu

307
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:14,110
also comes on to Gu Yizhou,

308
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:15,680
use Mr. Li

309
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:17,950
to kill Gu Yizhong.

310
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:30,110
You women are indeed the most vicious!

311
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:32,410
Then you tell me, who did I learn it from?

312
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,510
Only I can handle you!

313
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:35,930
You're so scary!

314
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,350
Yizhong.

315
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:51,590
You're in the office.

316
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:52,240
Director Zhou.

317
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,490
It's okay. Sit down.

318
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:56,510
Nothing serious.

319
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,300
I just came to check in on you.

320
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:01,910
I haven't been

321
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:04,440
in this office much.

322
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,100
This was Huang Xinzhai's office before.

323
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:08,840
I know.

324
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,290
It looks good now.

325
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:14,590
Back then, it was very ugly

326
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:16,810
with all the Chinese and Western stuff.

327
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:18,400
You're busy?

328
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,410
Is this a lamp?

329
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:25,900
No.

330
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:26,710
A model.

331
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:28,880
Yes.

332
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,620
This is a construction model. It's good.

333
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:34,590
Put a light bulb here.

334
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:36,430
Pull the string, and it lights up.

335
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:37,560
Then you have a lamp.

336
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:41,360
This is made of copper.

337
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:42,460
Neat.

338
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:49,290
Why don't you sit down and join me for some tea?

339
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:49,970
No need.

340
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:51,600
Go ahead. I don't have anything serious.

341
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,820
I'll go back first.

342
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:54,040
Director Zhou,

343
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,570
you're here for something, right?

344
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:57,620
Have a seat.

345
00:21:58,050 --> 00:21:58,820
Okay. Okay.

346
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,200
You too, sit.

347
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:09,950
Yizhong,

348
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:12,430
if you need

349
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,610
any furniture

350
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:15,250
or decorations,

351
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:16,250
just let me know.

352
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:18,200
Write an application,

353
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,330
and I'll approve it.

354
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:20,730
I like the way it is now.

355
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:23,190
Yes.

356
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:27,410
What's the matter?

357
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:32,940
About the matter

358
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:35,280
I told you over the phone last night,

359
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:36,430
what do you think?

360
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:40,430
What matter?

361
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:43,650
Mr. Li's matter.

362
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:47,610
Director Zhou,

363
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,960
you accused me of colluding with the Communist Party just a few days ago,

364
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:52,090
and now you regard me as one of your own?

365
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:54,500
It was all a misunderstanding.

366
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:57,350
Those people at No. 76 did it.

367
00:22:58,700 --> 00:22:59,810
When I found out about it later,

368
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:00,710
I was very angry.

369
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:02,140
I called Wan Lilang

370
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:03,830
and I said, "We're all comrades.

371
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:05,110
You can't do this."

372
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,050
"We must trust each other."

373
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:11,550
Then, the wonton shop across my house

374
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:13,110
is also from No. 76?

375
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:17,820
Do you think it is possible that they're behind it?

376
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:19,550
It's possible. It's also them.

Yizhong.

378
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,150
Mr. Li

379
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:26,210
is our superior.

380
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,430
We need to

381
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:29,070
help him with his business.

382
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,360
Right?

383
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:38,510
I can't do anything

384
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:39,750
about Lyuzhu.

385
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,500
Yizhong.

386
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:44,630
Only you

387
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:46,550
can help me with this.

388
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,340
You and Ms. Lyuzhu

389
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:50,060
are the same age.

390
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,960
There's a huge age gap

391
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:55,190
between her and me.

392
00:23:55,690 --> 00:23:56,510
Besides,

393
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:58,590
you may not know

394
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:00,250
about my wife.

395
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:02,580
She is a hen.

396
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,610
She will yell at me

397
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:06,320
if I come home late from work.

398
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,080
What if Lyuzhu and I...

399
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,260
Director Zhou, I really understand you.

400
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:11,320
Haimo is not easy to deal with either.

401
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,890
Haimo is good.

402
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:14,790
Everyone at the station knows

403
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,850
that she's kind and reasonable.

404
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:21,550
Take a look at this.

405
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,800
A friend of mine from Hangzhou

406
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,470
brought me, this year's Hangzhou Longjing tea.

407
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:27,590
You take it.

408
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,100
Here, let me make some tea with it for you.

409
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:33,190
You're drinking tea. Alright.

410
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:36,480
Even if I agree,

411
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,020
Mr. Li...

412
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:41,270
Don't worry about Mr. Li.

413
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,910
He mentioned you over the phone many times.

414
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:46,930
He said he really admired you

415
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:47,950
and hoped I would

416
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,250
give you more opportunities.

417
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:50,210
After thinking about it,

418
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:52,270
this is the best opportunity for you.

419
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:54,000
You can establish a connection

420
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,020
with him beforehand.

421
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:56,020
What do you think?

422
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:56,830
Right?

423
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:04,120
Thank you. Thank you.

424
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:06,000
I didn't expect you to agree so quickly.

425
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Thank you so much.

426
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:07,960
It's a deal then.

427
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:08,870
Don't forget to drink the tea.

428
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:10,470
Right, the wonton shop.

429
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:11,450
I'll ask Captain Zhang

430
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:12,930
to remove that stall now.

431
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,920
Then, I'll leave your safety to yourself.

432
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,210
Take care of yourself.

433
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:18,630
Well, remember to drink that tea.

You're Gu Yizhong?

436
00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:56,910
Hello, Ms. Lyuzhu.

437
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:59,490
Director Zhou asked me to accompany you.

438
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,620
Let's start with the Daimaru Department Store.

00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:51,270
Ms. Lyuzhu,

442
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:52,670
how about I put them here?

443
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:11,620
If there's nothing else,

444
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:12,700
I'll go back first.

445
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,180
It's really the Director who asked you to accompany me?

446
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:19,370
I hate Zhou.

447
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,250
So cunning.

448
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:25,670
I'm exhausted after a whole day of shopping.

449
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:27,110
My legs are numb.

450
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:33,750
Don't you understand what I'm saying?

451
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:35,150
Come and massage my legs.

452
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:36,750
I...

453
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:38,250
I am...

454
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:40,640
I'm so clumsy.

455
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:41,780
I can't do that.

456
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,200
If you need a message,

457
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:45,570
I'll get you

458
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:46,840
a blind masseur in Suzhou.

459
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:47,840
It's very famous here.

460
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,840
What do you think?

461
00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:50,650
A blind?

462
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:54,090
What else does that blind know

463
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:55,300
besides massage?

464
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:00,830
Stop!

465
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:09,560
Why are you running?

466
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:11,400
Are you afraid I'll eat you?

467
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:14,920
Please behave yourself.

468
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,240
I hate people like you.

469
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:19,730
How about this?

470
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:21,760
I'll get you

00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:23,160

What are we going to do with me tomorrow?

477
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:38,710
Director Zhou said

478
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:40,950
that you are interested in the gardens in Suzhou.

479
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:43,840
How about I take you to the Lion Grove Garden and the Lingering Garden?

What do you think?

481
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,090
You think my legs aren't thick enough?

482
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,960
What about ballads?

483
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:50,610
So old-fashioned.

484
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:52,840
Well...

485
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,350
Suzhou embroidery then.

Suzhou embroidery

00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:57,870
combines traditional embroidery skills,

488
00:28:57,870 --> 00:28:58,950
of "setting a needle in a row and connecting it closely with its thread"...

489
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:01,150
Is there anything you don't know about?

490
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:02,960
I'm from Suzhou.

491
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,960
Zhou knows how to avoid trouble for himself.

492
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:07,990
He threw the task

493
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,500
that Mr. Li gave him to you.

494
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:12,800
Our director has a lot of work to do.

495
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:14,970
Just a lousy director.

496
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:16,790
You make him sound busier

497
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:18,520
than a minister or a president.

498
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:20,230
Forget it.

499
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:21,690
Come pick me up at 7 p.m.

500
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:23,850
I'm going to take a nap now

501
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:24,980
to refresh myself.

502
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:28,050
I'm going to the dance hall tonight to have fun.

503
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:43,880
What happened?

504
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:48,410
Why are you so tired?

505
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,840
You women can surely walk.

506
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,850
You really went shopping with her?

507
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:03,480
You bought a new tea set?

508
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:07,840
It's from that Japanese guy, Ono.

509
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:10,430
He said he couldn't learn the ballads without paying tuition.

510
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:12,170
I couldn't accept his money.

511
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,320
No other way,

512
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:15,210
so he gave me this tea set instead.

513
00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:18,740
Has the wonton stall across the street been removed?

514
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:20,940
It was removed as soon as you left today.

515
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,180
Zhou is not spying on you anymore?

516
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:27,820
It's all because I accompanied Ms. Lyuzhu.

517
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,970
You're good, having it both ways

518
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:47,510
Hello.

519
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:49,890
Is Gu Yizhong there?

520
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:55,740
Are you looking for Gu Yizhong?

521
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:56,540
Who are you?

522
00:30:57,310 --> 00:30:58,750
Who are you?

523
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,960
I'm Mrs. Gu.

524
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:08,090
Who is it?

525
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:12,370
So, this is the lady you're accompanying.

526
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:14,290
She has a temper.

527
00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:18,190
I don't mind it.

528
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:20,520
But Mr. Gu,

529
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:23,430
don't do something against your marital status.

530
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:27,760
Can you give me a break?

531
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:30,130
I have to go dancing with her tonight.

532
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:50,010
I didn't expect you

533
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:51,440
to be good at dancing.

534
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,300
You're good at dancing.

535
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:56,990
I only learned a little when I was in New York.

536
00:32:56,990 --> 00:32:57,800
I'm not good.

537
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:01,790
So you come to places like this often?

538
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,750
Occasionally, mostly about work.

539
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:08,410
Today is also about work, right?

540
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,530
What did you say?

541
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:13,880
I can't hear you.

542
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:18,320
Cheers.

543
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:23,380
May I have your next dance?

544
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:27,260
Pour me some wine.

545
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,210
He is talking to you.

546
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:30,520
Did you hear him?

547
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,090
Why are you shouting?

548
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:32,910
Who are you?

549
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,520
How... How dare you...

550
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:38,050
I saw you dance well.

551
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,740
I'd like to ask you for a dance.

552
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,280
Pour me some wine.

553
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:47,470
I'm tired. I don't want to dance.

554
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,520
You should feel honored that the Colonel asks you

555
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:51,560
to dance.

556
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:55,030
Don't make us do it the hard way.

557
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:58,880
Let's go back.

558
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:02,020
Sir. Sir.

559
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,030
My friend is drunk.

560
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:04,160
Please forgive her.

561
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:05,050
Who the hell are you?

562
00:34:05,050 --> 00:34:05,780
Get lost!

563
00:34:20,429 --> 00:34:22,199
Mr. Ito, you're here.

564
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:23,750
Mr. Ono.

565
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:26,150
Mr. Ono.

566
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:29,840
There's been a misunderstanding?

567
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,080
My friend is drunk,

568
00:34:31,449 --> 00:34:32,909
and I'll take her back now.

569
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,270
I don't want to go,

570
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:35,949
and I'm not drunk.

571
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:38,260
They started it.

572
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:40,590
Bastard, I'll kill you!

573
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:41,790
Sir, put your gun down.

574
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:42,719
Put the gun down!

575
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:44,440
Calm down.

576
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:49,830
Mr. Ito,

577
00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:51,260
if the Commander of the Kobayashi Division

578
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:53,010
knows about this,

579
00:34:53,389 --> 00:34:55,170
he must be very angry.

580
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:56,159
How about this?

581
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:59,440
Let it go for my sake.

582
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:05,040
Put the gun down.

583
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,680
Mr. Ono,

584
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:09,900
excuse us.

585
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:18,110
Mr. Ono,

586
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:20,360
thank you very much.

587
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:26,210
Once the soldiers come here and get drunk,

588
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,230
they will do anything.

589
00:35:28,810 --> 00:35:30,540
Get out of this troubled place.

590
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:31,930
Thank you.

591
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:39,360
[Amiability Invites Propitiousness]

592
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:55,020
Come up and have a drink.

593
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:56,070
It's too late.

594
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,460
I should head home.

595
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:02,520
You don't want to drink,

596
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,690
or you don't dare to?

597
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:11,340
Ms. Lyuzhu,

598
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:13,390
do you know who that Japanese

599
00:36:13,390 --> 00:36:14,270
is tonight?

600
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:16,070
Does it matter to me

601
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:17,900
who he is?

602
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:19,970
The Japanese kill without blinking.

603
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:20,830
Are you scared?

604
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:25,710
You can leave me alone if you're afraid.

605
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,770
You're afraid of the Japanese,

606
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:30,300
but I'm not.

607
00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:32,190
Mr. Li said

608
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:33,940
that in China,

609
00:36:34,270 --> 00:36:35,400
they can't go anywhere

610
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,760
without us.

611
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,830
Don't say anything like that in public.

612
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:40,590
I will.

613
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:41,100
Don't be willful.

614
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:41,830
I am willful.

615
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:43,030
Since I've been entrusted with the task, I'll do my best.

616
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:44,490
I must ensure your safety.

617
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:46,950
Then I should be a dance-hostess

618
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:48,310
for that Japanese?

619
00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:52,910
Ms. Lyuzhu,

620
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:55,470
I understand very well that

621
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:57,230
you don't want to dance with a Japanese.

622
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:59,470
I just don't want you to get yourself into trouble.

623
00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:01,130
There are many ways to reject people

624
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:03,330
instead of irritating them on purpose.

625
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:05,040
Gu,

626
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:06,690
who do you think you are?

627
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:09,460
It's not up to you

628
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:11,190
to teach me what to do.

629
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:13,920
You look like a man.

630
00:37:14,350 --> 00:37:16,350
I thought you'd have a pair of balls.

631
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:17,950
I didn't expect

632
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:20,000
you to be the same as them.

633
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:46,530
Madam, it's so late.

634
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:47,950
You can go to bed,

635
00:37:48,290 --> 00:37:50,500
and I'll wait for him.

636
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:52,750
I'm fine. I'm not sleepy.

637
00:37:53,990 --> 00:37:55,850
[Blessed]

638
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:04,300
Sir, you're finally back.

639
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,880
Madam has been waiting for you all night.

640
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,570
Didn't I tell you not to wait for me

641
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:09,890
to come home from work anymore.

642
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:11,250
You can all rest early.

643
00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:12,840
Mrs. Wang, lotus seed soup.

644
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:14,480
Mrs. Wang, don't fetch it.

645
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:15,490
I'm too tired.

646
00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:17,170
You all rest early.

647
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,980
Mrs. Wang, you go to bed too.

648
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:45,560
Mrs. Wang.

649
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:47,250
Yes, Young Master.

650
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:49,660
Why is there only one dish today?

651
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,390
Madam said you have a weak stomach,

652
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:55,630
so you can't eat meat

653
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:57,560
and can only have something light.

654
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:00,050
Well, Haimo told you that.

655
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:02,120
Yes, those are her original words.

656
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,770
You drink every day,

657
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:12,430
so I asked Mrs. Wang to make

658
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:15,360
some lotus seed and Gordon Euryale seed soup for you.

659
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:18,980
Is there more here, between the lines?

660
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:19,810
I dare not.

661
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:24,320
Haimo.

662
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:27,150
I hate that you drink every day.

663
00:39:29,290 --> 00:39:31,010
I hate how you mess around

664
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:32,590
with ladies or Madams,

665
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:33,580
from Nanjing or Shanghai,

666
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:35,030
and frequent those ridiculous places

667
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:37,160
like amusement parks and dance halls.

668
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:39,670
Although I'm your fake wife,

669
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:42,080
I deserve some respect,

670
00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:43,180
Mr. Gu.

671
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:49,190
Junsheng,

672
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:51,690
let's go back to your room.

673
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:05,690
Director Zhou!

674
00:40:06,350 --> 00:40:07,030
Yizhong!

675
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:07,890
Director Zhou,

676
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:10,190
I can't serve that lady anymore.

677
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:11,230
Yizhong,

678
00:40:11,310 --> 00:40:12,510
what did she do to you?

679
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:14,550
I've been paying for all her expenses.

680
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:15,590
If this goes on,

681
00:40:15,590 --> 00:40:17,110
I'll have to sell my Gu's Garden.

682
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:18,630
It's not that serious.

683
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:19,770
How about this?

684
00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:21,150
I'll reimburse you

685
00:40:21,310 --> 00:40:22,670
for the expenses.

686
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:23,380
3,000.

687
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:24,880
3,000!

688
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:25,740
Man,

689
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:28,630
what did she buy that cost 3,000 legal tenders?

690
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:30,350
Why don't you ask her yourself

691
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:31,270
and find out what she has been buying

692
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:32,390
all day long?

693
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:33,300
I'm not lying.

694
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:34,980
I trust you!

695
00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:37,510
3,000.

696
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:38,920
That's a bit much.

697
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,180
How about this?

698
00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:41,120
Give me a few days,

699
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:42,650
and I'll give you the money.

700
00:40:43,790 --> 00:40:45,070
I have to say,

701
00:40:45,850 --> 00:40:47,310
you've been through a lot.

702
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:49,280
But hear me out.

703
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:52,150
Take good care of this lady,

704
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:55,990
and in a few days when Mr. Li returns from his trip...

705
00:40:56,430 --> 00:40:57,290
Think about it.

706
00:40:57,650 --> 00:41:00,070
Lyuzhu will definitely put in a good word for you.

707
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:01,670
Once she praises you,

708
00:41:01,790 --> 00:41:02,710
think about it.

709
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:04,870
Mr. Li will immediately think

710
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:06,290
that you are one of us.

711
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:08,430
Your career will take off like a rocket

712
00:41:08,430 --> 00:41:10,190
in the future.

713
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:14,600
Thank you, Director.

714
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:17,950
We're in this together. No need for thanks.

715
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:18,670
Brother,

716
00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:20,390
I'll always keep you in mind

717
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:22,250
when good opportunities come up.

718
00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:23,950
Okay,

719
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:25,310
I'll leave you to it.

720
00:41:25,310 --> 00:41:26,230
Okay.

721
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:27,150
Thank you.

722
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:43,790
I hear your skills have improved remarkably,

723
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,880
and my wife can't teach you anymore.

724
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:48,530
Mrs. Gu is too modest.

725
00:41:49,390 --> 00:41:50,030
By the way,

726
00:41:50,350 --> 00:41:51,500
I have a friend

727
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:54,730
who is going to host a birthday party.

728
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:57,040
He knows I can sing ballads,

729
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:59,670
so he's insisting I perform at his birthday party.

730
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:01,230
But I'm not good enough...

731
00:42:02,990 --> 00:42:06,180
So, I'd like to ask Mrs. Gu

732
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:09,350
to go with me.

733
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:11,700
What do you say?

734
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:13,760
Mr. Ono,

735
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,430
is your friend

736
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:17,860
Chinese

737
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:19,320
or Japanese?

738
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:23,310
He's a Japanese army officer.

739
00:42:24,590 --> 00:42:26,770
We're just ordinary people.

740
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:29,720
Getting too close to Japanese army officers

741
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:31,830
might lead to misunderstandings.

742
00:42:31,830 --> 00:42:33,550
I understand.

743
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:37,470
But my friend

744
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:39,820
is not an ordinary man.

745
00:42:39,850 --> 00:42:42,530
He is Mr. Kobayashi Nobuo.
