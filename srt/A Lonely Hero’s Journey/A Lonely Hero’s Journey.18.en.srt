00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:46,420
If Chiang wants to be a traitor,

194
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:47,870
sorry, he's too late.

195
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:51,550
The number one traitor in the Kuomintang

196
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:53,740
is none other than our Mr. Wang.

197
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,450
My purpose for coming to Shanghai this time

198
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:04,530
is to connect with those

199
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:06,390
who are capable and committed to resisting the Japanese.

200
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:07,630
You can save that rhetoric

201
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:09,270
for the reporters.

202
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,190
Since the start of the resistance,

203
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:22,670
no central committee member of the Kuomintang

204
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:23,520
has died.

205
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:26,290
The word "Xian" in my name means "first."

206
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:27,619
Just let them arrest me.

207
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:29,790
I admire that.

208
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:59,640
I know your wife and child are coming

209
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:01,070
to Suzhou tomorrow. Is that right?

210
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:03,000
Don't try to play this game with me!

211
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,090
I've seen this too many times.

212
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:11,610
The reason they're my family is because

213
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:13,390
they understand that I'm ready

214
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:16,050
to sacrifice myself for the country at any time.

215
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:17,310
I'm one of you.

216
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:18,490
I'm one of you.

217
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:19,840
Director.

218
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,410
The Japanese have stormed in.

219
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:35,890
Mr. Jiang,

220
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:37,420
there's something

221
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:38,950
I need to ask for your instructions on.

222
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:39,710
What is it?

223
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:46,540
Hurry up.

224
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,870
[Ward 4]

225
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:57,330
[Ward 6]

226
00:18:58,390 --> 00:18:59,440
What happened?

227
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:00,080
Just now,

228
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,440
a few reckless members

229
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:02,350
of the Loyal and Righteous Army

230
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:03,810
tried to stir up trouble at the hospital,

231
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:04,870
and we killed them.

232
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:05,430
Guards!

233
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:07,970
Have our brothers

234
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:10,510
[Ward 6]

235
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,470
search the whole hospital immediately.

236
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:10,590
If any of their people are still around,

237
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:11,490
kill them on sight!

238
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:11,990
Yes!

239
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,230
[Ward 6]

240
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:10,550
How many times have I told you?

241
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:12,190
You can't save Jiang Boxian!

242
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:13,370
Why didn't you listen?

243
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:14,830
Do you know that besides

244
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:16,110
the people from No. 90,

245
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:17,150
Mr. Li had two teams

246
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:18,140
waiting for you at the hospital?

247
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:20,590
They were just waiting for you to walk into their trap.

248
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:22,400
I have to complete my mission myself.

249
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,130
Xinping,

250
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:25,120
you're an experienced comrade.

251
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:27,190
Can't you stop being so naive

252
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:29,340
as to carry out such a foolish mission?

253
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:32,100
In your eyes,

254
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,970
all risks are foolish.

255
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:35,670
You only know four words:

256
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:37,030
adapt to the situation.

257
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:39,360
That's because I don't want to die in vain.

258
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:40,150
Do you know

259
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:40,830
what would happen

260
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:41,790
if you got caught today?

261
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:43,520
Have you thought about others?

262
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:46,370
Don't worry.

263
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,070
If I got caught,

264
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:49,610
I wouldn't drag you down with me.

265
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:51,730
You're still so self-righteous.

266
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,070
If, as you said,

267
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:54,420
Jiang Boxian was sent from Chongqing

268
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,240
to negotiate with the Japanese,

269
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,640
then I must take him away.

270
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:58,150
I can't let Generalissimo Chiang

271
00:20:58,150 --> 00:20:59,640
surrender with Wang Jingwei.

272
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,210
I have to prevent this from happening.

273
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:02,610
You?

274
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,580
That's ridiculous.

275
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:07,550
What makes you think you can stop it?

276
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:09,170
Today they sent Jiang Boxian;

277
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:11,370
tomorrow they'll send a Wang Boxian or a Li Boxian.

278
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:12,970
How many people can you stop?

279
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:15,950
Do you really think you can save the country

280
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:17,450
and the nation all by yourself?

281
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:17,940
Yes.

282
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:25,020
Ou Xinping,

283
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:28,030
you're as naive as ever.

284
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:34,030
Of course,

285
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:36,490
if everyone in the National Government

286
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:37,730
were like you,

287
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:39,750
this country

288
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:42,110
wouldn't have fallen into such a state.

289
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:48,740
You finally said something sensible.

290
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:55,220
Okay.

291
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,060
You might be right.

292
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,210
But I want to tell you this:

293
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:02,380
Why does Mr. Li

294
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:04,670
insist on detaining Jiang Boxian?

295
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:06,650
Think about it.

296
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:08,470
Doesn't he also hope to

297
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:09,690
prevent Jiang Boxian

298
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:11,630
from negotiating with the Japanese?

299
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:12,570
So I think

300
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,370
our goals

301
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,950
are the same.

302
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:17,710
Why can't you understand that?

303
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:22,540
Mr. Li is your backing,

304
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,950
not ours.

305
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:25,030
What's going on?

306
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,250
Why are you fighting in the middle of the night?

307
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:28,170
Go out!

308
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,610
No.

309
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:32,750
Could both of you please leave?

310
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,350
It's too late. I need to rest.

311
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:39,360
Ou Xinping!

312
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:43,440
Zhou...

313
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,890
Take out your gun.

314
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:47,430
I'm still here.

315
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:49,890
What are you doing? Why are you touching her?

316
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:51,230
You do it.

317
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:53,250
Don't move!

318
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:57,400
She can't hide a gun here.

319
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:58,690
It's under her armpit.

320
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,300
And the inner thigh.

321
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:08,860
I'm very familiar

322
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:09,870
with your tricks.

323
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:10,990
Ridiculous.

324
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:15,630
Ji, come out.

325
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:18,270
Go out.

326
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:21,210
You didn't hide a gun in this room, did you?

327
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:29,790
I'm telling you,

328
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,600
from now on,

329
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:33,830
you can't leave this room by even a step.

330
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:58,590
Run!

331
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:02,360
Did you catch another big fish?

332
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:07,270
I see some unfamiliar faces.

333
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:08,510
They are from Shanghai,

334
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:09,710
from No. 76.

335
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:23,110
Get in!

336
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:23,710
Go in!

337
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:39,430
Didn't you go to the hospital?

338
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:40,960
Why did they bring you back?

339
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:49,400
Communist brother, help me!

340
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:50,670
I can't go on living!

341
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:52,020
Help me!

342
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:54,050
I support the Kuomintang-Communist cooperation!

343
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:54,900
I do!

344
00:24:54,930 --> 00:24:55,310
Shut up.

345
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:56,470
I always support the Kuomintang-Communist cooperation!

346
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:57,250
I am...

347
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:58,220
Shut up.

348
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:00,470
I really can't go on living!

349
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:01,090
Sit there.

350
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:10,910
What does he want?

351
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:14,310
He's been wandering downstairs all morning.

352
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:19,070
I've arranged two gunmen

353
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:20,470
in the prison.

354
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:22,820
If Gu Yizhong

355
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:24,210
goes in the prison

356
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:26,900
and tries to approach the dungeon,

357
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:28,720
he will be shot to death.

358
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:30,270
Gu Yizhong

359
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:32,860
was an Outstanding Trainee in the agent station's training program.

360
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:34,660
He's not as foolish as you think.

361
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:37,520
Even the smartest student

362
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,020
can't outwit the teacher.

363
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:41,820
I’ve asked Xie Wenchao to keep watch outside.

364
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:44,080
You go and guard the inside of the prison.

365
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:48,860
The dungeon stinks.

366
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:49,670
It's okay.

367
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:50,540
If it stinks,

368
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:52,400
I'll have a new one built for you

369
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:53,570
and spray some perfume.

370
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:54,700
How does that sound?

371
00:25:58,550 --> 00:25:59,440
I'll go now.

372
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:34,580
22, 23...

373
00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:56,430
Go.

374
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:02,990
Twenty-three steps in total.

375
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:10,360
Twenty-three steps,

376
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:11,760
which is...

377
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:25,560
Fifty feet, which is 5 Zhang.

378
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:46,970
Sir.

379
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,620
Xiao Junxia is not dead.

380
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:49,580
Not dead?

381
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:50,640

570
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:18,390
No.

571
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:23,390
Well...

572
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:25,640
Who are these three people?

573
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:26,910
Grave robbers.

574
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:28,530
I told them

575
00:37:28,930 --> 00:37:30,690
there are treasures buried underground,

576
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:32,690
many of which are rare and valuable.

577
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:35,750
But isn't that lying?

578
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:36,810
Won't there be any risk?

579
00:37:36,810 --> 00:37:38,480
Desperate times call for desperate measures.

580
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,180
They're experts in digging tunnels.

581
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:40,780
Remember,

582
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:42,870
my surname is Sha and yours is Lu.

583
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:51,990
[Xiangfusi Lane]

584
00:37:57,470 --> 00:37:58,070
Take it.

585
00:37:58,510 --> 00:37:59,190
Don't move.

586
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:13,110
Here.

587
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:37,060
What?

588
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:39,220
That's what you call professional.

589
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,680
Yizhong! Yizhong!

590
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:32,430
Vice Director.

591
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,260
Have some peanuts.

592
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:42,880
I heard something happened at the Appeasement Military Hospital.

593
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:44,700
What happened?

594
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,630
The night before last,

595
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:49,350
No. 76 sent someone

596
00:39:49,350 --> 00:39:50,270
to our dungeon.

597
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:52,470
You really don't know?

598
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:57,170
Let me show you something.

599
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:03,590
This is the resume of Ou Xinping,

600
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:05,930
who was Zhou Zhifei's old flame

601
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:08,230
back when he was in the CBIS.

602
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:07,030
[Ou Xinping]

603
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:10,160
[Position: Head of the Suzhou Operation Zone, CBIS]

604
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:11,250
Vice Director,

605
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:13,970
you really have a way with things.

606
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:17,790
Quite a few people at No. 76 know her.

607
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:19,610
This Ou Xinping

608
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:21,460
[Ou Xinping] [Position: Head of the Suzhou Operation Zone, CBIS]

609
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:21,550
is a seasoned CBIS agent,

610
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:25,580
one of the so-called "20 Arhats" who helped build the CBIS from the ground up.

611
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:26,670
Arhats?

612
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:31,740
Because of Zhou Zhifei,

613
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:34,390
Xu Enzeng sent her back to Suzhou this time,

614
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:37,110
with the goal of pulling Zhou Zhifei back in.

615
00:40:40,810 --> 00:40:41,600
No way.

616
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:46,610
Is there anything that's impossible for us agents?

617
00:40:47,090 --> 00:40:48,550
Yizhong, don't forget,

618
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:50,140
agents

619
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:52,590
serve political purposes.

620
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:12,370
Vice Director,

621
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:14,940
are you kidding me?

622
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:16,580
The photo is so blurred.

623
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:18,710
Look, which one of these two

624
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:19,670
is she?

625
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:22,830
This one.

626
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:25,870
The person is a bit hard to make out,

627
00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:29,020
but you can tell by the height, build,

628
00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:29,850
and demeanor.

629
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,990
Zhou Zhifei didn't teach you these—

630
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:37,620
thank you—

631
00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:39,350
during your training?

632
00:41:43,990 --> 00:41:45,390
This Zhou Zhifei.

633
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,180
I'm telling you, Yizhong,

634
00:41:48,350 --> 00:41:50,150
identifying a disguised person

635
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:53,910
requires more than just looking at

636
00:41:53,910 --> 00:41:55,150
their appearance.

637
00:41:55,870 --> 00:41:57,190
I'm inexperienced

638
00:41:57,750 --> 00:41:59,810
and still have a lot to learn from you.

639
00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:04,410
Vice Director,

640
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,300
what should we do next?

641
00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:12,150
It won't take long

642
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:14,310
before I expose her.

643
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,560
[Vice Director's Office]

644
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:18,840
I have dispatched all the personnel of the Intelligence Station.

645
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,790
But she's a seasoned CBIS agent,

646
00:42:21,010 --> 00:42:23,410
so it won't be that easy to catch her, right?

647
00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:26,720
Yizhong,

648
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:28,980
don't forget my background.

649
00:42:29,970 --> 00:42:30,970
I'm from the NBIS.

650
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,820
Let me reveal a bit more.

651
00:42:37,170 --> 00:42:38,580
Chief Wan Lilang

652
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:40,310
has assigned

653
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:41,900
a team from No. 76 to me,

654
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:44,400
which is under my unified command.

655
00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:47,010
They are stationed at Xinsu Hotel.

656
00:42:47,010 --> 00:42:48,290
Two of them

657
00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:49,750
know this Ou.

658
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:52,070
Not to mention Arhats,

659
00:42:52,590 --> 00:42:54,150
even Sun Wukong wouldn't escape.
