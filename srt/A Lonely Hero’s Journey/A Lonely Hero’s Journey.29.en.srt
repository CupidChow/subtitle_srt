00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,310
If your friend

5
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:42,800
Chinese

6
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:44,070
or Japanese?

7
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:48,110
He's a Japanese officer.

8
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,270
But my friend

9
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:53,630
is not an ordinary person.

10
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:56,229
He is Mr. Kobayashi Nobuo.

11
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,329
Do you know about Kobayashi Nobuo?

12
00:02:19,829 --> 00:02:22,010
He is the highest-ranking Japanese commander stationed in Suzhou,

13
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:23,010
General Officer,

14
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,350
and Commander of the Kobayashi Division.

15
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:26,950
Could there be a conspiracy?

16
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:29,550
To be honest,

17
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,520
I've been looking for a chance to contact him,

18
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,180
but there has been no channel.

19
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:36,550
Maybe this birthday party

20
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:38,630
could be a breakthrough.

21
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:43,640
Then why did you refuse Ono?

22
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:49,850
Agreeing directly to Mr. Ono's invitation

23
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,430
will raise suspicion.

24
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:53,990
And I was also worried that Mr. Ono

25
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:55,750
was testing us.

26
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,930
Based on the observations from these days,

27
00:02:57,930 --> 00:02:59,230
I think he's just

28
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:00,550
an ordinary person.

29
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:03,010
He doesn't seem to be very shrewd.

30
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:04,210
He's still Japanese.

31
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,580
We have to be cautious.

32
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:06,780
I know.

33
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:08,670
I'll find a chance

34
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:10,030

36
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:15,110

about what you do.

38
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,030
Why don't you teach me first?

39
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:23,070
Teach me how to use a camera first.

40
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,430
Don't learn that.

41
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:26,510
Do you look down on me?

42
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:28,070
I don't want to get you involved.

43
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:30,130

46
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,230
I said no.

No, I'm not.

But Mr. Gu,

52
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:51,110
why do I often take

53
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:52,510
myself as Haimo?

54
00:03:53,829 --> 00:03:55,560
Am I confused?

55
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,670
I'm clearly not Haimo,

56
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:01,110
so why should I pretend to be?

57
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,770

58
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:07,270

378
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:22,030
when we've got the money.

379
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:26,510
Mr. Luo,

380
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:30,790
this is also Mr. Wang's idea.

381
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:35,750
I'm so torn.

382
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:39,700
Although I'm not a hero,

383
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:42,110
I keep

384
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:44,440
my word.

385
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:47,590
I can't

386
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:49,190
decide for the moment.

387
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:53,020
I still have 8,000 brothers who risked their lives with me.

388
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:54,910
I have to go back and discuss with them.

389
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:57,430
No hurry. Take your time.

390
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:01,990
You can bring up any conditions.

391
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:10,070
Bravo.

392
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:13,290
Commander Luo.

393
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:14,850
What's the matter?

394
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:16,770
Chairman Wang called,

395
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:19,070
asking you to go back to Nanjing immediately.

396
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:20,390
How about this?

397
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:22,130
I'll go check the guy in white.

398
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:22,990
You guys talk.

399
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:27,330
Mr. Luo, you seldom come here. Please stay for a few more days.

400
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:30,430
I'll rush to Nanjing now.

401
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:32,450
Once the thing is done,

402
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:34,270
I'll be right back.

403
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:38,390
I'll wait for you.

404
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:49,880
Commander Luo, please have a seat.

405
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,120
Did you tell him?

406
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:52,640
I've said it all.

407
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:54,870
He's a slick.

408
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:56,920
He rejected?

409
00:23:57,670 --> 00:23:58,550
No.

410
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:01,670
Nor did he agree.

411
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:07,150
The Japanese have also been watching him recently.

412
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:09,870
Iwaii has been going to his hotel frequently these days.

413
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:11,530
I wonder what they are up to.

414
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:14,030
Hold him. Wait for me to come back.

415
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:16,600
I'm determined

416
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:19,650
to take in those 8,000 people.

417
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:22,840
I think

418
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:26,990
all I need now is a diamond.

419
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:29,990
Last time

420
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:31,470
we saw a six-carat diamond

421
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,290
at the Jewish's,

422
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:34,830
but you didn't buy it.

423
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:35,690
I have no money.

424
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:39,550
Even if you have money now, it's useless.

425
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:40,450
I went back

426
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:41,510
and found that it'd been sold.

427
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:42,470
So fast?

428
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:44,100
See?

429
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:46,380
Suzhou is full of rich people.

430
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:48,030
Guess who took it?

431
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:49,500
Do I know him?

432
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:51,250
Commander Luo.

433
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:53,440
For whom?

434
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:55,510
I did ask!

435
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:59,970
He actually bought it for his governess.

436
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:01,470
Someone surnamed Lu.

437
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:03,150
That's strange.

438
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:05,110
I'm your wife,

439
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:06,420
and you didn't even buy it for me.

440
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:08,630
He bought it for his governess!

441
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:13,910
I'll buy you a seven-carat one later.

442
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:16,020
I don't believe you!

443
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:19,350

I saw a few sneaky people

00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:08,190
appearing in the lobby just now.

462
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:10,210

the more danger we'll be in.

00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:30,550

"Sank you."

493
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:19,390
I read in the newspaper that

494
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:21,950
Mr. Li came to Shanghai in person

495
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,010
to confer the rank.

497
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:30,670
have started to make a way out for themselves.

498
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:33,290
Let me tell you something.

499
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:37,550
Mr. Li wants an army of his own.

500
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:41,170
He wants our 33rd Independent Division.

501
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:43,910
He's willing to offer 30 million.

502
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:46,330
30 million? That's a lot of money.

503
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:47,950
That's half of the yearly fiscal revenue

504
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:49,730
of the whole Jiangsu Province.

505
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:51,170
In that case,

506
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:53,450
you'll have to really fight the New Fourth Army

507
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:55,310
and the Loyal and Righteous Army.

508
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:56,870
Eat first.

509
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,420
As a commander,

510
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:01,970
I'm not alone.

511
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:05,700
I have 8,000 people counting on me.

512
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,230
In order to survive,

513
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:08,950
you'll just lead them to be…

514
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:10,530
To be what?

515
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:18,160
Traitors.

516
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:25,070
When did I say

517
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:26,980
I'll take them to be traitors?

518
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:30,710

519
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:31,910

520
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:37,300
In 1939,

521
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:39,410
if I didn't take them in,

522
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,740
I wonder if these 8,000 people from Shaanxi and Gansu

523
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:44,860
can still be alive today.

524
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:47,200

525
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:51,190
have all fought hand-to-hand combat against the Japanese.

526
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:53,330
All of them are true heroes!

527
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:56,340
During the one year you've been our governess,

528
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:58,850
have you seen me fight against anyone?

529
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:00,310
But Mr. Li is here now.

530
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:00,980
The situation is different.

531
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:02,060
What Mr. Li?

532
00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:05,360
He just wants me to be a cannon fodder

533
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:08,030
and help him fight against the New Fourth Army.

534
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:12,140
What's the point

535
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:15,320
of the Chinese fighting against the Chinese?

536
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:22,770
Commander Luo.

537
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:26,630
I misunderstood you. I'm sorry.

538
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:29,770
In troubled times like these,

539
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,390
it's so rare to see a general like you.

540
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:34,230
You hold fast to your principles despite being surrounded

541
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:34,960
by traitors.

542
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:38,780
Ms. Lu,

543
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:45,530
I left my hometown when I was a kid and started my career as a soldier.

544
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:47,520
I was living in turmoil all my life.

545
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:51,200
I've never experienced the feeling of having a home.

546
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,580
Until one year ago,

547
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:54,590
I met you.

548
00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:56,320
In the year when you were

549
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:59,270
our governess in Changshu,

550
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,790
I really felt very warm inside.

551
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:06,110
You are so good.

552
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:09,510
My three children

553
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:11,160
also like you so much.

554
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:13,530
I like you, too.

555
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:15,860
-It's…
-I'm sorry.

556
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:16,910
-It's me who should apologize.

557
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:17,510
I'm sorry.

558
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:20,080
I really don't know

559
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:21,940
how to express my feelings.

560
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:27,920
Open it.

561
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:30,760
Open it.

562
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,210
Such a big diamond.

563
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:40,150
I wonder

564
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:41,500
who you're giving it to.

565
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:47,590
You.

566
00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:48,350
I can't accept this.

567
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:48,830
Take it.

568
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:51,670
I can't accept it. It's too expensive.

569
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:52,230
Take it.

570
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:55,430
I'm just a governess.

571
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:10,230
Take your time to eat.

572
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:12,830
I have a call from Nanjing to answer.

573
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:29,480
What does this mean?

574
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:31,630
Isn't it obvious?

575
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,080
What should we do now?

576
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:38,720
The most worrying thing happened anyway.

577
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:41,040
How about this?

578
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:42,630
You go to Junxia

579
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:44,110
to report what happened here.

580
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:45,270
Ask him to ask for instructions from the superiors

581
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:46,830
about our next move.

582
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:49,580
Personally, I want to get out of it as soon as possible.

583
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:50,350
Get out?

584
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:52,700
Then, our mission…

585
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:55,390
Our efforts will be in vain.

586
00:32:57,590 --> 00:32:59,080
Comrade Wang Mingzhong

587
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:01,190
sent us to be undercover in Luo Wuqiang's place

588
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:02,260
to let us keep track of

589
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:04,190
the movements of the 33rd Division

590
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:06,670
and find a chance to turn Luo Wuqiang to our side.

591
00:33:06,670 --> 00:33:09,130
But after spending more than a year with him,

592
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:11,030
I found Commander Luo

593
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:12,430
a truly loyal man.

594
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:15,150
Although he comes from a military background,

595
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:17,850
he is exceptionally perceptive and attentive.

596
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:20,880
So, that's why I become more and more worried.

597
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:23,870
We're already

598
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:25,310
very passive now.

599
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:27,260
We can't let things go on like this.

600
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:28,750
Don't worry.

601
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:31,510
I'll report to the organization immediately.

[Li's Roasted Snacks]

604
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:55,930
Yizhong, it's me.

605
00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:57,300
Junxia?

606
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:00,080
Come with me.

607
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:03,060
Yizhong.

608
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:04,170
It's been more than a year.

609
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:05,430
Many things happened.

610
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,610
I've always wanted to contact you.

611
00:34:08,889 --> 00:34:10,070
What are you doing in Suzhou?

612
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:11,000
I came to Suzhou…

613
00:34:12,989 --> 00:34:14,659
I can't tell you, Yizhong.

614
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:15,909
Although I don't know

615
00:34:15,909 --> 00:34:17,239
your real identity,

616
00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:18,429
but I can guess.

617
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:21,030
To be honest,

618
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:22,230
I contacted

619
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:23,139
the Jiangsu Provincial Committee before I came,

620
00:34:23,139 --> 00:34:24,540
but they have evacuated.

621
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:26,889
Mr. Huang also sacrificed.

622
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:28,909
Yizhong.

623
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:32,239
I wanted to establish contact with you.

624
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:33,190
Our operation in Suzhou

625
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:34,550
needs your support, Yizhong.

626
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:35,429
Trust me.

627
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:41,380
Junxia, don't you read poems?

628
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:42,830
Poems?

629
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:44,590
What poem?

630
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:49,850
Yizhong, is that a secret code?

631
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:52,070
Goodbye, Junxia.

632
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:53,310
Wait.

633

Yizhong.

634
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:57,630
Ruotong is here, too.

00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:58,560
She came with me.

636
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:00,430
I took the risk to contact you today

637
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:01,670
because our Suzhou mission

638
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:03,000
really needs your help.

639
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,310

can you help me find out

the most popular dishes in Suzhou?

00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:02,350
I'll treat Commander Luo to dinner.

[Welcome]

656
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:22,720
Zhou Zhifei is inviting us to a dinner?

657
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:24,810
Why is he doing that

658
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,280
[Invitation]

659
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:26,380
all of a sudden?

660
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:29,800
What does he want to find out about you?

661
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:30,900
Does he have a stick

662
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:31,880
to beat you with?

663
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,470
I'd better not go.

664
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:40,530
That old spy, Zhou Zhifei.

665
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:43,110
Every time I meet him, I get incredibly nervous.

666
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:44,570
I'd prefer to see him less.

667
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:47,950
I don't want to cause you trouble.

668
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:50,110
He specifically named us to go.

669
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,190
If you don't go,

670
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:54,590
it will make us seem like we feel guilty.

671
00:36:54,590 --> 00:36:56,230
Can't you just say I'm sick?

672
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:58,710
Don't worry.

673
00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:00,930
Maybe it's just a casual meal.

674
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:02,830
He might have no intentions.

675
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:05,100
He has no intentions

676
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:07,490
but specifically asked us to go together.

677
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:08,830
Is that possible?

678
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:18,650
Alright, I'll go with you.

679
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,880
Vice Director Gu seldom socialize.

680
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,190
It's so rare that he escorts people.

681
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:23,510
If his wife doesn't even show up,

682
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:24,550
that'll be inappropriate.

687
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:35,000
But you have to teach me how to deal with it.

688
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:36,280
I rarely attend

689
00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:37,370
such large events.

690
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,220
I don't want to make any mistakes

691
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:41,560
and cause you trouble.

692
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:42,920
What can I teach you?

693
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:45,930
The more I teach you, the more nervous you'll be.

694
00:37:52,830 --> 00:37:53,880
Look.

695
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:56,030
How can you not expose yourself this way?

696
00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:57,670
No couple is acting like us.

697
00:37:57,950 --> 00:37:58,700
No…

698
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:01,630
You made such a sudden move, giving me a start.

Gu Yizhong.

700
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,150
In my view, you're really lousy

701
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:06,390
at being an agent.

702
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,470
Zhou Zhifei must have been blind

703
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:10,070
to let you hide for two years.

704
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:12,530
I guess I might as well skip the dinner

705
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:14,570
lest I lose my life

706
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,280
if something goes wrong.

707
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,330
Is this okay?

708
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:38,200
Do you have to go?

709
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:42,500
Zhou Zhifei sent an invitation.

710
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:44,730
[To Commander Luo Wuqiang and Miss Lu Junnuo]

711
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:44,630
He especially asked someone to call me

712
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:46,180
to tell me to attend it.

713
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:49,790
Could this be a conspiracy of No. 90?

714
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:51,920
I have to go, even if it's a conspiracy.

715
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:54,710
Zhou Zhifei is always paranoid.

716
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:56,550
I'll appear suspicious if I don't go.

717
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:57,910
And I think this is a good opportunity

718
00:38:57,910 --> 00:39:00,370
to learn more about Luo Wuqiang's position.

719
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:08,040
Are the agents still there?

720
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:10,470
Two teams take turns monitoring the hotel lobby

721
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:11,910
and the street ahead.

722
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:12,580
Also,

723
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:15,390
two batches of Japanese military police came today.

724
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:17,920
They're all here to keep an eye on Luo Wuqiang.

725
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:19,350
Or to watch me.

726
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:22,230
What if Zhou Zhifei

727
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:24,150
recognizes you at the dinner table?

728
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:26,050
I've never met him head-on.

729
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:28,660
Don't worry.

730
00:39:28,790 --> 00:39:29,820
Now, I am

733
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:39,190
I'll be with you. Don't be afraid.

734
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:47,670
Yizhong.

735
00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:48,910
Director Zhou.

736
00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:49,910
Welcome.

737
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:50,950
I didn't expect

738
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:52,390
you would have such a nice place hidden from the world.

739
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:53,150
It's so beautiful.

740
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:54,830
No, it's not my place.

741
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:56,280
It's my friend's house.

742
00:39:56,910 --> 00:39:59,790
Haimo, your earrings are pretty.

743
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:00,920
Is it a new design?

744
00:40:01,310 --> 00:40:02,750
Ma'am, it's not new.

745
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,550
It was a birthday present

746
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:05,870
from Yizhong last year.

747
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:07,840
Zhou, did you hear that?

748
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:09,670
My birthday is coming.

749
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:10,910
Don't you celebrate your birthday every day?

750
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:12,640
Don't you buy things every day?

751
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:14,550
It's not the same if I buy it myself.

752
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:15,630
Commander Luo is here!

753
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:17,330
Zhou, Commander Luo is here.

754
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:18,570
Excuse me.

755
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:19,710
Sorry, sorry.

756
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:20,920
-Commander Luo.
-We're late.

757
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,780
Welcome.

758
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:24,670
Let me introduce you.

759
00:40:24,830 --> 00:40:25,430
This is

760
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:26,990
Commander Luo, whom I often mentioned to you.

761
00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:28,630
This is my wife, Ji Yuqing.

762
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:29,750
Hello, Commander Luo.

763
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:30,750
Hello, Mrs. Zhou.

764
00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:32,010
This is Miss Lu.

765
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:33,440
Are you feeling better?

766
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:35,750
Much better. Thank you for your concern.

767
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:36,350
By the way,

768
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:38,470
I brought some local specialties from Changshu.

769
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:40,070
I've handed them to your men.

770
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:40,600
You're so nice.

771
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:41,980
That's so nice of you. It's good that you're here.

772
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:42,510
Please come in.

773
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:44,240
Yizhong, let me introduce you.

774
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:45,830
This is

775
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:47,710
Commander Luo, whom I always mentioned to you.

776
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:49,610
This is our Vice Director of No. 90,

777
00:40:49,610 --> 00:40:50,340
Gu Yizhong.

778
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,990
His governess, Miss Lu.

779
00:40:56,910 --> 00:40:57,790
Lu Junnuo.

780
00:40:58,050 --> 00:41:00,060
The governess of my three children.

781
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:01,630
She's my tutor, too.

782
00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:06,730
This is Mr. Gu Yizhong's wife,

783
00:41:07,470 --> 00:41:08,400
Zhang Haimo.

784
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:14,870
Zhou.

785
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:17,470
Do we still have to stand here and talk?

786
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:17,990
It's my fault.

787
00:41:17,990 --> 00:41:18,850
Please come in.

788
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:19,620
Please come in.

789
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:20,110
Come in.

790
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:20,710
Come on, Yizhong.

791
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:22,350
-Let's talk while eating.
-Let's go.

792
00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:24,070
Everyone, today,

793
00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:25,430
it's a great honor

794
00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:27,040
for us to be able to

795
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:28,840
invite Commander Luo here.

796
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:30,310
Mr. Li has told me

797
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:32,720
that we'll do anything for you

798
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:34,920
if you need anything in Suzhou.

799
00:41:35,110 --> 00:41:35,750
Welcome.

800
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:36,550
Thank you.

801
00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:37,510
Thank you.

802
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:38,590
Help yourself.

803
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:39,310
Here.

804
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:43,020
Sit.

805
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,290
Yizhong, you're young and promising.

806
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:49,400
I've heard a lot about you

807
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,360
since I came to Suzhou.

808
00:41:53,270 --> 00:41:54,220
I'm flattered.

809
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:57,660
Actually, there's some other connection between us.

810
00:41:58,070 --> 00:41:58,990
Oh? What is it?

811
00:41:59,290 --> 00:42:01,720
I went to Huangpu before.

812
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,240
I wasn't there very long,

813
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:07,050
but I'm lucky enough

814
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,320
to learn from Master Gu.

815
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:13,280
Mr. Xixing was a loyal and upright man.

816
00:42:13,870 --> 00:42:16,290
He was one of the Four Talents of Huangpu.

817
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:18,670
Master Gu led his troops to the north,

818
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:20,910
fighting from Shaoguan all the way to Jinan.

819
00:42:20,910 --> 00:42:22,400
He had achieved remarkable military achievements.

820
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,480
He was also a role model for us.

821
00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:26,270
What a pity.
