if you're on a mission

11

12

I'll have to tell him that face-to-face.

13

15
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:33,710

16

00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:35,510
And what?

19
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:38,670
No, no.

20

He's not afraid of that.

21
00:02:39,829 --> 00:02:41,420
But we brothers,

22
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:42,930
we're worried about that.

23

28

29
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:55,950

Zhifei has long said

that Guo Jingji was killed by you people.

40
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:12,030

41

64

00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:02,880
Can you carry out the mission?

565
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:06,430
I promise to complete the task

566
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:08,560
of capturing the traitor, Gu Yizhong.

567
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,320
Where are you going?

568
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,240
Pass this to me.

569
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:23,800
Okay.

570
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:28,520
Are you going to find the person in the photo, right?

571
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:30,980
What person in the photo?

572
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:32,300
Who are you?

573
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:33,910
I've never seen a relative

574
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:35,270
like you at home.

575
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:38,110
And you said there was no such story

576
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:40,270
about a hero and a beauty in songs.

577
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:44,760
What a well-played scene from The Romance of the Western Chamber.

578
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:48,060
What are you doing?

579
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:49,380
What?

580
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:50,550
Young Master,

581
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:52,160
I can never let you go

582
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,340
without the Master’s approval.

583
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:55,350
Well,

584
00:32:57,230 --> 00:32:58,340
who are you?

585
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,360
Me?

586
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:02,370
I'm Haimo's cousin-in-law,

587
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:04,590
so, of course, I am your cousin-in-law.

588
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:05,790
What cousin-in-law?

589
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:07,940
Young Master.

590
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:10,470
Do you really not know,

591
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:11,730
or are you just pretending?

592
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:13,790
Your marriage to our Haimo

593
00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:16,210
was arranged by your father a few years ago.

594
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:17,310
Don't even think about denying it!

595
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:19,370
What marriage? Don't talk nonsense!

596
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:21,600
Keep pretending.

597
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,530
You are really good at pretending.

598
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:25,040
Although there is a

599
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:26,630
New Culture Movement now,

600
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:29,630
the saying "first come, first served" still holds true.

601
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:30,510
Our Haimo

602
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:31,970
came earlier

603
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:33,550
-than Xiao, that student girl.
-Enough.

604
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:35,270
Talk less before getting married.

605
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:37,930
Or Mrs. Wang will talk about it behind our backs.

606
00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:40,690
What are you doing?

607
00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:42,000
This is his stuff.

608
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:43,670
It's mine now!

609
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,800
No, come back and tell me!

610
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:51,610
What marriage?

611
00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:52,530
Stop shouting!

612
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,010
Zemin,

613
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:00,750
what you just said

614
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:02,190
is really hard for me.

615
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:04,310
I won't make things difficult for you.

616
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:05,890
It's just a matter of your word

617
00:34:05,890 --> 00:34:07,850
to release someone from No. 90.

618
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:10,150
Mr. Liu from the clothing store

619
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:11,260
is not a stranger.

620
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:14,270
He's the brother-in-law of my third concubine's cousin.

621
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:15,530
We're relatives.

622
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,750
So I really can't refuse them.

623
00:34:22,989 --> 00:34:23,909
Their family

624
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:25,909
would offer ten gold bars

625
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:28,770
for the brothers at the station to have some tea.

626
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:33,630
The Japanese

627
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:35,520
are in charge of No. 90.

628
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:36,980
Zhifei,

629
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:38,620
everyone in Suzhou knows

630
00:34:38,949 --> 00:34:41,199
that you single-handedly established No. 90.

631
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:43,030
You're the one who holds the fort.

632
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:45,030
Don't say that in public.

633
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:46,290
People could die for saying that.

634
00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:47,750
Even if it's not said aloud,

635
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:48,810
everyone in Suzhou

636
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:50,670
knows it in their hearts.

637
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:56,350
Zhifei,

638
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:58,330
please take a look at this.

639
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:01,460
This is a treasure that's been in the Liu family for three generations.

640
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:02,280
It is said

641
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:03,960
that it was from the palace.

642
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:05,800
Definitely a treasure.

643
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,790
A small gift for your wife.

644
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:11,290
Zemin,

645
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,440
thank you.

646
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,580
What's that man's name again?

647
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:16,480
Liu Guangda.

648
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:19,530
Okay.

Sorry, sorry.

Something came up at the station. I'm late.

652
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:27,600
Well, Chairman Wang.

653
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:30,170
I'm sorry. I'll drink one cup as punishment.

654
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:31,560
Cheers.

Jinhai,

656
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:38,670
is there a prisoner named...

657
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:40,030
What's his name again?

658
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:40,920
Liu Guangda.

659
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:41,790
Is there?

660
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:42,330
Yes.

661
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:43,830
What did he do?

662
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:47,590
Engaging in the sale of illegally smuggled cloth
colluding with the Communist Party, and trafficking drugs.

663
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:48,590
Is there any murder involved?

664
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:49,310
No.

665
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:52,590
Seems that he's hurt two or three of his neighbors.

666
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:55,750
Do the Japanese know about this?

667
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:56,830
Yes.

668
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:59,840
How many people in the station know it?

669
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:01,390
Both people from the Operations and Interrogation Departments

670
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:02,590
should know about it.

00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:04,240

672
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,850
for your brothers to have some tea.

673

Release him.

674
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:11,010
Write in the file

675
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:12,670
that there were no witnesses or physical evidence found

676
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:13,750
after a thorough inspection.

677
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:14,480
Understood.

678
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,090

After I met you,

710
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:23,750
I never thought of marrying anyone but you.

00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:28,000
I hereby formally propose to you.

712
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:29,150

How is it going over there?

721
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:52,070
The target has been in Gu's Garden

722
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:52,960
and has never left.

723
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,430
Gu seems to be under house arrest

00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:56,990
How's the situation around Gu's Garden?

726
00:38:56,990 --> 00:38:59,190
A newspaper stand has recently been set up

727
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:01,390
in front of Gu's Garden, near the corner of Nanshizi Street.

728
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:02,710
They look like agents from No. 90.

729
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:04,450
I think they're protecting Gu.

730
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:05,110
Also,

731
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:06,950

00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:16,910
was a division commander of the Kuomintang

737
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:18,770

once the commander of his special duty company,

742
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:28,230
were all his soldiers back then.

00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:29,910
Not only do they know how to use guns,

744
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:30,950
but I also heard that there are many arms

745
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:32,210
stored in Gu's Garden.

746
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:33,880
They are well-guarded.

go back and tell them

00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:41,430

00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:43,690
Jinhai is here.

752
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:45,090
Hello. Yuqing.

753
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,240
It's good that you're here.

754
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,590
Have a look at our Youfei.

755
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:49,650
Does he look sharp dressed like this?

756
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:50,590
Yes.

757
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:51,990
Let your dad see you.

758
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:56,920
I made him four sets of clothes for summer,

759
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:59,520
two sets for autumn, and three sets for winter.

760
00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:01,290
But Zhou,

761
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:04,190
they all say that Kyoto is freezing in the winter.

762
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:06,030
Should we make a mink coat for him?

763
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:06,630
No need.

764
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:09,150
Just make him a tweed coat.

765
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:11,470
In Japan,

766
00:40:11,470 --> 00:40:15,200
elementary school students can't wear more clothes in the winter.

767
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:17,270
Zhifei, Yuqing,

768
00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:19,560
when is Youfei setting off?

769
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:20,590
Next week.

770
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:25,350
Jinhai,

771
00:40:25,350 --> 00:40:26,030
no, no.

772
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:27,640
Don't take it.

773
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:28,750
Come on, thank Uncle Jinhai.

774
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:29,830
Thank you, Uncle Jinhai.

775
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:32,090
This is a little gift from Xiaolan and me.

776
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:33,310
This is to wish Youfei

777
00:40:34,790 --> 00:40:35,840
a safe trip.

778
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:37,340
On Sunday,

779
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:39,310
let's have dinner at the Pine and Crane Restaurant.

780
00:40:39,310 --> 00:40:40,080
Jinhai,

781
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:41,420
you have to come.

782
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:41,990
I will.

783
00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:43,430
Take Xiaolan with you as well.

784
00:40:43,430 --> 00:40:44,230
Okay, Zhifei.

785
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:45,710
Zhiei, Yuqing,

786
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:46,590
I'm leaving.

787
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:50,950
[Congratulations]

788
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:53,910
Mom, all you know is money.

789
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,660
Don't be like your mother.

790
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:00,280
Sir and Madam.

791
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,070
Mr. Lin from Fuwen Photo Studio

792
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:03,100
called,

793
00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:04,890
saying that Gang would

794
00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:07,110
come to take photos at 10 a.m. the next day.

795
00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:08,910
I didn't ask him to come here to take photos.

796
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:09,710
I did.

797
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:12,490
I thought

798
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:14,270
we should take a family photo

799
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:16,550
before Youfei leaves for Japan.

800
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,850
OK. Cheer up!

801
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:30,110
Good!

802
00:41:30,790 --> 00:41:32,010
Come on, son.

803
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:32,680
Let's go.

804
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:34,000
Youfei.

805
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:35,070
Come.

806
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:36,950
I want to say something to our son.

807
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:37,310
Okay.

808
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:42,610
Do you remember our family pedigree?

809
00:41:44,010 --> 00:41:44,940
Recite it again.

810
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:47,430
My ancestors lived for generations on Guo Mountain, Yixing.

811
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:48,590
The first ancestor to move

812
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:50,060
was born during the Hongwu Period of the Ming Dynasty

813
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:51,350
and died during the Chenghua Period.

814
00:41:51,350 --> 00:41:52,470
Because of the Jingnan Military Coup,

815
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:54,010
he moved to Dongyangtang.

816
00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:56,590
The later generations were divided into four branches: Li, Yi, Ren, and Zhi.

817
00:41:56,590 --> 00:41:59,190
Zhou Renke, from the Ren branch, begat my great-grandfather, Zhou Qiushan.

818
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:01,750
Zhou Qiushan begat my great-grandfather, Zhou Bingcai.

819
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:03,230
Zhou Bingcai moved to Chengxia

820
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:04,550
and begat my father, Zhou Zhifei.

821
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:06,270
Zhou Zhifei begat me, Zhou Youfei.

822
00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:07,370
I, Zhou Youfei,

823
00:42:07,470 --> 00:42:11,800
am the 11th generation of the Zhou family from Guo Mountain, Yixing, Jiangsu.

824
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:17,910
Sir,

825
00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:19,550
as per your order,

826
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:20,870
every other day,

827
00:42:20,870 --> 00:42:22,470
I'll publish a tidbit in the Jiangsu Daily

828
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:24,590
stating that Gu Xixing will assume

829
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:25,950
the position of magistrate of Wu County.

830
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:26,950
But he

831
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:28,590
is quite calm.

832
00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:30,680
He neither admits

833
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:32,310
nor states that it's a rumor.

834
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:36,000
Someone even splashed dung at Gu's Garden.

835
00:42:36,030 --> 00:42:38,510
He has always regarded himself as a distinguished gentleman in Suzhou.

836
00:42:38,510 --> 00:42:39,340
Let's see

837
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:40,670
how long he can hold on.

838
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:44,180
The Gus are between a rock and a hard place.

839
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:47,090
Of course, they're having a difficult time.

840
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:50,220
I'm afraid they'll run away.

841
00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:51,990
But, sir, don't worry.

842
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:53,470
I've sent more men

843
00:42:53,590 --> 00:42:55,660
to keep an eye on Gu's Garden's front door and back door.

844
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:58,000
Gu Yizhong couldn't escape, even if he grew a pair of wings.

845
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,670
Tell your men to leave there first.

846
00:43:00,790 --> 00:43:01,600
Leave?

847
00:43:01,830 --> 00:43:02,750
Be prepared.

848
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:04,670
If the communists break into Gu's Garden,

849
00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:06,250
let them fight first.

850
00:43:08,110 --> 00:43:08,950
Understood.

851
00:43:10,550 --> 00:43:14,350
The deeper the conflict between the Gu family and the Communist Party grows,

852
00:43:14,350 --> 00:43:15,950
in the end,

853
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:17,910
Gu Xixing will have no choice but

854
00:43:17,910 --> 00:43:18,830
to become the Magistrate of Wu County.
