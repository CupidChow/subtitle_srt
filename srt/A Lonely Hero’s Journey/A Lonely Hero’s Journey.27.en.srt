Yes, sushi.

Mr. Ono, do you also enjoy ballads?

27
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:51,900
I'm quite fond of it.

28
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:53,570
I studied it briefly about ten years ago

29
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:55,370
in Shanghai, though I must admit

30
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:57,540
my skills are rather poor.

31
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,670
Which school did you study?

32
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:00,350
Yu tune.

33
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:03,220
You studied Yu tune as well?

34
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:04,350
Yes.

35
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:07,510
That's why when I heard you singing and playing,

36
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:09,010
it felt particularly familiar.

37
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:11,770
But your rendition of the Yu tone is somewhat unique

38
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:13,030
—though it is Yu style,

39
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:17,060
it carries a certain intensity

40
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,030
that is not typical.

41
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,990

49
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:10,660

00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:00,990
No, no,

192
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:03,270
you're the most suitable for this role.

193
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:04,030
As for me,

194
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:06,510
I've not been feeling well lately.

195
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:08,690
My old back pain has flared up,

196
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,560
and my blood pressure is high.

197
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,670
My wife has found me a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner,

198
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:14,670
so I need to rest and recover at home.

199
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:16,360
So, you'll need to handle

200
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,380
most of the responsibilities at No. 90.

201
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:19,390
Don't worry about it.

202
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:20,350
When you're teaching the students,

203
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:22,010
just pass on all the knowledge

204
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:24,150
I've taught you

205
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:26,260
in the past.

206
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:28,610
That should be sufficient, right?

207
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:30,880
Oh, that reminds me.

208
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:33,080
Today, they brought me some chocolate

209
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,610
from Shanghai.

210
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,900
This isn't just any chocolate

211
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:40,620
—it's Meiji chocolate from Japan.

212
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:45,110
Mr. Li only received four pieces in total,

213
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:46,750
kept two for himself,

214
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:48,190
and gave me the other two.

215
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:49,250
I've had it before;

216
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:50,550
it tastes excellent.

217
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:52,000
I'm giving one to you.

218
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,510
No, no.

219
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:53,020
Take it.

220
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,230
I couldn't possibly...

221
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:54,820
Try it.

222
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:57,770
Well, thank you, Director.

223
00:11:57,770 --> 00:11:58,570
It's nothing.

224
00:11:58,990 --> 00:11:59,760
Yizhong,

225
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:02,440
when you're teaching the students,

226
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:05,350
if you encounter any gaps in your knowledge,

227
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,610
don't hesitate to ask.

228
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:08,230
I'll help you out without holding anything back.

229
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:09,910
I really appreciate that, Director.

230
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:10,910
It's the least I can do.

231
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:11,710
I hope

232
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,030
you'll consider being a guest lecturer

233
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:15,150
for the group in the future.

234
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:16,630
Sure, of course.

235
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:17,870
Okay.

236
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:20,640
Eat these Suzhou snacks

237
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:22,000
when you're on the ship.

238
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:24,030
Don't wait until you get to Japan.

239
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:25,190
They may spoil by then.

240
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:25,830
Got it.

241
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:28,150
There's medicine inside, you know that, right?

242
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:29,230
If you get an upset stomach,

243
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:31,020
you can take it.

244
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:33,510
This suitcase is too empty.

245
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:34,780
Let's put more in.

246
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:37,890
We've packed all the clothes he needs.

247
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:40,190
The mink fur coat is here.

248
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:42,680
When it gets cold, remember to wear it.

249
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:46,150
Here, pack this kimono too.

250
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:46,990
Why?

251
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:48,870
Don't you dislike him wearing a kimono?

252
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:50,670
It's not appropriate for him to wear it in China.

253
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:52,080
But in Japan, it's different.

254
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,080
Wear it every day.

255
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:54,830
It will make the Japanese

256
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:56,190
lower their guard.

257
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:57,080
I see.

258
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:59,130
Stop lecturing our son like this.

259
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:01,320
You've been an agent for half your life,

260
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,980
and now you want him to follow in your footsteps?

261
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:04,830
Dear,

262
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:07,230
don't write coded letters anymore.

263
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:08,510
If you're feeling wronged or have any issues,

264
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:09,950
just send a telegram home.

265
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:11,670
Say what you need to in the telegram.

266
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:13,080
Let's see what those little Japanese devils

267
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:13,990
can do to you.

268
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:14,910
And this.

269
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:17,310
Take these two books.

270
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:18,560
It's full.

271
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:19,720
There's still room.

272
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:21,490
I'll put it right here,

273
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:22,810
under this box.

274
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:25,430
Mr. Zhou, Section Chief Xie is here.

275
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:28,720
Tell him to wait for me in the study.

276
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:32,760
Wenchao,

277
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:35,650
I have two photos here.

278
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:37,310
Can you help me

279
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:38,670
spot any anomalies?

280
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:48,230
The backs of the people in these two photos

281
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:49,230
look very similar.

282
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:49,790
Yes.

283
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:52,930
First,

284
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,710
these two people should be the same person.

285
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:57,070
Second,

286
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:58,170
I suspect

287
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,640
he's the one Gu Yizhong

288
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:02,670
has met with twice recently.

289
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:07,060
This time, they slipped up.

290
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:09,120
So, I need you to return to Shanghai

291
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:11,150
and secretly investigate who he is.

292
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:11,890
No problem.

293
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:13,150
But, Sir,

294
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:15,070
it's a bit difficult to tell

295
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:17,010
based only on these two backs.

296
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,110
Look closer.

297
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:39,260
The Hwa Hsia?

298
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:40,550
Smart.

299
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:42,960
[The Hwa Hsia]

300
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:50,110
The Hwa Hsia magazine?

301
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:50,630
Yes.

302
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:52,810
I suspect

303
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,030
the person in these photos

304
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:55,890
works at the Hwa Hsia news agency.

305
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:57,910
When you get to Shanghai,

306
00:14:58,550 --> 00:14:59,750
you must investigate

307
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:02,410
every person in that news agency.

308
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:04,050
Turn to the last page

309
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,360
—it's the list

310
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:06,670
of all their editorial staff.

311
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:07,210
[East Asia Association]

312
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:09,190
You must screen

313
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:10,750
every single one of them.

314
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:12,180
Also,

315
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:14,080
during the investigation,

316
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:15,560
only use our own people.

317
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,720
Don't involve the ones from No. 76.

318
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,670
I suspect

319
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:21,560
No. 76 has been infiltrated.

320
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:23,850
It might be related to Wan Lilang.

321
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:26,430
Mr. Li has been secretly investigating him lately as well.

322
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:28,690
Leave it to me, Sir. You can rest assured.

323
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:32,640
Based on the Communist Party's usual habits,

324
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:35,790
this person Gu Yizhong is in contact with

325
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,420
is likely his superior.

326
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:40,500
If he can work at the news agency,

327
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:42,510
he must be well-educated,

328
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:45,110
which means his rank within the Party

329
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,530
might be high.

330
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:48,490
We must...

331
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,400
Understood, Sir.

332
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,740
What's the latest

333
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,090
from No. 76 in Shanghai?

334
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:58,490
I was just about to report to you.

335
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:00,850
A few days ago, I had dinner

336
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,120
with some old acquaintances in the army.

337
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,040
They mentioned that

338
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,080
the Japanese are planning a major operation in Suzhou,

339
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,400
something called the Wu Plan.

340
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:09,590
Do we know what the plan entails?

341
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:11,370
Not yet.

342
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:14,080
Alright, keep a close watch on it.

343
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:14,910
Okay.

344
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:16,910
Wenchao,

345
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:20,030
I heard your grandfather's health

346
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:21,710
has been poor lately.

347
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:24,060
Yes, Sir.

348
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:26,520
His abdominal swelling has gotten quite severe.

349
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,900
I've been stationed at the Shanghai Headquarters

350
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:31,900
for half a year and haven't had the chance to visit him.

351
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:33,370
Here's what we'll do.

352
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:35,850
This time, go see your grandfather first

353
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:38,400
before you visit the news agency.

354
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:40,400
I heard from Jinhai

355
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,240
that you were brought up by your grandpa.

356
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,340
Yes, Sir.

357
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:45,470
Here's a small token from me.

358
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:47,710
Buy some ginseng for your grandfather.

359
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:50,320
Sir, I can't accept this.

360
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,110
Take it.

361
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,540
Thank you. Sir.

362
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:01,510
I'll return to Shanghai tomorrow.

363
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:02,770
Gu Yizhong's superior

364
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:04,020
won't escape.

365
00:17:04,109 --> 00:17:04,670
Good.

366
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:16,670
Haimo.

367
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:19,230
Is that vase still in the front hall?

368
00:17:19,349 --> 00:17:20,240
You forgot?

369
00:17:20,609 --> 00:17:22,390
We pawned it last year

370
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:24,329
to pay off a debt in Shanghai.

371
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:26,829
I forgot.

372
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:31,870
Why? Do we need money again?

373
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:33,590
No.

374
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:36,610
I just received a letter from Zheng in Lizhuang.

375
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,230
He said that Mr. Liang and Miss Lin

376
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:40,080
are living in difficult circumstances.

377
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,710
Miss Lin's tuberculosis has flared up,\

378
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:43,710
and she doesn't even have money for medicine.

379
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:45,790
I was thinking of raising some money

380
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:47,450
to send them for emergencies.

381
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:51,790
In the past few years,

382
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:53,720
we've pawned everything we could.

383
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,620
How could you keep doing this—

384
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:57,790
constantly giving money

385
00:17:57,790 --> 00:17:59,720
to those agents and thugs at No. 90?

386
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:09,110
How about we pawn this bronze tripod?

387
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:10,360
What do you think?

388
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,840
Isn't this the family heirloom passed down from your ancestors?

389
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,430
Your father treasured it.

390
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:18,610
It shouldn't be pawned.

391
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:19,670
We can just redeem it

392
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:21,430
when we have money again, right?

393
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:22,630
You always say that.

394
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,870
But when will we ever redeem it?

395
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:25,770
Remember,

396
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:27,990
don't go to the pawnshop on Guanqian Street.

397
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:28,760
I know.

398
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:31,130
That shop is run by the Japanese.

399
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:32,870
We can't let them

400
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:34,190
have our Chinese treasures.

401
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:36,150
I'll go to the one run by Wang Zemin.

402
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:38,770
Let them know that the Gu family is struggling.

403
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,150
We don't seem like the kind of family

404
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:42,350
that takes subsidies from the outside.

405
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:48,030
Bow.

406
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:50,580
Bye.

407
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:51,770
Up.

408
00:18:57,930 --> 00:18:58,780
Turn left.

409
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:01,310
Get in.

410
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:03,660
Remember to write to us.

411
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:05,510
Take care of yourself.

412
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:06,590
Bye.

413
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:22,010
Take care.

414
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:24,050
Remember to write back.

415
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:46,510
Yizhong.

416
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:47,940
Give it to me.

417
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:57,030
Thank you.

418
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,430
Goodbye.

419
00:19:58,630 --> 00:19:59,880
Have a cup of tea before you go.

420
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,450
No need.

421
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,780
Was that Ono?

422
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:16,860
He said he was a businessman,

423
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:19,630
but he also has dealings with Japanese military officers.

424
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:21,670
That was a car from the Japanese Army Headquarters.

425
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:23,380
He must be an agent.

426
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,500
Not necessarily.

427
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,420
Since 1937,

428
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:27,840
I haven't seen

429
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,410
any Japanese

430
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,840
who would bow to Chinese.

431
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:34,530
That just means this agent is particularly experienced.

432
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:37,910
He sent us sushi.

433
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:38,750
You should

434
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:39,980
prepare some pastries

435
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:41,380
to send to them in return.

436
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,330
Are you asking me to act as a spy in their house?

437
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:58,150
Editor Huang, here's the new issue of the sample magazine.

438
00:20:58,150 --> 00:20:59,650
Okay, Li, just leave it here.

439
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:00,220
Okay.

440
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:11,510
[The Hwa Hsia]

441
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:22,110
Hurry.

442
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,600
Haimo!

443
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:01,280
Haimo!

444
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:02,700
What's wrong?

445
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:05,110
This...

446
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:07,800
Why is the bronze tripod still here?

447
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,470
I managed to scrape together some money,

448
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:10,530
so I didn't sell it.

449
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:13,630
Wait a minute,

450
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:16,480
where did you get the money?

451
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,740
Where's the bracelet?

452
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:24,930
I pawned it.

453
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,350
Haimo...

454
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:30,660
Don't look at me like that.

455
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:31,810
I did it willingly.

456
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:34,870
I need to shower Junsheng.

457
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:35,730
I'll be off now.

458
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:53,350
The manager Gu

459
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:55,550
from Daimaru Department Store called.

460
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:57,150
They've just received a new batch of Western-style dresses.

461
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:59,030
The designs are quite similar to those from Paris.

462
00:22:59,030 --> 00:22:59,580
Mrs. Gu,

463
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:02,310
how about we go shopping together tomorrow?

464
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:03,920
Mrs. Zhou, I wouldn't dare.

465
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:05,830
With Yizhong's salary,

466
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,560
we can't afford such things.

467
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:09,150
Mrs. Gu,

468
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:11,010
the Gu family's wealth

469
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:13,180
is well-known in Suzhou.

470
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,910
It's said that you own hundreds of acres

471
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:17,840
of paddy fields in Dongshan alone.

472
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:21,240
Mr. Wang, you have no idea.

473
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:24,010
Yizhong's father donated all of that

474
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:25,780
to the girls' school years ago.

475
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:28,400
Gu's Garden

476
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,900
is just an empty shell now.

477
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,060
If we keep going like this,

478
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:34,230
I'll have to start storytelling again.

479
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:35,230
That won't do!

480
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:37,910
If you have any difficulties, just tell me.

481
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:39,320
I have some spare money.

482
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:40,650
I can lend it to you.

483
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:43,510
Outside, the interest rate is 1.5%,

484
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,540
but for you,

485
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:46,200
I'll only charge 1%.

486
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:47,740
Thank you, Mrs. Zhou.

487
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:51,450
Haimo.

488
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:53,770
Why don't you two have a child?

489
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:55,580
Yes.

490
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:58,400
You've been married for two years,

491
00:23:58,710 --> 00:23:59,640
and nothing yet.

492
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:02,560
By the look

493
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:05,090
of your figure,

494
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:07,490
it doesn't seem like you can't conceive.

495
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:10,990
Could it be that Mr. Gu isn't capable?

496
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:13,110
No way.

497
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:16,710
Do you want me

498
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:19,190
to introduce you to a Western doctor

499
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:20,670
from Japan?

500
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:25,390
He's a classmate of mine from when I studied in Kyoto.

501
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:27,690
He treated President Chen's wife.

502
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:28,910
I guarantee

503
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:31,540
you'll be holding a chubby baby boy next year.

504
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:33,360
Yizhong and I

505
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:36,500
are just letting nature take its course.

506
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:38,840
Mrs. Zhou,

507
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:41,060
I really can't go tomorrow.

508
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:42,430
Why don't you have the Director

509
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:44,360
accompany you to Daimaru instead?

510
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:46,590
Him, accompany me shopping?

511
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:48,170
You're dreaming!

512
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:49,510
All he thinks about

513
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:51,670
is catching Communists all day long.

514
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:56,360
It's not enough to catch them in Suzhou; now he has to go to Shanghai too.

515
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:58,750
Is the Director being promoted to the headquarters?

516
00:24:58,750 --> 00:24:59,310
No.

517
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:01,190
Just the other day,

518
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:02,710
he specifically called Xie Wenchao from Shanghai.

519
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:04,540
The two of them locked themselves in the study for half a day,

520
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:05,470
whispering who knows what.

521
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:06,070
Pong.

522
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:09,360
And in the end, they even took my Hwa Hsia magazine with them.

523
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,120
These agents

524
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:12,550
are really interesting.

525
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:15,210
What could possibly be Communist-related in a magazine?

526
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:17,830
Maybe he's just interested in the pin-up girls.

527
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:19,910
Mrs. Zhou, you should be careful.

528
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,020
He wouldn't dare.

529
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,150
Ever since that business with Weng...

530
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:30,170
I'm done. I win!

531
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:31,870
I'm so lucky.

532
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:33,360
You're so lucky!

533
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,260
I'm exhausted.

534
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:43,760
Where have you been?

535
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:46,320
Played mahjong all day.

536
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:49,630
Here.

537
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:51,700
Have some water.

538
00:25:57,470 --> 00:25:58,820
They kept

539
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:00,140
asking me

540
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:01,840
why I hadn't conceived yet.

541
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:03,760
Mr. Gu,

542
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:05,470
how should I respond to that?

543
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:11,560
You can tell them I'm the one with the problem.

544
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:14,760
That's not very dignified.

545
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,550
You're a man.

546
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:18,550
You need to maintain your reputation outside.

547
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:20,790
As for me, it doesn't matter. I'm just a woman.

548
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:21,830
I told them I was taking

549
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:24,830
traditional Chinese medicine to regulate my health.

550
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:26,470
I...

551
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:30,060
I'm sorry.

552
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:31,760
I'm not blaming anyone.

553
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:33,790
I just didn't expect this pretense

554
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:35,910
to last for two years.

555
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:38,700
Mr. Gu, when will you be able

556
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,180
to complete your mission?

557
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:43,430
What mission?

558
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:45,360
Here we go again,

559
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:46,950
never a sincere word.

560
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:48,880
I don't want to talk to you anymore.

561
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:49,920
I heard that the other day,

562
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,430
Zhou Zhifei specifically called Xie Wenchao

563
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:52,990
back from Shanghai.

564
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:54,750
What for?

565
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,390
How would I know?

566
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,390
Maybe they're planning to catch someone.

567
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:00,880
Ji Yuqing said

568
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:01,790
Zhou even took

569
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:04,060
several issues of her Hwa Hsia magazine.

570
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:07,150
It's been a chaotic day.

571
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:08,520
I can hardly stand.

572
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:13,390
Grab a bite first.

573
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:14,880
We'll go to Ono's later.

574
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:16,550
That's exactly

575
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:17,620
why I rushed back.

576
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:19,930
I've already prepared the gifts.

577
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,870
Go change into another suit;

578
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:23,930
you look terrible.

579
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:40,150
Mr. Ono,

580
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:42,710
this is the date cake made by my wife.

581
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:45,090
Thank you.

582
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:47,230
This is Shengchunyang's cured meat.

583
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:48,750
I'm not sure if you're accustomed to eating it.

584
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:49,940
We like it very much.

585
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:50,790
Thank you.

586
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:51,800
You're welcome.

587
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:53,070
Here.

588
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:58,210
Miwako, why don't you go play over there?

589
00:27:58,430 --> 00:27:58,760
Yes.

590
00:27:58,780 --> 00:27:59,240
Yes.

591
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:01,730
Junsheng,

592
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:03,630
go play with them.

593
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,120
Thank you.

594
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,660
Mr. Ono, where do you work?

595
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:15,330
Import and export trade.

596
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:18,110
If Mr. Gu

597
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:19,590
ever needs anything,

598
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:20,650
feel free to ask,

599
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:22,360
especially for

600
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:23,470
scarce goods.

601
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:26,150
Thank you. Actually, we don't need much...

602
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:26,990
Mr. Ono.

603
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:29,830
Do you think it's possible to get some Indian rice?

604
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:30,550
Rice?

605
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:32,950
In these times,

606
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:35,880
just filling our stomachs is most important.

607
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:39,870
Mr. Gu works for the government;

608
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:42,790
surely you're not worried about going hungry。

609
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:46,030
These days, it's fashionable

610
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:48,070
to stock up on essentials.

611
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:49,030
After all,

612
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:50,830
with the government establishing

613
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:52,470
the Rice Control Committee,

614
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:54,390
it's getting harder to find these items

615
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:55,590
on the market.

616
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,290
Prices keep rising.

617
00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:01,740
We do have rice at our company,

618
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:06,170
but most of it is just plain brown rice.

619
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:08,910
Your child is old enough

620
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:11,670
to eat white rice,

621
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:15,410
so I'll keep an eye out for you.

622
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:17,510
Thanks in advance, Mr. Ono.

623
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:20,210
If you could also get some soap...

624
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:20,830
Haimo.

625
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:23,700
Sorry.

626
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,330
Soap? Soap is easy.

627
00:29:26,650 --> 00:29:27,780
We have some at home.

628
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:31,270
I'll have my wife bring some over for you.

629
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,030
Thank you.

630
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:34,070
-You're welcome.
-Thank you.

631
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:34,870
Have some tea.

632
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:43,240
I also have a small request.

633
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:47,420
I wonder if Mrs. Gu could help me with something.

634
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:48,710
Me?

635
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:52,050
If there's something I can do,

636
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:53,110
just ask.

637
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:55,540
I wonder if I could have the honor

638
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:59,000
of becoming your student?

639
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:01,940
My student?

640
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,560
Yes, as a ballad teacher.

641
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:07,430
Jiro heard you singing ballads

642
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:09,560
and was deeply moved by the melody.

643
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:11,910
He couldn't stop praising it,

644
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:13,660
thinking it was otherworldly.

645
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:14,850
You flatter her.

646
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:16,830
She only knows a little.

647
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:19,550
I'm not qualified to be called a teacher.

648
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:21,560
But if Mr. Ono is interested,

649
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:23,750
you're welcome at Gu's Garden anytime.

650
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:25,150
That would be wonderful!

651
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:35,310
Haimo,

652
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:37,780
I think

653
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:39,420
you were too hasty today.

654
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:40,750
You shouldn't have agreed

655
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:42,550
to Mr. Ono's request so quickly.

656
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:44,350
It's just teaching him ballads.

657
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:45,350
I can see

658
00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:47,500
that Mr. Ono genuinely likes ballads.

659
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,740
These soaps he gave us

660
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:52,450
are impossible to find in Suzhou right now.

661
00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:55,010
Ono's identity is complicated.

662
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:56,410
His family suddenly moved here,

663
00:30:56,410 --> 00:30:58,390
and they're closely connected with the Japanese military.

664
00:30:58,390 --> 00:30:59,760
So what do you suggest?

665
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:01,830
Rely on giving them a few snacks?

666
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:02,150
I...

667
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:03,030
Haven't you already

668
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:04,830
investigated them thoroughly?

669
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:06,350
Teaching him ballads

670
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:09,020
is an excellent way to make contact.

671
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:11,130
Since he made the request,

672
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:12,070
he naturally won't suspect

673
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:13,800
that we have ulterior motives.

674
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:18,410
You've been planning this for a while, haven't you?

675
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:20,240
Did you really visit Ono just

676
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,500
for the sake of neighborhood relations?

677
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:25,750
Although I don't know what your mission is,

678
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,670
can you think of a faster way?

679
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:35,720
You always look down on me,

680
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:38,690
just like those other ladies.

681
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,250
I don't look down on you.

682
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:44,350
I genuinely believe this is dangerous,

683
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:46,010
and I don't want you involved.

684
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:48,680
And it's not dangerous for you?

685
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:51,400
If it were Miss Xiao,

686
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,770
would you stop her from going?

687
00:31:57,670 --> 00:31:59,460
I may not be

688
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:00,920
as capable as Miss Xiao,

689
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:02,880
but I'm your wife now.

690
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:06,030
If I don't handle these matters,

691
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:07,360
do you expect

692
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:09,520
someone else to do it?

693
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:25,510
Fine.

694
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:32,750
Sir,

695
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:35,790
we've investigated 13 staff members,

696
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:37,400
and this one is the most suspicious:

697
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,310
Huang Zuchong.

698
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:40,860
He joined the Hwa Hsia two years ago

699
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:42,690
as an editor for the architecture section.

700
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:44,960
He claims to be a graduate of Hokkaido University.

701
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,160
His wife passed away,

702
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,240
and he lives alone

703
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,950
in a three-story house

704
00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:51,170
behind Hua'an Company on Nanjing Road.

705
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:53,140
He's also a director at Hengdeli Trading Company,

706
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:54,870
and Schroeder vouched for him.

707
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:57,190
Everything seems to fit perfectly.

708
00:32:58,130 --> 00:33:00,790
Unfortunately, after all this investigation,

709
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:03,500
you didn't even get his real name.

710
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:06,210
His name is Huang Qiushou.

711
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,510
We worked together in the early days

712
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:09,880
in the Communist Party.

713
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:11,590
He was in the First Department, responsible for intelligence,

714
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:14,320
and I was in the Second Department of Operations.

715
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:17,190
But in 1932, he went to Japan,

716
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:20,200
and I hadn't heard of his return until now.

717
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:30,880
[Ambitions Realized]

718
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:42,720
I suddenly remembered something.

719
00:33:43,330 --> 00:33:44,930
Mr. Li once told me

720
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:46,030
about a case he and Wang Sicheng

721
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:48,220
handled in 1936 involving the Communist Party.

722
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:49,850
There was also a man with the surname Huang,

723
00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:51,690
who had studied abroad in Japan,

724
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:55,110
published magazines, and understood architecture.

725
00:33:56,090 --> 00:33:56,760
Then, Sir,

726
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:58,030
that must be him.

727
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:04,180
At the time, he had a wife from the Northeast.

728
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:05,710
So,

729
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:09,219
it seems they were setting a trap together.

730
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:16,400
The Japanese army urgently

731
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:18,130
transferred a battalion from Shanghai

732
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:20,260
to reinforce the Kobayashi Division.

733
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:23,190
The leaders of the New Fourth Army sent a telegram to the Jiangsu Provincial Committee,

734
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:24,760
stating that after the third phase of the "pacification" operation,

735
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,690
stubborn and collaborationist forces of the enemy in Jiangsu

736
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:27,989
have become extremely rampant.

737
00:34:27,989 --> 00:34:29,350
To minimize sacrifices,

738
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:31,139
we must quickly ascertain the specific details

739
00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:33,260
of the Japanese military's Wu Plan.

740
00:34:33,449 --> 00:34:34,489
Come on.

741
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:35,090
Here.

742
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:40,280
My connections aren't within the Kobayashi,

743
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:42,940
so it's indeed difficult to find out

744
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,460
the details of the Japanese military's Wu Plan.

745
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:46,120
But since he's already been assigned this task,

746
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:48,000
I believe he can complete it.

747
00:34:49,389 --> 00:34:51,750
The current struggle is very tough,

748
00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:53,199
and the Jiangsu Provincial Committee has decided

749
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:56,190
to disperse and retreat to the northern Jiangsu base area,

750
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:57,720
leaving only a few comrades

751
00:34:57,790 --> 00:34:59,390
to continue the resistance.

752
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,290
Huang,

753
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:03,630
you're also on the list for this retreat.

754
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:10,670
Huang Qiushou,

755
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:15,190
single, living alone, not married, and no drinking.

756
00:35:15,450 --> 00:35:18,010
His daily routine is just work and home

757
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:20,670
So cautious.

758
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:24,590
His place is in an office building

759
00:35:24,730 --> 00:35:26,570
with many company signs,

760
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:28,090
and it has both front and back exits,

761
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:29,350
perfect for an escape.

762
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:30,840
This shows

763
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:33,650
he's undoubtedly a professional agent.

764
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:36,840
Quickly organize all your contacts

765
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:37,860
and hand them over

766
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:39,470
to the new comrade.

767
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:40,350
Alright,

768
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:43,390
but I need to make a special handover

769
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,680
of my connections in Suzhou.

770
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:47,140
He trusts me more.

771
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:47,950
Okay.

772
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:50,760
Try to complete the handover within two days.

773
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,060
There were two following me today.

774
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:56,410
Lonely Boat also warned me that

775
00:35:56,410 --> 00:35:58,560
Zhou Zhifei and his men are investigating the Hwa Hsia.

776
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,460
You shouldn't go to

777
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:00,660
the Hwa Hsia anymore.

778
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:03,030
Organize all your contacts

779
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:04,470
and be ready to evacuate at any time.

780
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:06,670
The specific evacuation time and route

781
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:08,800
will be communicated to you

782
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,970
by Comrade Baoqing, the liaison officer.

783
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:18,530
What is this?

784
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:20,650
My men were following him

785
00:36:20,990 --> 00:36:23,270
and found that

786
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:24,870
he hid a cigarette case in an alley.

787
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:25,910
They were worried it might contain intelligence,

788
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:27,040
so they took it back.

789
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:28,720
But after a thorough check,

790
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,500
I found nothing inside.

791
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:33,630
It doesn't even look like it was used for secret writing.

792
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:43,720
You all are too naive.

793
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:46,190
It was a decoy,

794
00:36:46,210 --> 00:36:47,910
and you've blown your cover.

795
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:49,440
Then...

796
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:51,150
Let's capture this Huang guy.

797
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:51,900
Capture him?

798
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,070
By the time you get there, he'd be long gone.

799
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:55,440
I'll call Wan Lilang

800
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:56,110
in Shanghai right away

801
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:57,920
and have him get No. 76 to help out.

802
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,380
You, head to Shanghai too.

803
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:01,130
Bring that Huang back to me.

804
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:03,610
I want him to confront Gu Yizhong.

805
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,430
Yes, Sir.

806
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:08,590
Yizhong?

807
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:16,840
Wenchao, long time no see!

808
00:37:17,350 --> 00:37:18,750
Indeed, long time no see.

809
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:20,410
What brings you here?

810
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:23,390
I went to Kunshan to visit my grandfather,

811
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:25,990
and on the way, I brought two baskets of hairy crabs for Director Zhou.

812
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:27,030
Would you like some?

813
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:27,910
No.

814
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:29,070
You're too kind.

815
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:29,750
No need.

816
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:31,630
I'll let you get back to work then.

817
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:32,140
Okay.

818
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:34,720
Take care.

819
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:49,400
To the train station, let's go.

820
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:21,950
[Phone booth]

821
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,780
Is this Jiayou Stationery Store?

822
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:34,130
Please pass a message to Yuanwai

823
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:36,950
that he's been exposed and should evacuate immediately.

824
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:37,510
I am...

825
00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:38,520
Lonely Boat.

826
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,840
[Gujia Lane]

827
00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:47,670
[The organization should quickly arrange new contacts with informants]

828
00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:47,670
[One contact is in Suzhou. My identity has been compromised, and I need to evacuate urgently]

829
00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:47,670
[I currently have three informants: one in Shanghai and one in Changzhou]

830
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:10,750
Cooking something?

831
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:26,920
Hello?

832
00:39:27,350 --> 00:39:28,430
This is Wan Lilang.

833
00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:30,820
Wan, how's the situation?

834
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:32,220
Huang ran away.

835
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:34,400
But we caught his liaison officer.

836
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:35,430
Okay.

837
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:36,790
Xie Wenchao

838
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:37,950
will arrive in Shanghai soon.

839
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:39,870
Hand this liaison officer over to him for interrogation.

840
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:41,430
Xie Wenchao has been transferred

841
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:43,020
to No. 76.

842
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:45,110
Why is he still handling things for No. 90?

843
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:45,710
Wan,

844
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:48,470
if you manage to catch Huang,

845
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:49,590
hand him over to me.

846
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:50,870
I'll take him back to Suzhou.

847
00:39:50,870 --> 00:39:51,950
He just needs to identify one person,

848
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:53,830
and once that's done, I'll return him to you.

849
00:39:53,830 --> 00:39:55,890
The credit for this one will go to you.

850
00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:56,670
Okay.

851
00:39:56,990 --> 00:39:57,790
It's a deal.

852
00:39:58,070 --> 00:39:59,220
Okay, thank you.

853
00:40:10,090 --> 00:40:10,610
[Noodles]

854
00:40:24,350 --> 00:40:25,210
Please come in.

855
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:06,710
Catch him!

856
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:16,430
Open it.

857
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:28,910
Okay, I'll wait for you all in the office,

858
00:41:29,310 --> 00:41:30,640
no matter how late it is.

859
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:37,920
Get Captain Zhang to my office.

860
00:41:56,670 --> 00:41:58,390
Director Zhou is really eager

861
00:41:58,430 --> 00:41:59,630
to see his old friend.

862
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:01,470
Director Zhou Zhifei.

863
00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:04,490
You haven't forgotten him, have you?

864
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:06,210
Take him to the car.

865
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:07,530
Back to Suzhou.

866
00:42:07,870 --> 00:42:08,470
Hurry.

867
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:10,550
Get in.

868
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:16,650
Gu's Garden has a back door, you know?

869
00:42:16,650 --> 00:42:17,700
I have three teams.

870
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:19,900
One guards the front door, another guards the back door,

871
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:22,360
and I'll lead a team inside to apprehend him.

872
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,670
We're not calling it apprehending;

873
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:26,330
we're calling it "inviting."

874
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:28,220
Yes, Director.

875
00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:29,950
I'll go "invite" him now.

876
00:42:29,950 --> 00:42:30,550
No rush.

877
00:42:30,990 --> 00:42:32,480
Xie Wenchao and his team

878
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:34,310
will arrive in about five hours.

879
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:37,490
Let's allow him to sleep halfway through the night.

880
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:40,190
When he's groggy in the second half,

881
00:42:40,270 --> 00:42:41,600
that's when we go and "invite" him.

882
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,350
That's when a person's willpower

883
00:42:43,350 --> 00:42:44,540
is at its weakest,

884
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:47,190
making our work easier.

885
00:42:53,830 --> 00:42:54,670
I

886
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:56,880
need to rest up now.

887
00:42:57,030 --> 00:42:57,630
Okay.

888
00:42:58,390 --> 00:43:00,630
I'll have someone notify you if anything comes up.
