8
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:42,130
I got a letter from your father.

9
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:43,560
Happy birthday.

10
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:47,350
I dug up a well in Tanzania
under your name.

11
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:48,400
From your father.

12
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,600
Hey, Honey.

13
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:53,350
Min Hyuk, ta-da.

14
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:56,120
Uncle got you a present.

15
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,980
Goodness, Min Hyuk.

16
00:00:57,980 --> 00:00:59,650
I'm so jealous, Min Hyuk!

17
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:03,150
Dad, I want something
that huge on my birthday too.

18
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:04,330
Yes, of course.

19
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:08,970
I'll get you something
that huge on your birthday too.

20
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:10,590
- Something this huge.
- Give me five.

21
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:11,660
My goodness.

22
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:14,660
My parents had a bigger dream
than their child.

23
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,470
Around when I began to walk,

24
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,370
they worked abroad...

25
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:21,840
for about 300 days in a year
out of 365 days,

26
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:24,270
digging up wells,

27
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:26,010
building up schools,

28
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,050
and establishing hospitals.

29
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:31,450
People usually say parents are in
one-sided love with their children.

30
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:33,690
But it was me
who was in one-sided love with them.

31
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:36,860
I wanted my parents
to think well of me.

32
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:38,830
That's why I studied hard.

33
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:40,620
Goodness, cheers.

34
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:43,890
Isn't Kang Woo really big now?

35
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,500
He's almost as big as you.

36
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:51,110
Don't lose your heart.

37
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,940
It's not the first time...

38
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:54,810
they didn't show up
after they promised.

39
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:57,979
It'll only hurt you
if you let this get to you...

40
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,170
every single time.

41
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:02,920
Yes, I'm fine.

42
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:11,120
You should eat too.

43
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:12,890
I'm fine.

44
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:14,200
It's really good.

45
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:17,560
Goodness, these two cousins
don't look anything alike.

46
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:19,840
People say that
older brothers are always better,

47
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,200
but it's the opposite
with his family.

48
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,470
The younger one is very smart.

49
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:25,980
I heard he's getting all
the attention from the chairwoman.

50
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:27,700
- Really?
- Yes.

51
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,810
I heard everything,
but I didn't want to comfort him.

52
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:32,110
He already had a lot of things.

53
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,740
I thought I deserved to be adored...

54
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:37,290
by some strangers.

55
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:39,980
He already had a lot of things.

56
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:42,579
For once, I...

57
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:01,450
For once, I...

58
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:07,320
wanted something too.

59
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:18,450
What are you doing?

60
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:20,230
Who do you think you are?

61
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,990
Wait, do you...

62
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:27,860

- Ask me.

63

You know I can't lie.

00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:32,700
Ask me why...

65
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:34,880
I'm doing this.

66
00:03:39,579 --> 00:03:41,140
Do you like Seo...

67
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:44,950
Why won't you finish asking?

68
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,829
- Why should I?
- You want to know.

69
00:03:47,829 --> 00:03:50,020
No, I don't want to know.

70
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,390
I'll tell you.

71
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:52,800
I won't hear it.

72
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,260
- I'll tell you.
- I don't want to hear it.

73
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:57,360
- I'll tell you.
- I won't hear it!

74
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,860
Fine, I'll just tell you.

75

- Hey! Listen to me!
- Where are you going?

82
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:18,390
Where are you headed

83
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:21,790
- While you're jumping?
- You! Forget it. Forget it!

84
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,420
Really?

85
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,170
I won't do it.

86
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,360
What?

87
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:36,070
Seo Yeon, where are you?

[Episode 7]

89
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,980
How do you know her place?

90
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:45,940
Because we went
to middle school together.

91
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:49,590
Does that mean
you know where she lives?

92
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:52,720
We were close.

93
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:55,230
But why are you two like that now?

94
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:58,190
It's none of your business.

95
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:15,740
Thank you.

96
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,750
I'll make it my business
from now on.

Gosh, my head. My head hurts.

Have some water.

100

I'm so glad you didn't kill him.

101
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:52,420
I'm so glad. I'm glad you held back.

102
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:53,720
Well done, Seo Yeon.

103
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,380
I think I kind of
messed with Kang Woo.

104
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:01,660
How?

105
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:05,100
I think I threw
some stones or something.

106
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:06,660
What?

107
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,860
Why is he coming in a taxi
when he has a fancy car?

108
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:18,730
Why? What? What is it?

109
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:23,910
Hey! You stole his car?

110
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:27,110
What?

111
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:41,560

[Hangover drink]

113

Is this poisoned?

114
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,350
You try this first.

115
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:05,290
Someone who shouldn't
give this to her gave it to her.

116
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:07,290
We were wondering
if it was poisoned.

117
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:09,050
It looks fine.

118
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:10,900
It doesn't look opened.

119
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,550
What is this? How much
is he going to bully me today...

120
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:14,920
that he gave me this drink first?

121
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:17,900
Is this from Chief Director Lee?

122
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:20,340
Yes.

123
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:24,040
Did I do anything weird yesterday?

124
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:29,170
No, you took a taxi and went home.

125
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,020
Then why?

126
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:34,440
Whatever. I'll just drink it.

127
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,110
Why is Kang Woo acting like...

128
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:59,610
an elementary school student
who has a crush on someone?

129
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,300
Then why did he do something
that absurd with Hyun Soo?

130
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:04,810
What do you mean by I'm his lover

Why? How?

133
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,480
Park Hyun Soo said profusely
that we should never tell...

134
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:14,550
Lee Kang Woo that we know
about their relationship.

135
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:17,530
Could it be?

The final boss is here.

137
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,840
Hello?

138
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,160
Let me ask you one question.

139
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,380
I get that you made up that lie...

140
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:51,030
because you two thought
we were that low.

141
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,230
Come on,
we didn't think you were low.

142
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:55,920
Forget it.
Was Kang Woo really aware?

143
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,900
- What?
- Wasn't it just you?

144
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,770
If she finds out,

145
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,770
I will never see you again.

146
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,280
Okay?

147
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,340
No, of course, he knew.

148
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,070
So Kang Woo lied to Seo Yeon...

149
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:14,050
and asked her out
knowing everything,

150
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:15,440
without any other feelings,

151
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,680
just to get his revenge
on that ancient history?

152
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:20,490
- Yes.
- So...

153
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:23,450
Are you sure Kang Woo
doesn't like her?

154
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,720
What? Kang Woo?
Don't be ridiculous.

155
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,800
Well, it's better that
no one's getting in the way.

I'll choose her partner.

- Never mind.

Let's never see each other again.

160
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,050
Stop leeching off Kang Woo
and focus on cleaning.

161
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:50,550
I know all jobs are valuable,

162
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:53,450
but you should only spend
as much as you can afford.

163
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:56,760
I'll pay for this.

164

Why is she being so obsessive?

165
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:04,540
She should've just gotten mad.
I would've felt less uncomfortable.

166
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,570
Wait. "Cleaning"?

167
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:26,710
Ms. Joo.

168
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,580
If you're on your way
to the Faculty Room,

169
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:32,850
could you place my pot outside?

170
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:35,960
It's time for my baby to sunbathe.

171
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,130
Please be delicate.

172
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,140
- Sorry?
- Also,

173
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:42,010
could you get rid of all the paper?

174
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,910
Like the chief director said,
P.E. teachers don't have much to do.

175
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:46,380
Is that so?

176
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,780
Of course.

177
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:50,880
That's great.
Then she'll know what to do.

178
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,280
Be careful.

179
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:53,670
Thanks.

180
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:22,200
Hey!

181
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,620
Chief Director Lee!

182
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:36,820
You can use the other side.

183
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:39,300
You shouldn't waste this if you want
to cut down on the expenses.

184
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:46,560
Ms. Joo, from now on,
you must always be on standby...

185
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,010
from the moment you clock in
until you clock out.

186
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:52,070
I don't know
when I'll be needing you.

187
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,600
Don't make her do anything else.

188
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:57,010
Yes, sir.

189
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:00,840
Just wait for my orders.

190
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:03,810
Understood?

191
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:09,720
- Understood?
- Yes, sir.

192
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:15,060
Why did he take my pot?

193
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:17,000
Sir, calm down.

194
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,330
What was that?

195
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:22,270
How dare they order her around?

196
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,470
She's already suffering
from a hangover.

197
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,600
That was today?

198
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:30,650
I'm not sure if I can go.

199
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:33,170
You could come.
They're all talking about you.

200
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:34,620
Some think you've died somewhere...

201
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:35,890
while others think
you've become a drug addict.

202
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:37,660
Such absurd rumors are spreading.

203
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:39,850
Why are they so interested
in a stranger's life?

204
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:41,630
You're not just a stranger.

205
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:43,920
You're the eldest son
of Shinhwa Food.

206
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,420
Don't taint
your company's reputation.

207
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,370
I'll see you later tonight.

208
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,930
Gosh, this is bothersome.

209
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,870
Don't forget to bring someone
with you.

210
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:58,170
Don't make the women
drool over you...

211
00:12:58,170 --> 00:12:59,970
when they're already taken.

212
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,750
What about you?

213
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:10,150
What kind of men do you like?

214
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:12,310
Looks are very important to me.

215
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:24,690
I'm not bad-looking.

216
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:26,300
What is going on?

217
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:29,140
You need to look 200 times uglier.

218
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:30,930
More, more.

219
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:34,840
Why are you still so handsome?

220
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,250
What?

221
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:37,410
A mole!

222
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:42,810
- What's wrong with you?
- Mr. Lee. Tell me about your house.

223
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:45,180
Do you pay monthly or yearly rent?
Or is it your house?

224
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:47,660
- It's my house.
- Your family must be wealthy.

225
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,080
What do your parents do?

226
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:50,530
They do charity.

227
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:52,000
They're kindhearted.

228
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,550
Where did you go to college?

229
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,400
Hangook University.

230
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:57,740
Don't tell me
you studied medicine there!

231
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:02,300
I did. But why are you asking me
these questions?

232
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:05,240
Then why are you not a doctor
at a hospital?

233
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:10,550
Well...
According to the School Health Law,

234
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:13,650
a school must have a doctor,
a pharmacist, and a nurse...

235
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:16,210
I get it. I'll be going now.

236
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:20,120
Seo Yeon, I will find your...

237
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:34,330
So if you don't bring a friend,

238
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:36,430
you'd be in a pickle?

239
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,600
That's right.

240
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:41,670
I wasn't planning to go,

241
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,340
but they like to talk.

242
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:46,880
Am I asking for too much?
If you're not comfortable, then...

243
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,750
- I'll go.
- What?

244
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:51,890
You've been a great help.

245
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:54,790
If you're okay, then I'd love to go.

246
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,220
I'd be honored.

247
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,300
Then I'll see you after school.

248
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:22,620
Why are we here?

249
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:27,450
I'm sorry
I didn't prepare beforehand.

250
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:30,630
I'll call Mi Kyung right now
and tell her to bring some clothes.

251
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:33,950
She already picked out something.

252
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,420
What?

253
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,090
Hello.

254
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,120
What's going on?

255
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,580
He asked me to pick one out.

256
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,080
What do you think?
Isn't it really pretty?

257
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,790
[Price: 4,300 dollars]

258
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:00,450
Did you even see the price tag?

259
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:03,660
Hey, don't be ridiculous.
It's not for you to keep.

260
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:06,630
After wearing it for the evening,
you'll have to return it to him.

261
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:08,820
How could you think
about keeping it?

262
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:11,460
Since you've decided
to help him out, do your best.

263
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,800
Call me when it's over.

264
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,140
Lucky you.

265
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,200
Hey!

266
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,390
Don't laugh.

267
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,850
Don't be ridiculous.

268
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:40,350
Gosh, this is not my style.

269
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:43,320
Here I come.

270
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:10,630
What is it? Is it that bad?

271
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:14,960
See? I told you it wouldn't suit me.

272
00:17:17,089 --> 00:17:18,240
I'm just terrified.

273
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,829
I'm terrified by your beauty.

274
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:24,540
Min Hyuk.

275
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:30,070
Could you bring them down for me?

276
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:33,840
Min Hyuk, I can't believe
I ran into you here.

277
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:37,290
Who is she?

278
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,460
She's a teacher at our school.

279
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:42,320
She's my aunt.

280
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:44,530
Hello.

281
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:47,350
Hello. What's your name?

282
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:49,360
- I'm...
- Please excuse us.

283
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,590
We're in a hurry.

284
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,470
Let's go.

285
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,160
Oh, my.

286
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:57,740
I'll see you later.

287
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,830
Oh, my.

288
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:04,280
Does Min Hyuk have a girlfriend?

289
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,020
That was random.

290
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:09,290
I just ran into him,
and he was with this woman.

291
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:11,520
They looked more than just friends.

292
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,790
I doubt it.

293
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:14,460
He said she's a teacher
at your school.

294
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,050
Do you really not know?

295
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:33,040
Don't worry. I won't keep it.

296
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,400
You're worried I might want
to keep this dress, right?

297
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:36,570
Don't worry.

298
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:39,550
I wouldn't ask for something
this expensive.

299
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,020
That's absurd.

300
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:48,260
By the way, was it necessary
to get something this expensive?

301
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:51,080
Yes.

302
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:53,460
The pricier, the better.

303
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,300
The priciest ones are the best.

304
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,930
Wow, Mr. Lee.
I didn't take you for that type.

305
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:01,770
By the way, are you going
to keep addressing me like that?

306
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:05,370
We're here as partners.
You should call me something else.

307
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:10,600
Then...

308
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:13,310
How about "Min Hyuk"?

309
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,990
Min Hyuk.

310
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:21,260
Min Hyuk?

311
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:22,550
Min Hyuk.

312
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:24,760
Min Hyuk, wait up.

313
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:26,500
Oh, you came.

314
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:29,730
It's not the right time
to talk about it.

315
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,300
Hey, Min Hyuk.

316
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:34,630
Hey, Min Hyuk.

317
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:36,710
You finally showed up.

318
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:38,710
Goodness, who is she?

319
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,900
Hello, it's nice to meet you.

320
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,750
I see. Yes.

321
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:48,080
I can't believe you kept
this beautiful lady to yourself.

322
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:50,990
Isn't this the first time
Min Hyuk brought a plus one?

323
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:52,580
That's true.

324
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:55,430
What do you do?

325
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:58,620
Me? I teach kids.

326
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,460
She and I work at the same school.

327
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:01,470
School?

328
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:03,530
Are you giving lectures these days?

329
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:06,940
No. I'm just a school doctor
at a high school.

330
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:08,510
School doctor?

331
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:09,900
- What?
- What?

332
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,510
- This is good.
- I want to drink.

333
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:20,410
- This is so good.
- It's really good.

334
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,220
- Try this too.
- Thank you.

335
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:28,760
Who knew
he would be that nice to a woman?

336
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:32,120
Hey, you should be jealous
right now.

337
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:40,160
Hey, who liked whom first?

338
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,300
Of course,
I bet Seo Yeon liked him first.

339
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,210
- Have some water.
- Thank you.

340
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:49,750
It was me.

341
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:51,450
I liked her first.

342
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,020
- You?
- Yes.

343
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:55,310
I had a crush on her at first sight.
What?

344
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,810
I can't listen to this.

345
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,020
Gosh.

346
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:01,460
Yes, she's attractive and all,

347
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,350
but she's not that attractive
to have a crush on at first sight.

348
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,550
She told me
that I was beautiful earlier.

349
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:11,300
I had a crush on her at first sight.

350
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,940
And I slowly began to like her.

351
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,740
When I'm with her,

352
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:22,600
she makes me feel
I'm also a good person.

353
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,750
And she makes me want
to be a good person.

354
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:36,930
Gosh, Min Hyuk. You changed a lot.

355
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:40,550
Are we here
to listen to his love story?

356
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:46,740
All right.
You all prepared it, right?

357
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:48,330
- Has it been already a year?
- Already?

358
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:50,540
- It's been a year.
- They will donate something...

359
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:52,040
from their outfit.

360
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:54,570
And the profits will be donated
to a pediatric center.

361
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:57,480
They could have just brought cash.
Why donate their clothes?

362
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,980
They need an excuse.

363
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:02,110
An excuse to make...

364
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:04,290
this pointless meeting look useful.

365
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:06,790
He usually covers himself...

366
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:09,350
with brand designer clothes
from head to toe.

367
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:12,620
He only wears a 50-dollar tie
to this meeting.

368
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:15,300
And he donates a handkerchief.

369
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:16,890
And she donates socks.

370
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,740
Well, you can't force people
to make donations.

371
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:25,130
But I'm thinking of forcing them
to do so today.

372
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:29,250
We're going to...

373
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:34,810
donate everything
we're wearing today.

374
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:36,380
Right, Seo Yeon?

375
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:39,990
The pricier, the better.

376
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:41,760
The priciest ones are the best.

377
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,320
Yes.

378
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,550
Everything from head...

379
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,240
to toe.

380
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,660
- My gosh.
- Goodness.

381
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:03,680
Everything.

382
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:16,760
- I can donate too.
- I'll donate my watch.

383
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,770
Hey, your bag looks nice.

384
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:24,200
- Me too.
- Same here.

385
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,860
This is a new product, you know.

386
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:42,640
By the way,
how do you know where I live?

387
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,910
On the day of our school dinner...

388
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:48,110
I see. I must have told you
when I was drunk.

389
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:50,380
Gosh, silly me.

390
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:56,360
We have never gotten
such good donations like today.

391
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:58,470
- Thank you.
- Thank you...

392
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:01,240
for giving me a chance to be part
of it although it was not planned.

393
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:03,400
Right. By the way,

394
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,600
did you know
that I got butterflies earlier?

395
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:10,140
You made it sound so believable
how you began to like me,

396
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:12,280
so even I almost fell for it.

397
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:14,250
I meant it.

398
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,250
I can't lie.

399
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:21,080
Sure. Of course.

400
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,190
I'll go in now.

401
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:23,290
I'm serious.

402
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:26,200
Sure, sure.

403
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:28,730
Wait.

404
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:31,860
I meant it.

405
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,300
Goodness, yes.

406
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:35,360
Bye.

407
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:44,510
It's true.

408
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:06,860
You've never laughed like that
when you were with me.

409
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,440
And you've never made jokes
like that with me.

410
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,510
You've never...

411
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:19,980
gotten along that well with me.

412
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:35,160
He took off the accessory
he was wearing.

413
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,230
What did you say?

414
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:39,330
"We're going to donate everything
we're wearing today."

415
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:42,860
- Really?
- That was really cool.

416
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:51,750
What a surprise. I didn't know
you ate at the cafeteria.

417
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:53,180
It's my choice.

418
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:58,460
The heir of Shinhwa Food
is eating with us.

419
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,760
What an honor.

420
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:01,930
Right.

421
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:03,730
Mr. Lee.

422
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:06,500
The heir of Shinhwa Food
is eating with you.

423
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:13,000
Mr. Lee, can I ask you a question?

424
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,040
Remember the question...

425
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,010
you wanted me to ask you at dinner?

426
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:19,630
I'm thinking of asking you that now.

427
00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:30,720
Mr. Lee, why are you getting
between me and...

428
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:37,990
What are you doing?

429
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:41,090
You started this.

430
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:45,390
Min Hyuk,

431
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,770
why do you keep butting
in between me and...

432
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:54,780
Hey!

433
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:56,600
We're at the school.

434
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:06,110
What are you two doing?

435
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:07,490
Hey!

436
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:13,430
Ms. Joo.

437
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:16,970
I need to have a word with you.
Please come to my office now.

438
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:18,230
Immediately.

439
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:27,210
He thinks I'm a pushover.

440
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:36,110
Darn it.

441
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:42,150
You two seem very close.

442
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:43,820
You and Kang Woo, I mean.

443
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:54,060
Gosh, he's a kid.
No, both of them are kids.

444
00:27:58,010 --> 00:27:59,180
What is it?

445
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:06,020
I'm sorry. I'll come back later.

446
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:07,750
Report to me
about the track team's training.

447
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:09,110
Every day.

448
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:10,840
Don't skip a day.

449
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,650
- What?
- You can't do it?

450
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:14,290
I thought it was so important...

451
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:16,150
that you had to barge into my home
and get my approval.

452
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:17,350
I thought you were confident
about the team.

453
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:20,460
But still. Reporting every day...

454
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:22,120
I'm sponsoring the team.

455
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,770
I need to see some kind of result...

456
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:25,940
to decide whether or not
to keep the track team...

457
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:28,440
or keep you at school.

458
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,710
I can only make a decision, then.

459
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:30,710
Kang Woo...

460
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:33,900
- Chief Director Lee.
- I'll take that as a yes.

461
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,130
And you'll start today.

462
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:43,580
What did you do yesterday?

463
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:48,790
What did you do yesterday
after work?

464
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:51,080
I washed my feet and went to sleep.
What?

465
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:02,560
I shouldn't have asked her.

466
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,560
That didn't help at all.

467
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:11,840
That jerk, Kang Woo. I should...

468
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:18,380
Let's be a bigger person about it.

469
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,260
I can do it. I'm the good one here.

470
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:22,030
I can do this.

471
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,820
This is Joo Seo Yeon! I'm coming in!

472
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:33,440
[Approval needed]

473
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:45,250
What is this?

474
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:53,350
Where are you?
I came to make a report.

475
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:55,080
Oh, right.

476
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,290
"Oh, right."

477
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,000
- Then I'll report back tomorrow...
- Come to my house.

478
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:05,090
Wait, hey. Hello?

479
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:12,120
Hey, you jerk!

480
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:23,140
I guess he's still home.

481
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:36,120
Oh, I'm sorry.

482
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:38,890
Is this your turf? I'm sorry.

483
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:02,390
What are you doing?

484
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:04,450
I...

485
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:06,820
Hello.

486
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:09,630
Were you trying to avoid me?

487
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:10,680
I'll keep the secret!

488
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:11,890
Please trust me.

489
00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:19,970
Wait. What's with him, really?

490
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,380
You caught my attention
from a while ago.

491
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:27,830
Your ankle must hurt a lot.

492
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:29,140
You can wear these.

493
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:44,430
He likes...

494
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:46,490
her.

495
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:49,970
And he also...

496
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:52,240
likes her.

497
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:55,440
But what's going on
between these two?

498
00:31:57,330 --> 00:31:59,610
Gosh, I have no idea.

499
00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:01,800
Why are there
so many people around her?

500
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:04,180
Man, there's no place
for me to crash.

501
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:14,360
Is this really the only way?

502
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:23,770
Lee Joo Hee?

503
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,830
She has a great record.

504
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:28,670
Joo Hee? Right?

505
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:30,460
And she's getting better.

506
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:32,510
She's definitely
going to win this meet.

507
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:33,900
But everyone else isn't much.

508
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:35,800
They just need to keep training.

509
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:38,140
We'll wait and see.

510
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:44,890
Mr. Potato grew quite a lot.

511
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:47,260
Is that so?

512
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:51,330
And the water is clean too.

513
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:54,650
You're putting your heart into this.

514
00:32:54,650 --> 00:32:56,520
If you want to take it back,
go ahead.

515
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,300
It's really annoying.

516
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,900
You can eat
whatever I have over there.

517
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:07,510
Really?

518
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:09,050
Yes!

519
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,610
I'm just joking.

520
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:16,180
Don't worry. I won't let you go.

521
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:27,700
I guess rich people have
fancy refrigerators too.

522
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,900
What is this?

523
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:41,540
You told me to eat
whatever you have.

524
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:43,080
You didn't even cook those.

525
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:45,300
It's okay.
It's all the same once you eat it.

526
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:48,920
I bought all kinds of
fruit, milk, and everything.

527
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:50,550
And you choose to eat that?

528
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,420
It's good.

529
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:04,830
Don't be so cheap with food!

530
00:34:22,179 --> 00:34:23,739
You can do this?

531
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,960
You need to eat well
when you eat something.

532
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:26,960
Eat up.

533
00:34:35,929 --> 00:34:37,260
Do you want to do business with me?

534
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,040
What about you?

535
00:34:45,130 --> 00:34:46,739
I'm fine. I'll get fat.

536
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:49,070
Come on.

537
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:52,000
Have a bite.

538
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:58,220
Is it weird
because I used this spoon?

539
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,160
Isn't it good?

540
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,340
Give those to me.

541
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:16,970
You even cooked for me.
I should do the dishes.

542
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:18,240
Forget it.

543
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:30,880
You do the dishes
with such seriousness.

544
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:35,660
Yes, it's great to be diligent
in everything.

545
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:40,230
Stop lurking around,
and go eat some fruit.

546
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:42,860
Okay.

547
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,680
Look at these.

548
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:01,050
This tastes like beef.

549
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:09,250
Yes?

550
00:36:10,290 --> 00:36:12,490
I sent you an email.
Didn't you get it?

551
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:14,250
Impossible.

552
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:27,040
Yes, I sent you another email.
You can check again.

553
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:31,070
Yes, I'll see you at the meeting.

554
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:33,110
Okay.

555
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:38,010
My gosh!

556
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:42,090
Why are you here?

557
00:36:44,450 --> 00:36:45,730
You told me to follow you.

558
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:49,490
I was telling you to stay there.

559
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:52,120
Was that it?

560
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:56,470
I don't really know much about this,

561
00:36:56,610 --> 00:36:58,340
but it looks really great.

562
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,280
Your designs.

563
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:05,740
Well, they aren't bad.

564
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:09,420
But why don't you make
any women's clothes?

565
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:11,510
You used to draw a lot of those.

566
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:15,360
Do you remember?
The drawing that you gave me.

567
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,660
I still have...

568
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:19,490
You should go.

569
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:55,620
You were this good, so why?

570
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:26,030
What?

571
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:30,060
Why do I keep seeing things?

572
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:32,300
Hey, that's enough.

573
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:34,540
Wait. You're... You're real.

574
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:36,300
Stop avoiding me.

575
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:39,500
Just make sure
you tutor them on time.

576
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:40,570
Got it?

577
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:42,340
Okay.

578
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,470
That night...

579
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:52,520
At the bar.

580
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:55,710
Your anticipating gaze bothered me.

581
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:59,550
Don't think that all minorities
are on the same side.

582
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:01,690
When individuals form a group,

583
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:03,820
there's bound to be at least
one bad guy among them.

584
00:39:05,090 --> 00:39:08,560
So you were worried about me.

585
00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:10,800
You were protecting me
from the bad guys.

586
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,060
I had no idea.

587
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:14,830
No, what I meant was that
I'm the bad guy.

588
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:17,300
I'm the bad guy,
so don't take to heart what I...

589
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:20,750
Forget it.

590
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:25,180
And my family knows about it.

591
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:28,160
So don't blabber about keeping it
a secret, got it?

592
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,160
How?

593
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:33,320
How did you tell them?

594
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,100
Won Seok?

595
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:47,830
Who is that jerk next to him?

596
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:52,470
Well done.

597
00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:00,790
Aren't you going home?

598
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:02,820
Done? There's nothing more?

599
00:40:03,890 --> 00:40:08,320
Wow, you're very passionate
about your job, Ms. Joo.

600
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:10,400
It's all thanks to someone.

601
00:40:12,130 --> 00:40:13,330
I have an appointment later today.

602
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:18,510
No, I'm going alone.

603
00:40:19,170 --> 00:40:20,470
You can leave.

604
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:23,700
What? I see.

605
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:26,380
Okay, then.

606
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:28,810
I'll see you tomorrow.

607
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:46,870
What's gotten into him? He always
treated me like his personal driver.

608
00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:51,170
What is it? Is he going somewhere
that I can't go?

609
00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:05,620
Drink this. I haven't opened it.

610
00:41:26,930 --> 00:41:28,070
Is he going...

611
00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:30,470
on another blind date?

612
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:44,290
Is Seo Yeon the only female
left in this world?

613
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:47,720
Wherever I look, she's there.

614
00:41:52,690 --> 00:41:54,690
- Yes?
- Are you on your way?

615
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:56,960
You didn't forget
about our appointment, did you?

616
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:58,960
I'm sorry, but I'm afraid
I have to cancel.

617
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:19,530
Get in. We need to go
somewhere together.

618
00:42:23,530 --> 00:42:25,190
Why is he so capricious?

619
00:42:56,130 --> 00:42:58,590
What is this? Was I duped?

620
00:42:58,590 --> 00:43:01,300
He told me that it'd focus
on only one noise.

621
00:43:04,170 --> 00:43:05,300
Maybe I should've gotten
the 3,000-dollar one...

622
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:06,700
instead of this 2,000-dollar one.

623
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:35,190
Seo Yeon.

624
00:43:37,090 --> 00:43:38,090
Seo Yeon.

625
00:43:40,170 --> 00:43:41,190
Won Jae.

626
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,370
Won Seok?

627
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:52,470
Oh, no.

628
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:00,490
Mom...

629
00:44:01,490 --> 00:44:04,160
Mom...

630
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:08,030
Mom...

631
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:12,560
Mom...

632
00:44:12,930 --> 00:44:15,110
Mom...

633
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:18,300
Mom...

634
00:44:18,910 --> 00:44:20,830
Seo Jun, are you okay?

635
00:44:20,830 --> 00:44:22,040
Mom...

636
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:24,070
What's wrong? Are you hurt?

637
00:44:24,070 --> 00:44:25,150
Mom...

638
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:30,990
Mom... Mom...

639
00:44:30,990 --> 00:44:31,990
You're okay.

640
00:44:32,290 --> 00:44:34,420
- You're okay.
- Mom...

641
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:37,050
Mom... Mom...

642
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:48,640
Are you okay?

643
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:56,840
What's...

644
00:44:57,540 --> 00:44:58,750
Don't tell Seo Yeon.

645
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:07,420
This was my first time visiting
a fabric market, and it was fun.

646
00:45:08,530 --> 00:45:09,580
Was it?

647
00:45:10,490 --> 00:45:13,090
Then you can drive me there
from now on.

648
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:15,400
It'll be fun for you
and convenient for me.

649
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:17,630
Over my dead body.

650
00:45:24,510 --> 00:45:25,740
[You're listening to 95.9MHz.]

651
00:45:36,290 --> 00:45:37,440
I'm sleepy.

652
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:40,660
Oh, okay.

653
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:42,760
I'll wake you up when we're there.

654
00:45:46,050 --> 00:45:47,720
This is driving me crazy.

655
00:45:48,530 --> 00:45:50,530
Snap out of it. Come on!

656
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:54,770
Place your left leg
next to your right.

657
00:45:54,770 --> 00:45:59,280
Breathe in. One. Exhale.

658
00:45:59,410 --> 00:46:01,380
Two. Exhale.

659
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:04,540
Just take it.

660
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:06,840
Should I?

661
00:46:10,990 --> 00:46:12,080
Lee Kang Hee speaking.

662
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:13,810
You sent the report?

663
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:15,790
I'll check it soon.

664
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:20,190
When did she take it?

665
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,870
Then she'll wake up in the morning.

666
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:26,930
Okay. Bring her to Room 1405.

667
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:29,170
Bye.

668
00:46:34,930 --> 00:46:36,410
What a disgusting scumbag.

669
00:46:44,790 --> 00:46:46,290
She's heavier than I thought.

670
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:47,450
We're almost there.

671
00:46:47,450 --> 00:46:48,790
Was it Room 1405?

672
00:46:48,790 --> 00:46:51,030
- Yes.
- Okay, let's go.

673
00:47:06,610 --> 00:47:08,570
Then she'll wake up in the morning.

674
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,200
Bring her to Room 1405.

675
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:11,580
Was it Room 1405?

676
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:12,940
- Yes.
- Okay.

677
00:47:17,010 --> 00:47:18,090
Ms. Lee Kang Hee!

678
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:26,060
Let's go.

679
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:30,460
Hurry up.

680
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:33,070
Come on, let's go.

681
00:47:33,070 --> 00:47:34,490
You can get off.

682
00:47:34,490 --> 00:47:35,930
- What?
- You're that guy...

683
00:47:35,930 --> 00:47:38,430
with the RC car and talked
about being polite to valet...

684
00:47:38,430 --> 00:47:39,670
and my character.

685
00:47:42,270 --> 00:47:43,380
Yes, I am.

686
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:44,440
But this is urgent. Let's go.

687
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:47,120
- You're putting on a show.
- Show?

688
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:49,120
You want me to believe
this is a coincidence too?

689
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:52,920
Get off. I'll take the lady.

690
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:53,980
Get off now.

691
00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:05,170
Gosh, this is not going well.

692
00:48:05,430 --> 00:48:06,430
Hey.

693
00:48:10,030 --> 00:48:11,530
- Who are you?
- Me?

694
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:14,340
- I'm her brother.
- As if.

695
00:48:14,670 --> 00:48:16,080
I know that
she doesn't have a brother.

696
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:18,650
Then, let's say that
I'm her brother from the club.

697
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:21,080
This is unbelievable.

698
00:48:21,210 --> 00:48:23,980
How dare you interfere
with me, pretty boy?

699
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:25,950
Goodness. Hey.

700
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:29,950
If a man calls another man
a pretty boy,

701
00:48:29,950 --> 00:48:33,190
it means women must think
that man is really handsome.

702
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:35,900
Gosh, good for you guys.

703
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:38,900
Your facial features
don't harmonize together.

704
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:41,030
- Me? Is he talking to me?
- Yes.

705
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:43,760
You scumbag.

706
00:48:56,420 --> 00:48:58,780
- Be quiet. It's okay.
- Forget it.

707
00:48:58,780 --> 00:49:00,980
- Fine. Go.
- Whatever, just go. I'll go alone.

708
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:02,130
Darn it.

709
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:04,720
Let's go for another round.

710
00:49:05,090 --> 00:49:06,450
Gosh. No way.

711
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:22,400
Are you crazy?

712
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:24,470
I should say that to you.
Are you crazy?

713
00:49:24,470 --> 00:49:26,910
How dare you get behind the wheel
after you've been drinking?

714
00:49:27,260 --> 00:49:28,870
What did you say?

715
00:49:29,410 --> 00:49:30,870
I should just...

716
00:49:35,210 --> 00:49:36,220
Ouch.

717
00:49:46,490 --> 00:49:47,760
Yes, Mr. Kim.

718
00:49:48,350 --> 00:49:49,820
Did you look into them?

719
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:51,430
Well, the guy
at the fitness center...

720
00:49:51,430 --> 00:49:52,790
is the fifth illegitimate son
of Baekdam Corporation's chairman...

721
00:49:52,790 --> 00:49:54,060
Baek Jun Gyo.

722
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:56,530
He's at Gangnam Police Station
for an assault charge.

723
00:49:56,530 --> 00:49:58,000
Assault?

724
00:49:58,260 --> 00:49:59,530
- Come on.
- This is unbelievable.

725
00:49:59,530 --> 00:50:02,180
- I can't believe I'm here.
- Darn it.

726
00:50:02,180 --> 00:50:05,770
- Darn it. What should I do?
- Seriously.

727
00:50:07,870 --> 00:50:09,270
Do you know who I am?

728
00:50:09,610 --> 00:50:12,280
I'll make you rot in prison
for the rest of your life.

729
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:13,650
Calm down, and sit down.

730
00:50:13,650 --> 00:50:14,750
Sit down.

731
00:50:17,350 --> 00:50:18,550
Come on.

732
00:50:19,190 --> 00:50:20,620
You weren't one of them.

733
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:26,520
Mr. Baek Gook Hwa.

734
00:50:27,430 --> 00:50:28,500
Who is she?

735
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:35,830
You know that Chairman Baek
will never forgive you...

736
00:50:35,830 --> 00:50:38,010
if you were on people's lips, right?

737
00:50:38,010 --> 00:50:40,250
Who on earth are you?

738
00:50:43,070 --> 00:50:45,510
I have the lady's statement
in this flash drive.

739
00:50:46,750 --> 00:50:47,810
What do you want to do?

740
00:50:47,810 --> 00:50:50,310
Should I hand this over
to the police?

741
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:53,120
Or will you settle this quietly?

742
00:50:55,350 --> 00:50:57,050
Darn it.

743
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:04,240
They keep doing this
because they never get punished.

744
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:05,710
You should have submitted
the evidence.

745
00:51:06,010 --> 00:51:08,440
Sometimes,
words are faster than law.

746
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:15,210
Yes, Mr. Park.
I'm going to send you something.

747
00:51:15,610 --> 00:51:17,980
Call me once you see it. Okay.

748
00:51:20,250 --> 00:51:22,280
I didn't promise
that I wouldn't talk to a reporter.

749
00:51:23,010 --> 00:51:24,920
And don't worry about her.

750
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:26,490
Her parents came to get her.

751
00:51:26,490 --> 00:51:29,090
Goodness,
she always picks the worst guys.

752
00:51:29,090 --> 00:51:30,460
How did you know...

753
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:32,620
what they were going to do?

754
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:35,560
Well, I can tell when men come
to clubs with an ulterior motive.

755
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:37,640
Their eyes are different.

756
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:40,640
So you followed them to the hotel...

757
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:41,940
and saved her?

758
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:45,750
You know, I can be a loyal friend.

759
00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:48,040
You didn't change your mind
when you were their accomplice?

760
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:49,680
I can't believe this.

761
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:51,420
Am I wearing the wrong outfit today?

762
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:54,920
Why do you keep thinking
that I'm one of those jerks? Why?

763
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:58,510
You could have called the police.
Why did you go out of your way...

764
00:51:58,510 --> 00:52:00,260
Had I called the police then,

765
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:01,930
I would've been dead.

766
00:52:01,930 --> 00:52:04,660
The club employees and the thugs
would have attacked me.

767
00:52:04,660 --> 00:52:06,520
We are friends,

768
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:08,290
but not that close
to risk my life for.

769
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:13,010
Well, things would change
if her family owned Shinhwa Food.

770
00:52:13,010 --> 00:52:15,830
You're not going to pretend
that you don't know about my family?

771
00:52:15,830 --> 00:52:18,530
You already read my play.
What's the point?

772
00:52:21,210 --> 00:52:22,570
Don't worry.

773
00:52:22,570 --> 00:52:24,770
I won't show up
in your life anymore.

774
00:52:25,310 --> 00:52:28,040
Anyway, thanks for today.

775
00:52:37,050 --> 00:52:38,260
Mr. Kim.

776
00:52:38,590 --> 00:52:41,000
I told you I didn't need you
to come. Why did you come?

777
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:43,400
I'm not here for you.

778
00:52:50,710 --> 00:52:52,270
I'm sorry at this late hour.

779
00:52:52,370 --> 00:52:54,250
He was being unreasonable.

780
00:52:54,250 --> 00:52:55,450
It's all right.

781
00:52:56,010 --> 00:52:58,250
He won't be able to drive
ever again, right?

782
00:52:58,250 --> 00:52:59,510
Right. It's his third strike.

783
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:01,580
And the assault charge
was added on this time.

784
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:03,110
If that's not enough
to teach him a lesson,

785
00:53:03,110 --> 00:53:04,550
he's not a human being.

786
00:53:05,050 --> 00:53:06,230
Thank you.

787
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:10,900
- What happened?
- Kang Hee.

788
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:12,700
Why are you here?

789
00:53:12,790 --> 00:53:14,470
My name is Lee Kang Hee.

790
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Who are you?

791
00:53:16,140 --> 00:53:17,470
Hello.

792
00:53:18,330 --> 00:53:19,410
You don't need to know.

793
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:21,830
Thank you, Mr. Kim.

794
00:53:22,570 --> 00:53:23,570
Let's go.

795
00:53:28,270 --> 00:53:30,370
- Bye.
- Mr. Kim.

796
00:53:30,810 --> 00:53:32,150
Please don't tell...

797
00:53:32,580 --> 00:53:35,390
the elders
about our incidents today.

798
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:41,050
If they find out,
it won't be pretty.

799
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:48,560
Hey, slow down.

800
00:53:51,330 --> 00:53:52,440
Gosh.

801
00:53:59,710 --> 00:54:00,710
You.

802
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:03,510
You want me to lose it, don't you?

803
00:54:03,510 --> 00:54:05,510
How could you think
about jumping in front of the car?

804
00:54:05,510 --> 00:54:06,890
And right in front of me?

805
00:54:09,550 --> 00:54:10,660
Were you shocked?

806
00:54:10,660 --> 00:54:12,280
A while ago,

807
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:14,050
you tried to stop your ex
from driving after drinking.

808
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:15,550
And you almost got hurt
while trying to stop him.

809
00:54:15,850 --> 00:54:17,820
What on earth were you thinking?

810
00:54:19,060 --> 00:54:20,360
I had to stop it.

811
00:54:21,970 --> 00:54:23,090
So why...

812
00:54:24,790 --> 00:54:26,640
Why does it have to be you?

813
00:54:27,910 --> 00:54:29,740
If someone did what I did back then,

814
00:54:30,510 --> 00:54:32,270
my parents wouldn't have...

815
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:42,890
Bye.

816
00:54:43,850 --> 00:54:45,220
Thanks for today.

817
00:54:46,550 --> 00:54:47,580
And I'm sorry.

818
00:54:52,970 --> 00:54:54,120
What do you mean?

819
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:56,670
What happened to your parents?

820
00:55:18,220 --> 00:55:19,760
Why are you eating tofu
out of the blue?

821
00:55:20,230 --> 00:55:21,990
I've been in a horrible place.

822
00:55:22,230 --> 00:55:24,090
I need to cleanse my body and heart.

823
00:55:25,660 --> 00:55:26,670
Me too.

824
00:55:33,470 --> 00:55:35,100
This is good.
Which brand is it from?

825
00:55:35,530 --> 00:55:37,440
I don't know. I just picked one.

826
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:40,750
Shinhwa Food?

827
00:55:40,910 --> 00:55:42,370
- Darn it.
- Darn it.

828
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:44,680
Why do you hate it?

829
00:55:45,610 --> 00:55:47,040
What about you?

830
00:55:48,580 --> 00:55:49,580
Just because.

831
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:51,160
Same here.

832
00:55:54,890 --> 00:55:57,460
Are you still dating that guy?

833
00:55:59,290 --> 00:56:00,520
We're not dating.

834
00:56:00,670 --> 00:56:01,900
There's a story.

835
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:03,140
See?

836
00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:05,060
I had a feeling.

837
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:07,360
There's no way you would like
a handsome guy like him.

838
00:56:09,330 --> 00:56:12,070
What is it?
Do I need to go and beat him up?

839
00:56:12,070 --> 00:56:13,150
Just give me the word.

840
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:14,950
If I need to beat him up,

841
00:56:15,250 --> 00:56:16,370
I'll do it myself.

842
00:56:16,370 --> 00:56:17,750
That's amazing.

843
00:56:18,370 --> 00:56:20,340
Look how strong your fist looks.

844
00:56:25,390 --> 00:56:26,390
But still.

845
00:56:26,990 --> 00:56:28,550
If you get tired of beating him up,
call me.

846
00:56:28,930 --> 00:56:30,290
I can take over.

847
00:56:33,730 --> 00:56:35,590
My gosh, I'm going to bed.

848
00:56:36,140 --> 00:56:37,240
Good night.

849
00:56:47,250 --> 00:56:48,250
What?

850
00:56:49,250 --> 00:56:50,680
She doesn't need to know?

851
00:56:52,490 --> 00:56:55,580
So I'm someone who doesn't deserve
to be introduced to his family?

852
00:56:55,580 --> 00:56:56,690
That's it, right?

853
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:06,320
If someone did what I did back then,

854
00:57:07,170 --> 00:57:08,900
my parents wouldn't have...

855
00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:23,450
Why did you want to meet me
out of the blue?

856
00:57:23,450 --> 00:57:26,190
I don't think we're that close
to meet up late at night in private.

857
00:57:26,450 --> 00:57:29,150
You're the only one I could ask.

858
00:57:31,550 --> 00:57:33,080
Did something happen...

859
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:37,620
to Seo Yeon's parents?

860
00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:39,900
Why...

861
00:57:41,060 --> 00:57:42,430
do you want to know?

862
00:57:50,410 --> 00:57:51,530
It was back in middle school.

863
00:57:53,250 --> 00:57:55,340
It was probably
the day before our school trip.

864
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:10,900
Goodbye.

865
00:58:11,260 --> 00:58:13,020
Oh, dear.

866
00:58:14,090 --> 00:58:15,820
There. They won't come undone now.

867
00:58:16,330 --> 00:58:17,760
Does he still live here with you?

868
00:58:17,940 --> 00:58:19,510
I'll just say hello next time.

869
00:58:29,870 --> 00:58:31,650
They passed away at the same time...

870
00:58:32,070 --> 00:58:33,890
because of some jerk
who drove under influence.

871
00:59:01,750 --> 00:59:03,720
I haven't had that dream
for a while.

872
00:59:32,650 --> 00:59:34,210
It wasn't just my hands.

873
00:59:35,570 --> 00:59:36,920
It's now my feet too.

874
00:59:37,540 --> 00:59:38,680
I must be insane.

875
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:13,540
Without running,

876
01:00:14,310 --> 01:00:15,890
I would've been a mess.

877
01:00:25,730 --> 01:00:26,790
Kang Woo?

878
01:00:27,090 --> 01:00:28,520
Don't call out my name.

879
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:30,200
Are you here to work out too?

880
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:31,590
Don't talk to me.

881
01:00:34,010 --> 01:00:36,030
Don't smile at me.
I told you not to smile...

882
01:00:41,650 --> 01:00:42,680
Hey.

883
01:00:43,070 --> 01:00:44,340
at me.

884
01:01:22,850 --> 01:01:24,010
I'm sorry.

885
01:01:24,710 --> 01:01:25,710
What?

886
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:28,840
For everything in the past,
what happened recently,

887
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:32,380
right now, and even in the future.

888
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:34,850
I'll continue to be sorry.

889
01:01:35,350 --> 01:01:36,920
I'll make you concerned.

890
01:01:37,450 --> 01:01:38,710
I'll get on your nerves.

891
01:01:39,750 --> 01:01:41,250
I'll make you think about me.

892
01:01:41,860 --> 01:01:42,960
What do you mean?

893
01:01:49,990 --> 01:01:51,060
I'm sorry...

894
01:01:51,930 --> 01:01:53,100
that I like you.

895
01:02:24,170 --> 01:02:25,760
[Love With Flaws]

896
01:02:25,820 --> 01:02:27,490
Could someone who always lied...

897
01:02:27,490 --> 01:02:28,700
be sincere?

898
01:02:28,700 --> 01:02:29,710
I hate hot guys.

899
01:02:29,710 --> 01:02:31,340
Why did you live like that?

900
01:02:31,340 --> 01:02:32,640
I'll torment you!

901
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:34,270
No one has a crush on someone
like this nowadays.

902
01:02:34,270 --> 01:02:35,610
Obsession. Possession.

903
01:02:35,610 --> 01:02:37,380
Why does he keep calling me?

904
01:02:37,380 --> 01:02:39,070
Forget it! I'm done!

905
01:02:39,070 --> 01:02:41,240
You two can fight fairly.
The strong will survive.

906
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:42,780
Is that so? Follow them, then.

907
01:02:42,780 --> 01:02:44,540
You always do as you please!

908
01:02:44,540 --> 01:02:45,890
Why do you keep
getting on my nerves?

909
01:02:45,890 --> 01:02:47,590
Why do you make me think about you?
