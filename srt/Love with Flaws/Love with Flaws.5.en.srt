00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:25,690
Why won't you sign it?

3
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:27,950
Is it because of
what happened in the past?

4
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:30,730
You didn't ask me out
because you really liked me.

5
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:32,380
You were trying to humiliate me
because you made a bet...

6
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:33,390
When did I...

7
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:06,630
Why?

8
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:16,930
What are you doing?
Let me go, you jerk!

9
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:20,500
Let me go!

10
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:23,450
Goodness!

11
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:32,289
Ms. Joo.

12
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:45,530
This is embarrassing.

13
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:49,700
So Kang Woo... I mean,

14
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:52,840
Mr. Lee and you went to
middle school together?

15
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,180
Yes, I visited him...

16
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:57,180
because I was in a rush
because of the track team.

17
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:00,210
But why did you get kicked out?

18
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,010
You just got kicked out, didn't you?

19
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:04,150
Did you...

20
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,760
make a mess?

21
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:09,650
- What?
- Kang Woo... I mean,

22
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:12,350
Mr. Lee is a bit sensitive
when it comes to cleanliness.

23
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:16,260
Oh, I spilled a bit of beer.

24
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:21,930
Anyway, what brings you here?

25
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:23,540
Min Hyuk.

26
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:28,980
Hey, what brings you here
at this hour?

27
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,070
Are you here to see Kang Woo?

28
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,400
How do you know Mr. Lee?

29
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:34,970
"Mr. Lee"?

30
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:40,150
Oh, right. You work
at Shinhwa High School.

31
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:45,990
What's going on?

32
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:47,530
It's like three different families
in "Under the Same Roof".

33
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:53,090
Don't you know the drama
"Under the Same Roof"?

34
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:54,900
Shinhwa High School is the roof,

35
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,030
and 1, 2, 3 families.

36
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:01,930
Why can't you just get it?

37
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:04,680
No, I just asked
how you know Mr. Lee.

38
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,180
Why wouldn't I? Min Hyuk is...

39
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,410
Hyun Soo. Long time no see.

40
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:10,310
He's just a friend.

41
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:12,210
Goodness, okay, yes.

42
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:13,990
We're friends,

43
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:15,060
and he's Kang Woo's...

44
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,250
Your skin is so firm.

45
00:03:19,329 --> 00:03:20,930
You must be dating these days.

46
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,430
Oh, I came to be friends...

47
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:29,530
with Mr. Lee through Hyun Soo.

48
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:30,770
Yes, right.

49
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:33,780
- Oh, I see.
- Oh, I see.

50
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:37,740
- We should probably go.
- Yes.

51
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,970
Hey, it's a promise.

52
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:43,590
Then I'll see you
at school tomorrow.

53
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:45,940
Sure.

54
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,020
Hey, but Kang Woo is...

55
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:04,770
It looks like...

56
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:06,430
Mr. Lee is also...

57
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:07,780
Exactly.

58
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,140
He could be.

59
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:15,370
Anyway, what happened?

60
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,209
Did you get him to sign it?

61
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,590
Seo Yeon came to your house
because of work.

62
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:31,160
I get that. And...

63
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,659
you two had a drink while talking.

64
00:04:33,659 --> 00:04:35,770
I get that too.
But why are you like this?

65
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:39,030
Hey.

66
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,900
Hey, let's go.

67
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:46,909
He won't stop
once he starts doing this.

68
00:04:46,909 --> 00:04:48,580
It's better
to just leave him like this.

69
00:04:53,409 --> 00:04:54,409
Kang Woo.

70
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,920
If the paper looks fine,
can you sign it off already?

71
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,130
Ms. Joo looked very worried.

72
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,920
Okay?

73
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:13,670
This is humiliating.

74
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,300
This is...

75
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:21,040
so humiliating.

76
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:27,520
Darn it, it's so humiliating.

77
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:34,130
Man. It's so embarrassing.

78
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:36,630
My gosh.

79

Darn it.

80
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:11,000
Did you catch a cold?

81
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:13,130
Something like that.

82
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:18,140
You always get ill around this time.

83
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:21,210
I'm fine.

84
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:31,280
Hey, Won Seok.

85
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:35,190
Does your body also change...

86
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:38,350
when you're with women?

87
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:42,220
I mean, I'm saying...

88
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:44,830
you are not interested in...

89
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,090
women's body...

90
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:49,140
or getting their hearts.

91
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:52,940
Yet can you still show
physical change?

92
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:02,020
- Why?
- I'm just curious.

93
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:07,520
If I am stimulated
with an outside force,

94
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,090
it can happen at times.

95
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,460
Oh, right. Thanks.

96
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:25,770
Explain.

97
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,970
I'm sorry. It was an emergency,
so I had to borrow your car.

98
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:33,750
That's not what I mean. Is this
about the guy you talked about?

99
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:35,880
The guy who flirted with you
pretending to be straight?

100
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:38,090
- What?
- The physical change.

101
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:41,980
Are you sure he's gay?

102
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,090
He said so himself.

103
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:52,030
Why would he lie
about such a matter?

104
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:02,600
Who are you?

105
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:05,840
Oh, my.

106
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:23,500
Gosh, I'm tired.

107
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:25,860
That's right.

108
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,500
Kang Woo and I...

109
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:29,860
are partners.

110
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:31,070
Right.

111
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:33,730
Kang Woo would kill me.

112
00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:38,299
Then again,

113
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:41,880
Kang Woo has no prejudice
against those people.

114
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:44,840
Also, I did it for his own good.

115
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:51,130
What do I do?

116
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:54,700
No, don't worry.

117
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:59,320
It's okay. Everything's okay.

118
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,470
No, it isn't.

119

your dismissal all the same.

Thank you so much, Kang Woo.

I mean,
I sincerely appreciate it, Mr. Lee.

138

What happened yesterday
probably couldn't have been helped.

139

It's best not to bring it up.

What?

142
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:49,660
She doesn't even care about
what happened yesterday?

so cool about this situation?

Am I the only one
who's bothered by it?

146
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,070
Is it because of
what happened in the past?

147
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:04,120
You didn't ask me out

152

I think she was going to say
something more.

153
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,160
Of course. You can never
hang up on me like that.

- Watch out!

169
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,920
- Catch it!
- Oh, no!

170
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,530
- Here you go!
- Catch it!

171
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:56,560
Let's go!

172
00:12:58,370 --> 00:12:59,370
Here we go.

173
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:00,610
- Oh, no!
- Gosh!

174
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,200
You're supposed to protect me.
Don't dodge the ball!

175
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,610
Here you go.

176
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,490
Can't you do better?

177
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,220
That was close!

178
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:16,550
Catch it!

179
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,320
- Let's go!
- What is it?

180
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,450
Didn't he get hit by the ball?

181
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,770
Hey!

182
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,970
An idol should protect his face.

183
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,000
- Get behind me.
- What?

184
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,660
You stand behind me!

185
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:24,150
You never said a female player
can't protect her partner.

186
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:26,780
Well, you're right.

187
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:30,230
Okay. Lee Joo Hee and
Joo Seo Jun get full marks.

188
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:31,400
Give them a big hand!

189
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:47,040
Well, good job.

190
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,910
Thanks to you,
I got full marks in PE.

191
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:51,390
Thanks to you,
I'm taking private lessons.

192
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,990
- Let's call it even.
- Hey, that's...

193
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:55,860
I'm not being sarcastic.
I really am grateful.

194
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:58,730
I've never taken
private lessons before.

195
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:02,920
Thanks. Let's study hard.

196
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:09,690
What's with her?
Why is she acting so cool?

197
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,200
A blind date?

198
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:14,740
Aren't we too young for that?

199
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,780
Why are you so naive?

200
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:18,200
We're 30.

201
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,980
We're definitely ready
to go on blind dates.

202
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:23,020
Mascara.

203
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:28,890
What about Lee Kang Woo
and Park Hyun Soo...

204
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:31,260
as well as guys number 3, 4, 5,

205
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:32,390
and six?

206
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:35,000
Hey, that plan got canceled
at Park Hyun Soo.

207
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,400
Do you know what he does?

208
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:39,500
He works as a janitor
at Seo Jun's management agency.

209
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,870
This is lip gloss.

210
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:43,830
Oh, I'm sorry.

211
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:48,200
Just give it to me.

212
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:51,170
In addition, Lee Kang Woo,
Park Hyun Soo, and Lee Min Hyuk...

213
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:53,280
belong to the other world.

214
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,720
And so would all the guys they know.

215
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,350
Anyway, Mr. Lee really surprised me.

216
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:02,760
I was sure he had feelings for...

217
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,030
Never mind.

218
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:09,230
Anyway, Mom arranged
this blind date a month ago.

219
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:11,400
The guy's family runs a huge
barbecue restaurant in Gangnam.

220
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,790
To make big money,
you have to sell food.

221
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:16,030
That's what Shinhwa Food does too.

222
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:19,010
Are you so desperate to get married?

223
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:20,510
Wouldn't it be a shame...

224
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:23,200
if you never got to experience
what most people do?

225
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:29,220
Don't worry. It's not like
I'll get married anytime soon.

226
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:34,150
Listen. You'll come with me
and keep an eye on me.

227
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:35,760
If I order a drink
topped with whipped cream,

228
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,080
call me 20 minutes later.

229
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,780
- Why?
- If I liked the guy,

230
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:41,400
I wouldn't be devouring
whipped cream in front of him.

231
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:45,230
Hopefully, the guy will take a hint
and realize I don't like him.

232
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:46,970
What if you like him?

233
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:49,400
What do you think? You'll have to
take a hint and disappear.

234
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:52,110
Why do you think I'm meeting him
at a cafe in an expensive hotel?

235
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:55,570
It's because all you have to do is
take the elevator up and...

236
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:58,350
You'll be meeting this guy
for the first time!

237
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:01,540
I can't believe you.
You're out of your mind.

238
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:09,050
Welcome.

239
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,630
Right here.

240
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:19,369
Hello, my son.

241
00:17:19,369 --> 00:17:20,819
I didn't know you were already here.

242
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,560
You told me that it's an etiquette
to be 10 minutes late to meetings.

243
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:26,900
My gosh. There's always
a traffic jam around this time.

244
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:30,130
By the way, I heard that you're not
going to school these days.

245
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:32,370
I'm making sure that I do
my duty as the chief director.

246
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:34,450
Regardless of your performance
in your position,

247
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:36,020
you must be diligent,

248
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,810
so people under you
can learn from you.

249
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:40,520
Acting as their boss
when I'm way younger than them...

250
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:43,350
I'm sure it's not something
they look forward to.

251
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:44,780
I need to go to school
just enough...

252
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:46,490
and know when to leave.

253
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:49,530
No, no.

254
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:51,270
Let's just order later.

255
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:56,670
What is it?

256
00:17:56,770 --> 00:17:59,510
What? What are you talking about?

257
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:00,830
There must be someone else
coming today.

258
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:04,330
No way. What are you talking about?

259
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:06,780
I can go on the date.

260
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:08,250
- What?
- What?

261
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,110
I will go on that date.

262
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:14,080
You mean it, right?

263
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:17,280
You can't run away
after saying that you would.

264
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,730
Come on.
Have you been fooled all your life?

265
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:26,290
Right. I haven't dated other women
for too long.

266
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:28,740
That's why someone
like Joo Seo Yeon...

267
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:32,860
Wait. I need to go to the restroom.

268
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:34,330
- You got it, right?
- Yes.

269
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:36,070
If it's a drink with whipped cream,
I'll call you after 20 minutes.

270
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:37,870
- Right?
- See you later.

271
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:45,950
Yes.

272
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,050
I'm on a blind date.

273
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:52,580
Gosh. So people actually
do go on blind dates.

274
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:54,190
He's the grandson
of Shinhwa Food's chairwoman.

275
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:55,960
I should do a good job.

276
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,120
I heard that
he never goes on blind dates.

277
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,470
I'm going to hang up.
I need to go now.

278
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:01,860
Okay.

279
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:12,680
Was that about Lee Kang Woo?

280
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:14,520
Then, what about Park Hyun Soo?

281
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:26,580
Right here. Hello.

282
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:33,000
Thank you for making the trip.
Please have a seat.

283
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:35,500
She was really talking
about Lee Kang Woo.

284
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:40,210
You are much prettier in person.

285
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:42,370
Thank you. He's handsome, too.

286
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:43,980
Gosh. You think so?

287
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:46,780
I'm not saying this
because he's my son.

288
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:48,140
But he's good-looking, right?

289
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:51,750
People think that he's an actor.

290
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:54,880
Shouldn't we give them
some privacy now?

291
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,020
No, why don't you join us
for dinner?

292
00:19:57,020 --> 00:20:00,820
Gosh. You're so kind-hearted too.

293
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:04,430
- No, we should get going.
- Yes.

294
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,790
We should go, Mother.

295
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,770
Let me walk you to your car.

296
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:09,290
That's all right.

297
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:11,560
I can walk just fine on my way.
There's no need.

298
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,330
Let's go.

299
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:14,830
Enjoy your time.

300
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:16,940
- Let's go, Mother.
- Okay.

301
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:19,870
They make a nice couple, don't they?

302
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,500
Do you not like the food?

303
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,740
No, this is really good.

304
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:49,130
But why...

305
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:53,800
It's nothing. Please eat.

306
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:32,220
Why is he making that face?

307
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:35,460
Why is he on a blind date
when he's with Park Hyun Soo?

308
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:41,620
They were so in love
with each other.

309
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:43,500
How foolish.

310
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:48,770
Excuse me.

311
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:51,470
Do you need anything?

312
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:54,170
I came here by mistake.

313
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:55,370
I'm sorry.

314
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,530
I guess you like sweets.

315
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:14,380
Yes. Well, yes.

316
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:16,930
I get rid of my stress with sweets.

317
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:20,090
My gosh, but you still manage
to stay in shape.

318
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,630
That's great.

319
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:26,360
Goodness.

320
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,980
Where on earth is Seo Yeon?

321
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:30,480
You know what?

322
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:33,370
I've never been on a blind date
with women over 29 years old.

323
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:36,520
Women over 30...
How should I put it?

324
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,420
I couldn't see them as women.

325
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:44,260
But you have really great skin
given that you're 30.

326
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:45,930
And your figure...

327
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:48,260
You must take good care of yourself.

328
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:49,260
Yes.

329
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:50,820
You take care of yourself.

330
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:52,970
That's great.

331
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:57,770
You like women who take care of
themselves, but why didn't you...

332
00:22:57,770 --> 00:23:00,240
No. Men are different.

333
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,680
Don't you know the saying
that men are like wine?

334
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:05,070
I don't.

335
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,420
The older they get,

336
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,310
the deeper their flavor...

337
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:13,750
and scent get...

338
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:15,880
just like wine.

339
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:20,850
What a great line.

340
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:26,320
My gosh.

341
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:32,740
Why? You've never seen
a woman eat before?

342
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:37,630
That's sexy.

343
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:39,950
I just decided...

344
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:41,810
that I'm going to date you.

345
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:49,810
Wine, my foot.

346
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:52,530
Korean people ought
to drink makgeolli. Wine? Whatever.

347
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:56,590
If makgeolli gets old, it stinks.
You jerk.

348
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:59,470
Hey, where have you been?

349
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:01,470
I'm sorry. What happened?

350
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,440
Are you all right?

351
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:04,970
Whatever. I took care of it.

352
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:06,360
So where did you go?

353
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,030
- Lee Kang Woo.
- What?

354
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,750
He's on a blind date.

355
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:14,540
He looked really sad.

356
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:16,920
Even I thought she was a nice lady.

357
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:21,110
But Lee Kang Woo seemed
to have a hard time.

358
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,580
I guess he's there against his will.

359
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:25,280
Then, do you think his rich family
will understand his preference?

360
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,280
I doubt that
he came out to his family.

361
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,760
He'll have to live his whole life,
concealing who he really is.

362
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,590
Park Hyun Soo said profusely
that we should never tell...

363
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:35,770
Lee Kang Woo that we know
about their relationship.

364
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,890
So you should pretend
that you don't know anything.

365
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:41,530
He can't tell people...

366
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:43,830
that he's in love with him.

367
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:46,710
What a sad life he has.

368
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,220
What is it?
What don't you like about her?

369
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:51,810
She's too perfect.

370
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:53,220
I just have a lot on my mind.

371
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:55,550
What? What do you have on your mind?

372
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:57,020
Let's talk some other time.

373
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,580
I'm driving. Bye.

374
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,990
Kang Woo.

375
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:26,110
I'm going crazy. Goodness.

376
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,990
I really must be going crazy.

377
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:13,500
What? You were real?

378
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:19,910
Here.

379
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:23,870
I wanted to thank you...

380
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:25,950
for approving the budget
and cleaning the shirt.

381
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,010
I was out on a walk and they were
selling this on the street,

382
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:29,020
so I bought you one.

383
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,350
It's a grass head.

384
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:42,700
Its hair grows tall like grass.

385
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:51,000
You don't like it?

386
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:54,510
As soon as I saw it, I thought
it resembled you, so I bought it.

387
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,370
There are animal heads too.

388
00:26:57,370 --> 00:26:59,410
If you don't like that one,
should I exchange it?

389
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:08,660
I should have just bought
a watermelon.

390
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:09,880
It's an awful gift, right?

391
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:13,030
I'll get you
some watermelon next time...

392
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:20,770
I'll choose.

393
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:25,360
I'll go take a look
and choose one myself.

394
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:30,980
Hey.

395
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,680
Is he gone already?

396
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:39,380
Give it to me.
I'll exchange it next time.

397
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:46,690
Don't touch Mr. Potato
without permission.

398
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:50,200
What? You already named it?

399
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,780
Are you okay?

400
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:14,640
I mean, I was wondering
if you spent a good day today.

401
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,350
This thing looks similar...

402
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:21,660
to me?

403
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:23,620
What?

404
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:31,240
Yes, it looks like
how you looked in middle school.

405
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:34,060
You were really cute back then.

406
00:28:34,770 --> 00:28:36,240
When did you grow up so much?

407
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:39,040
When did you grow so tall, Kang Woo?

408
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:46,140
All right. Let's seal it.

409
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,430
Goodness.

410
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:58,200
Hey, you're really tall now.

411
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:09,180
When did you...

412
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,920
When did you get...

413
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:26,050
so close to me?

414
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:27,930
Seo Yeon.

415
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:29,230
Why?

416
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,500
Let's go.

417
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:36,670
Hey.

418
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:49,390
My mind is full of thoughts.

419
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,970
- Like what?
- Let's put an end...

420
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,790
to what we discussed last time.

421
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:01,730
Love...

422
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:08,340
My feelings for Seo Yeon.

423
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:10,200
Oh, love...

424
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,020
That feeling.

425
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:19,760
Is there a way...

426
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:23,090
for me to be sure of that feeling
other than something vague?

427
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:24,090
I'm not sure.

428
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:27,330
That's a particularly
difficult and complicated feeling.

429
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,590
When you don't see her,
you miss her.

430
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:30,800
You wonder if she's ill.

431
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:33,030
You want to know who she's with.

432
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,870
Love... No.

433
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:40,080
Do you know that there's
another name for that feeling?

434
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:43,570
- Jealousy.
- Jealousy?

435
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:45,180
Do you feel frustrated...

436
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:47,820
and oddly angry
when she's with another man?

437
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:50,350
In that case, it's 100 percent.

438
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,290
Frustration and anger?

439
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:12,870
Did you remove a mole?

440
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:17,180
There's a mole in this picture,

441
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,210
but you don't have one now.

442
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:24,180
Yes, I did.

443
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:39,370
You look much better.

444
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:50,270
When you don't see her,
you miss her.

445
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:54,210
Do I miss her when I don't see her?

446
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:57,240
I don't miss her that much.

447
00:31:57,780 --> 00:32:01,520
It has been 15 hours,
8 minutes, and 23 seconds,

448
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,020
but I'm completely fine.

449
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,670
I've been counting the hours
down to the second?

450
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:12,370
Did I really?

451
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,680
What is she doing right now?

452
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:21,270
She's probably at work,

453
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:23,500
so I'm sure
she isn't with another guy.

454
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:25,940
Did she get hurt...

455
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,710
when I threw her out?

456
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:30,210
You wonder if she's ill.

457
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:32,420
You want to know...

458
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,890
who she's with.

459
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:38,720
When it rains

460
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,800
And music is playing

461
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,900
I don't want to know.

462
00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:43,720
I'm not curious.

463
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:47,610
I'm not curious of Seo Yeon!
I'm not!

464
00:32:47,610 --> 00:32:50,210
No!

465
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:51,400
Hey, move.

466
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:57,270
Are you okay? I'm sorry.

467
00:32:57,710 --> 00:32:59,050
Get on my back.

468
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:00,620
I'm sorry.

469
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:02,210
[Health Office]

470
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:05,990
Mr. Lee! Mr. Lee!

471
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:07,890
- Ms. Joo.
- It's an emergency.

472
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:14,490
All right.

473
00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:17,170
How do you feel?

474
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:24,270
It really hurt a moment ago,
but it's fine now.

475
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:26,080
It looks like
your muscles got tight.

476
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,150
Is he all right?

477
00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:29,550
He is.

478
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:31,870
Don't strain your knees
for a few days.

479
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,080
Yes.

480
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:35,340
Thank you. Thank you.

481
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:41,590
Thank you.

482
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:59,930
That stings!

483
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,550
I'm fine.

484
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:07,120
You aren't fine yet.
It might get infected.

485
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:16,489
Ms. Joo, you're still so passionate
when it comes to your students.

486
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,820
I mean, when I first came here.

487
00:34:24,330 --> 00:34:26,489
I once came for a tour after
I heard the former school doctor...

488
00:34:26,489 --> 00:34:28,130
would be moving abroad.

489
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:31,699
To be honest,
I didn't care much about school.

490
00:34:31,699 --> 00:34:33,409
Move! Move aside!

491
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,310
It wasn't like she hurt her leg
like the boy today.

492
00:34:39,850 --> 00:34:42,489
She just had a double nosebleed

Well, they might
look like grown-ups,

00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:00,130
but they're still kids.

497
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:02,540
Even adults get scared
when they get hurt.

498

It must be worse for them.

You said even adults get scared

and oddly angry...

When I looked out the window,
I saw your car.

- Right.

Why didn't you call us
that you were coming in today?

You should have called us
in advance.

Why?

Am I not allowed to come here?

What were you going to do
without me?

514
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:24,490
I can come here because I work here!

Get out. Get out of my office!

when she's with another man?

520

In that case, it's 100 percent.

Hey, cut this nonsense and go poop!

I'll compensate for it.

It was partially my fault too.

It was both of our faults.
No need to compensate for the car.

658
00:49:47,610 --> 00:49:51,580
imagine that what you truly want
is waiting at the finishing line...

659
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:54,850
whether it's an object, a person,
or a situation.

660
00:49:55,420 --> 00:49:57,360
If you run like crazy,
focused on that,

661
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:58,770
it's game over then.

662
00:50:00,970 --> 00:50:02,040
Did you just laugh?

663
00:50:02,330 --> 00:50:03,900
I won the silver medal
at the national track meet...

664
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:05,160
with this method.

665
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:07,130
Okay. Good job.

666
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:10,640
Kang Woo.

667
00:50:11,870 --> 00:50:13,370
You should just run too.

668
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:15,810
Don't think about anything else.

669
00:50:15,810 --> 00:50:18,520
Just focus on that
at the finishing line.

670
00:51:40,130 --> 00:51:41,200
Hello?

671
00:51:46,810 --> 00:51:48,040
What are you doing?

672
00:51:48,510 --> 00:51:49,810
I'm going to run.

673
00:51:51,450 --> 00:51:52,870
Just like you told me,

674
00:51:58,250 --> 00:51:59,520
I'll only focus on that.

675
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:21,480
I have something to tell you.

676
00:52:22,010 --> 00:52:23,750
Come to this address by 10 p.m.

677
00:52:29,310 --> 00:52:31,020
This is the right address.

678
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:47,770
Kang Woo.

679
00:52:48,970 --> 00:52:50,130
Kang Woo.

680
00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:53,240
What is it?

681
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:16,700
What's all this?

682
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:17,770
Do you like it?

683
00:53:17,890 --> 00:53:20,540
I could have rented
the whole amusement park.

684
00:53:20,540 --> 00:53:22,440
But I thought
that you would prefer this...

685
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:24,540
over amusement park rides.

686
00:53:24,540 --> 00:53:26,510
Why? What is it?

687
00:53:29,570 --> 00:53:31,100
Are you going to give this to me?

688
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:33,610
No, it's for your track team.

689
00:53:34,050 --> 00:53:35,220
It's for them.

690
00:53:35,490 --> 00:53:38,140
You can say that the chief director
is sponsoring their uniforms.

691
00:53:38,140 --> 00:53:39,260
For my track team?

692
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:45,500
Is this for my team?

693
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:48,650
My gosh, the color is pretty.

694
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:53,560
But why all of a sudden?

695
00:53:55,390 --> 00:53:57,970
It's a bribe.
I want to leave a good impression.

696
00:53:58,560 --> 00:53:59,570
What?

697
00:54:09,290 --> 00:54:12,150
I think it started
a very long time ago.

698
00:54:12,810 --> 00:54:15,020
But like a fool, I just realized it.

699
00:54:16,190 --> 00:54:17,260
I...

700
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:20,500
never needed other women
in my life for the longest time.

701
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:23,530
What? He doesn't need women?

702
00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:27,300
What's going on?

703
00:54:27,630 --> 00:54:29,630
Did he figure out that I know?

704
00:54:29,710 --> 00:54:32,570
Darn it. Park Hyun Soo
didn't want him to find out.

705
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:36,280
Except for you.

706
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:39,780
I hope...

707
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:44,750
you can stay by my side, Seo Yeon.

708
00:54:45,610 --> 00:54:46,720
Me?

709
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:49,690
Yes. You.

710
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:53,500
When I'm with you,

711
00:54:54,030 --> 00:54:56,530
I always embarrass
and humiliate myself.

712
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:57,970
But...

713
00:54:59,970 --> 00:55:01,590
I think...

714
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:04,400
I can only be myself
when you're by my side.

715
00:55:05,670 --> 00:55:07,040
So Seo Yeon,

716
00:55:08,870 --> 00:55:11,100
can you stay by my side?

717
00:55:20,260 --> 00:55:23,760
I get it. You need a cover.

718
00:55:24,190 --> 00:55:25,890
You need a woman,

719
00:55:25,890 --> 00:55:28,060
so you don't have to go
on blind dates anymore.

720
00:55:30,270 --> 00:55:32,440
What do you think about that?

721
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:36,860
Does Hyun Soo know...

722
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:39,400
what you're doing right now?

723
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:41,440
Hyun Soo?

724
00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:45,640
I don't think it's right for me...

725
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:47,840
to get in the middle
of Hyun Soo and you.

726
00:55:54,490 --> 00:55:57,920
Wait, do you have other feelings...

727
00:55:58,820 --> 00:56:01,730
for Hyun Soo?

728
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:05,160
Yes.

729
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:07,800
I'm sorry,

730
00:56:08,630 --> 00:56:10,470
but Hyun Soo...

731
00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:12,160
told me everything.

732
00:56:14,810 --> 00:56:16,100
Since when...

733
00:56:16,210 --> 00:56:18,550
did you like Hyun Soo?

734
00:56:18,550 --> 00:56:21,810
Since when did I know?

735
00:56:23,250 --> 00:56:26,560
Well, actually,
when we had just met again,

736
00:56:26,580 --> 00:56:29,880
I saw you two together
and realized it.

737
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:31,290
I knew you two were dating.

738
00:56:31,290 --> 00:56:32,890
Then from the start...

739
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:35,420
I never had a chance.

740
00:56:35,620 --> 00:56:36,700
Yes.

741
00:56:37,970 --> 00:56:39,800
From the start,

742
00:56:39,890 --> 00:56:41,830
I knew you were dating Hyun Soo.

743
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:03,650
What brings you here at this hour?

744
00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:08,730
Hey, man. What are you doing?

745
00:57:08,820 --> 00:57:10,560
You darned jerk!

746
00:57:12,540 --> 00:57:14,830
You little jerk!

747
00:57:14,830 --> 00:57:18,600
Hey, man. Have you gone insane? Hey!

748
00:57:21,130 --> 00:57:22,340
You must be insane!

749
00:57:25,910 --> 00:57:28,610
Hey, you! Go away!

750
00:57:28,810 --> 00:57:30,080
Go away!

751
00:57:31,690 --> 00:57:33,610
Hey, stop! Stop!

752
00:57:33,990 --> 00:57:35,820
What? What is it?

753
00:57:35,820 --> 00:57:38,620
These pajamas? Are you
doing this to me over these pajamas?

754
00:57:38,620 --> 00:57:41,650
Seo Yeon... Seo Yeon likes you!

755
00:57:41,650 --> 00:57:43,890
What is this nonsense? We never
had any contact! Why would she?

756
00:57:43,890 --> 00:57:45,000
I don't know!

757
00:57:45,470 --> 00:57:48,130
Okay, fine.
Let's say that she likes me.

758
00:57:48,130 --> 00:57:50,440
But why is that a reason
for you to do this to me? Why?

759
00:57:59,140 --> 00:58:00,310
Kang Woo.

760
00:58:02,110 --> 00:58:03,750
Wait, do you...

761
00:58:14,350 --> 00:58:16,620
Wait, what's going on?

762
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:20,700
Wait, she knows Kang Woo
and I are in this relationship,

763
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:22,710
yet she said she likes me?

764
00:58:23,970 --> 00:58:25,900
Is she crazy?

765
00:58:39,460 --> 00:58:40,790
Kang Woo!

766
00:58:46,150 --> 00:58:47,700
What's with them?

767
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:49,800
I thought the track team issue
was all resolved.

768
00:59:02,810 --> 00:59:06,170
I don't like you
because you're ugly and fat.

769
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:13,650
Can you stay by my side?

770
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:18,620
I think I can only be myself
when you're by my side.

771
00:59:20,030 --> 00:59:21,320
I don't think it's right for me...

772
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:23,300
to get in the middle
of Hyun Soo and you.

773
00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:25,270
- Wait, do you...
- I'm sorry,

774
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:27,060
but Hyun Soo...

775
00:59:33,510 --> 00:59:34,570
Wait.

776
00:59:35,310 --> 00:59:38,010
It's not like he really liked me
back then and even now.

777
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:39,980
Why does he show such a face?

778
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:45,880
Kang Woo, why do you
make me so concerned?

779
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:55,320
Who is it?

780
01:00:05,870 --> 01:00:06,940
Kang Woo.

781
01:00:07,630 --> 01:00:09,780
I think there's no reason
to not do it.

782
01:00:10,900 --> 01:00:12,170
Pretending to be
your fake girlfriend.

783
01:00:14,810 --> 01:00:18,290
I accept your offer.

784
01:00:19,810 --> 01:00:20,990
What offer?

785
01:00:20,990 --> 01:00:22,530
You said I'm the only one.

786
01:00:22,730 --> 01:00:25,320
You said you can be your true self
only when I am with you.

787
01:00:26,620 --> 01:00:28,920
You must've been really desperate.

788
01:00:30,420 --> 01:00:31,470
Let's do this.

789
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:35,330
What about Hyun Soo?

790
01:00:36,630 --> 01:00:39,310
Forget about him.
I'm sure he'll understand.

791
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:45,810
My pride.

792
01:00:48,020 --> 01:00:49,950
This really kills my pride, but...

793
01:00:52,110 --> 01:00:54,650
Yes, it can happen.

794
01:00:54,650 --> 01:00:58,030
We can try it out. If it doesn't
seem to work, we can stop...

795
01:01:01,390 --> 01:01:02,620
I think I'm going to die...

796
01:01:04,060 --> 01:01:05,120
of...

797
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:07,390
happiness.

798
01:01:16,250 --> 01:01:17,340
I'll be good to you.

799
01:01:19,550 --> 01:01:22,340
Oh, okay. I'll be good to you too.

800
01:02:14,090 --> 01:02:15,770
[Love With Flaws]

801
01:02:15,770 --> 01:02:17,160
- What will you do with Kang Woo?
- Kang Woo!

802
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:18,970
Is he your friend who's a guy?

803
01:02:18,970 --> 01:02:19,980
I'm her boyfriend!

804
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:20,980
- What?
- What?

805
01:02:20,980 --> 01:02:22,100
He can't be your type.

806
01:02:22,100 --> 01:02:23,280
You two aren't
really dating, are you?

807
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:25,370
Kang Woo and Hyun Soo aren't dating?

808
01:02:25,370 --> 01:02:26,720
Hyun Soo!

809
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:28,720
I know you two plotted this
to embarrass me.

810
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:31,020
Did you think I was that low?

811
01:02:31,020 --> 01:02:32,960
Don't you know why she got so drunk?

812
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:34,850
Wait, do you like...

813
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:35,910
Ask.
