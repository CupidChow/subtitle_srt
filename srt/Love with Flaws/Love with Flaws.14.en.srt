3
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,800
- You crazy idiot.
- What?

4
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,610
How do you call yourself a human?

5
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:50,270
Are you talking to me?

6
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:53,110
I...

7
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:55,970
I couldn't hold myself back.

8
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,110
I shouldn't be doing this to you.

9
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,280
I have no right to love you...

10
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:04,650
or be loved by you.

11
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:06,360
What do you mean?

12
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,460
I heard...

13
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:09,560
about your parents'...

14
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:13,530
accident.

15
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:16,390
What?

16
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:17,700
I'm sorry.

17
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:20,430
It's all my fault.

18
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:29,780
Kang Woo!

19
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,009
Lee Kang Woo!

20
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:34,979
Open the door.

21
00:01:35,289 --> 00:01:37,789
Let's talk, okay?

22
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:40,820
Kang Woo!

23
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:50,640
Who was it?

24
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,170
Who told him?

25
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,310
Which one of you...

26
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:59,570
told him about my mom and dad? Who?

27
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,670
- Was it you?
- No.

28
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:07,480
- It was you, wasn't it?
- No!

29
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,919
I was going to, but I didn't.

30
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,890
Your call cannot be connected.
Please leave...

31
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:16,790
Should I just tell everything
to Kang Woo and die in action?

32
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:29,260
No, Seo Yeon told me not to.

33
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:32,940
I'll stop. Let's not do it.

34
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:43,950
Really?

35
00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:48,579
Hey! Did I ever do anything
you asked me not to do?

36
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:51,200
- No.
- See?

37
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:55,170
What's that?

38
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,540
What is this?

39
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:06,770
I brought those for her...

40
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,640
because I knew she missed him.

41
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:13,670
You're the culprit!

42
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:18,890
You fool.

43
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:20,890
She took these pictures
right in front of his house.

44
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:23,420
That means she went to his house!

45
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:27,700
Jang Mi.

46
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:31,040
I just gave him the pictures
and came back.

47
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:52,820
Who is it?

48
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,760
I'm here regarding Seo Yeon.

49
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:04,360
Hey, wait!

50
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,700
I don't like that guy,

51
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:19,110
but it's much better than
seeing Seo Yeon sad.

52
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:21,720
Jang Mi...

53
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,480
You went that far for me?

54
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,260
She sounds like a stalker.

55
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,230
Then...

56
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,760
how in the world did he find out?

57
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,970
Who else knows other than us?

58
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,230
Well...

59
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:50,110
That means it was
either you or Won Seok.

60
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:52,220
Where are you going?

61
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:53,850
To see Won Seok.

62
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,440
I want to ask him for the reason.

63
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,980
You don't even need to ask.

64
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:59,750
Won Seok obviously
took care of your burden.

65
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:02,360
- What?
- Then were you going to...

66
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,120
date him once again...

67
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,050
without telling him
what happened to you?

68
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:07,050
I...

69
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,290
I don't know about that.

70
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:13,430
I haven't thought of that.

71
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,340
Just as you made your choice
after a long thought,

72
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:18,500
he has a right to make a choice
after thinking about it.

73
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:22,980
If that accident is
too much for him to handle,

74
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,610
and if he gives up on you
in the end...

75
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:32,180
Even if that's the case,
it's still not your fault.

76
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,880
It means he just wasn't
right for you to begin with.

77
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:36,750
Okay?

78
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,790
I have no right to love you...

79
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,900
or be loved by you.

80
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,600
Why are you making such a face?

81
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,270
Why should you?

82
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,590
- Yes?
- It's me. Joo Won Seok.

83
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:56,909
Is it true?

84
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:01,210
Was it really because of me?

85
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:05,170
Did I cause that accident...

86
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,240
for Seo Yeon's parents?

87
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:12,520
Get a hold of yourself.

88
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:14,750
I never said
you caused the accident.

89
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:17,050
I said Seo Yeon is
heartbroken because of you.

90
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:26,400
Seo Yeon is crying because of you.

91
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,170
Do you get it?

92
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:35,080
Tell me...

93
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,440
where the accident...

94
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,880
broke out.

95
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:50,420
How dare I want to be with you?

96
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,270
How dare I?

97
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:14,150
He's probably up, right?

98
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,050
Oh, right.

99
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,250
He lost his phone.

00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:44,870
- Hello?
- Mr. Lee?

102
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:47,920
Yes, this is Mr. Lee's phone,

103
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,520
but I'm not him.

104
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,660
I just found this phone.

105
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:54,680
He's on his way to pick it up.

106
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,690
You sound like a great guy.

107
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:59,100
You found his phone for him
in this day and age.

108
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:01,430
All things and even people...

109
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:03,470
belong in their rightful place.

110

You're too right.

111
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,630
Anyway, you have such a great voice.

112
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:11,810
You sound like a handsome guy too.

113
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,110
Thank you.

114
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:17,000
You have a nice voice as well.

115
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:22,090
All right, then.
I'll call him later again.

116
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:24,220
Goodbye.

118
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:48,680
Excuse me. Are you the one
who found the phone?

119
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,050
Yes.

120

Are you Mr. Lee Kang Woo?

00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:55,010
What? No, I'm his friend.

122
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,380
I see.

123
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,510
Here.

124
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:04,300
Thank you. How should I repay you?

125
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:07,570
You don't need to.
I'm just returning it to its owner.

126

If you haven't eaten yet...

127
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:14,030
Shall we go, then?

128
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,480
Are you sure that's enough?

129
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,650
There's a restaurant over there.

130
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:37,600
This is enough.

131
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:40,430
Then let me give you compensation.

132
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:45,130
I may not have any money,
but I do have a sense of honor.

133
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:46,940
All right, then.

Leave it there.

Kang Woo.

140
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:24,580
Don't call me. I don't deserve
to be called by you.

141
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:30,480
How dare I?

00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,720
How could I?

00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:38,820
I can't. I just can't.

Seo Yeon.

146
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,330
How did you come in?

147
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:52,600
Did my hand open the door
for her subconsciously?

148
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:56,470
Hey, why haven't you been
letting her in?

149
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:57,980
You little...

150
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:00,440
Come here.

151
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,680
Stop it!

Seo Yeon and Kang Woo
are making me go crazy.

154
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,810
Look at me, will you?

155
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,580
Talk.

156
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,110
You came because you needed to talk.

157
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:42,380
I'm sorry...

158
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,190
for acting selfishly.

159
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:51,800
I'm sorry for only thinking
about myself.

160
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:54,230
Why didn't you tell me?

161
00:12:57,330 --> 00:12:58,490
I was scared.

162
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,530
I was scared you'd act this way.

163
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:08,550
Imagine how scared I must've been.

164
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,980
I was scared you'd abandon me.

165
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:14,270
After you actually abandoned me,

166
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:17,610
imagine how scared I must've been.

167
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,200
I'm sorry.

168
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,120
But what's scarier is that...

169
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:29,470
I can understand now.

170
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,840
You need...

171
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:35,400
to abandon me.

172
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:39,870
It's not like that.

173
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:41,480
It's not because of you.

174
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,180
Are you sure? Not even one percent?

175
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,080
If you were certain,
then you wouldn't have...

176
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:51,960

177
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:55,380
Kang Woo.

178
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,860
Go.

179
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,970
Leave now.

180
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:40,340
Thankfully, it's not raining today.

181
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:47,270
Are you on your way
to his house or are you coming back?

182
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,710
I'm in the middle.

183
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:54,850
I'm debating whether to go back...

184
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:56,690
or just go home.

185
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:05,730
Do you want something sweet?

186
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,610
You bought all of that?

187
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,350
I didn't know
which flavor you'd like.

188
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:25,770
This isn't food.

189
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:28,320
This isn't your dinner.

190
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:53,340
Why are you staring at me like that?

191
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:00,480
To be frank,

192
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:04,820
I really didn't like you
in the beginning.

193
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:11,090
Is it because I told on you
regarding that flower pot?

194
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:12,520
Even before then.

195
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:15,120
Why?

196
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:18,260
Because you were handsome.

197
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:22,230
Don't you like handsome guys?

198
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:24,630
What? Me?

199
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,810
You said looks mattered to you.

200
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:30,140
What do you look for in a guy?

201
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,180
Looks matter a lot to me.

202
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:40,380
I meant that I didn't like
handsome guys.

203
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,800
I guess that could mean that
as well.

204
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,340
You're truly different
from the others.

205
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:56,310
Most people wonder why
I don't like handsome men.

206
00:16:58,130 --> 00:16:59,130
I'm curious too.

207
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:02,210
It's not about your dislike
regarding handsome men.

208
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:04,480
I want to know
how you started liking him.

209
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:07,680
Kang Woo is handsome.

210
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:09,880
So why do you like him?

211
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,960
Perhaps, it's because of you.

212
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:24,390
It's because you, a handsome man,

213
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:28,740
comforted me when things were tough.

214
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,370
I told you that
we're not having dinner,

215
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:41,320
so why do you keep wanting
to end things?

216
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:44,050
Look, I am...

217
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:45,360
I like you.

218
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:51,860
What? That was so out of the blue.

219
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:53,150
I can't lie.

220
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,160
I can't say that I don't like you
when I do.

221
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:58,690
I just can't help it.

222
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:05,510
When I say that I like someone,
I truly mean it.

223
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:16,820
But why does someone like you
like me?

224
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:18,860
Then...

225
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,590
why don't you like me?

226
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:26,390
That's because...

227
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,300
You can't explain it, right?

228
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:32,340
The same goes for me.

229
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:35,340
This is just how my heart feels.

230
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,170
I should go. I'm a bit late.

231
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,110
I'm sorry for taking your time.

232
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:46,780
You were
on your way somewhere, right?

233
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:49,750
Yes. I was going to argue
with Kang Woo.

234
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,020
I see.

235
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:52,990
What?

236
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,620
- Is that for me?
- It's mine.

237
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:02,720
- Give me one.
- No.

238
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:05,130
Why are you here then?

239
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:06,660
Weren't you begging me
to come before?

240
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,840
What is it? Have things changed?

241
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:14,310
Ms. Joo was here, right?

242
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:16,350
How do you know that?

Let's make it clear.

What about you?

00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:28,530
Why are you hesitant?

What are you saying?

You're making a fool of yourself
when you were dealt a better hand.

That's so annoying.

How could you say that to my face?

255

Are you here
to pick a fight with me?

Yes.

Yes.

during an online live broadcast.

338
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:49,200
Okay.

339
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,280
I'm pooping right now.
What do you think?

340
00:25:57,250 --> 00:25:59,170
- Great.
- Hey!

341
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,350
Do you know what I hate the most?

342
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:06,380
Not focusing on work
because of your private life.

343
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:07,490
I'm sorry.

344
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,530
- I've been very lenient on you.
- Okay.

345
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:11,590
Let's do this right.

346
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:18,600
Hey, Mi Kyung. Yes.

347
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:19,840
Now?

348
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:22,900
Gosh, of course. You bet.

349
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:25,400
Okay. I'll be there right away.

350
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:27,630
Where are you going?
What about our meeting?

351
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,940
This meeting isn't important.
Mi Kyung wants to see me.

352
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,280
Goodness.

353
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:40,020
Why is he on his way here?

354
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:41,360
I just said I would buy him
a meal some other time.

355
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,620
What's he doing?

356
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:48,030
What?
What happened to all the snacks?

357
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:52,000
No. I didn't eat any of them.

358
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,500
Then, where did
all of the snacks go?

359
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,810
I guess he won't eat snacks anymore.

360
00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:00,010
Why not?

361
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:04,780
Did you...

362
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:07,910
You must have rejected him hard.

363
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:11,520
What? I didn't.
I didn't have dinner with him yet.

364
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:14,760
Wait, is that why?

365
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:16,380
I don't think so.

366
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:18,330
I don't know. What is it?

367
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:20,650
Goodness.
What are you mumbling about?

368
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:28,740
But Mr. Lee is a bit petty.

369
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,460
I didn't peg him to be small-minded.

370
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:32,310
He got rid of them
because you rejected him.

371
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,780
It's not like that.

372
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:37,350
Goodness. You are pretty lucky
when it comes to food.

373
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:38,580
Come here.

374
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:41,050
You two should have a bite of this.

375
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:42,210
Hurry.

376
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:45,880
These are some fancy snacks.

377
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:48,410
Where did you get them?

378
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:50,760
In Health Office...

379
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:52,950
Did Mr. Lee give them to you?

380
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,160
No. I found tons of snacks...

381
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,460
when I went to Health Office.

382
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:00,040
What? You just took them?

383
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:01,340
Mr. Lee... No.

384
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:03,240
Without getting permission
from Chief Director Lee?

385
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,370
Gosh, why would I need
his permission?

386
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:08,470
He's very good-natured.

387
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:10,940
He won't say anything
about a few snacks.

388
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:12,050
Exactly.

389
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:15,440
How shameless!

390
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:24,490
Mr. Lee, don't leave your snacks
in Health Office.

391
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:26,560
You should hide them in your office
and eat them here.

392
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,120
- Pardon?
- Seo Yeon went...

393
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,920
out of her way to take them
from the vice-principal.

394
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:34,360
That skinny man seems
to be quite strong.

395
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:36,630
If the vice-principal
takes them again,

396
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:38,930
tell me right away. Do tell me.

397
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:41,310
I have a class to teach now.

398
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:51,790
Ms. Joo just...

399
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:53,880
protected me, right?

400
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:58,950
For some reason, you make me
want to take care of you.

401
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:02,220
Ms. Kim, you cannot like me.

402
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:03,500
You lunatic.

403
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,540
Get a grip, will you?

404
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:07,890
You're a smart man. Why do you
always let people steal from you?

405
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:09,900
Are you still...

406
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:11,770
on my side?

407
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,610
Not on Kang Woo's side?

408
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:19,520
I'm on Seo Yeon's side.

409
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:21,820
And whoever that she likes is
the one who's on my team.

410
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:26,210
I'm jealous of your
long-term friendship.

411
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:29,450
Before we were friends,
she was my savior.

412
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:33,390
As you know, my personality
isn't exactly easy-going.

413
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:35,390
So I was an outcast
back in middle school.

414
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:38,220
But Seo Yeon hung out with me.

415
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,040
When other kids told her
not to hang out with me,

416
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,430
she didn't understand...

417
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:44,130
and said she liked me.

418
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:50,370
That's why I'm always on her side.

419
00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:53,670
It would've been great...

420
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:56,710
if I had met her back then.

421
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,180
Then I would have liked her...

422
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,120
before Kang Woo,
even longer than he did.

423
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:20,090
What are you doing up there?

424
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:24,090
There's this heartrending aspect...

425
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:26,490
about him.

426
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:28,270
What?

427
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:29,700
It's Mr. Lee.

428
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:33,000
I realized that
he has eyes like a cow.

429
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:35,070
A really sad one at that.

430
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:41,540
Mr. Lee has zero percent
of being with you, right?

431
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:44,180
- Hey.
- I know. I already know that.

432
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,580
But you know, just in case.

433
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:47,220
There won't be any other cases.

434
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:48,680
Kang Woo is the only one for me.

435
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:54,430
What a loss.

436
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,470
I am...

437
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:18,080
daring to avoid Seo Yeon, aren't I?

438
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,300
Hey, Jung Ho.

439
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:32,990
- You're here.
- Yes.

440
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:33,990
Are you all right?

441
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,940
There's no reason not to be okay.

442
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:37,660
What?

443
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:41,040
I mean, you haven't been coming,
so I was wondering if you were ill.

444
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,050
Seo Jun.

445
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,100
I'm...

446
00:31:44,850 --> 00:31:47,910
so jealous of how you get adored
for doing nothing.

447
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:50,320
- What?
- But...

448
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:55,990
you can't always enjoy good days.

449
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:58,900
Enjoy it while you can.

450
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,080
What was that?

451
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:26,390
Isn't this yours?

452
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:35,360
That looked like Seo Jun's picture.

453
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:49,210
Hi.

454
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:53,980
Kang Woo.

455
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:58,050
Don't call me like that.

456
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:01,260
Why did you lie to me?

457
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,730
You said you'd forgive me...

458
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:06,620
when I call out your name
no matter how mean I was.

459
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:12,670
Don't you like me anymore?

460
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,030
Are you sick of me now?

461
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:18,610
Do you really hate me now?

462
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:25,420
Do you want to come in?

463
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,810
- Yes.
- If you come in now,

464
00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:29,610
I won't let you go home.

465
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:33,110
- What?
- I won't...

466
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,280
let you go home.

467
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:38,550
Do you still want to come in?

468
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,900
Hey...

469
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,230
Stop provoking me.

470
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,740
You already know...

471
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,530
I can never hate you.

472
00:33:49,770 --> 00:33:50,930
Stop feeling me out.

473
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,450
It's annoying.

474
00:34:16,090 --> 00:34:17,170
Who are you again?

475
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:19,530
I'm Kang Woo. This is Lee Kang Woo.

476
00:34:19,699 --> 00:34:21,610
How did you get my number?

477
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:22,770
Did Seo Yeon...

478
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:25,239
get home all right?

479
00:34:25,429 --> 00:34:26,900
This is random.

480
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:28,250
Why do you suddenly ask?

481
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:31,270
Because I couldn't take her home.

482
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:40,210
Yes, she did come in.

483
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:43,830
I'm so relieved.

484
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:46,900
I don't think you and I should be
talking on the phone like this.

485
00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:49,920
Right, I'm sorry.

486
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:51,659
Thank you.

487
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:59,010
How did he get my number?

488
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:04,040
My personal information
has gone way too public.

489
00:35:06,210 --> 00:35:07,710
She dropped everything.

490
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:21,420
What is this?

491
00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:27,230
Oh, I'm sorry.

492
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:29,570
You were the only one
I could think of.

493
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,140
What is it?

494
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:36,650
What am I going to do?

495
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:38,750
I feel so bad for my dad.

496
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,580
I think...

497
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:42,890
he saw the video.

498
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,560
I'm still... I'm...

499
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:47,390
not...

500
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:53,720
I'm not ready to tell him yet.

501
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:20,120
Stop crying.

502
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,480
Okay.

503
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:27,220
Stop...

504
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:36,510
Gosh, don't hit me. I won't cry.

505
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:42,580
Oh, I thought
you were going to hit me.

506
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,080
What?

507
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:45,250
I'm sorry.

508
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:54,060
You asked me...

509
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:56,480
how I told my family, didn't you?

510
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:10,770
I had no idea...

511
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:14,080
I was that troubled.

512
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:29,020
No, Won Seok!

513
00:37:52,450 --> 00:37:54,820
The Rocky Mountains stretches
from Canada...

514
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:57,910
to New Mexico in the US.

515
00:37:57,910 --> 00:38:01,120
- Won Seok.
- They're about 3,000km.

516
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:04,420
Answer me, will you?

517
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,650
Yes?

518
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:13,230
Didn't it hurt?

519
00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:20,310
How are you so fearless?

520
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:23,510
I'm sorry.

521
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:28,210
Yes. You should be.

522
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:39,060
The water flows
into the Pacific or the Atlantic.

523
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,700
I'd prefer it...

524
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:44,920
if he was more talkative than you.

525
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:55,770
I'm talking...

526
00:38:57,510 --> 00:39:00,020
about the guy you will introduce
to me one day.

527
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,400
I'm sorry.

528
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:24,770
Won Seok.

529
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,010
That's not something...

530
00:39:30,170 --> 00:39:31,770
you should be sorry about.

531
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:46,860
Whatever the case may be,

532
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:52,000
you won't make him witness
such a horrible sight.

533
00:39:54,270 --> 00:39:55,870
It'll be better for him.

534
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:03,400
So...

535
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:06,520
let's keep going.

536
00:40:24,970 --> 00:40:26,000
Why did you...

537
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:29,700
deceive me?

538
00:40:30,530 --> 00:40:31,560
What?

539
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:48,550
If you have nothing to say...

540
00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:52,790
You're right. I don't.

541
00:40:53,730 --> 00:40:56,020
I have no right to say anything...

542
00:40:57,470 --> 00:40:58,640
this time.

543
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:12,940
Do you have...

544
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:14,980
a pair of scissors?

545
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:18,350
What? What for?

546
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:22,280
There's a loose thread here.

547
00:41:31,370 --> 00:41:32,400
Let me.

548
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,930
Let me do it for you.

549
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,140
Okay, then.

550
00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:24,410
Yes?

551
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,090
Did you leave something behind?

552
00:42:38,270 --> 00:42:39,340
Are you a ghost?

553
00:43:00,890 --> 00:43:03,090
Are you real?

554
00:43:04,590 --> 00:43:07,130
Are you me?

555
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:48,190
Let me see.

556
00:43:49,010 --> 00:43:52,240
You have blossomed beautifully.

557
00:44:02,910 --> 00:44:05,180
- Are you okay?
- What?

558
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:07,020
Do you feel dizzy? Are you hurt?

559
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:08,820
- No.
- Get on my back.

560
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:12,290
Goodness, what's going on?

561
00:44:12,630 --> 00:44:13,730
Goodness.

562
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:19,290
Grandma, where are you?

563
00:44:20,790 --> 00:44:23,430
You're here? Where?

564
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:25,240
Mr. Lee!

565
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:31,170
This is an emergency! Hurry up!

566
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:34,170
Come on!

567
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:42,780
Ma'am, are you sure you're okay?

568
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:44,420
I'm...

569
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:47,650
She fell.

570
00:44:48,630 --> 00:44:51,660
Ms. Joo, she's the...

571
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:00,140
Mr. Lee, please check on her.

572
00:45:00,530 --> 00:45:01,530
What?

573
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:08,220
Okay. Leave this up to me.
You have a class.

574
00:45:09,350 --> 00:45:10,780
Oh, right.

575
00:45:11,890 --> 00:45:17,450
Ma'am, he's very competent.

576
00:45:17,450 --> 00:45:19,450
Tell him all the places
that are giving you pain.

577
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:20,450
Okay.

578
00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:23,520
I'll do that. Go on, then.

579
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:24,870
All right.

580
00:45:39,350 --> 00:45:41,770
- Are your legs okay?
- It's her, right?

581
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:46,550
She's the one Kang Woo is seeing.

582
00:45:49,630 --> 00:45:50,860
You found out as well?

583
00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:03,740
Let me see how the school is doing.

584
00:46:14,170 --> 00:46:16,850
You seem to be doing a good job.

585
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:21,680
Still, don't expect to be here
for a long time.

586
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:22,990
It's fun.

587
00:46:24,050 --> 00:46:26,520
Are you sure you don't want to work
at a hospital again?

588
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:33,030
Have your wounds
not fully healed up yet?

589
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:39,800
Do you think I don't know
why you left the hospital?

590
00:46:42,010 --> 00:46:43,570
After you left,

591
00:46:44,250 --> 00:46:46,980
the director told me.

592
00:46:48,810 --> 00:46:53,360
I thought things would get better
with time.

593
00:46:58,450 --> 00:46:59,500
I'm sorry.

594
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,900
To me, both you and Kang Woo
are precious grandchildren.

595
00:47:05,470 --> 00:47:06,870
Be more like him...

596
00:47:06,870 --> 00:47:10,060
and express your feelings
if you want me to understand.

597
00:47:16,470 --> 00:47:17,970
Oh, you.

598
00:47:19,650 --> 00:47:24,320
Goodness, you are too mature
for your age.

599
00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:27,510
My heart aches for you.

600
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:44,000
Doctor, please!

601
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:46,640
Just say one word!

602
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:49,310
Please say one word...

603
00:47:49,810 --> 00:47:50,810
Please...

604
00:47:52,050 --> 00:47:54,650
Please. Please say it.

605
00:47:55,890 --> 00:47:56,890
Please.

606
00:47:57,150 --> 00:48:00,320
Please, doctor. Just one word.

607
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:02,120
Mr. Lee.

608
00:48:07,030 --> 00:48:08,360
Are you all right?

609
00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:14,760
Shouldn't you be off work?

610
00:48:38,130 --> 00:48:39,860
Your eyes were red.

611
00:48:40,130 --> 00:48:41,950
So I thought
perhaps, you had a fever.

612
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:50,400
Did the old lady go home safely?

613
00:48:51,610 --> 00:48:52,810
Yes.

614
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:57,500
I'm sorry. You must have been busy.

615
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:01,150
Goodness, I'm nosy
when I can't even handle it myself.

616
00:49:01,150 --> 00:49:02,410
Gosh.

617
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:06,910
It hurts. Don't do that.

618
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:17,190
You should go home, Ms. Joo.

619
00:49:17,190 --> 00:49:18,570
I have some work left.

620
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:37,680
Be more like him...

621
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:39,820
and express your feelings...

622
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:41,290
if you want me to understand.

623
00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:45,030
Should I really tell her everything?

624
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:51,460
Wait, what are you talking about?

625
00:49:52,070 --> 00:49:54,840
So Min Hyuk also likes that lady?

626
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:56,000
Right.

627
00:49:56,460 --> 00:50:00,780
He looked at her as if she was
more than a teacher at school.

628
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:03,280
What kind of disaster is this?

629
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:05,580
I don't know what to do now.

630
00:50:05,580 --> 00:50:07,470
If your wife finds out...

631
00:50:07,470 --> 00:50:08,550
No, Mother!

632
00:50:08,670 --> 00:50:09,790
She cannot know.

633
00:50:09,790 --> 00:50:11,480
If she finds out, it'll be awful.

634
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:12,890
Kang Woo, Min Hyuk, and that girl...

635
00:50:12,890 --> 00:50:14,510
will be in big trouble!

636
00:50:17,250 --> 00:50:19,750
Goodness, that's why I'm worried.

637
00:50:40,670 --> 00:50:42,320
She's not coming today, right?

638
00:50:44,410 --> 00:50:45,440
Right.

639
00:50:45,890 --> 00:50:47,680
I did scare her the other day.

640
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:23,450
I definitely saw her!

641
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:35,690
What am I doing?

642
00:51:55,830 --> 00:51:57,680
What am I doing here?

643
00:51:57,890 --> 00:51:59,600
What am I scared of?

644
00:51:59,750 --> 00:52:01,650
- Do you want to come in?
- Yes.

645
00:52:01,650 --> 00:52:02,990
If you come in now,

646
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:04,530
I won't let you go home.

647
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:07,340
- What?
- I won't...

648
00:52:08,070 --> 00:52:09,460
let you go home.

649
00:52:16,610 --> 00:52:18,310
Hey, I just arrived.

650
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:21,240
Okay.
I'll wait for you in the lobby.

651
00:52:23,510 --> 00:52:26,820
I heard that this place
is better and more expensive.

652
00:52:27,820 --> 00:52:29,950
Okay. Hurry.

653
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:42,160
Goodness, look at his physique.

654
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:47,500
Hello.

655
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:49,700
If you're interested
in being a model...

656
00:52:50,650 --> 00:52:52,000
Wait.

657
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:54,940
Gosh. Is he her boyfriend?

658
00:52:55,350 --> 00:52:56,890
He's so handsome.

659
00:52:58,910 --> 00:53:00,860
Don't you work at a car dealership?
And you know Joo Seo Yeon.

660
00:53:01,860 --> 00:53:03,830
- Seo Yeon?
- Won Jae.

661
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:05,360
"Won Jae"?

662
00:53:06,030 --> 00:53:07,420
How do you know this man?

663
00:53:07,420 --> 00:53:08,750
He's Seo Yeon's eldest brother.

664
00:53:10,530 --> 00:53:12,070
Seo Yeon's eldest brother?

665
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:14,840
Hey, they don't look alike at all.

666
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:18,610
Just let it go.
His eyes are totally dull.

667
00:53:18,610 --> 00:53:20,540
What are you talking about?
I have the sharpest eyes.

668
00:53:22,230 --> 00:53:23,310
Who are you?

669
00:53:25,550 --> 00:53:26,880
I'm Mi Kyung's boyfriend.

670
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:28,550
We're going to get going.

that we should meet some other time.
