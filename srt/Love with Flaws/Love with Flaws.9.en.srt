[Episode 9]

3
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,430
Is it really over?

4
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:55,200
Who do you think you are?

5
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:05,890
Who do you think you are
to annoy me?

6
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,690
Why do you make me concerned?

7
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:12,050
Why do you make me think of you?

8
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:14,430
Why do you make me see you
when I don't want to?

9
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:15,690
Why?

10
00:01:17,289 --> 00:01:18,860
If you don't want to see me,
you don't have to.

11
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,690
Just stay there.

12
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,800
I'll make sure
you won't have to see me.

13
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,840
You kept your eyes opened?

14
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,320
Seo Yeon.

15
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,890
You're driving me crazy. Seriously.

16
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:35,810
You startled me!

17
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:38,900
What are you doing here?
I thought you were coming tomorrow.

18
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,310
What about you?

19
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:48,310
Me?

20
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:51,990
I'm the chief director.

21
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:55,030
A chief director ought to attend
an important event like this one.

22
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:57,150
You're here as the chief director?

23
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:58,160
Yes.

24
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,810
It makes me wonder...

25
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:09,240
if I should hide that I'm also part
of Shinhwa Food after seeing you.

26
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,250
Darn it. That jerk.

27
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,720
- Hey.
- I'm at the airport.

28
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,690
I'll get a cab
and be there in 30 minutes.

29
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:49,690
Okay.

30
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:51,720
What's wrong? Why do you sound
so down? Did something happen?

31
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,960
What? No. Nothing happened.

32
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:57,790
What was that? Gosh.

33
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:03,530
Hurry. Come quickly. Please!

34
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:06,130
No way. I guess
something did definitely happen.

35
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,100
- Hey.
- I'm sorry.

36
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,070
Okay, let's go.

37
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,040
Ms. Kim.

38
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,680
Seo Jun?

39
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,690
Mi Kyung.

40
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:19,339
Hyun Soo?

41
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:22,910
Mr. President, the car is ready.

42
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:24,090
"President"?

43
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,590
What are you doing here?

44
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,790
I was chosen as the backup dancer
for Hi-Seven.

45
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:36,500
He's the president?
I thought you said he was a janitor.

46
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,530
Imagine my surprise.

47
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:39,000
I was introduced to him
for the first time.

48
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,440
I was utterly shocked to find out.

49
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,070
Are you kidding me right now?

50
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:44,640
I made a huge scene
because I believed your intel!

51
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,140
Seo Jun,
Mr. President is waiting. Hurry.

52
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,440
Okay. Ms. Kim, let's talk later.

53
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,480
Wait.

54
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:55,490
So HS Entertainment was named
after Park Hyun Soo.

55
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,420
Really?

56
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,400
Where are you headed?
I'll give you a ride.

57
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,610
Forget it. I can take a cab.

58
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:20,270
You must have
a lot of money to waste.

59
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:23,210
Goodness. You have no idea
how these taxi fares can get you.

60
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,750
- Give me that.
- Hey!

61
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,040
Get in.

62
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:54,250
No way.

63
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:56,620
Hey, Hyun Soo is the president
of HS Entertainment.

64
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:02,510
Seeing how you're texting,

65
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,730
your phone is working fine.

66
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,820
Does it mean
you've been dodging my calls?

67
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:14,390
Well, we have nothing to talk about.

68
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,600
Where are you going?

69
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:19,760
To Shine Beach Resort, please.

70
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:22,400
Wait, if that's
where you're headed to...

71
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:27,070
Oh, my. This place is so awesome!

72
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,070
I know, right? There's the beach
in front of the resort.

73
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:33,510
Jung Ho, let's make a debut.

74
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:35,790
Let's make a debut
and go on trips like this...

75
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:38,560
while getting popular
and making money too.

76
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,860
Goodness. Okay.

77
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:42,930
Okay.

78
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,820
- Hey.
- Hey.

79
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:49,040
What? I thought
you went to a track meet.

80
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,260
Are you guys staying here?

81
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,960
- Yes.
- No way.

82
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:55,540
Wait, that means
my sister is also staying here.

83
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,610
Yes.

84
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,480
Over there.

85
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,210
Darn it. I didn't tell my sister
I was coming here.

86
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:04,070
Hey, pretend
that you never saw me here.

87
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:05,420
Jung Ho, let's hurry.

88
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,370
Mi Kyung!

89
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:26,810
Hey, Mr. Lee. What's going on?

90
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,180
I thought you were coming tomorrow.

91
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:30,310
I...

92
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:33,000
My appointment ended earlier
than I expected.

93
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,750
Is Ms. Kim also coming here?

94
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,810
Well, it sort of happened that way.

95
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,120
I saw that Kang Woo was also here.

96
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:43,750
Well, that... I mean...

97
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:46,380
I didn't even ask him to come,
but he just tagged along.

98
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:49,060
He changed the lodging
when I didn't ask him to.

99
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:51,870
No, this is good. I was
a bit worried about the lodging too.

100
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,130
Had I known, I should have asked you
to change it first.

101
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:56,870
No, Mr. Lee.

102
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:59,760
I am really grateful
that you came all the way here.

103
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,760
That's nonsense.

104
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,070
Right. Would you like to come in?

105
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:04,070
Pardon?

106
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:07,710
Well, I think
the kids might be hungry.

107
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:10,180
Goodness. Where is my head at?

108
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:12,710
I already made a reservation
at a restaurant nearby.

109
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:15,650
Let's go.

110
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:24,930
You'll catch a cold. It's cold out
since we're by the beach.

111
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:27,960
And it's important you're
in good condition tomorrow too.

112
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:31,610
Is that so?
Then, give me 10 minutes.

113
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:33,370
No, five minutes.

114
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:48,010
- Look at him.
- What are they saying?

115
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,120
- Come on.
- Did you come up with that?

116
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,520
Hey, she said she's going to do it.

117
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,820
Are you serious?

118
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:57,100
Hey.

119
00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:00,420
Look! What's that?

120
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,000
Hello, kids!

121
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,780
Goodness, did you miss me that much?

122
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:37,930
- Sweet.
- Look at this!

123
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:39,610
Unbelievable.

124
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:40,970
Everyone, sit down.

125
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,080
Guys, if you need more food,
order more food.

126
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:45,300
Eat a lot.

127
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,400
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir.

128
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,820
If you eat a lot, it will affect
your match tomorrow.

129
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,380
Let's eat a balanced meal.

130
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:53,620
- Okay! Thank you for the food!
- Okay! Thank you for the food!

131
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,550
Thank you for the food.

132
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,820
I'm going to use the restroom.

133
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:31,330
Why don't you advertise that
to the world?

134
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:35,390
Gosh, my stomach.
I need to use the restroom.

135
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:37,920
Come on. We're eating here.

136
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:41,630
Let's eat.

137
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:44,470
You must eat, so you have the energy
to take him down or crush him.

138
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:47,470
- Pardon?
- I'm on your side...

139
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:48,880
for about 70 percent.

140
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,110
Eat a lot.

141
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,350
What's wrong with him?

142
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:08,920
Goodness.

143
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,890
Am I jinxed or something?

144
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:13,420
Only weirdos are swarming around me.

145
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,930
This is weird.
Everything is weird about this.

146
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:28,250
Are you bothered?

147
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:32,720
I like that I'm on your mind.

148
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,920
Stop it.

149
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:40,520
I need to focus
on tomorrow's track meet.

150
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,390
Okay. I won't make any move.

151
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:45,630
I'll wait until tomorrow.

152
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:48,870
I don't know
what I'll do after tomorrow.

153
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:50,790
What?

154
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:51,900
I've been holding back too long.

155
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:54,260
It's been 15 years.

156
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,040
I'll go back to my room.
Just eat comfortably.

157
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:04,680
I don't like it when you skip meals.

158
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,400
Hey.

159
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:29,800
What's with this pillow?

160
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,900
I think it will put me
right to sleep.

161
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,380
Did you bring this?

162
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:34,980
Do you really have to do this
to me here?

163
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:37,620
It's such a waste to get
another room.

164
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,950
I'll be here
for just a night anyway.

165
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:43,250
It will be fine for two of us
to squeeze together for a night.

166
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,250
Honey.

This place is fine too.

169

I have to go out at dawn.

170
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,110
So let's keep quiet.

171
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,900
If you don't like it,
get another room.

172
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:07,170
Why are you doing a manager's work?
You're the president!

173
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:08,770
I can do this myself,

174
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:10,850
rather than hire a manager
to do this.

175
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:12,380
What will you do...

176
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:15,250
with all the money you earn?

177
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,200
Darn.

178
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:46,380
Darn you!

179

I hope Seo Yeon gets
to sleep properly.

180

What is that?

181

You brought that all the way here?

182
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:03,470
Of course.

183
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:06,210
You'll get old in an instant
if you let your guard down.

184
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,130
Tell me. What happened?

185
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:13,350
What?

186
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:18,280
Is Hyun Soo the president
of Seo Jun's agency?

187
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:21,140
I think so.

188
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:25,130
You're acting a little weird.

189
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:26,250
I thought you'd be happy.

190
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:28,390
Hey. I have pride, you know.

191
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:31,500
I don't care if he is a billionaire.

192
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:36,070
So tell me. What happened
while I wasn't here?

193
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:39,210
Nothing happened.

194

195

I'm sorry.
I thought you were asleep.

198

Am I a fish? How can I be asleep
in 10 seconds?

I'm sorry. I'll keep quiet.

200

Did you guys kiss?

201
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:15,080
That obviously happens
after a confession of love.

202
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:17,770
Is that an obvious thing?

203
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:19,850
Usually.

204
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,540
So it's an obvious thing.

205
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,180
Was it nice?

206
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,460
If you didn't slap him,
it means it wasn't bad.

207
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,500
Did you slap him?

208
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,570
No.

209
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:42,200
Then, what's the problem?

210
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,290
Darn.

211
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,400
I don't know.

212

Don't worry about it.

213
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:49,980
If you don't like him, forget it.

214
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:52,250
These days,
kissing doesn't mean anything.

I want to kiss a guy.

Keep quiet. Kids will hear you.

What do you want to tell me?

Why are you wearing that?

224
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:52,760
Are you wearing that
because you're afraid...

225

I might do something to you?

Stop! Won Jae said I could come.

Come in. We have no time. Go inside.

- Is this seat available?
- Yes.

Wait! Seo Yeon, sit over here.

334

Yes, you should sit comfortably.

- Hey.

- Yes, thank you.

Yes, of course.
I'll be there. Mr. Choi.

No.

of that than my father.

Give me a call
if it causes any trouble.

347
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:11,040
Oh, right. You already have
my personal information.

348
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,170
Do you need more money?

349
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:16,020
You already paid
your down payment and the balance...

Why did you come up with that act?

352
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:23,290
There are many women who are
prettier and younger than me.

353
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:24,880
Why would you do that to me?

354

You need money, don't you?

355
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:31,220
You're very objective
about yourself.

Yes, at first,
I was after your money.

- I'm talking about Kang Woo.
- Kang Woo?

432
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:45,030
I don't worry about Kang Hee
since she can take care of herself.

433
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:48,230
But Kang Woo
keeps going the wrong way.

434
00:31:48,290 --> 00:31:50,670
I'm just worried that
he might get on Mother's bad side.

435
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:53,120
I heard that Kang Woo
is interested in something else.

436
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,260
Then, it doesn't matter, right?

00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:57,370
Goodness. That's just an excuse.
I doubt that he has a plan.

438
00:31:58,260 --> 00:31:59,540
He needs to get married...

439
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:01,730
and work at the company
as soon as possible.

440
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:05,480
I'm not sure. That doesn't guarantee
that he'll listen to us.

441
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:07,840
Marrying him off
is the first problem.

442
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:11,340
If someone ever wants to marry him,
I'll make a deep bow to that person.

443
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:14,860
Why doesn't Min Hyuk
want to be a doctor?

444
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:16,710
Other people are dying
to become doctors.

How did you figure it out?

452
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:47,980
There's a new back-bone stew

459
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,790
Because you're studying so hard,

Come on. We should take it easy.

463

We were just done with our exams.

464
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:26,450
It's just that you have potentials.

That's odd.

Women actually like guys
who study hard like you.

473

Right?

Wait, is that it?

You're really popular,

My sister has a really nice friend.
Do you want to meet her?

No, no. It's okay.

478

Hold on. Wait.

479

Should I call you master then?

that many friends.

It's just...

00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,540
Do you want to chat with me?

491
00:34:53,370 --> 00:34:55,239
I just...

492
00:35:17,970 --> 00:35:19,930
[The moment you want to give up
is when you must start again.]

493
00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:21,480
It's hard to see you these days.

494
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:25,580
You've been here
unless you had your classes, right?

495
00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:29,540
I don't think I've been here before.

496
00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:32,380
Yes. You've never been here before.

497
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:34,790
You're not that interested
in my track team.

498
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:37,460
- Let's fix this place up.
- What?

499
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:39,620
What do you mean?
What should I change first?

500
00:35:40,330 --> 00:35:41,830
No. Don't do that.

501
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,060
I'm already grateful
for your donations.

502
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:45,670
I don't need any more help from you.

503
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:47,170
What I have now is enough.

504
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:48,770
I'm the chief director.

505
00:35:48,770 --> 00:35:51,500
Even if you turn it down,
I can do whatever I want.

506
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,560
I know
that you're the chief director...

507
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:56,610
and the fate of my track team can
change with one word from you.

508
00:35:56,610 --> 00:35:57,910
I'm well aware of that.

509
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:01,980
Do you need me to drive for you?
Let's go.

510
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:06,150
I'm sorry.

511
00:36:14,330 --> 00:36:17,330
I didn't know
what this meant for you.

512
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:21,270
Had I known, I wouldn't have been
too rash to threaten you...

513
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:23,710
that I would disband the track team.

514
00:36:27,370 --> 00:36:28,410
I'm sorry.

515
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:37,790
I didn't know...

516
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:40,030
about your parents.

517
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:43,050
Without knowing what had happened,

518
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:45,030
I only resented you that day.

519
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:47,460
I have something to say.

520
00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:50,050
What's your address?
I'll go there right now.

521
00:36:53,470 --> 00:36:54,630
"Why isn't she coming?"

522
00:36:55,290 --> 00:36:57,430
"She said she had something to say
and asked for my address."

523
00:36:58,270 --> 00:36:59,540
"Why isn't she coming?"

524
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:03,800
"Does she think I'm a joke?"
That's what I thought.

525
00:37:05,350 --> 00:37:06,440
Like a fool.

526
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:08,580
I said that?

527
00:37:11,790 --> 00:37:12,810
I'm sorry.

528
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:14,920
I don't remember it.

529
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:17,250
What?

530
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:21,030
The day of my parents' accident...

531
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:24,790
I don't remember
what happened that day.

532
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:29,730
When I woke up, I was at a hospital.

533
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:32,040
According to my brothers,

534
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:34,370
I lost consciousness
because of the shock.

535
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:39,610
I was hospitalized for a month.

536
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,670
I didn't know that either.

537
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,380
Was there anything I actually knew?

538
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:52,230
I'm such a loser.

539
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,360
Naturally, you wouldn't know.

540
00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:58,920
When I came back to school,
I heard you went abroad to study.

541
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:07,870
I thought about it for the month
I stayed at the hospital.

542
00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:11,980
"Why did it have to be my parents?"

543
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:14,720
"There are bad people out there."

544
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,920
"Why did it have to be my parents
who were good people?"

545
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:21,860
No matter how much I thought
about it, there was only one answer.

546
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:26,880
It was because they were
beautiful inside and out.

547
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:31,990
That's why they had to leave
this world too early...

548
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:34,290
and in such a painful way.

549
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:42,580
That's when I started...

550
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:47,480
to avoid keeping
good-looking people by my side.

551
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:54,250
I used my older and younger brothers
as my excuse.

552
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:57,860
There's something deeper inside.

553
00:38:58,650 --> 00:39:01,360
Somewhere deep that you don't
even know where it's hiding.

554
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:04,990
So she will never like you
with that face of yours.

555
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:08,470
It's not that I don't like you.
I'm just scared.

556
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:10,470
So...

557
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:13,500
You know that I'm bad-tempered
and selfish, right?

558
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,310
Even if something bad happens to me,

559
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:17,640
there will be many reasons.

560
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:20,240
It won't be because of my looks.

561
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:22,770
So...

562
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:26,610
don't let this scare you
when we haven't even started.

563
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:31,460
Please.

564
00:39:57,980 --> 00:39:59,320
Please help.

565
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:18,360
When I pictured my parents' accident
and suffered from it,

566
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:20,770
that even showed up in my dream.

567
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:24,610
When I kept running,
I got into an accident.

568
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:27,270
The accident felt real.

569
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:34,590
To me,
the accident isn't in my past.

570
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:36,720
It's...

571
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:38,880
still in my present.

572
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,360
I have a question.

573
00:40:51,210 --> 00:40:53,400
Is there
such a psychological state...

574
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,630
where one feels as if he or she
experienced an accident...

575
00:40:58,110 --> 00:40:59,870
from the shock of the accident?

576
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:02,980
That person even has a dream
being at the scene too.

577
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:04,720
Symptoms like this.

578
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:06,320
I see. That's...

579
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:08,820
Identification?

580
00:41:09,410 --> 00:41:10,480
Synchronization?

581
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:12,750
Hold on.

582
00:41:18,990 --> 00:41:21,760
All right. There was a paper...

583
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,760
regarding the phenomena
you mentioned.

584
00:41:26,530 --> 00:41:27,730
Is that...

585
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:31,000
related to one's heart condition?

586
00:41:32,850 --> 00:41:35,980
- Pardon?
- You're reading a book about heart.

587
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:42,980
Hold on.

588
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,830
You lived in the States, right?

589
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,200
You must speak good English then.

590
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,120
- Pardon?
- Our heart...

591
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:52,890
is an organ that controls...

592
00:41:52,890 --> 00:41:54,440
everything about us.

593
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:57,230
It's closely related to our brain,

594
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:00,260
so it has a big influence
on one's psychological state.

595
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:06,480
Are you all right?

596
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:08,680
I'm sorry.

597
00:42:10,370 --> 00:42:12,410
I'm feeling under the weather today.

598
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,060
We should stop here today.

599
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:16,610
Okay. Let's stop here.

600
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,460
Should you go to the hospital?

601
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:19,650
No, I'm fine.

602
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:21,460
Okay.

603
00:42:22,830 --> 00:42:24,160
Bye.

604
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:30,530
Gosh. Seriously.

605
00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:32,400
Now, he's asking me...

606
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,500
about his girlfriend's problem.

607
00:42:35,130 --> 00:42:36,730
Gosh, I can't believe him.

608
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,550
I feel dizzy.

609
00:42:50,690 --> 00:42:52,520
Should I accept her offer?

610
00:42:54,430 --> 00:42:56,560
Well, I can make money too.

611
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,600
it's not a bad offer.

612
00:43:01,070 --> 00:43:02,890
What do you think, Antoinette?

613
00:43:07,870 --> 00:43:08,870
Won Jae.

614
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,980
Gosh, Mi Kyung.

615
00:43:11,550 --> 00:43:12,770
Are you here to see Seo Yeon?

616
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:14,770
Wait, she's not at home right now.

617
00:43:14,770 --> 00:43:15,950
I just stopped by.

618
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:17,910
I heard you have a newcomer
on the second floor.

619
00:43:18,010 --> 00:43:19,510
Well, it seems like it.

620
00:43:19,610 --> 00:43:22,690
What is she like?
Isn't she kind of suspicious?

621
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:23,880
I don't know.

622
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:30,490
Gosh, how can you look hot
even when you do that?

623
00:43:30,490 --> 00:43:34,440
Goodness, Mi Kyung.
You always say nice things.

624
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:36,070
Won Jae, do you want to get married?

625
00:43:36,070 --> 00:43:37,530
- Do you have a lot of money?
- No.

626
00:43:37,530 --> 00:43:40,130
- Actually, you're not rich.
- Right. I'm not rich.

627
00:43:40,130 --> 00:43:42,610
We should both get married
to someone rich...

628
00:43:42,610 --> 00:43:44,580
and get a lot of money
for the alimony.

629
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:45,740
And we'll think about it then.

630
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:47,240
Yes, let's do that.

631
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:49,770
Make a lot of money.

632
00:43:54,410 --> 00:43:55,410
Yes.

633
00:43:56,150 --> 00:43:58,480
Once I die, my body will rot away.

634
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:00,150
What's the point of saving it?

635
00:44:00,830 --> 00:44:02,650
I ought to use it
when it's still good.

636
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:12,310
Ms. Lee. Fine. Let's do this.

637
00:44:18,270 --> 00:44:21,220
Seo Yeon's family is way too nice.
That's the problem.

638
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:24,240
Baek Jang Mi,
I'm going to expose your identity.

639
00:44:24,410 --> 00:44:26,190
Hey, Seo Yeon...

640
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:43,600
Why is she copying Seo Yeon?

641
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:03,460
I'm sure she's hiding something.

642
00:45:09,390 --> 00:45:10,600
You're nice.

643
00:45:13,430 --> 00:45:14,530
Do you want to take this?

644
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:27,740
Who are you?

645
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:38,020
Mi Kyung!

646
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:51,900
You have no idea
how much Seo Yeon talks about you.

647
00:45:52,110 --> 00:45:54,070
I guess you guys are really close.

648
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:56,030
Yes. We are.

649
00:45:58,710 --> 00:46:00,770
Why am I eating a meal
with this girl?

650
00:46:00,910 --> 00:46:03,320
Gosh, I'm jealous.

651
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:06,610
I want to get close
to you guys quickly.

652
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:10,360
Okay. I see.

653
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:13,520
This is so good.

654
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:15,750
She's such a good cook.

655
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:18,070
I know I should stop, but I can't.

656
00:46:28,370 --> 00:46:30,270
- He's really good.
- What's up?

657
00:46:30,270 --> 00:46:33,770
- Hey!
- Yes!

658
00:46:37,010 --> 00:46:39,050
My gosh, this is no joke.

659
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:41,480
Did you see this?
This clip is blowing up.

660
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:44,520
It turns out
that I look better on camera.

661
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:48,960
Gosh, I messed up here.

662
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:50,730
- It doesn't show, right?
- I wouldn't know.

663
00:46:50,970 --> 00:46:52,470
By the way, you really did well.

664
00:46:53,730 --> 00:46:54,730
Where's Jung Ho?

665
00:47:05,370 --> 00:47:07,080
Hey, can someone get rid of him?

666
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:08,870
I can make a debut in his place.

667
00:47:08,870 --> 00:47:10,220
He's not a trainee, right?

668
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:11,280
With that face of his?

669
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:12,740
HS Entertainment
can do better than him.

670
00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:14,980
- Isn't he just a regular dancer?
- He keeps blocking that hot guy.

671
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:16,460
Hey, you should just go home.

672
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:18,560
Jung Ho, are you here?

673
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:20,460
Yes.

674
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:25,200
Did you have a stomachache?

675
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:27,990
- No.
- Good.

676
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:29,600
Here.

677
00:47:33,770 --> 00:47:35,400
I'm giving this only to you.

678
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:37,430
I didn't give one to the other guys.

679
00:47:41,470 --> 00:47:42,470
Drink it.

680
00:48:09,310 --> 00:48:11,250
You delayed the installment
because it was a waste of money.

681
00:48:11,250 --> 00:48:12,470
What changed your mind?

682
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:15,670
I need to show how cool I am
to someone today.

683
00:48:15,970 --> 00:48:18,350
Gosh. When my guest arrives,

684
00:48:18,350 --> 00:48:20,610
serve us the luwak coffee
I stashed away.

685
00:48:21,290 --> 00:48:23,290
Gosh, who's coming?

686
00:48:23,290 --> 00:48:24,760
You're serving luwak coffee?

687
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:34,660
Here.

688
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:38,130
Eat a lot.

689
00:48:40,570 --> 00:48:43,280
Trying to seduce Kang Woo wasn't
enough? She's going after Min Hyuk?

690
00:48:44,610 --> 00:48:47,310
She's going after men
from Shinhwa Food.

691
00:48:47,310 --> 00:48:48,580
Unbelievable.

692
00:48:50,350 --> 00:48:53,020
But why isn't she making
her move on me then?

693
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:58,560
I've prepared luwak coffee for you.

694
00:49:09,130 --> 00:49:11,570
You've heard of it, right?
Luwak coffee.

695
00:49:12,130 --> 00:49:13,860
I see. The coffee from poop.

696
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:14,870
Darn it.

697
00:49:14,970 --> 00:49:16,470
Was it from musk cats?

698
00:49:16,610 --> 00:49:18,670
It must be hard to poop freely
for them.

699
00:49:18,670 --> 00:49:21,640
People must be observing intently
when they're going to poop.

700
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:22,780
How sad.

701
00:49:26,490 --> 00:49:29,210
What an original thought.

702
00:49:29,210 --> 00:49:31,220
- I can drink that, right?
- No.

703
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:35,690
I picked it up from a dirty place.

704
00:49:35,690 --> 00:49:36,800
I mean, I bought it.

705
00:49:38,530 --> 00:49:40,390
So you needed to talk to me.
What is it?

706
00:49:40,390 --> 00:49:41,390
Right.

707
00:49:41,390 --> 00:49:44,430
I wanted to thank you for helping
out with Hi-Seven's concert.

708
00:49:44,430 --> 00:49:47,540
I would like to express
my gratitude for it.

709
00:49:47,540 --> 00:49:48,540
You don't need to.

710
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:50,930
I only helped out because Kang Woo
asked me. It wasn't for your sake.

711
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:58,090
How are Kang Woo and I different?

712
00:49:58,090 --> 00:49:59,550
Kang Woo didn't...

713
00:49:59,550 --> 00:50:01,380
treat me like a gold digger.

714
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:04,060
- Hey, that was...
- This is all, right?

715
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:06,830
Thanks for the poop coffee.
It was a nice gesture.

716
00:50:08,190 --> 00:50:09,420
Stop right there.

717
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:14,360
- Come with me.
- Hey!

718
00:50:17,270 --> 00:50:18,270
All right.

719
00:50:18,630 --> 00:50:21,740
Pick whatever you want.
Everything you want.

720
00:50:21,740 --> 00:50:23,310
Well, not everything.

721
00:50:23,310 --> 00:50:26,110
Pick 2. Just pick 2 bags.

722
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:27,310
What are you doing?

723
00:50:28,470 --> 00:50:30,020
Why? Two bags aren't enough?

724
00:50:32,590 --> 00:50:34,820
Okay. I can buy you five bags.

725
00:50:34,820 --> 00:50:36,450
What are you doing?

726
00:50:37,490 --> 00:50:39,030
Wait, that's not enough?

727
00:50:39,030 --> 00:50:40,120
Hey, you're asking too much.

728
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:42,690
Tell me. Name your price. How much?

729
00:50:43,890 --> 00:50:44,960
Have you lost your mind?

730
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:47,770
How dare you treat me
like I'm some gold digger?

731
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:51,070
- What?
- Who are you to buy me a bag?

732
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:53,400
No, I just thought
you might like it.

733
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:56,430
Yes, I do. I love expensive
and luxurious products.

734
00:50:56,430 --> 00:50:57,900
But that's not a reason
to take one from you.

735
00:50:57,900 --> 00:51:00,670
Do you think I'm a brat
who exploit men of their money?

736
00:51:01,580 --> 00:51:03,850
Well, I guess you're doing this
because you thought so.

737
00:51:04,410 --> 00:51:06,110
Oh, no. It's not like that.

738
00:51:06,110 --> 00:51:08,590
I'm thankful for
how you helped me last time, so...

739
00:51:08,590 --> 00:51:11,420
If you were thankful,
you can just buy me dinner, okay?

740
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:14,150
I liked you better when I thought
you were a janitor who's a show-off.

741
00:51:14,150 --> 00:51:15,760
That's better than
who's purse-proud.

742
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:17,300
Hey, this is a misunderstanding...

743
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:19,830
If you ever call me again,
I'll kill you.

744
00:51:19,830 --> 00:51:20,890
Darn you!

745
00:51:25,310 --> 00:51:26,660
All I have is money.

746
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:28,610
If that doesn't work on you,
what do I do now?

747
00:51:37,850 --> 00:51:39,020
Mr. Lee.

748
00:51:42,410 --> 00:51:43,450
What are you doing?

749
00:51:44,110 --> 00:51:46,030
I was patting the cat.

750
00:51:46,490 --> 00:51:47,530
It's so cute.

751
00:51:48,060 --> 00:51:49,100
You pat it?

752
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:52,690
Wait, you actually saw Antoinette?

753
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:54,270
Antoi...

754
00:51:55,630 --> 00:51:57,000
Yes, why?

755
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,610
No one has ever seen her
because she's so vicious.

756
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:00,900
She was gentle.

757
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:06,080
I think you have the power...

758
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:08,110
to make people or things
more gentle.

759
00:52:08,850 --> 00:52:10,580
Is it because
you're nice to your soul?

760
00:52:13,490 --> 00:52:14,590
I'm not nice.

761
00:52:14,590 --> 00:52:16,880
Come on, if you aren't nice,

762
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:20,150
I'm probably an evil being
who jumped out of the pit of fire.

763
00:52:21,890 --> 00:52:24,560
Anyway, what brings you here?

764
00:52:31,610 --> 00:52:33,160
I thought of you.

765
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:36,510
I knew you were nice.

766
00:52:37,010 --> 00:52:38,870

No, no one.

769
00:52:44,710 --> 00:52:45,880
Then I'll come back later.

770
00:52:45,990 --> 00:52:47,490
Why? Are you going somewhere?

771
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:49,820

No, no one.

778
00:53:12,850 --> 00:53:15,080

Well, because you're rich.

That's true.

00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:41,290
Everyone says one's character is
more important than their looks,

811
00:56:43,380 --> 00:56:45,950
but people tend to be driven
by what they see,

812
00:56:45,950 --> 00:56:48,420
so their first judgment is
made solely on our looks.

813
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:52,330
And especially so
for these businessmen.

If someone doesn't look
as good as they do,

815
00:56:55,570 --> 00:56:57,500
if someone shows
even a bit of weakness,

816
00:56:57,740 --> 00:57:00,310
they chew you out
and trample all over you.

817
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:05,640
My clothes are like an armor to me.

818
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:12,880
So my bodyguard needs to put on
a better armor than me, right?

819
00:57:16,060 --> 00:57:18,620
You look great.
You can finish wearing that.

820
00:57:22,530 --> 00:57:23,690
Gosh, this is insane.

821
00:57:24,620 --> 00:57:25,660
What was that?

822
00:57:26,530 --> 00:57:27,620
What is this?

823
00:57:40,510 --> 00:57:43,610
Don't look at me like that.
I'm here as a customer.

824
00:57:49,650 --> 00:57:50,680
What?

825
00:57:53,030 --> 00:57:55,920
I'll order in a bit.
I'm seeing my friend here.

826
00:58:16,710 --> 00:58:17,970
This is the right place.

827
00:58:18,550 --> 00:58:20,050
Why did he ask me to come here?

828
00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:04,830
I'm glad I didn't delete this.

829
00:59:05,420 --> 00:59:07,660
I'll keep it until we take a picture
on our real date.

830
00:59:10,930 --> 00:59:12,540
But why don't you make
any women's clothes?

831
00:59:14,130 --> 00:59:16,130
You used to draw a lot of those.

832
00:59:38,860 --> 00:59:40,390
Hey, this is so good.

833
00:59:40,620 --> 00:59:42,690
How did Mr. Lee
find a place like this?

834
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:44,860
Is it good?

835
00:59:44,860 --> 00:59:46,240
Yes, it's amazing.

836
00:59:50,510 --> 00:59:51,540
Why?

837
00:59:53,170 --> 00:59:55,440
I can't feel anything.

838
00:59:56,210 --> 00:59:59,610
Hey, you already had
this much all by yourself.

839
00:59:59,610 --> 01:00:00,990
Where's your conscience?

840
01:00:02,150 --> 01:00:04,290
I can't feel anything.

841
01:00:04,290 --> 01:00:05,360
What?

842
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:06,860
I don't feel anything.

843
01:00:08,330 --> 01:00:09,420
About what?

844
01:00:23,110 --> 01:00:25,310
What brings you here?
And you brought some drinks too.

845
01:00:27,850 --> 01:00:29,520
I like Ms. Joo Seo Yeon.

846
01:00:33,180 --> 01:00:34,440
I came to say that.

847
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:39,720
I ended up hearing something
that I didn't have to hear.

848
01:00:44,830 --> 01:00:45,920
And you ended up...

849
01:00:46,690 --> 01:00:48,390
saying something
you didn't have to say.

850
01:00:57,900 --> 01:01:00,140
What do you mean? What feelings?

851
01:01:03,550 --> 01:01:05,790
When I kissed Kang Woo,

852
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:10,180
I didn't feel anything.

853
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:48,530
[Love With Flaws]

854
01:01:48,530 --> 01:01:49,890
He has no skills.

855
01:01:49,890 --> 01:01:51,450
I'm saying he's a bad kisser.

856
01:01:51,450 --> 01:01:53,460
- What did you say I should do?
- The real deal is important.

857
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:55,240
What's going on?

858
01:01:55,240 --> 01:01:56,740
What's your relationship
with Kang Woo?

859
01:01:56,740 --> 01:01:58,130
He probably wants to marry her.

860
01:01:58,130 --> 01:01:59,360
Please let me off this once.

861
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:00,960
Did you overuse your power?

862
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:02,310
I think Kang Woo is getting fired.

863
01:02:02,310 --> 01:02:03,700
This is Chief Director Lee Min Hyuk.

864
01:02:03,700 --> 01:02:04,970
You said I should do
whatever I want.

865
01:02:04,970 --> 01:02:06,510
Why did you want to see me here?

866
01:02:06,510 --> 01:02:08,010
I knew what you were like at once.

867
01:02:08,010 --> 01:02:10,440
I'm going to tell Ms. Joo
that you've been acting weird.

868
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:12,710
Was I away from home
on the day...

869
01:02:12,710 --> 01:02:14,520
of Mom and Dad's accident?

870
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:15,710
Should we tell her?

871
01:02:15,710 --> 01:02:16,880
If she finds out,

872
01:02:17,450 --> 01:02:18,560
she'll die.
