00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:36,830

I'll continue to be sorry.

I'll make you concerned.

I'll get on your nerves.

I'll make you think about me.

14
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,520

Gosh, side cramps.

It has been forever since I ran.

25
00:01:58,509 --> 00:01:59,789
I haven't worked out lately.

26
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,840
Kang Woo,
what's your plan this time?

27
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:25,810
Back in middle school,

28
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:28,740
it was your misunderstanding,
Seo Yeon.

29
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:33,079
I didn't ask you out...

30
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,079
because of that stupid bet.

31
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,380

32
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:42,260
Yes.

33
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,230
It's true. I blamed you...

34
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:48,700
for what happened back then. But...

35
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:51,829
when I confessed my feelings
the third time,

36
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,600
I meant it.

37
00:02:54,829 --> 00:02:55,940
Actually,

38
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:58,850
I had no idea that Hyun Soo...

39
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:01,420
came up with that lie.

40
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:05,880
And of course,
I meant everything I said...

41
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,160
to you...

42
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,260
this morning.

43
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,790
What do you think?

44
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:20,070
Man, you're so clingy.

45
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:21,130
Clingy?

46
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:26,170
No.

47
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,540
I didn't mean clingy.

48
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,570
It's just too long.

49
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,410
You should have
resolved the misunderstanding...

50
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:34,040
as soon as things happened.

51
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,380
I didn't know...

52
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,380
that I still,

53
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,320
even now,

54
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,350
liked her...

55
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:44,320
so much.

56
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,730
Don't try to make excuses
about what happened in the past.

57

Keep showing her
that you are sincere.

58
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:52,890
I'm sure the misunderstanding
will get resolved naturally.

59
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:02,540
Then how do I show her...

60
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:04,540
that I'm sincere?

61

00:11:58,620 --> 00:11:59,620
What?

172
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,450
"Joo Seo Jun"?

173
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:07,160
You're Seo Yeon's younger brother?

174
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:09,130
You're handsome.

175
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:16,400
What was that?

176
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:22,410
He's the chief director
of our school.

177
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:23,540
"Chief director"?

178
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,280
Then why did he come to our company?

179
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:28,880
No. Why did he come to our house?

180
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,280
I think he came to see Ms. Joo.

181
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,920
Why did he come to see her?

182
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:34,890
What is going on?

183
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:40,660
Hey.

184
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:43,950
Are you really not going
to tell her?

185
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:46,460
What? Tell her what?

186
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,330
I don't know
what you're talking about.

187
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:00,970
Hey, could someone
who has always lied...

188
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:02,250
be telling the truth?

189
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,540
Kang Woo confessed, didn't he?

190
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:08,790
I knew there was something
going on that night.

191
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:10,920
And all that ruckus at the school
as well.

192
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,320
- "That night"?
- Yes, there was one night...

193
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,680
when I met him.

194
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,760
What did he say?

195
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,190
Well...

196
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:20,720
I doubt he's telling the truth.

197
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,060
It is the truth.

198
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:26,060
Gosh, I don't want to put him
on a pedestal.

199
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:27,960
I'm on Team Hangook Medicine.

200
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,470
But on second thought,
Kang Woo seems slightly better.

201
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,150
Are you drunk?

202
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,610
Yes. They should fight
fair and square...

203
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:36,070
and let the stronger one win.

204
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:38,340
You are drunk. Let's go.

205
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,760
All that drama with Park Hyun Soo
was Hyun Soo's doing all along.

206
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,660
Kang Woo had no idea.

207
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:47,680
So he was being sincere
when he confessed that time.

208
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:58,640
Brace yourself.

209
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:01,700
It seems like you'll be surrounded
by guys soon.

210
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:04,470
It is a pity
that they're both good-looking.

211
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:08,250
Winter is coming, you wench.

212
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:09,420
It's coming.

213
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,490
It's coming.

214
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:15,620
This is Hi-Seven's last title song.

215
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:17,390
It's about the ardent...

216
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:19,820
and innocent one-sided love
of a man.

217
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:21,950
The title is "Sincerity".

218
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:45,990
What do you say?

219
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:51,660
Gosh, doesn't this sound too old?

220
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:54,720
Who commits to such
one-sided love these days?

221
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:57,690
It's all about obsession
and possession.

222
00:14:57,690 --> 00:15:00,900
"You're mine!" Things like these.

223
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,140
Don't you agree?

224
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:15,570
So?

225
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:18,710
What happened to the two?

226
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:20,490
What?

227
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:22,860
A song needs to have a plot.

228
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:27,580
Does the singer get
a happily-ever-after?

229
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:37,640
I hope...

230
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:39,910
you can stay by my side,

231
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:41,610
Seo Yeon.

232
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:43,430
I'll make you concerned.

233
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:45,250
I'll get on your nerves.

234
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,280
I'll make you think about me.

235
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,920
I'm sorry...

236
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,540
that I like you.

237
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,390
So he meant all that?

238
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:03,160
Did you think I was that low?

239
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,170
Like a jerk
who asks girls out on a bet?

240
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,770
Do you really think that's who I am?

241
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:11,610
Even that time as well?

242
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:28,580
Seo Yeon?

243
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:35,590
Why did you come here?
How long have you been waiting?

244
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:36,760
You should've called.

245
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,870
Oh, right.
I didn't think about that.

246
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:42,500
You weren't home,
so I just thought I'd wait...

247
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:43,740
until you did.

248
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,510
What is it? Did something happen?

249
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:53,910
It'd be rude of me
to keep avoiding you.

250
00:17:15,329 --> 00:17:16,740
I'll bring something to drink.

251
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,869
I have a question.

252
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:28,670
I want to know what happened
that day 15 years ago.

253
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:31,240
I'm starting to think...

254
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,350
that there's more to it
than what I know.

255
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,320
Were you being...

256
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:40,220
sincere?

257
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:45,420
Okay, this time, it's Joo Seo Yeon.

258
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:47,330
You take all this money...

259
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:49,640
if she says yes
when you ask her out.

260
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,670
If you get turned down, you lose it.

261
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:54,310
So who wants to ask her out?

262
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:56,340
What if she really says yes?

263
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,970
- Then I'll...
- No!

264
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:04,770
Seo Yeon...

265
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,890
is my friend.

266
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:08,280
What are you blabbering about?

267
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:17,360
Don't do it. If you need more money,
I'll bring more.

268
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,760
So don't do this.

269
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:21,730
Wait.

270
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,490
- How much is that?
- Don't do that.

271
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:26,070
I wasn't strong enough,

272
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:27,700
but I had a lot of money.

273
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:30,410
I could stop them for that time,

274
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:33,110
but I didn't know
when they'd try to do that again.

275
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:35,420
I wanted to protect you
by your side.

276
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:40,420
But...

277
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:43,120
I don't know
why I felt so confident that day.

278
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:47,450
I had no idea
that you would reject me.

279
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:49,020
I don't like you...

280
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:51,060
because you're ugly...

281
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,070
and fat.

282
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,670
About the lie
that Hyun Soo was dating you.

283
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:04,110
I heard you didn't know about it.

284
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:05,200
Is that true?

285
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,000
Well, that's...

286
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:10,270
I was the bad one here.

287
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:12,120
I misunderstood you,

288
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,710
judged you,

289
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,360
and came up with my own idea.

290
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:20,390
No. I could understand
how you could've misunderstood it.

291
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:22,600
It's my fault for not explaining
to you properly.

292
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:24,020
It's my fault.

293
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:25,670
No, you did your part...

294
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:28,530
15 years ago,

295
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,690
that day,

296
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:39,110
and now as well.

297
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:52,480
I'm sorry for not giving you
my answer all this time.

298
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:56,690
I'm sorry...

299
00:19:58,250 --> 00:19:59,330
for hurting you.

300
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:04,530
And...

301
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:13,550
I'm sorry...

302
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:18,440
about this too.

303
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:40,340
Why?

304
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:48,110
Okay.

305
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:51,440
I know that this is a petty
and childish thing to ask.

306
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:54,240
Why?

307
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:57,420
I've been too mean, right?

308
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:00,020
You know, I did that on purpose.

309
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,520
I was immature.

310
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,250
I was immature, so that's how
I wanted to get your attention.

311
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:06,300
- That's not why.
- What if I'm nice to you?

312
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,260
What if I treat you really well?

313
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:11,530
There's no point.

314
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:17,410
Is there...

315
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:19,610
someone else?

316
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:22,740
Is it...

317
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,350
- Lee Min...
- I can't...

318
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:29,060
ever like someone
who has your looks.

319
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:33,060
- What?
- I don't like handsome guys.

320
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:37,400
- What?
- I got sick and tired of people...

321
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:40,190
who look like you my whole life.

322
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:43,570
Wait.

323
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:48,410
What?

324
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:00,940
Kang Woo will understand too.

325
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:28,650
What have I...

326
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:32,210
been doing all this time?

327
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,630
Joo Seo Jun of Class 4
in 11th grade.

328
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:46,460
Please come
to the chief director's office.

329
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:48,400
Immediately!

330
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:55,030
Did you want to see me?

331
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:56,110
Take a seat.

332
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:11,780
May I ask why you wanted to see me?

333
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:15,490
Seo Jun.

334
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:16,900
Yes?

335
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,900
Why on earth did you do it?

336
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:25,640
Why did you bother
your sister so much?

337
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,610
- Pardon?
- So you're a trainee...

338
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:28,670
at HS Entertainment.

339
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:30,770
Well, I...

340
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,550
I'm going to put
your life in pure torment!

341
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:41,280
Hey. You...

342
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,510
I can take this out
for a test-drive, right?

343
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:48,720
Why did you lead such an awful life?

344
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,360
What is this crazy jerk saying?

345
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,100
Why did you lead such an awful life?

346
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:54,990
You crazy jerk. Stop the car!
Pull over now!

347
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,340
Why did you bother Seo Yeon?

348
00:23:57,340 --> 00:24:01,430
Why?

349
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:03,030
Why did you do it?

350
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:08,650
Why did you make it so hard
for Seo Yeon?

351
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:09,650
Why?

352
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:15,710
- Sit down.
- Okay.

353
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,820
Don't lurk around Seo Yeon.

354
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,250
That's none of your business.

355
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,980
I don't have much to lose in life.

356
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:02,230
Seo Yeon's abnormal prejudice
against people's looks...

357
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:05,170
is partially our fault,
but it's not completely our fault.

358
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:08,200
There's something deeper inside.

359
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:12,770
Somewhere deep that you don't
even know where it's hiding.

360
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,550
So she will never like you
with that face of yours.

361
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,820
What is that?

362
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:24,360
Finish that and go.

363
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:45,080
There's something deeper inside.

364
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:49,210
Somewhere deep that you don't
even know where it's hiding.

365
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:52,420
It's a problem after a problem.

366
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:56,280
No, will there even be a problem
for me to resolve?

367
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:59,250
I don't even have a chance.

368
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:09,960
Hello?

369
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:12,870
She doesn't like good-looking men.

370
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:14,810
- Pardon?
- My face.

371
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:16,500
It's my face.

372
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:19,050
She doesn't like my handsome face.

373
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,320
She doesn't like me...

374
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:24,820
because I'm handsome.

375
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:26,550
Come on!

376
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:28,980
If you don't like that face,
give it to me.

377
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:33,480
He always calls me when I'm eating.

378
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:42,020
Hang in there. Just a bit longer.

379
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:45,700
I can't eat this
because it's too soggy!

380
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:57,080
How many days has it been
since he came to work?

381
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,210
Will he never come to work?

382
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:04,450
Get a grip.

383
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,280
Get a grip.

384
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:10,990
This isn't the time
to be distracted.

385
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,600
Seo Yeon!

386
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,260
I got my rank up by 100 places!

387
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:21,070
Good job, my boy.

388
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:23,380
Ho Dol! I did it!

389
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:29,880
Come on.

390
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,320
Darn you.

391
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:32,980
100 places!

392
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:36,660
Joo Hee.

393
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:42,630
Let me see your report card.

394
00:27:55,730 --> 00:27:58,640
My gosh.
How many places did you go up by?

395
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:02,470
You did so well on the tests,
Joo Hee.

396
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:03,710
Thank you.

397
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:06,120
It's all thanks to
the tutoring classes you got me.

398
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:08,620
Your tutor is an awesome teacher.

399
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:11,510
It must've been hard
to teach Seo Jun.

400
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:13,680
Ms. Joo.

401
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:19,490
Seo Jun...

402
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:21,220
Mom...

403
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,690
Don't tell Seo Yeon.

404
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:28,500
Why? Is Seo Jun bullying you again?

405
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:32,140
- That little jerk.
- No, that's not it.

406
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:36,380
I wanted to tell you
that Seo Jun tried very hard.

407
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:39,780
Right? I guess he's dying
to become a celebrity.

408
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,450
Great work, Joo Hee.

409
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:46,630
Get changed and come out.

410
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,800
I should have told her.

411
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:08,770
Are you okay?

412
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:20,180
Hey, stay focused.

413
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:21,180
I'm sorry.

414
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:23,800
Do you think you're all good
now that your grades barely passed?

415
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,900
No, I'm sorry.

416
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,190
As you all know,

417
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:28,420
Hi-Seven will be performing
on a big stage very soon.

418
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,140
And two of you will be chosen
as their backup dancers.

419
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:34,410
You know how important it is
to have experiences, don't you?

420
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:36,670
It's your chance to perform
before thousands of people.

421
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:39,500
So pull yourself together, okay?

422
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:40,550
- Yes.
- Yes.

423
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:41,650
From the top.

424
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:46,090
Get ready.

425
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:54,280
See you tomorrow.

426
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,630
- See you.
- Goodbye.

427
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:00,400
I really want to be
a backup dancer for Hi-Seven.

428
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:02,330
Don't you?

429
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:08,170
- Hey.
- What?

430
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:10,030
Get a hold of yourself.

431
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:13,850
Jung Ho, may I sleep
at your place tonight?

432
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:16,010
What? All of a sudden? Why?

433
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:18,420
Just because.
I don't want to go home.

434
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:20,210
- Did you run away?
- No?

435
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:21,820
No, you can.

436
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:23,980
But why?

437
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:27,720
Because something is giving me
an allergic reaction at home.

438
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:28,780
Do you have a dog?

439
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:29,800
What?

440
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:34,190
You're right.

441
00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:35,760
Something like that.

442
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:40,100
Hey!

443
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:47,800
Why haven't you been
coming to school?

444
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,810
I've been busy.

445
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,710
Why? Is someone looking for me?

446
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:54,940
No, not really.

447
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:09,090
Darn it.

448
00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:10,090
You.

449
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:18,070
What are you doing?

450
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:19,570
You two are here.

451
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:21,890
Mother, will you have a taste?

452
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,810
- Sure, let me see.
- Okay.

453
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:25,100
- Hey.
- Give me a moment.

454
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,500
Stop standing around and help out.

455
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:30,000
- Yes.
- Yes!

456
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,040
That jerk.

457
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:39,490
Hey, I think Min Hyuk is
dating someone.

458
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:41,020
Can you sound him out?

459
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:42,020
Why should I?

460
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:45,720
His parents don't really care
about him,

461
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:48,390
so I want to step in as his aunt.

462
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:52,000
Mom. Ms. Oh. Please.

463
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,500
I want to be concerned
about my own children,

464
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,270
but there's nothing to meddle with.

465
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:57,410
Happy?

466
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:00,530
You might have to be concerned
pretty soon.

467
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:03,000
Goodness, are you seeing someone?

468
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,440
I never stop seeing someone.

469
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,970
Tell me.
What's your ideal son-in-law like?

470
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,750
Goodness, forget it.

471
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:12,660
Is he doing all right?

472
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,380
Honey?

473
00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:17,690
First, it's Kang Woo,
and now Min Hyuk too?

474
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,160
Those old women are
going to go crazy.

475
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,470
Ta-da.

476
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:26,570
What do you think?
It's my beloved recipe.

477
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:27,690
Honey.

478
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,300
What do you think, Mother?

479
00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:34,330
I already had a taste before.

480
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:36,550
Oh, right. What do you think?

481
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,750
It's good.

482
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:58,840
Beef, mint chocolate,
and soy sauce marinated crab.

483
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:01,030
Everything he used is delicious.

484
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:02,530
Of course, it has to be good.

485
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:04,410
That's Director Lee of Shinhwa Food!

486
00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:07,070
Gosh, don't you think
I'm the best cook ever?

487
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:08,200
I'll serve.

488
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,600
Goodness, it's so delicious.

489
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,810
My gosh.

490
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,350
In times like these,

491
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:16,280
it's a wonder
that our company functions well...

492
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,440
without any huge trouble.

493
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:20,560
Min Hyuk.

494
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:21,780
Yes, Grandma.

495
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:25,660
I let Kang Woo work
as a chief director for a year...

496
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:27,720
to see what he can do.

497
00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:30,190
It's your turn.

498
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:34,760
Think about a position
that you want.

499
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:44,500
Will you really...

500
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,940

- Are you really going to come?

830
00:55:47,470 --> 00:55:49,470
It won't take long
if I take the plane. Wait for me.

831
00:55:50,130 --> 00:55:51,130
What?

832
00:55:53,570 --> 00:55:56,780
Goodness, she's the best
when it comes to taking initiatives.

833
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:02,480
This is nice.

834
00:56:14,820 --> 00:56:15,960
Are you a fool?

835
00:56:18,590 --> 00:56:20,360
And you call yourself a runner?

836
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:21,770
You couldn't even dodge that.

837
00:56:29,540 --> 00:56:31,210
Did you just dodge that?

838
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:32,840
Not again!

839
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:35,320
You did that on purpose, didn't you?

840
00:56:36,410 --> 00:56:37,750
Now that you're here,
keep your eyes on those.

841
00:56:37,750 --> 00:56:39,050
Don't let anyone steal them.

842
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:51,360
Look at how excited you are.

843
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:56,500
Hey! Come in
and put your feet in the water!

844
00:56:58,010 --> 00:57:01,330
The sea may look
very clean on the outside,

845
00:57:01,330 --> 00:57:03,640
but it's filled with microorganisms
that aren't visible in our eyes.

846
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:09,820
Stop it. Don't do it. Don't!

847
00:57:13,580 --> 00:57:16,380
Come at me, waves!

848
00:57:21,090 --> 00:57:22,230
Hey!

849
00:57:34,510 --> 00:57:36,600
Goodness, I knew you would do this.

850
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:39,100
If you knew, why didn't you stop me?

851
00:57:39,100 --> 00:57:40,340
Always making excuses.

852
00:57:40,780 --> 00:57:41,780
Hey!

853
00:57:41,780 --> 00:57:43,680
Anyway, isn't it fun?

854
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:49,820
I got all wet.

855
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:03,570
I'm sorry you got wet because of me.

856
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:08,210
It seemed like
you were feeling under the weather.

857
00:58:09,010 --> 00:58:10,900
You'll catch a cold.
Let's go back inside.

858
00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:13,100
I'll stay like this...

859
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:19,450
so that...

860
00:58:20,380 --> 00:58:21,760
you won't have to see my face.

861
00:58:36,070 --> 00:58:37,970
Please let me stay like this,

862
00:58:38,970 --> 00:58:40,160
Seo Yeon.

863
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:49,840
Ms. Joo.

864
00:58:50,140 --> 00:58:52,290
I'm at the accommodation,
but you aren't here.

865
00:58:53,220 --> 00:58:54,290
Where are...

866
00:59:22,980 --> 00:59:24,050
Grandma.

867
00:59:25,490 --> 00:59:27,150
There's a position I want.

868
00:59:44,210 --> 00:59:45,210
So that...

869
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:47,570
you won't have to see my face.

870
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:51,100
Please let me stay like this,

871
00:59:53,670 --> 00:59:54,720
Seo Yeon.

872
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:23,240
Is it really over?

873
01:00:34,580 --> 01:00:35,680
Who do you think you are?

874
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:47,800
Who do you think you are
to annoy me?

875
01:00:49,570 --> 01:00:51,270
Why do you make me concerned?

876
01:00:51,630 --> 01:00:53,470
Why do you make me think of you?

877
01:00:53,740 --> 01:00:56,630
Why do you make me see you
when I don't want to? Why?

878
01:00:58,280 --> 01:00:59,810
If you don't want to see me,
you don't have to.

879
01:01:02,750 --> 01:01:04,020
Just stay there.

880
01:01:05,490 --> 01:01:07,080
I'll make sure
you won't have to see me.

881
01:02:13,490 --> 01:02:15,150
[Love With Flaws]

882
01:02:15,220 --> 01:02:17,490
Seo Yeon is concerned about me.
This is great.

883
01:02:17,490 --> 01:02:19,230
- Did you like it?
- I didn't feel anything.

884
01:02:19,230 --> 01:02:21,030
Do it with me. Let's do it once.

885
01:02:21,030 --> 01:02:22,560
- Let's do it.
- Right now?

886
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:23,850
You move your body well.

887
01:02:23,850 --> 01:02:25,590
I can totally tell
that you're bad at dating.

888
01:02:25,590 --> 01:02:26,820
You're my woman from now on.

889
01:02:26,820 --> 01:02:28,830
You crazy idiot!
Who do you think you are?

890
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:30,090
What's wrong?

891
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:32,010
Do you remember?

892
01:02:32,070 --> 01:02:35,210
Mom and Dad passed away
because of me.
