[English subtitles are available.]

2
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:47,740
I told you it'll be raining.

3
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:50,150
I came for you.

4
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:51,590
I like...

5
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:55,250
Kang Woo.

6
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,280
I know.

7
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:00,090
I'll keep liking him by myself.

8
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:02,800
I've been...

9
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:05,920
liking you all alone too.

10
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:13,600
You're a really weird guy.

11
00:01:42,539 --> 00:01:44,340
- Why are you crying?
- What are you doing?

12
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:45,930
She's crying right now!

13
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,600
Seo Yeon. You shouldn't cry.

14
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,710
Why are you crying?

15
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,850
You shouldn't be the one to cry.

16
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:55,850
If you do...

17
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,210
Go.

18
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,759
- Seo Yeon! Answer me! Don't go!
- That's enough!

19
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:10,870
Seo Yeon! Seo Yeon!

20
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,700
Quit acting like a kid!

21
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,100
Stand up.

22
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,310
Are you okay?

23
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:35,079
Let me see if you hurt your eye.

24
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:37,160
Why is she crying?

25
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:40,850
I should be the one who cries.

26
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,450
Why her?

27
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:36,750
Won Seok.

[Episode 13]

29
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:01,780
Stop crying.

30
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:06,750
I want to stop, but I can't.

31
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:20,480
Seo Yeon!

32
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,890
What? What's going on?
What's wrong with her?

33
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,170
Get out.

34
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,890
Why? Is she busy again?

35
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:29,040
- Why is she always busy?
- Get out.

36
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,260
I have something to tell her!
Seo Yeon! Seo Yeon!

37
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,670
Get some sleep.

38
00:04:48,659 --> 00:04:50,810
Don't tell Won Jae.

39
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:52,960
He'll get upset if he doesn't know.

40
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,350
He'll get even more upset
once he finds out.

41
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:06,840
Take a shower.
If not, you might catch a cold.

42
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,780
I know I carried you here,
but I can't give you a shower.

43
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,040
Why not?

44
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,440
A doctor should help those
who are ill.

45
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:21,020
Snap out of it.

46
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:25,050
It hurts my pride to have a rival
who's not even sane.

47
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:26,350
Bye.

48
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,100
What are you doing?

49
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:34,170
Sleep with me.

50
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:36,540
What?

51
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:38,800
I don't want to be alone tonight.

52
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,040
But why me of all people?

53
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:52,390
Darn it!

54
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:54,310
This is unbelievable.

55
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:01,850
Your face...

56
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,230
will get bruised.

57
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:05,900
Thanks to you.

58
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:08,600
You should've listened to me.

59
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:14,710
Why do you like her so much?

60
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:19,710
What about you?

61
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,420
Because it's Seo Yeon.

62
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:27,350
What's wrong with you?

63
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,980
How dare you call someone older
than you by her first name?

64
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:35,290
You're right.

65
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:41,430
If I can't, then you can't either.

66
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:44,730
What kind of mentality is that?

67
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,580
And it's not because
you're the grandson of Shinhwa Food.

68
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:51,870
There's another reason.
That's why I have a chance.

69
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,720
What is it?

70
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:58,740
What is it?

71
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:00,850
I don't love you.

72
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:02,810
That's the reason.

73
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:05,590
I don't love you.

74
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:10,990
I don't love you. I don't love you.

75
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:16,930
No! No! No! That's not true!

76
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:20,340
- Come on.
- No!

77
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:21,980
That can't be!

78
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:37,220
Thank you for today.

79
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,730
Are you sure you don't need
to stay the night there?

80
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,750
I need to go to work tomorrow.

81
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,030
I'll revisit
when she gets her checkup.

82
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:52,360
She'll be fine.

83
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,650
Don't cry. If you do, I will too.

84
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,870
Good girl. You should eat something
before you go to bed.

85
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:06,220
You do have food, right?

86
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,690
She's worse than Kang Woo.

87
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:26,840
Goodness.
You only had rice and eggs.

88
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:37,650
You should pick that up.
It kept ringing.

89
00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:38,890
Eat up.

90
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:41,590
My gosh.

91
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,350
Eat up. I'm going to leave
once you're done.

92
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:51,170
Stop.

93
00:08:58,770 --> 00:08:59,870
Is it good?

94
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:02,880
Eat up.

95
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:22,420
Seo Yeon, don't tell me
you call that fashion.

96
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,940
- Ms. Joo!
- Your eyes...

97
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:39,780
Do you have an infection?

98
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,150
Your eyes are so swollen.

99
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:51,530
Won Jae, don't forget
your living expenses.

100
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:52,860
What?

101
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,530
Right.

102
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,560
All right, then.

103
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:10,380
Won Jae, what's wrong with her?

104
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,710
How was your night?

105
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:23,290
What about you?

106
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:25,320
It wasn't...

107
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:27,420
that good.

108
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:30,090
Me too.

109
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,220
It wasn't good.

110
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,700
Why didn't you tell me?

111
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:46,750
I didn't want to burden you
even more.

112
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:52,340
And Hyun Soo was there for me,
so it was okay.

113
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,120
I'm sorry.

114
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:57,810
Why are you sorry?

115
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:02,160
I was too focused on myself
that I had no idea.

116
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,420
You've gone insane, right?

117
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:05,630
Don't talk to me
if you feel that way.

118
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,720
I'm the worst friend ever.

119
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:11,510
Don't be ridiculous.
You're my one and only friend.

120
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:14,140
I wouldn't exchange you
for 100 trucks' worth of friends.

121
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,340
Me too. I wouldn't exchange you
for 1,000 trucks' worth of friends.

122
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:21,440
- Not even for 10,000 trucks.
- Not even for 100,000 trucks.

123
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,380
- Not even for a million trucks!
- A million trucks!

124
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:24,620
100 million trucks!

125
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:26,310
500 million trucks...

126
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,860
Forget it.

127
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:32,530
Why would I even bother?

128
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:44,460
Here you were.

129
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:48,140
Were you looking for me?

130
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:53,880
Do you need help?

131
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,840
- Pardon?
- The pain relief patch.

132
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:59,020
No, it's all right.

133
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:01,920
I don't have any ulterior motives...

134
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,550
in front of patients.

135
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,630
It's not that. I just...

136
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:14,170
Tell me where it hurts.

137
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:16,290
Here?

138
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:19,140
Here?

139
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:23,010
Or here?

140
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:26,250
Yes, there.

141
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:31,580
That's good.

142
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:34,420
Thank you.

143
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,710
Did you sleep the wrong way?

144
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:38,530
I was wondering why it hurt.

145
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:42,260
My body isn't used
to punching people.

146
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,460
It looks like you cried a lot.

147
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:52,770
No... No. I just put them on
to look cool.

148
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:00,540
Thank you.

149
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,790
Don't you want to know...

150
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:09,620
if Kang Woo is okay?

151
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,530
Even if I want to know,

152
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:16,320
you should be the last person
I should ask.

153
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,630
Are you being considerate of me?

154
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:22,540
This is nice.

155
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:25,300
Nice? This is nothing
to be happy about.

156
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:29,880
Mr. Lee.

157
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,700
I have inconvenienced you a lot.

158
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,170
And thank you for your help.

159
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,690
Are you drawing a line between us?

160
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:01,510
Don't push me away because
of your history with Kang Woo.

161
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,780
I beg of you.

162
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,630
Hold on.

163
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,240
Wait. His house is like...

164
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:41,340
Thank you
for visiting me at my home.

165
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:46,310
Well, you said
you're doubling my fee, so...

166
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:48,080
But why did you ask me
to come to your house?

167
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:51,080
I am not fit to go outside.

168
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:58,870
My goodness.

169
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:05,770
If you stare at me like that,

170
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:08,670
I don't feel good
since I'm a human too.

171
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:10,330
I'm sorry.

172
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:12,410
I was fascinated...

173
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:14,540
that such a handsome face
could turn into that.

174
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:16,440
Why doesn't she love me?

175
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:17,750
Right.

176
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,620
By any chance, has she...

177
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:22,710
been to this house before?

178
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:24,860
Yes. She looked around thoroughly.

179
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:26,630
She said she still didn't like you
after the tour?

180
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:29,030
She is indeed unusual.

181
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:31,030
What should I do
to make her love me?

182
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:33,500
- Pardon?
- How can I...

183
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:35,930
make her love me?

184
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:37,430
Well,

185
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:39,770
I thought you had given up.

186
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:41,910
Me? Given up on whom?

187
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:43,070
On Seo Yeon?

188
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,650
Seeing how you hit rock bottom,

189
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:46,880
others might give up.

190
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,920
You hit rock bottom,
so you can only go up from there.

191
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,760
He's gone mad. He's crazy!

192
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:14,540
A psycho.

193
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,070
This is crazy.

194
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:25,080
If he finds out,
I'll be in a royal mess!

198
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,740
Is it because of my stress?
I'm craving sugar.

199
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:30,740
Goodness!

200
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:35,280
What are you doing?

201
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,480
It's raining.

202
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:44,190
- Pardon?
- It's raining in my heart.

203
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:49,640
Is that the best way
to make use of your looks?

204
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:54,410
Should I quit school?

205
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,270
He's worse than Kang Woo.

206
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:03,970
Hey, Mom.

207
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:05,920
What?

208
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:11,890
Darn it.

209
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:18,220
Yes, Professor Choi.

210
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,520
Please good take care
of the patient.

211
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:22,430
Okay.

212
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:30,840
Hey, what's your deal?

213
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,810
Who are you to transfer my mom
to another hospital?

214
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:37,120
That hospital is the best
in treating stomach cancer.

215
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,920
Even so, who are you
to butt into my business?

216
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,450
Must you ask?

217
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:45,450
Why do you think I'm doing this?

218
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:48,400
I get that I have a lot of money
and connections.

219
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,920
But it will be hard for me to nurse
a woman I've never met before.

220
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:52,520
This is about you.

221
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,100
She's your mother.

222
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,340
You jerk.

223
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:59,140
I know that you don't like it
when I do this. I know, but...

224
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:03,530
Thank you.

225
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,920
I'm leaving.

226
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,470
That munchkin knows how to get
a man wrapped around her finger.

227
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:46,480
What do you want me to do?

228
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,240
Spy on Kang Woo.

229
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,920
This is the background check
on the girl Kang Woo is dating.

230
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:56,860
Putting aside her family
and everything else,

231
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:58,670
find out what kind of girl she is.

232
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:01,170
That's my point.
Why would I do that?

233
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:02,690
If I get caught doing this,

234
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:04,930
I won't be able to win
the argument against your mother.

235
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:08,170
Your mother is utterly
against this girl,

236
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:11,230
but in my opinion, if we try
to separate him from that girl,

237
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:12,610
it will be a disaster.

238
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:16,820
Dad, are you hoping things might
work out between Kang Woo and her?

239
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,850
As long as she's nice.

240
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:20,940
You're saying that as long
as she's a good person,

241
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,060
you're okay with anyone, right?

242
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:24,890
- And that applies to me too, right?
- Hey.

243
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,980
You're different.

244
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:28,950
I'm going to be really picky
when it comes to your spouse.

245
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:30,560
And if he doesn't deserve you,
you can't marry him.

246
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:33,330
Wait, why is it okay for Kang Woo,
but not me?

247
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,100
That's how dads feel.

248
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,300
Anyway,

249
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,700
please take care of this. Okay?

Ms. Lee Kang Hee,
you never turn back.

256
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:44,430
Seriously?

257
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:47,170
- She's going to leave like that?
- What?

258
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,670
That can't be right.

259
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,060
Yes, Mother.

260
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:09,630
I was stressed out over Kang Woo,
so I came shopping.

261
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:11,520
Do you need anything?

262
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,020
Goodness. My gosh.

263
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,840
Mother, I'll call you back.

264
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,410
Hey, let me go. Let me go!

265
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:28,770
Thank...

266
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:31,240
Goodness, Ms. Joo?

267
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:34,710
It's you, isn't it?

268
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,980
- Hello.
- My goodness.

269
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,120
Goodbye.

270
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,520
Where are you going? Ms. Joo!

271
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:42,300
Why is she running away? Ms. Joo!

272
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:46,330
My gosh.
I heard she used to be an athlete.

273
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,730
Look at how strong she is.

274
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:54,870
Ointment.

275
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:56,910
You're going to beat me
then treat me?

276
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:58,170
Yes.

277
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:00,380
And medicine.

278
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:02,170
Why are you here again?

279
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:04,080
To keep my eyes on you.

280
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:08,390
Just in case you tell on me to Aunt
about how I beat you.

281
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:25,570
Hey, does Seo Yeon look okay...

282
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:26,930
You're the one who got dumped.

283
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:28,500
Darn it.

284
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:37,320
Do you have anything sweet?

285
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:42,450
You can either eat this
or forget it.

286
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:59,730
I should have asked...

287
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:06,050
if Kang Woo was all right.
I should have just asked.

288
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:11,650
I hope he's not crying like a fool.

289
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:29,570
You finished all this
while I was in the bathroom?

290
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:31,030
You had this with beer?

291
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:34,640
Hey, I had a taste,
and it was really good.

292
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,910
You haven't had
anything sweet in a while, have you?

293
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:40,110
No, because
Seo Yeon hates a fat guy.

294
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:41,350
What?

295
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:02,070
Min Hyuk, wake up.

296
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,700
It's the weekend.
I'm not going to work.

297
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:08,670
No, it's not that.
Wake up. This is bad.

298
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:11,200
Gosh, darn it. What is it?

299
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:18,150
You really don't work out?

300
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:20,550
Then how do you lift
better than I do?

301
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:23,010
I was born this way.

302
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,450
Why am I doing this?

303
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:34,190
You eat too much sweet food.

304
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,030
Do you want to
become diabetic at your age?

305
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:37,190
Why are you worried?

306
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:40,670
What's with you? Since when
did you care about my health?

307
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:53,850
What are you doing?

308
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,120
I need something
to be concerned about.

309
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,280
I might go crazy...

310
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,720
if I don't stay busy
doing something.

311
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:06,960
How did I end up here?

312
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,070
Things are
already tough enough for me.

313
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:14,370
What? What is it? What should I do?

314
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:16,170
This one? No?

315
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:19,000
Or this one? Like this?

316
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,150
I'll teach you.

317
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:23,170
All right, watch me.
Stand like this.

318
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:24,740
- 1.
- 1.

319
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:26,240
- 2.
- 2.

320
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,740
- One.
- Are you happy?

321
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:29,680
Yes, two.

322
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:30,780
Keep repeating.

323
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:34,830
He's just a friend, Mom.
My middle school friend.

324
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:36,660
That's enough. I'm hanging up.

325
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:40,630
- Why didn't you put me on?
- Why should I?

326
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:43,570
She'll bother you
and ask about Hyun Soo.

327
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:46,840
She sounded excited.

328
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,260
She's thrilled...

329
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:51,200
because she was treated so well
at such a huge hospital.

330
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,740
I'm glad there was
nothing wrong with her.

331
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:56,850
She had extra-spicy chicken feet
the day before her checkup.

332
00:26:56,850 --> 00:26:58,980
That's why they suggested
she needs to be further tested.

333
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:02,180
She's so silly. Goodness.

334
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,320
Hey.

335
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:08,360
I think Hyun Soo is nice.

336
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:12,760
Well, he's not the worst.

337
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:15,930
If you like him, don't lose him.

338
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,500
It's annoying.

339
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:24,530
That weak smile of yours.

340
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:28,150
No, I'm all right, really.

341
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,420
This isn't good.

342
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,160
Are you going somewhere?

343
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:37,420
Yes.

344
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:39,920
Put this on.

345
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:43,100
- Me?
- Let's brighten up our mood.

346
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,130
Forget it.

347
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:47,760
Put this on.
Get up. Come on, get up.

348
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,400
I'll get you. I'll get you, okay?

349
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,430
- I'll get you.
- Let me go.

350
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,000
I won't let you go.

351
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,120
How do you wear clothes like these?

352
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,010
How do you put these on?

353
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:12,590
I feel naked
because nothing is fitted.

354
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:14,890
Let's go home.

355
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:16,100
Fine, let's go.

356
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:25,670
What are you doing?

357
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:28,030
Look at how long your legs are.
Are you a model?

358
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:30,530
A glamour shot.

359
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:33,050
Good. The autumn picture.

360
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,710
Good, the model shot.

361
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,210
The best shot in your life.

362
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,180
I said, that's enough.

363
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:41,050
My gosh. This is amazing.

364
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:42,360
Unbelievable.

365
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:46,780
The moving shot.
The natural shot. Good.

366
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:48,480
Shot, shot, another shot.

367
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:53,020
A glamour shot.

368
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:08,350
Shot, shot, another shot.

369
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:10,770
Hey.

370
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,680
I'm leaving.

371
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:16,510
I'm going home.

372
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:18,250
Okay.

373
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,280
Let's go.

374
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,690
Hey, you said you wanted to go.

375
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,110
Seo Yeon.

376
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,900
Do not say a word, kid.

377
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,240
Go inside.

378
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,740
First, Joo Hee.
Then now it's Seo Yeon?

379
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:59,580
What's with these ladies?

380
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:06,460
Your call cannot be connected.
Please leave...

381
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:10,460
Jung Ho won't pick up?

382
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:12,600
No, he won't.

383
00:30:13,170 --> 00:30:14,490
Is something going on?

384
00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:16,790
The comments on the fancam
must have been shocking.

385
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:19,100
- What?
- He hasn't been coming since then.

386
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:23,930
Jung Ho.

387
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:26,410
I visited your place,
but you're not here.

388
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:27,980
Call me when you get this.

389
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:29,450
Your voicemail has been recorded.

395
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:50,290
Is she crazy?

396
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:55,900
What are you doing?

397
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,200
Look who's talking.

398
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,870
Oh, well...

399
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:03,920
I can't believe
you're working at a bar.

400
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:07,620
- What?
- I thought you still had morals.

401
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:11,620
I'm truly disappointed in you. I am.

402
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:16,200
Who are you to care?

403
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:17,820
- What?
- You told me...

404
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:18,930
to mind my own business.

405
00:31:18,930 --> 00:31:21,090
Do you think living together
gives you some sort of right?

406
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:23,730
Whether I work at a bar or not
is entirely up to me.

407
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,840
You're going back in there?

408
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:30,540
Hey.

409
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:32,200
Hey, Joo Hee!

410
00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:34,620
Darn it.

411
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:40,590
They live...

412
00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:43,480
together?

413
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:52,390
He apologized!

414
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,200
What?

415
00:31:54,290 --> 00:31:57,170
He said he was sorry
about the video.

416
00:31:57,910 --> 00:32:00,360
It must've been difficult
to say it to my face.

417
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,200
To your face?

418
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:06,200
Perhaps, he's not as bad
as I thought.

419
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,720
You met him?

420
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:10,170
- Again?
- What?

421
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:12,950
He called me and said
he had something to say.

422
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:14,160
Why are you here?

423
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:17,220
To brag?

424
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:20,160
I thought you'd be happy
to hear this.

425
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,290
Have fun.

426
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,170
Okay.

427
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:37,380
You're the idiot
in that video, right?

428
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,720
What? Aren't you Park Seok Min?

429
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:47,140
I'm impressed. I thought you'd be
too humiliated to leave your house.

430
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:49,080
But you're quite brave.

431
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,080
What?

432
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:53,190
Are you here alone?

433
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:55,290
I'm about to go home.

434
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:57,230
It's way too early for that.

435
00:32:57,820 --> 00:32:59,200
Do you want
to grab a drink elsewhere?

436
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:12,880
- Are you looking for that kid?
- What?

437
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,450
Yes. Have you seen him?

438
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:17,140
He left with Seok Min.

439
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,110
Who?

440
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:22,390
Gosh, that's irritating.
Who is that?

441
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:26,190
Who is it?

442
00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:29,290
Hey, what brings you here?

443
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,760
- Where is he?
- What do you mean?

444
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,000
Where is he?

445
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,570
Wait...

446
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:37,730
What's wrong?

447
00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:39,170
What's going on?

448
00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:42,070
What's wrong with you?
What is it?

449
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:45,670
Won Seok, what is it?

450
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:50,070
What? Won Seok.

451
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:51,120
Hey!

452
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,140
Why are you here?

453
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:54,280
What?

454
00:33:58,490 --> 00:33:59,560
What?

455
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:03,060
What is this? I'm flabbergasted.

456
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:07,130
Don't tell me you're here
because of him.

457
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:11,199
Are you two dating? Okay.

458
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:14,900
Why are you dressed like that?

459
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:17,330
I can dress however I like
under my own roof.

460
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:21,909
- Let's go.
- Okay.

461
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:25,340
Thank you.

462
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:28,280
Ho Dol.

463
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,190
Let's stay in touch.

464
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:38,699
Won Seok, I guess
you were human too, after all.

465
00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:41,370
You have a heart as well.

466
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:49,940
Why would you follow a stranger
to his home?

467
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:51,750
It's Park Seok Min.

468
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:53,969
Everyone knows him.

469
00:34:55,179 --> 00:34:57,910
So? That's why you followed him
to his house?

470
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:01,510
He said he'd give me these.

471
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:06,150
Do you want
to grab a drink elsewhere?

472
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:09,820
Not really.

473
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:11,090
"Not really"?

474
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:14,160
Don't you know me?
It's me. Park Seok Min.

475
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,760
I'm not really a fan of yours.

476
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,700
I'm Park Seok Min, a top star.

477
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,700
I'm a fan of Hi-Seven's.

478
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:22,940
- Who?
- Hi-Seven.

479
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:26,200
- Who?
- Hi-Seven.

480
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,120
Isn't this awesome?

481
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:32,050
Since they're in the same agency,
Seok Min had so many of these.

482
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:37,820
- Put your seatbelt on.
- Okay.

483
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:07,760
Gosh. What am I going to do
with you?

484
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:22,800
Hey, are you not coming tonight?

485
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:24,200
No.

486
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:26,240
- Why not?
- I'm busy.

487
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:31,680
Then when are you coming?
Should I pick you up?

488
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:37,710
He's so heartless.

489
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,760
Seo Yeon and I are going
to live recklessly.

490
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:06,380
Explain that photo.

491
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:07,970
It took you 30 minutes.

492
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:09,710
You should've come in 10.

493
00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:12,280
Are you seriously going to end it
with her?

494
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:17,260
Forget it. If that was your plan,
you wouldn't be here right now.

495
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:21,390
What do you want me to do?
She doesn't like me.

496
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:23,630
What more can I do?

497
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:26,500
I hate that I can't say
what's on my mind.

498
00:37:28,090 --> 00:37:29,830
I get that you're not over her.

499
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,640
Since you're here,
take me home, will you?

500
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:35,400
- What?
- What? Aren't we friends?

501
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:44,320
She just fell asleep.
There's no point in waiting.

502
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:46,750
- She's asleep?
- Yes.

503
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:51,860
I'm glad...

504
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,060
that she can sleep.

505
00:37:57,430 --> 00:37:58,570
Goodnight,

506
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:00,800
Seo Yeon.

507
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:25,520
[Seo Yeon, let's hang out!]

508
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,680
Seo Yeon.

509
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:14,610
Hello.

510
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:15,900
Is Mr. Joo Won Jae here?

511
00:39:16,610 --> 00:39:18,510
Mr. Joo? One minute, please.

512
00:39:20,010 --> 00:39:23,010
Mr. Joo, you have a guest.

513
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:26,680
Who is it?

514
00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:31,420
Director Lee Kang Hee sent me.

515
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:39,920
[A claim for damages
due to the breach of contract]

516
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,690
[If there's a breach of contract,]

517
00:39:41,690 --> 00:39:43,260
[one must pay
a tenfold compensation.]

518
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:44,370
"Breach of contract"?

519
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:47,060
"File a lawsuit"?

520
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,640
Mr. Joo, did you cause trouble?

521
00:39:53,610 --> 00:39:56,120
I told you to read it carefully
before signing it.

522
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,680
Didn't you read the part
regarding the penalty fee?

523
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:04,410
How could you trust me so easily
and sign the contract?

524
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:11,730
"If there's a breach of contract,"

525
00:40:11,730 --> 00:40:14,840
"one must pay
a tenfold compensation."

526
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:26,350
I'll call it even
if you go on a date with me.

527
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,620
Mr. Joo,

528
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:31,940
I'm curious why
all the other girls fell for you.

529
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:33,850
And I'm jealous too.

530
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,760
Did you not understand
what I said that day?

531
00:40:38,050 --> 00:40:39,390
- I...
- I know.

532
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:40,920
You date women for money.

533
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:44,760
But it's nothing to brag about...

534
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:47,160
how I have never been
in a proper relationship...

535
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:49,100
for 38 years in my life.

536
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:51,060
9 out of 10 people will say...

537
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:53,030
that there's
something wrong about me.

538
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:54,800
That never crossed my mind.

539
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:55,800
Right.

540
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:59,140
Actually, you told me that
I was kind-hearted and beautiful.

541
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:03,010
That was
the best compliment I got...

542
00:41:03,010 --> 00:41:04,250
all my life.

543
00:41:06,090 --> 00:41:09,220
I fell for your charms, Mr. Joo.

544
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:16,330
Ms. Lee, I...

545
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:19,370
Well, I...

546
00:41:19,370 --> 00:41:20,890
I like you.

547
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:22,430
What about you?

548
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:28,270
Are you interested in having
meals with me, talking to me,

549
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:31,110
and spending time with me?

550
00:42:03,930 --> 00:42:04,940
Don't push me away...

551
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:07,250
because of your history
with Kang Woo.

552
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:08,670
I beg of you.

553
00:42:12,310 --> 00:42:14,390
I guess she decided against it.

554
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:45,440
What am I doing?

555
00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:48,460
I shouldn't treat Mr. Lee like this.

556
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:50,960
Darn it!

557
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:53,150
You're doing that again.

558
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:57,760
Hello.

559
00:42:58,690 --> 00:43:00,870
Why do you keep doing that?

560
00:43:00,970 --> 00:43:02,560
Doesn't your forehead hurt?

561
00:43:03,030 --> 00:43:05,900
Well, it's a habit of mine.

562
00:43:06,370 --> 00:43:08,510
What a strange habit.

563
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,580
Thank you for your help
the other day.

564
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:14,440
Without your help,

565
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:16,410
I could have humiliated myself.

566
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:21,460
Wear this when you go on a date
with my son.

567
00:43:22,510 --> 00:43:23,960
- Pardon?
- I can guess your wardrobe...

568
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:26,630
seeing how you were dressed
in the city center.

569
00:43:26,890 --> 00:43:30,460
Shouldn't you think
about Kang Woo's reputation?

570
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:33,020
Or ask him to buy you some clothes.

571
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:38,110
I don't think Kang Woo talked
to you about what happened.

572
00:43:38,610 --> 00:43:40,710
Talk to me? About what?

573
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:45,270
That can't be. Gosh, I begged you.

574
00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:48,080
Don't tell me that you broke up
with him that quickly.

575
00:43:48,770 --> 00:43:50,040
You didn't, right?

576
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:52,120
Well...

577
00:43:52,890 --> 00:43:54,310
You didn't, right?

578
00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:05,520
I didn't.

579
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:11,660
Of course. Yes, you shouldn't.

580
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:13,340
I'm devising a plan...

581
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:16,800
for you two break up naturally.

582
00:44:17,270 --> 00:44:18,540
Kindly be informed of that.

583
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:23,940
Bye.

584
00:44:27,510 --> 00:44:30,510
Goodness. This is crazy.

585
00:44:56,310 --> 00:44:59,850
Goodness. I thought
you were going out of your mind.

586
00:44:59,850 --> 00:45:02,120
I'm glad
that you finally got back to...

587
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,350
Should I kill him or not?

588
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:36,180
What is this?

589
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:40,230
This creepy vibe feels like the one
from Hi-Seven's stalker.

590
00:45:55,170 --> 00:45:56,740
I like you.

591
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:58,250
What about you?

592
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:01,400
Goodness, no.

593
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:03,580
Let's not be greedy.

594
00:46:04,270 --> 00:46:05,810
No, no.

595
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:10,410
Antoinette?

596
00:46:17,390 --> 00:46:19,370
- Hello.
- Who are you?

597
00:46:19,370 --> 00:46:21,870
I work with Ms. Joo at the school.

598
00:46:21,870 --> 00:46:23,340
My name is Lee Min Hyuk.

599
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:25,740
Why did you say hello to me?
Who do you think I am?

600
00:46:25,870 --> 00:46:27,970
Aren't you Ms. Joo's family?

601
00:46:29,030 --> 00:46:30,610
You have similar eyes.

602
00:46:32,110 --> 00:46:33,110
With hers?

603
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:35,380
Seo Yeon and I look alike?

604
00:46:46,830 --> 00:46:47,830
Hey, you're home.

605
00:46:49,150 --> 00:46:50,220
What?

606
00:46:50,490 --> 00:46:52,070
What brings you here, Mr. Lee?

607
00:46:52,070 --> 00:46:53,490
You don't have to get up.

608
00:46:53,490 --> 00:46:54,960
Sit back down.

609
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:56,040
Hey, Seo Yeon.

610
00:46:56,430 --> 00:47:00,340
Why didn't you tell me
about this fine young man at school?

611
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:06,170
You know, this young man
has great eyes for things.

612
00:47:06,170 --> 00:47:07,880
He has sharp eyes.

613
00:47:10,210 --> 00:47:11,550
- Won Jae.
- Yes?

614
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:12,710
Give us some privacy.

615
00:47:12,910 --> 00:47:15,320
Yes. Sure.
Gosh, what was I thinking?

616
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:16,520
I'll leave you to it.

617
00:47:16,910 --> 00:47:18,950
Come on. Just stay seated.

618
00:47:18,950 --> 00:47:20,330
Have your conversation...

619
00:47:20,330 --> 00:47:22,530
not in the room,
but in this big, open space.

620
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:25,420
- Won Jae.
- I'm going!

621
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:27,160
Why are you rushing me?

622
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:37,880
Gosh. What's wrong with him?

623
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:43,940
I'm sorry about that.

624
00:47:44,210 --> 00:47:46,740
No, he's energetic and nice.

625
00:47:47,210 --> 00:47:49,680
By the way, what brings you
all the way here?

626
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:52,390
You avoid me at school.

627
00:47:52,630 --> 00:47:53,950
I came here to see you.

628
00:47:55,890 --> 00:47:57,750
Right? You are avoiding me.

629
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:01,600
Yes.

630
00:48:02,690 --> 00:48:03,770
Ms. Joo.

631
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:05,810
Do you hate me?

632
00:48:05,810 --> 00:48:07,810
What? No way.

633
00:48:07,810 --> 00:48:10,400
Why would I hate you?

634
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:11,850
What a relief.

635
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:13,900
If you're uncomfortable
about the situation,

636
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:15,620
and not that you hate me,

637
00:48:16,470 --> 00:48:17,910
that's enough.

638
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:21,480
- Well...
- I'll get going.

639
00:48:37,660 --> 00:48:38,770
Mr. Lee.

640
00:48:40,270 --> 00:48:41,270
Yes?

641
00:48:41,930 --> 00:48:43,700
Do you want to have dinner with me?

642
00:48:44,430 --> 00:48:47,110
- What?
- I wanted to treat you.

643
00:48:47,110 --> 00:48:49,320
There's a good restaurant
around here.

644
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:50,710
Their food is really good.

645
00:48:52,710 --> 00:48:53,710
No.

646
00:48:54,390 --> 00:48:56,480
I won't have dinner with you.

647
00:48:57,450 --> 00:48:58,450
Pardon?

648
00:48:59,090 --> 00:49:01,060
Why not? Are you busy?

649
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:03,860
No. I'm not busy.
And I'm hungry too.

650
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:07,600
- But why not?
- I get the feeling...

651
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:11,070
that you want to end things with me
over dinner.

652
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:20,240
Wait.

653
00:49:31,750 --> 00:49:33,830
Mr. Lee came to your house?

654
00:49:34,790 --> 00:49:37,360
I really don't know what I'm doing.

655
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:39,800
Don't beat yourself up.

656
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:41,960
Everyone has to take care
of their own feelings.

657
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:43,430
There's nothing you can do.

658
00:49:44,430 --> 00:49:46,110
I'm such an awful person.

659
00:49:46,570 --> 00:49:48,110
I was looking for...

660
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:50,900
how he could be similar to Kang Woo.

661
00:49:51,850 --> 00:49:53,780
"They are similar in this way."

662
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:56,380
"They are indeed cousins."

663
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:00,180
Do you miss him that much?

664
00:50:09,690 --> 00:50:12,630
Should I just tell everything
to Kang Woo and die in action?

665
00:50:39,330 --> 00:50:41,750
What if I use this as an excuse
to see him one last time?

666
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:44,630
No.

667
00:50:45,630 --> 00:50:47,460
If I see him once,
I'll want to see him again.

668
00:50:48,070 --> 00:50:49,960
If I see him twice,
I'll want to see him three times.

669
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:52,160
I can't do that.

670
00:51:12,390 --> 00:51:13,480
What is it?

671
00:51:14,030 --> 00:51:17,130
I thought
you would want to see this.

672
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:27,660
You two are making the same face.

673
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:30,380
Mr. Lee and you.

674
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:33,930
Is it true?

675
00:52:36,730 --> 00:52:37,810
Was it really...

676
00:52:38,580 --> 00:52:39,740
because of me?

677
00:52:54,250 --> 00:52:55,450
Are you okay?

678
00:53:04,490 --> 00:53:06,370
Are you not getting up
because you're in pain...

679
00:53:06,370 --> 00:53:08,160
or because you're embarrassed?

680
00:53:09,310 --> 00:53:10,430
Half and half.

681
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:16,670
My goodness.

682
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:22,020
You were missing a zero.

683
00:53:22,820 --> 00:53:25,750
Our living expenses.
What you sent was missing a zero.

684
00:53:25,790 --> 00:53:27,650
You finally noticed?

685
00:53:27,750 --> 00:53:30,360
I knew it was weird
how you didn't jump on me.

686
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:32,420
You really are
out of your mind, aren't you?

687
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:33,920
I did that on purpose.

688
00:53:34,030 --> 00:53:35,100
On purpose?

689
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:36,690
You've been odd lately.

690
00:53:37,460 --> 00:53:40,230
You couldn't cry, but lately,
you've been crying every night.

691
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:51,080
Can you even see
with such bloated eyes?

692
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:54,090
You knew that I've been crying?

693
00:53:54,090 --> 00:53:55,350
I'm your eldest brother.

694
00:53:56,980 --> 00:53:59,090
I can't seem to figure out
my own life,

695
00:53:59,090 --> 00:54:00,950
so I probably
shouldn't say this, but...

696
00:54:04,630 --> 00:54:06,390
You're the pillar of our family.

697
00:54:06,390 --> 00:54:09,690
Yes, and as a pillar,
I've been keeping my eyes on you.

698
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:14,840
And I think these sunglasses are
related to Mom and Dad's accident.

699
00:54:27,550 --> 00:54:30,320
What if Dad had made
a different decision...

700
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:35,560
instead of saving
a stupid and mean kid like me?

701
00:54:44,490 --> 00:54:45,700
When a person...

702
00:54:46,540 --> 00:54:48,270
gets into an accident
right before their eyes,

703
00:54:49,110 --> 00:54:50,900
they try their best to avoid it...

704
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:53,580
by moving further from the danger.

705
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:57,320
And a police officer said...

706
00:54:57,910 --> 00:55:00,890
all three of you could have died
from an accident like this.

707
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:03,210
He said...

708
00:55:12,630 --> 00:55:15,730
it looked like the driver
protected you with his instincts.

709
00:55:17,490 --> 00:55:18,570
What?

710
00:55:19,730 --> 00:55:22,970
It looked like the driver
turned the car toward himself...

711
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:26,940
to save the two people
who were in the back seat.

712
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:29,280
Seo Yeon.

713
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:33,440
Wake up.

714
00:55:34,550 --> 00:55:35,820
Seo Yeon.

715
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:39,650
Dad...

716
00:55:39,950 --> 00:55:43,030
It's okay. It's okay, Seo Yeon.

717
00:55:46,370 --> 00:55:49,190
It wasn't a choice they made.

718
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:51,570
It was their instincts.

719
00:55:53,070 --> 00:55:54,340
But why?

720
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:57,310
Who am I anyway?

721
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:00,280
You were their...

722
00:56:02,580 --> 00:56:04,210
one and only beloved daughter.

723
00:56:07,820 --> 00:56:09,650
No matter what the situation is,

724
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:13,920
I'm sure Mother and Father wouldn't
want to be a stumbling block...

725
00:56:14,790 --> 00:56:17,630
for their daughter's future.

726
00:56:27,070 --> 00:56:29,430
I hope your life and your love...

727
00:56:30,310 --> 00:56:31,500
which Mother and Father saved...

728
00:56:33,940 --> 00:56:36,170
end with
an extraordinarily happy ending.

729
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:19,630
I'm sorry.

730
00:57:21,030 --> 00:57:23,060
I dared to want to be with Seo Yeon.

731
00:57:24,690 --> 00:57:25,830
I'm sorry.

732
00:57:55,030 --> 00:57:56,030
Seo Yeon.

733
00:57:56,990 --> 00:57:58,150
Don't look at me.

734
00:57:59,460 --> 00:58:00,830
Don't look at us and go.

735
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:03,800
Mom and Dad will be fine.

736
00:58:05,340 --> 00:58:06,460
So don't...

737
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:09,200
Don't look back.

738
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:22,390
Good girl.

739
00:58:47,810 --> 00:58:53,180
[Joo Seo Yeon]

740
00:58:59,220 --> 00:59:02,450
Kang Woo,
I'm in front of your house.

741
00:59:02,450 --> 00:59:05,030
Do you know the owner of this phone?

742
00:59:05,030 --> 00:59:06,130
Who are you?

743
00:59:06,990 --> 00:59:10,800
There had been a car accident,
and this phone was on the site.

744
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:14,660
- What?
- There was an accident.

745
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:18,170
What do you mean?

746
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:21,850
That can't be right.

747
00:59:22,470 --> 00:59:23,640
No.

748
00:59:25,210 --> 00:59:26,390
Why would Kang Woo
get in an accident?

749
00:59:28,410 --> 00:59:29,520
No way.

750
00:59:38,450 --> 00:59:39,530
My gosh!

751
00:59:39,990 --> 00:59:41,070
What? Why?

752
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:47,000
Kang Woo?

753
00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:50,900
How are you...

754
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:52,580
What?

755
00:59:52,580 --> 00:59:53,880
Where's your phone?

756
00:59:54,050 --> 00:59:55,080
My phone?

757
00:59:57,670 --> 01:00:00,120
My gosh, I lost it.

758
01:00:01,410 --> 01:00:03,210
A car accident broke out
right in front of me,

759
01:00:03,210 --> 01:00:05,480
so I guess I dropped it
trying to make a report.

760
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:10,990
Anyway, what brings you here?

761
01:00:13,370 --> 01:00:15,490
- You aren't supposed to be...
- I like you, Kang Woo.

762
01:00:20,730 --> 01:00:23,110
What did you just say?

763
01:00:26,610 --> 01:00:27,850
I love you.

764
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:52,960
[Love With Flaws]

765
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:54,390
I can't do this to you.

766
01:01:54,390 --> 01:01:56,040
He has the right
to think and make a choice.

767
01:01:56,040 --> 01:01:57,270
Don't you like me anymore?

768
01:01:57,270 --> 01:01:58,960
I need to be abandoned by you.

769
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:00,110
You're talking nonsense.

770
01:02:00,110 --> 01:02:01,900
You're talking nonsense
despite your huge luck.

771
01:02:01,900 --> 01:02:04,280
So Min Hyuk likes her too?

772
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:06,000
You're a player, Mr. Joo.

773
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,050
Are you sure you won't regret this?

774
01:02:07,050 --> 01:02:10,280
I'm really jealous of you for
getting loved for doing nothing.

775
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:12,980
What am I going to do?
I think my dad saw the video.

776
01:02:12,980 --> 01:02:14,910
I won't let you go home.
Stop provoking me.

777
01:02:14,910 --> 01:02:16,980
I'm not leaving.
I'm staying with you.
