All right, everyone.
Let's wrap it up.

00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:37,090
Come on.

5
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,350
You do it.

6
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,500
It's mine.

7
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:48,030
May I sit here?

8
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,220
Sure.

9
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,590
All right!

10
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,590
Finally. I'm so relieved.
I can sit now.

00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,760
That was tough.

12

Let's get along well.

13
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:38,280
Hey, Kang Woo.

14
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:42,280
Didn't you see me?

15
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:44,310
Hey, you saw me.
Why did you ignore me?

16
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,750
Oh, sorry.

17
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,560
Hey, come here.

18
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,450
Come here. Hurry.

There are

I can probably eat two,

22
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:01,110
but I can't do three.

23
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,200
Do you want one?

24
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:06,750
Let's have some.

25
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:15,190
Hey, you're eating so well.

26
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,160
Do you want to be my snack buddy?

27
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,780
My friends won't eat
because they're on a diet.

28
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,970
All right. Let's seal it.

29
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:36,400
By the way, what do you draw?

30
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:40,079
You always draw stuff during class.

31
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:53,180
This is amazing.

32
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:55,329
You can do this?

33
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,150
Do you want to become a designer?

34
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:58,150
Well.

That's so cool, Kang Woo.

That's amazing.

38

How dare you do that behind my back?

40
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,770
Too close.

41

What?

42
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:37,829
You're too close.

Where are you going?

44

We have to finish talking, don't we?

45
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:56,020
Fine, let's get along.

46

What?

47
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:03,150
Are you serious? Do you mean it?

48
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:05,950
Did you read the budget plan
for the track team?

49
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:09,570
Can you sign it tomorrow? Please?

50
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,170
- Stop following me.
- What?

51
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:15,400
Oh, okay.

52
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:16,829
All right.

53
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:27,080
And just now,
it wasn't what you thought it was.

54
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:30,320
It hurts. I was in pain.

55
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:44,140
What was that?

56
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:47,370
He's not as uptight as I thought.

What's with me?

58
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,380
Do I suffer from arrhythmia?

59
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:03,520
Right, it has been a while
since I got a physical checkup.

60
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:04,850
Yes.

61
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,710
Gosh, darn it. Really?

62

- No.

Wait, wasn't there a guy
who's about this tall,

65

pretty handsome,
and wearing a white shirt?

66
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,070
- He didn't pay?
- No.

67
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:55,440
- He didn't.
- My goodness.

68
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:57,640
- What?
- What is this?

69
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:00,340
What?

70
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:03,540
Goodness, can you
give Chief Director Lee a call?

71
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,340
My goodness, look at this.

72
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:06,540
I don't know his number.

73
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:08,280
How can you not know his number?

74
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,750
You're the chief!

75
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:10,910
Did you kill him?

76
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:12,120
- How would I know?
- What?

77
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,650
- Kang Woo.
- What are we going to do?

78
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:14,760
He suddenly disappeared...

79
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,220
after you went to see him,
and he didn't even pay.

80
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:19,520
Tell me. Where did you bury him?

81
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,130
Come on.

82
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:22,890
We had a good talk.

83
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:25,740
- Goodness.
- What should I do?

84
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:28,810
My goodness, seriously?

85
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:34,900
Would you like to pay at once?

86
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:36,840
No, wait.

87
00:06:37,909 --> 00:06:39,409
Don't you usually take...

88
00:06:39,409 --> 00:06:41,490
the money in advance
when you take reservations?

89
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:43,490
Six months of installment.

90
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:44,909
- Goodness.
- Okay.

91
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:48,720
- Thank you.
- The amount exceeds the limit.

92

95
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,070
Another symptom has appeared...

96
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:02,010
other than
your irritable bowel syndrome?

97
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:03,580
- Yes.
- It looks like...

98
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:05,080
you have other feelings left...

99
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,680
other than the trauma or a grudge.

100
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:09,950
Like what?

101
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:14,820
Hatred.

102
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,120
Disdain?

103
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,520
Hostility?

104
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:26,350
Rebuke. Inhospitable. Abhorrence.

105
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,960
- Love.
- No way.

106
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:33,770
All right, let us think about this.

107
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,510
Do you get anxious
whenever you see her?

108
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:40,080
Anxiety is the biggest sign
of the emotion I mentioned...

109
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,810
- No way!
- You shouldn't...

110
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,380
just deny it like that.

111
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,640
I'm not denying it.
It's just arrhythmia.

112
00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:48,580
- But don't jump to conclusions.
- No.

113
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:50,390
- Open up your heart...
- No.

114
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:52,260
and do think about it.

115
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:53,930
No, never!

116
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:56,760
- Do you ever think of her?
- No.

117
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,950
- When you go out, or...
- No.

118
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:01,090
- when you eat something good?
- No.

119
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:03,570
Then when you are sitting around?

120
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:05,090
No.

121
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:06,600
What I'm trying to say is...

122
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,270
- What?
- It's not what.

123
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:11,100
- So does she ever...
- No.

124
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,240
- pop into your head?
- No.

125
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,450
- Right now?
- No.

126
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:14,600
- I think you're...
- No.

127
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,140
- Darn it.
- Right.

128
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,180
What?

129
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:33,370
Why in the world did I do that?

130
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:34,370
What?

131
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,770
I told you all through the night...

132
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:47,450
- that it's...
- No.

133
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:48,970
That's not it.

134
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,270
Why do you think I was like that?

135
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,520
I really want to know.

136
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,850
Why did I do that?

137
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:56,620
Oh, okay.

138
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:00,630
Your heart must've been strained
because you were too stressed out.

139
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:02,960
Right? I knew it.

140
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:07,230
Please... Please go
and get checked up.

141
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:08,230
Yes.

142
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:10,930
I knew it. That was it.

143
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:12,430
He already had the answer set.

144
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,140
What a persistent kid.

145
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:25,910
Your heart seems fine.

146
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:27,540
What? That can't be.

147
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:32,150
I'm sure there's something wrong
with my heart.

148
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:36,180
There's a rumor...

149
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,520
that my great-great-grandfather
died from heart disease.

150
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:42,230
Isn't it true that heart diseases
run in the family?

151
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:46,140
Don't worry. There's nothing wrong
with your heart.

152
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,840
And your blood result is great too.

153
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:51,110
You're healthy.

154
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:53,380
No. I'm not healthy.

155
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,250
Are you sure that
there isn't even a slim chance...

156
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:59,540
or the slimmest chance
that my heart might be sick?

157
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:08,130
Well, your cholesterol level
is slightly elevated.

158
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:09,150
That must be it.

159
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:13,000
You're a great doctor.
You really are.

160
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:18,140

You're done for.

162
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:43,280
This is awesome.

163
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:47,020
Green juice is the best
when lowering the cholesterol level.

164

Get yourself together.
Get a grip, Kang Woo.

170
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:41,850
It's about the budget
for the track team.

171
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:44,620
Didn't the chief director
approve the budget?

172
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,050
- No, he didn't.
- What?

173
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:48,230
He said that he would.

174
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:50,690
After that mess
he created last night?

175
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:53,820
Besides, he didn't come
to school today.

176
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:56,270
What? He came.

177
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:59,840
I definitely saw
his car this morning.

178
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,870
She always talks back to me.

179
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,750
No way.

180
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:15,220
No way. That can't be, right?

181
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,890
No way.

182
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:19,360
Gosh, no.

183
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:41,900
There's no point in going
to school and stressing myself out.

184
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:44,380
I'm the chief director.

185
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:47,180
I can go whenever I feel like it.

186
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:01,130
What's taking him so long?

187
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:13,010
"I will go to the place
you promised to come..."

188
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:15,400
["I will go to the place
you promised to come..."]

189
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,640
"before you."

190
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,480
["before you."]

191
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,350
"While I wait for you,"

192
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:24,150
["While I wait for you,"]

193
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:26,860
"the sound
of approaching footsteps will..."

194
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:30,520
"make my heart pound hard."

195
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:33,050
["Make my heart pound hard."]

196
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:35,190
"While I wait for you,"

197
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:37,560
["While I wait for you,"]

198
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:40,400
"I am also going to you."

199
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,030
["I am also going to you."]

200
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:00,590
"Through the door
that people come through..."

201
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:02,460
["Through the door
that people come through..."]

202
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:06,890
"I follow all the footsteps
that make my heart pound hard."

203
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:08,790
["I follow all the footsteps
that make my heart pound hard."]

204
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,470
"While I wait for you,"

205
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:13,100
["While I wait for you,"]

206
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:17,480
"I am also going to you."

207
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:20,440
["I am also going to you."]

208
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:26,020
This is a poem by Hwang Ji U.
It's called "While I Wait for You".

209
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,250
What do you think?

210
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,520
It's like a field
of seaweed fulvescens.

211
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:35,490
Wake up, you seaweed fulvescens!

212
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:37,860
You're not going to wake up.

213
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,820
Wake up!

214
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:43,190
- My gosh.
- Come on.

215
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,030
My legs hurt.

216
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:56,750
Just put on slippers.

217
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,440
Slippers don't suit this outfit.

218
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,620
No one is looking.

219
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:01,310
Me. I'm looking.

220
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:04,280
By the way, are you running
a workshop at home?

221
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:07,780
I'm talking about Seo Jun
and Joo Hee.

222
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:09,990
They're dozing off during my class.

223
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:11,690
Are they making soccer balls
at home?

224
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:13,050
Are you exploiting their labor?

225
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:16,520
"I don't care if they are playful."

226
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:19,160
"Just be healthy."
That's my motto for them.

227
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,340
Gosh, are they five years old?

228
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:24,070
Keep this in mind. If they don't
study, they'll be ranked last.

229
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:26,010
Okay. I'll take care of that.

230
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,380
Lee Kang Woo didn't come, right?

231
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,640
He'll come tomorrow.

232
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,910
Look at that. The corners
of your lips are shaking.

233
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:39,050
Are you sure you guys made up?

234
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:40,550
Yes, we did.

235
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:41,680
"Let's be friends."

236
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,960
"I'll sign it tomorrow."
That's what he said.

237
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:48,600
Let's go
before the vice-principal nags us.

238
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,800
We only have three weeks left
until the mid-terms.

239
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:03,440
Don't lounge around or waste time
thinking you have a lot of time.

240
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:06,570
Don't plagiarize questions
from study materials.

241
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:09,250
As educators, do your best
to make the tests. Be diligent...

242
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:12,120
and be responsible
to prepare for the mid-terms.

243
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:14,920
This is all for today.

244
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,730
- Okay.
- Good work.

245
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:18,820
- Thank you.
- Sir. The chief director...

246
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:20,420
will be here tomorrow, right?

247
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:24,740
I really need to get the budget
for the track team approved.

248
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,430
Well, that's up
to the chief director.

249
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:40,850
Mr. Lee.

250
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:43,440
Why do you keep giving food
to Seo Yeon?

251
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:48,990
To lure her.

252
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:50,860
What?

253
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,690
What was that?

254
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:58,430
To lure her?

255
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:02,660
I thought he liked her.
Is he doing an experiment on her?

256
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:08,140
The receiver cannot be reached.
You will be directed to voicemail.

257
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,569
If Kang Woo doesn't come
to school tomorrow...

258
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:32,900
What kind of food will energize her?

259
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:48,020
You must want to know something
to have called me yourself.

260
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,310
I heard you're working
at the school.

261
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:53,020
Aren't you relieved
that I didn't choose the company?

262
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:55,120
Do you think
you can be a threat to me?

263
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,930
If you're that nervous,
you should just get married.

264
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,470
You'll only be the CEO
once you get married.

265
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:04,360
What's the problem?
Just marry anyone.

266
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,470
See? That proves you know nothing
about business.

267
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,600
Marriage is the least
profitable business of all.

268
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,330
And I should just marry anyone?

269
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:13,100
You're unstoppable.

270
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,680
Your whole life is
a business to you, isn't it?

271
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:17,810
Since we're on the subject,
let me ask you this.

272
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:19,180
Your clothes are pretty nice.

273
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,380
Why are you so quiet?

274
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:26,490
How did you know?

275
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:28,780
Have you been surveilling me?

276
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:30,790
That's not the right word, per se.

277
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:32,430
Let's say I was managing you.

278
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,700
Don't worry. The elders don't know.

279
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:38,970
Besides, if you want to run
a fashion company, tell me.

280
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:40,170
I'll look into it.

281
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,560
You're quiet again.

282
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:47,300
I'll do it on my own.
I don't want any help.

283
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:50,810
You use our family's money for
living and entertainment expenses.

284
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,020
But you don't want our family
to get involved in your business?

285
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:55,020
Is that your pride or bravado?

286
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,780
This is something
I really want to do.

287
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,160
Pretend you don't know.

288
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,380
- I won't offer it again.
- Okay.

289
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:02,960
We'll settle that this has
no ties to Shinhwa Food?

290
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,090
- Yes.
- Good luck with that.

291
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,620
If you improve the quality,
I'll wear your brand too.

292
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,360
Bye.

293
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:12,860
I guess he wasn't
just idling his life away.

294
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:23,920
This is so annoying!

295
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:26,180
Darn it. She found out too soon.

296
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:28,110
She should've found out
after I achieved something.

297
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:29,950
Darn it. Come on!

298
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,490
Darn it.

299
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:40,000
What is it?

300
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,400
You know we have
a meeting today, right?

301
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:45,360
See you later, Mr. Lee.

302
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,910
I can't believe
Lee Kang Woo works for me!

303
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:59,370
Do they not know how to recycle?

304
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:00,720
What if I get a ticket...

305
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,690
for not recycling properly?

306
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:04,850
I'll be paying for that!

307
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:06,490
Gosh, these brats.

308
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,490
They don't care about their company.
How can they not care?

309
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:10,660
I have a great idea.

310
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:13,900
- What is it?
- It's about Park Hyun Soo.

311
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,620
There's a way I can find out
what his job is.

312
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,360
Why would we?

313
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:18,860
Aren't you curious?

314
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:20,200
If Lee Kang Woo's family
runs Shinhwa Food,

315
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,170
I'm sure Park Hyun Soo
runs a big business too.

316
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:24,330
Even so, what will you do?

317
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:26,710
I thought you weren't going
to consider him to be your husband.

318
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:29,770
You only see one thing
but fail to see the big picture.

319
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,810
From Lee Kang Woo and Park Hyun Soo,

320
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:34,610
we'll meet their mutual friends
and mutual friends of their friends.

321
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:36,040
When I keep meeting people,

322
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,610
I'm sure I'll find someone.

323
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:40,050
I doubt that
they are all like Won Seok.

324
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:43,190
My gosh,
you're indeed something else.

325
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:45,930
If you're trying to marry well
without a sense of insight...

326
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:47,470
and making this much effort,
that's stealing.

327
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:50,170
So what's your great idea?

328
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:51,440
[Park Hyun Soo]

329
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,410
Right here. He's a customer
at your bar. Take a good look.

330
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:55,710
He looks older than his age,

331
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:58,330
so he looks just like
when he was in school.

332
00:20:58,330 --> 00:20:59,600
You recognize him, right?

333
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:02,010
Why? Did he cross you or something?

334
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:04,250
Well,

335
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:05,750
actually...

336
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,540
That's a wrong move to use on him.

337
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:11,580
He won't fall for women's tears.

338
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:14,380
We need to figure out
what line of work he is in.

339
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:21,090
Well, it's just...

340
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:26,400
He and his partner...

341
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,530
hit on Seo Yeon and me.

342
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:30,710
They hit on you?

343
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:33,270
Yes. He kept asking her out
pretending that he wasn't gay.

344
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:35,100
They must have thought
it'd be fun to play us.

345
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,450
And he especially hit
on Seo Yeon a lot.

346
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,260
Look. You know who he is, right?

347
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:47,730
What does he do?

348
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:51,550
I can't remember
all of my customers.

349
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:52,730
Even if I knew,

350
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:54,970
I can't disclose
private information.

351
00:21:55,770 --> 00:21:59,330
Come on. Won Seok.

352
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:02,060
That doesn't work on him.

353
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:11,840
Have a good day.

354
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:15,840
That might have worked on Won Jae,

355
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,960
but it will never work on Won Seok.

356
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,660
What are you doing?

357
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:29,470
How does it feel...

358
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:31,830
to wake up next to
a handsome man like your brother?

359
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,240
He even smells nice.

360
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:40,440
- Are you a pervert?
- One minute.

361
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,150
- Get up.
- Will his body wear off...

362
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:43,840
- because I'm on his bed?
- Get up.

363
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:46,110
You need to look out for yourself.
Men can be dangerous.

364
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:47,950
- Won Seok.
- Get up.

365
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,580
You recognize him, right?

366
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:57,080
He and his partner...

367
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,120
hit on Seo Yeon and me.

368
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:00,790
You little punk!

369
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:03,060
Who are you?

370
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:44,830
Shinhwa High School?

371
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:47,980
Why am I running
into a student here?

372
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:49,870
He's reminding me of Joo Seo Yeon.

373
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:02,080
That only happens
when I'm stressed out...

374
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,730
in front of Joo Seo Yeon.

375
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:10,730
Hey.

376
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:12,900
Did you decide what you're going
to do for the month-end test?

377
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,740
I don't need to prepare that now.
I still have time.

378
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:18,770
Hey, it will be different this time.

379
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:21,300
- The CEO will be at the test.
- Well...

380
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:23,770
Hold on.

381
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:26,020
I think I just saw the CEO.

382
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:28,040
- What? When?
- What?

383
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,250
In the elevator.

384
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:31,420
The CEO's office is
on the top floor, isn't it?

385
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,260
My gosh, why didn't I think of that?

386
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:34,430
How did he look?

387
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:36,320
Rumor has it...

388
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,430
that he looks really ugly.

389
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:41,320
No. It's crazy.
He's unbelievably handsome.

390
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,620
- I thought he was a model.
- Really?

391
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:45,500
- Yes.
- On which floor did you see him?

392
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:48,470
- Hello.
- Hello.

393
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:49,630
Take a seat.

394
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,210
Your test at the end of the month
will be held...

395
00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:58,020
- after your mid-terms.
- What?

396
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:59,950
If you don't get your grades up
from the last report card,

397
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:02,990
you won't even be qualified
to take the test. It's from the CEO.

398
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:05,280
- That's not fair.
- Ma'am, you can't do that.

399
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,620
Be quiet.
If you don't like it, you can leave.

400
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:10,960
Of course, it would mean that you'll
be losing a highly likely chance...

401
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,820
to be a successful idol star
as the brother group of Hi-Seven.

402
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,970
Okay. You'll take turns
to tell me your goal.

403
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:18,090
Lee Hyung Won.

404
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:21,270
You're ranked 20th
in your grade, right?

405
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:25,130
You just need to keep your grades
as they are.

406
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:26,680
I'll try to be ranked 10th
this time.

407
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:29,150
If you can't achieve your goal,
it's over.

408
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:30,450
Think carefully.

409
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:31,540
I'm confident I can do it.

410
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:33,270
Okay. If you say so.

411
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,310
Next up is Joo Seo Jun.

412
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:40,460
Good for you. You have
a lot of room to climb up.

413
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:43,620
Tell me. How many places?

414
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:56,100
100 places!

415
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,980
In a way, artists are
walking advertising billboards.

416
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:01,750
What they eat and what they wear...

417
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:04,420
create an astronomical
amount of profits.

418
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:09,380
And the fans are especially loyal
when it comes to fashion.

419
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:11,720
Even if a T-shirt costs
hundreds of dollars,

420
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:13,610
if their favorite star
is wearing the shirt,

421
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:16,820
they'll even get a part-time job
to wear the same shirt.

422
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:20,090
I'll give you an example. The rate
of profits for our merchandise...

423
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:22,060
is really high as you know...

424
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:23,520
when the design is awful.

425
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,200
Let's use that to our advantage.

426
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:29,740
We should make it better
than the merchandise.

427
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:31,600
We should launch a fashion line,

428
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:35,150
so the fans as well as regular
people can wear our products.

429
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:38,450
All right. We have the models
that can promote the brand.

430
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:40,520
And we have the capital and clients.

431
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,150
What is it that we don't have?

432
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:46,020
It's the designer.

433
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:51,260
These clothes look pretty good,
don't they?

434
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,400
This guy...

435
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:56,900
designed those outfits.

436
00:26:57,230 --> 00:27:00,400
He's the designer in charge
of launching a fashion line...

437
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,530
of HS Entertainment.
His name is Lee Kang Woo.

438
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:24,260
Is that all? Is there
anything else you want to say?

439
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:29,520
Let's take it slow.

440
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:37,980
As you can see, he's very rude.

441
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:40,010
But he's a good designer,
so let's cut him some slack.

442
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:43,540
Of course, we could have invited
a very famous designer,

443
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:47,570
but if we do that, we won't
be able to take a bigger cut.

444
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:50,280
Luckily, he's not that famous.

445
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,110
So his salary wasn't that high.

446
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,420
On top of launching
our own fashion line,

447
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,280
he'll be the styling director...

448
00:27:56,280 --> 00:28:00,090
for Hi-Seven and other new groups
that will debut soon.

449
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,560
Hey.

450
00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:06,700
You're really not going
to design women's clothes?

451
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:08,740
I don't want to.

452
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:11,060
That was in the contract.
Why are you bringing that up?

453
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,680
Gosh.

454
00:28:15,370 --> 00:28:16,770
My sister found out.

455
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:20,570
What? That you're a designer
at my company?

456
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:25,050
What did she say? Did she tell you
to quit immediately?

457
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:26,420
No. It's the opposite.

458
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:27,960
She told me to submit a proposal...

459
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,380
if I wanted to run
a fashion company.

460
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:30,520
She'll look into it.

461
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,520
Really?

462
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:34,970
Hey, get some investment
from Shinhwa Food.

463
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:36,060
Hey!

464
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:38,630
Okay, okay. Fine.

465
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:41,740
Let's do this
with my money and your brain.

466
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:46,570
It's ready, sir.

467
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:48,410
Okay. Let's go.

468
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,950
Gosh, what is it this time?

469
00:28:58,220 --> 00:28:59,690
Hey, lighten up.

470
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,990
Hey.

471
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:06,050
Hey.

472
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:08,560
Try to lighten up.

473
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,590
You're nobody here.

474
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:10,970
You're not the grandson
of Shinhwa Food's chairwoman.

475
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:12,630
You're just an employee.

476
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:14,670
No one hit it big by themselves.

477
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:17,270
They'll be helping you out.

478
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:20,740
Hey.

479
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:22,980
If you don't want to do anything,

480
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:25,250
then ask your family for money
and start off comfortably.

481
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:27,220
I won't ask for the damage.
Should we call it off?

482
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:29,580
- Should I call Kang Hee?
- No way. Come on.

483
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,580
I never said I won't go. I'll go.

484
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,670
Is she here often?

485
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:50,210

Kang Woo, is something wrong?

646
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:09,410
Are you ill?

647
00:43:09,410 --> 00:43:11,100
Things are a bit hectic at school...

648
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:12,700
because the chief director
isn't here.

649
00:43:28,930 --> 00:43:30,980
May I have that?

650
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:36,670
I want something sweet
because I'm stressed out.

651
00:43:46,230 --> 00:43:49,200
You're welcome here anytime
if you want some snacks.

652
00:43:51,310 --> 00:43:52,610
Thank you.

653
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:02,580
Lured successfully.

654
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:09,930
Call Kang Woo
and ask him to meet you.

655
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:13,770
What? Why should I meet him?

656
00:44:13,990 --> 00:44:17,730
Whether you beg him or threaten him,
you need to see him first.

657
00:44:17,730 --> 00:44:18,910
Forget it.

658
00:44:18,910 --> 00:44:21,470
What if he continues
to not show up at school?

659
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:23,910
You said Joo Hee has been
running every single morning.

660
00:44:25,070 --> 00:44:27,180
I don't even know his number.

661
00:44:35,450 --> 00:44:36,980
Why? What is it?

662
00:44:38,030 --> 00:44:39,160
Hello?

663
00:44:43,490 --> 00:44:44,590
Hello?

664
00:44:45,490 --> 00:44:46,640
Hello?

665
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:48,810
What is this?

666
00:44:48,830 --> 00:44:49,860
Hi!

667
00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:55,680
- Who is it?
- I'm...

668
00:44:56,550 --> 00:44:58,470
I'm Joo Seo Yeon.

669
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:01,340
Why haven't you been
coming to school?

670
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:03,390
Are you ill?

671
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:06,060
Let's meet up.

672
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:08,850
The budget for the track team is
a very important issue.

673
00:45:08,950 --> 00:45:11,760
Could you meet me
and at least hear me out?

674
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:15,820
Seo Yeon,
I guess you are in a hurry.

675
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:20,040
Hello? Did you hang up? Hello?

676
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:23,410
I'm not sure.
When should we meet up?

677
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:25,730
I can meet you right now.

678
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:29,780
I'm so sorry.
I'm really tired right now.

679
00:45:30,070 --> 00:45:32,050
If it's that urgent,
you can come to my place.

680
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:34,650
Well, I'm sure
you wouldn't want to do that.

681
00:45:34,650 --> 00:45:36,340
- I'll be there.
- What?

682
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:37,390
I'll go.

683
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:39,210
Can you text me your address?

684
00:45:40,310 --> 00:45:42,390
Oh, okay.

685
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:49,820
She's coming over to a guy's house
in the middle of the night?

686
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:52,560
Seo Yeon, are you insane?

687
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:57,040
What's with him?
He's willing to see me.

688
00:45:58,410 --> 00:46:01,200
Wait, how do you know his number?

689
00:46:02,550 --> 00:46:04,740
I should know my boss's number
as an employee.

690
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:08,340
I asked Ms. Park of Administration
with a cup of coffee.

691
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,080
Hey, he sent me the address.

692
00:46:13,390 --> 00:46:14,660
Let's go.

693
00:46:16,950 --> 00:46:20,260
Hey, if you can't persuade him,
get him drunk.

694
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:22,270
- Drunk?
- During the gathering,

695
00:46:22,270 --> 00:46:23,690
he wouldn't drink at all.

696
00:46:23,690 --> 00:46:25,830
I could tell
that he gets drunk easily.

697
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:28,330
Make him sign it
while he's completely wasted...

698
00:46:28,330 --> 00:46:30,700
as if he's signing
the credit card bill.

699
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:33,330
"Goodness, sir, you're so drunk."

700
00:46:33,330 --> 00:46:35,230
"You need to pay, though.
Signature, please."

701
00:46:35,230 --> 00:46:36,510
Oh, okay.

702
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:39,650
- Man.
- Oh, man.

703
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:42,020
I almost signed that just now.

704
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:43,920
Tricky, tricky.

705
00:46:44,050 --> 00:46:46,020
Get tricky and make him sign it!

706
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:47,850
- Hey, I'm hungry.
- Tricky, tricky.

707
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:53,060
You two should get married.

708
00:46:53,450 --> 00:46:55,450
You can marry each other
or marry someone else, whatever.

709
00:46:56,930 --> 00:46:59,270
Did Won Seok take his car?

710
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:01,360
No, it's parked out there.

711
00:47:01,490 --> 00:47:02,830
I'll bring the key. Come outside.

712
00:47:02,830 --> 00:47:03,830
Okay.

713
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:05,830
I'm hungry!

714
00:47:05,830 --> 00:47:08,040
Find whatever you can eat, kid.

715
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:10,650
Your sister and I are
extremely busy right now.

716
00:47:10,970 --> 00:47:12,180
Oh, right. Hyun Soo.

717
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:19,450
[Park Hyun Soo]

718
00:47:19,820 --> 00:47:21,510
Hey, this guy.

719
00:47:21,510 --> 00:47:22,660
Why? Do you know him?

720
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:24,330
Yes, he's a guy at my agency...

721
00:47:24,330 --> 00:47:25,720
Your agency? HS Entertainment?

722
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:28,330
Is HS Entertainment
named after his name, Hyun Soo?

723
00:47:28,330 --> 00:47:29,720
He's a janitor.

724
00:47:31,190 --> 00:47:32,290
A janitor?

725
00:48:03,370 --> 00:48:05,430
Gosh, darn it. This is so annoying.

726
00:48:11,340 --> 00:48:13,500
[Joo Seo Yeon]

727
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:26,120
Is she really going to come?

728
00:48:28,510 --> 00:48:29,630
I have something to say.

729
00:48:30,190 --> 00:48:31,550
What's your address?

730
00:48:32,130 --> 00:48:33,290
I'll go there right now.

731
00:48:35,450 --> 00:48:36,460
No.

732
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:38,960
I'm sure she won't come just like
that time when she said she would.

733
00:48:40,730 --> 00:48:41,730
Whatever.

734
00:48:42,230 --> 00:48:43,700
She's still the same person.

735
00:48:44,110 --> 00:48:45,110
Whatever!

736
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:01,590
I guess he is indeed
a grandson of a rich family.

737
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:09,100
Here.

738
00:49:09,330 --> 00:49:10,720
Don't just sit there.
It's about time.

739
00:50:06,390 --> 00:50:07,590
She really came?

740
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:12,050
I couldn't think
of anything else to buy.

741
00:50:13,250 --> 00:50:16,130
My gosh, this is a nice house.

742
00:50:21,490 --> 00:50:23,030
She even bought alcohol?

743
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:27,440
A grandson of a rich family
and a janitor?

744
00:50:28,110 --> 00:50:29,110
Are they like the prince
and the beggar?

745
00:50:29,110 --> 00:50:31,000
The master and the servant?

746
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:34,770
Wait. How was he able
to afford all of his clothes?

747
00:50:37,710 --> 00:50:39,480
Lee Kang Woo
must have paid for them!

748
00:50:41,010 --> 00:50:44,250
And he looked down on me?
Darn him.

749
00:50:54,070 --> 00:50:55,600
He even knows the passcode.

750
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:57,840
They are really together.

751
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:29,800
As for the bus rental fee,
accommodation, and food,

752
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:31,800
I tried to get the lowest quotes.

753
00:51:34,470 --> 00:51:36,540
There are only five pages.

754
00:51:36,540 --> 00:51:39,080
But you're taking a long time
to read them.

755
00:51:41,740 --> 00:51:44,010
I meant that you were meticulous.

756
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:28,160
- It says there's a hole.
- We have to stick it in.

757
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:29,790
But there's no hole.

758
00:52:30,190 --> 00:52:31,790
No, don't put it like that.

759
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:40,800
You're unbelievable, Mi Kyung.

760
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:42,500
You came to Kang Woo's house now?

761
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:44,240
So you know he's the grandson
of Shinhwa Group's chairwoman.

762
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:46,710
Were you trying to barge into
his home and try to seduce him?

763
00:52:46,710 --> 00:52:49,210
Look. Are you telling me
what you were going to do?

764
00:52:49,710 --> 00:52:50,710
Look.

765
00:52:50,780 --> 00:52:53,210
Do you think you're
on the same level as Kang Woo?

766
00:52:53,210 --> 00:52:55,820
My gosh, this is
why I always tell him...

767
00:52:55,820 --> 00:52:57,220
not to disclose who his family is.

768
00:52:57,220 --> 00:52:58,690
Hustlers will be all over him.

769
00:52:58,690 --> 00:52:59,900
What? "Hustler"?

770
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:01,290
- Hey!
- You startled me.

771
00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:03,930
- What?
- You're pooping with your words!

772
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:07,230
Hey, you jerk.
I at least make an effort.

773
00:53:07,230 --> 00:53:08,790
To marry a nice guy
from a nice family,

774
00:53:08,790 --> 00:53:10,000
I studied my head off...

775
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,640
and became a teacher
at a prestigious high school.

776
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:14,730
And I'm living my life
with the money I earn!

777
00:53:14,730 --> 00:53:16,880
- What about you?
- What about me?

778
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:20,210
You're exploiting Lee Kang Woo
because he's your lover.

779
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:24,150
- What?
- You're not lovers?

780
00:53:24,150 --> 00:53:25,210
Is he your sponsor?

781
00:53:25,590 --> 00:53:27,210
How dare you try
to give me a lecture?

782
00:53:27,210 --> 00:53:28,710
What? "Hustler"?

783
00:53:28,710 --> 00:53:30,190
Wait. Back up.

784
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:33,360
What do you mean by I'm his lover
and he's my sponsor?

785
00:53:33,690 --> 00:53:34,930
I'm sorry.

786
00:53:34,930 --> 00:53:38,370
I'll apologize
if you didn't want to come out.

787
00:53:38,370 --> 00:53:39,790
But you were the one
who started this.

788
00:53:39,790 --> 00:53:42,340
Wait. Hold on. Wait a second.

789
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:46,300
Kang Woo and I...

790
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:48,940
Why? How?

791
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:50,500
Seo Yeon...

792
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,350
saw you at a gay bar.

793
00:53:53,350 --> 00:53:54,420
- What?
- Don't worry.

794
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:56,940
We respect your decisions.
I won't tell other people.

795
00:53:56,940 --> 00:53:59,450
Anyway, I didn't come here
for an ulterior motive.

796
00:53:59,450 --> 00:54:01,710
Seo Yeon had something to say
to Kang Woo about school.

797
00:54:01,710 --> 00:54:02,860
So I came with her.

798
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:05,690
Do you think I would try
to seduce a man...

799
00:54:05,690 --> 00:54:07,250
who's not interested in women?

800
00:54:07,250 --> 00:54:10,130
Wait, things might work out
more easily than I thought.

801
00:54:10,290 --> 00:54:12,630
If they think
Kang Woo and I are lovers,

802
00:54:12,690 --> 00:54:14,170
they won't try to hit on us.

803
00:54:14,170 --> 00:54:16,370
Hey. Are you listening to me?

804
00:54:21,110 --> 00:54:22,200
Yes.

805
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:26,620
I don't have to hide it
since you already know.

806
00:54:27,820 --> 00:54:28,920
That's right.

807
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:31,850
Kang Woo and I...

808
00:54:35,010 --> 00:54:36,090
are partners.

809
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:41,750
Right.

810
00:54:44,930 --> 00:54:46,790
Excuse me. If you have some time,

811
00:54:46,790 --> 00:54:49,230
can you help me pitch the tent?

812
00:54:49,230 --> 00:54:50,800
Sure. Let's go.

813
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:51,960
- Thank you.
- Sure.

814
00:55:05,590 --> 00:55:07,950
Well, can I use your bathroom?

815
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:33,920
She visited a man who lives alone...

816
00:55:34,180 --> 00:55:35,510
at this late hour...

817
00:55:35,650 --> 00:55:37,190
with a whole bag, full of alcohol?

818
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:40,780
This is just an excuse.

819
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:49,690
My gosh, he should bring me
some snacks at least.

820
00:55:49,790 --> 00:55:51,720
Seriously.
Rich people are the stingiest.

821
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:57,960
Where on earth is his bathroom?

822
00:56:43,010 --> 00:56:46,210
Well, I was looking
for the bathroom.

823
00:56:46,550 --> 00:56:47,660
It's that way.

824
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:03,570
You can do this?

825
00:57:03,870 --> 00:57:04,870
This is amazing.

826
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,270
Do you want to become a designer?

827
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:07,910
Well. I just...

828
00:57:08,030 --> 00:57:10,180
That's so cool, Kang Woo.

829
00:57:13,350 --> 00:57:15,380
He's still drawing designs.

830
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:18,420
Some things about Kang Woo
haven't changed.

831
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:53,950
[Mi Kyung]

832
00:57:53,950 --> 00:57:55,890
This is crazy.
Park Hyun Soo just admitted...

833
00:57:55,890 --> 00:57:57,690
that he and Lee Kang Woo are lovers.

834
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:17,180
Did you read over it?

835
00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:20,010
No, I'm going to read it
two more times.

836
00:58:21,650 --> 00:58:24,210
You'll probably give up
and go home at this point,

837
00:58:24,590 --> 00:58:25,780
Seo Yeon.

838
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:31,690
Okay, you can take your time.

839
00:58:31,780 --> 00:58:32,930
Darn it.

840
00:58:38,870 --> 00:58:42,400
I can see a little bit of
how he looked when he was younger.

841
00:58:44,610 --> 00:58:48,000
What is this? You're going to
stare at me with such fiery eyes?

842
00:58:48,530 --> 00:58:50,680
I'm sorry, Seo Yeon.

843
00:58:50,850 --> 00:58:52,910
I won't fall
for something like that.

844
00:58:52,910 --> 00:58:55,580
I'm a guy who didn't care
for all those women.

845
00:58:55,580 --> 00:58:57,320
What makes you think
you're different?

846
00:59:00,250 --> 00:59:01,550
Gosh. It's cold.

847
00:59:04,860 --> 00:59:07,190
That was on purpose.
She did that on purpose, didn't she?

848
00:59:07,190 --> 00:59:08,990
Why did the beer suddenly burst?

849
00:59:11,930 --> 00:59:13,260
My gosh, what a loss.

850
00:59:52,570 --> 00:59:53,800
Yes, Aunt.

851
00:59:57,500 --> 00:59:59,680
Oh, he hasn't been coming
to school for a few days.

852
01:00:00,270 --> 01:00:02,770
I came to his place right now.
I'll see if he's all right.

853
01:00:04,540 --> 01:00:06,150
Don't worry. I'm sure he's fine.

854
01:00:12,980 --> 01:00:14,750
Which part do you not understand?

855
01:00:15,050 --> 01:00:16,460
I'll explain it to you.

856
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:23,840
What is it? Which part?

857
01:00:32,110 --> 01:00:33,210
You should go.

858
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:35,120
What?

859
01:00:35,540 --> 01:00:36,820
You should go.

860
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:39,950
What about the signature?

861
01:00:39,950 --> 01:00:42,280
Even a five-year-old would have
understood it by now.

862
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:43,690
Why won't you sign it?

863
01:00:43,690 --> 01:00:45,950
Is it because of
what happened in the past?

864
01:00:45,950 --> 01:00:48,830
You didn't ask me out
because you really liked me.

865
01:00:48,830 --> 01:00:50,330
You were trying to humiliate me
because you made a bet...

866
01:00:50,330 --> 01:00:51,570
When did I...

867
01:01:15,660 --> 01:01:17,720
You're very strong.

868
01:01:37,770 --> 01:01:38,800
Why?

869
01:01:43,150 --> 01:01:44,420
It's over.

870
01:02:04,730 --> 01:02:06,340
[Love With Flaws]

871
01:02:07,110 --> 01:02:08,640
This is humiliating.

872
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:10,680
Can you be that chill
about that incident?

873
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:13,580
I'll show you how low I can go.

874
01:02:13,580 --> 01:02:15,710
Man, you're such a thug.

875
01:02:15,710 --> 01:02:17,090
Do you have a girlfriend?

876
01:02:17,090 --> 01:02:18,390
You might find someone nearby.

877
01:02:18,390 --> 01:02:20,120
I also think she's probably nearby.

878
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:21,920
Don't get so friendly with Min Hyuk.

879
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:23,390
What's all this?

880
01:02:23,390 --> 01:02:24,390
Do you like it?

881
01:02:24,390 --> 01:02:28,130
I hope you can stay
by my side, Seo Yeon.
