1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available.]

2
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:27,200
What do you mean? What feelings?

3
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,510
When I kissed Kang Woo,

4
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,930
I didn't feel anything.

5
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:33,200
What?

6
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:37,510
I think something is wrong with me.

7
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:39,980
I like Ms. Joo Seo Yeon.

8
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:42,190
I came to say that.

9
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:44,590
I ended up hearing something
that I didn't have to hear.

10
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:49,090
And you ended up...

11
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,960
saying something
you didn't have to say.

12
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,530
I thought it needed to be said,

13
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:55,930
although you probably already knew.

14
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,460
Bad news for you.

15
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:00,770
Seo Yeon already likes me.

16
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:02,270
Do you feel confident?

17
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:04,310
Yes.

18
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:06,810
Okay, then.

19
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,280
I thought you got that for me.

20
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:14,520
I did.

21
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:17,039
But come to think about it,
why should I do that for you?

22
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:24,060
You are concerned about him,
aren't you?

23
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,250
And you think about him too.

24
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,570
When he says he likes you,

25
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:31,570
don't you feel
all tingly right here?

26
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:35,830
I think so.

27
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:39,470
Then why didn't you feel anything?

28
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:51,360
What are you doing?

29
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,380
I was wondering
if you're more like Won Seok...

30
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,330
but just haven't realized it yet.

31
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:57,460
- No, that's not the case.
- Are you sure?

32
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:02,190
Gosh, then there's only one reason.

33
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:04,800
It means Kang Woo has
absolutely no skills.

34
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:07,070
What?

35
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:09,530
I mean he's an awfully bad kisser.

36
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:11,680
A man with zero skills.
Isn't that it?

37
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,580
I'm not sure.

38
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:18,180
I don't think
I'm particularly good either.

39
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:20,640
Figures. You and Kang Woo are
both love-shy.

40
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,020
I can see what happened.

41
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,660
How is it supposed to feel?

42
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,430
How am I supposed to explain this?

43
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,360
It's as if a firework goes off
from the tip of your toes,

44
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,760
goes through your body,
then out through your head.

45
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:37,120
- Let's go.
- Where to?

46
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,140
There's no use
in explaining this to you.

47
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:40,740
What's important is the real deal.

48
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,140
Ho Dol.

49
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:52,020
Hey, why did you
want to see me here?

50
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:54,110
What's wrong? Why not?

51
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:58,020
Oh, this isn't just a pub. It's...

52
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,020
I know.

53
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,430
- I'm a regular here.
- What?

54
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:03,550
Wait, you didn't notice?

55
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:08,670
I knew what you were like at once.

56
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:21,950
Do you know what happened to me
after you ran away with the deposit?

57
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:24,050
And what now? You need money?

58
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:26,050
What does your awesome man ever do?

59
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,110
Don't ever call me again.

60
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,050
You and I aren't sisters anymore!

61
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:33,550
Darn it.

62
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:46,770
You have no money to get it fixed.

63
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:06,680
- What are you up to?
- What?

64
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:08,960
It looked like you were spacing out.

65
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,960
Do you want to eat?
I'm going to make bibimbap.

66
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,990
No, I'll eat later.

67
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,340
How can you turn the lights off
knowing I was in there?

68
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:32,370
Sorry. I got confused.

69
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:33,710
Didn't you do it on purpose?

70
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,210
No.

71
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:37,490
I really didn't.

72
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,360
Man, you surprised me.

73
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:41,590
Seo Jun.

74
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,250
I'm going to tell Ms. Joo...

75
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:49,360
that you've been acting weird.

76
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:51,670
- I think she should know...
- She does know.

77
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:54,060
Then you wouldn't mind
even if I told her.

78
00:04:58,780 --> 00:04:59,870
Who do you think you are?

79
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,650
Do you think you are...

80
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:03,980
a part of our family
just because you live here?

81
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:07,010
You're just living off us.

82
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:08,680
You're just a stranger.

83
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:12,010
So don't get involved
with our family matters.

84
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:14,110
Just stay silent and leave quietly,

85
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:15,450
as soon as possible.

86
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:40,850
What? What do you want me to do?

87
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:41,990
You need to kiss someone else...

88
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:44,680
to find out if you're the problem
or if it's him.

89
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,880
You're insane.

90
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,860
This is a very important matter
between a couple.

91
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:50,230
No matter
how much you like each other,

92
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:51,450
if you don't hit it off this way,

93
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:54,190
you two can last only a few months,
no, not even a few days.

94
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,260
And you expect me to get any guy...

95
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:58,130
and ask him to kiss me?

96
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:00,600
This is the best place to kiss
without any feelings attached.

97
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,610
What are you up to?

98
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:04,980
Seo Yeon needs to work
on her kissing skills...

99
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,610
No, we aren't up to anything.

100
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:08,050
We came for the free drinks.

101
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:10,440
Give us some drinks.
Drinks. Alcohol.

102
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:14,050
Keep your mouth shut, okay?

103
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,380
Okay.

104
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:35,500
Yes, let's do this.

105
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:37,909
Let's try it.

106
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:44,610
Let's do it.

107
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,150
- What?
- Let's do it.

108
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:50,380
What are you talking about? Do what?

109
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:52,659
What is it?

110
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:01,560
That was so sudden.

111
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,470
Let's do it again.

112
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:08,170
What?

113
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,910
How much...

114
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,300
did you drink?

115
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:17,070
What?

116
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,980
If you're going to black out,

117
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:20,720
I'm going to stop here.

118
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:23,720
It's okay. I'm not that drunk.

119
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:25,380
You started it first,

120
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:27,990
okay?

121
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:06,430
I think...

122
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,120
Yes?

123
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:10,690
I'm going...

124
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,970
to marry Mi Kyung.

125
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:15,910
What?

126
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:19,740
You're insane.
How could you say that?

127
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,410
Why am I like this? Why?

128
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:26,150
What do you think?

129
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:28,680
Since you've been avoiding
handsome guys,

130
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,590
your nerve cells just don't react
when you're in front of them.

131
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:38,490
Stop drinking.

132
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:47,170
- I'm a lunatic.
- You're right.

133
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:49,560
- I'm a fool.
- Did you just realize that?

134
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,800
I'm worth less than the dirt
in my toenails.

135
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,480
- I'm the most worthless thing.
- Exactly.

136
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,680
But I'm uselessly resilient.

137
00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:00,050
So even during the apocalypse,
I'll survive...

138
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:02,920
and live this idiotic life
once again.

139
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:03,940
Probably so.

140
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:06,710
I don't benefit this world
by the slightest bit.

141
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:08,980
I'm a total idiot.

142
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:14,900
I should get her exorcised.

143
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:17,190
Why are all the guys around her
so flawed?

144
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:18,800
My gosh!

145
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:23,200
What are you doing?

146
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:29,180
I almost fainted.

147
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,440
So why was Seo Yeon okay?

148
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,070
Are you talking about her again?

149
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:38,260
That's why I advised you
to date some women.

150
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:40,620
You make it obvious
that you've never dated anyone.

151
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:42,950
How could your emotions depend
solely on her?

152
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:47,090
Kang Woo, life is extremely short.

153
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:50,170
It's such a waste to cling
onto a woman.

154
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:54,270
If you don't think it's meant to be,
just end it.

155
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:56,540
"Meant to be"?

156
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,200
I decide my own fate!

157
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,930
Me! Seo Yeon! That's the end!

158
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:02,680
What kind of crazy, one-sided love
is this?

159
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,520
You're frightening me.

160
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,120
One mistake, and you'll be put
behind bars.

161
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:13,050
What in the world
did she say to you?

162
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:15,050
She wants to marry Mi Kyung.

163
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:16,930
My gosh.

164
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,300
What?

165
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:30,560
I don't know who you are,
but you're dead meat.

166
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:39,940
I'm coming for you.

167
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,350
- Hey, it's me! It's me!
- Die! Die!

168
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:47,980
Stop it! It's me!

169
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,160
- Get out! Get out!
- Give me a minute!

170
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,670
Look at this...

171
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:03,100
Gosh, I love it.

172
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:05,600
You've chosen to use toilet paper
instead of box tissue.

173
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,300
You're so economical.

174
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:09,180
Oh, my.

175
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,940
Look at that. You reused the dishes.

176
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:14,710
You're saving water fee
and the environment at once.

177
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:18,210
Why are you here?

178
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:25,430
You said you never accepted things
from guys without a reason, right?

179
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:32,590
Reason? I can give you one.

180
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,270
What? What is this?

181
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:38,410
You're mine from now on.

182
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:18,550
- What? Grandma.
- Gosh.

183
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,790
Goodness, sir.

184
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:27,520
I had absolutely no idea that
you were her grandson.

185
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:30,660
I'm truly sorry
for inconveniencing you.

186
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,530
What are you doing?

187
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:36,320
Stand up. What's going on?

188
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,370
You.

189
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:39,800
- Did you abuse your power?
- What?

190
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,640
Goodness, not at all, ma'am.

191
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,880
I should've been more obedient,

192
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,540
but I focused more
on my principles and beliefs.

193
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,150
It is entirely my fault.

194
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,250
Sir.

195
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:54,520
Here. I'm kneeling down.

196
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,620
Stand up.

197
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,250
Please show me mercy just this once!

198
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:59,050
We are truly sorry!

199
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:02,320
Please forgive me!

200
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,220
Please think of my family!

201
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:08,270
I'm sorry.

202
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:10,220
Not at all.

203
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,370
It's my fault for forcing you
to do this.

204
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:17,300
From what I heard,
you made a servant...

205
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:20,040
out of a contract teacher.

206
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,780
That's not it...

207
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:24,810
The higher your position,

208
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:28,620
the more people
become interested in you.

209
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:32,080
You should've been careful.

210
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:38,160
I don't think this is
the right position for you.

211
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,160
- You can stop.
- What do you mean?

212
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,170
I don't need to wait for a year.

213
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:45,230
You won't be able to hold out
for a whole year.

214
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:46,590
Come to the headquarters.

215
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:47,590
Grandma.

216
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:50,330
I will hand over this position
to someone who's more fitting.

217
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:58,280
What is going on?

218
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,020
You told me to do what I wanted.

219
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:07,710
So? You've chosen to be
the chief director?

220
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,550
- Yes.
- So...

221
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,900
you have no ulterior motives?

222
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:13,800
No, I do.

223
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:17,170
But isn't that the same case
for you as well?

224
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:19,770
You know very well...

225
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:23,270
that I'll do a better job than you.

226
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:28,150
Do what you want. Don't be chained.

227
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:34,940
Grandma isn't that conservative,
you know?

228
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,590
Hey, this is huge.

229
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:54,910
- Kang Woo was abandoned.
- What?

230
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:57,140
He's no longer going to be
the chief director.

231
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:59,600
But is it possible...

232
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,780
for him to be kicked out
of his family's school?

233
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:33,230
What happened?

234
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:35,150
It's true that I was on a bit...

235
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:37,600
of a power trip.

236
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,650
"A bit"?

237
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:42,310
It's a bit more than that.

238
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,080
Darn it.

239
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,180
Is it that hard to just lie
and comfort me?

240
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:50,290
I feel bad about lying.

241
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:53,660
Is she turning into Min Hyuk?

242
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,910
Perhaps, it's for the best.

243
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,180
Mi Kyung told me.

244
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,550
If it wasn't for you,

245
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:14,440
Seo Jun would've been in trouble.

246
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:16,180
It's going to be great.

247
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,290
You know my older brothers
look like models, right?

248
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:22,530
I'll make them wear your clothes
as often as possible.

249
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:25,820
If I see someone wearing
one of your clothes,

250
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:27,590
I'll tell them
that my friend made it...

251
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:29,060
and that they should be honored.

252
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,770
So don't be too sad.

253
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:35,200
Okay?

254
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,800
Are we just friends?

255
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:43,100
Whenever...

256
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:46,120
I think of you,
I feel butterflies.

257
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:47,840
When you're in front of me,

258
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:49,650
I think I'll go crazy.

259
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,810
You know, I...

260
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:54,920
That's how I feel.

261
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:58,500
So please...

262
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,530
like me.

263
00:17:12,329 --> 00:17:14,010
Show me some affection.

264
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:43,200
"Don't look for me."

265
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:45,640
"I met someone nice
and am leaving with him."

266
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,730
Do whatever it takes to find her.

267
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,040
I'll pay you however much you want.

268
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,990
You dare to...

269
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,520
elope with a man?

270
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,100
Whenever...

271
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:16,730
I think of you,
I feel butterflies.

272
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:18,840
When you're in front of me,

273
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:20,810
I think I'll go crazy.

274
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,590
Jang Mi.

275
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:40,190
Seo Yeon.

276
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:44,520
Why...

277
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:47,690
I was mistaken.

278
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,000
Seo Yeon, about Seo Jun.

279
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:52,410
Come here.

280
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:02,620
Choi Ho Dol.

281
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,180
Why are you avoiding me?

282
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:06,950
Well...

283
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:09,630
I didn't know that you were...

284
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:12,220
So what? Are you disappointed?

285
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,830
Gosh, no.

286
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:16,020
It's just a bit sudden.

287
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,460
I like you.

288
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:20,900
- What?
- What do you think about me?

289
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,460
Well...

290
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:25,410
So...

291
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:26,410
Is there...

292
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,410
someone else?

293
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,240
No.

294
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:37,120
Shall we date?

295
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,360
- What?
- What do you say?

296
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,790
It's a bit...

297
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,020
No pressure.

298
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:51,460
Let's take our time.

299
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:02,970
Did you see that?

300
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:05,150
This will be a hit on social media.

301
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:06,150
What a masterpiece.

302
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:07,470
- Are you all right?
- Poor you.

303
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:09,940
- Is he crying?
- Look.

304
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:12,450
- You look nice. Smile for me.
- I didn't know this about you.

305
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:13,590
What's wrong?

306
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:15,330
- Come on.
- Hey, hey.

307
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:17,020
- Talk about it.
- What's wrong?

308
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,180
What's the matter?

309
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:20,560
Did you really think
I'd be like you?

310
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:35,910
Hey. Don't you work today?

311
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:37,650
Don't you have a lesson today?

312
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:39,440
Usually yes, but not today.

313
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,510
- Why not?
- Mr. Choi called.

314
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:43,210
He has other plans
and can't come today.

315
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,440
Plans?

316
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:47,420
- What plans?
- I don't know.

317
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,990
I made a friend.

318
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,030
He's really cool and kind.

319
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:04,370
Don't look at me like that.

320
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,380
I'm here as a customer.

321
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:13,740
- Hey.
- How are things these days?

322
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:15,480
What do you mean?

323
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,480
Don't you need medication?

324
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,250
No. I'm fine.

325
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,930
Tell the truth.

326
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:25,720
About what? I said I'm fine.

327
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:28,250
If you're that worried,
raise my allowance.

328
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:29,720
I never have enough money...

329
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:34,640
Seo Yeon.

330
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:36,810
What are you doing? It's not funny.

331
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:38,970
Don't do this.

332
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,810
Seo Yeon.

333
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:43,740
Seo Yeon!

334
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:45,650
I said don't do this!

335
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:48,270
What are you doing?

336
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,100
I'm sorry.

337
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:37,100
I'm sorry.

338
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:51,850
I'm okay.

339
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:54,120
I'm fine if I live
where it's bright.

340
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:57,210
You're not well yet.
Let's see a doctor.

341
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:58,590
I'm sorry.

342
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:00,250
It's my fault.

343
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:01,860
It's my fault.

344
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:03,630
No, it's my fault.

345
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,750
I'm sorry, Seo Jun.

346
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:10,130
Darn it!

347
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:12,990
I didn't tell you because
I knew you'd be like this!

348
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,400
Darn it.

349
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,730
Where are you going?

350
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:16,760
Out!

351
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,910
That idiot.

352
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:23,610
Send him back to
the doctor he used to see.

353
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,120
He listens to you
more than he does us.

354
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:29,320
He acts like I'm invisible.

355
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:33,060
He calls himself a guy
and doesn't want Seo Yeon to worry.

356
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,680
I pleaded with you.

357
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:03,540
I told you not to tell.

358
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:04,650
What?

359
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:24,700
Oh, by the way...

360
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:28,430
The day of Mom and Dad's accident.

361
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:32,080
Was I not at home?

362
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:37,320
I think I left to see someone.

363
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:38,950
Why do you ask?

364
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:41,920
I just wanted to check.

365
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:48,100
Do you remember something?

366
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,430
No, not really.

367
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:54,400
No, don't bother, okay?

368
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:11,420
Is Seo Jun very angry?

369
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:14,320
Did you tell?

370
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:16,930
Well, I just...

371
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:20,450
I thought Seo Yeon would be worried.

372
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:23,190
Did I mess up?

373
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:25,430
No.

374
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:27,340
You did right.

375
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,340
It was the right thing.

376
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:37,940
"Why isn't she coming?"

377
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:41,270
"She said she had something to say
and asked for my address."

378
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:43,040
"Why isn't she coming?"

379
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:47,560
"Does she think I'm a joke?"
That's what I thought.

380
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:51,780
What did I have to say?

381
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:55,670
If I said I'd see him at night,

382
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:57,760
it must've been important.

383
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:07,840
You're home. You're late.

384
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:08,970
Yes.

385
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:11,610
So...

386
00:26:23,890 --> 00:26:25,520
You found out?

387
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:27,330
Joo Seo Jun...

388
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:31,520
The truth is,
when you weren't home,

389
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,400
there was a power cut.

390
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:35,170
That time too...

391
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,030
He reacted?

392
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,180
I'm sorry.

393
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:42,240
I wanted to tell you...

394
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,440
It's okay.

395
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:45,200
Seo Jun would've stopped you.

396
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:50,280
May I ask you for the reason?

397
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:01,630
On the day of my parents' accident,

398
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,790
as soon as we got the call,

399
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:10,460
we quickly headed over
to the hospital.

400
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:14,970
We forgot about baby Seo Jun...

401
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,910
who was sleeping alone in the room.

402
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:19,710
Mom.

403
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:23,010
Mom.

404
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,780
Mom.

405
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,860
Mom.

406
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:31,780
Mom...

407
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,430
Mom...

408
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:56,940
Mom...

409
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:59,860
Mom...

410
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:06,950
He was there all alone
until the morning.

411
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,490
It must've been awfully scary.

412
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,190
He just woke up from his sleep
like any other day,

413
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:18,260
but Mom and Dad were gone...

414
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,140
forever.

415
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:44,600
It must've been tough for you too.

416
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,180
But...

417
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:05,390
it gets better...

418
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:07,680
over time.

419
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:10,980
It may be a slow process,

420
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:12,990
but it will...

421
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:15,190
get better.

[Episode 10]

423
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:33,700
Should we tell her?

424
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:35,540
At this point?

425
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:40,140
I'm not sure if it's a good idea
to keep hiding this.

426
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:43,860
- If she finds out...
- What if she remembers?

427
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:46,860
Wouldn't that be worse?

428
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:51,660
We should hope that she doesn't.

[Ms. Lee Kang Hee]

430
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,480
Hello?

431
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:09,020
Right now?

432
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:11,620
Oh, yes.

433
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:15,380
I have to go out.

434
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:16,720
Who is it this time?

435
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:20,850
I saw new shirts and suits
all over your room.

436
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:22,800
There's still a woman
who would buy those for you?

437
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,060
It's not like that.

438
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:31,370
Enough is enough, Won Jae.

439
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:33,600
I said, it's not like that.

440

What are you doing?

441
00:30:58,070 --> 00:31:00,320
Is this all yours?

442
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:03,100
I can't really say
that it's completely ours,

443
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:06,630
we possess the most shares
for this company.

444
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:10,070
I can't believe I became a servant
for a family of a conglomerate.

445
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:11,740
You aren't a servant.

446
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:13,710
We're in a contractual relationship.

Let's go.

448

Let's make it more casual.

449
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:38,070
It looks so expensive.

450
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:42,830
Do you have business meetings
at this hour of the day?

451
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:44,480
It's like a power move.

452
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,070
They're going to put me down
with alcohol.

453

Put you down?

454
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:51,220
You use scary words.

455
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,070
See you later.

456
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:32,480
- Goodness.
- I'll see you next time.

457
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,530
Yes, let's do that.

458
00:32:33,530 --> 00:32:34,890
- Thank you.
- Sure.

459

- See you next time.
- All right.

460

- Are you okay?
- Yes.

461
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,480
Yes, I'm fine.

462
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:07,350
You aren't a heavy drinker, are you?

463
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:15,070
I'm sure you have other chauffeurs.
Why did you ask me to come?

464
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:17,660
Because they work for the company.

465
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:21,230
They have to make a report
to their bosses.

466
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:25,350
I don't want Grandma or Dad to know
that I do these things.

467
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:28,140
Why do you work that hard?

468
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:30,610
If I don't do it,
my dad will have to.

469
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:34,790
My dad loves to paint.

470
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:37,850
He used to do that from time to time
when I was younger.

471
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:39,690
I still remember...

472
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,090
how happy he was.

473
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:48,030
But after my uncle said
he won't take over the company,

474
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:51,200
my dad couldn't say
that he doesn't want to.

475
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,810
He's too nice.

476
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:56,110
So I have to cover for him
with the things I can do.

477
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:02,450
Ms. Lee, you're
more warm-hearted than you look.

You look awfully cold-hearted
on the outside.

479

Do you usually
compliment people that often?

480
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:08,780
You called me
pretty and warm-hearted.

481
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:10,690
People don't usually say that
to each other's faces.

482
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:13,060
I can say anything
to hit on a woman.

483

Are you still hitting on me?

484
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,650
If I do, will you fall for it?

485
00:34:16,650 --> 00:34:18,000
It depends on what you do.

486
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:20,739
- What?
- You too.

487
00:34:21,570 --> 00:34:25,010
You're more warm-hearted
than I thought.

488
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:32,400
We should keep the working hour
written on our contract.

489
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:35,139
Let me know if you get home
after midnight.

490
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:36,620
I'll pay for the extra time.

491
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,449
I'll drop you home.

492
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,620
It'll only take 10 minutes on foot.

493
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,690
I'm going to take a walk
and try to wake up.

494
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:45,260
I don't want my parents
to be worried.

00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,710
But fortunately,

499
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:14,760
an even wonderful and amazing person
has taken the position.

500
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,380
Let me introduce him to you.

501
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:18,580
It's Mr. Lee...

502
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:21,930
I mean,
it's Chief Director Lee Min Hyuk!

503
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:35,630
No way.

504
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:40,510
My name is Lee Min Hyuk.

505
00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:41,750
Applaud!

506
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:44,280
Congratulations, sir!

507
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:52,430
Everyone, get ready for class.

508
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:54,390
Congratulations, sir.

509
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:59,700
Sir, hold on.

510
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:07,610
Did you see that?

511
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:10,130
Everyone started
treating me differently.

512
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,320
Are you...

513
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,630
upset at me?

514
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,590
This wasn't what I meant...

515
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:36,300
when I said I wanted
to work with you for a long time.

516
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:38,260
Do you think...

517
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:41,830
Kang Woo is more suitable
for this position than I am?

518
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:46,400
Or do you want him
to keep his position...

519
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:48,920
because you've chosen your greed
over your students?

520
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:56,490
It is true that the position
makes the person.

521
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:59,650
You said others changed.

522
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:02,930
But in my eyes,
you're the one who's changed.

523
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:06,960
I must go to class now.

524
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:27,860
Are you in the middle of a war?
Why are you devouring your food?

525
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:32,690
My gosh.

526
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,090
Here.

527
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,800
What's wrong with you?

528
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:42,940
What do you mean?

529
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,110
One drop of water on your pants,

530
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:49,240
and you'd freak out
and take them off.

531
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,320
Seo Yeon will be here soon.

532
00:37:57,070 --> 00:38:01,080
He's not a human, but a dog.
What is he doing?

533
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,560
Hold on.

534
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,450
If Seo Yeon is getting off work,

535
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:07,720
then Mi Kyung must be as well.

536
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:13,700
[Kim Mi Kyung]

537
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:16,830
Don't call me! Don't!

538
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:25,650
I love it.

539
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:28,280
I got to hear your voice,
so I'm happy.

540
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:31,980
What a cutie.

541
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,170
Are you sick?

542
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:22,730
I'm sorry.

543
00:39:24,170 --> 00:39:27,270
I was too rude back there.

544
00:39:28,810 --> 00:39:33,180
Honestly speaking, you deserve
that position the most.

545
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:35,370
You were right.

546
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:40,950
I placed my greed over my students.

547
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:43,890
I'm sorry.

548
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:49,030
Maybe I need to apologize as well.

549
00:39:51,770 --> 00:39:54,170
I took this position
because of my greed.

550
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:59,670
I wanted Kang Woo to disappear
from your sight.

551
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,310
What?

552
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:09,180
You see,

553
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:11,520
I like you.

554
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:34,730
Kang Woo, I'm in front
of your house. Where are you?

555
00:40:34,730 --> 00:40:37,200
Me? I'm in front of yours.

556
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:40,450
What? Why are you there?

557
00:40:40,570 --> 00:40:42,110
Since when were you there?

558
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:48,060
Never mind. Stay put.

559
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:54,290
You're such an idiot.
You should've called first.

560
00:41:10,830 --> 00:41:12,470
I blurted it out without realizing.

561
00:41:13,450 --> 00:41:14,950
You see,

562
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:16,180
I like you.

563
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:19,080
I've been liking you a lot...

564
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,790
for a very long time.

565
00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:26,450
I...

566
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,620
I...

567
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:36,070
I like Kang Woo.

568
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:44,780
That's right.

569
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:49,340
I like him.

570
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:57,320
I blurted out that I like Kang Woo.

571
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,530
- What are you doing there?
- My gosh!

572
00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:12,000
Hey.

573
00:42:12,770 --> 00:42:13,830
What are you doing here?

574
00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:18,100
I was thinking
about picking you up...

575
00:42:18,450 --> 00:42:20,370
but thought it'd be embarrassing
to run into someone.

576
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,020
What about you?

577
00:42:24,650 --> 00:42:26,190
Why were you at my house?

578
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:40,170
I wanted to ask you out on a date.

579
00:42:42,990 --> 00:42:43,990
What?

580
00:42:44,810 --> 00:42:46,330
I thought about it.

581
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:50,370
How about we start off
by doing things that others do?

582
00:42:51,370 --> 00:42:54,610
It was so messy up until now.

583
00:42:55,550 --> 00:42:56,970
Let's go on a date.

584
00:42:59,550 --> 00:43:00,650
Let's go.

585
00:43:00,790 --> 00:43:02,250
What did you just say?

586
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:04,160
Let's hang out together.

587
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,660
No, you said something else.

588
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:07,750
No, that's what I said.

589
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:09,560
- That's not true.
- Just get inside.

590
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:13,460
Let's hang out!

591
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:18,670
[Seo Yeon, let's hang out!]

592
00:43:19,170 --> 00:43:21,440
- Isn't it pretty?
- It sure is.

593
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:24,700
I've never been
to such a place before.

594
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:25,910
Do you want to take a photo?

595
00:43:26,550 --> 00:43:28,150
1, 2, 3.

596
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:32,320
I'm excited! Spin it!

597
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:40,560
- I want that one.
- Which one?

598
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:41,930
- That one.
- That one?

599
00:43:41,930 --> 00:43:43,160
The one inside.

600
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,320
I think I can do it.

601
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,220
You can't do it.

602
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:50,800
Did you see that?

603
00:43:51,570 --> 00:43:52,670
Darn it!

604
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:58,340
What was that? You're good.

605
00:43:58,570 --> 00:43:59,570
Here.

606
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:01,100
Here.

607
00:44:03,070 --> 00:44:05,290
Isn't it good? You eat so well.

608
00:44:11,210 --> 00:44:13,080
- Should we go inside?
- Yes.

609
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:33,970
It looks similar...

610
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:37,680
to your wedding dress.

611
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:39,480
You remember that?

612
00:44:48,950 --> 00:44:50,060
Hey, Kang Woo.

613
00:44:58,070 --> 00:45:00,310
Hey, man. You look so nice.

614
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:01,700
Are you getting married?

615
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:03,640
My gosh.

616
00:45:03,870 --> 00:45:05,240
Oh, no.

617
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:08,110
The groom usually wears
something like this for a wedding.

618
00:45:08,210 --> 00:45:09,920
No, it's...

619
00:45:10,870 --> 00:45:14,520
I was wondering if
the baby groom is getting married.

620
00:45:15,350 --> 00:45:16,850
Looking sharp, man.

621
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:18,290
You look great.

622
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:23,990
This would go with that dress.

623
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:30,270
There's this wedding dress
that I dream of.

624
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:41,780
I'm done.

625
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:44,420
Really? Show me. Now. Now!

626
00:45:45,610 --> 00:45:46,610
You can't make fun of me.

627
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:48,750
No, never. I totally promise.

628
00:45:55,930 --> 00:45:59,620
Yes, this is it.
This is what I've been dreaming of.

629
00:45:59,620 --> 00:46:00,990
Thanks, Kang Woo.

630
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:03,070
You're a genius.

631
00:46:03,590 --> 00:46:05,500
Why are you so good at drawing?

632
00:46:05,830 --> 00:46:07,040
Thank you.

633
00:46:13,150 --> 00:46:14,870
I thought about this, and...

634
00:46:17,210 --> 00:46:18,390
This time, about what?

635
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:21,020
You thought about
a lot of things today.

636
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:23,610
Did something happen?

637
00:46:25,450 --> 00:46:29,100
I think I wanted
to say this to you 15 years ago,

638
00:46:31,870 --> 00:46:33,760
on the day
I asked for your address...

639
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,790
saying I have something to tell you.

640
00:46:35,790 --> 00:46:36,940
You remembered?

641
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:39,340
No, I tried to guess.

642
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,340
What is it?

643
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:46,950
That I like you too.

644
00:46:48,650 --> 00:46:49,650
What?

645
00:46:49,810 --> 00:46:51,380
Okay, here we go.

646
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:52,920
Look forward.

647
00:46:54,010 --> 00:46:56,780
In 1, 2, 3.

648
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:08,440
Honey!

649
00:47:09,030 --> 00:47:11,910
It looks like he went through
so much trouble lately.

650
00:47:11,910 --> 00:47:14,530
That mysophobic kid
left the dishes undone.

651
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:16,680
Who am I talking to?

652
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:18,850
Hey, honey. Where are you?

653
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:20,800
What are you doing there?

654
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:24,120
What? Nothing. Honey, we should go.

655
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:25,350
Why?

656
00:47:25,350 --> 00:47:27,450
Kang Woo isn't here.
There's no reason to stay.

657
00:47:27,450 --> 00:47:28,780
- Let's go.
- Goodness.

658
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:29,980
- Let's go.
- You're acting weird.

659
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:31,930
- I'm not. Let's go.
- It's weird.

660
00:47:31,930 --> 00:47:33,020
- Move.
- Honey!

661
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:35,550
Honey, honey! No! Babe!

662
00:47:35,550 --> 00:47:36,550
No...

663
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:39,900
What do I do now? What should I do?

664
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:41,700
What do I do? Darn it.

665
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:44,560
Gosh, honey. I hurt my shoulder.

666
00:47:45,140 --> 00:47:46,300
Honey, my shoulder!

667
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:48,230
Honey!

668
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:51,950
- Honey, my shoulder. I pulled it!
- Goodness, Kang Woo.

669
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:55,080
What in the world is he doing?

670
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:57,010
I think I fractured my shoulder.

671
00:47:57,010 --> 00:47:58,590
I have to go see a doctor.

672
00:47:58,590 --> 00:48:00,350
Let's go to the hospital.
Let's just go.

673
00:48:00,350 --> 00:48:01,980
Will you be quiet?

674
00:48:03,550 --> 00:48:05,930
- Goodness, my shoulder.
- What's all this?

675
00:48:05,930 --> 00:48:08,160
- Honey, look.
- Goodness!

676
00:48:08,550 --> 00:48:09,550
Honey.

677
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:11,930
It hurts so much...

678
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:21,580
She's...

679
00:48:21,580 --> 00:48:22,910
Min Hyuk!

680
00:48:22,910 --> 00:48:24,700
Who is she?

681
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:25,700
Right.

682
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:28,580
What?

683
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:32,950
Don't tell Kang Woo.

684
00:48:33,650 --> 00:48:34,650
Okay.

685
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:51,530
Are you done crying?

686
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,370
I'm not crying!

687
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:56,470
So why did you want to see a movie?

688
00:48:56,940 --> 00:48:59,770
Watching a movie is the essence
of dating. Don't you know?

689
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:01,650
Watching a movie is
the essence of dating?

690
00:49:01,810 --> 00:49:03,580
You always see that on TV.

691
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:05,780
When there's a scary scene
in the movie,

692
00:49:05,780 --> 00:49:08,780
the woman goes, "Goodness".
And she falls into the guy's arms.

693
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:10,810
Did you think that would work on me?

694
00:49:11,190 --> 00:49:14,250
Darn it. I knew it wouldn't.
That's why I chose a sad movie.

695
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:16,860
If you cry,
I was going to wipe your tears,

696
00:49:16,860 --> 00:49:18,020
hold you in my arms,

697
00:49:18,020 --> 00:49:20,100
and comfort you too.

698
00:49:20,930 --> 00:49:23,900
Yes, so did you think
that would work on me?

699
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:26,460
Are you sure it wasn't sad?

700
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:28,970
The dog ran miles
to look for its owner...

701
00:49:29,470 --> 00:49:31,950
while getting abused
and mistreated by humans.

702
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:36,450
It was sad. I was heartbroken.

703
00:49:38,420 --> 00:49:39,650
But still, I don't cry.

704
00:49:39,650 --> 00:49:40,810
I see.

705
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:44,590
You're tough.
You're such a tough woman.

706
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:48,090
I can't.

707
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:53,930
I can't cry...

708
00:49:54,790 --> 00:49:56,200
no matter what happens.

709
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:59,800
No matter how sad
a movie or a book is,

710
00:50:00,940 --> 00:50:02,180
it won't make me cry.

711
00:50:02,410 --> 00:50:04,300
I'm really sad right now.

712
00:50:04,970 --> 00:50:09,420
I just need to shed
one teardrop, please?

713
00:50:11,210 --> 00:50:12,240
But...

714
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:16,980
it gets better over time.

715
00:50:17,750 --> 00:50:19,250
It may be a slow process,

716
00:50:20,390 --> 00:50:21,450
but it will...

717
00:50:22,430 --> 00:50:23,830
get better.

718
00:50:31,730 --> 00:50:33,170
I never cried...

719
00:50:34,170 --> 00:50:35,700
ever since that day.

720
00:50:37,140 --> 00:50:39,800
Not even once for the last 15 years.

721
00:50:46,850 --> 00:50:48,590
I'm a really dry person...

722
00:50:48,590 --> 00:50:50,660
with a lot of faults here and there.

723
00:50:51,950 --> 00:50:53,520
Are you sure that's all right?

724
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:58,130
What do you mean?

725
00:50:59,870 --> 00:51:03,290
May I take what you just said
as how you want to...

726
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:06,060
start dating me?

727
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:11,000
Can you take someone like me?

728
00:51:13,450 --> 00:51:14,500
It took us...

729
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:17,850
15 years to get a new start.

730
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:21,450
Back then, it may have ended
with an awful misunderstanding.

731
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:23,890
So do you think I'll lose...

732
00:51:24,510 --> 00:51:26,020
my second chance?

733
00:51:28,130 --> 00:51:29,550
You're dead,

734
00:51:31,020 --> 00:51:32,020
Seo Yeon.

735
00:51:47,540 --> 00:51:50,710
So you became the chief director
of Shinhwa High School.

736
00:51:51,890 --> 00:51:52,890
Yes.

737
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:55,620
I see. That position
might be much better...

738
00:51:55,620 --> 00:51:57,450
for you than Kang Woo.

739
00:51:57,450 --> 00:52:00,930
But Kang Woo was
supposed to do that for a year.

740
00:52:00,930 --> 00:52:02,660
Why couldn't you wait a bit longer?

741
00:52:03,130 --> 00:52:05,790
Is that why you called me
at such a late hour?

742
00:52:19,410 --> 00:52:21,180
I found that at Kang Woo's house.

743
00:52:21,810 --> 00:52:24,920
Isn't she the woman who was with you
at the department store?

744
00:52:26,590 --> 00:52:27,590
She is.

745
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:31,050
I thought she was dating you.

746
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:34,330
Right.

747
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:37,860
Aren't you dating her?

748
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:44,460
No.

749
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:48,840
Then wait,

750
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:51,300
is Kang Woo...

751
00:52:55,270 --> 00:52:57,210
In times like these,
it's not all that bad...

752
00:52:58,040 --> 00:52:59,710
that I cannot lie.

753
00:53:02,190 --> 00:53:04,690
I can make an excuse and tell him
that I had no other choice.

754
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:10,200
You can ask me, Aunt.

755
00:53:11,250 --> 00:53:13,990
I will tell you.

756
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:21,840
What is her relationship...

757
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:24,730
with Kang Woo?

758
00:53:24,730 --> 00:53:26,350
He likes her.

759
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:29,380
He probably wants to marry her too.

760
00:53:35,310 --> 00:53:37,890
Okay. I see.

761
00:53:39,980 --> 00:53:42,400
Thank you for telling me.

762
00:53:57,580 --> 00:53:59,350
I like Kang Woo.

763
00:54:01,150 --> 00:54:04,770
That's right. I like him.

764
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:09,420
I thought so.

765
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:14,750
I can't give you my support,

766
00:54:16,430 --> 00:54:18,360
but I won't come between you two.

767
00:54:21,830 --> 00:54:23,030
Thank you.

768
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:25,610
And...

769
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:30,910
I'm sorry.

770
00:54:45,630 --> 00:54:48,930
Mr. Lee, you're a nice person.

771
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,670
I told you that I'm not nice.

772
00:55:15,210 --> 00:55:16,660
That I like you too.

773
00:55:23,790 --> 00:55:25,490
I'll look at Seo Yeon
as soon as I wake up.

774
00:55:44,010 --> 00:55:45,310
I have something to say.

775
00:55:45,450 --> 00:55:48,390
What's your address?
I'll go there right now.

776
00:55:58,760 --> 00:55:59,790
Mom!

777
00:56:28,250 --> 00:56:29,750
Help us.

778
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:32,930
Help us.

779
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:17,580
Do you want some?

780
00:57:24,970 --> 00:57:26,350
I was there.

781
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:34,360
I was there too. I was.

782
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:37,290
What?

783
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:40,400
I asked them to go.

784
00:57:42,370 --> 00:57:44,400
Hey, what's wrong?

785
00:57:48,530 --> 00:57:50,230
I told Mom and Dad...

786
00:57:51,530 --> 00:57:52,950
that I need to go out.

787
00:57:56,510 --> 00:57:57,620
Right now?

788
00:57:58,010 --> 00:58:00,950
Yes, Kang Woo
just sent me his address.

789
00:58:01,650 --> 00:58:05,160
Like you two said,
I'll go see him face-to-face...

790
00:58:06,020 --> 00:58:08,790
to say that I'm sorry
and that I didn't mean it.

791
00:58:09,550 --> 00:58:11,020
Then he might forgive me.

792
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:13,460
Can't you do it at school tomorrow?

793
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:15,700
Tomorrow is my school trip.

794
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:19,000
I have to apologize today
to hang out with him tomorrow.

795
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,530
Please? Please?

796
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:22,470
Come on, Mom.

797
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:25,000
Okay. I'll drive you.

798
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:26,350
Really?

799
00:58:26,540 --> 00:58:29,810
Goodness, you had a glass of beer.

800
00:58:29,810 --> 00:58:30,950
You can't drive.

801
00:58:31,270 --> 00:58:34,650
Oh, right. I'm sorry, Seo Yeon.

802
00:58:35,590 --> 00:58:36,920
Mom...

803
00:58:40,430 --> 00:58:42,450
Okay, fine. I'll go with you.

804
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:45,760
I'll come with you.

805
00:58:45,990 --> 00:58:47,260
Why?

806
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:50,460
I want to see who this guy is.

807
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:54,000
I need to see this guy
who's giving you so much trouble.

808
00:58:54,370 --> 00:58:55,370
Let's go.

809
00:58:56,910 --> 00:58:58,770
- Let me grab some clothes.
- Okay.

810
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:03,310
What about Seo Jun?

811
00:59:04,150 --> 00:59:07,390
He just fell asleep.
He should be fine for three hours.

812
00:59:07,390 --> 00:59:08,480
Let's hurry.

813
00:59:09,310 --> 00:59:11,120
- Won Jae.
- Let's go.

814
00:59:11,750 --> 00:59:14,780
Won Jae,
we're going out with Seo Yeon.

815
00:59:14,780 --> 00:59:15,990
Keep your eyes on Seo Jun.

816
00:59:15,990 --> 00:59:17,860
What? Okay.

817
00:59:29,030 --> 00:59:30,800
Seo Yeon, what are you doing?
Come on out.

818
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:31,840
Okay.

819
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:51,400
Seo Yeon.

820
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:56,400
Wake up.

821
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:58,670
Seo Yeon.

822
01:00:05,410 --> 01:00:06,500
Dad...

823
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:07,880
It's okay.

824
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:10,580
It's okay, Seo Yeon.

825
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:19,480
You never know...

826
01:00:20,430 --> 01:00:24,130
when a man should
protect the people whom he loves.

827
01:00:25,670 --> 01:00:26,930
So you should learn...

828
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:30,530
how to tie your shoelaces
so that they don't come undone.

829
01:01:01,790 --> 01:01:02,790
Oh, right.

830
01:01:04,230 --> 01:01:05,260
Seo Yeon.

831
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:09,300
So do you think I'll lose
my second chance?

832
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:15,180
I asked them to go.

833
01:01:16,850 --> 01:01:18,180
It's because of me.

834
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:25,160
They passed away because of me.

835
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:31,860
Because of me.

836
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:38,670
There was...

837
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:42,300
no second chance for us.

838
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:07,400
[Love With Flaws]

839
01:02:07,460 --> 01:02:08,960
I never knew anything.

840
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:10,170
I'll wait quietly.

841
01:02:10,170 --> 01:02:11,490
I'll hold myself back
even when I miss you.

842
01:02:11,490 --> 01:02:12,760
Did you get sick of me?

843
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:13,960
It looks like this is great timing.

844
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:15,970
Don't lay a finger on him.
If you keep doing that,

845
01:02:15,970 --> 01:02:17,580
it'll make me feel very awful.

846
01:02:17,580 --> 01:02:18,580
Did you just see Joo Hee?

847
01:02:18,580 --> 01:02:20,150
Look at yourself. What's with her?

848
01:02:20,150 --> 01:02:21,240
Let's call off the contract.

849
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:22,920
Have you seen someone like this?

850
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:24,810
What's going on with this family?

851
01:02:24,810 --> 01:02:25,810
What are you doing?

852
01:02:25,810 --> 01:02:27,090
Don't let your guard down.

853
01:02:27,090 --> 01:02:29,120
As soon as you make a mistake,

854
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:30,660
I won't miss my chance.
