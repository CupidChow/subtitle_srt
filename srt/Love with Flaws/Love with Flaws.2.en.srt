00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:26,750
hey, it's you

3
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:31,020
Yes, it was you.

4
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:42,780
Hey, are you okay?

5
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,450
What's with him?

6
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:34,050
No, I can't go here.

7
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:34,170
What are you doing here?

8
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:36,329
Why did you leave already?
I came over in a hurry.

9
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:45,670
Hey.

10
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,480
Yes.

11
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,680
Things happen.

12
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:57,360
Things do happen.

13
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:28,890
Let's go!

14
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:31,050
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

[Episode 2]

16
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:32,490
I know a place nearby!

17
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:35,170
- I can't go.
- Come on!

18
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:36,200
Let's go!

19
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,490
Let's go bar hopping.
You guys are coming, right?

20
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:39,670
We'll pass.

21
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:41,800
Send her home and join us.

22
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,329
How can I do that? Go without me.

23
00:03:44,329 --> 00:03:46,579
- Come on.
- Let's go.

24
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:49,980
She's causing a scene again.

25
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,380
Just go.

26
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:52,850
- Bye.
- Bye.

27
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:54,320
- Bye.
- Bye.

28
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,420
- Bye.
- Bye.

29
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:59,390
- Are they gone?
- Yes.

30
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:01,950
How much did you eat?
You're so heavy.

31
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:05,130
You could've just said no.
Why did you make me do this?

32
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:07,670
Hey, I should keep my dignity.

33
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:09,520
Don't you know that
they're completely mesmerized...

34
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,770
by this face and my occupation?

35
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,230
They need to know their place.

36
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:14,430
You're really irritating, you know?

37
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:15,900
Look who's talking.

38
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,380
Just like how you judge men
by their looks,

39
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:19,880
I judge men by their looks,
competence, and wealth.

40
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:21,200
You're going to drink more, right?

41
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,300
Let's go back to my place.

42
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,770
Are you crazy? I can't meet
your brothers like this.

43
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:25,880
Over my dead body.

44
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,740
Hey, my oldest brother
is a gold digger,

45
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:28,820
and the second oldest brother is...

46
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:30,980
Well, you know.

47
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:33,420
Even if I can't date them,
I do want to look pretty...

48
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:35,150
in front of handsome men.

49
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:36,730
We're going to my place.

50
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:39,150
Your house is so far away!

51
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:41,390
- Let's go!
- And they're not home yet!

52
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,140
Follow me!

53
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:46,200
It's so far away!

54
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:48,100
One more drink

55
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:50,200
One more drink

56
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:54,140
Have you been well?

57
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:55,580
Cheers.

58
00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:59,710
Hey, it's been a while.

59
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:02,140
It has been. Have you been well?

60
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:04,210
Of course.
Why haven't you been coming here?

61
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:05,280
Won Jae.

62
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,690
It's because of her.

63
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,330
Won Jae, about last time...

64
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:15,130
I didn't know how scary you were.

65
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:17,200
I heard you grabbed my sister
by the hair.

66
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:21,310
That's because you guys really
didn't look alike.

67
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,530
Do you have more to say?

68
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:28,600
I hate you.

69
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:33,580
I thought you tried really hard
to win her heart.

70
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:36,580
Hey, I need to get married
as well, you know?

71
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:38,620
I can't always be fooling around.

72
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:40,630
Have fun.

73
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,090
Did you call for a chauffeur?

74
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:49,940
Yes. My car's coming,
so could you wait a minute?

75
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:52,070
Okay, then. I'll have a smoke.

76
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:53,090
Sure.

77
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:10,260
What are you doing?

78
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:19,890
Here. Park it.

79
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,750
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

80
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:44,950
Hey.

81
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,890
Show some manners when you pay.

82
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:50,630
Don't you know your actions
speak louder than words?

83
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,750
Who is she?

84
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:15,490
Hashtag, a glass of beer
late at night.

85
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:17,350
Hashtag, anyone wants to drink
with me?

86
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:19,020
Hashtag, feeling sentimental.

87
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:21,650
Let's drink now.

88
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:28,070
This is refreshing.

89
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:31,140
Didn't your mom come last week?

90
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:32,200
Yes, why?

91
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,440
Didn't she clean your room?

92
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:37,600
So?

93
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:40,200
It's only been a few days,
but your room is...

94
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,750
Is what?

95
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,250
Forget it. Let's just drink.

96
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,120
Were you really
Kang Woo's first love?

97
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:52,390
I'm not sure about being
his first love,

98
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:53,830
but he said he liked me.

99
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:55,330
Really? And?

100
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:57,260
I don't remember.

101
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:59,930
Come to think of it,
he never returned to the restaurant.

102
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:01,590
I think you're right.

103
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:02,790
What a strange guy.

104
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:06,070
Look at you. Weren't you sitting
next to him the entire time?

105
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,900
At first, I was infatuated
with his looks.

106
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,830
But I think that's all that he has.

107
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:13,970
Hey, isn't it obvious?

108
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:17,080
His face is screaming,
"I am a fraudster."

109
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,280
Right. Once Anus, always Anus.

110
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,540
By the way, why is that
his nickname?

111
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:24,650
Don't you remember our field trip?

112
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,330
I couldn't go.

113
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,560
Oh, right.

114
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,789
Cheers.

115
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:43,530
So why did you call him Anus?

116
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:45,080
Because that obese kid
pooped himself.

117
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:46,900
What?

118
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:14,900
Coming.

119
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:20,400
Who is it?

120
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:31,910
It's so late at night.

121
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,520
You should've scheduled
an appointment first.

122
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:36,280
Why is he so strong?

123
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,790
My foot, my foot!

124
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:54,270
That woman was the cause
of all this!

125
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,520
I don't like you.

126
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,760
I don't like you...

127
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:09,050
because you're ugly...

128
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,100
and fat.

129
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:21,010
I don't like you...

130
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:23,010
because you're ugly...

131
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:25,170
and fat.

132
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:30,520
Son, have some snacks.

133
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:33,940
It's cake, your favorite.

134
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:36,350
No, thanks. I don't want it.

135
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:38,390
- Why not?
- I don't want it.

136
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:40,130
- What's wrong?
- I don't want it.

137
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:41,680
Why are you refusing to eat?

138
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,020
- I don't want it.
- Oh, dear.

139
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:46,520
For about four days,

140
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,970
I ate nothing.

141
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,500
Not even a drop of water.

142
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:00,510
Really?

143
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:06,940
- Let's go.
- Okay.

144
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,390
What's even more shocking was that
after looking down on me like that,

145
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,780
she suddenly contacted me
late at night.

146
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:30,800
I have something to say.
What's your address?

147
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:32,530
I'll go there right now.

148
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:34,640
What did she say?

149
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:37,480
She didn't come. My gosh.

150
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:39,410
She toyed with me.

151
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:44,090
Feeling humiliated and enraged,

152
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:46,680
I could no longer hold it in.

153
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:51,050
I wasn't myself.

154
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:55,060
I even forgot that I was going
on a field trip the day after.

155
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:57,740
- Have some of this.
- I have snacks.

156
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:01,140
The restrooms at the rest area
were all full that day.

157
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:05,640
So I tried my best to hold it in
until we arrived at our lodging.

158
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,800
I'm telling you. It's true.

159
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,350
What is this smell?

160
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:13,810
My gosh!

161
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:15,910
Kang Woo pooped!

162
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:19,760
- What?
- Seriously?

163
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:22,780
- No way!
- That's disgusting!

164
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,320
I'm going to sit elsewhere.

165
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,610
So this woman is...

166
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:43,510
Joo Seo Yeon!
Had it not been for her,

167
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:45,810
I wouldn't have gone on a diet
or get humiliated like that!

168
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:46,990
All right.

169
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,260
Okay, calm down.

170
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:54,650
Sit.

171
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,140
Because of that incident,

172
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:09,430
you're suffering
from irritable bowel syndrome.

173
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:14,010
In addition, you have a hard time
forging relationships with women.

174
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,750
- What?
- Is that not true?

175
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,880
When I summed up
what you just told me,

176
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,440
since that day,

177
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:23,220
you never had a special feeling
for another woman.

178
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:24,550
You were never...

179
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,410
able to date a woman, right?

180
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:31,020
It wasn't that I wasn't able to.
I chose not to date them.

181
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:33,260
Why is that?
You're handsome and attractive.

182
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:34,500
That's why...

183
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,730
I'm waiting for the perfect
woman who deserves me.

184
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,610
To Lee Kang Woo
at the age of 15,

185
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:48,540
this woman was the perfect woman.

186
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,070
And he was rejected.

187
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:52,810
You are still
the same 15-year-old boy.

188
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,810
You still have the fear
of getting rejected.

189
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,960
You're chained to that fear.

190
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,410
Do you understand that?

191
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,730
You're sick of suffering
from diarrhea.

192
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,650
You will get better
once you make peace with this woman.

193
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:24,070
My goodness,
you have sensitive skin.

194
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:26,570
Why do you apply so much cosmetics?

195
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:30,910
You're pretty even without makeup.

196
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:32,990
- Hey.
- You startled me.

197
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:35,020
If both of us aren't married
until we're 40,

198
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:37,290
we should live together, okay?

199
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:44,560
All right. This is our ring.

200
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,140
Okay?

201
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,380
Okay. Just go to sleep.

202
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:09,280
Are you out of your mind?
Did you drive after you drank?

203
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:10,760
No.

204
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,860
How...

205
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,230
How could you be so reckless?

206
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:16,060
Do you know what you have done?

207
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,840
Hey. I called the chauffeur service.

208
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:20,660
And I fell asleep in the car
for a second. I just got up.

209
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:25,210
Hey, you weren't the only one
who suffered the loss.

210
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:26,740
I suffered too just like you did.

211
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,570
I get that I can be a jerk and all,

212
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:31,850
but how could I?

213
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:35,090
Really?

214
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:36,620
Did people always lie to you?

215
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,810
Did you drink?

216
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:42,630
Yes. I drank a lot.

217
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:44,360
But I sobered up quickly
thanks to you.

218
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:49,600
Our youngest must be alone.

219
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,010
Why are you guys so late?

220
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:01,570
I was scared to death
all alone at home.

221
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:03,300
Come on, you know how I get!

222
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,810
Hey. Looking at you is scarier
than being alone at home.

223
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:10,390
- Darn it.
- Stop wasting electricity.

224
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,090
Money isn't important right now.

225
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:13,310
I was scared at home.

226
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:14,550
Of course, money is important.

227
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:17,260
I'm going to sleep.

228
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,600
Come on.

229
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,770
I called you, but you didn't answer.

230
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:23,190
When you don't answer my call,
you know that I go crazy.

231
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,370
Did you call me?

232
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:27,510
I'm sorry. I didn't hear it ring.

233
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:29,110
Goodness.

234
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:38,810
Did you hear anything else
about Joo Hee?

235
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:39,940
I don't know.

236
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:43,860
Gosh. She's been absent
too many times.

237
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:47,920
Stop playing. Go to sleep.

238
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,730
I mean,

239
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,100
I was so sleepy earlier,

240
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:55,520
but I couldn't sleep...

241
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,270
because no one was here,
and now, I can't sleep.

242
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:07,670
- Right. It's about Park Seok Min.
- Who?

243
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:09,670
The guy with the expensive cake.

244
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:11,540
Oh, the guy with the cake?

245
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:12,849
What about him?

246
00:17:14,619 --> 00:17:17,280
I heard Won Seok
talking on the phone.

247
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,960
I guess he's a regular
at Won Seok's bar.

248
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:21,050
- Really?
- Yes, isn't that crazy?

249
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:24,650
You. Don't you dare
tell people about this.

250
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:26,000
What do you take me for?

251
00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:30,970
My gosh, only handsome guys
drink at Won Seok's bar.

252
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:32,860
Hey, that's discriminating,
isn't it?

253
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,740
Racial discrimination
isn't the only serious problem.

254
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:37,440
- Seo Yeon.
- What?

255
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,740
You stink.

256
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:40,030
There it is.

257
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:42,210
- Darn it. Stop it. Come on.
- There it is.

258
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:44,870
Gosh, stop it. Take them away.

259
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,840
What do you want?

260
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:22,340
Well... Can I get some beer?

261
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:30,380
Are you here for a scoop?

262
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,020
Pardon?

263
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,470
Or do you have a spycam somewhere?

264
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,770
- Or is this for an online channel?
- I don't follow.

265
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:38,940
You know about this bar.

266
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,800
You know this is a gay bar,
don't you?

267
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,360
Yes, I do.

268
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:45,130
I just came here to have fun.

269
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:48,510
I'm saying this
because you could be my brother.

270
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:50,100
This bar doesn't suit you.

271
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,720
You'd know once you looked around.

272
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,820
This is on the house.
Drink it and leave.

273
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:05,790
No, no.

274
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,860
So tell me what happened next.

275
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:12,130
I just kept drinking beer.

276
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:13,360
I heard that's a good beer.

277
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,970
I only drink that.

278
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,700
You're sick of suffering
from diarrhea.

279
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:47,470
You will get better
once you make peace with this woman.

280
00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:00,040
You will get better
once you make peace with this woman.

281
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,760
You will get better
once you make peace with this woman.

282
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:17,170
Darn it. Gosh.

283
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:28,300
You will get better
once you make peace...

284
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:32,870
Fine! You said you didn't like me
because I was fat and ugly!

285
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:36,950
Joo Seo Yeon, it's my turn.

286
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:38,760
You wait for me!

287
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:44,400
Joo Seo Yeon!

288
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:03,950
Goodness.
Funny running into you here.

289
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:08,080
You still haven't found Lee Joo Hee?

290
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:11,020
- No.
- I asked...

291
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,260
the owner of the wine bar
just in case.

292
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:15,120
She really quit.

293
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:19,160
Thank you for making the effort.

294
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,200
Wait.

295
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:24,290
Do you want it?

296
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:27,830
It's really good.

297
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:32,830
If you're doing this
because of the flowerpot incident...

298
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:33,980
No.

299
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:36,600
It's good. So I thought
sharing it would be nice.

300
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:38,180
With me?

301
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:40,220
Yes.

302
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,660
What was that? What?

303
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:56,500
Why is he being nice
only after being mean to me?

304
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,500
Is he mocking me?

305
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:00,970
Hey, you should eat this.

306
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:02,100
Okay.

307
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,980
That's how she's
interpreting his interest?

308
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:10,450
I told you to choose
a department to work in.

309
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:11,720
You haven't given me your answer.

310
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:14,070
I don't know.

311
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:15,720
I knew you'd say that.

312
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,080
Here.

313
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,850
These are the places you can join
with your qualifications.

314
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,380
Just choose one.

315
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,970
"Eeny, meeny, miny, moe."

316
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:29,970
You brat.

317
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,670
There are other people
more qualified than I am.

318
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:34,170
And you have your sister,
your right-hand woman.

319
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:36,530
Do I only need my right hand?

320
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:39,240
I must have all of my limbs
and my organs.

321
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:42,040
Grandma, there's something else
I want to do with my life.

322
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:44,070
Can't you just let me do that?

323
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:46,340
You can't be good at things...

324
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:48,610
just because you want to be.

325
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,580
I've seen countless people
who ruined...

326
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:52,660
their lives because they did
only what they wanted to do.

327
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:55,520
Whether I ruin my life
or become successful,

328
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,780
I'll face the consequence.

329
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:58,460
You little...

330
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,160
Mother.

331
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:02,290
He's more stubborn
than we anticipated.

332
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:04,000
Let's go with the plan B.

333
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:08,240
Excuse me. I can hear you just fine.

334
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,010
What do you mean, plan B?

335
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:13,740
Take charge of
one of these places...

336
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:15,910
and keep it going for a year.

337
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:18,750
After you do that,
I won't meddle with your life.

338
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:21,310
- Grandma!
- Can't you invest a year...

339
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:22,720
for your freedom of lifetime?

340
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:25,850
Or are you not confident enough?

341
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:37,000
You promised. It's for a year.

342
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:38,790
- Yes.
- Goodness.

343
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:42,860
I'm leaving.

344
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:46,010
Okay, my son. Goodbye.

345
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,480
Mother!

346
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:54,020
- Goodness.
- Yes, we gained a year.

347
00:23:54,690 --> 00:23:57,310
We'll get him married in that year
and make him stay.

348
00:23:57,310 --> 00:24:01,350
Of course. I'll find
the best wife materials.

349
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:02,350
Good.

350
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:04,930
This month's evaluation is
really important. You know, right?

351
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:07,430
- Really?
- Mr. Park is coming in this month.

352
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:10,500
Really? I've never seen him.

353
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,000
Not a lot of trainees have seen him.

354
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:15,010
I heard he'll decide on members
who will debut after the evaluation.

355
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,980
Why are you worried?
You're such a good singer.

356
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:19,480
Of course, you'll be
the main vocalist.

357
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:21,980
You can't survive in this industry
just because you can sing.

358
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:27,950
I wish I had
a quarter of your looks.

359
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:31,310
Come on. It's all about
makeups and plastic surgery now.

360
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:33,550
Don't worry. Don't worry at all.

361
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:35,850
Right. Other than lookism

362
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:38,760
I'm a better dancer
and a singer than you.

363
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:41,900
Gosh. How can you
diss me like that to my face?

364
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:43,200
I'm joking.

365
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:45,940
Hey.

366
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,240
- Do you want to go in first?
- Why?

367
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,570
- I have to meet someone.
- Who?

368
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:55,210
Well, this is personal.

369
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:58,610
- Sure.
- Bye.

370
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:10,930
Aren't you Joo Hee?

371
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,850
I'm Seo Jun.
We're in the same class.

372
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:15,020
I know.
Everyone knows you at our school.

373
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:16,730
I guess I'm quite famous.

374
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:18,030
You like to show yourself off
so much.

375
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:22,560
Do you know that
my sister is Ms. Joo?

376
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,970
She's looking for you.
Give her a call.

377
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:26,070
- Mind your business.
- She said you need attendance.

378
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:28,250
I said, mind your business.

379
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,080
I'm not doing this
because I'm worried about you.

380
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,990
Darn it.

381
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:42,660
[Seo Yeon]

382
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:56,330
Did you order chicken?

383
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:57,330
Hey.

384
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:03,210
It's a woman.

385
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:06,420
There's no gender
when it comes to delivering.

386
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:10,110
- Do you want some too?
- What?

387
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,610
It's too boring for me to eat alone.

388
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:17,580
You ordered all this for yourself?

389
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:19,000
They all have different tastes.

390
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,590
I wanted a bite of each flavor.

391
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,520
Have some before you go.

392
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,860
It's all right.
That'll be 73 dollars.

393
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,330
It's good, though.

394
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,960
- That's my tip.
- What?

395
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,660
I don't like keeping change.

396
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:53,460
Hey!

397
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:57,590
- You little brat.
- How did you know?

398
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:59,790
I asked the store
where you went to deliver.

399
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:00,970
- Follow me.
- Wait.

400
00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:02,470
I don't want to.

401
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:07,270
Unbelievable. Did you just push me?

402
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:09,070
Because you forced me to come.

403
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:14,520
You're a big girl now.
You grew up while you were away.

404
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:33,130
No, my neck. My neck.

405
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:35,860
- Ms. Joo, it really hurts.
- You little brat.

406
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:37,740
Don't you know
how scary this world is?

407
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:39,830
That hurts! It hurts!

408
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,680
Ms. Joo!

409
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:49,580
Is that your teacher?

410
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,160
I thought she was a thief.

411
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:57,280
Is she dead?

412
00:27:58,230 --> 00:27:59,590
She's breathing.

413
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,560
Then should we take her to a doctor?

414
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:04,120
I don't think
she could get badly hurt from that.

415
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:09,360
Ms. Joo, are you okay?

416
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:11,010
Why am I here?

417
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:12,100
I thought...

418
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,650
a bad person was
picking on the delivery woman.

419
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:17,750
Sorry.

420
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:24,360
I can't find a place
that pays me more than them.

421
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,560
You can't make me quit
against my will!

422
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:29,100
Doesn't that wine bar pay you
more than this place?

423
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,470
I can't believe this.
A student working at a bar?

424
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:33,560
That place isn't like that.

425
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,870
How dare you talk back to me
after what you did?

426
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,790
Aren't you going to run?

427
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:39,410
Don't you want to go to college?

428
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:41,630
Can I make a living...

429
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:43,570
by running?

430
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:44,680
Look at me.

431
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,310
I became a teacher
and am making a living...

432
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:48,200
because I ran that hard.

433
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:50,320
And I got fame too.

434
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,410
It's not a big deal to win
a silver medal in the national meet.

435
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:55,790
Hey, it's not that easy.

436
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:58,220
And to be frank, do you have
anything else you can do...

437
00:28:58,490 --> 00:29:00,050
other than running?

438
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:02,100
Do you have a clear goal?

439
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:08,470
So keep running for now
because that's what you do best.

440
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:09,860
You like to run too.

441
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:12,300
You can't live your life
only doing what you like.

442
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:14,400
We all have our stories.

443
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:17,870
What happened to your family?
What about your older sister?

444
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,710
She went head over heels
for this guy...

445
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:20,710
and ran off with all our money.

446
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:23,180
Why didn't you tell me?

447
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:24,420
Because it's humiliating.

448
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:27,190
That doesn't humiliate you.

449
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:28,610
Where did you stay?

450
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:29,820
Where is your stuff?

451
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:31,160
At a sauna.

452
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:33,220
Let's go.

453
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:35,600
My gosh.

454
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,630
Both you and Seo Jun
never listen to me.

455
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:40,190
Are you two going through
puberty all over again?

456
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:41,520
Fine, I'll go.

457
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,990
Have you been eating all right?

458
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:58,180
Here. We don't use this room,
so feel free to use it.

459
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:01,910
It's like a room from
"Anne of Green Gables".

460
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:06,020
I said the same thing
when I was a kid.

461
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:08,290
You lived here
since when you were a kid?

462
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:10,690
Yes, since when I was 11.

463
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:11,830
Your entire family?

464
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:15,020
Then do your parents live with you?

465
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:19,440
They passed away
when I was in middle school.

466
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:25,740
Is that why
you're concerned about me?

467
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:27,410
Because I remind me of you?

468
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:30,840
No, it's because
you're a good athlete.

469
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,680
If you weren't good at running,

470
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:35,050
I wouldn't have cared about you,
not even this much.

471
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:36,650
Why would I like you?

472
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:39,830
You can reorganize the room
as you'd like.

473
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:42,120
I'll tell Seo Jun that
you and I will use the bathroom...

474
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,430
on the second floor.

475
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:46,730
Seo Jun won't like
how I'll get to stay here.

476
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:49,530
If he doesn't like it, he can leave.

477
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:52,960
Right, I have two more brothers
other than him.

478
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,400
But they rarely come upstairs,
so don't mind them.

479
00:30:56,330 --> 00:30:58,480
You must be tired. Get some rest.

480
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,480
Ms. Joo.

481
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:03,480
Thank you.

482
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:09,210
I don't think you get it yet.

483
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:11,210
If you live under my roof,

484
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:13,860
that means you should
always be ready to be trained.

485
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,090
You're under my control.

486
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:17,090
Okay?

487
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,110
That's why I'm even more thankful.

488
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:33,370
One of my students will stay
in the attic on the second floor.

489
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:35,210
So keep that in your mind,

490
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:38,050
and who wants to eat dinner at home?

491
00:31:38,050 --> 00:31:39,810
[One of my students will stay
in the attic on the second floor.]

492
00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:41,610
[So keep that in your mind, and
who wants to eat dinner at home?]

493
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:45,460
[Message from Seo Yeon]

494
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,620
[Message from Seo Yeon]

495
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:00,510
[You received a new message.]

496
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:01,900
[One of my students will stay
in the attic on the second floor.]

497
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,330
[So keep that in your mind, and
who wants to eat dinner at home?]

498
00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:05,740
Is it that hard to reply?

499
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:08,480
They've never replied back
to any of my texts.

500
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,020
Darn them.

501
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:17,260
Joo Seo Yeon? Who was she again?

502
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:20,990
How could you not remember her?

503
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:22,520
I rarely attended
those alumni meetings.

504
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,830
You don't remember her
from middle school?

505
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,090
Was she pretty?

506
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,590
That's strange. I remember
all the pretty ones.

507
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:33,770
Here.

508
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:36,510
You even drew her?

509
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:43,970
No wonder I couldn't remember her.

510
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:46,520
She's Kim Mi Kyung's friend.

511
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:48,020
- "Kim Mi Kyung"?
- Yes.

512
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:50,210
I've met her once.

513
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:51,620
She's the leeching type.

514
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:54,060
I'd like to meet her.

515
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,560
Do you like her?

516
00:32:58,220 --> 00:32:59,570
So this was your ideal type?

517
00:33:00,290 --> 00:33:01,370
What do you think?

518
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,530
No, right? Then why?

519
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:05,600
I have business with her.

520
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,640
Can you set us up right now?

521
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:09,230
Give me five.

522
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:19,340
Are you done?

523
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:21,620
He's the only guy among
our alumni who's decent!

524
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:23,620
I told you about him!
It's Park Hyun Soo!

525
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:24,820
I don't know him.

526
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:27,720
Anyway, he just called
and wants to meet right now.

527
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,900
- Good for you.
- You should come too.

528
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,830
- What?
- He told me to bring a friend.

529
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:34,130
Don't you know what that means?

530
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:36,090
It means there will be one more guy.

531
00:33:36,370 --> 00:33:38,090
I hate that even more.

532
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:39,940
Just keep me company.

533
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:41,710
Ask someone else.

534
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:44,100
I can't trust any other wenches.

535
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,400
Is this really necessary?

536
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,080
If you don't want to, then fine.

537
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:50,710
But I'm going to drink
everything he offers.

538
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:53,250
But as you know, three glasses
are my limit.

539
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:56,520
Even if he takes me somewhere,
I won't be able to say no.

540
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:59,390
And I'll call you tomorrow morning
in tears.

541
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:02,700
"Seo Yeon, last night, he and I..."

542
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:07,500
Where are you meeting again?

543
00:34:08,370 --> 00:34:10,000
I'll text you the address.

544
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,880
Are you sure this is it?

545
00:34:16,170 --> 00:34:18,510
I searched this place up online,
and it was quite pricey.

546
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:21,400
How do I look?
Do I look too dressed up?

547
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,449
I need to look natural.

548
00:34:22,449 --> 00:34:23,949
You're pretty.

549
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:26,340
One minute.

550
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:28,850
This will suit you.

551
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:31,480
I'm here as your bodyguard.

552
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,760
It'd be wonderful if you hit it off
with the other guy.

553
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,400
Come on.

554
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:38,219
- Good girl.
- My gosh.

555
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:41,870
Once you drink three glasses,
we're leaving.

556
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:42,940
Okay, okay.

557
00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:45,460
All right, I'm ready.

558
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:47,330
Cover it. Cover it.

559
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:54,949
Hey, it's been a long time.

560
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:56,840
You're Kim Mi Kyung,
and you're Joo Seo Yeon, right?

561
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:58,410
You know me?

562
00:34:58,410 --> 00:35:00,390
Of course. We went
to the same school.

563
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:01,520
Sit down.

564
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,480
Why didn't you call me
after we last met?

565
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,060
I was waiting for you.
Why didn't you call me?

566
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:11,920
You're a pro, aren't you?

567
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,070
You answered my question
with another question.

568
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:15,130
Am I?

569
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:17,870
I ordered what I like.
Is that all right?

570
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:18,870
Sure.

571
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:22,010
Thanks.

572
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:27,600
Why did you suddenly call me?

573
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,540
I just remembered that I didn't
show up for the alumni meeting.

574
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:32,280
It was a bummer that I couldn't
meet you that day,

575
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,450
so I decided to call.

576
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:36,620
Right, do you remember Kang Woo
the Anus?

577
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:38,620
- He was there.
- What?

578
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:41,130
That fat kid made
a huge transformation.

579
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:43,090
He became so good-looking.

580
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,060
Really?

581
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:46,900
What did the others say?

582
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:48,940
They were all shocked.

583
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:51,230
He looks like this one celebrity.

584
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:53,210
He's a fraudster, I'm telling you.

585
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:58,230
- A fraudster?
- He suddenly came and was gone.

586
00:35:58,230 --> 00:35:59,810
I don't think he even chipped in.

587
00:35:59,810 --> 00:36:01,380
I didn't know I had to.

588
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:04,840
Kang Woo? Why are you here?

589
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:07,540
He and I kept in touch.

590
00:36:09,850 --> 00:36:10,890
We meet again.

591
00:36:11,890 --> 00:36:13,690
Right.

592
00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:15,560
I'm sorry I left so abruptly
that night.

593
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:18,590
Don't be. It's not like
we promised to meet.

594
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:22,830
By the way, were you unwell?

595
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:28,230
Something urgent came up.

596
00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:32,380
But you took your time leaving.

597
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:34,900
- It was like you had to poop...
- Anyway,

598
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,470
what have you two been up to?

599
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:39,620
Try to guess.

600
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:43,960
With your looks... A stewardess?

601
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:46,280
Not bad. What about you guys?

602
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,980
This and that.

603
00:36:48,650 --> 00:36:50,420
Only bad boys have a lot of secrets.

604
00:36:52,870 --> 00:36:54,000
Cheers.

605
00:36:59,770 --> 00:37:01,740
Do you have something to say?

606
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:08,170
They seem to be having a good time.

607
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:10,440
Should we drink elsewhere?

608
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:14,040
You won't be able to say no.

609
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:18,220
I don't know. Is that necessary?

610
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,320
What?

611
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:24,260
What is it?

612
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:29,900
I'll be outside.

613
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:33,930
Let's go home together.

614
00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:36,570
Oh, do you want to? Sure.

615
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:40,400
I knew it.

616
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:47,780
What's with his gaze?

617
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:49,810
It's as if his eyes are glazed over.

618
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:53,180
How do I look?
Am I driving you crazy?

619
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:56,520
What kind of face is that?
His chin is as sharp as a knife.

620
00:37:56,790 --> 00:37:58,260
Is he a comb-pattern pottery?

621
00:37:58,420 --> 00:37:59,690
Why is it so sharp?

622
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:03,100
Am I driving you crazy?
Do you love me that much?

623
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,560
Why are his limbs so long?

624
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,160
And why is his head so small?

625
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,140
He's the worst.

626
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:12,400
I'm sure I'm all that
you're thinking about.

627
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:14,900
No matter what you do,
you won't be able to erase me.

628
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,480
You're done for.

629
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:35,740
What do you do?

630
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:38,600
I'm just doing stuff.

631
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,800
Are you seeing anyone?

632
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:43,980
Why do you ask?

633
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:47,270
I'm interested in you.

634
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:51,980
- What?
- That's why I asked Hyun Soo...

635
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:53,620
to hook us up.

636
00:38:54,850 --> 00:38:56,280
It wasn't because of Mi Kyung?

637
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,650
Like you said, you're my first love.

638
00:38:59,390 --> 00:39:02,400
But you rejected me back then.

639
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:03,950
That's because...

640
00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:06,820
Let me talk first.

641
00:39:13,610 --> 00:39:15,430
Thanks to your rejection,

642
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,770
I woke up and smelled the coffee.

643
00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:20,570
I was determined to become
the best man for you.

644
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:25,310
However, it took me 15 years.

645
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:27,810
What do you say?

646
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:32,050
Will you accept me this time?

647
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:34,680
Seo Yeon,

648
00:39:35,450 --> 00:39:36,650
will you go out with me?

649
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:41,630
Are you...

650
00:39:43,290 --> 00:39:44,840
unwell?

651
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:48,270
- What?
- Were you in the States...

652
00:39:48,270 --> 00:39:50,770
for the past 15 years,
receiving treatment?

653
00:39:50,770 --> 00:39:51,770
What?

654
00:39:52,650 --> 00:39:55,150
If not, what kind of lunatic...

655
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:57,540
asks a girl out
when he barely even knows her?

656
00:39:57,670 --> 00:39:58,980
"Lunatic"?

657
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:02,550
Hey, cut this nonsense and go poop!

658
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:06,150
"Poop"? Hey! Why would I poop?

659
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:08,090
What have you done to help me poop?

660
00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:10,260
What's it to you
whether I poop or not?

661
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:13,630
That has nothing to do with you!
I don't even want to poop right now!

662
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:24,980
My stomach...

663
00:40:27,350 --> 00:40:29,410
Darn it.

664
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:43,100
What? What is it?
What's wrong with you?

665
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:46,630
Don't you ever meet them
or pick up their calls again.

666
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:47,730
Why not?

667
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:49,840
Do you know what Kang Woo did?

668
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:52,400
- He asked me out.
- What?

669
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:55,060
What does he take me for
that he says something like that?

670
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,740
Did Hyun Soo not say anything?

671
00:40:57,430 --> 00:40:58,510
Not really.

672
00:40:58,510 --> 00:41:01,400
But he never told me
what he did for a living.

673
00:41:01,610 --> 00:41:03,350
He kept dodging the question.

674
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:04,880
So I didn't tell him either.

675
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:08,390
See? They're both weird.
They must have gone insane.

676
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,990
I didn't like the way they looked,

677
00:41:10,990 --> 00:41:12,520
and look what happened.

678
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:14,990
I was relieved to meet
some decent guys.

679
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:18,000
Forget it.
Let's have some rice soup.

680
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Deal.

681
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:27,060
Hey, what kind of guy asks
a woman out all of a sudden?

682
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:28,900
When it comes to women,
you're so straightforward.

683
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:31,840
What is it? What do I lack?

684
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:34,400
She should've been grateful
that I asked her out.

685
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,670
But what? "Go poop"?

686
00:41:38,350 --> 00:41:40,020
That is strange.

687
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:43,860
It's not easy for women
to say no to your face.

688
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:45,680
Worst-case scenario,

689
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:48,180
they'd say that
they'd think about it.

690
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:49,320
Seo Yeon.

691
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:52,190
I guess I'm still lacking
in your eyes.

692
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:54,770
But how? What else do I need?

693
00:41:54,770 --> 00:41:55,930
I'm perfect.

694
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:57,840
Look at my face and my body.

695
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:00,930
Right. It's that.

696
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:04,900
It's your wealth.

697
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:08,010
- What?
- Money.

698
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:11,880
Kim Mi Kyung told me that
you didn't drive to the reunion.

699
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:14,350
She asked why you didn't have a car
when you looked rich.

700
00:42:14,350 --> 00:42:17,590
Goodness.
I thought that was so absurd.

701
00:42:17,890 --> 00:42:20,320
You know that people judge
other's wealth based on cars.

702
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,180
You can't leave Korea for the time
being because of your Grandma.

703
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:23,900
Go and buy yourself a car tomorrow.

704
00:42:24,790 --> 00:42:25,790
A car?

705
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:29,470
Yes. Get a really nice car
and ask her out again.

706
00:42:29,470 --> 00:42:32,470
Show her that
you have money and good looks.

707
00:42:32,470 --> 00:42:35,010
Lie and tell her
that the only person who can...

708
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:36,610
fill your empty heart is her.

709
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:38,430
- Okay.
- Buy her a delicious meal.

710
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:39,510
And buy her nice things.

711
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:41,440
Make her go crazy for you.

712
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:42,720
After that...

713
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:43,880
After that?

714
00:42:44,570 --> 00:42:46,410
When she looks the happiest...

715
00:42:46,410 --> 00:42:50,410
and she's head over heels for you,
that's when...

716
00:42:52,550 --> 00:42:54,180
you should dump her.

717
00:42:55,590 --> 00:42:57,320
The game is over then.

718
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,690
Game over.

719
00:43:09,430 --> 00:43:10,610
I'm home.

720
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:15,480
What?

721
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:17,650
Darn it. No one is home again?

722
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:19,220
Darn it.

723
00:43:23,050 --> 00:43:24,950
I can't believe them.

724
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:28,590
Darn it. They know I hate this.

725
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:41,030
How could the house always
be empty until late night...

726
00:43:41,030 --> 00:43:42,640
when there's a minor living
in this house?

727
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,240
Darn it!

728
00:43:51,810 --> 00:43:54,490
This happened on the first day...

729
00:43:54,490 --> 00:43:56,990
of moving into a new studio.

730
00:43:58,620 --> 00:44:00,630
I was washing my hair
in the bathroom.

731
00:44:00,890 --> 00:44:03,130
And I looked at the mirror.

732
00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:06,920
And I saw a woman in the mirror.

733
00:44:08,290 --> 00:44:10,290
Her back was hunched,

734
00:44:10,790 --> 00:44:14,870
and she was staring at me
through the mirror...

735
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:17,770
as if I was having
sleep paralysis...

736
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:24,310
That's all made-up.

737
00:44:24,310 --> 00:44:26,520
It's all made-up. My goodness.

738
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,120
Go away.

739
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:30,910
Go away!

740
00:44:32,390 --> 00:44:33,730
I hate this.

741
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:52,140
Are you home, Seo Yeon?

742
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:57,440
Seo Yeon.

743
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:03,910
Won Jae? Is that you, Won Seok?

744
00:45:14,770 --> 00:45:15,870
Seo Yeon?

745
00:45:29,970 --> 00:45:30,970
Hey.

746
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:37,150
Are you all right?

747
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:44,490
Imagine if people at our school
found out we live in the same house.

748
00:45:44,490 --> 00:45:46,260
You know that idol stars
can lose their fame...

749
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:47,960
with just one scandal, right?

750
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:49,640
If you hate it that much,

751
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:51,260
I'll talk to Ms. Joo and leave.

752
00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:53,540
Sure. Yes. You should.

753
00:46:02,110 --> 00:46:04,670
I won't leave the room. So you don't
need to be uncomfortable.

754
00:46:09,710 --> 00:46:12,410
Why would I feel uncomfortable?

755
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:15,030
Gosh, this is annoying.

756
00:46:20,870 --> 00:46:22,800
That's new. He's sleeping alone.

757
00:46:23,730 --> 00:46:25,960
Did he feel safe
because Joo Hee is home?

758
00:46:40,010 --> 00:46:41,210
Seo Yeon!

759
00:46:41,510 --> 00:46:42,740
I've decided.

760
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:44,360
Joo Hee will stay here.

761
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:45,360
Won Jae.

762
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:47,420
I heard about her story.
She's having a hard time now.

763
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:48,790
You should yield this time.

764
00:46:49,030 --> 00:46:50,100
Won Seok.

765
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:51,650
Can I go back to my room and sleep?

766
00:46:51,650 --> 00:46:53,630
Come on, guys.

767
00:46:53,630 --> 00:46:56,230
- Let's go.
- Come on.

768
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:01,400
You all have to wire me money
for the living expense by lunchtime.

769
00:47:02,970 --> 00:47:06,650
Darn it. Seo Yeon!
What if people find out?

770
00:47:06,650 --> 00:47:08,670
There are other people living
in this house too.

771
00:47:08,670 --> 00:47:10,170
Stop making a big deal out of this.

772
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:13,480
Besides, you slept fine
without us yesterday.

773
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:15,240
Well...

774
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:16,390
You slept fine...

775
00:47:16,390 --> 00:47:18,290
because your subconscious knew
Joo Hee was home.

776
00:47:18,290 --> 00:47:20,980
See? She's already helpful.

777
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:22,420
Stop whining.

778
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:23,720
And get ready for school.

779
00:47:23,950 --> 00:47:25,100
Okay?

780
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:29,130
Darn it. Come on.

781
00:47:29,130 --> 00:47:32,370
Why are you doing this to me? Why?

782
00:47:38,780 --> 00:47:42,550
You.
I'll just think of you as a dog.

783
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:45,650
You're a dog who guards the house.
No more, no less.

784
00:47:47,150 --> 00:47:49,150
Don't pretend to know me at school.

785
00:47:49,150 --> 00:47:51,680
Don't you dare think
about taking photos and sell them.

786
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:52,790
Got that?

787
00:47:55,590 --> 00:47:57,330
Gosh. What a lunatic.

788
00:47:59,190 --> 00:48:00,460
I only see vegetables.

789
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:01,800
- I'll give you mine.
- Eat mine.

790
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:03,140
- I'm allergic to plums.
- Hey.

791
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:04,160
- It's all right.
- You are?

792
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:05,300
- Yes.
- I don't like plumps.

793
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:07,500
I'll give you mine.

794
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:10,470
- What's wrong?
- Water. Give him some water.

795
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:12,380
Let's eat somewhere else.

796
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:14,280
- Why?
- What's wrong?

797
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:16,080
- Are you all right?
- What's wrong?

798
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:17,580
I don't know.
Let's just eat somewhere else.

799
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:19,010
- What's the matter with him?
- Where are you going?

800
00:48:21,210 --> 00:48:22,950
He's the one making it obvious.

801
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:28,890
I told them to wire me the money.

802
00:48:29,150 --> 00:48:31,100
So they didn't listen to me.

803
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:32,830
Fine.

804
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:35,570
I'll go and get it myself.

805
00:49:06,570 --> 00:49:07,760
The view here is nice.

806
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:29,410
Do you need anything?

807
00:49:30,250 --> 00:49:31,320
This is confusing.

808
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:32,860
Pardon?

809
00:49:34,060 --> 00:49:35,530
I can't figure you out.

810
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:37,630
What do you mean?

811
00:49:37,630 --> 00:49:40,130
Why did you tell on Seo Yeon?

812
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:43,840
I saw her breaking the flowerpot.

813
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:47,160
That wasn't what I was asking.

814
00:49:51,430 --> 00:49:53,670
Mr. Lee. Do you...

815
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:57,470
like...

816
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:10,060
Never mind.

817
00:50:10,330 --> 00:50:12,750
Whatever it is,
you're more handsome up close...

818
00:50:12,750 --> 00:50:14,190
which is why
it's more disappointing.

819
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:15,530
Have a good day.

820
00:50:30,470 --> 00:50:33,290
So if you're going
to be close friends with them,

821
00:50:33,290 --> 00:50:35,290
don't tell them
which family you're from.

822
00:50:35,290 --> 00:50:37,560
I never tell them what I do.

823
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:39,180
Why not?

824
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:42,220
It's a hassle
when people find out what I do.

825
00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:43,600
Just give them vague answers.

826
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:50,100
Hey.

827
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:52,570
Isn't that Joo Seo Yeon?

828
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,230
Why did you wear your pajamas
to visit me at work?

829
00:51:00,550 --> 00:51:02,350
My gosh, is that her boyfriend?

830
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:03,880
He's really handsome.

831
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:06,440
- Why...
- Why do you think I'm here?

832
00:51:07,550 --> 00:51:09,120
Let's talk about this at home.

833
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:16,030
- More than me?
- What?

834
00:51:16,690 --> 00:51:18,630
Is he more handsome than me?

835
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:24,460
My gosh, no.

836
00:51:24,460 --> 00:51:26,160
He's a different kind of handsome.

837
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:29,040
I get why she didn't fall
for your looks.

838
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:31,200
It's because she has
a handsome boyfriend like him.

839
00:51:36,710 --> 00:51:39,210
Where are you going?
You're not going to buy a car?

840
00:51:39,620 --> 00:51:40,890
Will you walk?

841
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:42,910
[Easy Transfer, 500 dollars]

842
00:51:42,910 --> 00:51:43,910
You're persistent.

843
00:51:44,590 --> 00:51:47,390
It could've been better
had you wired me the money on time.

844
00:51:47,390 --> 00:51:49,720
You always make me come
all the way here for this.

845
00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:51,750
There. Happy now?

846
00:51:53,570 --> 00:51:55,530
Then I'll see you again next month.

847
00:52:02,570 --> 00:52:04,640
Is she really your sister?

848
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:06,000
Yes. Why?

849
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,440
You two look nothing alike.

850
00:52:08,850 --> 00:52:10,010
Is she really
your biological sister?

851
00:52:10,010 --> 00:52:12,620
Of course, we look alike!

852
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:14,010
We look exactly the same.

853
00:52:17,950 --> 00:52:19,620
How can she date someone like him?

854
00:52:20,530 --> 00:52:21,590
What's her secret?

855
00:52:22,290 --> 00:52:24,600
She must be amazingly charming
in a way that we don't know.

856
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:27,420
Charming? Seo Yeon? No way.

857
00:52:28,690 --> 00:52:30,660
I'm sure that man is
just playing with her.

858
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:32,140
Like what you're about to do?

859
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:33,260
Hey, that's...

860
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:36,370
- Yes?
- Mr. Park! It's Seok Min.

861
00:52:36,370 --> 00:52:37,640
What about him?

862
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:40,650
What?

863
00:52:42,110 --> 00:52:43,440
Darn it, that idiot.

864
00:52:44,050 --> 00:52:45,080
Okay.

865
00:52:46,590 --> 00:52:47,590
What is it?

866
00:52:47,980 --> 00:52:50,320
I told him
to be careful for a while.

867
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:52,250
Why couldn't he hold himself back?

868
00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:04,260
Stay here.
I have to see if someone's there.

869
00:53:06,070 --> 00:53:07,140
I...

870
00:53:13,110 --> 00:53:14,240
What's going on?

871
00:53:15,310 --> 00:53:17,170
Why do guys who look like that
walk in there?

872
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:40,140
See that?
Even guys look at me like this.

873
00:53:40,140 --> 00:53:42,200
Seo Yeon, how dare you
look down on me?

874
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:46,970
Goodness, where is Hyun Soo anyway?

875
00:53:54,290 --> 00:53:57,510
Hey, if you don't
send it to me right now,

876
00:53:57,510 --> 00:54:00,830
I will make a huge scene right here.

877
00:54:05,490 --> 00:54:06,760
I'll send it right now.

878
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:10,840
No way.

879
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:13,400
My gosh.
I told you to wait in the car.

880
00:54:15,870 --> 00:54:16,880
Hey.

881
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:19,670
What's wrong?

882
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:23,850
Do you need to poop again?

883
00:54:24,350 --> 00:54:25,410
Go.

884
00:54:31,750 --> 00:54:34,060
Did you poop? Did you poop again?

885
00:54:34,650 --> 00:54:35,680
No, right?

886
00:54:35,890 --> 00:54:37,750
Tell me that you didn't.

887
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:40,370
It's okay, man. It's okay.

888
00:54:40,370 --> 00:54:42,800
Let's go. Let's go home.

889
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:49,350
Hold it in. Please hold it in.

890
00:54:55,470 --> 00:54:56,830
What's with them?

891
00:54:58,430 --> 00:54:59,860
If they're in a relationship...

892
00:55:03,830 --> 00:55:04,870
Goodness.

893
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:20,560
How can Seo Yeon date men like them?

894
00:55:21,620 --> 00:55:22,620
But wait.

895
00:55:23,260 --> 00:55:25,560
If she can date them,
why can't she date me?

896
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:32,660
Why?

897
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:42,600
What? They were
at Won Seok's bar together?

898
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:45,410
And it looked like
they were in a deep relationship.

899
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:47,950
Then does this mean
they were playing with us?

900
00:55:47,950 --> 00:55:50,610
I told you that
you can't trust good looking guys.

901
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:52,610
If I ever see them again,

902
00:55:52,610 --> 00:55:54,620
I'll break both of them in half.

903
00:55:55,460 --> 00:55:56,460
Hey.

904
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:58,390
Why?

905
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:04,330
Excuse me.

906
00:56:09,570 --> 00:56:10,570
Hey.

907
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:12,400
It's you, the teacher.

908
00:56:12,740 --> 00:56:16,870
Do you not have a place to stay?

909
00:56:16,870 --> 00:56:17,950
What?

910
00:56:17,950 --> 00:56:20,840
If you can contact someone
by the phone, I can call them.

911
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:22,080
Or you can go to a shelter...

912
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:23,290
I'm fine.

913
00:56:26,790 --> 00:56:28,820
Are you sure?

914
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:31,090
You're so kind.

915
00:56:34,820 --> 00:56:35,890
Do you want this?

916
00:56:36,530 --> 00:56:38,470
What? No, it's okay.

917
00:56:38,470 --> 00:56:39,800
You can keep it.

918
00:56:42,010 --> 00:56:45,870
By any chance,
if you ever need any help...

919
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:50,870
Hey.

920
00:56:51,780 --> 00:56:54,050
What's with you? My gosh.

921
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:13,070
If you need any help,
give me a call.

922
00:57:23,170 --> 00:57:24,370
What's your name?

923
00:57:24,950 --> 00:57:25,950
Me?

924
00:57:26,950 --> 00:57:28,110
I'm Joo Seo Yeon.

00:57:28,490 --> 00:57:29,720
I'm Baek Jang Mi.

926
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:32,990
Okay, then.

927
00:57:40,860 --> 00:57:41,920
Who was that?

928
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:44,430
I think she's homeless.

929
00:57:44,540 --> 00:57:45,770
But she's so young.

930
00:57:46,430 --> 00:57:48,210
I'm sure she has a story.

931
00:57:49,070 --> 00:57:50,430
Did she say
her name is Baek Jang Mi?

932
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:53,980
That's a name for the worst
psychotic girls you see in dramas.

Joo Seo Yeon.

934
00:58:31,870 --> 00:58:33,520
I really don't like him.

935
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:35,910
How can he keep his shape
after eating like that?

936
00:58:36,820 --> 00:58:37,880
Hey.

937
00:58:39,650 --> 00:58:41,290
What brings you here?

938
00:58:41,290 --> 00:58:43,080
Me? Well.

939
00:58:44,820 --> 00:58:46,820
I wanted to see you,
and some other things.

940
00:58:48,730 --> 00:58:50,590
You had such a great career
in that huge hospital.

941
00:58:50,590 --> 00:58:53,270
Isn't it too suffocating
to sit in this tiny room?

942
00:58:53,570 --> 00:58:55,130
It's not as tiny as you think.

943
00:58:55,830 --> 00:58:57,400
Is it easy to work at a school?

944
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:00,070
You can come and go
at a certain time,

945
00:59:00,070 --> 00:59:02,170
and you get vacations.
It's not that bad.

946
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:06,050
So it's good, right?

947
00:59:06,050 --> 00:59:07,080
Why?

948
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:09,790
Is our school on the list too?

949
00:59:10,350 --> 00:59:13,620
Something like that.
But I hate kids.

950
00:59:13,620 --> 00:59:15,030
So I can't come...

951
00:59:20,860 --> 00:59:21,860
What is this?

952
00:59:22,770 --> 00:59:24,040
Why is she here?

953
00:59:46,220 --> 00:59:47,850
I found out that...

954
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:51,000
she is sitting in my palm.

955
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,860
I could just clench my fist lightly.

956
00:59:55,890 --> 00:59:57,970
I didn't know
I could overcome it this easily.

957
01:00:01,970 --> 01:00:03,070
What do you mean?

958
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:07,600
I want to get my revenge
instead of overcoming her.

959
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:13,750
Everyone, I need your attention.

960
01:00:13,790 --> 01:00:17,990
We finally have
a new chief director...

961
01:00:17,990 --> 01:00:19,720
whom we did not have until today.

962
01:00:20,460 --> 01:00:24,650
He's a very competent man
who studied at Stanford,

963
01:00:24,650 --> 01:00:26,420
a renowned university.

964
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:30,270
Please welcome him with a big hand.

965
01:00:30,270 --> 01:00:31,300
Chief Director?

966
01:00:49,490 --> 01:00:50,850
Nice to meet you.

967
01:00:51,910 --> 01:00:55,080
I'm Lee Kang Woo,
your chief director.

968
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:56,650
Please welcome him!

969
01:01:02,620 --> 01:01:03,930
Darn it.

970
01:01:19,750 --> 01:01:22,450
I'll kill you.

971
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:07,090
[Love With Flaws]

972
01:02:07,090 --> 01:02:08,360
I don't care
if he's the chief director!

973
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:09,620
I don't care if he's the successor!

974
01:02:09,620 --> 01:02:12,200
That means Anus will
determine your future.

975
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:13,270
We have a track team, don't we?

976
01:02:13,270 --> 01:02:15,360
If they don't show any performance,
we don't have to leave it.

977
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:17,240
You don't want people to know that
you're a part of the foundation?

978
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:19,830
- Ladies, do you want a ride?
- My gosh!

979

You idiot!

980
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:22,010
Who's that? Where's the agency?

981
01:02:22,010 --> 01:02:24,110
Shinhwa Food?
That's why she was arrogant.

982
01:02:24,110 --> 01:02:26,140
Don't get so clingy
over something that happened...

983
01:02:26,140 --> 01:02:28,080
- ages ago!
- Clingy?

984
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:29,950
You're still the same, Seo Yeon.

985
01:02:30,220 --> 01:02:31,620
You judge guys by their looks.

986
01:02:31,620 --> 01:02:32,620
What?
