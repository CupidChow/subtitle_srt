[Episode 3]

3
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:26,930
Chief Director?

4
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:37,840
Nice to meet you.

5
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:41,920
I'm Lee Kang Woo,
your chief director.

6
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,100
Darn it.

7
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:58,310
What are you looking at?

8
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:08,610
I'll kill you.

9
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:26,720
No!

10
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:29,090
Your stomach will growl more
before you get your revenge...

11
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:30,640
with an attitude like that.

12
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,640
Growl?

13
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,509
Do you want to live in anxiety,
worrying about...

14
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:34,900
when you will poop in your pants?

15
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,140
Poop in my pants?

16
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:39,150
No, I don't want to.

17
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:40,750
I can't hear you.

18
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:42,810
- No!
- Let's try again.

19
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,590
No matter what the situation is,

20
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:46,750
do not avoid her eyes.

21
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:49,090
Wait, but...

22
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:52,350
are you sure this treatment is...

23
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:54,289
used by NASA too?

24
00:01:54,289 --> 00:01:56,120
Do you not trust me?

25
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,620
It's not that I don't trust you.

26
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:11,750
Why? Is something wrong?

27
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:13,710
Role...

28
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,510
Role-playing is one of
the basic psychological treatment.

29
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,500
Okay.

30
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,400
Let's start again.

31
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:32,960
Do not be the first
to break eye contact with her.

32
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:56,750
Sir, where are you looking?

33
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:05,930
Sir?

34
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:09,660
Is there anything more
you'd like to say?

35
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:10,840
All right, then.

36
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:15,210
I think he's prepared something.

37
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,910
This is
a very effective antidiarrheal...

38
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:26,910
that was imported from Italy.

39
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:28,250
Take this during emergencies...

40
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:30,490
when you can't even move.

41
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:36,020
He must not be the quiet type.

42
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:38,880
That's what I think.

43
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:43,320
You all know that we're having
a welcome party after work, right?

44
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,170
I hope every single one of you
will be there.

45
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,190
- Okay.
- Okay.

46
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,370
Sir. Sir.

47
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:59,000
The role-playing didn't help.

48
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,140
That's impossible.

49
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:03,270
No, it was possible.

50
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,380
I see.

51
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:07,750
We should've invited the subject
or used a photo of her.

52
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,620
Perhaps, the drawing
was too weak of a treatment.

53
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:15,230
Take a photo of her
and train yourself with it.

54
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:17,120
Where could I get a photo of her?

55
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:20,830
I thought she was working there.

56
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:24,740
Are you telling me to take
a photo in secret?

57
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:29,540
If you're not up for it, how about
you take a photo of someone else...

58
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:31,180
with her in the background?

59
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,940
Are you sure NASA uses this method?

60
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:39,490
The noodles are all swollen.

61
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:07,640
Sir... Sir, I did knock
before coming in.

62
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,980
I see. What is it?

63
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:13,720
I was wondering if you'd like
to take a tour.

64
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,860
Right.

65
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,160
Give me 10.

66
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:20,430
No, give me 30.

67
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:23,250
Sure, we'll come back later.

68
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,820
- 30 minutes, it is.
- Let me take that pot.

69
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:29,890
Don't mind him. We'll be back
after 30 minutes.

70
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,930
30 minutes, it is.

71
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:35,430
Darn it.

72
00:06:37,409 --> 00:06:40,370
Why would he take my pot?

73
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:43,220
He ate a stone, didn't he?

74
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:44,850
Yes.

75
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:46,940
What kind of ridiculous situation
is this?

76
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:50,159
By the way, I wonder how
he's connected with Shinhwa Food.

77
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:51,620
I bet it's nothing.

78
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,180
He's probably just
an extremely distant...

79
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,690
and useless relative.

80
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,100
If he was directly related
to the chairwoman,

81
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,230
he would've gone
to the headquarters.

82
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:59,730
Why would he come
all the way here?

83
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:02,330
I'm sure he won't be here for long.

84
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,930
- He said 30 minutes, right?
- Yes.

85
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:07,130
Watch what I do.

86
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:08,540
That little...

87
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,110
Sir!

88
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:19,350
It's nice weather to play hooky!

89
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:22,880
- I told you to come sooner.
- I should've.

90
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:29,930
- Go.
- Let's go study.

91
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:30,970
It's the best weather...

92
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:32,120
- for studying.
- Let's go.

93
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:38,170
How could Anus be
the chief director?

94
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,560
Is it that easy
to obtain that position?

95
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:44,870
Do you think he has ties
with Shinhwa Food?

96
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,140
Whatever the case may be,
it's absurd...

97
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:49,140
that he's the chief director
of this sacred school.

98
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,420
We should disclose
what he did to us...

99
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:53,080
and make him resign.

100
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:56,250
Are you crazy? What if he does
have close ties?

101
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,790
In that case, we'll have to resign.

102
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:03,300
Gosh, I never took you
for this type.

103
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,370
There's no reason for us
to be frightened.

104
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:08,390
He's nothing.

105
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:09,740
Shut it. You're too noisy.

106
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,740
Okay.

107
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:15,040
- The number you called...
- Why isn't he picking up?

108
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,910
- Who?
- Park Hyun Soo.

109
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:21,250
If they're really dating,
he'll know...

110
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,070
about Kang Woo's past.

111
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:28,810
But he shouldn't know that
you know about them, okay?

112
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,930
What do you take me for?

113
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,059
The number you called...

114
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:36,559
My gosh!

115
00:08:43,929 --> 00:08:44,930
What's wrong?

116
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:47,500
I told him yesterday that
he had to leave by 9 a.m.

117
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,430
But he's not picking up
or opening the door.

118
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:52,770
That little...

119
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:55,350
This is why I should know
his passcode.

120
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:57,040
I know privacy is important,

121
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,820
but situations like this
are so nerve-racking.

122
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:01,720
I'll bring him out,

123
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:04,280
so tell them that he's going to be
slightly late.

124
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:07,830
What? Why aren't you telling me
the passcode?

125
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:23,080
Why?

126
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:34,280
Because of this.

127
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,380
Because of all this.

128
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:52,760
He bailed on a shooting
that's worth hundreds and thousands.

129
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:56,110
Yet look at him, posing right there.

130
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,640
You little punk!

131
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:12,230
- Who are you?
- What about you?

132
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,440
What? What is this?

133
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,250
Hey.

134
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:35,450
- Bye.
- Bye.

135
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:38,540
Hey, who is he?

136
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:41,220
Not many men look like him.
Which agency is he in?

137
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:47,620
He's not in an agency? No way.

138
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:51,200
Talk, you jerk!

139
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,160
You told me not to say anything!

140
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,840
Do that outside!

141
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,940
My gosh.

142
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,800
- Right, you have a shooting today.
- What do you mean?

143
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,340
Didn't you hear about
the 9 a.m. razor advertisement?

144
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:06,670
No! I'm dead meat.

145
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:11,040
My gosh! Gosh!

146
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,380
He'll be the death of me.

147
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,950
My gosh.

148
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:17,320
What's the relationship
between Kang Woo and Shinhwa Food?

149
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:18,880
What does she mean?

150
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,790
Gosh, she didn't eat any of this.
What a waste.

151
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:29,440
Ma'am.

152
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,400
You startled me.

153
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,840
Where's my mask?

154
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,530
That? I threw it away
because it was dirty.

155
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,040
What's wrong with her? Is she crazy?

156
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,640
- I feel bad for her.
- I'm so disgusted.

157
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:49,510
You must be very hungry.

158
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,020
Have this.

159
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:59,290
Oh, no. I left my bag inside.

160
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,390
I'll pay you next time. I promise.

161
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:10,480
I found it!

162
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:19,010
Yes, I'm telling you.

163
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:22,720
By the way, where's the principal?

164
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,860
I don't think we've met.

165
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:28,920
Our principal is like air.

166
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:33,120
We don't see the principal,
but the principal sure does exist.

167
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,030
The principal doesn't work
yet gets paid?

168
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,740
Is that it?

169
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,530
My gosh, no.
That's not what I meant.

170
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:42,610
We need the principal
just like we need air.

171
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:44,210
But the principal doesn't show up...

172
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:46,900
I mean, I didn't mean
that the principal doesn't work.

173
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:47,910
You may not feel
the principal's presence,

174
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:49,580
but the principal is with us.
What do we call that?

175
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:51,350
- Fine dust.
- The principal is like fine dust.

176
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,780
Forget it.
I'll look into that myself.

177
00:12:58,330 --> 00:12:59,880
I will start evaluating the faculty
and the staff...

178
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,390
- regardless of their positions.
- What?

179
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:04,660
My gosh. I don't think
you grasped the situation.

180
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,700
No one can touch the principal.

181
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:09,340
Well, I heard that our principal
is pretty tight...

182
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:12,070
with the chairwoman
of Shinhwa Food. My goodness.

183
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:14,840
It's only a rumor.
It's just a rumor.

184
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,270
He's talking about a rumor.

185
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:17,340
Come this way.

186
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,350
But...

187
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:19,670
Be quiet.

188
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,350
Is that so?

189
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:25,320
He got there on time,

190
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,690
and that's one less problem
we need to worry about.

191
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,150
My gosh, he has a lot of potentials,

192
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:32,230
but he can be rude.

193
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:34,500
My gosh, Mother.

194
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,230
Teach him well,

195
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:38,390
and make him a responsible worker.

196
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:39,660
Yes.

197
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:43,290
Is that the principal?

198
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:44,290
Yes.

199
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:48,670
Mother, what do you think
about this lady?

200
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:51,040
I love her eyes and lips.
They are beautiful.

201
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,270
Good looks won't help him.

202
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:55,040
Kang Woo needs...

203
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:57,250
a mature and diligent woman...

204
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,620
who can take care of herself.

205
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:06,750
Mother, why did you approve
of me to marry your son?

206
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,700
You had a lot of money.

207
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,600
Is it because of my money?

208
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:15,370
You're right. Having money
can be considered one's ability.

209
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:22,400
They are not as pretty as me
when I was young.

210
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,480
Please take a look at this.
The view here is great.

211
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,910
It's nice and open. Right.

212
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:31,380
We didn't use tiles to build
the wall. We used marble.

213
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:33,010
Well, as for the grass
on our stadium,

214
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:34,690
they gave me a really high quote,

215
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:36,510
- and I said no to that.
- Look at that.

216
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:38,920
Goodness, kids.

217
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,590
- I always clean it up.
- My gosh.

218
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:41,600
- Chief.
- Yes.

219
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,920
What is this?

220
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,020
Write down the class
and student number.

221
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,100
Okay.

222
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,620
- This isn't right.
- Work on your landing form.

223
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:48,030
You have a track team.

224
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,390
- There you go.
- Yes.

225
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:50,500
How's the team?

226
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,070
Well, the principal has
a lot of interest in the team.

227
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:55,610
But they haven't achieved
any accomplishments yet.

228
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:58,140
There's no point in keeping the team
without any achievements.

229
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:01,080
Running a school isn't charity work.

230
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:02,370
Right.

231
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:07,510
Take a photo of her
and train yourself with it.

232
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,280
This is a beautiful school.

233
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,090
- Right. This part...
- Stand over there.

234
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:14,790
- Pardon?
- Let me take a photo of you.

235
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:16,460
- Pardon?
- Be confident.

236
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:17,920
- Stand over there together.
- Go.

237
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,420
Sure.

238
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:20,700
That was so sudden.

239
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,600
- He told us to stand for a photo.
- Okay.

240
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,340
- Here we go.
- Focus.

241
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,710
In 1, 2, 3.

242
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:31,350
Good.

243
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:34,450
- Stand right here.
- I mean...

In 1, 2, 3.

In 1, 2, 3.

Right here.

In 1, 2, 3.

248
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:45,920
My goodness, this is fun.

249
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,750
- Right here.
- All right.

250

- In 1, 2, 3.
- Let's do a pose together.

251
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,340
Gosh, I think I blinked just now.

252
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:57,240
Let me see them.
Did you take nice photos?

253
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:06,900
I'll finish the tour here today.

254
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:13,280
Why did he take the photos
if he wasn't going to show us?

255
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:14,510
I know, right?

256
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:23,700
How dare you summon a chief director
to your office?

257
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Sit down.

258
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,070
My goodness. How rude.

259
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,340
Are you all right?

260
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:37,850
Why did you run out like that
in the middle of your introduction?

261
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:42,080
Well, I didn't have much
to say anyway.

262
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:49,750
Was there something you didn't like?

263
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:54,020
I'm talking about your mysophobia.

264
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:55,500
Are you getting treated for that?

265
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,070
How old were you when
you watched your first adult film?

266
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,420
When was it?

267
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,470
Where did you watch it?
And with whom?

268
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:06,339
In fourth grade with my friend
at my friend's house.

269
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,480
Fourth grade?

270
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,170
You punk. I didn't peg you
to be a dirty boy.

271
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:17,619
Don't worry about me.
Just worry about yourself.

272
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:19,880
How could you call yourself normal
if you can't even lie?

273
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:23,410
Is that why you called me in here?

274
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:26,880
People will find out that you're
the chairwoman's grandson.

275
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,050
- What's wrong with that?
- It might not matter to you,

276
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:30,250
but it does to me.

277
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:31,700
I hope people won't find out
about me.

278
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,970
You don't want people to find out
you're part of the foundation?

279
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,260
That's right. Please help me.

280
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:42,710
Well,

281
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,600
I don't need to tell
people about it.

282
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:49,610
But why this school?

283
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,650
You're not interested
in school business.

284
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:56,960
Did I steal your spot?

285
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:59,750
No, you didn't. I was just curious.

286
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,020
It made me wonder
why you chose here.

287
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:02,500
I won't stay here long.

288

[Expected Budget for Track Team]

289

She has this kind
of a run-of-the-mill job.

290
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:19,380
But what was that she told me?
"Go poop"?

291
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:21,720
I'll open my eyes wide...

292
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,420
and tell you that you're fired.

293
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:26,280
I will do that.

294
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:51,270
What was that?

295
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:54,720
Did she know
that I was taking a photo of her?

296
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:57,880
No way.

297

299

Hey, Lee Kang Woo...

300

What was that?

301
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,250
Darn it.

You know what I'm getting at, right?

305
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,550
So that jerk, Lee Kang Woo,

306
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:46,170
is the grandson
of Shinhwa Food's chairwoman?

307
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:47,560
Yes. He's the third-generation
of a conglomerate family...

308
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,760
we only heard of.

309
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,560
Darn it. Had I known sooner...

310
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:51,740
Then, what?

311
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:53,260
Were you going to be a sacrificial
lamb in the fake wedding?

312
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:54,530
Well, yes and no.

313
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:56,910
I think I might be able to
put up with that kind of risk...

314
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:58,500
if I were to be
a daughter-in-law of a rich family.

- Get a grip!
- You startled me.

I just "thought" about it.

317
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:03,040
Am I not even allowed
to think freely with my own brain?

318
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:07,690
Anyway, he deserves a nice beating
given how he played us.

But what can we do?

320
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,690
He's the chief director

What? What about that?

00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:14,390
Do you think
I'll just let him off the hook?

So we should stay away
from him if we can. Okay?

00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:57,490
Oh, right.

487
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:00,990
Seo Yeon, you're so superficial too.

488
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:04,220
The way you looked at me changed
because of some car?

489
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:07,500
I'll show her
how I can open up the roof.

490
00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:12,690
My gosh!

491
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:15,110
Sir, are you going somewhere?

492
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:16,970
- I'm going home.
- I see.

493
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:21,110
You know that we'll have
a welcome party for you, right?

494
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:23,580
Do I have to show up?

495
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:24,580
Pardon?

496
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,340
Gosh, he got me again.

497
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:32,390
Goodness, you are a witty guy
for such a young man.

498
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:34,830
- Seriously.
- We're having a party for him,

499
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:36,330
and he says, "Do I have to show up?"

500
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:38,920
I have no idea how to answer that.

501
00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:44,090
- See you later.
- See you.

502
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:45,530
Okay.

503
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:48,410
Goodness, you have a great car.

504
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:49,440
It smells like a new car too.

505
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,830
Man, I can't believe
you drive around such a car.

506
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:08,860
The owner of the chicken place said
she goes to this school.

507
00:34:12,949 --> 00:34:15,920
That means
she must be a teacher here.

508
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,480
I found you.

509
00:34:28,739 --> 00:34:29,850
The teacher.

510
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:36,820
Goodness, the welcome party?
My foot.

511
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:39,080
I don't even have
enough time to work out.

My gosh. Oh, man.

514
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:07,740
I should change the passcode.

515
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:09,490
I'm dying after a day...

516
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:12,490
of running around with that idiot
in case he says something stupid.

517
00:35:12,490 --> 00:35:13,490
Who?

518
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,680
You know, Park Seok Min,
a guy in my agency.

519
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:17,230
- Drop him.
- Are you crazy?

520
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:19,120
Do you know
how much he makes for me?

521
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:21,570
Oh, right.

522
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:24,300
Mi Kyung asked what your
relationship with Shinhwa Food is.

523
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:25,300
What's going on?

524
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:27,240
I went to work.

525
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,930
- Work?
- As a chief director of a school.

526
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:31,510
Oh, Shinhwa High School?

527
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,050
What does that have to do with her?

528
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:36,480
She's a teacher there.

529
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,790
Mi Kyung is a teacher?

530
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:42,990
Do you know what's funnier?

531
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,890
Seo Yeon is a teacher there too.

532
00:35:44,890 --> 00:35:47,950
What? They both
didn't look like teachers.

533
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:51,230
Hey, you idiot. Did you choose
to work there because of her?

534
00:35:56,330 --> 00:35:58,990
Do you flush away my words
with your poop?

535
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,860
I told you to not let her
find out about your family.

536
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:03,670
Do you know how scary people are
when they get determined?

537
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:05,770
Girls jump all over
a guy like me too.

538
00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:07,670
Think about what they'll do to you.

539
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:09,770
You should've just stayed quiet
and gotten married quietly.

540
00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:11,870
You have no idea
how scary this world is.

541
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:16,050
Goodness.

542
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:17,880
Enough is enough.
It won't be any use...

543
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:18,880
if you die from working out so much.

544
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,460
It didn't happen from working out.

545
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,360
Why are you here?

546
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:24,360
Oh, right. Hey.

547
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,620
Hey, this. Is this you?

548
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:30,970
I was surprised
because Seok Min's name was...

549
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:32,560
suddenly on the most-searched list.

550
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,500
It's because people are saying
this guy looks like him.

551
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,360
But he was in a shooting
at this time.

552
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:39,930
This definitely looks like you.

553
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:40,940
Isn't it you?

554
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:45,170
Right? It couldn't be you.

555
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:47,850
Gosh, why are there
so many guys with a great build?

556
00:36:47,850 --> 00:36:49,110
It means higher competition.

557
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:51,220
I'm starving.
Do you have anything to eat?

558
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:53,250
Gosh, I'm hungry.

Are you all right?

560
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:08,710
Oh, yes. I am.

561
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,860
This design only looks great...

562
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:28,380
on guys with a slim body
and over 180cm of height,

563
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:30,360
so not anyone can pull this off.

564
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,530
You look stunning.

565
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,360
I'll take it.

566
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:43,000
Yes, that'll be 830 dollars.

567
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,170
The amount exceeds the credit limit.

568
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:51,610
The amount exceeds the credit limit.

569
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:55,590
Do you have a different one?

570
00:37:56,850 --> 00:37:58,680
It says the card reached its limit.

571
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:11,340
Darn it, that was embarrassing.

Never mind, then.

You need to practice 100 times.

00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:14,660
How dare he power-trip over food?

649
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:17,630
Why isn't this
getting cooked already?

650
00:44:25,810 --> 00:44:27,680
Eat. It's still meat.

651
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:07,110
Cut this nonsense.

652
00:45:07,850 --> 00:45:09,690
You can buy more yourselves.

653
00:45:09,690 --> 00:45:12,190
It's none of our business.

654
00:45:12,190 --> 00:45:13,460
- Gosh, it's so spicy.
- Goodness.

655
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:16,060
- This is funny.
- Look at you.

656
00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:18,100
Come on, now.

657
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:20,830
All right. Let's move.

658
00:45:20,830 --> 00:45:22,070
It's my treat.

659
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:24,470
What? Okay.

660
00:45:24,470 --> 00:45:25,660
Let's go.

661
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:30,030
Come on. It's not like
we ate a lot to begin with.

662
00:45:30,030 --> 00:45:31,400
Let's go.

663
00:45:32,610 --> 00:45:33,710
Let's go.

664
00:45:34,610 --> 00:45:35,680
Sir!

665
00:45:36,770 --> 00:45:37,950
Let me tag along.

666
00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:39,180
What?

667
00:45:39,370 --> 00:45:41,690
When will I get to ride a car
like this?

668
00:45:41,690 --> 00:45:43,350
Not in my wildest dreams.

669
00:45:43,410 --> 00:45:44,880
Wait a minute.

670
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:46,690
Goodness.

671
00:45:46,690 --> 00:45:48,750
Hold on, hold on...

672
00:45:48,830 --> 00:45:49,860
Sir!

673
00:45:50,750 --> 00:45:51,960
Oh, boy!

674
00:45:52,230 --> 00:45:53,890
Your hand... Oh, no...

675
00:45:53,890 --> 00:45:55,330
My hand was already hurting.

676
00:45:55,330 --> 00:45:57,520
I'm truly sorry!

677
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:59,360
Which finger is it?

678
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:02,260
I'm truly sorry. Let me put
some ointment on it. Let's go.

679
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:05,530
When did they become best buddies?

680
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:07,530
Birds of a feather flock together.

681
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:09,110
Taxi?

682
00:46:09,110 --> 00:46:10,450
Do we have to go?

683
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:13,180
I told you. We should get
on his good side.

684
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:16,720
Would you like me to drive you?

685
00:46:24,330 --> 00:46:26,390
[Rookie Driver]

686
00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:43,580
It must've been recent
since you began driving.

687
00:46:44,370 --> 00:46:47,040
Yes, I didn't really need a car.

688
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:50,190
When did you first learn to drive?

689
00:46:51,010 --> 00:46:52,060
It's been two years.

690
00:46:53,190 --> 00:46:56,020
Two years?
And he's still this terrible?

691
00:46:57,730 --> 00:46:59,650
I'm a slow learner.

692
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:04,490
If it's too much for you,
shall I drive instead?

693
00:47:04,490 --> 00:47:06,490
Right. She's a great driver.

694
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:08,470
No, thank you. You can relax.

695
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:12,400
How could I?

696
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:14,640
Oh, right. This is a secret.

697
00:47:15,350 --> 00:47:18,240
Our new chief director
is the grandson of Shinhwa Food.

698
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:22,820
Is that so?

699
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:25,410
I'm only telling you so that
you won't get on his bad side.

700
00:47:25,410 --> 00:47:26,720
Make sure he likes you.

701
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:30,330
How could you say something
like that about a school?

702
00:47:30,330 --> 00:47:31,890
A school is a sacred place.

703
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:34,200
So what if he's the grandson
of Shinhwa Food?

704
00:47:34,230 --> 00:47:35,860
- You're sweating.
- What?

705
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:38,130
Gosh.

706
00:47:38,530 --> 00:47:40,630
You should be brave
when you say things like that.

707
00:47:41,070 --> 00:47:43,210
Have you guys been friends or...

708
00:47:43,210 --> 00:47:44,980
We went to the same middle school.

709
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:47,630
To be honest, the chief director...

710
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:51,240
I'm sorry. Are you all right?

711
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:53,510
- You scumbag!
- Calm down!

712
00:47:53,510 --> 00:47:55,410
Drive properly!

713
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:03,690
Oh, no!

714
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:05,600
Just wash your face.

715
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:12,700
By the way, I think
I've been here before.

716
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:15,260
Are you stupid? It's that place.

717
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:19,370
This is where Oh Jung Tae
dumped you. Fantasia.

718
00:48:21,350 --> 00:48:23,810
Right. It's that place.

719
00:48:24,210 --> 00:48:26,240
This place is owned by Shinhwa Food.

720
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,820
Wait. Didn't Kang Woo say that
it's his treat?

721
00:48:29,090 --> 00:48:31,510
I'm going to order
two of the most expensive dish.

722
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:34,010
Hey, I'm going to go order now.

723
00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:35,560
Yes!

724
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:37,880
Gosh, she's crazy about food.

725
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:40,290
How could she think about food
at a place where she got dumped?

726
00:48:40,930 --> 00:48:43,260
My gosh! Gosh!

727
00:48:57,110 --> 00:48:59,820
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

728
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:06,250
Gosh.

729
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:21,870
My gosh.

730
00:49:41,890 --> 00:49:42,930
Hey.

731
00:49:43,930 --> 00:49:45,730
- It's you.
- Are you insane?

732
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:47,460
You're going to drive?

733
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:49,490
Go. Give that.

734
00:49:52,370 --> 00:49:54,330
Wait. I'm calling a chauffeur.

735
00:49:54,330 --> 00:49:57,910
Hey, give that to me. Give it!

736
00:49:58,210 --> 00:50:00,140
Are you doing this
because I dumped you?

737
00:50:00,410 --> 00:50:02,570
Are you?

738
00:50:02,570 --> 00:50:04,180
What a lunatic.

739
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:05,380
Fine.

740
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:09,010
I was punished for dumping you.
So what?

741
00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:10,450
Because of you,

742
00:50:11,690 --> 00:50:15,250
a woman rejected my proposal!

743
00:50:15,550 --> 00:50:18,460
What? You proposed?

744
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:20,490
It hasn't been long
since we broke up!

745
00:50:20,490 --> 00:50:23,370
She hates that
I got plastic surgery.

746
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:25,490
She wants someone
with a natural face.

747
00:50:26,170 --> 00:50:28,940
I spent so much money on this face.

748
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:33,330
I spent so much money on this face!

749
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:35,950
Give that to me. I'm going home.

750
00:50:35,950 --> 00:50:37,150
Wake up!

751
00:50:37,150 --> 00:50:38,770
- Who are you...
- Snap out of it!

752
00:50:38,770 --> 00:50:40,270
to stop me?

753
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:43,150
My gosh!

754
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:47,310
I didn't know there was such
a grand place!

755
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:49,020
Seeing how I got to ride your car,

756
00:50:49,020 --> 00:50:51,230
I must've had a lucky dream
last night.

757
00:50:52,990 --> 00:50:55,560
It was indeed nice, sir.

758
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:57,230
I'll go inside first.

759
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:03,240
Nice, my foot.

760
00:51:03,470 --> 00:51:05,180
He turned the steering wheel
however he wants.

761
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:08,770
Darn it.

762
00:51:10,570 --> 00:51:12,620
Let go! Give me my key back!

763
00:51:14,570 --> 00:51:15,950
I told you to wait.

764
00:51:15,950 --> 00:51:17,220
I'll call the chauffeur service.

765
00:51:17,650 --> 00:51:18,660
Hey.

766
00:51:22,350 --> 00:51:23,990
Are you out of your mind?

767
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:25,550
Where are you going?
If you're leaving,

768
00:51:25,550 --> 00:51:27,250
- give back my car key.
- If you want to die, die alone.

769
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:29,930
- You're not my mother.
- Who are you trying to kill?

770
00:51:29,930 --> 00:51:31,290
You're unbelievable.

771
00:51:41,270 --> 00:51:43,800
What is it? What do you want?

772
00:51:44,540 --> 00:51:47,240
What do you want?
Hey, what are you doing?

773
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:51,220
Have you gone mad?

774
00:51:52,750 --> 00:51:54,080
Weren't you even scared by yourself?

775
00:51:54,620 --> 00:51:56,930
What were you trying to do
with a drunk man?

776
00:52:05,970 --> 00:52:08,970
Hello, I'm at Fantasia
in Cheongdam-dong.

777
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:11,440
To Park Apartment in Sangam-dong.

778
00:52:12,030 --> 00:52:13,030
Yes.

779
00:52:17,150 --> 00:52:18,840
Who is he?
How do you know his address?

780
00:52:22,420 --> 00:52:23,540
My ex-boyfriend.

781
00:52:33,850 --> 00:52:34,990
You haven't changed.

782
00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:40,090
Joo Seo Yeon.

783
00:52:41,710 --> 00:52:43,300
You still go for guys' look.

784
00:52:45,070 --> 00:52:46,480
- What?
- What...

785
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:48,500
is your deal?

786
00:52:49,710 --> 00:52:51,210
How can a man like him...

787
00:52:59,420 --> 00:53:00,990
Why are such men...

788
00:53:05,290 --> 00:53:06,490
Why do I...

789
00:53:07,590 --> 00:53:09,820
Why do I... You...

790
00:53:14,870 --> 00:53:16,210
Yes.

791
00:53:16,330 --> 00:53:17,670
You're here?

792
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:30,310
My gosh, this is awesome.

793
00:53:30,310 --> 00:53:32,990
- Look at this.
- I can't believe this.

794
00:53:33,250 --> 00:53:35,080
My gosh, we're making it
so obvious...

795
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:37,190
that we don't come
to places like this.

796
00:53:37,190 --> 00:53:39,350
- My gosh, I've been here before.
- Those are real flowers.

797
00:53:39,350 --> 00:53:40,850
Of course.

798
00:53:41,020 --> 00:53:44,760
- My gosh. Can you believe it?
- This place is so nice.

799
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:46,640
You haven't changed.
Joo Seo Yeon.

800
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:48,640
You still go for guys' look.

801
00:53:50,140 --> 00:53:51,410
I don't like you...

802
00:53:52,410 --> 00:53:54,140
because you're ugly and fat.

803
00:53:56,540 --> 00:54:00,740
I'm old-fashioned. I don't usually
come to a fancy place like this.

804
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:03,950
What's going on? I thought you
were going to order a lot of food.

805
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:05,220
What? Yes.

806
00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:07,890
Do you have a menu?

807
00:54:07,890 --> 00:54:10,430
I'm sorry. A special meal
was reserved for today.

808
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:21,530
We should've eaten a lot of meat.

809
00:54:26,570 --> 00:54:27,800
Try it. It's good.

810
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:31,770
Why would they like
someone like her?

811
00:54:32,570 --> 00:54:34,570
Why did I like someone like her?

812
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:36,220
Why on earth?

813
00:54:54,830 --> 00:54:57,300
All right. Please help yourselves.

814
00:54:57,530 --> 00:54:59,940
They are all very healthy.

815
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:02,100
Vice-Principal, please dig in.

816
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:03,380
Sure.

817
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:06,310
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

818
00:55:06,310 --> 00:55:08,340
When will you be serving
other dishes?

819
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:10,740
This is everything for today's meal.

820
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:11,890
What?

821
00:55:11,990 --> 00:55:14,310
Then, can I order a different dish?

822
00:55:14,310 --> 00:55:16,820
I'm sorry. The time for
the last order has already passed.

823
00:55:20,730 --> 00:55:21,730
Wait.

824
00:55:22,170 --> 00:55:23,560
All right.

825
00:55:24,730 --> 00:55:27,830
Well, the atmosphere at the barbecue
restaurant wasn't good,

826
00:55:27,830 --> 00:55:29,260
so I didn't press on it.

827
00:55:29,260 --> 00:55:30,500
But on a day like this,

828
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:33,270
it's impossible not to listen to
a few words from the chief director.

829
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:35,680
- Please say a few words.
- That's all right.

830
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:38,340
My goodness. Please say something.

831
00:55:39,070 --> 00:55:40,420
Goodness.

832
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:44,280
All right. I believe running
a school is also a business.

833
00:55:44,510 --> 00:55:45,960
To assess the performance of
a business,

834
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:47,310
not only will we consider...

835
00:55:47,310 --> 00:55:48,550
the economic gains,

836
00:55:48,690 --> 00:55:50,630
but we will also consider college
enrollment rate and employment rate.

837
00:55:50,990 --> 00:55:53,130
Of course, educating
the students to become...

838
00:55:53,130 --> 00:55:54,960
morally good members of society
is very important too.

839
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:58,320
Learning such virtues will
depend on the teachers.

840
00:56:01,330 --> 00:56:03,470
Please enjoy the meal
I prepared for you.

841
00:56:12,270 --> 00:56:13,270
You.

842
00:56:17,450 --> 00:56:19,850
What do you think
about criticizing someone...

843
00:56:19,850 --> 00:56:21,720
based on one's looks?

844
00:56:23,490 --> 00:56:25,660
- Pardon?
- For example,

845
00:56:25,990 --> 00:56:28,590
to an awful student
who would say...

846
00:56:28,590 --> 00:56:31,940
that someone is ugly and fat
to his or her face,

847
00:56:32,290 --> 00:56:34,970
how will you educate the student?

848
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:38,640
What is it?

849
00:56:39,070 --> 00:56:41,500
Do you have nothing to say?

850
00:56:44,570 --> 00:56:46,720
That student is very honest.

851
00:56:47,220 --> 00:56:49,840
People ought to be honest.

852
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:52,550
Let me ask you this then.
How will you educate a student...

853
00:56:52,550 --> 00:56:55,010
who would hit on a girl
and ask her to go out with him...

854
00:56:55,010 --> 00:56:57,280
when they don't even know
each other that well?

855
00:56:57,750 --> 00:56:58,750
"Hit on her"?

856
00:56:58,750 --> 00:57:00,850
And how will you educate
a student...

857
00:57:00,850 --> 00:57:02,760
who's holding a grudge...

858
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:05,290
against someone for something
that happened ages ago?

859
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:07,470
- "Grudge"?
- Ms. Joo!

860
00:57:07,470 --> 00:57:09,210
What are you doing?

861
00:57:09,210 --> 00:57:11,260
The chief director asked me first!

862
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:13,910
Sir, the dinner isn't going so well.
Why don't I pour you a drink?

863
00:57:13,910 --> 00:57:15,840
No. I don't drink.

864
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:16,840
- No. Have a drink.
- I...

865
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:18,680
- Let me...
- My gosh.

866
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:20,150
- Oh, no.
- Come on.

867
00:57:20,150 --> 00:57:21,570
Goodness.

868
00:57:21,570 --> 00:57:22,890
That way is to the bathroom.

869
00:57:22,890 --> 00:57:24,280
I don't drink.

870
00:57:28,630 --> 00:57:29,630
What?

871
00:57:34,290 --> 00:57:35,930
- You can use soap...
- My gosh.

872
00:57:42,940 --> 00:57:44,670
What? What is it?

873
00:57:44,670 --> 00:57:47,570
Have you gone mad? You can't go
a day without causing trouble?

874
00:57:47,570 --> 00:57:49,480
He picked a fight with me first.

875
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:52,310
Are you a fighter? You'll throw him
a punch because he started it?

876
00:57:52,310 --> 00:57:53,480
Why are you only yelling at me?

877
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:55,490
Then, should I yell
at the chief director?

878
00:57:55,740 --> 00:57:58,850
How many times did I tell you
he can ruin your career?

879
00:57:58,850 --> 00:58:00,280
Is it that hard to understand?

880
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:02,320
I know that. I understand.

881
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:04,930
And this is how you behave?
Go and apologize to him right now!

882
00:58:04,930 --> 00:58:07,520
Gosh, what apology? Forget it.

883
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:08,520
Go.

884
00:58:08,970 --> 00:58:11,200
You'd better go. Go. Go now.

885
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:12,740
My gosh. I'm going.

886
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:13,740
Go.

887
00:58:14,470 --> 00:58:15,470
Darn it.

888
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:28,450
She's hitting on Lee Min Hyuk too
as if she doesn't have enough men?

889
00:58:37,350 --> 00:58:38,730
Darn it.

890
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:42,200
Darn it. Come on.

891
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:52,180
Gosh. Hey.

892
00:58:55,300 --> 00:58:56,770
I said that...

893
00:58:59,540 --> 00:59:00,950
when I was young.

894
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:03,010
Please forget that.

895
00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:17,430
Well, it's up to you...

896
00:59:17,430 --> 00:59:18,700
to accept my apology or not.

897
00:59:20,370 --> 00:59:22,370
I can't do anything about it
if you don't accept it.

898
00:59:23,170 --> 00:59:26,000
That aside, I hope we can get along.

899
00:59:58,030 --> 00:59:59,710
- Lee Kang Woo.
- No.

900
00:59:59,710 --> 01:00:00,770
You...

901
01:00:00,770 --> 01:00:03,070
It's not what you think.
No! No, it's not!

902
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:18,850
That's right.

903
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:21,660
I told you to stop.

904
01:00:23,430 --> 01:00:25,470
Let's wrap up now.

905
01:00:26,060 --> 01:00:27,790
Take your seat now.

906
01:00:32,070 --> 01:00:33,480
She likes you.

907
01:00:50,660 --> 01:00:51,780
I just...

908
01:00:52,790 --> 01:00:53,960
From that moment...

909
01:01:25,390 --> 01:01:26,490
Yes.

910
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:29,290
It was you.

911
01:01:54,750 --> 01:01:56,280
[Love With Flaws]

912
01:01:56,390 --> 01:01:57,490
The budget for our track team.

913
01:01:57,490 --> 01:01:59,050
He didn't come to work.

914
01:01:59,050 --> 01:02:01,050
I definitely think
Kang Woo is messing with you.

915
01:02:01,050 --> 01:02:02,700
How dare you joke around with me?

916
01:02:02,700 --> 01:02:04,470
Get up, you idiots!

917
01:02:04,470 --> 01:02:06,470
Oh, gosh. You shocked me.

918
01:02:06,470 --> 01:02:09,000
Mr. Lee, why do you
keep giving food to Seo Yeon?

919
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,210
To lure her.

920
01:02:10,670 --> 01:02:12,880
Do you feel nervous
whenever you see her?

921
01:02:12,980 --> 01:02:14,740
I can't believe
I just realized this.

922
01:02:14,740 --> 01:02:17,040
I didn't need any other woman
who isn't you.
