[Episode 15]

3
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:26,180
I'm not going home.

4
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:29,110
I'm staying with you.

5
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,250
What?

6
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:45,590
Let's stay together, Kang Woo.

7
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,170
Seo Yeon.

8
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:03,050
I can't stop myself now.

9
00:01:46,289 --> 00:01:47,400
- Let's...
- Why? What?

10
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,430
What? Why?

11
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:49,930
I... You started talking first!

12
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:51,700
Yes! Yes, I did.

13
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:58,570
Right. Let's...

14
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:00,540
Let's...

15
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:02,900
I need to use the bathroom!

16
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,680
Okay. Take your time.

17
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:07,290
You can take your time.

18
00:02:47,829 --> 00:02:48,829
What are you doing?

19
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,400
Oh, is this too tacky?

20
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:01,110
I...

21
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:03,370
I...

22
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:07,080
don't really know anything.

23
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:08,810
What?

24
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,270
I don't...

25
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:13,370
really know anything.

26
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:17,680
I don't...

27
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:19,920
know anything.

28
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,650
Oh, right. Okay.

29
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,490
I know everything very well.
Don't worry.

30
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:32,770
I know it very well.

31
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:34,340
Really?

32
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:36,930
Yes, I know this very well.

33
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:39,110
So you can just stay still.

34
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:40,240
Oh, okay.

35
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:29,780
What are you doing?

36
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:35,170
Where's Seo Yeon?

37
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:38,640
Why? What's wrong?

38
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,810
Hey, Mi Kyung.

39
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:50,310
I'm sorry to call this late.

40
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,740
This Lee Kang Woo guy.

41
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,810
Do you know his home address?

42
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,790
This is huge.

43
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:03,490
- Let's go.
- Where?

44
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:05,360
To catch
Seo Yeon and Kang Woo red-handed.

45
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:07,370
- What?
- It's going to be so fun!

46
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:08,800
Hold on. Okay.

47
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,540
- Okay. Go slowly.
- Hurry up!

48
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:25,220
Hey.

49
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,440
I don't know much,

50
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,660
but how long will we be like this?

51
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:35,620
Should we...

52
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:38,190
move now?

53
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:39,530
What?

54
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:42,300
To the bedroom.

55
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,170
Right.

56
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:46,170
Okay.

57
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:47,830
- I'll move now.
- Okay.

58
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:11,530
First, let's warm up.

59
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:14,030
Okay. Warmups are always important.

60
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:16,870
Dance! Dance the night away!

61
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:17,990
Yes!

62
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:22,240
I'm getting hot!

63
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,180
My body is getting hot too!

64
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:29,640
Harder!

65
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,850
What are they doing?

66
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,120
It may look weird,

67
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,240
but their conversation
sounds very raunchy.

68
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,240
That's an expensive bottle.

69
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:16,530
Give up now
if you're just going to be pitiful.

70
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:18,690
It's not like that.

71
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,800
I heard you found out
about our parents' accident.

72
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:24,830
I did.

73
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:27,910
Does that mean everything's settled?

74
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:30,700
Yes.

75
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:33,409
But despite all that,

76
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:37,220
I couldn't forget her.

77
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:39,640
I'm sorry...

78
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:43,640
for being so brazen and selfish.

79
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:46,860
You're right.

80
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:58,970
I guess he's not
all that incorrigible.

81
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:11,480
How could you?

82
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,810
Hey, why are you so brazen?

83
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:15,380
Why not?

84
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:17,810
I want to spend the night
with the man I love, so what?

85
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:21,790
What? How could you say that
to your own brother?

86
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:23,580
Over my dead body.

87
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:24,620
If you wish.

88
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:27,030
Hey, stop. What does he do
for a living?

89
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:29,430
He's still wet behind the ears,
so how could he afford that house?

90
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:30,970
Mind your own business.

91
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:34,429
After all that I went through
to go there...

92
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:40,640
This is annoying.
I have no privacy!

93
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,940
Look at her acting so shamelessly.

94
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,850
You better be thankful
that I'm the one who caught you!

95
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:46,980
- Imagine if it was Won Seok!
- Gosh!

96
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:49,240
If you keep acting this way,
I'll tell him all about it!

97
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,030
Thank goodness.
The awkwardness was killing me.

98
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:04,140
What was the problem?

99
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,360
What do you think? Everything.

100
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:09,510
What?

101
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:12,730
Your entire appearance
from head to toe was awful.

102
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,970
Gosh, I don't even want to imagine
what you were wearing underneath.

103
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,180
"Underneath"?

104
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:17,840
What did you wear last night?

105
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:20,420
I wore what I normally wear.

106
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:22,290
Let me see.

107
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:26,790
My gosh. It's a mess.

108
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:30,430
I'm sure his underwear
was a mess as well...

109
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:32,090
since he wasn't prepared.

110
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:34,190
Hey, do you still not get it?

111
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:37,540
Kang Woo is the type
who'd iron his socks all the time...

112
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:38,560
let alone...

113
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:40,960
Never mind.

114
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:44,380
It's fine.

115
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:45,780
Don't be ridiculous.

116
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:00,560
Did you stay up all night?

117
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:07,090
It's understandable.
You were probably too worked up.

118
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:11,590
Hey, wake up.

119
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,540
Wake up.

120
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:17,010
What?

121
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:21,070
I'm sorry. It wasn't my idea
to barge in last night.

122
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,880
No. You did the right thing.

123
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:26,420
She was probably scared.

124
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:30,810
I don't want her to feel that way.
You did well. You did.

125
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:45,800
People might think
I'm moving a dead body.

126
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,810
He looks so pallid.

127
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:59,110
Your entire appearance
from head to toe was awful.

128
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,610
My gosh.

129
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:03,080
It's a mess.

130
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:10,950
I'm so glad he didn't see this.

131
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,190
- Mr. Lee.
- Yes?

132
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:22,510
Yes.

133
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:26,100
How are you feeling?

134
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:30,070
You didn't seem well yesterday.

135
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:34,210
I'm fine. What's that for?

136
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:37,610
One of my students' bandage
was falling off.

137
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:40,580
I wrote a note.

138
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,060
Where did it go?

139
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:47,190
I wrote that I was taking a box...

140
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:49,670
and that I'd bring
a new one tomorrow.

141
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:51,670
There's no need for that.

142
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:54,140
I can give you that much.

143
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:56,730
But still, this is all part
of the school's budget.

144
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:58,880
I'm the chief director.

145
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:01,470
If you keep acting this way,
I'll give you a boxful of those.

146
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:05,050
No. This is more than enough.

147
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:07,710
Thank you.

148
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,420
This was on your back.

149
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,920
I see.

150
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,670
You should be taking initiative.

151
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,830
Why would you back off like that?
You're so pathetic.

152
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:17,180
Honey.

153
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:19,790
What are you thinking about?

154
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:21,130
Joo Seo Yeon.

155
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:22,180
Joo...

156
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:24,820
Joo...

157
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:28,360
What about her?

158
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:32,690
- I visited her school last time.
- Her... Her school?

159
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,670
What did you see...

160
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:38,540
Don't...

161
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:41,470
Don't tell me you saw...

162
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,010
Min Hyuk.

163
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:46,940
What?

164
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:48,810
- Hey.
- Yes?

165
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:50,340
So you went to school.

166
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:54,260
She didn't seem rude...

167
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:56,530
or anything like that.

168
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:59,450
The students seemed to like her too.

169
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:02,270
I thought you hated her.
What's gotten into you?

170
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:06,090
Look at Kang Hee.
She's taking her sweet time.

171
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:08,230
I feel like maybe it's better
for Kang Woo to get married early...

172
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:09,960
if he already has someone.

173
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,440
Darn it!
Had only Kang Hee gotten married,

174
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,440
I wouldn't be thinking like this.

175
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,940
But why are you suddenly
getting upset with her?

176
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:20,980
Darn it!

177
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:41,460
I can't believe this. Goodness.

178
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:48,250
Gosh, my head.

179
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,340
Ms. Lee.

180
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:53,440
Are you not busy?

181
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:56,080
We could've met
after you got off work.

182
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:58,710
I wanted to see your face
in the daylight.

183
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:03,350
My boyfriend is so hot.

184
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:06,560
"Boyfriend"?

185
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:23,340
Tell me about your siblings.

186
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,940
My siblings?

187
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:32,610
So he's the second-oldest.

188
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:34,930
She's the third-oldest.
And this one is the youngest.

189
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,820
You guys look great together.

190
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:39,560
Why did you take the photo
when your sister was sleeping?

191
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:42,360
She doesn't want
to take photos with us.

192
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,670
She thinks she doesn't resemble us.

193
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,500
Well, that's what I think.

194
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:52,810
My parents remarried.

195
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:56,380
She is such a considerate girl,

196
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:58,550
so she has never expressed anything
like that before.

197
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,580
Are you worried about her?

198
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:05,160
Gosh, this is just me thinking.

199
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:07,420
When someone tells me
that she and I don't look alike,

200
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:09,450
I get upset.

201
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:13,500
You must love your sister dearly.

202
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:21,930
Then, this complicates things
even more.

203
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,420
Goodness. You startled me.

204
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,580
Kang Hee, what brings you
all the way here?

205
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:42,660
Break up with her.

206
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:44,930
What?

207
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,060
I told you, didn't I?

208
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:48,960
I can choose whom I marry,
but not you.

209
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,720
What are you talking about?

210
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,300
Break up with her.

211
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:55,540
Did the elders say something to you?

212
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:58,100
We made a deal
that we'd have each other's back.

213
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,570
We did. We made a deal, but...

214
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:03,280
I can compensate for your emotional
and physical damage...

215
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,810
at all costs.

216
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:07,339
- So you should break up with...
- How will you do that?

217
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:09,440
I'll do anything. You just name it.

218
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:13,609
Can you bring back a dead person?

219
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,390
- What?
- I will...

220
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,530
die if I don't have her.

221
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:21,170
I get that you love her,
but that's a bit too much.

222
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:24,640
No, that's how I feel.
It's Seo Yeon and me. That's it.

223
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,560
Have you always been this simple?

224
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,099
I like her.

225
00:17:28,099 --> 00:17:29,470
There's nothing complicated
about that.

226
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:35,640
I don't want to lose her
because I only thought about it.

227
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:37,870
I won't do that.

228
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:42,190
In 1, 2, 3, 4.

229
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:43,810
Watch.

230
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:49,620
2, 3, 4. 2, 2.

231
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:50,730
Here we go.

232
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,390
Gosh, it didn't work.

233
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:56,300
Nice try. You guys did well,
but that's not right.

234
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,890
All right. Watch me, okay?
Here I go.

235
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:01,600
In 1, 2.
Your moves have to be bigger.

236
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:10,950
Did you see that? This is
how you do it. This is dancing.

237
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:15,290
What was that sound?

238
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:16,950
- Are you okay?
- Are you okay?

239
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:22,960
- Oh, my shoulder!
- Oh, no. What should we do?

240
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,000
- What should we do?
- Don't touch it. Don't.

241
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:28,530
My shoulder, Seo Yeon!

242
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,040
Be quiet, you punk.

243
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,810
It hurts. It hurts like crazy!

244
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:39,130
Come on. You won't die
from a dislocated shoulder.

245
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:40,810
That doesn't matter.

246
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:42,010
I told you it hurts.

247
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,450
It hurts so much.

248
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:47,570
I'm sorry.

249
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:48,950
It's probably painful.

250
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:51,310
Yes, it's so painful.

251
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:55,820
Mr. Lee, what if
I won't be able to dance again?

252
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:57,530
You'll be okay.

253
00:18:57,530 --> 00:18:58,620
You're sure, right?

254
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:01,300
You're not lying to me
to calm me down, right?

255
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:03,770
Promise me. Come on, promise me.

256
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:06,060
You brat. Where are your manners?

257
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:08,660
Don't worry. I can't lie.

258
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,630
It hurts so much.

259
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:16,070
Seo Yeon, it hurts.

260
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:18,670
My shoulder! Seo Yeon.

261
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:22,110
Goodness. It hurts.

262
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:27,020
Go ahead. I'll wait for you here.

263
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:28,260
Come with me.

264
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,690
You're only taking an X-ray.
You don't need me there.

265
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:32,230
I'm scared.

266
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,700
Wait for me at the door.

267
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:36,270
Come on.
You're a coward given your build.

268
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:42,470
Thank you, Mr. Lee.

269
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:44,310
I know you're busy. You can go.

270
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:45,370
I'm not busy.

271
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,280
I'll wait until he's done.

272
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,210
No. I'll feel bad if you do.

273
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:51,720
Don't. He's a student
at Shinhwa High School.

274
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:53,170
And he got hurt at school.

275
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:56,690
You're responsible
for your students.

276
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:59,190
Mr. Lee, make sure you wait for me.

277
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,490
Hey. Did a dog steal
your manners from you?

278
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,000
You'll make me take the bus
to save the taxi fare.

279
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:07,890
You have to wait for me.

280
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,200
- Go. Go.
- Seo Yeon.

281
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:25,280
The hospital smell...

282
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:28,190
is the same everywhere.

283
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:31,410
I'm...

284
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,300
Doctor.

285
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,810
Please. I'm begging you.

286
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:51,210
What I told you previously
is all I have.

287
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:53,480
I have nothing else to tell you.

288
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:54,950
I can't let Saet Byul go...

289
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:58,840
without giving her a proper reason.

290
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:03,580
- Ma'am.
- Please.

291
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,220
Just say one word.

292
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:08,320
You saw everything there.

293
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,760
Please say it.

294
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:14,030
Please. Please say it.

295
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:16,560
Please say that
the professor made a mistake.

296
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:19,390
Doctor, please say that for us.

297
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:21,440
Please.

298
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:28,600
Please. You must tell the truth
for the sake of my daughter.

299
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,100
Please. Just one word.

300
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:41,790
It's already over.

301
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:45,000
Don't complicate things...

302
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,460
for your sense of justice.

303
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:47,820
It's not a sense of justice.

304
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:49,730
That's the truth.

305
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:53,240
You did make a mistake, sir.

306
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,240
So what?

307
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:56,310
You did too.

308
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:58,600
You lied to cover up my mistake.

309
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:00,810
And you think
doing that was a mistake.

310
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,670
Since you're the grandson
of Shinhwa Food's chairwoman,

311
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:05,340
you might not care
about keeping a job.

312
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:07,310
But what about your senior
and junior colleagues?

313
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:08,750
If you expose me,

314
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,580
what will happen to those doctors
who lied?

315
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,350
Right. Just this once.

316
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:20,260
Let's just bury this once.

317
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:40,550
You looked like
you needed something sweet.

318
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:48,920
Why do you keep eating sweets?

319
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:52,060
Because I crave affection.

320
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,830
You didn't want
to answer that, right?

321
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,560
Yes.

322
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:07,510
You really can't lie.

323
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:13,050
Would you be offended...

324
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:15,340
if I asked why?

325
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:17,580
Yes.

326
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,090
You look like
you want to ask me that.

327
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:29,820
Was it obvious?

328
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:36,270
I guess there's only
so many lies you can tell.

329
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:41,750
In life, when you tell
a really big lie,

330
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:46,140
you can't lie after that.

331
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:51,560
Are you okay?

332
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,150
It looks like
you're going through something.

333
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:00,260
Why do you...

334
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:02,890
keep worrying about me?

335
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:07,860
It's making my heart flutter.

336
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:18,050
Yes.

337
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:20,050
Where are you? I'm done.

338
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,730
Thank him.

339
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:41,040
How did you know
where our house was?

340
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,970
I've been here a few times.

341
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,070
- Why?
- To see Ms. Joo.

342
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:46,170
What is this?

343
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:48,400
Do you like my sister too?

344
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,900
You brat. Have you gone mad?

345
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:51,640
- I'm a patient.
- You brat.

346
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,640
- It hurts.
- Yes.

347
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,520
I like her.

348
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:03,030
Seo Yeon.

349
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:06,500
Aren't you dating the currently
unemployed former chief director?

350
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,000
You even spent the night out...

351
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,030
Go inside, will you?

352
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:11,940
Go inside.

353
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,360
- Go inside.
- Stop it.

354
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,860
- Darn you.
- I'll get you.

355
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:19,170
I didn't think you were like that.
You made such a mess!

356
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:20,510
- Okay?
- That idiot.

357
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:25,050
Be careful for a few days.

358
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,480
What?

359
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:28,340
Seo Jun's shoulder.

360
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:31,450
Thank you.

361
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:33,220
Goodbye.

362
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,420
Did he miss that?

363
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:49,100
Seo Jun, that idiot. I'll get him.

364
00:25:57,050 --> 00:25:58,450
Why did it have to be you?

365
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:02,310
Why is it you...

366
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:04,190
of all people?

367
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:07,990
You must think I'm a joke.
Why are you picking a fight again?

368
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:11,290
If it was someone else,

369
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,560
I would've just killed him
before I got started.

370
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,630
What?

371
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,940
But it was you of all people.

372
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:25,240
What do you mean?

373
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:30,310
Min Hyuk, are you okay?

374
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:34,750
I'm not okay, so don't touch me.

375
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:37,020
Don't...

376
00:26:38,050 --> 00:26:39,190
mess with me today.

377
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:42,350
- Min Hyuk.
- I told you not to mess with me.

378
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:43,990
- Min Hyuk!
- Are you insane?

379
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:46,700
I told you to stop bothering me.

380
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:55,100
I'm sorry.

381
00:26:58,060 --> 00:26:59,130
What?

382
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:01,010
I'm sorry.

383
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:02,550
For what?

384
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,280
That I couldn't be
an older brother to you.

385
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,310
I was never like
a proper older brother.

386
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:12,060
I'm sorry.

387
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:21,300
This is driving me insane.

388
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,080
What does it mean to be brothers?

389
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:50,850
Do you think my younger brother
will ever forgive me?

390
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:53,730
Did you do anything wrong?

391
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:02,810
He's much smarter
and gifted than I am,

392
00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:06,280
so I figured
he'll be fine on his own.

393
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:11,010
I wasn't trying to be like that.
But I'm just making excuses.

394
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,610
I don't deserve
to be his older brother.

395
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,230
Doctor Kim.

396
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:28,700
I... I wasn't
trying to do this either.

397
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,200
They said he died,

398
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:35,210
that there was no chance
that he could have survived.

399
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,810
Doctor Kim.

400
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:41,810
I'm sorry, Dong Gu! I'm sorry.

401
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:43,950
Goodness, my Dong Gu.

402
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:48,450
You must have resented me so much
over such long years.

403
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:51,580
Dong Gu!

404
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:55,490
Wait, Doctor Kim.
Isn't that your name?

405
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:58,420
No, I'm Kim Bang Gu.

406
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:00,000
Kim Bang Gu?

407
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,970
No, you are Dong Gu.

408
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:13,310
I got confused for a moment.

409
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,070
My older brother's name is Bang Gu.

410
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:18,250
And I'm Dong Gu.

411
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:21,990
So where were we?

412
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,880
Let's get started again.

413
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:31,150
What do you think? Isn't it sexy?

414
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:35,720
This has zero function as underwear.

415
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:38,200
Wouldn't it be better to stay naked?

416
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:40,430
You're so tacky.

417
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:43,370
You can kind of see, but you can't.

418
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:45,130
You want to show, but you won't.

419
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:47,600
- Don't you get it?
- Forget it.

420
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:49,830
I don't want to try that hard.

421
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:51,170
What?

422
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:53,580
Let's go home.

423
00:29:54,810 --> 00:29:56,910
Why do you think Kang Woo...

424
00:29:56,910 --> 00:29:58,670
hasn't called since that day?

425
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:08,460
That girl.

426
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:13,300
Don't you think
Jang Mi is a little odd?

427
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:16,530
How did she know
where Kang Woo lives?

428
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:18,270
And how did she find you here?

429
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,460
I'm the most concerned about...

430
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:23,130
how she goes around
acting as if she's you.

431
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:25,280
She's impersonating you.

432
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,710
She's impersonating me?

433
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:28,450
Are you seriously blind?

434
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:31,720
I thought you didn't say anything
because you were busy with Kang Woo.

435
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,220
You just had no idea?

436
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:34,520
Why would she do that?

437
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,940
That's what I'm saying.

438
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:39,160
Maybe she's a spy
sent here by the state...

439
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,890
to replace you in an emergency.

440
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:43,780
They're trying to preserve
the three Joo brothers'...

441
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:45,660
amazingly handsome DNA.

442
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,720
What kind of nonsense is that?

443
00:30:55,330 --> 00:30:57,440
Do you not have any eyes?

444
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:04,170
Jang Mi?

445
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:12,550
Do you have to do this?

446
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:15,630
Shut it. Joo Hee said she saw
stashes of cash in here.

447
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:19,000
- No!
- My foot.

448
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:22,390
What?

449
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,360
This is only garbage.

450
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:30,330
These aren't garbage.
These are mine.

451
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,670
Aren't these mine?

452
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:36,580
- I'm sorry.
- These don't have any values.

453
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,420
I wanted to be like Seo Yeon.

454
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:46,520
I thought I could be like her...

455
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:48,990
if I started mimicking
everything that she does.

456
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,620
What is she saying?

457
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,590
My goodness.

458
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:57,800
Jang Mi.

459
00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:01,570
I'm a nobody.

460
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:04,140
Why do you want to be like me?

461
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:06,110
You're...

462
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:09,610
a daughter, a younger sister,

463
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:11,270
an older sister, a mom, a grandma,

464
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:13,580
an ancestor, a son,
and a husband to me.

465
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:17,420
What in the world is she saying?

466
00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:20,920
I had always been a useless girl.

467
00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:24,680
But while I stayed here,

468
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:27,760
I realized that
I could be of help to somebody.

469
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,990
How did you help her?

470
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:31,520
- Kang Woo's pictures.
- Mr. Lee's pictures.

471
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:35,540
Seo Yeon.

472
00:32:36,170 --> 00:32:39,540
I'll move out of this house, then.

473
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,800
All of a sudden?

474
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,920
Jang Mi!

475
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:56,680
Wait, so who in the world are you?

476
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,360
Are you really going to
leave like this?

477
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:08,200
The police are looking for you.

478
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,670
They aren't the police.

479
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:11,800
They're hired by my mom.

480
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:13,580
Are you sure you'll be okay?

481
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,340
Don't worry, Seo Yeon.

482
00:33:16,770 --> 00:33:18,210
I'm much stronger now.

483
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:22,240
Call me.
And come visit me at home too.

484
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,110
Don't come too often.

485
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:44,100
No. I'm fine. Not me!

486
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,120
Go.

487
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:33,580
Jang Mi.

488
00:34:34,409 --> 00:34:37,219
- Yes?
- I thought you were going home.

489
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:39,560
This is it.

490
00:34:40,350 --> 00:34:42,159
I own this building.

491
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:43,790
I was too lazy to pay
the monthly rent,

492
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:44,929
so I just bought it.

493
00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:53,179
Baekga Corporation's
annual sales are...

494
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:56,340
I'm going to become
good friends with her.

495
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:59,580
Didn't you accuse her
of being a spy?

496
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:04,040
What? It's Kang Woo.

497
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:07,480
Hello? Yes.

498
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:12,590
Right now? Of course. Bye.

499
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,460
- He wants to see you?
- Yes.

500
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:19,870
Here.

501
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,600
No, thanks.

502
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,450
I feel bad.

503
00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:31,580
Kang Woo's parents think
that we're going to break up.

504
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:33,820
Which era are you from?

505
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:35,040
If you end up breaking up,
then that's that.

506
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,410
But if you want to do it,
then go for it.

507
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,460
No. I can't.

508
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:45,790
Hey! Unlike you, Kang Woo
won't be able to control himself!

509
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:47,790
She's so dense.

510
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:33,530
Kang Woo, have you gone insane?

511
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,710
You met her outside on purpose.

512
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:38,970
Shame on you. Shame on you!

513
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:51,690
What is it? Is it not tasty?

514
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,020
You're wrong.

515
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:56,020
I like it.

516
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:57,630
Me too.

517
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:15,020
Hello.

518
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,580
You had a filthy gaze.

519
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:21,710
Won Jae, are you following me now?

520
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:24,480
Am I following you?
I'm not that rude.

521
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,700
That means a lot coming from someone
who barged into a house at night.

522
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:27,890
Hey, that was...

523
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:35,000
I'm here on a date
with my girlfriend.

524
00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:36,530
Won Jae.

525
00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:40,270
This is the first time
I heard you say, "girlfriend".

526
00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:42,400
- Who is it?
- Would you like to meet her?

527
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,750
You're going to introduce me to her?

528
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:45,010
She'll be here soon.

529
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:48,980
That looks expensive.

530
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:51,520
I have a lot of money.

531
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:55,060
I doubt you're richer
than my girlfriend.

532
00:37:55,330 --> 00:37:56,430
I beg to differ.

533
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:59,250
When it comes to wealth,
I've always been second to none.

534
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:08,860
Hey, I just got here.

535
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:12,280
I just arrived here as well.

536
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:18,740
Come out right now.

537
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,470
Come out this instant.

538
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:22,980
What is it?

539
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:25,110
It's nothing. Enjoy your meal.

540
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:30,460
Make sure you come home tonight.

541
00:38:35,490 --> 00:38:37,620
I've never seen him like that.

542
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:39,200
He must really like her.

543
00:39:08,490 --> 00:39:11,570
I like her. There's nothing
complicated about that.

544
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,830
Right. There's nothing
complicated about it.

545
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,100
What is it? Is something wrong?

546
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:22,840
Won Jae.

547
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:27,150
I've never been
this reckless before.

548
00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:29,110
But do you want...

549
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:32,510
to get married?

550
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:36,530
- What?
- Think about it.

551
00:39:36,530 --> 00:39:38,160
But don't take too long.

552
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:40,120
We may be running out of time.

553
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:01,370
Why did you skip tutoring again?

554
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:03,980
Oh, I caught a cold.

555
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,400
Isn't my father so hale and hearty?

556
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:19,940
The moment I confirmed
what he had seen, he punched me.

557
00:40:21,490 --> 00:40:24,330
He's been a farmer for a long time,

558
00:40:24,330 --> 00:40:26,370
so he is very muscular.

559
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:29,650
He'll be living
for another 50 years,

560
00:40:29,650 --> 00:40:31,740
so I'm sure he'll accept me
in that time.

561
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,320
Tell me.

562
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:43,960
I want to do something for you,

563
00:40:44,830 --> 00:40:47,030
but I can't think of anything.

564
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,430
So tell me.

565
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:53,860
No, there's no need for that.

566
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:56,960
You've already done enough.

567
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:08,150
I want to do...

568
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:11,610
something...

569
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:14,380
for you.

570
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,460
Won Seok, are you home?

571
00:41:40,110 --> 00:41:42,050
He won't ever notice that I took it.

572
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:52,700
Do you want...

573
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,330
to get married?

574
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:57,220
Think about it.
But don't take too long.

575
00:41:58,090 --> 00:41:59,200
What is it?

576
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:03,500
Did her family find out
that she was seeing someone like me?

577
00:42:18,790 --> 00:42:20,850
He put this here
for everyone to see.

578
00:42:22,350 --> 00:42:24,030
I should just rip it.

579
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,080
We're home.

580
00:42:45,450 --> 00:42:48,010
It's my house, not yours.

581
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:51,580
What's wrong?

582
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:53,420
What? It's nothing.

583
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:56,120
Go.

584
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,990
Bye. Sweet dreams.

585
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,720
What? You too.

586
00:43:23,050 --> 00:43:25,550
Oh, come on. This was unnecessary.

587
00:43:26,290 --> 00:43:30,480
Hey! Unlike you, Kang Woo
won't be able to control himself!

588
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:32,720
She's so dense.

589
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:45,460
Like you said, who knows...

590
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:58,650
You should be ashamed of yourself.

591
00:44:05,290 --> 00:44:06,430
Control yourself.

592
00:44:06,430 --> 00:44:08,720
If you're a human,
you should know to control yourself.

593
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,090
Seo Yeon will get scared.

594
00:44:11,090 --> 00:44:12,900
You'll scare her away.

595
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,200
Control yourself.

596
00:44:14,730 --> 00:44:16,730
Control yourself, you jerk.

597
00:44:16,730 --> 00:44:17,860
Control yourself!

598
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:35,980
Gosh, no. It's not what you think.

599
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:37,290
You got the wrong idea.

600
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:42,160
No. It's not what you think.
You got the wrong idea.

601
00:44:44,430 --> 00:44:47,360
I'll try my best not to like you
from now on.

602
00:44:57,100 --> 00:45:00,420
Not to like you. Not to like...

603
00:45:01,510 --> 00:45:04,080
I'll try my best not to like you
from now on.

604
00:45:10,190 --> 00:45:12,400
It's not what you think.
You got the wrong idea.

605
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:20,330
I'll try my best not to like you
from now on. Not to like you.

606
00:45:22,410 --> 00:45:25,230
I'll try my best not to like you
from now on.

607
00:45:35,210 --> 00:45:36,450
A while ago,

608
00:45:36,450 --> 00:45:39,480
I came here
with your uncle and aunt.

609
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:41,290
The food was pretty decent.

610
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:42,880
Yes, this is good.

611
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,300
Min Hyuk.

612
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:54,590
It's about Joo Seo Yeon.

613
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:01,080
Do you like her?

614
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:10,580
What if I do?

615
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:15,380
If you do, I can help you.

616
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:41,570
Did you want to see me?

617
00:46:42,010 --> 00:46:43,620
How's Seo Jun?

618
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:45,240
He's very simple-minded.

619
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:47,920
And he recovers really quickly.
He's totally fine.

620
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:49,010
I'm glad.

621
00:46:55,290 --> 00:46:56,290
Ms. Joo.

622
00:46:57,790 --> 00:46:59,440
Let me apologize to you in advance.

623
00:47:00,170 --> 00:47:01,170
Pardon?

624
00:47:02,610 --> 00:47:04,940
I don't want you to hate me.

625
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:08,270
But I thought hating me...

626
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:11,910
might be better
than having no feelings for me.

627
00:47:13,710 --> 00:47:15,570
I don't follow you.

628
00:47:16,450 --> 00:47:17,450
I'm sorry.

629
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:39,000
Is something going on with him?

630
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:52,420
Hello?

631
00:47:52,590 --> 00:47:53,920
Is this Ms. Joo Seo Yeon?

632
00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:57,220
Yes, this is Joo Seo Yeon speaking.

633

This is Kang Woo's grandmother.

634

Yes. Hello.

Hey.

637
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:12,230
- Hey, Joo Hee!
- Look at this jerk.

638
00:48:12,530 --> 00:48:14,710
He's a well-known trainee.

639
00:48:14,710 --> 00:48:16,680
People are bringing up our agency.

640

Tell him to come to my office.

641
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:22,470
Pardon?

642
00:48:22,850 --> 00:48:26,010
You want to talk
to a mere trainee yourself?

643
00:48:27,510 --> 00:48:29,630
Is that what you think? Do you think
it's not fair for others?

Yes.

00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:32,780
Why didn't you answer your phone?

665
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:33,980
You startled me.

666
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:36,520
You saw the photo, right?

667
00:49:36,750 --> 00:49:37,980
Does your agency know?

668
00:49:38,190 --> 00:49:40,520
Gosh, HS Entertainment
is indeed great.

669
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:42,160
They terminated
my contract right away.

670
00:49:42,430 --> 00:49:43,490
They did?

671
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:45,100
Why?

672
00:49:45,670 --> 00:49:48,100
Otherwise, they would've ruined you.
What else could I do?

673
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:52,110
Since people already know my face,

674
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:54,910
- I don't care about what people...
- I didn't do that.

675
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:58,240
I'm not an escort.

676
00:49:58,740 --> 00:49:59,950
Did you quit?

677
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:01,650
That's great.

678
00:50:01,650 --> 00:50:03,650
You should quit
before Seo Yeon finds out.

679
00:50:03,650 --> 00:50:05,590
If Seo Yeon finds out,
you'd be dead.

680
00:50:08,190 --> 00:50:09,520
- Darn it.
- You fool!

681
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:11,460
I wasn't an escort to begin with!

682
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:13,660
What?

683
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,940
These babies
must be so suffocated here.

684
00:50:29,070 --> 00:50:32,240
When they look at other cars,
racing on the street,

685
00:50:32,470 --> 00:50:33,680
they must be jealous, right?

686
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:36,510
Do you feel suffocated
in your office too?

687
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:57,140
Mr. Joo ran away.

688
00:51:01,030 --> 00:51:03,070
[Mr. Joo Won Jae]

689
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:12,120
Hello?

690
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:13,280
Let's do it.

691
00:51:13,750 --> 00:51:15,960
Let's get married.

692
00:51:16,780 --> 00:51:18,820
- What?
- I want to be the person...

693
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:20,960
you come to take a breather
when you feel suffocated.

694
00:51:21,290 --> 00:51:22,360
So...

695
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:26,260
marry me, Ms. Lee.

696
00:51:42,740 --> 00:51:44,620
What are you thinking
so deeply about?

697
00:51:45,190 --> 00:51:46,250
Are you thinking about me?

698
00:51:56,870 --> 00:51:58,060
Mr. Lee.

699
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:03,260
Do you want to have dinner with me?

700
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:25,280
Ms. Joo.

701
00:52:33,340 --> 00:52:35,400
You know that I can't lie, right?

702
00:52:38,110 --> 00:52:39,500
Can you ask me...

703
00:52:40,530 --> 00:52:42,000
if I will be able...

704
00:52:44,540 --> 00:52:46,210
to stop liking you?

705
00:52:52,540 --> 00:52:53,660
Please ask me that.

706
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:01,600
Could you...

707
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:05,600
stop liking me?

708
00:53:09,610 --> 00:53:10,760
I'll try my best...

709
00:53:12,370 --> 00:53:15,880
not to like you from now on.

710
00:53:19,770 --> 00:53:21,180
I think I can do it.

711
00:53:24,710 --> 00:53:27,960
I'm sorry to cause you pain.
I'm a nobody.

712
00:53:29,890 --> 00:53:31,550
The times when I developed...

713
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:34,460
my feelings for you
are precious to me.

714
00:53:35,550 --> 00:53:37,490
So don't think that way.

715
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:41,990
Thank you for letting me like...

716
00:53:42,870 --> 00:53:44,870
someone great like you, Ms. Joo.

717
00:53:49,110 --> 00:53:50,450
Thanks for dinner.

718
00:53:51,970 --> 00:53:53,070
Wait.

719
00:53:55,570 --> 00:53:56,620
May I...

720
00:53:57,980 --> 00:53:59,310
hug you once?

721
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:12,490
I wanted to give you a hug
whenever I see you. That's all.

722
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:16,640
Sure.

723
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:18,710
Give me a hug.

724
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:29,270
Thank you,

725
00:54:30,310 --> 00:54:31,310
Mr. Lee.

726
00:54:32,540 --> 00:54:33,710
I'll see you again...

727
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:36,780
safely at school.

728
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:41,320
What?

729
00:54:41,750 --> 00:54:43,290
I have a feeling that...

730
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:46,700
I may not survive today.

731
00:54:51,710 --> 00:54:54,730
Min Hyuk! I'm going to kill you!

732
00:54:54,730 --> 00:54:55,770
Kang Woo?

733
00:54:56,380 --> 00:54:59,650
Hey, that's not it! You're wrong!

734
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:07,420
Are you angry?

735
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:11,520
Why did you hug him?
Why would you hug another man?

736
00:55:11,930 --> 00:55:13,930
I told you the reason.

737
00:55:13,930 --> 00:55:17,430
Why did you go with him?
You could have declined it.

738
00:55:17,630 --> 00:55:21,260
Kang Woo, if you'll stay angry,
I can't tell you what I have to.

739
00:55:22,730 --> 00:55:23,760
Something you have to tell me?

740
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:26,060
What is it?

741
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:27,910
Today,

742
00:55:29,210 --> 00:55:30,950
I talked to your grandmother.

743
00:55:31,610 --> 00:55:34,450
What? With my grandmother? Why?

744
00:55:35,380 --> 00:55:37,150
Did she say something awful to you?

745
00:55:37,540 --> 00:55:38,620
Kang Woo.

746
00:55:38,850 --> 00:55:42,620
Why didn't she talk to me?
Why did she call you?

747
00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:43,980
She said she'll keep her eyes on us.

748
00:55:45,860 --> 00:55:48,290
She's giving us her support.

749
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:50,220
She told me to date you.

750
00:55:50,370 --> 00:55:53,700
What? All of a sudden? Why?

751
00:55:55,170 --> 00:55:58,730
I have no idea.
But she definitely said,

752
00:55:59,260 --> 00:56:02,230
"Take good care of my Kang Woo."

753
00:56:13,190 --> 00:56:15,460
It's about Joo Seo Yeon.

754
00:56:16,310 --> 00:56:18,430
Do you like her?

755
00:56:25,370 --> 00:56:26,440
What if I do?

756
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:29,400
If you do, I can help you.

757
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:37,350
No.

758
00:56:37,710 --> 00:56:38,740
No.

759
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:41,880
You got the wrong idea.

760
00:56:42,810 --> 00:56:45,540
It's not what you think.

761
00:56:46,190 --> 00:56:47,310
You got the wrong idea.

762
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:58,720
It's not what you think.

763
00:56:59,430 --> 00:57:00,560
You got the wrong idea.

764
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:03,260
Are you sure about that?

765
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:06,230
You already know that I can't lie.

766
00:57:07,530 --> 00:57:08,530
Right.

767
00:57:13,210 --> 00:57:14,850
Ms. Joo is a great person.

768
00:57:16,180 --> 00:57:17,740
Kang Woo almost doesn't deserve her.

769
00:57:19,090 --> 00:57:20,120
So...

770
00:57:22,780 --> 00:57:24,320
please don't give her a tough time.

771
00:57:45,650 --> 00:57:47,010
I'm glad I practiced.

772

What do you think? Are you happy?

773
00:57:59,860 --> 00:58:03,130
Of course, I am.
She gave us her approval.

774
00:58:04,820 --> 00:58:06,600
So are you saying...

775
00:58:10,460 --> 00:58:11,840
you agree?

776
00:58:12,710 --> 00:58:13,840
Is that so?

777
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:28,310
But your mother and father
haven't approved yet...

778
00:58:28,310 --> 00:58:29,390
I can win against them.

779
00:58:29,420 --> 00:58:32,130
There's no winning or losing
between parents and children.

780
00:58:32,130 --> 00:58:34,460
- And we aren't even sure...
- I'm sure.

What?

788
00:59:13,990 --> 00:59:16,760
For a bit. For just a bit.

789
00:59:18,370 --> 00:59:21,840
Wait, if you feel uncomfortable
or uneasy about this...

790
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:24,000
No, I'm all for it.

791
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:27,210
It's not like that.
It's not that, but...

792
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:30,040
I got...

793
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:36,930
pretty underwear
from Mi Kyung, so...

794
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:42,750
Anyway, I have to go home.

795
00:59:43,490 --> 00:59:45,820
Seo Yeon, are you that slow?

796
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:49,340
Do you think
I care about that right now?

797
00:59:50,030 --> 00:59:51,870
I'm pretty much blind.

798
00:59:53,910 --> 00:59:55,110
You're the only one I see.

He really loves you! Real love!

802
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:09,980
Ms. Joo, I'm sorry.

803
01:01:09,980 --> 01:01:11,120
I got in trouble.

804
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:12,620
What are you talking about?

805
01:01:12,620 --> 01:01:15,420
You should have turned it down.
You aren't as fun as I thought.

806
01:01:15,420 --> 01:01:17,690
I warned you when I stopped you
from coming to me...

807
01:01:17,690 --> 01:01:19,130
that I'd keep holding onto you.

808
01:01:19,130 --> 01:01:22,020
At times, we have to
bury things and move on.

809
01:01:22,020 --> 01:01:25,020
So you should let it go too.

810
01:01:25,020 --> 01:01:27,700
I thought about it,
and we might have a chance.

811
01:01:27,700 --> 01:01:29,700
We don't know how long it'll take.

812

My gosh, stop it. That tickles.

813
01:01:32,870 --> 01:01:34,070
Those are the good times.

814
01:01:34,070 --> 01:01:35,530
You haven't told them
that we're dating?

815
01:01:35,530 --> 01:01:36,880
Do I have to do that already?

816
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:38,950
"Already"? You're making me
a little anxious.

817
01:01:38,950 --> 01:01:40,680
Whatever. It's embarrassing.

818
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:41,770
I embarrass you?

819
01:01:41,770 --> 01:01:44,280
- I'm worried.
- Then stop seeing her.
