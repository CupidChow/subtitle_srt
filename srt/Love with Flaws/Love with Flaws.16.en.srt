[Episode 16]

3
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,720
Are you awake?

4
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:40,770
Are you okay?

5
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:56,190
Why are you leaving already?

6
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,960
My brothers are probably
still sleeping.

7
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,220
I should go before they wake up.

8
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:04,270
Don't go. Okay?

9
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:06,460
No, I need to go.

10
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,190
Let's hang out.

11
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:29,160
What?

12
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:31,630
Why are you two together
from the early morning?

13
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:34,600
Why are you coming home now?

14
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,720
What?

15
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:37,820
Bye.

16
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,840
I got you!
Let's have the bibimbap later!

17
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,040
She must be so happy.

18
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:55,970
I need to change.

19
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,940
Then do it. We always changed
in front of each other.

20
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,030
What?

21
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:07,390
Why is this here?
You didn't wear it?

22
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,070
What? No.

23
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,160
Goodness.

24
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:14,390
Kang Woo really loves you.

25
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:18,160
He really loves you! Real love!

26
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,730
Be quiet! My brothers will hear you!

27
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,070
It's love.

28
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:26,880
That little...

29
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:33,320
I'm pretty much blind.
You're the only one I see.

30
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:05,290
Don't be fooled.

31
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:09,620
You're just being deceived
by some hormones...

32
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:11,880
such as oxytocin and dopamine.

33
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:15,450
They're sugarcoating
this entire phenomenon...

34
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,920
as love.

35
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:20,730
Doctor Kim.

36
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,070
Do you know me?

37
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:25,070
What?

38
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:37,190
Hello, the man who claims
to be my brother.

39
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:40,760
Don't worry. I only came out
to get some fresh air.

40
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,360
What was that?

41
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:54,740
Won Seok. Come on out
if you're up. Let's eat.

42
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:02,810
Do you want some?

43
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:07,070
What? Yes. I should.

44
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:16,420
You seem odd today.

45
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:21,260
I do? What do you mean?
That's not true.

46
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,090
Won Jae. Seo Yeon.

47
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,010
Help me.

48
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,270
Ms. Joo, I'm sorry.

49
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:35,380
I caused...

50
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:39,200
trouble.

51
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:46,490
What in the world do you mean?

52
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:49,650
You... You punk!

53
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:51,860
Won Seok! Come on out!

54
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:55,500
Explain, you punk!

55
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,690
Won Jae!

56
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,070
I was kicked out because of her.

57
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:03,810
Hey! Don't be cheap like that!
You just misunderstood me!

58
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:06,740
Right. Thanks to you!

59
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:09,610
- What? You little...
- What?

60
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:20,620
So...

61
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,150
she's a student of yours
that you took in?

62
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:27,360
Yes. I just thought I should
clear up some misunderstandings.

63
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,130
I'm sorry.

64
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,260
I heard he caused some trouble.

65
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:35,530
It's okay. He's not big enough
to cause us any harm.

66
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,010
So what was going on
in that video?

67
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:40,200
She was working as a fit model
for an online store,

68
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,810
and he misunderstood the situation.

69
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:44,340
She wore clothes and makeup
that she normally didn't.

70
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:46,110
He was just trying to dissuade her.

71
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:48,440
I'm sorry.

72
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,280
You were a better guy
than I had expected.

73
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:56,190
I thought you'd blame it all on her
just so you could remain here.

74
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:00,520
Right, that's me.

75
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:04,000
- Shut it. Shut it.
- That hurts.

76
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:06,870
No, that's great.

77
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:09,590
Having high self-esteem is crucial
in this industry.

78
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:10,630
You won't be able to hold out...

79
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,030
if you crumble just
after reading one malicious comment.

80
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:19,400
Did you wish to see me, sir?

81
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:22,510
- Hey.
- Hey, Jung Ho.

82
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,150
[A high school trainee
is living with an escort.]

83
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:31,880
Why did you do it?

84
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:35,860
- Sorry?
- You uploaded this.

85
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:38,690
- I...
- You should've been more careful.

86
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:40,170
There was a witness.

87
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:46,310
Door closing.

88
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:48,810
That looked like Seo Jun's picture.

89
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:56,750
I don't want to hear it.
Go train somewhere else.

90
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:57,920
Sir...

91
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,920
What? Do you think
the punishment's too severe?

92
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,710
Do you want to hear something
more upsetting?

93
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:07,150
You were going to debut
as a member...

94
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:08,500
of the next group after Hi-Seven.

95
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:10,130
You were the number-one pick.

96
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:16,890
But no matter how talented you are,
if you have a terrible character,

97
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:18,760
we can't train you.

98
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,070
So...

99
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,940
Get out.

100
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:41,500
Jung Ho!

101
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:54,530
That night, I was going home
from your place. Do you know that?

102
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:57,750
I was worried about you!

103
00:08:57,850 --> 00:08:59,770
So what?

104
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:04,540
But I won't worry about you anymore.

105
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:07,180
Now, I know how strong you are.

106
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:10,150
So keep that up,

107
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:11,920
and let's meet on stage.

108
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:14,960
Let's compete as singers,
not trainees.

109
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:19,020
Mr. Park said he wouldn't tell
the others why you quit.

110
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:21,160
You're competent, so many agencies
will want you.

111
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,240
Are you...

112
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:24,400
sympathizing with me?

113
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,930
Yes, I am. So what? Is that bad?

114
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,030
Come at me on stage.
I'll beat you for sure.

115
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,760
I'll do my best
to support your brother.

116
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,490
If he does well, he could be
the next Park Seok Min.

117
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:49,100
What is it?

118
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:51,160
You...

119
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,340
You really are the president,
aren't you?

120
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:56,370
You're...

121
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,510
pretty cool.

122
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:02,530
I am?

123
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,410
You should tell Mi Kyung
about how cool I am, then.

124
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:19,490
Don't you dare hurt her.

125
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:22,650
If you make her cry,

126
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,660
I will kill you.

127
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:40,850
Bye.

128
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:46,220
She means everything she says.

129
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,460
How is Kang Woo, that scaredy-cat,
not afraid of her?

130
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,100
Why are you working on your day off?

131
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:01,340
I guess you have no one
to hang out with.

132
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:07,380
Why are you working on your day off?

133
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,770
I guess you have no one
to hang out with.

134
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:12,980
Why are you...

135
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:14,810
Stop it.

136
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:16,640
Why did you pretend
that you didn't hear me?

137
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:19,310
There's no way I didn't hear you.

138
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:21,410
- I'm ignoring you.
- Why are you ignoring me?

139
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:22,960
Why are you ignoring me?
I'm older than you!

140
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,990
Are you here to pick a fight?

141
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:26,280
Yes.
I can pick a fight with you too.

142
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,150
- What?
- You think only you have feelings?

143
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:29,330
I have feelings too.

144
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:30,920
Gosh, he's so immature.

145
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,700
Grandma told me.

146
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,030
You're so nosy.

147
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:45,010
Should I withdraw
what I told Grandma?

148
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:46,010
No!

149
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:49,910
Are you busy?

150
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:51,680
Isn't that obvious?

151
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:56,590
Well, do you want some food?

152
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:13,210
What are you doing? You said
you wanted to get some food.

153
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:16,930
Yes. Let's eat!

154
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,510
Is this a meal?

155
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:25,590
Yes. Why?

156
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,550
Are you regularly
getting medical checkups?

157
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:35,000
I'm glad I brought this with me.

158
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:39,290
Here.

159
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,340
This checks your blood sugar.

160
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:42,790
Put a drop of your blood
every morning and night.

161
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:47,980
Darn it.

162
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,380
Hey, I bought this
because I was worried about you.

163
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:52,210
You're in no position
to worry about me, Anus.

164
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:54,350
What?

165
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:56,850
I heard from Hyun Soo.

166
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:58,680
Your nickname was Anus.

167
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,910
I'm glad I didn't hang out
with you when I was young.

168
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:03,380
I might have gotten
the same nickname if I did.

169
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:04,860
You Anus.

170
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:07,830
You... Why are you so mean?

171
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:09,290
Were you always this mean?

172
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,160
- Eat up.
- No, I won't.

173
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,230
Whatever.

174
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,790
I'll eat.

175
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,760
You're so mean.

176
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:24,710
Okay.

177
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,140
I'll cut back on sweets.

178
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,120
- Don't hold my hand.
- Okay.

179
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:46,870
Yes. Where are you?

180
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:48,200
I'm here.

181
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,710
Mr. Joo. I see you. Right here.

182
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,400
Mr. Joo.

183
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,590
What are you doing?

184
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:08,180
The owner had to use
the restroom really badly.

185
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,410
You're watching over the shop?

186
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:12,630
- Do you know the owner?
- No.

187
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:14,830
But it looked like
he really had to go.

188
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:18,420
I couldn't sell anything.
I should try to sell one at least.

189
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,130
How much is it?

190
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:23,060
No, you don't have to buy it.

191
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:25,160
- How much?
- No. It's okay.

192
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,480
Gosh, why am I so clumsy?

193
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:35,810
I always cause trouble for you.

194
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:42,860
This isn't your photo.

195
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:46,830
That's my dad when he was young.

196
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:49,520
I carry his photo. It's a habit.

197
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,020
I see.

198
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:54,260
He's really cool.

199
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,530
You resemble your father a lot.

200
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:01,980
Well, I guess.

201
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:10,880
Thank you...

202
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:15,310
for helping him live
such a great life.

203
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,660
Is this it?

204
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:10,030
The receiver cannot be reached.
You will be...

205
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:12,670
Is she busy?

206
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:16,220
Hey.

207
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,310
What brings you here?

208
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:20,680
Are you here to buy a car?

209
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:25,090
No. Mr. Joo Won Seok told me
to give you something.

210
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:28,330
Here.

211
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:31,470
Wait. Hold on.

212
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:54,310
May I ask you about the photo?

213
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,860
It's the place he picked
to commit suicide.

214
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:01,260
What?

215
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:04,260
When he saw this place on TV
a long time ago, he said...

216
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:08,000
dying at a place like that
wouldn't be so bad.

217
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,710
And afterward,
he put this photo on his desk.

218
00:17:13,609 --> 00:17:14,770
Jerk.

219
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:17,950
He knew that I knew what he said.

220
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:22,849
I wanted to rip this photo
for a very long time.

221
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:27,609
I thought that perhaps, he was
hanging in there with this photo.

222
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,350
So I was scared too.

223
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:32,960
Does it mean that
he's still having a hard time...

224
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:34,460
Don't worry.

225
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,520
It looks like he sent you to me
as a way to tell me...

226
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:40,400
that he won't do such a thing.

227
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,220
I got the photo.

228
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:01,350
Did he change your mind?

229
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:17,200
[He was grateful
because I was living my life.]

230
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:21,770
Ms. Lee.

231
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:29,840
- How did you get in?
- Your secretary recognized me.

232
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,510
Why aren't you answering your phone?

233
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:35,920
Can't you see that I'm working?

234
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,190
I'm not someone...

235
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:40,890
who can pick up your call
whenever you call me.

236
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,020
What's wrong?

237
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:46,120
Are you angry at me?

238
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,200
You should have said no.

239
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:52,360
Were you really after my assets?

240
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:54,910
That must be
why you quickly said yes.

241
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:57,840
- What?
- What's up with your innocent act?

242
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,650
Do you think
just anyone can marry me?

243
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:02,540
I was just testing you.

244
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:06,010
- Ms. Lee.
- You're not as fun as I thought.

245
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:09,190
Let's end this now.

246
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:12,850
It's over.

247
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:17,970
You're lying to me.

248
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,500
Based on what?

249
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:23,060
You looked at me...

250
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,210
just the way I looked at you
all this time.

251
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:32,070
I definitely warned you
when you asked me out.

252
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:34,610
I will stop you
if you tried to leave me.

253
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,040
I don't know why
you're suddenly pushing me away,

254
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:42,190
but I'll stop you.

255
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:44,660
So let me.

256
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,120
If not today,

257
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
tomorrow.

258
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:53,360
If not tomorrow,

259
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:56,140
some other day.

260
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:03,010
For today,

261
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:05,210
I'll just go.

262
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:34,510
I missed you.

263
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:37,770
We were together this morning.

264
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:43,540
This.

265
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:48,550
Can you save these? I'm far
from having a green thumb at all!

266
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:03,740
What is it?

267
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,030
What did your brothers say?

268
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,300
About what?

269
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:07,830
You and me.

270
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:10,530
- What about you and me?
- That we are dating.

271
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:13,210
- What?
- Wait, did you not...

272
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:14,720
tell them yet?

273
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:17,840
They pretty much know.
Is that necessary?

274
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,280
I want to receive
their formal approval.

275
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,550
Do you have to do that already?

276
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:25,390
"Already"? What do you mean by that?
What's with you?

277
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:27,160
What?

278
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:31,020
Why does it feel like
you're taking a step back?

279
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:33,590
You're making me anxious.

280
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:37,400
Well...

281
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:39,300
It's embarrassing.

282
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,370
I embarrass you?

283
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:45,370
No, that's not what I mean.

284
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:48,980
I don't know. It just feels weird...

285
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:52,990
to tell them
that I'm dating someone.

286
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:58,230
- Let's go.
- What?

287
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:02,120
I didn't think this through.
It'll be easier if I tell them.

288
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:04,350
Stay here. I'll get changed.

289
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:06,820
It doesn't have to be today.

290
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:07,940
It'll be today.

291
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,530
Gosh, it's really embarrassing.

292
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:29,850
Won Seok is going to be late.

293
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:32,780
What? Let's do it next time, then.

294
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,160
Are you here to ask for her hand?

295
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,260
Will you say yes...

296
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:42,170
No, we're... It's just that we're...

297
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:44,360
- Dating.
- That was random.

298
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,970
It would make no sense if you didn't
even after you made such a scene.

299
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:48,510
What on earth do you do, old man?

300
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:49,830
I'm not an old man...

301
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,310
I make clothes.

302
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:57,770
Clothes?

303
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:01,390
You went from the chief director
to making clothes? That's odd.

304
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:04,350
- The chief director?
- He worked at my school as one,

305
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:07,050
only for a short while.
I guess he isn't that competent.

306
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:08,590
Hey, Seo Jun!

307
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:11,970
Wait, your school?
Shinhwa High School?

308
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,140
Can just anyone work there
as a chief director?

309
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,530
The grandson of Shinhwa Food.

310
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,770
He's the grandson of Shinhwa Food.

311
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:23,100
You didn't know?

312
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:27,870
Are you a rich old man?

313
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:34,390
Well, it's not exactly me,
but my family is a bit rich.

314
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:36,780
You.

315
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:39,350
You.

316
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,020
You.

317
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:54,600
Ms. Lee?

318
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:56,940
Yes?

319
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:00,680
Your mom and grandmother are
willing to meet that girl...

320
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:03,680
whom Kang Woo has been dating.

321
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,150
What does that mean?

322
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:08,110
They won't disapprove of her,
so it's like a casual meeting.

323
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:09,420
A casual meeting?

324
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,160
Why are they in such a rush?

325
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,730
It's because of you.

326
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:15,320
Your mom is really worried...

327
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,960
that Kang Woo may not want to marry
just like you. That's why.

328
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,020
Here.

329
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:25,970
Dad.

330
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,300
I thought I was really smart,

331
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,540
but I'm really foolish.

332
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,070
I thought I was really mean,

333
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,080
but I'm really nice,

334
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,420
like a fool.

335
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:47,490
Ms. Lee.

336
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:49,290
Kang Hee.

337
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:51,470
Kang Hee...

338
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,520
Wait.

339
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:56,970
Is something going on with her?

340
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:10,980
Why does she let just anybody in?

341
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:13,650
- Wait...
- Ms. Kim? Ms. Kim!

342
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:14,810
Wow, already?

343
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:16,960
I'm already just anybody?

344
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:25,670
You knew, didn't you?

345
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:30,700
You knew that my sister has been
dating your brother, didn't you?

346
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:36,800
- What kind of...
- Darned situation is this?

347
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,540
Should we just go for it?

348
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:45,990
If you hang onto me, I'll stay.

349
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:01,430
I'm sorry.

350
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:06,940
I'm glad...

351
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:11,330
that you aren't so selfish, Mr. Joo.

352
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:14,750
I'm sorry.

353
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:20,010
I can stay strong,

354
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:22,990
but my brother, Kang Woo,
can't do that.

355
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:54,610
Mr. Joo.

356
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:14,980
I liked...

357
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:20,270
I liked you way more than
I thought I did...

358
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:23,070
I know.

359
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:31,460
I know.

360
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,430
That's enough, then.

361
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:13,160
[Final Episode]

362
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:16,190
My goodness.

363
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:17,500
Hey.

364
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:20,290
Did you bring that from
the chief director's office again?

365
00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:21,360
Wait.

366
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,530
I can't believe how bold you are.

367
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:26,340
You didn't even take that
from the Health Office.

368
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:29,440
What are you talking about?

369
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:32,070
The chief director
gave this to us himself!

370
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:34,000
- You're mistaken.
- Yes, himself.

371
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:36,020
Are you sure?

372
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:38,020
My gosh, yes.

373
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:39,910
I'm telling you.

374
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:44,230
We... We're serious.

375
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,120
If you can't trust us,

376
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,900
then you can go ask him yourself.
Go ask him!

377
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,630
Don't be so cheap with food.

378
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:56,730
Yes, go ask him.

379
00:28:57,630 --> 00:28:58,630
Goodbye.

380
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,510
What's with them?

381
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:05,800
He must've been frightened
when you took their snacks away.

382
00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:07,940
I told you to be gentle.

383
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:23,750
I'm totally fine.

384
00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:29,730
Yes?

385
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:38,580
Mr. Lee, did you really give
the snacks to the vice principal?

386
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,080
What?

387
00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:42,810
Oh, yes.

388
00:29:42,810 --> 00:29:43,810
Why?

389
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,580
I wanted to change.

390
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:50,310
So it was true. I was wrong.

391
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:53,390
Then goodbye.

392
00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:00,770
- Ms. Joo.
- Don't worry about me.

393
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,530
Darn it.

394
00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:10,230
I thought the vice principal
was lying.

395
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:22,080
I'm worried...

396
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:25,520
that Seo Yeon will be scared...

397
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:28,130
after meeting my mom and my grandma.

398
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:30,600
Then break up.

399
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:32,330
Love...

400
00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:34,640
is insane.

401
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:37,270
You aren't...

402
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:40,830
Doctor Kim, are you?

403
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:44,080
You.

404
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,740
Who are you?

405
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:48,020
Who do you think...

406
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,580
I am?

407
00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:53,320
Dong Gu!

408
00:30:54,290 --> 00:30:56,290
How could you go out
without telling me?

409
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:00,890
- Oh, dear.
- There... There are...

410
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:03,450
There are two Doctor Kims!

411
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:05,630
What is this? What's going on?

412
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,040
So you were money-hungry...

413
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,110
and decided to pretend
to be Doctor Kim?

414
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:22,170
I was looking for my brother
for five years.

415
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:23,850
I thought he had died,
so I came here...

416
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:24,980
to take care of his belongings.

417
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:26,420
And that's when we met.

418
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,760
I am...

419
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:30,290
truly sorry.

420
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,130
What about the others?

421
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:40,100
Are there any more victims
other than me?

422
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:43,170
No. Not at all.

423
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,360
I'm not as brave as I seem.

424
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,140
You were the only one.

425
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:57,320
My brother did nothing wrong!

426
00:31:57,710 --> 00:32:00,210
Please leave him out of this.

427
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:02,550
You can report and punish me
if you wish.

428
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:08,020
I have no intention of doing that.

429
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:09,830
What?

430
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:12,070
Had I met...

431
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:16,330
the real Doctor Kim,

432
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:23,170
I might not have come this far.

433
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:25,880
What do you mean?

434
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:31,190
Don't you ever do this again,

435
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,260
Mr. Kim Bang Gu.

436
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:47,660
Mr. Lee, thank you.

437
00:32:50,370 --> 00:32:51,510
Thank you.

438
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:57,400
Hey, Won Seok.
Let me call you a bit later.

439
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,880
- What's wrong?
- Well...

440
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,250
Father, please!

441
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:01,520
Let me have the phone.

442
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:05,540
Do you like chestnut or pumpkin?

443
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:10,450
- What?
- Which one do you like?

444
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:11,990
I like...

445
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:14,330
chestnuts.

446
00:33:15,390 --> 00:33:16,720
I like chestnuts, sir.

447
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,390
You must be very stuffy inside.

448
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:20,330
Come on, Father!

449
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:22,830
Ignore him.

450
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:24,600
If you said pumpkin,
he'd say you're a pushover.

451
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,160
I'll call you back later.

452
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,530
Hello... Hello?

453
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:33,580
I knew it.
This is why I never came here.

454
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:38,890
I'm very much loved by both genders.

455
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:43,060
Everyone's staring at me,
aren't they?

456
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,830
You must be blind.

457
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:46,760
We haven't opened yet. It's empty.

458
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,370
No wonder.

459
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,830
I thought
the business wasn't going well.

460
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:02,440
- What is it?
- What?

461
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,080
You're forcing yourself to smile.

462
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:13,820
- What do you think?
- Is there anything simpler?

463
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,560
Simpler shoes look better
with that outfit.

464
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:17,389
I have no high heels.

465
00:34:17,850 --> 00:34:19,650
Mine are too flashy.

466
00:34:20,449 --> 00:34:23,560
Jang Mi. She probably has a lot.
Let's borrow a pair.

467
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,790
- Should we?
- Seo Yeon.

468
00:34:27,219 --> 00:34:28,239
Hey.

469
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,659
My dear Seo Yeon.

470
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:33,159
Won Jae.

471
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:35,330
Won Jae.

472
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:40,840
That's so pretty. What is this for?

473
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,139
Oh, this?

474
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:45,620
I'm going to meet
Kang Woo's mom and grandmother.

475
00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:50,350
Seo Yeon.

476
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:53,449
Are you happy?

477
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:55,850
You are, right?

478
00:34:57,330 --> 00:34:58,830
What's wrong?

479
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:02,500
That's enough. That is.

480
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:05,570
You're so pretty.

481
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:15,820
We look exactly alike.

482
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:18,340
We look so alike.

483
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:22,150
What's going on?

484
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:25,130
My goodness. You didn't hang up?

485
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:26,490
What's wrong with him?

486
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:30,090
I don't know.

487
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,100
Won Jae.

488
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:40,740
You weren't sleeping?

489
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:43,970
Are you okay? Is something wrong?

490
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:46,750
What do you mean? Nothing's wrong.

491
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:48,080
Are you sure?

492
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:53,690
I know that I'm a fool,

493
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,890
but I'll never do anything
that worries you.

494
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:02,560
Do you want me
to cook you something?

495
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,790
Can you? I'm famished.

496
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:08,290
Me too. See? You and I are so alike.

497
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,030
Eight will do, right?

498
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,240
5 for me, and 3 for you.

499
00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:34,350
What is it? Is it too weird?

500
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:37,220
No. It's pretty. It really is.

501
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:40,290
But aren't those high heels
uncomfortable?

502
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:41,390
Don't your feet hurt?

503
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:43,270
A bit, but I'm fine.

504
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,030
Are you nervous?

505
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:50,400
Yes.

506
00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:56,750
Then should we just leave?

507
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:58,990
I can tell my mom
that we're taking a rain check.

508
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:01,020
Don't.

509
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,120
Let's go.

510
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:12,130
Okay.

511
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,300
I knew it'd look good on you.

512
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:21,380
I have a keen eye for fashion.

513
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:23,110
Thank you.

514
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,170
How's the food?

515
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:29,570
It's good. It's so tasty.

516
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:33,020
Goodness, it's nice
to see you eat so well.

517
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:36,680
We need to eat to live. We do.

518
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,630
Mother, you're going
to get indigestion.

519
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:46,230
I hope you don't think...

520
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:49,470
that we're 100-percent supportive
of you two...

521
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,530
just because
we're having this meal together.

522
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:55,210
I just wanted
to have a meal together.

523
00:37:55,210 --> 00:37:56,640
That's all.

524
00:37:58,210 --> 00:37:59,250
Okay.

525
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:01,310
- Mom.
- Yes?

526
00:38:01,310 --> 00:38:02,620
What's your shoe size?

527
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:04,850
230mm. Why?

528
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:06,140
- 230mm?
- Yes.

529
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:08,360
You're wearing flat shoes today.

530
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,860
Could you switch shoes with her?

531
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:13,960
- What?
- You don't have a problem...

532
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,630
with wearing high heels.

533
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:17,630
But you see, she does.

534
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:20,970
Don't do this. Don't.

535
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:23,390
Why not? I'm so worried
about your feet...

536
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:26,110
that I can't eat anything right now.

537
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:31,570
So since your girlfriend's feet
are hurting, I should...

538
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:32,640
Yes.

539
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:37,940
And to think that I went through
all that pain just for you!

540
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:42,760
Let them be. Compared to what
my son does for you,

541
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,120
this is nothing.

542
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:48,320
- Mother!
- My goodness.

543
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:51,770
Mom, you'll change, right?

544
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:55,190
Hurry up. Come on.

545
00:38:55,470 --> 00:38:56,560
I'm sorry.

546
00:38:57,270 --> 00:38:58,340
I'm sorry.

547
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:00,640
This is so upsetting. My gosh.

548
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,530
Hurry up and switch them.

549
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,640
Let me see your heels.

550
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:17,120
They don't hurt. Not even one bit.

551
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:21,600
Of course, they do.
You've skinned them.

552
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:25,560
How am I to meet them again?

553
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,660
- What do you mean?
- I thought you graduated...

554
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:27,790
from a prestigious university
in the US.

555
00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:30,240
I thought you were extremely smart.
So why?

556
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:33,370
Why would you ask her
to change her shoes? Why?

557
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:36,530
What about that? You were hurting,
and it was bothering me.

558
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:38,640
I can't stand seeing you in pain.

559
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:43,120
I'm going to treat your grandmother
and mom well.

560
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:46,520
I will do so at all costs.

561
00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:53,520
No way. Kang Woo made all of it?

562
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:56,100
He might look a bit clumsy,
but he's pretty good.

563
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,820
I'll tell you how many orders
we received from abroad.

564
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:02,840
How much is that in all?

565
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:06,030
That's why I'm thinking
of buying a house.

566
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:07,030
No.

567
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:09,110
Why do you need a house now?

568
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:11,380
Don't think about wasting money.
You have to save up.

569
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:15,880
Goodness.
I love everything about you.

570
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:16,980
Whatever.

571
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:22,090
But why does Kang Woo
only design men's clothes?

572
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,280
No idea. The thought that he might
be a pervert crossed my mind,

573
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,630
I got scared
that he really might be,

574
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:27,960
so I didn't ask him in detail.

575
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,230
I see. He's a pervert.

Who is it?

578
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:21,210
I found you.

579
00:41:21,210 --> 00:41:24,250
Finally. I found you, wench.

580
00:41:25,410 --> 00:41:27,410
You need to find another agency.

581
00:41:27,410 --> 00:41:29,220
It took a long time to find me here.

582
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:32,090
Look at you. How dare you!

583
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:34,590
Stop it! Don't you dare touch me!

584
00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:36,520
I won't let you bully me now!

You... You must be out of your mind!

How will you stop me?

587
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,770
What can you do?

588
00:41:43,770 --> 00:41:46,340
I'll give up on my inheritance.

589
00:41:47,930 --> 00:41:50,300
- What?
- The inheritance from my dad.

590
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:52,570
I'll just give it
to my sisters and brothers.

591
00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:53,800
I can even do it tomorrow.

592
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:56,440
You crazy witch.

593
00:41:57,070 --> 00:41:59,180
Are you threatening me?

594

Yes.

595

Come to think of it,

00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:03,720
I'm his daughter,

597

but without me,
you will be nothing to my father.

598
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:19,530
I'll send you money
to this account every month.

599
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:21,670
You can have a stable retirement
with this money.

600
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:23,380
Or you can cut ties with me.

601
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,980
Am I still useless...

603
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:45,290
Has she lost her mind?

What's gotten into her?

605
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:53,060
Gosh, it startled me.
This is so annoying!

606

Do you still eat
a lot of candies these days?

607

- Pardon?
- Saet Byul called you...

608
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:29,840
Dr. Candy.

609
00:43:30,210 --> 00:43:32,640
"Mom, when is Dr. Candy coming?"

610
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:35,880
"I can smell strawberries
from Dr. Candy."

611

That's what she said.

612
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:41,520
Getting treated at the hospital
was hard.

613

But thanks to you,

614

Saet Byul was able to...

At times,

you need to bury some things.

00:47:09,350 --> 00:47:11,400
Shouldn't you at least have told me
in advance?

664
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:13,670
She didn't tell you?
I thought she did.

665
00:47:14,230 --> 00:47:16,860
Right. I'm sorry.

666
00:47:16,860 --> 00:47:18,630
I forgot to tell you that.

667
00:47:18,630 --> 00:47:20,940
It's okay. That happens.

668
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:24,740
Give that to me.

669
00:47:27,150 --> 00:47:29,480
Hey, you're favoring her too much.

670
00:47:29,810 --> 00:47:31,570
You knew that we were coming.

671
00:47:31,570 --> 00:47:32,780
Come on, you.

672
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:35,190
That's not true! I really forgot!

673
00:47:35,190 --> 00:47:36,780
You!

674
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:43,460
Do you really know
where that guy lives?

675
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:45,020
Of course. I know everything.

676
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Wait.

677
00:47:52,210 --> 00:47:54,360
You need to unlock it first
to open the door.

678
00:47:54,410 --> 00:47:55,480
Right.

679
00:48:01,250 --> 00:48:02,750
You have a license, right?

680
00:48:02,750 --> 00:48:05,310
Of course. I failed 10 times,
but I passed at the end.

681
00:48:05,690 --> 00:48:07,110
10 times?

682
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:15,700
Jang Mi,
are you sure you can do this?

683
00:48:16,050 --> 00:48:18,400
Yes, don't worry.
I'm good at everything.

684
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:20,170
As if!

685
00:48:21,470 --> 00:48:23,060
I'm ready. Here we go.

686
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:24,130
- Hold on!
- Let's go.

687
00:48:24,590 --> 00:48:26,710
You need to release
the parking brake first.

688
00:48:26,970 --> 00:48:29,240
Parking brake? Parking...

689
00:48:29,710 --> 00:48:30,710
Parking?

690
00:48:35,250 --> 00:48:36,650
Gosh, it's not raining.

691
00:48:36,650 --> 00:48:39,080
Why did you turn on
the windshield wipers?

692
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:40,540
Let's just take a cab.

693
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:43,220
Cab?

694
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:45,120
Or a bus!

695
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:48,120
You said that
you wanted to ride a bus.

696
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:49,820
Bus?

697
00:48:50,590 --> 00:48:51,970
Why would I go there?

698
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:53,670
Forget it if you don't want to.

699
00:48:54,670 --> 00:48:56,970
I'll just take Ho Dol with me.

700
00:48:58,030 --> 00:48:59,100
What?

701
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:00,830
Hello.

702
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:02,830
Hey, Ho Dol. Are you ready to go?

703
00:49:02,830 --> 00:49:03,830
Yes!

704
00:49:04,630 --> 00:49:05,840
Why are you going there?

705
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:08,040
Hi-Seven might come too!

706
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:09,270
Why don't you come too?

707
00:49:09,270 --> 00:49:11,270
No. He said he wouldn't go.

708
00:49:11,270 --> 00:49:15,190
So the two of us will go there
like a couple of good friends.

709
00:49:16,050 --> 00:49:17,050
Let's go, Ho Dol.

710
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:22,090
This is nice.

711
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:23,400
We bought a nice one.

712
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:38,750
Gosh, what's up with the mood?

713
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:42,480
Hello. I'm a top star,
Park Seok Min.

714
00:49:44,250 --> 00:49:45,580
Do you want an autograph?

715
00:49:57,260 --> 00:49:58,770
Do you want my autograph?

716
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:01,900
- Why?
- What?

717
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:03,900
It's me, Park Seok Min,
the top celebrity.

718
00:50:04,630 --> 00:50:07,240
I'm Baek Jang Mi.
Do you want my autograph?

719
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:08,330
What?

720
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:11,530
Jang Mi, let's grab
something to eat over there.

721
00:50:11,530 --> 00:50:13,480
- Okay. Sounds great.
- Let's go.

722
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:14,540
What?

723
00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:22,460
Yes, Won Seok.

724
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:25,430
What? Okay.

725
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:29,120
Where are you going?

726
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:30,850
Won Seok told me to come out.

727
00:50:31,850 --> 00:50:35,470
Oh, Won Seok told you to come out?
Okay. I'll come with you.

728
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:39,170
I thought it would be a lot of fun,
but it's a whole lot of awkwardness.

729
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:44,300
- Should I play some music?
- Okay.

730
00:50:54,690 --> 00:50:57,580
This is the warming up song!

731
00:50:58,160 --> 00:50:59,490
You.

732
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:03,460
You two were up to something
before we got here.

733
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:05,670
No, we didn't.

734
00:51:05,670 --> 00:51:07,360
- You.
- My gosh.

735
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:09,590
- You. Hey, you.
- Darn it.

736
00:51:09,590 --> 00:51:11,900
- You.
- Give it back!

737
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:13,710
- What's with you?
- Give it to me!

738
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:20,770
Hey! My gosh, man.

739
00:51:22,750 --> 00:51:25,610
- Don't touch that thing!
- It's gross. No one would.

740
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:31,260
Kang Woo.

741
00:51:38,670 --> 00:51:40,590
Hey, she's...

742
00:51:42,530 --> 00:51:43,670
Be quiet.

743
00:51:54,910 --> 00:51:57,340
I came in case
I might get to see you.

744
00:51:59,650 --> 00:52:00,650
Me too.

745
00:52:03,310 --> 00:52:06,730
Do you think we'll have a chance
once those two get married?

746
00:52:07,430 --> 00:52:09,660
Who knows how many years that'll be?

747
00:52:11,790 --> 00:52:14,500
Just a few years? That's nothing.

748
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:16,790
Right, it's not impossible.

749
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:34,880
- You're here.
- Yes, I'm here.

750
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:36,460
Why didn't you come in?

751
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:38,760
The vibe is really weird in there.

752
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:41,730
A little, isn't it?

753
00:52:46,620 --> 00:52:49,440
You're flying out tomorrow, right?

754
00:52:49,670 --> 00:52:50,670
Yes.

755
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:53,630
Have a safe trip, okay?

756
00:52:55,270 --> 00:52:56,300
Okay.

757
00:52:57,770 --> 00:52:59,150
Have a safe trip.

758
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:03,040
I get it.

759
00:53:05,490 --> 00:53:07,580
Have a safe trip, kid.

760
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:10,160
I said I get it.

761
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:15,500
You.

762
00:53:16,730 --> 00:53:18,160
I'm letting you off
because you're leaving tomorrow.

763
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:19,730
Thank you.

764
00:53:26,330 --> 00:53:27,710
Call me.

765
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:29,770
I'll see.

766
00:53:30,510 --> 00:53:31,680
I said call me.

767
00:53:32,210 --> 00:53:33,270
I said I'll see.

768
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:36,420
Just call me, will you?

769
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:50,960
[Seo Yeon, let's hang out!]

770
00:53:56,670 --> 00:54:00,300
[Three months later]

771
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:03,300
- Where's Won Seok?
- Out on a date.

772
00:54:03,830 --> 00:54:06,150
What? This early?

773
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:09,420
Man, late bloomers are scary.

774
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:10,750
I can't believe he's out this early.

775
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:13,080
I can't eat this anymore!

776
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:14,450
You little jerk.

777
00:54:14,450 --> 00:54:16,760
You should be grateful
for the food you get.

778
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:19,320
It's too much! I had this
every day for three months!

779
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:21,780
My poop smells like sweet potatoes.

780
00:54:22,350 --> 00:54:25,730
You're right. Tell Won Seok
to tell Ho Dol's father...

781
00:54:25,730 --> 00:54:28,430
that we had enough sweet potatoes,

782
00:54:28,430 --> 00:54:31,860
and that he can
stop sending these to us.

783
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:32,860
He did.

784
00:54:33,710 --> 00:54:34,740
He did?

785
00:54:35,060 --> 00:54:36,210
Twice.

786
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:39,840
Twice? That old man is
absolutely stubborn.

787
00:54:40,340 --> 00:54:42,010
Where are your manners?

788
00:54:42,450 --> 00:54:48,310
That old man must
really adore our Won Seok.

789
00:54:48,310 --> 00:54:49,610
We should be thankful.

790
00:54:51,190 --> 00:54:54,350
You should give some
to Mi Kyung and Jang Mi.

791
00:54:54,350 --> 00:54:55,960
I already gave them a box each.

792
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:58,520
Joo Hee also took some
to share with her teammates.

793
00:54:58,520 --> 00:54:59,670
Really?

794
00:55:00,470 --> 00:55:01,860
Great job.

795
00:55:03,270 --> 00:55:04,860
Why didn't you give out
two boxes each?

796
00:55:07,010 --> 00:55:09,710
Why are you two complaining
about how lucky we are?

797
00:55:10,130 --> 00:55:12,800
It must've been really straining
for him to grow these.

798
00:55:12,870 --> 00:55:15,540
Eat. Eat up. Okay?

799
00:55:17,870 --> 00:55:19,920
Really? What's going on?

800
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:22,110
No idea. He's really busy.

801
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:24,280
And he wouldn't let me
come into his studio.

802
00:55:25,310 --> 00:55:26,350
Really?

803
00:55:27,690 --> 00:55:29,660
Goodness, why are those here?

804
00:55:29,730 --> 00:55:31,700
I didn't want to leave it empty.

805
00:55:36,270 --> 00:55:38,440
So he hasn't heard
from Mr. Lee yet?

806
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:41,100
No, Kang Woo is worried too.

807
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:42,800
Is Ms. Joo Seo Yeon in here?

808
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:44,130
Yes.

809
00:55:48,710 --> 00:55:52,340
I was wondering if it was you,
and it really is you, Ms. Joo.

810
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:56,850
How's Mr. Lee Kang Woo doing?

811
00:55:57,960 --> 00:55:58,990
What?

812
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:02,230
You seem familiar.

813
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:06,400
Aren't you the guy
who picked up his phone?

814
00:56:06,820 --> 00:56:09,900
What? What do you mean?

815
00:56:11,590 --> 00:56:14,100
Please tell Mr. Lee that I said hi.

816
00:56:15,210 --> 00:56:17,740
Goodbye, then.

817
00:56:25,580 --> 00:56:27,150
What was that? Who sent you this?

818
00:56:27,150 --> 00:56:28,690
What? Right.

819
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:39,320
Kang Woo! Look at this!

820
00:56:43,470 --> 00:56:44,500
What?

821
00:57:08,460 --> 00:57:10,230
Hey, no! You can't.

822
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:14,500
Not yet.

823
00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:16,900
What have you been doing
for over three months?

824
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,400
You can't see it yet.

825
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:20,630
Okay, fine.

826
00:57:23,530 --> 00:57:26,100
Seo Yeon! Hey! Wait!

827
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:48,270
Yes, this is it.
This is the dress of my dreams!

828
00:57:48,270 --> 00:57:51,470
Thanks, Kang Woo! You're a genius.

829
00:58:02,070 --> 00:58:03,110
This is...

830
00:58:13,190 --> 00:58:14,430
Once I finish this,

831
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:16,660
why don't we...

832
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:20,400
soon get...

833
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:23,440
Yes.

834
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:30,300
I'm definitely going to do that
with you, Kang Woo.

835
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:34,450
I don't care what happens.

836
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:44,160
Seo Yeon.

837
00:58:45,220 --> 00:58:46,460
Don't let me go.

838
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:48,730
Okay.

839
00:58:50,090 --> 00:58:51,500
I'll never let you go.

840
00:59:00,030 --> 00:59:01,770
Make it look pretty.

841
00:59:01,770 --> 00:59:02,800
Okay.

842
00:59:05,630 --> 00:59:08,540
One cucumber on your face.
Right here.

843
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:10,570
Stay still.

844
00:59:13,250 --> 00:59:14,340
Isn't it good?

845
00:59:14,340 --> 00:59:17,280
Go away, pimples.

846
00:59:18,260 --> 00:59:19,850
- No!
- No, stop it!

847
00:59:21,490 --> 00:59:23,930
It's optimized
for the driver's experience...

848
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:30,130
The trunk is big enough
for a single woman to get around.

849
00:59:30,130 --> 00:59:33,060
As you can see there,
you can choose between...

850
00:59:33,170 --> 00:59:35,870
I felt like my heart was
opened wide...

851
00:59:35,870 --> 00:59:39,100
- while I was in that free space.
- What did you do?

852
00:59:40,270 --> 00:59:41,510
I've been there often as a kid.

853
00:59:41,510 --> 00:59:43,950
I went there recently,
and it was really great.

854
00:59:43,950 --> 00:59:45,950
I should have been there already.

855
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:49,780
Anyway, it was great.

856
00:59:49,780 --> 00:59:51,550
It was a new experience for me.

857
01:00:32,990 --> 01:00:36,590
We complete each other.

858
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:02,550
[Thank you for watching
Love With Flaws.]

859
01:02:02,550 --> 01:02:04,630
[We support everyone out there
who lives with their flaws.]
