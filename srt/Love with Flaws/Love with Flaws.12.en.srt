1
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:27,650
So Kang Woo,

2
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:31,020
- let's break up.
- Seo Yeon!

3
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:34,410
Seo Yeon.

4
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:36,980
What's wrong?

5
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:38,980
What is it?

6
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,120
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,140
I was wrong.

8
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:53,570
Don't say that, Seo Yeon.

9
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:54,960
Okay?

10
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,380
You have a guest with you.

11
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:10,450
Who are you?

12
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:11,850
Pardon?

13
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:16,090
Are you Kang Woo's girlfriend?

14
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,720
Yes, she's my girlfriend.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,610
Why? You are.

16
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,330
You're my woman.

17
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:39,320
Nice to meet you.

18
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:42,280
I'm Kang Woo's mom.

19
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,880
Hello, I'm Joo Seo Yeon.

20
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:52,630
Goodness, you're very pretty.

21
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,610
I see.

22
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:04,470
I was wondering
why she was like this.

23
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,380
You're the reason...

24
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:11,550
why Seo Yeon got scared.

25
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,990
No, it's not that.

26
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,380
No? You didn't meet her?

27
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:22,550
I didn't.

28
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:25,690
What's with you?

29
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:28,500
Why would I meet her?

30
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:31,270
Isn't this our first time
seeing each other?

31
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:33,570
Yes, it's my first time seeing you.

32
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,200
Liar.

33
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,810
- I'm serious!
- You met at the department store...

34
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:39,810
when you were with Min Hyuk.

35
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:44,180
Yes, what I mean is...

36
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:47,720
that it's my first time
seeing her as your mother.

37
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:55,250
This is great.

38
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:59,000
Seo Yeon was
just about to break up with me.

39
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:02,160
She said I'm too much for her
because I'm the grandson...

40
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:05,030
- of Shinhwa Food.
- What?

41
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:07,100
Mom, is it okay...

42
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:09,230
for me to date Seo Yeon?

43
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:13,280
You aren't that square, are you?

44
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,970
Of course, it's okay.

45
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,440
Don't worry.

46
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,120
Everything is all right
as long as you're healthy.

47
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,980
Nothing else matters.

48
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,430
Thank you.

49
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,500
What are you doing?

50
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,400
Why did you put me
in this awkward situation?

51
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:38,030
Are you getting mad at me?

52
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:41,160
I'm the one who's flustered.

53
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,100
- Kang Woo.
- This is enough for today.

54
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,500
I don't want to hear it anymore.

55
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:46,500
Go home.

56
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:31,910
I didn't know you'd talk about me
behind my back.

57
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:34,930
I wasn't doing that.
You don't need to worry.

58
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,659
Like you said, I'm going
to break up with him.

59
00:04:37,659 --> 00:04:39,630
Are you slow-witted or what?

60
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:43,460
If you break up with him
at this moment, he'll blame me.

61
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:45,800
- Didn't you see how he reacted?
- I can make him understand.

62
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,260
I said no. You can't break up
with him.

63
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:51,980
- What?
- Not this moment.

64
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,840
Do you want to make him hate me?

65
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,770
But I've already made up my mind
to break up with him.

66
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,140
You're so dense.

67
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:06,120
Just date him for a bit longer
and then end things...

68
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:09,860
Hold on.

69
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,630
What's wrong with my son?

70
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:15,000
I mean...

71
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,590
Why do you want to break up
with him?

72
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:20,170
It's obvious that
he's head over heels for you.

73
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:21,460
So why are you acting this way?

74
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,070
Well...

75
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,040
Like you've said,

76
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,610
I'm no match for Shinhwa Food.

77
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:32,250
That's for our family to decide.

78
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,990
So just keep seeing him for now.

79
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:37,510
- But...
- Just do that, will you?

80
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:39,820
Kang Woo is a nice boy.

81
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:43,520
He may seem coldhearted,
but he's actually very kind.

82
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,820
Yes, I know that.

83
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,930
All right, then. It's settled.

84
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:50,070
Then I'll understand that
you'll keep dating him.

85
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,890
I'll pay for this.

86
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:00,330
That's strange.

87
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,620
- Ms. Kim.
- My goodness!

88
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,920
- What are you doing?
- Well...

89
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:15,630
Have you seen Jang Mi's bag
that's about this big?

90
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,560
I'm sure I saw it somewhere.

91
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:23,890
Did you ever find anything strange
about her?

92
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:27,590
You did, didn't you?

93
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:29,460
Not really but...

94
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:35,180
I did see the money in that bag.

95
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:36,750
Money? How much?

96
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,920
It was full of 50-dollar bills.

97
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:56,190
Hey!

98
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:03,760
Where have you been all day?

99
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:06,700
What? Well, I've just been...

100
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:07,980
Have you been seeing Kang Woo?

101
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:10,980
- Yes.
- Were you the type...

102
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:13,770
who'd give her friend
the cold shoulder for a guy?

103
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:15,190
It's not like that.

104
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:18,250
Whatever. I'm going to sulk.
I'll keep my eyes on you.

105
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:19,920
Do you want me to take you home?

106
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,750
No, thanks.

107
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,610
The old her would've taken me home
even if I said no.

108
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:43,480
I hate you, Kang Woo!

109
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:58,020
It's that easy to let me go?

110
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,800
How? How's that possible?

111
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,390
How could you do that?

112
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:29,990
By the way,

113
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,690
how did Mom find out?

114
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,230
So you really have no idea.

115
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:36,370
What are you talking about?

116
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:38,830
You don't know even if
someone next to you is in pain...

117
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:40,830
or is about to die.

118
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:43,960
Don't tell me...

119
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:23,840
- Hey, you're home.
- What are you doing?

120
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:27,050
I wonder why
I've been living this way.

121
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,920
I didn't pay a single dime
for any of these.

122
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:30,980
Why have I been living this way?

123
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,760
You should've stopped me
and told me to snap out of it.

124
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,790
What's gotten into you?

125
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:37,560
I'm going to throw them all away.

126
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,190
I'm going to throw away everything
that I didn't buy.

127
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:47,270
This is a limited edition.
Should I just sell this?

128
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:49,310
I enjoyed wearing this as well.

129
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:52,540
This one would be a waste
to throw out.

130
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,680
No tutoring lesson today again?

131
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:03,320
Ho Dol texted me.

132
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,020
This dummy got outed
which is really unfortunate for him.

133
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:24,670
The receiver cannot be reached.
You will be directed to voicemail.

134
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:37,740
Last time, you were in front
of the school, and now, you're here?

135
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:41,530
Was it you?

136
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:44,560
Did you tell my family
about Seo Yeon?

137
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,490
She asked first.
You know I can't lie.

138
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,300
What a great excuse.

139
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,330
It was bound to happen anyway.

140
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:00,700
She would've found out
sooner or later.

141
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,440
Hey.

142
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,940
You're starting to disgust me.

143
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,580
I'm going to be
even more disgusting.

144
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:15,350
There's no point in being kind.

145
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:18,120
Being a kind guy and son...

146
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,690
didn't benefit me one bit.

147
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:25,190
You know very well about that.

148
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:35,310
Does Uncle call you often?

149
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:38,920
Are you suddenly acting
like an older brother?

150
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:44,420
Choose one role, will you?
You're confusing me.

151
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:49,060
If you're done, please leave.
I'm a bit busy.

152
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:52,160
Don't anticipate.

153
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:58,030
I will never...

154
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:00,690
fall down.

155
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:06,410
Go work now.

156
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:21,530
Why does Kang Woo keep showing up
to school?

157
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:22,790
I know.

158
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:24,290
It's so nerve-racking.

159
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:25,620
I'm starving.

160
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:51,440
The receiver cannot be reached.
You will be directed to voicemail.

161
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,610
What are you doing?

162
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:06,570
I'll protect you, Seo Yeon.

163
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:18,150
Do you feel suffocated...

164
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,940
in your office too?

165
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:28,190
Director Lee, someone from Baekga
Corporation has come to see you.

166
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:30,060
Baekga Corporation?

167
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:31,720
Mr. Baek Gook Hwa.

168
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,690
Who is she?

169
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,430
Why is he at my office?

170
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:38,800
Show the guest in.

171
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,870
I'm Baek Jang Mi.

172
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,070
Lee Kang Woo is your brother, right?

173
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,930
Your brother doesn't suit Seo Yeon.

174
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:10,220
She's too good for him.

175
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:15,460
So tell your brother
to give up on Seo Yeon.

176
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:17,460
- Excuse me.
- If you let him keep dating her,

177
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:20,440
I will talk to my dad and ask him to
stop his business with Shinhwa Food.

178
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:25,420
Baekga Corporation
is a good company.

179
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:27,820
And it is true that
we do have a business together.

180
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,240
Just because you stop the business,

181
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,390
it won't affect our company
that much.

182
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:37,720
It's quite the contrary.
If we stop the business,

183
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,160
it will be hard
on Baekga Corporation.

184
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,270
Can you handle that?

185
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:43,990
Sorry?

186
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:48,730
We've met before.
Do you not remember?

187
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:52,470
You're useless!

188
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,680
How could you beat your own child?

189
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:56,370
She's quite small-boned.

190
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:58,280
I'm pretty sure
you could've subdued her.

191
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:00,240
You should've hit her back.

192
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:08,760
No matter
how good of a person you are,

193
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,980
you cannot let
your brother date Seo Yeon.

194
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:12,300
Darn it.

195
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:13,950
They cannot date!

196
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,490
Excuse me, Ms. Baek!

197
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:20,140
Gosh.

198
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:25,870
Kang Woo must be dating
someone pretty impressive.

199
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:40,890
Are you hurt?

200
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,950
It's all right.

201
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:47,030
Don't move.

202
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:49,670
I don't have an ulterior motive
for patients.

203
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:54,090
- Does it hurt?
- Yes.

204
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:59,830
I fell in front of the students.
How embarrassing.

205
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,680
Thank you.

206
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,210
Were you distracted?

207
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:13,080
Is it because of Kang Woo?

208
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:16,160
That's how you got hurt, right?

209
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:19,490
- No, I was just...
- Kang Woo was here.

210
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:24,590
I got caught.
I told his mother about you.

211
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:27,960
I told her...

212
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,070
about Kang Woo and you.

213
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:33,940
- What?
- I meant it when I said...

214
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,840
that I wouldn't come
between you two.

215
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:39,870
But when I had the chance,
I ended up...

216
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,650
coming between you guys.

217
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:45,020
You're disappointed, right?

218
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:48,760
Yes, a bit.

219
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:54,660
The Mr. Lee I know
wouldn't do such a thing.

220
00:16:57,090 --> 00:16:58,220
This is odd.

221
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,490
You just started...

222
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,140
to see the real me.

223
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,280
I told you...

224
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,310
that I wasn't nice.

225
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:11,970
But...

226
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,690
why are you reconsidering...

227
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:18,980
dating Kang Woo?

228
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:21,930
Why does
his mother's visit matter to you?

229
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:25,619
Is that how much Kang Woo...

230
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:27,930
means to you?

231
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:33,200
It's...

232
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,830
none of your business.

233
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,170
Do I have a chance?

234
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:04,230
Look how skinny you got.

235
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,570
You're skinny, to begin with.

236
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,130
- Why are you here?
- Why are you trying...

237
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:10,630
so hard to go to your classes?

238
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:12,830
Taking a few days off
won't kill you.

239
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,400
People won't pay attention
to other people's business for long.

240
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:19,370
- So just hang in there until...
- If I miss my classes for a day,

241
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,780
my parents' hard work for a week
will go to waste.

242
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:25,560
They farmed day and night
to pay for my tuition.

243
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:27,820
I won't miss my classes
for something like this.

244
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,580
But your words
don't match your actions.

245
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,760
You didn't come
for your tutoring sessions.

246
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:33,800
Well, that's...

247
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,230
Besides, you made it sound like
it wasn't a big deal.

248
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,300
What's this?

249
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:42,900
I didn't apply sunscreen. So what?

250
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,110
Is that him?

251
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:02,990
Look at him.

252
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:04,380
Why did he come to class?

253
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,510
- Who is he?
- Who's that?

254
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:25,070
- I've never seen him before.
- Where's he going?

255
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:29,140
- No way.
- I can't believe it.

256
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:33,320
- What is it?
- Goodness.

257
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:38,060
- They must be gay.
- Is that his boyfriend?

258
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:47,800
Unbelievable.

259
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:53,570
Stop it.

260
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:55,670
You'll suffer too.

261
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:56,870
Me?

262
00:19:58,210 --> 00:19:59,520
Don't be a stranger.

263
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:06,080
They are looking at us...

264
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:07,960
because I'm handsome.

265
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,120
Don't overdo it.

266
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:50,620
Did I?

267
00:20:57,630 --> 00:20:59,170
Did you see that guy
put his arm around Ho Dol?

268
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:01,510
Did you see how that guy
looked at Ho Dol? Goodness.

269
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,950
- He even fixed Ho Don's hair.
- The hair thing.

270
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:06,110
- Gosh.
- This world is going crazy.

271
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:07,410
How could he do that?

272
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:19,700
Let go of me.

273
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:22,360
Should I do it here?

274
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:50,650
- Don't bully him.
- Why not?

275
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:53,760
- What does he mean to you?
- Nothing.

276
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:56,660
But if you keep bullying him,

277
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:59,570
I will feel very angry.

278
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:12,750
Why?

279
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:15,840
Why him, but not me?

280
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:22,180
What does he have that I don't have?

281
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,790
It's your bad temper.

282
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,060
You should meet someone...

283
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:28,820
who likes your nasty temper
and finds it special.

284
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:32,390
And I'm not that person.

285
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,850
Where did he go?

286
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,620
He didn't answer
any of my calls today.

287
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,230
I got you!

288
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:42,710
You.

289
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:46,900
Who in the world are you?

290
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:50,670
- Mi Kyung.
- I won't fall for your tears.

291
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:52,820
What is Seo Yeon going to do now?

292
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:56,550
What is she going to do?

293
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,420
Mi Kyung!

294
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:13,700
Who are you?

295
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,240
- What?
- Why are you calling out my name?

296
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:17,770
What's wrong?

297
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:22,480
Oh, I'm sorry. I was on a date
with Kang Woo. I'm sorry.

298
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,070
Is that so?
You were on a date with him?

299
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:27,950
What? Yes.

300
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,550
You brat!

301
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,850
Are we even friends?

302
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:37,180
Why do I have to hear about you
from Jang Mi?

303
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,360
Mi Kyung.

304
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:49,630
I wanted to tell you
hundreds and thousands of times.

305
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:51,860
Then why didn't you?

306
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:54,400
Because I knew you would be
more heartbroken than I am.

307
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,780
So you know.

308
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,640
But...

309
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:01,280
it's not because of Kang Woo.

310
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,750
So don't get any weird ideas.

311
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:05,680
You like him.

312
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,320
I don't feel confident.

313
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,560
Whenever I see him,
I keep wondering,

314
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:17,070
"What if I didn't ask my parents
to go out that night?"

315
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:21,040
"What if I didn't turn him down
when he asked me out?"

316
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:23,570
I don't think I can
stop thinking about that.

317
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:26,870
I'm afraid I'll end up thinking,

318
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,070
"What if Kang Woo
didn't ask me out..."

319
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,320
"at that time?"

320
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:38,180
I'm afraid I'll end up
blaming him...

321
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:39,580
for my guilty feelings.

322
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:46,120
And I can't keep seeing him
with this on my mind.

323
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,660
I can't do that to him.

324
00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:54,800
Can't you just tell him the truth?

325
00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:57,160
- No.
- Why not?

326
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,040
Kang Woo will never understand
if you break up without telling him.

327
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:03,140
It's not like you began to date him
without knowing his background.

328
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:07,070
I'd rather become a crazy woman
to put an end to this.

329
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:08,840
Exactly. Why should you do that?

330
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:12,460
Telling him the truth
might be the best way.

331
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,520
If Kang Woo finds out,

332
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,730
he'll feel bad although
he didn't do anything wrong.

333
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:19,530
He'll feel guilty.

334
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:24,470
Kang Woo is a nice kid,
so he'll definitely do that.

335
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,570
I'd rather have him
hate me and curse me...

336
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:32,600
than to leave him feeling guilty.

337
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:37,340
He can just say, "Seo Yeon was
a jerk. I shouldn't have dated her."

338
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:39,020
Hey.

339
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:42,140
Kang Woo can't know anything. Never.

340
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,250
I can't believe you're
worried about him at this point.

341
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,700
Worry about yourself, you fool.

342
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:11,550
So she didn't like you
because you were ugly,

343
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:13,670
then it was because you were
handsome, but she began to like you,

344
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:16,080
and now she hates you because
you're a grandson of a rich woman?

345
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:22,730
Come to think about it,
I'm the one who's at fault.

346
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:26,460
It's my fault
for looking like this...

347
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:29,620
and having a rich grandmother.

348
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:34,770
Why do you like her so much?

349
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,600
Because she's Seo Yeon.

350
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:40,540
That's all?

351
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:43,450
What more do you need?

352
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:49,020
It's not like you can stop living
as a rich woman's grandson.

353
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:50,340
Is that impossible?

354
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:52,610
I don't care
about my family business.

355
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:56,080
What if I don't need
anything else but her?

356
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:58,620
Do you think that's crazy?

357
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:10,360
Stop it, you idiot.
Enough is enough.

358
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:12,710
I can't believe you're complaining
about your privileges.

359
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:14,810
You jerk!

360
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:23,050
It sounds like she's very agitated,

361
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:27,460
so it's probably better
to give her some room to think.

362
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:31,730
You should stop seeing her
for a while.

363
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:36,320
But do you think
that's the only reason?

364
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:40,630
From what you told me
about that lady,

365
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:44,400
she doesn't seem like a type
who would be scared by your mother.

366
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:47,630
Are you saying
there's another reason?

367
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:51,670
Well, I mean that
it's a possibility.

368
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:11,890
There's another reason, isn't there?

369
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:17,510
She's not like that
only because of my aunt.

370
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:21,830
There has to be another reason.

371
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:25,350
Are you quick-witted
because you're smart?

372
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,850
Or do you just like her a lot?

373
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:31,250
I'm guessing both.

374
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:35,360
But you're also
a grandson of Shinhwa Food.

375
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,730
You and Kang Woo are
in similar situations.

376
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:41,360
Would your parents
easily accept Seo Yeon as she is?

377
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:45,660
I'm practically disowned.

378
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:49,090
- What?
- I gave up on my parents.

379
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:54,630
That didn't make any sense.

380
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:58,080
I guess the med school guy
isn't good at Korean.

381
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:02,910
Hey! You!

382
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,680
This way.

383
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,880
The track team room is
down this way, okay?

384
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,050
What? Okay.

385
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:16,520
Goodness, she might collapse soon.

386
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:23,130
[The moment you want to give up
is when you must start again.]

387
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:41,580
[We have the duty
to be eaten by Seo Yeon!]

388
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:44,760
We have the duty
to be eaten by Seo Yeon!

389
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:46,850
What a weird guy.

390
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:13,980
I think she got a hold on me.

391
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:17,530
It's Joo Seo Yeon.

392
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:20,600
When I came back to my senses,

393
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:23,000
I found myself begging her...

394
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:25,190
to keep dating Kang Woo.

395
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:27,970
She definitely has a hold on you.

396
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:31,100
- Does she look all right?
- What?

397
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:34,480
I mean, you said
Kang Woo likes her so much.

398
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:37,200
I was wondering
what's so special about her.

399
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,200
- Mother!
- Goodness.

400
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,750
What's special about her?

401
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:43,690
No, I...
Hey, you haven't even called.

402
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:48,160
I'm the grandson here, aren't I?

403
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,350
The grandson of Shinhwa Food.

404
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,190
You... You must be hungry.

405
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:58,600
I'll get you some food.
Give me a second.

406
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,660
I'll...

407
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:01,940
What? Goodness.

408
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:09,410
You must've been starving.

409
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:11,600
Shinhwa Food's side dishes...

410
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:14,720
are really good.

411
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:17,910
Goodness.

412
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:27,560
Hey.

413
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:33,260
Are you okay?

414
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:35,790
Are you on my side?

415
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,570
- No.
- Gosh.

416
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:38,730
Hey.

417
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:44,200
I have no choice but to be
on Mom's side because I love her.

418
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:48,250
But hang in there.

419
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:52,640
How did you give up?

420
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,450
Drawing.

421
00:32:57,950 --> 00:32:59,260
I didn't.

422
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,690
I just buried it in my heart.

423
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:05,820
It was for Mom and Grandma.

424
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,190
Do I need to do the same?

425
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:09,470
Can you?

426
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,200
No.

427
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:14,500
I can't.

428
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,800
That's why you need
to hang in there.

429
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:20,170
By the way,

430
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:22,740
look tidier, will you?

431
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:25,410
How could a designer
be dressed like that?

432
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:39,330
"Designer"? He found out?

433
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,930
It's all ruined.

434
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,360
How did he find out?

435
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:50,670
Did Hyun Soo tell him?
That can't be.

436
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:54,670
Yes. I sent the money.

437
00:33:54,850 --> 00:33:57,020
Use that for now.

438
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:08,530
"Money"?
Where did she get the money?

439
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:12,100
What does she do?

440
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:17,060
Joo Hee? Look at you.

441
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:18,500
It can't be.

442
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:21,100
That's impossible.

443
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:31,610
Of course, it's possible!
She worked at a wine bar before!

444
00:34:31,949 --> 00:34:33,090
Darn it.

445
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:36,310
Seo Yeon!

446
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:38,679
My gosh. Don't you know
how to knock?

447
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:40,960
- I'm sorry. Are you busy?
- Yes.

448
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,400
- A lot?
- Why?

449
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:46,060
It seems like he's in a rush.
I'll come by later.

450
00:34:46,929 --> 00:34:48,699
Sit down. Close that.

451
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:55,909
Jang Mi, do you have anything
to tell me?

452
00:34:58,350 --> 00:35:01,370
Do you really have neither a home
nor a family?

453
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:07,890
I'm sorry to say this,

454
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:11,550
but I'd like you to leave.

455
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:14,400
I do.

456
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,730
I do have a family.

457
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:22,840
But...

458
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,710
I'm not a part of it.

459
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:30,170
- What?
- I'm just an asset.

460
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:33,540
I'm an asset that needs to be sold
at a high price.

461
00:35:35,410 --> 00:35:36,520
What do you mean?

462
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:42,250
Thank you for everything
you've done for me.

463
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,530
I've inconvenienced you too much.

464
00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:55,970
That's fine.

465
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:05,650
You don't need to hurry.
You can take your time and move out.

466
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:08,850
However,

467
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:11,790
promise me you'll never meddle
in our family's business.

468
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:26,030
By the way, Lee Kang Woo is...

469
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:30,340
Hey, didn't we just make a promise?

470
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:32,300
He's been waiting outside
for some time now.

471
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:33,300
What?

472
00:36:34,210 --> 00:36:37,000
Why didn't you tell me this sooner?

473
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,410
Oh, no.

474
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:47,050
[Seo Yeon, let's hang out!]

475
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,200
Hey.

476
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:57,420
What's your deal?
Why haven't you been picking up?

477
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,860
Why aren't you avoiding me now?
Why are you here?

478
00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:02,990
I missed you.

479
00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:07,580
You still have the same expression.

480
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,000
I shouldn't have come.

481
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:18,910
Kang Woo.

482
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,330
Kang Woo!

483
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:40,370
Are you serious?

484
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:43,230
I avoided you because I didn't want
to hear what you had to say...

485
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:44,810
since it was obvious.

486
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:49,240
Avoiding you was the only way
for me not to hear that.

487
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:54,650
That was...

488
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,620
the only thing I could do.

489
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:00,060
Kang Woo.

490
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:02,250
So move aside.

491
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,390
Fine, then. I'll leave this here.

492
00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:11,840
Fine.

493
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:15,230
I'll move.

494
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,550
Why does he look so haggard?

495
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:02,110
[Ms. Lee Kang Hee]

496
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:10,060
[Ms. Lee Kang Hee]

497
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:15,570
The receiver cannot be reached.
You will be directed to voicemail.

498
00:39:17,210 --> 00:39:18,730
Did something happen to him?

499
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:31,610
I must be insane to come
all the way here.

500
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:35,190
[Seo Yeon, let's hang out!]

501
00:39:35,850 --> 00:39:37,350
That's interesting.

502
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:58,450
How did you know where I live?

503
00:39:58,450 --> 00:40:00,480
I told you.
I have your personal information.

504
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:04,820
You don't seem to be that busy.

505
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:12,690
Be quiet!

506
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:15,350
What are you doing back there?

507
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:19,730
Mr. Joo, stop stressing the cat out
and come here.

508
00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:37,180
You look the same as
when you drove the RC car before.

509
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:39,480
I was dressed well that day.

510
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,780
Why did you screen my calls?

511
00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:44,120
- I wasn't.
- You weren't picking up on purpose.

512
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:46,120
What's wrong?

513
00:40:47,090 --> 00:40:48,600
I've wasted away.

514
00:40:49,830 --> 00:40:51,990
I'm not elegant and beautiful
like you.

515
00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:54,840
I've been leeching off of women.

516
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:55,890
I know that.

517
00:40:56,530 --> 00:40:59,100
I knew you approached me
with such intentions.

518
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:01,310
Yes, that's who I am.

519
00:41:01,310 --> 00:41:04,080
That's why it irritates me
to be next to you.

520
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:08,580
Did I ask for too much
when making our deal?

521
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:10,920
- If I did...
- That's not what I'm talking about.

522
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:17,380
Fine. Let's end our deal.

523
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:21,060
I don't want to use you
to get money anymore.

524
00:41:22,490 --> 00:41:23,520
Goodbye.

525
00:41:34,270 --> 00:41:35,840
The receiver cannot be reached.

526
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:39,480
Kang Woo, that punk,
neither showed up for the meeting...

527
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,820
nor is answering my calls.

528
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:47,320
Who's the boss? Me or him?

529
00:41:49,850 --> 00:41:51,190
What is this smell?

530
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,650
What is this?

531
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:01,340
Hey.

532
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:04,070
Did you eat that
while using the toilet?

533
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:05,310
Why are you here?

534
00:42:05,310 --> 00:42:06,530
Did you forget
we have a meeting today?

535
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,080
Right. I'm sorry.

536
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,680
I've been busy.

537
00:42:11,210 --> 00:42:12,580
Busy?

538
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:14,080
I see. Doing what?

539
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:16,180
Eating and pooping?

540
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:17,720
I prepared all the materials.

541
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:18,820
I'll bring them to you.

542
00:42:22,350 --> 00:42:24,020
Hey. Hey!

543
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:25,930
Are you okay? Hey.

544
00:42:25,930 --> 00:42:27,750
Get up. Let me see.

545
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:29,990
Hey, you're bleeding!

546
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,500
What's wrong with him this time?

547
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:47,610
You startled me!

548
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,090
I guess Kang Woo meets with you.

549
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:00,560
What?

550
00:43:01,430 --> 00:43:03,060
Is he home right now?

551
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:04,890
Yes. Do you want to go in?

552
00:43:04,890 --> 00:43:07,230
No. Next time.

553
00:43:07,390 --> 00:43:08,630
Not today.

554
00:43:14,210 --> 00:43:15,600
- What are you doing here?
- What?

555
00:43:16,310 --> 00:43:19,310
I'm just going to stay here
for a bit.

556
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,820
Don't mind me. Go on.

557
00:43:22,770 --> 00:43:23,770
Okay.

558
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:39,020
Yes.

559
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:41,600
Seo Yeon is in front of your house.

560
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:43,800
What? Don't open the door for her.

561
00:43:43,990 --> 00:43:45,500
I'll kill you if you do!

562
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:46,900
- Okay.
- I'll kill you!

563
00:43:47,810 --> 00:43:49,180
What is wrong with this guy?

564
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:52,500
What on earth is going on here?

565
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:06,380
I avoided you...

566
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:08,100
because I didn't want
to hear what you had to say...

567
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:09,650
since it was obvious.

568
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:14,130
Avoiding you was the only way
for me not to hear that.

569
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:16,230
That was...

570
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,230
the only thing I could do.

571
00:44:33,690 --> 00:44:35,380
I begged her so desperately.

572
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:37,250
But she came here again?

573
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:43,230
So she won't let this go, will she?

574
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:51,210
I suddenly realized it.

575
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:53,130
Your place and my place.

576
00:44:53,210 --> 00:44:54,630
So Kang Woo,

577
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:56,810
let's break up.

578
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:55,970
Go home.

579
00:45:57,470 --> 00:45:59,340
I won't come out
even if you wait for me.

580
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:31,830
Just today.

581
00:46:37,650 --> 00:46:39,540
Let me just delay this today.

582
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:49,920
Just for today,

583
00:46:51,190 --> 00:46:53,160
I'll be a shameless daughter.

584
00:46:54,230 --> 00:46:55,290
I'm sorry.

585
00:47:03,470 --> 00:47:04,500
You will...

586
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:07,830
only give me a day,

587
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:10,440
Seo Yeon?

588
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:58,690
But do you think
that's the only reason?

589
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:01,090
Are you saying
there's another reason?

590
00:48:01,090 --> 00:48:03,930
Well, I mean that
it's a possibility.

591
00:48:08,170 --> 00:48:09,230
Another reason?

592
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:12,110
So she's a teacher here.

593
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:13,730
What is she like?

594
00:48:14,830 --> 00:48:16,030
She's really nice...

595
00:48:17,180 --> 00:48:18,540
to the point
that I want to date her.

596
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:19,840
Really?

597
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:23,920
What good will that do
when she has a messy family history?

598
00:48:25,190 --> 00:48:27,480
She lost her parents early
in her life and has half brothers.

599
00:48:27,810 --> 00:48:29,920
Things aren't looking great
even if half of that was true.

600
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:32,080
What do you mean?

601
00:48:32,390 --> 00:48:33,860
You didn't know.

602
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:35,400
Right.

603
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:39,130
There's no need for you to know
teachers' family history.

604
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:40,520
Does Kang Woo know that too?

605
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:41,870
Probably.

606
00:48:42,790 --> 00:48:44,440
Well, that won't make
a difference for him.

607
00:48:45,710 --> 00:48:48,680
Can you comfort Kang Woo for me?

608
00:48:48,910 --> 00:48:51,680
I'm so worried
that he might cause trouble.

609
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:55,680
- Okay.
- Okay.

610
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:59,920
- Thank you.
- Bye, Uncle.

611
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:02,050
No need to walk me out.
Have a good day.

612
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:11,170
She lost her parents early
in her life and has half brothers.

613
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:13,630
Things aren't looking great
even if half of that was true.

614
00:49:29,950 --> 00:49:31,390
How's your ankle?

615
00:49:31,740 --> 00:49:32,980
It's all right.

616
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:36,360
Chief Director Lee.

617
00:49:38,190 --> 00:49:40,430
I hope
you would stop visiting me here.

618
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:44,520
- Why?
- Other teachers will find it odd...

619
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:46,990
when they see you in my office.

620
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:49,490
- So...
- I took this position to do that,

621
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:51,030
so others will know.

622
00:49:53,470 --> 00:49:55,270
I want other teachers
to figure out...

623
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:57,410
that I like you.

624
00:50:01,770 --> 00:50:02,980
It will rain later.

625
00:50:02,980 --> 00:50:04,510
I assumed
you didn't have an umbrella.

626
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:12,020
When I was in school,

627
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:13,280
and when it suddenly
started to rain,

628
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:15,860
my friends' parents came to school
with an umbrella.

629
00:50:16,790 --> 00:50:18,520
I was really jealous of that...

630
00:50:19,590 --> 00:50:22,030
because my parents
never did that for me.

631
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:26,940
Was there a time when you were
jealous of your friends...

632
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:30,410
for their parents who came
to school with an umbrella?

633
00:50:38,450 --> 00:50:39,740
I'll come back.

634
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:03,110
Why is Mom calling me at this hour?

635
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:06,210
Who...

636
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:10,980
Why are you here?

637
00:51:11,580 --> 00:51:13,920
Oh, right. Ms. Kim, you have...

638
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:17,360
a student named Lee Kang Wook.
He's Kang Wook's brother.

639
00:51:17,620 --> 00:51:20,460
He said he needed to talk to you
about his younger brother,

640
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:22,160
Lee Kang Wook.

641
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:23,630
Lee Kang Wook?

642
00:51:23,790 --> 00:51:25,790
I'm sure you know my brother,
Kang Wook.

643
00:51:25,790 --> 00:51:28,700
The tall guy
with flour-colored skin, you know.

644
00:51:38,410 --> 00:51:39,540
Let me use the restroom.

645
00:51:40,540 --> 00:51:41,540
Follow me.

646
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:44,920
Actually, I had to use
the restroom too.

647
00:51:49,810 --> 00:51:51,010
Hold on.

648
00:51:51,430 --> 00:51:54,550
Was there a student named
Lee Kang Wook in her class?

649
00:51:54,550 --> 00:51:57,750
I'm not sure. Given how his name
doesn't ring a bell,

650
00:51:58,590 --> 00:52:00,020
he must get low grades.

651
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:03,590
I see! Yes, you're right. That's it.

652
00:52:03,590 --> 00:52:06,410
That's why I don't remember.
I kept wondering.

653
00:52:10,140 --> 00:52:11,650
Man, the weather looks great.

654
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:15,310
Are you insane?
How dare you come here?

655
00:52:15,310 --> 00:52:16,420
Go.

656
00:52:19,810 --> 00:52:21,750
- What's this?
- Kang Woo is bleeding...

657
00:52:21,750 --> 00:52:22,920
to death.

658
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:25,020
Did he get into an accident?

659
00:52:25,750 --> 00:52:27,080
He's bleeding from his heart.

660
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:35,640
Isn't it because of Seo Yeon?

661
00:52:36,030 --> 00:52:37,330
None of your business.

662
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:40,170
Of course, it's my business.
He's obstructing my work!

663
00:52:40,170 --> 00:52:41,640
- What is it?
- None of your business.

664
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:43,880
I'm sure they'll figure it out.
You need to leave.

665
00:52:45,410 --> 00:52:47,380
Mom, I'm busy. I'll call you back...

666
00:52:49,380 --> 00:52:52,480
What's wrong?
Stop crying and tell me.

667
00:52:54,890 --> 00:52:57,120
Okay. All right.
Let's hang up for now.

668
00:52:59,550 --> 00:53:00,660
What's going on?

669
00:53:01,460 --> 00:53:03,160
Can you give me a ride
to the bus terminal?

670
00:53:03,820 --> 00:53:05,490
Sure. Let's go.

671
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:20,950
Punch in your address.

672
00:53:20,950 --> 00:53:22,680
It's okay. Just to the bus terminal.

673
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:29,390
Seo Yeon probably knows.
She's still here, isn't she?

674
00:53:30,010 --> 00:53:32,820
Things are complicated enough
for her. I don't want to add to it.

675
00:53:32,890 --> 00:53:33,980
Punch it in.

676
00:53:37,550 --> 00:53:38,790
Don't ask me anything.

677
00:53:38,790 --> 00:53:40,730
The navigation has begun.

678
00:54:12,490 --> 00:54:13,760
Your hands are cold.

679
00:54:22,730 --> 00:54:24,910
Mom, I'm on my way.

680
00:54:26,740 --> 00:54:28,920
Calm down. I'm sure it'll be fine.

681
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:33,540
Mom, please!
You aren't going to die.

682
00:54:34,540 --> 00:54:36,580
Health technology has developed
beyond your imagination.

683
00:54:36,580 --> 00:54:38,960
You can receive an in-depth
examination and get operated.

684
00:54:39,130 --> 00:54:40,660
Stop worrying and hang up.

685
00:54:52,830 --> 00:54:56,940
I'm going to die after Mom
if she dies.

686
00:54:57,180 --> 00:55:00,450
Hey, how can you say
something so scary?

687
00:55:01,270 --> 00:55:02,720
Stop crying.

688
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:05,340
Come on, stop crying.

689
00:55:06,980 --> 00:55:08,190
Stop crying.

690
00:55:11,430 --> 00:55:12,730
Stop crying.

691

[Joo Seo Yeon]

692
00:55:34,650 --> 00:55:36,650
Your call cannot be connected.
Please leave your message...

693
00:55:47,230 --> 00:55:49,520
Come home.
I'll listen to what you have to say.

694
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:55,870
I can do it.

695
00:55:58,140 --> 00:55:59,440
I can do it.

696
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:23,290
Kang Woo.

697
00:56:27,490 --> 00:56:28,790
What's with your lips?

698
00:56:30,670 --> 00:56:32,140
I don't understand.

699
00:56:32,410 --> 00:56:34,800
I don't think I can understand
no matter what you say.

700
00:56:37,230 --> 00:56:38,610
Is that really the reason?

701
00:56:39,340 --> 00:56:40,980
Because of my affiliation
with Shinhwa Food?

702
00:56:42,270 --> 00:56:43,920
If that's the reason,
I'll take care of it.

703
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:46,010
Why do you get scared
and give up on me?

704
00:56:46,890 --> 00:56:48,190
How can you give up that easily...

705
00:56:48,190 --> 00:56:50,660
There is another reason.

706
00:56:55,730 --> 00:56:57,050
What?

707
00:56:59,730 --> 00:57:01,170
What is it?

708
00:57:01,970 --> 00:57:03,030
Kang Woo.

709
00:57:03,030 --> 00:57:04,440
What is it?

710
00:57:08,570 --> 00:57:10,030
I don't love you.

711
00:57:14,770 --> 00:57:16,150
That's the reason.

712
00:57:38,910 --> 00:57:40,110
You called me "my dear Kang Woo".

713
00:57:42,330 --> 00:57:44,300
You called me "my dear Kang Woo".

714
00:57:50,450 --> 00:57:53,280
If you were going to be like this,
why did you address me like that?

715
00:57:54,890 --> 00:57:55,960
Move.

716
00:57:56,050 --> 00:57:58,730
You're horrible.
You're really horrible,

717
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:02,250
but I can't even hate you.

718
00:58:03,090 --> 00:58:05,170
I can never hate you.

719
00:58:06,370 --> 00:58:07,630
I said, move.

720
00:58:09,170 --> 00:58:11,910
Okay. I understand.

721
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:17,830
Just...

722
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:20,910
toy me around and abandon me.

723
00:58:23,220 --> 00:58:24,340
Is that...

724
00:58:25,740 --> 00:58:26,980
impossible too?

725
00:58:32,820 --> 00:58:34,390
Get a hold of yourself, Kang Woo.

726
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:36,430
You sound insane.

727
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:13,460
You're probably caught in the rain,

728
01:00:15,130 --> 01:00:16,230
Seo Yeon.

729
01:00:39,740 --> 01:00:41,150
I told you it'll be raining.

730
01:00:43,580 --> 01:00:44,720
I came for you.

731
01:00:46,050 --> 01:00:47,080
I like...

732
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:50,660
Kang Woo.

733
01:00:52,230 --> 01:00:53,260
I know.

734
01:00:54,630 --> 01:00:56,640
I'll keep liking him by myself.

735
01:00:58,800 --> 01:00:59,910
I've been...

736
01:01:01,530 --> 01:01:02,980
liking you all alone too.

737
01:01:09,340 --> 01:01:11,270
You're a really weird guy.

738

[Love With Flaws]

739
01:02:01,430 --> 01:02:03,260
Seo Yeon, you can't be crying.

740
01:02:03,260 --> 01:02:05,140
Please don't cut me off with him.
I ask of you.

741
01:02:05,140 --> 01:02:06,830
- Why are you doing this?
- Do you really have no idea?

742
01:02:06,830 --> 01:02:08,140
Why do you think I'm doing this?

743
01:02:08,140 --> 01:02:09,880
You work at a bar now?

744
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:11,480
Do you think you mean something
because we live together?

745
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:13,610
- They live together?
- Will you end it with Seo Yeon?

746
01:02:13,610 --> 01:02:16,220
Should I just tell him
and get killed by her?

747
01:02:16,220 --> 01:02:17,720
Was it really because of me?

748
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:18,720
Why would that happen to Kang Woo?

749
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:20,740
There was a car accident.
An accident.

750
01:02:20,740 --> 01:02:21,960
I'm sorry.

751
