2
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:28,430
My pride.

3
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:32,390
This really kills my pride, but...

4
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:36,830
Yes, it can happen.

5
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:39,560
We can try it out.
If it doesn't seem to work,

6
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,570
we can stop...

7
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:43,430
I think I'm going to die...

8
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:46,410
of...

9
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:48,680
happiness.

10
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:57,080
I'll be good to you.

11
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:59,990
Oh, okay.

12
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:02,100
I'll be good to you too.

13
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,370
Why?

14
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,700
Don't be so cute.

15
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,759
I'm sorry. I went a bit overboard.

16
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:47,840
I was too happy.

17
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:51,700
- I'm glad you know.
- Yes.

18
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:54,450
Wait here. I'll take you home.

19
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:03,010
Is this a good decision?

20
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,560
Right. What are friends for?

21
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,949
We need to help each other out.

22
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:25,340
He's more muscular than I thought.

23
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,370
He must work out a lot.

24
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:31,810
Are you insane?

25
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:34,880
Why did you feel his body?

26
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,060
Darn you.

27
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:37,120
What?

28
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:38,990
What did you say?

29
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,650
Oh, nothing.

30
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,120
Let's go.

[Episode 6]

32
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:58,900
You still live here.

33
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,470
What?

34
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:03,310
I've been here before.

35
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,430
Who are you?

36
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:28,340
Are you Seo Yeon's friend?

37
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:30,900
Yes.

38
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,150
Well...

39
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,150
Goodbye.

40
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,150
Oh, dear.

41
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:45,220
Are you okay?

42
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:46,680
Yes.

43
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:51,500
Men need to be...

44
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:55,630
always ready to protect
the ones they love.

45
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:58,130
That's why you need...

46
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:01,710
to make sure your shoelaces
are always tied firmly.

47
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:08,810
There. They won't come undone now.

48
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:10,440
He said that?

49
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,750
Yes. Thanks to him,

50
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,780
my shoelaces are always tied firmly.

51
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,750
See?

52
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,589
Me too. He taught me.

53
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,220
Does he still live here with you?

54
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,660
I'll just say hello next time.

55
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:34,870
What is it?

56
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:37,500
Well... You see...

57
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:44,909
Hey, you!

58
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,650
- "You"?
- Why are you here?

59
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,550
- Do you allow him into your house?
- What?

60
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:53,350
No! I won't allow you
to meet this scumbag!

61
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:54,720
"This scumbag"?

62
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,260
Do you know Won Seok?

63
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:58,790
"Won Seok"?

64
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:02,270
Seo Yeon, how could you
call him by his name?

65
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:04,230
No, he's my older brother.

66
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:05,570
"Older brother"?

67
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:09,940
Don't lie. You two don't look alike.

68
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:11,710
- You little scumbag.
- How dare you touch me?

69
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:13,100
Why is it so noisy outside?

70
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,220
Who are you, you scumbag?

71
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,280
- What? Who are you?
- Why are you coming out from there?

72
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,540
- Answer me, you scumbag!
- Won Jae!

73
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:18,910
- "Scumbag"?
- Why are you coming out from there?

74
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:21,280
- What did you call me?
- You know him too?

75
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,990
Is he your guy friend or something?

76
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:38,010
What? Yes. We went
to the same middle school...

77
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:39,070
I'm her boyfriend!

78
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:43,530
- Sir.
- "Boyfriend"?

79
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:47,040
That's absurd.

80
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:53,110
Don't you hate
all good-looking guys?

81
00:05:53,409 --> 00:05:56,520
It's getting late.
You should go home.

82
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,830
- Hurry up and go. You're late.
- Okay.

83
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:01,530
I'll come back next time
and officially introduce myself.

84
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:03,050
I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

85
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:05,400
- Let's go.
- Okay.

86
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:09,790
Bye.

87
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:12,160
Okay. Bye.

88
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,320
He's definitely not your style.

89
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:27,190
I'm just seeing him.

90
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:28,350
What does he do?

91
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:32,650
Let's take it one step at a time.

92
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:37,700
Gosh, I'm so tired.

93
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:40,200
My shoulders are stiff. Goodness.

94
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:44,270
Something's fishy, right?
What do you think it is?

95
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:53,210
So they were her older brothers,
not just guys?

96
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,170
My gosh! You jerk!

97
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:59,820
You beat me to a pulp
and didn't even check on me.

98
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:03,220
Was our friendship this weak?

99
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,390
Yes, so get lost.

100
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:07,460
Forget it. I came to clear up
on something.

101
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:10,530
Do you really like Seo Yeon?

102
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:14,400
Why? Why her among
all the pretty girls...

103
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,900
She's pretty.

104
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:18,070
Eye doctor.

105
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:22,080
I know a really skilled eye doctor.

106
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,900
What are you doing?

107
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:26,380
There's something wrong
with your eyes.

108
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:28,320
This isn't plausible.

109
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,820
Moreover, she's not normal.

110
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,320
- What?
- She said she liked me.

111
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,040
She shouldn't like me. She's weird.

112
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,909
- If you do...
- What are you saying?

113
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:39,980
Anyway, don't meet her ever again.

114
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:42,130
I'll talk to her.

115
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:44,130
It's too late.
She has no feelings left for you,

116
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,330
so don't worry.

117
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:49,730
Really? Sure, right.

118
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:52,070
Right. That's a relief.

119
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:54,970
She agreed to date me.

120
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,340
- What?
- What?

121
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:02,650
Say that again.
You're doing what with Kang Woo?

122
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:05,540
Imagine how desperate
he must've been.

123
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:08,720
So you'll pretend
to be his girlfriend...

124
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,130
until he can find a way
for them to be together?

125
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:12,980
So that he wouldn't need to go
on blind dates anymore?

126
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:15,960
Well, to put it simply, yes.

127
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:20,130
I wouldn't have gone this far
had I not seen them together.

128
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:23,360
But since I've spotted them,
I feel bad about not helping.

129
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:29,880
We're friends.

130
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:32,080
You've gone insane.

131
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,470
They must take you for a pushover.

132
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:36,610
If not, how could they ask you
for such an obnoxious...

133
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,390
So what will you do with him?

134
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,960
Since his family needs to know
that he has a girlfriend,

135
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:46,420
I should upload photos of us
and such, right?

136
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,550
Kang Woo!

137
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:12,690
All right. Let's go.

138
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:22,830
She's more straightforward
than I thought.

139
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:34,770
Mi Kyung told me that
this place is popular these days.

140
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:36,310
She said all couples
should visit here.

141
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:37,870
- Really?
- It's pretty.

142
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:39,840
Come here. Here.

143
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:41,550
- All right.
- What?

144
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,950
1, 2, 3.

145
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:47,190
It'll look even more real
to take a photo here.

146
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:56,250
Hey, stay still. If we're going
to do this, we need to do well.

147
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:21,110
Here.

148
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,720
Thanks. You didn't have
to treat me so nicely.

149
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:29,020
Just say the word, and I'll buy you
anything you want to eat.

150
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:32,120
Kang Woo, I'm impressed.

151
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:41,540
This was nice. Let's keep doing
a good job.

152
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:42,770
You should go. It's getting late.

153
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,310
Right. Okay.

154
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:48,510
That was nice.

155
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:54,590
Right.

156
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:15,080
She's so unpredictable.

157
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,930
Who is she?

158
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:37,060
He's better than
an actual boyfriend.

159
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,890
I can't believe I received
such an expensive cake.

160
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:43,670
My gosh.

161
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,310
Is it your turn tonight?

162
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:54,640
Won Jae said he'd be late.

163
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,320
What was that?

164
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,930
This? It's a really expensive cake.

165
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:06,930
Not that one.

166
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,830
The guy who gave you the cake.

167
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:10,750
Who's he?

168
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:15,590
What do you think?
I told you he was my boyfriend.

169
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:31,640
Come on!

170
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:35,160
You can never fall for
a good-looking guy like him.

171
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,460
In life,

172
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:45,570
your preferences can change.

173
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:50,170
The men you date
are very different too.

174
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:52,040
Their race, nationality, and age
are all different.

175
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,040
Isn't that right?

176
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:59,100
That's the same way with me.

177
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,450
I have a variety
of preferences in men.

178
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:02,610
I can date all types of men.

179
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:04,610
Catch two birds with one bean.
Catch two fish with one worm.

180
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:06,480
It's adding icing on the cake.
It's an added bonus, you know.

181
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,480
Let me meet him.

182
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,790
- Why would you?
- Why do you think?

183
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:15,330
My only sister has a boyfriend.

184
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:17,520
I ought to check him out.

185
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:20,990
Sure. We should set a date...

186
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:21,990
Tomorrow.

187
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:27,070
It's tomorrow.

188
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:39,980
It's ruined.

189
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:41,350
I know.

190
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:43,010
A cake at this hour?

191
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:44,660
My plan to lose weight
is totally ruined.

192
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:46,790
Hey, are you listening to me?

193
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:48,850
I already know
what will go down tomorrow.

194
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:50,720
You told me that Won Seok
saw Kang Woo.

195
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,970
Then, he probably figured out...

196
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:53,760
that Kang Woo is
in the same group as him.

197
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,760
Do you really think so?

198
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,700
If not that, why would he
want to meet Kang Woo?

199
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:59,570
Did Won Seok ever want to meet
other guys you dated before?

200
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:04,000
- No.
- See? You're done for.

201
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,840
Do you think there's a guy
who won't fall for Won Seok?

202
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:09,270
If Won Seok begins
seducing Kang Woo,

203
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:11,880
Kang Woo and Hyun Soo
are over. They'll be history.

204
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:15,510
Your effort to help them out
will go down the drain.

205
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:18,690
My gosh. This is driving me crazy.

206
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,350
- What should I do?
- What do you think?

207
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,800
You must tell the truth.

208
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,800
And ask him to pretend he doesn't
know anything about it.

209
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,860
I don't know.

210
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:28,730
Let's eat first.

211
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,500
Expensive cakes are indeed sweet.

212
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,500
My gosh. This is crazy.

213
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:52,090
How do you feel?

214
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,120
What time?

215
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:59,090
What? What do you mean?

216
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,760
Meeting with your boyfriend.

217
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:07,810
What time?

218
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:10,580
Well... It's...

219
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:12,970
Don't you think
it's a bit uncomfortable for him?

220
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:14,950
We just started going out.

221
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:16,740
So was his name Lee Kang Woo?

222
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:18,450
You're the same age
and went to the same middle school.

223
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:19,950
It'll be easy to find him.

224
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:23,920
Fine. Yes.

225
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:29,460
Yes, you're right.

226
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:31,590
It's what you're thinking.

227
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:34,430
You're really
not dating him, are you?

228
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:38,170
- No.
- What are you doing with him?

229
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:41,410
Remember Park Hyun Soo
we asked you about the other day?

230
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:43,040
He's Hyun Soo's partner.

231
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:45,140
Things are a bit complicated
for them,

232
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:46,680
so I'm helping them out for a while.

233
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,680
Hold on.

234
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:50,420
What? Lee Kang Woo. He's...

235
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:54,010
- What?
- Can you not tell Won Jae?

236
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:56,160
You know
how conservative he can get.

237
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,060
If he finds out
that I'm fake-dating him,

238
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,830
he'll go find Lee Kang Woo.

239
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:01,190
It won't last long.

240
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:02,430
1 or 2 months at max.

241
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,260
It's just that...

242
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:07,800
I did something awful
to Kang Woo a long time ago.

243
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:10,390
I would feel at ease
once I clear it out.

244
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,840
Please?

245
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:22,820
This is nice.

246
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,920
I can look at Seo Yeon all day long.

247
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,290
- Why do you keep doing that?
- What do you mean?

248
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:30,290
Gosh.

249
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:37,560
My goodness.

250
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,830
- What on earth is he doing?
- I don't know.

251
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:44,490
- Vice-Principal.
- Yes.

252
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:47,940
I've been away from you guys
for a long time, haven't I?

253
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,310
I would like to treat you to a meal.

254
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:51,970
Could you set up a meeting?

255
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:54,550
Pardon? Sure.

256
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:56,180
Thank you.

257
00:16:57,370 --> 00:16:58,420
Okay.

258
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,890
He has mood swings.

259
00:17:10,089 --> 00:17:11,930
Is he bipolar or what?

260
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:13,260
I know, right?

261
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,760
- Thank you for the class.
- Thank you for the class.

262
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:38,430
My gosh. That's new.

263
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:44,820
Hi.

264
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:46,370
Hi.

265
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,440
Where is she rushing to?

266
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,740
Come on.

267
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:12,750
I knew it.

268
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:17,720
You're so petty. You're using food
to lure me in here.

269
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:20,100
It would've been nice
if you came when I asked.

270
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:22,790
A wound like this would heal
on itself even if I do nothing.

271
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:25,260
No. It will leave a scar.

272
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:27,440
You must cherish your body.

273
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:32,570
- What is it?
- You just sounded like my dad.

274
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:33,570
"No."

275
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,740
I'll eat it later.

276
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,360
Do you have a girlfriend?

277
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,170
You asked me a question
out of the blue.

278
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:55,990
No, I don't.

279
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,100
What kind of women do you like?

280
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,500
Tell me.

281
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,300
She could be fairly close to you.

282
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:07,850
I believe that
she's somewhere nearby.

283
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,080
I like women
who eat everything with gusto,

284
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,580
don't spare her body for her job,
and work hard.

285
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:19,780
I like kind women.

286
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:27,470
And?

287
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:30,940
That's about it.

288
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,760
What about you?

289
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:36,300
What kind of men do you like?

290
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,380
Looks are very important to me.

291
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:56,790
May we have a word, Ms. Joo?

292
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:06,210
What is it? What's this about?

293
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:10,270
We should tell people...

294
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:12,240
about our relationship.

295
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,240
What?

296
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,120
- Why?
- "Why?"

297
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:17,740
We ought to tell them
about our relationship.

298
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:19,040
The more people we tell, the better.

299
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,240
Hey, you're being too harsh.

300
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,120
That would be good for you.

301
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,160
But what about me?

302
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,580
You're my supervisor.
I work for you.

303
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:29,130
How would people think of me?

304
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,320
But...

305
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:36,440
don't get close to him.

306
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,600
What?

307
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:39,830
Don't get close to him.

308
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:41,060
What are you saying?

309
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:43,410
Don't get close to Lee Min Hyuk.

310
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:45,150
With Mr. Lee?

311
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:46,800
Why not?

312
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:49,810
- Just because.
- You must have a reason.

313
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:51,010
I don't have one.

314
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:52,850
Just don't get close to him.

315
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,750
What's your relationship with him?

316
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:59,050
There's nothing.

317
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:03,820
Anyway, don't get close to him.

318
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:10,940
What was that?
What's wrong with him?

319
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:13,830
Do you have a girlfriend?

320
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:15,300
She could be fairly close to you.

321
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,680
I believe that
she's somewhere nearby.

322
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,150
Did something happen between them
in the past?

323
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:41,600
How could I tell her
not to get close to Min Hyuk?

324
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,490
Darn it. Come on.

325
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:45,910
Even I think it was petty.

326
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:47,210
Gosh.

327
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:51,570
My gosh. They don't resemble
each other at all.

328
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:54,300
People say that
older brothers are always better,

329
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,850
but it's the opposite
with his family.

330
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:57,880
The younger one is very smart.

331
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,920
I heard
he's getting all the attention...

332
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,580
from the chairwoman.

333
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,420
Really?

334
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:04,620
I mean,

335
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,750
it's too embarrassing to say
that I'm anxious...

336
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:09,990
because Min Hyuk is too cool.

337
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:19,410
Seo Yeon.
How dare you make me anxious?

338
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:22,570
She's such an amazing woman.

339
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,740
You're so cute.

340
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:32,040
Wait, what? This guy is what?

341
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,040
No, right?

342
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,580
Oh, gosh.

343
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,190
Man, that was the funniest thing
I heard in a while.

344
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,630
Gosh, that's hilarious.

345
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:44,750
So tell me. Is he or isn't he?

346
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:48,200
What's going on? Won Seok,
you aren't as sharp as before.

347
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,830
Can't you tell?

348
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:51,730
No. Never.

349
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:55,680
Goodness. He loves women.

350
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:58,950
Is that so?

351
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:13,720
Hey, Seo Yeon.

352
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:17,490
Why didn't you bring it with you?

353
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,670
What do you think?
Don't I look cool?

354
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:28,440
I fit in with them, don't I?

355
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,800
Did you make me come here
at this hour for your style?

356
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,910
I mean...

357
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:39,220
I need this to help me practice.

358
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:43,480
Fine. Goodbye.

359
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,880
These are all the girls
that Park Hyun Soo dated.

360
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:06,570
What?

361
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,520
- What is this?
- No, what's going on with you?

362
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,520
That Park Hyun Soo guy
isn't dating your boyfriend.

363
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,290
- What?
- Lee Kang Woo is...

364
00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:27,370
definitely not your type,
so when I asked you,

365
00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:30,260
you said he's dating
this guy or something.

366
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,870
Say that again.

367
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:35,880
So Kang Woo and Hyun Soo
aren't dating?

368
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,230
Forget about dating.
They aren't one of us.

369
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:39,350
What's going on?

370
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:45,780
Darn it.

371
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:51,750
Joo Seo Jun!

372
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,290
You said he works here, right?
Where is he?

373
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:56,320
No idea.

374
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,970
He cleans all these places
late at night.

375
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:08,170
My gosh. What's with her?

376
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:24,460
Park Hyun Soo!

377
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:33,970
What are you doing?

378
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:35,760
Stay still.

379
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,940
If you move, you'll break a bone.

380
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:39,330
Why are you doing this?

381
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:42,000
Tell me the truth.
Are you dating Kang Woo?

382
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,470
Yes!

383
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:49,470
I'll break it. I'll break your bone.

384
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:53,040
I lied. I lied! I told you a lie!

385
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,360
Are you insane?

386
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,930
Are you trying to kill me?

387
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:01,220
Why did you lie to me?

388
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:03,320
Why did you come up with such a lie?

389
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,670
That's because...

390
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:15,000
I thought you two
might get clingy with us.

391
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:16,210
You two?

392
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:18,300
Who?

393
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:20,410
Wait, Mi Kyung and me?

394
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:26,690
So you two came up with that lie
thinking we're gold diggers?

395
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:29,310
I mean, there are
a lot of weird girls out there.

396
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:30,920
We were trying to play safe.

397
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,930
I'm sorry.

398
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,200
Who do you think you are...

399
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,720
to fool us like that?

400
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:45,330
Kang Woo, that jerk.

401
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:47,470
He doesn't know anything.
He has nothing to do with this.

402
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:49,180
Nonsense.

403
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:51,710
If he didn't know,
why would he put on a show...

404
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:53,110
to ask me out?

405
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:54,770
That's because...

406
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:55,970
Shut it.

407
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:59,220
I know you two plotted this
to embarrass me.

408
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,120
Darn you.

409
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,780
Darn it.

410
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,700
What was that?
What's going on right now?

411
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:17,760
Wait. Kang Woo.
I need to call him. Kang Woo.

412
00:27:18,290 --> 00:27:19,330
Darn it.

413
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:25,070
What's with my arm?

414
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:27,110
What's wrong with my arm?

415
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,420
Hey, you didn't even call.

416
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:36,890
We're dating, so I can do this.

417
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:53,000
I stopped by to have
some instant noodles.

418
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:55,970
Why? Are you offended?

419
00:27:55,970 --> 00:27:59,150
Instant noodles?
I don't have that here.

420
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:01,070
Wait here. I'll go get some.

421
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:04,540
Unbelievable.
Stop putting on a show.

422
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:07,080
I'm sure
Hyun Soo already called you.

423
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,860
Is it fun to play with me?

424
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:15,490
How can a human come up with...

425
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:17,200
such a lie?

426
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:19,370
What do you mean?

427
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:22,100
That's enough.

428
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:24,440
I know you aren't dating Hyun Soo.

429
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:27,370
- I'm not what?
- You were like this back then.

430
00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:30,970
You asked me out as a joke
15 years ago too.

431
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,970
- How can you do that again?
- What are you talking about?

432
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:35,150
Don't play dumb.

433
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:39,190
Now, give me 10 dollars each.

434
00:28:42,810 --> 00:28:45,390
What are you doing, Kang Woo?
Give me 10 dollars.

435
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:47,690
Hurry up.

436
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:53,560
- Okay, so who's next?
- Kim Mi Kyung of class three.

437
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,970
- Mi Kyung?
- Yes.

438
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:56,790
Hey, isn't she a bit too tough?

439
00:28:57,490 --> 00:28:58,490
Do you think so?

440
00:28:58,490 --> 00:28:59,800
What about...

441
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:01,470
- Joo Seo Yeon in our class?
- Seo Yeon?

442
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:03,800
She's kind of dumb,
so I think it's a good idea.

443
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,650
Okay, this time, it's Joo Seo Yeon.

444
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:08,240
You take all this money
if she says yes...

445
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,620
when you ask her out.

446
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:11,770
If you get turned down, you lose it.

447
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:14,010
So who wants to ask her out?

448
00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:16,010
What if she really says yes?

449
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:18,050
Then you'll have to date her.

450
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:21,320
Right, how can you date
such a boyish girl?

451
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,820
- Exactly.
- It's awful.

452
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:24,130
That's gross.

453
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:25,700
I can't even imagine.

454
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:42,740
What do you want to say?

455
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:45,510
Hey.

456
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:47,240
Don't do it.

457
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:50,050
Kang Woo, don't do it.

458
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,660
I like you, Seo Yeon.

459
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:58,520
Will you go out with me?

460
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,680
No.

461
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:18,950
I don't like you
because you're ugly...

462
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:21,480
and fat.

463
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:37,470
That jerk.

464
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,500
You should apologize to me now.

465
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:44,070
Tell me that it was a joke.

466
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:51,740
You did that back then too.

467
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:54,220
How can you do this again?

468
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,360
So...

469
00:30:58,010 --> 00:30:59,480
I asked you out...

470
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:02,630
15 years ago because of a bet?

471
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:04,600
Although it was a bet,

472
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:07,370
I felt bad for the harsh things
that I said to you.

473
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:10,370
That's why I wanted
to help you out this time.

474
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,170
But you were lying again?

475
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:14,970
You.

476
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:18,680
Did you think I was that low?

477
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:21,770
Like a jerk
who asks girls out on a bet?

478
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:26,080
Do you really think...

479
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,660
that's who I am?

480
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:32,890
Yes.

481
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:35,280
You only seem...

482
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:38,200
that low to me.

483
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,430
Should I sue her?

484
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:00,410
No.

485
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:02,380
It's my fault.

486
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:18,950
Hey, I was about to call you,
but my arms are like this.

487
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:20,230
I can explain.

488
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:23,400
Hey, calm down.

489
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:27,130
Okay? Calm down. Hey, calm down.

490
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:33,910
No! Don't follow me!

491
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,220
Goodness. That's frightening.

492
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,980
Do you know
how much this door costs?

493
00:32:43,450 --> 00:32:44,450
Hey.

494
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,760
I... I was only trying to help.

495
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:50,160
I didn't think there would be
the slightest chance you'll like...

496
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,250
So...

497
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:54,060
Seo Yeon was trying to help...

498
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:56,200
by pretending to date me...

499
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:58,230
because she thought we were dating?

500
00:32:58,530 --> 00:33:00,500
She has no feelings for me?

501
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:02,340
Probably?

502
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,750
Hey.

503
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:18,220
Are you okay?

504
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:20,160
This is driving me insane.

505
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:23,830
Hey, I told her...

506
00:33:24,090 --> 00:33:26,300
you had nothing to do with this,

507
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:28,830
but she won't believe me.

508
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,470
Do not tell her.

509
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:34,610
You and I plotted this together.

510
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:37,140
I knew everything
from the beginning.

511
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:40,580
Why not? I told her
you had nothing to do with...

512
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:41,840
Don't tell her.

513
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:44,510
If she finds out,

514
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:47,920
I will never see you again.

515
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:49,840
Okay?

516
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:53,280
Do you get it?

517
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:05,660
Why did I come up
with such a stupid lie?

518
00:34:08,739 --> 00:34:09,940
Goodness.

519
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,570
My door...

520
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:20,340
Seo Yeon.

521
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,989
How dare you pity me?

522
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:27,989
You felt bad for me
so you pretended to go out with me?

523
00:34:27,989 --> 00:34:28,989
Yes.

524
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:33,190
You only seem that low to me.

525
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:40,739
No, I can go lower.

526
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,810
I'll show you how much lower...

527
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:46,780
I can go.

528
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:50,440
Seo Yeon.

529
00:34:57,410 --> 00:35:00,320
So Hyun Soo and Kang Woo
came up with that lie...

530
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:03,720
because they were afraid
we'll go after their money?

531
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:05,720
I realized once again
that handsome guys...

532
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:07,530
always live up to their looks.

533
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:10,270
Goodness,
who do they think they are?

534
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:11,560
They didn't only fool us.

535
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:14,740
They deceived all women and
the LGBT community of this nation.

536
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:16,440
Should we upload the story online?

537
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:20,570
Wait, does this mean Mr. Lee has
nothing to do with this?

538
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:23,970
Yes, we just figured
he was like that.

539
00:35:23,970 --> 00:35:25,650
So I was right.

540
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:27,520
He definitely has a thing for you...

541
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,280
Hey! What are you doing?

542
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,280
Let me go.

543
00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:33,850
I'm going crazy with the anger
from the bottom of my heart.

544
00:35:33,850 --> 00:35:35,750
Hey, no. Forget it.

545
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:38,220
They're like poop.
Let's say we stepped on some poop.

546
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:39,690
They're just poop!

547
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:40,770
Let me go!

548
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:43,290
I can't believe you are
all so lethargic as teachers.

549
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:44,840
None of you have any energy!

550
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,870
You all do your bare minimal
thinking, "It's probably not me."

551
00:35:46,870 --> 00:35:48,130
What are you doing, Mr. Oh?

552
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:51,240
Do you think I wouldn't notice
if you're playing with your phone?

553
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,470
I can see everything!

554
00:35:52,970 --> 00:35:56,810
Okay, so the real midterm
will be very soon.

555
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:59,680
Goodness, Mr. Lee. What...

556
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,280
What brings you here at this hour?

557
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:03,090
I needed some help.

558
00:36:03,090 --> 00:36:05,780
Then I'll get an assistant.
Hey, Chief.

559
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:07,890
You don't need to hire someone else.

560
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:11,850
- I can see someone who's free.
- Who?

561
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,400
Over there.

562
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:18,790
You don't have to make any tests
for physical education, right?

563
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:33,980
What are you doing?

564
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:38,460
What? This is who I am.

565
00:36:38,890 --> 00:36:40,090
You know me.

566
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,390
- What?
- You're right.

567
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,160
I asked you out...

568
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,400
and pretended to date Hyun Soo...

569
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:47,790
to get my revenge
for what you did back then.

570
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:51,070
If I just asked you out,

571
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:52,730
you would've turned me down.

572
00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:55,140
Of course.

573
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:56,970
Why would I date you?

574
00:36:56,970 --> 00:36:58,710
It's not like I'm shot in the head.

575
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,600
Fine.

576
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:04,320
That's why I lied. So what?

577
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,520
Unbelievable.

578
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:08,410
But you caught me
much earlier than I thought.

579
00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:11,960
So now that you caught me,

580
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,980
I decided to bully you
out in the open.

581
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:16,420
- What?
- I saw that you are...

582
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:18,830
a contracted teacher.

583
00:37:19,090 --> 00:37:20,920
- You.
- You can drive, can't you?

584
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:24,340
Go check the tires...

585
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:25,660
and change the engine oil.

586
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,300
- Hey!
- You don't want to?

587
00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:29,140
Forget it, then.

588
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:32,470
I'll write up a recruitment notice
for a new P.E. teacher.

589
00:37:32,930 --> 00:37:33,950
Okay.

590
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:39,170
"Shinhwa High School is
looking for a new P.E. teacher."

591
00:37:39,170 --> 00:37:43,280
"If you are someone who can do
everything that your boss asks to,"

592
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,260
- "feel free to..."
- Fine.

593
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:48,090
Manners.

594
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:52,260
Sir. Yes, sir.

595
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:55,090
The tires and the engine oil.
I get it, sir.

596
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:58,770
Get it done within an hour.

597
00:37:58,770 --> 00:38:00,030
I have to go somewhere by car.

598
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:02,910
By car? Do you expect me
to be your chauffeur too?

599
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:08,100
Yes, I will do it.

600
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:10,880
I will do it, sir!

601
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:26,720
Why is it acting up again?

602
00:38:29,770 --> 00:38:31,590
Seo Yeon, you.

603
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,410
Why did you want to meet outside?

604
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:43,710
Because I needed to look like
I'm very busy out here,

605
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:46,110
but I didn't have
anyone else to meet.

606
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:48,180
- What?
- Over there.

607
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:49,540
Do you see her?

608
00:38:53,610 --> 00:38:55,260
Wait, she's...

609
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,200
that woman, isn't she?

610
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:00,420
Is he badmouthing me
in front of my face?

611
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:03,330
Man, he's like a thug.

612
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:07,230
Then the feelings for that woman...

613
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:12,030
The difference between that feeling
and hatred was paper-thin.

614
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:14,800
I already ripped out...

615
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,220
that paper.

616
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:25,980
It seems like there is
a lot more of that paper left.

617
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,830
- Pardon?
- Let me see your ear.

618
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:35,420
I was wondering
if you had something in there.

619
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:45,210
What is it?

620
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,300
You're in my office
without hiding yourself.

621
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:55,520
- Why?
- Why are you so mean to Ms. Joo?

622
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,550
I thought you two were friends.

623
00:39:57,850 --> 00:39:58,960
Aren't you?

624
00:39:59,050 --> 00:40:00,320
Mind your business.

625
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,980
She's a great teacher.

626
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:03,920
- I don't care.
- Kang Woo.

627
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:04,920
"Kang Woo"?

628
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:07,270
You didn't want anyone to find out
that we're cousins.

629
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:08,790
What if someone hears you?

630
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:11,930
You should probably leave, Mr. Lee.

631
00:40:12,270 --> 00:40:14,930
Isn't it odd for the chief director
to be close with the school doctor?

632
00:40:19,070 --> 00:40:20,480
Mind your own business.

633
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,280
It doesn't matter
if I bully her or be mean to her.

634
00:40:23,850 --> 00:40:25,850
It's between us.

635
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,540
I'm sorry.
I ate some without asking.

636
00:41:05,990 --> 00:41:07,160
You're welcome anytime.

637
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:12,920
Mr. Lee.

638
00:41:13,290 --> 00:41:16,820
If one does good,
shouldn't they be blessed?

639
00:41:18,370 --> 00:41:20,640
Why do you think I'm getting
the exact opposite?

640
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:22,660
Are you okay?

641
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,170
What's going on between you
and the chief director?

642
00:41:27,570 --> 00:41:28,650
It's something ill-fated.

643
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:31,750
It's like gum that's entangled
in your hair.

644
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:34,810
It's so entangled that
the only way to remove it...

645
00:41:35,650 --> 00:41:38,310
is by cutting the hair.

646
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,530
That's what we have.

647
00:41:47,770 --> 00:41:49,230
Thank you for the snack.

648
00:42:01,650 --> 00:42:02,750
Yes, Grandma.

649
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:06,120
Is Kang Woo doing well?

650
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:09,310
I wish he was half as good as you.

651
00:42:09,310 --> 00:42:10,710
He's doing well.

652
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:13,050
Do take good care of him.

653
00:42:13,050 --> 00:42:15,360
We should all gather together soon.

654
00:42:15,490 --> 00:42:16,660
Goodbye.

655
00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:20,900
Why are you always
so unhappy about Kang Woo?

656
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:24,060
You should have an objective view.

657
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:27,290
What else does Kang Woo have
except for his good looks?

658
00:42:27,290 --> 00:42:30,410
He has neither a good job
nor personality.

659
00:42:30,410 --> 00:42:33,510
Min Hyuk was a doctor back then,

660
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:36,410
but now, he just works
under Kang Woo.

661
00:42:36,410 --> 00:42:38,520
Once a doctor, always a doctor.

662
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,040
What nonsense are you spewing?

663
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:41,410
If he wants, I could build...

664
00:42:41,410 --> 00:42:43,280
a hospital this instant
just for him.

665
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:46,080
Mother, that's a wonderful idea.

666
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:48,360
Min Hyuk was always
such a good boy.

667
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:50,730
He's kind, smart, and humble.

668
00:42:50,730 --> 00:42:54,500
Kang Hee and Kang Woo may be
my kids, but they're too unfriendly.

669
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:56,230
Come on, now.

670
00:42:56,530 --> 00:42:57,640
Oh, my.

671
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:01,560
We're running late. We should go.
We'll be late.

672
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:02,560
Let's go.

673
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:03,930
Where are you going?

674
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:07,030
Why are you here?

675
00:43:07,030 --> 00:43:08,250
Don't you know...

676
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:09,940
that you have a dinner appointment
with Whole Foods from the UK?

677
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:11,750
Are you going to bail on them?

678
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:13,850
What? What does she mean?

679
00:43:13,850 --> 00:43:16,020
I thought you weren't busy today.

680
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:17,990
You're right. Didn't you decide
to go to the spa with us...

681
00:43:17,990 --> 00:43:19,620
because you were free?

682
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:22,260
I did. That's why I...

683
00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:26,290
Whatever. I'm not a figurehead.

684
00:43:26,290 --> 00:43:29,000
You do all the work, so why
should I go there?

685
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:32,560
Look at those eyes, Mother.

686
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:35,030
Fine, I'm going. Fine!

687
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:38,980
You didn't need to drop us off.

688
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,800
It's on the way.

689
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,170
I'll send Mr. Kim there
to pick you guys up.

690
00:43:43,170 --> 00:43:46,780
Make sure you order
saffron risotto.

691
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:49,080
It's really good.

692
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:50,120
Whatever.

693
00:43:50,310 --> 00:43:52,580
Nothing tastes good
during business dinners.

694
00:43:52,710 --> 00:43:54,990
Mother, should we go
to that restaurant...

695
00:43:54,990 --> 00:43:57,030
to have dinner later as well?

696
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:58,360
Where is it?

697
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:01,060
It's the restaurant where
Kang Woo had his blind date.

698
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:02,160
He went on a blind date?

699
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:05,160
For some strange reason,
he agreed to it.

700
00:44:05,330 --> 00:44:08,370
But he must've not liked her.
It didn't work out.

701
00:44:08,370 --> 00:44:10,980
But what matters is that
he agreed to do it.

702
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:14,010
Just let him be.
I'm sure he has his own plans.

703
00:44:14,010 --> 00:44:15,880
He's not thoughtless.

704
00:44:16,110 --> 00:44:18,540
What is it?
Did he tell you something?

705
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:20,540
You're at your destination.

706
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:21,750
We're here.

707
00:44:28,390 --> 00:44:29,890
I can't believe you got this wrong.

708
00:44:40,370 --> 00:44:42,300
It's either all or nothing for me.

709
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:46,380
Hello, I didn't know you were home.

710
00:44:49,150 --> 00:44:50,670
Won Seok, are you going to work now?

711
00:44:50,670 --> 00:44:52,650
Have some. You love sweet potatoes.

712
00:44:55,850 --> 00:44:56,940
Thanks.

713
00:45:00,050 --> 00:45:01,160
Isn't it good?

714
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:03,450
Ho Dol's parents have
a sweet potato garden.

715
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:06,130
- Who?
- My private tutor. You've met him.

716
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:09,530
- Private tutor?
- We're taking a short break.

717
00:45:09,530 --> 00:45:10,960
He's in the bathroom.

718
00:45:24,650 --> 00:45:25,980
You know me, don't you?

719
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:28,020
Sorry?

720
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:29,710
No.

721
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:32,260
You don't?

722
00:45:32,490 --> 00:45:34,080
- Well...
- Do you not remember me?

723
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:35,530
I'm not too sure.

724
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:39,730
So you were just curious that day.

725
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:43,290
No, I really mustered up my courage.

726
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:46,240
So you do remember.

727
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:52,140
- You...
- I won't tell anyone.

728
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:54,850
I won't tell your family.

729
00:45:54,850 --> 00:45:57,040
I'll feign ignorance,

730
00:45:57,940 --> 00:46:00,440
so please let me continue
tutoring them.

731
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:01,850
- What?
- I'm not the type...

732
00:46:01,850 --> 00:46:04,150
to spill other people's secrets.

733
00:46:04,150 --> 00:46:06,020
I promise it'll be a secret.

734
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:09,080
As far as I know,
we've never met at that bar.

735
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:10,230
Ever.

736
00:46:14,530 --> 00:46:15,690
What was he saying?

737
00:46:16,630 --> 00:46:18,100
Keep what a secret?

738
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:44,290
What do you want me to do?

739
00:46:44,290 --> 00:46:45,950
Should I beat him to a pulp?

740
00:46:45,950 --> 00:46:47,730
He's not even worth it.

741
00:46:47,730 --> 00:46:49,190
I'm the fool for being duped.

742
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:51,160
Weren't you just a fake girlfriend?

743
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:52,870
Then there's no problem, right?

744
00:46:52,870 --> 00:46:54,030
Right.

745
00:46:58,170 --> 00:47:00,780
Don't worry about me and go to work.

746
00:47:03,170 --> 00:47:04,250
Bye.

747
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:13,680
[Move to trash]

748
00:47:14,490 --> 00:47:15,490
[Move to trash]

749
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:24,130
Why does she look so gloomy?

750
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:28,660
Is it because of him?

751
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:36,940
You. I've never liked you
from the beginning.

752
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:46,620
- Yes?
- Where are you?

753
00:47:46,620 --> 00:47:48,280
Your mother's here.

754
00:47:59,770 --> 00:48:01,330
Hello.

755
00:48:04,330 --> 00:48:05,570
He's 47 years old.

756
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:07,610
He divorced his 3rd wife
3 months ago...

757
00:48:07,610 --> 00:48:08,940
due to irreconcilable differences.

758
00:48:09,750 --> 00:48:11,150
He has 30 million dollars
to his name.

759
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:15,580
We don't have much time.
Wear this and come on out.

760
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:23,390
Baek Hyo Jung is notorious.

761
00:48:23,550 --> 00:48:25,790
Doesn't he have a total of 15 kids
out of wedlock?

762
00:48:26,190 --> 00:48:27,230
Right?

763
00:48:27,260 --> 00:48:29,100
They all have different mothers.

764
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:32,640
You're his fifth mistress' child,
and you happen to be a daughter.

765
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:35,060
You should at least get married
to a wealthy man...

766
00:48:35,060 --> 00:48:36,660
and benefit your family.

767
00:48:37,060 --> 00:48:38,110
Don't you think so?

768
00:48:41,010 --> 00:48:42,700
Your mom handed this to me.

769
00:48:43,110 --> 00:48:44,350
Do you want to go upstairs?

770
00:48:46,620 --> 00:48:48,810
How dare you?

771
00:48:48,810 --> 00:48:50,910
You should've followed him upstairs.

772
00:48:50,910 --> 00:48:52,950
Is it that hard to sleep with him?

773
00:48:52,950 --> 00:48:56,020
You wench! You're so useless!

774
00:48:58,450 --> 00:49:00,800
Did your husband have an affair
with her or something?

775
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:02,070
Who are you?

776
00:49:02,070 --> 00:49:03,870
Step aside. She's my daughter.

777
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:07,540
That's even more horrible.

778
00:49:07,870 --> 00:49:09,540
How could you beat your own child?

779
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:10,730
What?

780
00:49:16,850 --> 00:49:19,080
We'll talk again.

781
00:49:25,790 --> 00:49:27,120
She's quite small-boned.

782
00:49:27,510 --> 00:49:29,590
I'm pretty sure
you could've subdued her.

783
00:49:29,630 --> 00:49:31,560
You should've hit her back.

784
00:49:56,890 --> 00:49:57,910
Look at her.

785
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:22,080
You caught my attention
from a while ago.

786
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:23,740
Your ankle must hurt a lot.

787
00:50:23,740 --> 00:50:24,850
You can wear these.

788
00:50:28,350 --> 00:50:31,710
I got them for just three dollars,
so it's fine.

789
00:50:46,370 --> 00:50:47,600
Haven't you learned
not to be so nosy...

790
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:48,730
from your past mistakes?

791
00:50:49,540 --> 00:50:51,270
By the way, she looks familiar.

792
00:50:53,230 --> 00:50:56,050
Really? I don't think so.

793
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:00,240
By the way, I don't see that woman
who used to be here.

794
00:51:00,650 --> 00:51:01,650
Who?

795
00:51:02,410 --> 00:51:04,890
The one with the most wicked name?

796
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:06,480
Was it Baek Jang Mi?

797
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:09,360
I guess she found a shelter to stay.

798
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:10,630
That's good then.

799
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:12,520
Let's go.

800
00:51:12,830 --> 00:51:14,830
We should have a drink
since we just worked out.

801
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:16,600
Let's eat something delicious.

802
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:19,870
Let's go to that restaurant.

803
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:31,770
My gosh. This is nice. You know?

804
00:51:31,770 --> 00:51:35,390
Goodness. I knew it.

805
00:51:35,390 --> 00:51:36,850
People say that breakups are
the driving force of hard work.

806
00:51:36,850 --> 00:51:39,820
Great. You're doing a great job.
Nice, Kang Woo.

807
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:45,900
I'll go.

808
00:51:52,990 --> 00:51:55,870
Goodness, he can be so grumpy.

809
00:51:56,930 --> 00:51:57,930
Wait.

810
00:51:59,930 --> 00:52:02,310
By the way, why is
Kim Mi Kyung so quiet these days?

811
00:52:02,310 --> 00:52:03,700
I doubt she'd let me slide for this.

812
00:52:18,450 --> 00:52:20,690
Give it to me.
I'll exchange it next time.

813
00:52:20,690 --> 00:52:23,070
Don't touch Mr. Potato
without permission.

814
00:52:23,070 --> 00:52:26,040
What? You already named it?

815
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:29,310
[Grass head]

816
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:33,000
Is Mr. Potato doing well?

817
00:52:33,340 --> 00:52:35,670
He won't be mean to Mr. Potato
because he hates me, right?

818
00:52:36,150 --> 00:52:38,010
What is it? Do you want one?
Should I buy you one?

819
00:52:38,010 --> 00:52:40,170
What? No.

820
00:52:40,550 --> 00:52:42,890
Right. Did you call Hyun Soo?

821
00:52:42,890 --> 00:52:44,510
No. Why would I?

822
00:52:44,980 --> 00:52:47,060
Someone like him
deserves nothing but silence.

823
00:52:47,060 --> 00:52:48,950
He's not a human being.
How could I talk to him?

824
00:52:57,570 --> 00:52:58,570
Wait up for me.

825
00:53:33,690 --> 00:53:34,700
[Move to trash]

826
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:42,650
[Move to trash]

827
00:53:49,010 --> 00:53:50,850
Although it was a bet,

828
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:54,010
I felt bad for the harsh things
that I said to you.

829
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:57,060
That's why I wanted to
help you out this time.

830
00:53:57,680 --> 00:53:59,160
But you were lying again?

831
00:53:59,450 --> 00:54:01,660
Did you think I was that low?

832
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:02,960
Yes.

833
00:54:03,330 --> 00:54:04,600
You only seem...

834
00:54:05,190 --> 00:54:07,070
that low to me.

835
00:54:13,770 --> 00:54:15,580
No matter how much I changed,

836
00:54:15,970 --> 00:54:17,910
it doesn't matter to you.

837
00:54:19,670 --> 00:54:20,740
That's it, right?

838
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:35,720
Gosh.

839
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:41,910
- Hello?
- Sir. Hello.

840
00:54:42,140 --> 00:54:43,910
You're not coming
to work today again?

841
00:54:43,910 --> 00:54:45,040
No, I'm not.

842
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:46,640
This is not ideal,

843
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:49,200
but it's about the meal
you mentioned the other day.

844
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:52,620
The one you were to treat us.
We scheduled it for today.

845
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:54,550
Must I be there?

846
00:54:54,550 --> 00:54:56,680
Well, you were the one
who suggested it in the first place.

847
00:54:56,680 --> 00:54:58,790
- It'd be odd if you don't...
- Okay.

848
00:54:58,860 --> 00:55:00,120
Send me the address.

849
00:55:01,060 --> 00:55:02,680
He offered to buy the meal.

850
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:03,980
Did I ask him to buy a meal?

851
00:55:04,130 --> 00:55:06,900
How am I supposed to dance
to his tune? Is he serious?

852
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:08,990
- Hello.
- That was funny.

853
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:10,800
He's on the phone.

854
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:11,930
Gosh.

855
00:55:12,570 --> 00:55:13,760
Why wasn't the call disconnected?

856
00:55:20,140 --> 00:55:21,650
Seo Yeon will be there too.

857
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:25,120
Don't cause a scene
because I'm not there.

858
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:27,740
If you end up killing Kang Woo
after trying hard not to kill him,

859
00:55:27,740 --> 00:55:29,120
you must call me right away.

860
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:31,480
I know a good place to bury a body.

861
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:32,620
Come on.

862
00:55:33,060 --> 00:55:36,020
Why do we have
to have this meal today?

863
00:55:36,020 --> 00:55:37,980
Should I just not
go to my parents' house?

864
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:40,360
It's your dad's memorial service.
You ought to be there.

865
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:43,070
Don't worry.
Send my regards to your mother.

866
00:55:43,370 --> 00:55:44,990
Actually, she was so grateful.

867
00:55:44,990 --> 00:55:47,660
My mother thanked you
for that expensive meat.

868
00:55:47,660 --> 00:55:49,260
He liked meat.

869
00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:50,410
Cook a lot for him.

870
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:52,110
- Bye.
- Okay.

871
00:55:55,470 --> 00:55:57,200
Why can't I be at ease?

872
00:55:57,580 --> 00:56:00,210
I get the feeling she'll get drunk
and get in trouble today.

873
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:03,680
Should I get someone
to look out for her?

874
00:56:05,390 --> 00:56:06,390
Mr. Lee.

875
00:56:27,770 --> 00:56:29,270
You'll need to drive after the meal.

876
00:56:29,270 --> 00:56:30,440
Don't drink.

877
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:32,050
You can call the chauffeur service.

878
00:56:32,910 --> 00:56:34,150
I get to decide that.

879
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:42,750
Darn it.

880
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:47,250
- Everyone, you should drink.
- Drink up.

881
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:49,920
- Let's drink.
- Cheers.

882
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:52,160
- Sir, have a wrap.
- Thank you.

883
00:56:52,490 --> 00:56:53,490
Here.

884
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:56,260
I'm the only one
looking out for you.

885
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:07,880
What?

886
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:16,660
Seo Yeon, do you want a drink?

887
00:57:19,450 --> 00:57:21,420
Well, not today.

888
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:26,600
You know what?
Let me pour you a drink.

889
00:57:27,070 --> 00:57:28,460
I drove here.

890
00:57:35,050 --> 00:57:36,050
Mr. Lee,

891
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:40,170
you're a very nice guy.

892
00:57:43,910 --> 00:57:45,890
My gosh. What a waste.

893
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:56,190
What is it?

894
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:58,660
It's sweet.

895
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:30,070
You're pretty.

896
00:58:30,690 --> 00:58:32,340
What's your name?

897
00:58:32,660 --> 00:58:34,570
I'm Joo Seo Yeon.

898
00:58:41,910 --> 00:58:43,170
I told you not to drink.

899
00:58:43,170 --> 00:58:45,470
It's up to me. You jerk.
What are you going to do?

900
00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:50,050
- Go away.
- What are you doing? It's dirty!

901
00:58:50,050 --> 00:58:53,410
Learn your lesson,
and don't show up in front of me.

902
00:58:53,410 --> 00:58:54,480
- Go away.
- Hey.

903
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:55,830
- Go.
- Hey.

904
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:11,230
Are you a kid?

905
00:59:12,610 --> 00:59:13,880
You're playing with dirt.

906
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:25,390
You're so nasty.

907
00:59:32,220 --> 00:59:33,220
All right.

908
00:59:34,420 --> 00:59:35,570
Go home now.

909
00:59:37,570 --> 00:59:39,930
I knew it.
People don't change that easily.

910
00:59:39,930 --> 00:59:41,700
I thought you changed.

911
00:59:41,700 --> 00:59:43,700
But you haven't changed at all.

912
00:59:45,430 --> 00:59:47,770
Are you blind?
Isn't this obvious?

913
00:59:47,770 --> 00:59:49,050
I totally changed!

914
00:59:49,050 --> 00:59:51,710
No. You're a bad guy...

915
00:59:51,710 --> 00:59:53,350
just like you were then and now.

916
00:59:53,350 --> 00:59:55,550
You lie about your feelings.

917
00:59:55,550 --> 00:59:57,050
Hey, what happened 15 years ago...

918
00:59:57,050 --> 01:00:00,060
How could you stay exactly the same?

919
01:00:01,290 --> 01:00:02,950
I changed. I did!

920
01:00:02,950 --> 01:00:04,450
Do you know
how hard I tried to change?

921
01:00:04,450 --> 01:00:05,860
Yes. You did.

922
01:00:05,860 --> 01:00:07,300
As if a 180-degree change
wasn't enough,

923
01:00:07,300 --> 01:00:08,960
you had a 360-degree change.

924
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:10,830
Yes, I had a 360...

925
01:00:11,490 --> 01:00:12,640
That means I'm the same.

926
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:13,840
You know what?

927
01:00:14,230 --> 01:00:18,340
You haven't changed one bit.

928
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:22,880
I don't like anything about you.

929
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:24,000
Not one.

930
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:29,590
You are a guy who never changes.

931
01:00:29,590 --> 01:00:31,050
You never change.

932
01:00:38,990 --> 01:00:40,420
What should I do then?

933
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:42,960
What?

934
01:00:43,490 --> 01:00:45,870
What must I do to win you over?

935
01:00:47,460 --> 01:00:49,310
Kang Woo, you!

936
01:01:04,210 --> 01:01:05,660
What can I do...

937
01:01:07,010 --> 01:01:08,660
to have your heart?

938
01:01:16,990 --> 01:01:18,870
- What are you doing?
- I'll take Ms. Joo...

939
01:01:18,870 --> 01:01:20,160
home.

940
01:01:21,930 --> 01:01:22,930
What are you doing?

941
01:01:22,930 --> 01:01:25,540
You're the one who bullied her.
What are you trying to do now?

942
01:01:25,540 --> 01:01:27,610
Don't you know why she got so drunk?

943
01:01:27,610 --> 01:01:29,380
I said it's none of your business.

944
01:01:29,910 --> 01:01:32,150
No, I'll make it my business.

945
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:46,720
What are you doing?

946
01:01:48,190 --> 01:01:49,400
Who do you think you are?

947
01:01:52,300 --> 01:01:53,400
Wait, do you...

948
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:55,310
like...

949
01:01:55,640 --> 01:01:56,730
Ask me.

950
01:01:58,340 --> 01:02:00,140
You know I can't lie.

951
01:02:01,610 --> 01:02:02,740
Ask me why...

952
01:02:03,650 --> 01:02:04,970
I'm doing this.

953

[Love With Flaws]

954
01:02:38,050 --> 01:02:40,970
Pull yourself together. This will be
the best season of your dating life.

955
01:02:40,970 --> 01:02:42,150
Is Min Hyuk dating someone?

956
01:02:42,150 --> 01:02:43,910
They looked quite close.

957
01:02:43,910 --> 01:02:45,950
I fell for her at first sight,
then I gradually began to like her.

958
01:02:45,950 --> 01:02:47,620
You never smiled at me like that.

959
01:02:47,620 --> 01:02:49,480
I'll be a nuisance.
I'll get on your nerves.

960
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:51,130
Gosh, you're so clingy.

961
01:02:51,130 --> 01:02:52,800
No one has a crush on someone
like this nowadays.

962
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:55,130
I can never like someone
who looks like you.

963
01:02:55,130 --> 01:02:57,370
I'm sorry that I like you.
