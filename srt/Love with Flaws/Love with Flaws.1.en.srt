But forget about the budget for now.

The chief director's position
is vacant as of now.

We can talk again
once the chief director returns.

Doesn't your contract end next year?

172
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:45,120
Being proactive won't
do you any good.

173
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:47,080
You should listen to the elderly.

174
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:50,260
Being so proactive
will only cause trouble.

175
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:51,550
But...

176
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:16,310
Right. I'll be leaving this school
by next year.

Those who need to clean

Can you let go of my face?

No, it's all right.

He may look different,

Will he propose?

292
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:29,950
We should break up.

I went on a blind date.

294

You know that I had high standards
ever since I was young.

295

I thought
no woman could win my heart.

296

But I finally found her.

297

She was in the beauty pageant,

Now,

I ought to meet a woman
that suits me.

302

Are you done?

303
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:47,460
Why do you always act pitiful here?

304
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,430
It's free.

305
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:02,330
They are such pretty boys.

306
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:04,040
34, 24, and 32?

307
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,180
You know what?
People find me hot too.

308
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:29,590
Everyone here must be all blind!

309
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,040
Hey.

310
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:35,570
This is a gay bar.

311
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,810
Do you know what your problem is?

312
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:45,580
I'm not as pretty as the men
in this bar?

313
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:47,340
You discriminate
against people's looks.

314
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:50,930
I shouldn't hear that
from you of all people!

315
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:52,050
Look at the room!

316
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:54,200
Everyone here is all handsome.

317
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,200
So what?

318
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:57,860
We're bound to look for
prettier and better-looking people.

319
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:59,730
And how could you say
that I discriminate...

320
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:01,130
against people's looks?

321
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:03,130
If a guy is handsome, he's rude.

322
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:04,830
If a guy is ugly, he's kind.

323
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:08,040
You judge people
based on people's looks.

324
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:10,480
Isn't that discriminating
against people's looks?

325
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,480
Whose fault is that?

326
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,680
You can't cry, can you?

327
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:15,550
And the liquor tastes good, right?

328
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:20,550
If you really loved that jerk,

00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,460
you would cry
even if you didn't want to.

330
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:25,320
And the liquor wouldn't taste good
even if you want to drink.

331
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:29,300
You just like that jerk's face.

332
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:33,230
What do you know?

333
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:36,000
You have a new boyfriend
every two days.

334
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,830
What do you know about love?

335
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:44,010
Darn it.

336
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:55,850
Watch your head.

337
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,030
I'll call you.

338
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:01,150
Please drive her home safely.

Darn it. You're disgusting.

341
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,130
I'm sorry.

342
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:50,780
I'm sorry.

[Prettier Than Flowers]

344
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:14,000
I'm sad.

345
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:16,270
I just got dumped.

346
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:18,470
Just one drop.

347
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:22,510
Please let a teardrop
roll down my face.

348
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:23,800
Please?

349
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:30,750
Yes.

350
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:34,380
You want to drink? That's great.

351
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:36,460
Let's drink until we drop.

352
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:37,550
Where are you?

353
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:39,080
I'm in!

[Prettier Than Flowers]

355
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,230
This is absurd!

356
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:47,860
Why did he want to meet there
if he was going to break up?

357
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,440
I guess he had a 50-percent-discount
coupon that expired today.

358
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,510
He must've been embarrassed...

359
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:53,100
to use a coupon
in front of his new girlfriend.

360
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,680
That crazy jerk!

361
00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:57,440
Seriously.
Ugly ones always make a fuss.

362
00:24:58,550 --> 00:25:01,110
Hey, you're not texting him, right?

363
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,310
Hey. Keep your pride.

364
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:06,190
Try to keep the last ounce
of your pride. Okay?

365
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:09,290
My gosh, who is this handsome guy?

366
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:10,410
Oh Jung Tae.

367
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:11,490
What?

368
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:16,460
Gosh. Call him. Let's ask
where he got his surgery done.

369
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:17,460
Come on.

370
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:20,060
But why do you have
a photo of that jerk?

371
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,860
He asked me to remember him
with the new face, not the old one.

372
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,660
So I asked him to take a selfie.

373
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:26,770
And he took the selfie for you?

374
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:29,440
I get that he's a jerk,
but you're something else too.

375
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:32,140
You asked the guy
who dumped you to take a selfie.

376
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:33,680
That's unheard of.

377
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:37,050
I'll keep this photo
and remember that.

378
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:38,050
Remember what?

379
00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:41,350
That handsome men
are not trustworthy.

380
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:43,110
He was so kind before,
but with this new face,

381
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:44,380
he's become someone else.

382
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:46,790
Do you think
you make sense right now?

383
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:48,800
Did your brain shrink
after getting dumped?

384
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:51,530
- Darn it.
- Goodness, you scared me.

385
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:53,730
Stop scaring me like that!

386

Are you all right?

00:25:58,900 --> 00:25:59,970
Are you crying?

Darn it. Don't waste your tears
on a jerk like him.

This is a huge embarrassment
to the neighborhood.

Excuse me.

Lee Joo Hee of your class
didn't come to school again today.

00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,590
Is she ill?

I haven't.

Wait.

426
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:22,570
Then shouldn't you look into it?

427
00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:24,840
She's not interested in
going to college,

428
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,780
so she doesn't care
about her attendance.

429
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:28,240
If she keeps herself out of class...

430
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,710
to not be a nuisance
to other good students,

431
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:31,020
I'll be grateful.

432
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:34,760
It's not easy to look after
each and every one of those kids.

433
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,590
If you want to know,
you can look into it.

434
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,170
P.E. teachers have a lot of time.

435
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:43,170
What's with him?

436
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:45,590

Wait, this is because...

438
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:29,900
What was that?

439
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:31,620
Did he miss it?

440
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:51,130
Oh, and our electricity bill
this month was way too high.

441
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:53,130
I think it's the air conditioning
in our classes.

442
00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:54,800
Keep your eyes on the kids...

443
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:57,510
and make sure they don't
lower the temperature on their own.

444
00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:58,600
- Yes.
- Yes.

445
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:04,540
Sir.

446
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:11,380
Who did this?

00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:15,290
Who did this?

448
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:18,390
The students...

449
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:19,450
No.

450
00:31:19,730 --> 00:31:21,670
No, it wasn't them. Stay quiet.

451
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:23,470
I left it out there
for just a moment...

452
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:25,470
to let it get some sunlight
while I go to the restroom.

453
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:29,200
It has to be one of the teachers.

454
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,040
Come out and tell the truth.

455
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:33,130
Who did something like this?

456
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:35,570
This person just cut the flower.

457
00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:37,380
This is a very horrible person.

458
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:40,080
Who was it?

459
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:43,950
Will you be like this?

460
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:46,010
Who in the world did this?

461
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:47,350
Ms. Joo!

462
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,890
It was Ms. Joo Seo Yeon.

463
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:18,760
Was it bad?

464
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,160
That flower doesn't cost much.

465
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:24,050
Why is he so harsh on you?

466
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:26,600
What's with Mr. Lee?

467
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:28,730
I was about to come out.

468
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:31,470
But I was turned into
a shameless woman because of him.

469
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:34,130
Exactly. Why did he do that?
He looks like a fine person.

470
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:37,380
I knew it.
You can never trust hot guys.

471
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,380
Let's go.

472
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:44,220
Anyway, are you coming on Saturday?

473
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:46,790
Didn't you get the text?

474
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:48,080
Our middle school reunion.

475
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:50,510
- Is that this week?
- Yes.

476
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:52,080
Of course, I'll go.

477
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:55,130
I can eat as much as I want after
paying a fee of just 10 dollars.

478
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:57,100
All of them aren't much,

479
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,850
so I'll put on pants
with a rubber band waist.

480
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:00,830
- Yes!
- Yes!

481
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,170
Keep the drinks coming!

482
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:08,060
The 2nd round!
The 3rd round! The 4th round!

483
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:15,850
Why would I go there?

484
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:17,580
Come on.

485
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,150
You came back after 15 years.

486
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:20,810
Come by to say hi.

487
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:22,040
I'm hanging up. I'm busy.

488
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:24,390
You aren't. I can tell
you're working out by your panting.

489
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:25,720
Did you check the contract?

490
00:33:25,890 --> 00:33:27,620
How dare you try to trick me?

491
00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:29,330
An exclusive contract
for three years?

492
00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:30,420
Who says I'll do that?

493
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:31,420
You saw it?

494
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:34,690
I put it in the smallest font,
but you have good eyes.

495
00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:36,170
Write it up again and send it over.

496
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:38,840
If you try to trick me again,
it's really over.

497
00:33:40,170 --> 00:33:42,860
Hey, it's me, Park Hyun Soo.

498
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:45,370
People are lined up
to be signed with my agency.

499
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,670
Then go ask them.

500
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:49,300
All right, fine.

501
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,540
I'll send the contract again.

502
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,460
Anyway, are you sure
you aren't coming?

503
00:34:00,050 --> 00:34:01,460
Are you? Are...

504
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:03,230
Hello? Hey.

505
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:07,360
Darn it. What a cold jerk.

506
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,170
Seok Min. Seok Min?

507
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:12,469
Try to be bolder.

508
00:34:12,469 --> 00:34:14,860
Hey, you're good looking,
so let's show it off a little more.

509
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:46,190
You jerk. Hey!

510
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:55,670
What is this?

511
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:59,040
It's me, Mom!

512
00:34:59,350 --> 00:35:00,790
Where are you going?

513
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:02,680
Ms. Oh.

514
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:09,850
How did you know I came?

515
00:35:09,850 --> 00:35:11,790
I'm your mom.

516
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:14,420
I always know your whereabouts.

517
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:15,670
It was Hyun Soo, wasn't it?

518
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:19,190
Is Hyun Soo doing well?

519
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:23,640
You haven't changed one bit.

520
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:27,210
You should've contacted us first
once you came.

521
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:28,980
How dare you sneak in here?

522
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,280
- Did you get hurt?
- It hurts.

523
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:33,540
Don't tell Grandma that I'm here.
I'll be leaving soon.

524
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:35,390
You won't be able to leave
that easily.

525
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:37,290
She's waiting for you.

526
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:38,290
I can beat her.

527
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:40,110
It won't be easy this time.

528
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:43,290
- She's made a list.
- A list?

529
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:45,290
A list of the positions
you could take.

530
00:35:45,290 --> 00:35:48,290
I don't want to. There's Kang Hee.
Don't pull me into this.

531
00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:50,360
There's no use whining here.

532
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,100
I have no power, you know?

533
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:58,910
Me neither.

534
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:02,350
Forget it. I can take
the flight tonight.

535
00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:04,040
You'll be banned from leaving
due to embezzlement.

536
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:06,040
Embezzlement? What do you mean?

537
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:09,240
She's already prepared evidence.

538
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,720
It's 10 million dollars' worth.

539
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,250
Do you think the police will believe
the fake evidence?

540
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:16,590
Do you think they'd believe her...

541
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:19,030
or you, who has no money?

542
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,560
Why are you doing this to me?

543
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,670
If you're upset, confront her.

544
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:24,690
Mom!

545
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:26,930
You only call me like that
when you need my help.

546
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:28,640
Forget it and get ready.

547
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,860
She's waiting.

548
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:33,710
Come on. Get dressed.

549
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:37,650
I'm so irritated.

550
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:41,720
Honey!

551
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:44,680
- Go with him.
- I'm injured, you know?

552
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:52,900
Yes, Mother.
We'll be bringing him over soon.

553
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:56,670
This is the latest model.
I think it'll suit your son.

554
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,100
Would you like to get in?

555
00:36:58,100 --> 00:36:59,930
- Sure.
- Here.

556
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:03,670
Young people enjoy driving fast.

557
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:05,600
If you look here...

558
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,210
Having rich parents is quite nice.

559
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,800
I can't believe a 20-year-old
will be driving that car.

560
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:13,350
- He's a good boy.
- What do you mean?

561
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:15,620
He's not complaining about his car.

562
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:19,160
Those who have rich parents
should be grateful.

563
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:20,860
It's so irritating to see
young punks acting like...

564
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:21,860
they're all that.

565
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:26,320
Come on. You're better off
than them.

566
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,030
Your face.

567
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:32,590
If I were you, I would've become
a celebrity.

568
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:34,610
I bet entertainment agencies
tried to pick you up.

569
00:37:34,610 --> 00:37:37,830
You're too handsome
for them to ignore.

570
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:39,070
Of course, they did.

571
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:40,940
If I had any interest,

572
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:43,280
Won Bin and Jung Woo Sung
would've been nothing.

573
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,440
Then why didn't you pursue it?

574
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,920
There was an easier way
to earn money.

575
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,020
Which was?

576
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:51,310
Leeching off of wealthy families.

577
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:06,400
Who is that?

578
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:09,200
Kick her out,
but don't cause a scene.

579
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,270
Okay.

580
00:38:24,950 --> 00:38:26,390
- Did you make a reservation?
- What?

581
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:28,760
You need to make one beforehand.
This way, please.

582
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:31,590
This way. Please make
a reservation first.

583
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:34,000
Goodbye.

584
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:35,960
Goodbye.

585
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:17,200
What's the point of having
a lot of money?

586
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:22,800
It's so not fun.

587
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,440
Hi.

588
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:29,790
My goodness.

589
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:31,810
What are you doing?

590
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:37,400
I was waiting.

591
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,050
For me?

592
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:41,820
Yes.

593
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,060
Is Ms. Joo very upset?

594
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:50,780
Her?

595
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:54,110
Don't worry about it.
She's not the type to bear grudges.

596
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:59,340
Why did you tell on her
if you were going to be like this?

597
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:00,520
You should've stayed silent.

598
00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:02,810
Exactly.

599
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:04,580
What?

600
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:10,550
What was that?

601
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:14,220
What a pity. He looked fine
on the outside.

602
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:19,500
There. Make sure it doesn't get wet.

603
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,500
Okay.

604
00:40:21,330 --> 00:40:22,560
- Thank you.
- No problem.

605
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:31,710
- Okay.
- Okay.

606
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:35,040
All right, then.
Who wants to go first?

607
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:37,890
Anyone can go first.

608
00:40:40,490 --> 00:40:41,490
Yes?

609
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,160
Today will be a bit difficult.

610
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:48,420
Okay, I'll be there on time.

611
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:50,190
Bye.

612
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:01,910
Joo Hee?

613
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:04,750
She was kicked out a few days ago
for not paying rent.

614
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:08,250
Her landlord is really horrible.

615
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:12,120
Where are you?

616
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:14,320
Okay.

617
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:16,860
Why would I do that?

618
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:19,690
I'm sure you guys know where she is.

619
00:41:19,690 --> 00:41:21,420
And everyone likes you.

620
00:41:23,790 --> 00:41:26,290
Are you finally acknowledging
my popularity?

621
00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:27,910
One minute.

622
00:41:33,010 --> 00:41:36,010
Hey, do you know
where Lee Joo Hee,

623
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:37,620
our classmate, works these days?

624
00:41:38,210 --> 00:41:41,420
Okay. Let me know. Bye.

625
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:45,290
- How long will it take?
- About 10 minutes.

626
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:46,580
That soon?

627
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:48,290
This friend of mine knows everyone.

628
00:41:49,050 --> 00:41:50,690
Who is it? Is it a classmate?

629
00:41:50,690 --> 00:41:53,590
Come on, now. A cop never
discloses his source.

630
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:55,290
That's enough.

631
00:41:55,290 --> 00:41:58,190
Are you even practicing?
You're a terrible singer.

632
00:41:58,830 --> 00:42:02,110
Seo Yeon, I'm in charge
of looking good.

633
00:42:02,110 --> 00:42:05,010
The main vocalist and the dancer
of our team will be by my side.

634
00:42:05,330 --> 00:42:06,380
Okay?

635
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:09,540
You'll only snap out of it
once you start gaining haters.

636
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:12,380
The number of haters you have
shows how popular you are.

637
00:42:12,570 --> 00:42:13,940
You have no idea.

638
00:42:14,290 --> 00:42:17,550
- Seok Min!
- Seok Min!

639
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:18,790
- Seok Min!
- Seok Min!

640
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:20,620
That's Park Seok Min!

641
00:42:21,490 --> 00:42:23,320
- Gosh.
- Where are you going?

642
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:26,360
What's gotten into you?
You're not fazed by handsome guys.

643
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:28,460
That looks so scrumptious.

644
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:30,420
What?

645
00:42:32,370 --> 00:42:35,700
That's really expensive.
Tell him to give it to you.

646
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:37,330
You're from the same agency,
so you must be close.

647
00:42:37,330 --> 00:42:38,910
That's embarrassing. Stop it.

648
00:42:43,170 --> 00:42:45,070
- Seok Min!
- Seok Min!

649
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:48,120
- He left!
- Gosh.

650
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:50,020
That's enough!

651
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:51,760
Do you know how messed up you are?

652
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:54,080
You're very messed up.

653
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:04,090
My friend has no idea either.

654
00:43:04,690 --> 00:43:05,690
Bye.

655
00:43:08,330 --> 00:43:09,870
You should never pursue acting.

656
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:15,340
Has she gone insane?

657
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:23,580
Someone's not here yet.

658
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:24,810
He's almost here.

659
00:43:25,290 --> 00:43:29,220
Mother, since Kang Woo's here,

660
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:31,220
should we grill some Korean beef?

661
00:43:31,790 --> 00:43:33,900
Hey, do you want some?

662
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:35,170
Not really.

663
00:43:35,170 --> 00:43:36,190
You little...

664
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:44,910
I do.

665
00:43:45,170 --> 00:43:47,200
I'm sick of eating American beef.

666
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:49,470
I'll grill some.

667
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:51,620
- Sit down.
- What?

668
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:52,880
Go on, then.

669
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,990
Oh, my. I'm so honored.

670
00:43:56,210 --> 00:43:58,080
- Come here.
- Right.

671
00:43:58,310 --> 00:44:00,160
Bring out the meat.

672
00:44:00,210 --> 00:44:02,320
All we have are vegetables.

673
00:44:04,950 --> 00:44:07,000
- I'm sorry for being late.
- You're here.

674
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,370
- Hey.
- Hi.

675
00:44:09,090 --> 00:44:10,090
Sit down.

676
00:44:10,090 --> 00:44:13,040
You're right on time. Sit down.

677
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,960
You seem to have lost weight.

678
00:44:16,170 --> 00:44:17,670
Really? I didn't.

679
00:44:17,670 --> 00:44:20,040
Min Hyuk, it won't take long.

680
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:22,470
Your uncle will grill
the best Korean beef ever.

681
00:44:22,570 --> 00:44:23,610
All right.

682
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:27,920
Are your parents alive and well?

683
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:30,540
Yes, they're building a school
in Kenya.

684
00:44:31,390 --> 00:44:34,390
They don't even make much money
doing that.

685
00:44:35,030 --> 00:44:37,820
He was always unique
ever since he was young.

686
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:42,900
They're good-hearted people,
you know?

687
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,430
Of course, you're happy.

688
00:44:44,430 --> 00:44:46,740
Your brother has no interest
in taking over the company.

689
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:49,330
Once I die, it'll all be yours
to take.

690
00:44:49,330 --> 00:44:51,800
Come on, now.

691
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:53,930
You'll live longer than I do.

692
00:44:54,610 --> 00:44:56,410
Min Hyuk, eat up.

693
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:59,040
Right. I should grill more meat.

694
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:01,180
That's enough. Sit down.

695
00:45:01,890 --> 00:45:04,150
Mother.
But I only grilled one slice.

696
00:45:04,150 --> 00:45:06,120
If I eat too much meat,
I'll get indigestion.

697
00:45:08,890 --> 00:45:09,890
Turn off the grill.

698
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:16,920
You guys...

699
00:45:17,270 --> 00:45:19,460
should repay me
for the investment I made on you.

700
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:24,670
Min Hyuk, until when will you work
at that school?

701
00:45:24,670 --> 00:45:27,140
You're wasting your talents.

702
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:28,880
What on earth are you doing?

703
00:45:29,570 --> 00:45:32,210
Mother, can we talk about this
after we feed them first?

704
00:45:32,210 --> 00:45:33,210
Stop.

705
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:35,750
You.

706
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:38,450
If you don't want to be a doctor,

707
00:45:38,450 --> 00:45:39,760
work for my company.

708
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:42,630
The same goes for you, Kang Woo.

709
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:46,000
I will not choose
a department for you to join.

710
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,630
Choose a department...

711
00:45:47,630 --> 00:45:50,300
that you could excel in on your own.

712
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:53,870
All right. Let's eat.

713
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:55,340
- Okay.
- Okay.

714
00:45:56,340 --> 00:45:57,430
Enjoy your meal.

715
00:45:59,410 --> 00:46:00,580
- All right.
- What?

716
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:06,970
If you eat a lot of meat at once,

717
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:08,550
you'll get indigestion.

718
00:46:09,890 --> 00:46:11,390
Don't worry about me.

719
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:15,160
This is good.

720
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:17,690
You're taking two slices at once.

721
00:46:17,990 --> 00:46:20,560
Honey, can't we grill some more?

722
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:22,100
Don't be ridiculous.

723
00:46:26,170 --> 00:46:28,170
Well, I'm glad
that I'm not the only one...

725

What happened to you?
She used to adore you.

726
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:35,700
My gosh. I know, right?

727
00:46:40,270 --> 00:46:42,650
So do you have a girlfriend?

728
00:46:43,090 --> 00:46:45,620
- No.
- Anyone you're interested in?

729
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:55,670
I guess there is someone.

730
00:46:56,630 --> 00:46:58,960
You still can't lie, can you?

731
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,460
Why can't I get it off?

732
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:05,610
You haven't changed either.

733
00:47:05,610 --> 00:47:06,640
What? What do you mean?

734
00:47:16,010 --> 00:47:18,360
Seriously? She can't come here
dressed like that.

735
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:21,750
What? What is it?

736
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:24,090
Gosh, where is he going?

737
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:27,100
Darn it. It's not coming off.

738
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:28,900

Please leave.

I'm sorry for the commotion.

742

Please leave.

Joo Hee... I mean,

00:47:40,810 --> 00:47:44,510
I heard that Lee Joo Hee, a junior
in Class Four, is working here.

747
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:47,470
Is this true?

748
00:47:48,090 --> 00:47:51,480
Well, we didn't know she was
a minor. She brought a fake ID.

749
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:52,620
Is she here?

750
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:54,250
No, she quit two days ago.

751
00:47:58,330 --> 00:47:59,990
You paid her for her labor, right?

752
00:47:59,990 --> 00:48:00,990
Pardon?

753
00:48:01,690 --> 00:48:03,460
You gave her the money
you promised, right?

754
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:04,900
I'll check with her.

755
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:06,960
And if you didn't pay her
as promised, I'll come back.

00:53:45,930 --> 00:53:47,310
What should I do?

823
00:53:48,050 --> 00:53:49,050
Can you...

824
00:53:50,110 --> 00:53:51,110
treat this?

825
00:53:51,110 --> 00:53:52,510
What a dog-like situation.

826
00:53:53,170 --> 00:53:54,170
Pardon?

827
00:53:59,060 --> 00:54:01,060
I was once bitten by a dog.

828
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:02,860
So I hated dogs.

829
00:54:03,060 --> 00:54:05,400
But I love dogs now
more than anyone.

830
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:09,720
So you're in a dog-like situation.

831
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:13,530
- I see.
- I raised a dog on purpose...

832
00:54:13,730 --> 00:54:15,610
to treat my trauma against dogs.

833
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:18,110
To overcome your trauma,

834
00:54:18,110 --> 00:54:21,970
facing the cause of your trauma
could be a way.

835
00:54:24,350 --> 00:54:25,420
Then,

836
00:54:26,420 --> 00:54:29,890
are you telling me to face
the people who bullied me?

837
00:54:30,820 --> 00:54:33,890
Giving it a try at least once
wouldn't hurt.

- Ma'am. More side dishes, please.
- Give me a second. Hold on.

840
00:54:46,730 --> 00:54:48,640
Ma'am. Is there a fire?

841
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:51,430
It just broke down.
I'll get it fixed soon.

842

Give me a second.

843

- Ma'am, one more plate of this.

845

Hey, how can you eat right now?

848
00:55:07,450 --> 00:55:08,920
You're so clueless.

849
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:12,020
When you have meat, make sure
you have enough smell of meat...

850
00:55:12,020 --> 00:55:14,130
on your shirt so that you can have
another bowl of rice with it.

851
00:55:14,130 --> 00:55:15,400
You have no idea, don't you?

852
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:16,460
Agreed.

853
00:55:16,460 --> 00:55:18,170
Who would ever marry you two?

854
00:55:18,260 --> 00:55:19,840
I feel bad for him.

855
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:22,230
Marry us?
Why would I wait around for that?

856
00:55:22,230 --> 00:55:23,610
I'm going to bring him myself.

857
00:55:23,610 --> 00:55:24,840
You're unbelievable.

858
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:27,640
You're the one who got clingy to me
after you found out I was a teacher.

That... That's...

860
00:55:28,910 --> 00:55:31,740
You're making the meat taste worse.
Can you go over there?

861
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:34,270

Hey, let's eat.
Let's find her after we eat.

Okay. I need to eat
to have the energy.

Me? I'm at work.

869
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:13,360
What? You said we should
go to the reunion.

870
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:15,160
I didn't go
because you said you won't.

871
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:16,330
You really went?

A way to overcome your trauma is...

874
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:26,530
to face the reason
that caused your trauma...

875
00:56:26,530 --> 00:56:27,870
without avoiding it.

Why is he so confident
when he's really late?

I haven't seen you before.

it's your first time here.

891
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:16,380
I'll take over the business
that my family runs.

892
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:19,670
Business? What kind of business?

- It's nothing much.

I don't like you...

913
00:59:54,310 --> 00:59:55,550
because you're ugly...
