You...

You have to get out of here.

15
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:04,879
- Okay?
- Dad.

Don't look at us and go.

Mom and Dad will be fine.

26
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:01,410
So don't...

27
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:05,270
Don't look back.

28

Can you promise me?

29
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:18,610
Good girl.

30
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:26,390
Okay. Go now.

31

What do you...

45

What do you mean?

46
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,680
An accident?

47
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,310

48

Okay.

49

What is it?

50

A car accident.

51
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:36,720
They got into a car accident.

52

What?

53
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:41,690
I'm not sure. Let's go.

54
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:00,250
My gosh, man.

55
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,380
That's so crazy.

58
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,540
What are you doing?

59
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,260
Goodness, stop it.

60
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:22,700
I don't remember what happened.

61
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,830
- What's with you?
- Who are you?

62
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:27,000
- Who do you think you are?
- My goodness!

63

- Let him go!
- You! Hey! Let him go!

66
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,490
- Let him go!
- What are you doing?

67

Goodness, are you okay?

68
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:37,620
- I'm going to kill you!
- Stop it!

69
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,380
- What's with you?
- Stop it! Won Seok!

70
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,690
I'll beat him to death.

71
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:42,290
Won Seok!

72
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,680
Are you a thug or what?

73
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,050
Handle it by the law!

74
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:06,320
- Just deal with it by the law!
- Shut your mouth.

75
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:09,920
If you say another word,

76
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:12,190
I'll kill you.

How's Seo Yeon?

78
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:22,300
She doesn't remember yet.

79
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:27,370
You should see our father...

80
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,830
one last time too.

81
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:43,510
I can't.

82
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,010
I can't do that.

83
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:50,750
How can I see him?

84
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:54,820
How...

85
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:59,070
How can I see him?

86
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,240
I was supposed to feel guilty,

87
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,840
sad, and angry.

88
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:10,820
But I dumped it
on my older brothers...

89
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:15,750
Mom...

90
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:21,230
and my baby brother,

91
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:24,930
and lived in oblivion.

92
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,140
Going out for a run?

93
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:55,020
It's not that
we didn't tell you on purpose...

94
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:03,730
I understand why you did that.

95
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,310
I'm going for a run.

96
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:14,980
It's not your fault.

97
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:19,320
It's not your fault.

98
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:21,820
Don't get any weird ideas.

99
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:35,190
She definitely thinks
everything is her fault, right?

100
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:38,960
Man, it's all over.

101
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:43,070
What's going on?

102
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,880
What's over?

103
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,440
Why are you up already?

104
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,000
Go to sleep. Go back to sleep.

105
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:54,440
What's going on?

106
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:08,300
I'm in here,
so don't turn off the lights.

107
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:43,070
Joo Hee.

108
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,460
Did I wake you up?

109
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:54,700
Are all parents...

110
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,280
like that?

111
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,440
What?

112
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,320
Are they willing...

113
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:05,710
to sacrifice themselves
for their kids?

114
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:09,530
Can they die in their kids' place?

115
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:11,090
Well...

116
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:13,720
I think so.

117
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:18,860
Are your parents like that too?

118
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:23,140
I don't remember much about my dad.

119
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:26,140
But my mom was like that.

120
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:30,150
In order to leave as much money
as possible for my sister and me,

121
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:33,470
she worked at a restaurant until
the day before she passed away.

122
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,820
She passed away?

123
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:39,790
Yes.

124
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:42,430
She was very ill.

125
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:54,270
Why did you ask that
all of a sudden?

126
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:57,010
I didn't know
parents were like that.

127
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:00,700
I had no idea.

128
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,950
I'm sure we'll get along just fine.

129
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:19,530
Everything will turn out fine.

130
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,030
I'll come with you.

131
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:27,360
I need to see this guy
who's giving you so much trouble.

132
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:30,070
Wake up.

133
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,040
Seo Yeon.

134
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,730
Dad...

135
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:36,470
I'm sorry.

136
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,970
Mom and Dad will be fine.

137
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,920
Don't look back.

138
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:46,190
Can you promise me?

[Lee Kang Woo]

140

The receiver cannot be reached.
You will be directed to voicemail.

141
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:22,260
Is she still sleeping?

142
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:26,060
My heart was too fluttering
for me to sleep well.

143
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,090
My gosh.

144
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:29,800
I'm going to take you to school!

145
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:40,780
What? Mr. Chief Director.

146
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:42,600
"Mister"?

147
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:47,740
Hey, I'm the same age
as your sister.

148
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,160
Where is she?

149
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:53,850
- She went to school.
- Already?

150
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,950
- Sir.
- Don't address me like that!

151
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:00,450
Are you dating her?

152
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:02,860
"Dating"?

153
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:08,510
Well... I guess so.

154
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:09,510
Why?

155
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,570
You're rich and handsome, so why?

156
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:16,150
I guess you're too young
to be aware of her charms.

157
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:20,740
But then again,
it'd be really weird...

158
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:23,190
if you knew them.

159
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:25,080
Anyway...

160
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:29,060
I hope we get along well,

Yes.

Yes!

165
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:43,600
You're so simple-minded.

166
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,150
- Get out.
- What?

00:13:57,690 --> 00:14:00,060
Here? Aren't you coming?

168

Are you not going to work?

- No.
- Why not?

170
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,670
Just because.

171
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:13,230
Have you been sacked?

172
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:15,310
Are you jobless?

173
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:17,570
No! Go tell your sister to come out!

174

I don't want her to date
someone jobless.

175
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:23,240
Why would she date someone jobless?

176
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:26,610
Hey, that's not true.
I'm not jobless!

177
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,340
What a rude brat!

178
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:34,690
Seo Yeon.

179
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:40,190
The ex-chief director is waiting
in front of the school.

180
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,860
By the way,

181
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:46,460
I thought you hated
good-looking men.

182
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,910
Go, now. He's waiting for you.

183
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,740
Okay.

184
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,810
Go to class.

185
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:02,020
Seo Jun.

186
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:13,320
I'm sorry.

187
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:30,570
My gosh, I got goosebumps.

188
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,740
What's wrong with her?

189
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:34,940
Gosh.

190
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:37,690
Do I look okay?

191
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,710
Hey!

192
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:45,450
What are you doing here?

193
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:47,760
I heard there was a suspicious car.

194
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,800
I came to check
whether it was a pervert or not.

195
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,030
"Pervert"?

196
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,940
Who said that?

197
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:56,200
Are you protesting
since you've been sacked?

198
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,070
No, I'm here to see Seo Yeon.

199
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:02,910
It's her.

200
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:07,940
Let's meet next time.
I'm busy right now.

201
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,060
Move your car right now.

202
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:21,820
I wish I worked here as well.

203
00:16:57,430 --> 00:17:00,670
Did the ex-chief director leave?

204
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:03,570
Yes, he just did.

205
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:06,510
Was he that obedient?

206
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:09,440
With that temper of his,
he must've put up a fight.

207
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:14,210
I mean, it's nothing much.

208
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:16,420
It wasn't anything intentional.

209
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:20,760
But we told the chairwoman...

210
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:23,079
- a bit about him.
- A tiny bit.

211
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:26,089
- Yes, just a little bit.
- Just this much.

212
00:17:26,089 --> 00:17:28,300
Don't worry. You'll be fine.

213
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,770
Why didn't she appoint
such a wonderful man like you...

214
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:33,240
from the start?

215
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,510
Why did she appoint Kang Woo?

216
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:37,860
I know, right?

217
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:40,630
- I just can't understand.
- Me neither.

218
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,710
Anyway, we'll go now.

219
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:45,050
Thank you, sir.

220
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:48,840
Goodness.

221
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,790
All right.

222
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,760
- Thank you, sir.
- You never know what will happen.

223
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,120
Wait up.

224
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:12,370
I'm sure Aunt didn't do anything
just yet.

225
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:22,640
What are you doing?

226
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:26,060
I need to take care of my own son.

227
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:28,680
Min Hyuk is
whom you cherish the most.

228
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:34,820
Are you sulking because I removed
Kang Woo from his position?

229
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:36,500
Yes, you're right.

230
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:40,860
Can you really not trust him?

231
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:44,040
He's never proven himself.

232
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:47,830
Exactly. That's exactly why...

233
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:50,070
I'll be taking care of him
from now on.

234
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:53,640
And is your definition of that
scheduling his blind date?

235
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,850
There are so many wonderful women
out there, so why?

236
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,180
What?

237
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:20,830
Why is your wife so upset? Why?

238
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:23,070
Is it because I'm bringing Kang Woo
into the headquarters?

239
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:24,750
No, it's not that.

240
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,950
Kang Woo must be dating someone.

241
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:29,990
- What?
- That's why she's been so mad.

242
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:31,580
What kind of girl is she?

243
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:32,910
- I don't know either.
- Who is she?

244
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:34,220
- Hear me out, Mom.
- Okay.

245
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:36,260
You and I should be
on the same team.

246
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:37,850
And if we help Kang Woo,

247
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:40,000
- Kang Woo will get...
- Mi Ja!

248
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,390
- Mi Ja!
- What is it?

249
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:43,730
- What are you doing, Mom?
- What's this all about?

250
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:45,070
- Stop it, Mom.
- Mi Ja.

251
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:46,470
Oh, no. This is awful.

252
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:48,540
I made this worse.

253
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:50,430
Kang Woo. I should tell him.

254
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:52,870
Mom. Mom! Goodness.

255
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:55,340
The water.
The water is boiling. Hold on.

256
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:57,480
It's boiling. Wait.
Where is that thing?

257
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,870
Goodness.

258
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:06,260
You are indeed talented.

259
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:07,760
Gosh. I can picture...

260
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,030
Park Seok Min and Hi-Seven
in these outfits.

261
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:14,350
Gosh, the smell of money.

262
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:20,160
What's on your mind?

263
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,270
We shared our feelings...

264
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:23,770
and had a good time.

265
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,370
We even went on a date.

266
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:27,980
How could she not call me back
the next day?

267
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:29,950
Is it about Seo Yeon?

268
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:32,320
Hey, she's not like you.

269
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,570
She must be in class.

270
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:36,380
What's she doing during her breaks?
What about her lunchtime?

271
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:38,850
Texting me or giving me a call
isn't that hard.

272
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:40,760
- How many times did you reach out?
- 10 times.

273
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,150
You sent 10 text messages?

274
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:44,490
No, I called 10 times.
I sent 20 text messages.

275
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:45,820
How sickening.

276
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,700
Gosh, how sickening.

277
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,390
- Sickening?
- Come on. Know when to stop.

278
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:51,890
She'll get sick of you and run to
the hills before this goes anywhere.

279
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:54,860
Is that what happened?

280
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:57,540
[Idiot]

281
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:00,480
Gosh, he's so sickening.

282
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:05,320
Hyun Soo keeps calling me.

283
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:10,110
I guess Hyun Soo really likes you.

284
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:14,460
It's hard to resist my charms
once men fall for me.

285
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,150
I'm like a swamp.

286
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:19,800
What's wrong?
You don't like him at all?

287
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,800
Well,

288
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:24,160
he's not a bad guy by nature,

289
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:27,270
but I'm not sure.
Something doesn't feel right.

290
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,240
I could tell he has
a lot of women around him.

291
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:32,810
And I don't feel comfortable...

292
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:35,100
because his label
is bigger than I thought.

293
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,450
I thought you were interested
in men's assets.

294
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:40,570
Now that I see a man with assets
beyond my expectations,

295
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:42,550
I do feel a bit intimidated
as I'm only human.

296
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:45,260
I don't want men who are richer
than me by 10 places.

297
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:47,790
3 to 4 places higher
would be perfect for me.

298
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:54,060
I'm talking about me.
That's just me.

299
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:56,420
This has nothing to do
with you and Kang Woo, right?

300
00:21:57,570 --> 00:21:59,630
Hey, I'm getting hungry.

301
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:01,270
Let's go steal some food
from the Health Office.

302
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:04,570
- No, I don't want to.
- What? Why not?

303
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,510
Just because.

304
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:10,370
He's not the school doctor anymore.
He's the chief director now.

305
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:12,820
We can't be casual like before.

306
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:16,750
I don't believe it.

307
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:19,650
Did Mr. Lee finally...

308
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:34,240
Seo Yeon won't come here now.

309
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:39,430
Even if you prepare snacks for her,

310
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:42,070
she won't be coming here anymore,
Mr. Chief Director.

311
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:43,510
Why not?

312
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:44,750
Do you have to ask?

313
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:47,370
Why were you confident enough
to confess your feelings to her?

314
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:50,450
Don't get the wrong idea.

315
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:53,080
You know that she's not the type
to discuss this with other people.

316
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,820
I catch on really quickly.
That's all.

317
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,920
Was it your confidence or arrogance?

318
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:01,530
My stubbornness.

319
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,200
I thought so.

320
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:05,700
It's not just anyone. It's Kang Woo.

321
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,000
You guys are cousins.

322
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:11,430
Stop pursuing her, so Seo Yeon
doesn't feel uncomfortable.

323
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,400
I'm not sure.

324
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:27,760
I'm a bit selfish.

325
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:30,580
I don't like it when things
go well for other people.

326
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:41,810
Gosh. That line with that face.
That was super cool.

327
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:48,170
Goodness, does he have his phone
glued to him all day?

328
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:51,170
What?

329
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,380
What is it? Talk. You called me.

330
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:58,110
I didn't know
you'd actually pick up.

331
00:23:58,110 --> 00:23:59,790
I called you out of habit.

332
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:01,730
Are you kidding me?

333
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:03,850
- Bye.
- Let's have a meal.

334
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:05,920

we never had a meal together.

No.

to buy her a meal a while ago.

Gosh. She doesn't like money
or food. What am I supposed to do?

Good morning. Hello, Seo Yeon.
Aren't you on your break now?

Did you eat? Did you eat a lot?

- Well...
- As you know,

I don't have a lot of friends
because I'm wary of people.

You probably figured that out
at the meeting.

Can't you eat with me?

00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,520
Anytime.

502
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:49,330
That easily?

503
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:59,180
She's pretending to be okay,
isn't she?

504
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:00,710
You're sober already?

505
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:02,970
I get drunk quickly,
and I sober up quickly too.

506
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:11,380
Keep your eyes on her!

507
00:37:11,790 --> 00:37:14,110
Things look
very dangerous for her right now!

508
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:25,230
You weren't asleep yet?

509
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,310
Don't worry.

510
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:31,970
I'll protect you.

511
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,280
They have the same facial features.

512
00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:42,950
It's the same guy.

513
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,480
I asked them to go.

514
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:50,710
It's because of me.

515
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:53,380
They passed away because of me.

516
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,720
Because of me.

517
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,250
Seo Yeon.

518
00:39:05,730 --> 00:39:06,990
It's because of me.

519
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,440
They passed away because of me.

520
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:12,310
No, it's because of him.

521
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,740
He's the grandson of Shinhwa Food?

522
00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:27,710
What do you do
when you have free time?

523
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:31,930
Answer me.

524
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,200
What?

525
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,070
What do you do
when you have free time?

526
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:38,730
What was that for?

527
00:39:38,730 --> 00:39:40,070
I heard you got sacked...

528
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:42,310
and will be working
at the headquarters.

529
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:44,970
That's the report
for the last quarter.

530
00:39:44,970 --> 00:39:47,130
- Read that.
- Why would I?

531
00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:48,780
You know what I'm doing.

532
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:49,840
And are you doing that right now?

533
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:52,550
How could you have free time
when you're working on that?

534
00:39:52,610 --> 00:39:54,240
You must be taking it easy.

535
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,450
Since you said you didn't want
any of my money,

536
00:39:56,450 --> 00:39:58,160
I thought
you were taking it seriously.

537
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,660
I mean...

538
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:05,220
I wasn't talking
about my working time.

539
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:07,720
Who was that woman last time
at the police station?

540
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:10,720
- It's someone I like.
- Which family? Name?

541
00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:12,760
Joo family's only daughter
among many sons.

542
00:40:14,570 --> 00:40:16,960
I may be able to do that,
but not you.

543
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:19,840
I can pick whoever I want,
but not you.

544
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:21,410
What do you mean?

545
00:40:21,410 --> 00:40:24,950
Can you introduce her
to Mom and Grandma this instant?

546
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:27,510
- Of course.
- You're so selfish.

547
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,820
What do you have?

548
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,660
Have you proven yourself
regarding your work?

549
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:34,250
Are you financially independent?

550
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:38,200
Being so reckless could hurt her.

551
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,120
Don't underestimate Mom.

552
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:43,070
When it comes to her children,
she's stronger than anyone else.

553
00:40:43,070 --> 00:40:44,360
Especially if it's concerning you.

554
00:40:56,050 --> 00:40:57,180
Kang Woo.

555
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:02,380
No, you're right.
You made me realize it.

556
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:04,420
You're right.

557
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:06,710
You don't need to comfort me.

558
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:07,820
What do you mean?

559
00:41:08,830 --> 00:41:10,290
- Pick that up.
- What?

560
00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:14,090
What? Okay.

561
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:25,130
I'm all for it.

562
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:28,640
No matter who you pick,
I support you completely.

563
00:41:29,470 --> 00:41:31,710
So please do the same for me.

564
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:35,610
Deal?

565
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:39,460
Deal.

566
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:04,710
Sir, are you waiting
for someone's call?

567
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:07,370
No. Don't be ridiculous.

568
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:16,290
I should've dropped her
in front of her house.

569
00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:18,350
Did she trip on her way home?

570
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,570
What if she busted her knees?

571
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:34,600
Lee Kang Hee speaking.

572
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:36,080
Are you okay?

573
00:42:36,410 --> 00:42:37,410
What?

574
00:42:41,590 --> 00:42:42,880
Mr. Joo Won Jae?

575
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:45,420
Did you go home safely that night?

576
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,010
Of course.

577
00:42:48,790 --> 00:42:52,250
I thought something happened
since you didn't call.

578
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:54,120
Have you been waiting?

579
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:56,590
What? Not really.

580
00:42:59,070 --> 00:43:00,630
Do you want to have dinner?

581
00:43:03,810 --> 00:43:05,230
If you already have plans,
then we could take a rain check.

582
00:43:05,230 --> 00:43:07,130
I have no plans.

583
00:43:07,310 --> 00:43:10,410
I didn't make any
because I was waiting for your call.

584
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:14,550
Whenever and wherever.
From 6 p.m. to 12 a.m.

585
00:43:14,610 --> 00:43:16,190
We've made a deal.

586
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:18,190
You're a hardworking employee.

587
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:20,850
I'm glad we've made a deal.

588
00:43:20,850 --> 00:43:24,190
Of course. I'm like no other.

589
00:43:24,190 --> 00:43:27,120
I'm quite competent, you see.

590
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:33,940
So...

591
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:36,540
I'll see you later tonight.

592
00:43:40,730 --> 00:43:41,910
I'm so embarrassed.

593
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:46,180
Did you have to go on and on
like that?

594
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:50,740
I'll see you later, Mr. Joo.

595
00:43:59,030 --> 00:44:00,720
You're so selfish.

596
00:44:01,030 --> 00:44:03,030
What do you have?

597
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:05,730
Have you proven yourself
regarding your work?

598
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:11,630
Okay!

599
00:44:18,870 --> 00:44:22,140
Let's meet in the evening.
I have something to...

600
00:44:23,510 --> 00:44:25,660
[Let's meet in the evening.
I have something to...]

601
00:44:26,850 --> 00:44:28,010
My gosh.

602
00:44:31,250 --> 00:44:32,430
Who are you?

603
00:44:48,450 --> 00:44:49,580
Aunt?

604
00:44:56,210 --> 00:44:58,820
I knew you were Mr. Lee's aunt.

605
00:44:58,820 --> 00:45:02,430
But I couldn't connect the dots
and think you were Kang Woo's mom.

606
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:06,490
Welcome.

607
00:45:11,070 --> 00:45:14,800
Come to think of it,
I saw you last time as well.

608
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:19,400
I'm such a fool. What a fool.

609
00:45:23,810 --> 00:45:26,110
By the way, what brings you here?

610
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:33,450
I heard you're dating my son.

611
00:45:33,650 --> 00:45:35,950
- What?
- Don't be so startled.

612
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:39,590
Did you think I'd never find out?

613
00:45:42,690 --> 00:45:43,860
I'll make it short.

614
00:45:44,890 --> 00:45:47,240
Break up with him.

615
00:45:47,970 --> 00:45:51,630
You shouldn't underestimate
our family.

616
00:45:51,810 --> 00:45:54,780
I understand that it'll be difficult
to end things with him.

617
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:59,140
That's why I'm going
to make it easier for you.

618
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:06,880
Okay, I'll do that.

619
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:13,090
I'm sorry for making you concerned.

620
00:46:18,330 --> 00:46:19,690
I mean...

621
00:46:28,810 --> 00:46:31,580
What? That was too easy.

622
00:46:40,450 --> 00:46:42,560
I'd prepared 10 envelopes.

623
00:46:45,690 --> 00:46:46,890
She didn't even take a look.

624
00:47:11,590 --> 00:47:13,490
This place is cozier
than I had thought.

625
00:47:18,150 --> 00:47:19,150
Are you okay?

626
00:47:22,030 --> 00:47:23,920
I saw my aunt.

627
00:47:27,090 --> 00:47:28,190
Don't worry.

628
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:31,770
Kang Woo will never let go of you.

629
00:47:34,930 --> 00:47:36,870
That is,
unless you let go of him first.

630
00:47:40,580 --> 00:47:41,670
He won't...

631
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:45,380
unless I give up first, right?

632
00:47:47,610 --> 00:47:50,380
Right.
He won't give up on you first.

633
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:56,660
Right. Please don't tell
Mi Kyung about this.

634
00:47:57,070 --> 00:47:58,570
It will upset her.

635
00:47:59,630 --> 00:48:01,500
Okay. Don't worry.

636
00:48:02,930 --> 00:48:04,270
Thank you.

637
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:12,750
I'm always grateful.

638
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:38,740
Mother, what if Kang Woo finds out?

639
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:40,930
You should have stopped her.

640
00:48:40,930 --> 00:48:43,940
Goodness. I had no choice
given the family she comes from.

641
00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:46,670
You also heard what Mr. Kim said.

642
00:48:47,050 --> 00:48:48,410
She lost her parents early
in life...

643
00:48:48,410 --> 00:48:49,640
and have half brothers.

644
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:51,440
Goodness.

645
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:54,260
Once he finds out, he'll be furious.

646
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:56,950
You know that Kang Woo can be
even more stubborn than Kang Hee...

647
00:48:56,950 --> 00:48:58,690
if he doesn't like something.

648
00:48:58,690 --> 00:49:02,420
That's why I just need to keep
your mouth shut.

649
00:49:02,420 --> 00:49:04,860
Mom, I have a meeting to attend to.

650
00:49:04,860 --> 00:49:06,160
- Sit down.
- Okay.

651
00:49:07,070 --> 00:49:09,200
Hand me your cellphone.

652
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:12,100
- Pardon?
- Until his problem is sorted out,

653
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:13,810
I'll keep your phone.

654
00:49:13,810 --> 00:49:15,840
Mom, I'm a working businessman.

655
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:17,280
I get a lot of work calls.

656
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:18,370
Now.

657
00:49:18,370 --> 00:49:19,720
But still.

658
00:49:20,170 --> 00:49:22,340
I must get some calls
related to work.

659
00:49:22,340 --> 00:49:23,340
Goodness.

660
00:49:24,250 --> 00:49:25,320
Honey.

661
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:27,290
What happened?

662
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:29,790
I'm not sure if she's bold...

663
00:49:29,790 --> 00:49:31,380
or stupid.

664
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:32,830
What do you mean?

665
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:35,390
She won't break up with him?

666
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,190
No.

667
00:49:37,190 --> 00:49:39,000
She obediently said that she would.

668
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,040
What?

669
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:43,130
How many envelopes did you give her?

670
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:50,310
None.

671
00:49:50,310 --> 00:49:51,400
What?

672
00:49:59,590 --> 00:50:00,590
Look who's here.

673
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:02,830
Is it because
you're the chief director?

674
00:50:03,290 --> 00:50:04,830
You got off work early.

675
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:07,650
You're not a better
chief director than me.

676
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:10,770
You look good.

677
00:50:12,890 --> 00:50:14,000
I came by just in case.

678
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,010
So you really have no idea.

679
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:20,340
What are you talking about?

680
00:50:21,170 --> 00:50:23,640
You don't know even if
someone next to you is in pain...

681
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:25,750
or is about to die.

682
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:30,380
What?

683
00:50:31,110 --> 00:50:32,290
Do you know...

684
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:35,680
what doctors must be
the most careful about in the OR?

685
00:50:37,420 --> 00:50:38,420
Pride.

686
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:42,360
Even a doctor who performed
the surgery hundreds of times...

687
00:50:42,470 --> 00:50:44,500
will make a mistake the moment
he feels proud...

688
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:45,800
of his competency.

689
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:48,810
It won't be that bad...

690
00:50:48,810 --> 00:50:50,630
if the doctor admits his mistake
and walks out.

691
00:50:51,540 --> 00:50:53,870
But once he begins to be stubborn
about it, it becomes a problem.

692
00:50:59,820 --> 00:51:01,340
What is your point?

693
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:05,090
Don't let your guard down.

694
00:51:06,110 --> 00:51:08,350
If you make a mistake,

695
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:10,490
I will never waste that chance.

696
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:25,070
Seriously? You already got off work?

697
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:28,080
She's been MIA the whole day too.

698
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:32,720
Darn it.

699
00:51:35,750 --> 00:51:37,750
Jung Ho, why didn't you
come to practice today?

700
00:51:38,820 --> 00:51:41,410
I told the dance teacher
that you were sick.

701
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:44,990
Call me as soon as you get this.

702
00:51:52,660 --> 00:51:55,390
Who are you? Why are you...

703
00:51:58,470 --> 00:51:59,540
Joo Hee?

704
00:52:05,910 --> 00:52:07,640
Look at you.

705
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:26,190
What?
No tutoring lesson today again?

706
00:52:26,190 --> 00:52:27,540
What? No.

707
00:52:28,070 --> 00:52:29,430
Ho Dol texted me.

708
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:32,630
Won Seok,
did you see Joo Hee just now?

709
00:52:33,130 --> 00:52:34,370
Why does she look like that?

710
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:37,080
- What do you mean?
- I mean...

711
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:39,480
Joo Hee didn't look like herself.

712
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:41,840
How is she supposed to look then?

713
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:43,140
Do you have to ask?

714
00:52:43,340 --> 00:52:45,250
Sneakers, pants, and short hair.

715
00:52:45,250 --> 00:52:48,090
But she was wearing makeup
and a skirt.

716
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:52,030
Forget it.

717
00:52:52,390 --> 00:52:54,500
What did your tutor say?

718
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:56,420
- What?
- Why couldn't he make it?

719
00:52:57,530 --> 00:52:59,860
He just said he couldn't.

720
00:53:00,590 --> 00:53:01,770
Is he sick or something?

721
00:53:16,180 --> 00:53:19,110
These babies
must be so suffocated here.

722
00:53:19,110 --> 00:53:22,350
When they look at other cars,
racing on the street,

723
00:53:22,590 --> 00:53:23,790
they must be jealous, right?

724
00:53:25,530 --> 00:53:26,620
Do you feel suffocated...

725
00:53:27,190 --> 00:53:28,690
in your office too?

726
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:36,540
I'm hungry.

727
00:53:37,130 --> 00:53:38,130
Come here.

728
00:53:41,130 --> 00:53:42,130
Take a seat.

729
00:53:43,340 --> 00:53:45,750
These are new.
So don't worry and put them on.

730
00:53:51,340 --> 00:53:52,450
Thank you.

731
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:53,990
What did you have for lunch?

732
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:56,490
I just had a glass of milk.

733
00:53:56,490 --> 00:53:58,350
I had a feeling.

734
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:02,970
This looks really good.

735
00:54:02,970 --> 00:54:05,590
I've been to a lot of restaurants
because I do sales.

736
00:54:05,590 --> 00:54:07,630
This restaurant serves
the most authentic home-cooked meal.

737
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:09,360
You bought the meal for me?

738
00:54:10,010 --> 00:54:12,040
Well, I'm sure...

739
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:14,430
other guys probably already
took you to fancy restaurants.

740
00:54:14,540 --> 00:54:16,510
I just wanted you
to have a meal comfortably...

741
00:54:16,510 --> 00:54:17,640
even if it's just a meal.

742
00:54:18,310 --> 00:54:19,320
Here.

743
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:23,250
Not really.

744
00:54:26,450 --> 00:54:28,090
- You don't feel comfortable?
- I've been...

745
00:54:28,090 --> 00:54:30,260
to expensive
and fancy restaurants before.

746
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:33,230
But I haven't been there with men.

747
00:54:33,230 --> 00:54:34,230
Why not?

748
00:54:34,690 --> 00:54:36,300
You must have dated a lot of men.

749
00:54:36,730 --> 00:54:37,860
38?

750
00:54:42,810 --> 00:54:44,810
You dated 38 men.

751
00:54:46,170 --> 00:54:47,810
For 38 years,

752
00:54:47,810 --> 00:54:50,080
I have never officially dated a man.

753
00:54:51,550 --> 00:54:53,640
I've gone on a few blind dates.

754
00:54:54,370 --> 00:54:57,090
But I had to study,
learn about the company,

755
00:54:57,290 --> 00:54:58,680
and work.

756
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:03,350
This really does taste like
a home-cooked meal.

757
00:55:21,510 --> 00:55:22,840
Won Seok.

758
00:55:23,250 --> 00:55:25,550
Won Seok. Did you see this?

759
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:29,940
Why are you here again?

760
00:55:29,940 --> 00:55:31,340
I thought your label
stopped you from coming here.

761
00:55:31,750 --> 00:55:32,910
As if!

762
00:55:32,910 --> 00:55:35,060
Do you know how much money
I bring in for the company?

763
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:37,950
Listen, Won Seok.
Did you watch this?

764
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:40,560
This is totally crazy.

765
00:55:41,420 --> 00:55:42,590
Shall we date?

766
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:47,090
[A Gay Getting Outed in Real-Time]

767
00:55:47,090 --> 00:55:49,340
- I can't believe this.
- No way.

768
00:55:49,340 --> 00:55:50,930
- What's this?
- I didn't know this about you.

769
00:55:50,930 --> 00:55:52,480
I don't know.
This dummy got outed...

770
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:53,670
which is really unfortunate for him.

771
00:55:53,670 --> 00:55:55,750
Will you keep this up? What is it?

772
00:55:55,750 --> 00:55:57,580
This is priceless. Smile for me.

773
00:55:57,580 --> 00:55:59,110
- Ho Dol.
- Just say it.

774
00:55:59,110 --> 00:56:01,410
Did you really think
I'd be like you?

775
00:56:02,550 --> 00:56:05,680
Something is definitely up
with Seo Yeon.

776
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:07,680
The receiver cannot be reached.
You will be directed to voicemail.

777
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:10,060
See? She's not answering her phone.

778
00:56:10,290 --> 00:56:13,300
Yes. I came all the way
to the last transmission location.

779
00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:15,030
Let me look into this
and call you back.

780
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:19,430
Excuse me.

781
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:23,600
Have you seen a woman like this
around here?

782
00:56:25,130 --> 00:56:26,740
No. I have not.

783
00:56:28,540 --> 00:56:29,550
Okay.

784
00:56:29,750 --> 00:56:32,010
But who are you?

785
00:56:36,020 --> 00:56:37,020
I'm a police officer.

786
00:56:37,550 --> 00:56:38,550
Bye.

787
00:56:43,090 --> 00:56:46,120
No way. Why is the police officer
looking for Baek Jang Mi?

788
00:56:47,650 --> 00:56:50,030
What on earth is happening
at this house?

789
00:56:57,130 --> 00:56:58,630
I'm a crazy woman.

790
00:57:01,810 --> 00:57:03,580
I'll be the only crazy one.

791
00:57:04,140 --> 00:57:05,140
Just me.

792
00:57:11,790 --> 00:57:12,950
Didn't I do a good job?

793
00:57:13,290 --> 00:57:14,680
I didn't bother you, right?

794
00:57:17,150 --> 00:57:19,230
I thought about you only a bit...

795
00:57:19,230 --> 00:57:20,920
and worked a lot.

796
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:22,000
Wasn't I good?

797
00:57:22,350 --> 00:57:23,420
Yes, you were.

798
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:33,900
What's wrong?

799
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:36,340
Did something happen?

800
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:39,140
How much is this house?

801
00:57:40,220 --> 00:57:42,140
- What?
- Are you the owner?

802
00:57:42,140 --> 00:57:44,790
Oh, it's registered under my name.

803
00:57:56,070 --> 00:57:58,120
And all these things are yours?

804
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:00,430
I guess so.

805
00:58:16,380 --> 00:58:17,910
Won Jae has a suit
from this brand too.

806
00:58:19,050 --> 00:58:20,720
He has great taste.

807
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:23,590
He's probably still paying it back
because he bought it over 36 months.

808
00:58:25,950 --> 00:58:27,620
You paid for it at once, didn't you?

809
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:29,270
Yes.

810
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:48,610
You really are
awfully rich, Kang Woo.

811
00:58:51,090 --> 00:58:52,110
What's wrong?

812
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:55,180
I suddenly realized it.

813
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:56,920
Realize what?

814
00:59:01,830 --> 00:59:03,120
Your place and my place.

815
00:59:04,830 --> 00:59:07,090
- What?
- I had forgotten...

816
00:59:08,130 --> 00:59:09,660
that you're the grandson
of Shinhwa Food.

817
00:59:11,970 --> 00:59:13,740
Why did I forget that?

818
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:16,600
Don't I seem really stupid?

819
00:59:18,010 --> 00:59:20,720
It doesn't make any sense
for you and me to be together.

820
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:25,640
Do you know why
my brothers and I don't look alike?

821
00:59:26,150 --> 00:59:27,560
They aren't my biological brothers.

822
00:59:29,950 --> 00:59:32,450
As you know, both of my parents...

823
00:59:37,230 --> 00:59:38,420
have passed away too.

824
00:59:39,090 --> 00:59:41,300
I'm an orphan. An orphan.

825
00:59:48,870 --> 00:59:50,170
What are you doing right now?

826
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:51,940
Need I explain more?

827
00:59:54,580 --> 00:59:56,290
You're making me feel
kind of miserable.

828
00:59:57,340 --> 01:00:00,560
Let's call this off
while it's not too deep.

829
01:00:02,060 --> 01:00:03,060
Not too deep?

830
01:00:03,060 --> 01:00:04,150
It's obvious.

831
01:00:04,150 --> 01:00:06,890
I'll suffer from more damage
if I date you any longer.

832
01:00:09,330 --> 01:00:10,390
Were you...

833
01:00:11,300 --> 01:00:13,800
counting numbers
while you were dating me?

834
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:15,570
You have no idea.

835
01:00:16,510 --> 01:00:18,570
You've never been the one
who has less power.

836
01:00:21,540 --> 01:00:22,780
So Kang Woo,

837
01:00:24,100 --> 01:00:26,220
- let's break up.
- Seo Yeon!

838
01:00:29,140 --> 01:00:30,640
What's wrong, Seo Yeon?

839
01:00:32,140 --> 01:00:33,180
What is it?

840
01:00:44,620 --> 01:00:47,430
I'm sorry. I was wrong.

841
01:00:48,690 --> 01:00:50,930
Don't say that, Seo Yeon.

842
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:55,980
You have a guest with you.

843
01:01:04,790 --> 01:01:06,020
Who are you?

844
01:01:06,490 --> 01:01:07,520
Pardon?

845
01:01:09,180 --> 01:01:11,450
Are you Kang Woo's girlfriend?

846
01:01:17,270 --> 01:01:19,090
Yes, she's my girlfriend.

847
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:26,540
Why? You are. You're my woman.

848
01:01:49,830 --> 01:01:51,330
[Love With Flaws]

849
01:01:51,470 --> 01:01:53,590
She doesn't like you because you're
handsome, then you're too ugly,

850
01:01:53,590 --> 01:01:55,300
and now it's because
you're a grandson of a rich woman?

851
01:01:55,300 --> 01:01:56,470
Enough is enough!

852
01:01:56,470 --> 01:01:57,470
I got you!

853
01:01:57,470 --> 01:01:58,600
Who are you?

854
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:00,010
I'll protect Seo Yeon.

855
01:02:00,010 --> 01:02:02,170
What if I don't need
anything else but her?

856
01:02:02,170 --> 01:02:03,200
Do you think that's crazy?

857
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:04,550
Whatever.
I'm getting kind of sulky.

858
01:02:04,550 --> 01:02:06,050
I'm going to kill myself.

859
01:02:06,050 --> 01:02:07,980
Don't cry. Please don't cry.

860
01:02:07,980 --> 01:02:09,440
Just toy me around, then abandon me.

861
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:11,440
Get a hold of yourself.
You seem crazy.

862
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:13,110
Kang Woo is bleeding to death.

863
01:02:13,110 --> 01:02:15,090
Why do you get scared
and give up on me?

864
01:02:15,090 --> 01:02:16,490
I don't love you.
