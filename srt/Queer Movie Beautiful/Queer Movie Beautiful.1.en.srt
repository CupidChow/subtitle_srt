Sorry it was so sudden, Sang-whi.
Thank you for everything.

Wish you well... Always.

00:02:09,812 --> 00:02:11,560
This is not a good idea, Beom-hae.

You've been checking me out since forever.

It's okay. Everyone does that.

Behave yourself. Come on, ask me out. Be polite.

So you're like my nephew.
You want a nice 'uncle'?

23
00:05:25,829 --> 00:05:29,625
Rather like your older brother.

- You guys rocked the night. Together.

I think not.
Friends, they are.

- Shut up, you crazy bitch!

God, Skinny-chasers are big losers. Those weirdos can't even tell gay men from cross-dressers.

Come on. Only bear-chasers are into chubby ones.

What a perfect night... it's not true?

176
00:32:50,519 --> 00:32:54,640
- You like it?ãã- I like so much!
- You like over all.

177
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,533
Wow!

178
00:33:06,726 --> 00:33:10,726
- This bitch achieved a lot.
- See, losing weight is everything.

179
00:33:33,692 --> 00:33:37,720
- Omo... won't it be a ghost?
- Yes, it is.

180
00:33:37,721 --> 00:33:42,161
I got suspicious and signed in again.
Boom, I was blocked.

181
00:33:42,162 --> 00:33:44,364
Gosh, total craziness!

182
00:33:44,365 --> 00:33:46,220
You knew?

183
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:50,584
A friend of mine has posted it now...
imposter alert on Facebook!

184
00:33:50,585 --> 00:33:54,280
- What a shameless bitch!
- Oh... it's true!

185
00:33:54,281 --> 00:33:58,897
We'll get those imposters' pussies blocked dead tight!

186
00:33:58,906 --> 00:34:04,406
- Won't we?
- Of course... locked, tight.

187
00:34:05,435 --> 00:34:09,079
- How Cute!
- Hello, crazy.

188
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:13,479
- You used to be an imposter!
- Omo! When was I?

189
00:34:13,724 --> 00:34:18,895
- Then the pic you posted was yours?
- Of course, honey! One of my A-cuts.

190
00:34:18,896 --> 00:34:24,845
- What a crazy bitch! Her pussy needs operation.
- Disgusting, bitch!

191
00:34:24,846 --> 00:34:29,835
- Fuck off, you piggy bitch!
- It hurts!

192
00:34:29,836 --> 00:34:33,681
- Pig!
- Boneless mummy!

193
00:34:34,111 --> 00:34:36,531
I am pissed!

194
00:34:39,709 --> 00:34:42,206
- Who's calling?
- There's this guy!

195
00:34:43,056 --> 00:34:45,099
- Gotcha!
- Bring it back!

196
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:48,118
- Hello!
- Pyeong Beom-hae, where are you right now?

197
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:52,414
You are the imposter, you used Dodo's pic
and chatted with me, pretending as Dodo!

198
00:34:52,415 --> 00:34:54,774
Don't you try to trick me!

199
00:34:56,036 --> 00:35:01,277
Where are you now? Answer it! Eh?

200
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:05,008
âCan't take your call right now....â

201
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:01,598
Beom-hae, why did you do that?   Uh?

202
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:05,069
I liked the way you were!

203
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:08,250
Now you don't, do you?

204
00:36:08,351 --> 00:36:10,311
Beom-hae!

205
00:36:10,312 --> 00:36:12,689
Take your hands off me!

206
00:36:16,143 --> 00:36:19,605
We are all about beauty, shall'nt we?

207
00:37:22,652 --> 00:37:26,194
So you disappeared and made all that mess.

208
00:37:26,195 --> 00:37:29,519
Look... are we here in Hawaii?

209
00:37:32,665 --> 00:37:35,503
What the hell is this all about?

210
00:37:35,504 --> 00:37:38,281
Why did you do that... uh?

211
00:37:39,731 --> 00:37:42,071
- Hyeong, I am sorry...
- What's up?

212
00:37:42,072 --> 00:37:45,050
No excuses today.

213
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,478
Were you happy being Dodo?

214
00:37:49,479 --> 00:37:51,959
Did you like playing me?

215
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:56,569
You... are into guys like Dodo.

216
00:37:57,588 --> 00:38:01,614
I... just wanted to be like him. Be him.

217
00:38:01,829 --> 00:38:04,996
Someone whom everyone loves.

218
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:21,982
Do you even know how much I tried to find you?

219
00:38:32,119 --> 00:38:34,430
Hyeong...

220
00:38:34,718 --> 00:38:41,270
You are going nowhere... I won't permit that.

221
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:08,309
Now you must know how I feel.

222
00:39:09,366 --> 00:39:13,046
It matters nothing... you love guys like Dodo...

223
00:39:16,729 --> 00:39:19,939
What the hell is this situation?

224
00:39:48,246 --> 00:39:52,020
Nonsense... you are this beautiful.

225
00:39:56,534 --> 00:39:58,357
It's all about beauty.

226
00:39:58,358 --> 00:40:00,327
Everything is.

227
00:40:00,328 --> 00:40:03,086
So... let yourself be it.

228
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:06,218
Just the way you are.

229
00:40:26,329 --> 00:40:30,850
- The world has gone to the dogs.
- It just can't end like this!

230
00:40:49,356 --> 00:40:53,652
Told ya, I got this new car... let's get dirty.

231
00:40:53,653 --> 00:40:58,547
- Two better than one!
- Three better than two.

232
00:41:06,838 --> 00:41:12,436
Then... four... must be the best.

233
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:49,855
What's fun... eh, Beom-hae?

234
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:55,011
What's this... a book?

235
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:58,511
Hey, what a nasty book it is!

236
00:41:59,326 --> 00:42:02,970
- Beom-hae, I can not believe you've been read like nasty.
- This book...

237
00:42:04,037 --> 00:42:06,439
Right, it's little bit nasty, but it's famous.

238
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:10,800
Stop being so coy, Beom-hae.

239
00:42:10,895 --> 00:42:12,514
Why not?

240
00:42:14,430 --> 00:42:17,487
I got a skin trouble lately, Sang-whi... look...

241
00:42:17,810 --> 00:42:20,925
I see... you have to change your skin, Beom-hae.
