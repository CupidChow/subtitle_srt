Episode 18

7
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,000
Well...

8
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:05,880
You go first.

9
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,440
You go first.

10
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:10,720
Today is the happiest day of my life.

11
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:12,880
Me too.

12
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,280
Young Master,

13
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,920
buy a lantern for my wife.

14
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,480
Today is the Lantern Festival.

15
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,240
If lovers put lanterns together,

16
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,680
it can keep the sweet forever.

17
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,880
I made a mistake again.

18
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,040
Today is the first time I sell lanterns.

19
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,480
I even asked a few people.

20
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,320
It seems that I can't sell this lantern.

21
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,360
Kid,

22
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,360
I want all these lanterns.

23
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,520
She and I...

24
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,800
She and I will be happy forever.

25
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,440
Here, take it.

26
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,440
Thank you.

27
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,480
Wish you and your wife a happy marriage.

28
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,640
And have a baby soon.

29
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,720
Who is your wife?

30
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,760
I was a kid.

31
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,600
So I...

32
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,240
I know.

33
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,080
You're afraid that she can't sell lanterns.

34
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,360
You'll be punished when you go back.

35
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,640
So you helped her.

36
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,320
You don't need to put the lanterns together now.

37
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,480
No, no, no.

38
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,360
I have to.

39
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,360
You said that

40
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,800
if you spend money,

41
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,920
it's a waste if you don't put them together.

42
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:25,680
It's shameful.

43
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:30,960
It's a pity that

44
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,000
there is a lantern show here.

45
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:37,240
I don't know when I can see such a beautiful scenery again.

46
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,080
Although there is a lantern show here,

47
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,520
there is also a lantern show in other places.

48
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,720
I promise you.

49
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,320
No matter where I go,

50
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,680
I'll go to the lantern show with you.

51
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,880
You can't go back on your word.

52
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,040
Why should I go back on my word?

53
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,440
It's my honor.

54
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:52,680
Let's go.

55
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,280
Put the lanterns together.

56
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:53,960
Let's go.

57
00:03:59,360 --> 00:03:59,440
Don't worry.

58
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,380
I think both of them

59
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,720
are burning hot Dil propio非常的 pudding bai now.

60
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,200
The earthenouth people in the town said

Yep, I envy those guys inang analysis.

65
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,160
Yeah.

66
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,480
Copy that.

67
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:25,720
Hey,

68
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,220
you're so Dakar chicken like

69
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,640
to copy others.

70
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,720
I'm not sure.

71
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,880
We're not happy about it.

72
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,360
Why should we hurt each other?

73
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:36,960
You're right.

74
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,800
If the sky is going to fall down,

75
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:44,920
what should we do?

76
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:45,840
What else can we do?

77
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,840
We can help you.

78
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,240
You look cold and cold.

79
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,160
But you're warm-hearted.

80
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,080
Thank you.

81
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:57,960
Two taels of silver.

82
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,640
I'm just trying to make a comparison.

83
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,520
Just two taels of silver.

84
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,560
You're too weak.

85
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,440
I sympathized with you for nothing.

86
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:05,520
Okay.

87
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:06,600
Half price.

88
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,000
Our friendship is just one tael of silver?

89
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,520
Assistant of the Department of Investigation,

90
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,120
you beat and killed him a few days ago.

91
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,720
Is there friendship between us?

92
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,520
Yes.

93
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:27,640
Cheers.

94
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,320
To those who lost their memories.

95
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,200
It's getting late.

96
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,160
You should go home early.

97
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,520
Your Excellency, are you going out?

98
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,000
Your Excellency,

99
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,360
it's so late. Where are you going?

100
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,800
I have something important to do.

101
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,240
Your Excellency,

102
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,080
are you angry?

103
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,800
Are you jealous?

104
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,480
Who's jealous?

105
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,120
It's so late.

106
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,320
What's the matter?

107
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,080
I can't hide my feelings

108
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,360
from your eyes these days.

109
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,560
So I'm going to go out.

110
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,680
I'll wait for you.

111
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,680
I'll wait for you.

112
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,680
I'll wait for you.

113
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,640
I'll wait for you.

114
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,640
I'll wait for you.

115
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,600
I'll wait for you.

116
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,920
I'll just say it.

117
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,720
I've been interested in you for a long time.

118
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,800
Since I joined the Investigation Department...

119
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,960
I know you're young and playful in the past.

120
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,880
But we're in the same department.

121
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,120
Don't make such a joke

122
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,480
in the future.

123
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,440
How can this be a joke?

124
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,160
It's all from my lungs.

125
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,360
You have a lot of lungs.

126
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,920
You said you like to marinate and water powder.

127
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,040
It's from the lungs.

128
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,640
You like to eat and drink.

129
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,800
It's also from the lungs.

130
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,440
People are free from suffering.

131
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:52,600
How can there be so much

132
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,080
in the lungs?

133
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:54,920
But...

134
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,760
I'm going back to the capital tonight.

135
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,960
You don't have to follow me.

136
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,560
Stay with Lu Jiu for now.

137
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,400
Go on investigating the Five-Legendary Treasure.

138
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,960
Help them

139
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:04,840
to get to the Gu Mountain

140
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,920
and get rid of the criminals.

141
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:07,960
My Lord.

142
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:08,800
My Lord.

143
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,600
What?

144
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,080
They didn't stay in the Five-Legendary Treasure

145
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:28,920
to find clues.

146
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,280
They just went to the Gu Mountain?

147
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,920
The Gu Mountain is just a group of pirates.

148
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,520
As long as Tian Luo sends a team of people,

149
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,200
we can get rid of them immediately.

150
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,560
Not everyone can touch the Gu Mountain.

151
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,920
Gu Mountain

152
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,400
Please

153
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,600
be more generous.

154
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,960
You're so ungraceful.

155
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,600
Do you think no one can see you?

156
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,480
What are you talking about?

157
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,000
Who is ungraceful?

158
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:16,840
It's my fault.

159
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,320
I'm born with a peach blossom eye.

160
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,200
A peach blossom eye?

161
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,320
Then, Mr. Lu Jiu,

162
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,680
you have a lot of peach blossoms.

163
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:23,640
Of course.

164
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,440
I only have one of the three thousand

165
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,400
of the weak water.

166
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,560
I only like you

167
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,000
with ten thousand of osmanthus flowers.

168
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,120
Please.

169
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,480
Even if you don't care about me,

170
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,000
you should care about how that person feels.

171
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,640
Since Mr. Geng left,

172
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,280
you've been unhappy.

173
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,080
You haven't eaten well.

174
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,440
Now you're walking,

175
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,000
you don't have strength.

176
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,520
You're really worrying.

177
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,320
Are you afraid that I'll get you into trouble?

178
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,840
That's not what I mean.

179
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,280
That's what you mean.

180
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,080
You all dislike me.

181
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,760
You don't want me anymore.

182
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,960
We all know

183
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,720
your feelings for Mr. Geng.

184
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,120
Mr. Geng is not

185
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,480
a person who is ungraceful.

186
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,800
If he does that,

187
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,920
he must have his own difficulties.

188
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,440
What difficulties does he have?

189
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,120
Well,

190
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,600
Mr. Geng is famous for his politeness.

191
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,880
He must have lost many enemies in the court.

192
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,040
When he goes back,

193
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,680
he must have some problems.

194
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,840
He left you here

195
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,640
to protect you.

196
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,480
Protect me?

197
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,320
He asked me to bring

198
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,200
a person who doesn't know martial arts,

199
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,160
a person who is full of martial arts,

200
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,680
a person who is always

201
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,520
in danger in the mountains

202
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,960
and is not reliable.

203
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,480
Is that protecting me?

204
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,760
Although I'm full of martial arts,

205
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,880
I'm still a young man.

206
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,360
I can do everything.

207
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,600
What do you mean by useless?

208
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,680
Although I'm not full of martial arts,

209
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,320
when will I

210
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,360
be able to get through the chain?

211
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:58,840
Make it clear.

212
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,920
Make it clear.

213
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,320
It's really hard for you

214
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,720
to be with them all the time.

215
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,120
I'm embarrassed by Miss Bai Yu.

216
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,440
Gu Shan is here.

217
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,560
Gu Shan,

218
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,240
I think I've been here before.

219
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,440
The decree is here.

220
00:10:36,440 --> 00:11:02,920
geht

221
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,400
I brought His Majesty's oral edict.

222
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,440
It's written here.

223
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,360
Congratulations, Lord Geng.

224
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,760
If this big thing is done,

225
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,560
His Majesty will give you and Princess Bai Yu

226
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,680
a marriage and a double marriage.

227
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,560
I didn't know that Father hid the missing Feiyin for many years

228
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,760
and tried to make a big plan.

229
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,560
I almost killed Feiyin

230
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,240
and ruined Father's big plan.

231
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,680
Please punish me for

232
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,720
ruining Father's plan.

233
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,280
You are my only daughter.

234
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,720
How can I punish you?

235
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,840
I made a marriage contract for you and Feiyin back then.

236
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,720
I did want to tie Feiyin to the sky

237
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,960
by this.

238
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,680
But no father in the world

239
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,080
would easily marry his daughter to someone else.

240
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,480
I like Feiyin.

241
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,400
You like her too.

242
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,760
Since you want her,

243
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,480
take her back.

244
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:14,120
That's the way I, Dugu, do things.

245
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,600
But how can I take her back?

246
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,480
Do you know how I

247
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,160
made Tian Luo

248
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,720
grow up from a secret murder organization

249
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:28,040
to a public official?

250
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,280
It's because Father is so capable

251
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,560
to share your burden.

252
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,200
Especially 20 years ago,

253
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,640
Father killed the traitors of the Phoenix Hall

254
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:37,880
and was highly respected by you.

255
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,400
There are thousands of people who are respected by you.

256
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,600
I'm different from them

257
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,840
because I know your worries.

258
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:54,880
The Phoenix Hall didn't have any traitors.

259
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,400
But I said he was a traitor.

260
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,040
He is a traitor.

261
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,520
I want him to be destroyed.

262
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,320
He must be destroyed

263
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,320
and become the rock

264
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,320
that I can't even stand on.

265
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,880
Father, you mean

266
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,480
the Mou clan is here

267
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,000
and so is the Cheng clan?

268
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,120
That's it.

269
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,800
Kill the Mou clan immediately.

270
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,160
The court has been letting the Mou clan go for so many years.

271
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,640
Why would they suddenly kill them?

272
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,000
Who is it?

273
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,040
It's the Mou clan.

274
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,760
They are the Mou clan.

275
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,960
They are the Mou clan.

276
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,160
They are the Mou clan.

277
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,360
They are the Mou clan.

278
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,520
They are the Mou clan.

279
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,680
They are the Mou clan.

280
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,840
They are the Mou clan.

281
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
They are the Mou clan.

282
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,160
They are the Mou clan.

283
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,320
They are the Mou clan.

284
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,480
They are the Mou clan.

285
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,640
They are the Mou clan.

286
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,800
They are the Mou clan.

287
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,960
They are the Mou clan.

288
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,120
They are the Mou clan.

289
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,280
They are the Mou clan.

290
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,440
They are the Mou clan.

291
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,600
They are the Mou clan.

292
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,760
They are the Mou clan.

293
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:53,920
They are the Mou clan.

294
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,080
They are the Mou clan.

295
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,240
They are the Mou clan.

296
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,400
They are the Mou clan.

297
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:58,920
Come on.

298
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,240
Don't play tricks on me.

299
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,000
Don't play tricks on me.

300
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,160
Waiter, take the bill.

301
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,560
Coming.

302
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,920
No, no, no.

303
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,320
I'll pay for it today.

304
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,480
Don't play tricks on me.

305
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:09,920
I didn't expect them to look like

306
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:10,680
the Mou clan.

307
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,640
They are quite friendly.

308
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,320
You are so angry today.

309
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,000
You...

310
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,440
My...

311
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:17,920
My arm.

312
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,080
Come with me to see the doctor.

313
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,560
Come on.

314
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,520
Come on.

315
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,000
My arm.

316
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,640
My arm.

317
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,400
My arm.

318
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,560
My arm.

319
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,720
My arm.

320
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:31,880
My arm.

321
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,040
You lost again.

322
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,200
Dad, dad.

323
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,760
I don't want to go with others.

324
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,000
Let go.

325
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,160
Stop.

326
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,320
You don't have a son.

327
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,480
Where is the money?

328
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,640
I'll bet on one hand.

329
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,600
Bet on one hand?

330
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,760
Come on. Come on.

331
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,440
Help. Help.

332
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:48,880
Help.

333
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,040
Come on. Come on.

334
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,040
Come on. Come on.

335
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,200
Hurry up.

336
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,440
Come on.

337
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,600
Don't be surprised.

338
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,760
This place is known as the most vicious city

339
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,800
and the place where the most criminals are buried.

340
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,560
A person

341
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,160
may be a more valuable

342
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,720
wanted criminal than you two.

343
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,080
Why didn't the government come to catch them?

344
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,040
I know that.

345
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:13,840
This is a place

346
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,600
that the government can't control.

347
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,160
Even Lord Geng can't control it?

348
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,440
It's not that no one has tried it.

349
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:19,880
There was an official

350
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:20,960
who brought heavy troops to besiege the palace.

351
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,200
He did drive away these three mountains and five moons.

352
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,120
I guess

353
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,600
the villages around were affected.

354
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,520
That's right.

355
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,080
The nearby villages were all destroyed.

356
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,280
People were in panic and people were in despair.

357
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,320
The officers and soldiers could only retreat

358
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,560
and let them return to the mountain.

359
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,680
Sometimes it has nothing to do with the blood.

360
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,480
It's just that different forces

361
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,080
pursue balance.

362
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:41,800
Yes.

363
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,480
The most famous elephant teeth in the Southwest

364
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,240
are made of elephant teeth.

365
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,400
It's normal that they're not that rare like ours.

366
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,280
The problem is

367
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,240
this is not elephant teeth, it's a human bone.

368
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,320
When we first met,

369
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,920
you used a pig's bone to frame me.

370
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:09,280
Who would use a human bone to sculpt us?

371
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,360
The elephant teeth have a yellowish glow on the surface.

372
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,800
If it's an adult elephant tooth,

373
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,080
it will have a brown glow

374
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:38,800
because of the oil-based

375
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,040
oil.

376
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,840
You're a expert.

377
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,680
The elephant teeth have a bright glow.

378
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,160
Only a young man's head bone can have this effect.

379
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,760
Besides, the details of the sculpting

380
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,800
are not the human bones of the first floor.

381
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,000
The craftsmanship of the sky

382
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,400
can't create this effect.

383
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,600
You're so mean.

384
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,120
You're selling the human bones.

385
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,480
Where's your conscience?

386
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,560
So you're an outsider.

387
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,360
Go away.

388
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,360
If you don't buy it, get lost.

389
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,440
Don't affect my business.

390
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,800
How can you be like this?

391
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:08,800
Don't you know who I am?

392
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:09,760
I don't care who you are.

393
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:10,520
In Mount Gu,

394
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,040
only a woman's words can work.

395
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,000
Go away.

396
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,640
Let go of me.

397
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,480
Go away.

398
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,760
Go away.

399
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,480
This is similar to the tools you used in the dance.

400
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,240
I was in a hurry and left it in Luoyang County.

401
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,280
If you like it, let's buy it.

402
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,160
Don't say it's a cross-section.

403
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:39,000
I'm afraid I won't have a chance to investigate in the future.

404
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,600
It's useless to know.

405
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,480
This Mount Gu

406
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,560
is really a cross-section.

407
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,560
No one can control it.

408
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,800
Killing and smuggling are commonplace.

409
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,440
It's really eye-opening.

410
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,160
I don't know who the woman in the wedding dress is.

411
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,200
Let those bad guys all listen to her.

412
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,480
Even...

413
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,680
Even that person

414
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,280
wants to meet her.

415
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,320
Who is that person you're talking about?

416
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:19,840
You know it.

417
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,080
You took the beauty back and beat her.

418
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,160
You're shameless.

419
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,280
In that case,

420
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:27,200
I'll lend you my beauty.

421
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,120
Who is your family?

422
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,440
All right.

423
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,600
It's important to do business.

424
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,160
We came to Mount Gu this time

425
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,280
to solve the problem behind the criminal.

426
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,320
The woman in the wedding dress must be seen.

427
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,520
But it's rare for someone

428
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,520
to see her real face.

429
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,680
How can we get close to her?

430
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:46,880
Right here.

431
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,000
This restaurant is nothing special.

432
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,520
Can we meet the woman in the wedding dress

433
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,160
after having a meal?

434
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,000
Are you afraid that others won't know

435
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,000
why we're here?

436
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,040
What's our plan?

437
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,760
Are we really going to have a meal?

438
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,680
It's nothing.

439
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,440
That's not a big deal.

440
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,320
With Ling Lang here,

441
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,960
we can do everything by ourselves.

442
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,480
Sir.

443
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,480
Sir, what would you like to eat?

444
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:25,760
Do you have a kitchen?

445
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:26,680
Yes.

446
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:27,760
This way, please.

447
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:28,960
This way.

448
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,080
This way.

449
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,720
This way, please.

450
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,120
Look at this.

451
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,680
This is far better than just wine.

452
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,140
Sir,

453
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,160
this is theangers in the restaurant.

454
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,720
Please enjoy.

455
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,360
Is this

456
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,080
This...

457
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:06,120
The sculpture was made by Ren Gu.

458
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,960
Could it be that the bun

459
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,720
was made by Ren Ru?

460
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:13,160
Why don't you try it?

461
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,520
It's already cooked.

462
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,800
How can I try it?

463
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,600
Don't worry.

464
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,760
We're not here to eat buns.

465
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:23,320
How can we meet that woman in the wedding dress?

466
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,360
Although she's strange,

467
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,880
she attends the Hero Society of the Jianghu,

468
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,480
Gu Mountain every year.

469
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,440
She values the people of Jianghu.

470
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,360
Tonight,

471
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,800
the Hero Society of the Jianghu

472
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,400
will be held here.

473
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,720
I checked it when I came up.

474
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,760
There's no one here.

475
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,520
Why would the Hero Society of the Jianghu

476
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,000
be held in this ordinary restaurant?

477
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,240
Ordinary?

478
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,560
Wait until midnight.

479
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:52,200
Be careful of fire when it's dry.

480
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:58,600
Be careful of fire when it's dry.

481
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,080
That's it.

482
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,720
It's really different.

483
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,360
How is it?

484
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,920
Do you think it's ordinary?

485
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,440
It's just a little bit more

486
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,400
of a bustling place.

487
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,960
Ladies and gentlemen,

488
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,240
the Hero Society of the Jianghu

489
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,680
will now begin.

490
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,840
Bravo!

491
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,280
It's about to begin.

492
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,360
What's the Hero Society of the Jianghu?

493
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,400
It's just like those who sell people

494
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,560
and sell slaves.

495
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,760
Why do you look so sad?

496
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,520
Aren't you familiar with this place?

497
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,440
No wonder you're running away.

498
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,760
You're really annoying.

499
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:29,640
You...

500
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,800
Enough. It's important to do something important.

501
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:36,760
Thank you.

502
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,400
You're a man.

503
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,640
You're just like a woman.

504
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,360
Ladies and gentlemen,

505
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,800
the first slave

506
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:49,960
is a war maniac who's been in the cold for years.

507
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:52,840
Bravo!

508
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,280
He's a man of great strength.

509
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,360
Are you looking forward to it?

510
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,400
Come on.

511
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,640
Yes.

512
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,360
Bring him here.

513
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:13,840
What are you doing?

514
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,280
The Hero Society of the Jianghu

515
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,680
War maniac, steel, gold, iron and bone.

516
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,040
You can't get in without a knife and a spear.

517
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,440
The man of great strength.

518
00:24:55,280 --> 00:25:13,080
Please don't

519
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:20,480
Although a man of barbarian character,

520
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,400
he can give the first hurt

521
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:25,160
to those who heholds in his sight.

522
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,480
What is this battle?

523
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,360
They are the medicine men made by living people.

524
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,520
When they were in the fog,

525
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,880
they used evil powers to kidnap men in the town

526
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,320
and took their clothes off.

527
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,320
They only cut off the connection with the past

528
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,480
and controlled people's hearts.

529
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,680
I thought

530
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,800
death was the most horrible thing.

531
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,480
Now I read this,

532
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,520
I think it's more horrible than death.

533
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,480
If we hadn't saved them,

534
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,920
I'm afraid they would have been

535
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,760
sold out like wounds at this moment.

536
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,680
Including Sima Kong.

537
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,240
You...

538
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,200
I'm sorry.

539
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,280
I offended you just now.

540
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,080
Today,

541
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,200
I'll avenge you.

542
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,080
Don't do anything together.

543
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,280
Don't forget the purpose of our trip to Mount Gu.

544
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,000
Since there are buyers,

545
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,120
there must be sellers.

546
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,200
Killing one or two people

547
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,360
can't solve the problem.

548
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,600
One is one.

549
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,480
Since I can save you,

550
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,760
I can save them too.

551
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,600
I'll go with you.

552
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,120
I'll go with you?

553
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,800
This is what he did.

554
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,280
How can he drink gal iba from me?

555
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,960
Stop him, quickly!

556
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:33,360
champions

557
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:33,640
industrious

558
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:33,880
won't win

559
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,040
uneasily

560
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:34,160
make no Rod and B sciences

561
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,280
Chili

562
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,360
Bullshit

563
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:36,880
died

564
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,480
hell

565
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:38,800
ask

566
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,320
All you guys

567
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,280
really

568
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:41,960

What do people say about you?

575
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:47,800
You keep talking nonsense.

576
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:48,100
You'll lose everyone.

577
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:48,840

Are you okay?

00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,280
I'm fine.

587
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,400
Collseed got me.

588
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,520
Are you trials of theiroga

589
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,160
and all kind of forward mysterious?

590
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,000
How can you see this secret?

591
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,120
If you know anything,

592
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:23,120
This restaurant is a huge trap.

593
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,120
It can be changed at will.

594
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,120
No matter how clever the craftsmen are,

595
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,360
they can't find all the traps in a short time.

596
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,040
Moreover...

597
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,640
Is there anything wrong?

598
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,240
I always feel that my every move

599
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,520
seems to be under the control of the other party.

600
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,360
It's like that person knows me very well.

601
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,280
It's you.

602
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,360
Go, go, go.

603
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:53,840
Go and look for Chief.

604
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:54,800
Moving forward!

605
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:55,680
Go, go!

606
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,360
Who is he?

607
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,000
Since just now, he is so insincere.

608
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,760
Is he a mute?

609
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:19,160
We helped him to place the living proof for the guest.

610
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,160
I don't think so.

611
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,360
No need to guess.

612
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,160
So it's not the mute.

613
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,000
You asked me to escape.

614
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,800
But it's the martial arts world.

615
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,360
Only the strongest one

616
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,760
knows the martial arts world.

617
00:28:49,600 --> 00:29:12,560
mu

618
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:18,880
decades have passed.

619
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,520
I'll do justice for the heaven.

620
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:21,960
Do it.

621
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,840
You're the first one who's still

622
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,520
so stubborn after seeing me.

623
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,560
But

624
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:31,280
being a green enemy is a great skill.

625
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,520
What's wrong, young man?

626
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,920
You admit defeat now?

627
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:42,000
I've never lost.

628
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:45,760
Lu Jiu?

629
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,880
Lu Jiu from Lu's family in Luoyang?

630
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,520
You're not happy with your name?

631
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:58,840
What are you doing?

632
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,040
Son.

633
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,880
I finally see you.

634
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,320
Lu Jiu from Luoyang?

635
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,160
You're not happy with your name?

636
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,720
I'm not happy with my name.

637
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,120
I'm not happy with my name.

638
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,480
I'm not happy with my name.

639
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,920
I'm not happy with my name.

640
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,400
I'm not happy with my name.

641
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,880
I'm not happy with my name.

642
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,360
I'm not happy with my name.

643
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,760
I'm not happy with my name.

644
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,200
I'm not happy with my name.

645
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,760
I'm not happy with my name.

646
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,200
I'm not happy with my name.

647
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,800
I'm not happy with my name.

648
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,200
I'm not happy with my name.

649
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,640
I'm not happy with my name.

650
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,000
I'm not happy with my name.

651
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,360
I'm not happy with my name.

652
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,720
I'm not happy with my name.

653
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,120
I'm not happy with my name.

654
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,520
Lu Jiu never likes to be in contact with people.

655
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,640
I remember the first time

656
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:54,920
I met him,

657
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,360
I almost fell down.

658
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,840
He didn't even help me.

659
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,360
I was so embarrassed.

660
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,360
According to you,

661
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,880
he did everything

662
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,280
behind the back of Mount Gu.

663
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,280
That's right.

664
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,280
He's been wise and wise.

665
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,640
Although Mount Gu is a busy place,

666
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,360
it's a righteous cause.

667
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,640
You can't let your men

668
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,000
get involved in the business.

669
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,200
How do you explain

670
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,520
the Heroes' Meeting?

671
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,720
Those who were sold

672
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,600
are the most vicious people.

673
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,400
I didn't want to kill them

674
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,880
after I subdued them.

675
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,320
This Heroes' Meeting

676
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,480
is a chance to change their mind.

677
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,320
After they sell them to the buyer,

678
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,960
all the uses will be under our supervision.

679
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,440
It's to ensure that they won't harm the martial arts anymore.

680
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:39,720
The person who made the medicine

681
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,160
is the war maniac you mentioned.

682
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,600
He's trying to protect the martial arts.

683
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,280
He's a free man.

684
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,560
He's in cahoots with that old man.

685
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,760
He stole the secret recipe for making medicine

686
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:51,000
and sold them to the people.

687
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,720
He's just using the way of others

688
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,320
to return them to their own people.

689
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,040
I was born in the Feng Lei Hall.

690
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,320
Master Luo Feng is a great doctor.

691
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,480
After I found out the recipe for making medicine,

692
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,200
I feared that it would harm the martial arts.

693
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,760
So I sealed the recipe.

694
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,040
I respect Master Luo Feng.

695
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,000
I won't disobey his order.

696
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,480
No wonder those people

697
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,080
use the names of

698
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:10,720
Blood, Blood, Heaven, Bear, Purple, Stone, Eagle,

699
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,360
Qianhu, Baji, and Nanxing

700
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:13,920
as the secret codes.

701
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,720
They're all the names of some medicinal materials.

702
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,480
And that old man

703
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,040
is so despicable.

704
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,320
He's just like Li Mu.

705
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,560
He used the way of others to harm people.

706
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,920
We were rude

707
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,480
to you just now.

708
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,400
I still don't understand

709
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,200
why you could take charge of Mount Gu

710
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,520
and abandon Lu Jiu.

711
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,800
I wanted to find him.

712
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,960
But Li Chu, who was so suspicious,

713
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,520
hid his name.

714
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,520
I searched everywhere in the country.

715
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,120
But I couldn't find him.

716
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,080
Li Chu?

717
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,680
I know that.

718
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:05,640
Li Chu was the second master of Feng Lei Hall.

719
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,360
Feng Lei Hall was rebellious.

720
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,960
He was often punished.

721
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,800
He was the reason for the rebellion.

722
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,760
But he disappeared after that.

723
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,560
Feng Lei Hall never rebelled.

724
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,960
Li Chu and Dugu Wu were the ones who colluded.

725
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:40,800
They claimed that Master Luo was the one who used the

726
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:16,720
Gu-abetted man.

727
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,120
He was the one who used the Gu-abetted man.

728
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,440
He was the one who used the Gu-abetted man.

729
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,720
He was the one who used the Gu-abetted man.

730
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:21,960
He was the one who used the Gu-abetted man.

731
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,120
He was the one who used the Gu-abetted man.

732
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,280
He was the one who used the Gu-abetted man.

733
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,440
He was the one who used the Gu-abetted man.

734
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,600
He was the one who used the Gu-abetted man.

735
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:27,760
He was the one who used the Gu-abetted man.

736
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:28,920
He was the one who used the Gu-abetted man.

737
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,080
He was the one who used the Gu-abetted man.

738
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:31,240
He was the one who used the Gu-abetted man.

739
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,400
He was the one who used the Gu-abetted man.

740
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,560
He was the one who used the Gu-abetted man.

741
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:37,200
The moon is in the paper.

742
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:43,000
In the dream, I'm a man for a lifetime.

743
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:49,120
In the dream, I'm a man for a lifetime.

744
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:54,960
I'll never forget you for my whole life.

745
00:34:55,120 --> 00:35:00,280
The mountains and rivers are long gone.

746
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:05,920
In the dream, I'm a man for a lifetime.

747
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:12,040
In the dream, I'm a man for a lifetime.

748
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,600
If we can meet again,

749
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:17,800
we'll have a good time.

750
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:27,280
Thank you for looking back at the past with a glance.

751
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:37,480
Thank you for looking back at the past with a glance.
