1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,960
Captain and Miss Galangal

2
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,500
Chief, can you tell me how important your wife is?

3
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,620
Tomorrow, I'll be at the law firm,

4
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:27,200
checking all the rumour instruments and mass charges against her.

5
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:02,720
I'm sorry to say that I'm not the only one who's been in the past

6
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,720
Oh, my god

7
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,200
I'm sorry to say that I'm not the only one who's been in the past

8
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:13,200
I'm sorry to say that I'm not the only one who's been in the past

9
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,200
I'm sorry to say that I'm not the only one who's been in the past

10
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:23,200
I'm sorry to say that I'm not the only one who's been in the past

11
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,200
I'm sorry to say that I'm not the only one who's been in the past

12
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,200
The sky and you fill my dream

13
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:37,200
I hate to go through the old days

14
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,200
Two years of love and death together

15
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,200
Episode 16

16
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:11,200
I'll beat you to death! Get away from me!

17
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,200
The atmosphere is not right

18
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,200
What's going on?

19
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,200
Hurry up

20
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,200
Why do I feel like everyone here is so hostile to us?

21
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,200
Right

22
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,200
It's them! Hurry up! Catch them!

23
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,200
Stop!

24
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,200
Stop!

25
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,200
Hurry up! Stop!

26
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,200
Stop!

27
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,200
Stop!

28
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,200
Hurry up!

29
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,200
Catch them!

30
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,200
Catch them!

31
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,200
Catch them!

32
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,200
Come out!

33
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,200
Come out!

34
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,200
Why aren't they coming after us?

35
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,200
Did you hear that? Come out!

36
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,200
Could it be that there's something wrong with this room?

37
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,200
If I'm not injured, how am I supposed to clean up?

38
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,200
Shut up!

39
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,200
Lin Lang, you're strong. You can handle them, right?

40
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,200
But we don't know what's going on yet.

41
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,200
We can't hurt innocent people.

42
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,200
It's not certain if they're people.

43
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,200
Isn't the killer dressed like this?

44
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,200
We have a guest.

45
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,200
Dr. Li, be careful.

46
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,200
These people are suspicious.

47
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,200
They don't look like good people.

48
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,200
I'm afraid they're the ones who took our village's women.

49
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,200
We're taking them to the village head to ask questions.

50
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,200
Chief Zai, do you need any evidence?

51
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,200
The three of us just got here.

52
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,200
We just want to find a place to rest our feet for our friends.

53
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,200
There was just a misunderstanding.

54
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,200
Misunderstanding?

55
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,200
If we don't find the place,

56
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,200
we'll be in trouble.

57
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,200
We'll be in trouble.

58
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,200
We'll be in trouble.

59
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,200
You're mistaken.

60
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,200
If you're not guilty, why are you running away?

61
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,200
I saw the blue clothes. They wanted to cut us off.

62
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,200
I didn't.

63
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,200
You're just making excuses.

64
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,200
Chief, it's them.

65
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,200
You're here, chief.

66
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,200
What happened?

67
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,200
Chief, this person is very suspicious.

68
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,200
Dr. Li,

69
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,200
our village has been attacked by the war flag for years.

70
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,200
Only the people in our village

71
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,200
know when the war flag will be disbanded

72
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,200
and can be entered and exit.

73
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,200
How did you get in?

74
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,200
What's the big deal about the war flag?

75
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,200
Shut up!

76
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,200
We're all disturbed by the intrusion.

77
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,200
We were chased by the criminals.

78
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,200
That's why we came here.

79
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,200
Please make yourself at home.

80
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,200
You can lie, but you can't fool people.

81
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,200
Dr. Li,

82
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,200
you're too high-ranking.

83
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,200
Please give us a proof.

84
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,200
Okay.

85
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,200
Okay.

86
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,200
Judging from the pulse,

87
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,200
your chest is

88
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,200
heavily injured.

89
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,200
You tried your best to get in

90
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,200
and your chest was damaged.

91
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,200
There's also a blood vessel

92
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,200
which is a internal injury

93
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,200
and an external injury.

94
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,200
We can see the external injury from the pulse?

95
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,200
Dr. Li Mu is our doctor.

96
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,200
Everyone here has a disease.

97
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,200
We can't treat him.

98
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,200
You can rest here for a few days.

99
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,200
I'll take care of you.

100
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,200
I'll listen to you.

101
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,200
Let's go back.

102
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,200
Let's go back.

103
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,200
Let's go.

104
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,200
Dr. Li, your house is so elegant.

105
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,200
There are so many beautiful flowers.

106
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,200
I like flowers

107
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,200
just like you.

108
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,200
So I'll pick some flowers

109
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,200
and put them in the room.

110
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,200
But

111
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,200
she's passed away for years.

112
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,200
You can't see it.

113
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,200
How do you know she likes flowers?

114
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,200
I can't feel it.

115
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,200
I can't see it.

116
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,200
So my nose is a little bit sensitive.

117
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,200
I smell

118
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,200
a faint scent of flowers

119
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,200
on her.

120
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,200
So I guess she likes flowers.

121
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,200
My father made me a body-scented pill.

122
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,200
I don't need it now.

123
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,200
But when I think of him,

124
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,200
I'll take it out and take two.

125
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,200
And

126
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,200
I lost the

127
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,200
token my father left me.

128
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,200
Don't be sad.

129
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,200
As long as you think of him,

130
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,200
he'll still be alive.

131
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,200
Dr. Li, don't be so polite.

132
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,200
Just call me Lin Lang.

133
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,200
You're good at medical skills.

134
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,200
I can do it for you.

135
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,200
I'm a man of my word.

136
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,200
I'm not a scholar.

137
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,200
I know a lot of things.

138
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,200
Like this

139
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,200
Mr. Lu Jiu.

140
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,200
He's more obedient than others.

141
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,200
He's more polite than me.

142
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,200
I guess he's not a mortal.

143
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,200
They say doctors are kind.

144
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,200
But doctors never ask about the patient's identity.

145
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,200
What?

146
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,200
Dr. Li, you have to find out our background

147
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,200
before you take us in?

148
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,200
I was impolite just now.

149
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,200
But I didn't mean anything else.

150
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,200
If it weren't for Dr. Li,

151
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,200
we would have been caught by those villagers.

152
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,200
Dr. Li,

153
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,200
don't mind his words.

154
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,200
You should help him.

155
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,200
Okay, this way, please.

156
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,200
Li Lang, look.

157
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,200
I...

158
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,200
Look at you.

159
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,200
You're so tainted.

160
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,200
You're all tainted.

161
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,200
Don't get me wrong.

162
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,200
I'm just used to it.

163
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,200
I'll get dirty if I'm not used to it.

164
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,200
So,

165
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,200
you were so excited just now.

166
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,200
I'm just laughing at you.

167
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,200
You're so indifferent.

168
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,200
The tea pot is wet.

169
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,200
No wonder you're so careless.

170
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,200
It's not the time to be so careless.

171
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,200
Mr. Lu,

172
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,200
you're used to it.

173
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,200
I'll take care of it.

174
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,200
Yes.

175
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,200
My father and brother have been in the Lu Mansion for years.

176
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,200
They're all in the hospital.

177
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,200
They don't even know how to live.

178
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,200
They don't even know how to play the piano.

179
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,200
But now,

180
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,200
my father is so indifferent to me.

181
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,200
My brother is also in the hospital.

182
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,200
Mr. Lu, don't be sad.

183
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,200
I'll be with you.

184
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,200
The night is like a winter.

185
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,200
The dusk is wavering.

186
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,200
The eight-leaf clover is not bright.

187
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,200
Oh, no.

188
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,200
I almost forgot Si Ma Kong's medicine.

189
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,200
You...

190
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,200
What did you mean just now?

191
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,200
I didn't mean anything.

192
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,200
We're all good friends.

193
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,200
Si Ma Kong and I will always be with you.

194
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,200
Who else?

195
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,200
I'll go and give Si Ma Kong the medicine.

196
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,200
No one can stop the heart.

197
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,200
I'll never forget you for all my life.

198
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,200
Thank you for looking back at the past with your eyes.

199
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,200
Miss Xu, you're breathing so fast.

200
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,200
Do you need me to treat you?

201
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,200
No, no, no.

202
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,200
Are you okay?

203
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,200
What's wrong with me?

204
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,200
Lu Jiu bullied you.

205
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,200
How is that possible?

206
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,200
I'm so strong.

207
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,200
How can he bully me?

208
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,200
Si Ma Kong,

209
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,200
you have such a sharp pulse.

210
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,200
Did I make a mistake?

211
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,200
No, no.

212
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,200
I'll go

213
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,200
and adjust the prescription for you.

214
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,200
I'll go.

215
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,200
Actually, there's something

216
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,200
I've been wanting to return to you.

217
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,200
What is it?

218
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,200
I thought I'd never see you again.

219
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,200
I stole it on purpose that day.

220
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,200
I took you there alone

221
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,200
to get rid of you.

222
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,200
It's okay. I can understand.

223
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,200
Now,

224
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,200
I can apply the medicine for you.

225
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,200
Can you be gentle?

226
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,200
What's wrong with me?

227
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,200
Nothing. I'm changing the medicine for him.

228
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,200
I'm sorry.

229
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,200
You're changing the medicine?

230
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,200
Yes.

231
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,200
Okay.

232
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,200
Be careful. Don't break your wound.

233
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,200
I think

234
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,200
it's already broken.

235
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,200
Really? Let me check it for you.

236
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,200
You're going to be in danger!

237
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,200
I'm going to call the police and call the police.

238
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,200
I'm going to call the police!

239
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,200
What?

240
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,200
I'm going to call the police!

241
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,200
Call the police?

242
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,200
You're going to be in danger!

243
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,200
What?

244
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,200
He's sick, right?

245
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,200
I'm going to add a big egg to him tonight.

246
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,200
It's okay.

247
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,200
I can handle

248
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,360
How are we going to sleep tonight?

249
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:38,560
It's such a big bed.

250
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,560
Three people can sleep in it.

251
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,320
Linglang hasn't left the room yet.

252
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,920
How can she sleep with two men?

253
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:44,960
Let Linglang sleep on the bed.

254
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:45,960
We'll sleep on the basement.

255
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,240
No.

256
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:48,920
Your injury is so serious.

257
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,080
It's hard to recover from the cold sleep on the floor.

258
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:51,720
Listen to me.

259
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,400
You sleep on the bed.

260
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,040
What about us two?

261
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,480
What about you two?

262
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,440
What about me?

263
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,000
I'm a patient.

264
00:12:59,280 --> 00:12:59,760
I...

265
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,040
How are you?

266
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,760
I'm dizzy.

267
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:06,760
I...

268
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,200
There's only one way.

269
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,680
Now you're in the hospital.

270
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,040
At least,

271
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,240
I didn't let someone's dirty thoughts

272
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,200
get in the way.

273
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,400
I'm so dirty.

274
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,800
I'm just drawing.

275
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,560
I don't care.

276
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,560
Anyway,

277
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,760
you should stay away from Linglang.

278
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:52,840
Why are you laughing?

279
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:56,120
I laugh at you for being calm

280
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,920
but I'm happy to care about him.

281
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,400
It's not easy to meet a person

282
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,360
who really cares about me.

283
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,000
He cares about me so much.

284
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,560
Of course I'm serious about him.

285
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,160
I'm 13 years old.

286
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,840
I was sick.

287
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,320
I don't remember anything when I woke up.

288
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,720
I always feel that people around me

289
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,040
want something from me.

290
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,640
I don't want to open my heart.

291
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,640
Until I met Linglang.

292
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,080
He taught me

293
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,720
that people should live for themselves.

294
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:37,920
What's this?

295
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,000
The antidote.

296
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,360
Since the antidote has a role in you,

297
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,560
why should I waste my energy?

298
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:46,800
Who's there?

299
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:48,720
It's me.

300
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,280
I made some egg soup.

301
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,400
Do you want to eat?

302
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,280
It's so late.

303
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,400
We're all asleep.

304
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,360
Sorry.

305
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,680
I have bad eyesight.

306
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,400
I didn't know it's so late.

307
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,280
I won't disturb you.

308
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,360
It's okay.

309
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,480
Dr. Li, wait a minute.

310
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,640
I'm hungry.

311
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,720
I'll be right out.

312
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,360
I'm hungry.

313
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,400
I'll put it in the kitchen.

314
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,240
I'm hungry, too.

315
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:13,800
Wait.

316
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,200
You're sick now.

317
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,000
You can't eat eggs.

318
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,320
Since the last fever,

319
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,760
your ears have become clear.

320
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,040
If you keep eating,

321
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,120
you'll become a wind-blown ear.

322
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,040
Ye Dun.

323
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,560
I'll go to Dr. Li's medicine cabinet

324
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,600
and find some herbs for you.

325
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,760
I'll cook you a meal tomorrow morning.

326
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:32,560
Cool.

327
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,640
We haven't eaten anything yet.

328
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,680
Village Chief.

329
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,360
Have you really left them behind?

330
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,840
Dr. Li is watching you.

331
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,760
They'll be fine.

332
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,080
We have families and before generations who remember us,

333
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:52,800
but we didn't say anything.

334
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:53,920
You...

335
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:54,560
Why are you here,robbed?

336
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,080
I don't have any estáns in my family.

337
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,560
But recently,

338
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,360
a few women have definitely disappeared in the village.

339
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,600
It is too scary for me.

340
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,220
Anyone can help.

341
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,480
Someone can help?

342
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:09,900
His bouncy wrist is strong.

343
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,220
I hate that.

344
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,460
Nothing can stop happened for him.

345
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,480
No violence.

346
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,500
Mr. Jiang looks chubby.

347
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,920
Let's take a look.

348
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:18,620
Young Master.

349
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:21,920
Can I ask for some hot soup?

350
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,860
Yes, do it.

351
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:26,080
How come you were so sowell?

352
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,500
I can take a glance at abide- Soft 우리 glasses

353
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:31,060
likely don't have a sitten,

354
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,600
especially for young Black Ch Verse.

355
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:34,060
Do you know the vapors in picture?

356
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,060
There's no Lord here.

357
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:36,020
Only Bai Yu.

358
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:38,980
I was young and ignorant.

359
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:41,300
Please forgive me

360
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:42,860
if you don't mind.

361
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:49,980
My Lord.

362
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:52,700
You've taught me not to talk too much.

363
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:54,540
I've interrogated Lian Buci.

364
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:56,060
He's from the Assassination Alliance.

365
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:58,500
He said someone had a high price

366
00:16:58,660 --> 00:16:59,620
and wanted to catch Lu Jiu alive.

367
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,740
The Assassination Alliance always takes money to kill people.

368
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:04,020
He actually got him alive?

369
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:05,380
That's right.

370
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:06,580
Although Lian Buci

371
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,700
never had a secret conversation with anyone,

372
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:09,860
he said

373
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,300
as long as he didn't hurt Lu Jiu,

374
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:13,620
he could be more ruthless.

375
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:17,340
That's not reasonable.

376
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:24,500
You've been with me for so long.

377
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:27,140
You finally asked me a good question.

378
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:29,540
My Lord.

379
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:31,140
Can you tell me

380
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:33,020
why you pretended to be a wanted man

381
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:33,980
and forced him to leave the city

382
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:36,620
and now you're saving him from the Assassination Alliance?

383
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,140
Have you heard of the Five-Faith Treasure?

384
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:41,940
Of course.

385
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:43,660
There's a saying that

386
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:45,340
the one who has the Five-Faith Treasure and the Five-Faith City

387
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,140
are the same.

388
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:47,900
The one who has the Five-Faith Treasure will have the whole world.

389
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,020
Twenty years ago,

390
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:51,740
after the Fuli Hall tried to rebel

391
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:52,820
after they found the Five-Faith Treasure,

392
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,620
the leader of the Tieluo, Dugu, was ordered to rebel.

393
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:58,380
Kill them!

394
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,300
Kill them!

395
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:06,620
Everyone knows that.

396
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:08,460
Do you know

397
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:10,820
how Dugu killed the Tieluo?

398
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,620
He set up a spy in the Tieluo.

399
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:17,100
His name is Li Chu.

400
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:18,540
He's the second leader of the Tieluo.

401
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:20,500
Brothers,

402
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,580
let's toast to Master Lu.

403
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,420
Cheers!

404
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:25,660
Come on, brothers.

405
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:27,380
Enjoy the food.

406
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:30,700
Let's go.

407
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:32,620
Come on, let's drink.

408
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:33,780
Let's drink to the old rules.

409
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:35,260
Fill it up.

410
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:38,700
Good.

411
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,060
Good wine.

412
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:42,740
Let's drink again.

413
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:46,940
Kill them!

414
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:02,540
Kill them!

415
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:16,980
Li Chu?

416
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:20,620
But I've never heard of this character.

417
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:22,420
After the Fuli Hall was destroyed,

418
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:25,460
Li Chu disappeared with the secret of the Five-Faith Treasure.

419
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:26,620
Until a few years ago,

420
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,500
I found the place where he finally appeared

421
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:29,620
in Luoyang County.

422
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:30,780
But the Lu family

423
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:32,300
was attacked by the eunuchs.

424
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,500
Now only Lu Jiu is left in the Lu family.

425
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:38,740
So you deliberately forced him to leave the city

426
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,940
and used him to find the clues

427
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:42,420
of Li Chu and the Five-Faith Treasure.

428
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,020
All the secrets

429
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:46,540
should be with Lu Jiu.

430
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:00,780
Nein!

431
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:02,020
Take him down.

432
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,100
Stop right there!

433
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,020
Stop!

434
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:22,500
Stop!

435
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:23,380
Catch him!

436
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:30,620
Cute

437
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:32,520
do a do-re-mi

438
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,340
Vine for Doctor Li

439
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,020
Nice

440
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:42,980
Honey

441
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:43,980
It's my pleasure to meet you

442
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:45,180
B ES

443
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:49,900
Ready

444
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:50,820
One

445
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,420
two

446
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:53,320
three

447
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:54,120
Мы

448
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:54,620
Ready

449
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:56,080
One

450
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,020
Two

451
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,080
Three

452
00:20:58,820 --> 00:20:59,500
Think

453
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:30,380
Let's go.

454
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:37,300
Let's go.

455
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:42,940
Dr. Li,

456
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:45,700
the village agreed to stay here temporarily

457
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:48,780
because of the loss of Madam.

458
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,940
Now they are so arrogant.

459
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,380
It's hard for me to deal with them.

460
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:55,580
Dear villagers,

461
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:57,860
after spending a few days with them,

462
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:58,860
I believe

463
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,060
they won't do anything

464
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:01,460
that will hurt us.

465
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:02,700
We always want to repay Dr. Li

466
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:03,980
for taking us in.

467
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:05,740
But Dr. Li is treating you.

468
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:06,540
It's just a test.

469
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,380
I want to use my medical skills

470
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:09,740
to share Dr. Li's burden.

471
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,060
You can treat people?

472
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:13,380
Don't treat them without a cure.

473
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,100
You'll die instead.

474
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:16,140
Come on.

475
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,260
I told you they wouldn't believe us.

476
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:19,620
Then let's prove it to them

477
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:20,780
with the actual situation.

478
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:33,260
Young Master are either accept the Islam or powder by themselves.

479
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:34,540
Why didn't you say it this time?

480
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:36,780
Killing God?

481
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,260
Why did you say Killing God?

482
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,660
Except you and finns.

483
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:48,900
Sub fron the bomb

484
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:50,620
and kill him.

485
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:52,860
Didn't you mention him in the prayer?

486
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:54,580
You are putting money into my account.

487
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:57,780
Let's altar of Ten- faster Tradition.

488
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:28,740
Richard.

489
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:32,820
It doesn't hurt.

490
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:35,020
You're really clever.

491
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:37,140
I'm happy to help you guys.

492
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:37,980
You are awesome!

493
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,100
Thank you!

494
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,740
Hurry!

495
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,060

Keep saintУ Hey!

497
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:43,780

Take it easy!

499
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:46,900
Son!

500
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:48,100
Patients!

501
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:49,660
You hit my son!

502
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:50,740
Are you OK?

503
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:52,340
I ask hat you call him my son!

504
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:53,140
Call your son!

505
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,140
Calls!

506
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:56,100
Calls!

507
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:56,700
Kid!

508
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:57,700
That brat!

509
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:58,660
Bad news!

510
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:00,140
Bad news!

511
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:02,780
The corpse.

512
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:09,940
I know this corpse.

513
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:11,340
She is the widow Li

514
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:12,980
who just disappeared a few days ago.

515
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:14,700
Although some of the other parts

516
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:17,940
are a bit rotten and can't recognize the face,

517
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:19,580
from the clothes,

518
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,180
it can also tell that

519
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:22,740
they are the women who disappeared.

520
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:23,780
To be honest,

521
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:25,580
I was a coroner.

522
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,780
She killed all these corpses.

523
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,220
Maybe I can help her.

524
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:32,180
She was also a widow

525
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:33,820
who just took the political shares.

526
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:35,620
She is so bad.

527
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,340
If it weren't for you,

528
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:42,940
I wouldn't have been disliked

529
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:43,860
for not trusting you.

530
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:45,740
You should thank me.

531
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,580
The government can't come in with the war energy.

532
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,100
Now only I can help you.

533
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:51,500
We only have a month

534
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:52,860
to communicate with the outside world

535
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:54,100
when the war energy is gone.

536
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:55,780
We have checked several times

537
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,100
but we still can't find any evidence.

538
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:59,620
Can you really help us find the murderer?

539
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:01,100
I will do my best.

540
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:19,300
All the corpses

541
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:21,100
were attacked by the sun on the right side.

542
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:22,540
It must be a left-handed person.

543
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:23,940
Left-handed?

544
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:25,660
Who is a left-handed person?

545
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:26,500
Stand up!

546
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:29,740
Xiao Yongfu,

547
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:31,620
aren't you a left-handed person too?

548
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:32,900
Why don't you go out?

549
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,380
Who said I'm not going out?

550
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:35,900
You are blocking me.

551
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:39,620
Yes, he is a left-handed person.

552
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:42,300
The body is the shortest

553
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:43,220
from the time of death.

554
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:44,940
Judging from the shape of the knife,

555
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:46,500
it should be a two-headed curve

556
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,060
and a chess piece like a sword.

557
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:50,020
What is this?

558
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:51,060
What is this?

559
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:52,180
What is this?

560
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:52,980
What is this?

561
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:53,740
What is this?

562
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:55,060
I only hit him twice.

563
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,300
When did you use the sword?

564
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:57,860
Well...

565
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:58,940
You are right.

566
00:25:59,140 --> 00:25:59,500
You...

567
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:01,620
There are no traces of sword on these corpses.

568
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:02,700
Even if there is,

569
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:04,300
each of them has a sword.

570
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:05,420
It can't be used as evidence.

571
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:06,580
No wonder you called

572
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:07,980
those people to catch people in the village that day.

573
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:09,460
You were the one who framed them.

574
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:10,900
You...

575
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:12,140
You are lying!

576
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,260
Catch him!

577
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:15,060
Catch him!

578
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:15,980
Catch him!

579
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:16,980
Don't run!

580
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:17,660
Don't run!

581
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:18,940
Don't run!

582
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:21,460
Miss Xu,

583
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:22,980
you are a detective indeed.

584
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:24,660
Village head, I was wronged!

585
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:26,300
You just admitted it yourself.

586
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:27,500
You still want to be wronged?

587
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:29,620
I killed the corpse of Li Guafu.

588
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:31,580
I wanted to play with him.

589
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,540
But he shouted and laughed loudly.

590
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:34,300
I...

591
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:37,220
Then someone came.

592
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:38,660
I hid myself quickly.

593
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:39,980
When I came back,

594
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:41,980
I couldn't find the corpse.

595
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,100
You still dare to argue?

596
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:44,900
Take him there and interrogate him.

597
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:46,420
Village head!

598
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:47,580
What about the corpse?

599
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:49,780
There is a coroner here.

600
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:51,780
Let's go.

601
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:52,500
Let's go.

602
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:55,780
You used money to pay,

603
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:56,980
but you didn't use money to pay.

604
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:59,180
These people are more reasonable than me.

605
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:01,500
At least the case is cleared.

606
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,060
You did something for this place.

607
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:05,220
You didn't ask me

608
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:06,580
how I found the tomb?

609
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:07,900
You would tell me

610
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:08,980
when you wanted to tell me.

611
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:10,420
We'd better clean up the corpse quickly.

612
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:12,060
Dr. Li is still waiting for us at home.

613
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:12,900
In the past,

614
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:14,580
you always said I wouldn't reveal my true feelings.

615
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:16,500
Now it seems that you are the one.

616
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:31,420
Why are you home so late?

617
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:33,300
The murderer has been caught anyway.

618
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:34,780
Don't be afraid at night.

619
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:36,260
Let's go.

620
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:42,900
Give it to me.

621
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:43,820
Give it to me.

622
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:44,820
Give it to me.

623
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:45,940
Where is the coroner?

624
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:48,300
What happened?

625
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:50,500
Yesterday, the women were missing.

626
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:53,460
And Sun Youfu said he only killed one person.

627
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:55,100
What happened to those bodies?

628
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:56,620
There will be no mistake

629
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:00,220
for the case of Lin Lang's解剖.

630
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:03,500
Where is Lin Lang?

631
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,860
I asked him to help me pick some herbs.

632
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:08,460
He left early in the morning.

633
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,500
This herb I just picked today.

634
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:13,180
It won't hurt once you massage it, okay?

635
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:21,740
What are you doing?

636
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:26,140
Can you feel the pain?

637
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:27,940
Can you hear me?

638
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:30,020
Are you okay?

639
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:31,980
This is a prosthetic anc če Hard rejectant.

640
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:33,860
It can confirm memory.

641
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:38,340
This is warm position.

642
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:39,460
Have some tea.

643
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:40,980
Have some tea.

644
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:46,460
Have some tea.

645
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:48,460
Have some tea.

646
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,500
Mei Xu Kong means

647
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,320
dust swirling filling

648
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:13,780
with ley.

649
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,320
Go.

650
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,700
Continue.

651
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:31,040
série.

652
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:38,220
Why are you dead?

653
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:39,740
Why did you kill them?

654
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:41,140
They deserve to die.

655
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:43,060
You don't drink tea.

656
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:44,820
I have wine.

657
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:53,260
I want wine.

658
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:55,900
I drank it to be healthy.

659
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:58,420
I didn't expect you to be so vicious.

660
00:29:59,060 --> 00:29:59,820
Shut up!

661
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:01,540
They deserve to die!

662
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:03,740
You scared us!

663
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:05,060
Are you blind?

664
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,860
You scared us!

665
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:07,900
I'll kill you!

666
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:08,740
I'll kill you!

667
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:09,740
I'll kill you!

668
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:29,260
What are you looking at?

669
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,060
You're a jerk.

670
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:39,860
You're a jerk.

671
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:40,860
You're a jerk.

672
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:42,060
You're a jerk.

673
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:43,100
I'll kill you!

674
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:43,900
I'll kill you!

675
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:45,100
You're a jerk!

676
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:52,860
They deserve to die.

677
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:55,620
They deserve to die for bullying me.

678
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:08,740
Your Grace,

679
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:09,700
we've already known

680
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:11,420
that Lu Jiu and the others have disappeared in the Battle Qi Forest.

681
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:12,460
Why didn't you chase them?

682
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:13,580
Instead, you came here.

683
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:17,380
You're going to test me again?

684
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:22,180
The forest around the battle

685
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:23,180
is surrounded by mountains.

686
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:24,260
I can't escape.

687
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:26,900
If Lu Jiu and the others want to continue to move forward,

688
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:28,380
they have to find a way out.

689
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:30,060
This is

690
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:31,940
their place of refuge.

691
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:34,540
I'm sure they'll find a way out.

692
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:35,620
I'm sure they'll find a way out.

693
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:36,620
I'm sure they'll find a way out.

694
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:37,700
This is their place of refuge.

695
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:43,500
But there are many people here.

696
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,900
How can we make it

697
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:46,300
without missing them?

698
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:50,940
There are six ways to see and hear.

699
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:52,540
Everything around is frozen.

700
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:56,220
Firewood.

701
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:57,860
Hot air.

702
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:00,020
Wind blows.

703
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:01,660
And

704
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:03,420
the smell of the branches.

705
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:06,020
The bun shop is just two meters away.

706
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:07,420
You can see it without missing anyone.

707
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:08,540
What kind of skill is that?

708
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:10,140
Your Grace,

709
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:13,020
as long as you accept me as your disciple,

710
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:14,700
I promise I won't tell anyone about this.

711
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:16,820
I, Geng Zhao, never accept anyone.

712
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:18,620
Your Grace.

713
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:34,020
Your Grace.

714
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:35,620
It's so beautiful.

715
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:47,580
Your Grace.

716
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:49,540
You were so naughty just now.

717
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:55,660
Your Grace.

718
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:58,020
Your Grace, where are we going?

719
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:58,980
The main hall.

720
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:34,180
Your Grace.

721
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:34,900
Your Grace.

722
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:35,660
Your Grace.

723
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:36,420
Your Grace.

724
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:37,100
Your Grace.

725
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:37,900
Your Grace.

726
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:38,740
Your Grace.

727
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:39,540
Your Grace.

728
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:40,300
Your Grace.

729
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:41,100
Your Grace.

730
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:42,020
Your Grace.

731
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,020
Your Grace.

732
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:44,020
Your Grace.

733
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:45,020
Your Grace.

734
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:46,020
Your Grace.

735
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:47,020
Your Grace.

736
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:48,020
Your Grace.

737
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:49,020
Your Grace.

738
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:50,020
Your Grace.

739
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:51,020
Your Grace.

740
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:52,020
Your Grace.

741
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:53,020
Your Grace.

742
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:54,020
Your Grace.

743
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:55,020
Your Grace.

744
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:56,020
Your Grace.

745
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:57,020
Your Grace.

746
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:58,020
Your Grace.

747
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:59,020
Your Grace.

748
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:00,020
Your Grace.

749
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:01,020
Your Grace.

750
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:02,020
Your Grace.

751
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:03,020
Your Grace.

752
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:04,620
Your Grace.

753
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:05,620
Your Grace.

754
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:06,620
Your Grace.

755
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:07,620
Your Grace.

756
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:08,620
Your Grace.
