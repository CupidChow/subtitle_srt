1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,980
You woke up before people

2
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:50,440
The Разor

3
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:55,440
The King of Blaze

4
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,440
Episode 16

5
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:01,440
The King of Blaze

6
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,440
I'm telling you, after marriage,

7
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,440
he definitely wants you to be his wife.

8
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,440
The things that he promised before

9
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,440
are just a matter of time.

10
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,440
It won't last long.

11
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,440
Women are men's property.

12
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,440
Moreover, your family is a martial art company.

13
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,440
It's not a proper business

14
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,440
to deal with the dead.

15
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,440
Women should serve men at home

16
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,440
and be filial to their parents.

17
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,440
The world outside the house is for men.

18
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,440
There are women in this martial art company.

19
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,440
I didn't know

20
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,440
that your martial art company was so hard.

21
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,440
Although there is no shelter

22
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,440
or shelter in Gushan,

23
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,440
you can kill anyone.

24
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,440
But you can accompany me

25
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,440
to go to Gushan.

26
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,440
This is also your home.

27
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,440
Lin Lang, I'm telling you,

28
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,440
men can never see

29
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,440
what we do for them.

30
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,440
Women should do it for themselves.

31
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,440
I'm going to the academy now.

32
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,440
I'm leaving.

33
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,440
Don't go.

34
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,440
Lin Lang,

35
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,440
what's wrong with you?

36
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,440
I'm fine.

37
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,440
I just feel a little uncomfortable.

38
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,440
I'm going out to get some fresh air.

39
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,440
Jiu'er,

40
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,440
the academy is going to be built today.

41
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,440
You're the dean.

42
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,440
How can you lose your job?

43
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,440
You're not

44
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,440
the only one for us now.

45
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,440
You have to consider for the people of Gushan.

46
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,440
Let's go back.

47
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,440
The Academy

48
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,440
The academy will be yours from now on.

49
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,440
Mr. Lu,

50
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,440
a toast to you.

51
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,440
Come on.

52
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,440
Geng Dazhen.

53
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,440
What's going on?

54
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,440
The government ordered to suppress Gushan.

55
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,440
The army is about to attack.

56
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,440
Gushan has been in the wind for twenty years.

57
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,440
How could it suddenly be like this?

58
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,440
It is said that Tian Luo is in the middle.

59
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,440
The rest of the Phoenix Hall is about to start again.

60
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,440
Fortunately, Lord Geng Zhao arrived in time to report the news.

61
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,440
Young Master has taken people to the base of the mountain.

62
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,440
Lu Jiu.

63
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,440
Miss Xu,

64
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,440
you can't help me with anything now.

65
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,440
Instead, you will distract Young Master.

66
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,440
He specifically told me to accompany you

67
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,440
to ensure your safety.

68
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,440
What about Sima Kong?

69
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,440
He is good at mechanical weapons.

70
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,440
He has followed Young Master

71
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,440
to set up the attack to resist the enemy.

72
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,440
Why am I so useless?

73
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,440
I can't help you with anything.

74
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,440
Although Gushan is a rough mountain,

75
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,440
it has never been loose these years.

76
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,440
It often practices.

77
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,440
Even if you fight with them,

78
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,440
you will have some courage.

79
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,440
I have set up an attack around Gushan.

80
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,440
It should take at least an hour.

81
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,440
An hour.

82
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,440
Enough.

83
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,440
The government sent troops this time

84
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,440
because Dugu was in the limelight.

85
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,440
The troops were in the corner.

86
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,440
They came with the Xinnian's new pen.

87
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,440
New pen?

88
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,440
No matter who wins or loses,

89
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,440
Dugu is a fool.

90
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,440
Just like 20 years ago,

91
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,440
he destroyed Feng Lei Hall

92
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,440
and took the power of the Winged King.

93
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,440
We can't let him succeed.

94
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,440
Time is short.

95
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,440
Young Master Sima,

96
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,440
please follow me to check the situation.

97
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,440
Where is Bai Yu?

98
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,440
Don't worry, Master Geng.

99
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,440
The guards of Gushan have come to report.

100
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,440
Before Bai Yu's enemy came,

101
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,440
she had left the Gushan's territory

102
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,440
and went to the capital.

103
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,440
That's good.

104
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,440
I don't know if I should say this.

105
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,440
Although they are in love,

106
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,440
if you keep everything in your heart,

107
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,440
it's easy to go further.

108
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,440
Why don't you try it?

109
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,440
No.

110
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,440
I'm sorry.

111
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,440
It's okay.

112
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,440
I'll go with you.

113
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,440
Lady Xu.

114
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,440
Young Master Sima ordered

115
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,440
that the mansion is the safest place.

116
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,440
He will guard it till he dies.

117
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,440
Lady Xu,

118
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,440
please don't leave here.

119
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,440
But I want to know

120
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,440
how she is.

121
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,440
You stay here

122
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,440
is the biggest help to her.

123
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,120
Come.

124
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,360
Thanks to the Young Master's brilliant plan,

125
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,960
we can defeat those soldiers.

126
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:26,920
Yes.

127
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,480
Young Master is great.

128
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,480
Young Master is great.

129
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,200
Young Master is great.

130
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,520
Young Master is great.

131
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,520
Young Master is great.

132
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,520
Young Master is great.

133
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,320
Thanks to

134
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,520
the military deployment of Lord Geng

135
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,520
and the layout of Sima's palace,

136
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:45,000
we can defeat the enemy so smoothly.

137
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,600
We really won?

138
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,600
We won.

139
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,400
Today,

140
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,520
the victory of Mount Gou

141
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,520
is under my command.

142
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,920
We will win the battle.

143
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,520
Great.

144
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,520
Great.

145
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,520
Great.

146
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,520
Great.

147
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,520
Great.

148
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,520
Great.

149
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,520
Great.

150
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,520
Great.

151
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,520
Great.

152
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,520
Great.

153
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,520
Great.

154
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,520
Great.

155
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,520
Great.

156
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,520
Great.

157
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,520
Great.

158
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,520
Lu Jiu.

159
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,120
You have become

160
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,720
the subordinate of the Fu family

161
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,320
who was disguised as a man.

162
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,520
You have found your own life.

163
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,520
I should

164
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,120
find mine too.

165
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,120
Take care.

166
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,520
Uncle.

167
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,520
The letter.

168
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,520
Long Chiya

169
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,520
is not far

170
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,520
from Mount Gou and the formation of the fog.

171
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,520
Mount Gou is tight.

172
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,520
There must be a lot of things

173
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,520
he can't do.

174
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,520
Xing'er.

175
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,520
Did you see Linglang?

176
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,520
He was here just now.

177
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,520
Young Master.

178
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,520
You just finished the battle.

179
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,520
You just...

180
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,520
I don't know who it was

181
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,520
who looked at Sima Kong

182
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,520
with that look.

183
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,520
It was so hot.

184
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,520
But you are the Young Master.

185
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,520
Of course you have to be more restrained than me.

186
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,520
I can be restrained.

187
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:30,520
Help me find something.

188
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,520
Something?

189
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,520
I don't know.

190
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,520
I don't know.

191
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,520
I don't know.

192
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,520
Thank you.

193
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,520
Linglang.

194
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,520
Where are you going?

195
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,520
Linglang left.

196
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,520
How could this be?

197
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,520
Linglang has been feeling down recently.

198
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,520
You must have been

199
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,520
cold-hearted with the mountain.

200
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,520
If you had more faith in him,

201
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,520
he wouldn't have disappeared for no reason.

202
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,520
Enough.

203
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,520
This is not a normal time.

204
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,520
The most important thing

205
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,520
is to find Miss Xu's whereabouts.

206
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,520
The footprints at the door

207
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,520
are the same size and height

208
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,520
as Miss Xu's body shape.

209
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,520
She must have seen some letters

210
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,520
after she entered the house.

211
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,520
Then she turned around

212
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,520
and ran out.

213
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,520
What was in the letter?

214
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,520
What was not important.

215
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,520
The person who sent the letter

216
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,520
entered the room through this window.

217
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,520
She was very careful.

218
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,520
Before leaving,

219
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,520
she wiped out the traces she left.

220
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,520
But coincidentally,

221
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,520
she was exposed to her whereabouts

222
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,520
in a different place.

223
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,520
The smell of the high-level soil.

224
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,520
Only Mount Phoenix is needed for high-level soil.

225
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,520
Linglang must have been there.

226
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:13,520
Mount Phoenix has the guards of Mount Gu.

227
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,520
It's hard to escape if they catch us.

228
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,520
They will never give up.

229
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,520
You mean...

230
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,520
Longchi Cliff.

231
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,520
I've seen Mount Gu's land.

232
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,520
It's just a few miles from Mount Phoenix.

233
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,520
The ground is solid.

234
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,520
The ground is blood

235
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,520
and hard to attack.

236
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,520
There are also barriers

237
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,520
that can be escaped secretly.

238
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,520
That person took Linglang there.

239
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,520
Could it be...

240
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,520
You are indeed the owner of the former government office.

241
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,520
You are very skilled.

242
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,520
Uncle.

243
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,520
Your father and I

244
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,520
are both from the old department of Fenglei Hall.

245
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,520
You call me uncle.

246
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,520
It makes sense.

247
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,520
My father is the former department of Fenglei Hall.

248
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,520
It seems that your father

249
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,520
has been very popular for the past 20 years.

250
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,520
He even kept his own daughter.

251
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,520
If he didn't kill Tian Luo

252
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,520
and kill the rest of the people of Fenglei Hall,

253
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,520
no one in this world

254
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,520
would know his true identity.

255
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,520
You even know this?

256
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,520
Who are you?

257
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,520
Don't be afraid, miss.

258
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,520
For the sake of your saving my son

259
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,520
many times,

260
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,520
I won't hurt you.

261
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,520
Your son?

262
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,520
You are Lu Kun?

263
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,520
The secret weapon of Tang family.

264
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,520
I know you want to use me to threaten Lu Jiu.

265
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,520
You are dreaming.

266
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,520
Father.

267
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,520
Father.

268
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,520
You didn't want to see me for many years.

269
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,520
I didn't expect

270
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,520
we could meet each other like this.

271
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,520
You know I am your father.

272
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,520
I thought you and your mother

273
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,520
would be very close to me after you were born.

274
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,520
Although you are very kind,

275
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,520
I will never forget

276
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,520
the kindness you have given me all these years.

277
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,520
But you forgot the most important thing.

278
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,520
Fengqing.

279
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,520
I had no choice.

280
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,520
I put you by Tian Luo's side.

281
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,520
At least you can live.

282
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,520
Otherwise, you and my father

283
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,520
would have died long ago.

284
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,520
You know

285
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,520
I have been very kind.

286
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,520
Now

287
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,520
you have the whereabouts of the treasure.

288
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,520
We can get rid of Tian Luo's evil spirit.

289
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,520
I will be with you.

290
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,520
I will be with you.

291
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,520
I will be with you.

292
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,520
I will be with you.

293
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,520
I will be with you.

294
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,520
You can control it.

295
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,520
You and my father can share the treasure.

296
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,520
I can also give you a warm home.

297
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,520
Come on.

298
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,520
You are my father.

299
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,520
Why?

300
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:43,520
In front of the wealth of the rich and the poor,

301
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,520
the so-called family is not worth mentioning.

302
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,520
This is the first lesson I taught you.

303
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,520
It may be the last lesson.

304
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,520
Give me the desert map.

305
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,520
Poor.

306
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,520
What a joke.

307
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,520
You could have kept the treasure and the family.

308
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,520
No.

309
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,520
Tell me.

310
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:18,520
What is the treasure you found seven years ago?

311
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,520
Seven years ago,

312
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,520
you killed me once.

313
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,520
Seven years later,

314
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,520
you killed me again.

315
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,520
Seven years later,

316
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,520
you killed me again.

317
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,520
Seven years later,

318
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,520
seven years later,

319
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:47,520
you killed me for the same purpose.

320
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,520
Do you know?

321
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,520
Every day,

322
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,520
I was thinking about the scene we met.

323
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,520
I never thought

324
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,520
it would be like this.

325
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,520
You are so ungrateful.

326
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,520
You fell off the cliff.

327
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,520
Although you survived,

328
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,520
you lost your memory and fell on the street.

329
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,520
I brought you up

330
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,520
after I picked you up.

331
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,520
Otherwise, you wouldn't be here today.

332
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,520
Father,

333
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,520
if you didn't want to

334
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,520
get the secret of the treasure,

335
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,520
I'm afraid you would have killed me

336
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,520
when you met me on the street.

337
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,520
What's the use of the past for him?

338
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,520
Why don't we think about it now?

339
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,520
You and I share the treasure

340
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,520
and dominate the world.

341
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,520
It's a happy ending.

342
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,520
Give me the treasure.

343
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,520
We can go back to the past.

344
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,520
Yes.

345
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,520
Just like before,

346
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,520
you raised me

347
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,520
in the prison.

348
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,520
You imprisoned me in Luoyang

349
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,520
and waited for the day when I could be used by the people.

350
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,520
Lu Kun,

351
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,520
today,

352
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,520
you and I

353
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,520
will break our father-son relationship.

354
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,520
Okay.

355
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,520
Then let me explain

356
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,520
what you can do.

357
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,520
Are you afraid?

358
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,520
No.

359
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,520
I'm not afraid

360
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,520
even if I fall down the sky with you.

361
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,520
Do you remember

362
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,520
how I took revenge on you

363
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,520
seven years ago?

364
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,520
No!

365
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,520
No!

366
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,520
Linglong, you're awake.

367
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,520
How did I get back?

368
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,520
Lu Jiu asked you to come back.

369
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,520
Where is he?

370
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,520
He...

371
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,520
How is he?

372
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,520
Why is he

373
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,520
so worried?

374
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,520
Lu Jiu really

375
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,520
did something good for us?

376
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,520
Don't say it.

377
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,520
Don't say it.

378
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,520
Lu Jiu is a fool.

379
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,520
You're a fool.

380
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,520
You just said

381
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,520
you're saving your life.

382
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,520
You're not dead.

383
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,520
Who said I was dead?

384
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,520
I just didn't finish what I said.

385
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,520
What on earth is going on?

386
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,520
I remember

387
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,520
we fell off the cliff together.

388
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,520
Then I fainted.

389
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,520
Then

390
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,520
you fell into

391
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,520
the trap I had designed.

392
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,520
Lu Jiu and I are so talented.

393
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,520
How could we go to save people

394
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,520
without any preparation?

395
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,520
No wonder you

396
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,520
jumped down on your own.

397
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,520
But

398
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,520
how did you...

399
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,520
I just got a little skin wound.

400
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,520
I was so worried

401
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,520
that

402
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,520
I was covered in dirt.

403
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,520
You understand the village head.

404
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,520
As a mother,

405
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,520
I can't bear to see

406
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,520
your son get hurt.

407
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,520
Mother, don't worry.

408
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,520
I'm covered in dirt.

409
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,520
Look, it's fine now.

410
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,520
How is it fine?

411
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,520
It's not good to be a couple

412
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,520
when you're injured.

413
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,520
Then your marriage with Lin Lang

414
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,520
will be postponed again.

415
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,520
When can I

416
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,520
have a grandson?

417
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,520
I won't get married with Lin Lang for now.

418
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,520
I won't get married with Lin Lang for now.

419
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,520
A-San.

420
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,520
A-San.

421
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,520
Why is this wine so bad?

422
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,520
Wine

423
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,520
doesn't suit its taste.

424
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,520
Then what is it?

425
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,520
It's the bitterness of wine

426
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,520
that breaks a man's heart.

427
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,520
They say that

428
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,520
a drunk man can solve thousands of sorrows.

429
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,520
Why do you worry about it?

430
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,520
I'm sorry.

431
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,520
I'm sorry.

432
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,520
I'm sorry.

433
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,520
I'm going back to the capital.

434
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,520
Are you going to see Bai Yu?

435
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,520
It has nothing to do with him.

436
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,520
I was ordered to eliminate Gu Shan

437
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,520
and go to the Ling family for a break.

438
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,520
I have to go back

439
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,520
and give an explanation.

440
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,520
Now the court is under the influence

441
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,520
of Wu Xiangcheng.

442
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,520
This time, you're using the people

443
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,520
who saved Gu Shan.

444
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,520
I saved the people of Gu Shan

445
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,520
out of my own will.

446
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,520
Going back to the capital

447
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,520
to commit a crime of treason

448
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,520
is out of my own will.

449
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,520
It's all my way of pursuing

450
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,520
and seeking.

451
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,520
I have to face what I have to face.

452
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,520
You're so noble.

453
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,520
I admire you.

454
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,520
In the past, I used you as my target.

455
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,520
From now on, you're my model.

456
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,520
Since you've already

457
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,520
put the hat on your head,

458
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,520
I have to give you this.

459
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,520
Here.

460
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,520
This is the draft of the inspection office.

461
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,520
I can take the inspection office exam.

462
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,520
Although the inspection office

463
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,520
is for men and women,

464
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,520
in the past ten years,

465
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,520
the number of women who can be selected

466
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,520
is small.

467
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,520
Even if they're selected,

468
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,520
they're all noble

469
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,520
and have a good life.

470
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,520
The inspection office

471
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:13,520
has always been strict

472
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,520
with women's rights.

473
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,520
But fortunately, my father is a prince.

474
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,520
As long as I'm interested in the case,

475
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,520
no one dares to stop me.

476
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,520
Interested in the case?

477
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,520
Yes.

478
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,520
I'm interested in you.

479
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,520
Sir.

480
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,520
Don't think this is a life-saving talisman.

481
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,520
You have to pass the exam

482
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,520
before you can really enter the inspection office.

483
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,520
I understand.

484
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,520
But do you understand?

485
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,520
Understand what?

486
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,520
You know what I'm talking about.

487
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,520
If you know someone

488
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,520
whom you like,

489
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,520
you'll get further and further away

490
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,520
if you keep everything in your heart.

491
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,520
What a coincidence.

492
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,520
I'm not interested in the case.

493
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,520
I'm interested in you.

494
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,520
I'm interested in you.

495
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,520
Someone said the same thing.

496
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,520
Who is it?

497
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,520
Someone who asked me to fight for you

498
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,520
to get the person who is qualified to enter the inspection office.

499
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,520
Please grant me.

500
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,520
Miss Xu's inspection record

501
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,520
has already reached the standard of the inspection office.

502
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,520
I've wanted to take her back to the home many times.

503
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,520
But why didn't Miss Xu

504
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,520
ask me to come back?

505
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,520
His Majesty's duty is to keep the country safe.

506
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,520
I'm a heavy-handed soldier.

507
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,520
So I'm willing to support the inspection office.

508
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,520
Besides, it's also stipulated

509
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,520
that I can't enter the inspection office

510
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,520
unless I die within the three tribes.

511
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,520
Although you're a good fighter,

512
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,520
you're not the one

513
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,520
who's qualified to enter the inspection office.

514
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,520
Are you afraid that your relationship with him

515
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,520
will affect his career?

516
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,520
No.

517
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,520
The inspection office

518
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,520
is not a matter of relationship

519
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,520
for Lin Lang.

520
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,520
It's a matter of dream.

521
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,520
I want to help him fulfill his dream.

522
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,520
Miss Xu is wise in her actions

523
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,520
and fair in her actions.

524
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,520
But now you're asking me

525
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,520
to force her to fight for her qualification.

526
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,520
Isn't that defying her duty?

527
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,520
The inspection office can treat Lin Lang fairly.

528
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,520
With Lin Lang's ability,

529
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,520
I believe she can enter the inspection office.

530
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,520
As for me...

531
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,520
I'm willing to help him

532
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,520
fulfill his dream

533
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,520
for the rest of my life.

534
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,520
Why are you here?

535
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,520
Are you

536
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,520
here to

537
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,520
help me

538
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,520
fulfill my dream?

539
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,520
I'm here to help you

540
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,520
fulfill your dream.

541
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,520
I'm here to help you

542
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,520
fulfill your dream.

543
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,520
But today, I and my mother...

544
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,520
Idiot.

545
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,520
Who allowed you to make the decision alone?

546
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,520
Mr. Geng,

547
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,520
you usually keep a low profile.

548
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,520
You can't hide this from me.

549
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,520
I just want to ask you one thing.

550
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,520
Will you marry me?

551
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,520
Of course I will.

552
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,520
Then we'll get married in the spring.

553
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,520
Although my father passed away,

554
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,520
I still have to get married

555
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,520
and get married.

556
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,520
I can't lose any of them.

557
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,520
I don't want my father to ask me in his dream

558
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,520
how I can marry him so casually.

559
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,520
But

560
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,520
you've always wanted to marry Diancha Temple.

561
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,520
Diancha Temple is my past dream.

562
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,520
And you

563
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,520
are my present and future dream.

564
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,520
There's one more thing.

565
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,520
You're not allowed to hide anything from me.

566
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,520
There's one more thing.

567
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,520
This...

568
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,520
This is...

569
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,520
When I first came to Mount Gu,

570
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,520
I saw your tool

571
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:37,520
and felt sorry for it.

572
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,520
I've been doing this

573
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,520
for you since I was a child.

574
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,520
You made this yourself?

575
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,520
I've never done this before.

576
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,520
So I'm doing it slowly.

577
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,520
But

578
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,520
it's like checking a case.

579
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,520
I'm slowly finding the truth.

580
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,520
You're always like this.

581
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,520
You've done so much for me.

582
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,520
But I

583
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,520
can't do anything for you.

584
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,520
I don't need you to do anything.

585
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,520
I just hope

586
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,520
you can be happy.

587
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,520
Your Highness.

588
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,520
Your Highness.

589
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,520
Your Highness.

590
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,520
One more on the left.

591
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,160
No.

592
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,120
No.

593
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,360
You're too tall.

594
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,120
Young Master.

595
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,600
Can you stop being so serious?

596
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,240
No.

597
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,520
Lin Lang's wedding

598
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,760
should be more important than usual.

599
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,040
The right side.

600
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:24,840
The floor.

601
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:26,680
Too much.

602
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:27,600
A little higher.

603
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,200
Yes.

604
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,600
It seems that this task is for you.

605
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,760
You're really a good person.

606
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:34,800
If you follow the original plan

607
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,560
and start the Spring Festival,

608
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,800
I can prepare better.

609
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:37,800
Who told you to suddenly

610
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,960
get married a year ago?

611
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:39,680
You're making me

612
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,560
lose my temper.

613
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,240
Lin Lang and I

614
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,720
finally made it to this day.

615
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,160
We didn't get married for a day.

616
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,640
We were not at ease for a day.

617
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,960
Thank you for scolding Young Master.

618
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,400
Please take it easy.

619
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,560
Don't make a scene with me.

620
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:52,840
We're brothers.

621
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:53,520
You can count on me.

622
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:54,960
I'll

623
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,440
count you as a discount.

624
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:58,800
But

625
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,480
I've counted it in and out.

626
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,640
About Miss Xin'er,

627
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,320
you told Lin Lang about it, right?

628
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,680
The day Lin Lang disappeared,

629
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,400
your reaction

630
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,600
was unbearable.

631
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,360
You won't tell Lin Lang, right?

632
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,680
Why should I tell him?

633
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,720
But as a brother,

634
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:20,840
I hope you

635
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,840
can talk to Lin Lang

636
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,640
about what you really want to know.

637
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,600
Don't make that face.

638
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,600
Or you'll be a bad guy

639
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,680
after I get married.

640
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,080
I won't beat you to death then.

641
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,800
That's because you know who

642
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,800
Lin Lang will choose.

643
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:40,560
Forget it.

644
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,200
Our goals are the same.

645
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,280
As long as Lin Lang is happy,

646
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,520
I hope you won't let him down.

647
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,120
And don't let me down

648
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,280
for what I've done to you.

649
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,120
You look so beautiful.

650
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,320
How cute you are.

651
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,920
I got nervous at the wedding.

652
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:18,080
I thought I had to

653
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:18,600
make her change her dress.

654
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,440
But now it seems it fits.

655
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,640
You don't need to change it anymore.

656
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,120
Your wedding dress is pretty.

657
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,280
This is my first time seeing you leave.

658
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,080
Didn't your father

659
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,680
visit your home to get married before?

660
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,200
We are Тамuzi.

661
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,440
No one takes pleasure in our marriage.

662
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,080
But there were a lot of people

663
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,320
who legislativeと strike a war with us.

664
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,760
Miss Xu must have heard

665
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,360
that you don't want to

666
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,440
But now you're wearing wedding clothes.

667
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,920
I think the young master doesn't deserve you.

668
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,960
You're so stubborn.

669
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,040
I'm not afraid to say that.

670
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:48,960
I'll be unhappy.

671
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,120
What?

672
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,760
Are you happy just because I lied to you?

673
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,440
You and Sima Kong are really

674
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,480
not a family.

675
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,480
You're not a family.

676
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:58,720
Miss Xu,

677
00:30:58,920 --> 00:30:59,840
before the wedding,

678
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,760
I'll teach you some etiquette.

679
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,040
For example,

680
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,520
the two pieces you just sold are a bit big.

681
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,880
The right size should be like mine.

682
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,320
The shoulder is flat and the foot is straight.

683
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:12,320
The tip of the foot and the toe are always straight.

684
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,520
Just like this.

685
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:15,560
Did you see that?

686
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,000
How is it?

687
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,880
I'm used to it.

688
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,480
I've never noticed these etiquettes.

689
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:27,880
Miss Xu,

690
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,600
Gu Shan Yi is a rough guy.

691
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:33,360
But Master Xu is from a family of scholars.

692
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,040
He's very particular about etiquette.

693
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,720
He has asked someone to invite your uncle to come to watch the ceremony.

694
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,320
He must value it very much.

695
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,640
You should practice more.

696
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:47,360
Will Master Xu dislike me?

697
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,440
He won't. Don't worry.

698
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,640
Master Xu.

699
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,520
Who wouldn't dislike a beautiful daughter-in-law like her?

700
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:11,040
I just got this earring from the Hall of Thunder.

701
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:13,000
It's a gift from the Hall Master's wife.

702
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,920
I thought you would be a coroner in the future.

703
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,960
The jade bracelet and the ring

704
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,600
will affect your skills.

705
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,520
This is perfect for you.

706
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,120
Such an expensive gift.

707
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,600
I was a woman of no value in my previous life.

708
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:30,400
Now I can see my son and the man in the middle of the line.

709
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,920
I'm really happy for you.

710
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,960
Thank you, Miss Xu.

711
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,320
Thank you, Master Xu.

712
00:32:40,040 --> 00:33:03,520
This earring is a pattern of the

713
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,520
jade bracelet.

714
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,680
You two can't bear it.

715
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,760
Master Xu.

716
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:10,880
Master Xu.

717
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:11,920
Master Xu ordered me

718
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,960
not to let you two meet before the wedding.

719
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,240
I'm sorry.

720
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:16,680
Please, Master Xu.

721
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,880
What are you doing?

722
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:21,400
I'll let you call me Master Xu for two more days.

723
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,480
I'll change my name in a few days.

724
00:33:33,520 --> 00:34:01,220
Talking with

725
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:06,520
If we can meet again,

726
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:09,520
how will it be?

727
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:15,520
Thank you for looking back at the past with a glance.

728
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:19,520
Time.
