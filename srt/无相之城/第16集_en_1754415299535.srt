I won't let you die before I go back.

17
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,960
I won't let you hurt Ling Lang.

18
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,400
Okay.

19
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,200
Are you okay?

20
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,040
I'm fine.

21
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,360
You always look like this.

22
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,720
You're so stubborn.

23
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,960
I'm worried about you.

24
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,720
Were you outside the door just now?

25
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:02,880
What?

26
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,520
Although I'm just a spy,

27
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,040
do I need to report to Master Geng

Nothing

41
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,560
How is the deer's poison?

42
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,840
Thanks to your medicine.

43
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,480
The deer's poison is fine now.

44
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,280
That's good.

45
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,480
What kind of medicine is this?

46
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,200
It can even cure the poison of the five-sister.

47
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,920
No matter what kind of medicine it is,

48
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,280
it can save the deer's poison and change you.

49
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,800
You're always good at it.

50
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,960
You did this

51
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,320
for us?

52
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,560
The deer's poison was also to save me.

53
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,840
Now it's even.

54
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,040
How is it even?

55
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,560
I checked your pulse.

56
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,640
You've already lost all your martial arts.

57
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,080
What happened

58
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,560
on the way to find the medicine?

59
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,240
I just returned what didn't belong to me

60
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,680
to the place that didn't belong to me.

61
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,600
You don't have to care about it.

62
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,720
Now,

63
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,800
I can face you

64
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,960
with my real face.

65
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,200
It's a good thing for me.

66
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,280
It's hot outside.

67
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,600
What's there to cover your eyes with?

68
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,200
How do you know I'm hot?

69
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,200
Lie down.

70
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,280
Lu Jiu told me.

71
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,440
She knew it too?

72
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,920
Since you were in prison and she was released,

73
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,080
she knew that you were not from a simple family.

74
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,440
On the way,

75
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,240
you're good at various skills and skills.

76
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,440
You're brave and ambitious.

77
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,840
Except for Tang Men,

78
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,800
there's no one else who's as talented as you.

79
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,720
Talented?

80
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,560
I've been investigating you all the way.

81
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,080
You never looked down on me?

82
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,400
We're both foreign businessmen.

83
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,680
We rely on our cooking skills.

84
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,280
There's no need to look down on us.

85
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,400
Besides,

86
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,640
you're investigating us

87
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,840
because you're ordered to.

88
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,560
You've never hurt us on the way.

89
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,080
We've never guarded against you.

90
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,280
Then you don't need to feel guilty for me.

91
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,200
It's worth it

92
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,040
to do all these for your friend.

93
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,560
We're good friends for life.

94
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,800
Good friends for life.

95
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,680
Chief Shao.

96
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,240
You're standing at the door.

97
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,560
I'm afraid that others might not know

98
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,600
that you're a spy.

99
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,080
Chief Shao.

100
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,160
Can you be quiet

101
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,840
in the early morning?

102
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,560
I'm sorry.

103
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,560
I'm sorry.

104
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,600
I'm sorry.

105
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,600
I'm sorry.

106
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,720
I'm sorry.

107
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,840
I'm sorry.

108
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,960
I'm sorry.

109
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,080
I'm sorry.

110
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,200
I'm sorry.

111
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,320
I'm sorry.

112
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:45,960
I'm sorry.

113
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:47,800
I'm sorry.

114
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,440
I thought you were hiding well.

115
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,400
Finally,

116
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,800
they've noticed my identity.

117
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,760
What?

118
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,760
Then why are they buttered up?

119
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,720
They've never thought about

120
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,600
fighting me.

121
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,360
Chief Shao's friends

122
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,160
I'm here

123
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,920
to say goodbye to you.

124
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,120
I've never

125
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,120
treated you as a subordinate for so many years.

126
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:26,960
If you don't mind,

127
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,920
I hope you can remember

128
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,120
to have a friend like me.

129
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,600
You're so mean.

130
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,760
No wonder the master wants to kick you out.

131
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,480
Your temperament

132
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,800
is even worse than Lu Jiu's.

133
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,520
Alright.

134
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,960
I have a mission to complete.

135
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,800
I'll take my leave.

136
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,000
You're gone,

137
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,240
yet you still have such a romantic relationship.

138
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,840
I can't bear to part with you.

139
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,960
I'm almost recovered.

140
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,720
Why do you still want to take such a bitter medicine?

141
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,160
The medicine is bitter.

142
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,760
Your poison was forced to be taken.

143
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,960
It's hurt your vitality.

144
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,560
You should recuperate.

145
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,960
Otherwise, you'll have a cold.

146
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,120
What if you get old?

147
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,400
I'll get old...

148
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,160
I'll be fine with you

149
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,880
being by my side.

150
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,440
Who else is by your side?

151
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,400
Your wife will be by your side.

152
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,520
I'm going to the Overwatch Department

153
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,120
to complete my mission.

154
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,560
I'll be there to help you.

155
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,800
You're right.

156
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,520
I must have been married

157
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,720
at that time.

158
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,840
I just don't know

159
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,680
what my wife looks like.

160
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:56,880
She must be a noble and a family of scholars.

161
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:58,920
Yes.

162
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,080
Your Lu family is a rich family.

163
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,760
Only a noble and a family of scholars

164
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,800
can match you.

165
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,600
That's right.

166
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,240
I remember

167
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,680
when I went to your house last time,

168
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,880
I saw many

169
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,280
medical books.

170
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,200
You're a noble and a family of scholars.

171
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,560
You're a traitor!

172
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,480
Be gentle.

173
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,120
I just came back

174
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,600
from the Ghost Gate Pass.

175
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,400
You almost

176
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,800
knocked me down.

177
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:25,880
You dare to...

178
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:33,880
I...

179
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,320
I mean it.

180
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,400
When I was in a coma,

181
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,760
I heard

182
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,160
someone talking to me by the bedside.

183
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,040
They even fed me

184
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,320
in a special way.

185
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,840
Was it you?

186
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,040
The medicine is getting cold.

187
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,120
You'd better eat it.

188
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,240
I'm full.

189
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,080
It's not bad to take medicine.

190
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,520
I have a condition.

191
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,680
I want to eat ice soup and gourd.

192
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,000
You're like a child.

193
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,080
I'll go and buy it for you now.

194
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:38,220
Gu!

195
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,280
Since you're here,

196
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,240
come in!

197
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,000
Yes.

198
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,960
I know you've not liked medicine since you were little.

199
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:17,300
So I always An observations first.

200
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,680
So

201
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,960
I didn't mean to hurt you.

202
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,200
I just...

203
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,040
You just wanted to hurt the person I care about the most.

204
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,160
Lin Lang is outside.

205
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,680
You should have heard it.

206
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,240
Lin Lang and I

207
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,000
have each other in our hearts.

208
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,680
No matter what happened in the past,

209
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,280
it has nothing to do with me now.

210
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,160
I'm sorry.

211
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:47,800
I'm sorry.

212
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,520
What happened a few years ago?

213
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,400
I've been waiting for you

214
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,080
for so many years.

215
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,320
Is this the result of my waiting?

216
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,160
You don't have to wait for me.

217
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,120
I once

218
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,800
wanted to find out the truth.

219
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,160
Because of this,

220
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,240
I hurt Lin Lang.

221
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,240
I've figured it out now.

222
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,680
I'm very happy

223
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,080
at this moment.

224
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:13,800
Let bygones

225
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:15,800
be bygones.

226
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,160
No.

227
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,200
I have to find out the truth.

228
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,680
I have to give myself an explanation.

229
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,520
Here, Lin Lang.

230
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,280
Can you have a good meal?

231
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,920
What's wrong with you,

232
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,080
my military counselor?

233
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,240
Yes.

234
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,800
Aren't we all eating?

235
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,480
To be honest,

236
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,720
I've sent the kidnapped people

237
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,800
back to my home these days.

238
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,080
I've checked the population of the station

239
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,800
and didn't find any people named Xu.

240
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,080
Lin Lang,

241
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,000
are you sure Uncle is in the station?

242
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,840
Father only said that when he arrived at the station,

243
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,040
Uncle would come to me.

244
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,280
But I've been in the station for so long

245
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,000
and I haven't heard from Uncle.

246
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,720
My brother is also

247
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,520
not in the camp.

248
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,520
The previous clue

249
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,520
pointed to the station.

250
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,920
I wanted to find out

251
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,120
the truth of the case in the home.

252
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,480
I didn't expect so many things to be involved.

253
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,120
Now,

254
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,640
thanks to Mr. Geng's help,

255
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,760
we've got rid of the criminals.

256
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,560
But I think

257
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,600
it's not over yet.

258
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,080
What do you think?

259
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:01,840
As far as I know,

260
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,360
Tian Luo and Tang Wen

261
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,680
used the drug addicts to do things.

262
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,000
The criminal, Shounao,

263
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,680
also cooperated with him

264
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,360
because Ye Mei was a member of Tian Luo.

265
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,040
This place belongs to Mount Gu.

266
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,040
So I think

267
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,360
Mount Gu

268
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,160
may have someone

269
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,400
in charge of their back.

270
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,200
You're right.

271
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,960
After An Duohao was kidnapped,

272
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,680
we went to Mount Gu

273
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:21,800
to find out the truth.

274
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,560
But the master of Mount Gu

275
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,200
is very mysterious.

276
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,040
His nickname is

277
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:26,920
the Washed Woman.

278
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,800
Very few people have seen his true face.

279
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,720
The Washed Woman?

280
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:31,880
Such an amazing person

281
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,360
is actually an old woman.

282
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,200
To be able to control Mount Gu

283
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,680
and lead a fierce

284
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,400
martial arts world,

285
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,000
he must be a powerful man

286
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,080
with a strong body.

287
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,040
If he's really an old woman,

288
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,280
I'd like to meet him.

289
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,880
He's interested in other women

290
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,360
no matter how old they are.

291
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,960
He's just picky about me.

292
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,440
Why do you

293
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,080
always treat me like a coward these days?

294
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,960
You're a wooden man.

295
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,080
You don't understand even if I tell you.

296
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,240
What does he mean?

297
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:05,440
Mr. Geng,

298
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:06,920
I'm not sure

299
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,360
about this matter.

300
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,080
But what I know now is

301
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,120
that students are really bad.

302
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,240
What does he mean?

303
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,280
I suddenly feel that

304
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,440
it's easier to kill a love.

305
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,680
Dead wooden man.

306
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:30,960
Unrequited love.

307
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:32,760
Dead wooden man.

308
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:34,760
Dead wooden man.

309
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,200
He doesn't understand anything.

310
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,520
Who told you to follow me?

311
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,360
Why is it you?

312
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,320
Who do you think it is?

313
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,080
I didn't think of anyone.

314
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,680
Mr. Geng's character is good.

315
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,440
But in this aspect,

316
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,280
he hasn't started a alliance yet.

317
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,720
He needs you to guide him more.

318
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,000
How to guide him?

319
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,560
I'll tell you.

320
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,680
I'll tell you.

321
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:11,720
I'll tell you.

322
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:12,520
I'll tell you.

323
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,360
I'll tell you.

324
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,240
I'll tell you.

325
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:14,960
I'll tell you.

326
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,840
I've been standing for a long time.

327
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,200
My back doesn't feel good.

328
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,600
Sister, come here.

329
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,200
Sister,

330
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,760
if you feel uncomfortable in this chair,

331
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,120
I'll get you a cushion.

332
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,000
I asked someone

333
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,200
to bring it from the capital.

334
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:30,800
Sit down.

335
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:31,840
I'll talk to you.

336
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,240
I'll tell you.

337
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,720
My house is a coffin shop.

338
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,000
It's very narrow.

339
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,720
I sleep in the coffin every day.

340
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,680
Sitting on the paper,

341
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,880
it's not so precious.

342
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,880
How uncomfortable it is!

343
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,080
Look at you.

344
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,720
You're with Lord Geng every day.

345
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:46,920
He's thinking about the case.

346
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,480
But you're not well.

347
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:49,600
Of course, he thinks

348
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:50,680
you're not on the same side.

349
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,800
He's hiding from you everywhere.

350
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,640
It makes sense.

351
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,800
What kind of girl

352
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,480
has Lu Jiu never seen before?

353
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,960
In the end, he fell

354
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,440
under my spell.

355
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,040
You're really capable.

356
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,200
Sister,

357
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,840
can you teach me?

358
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,400
Do you really think I'm so powerful?

359
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,520
Then, based on your sincerity,

360
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,920
I know you.

361
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,400
According to the book,

362
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,560
love is more important than anything else.

363
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:15,720
First,

364
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,640
you should buy a gift for him.

365
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,000
Why is it a book?

366
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:20,840
It's said that

367
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,080
you should teach yourself.

368
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,160
You...

369
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,440
Are you making up things?

370
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,720
No.

371
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,000
It's common.

372
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,680
It's because everyone is like this.

373
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,120
Let me tell you.

374
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,200
Men are often like children.

375
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,800
You give him some good things,

376
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,680
he'll be very happy.

377
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,040
But our adults

378
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,760
are as rich as gold and gold.

379
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,720
How can he be happy

380
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,000
because of some small things?

381
00:17:46,160 --> 00:18:04,020
Lu Jiu was also a

382
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,300
good girl.

383
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,380
I want to

384
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:08,500
use the tools to

385
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,500
make the body unsuitable for water.

386
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,380
Just listen to me.

387
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:14,300
I'm ready.

388
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:19,100
Love is more important than anything else.

389
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:21,620
Is what Ling'er said reliable?

390
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:23,700
What are you talking about?

391
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,020
The storm has just subsided.

392
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:27,540
People are afraid.

393
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,780
We should take more measures to prevent the situation.

394
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:31,540
Let's turn on the lanterns.

395
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:32,180
Mr. Geng.

396
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:32,820
Mr. Geng.

397
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:34,180
Thanks to the officials of the Imperial Examination Department.

398
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:34,660
Get up.

399
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:36,060
Our family is reunited.

400
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:37,740
This is our duty.

401
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:38,940
Xu Linglang is

402
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,220
doing a medical check-up in front of us

403
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:41,540
to treat everyone's injuries.

404
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,740
After all, we have been in that environment for so long.

405
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,140
We still need to be careful.

406
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:48,180
But I have been away from home for a long time.

407
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:49,460
I have no income.

408
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:50,220
I'm afraid...

409
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:51,020
Don't worry.

410
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:52,820
The Imperial Examination Department will pay for this medical check-up.

411
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,500
You can go to see the doctor as you like.

412
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:56,380
Thank you, sir.

413
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:56,940
Thank you, sir.

414
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:57,620
Thank you, sir.

415
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:58,540
Thank you, sir.

416
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:02,740
Let's go.

417
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:03,900
Let's go.

418
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:07,300
Linglang is right.

419
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:09,100
The official is dedicated to the investigation of the case.

420
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:11,060
He must be happy to hear the words.

421
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:22,700
Sir.

422
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:26,260
This is the case of the case I was talking about last year.

423
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:28,340
I have also done some sorting and sorting

424
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,460
for the case year and the case type.

425
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:30,620
It's convenient for you to check.

426
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:32,580
Really?

427
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:35,900
There are too many cases recorded in the Security Bureau.

428
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:37,900
We have to spend a lot of time every time we go to investigate.

429
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:40,940
You have made a contribution this time.

430
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:44,580
It seems that Linglang is right.

431
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:45,780
We can only get what we want

432
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,220
to get into our game.

433
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:49,820
Bai Yu, sit here.

434
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:55,380
You came so soon.

435
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,900
I can't act so casually.

436
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:00,380
I don't care.

437
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:05,100
I think you are so handsome.

438
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:11,220
Pretty.

439
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,540
I always dress like this.

440
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,740
You find it pretty today.

441
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:20,420
The case is too nice.

442
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:22,180
If I am the one handling it,

443
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:24,220
it won't be so Meu.

444
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:25,860
You...

445
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:27,580
Aren't you referring to me?

446
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:30,900
Rep agent.

447
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:31,540
Come on.

448
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:41,420
Did I say something wrong?

449
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:46,820
Something's wrong.

450
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:54,540
What are you doing?

451
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:55,500
You're under fire.

452
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:56,540
It's all your fault.

453
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:58,340
You're so happy with all the gifts you received.

454
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,060
You made Lin Lang think

455
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,180
this is the way to win.

456
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,020
Oh.

457
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:04,700
You didn't really give this gift

458
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,460
to Lord Geng, did you?

459
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:07,580
So what?

460
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,460
Is my gift

461
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:12,980
that bad?

462
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:15,420
It's not that bad.

463
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,220
You got the wrong master.

464
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:19,060
Lord Geng is just like Lin Lang.

465
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,980
He's always on the case.

466
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:22,700
But anyway,

467
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:24,660
if I hadn't been so careful,

468
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:25,900
he wouldn't have been so happy.

469
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,300
He's quite cute.

470
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,020
He thinks it's his own merit.

471
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,820
I guess I'm a colluding military counselor.

472
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:37,020
Sit down.

473
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:38,140
What colluding military counselor?

474
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:39,260
For my reputation,

475
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:40,180
I must help you

476
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:41,260
fulfill your wish.

477
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:43,300
How are you going to help me?

478
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,020
It's just that

479
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:51,980
a woman who's afraid of the wolf

480
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,180
is mainly

481
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:55,300
brave and diligent.

482
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,100
When the time is right,

483
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:00,380
she should make some close physical contact.

484
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:03,980
Physical contact?

485
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:07,060
That's too fast.

486
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:08,220
What are you thinking?

487
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:10,500
I mean,

488
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,980
just physical contact.

489
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:13,100
I still remember

490
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:14,140
at that time,

491
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:15,780
I was with Lin Lang

492
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:17,100
to avoid the hunt.

493
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,220
He was carrying me

494
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:19,020
in the woods,

495
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:20,180
running around.

496
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,940
I still remember his heart beat.

497
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:22,860
Dongdong.

498
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:24,500
Dongdong.

499
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:25,860
Dongdong.

500
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:27,420
Dongdong.

501
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:28,980
Dongdong.

502
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:31,220
Where are you, sir?

503
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:33,300
Sir, are you okay?

504
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:33,900
Let's go.

505
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:36,780
Yes.

506
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:38,580
Dongdong.

507
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,260
How is it?

508
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:45,060
Is there a picture?

509
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,620
For the reason that

510
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:48,860
you're right,

511
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:50,460
I'll believe you.

512
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:52,340
What are you doing?

513
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:53,380
Look, I'm

514
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:55,100
holding you in my arms.

515
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,060
You don't have to

516
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,180
hug me secretly.

517
00:22:58,420 --> 00:22:59,060
Tell me.

518
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:00,020
How much do you want?

519
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,500
I'm not Si Ma Kuan.

520
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,420
I don't want money.

521
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:05,780
I want to

522
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:08,860
know how girls

523
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:11,220
like

524
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:14,140
boys to confess.

525
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:16,100
Confess?

526
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:16,940
You and Lin Lang

527
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:18,140
are so close.

528
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:18,940
What are you talking about?

529
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,020
It's different.

530
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:21,900
Although we have the same heart,

531
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,300
there's a layer of paper in the middle.

532
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:26,460
I can't

533
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,820
let girls

534
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:29,020
take the initiative.

535
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:31,140
Fine.

536
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:32,180
I'm not a person

537
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:33,380
who just wants to have fun.

538
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:40,540
All girls

539
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:41,980
dream of the person they love

540
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:43,660
to tell everyone

541
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:45,260
about their love

542
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:46,620
in public.

543
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:47,820
Lin Lang will definitely do that.

544
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:50,100
Okay.

545
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:52,180
Let's do that.

546
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:53,500
Good luck.

547
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:54,860
Good luck.

548
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:57,660
Go, first sheet.

549
00:24:58,620 --> 00:24:59,100
Go.

550
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:06,700
Your Excellency.

551
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,340
Don't call me your Excellency.

552
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:11,940
You would looks FEMALE ten.

553
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:13,380
From now on,

554
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:14,740
call me Zhou Lang.

555
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:33,960
Al própria

556
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:42,100
it's you

557
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:52,940
yours

558
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:54,140
it's Archery

559
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:54,820
swear

560
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:55,420
yes

561
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,420
Thank you, Lady Xu.

562
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:58,180
Lady Xu.

563
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:13,340
Thank you, Lady Xu.

564
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:15,060
Lady Xu.

565
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:26,820
Lady Xu.

566
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:28,080
Chu2

567
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:28,420
Chu2

568
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,340
Chu3

569
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:31,500
Chu4

570
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,160
Oh.

571
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:39,860
Mom.

572
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,640
I'm sorry that I can't find him.

573
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:50,340
Brother,

574
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,700
show him to多少人

575
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:54,540
I'm sorry.

576
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,620
Although I'm the one who planned the flower,

577
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,060
I did it for you.

578
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:06,860
Lu Jiu, look what you did!

579
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:11,340
Wait, I didn't do anything wrong.

580
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:12,100
You didn't?

581
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:12,820
They used the medicine

582
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:14,020
to make the fire burn.

583
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:15,540
Gui Hua will make the fire burn.

584
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:16,700
You even stepped on them.

585
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:19,180
Stop!

586
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,260
I really didn't know it was like this.

587
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:21,700
I just wanted to remind you.

588
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,940
It's not easy to understand.

589
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:28,620
It's all your fault.

590
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:30,060
You made the bad idea.

591
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,620
My face is all lost.

592
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,340
How dare you talk about me?

593
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:35,820
I was only a little bit

594
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,220
better than Lin Lang.

595
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:38,740
Now I'm better.

596
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:39,860
I'm better than him.

597
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:42,700
It's because you made a mistake.

598
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:44,420
You and Lin Lang are the same.

599
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:45,820
You're not the same as him.

600
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:47,260
You're the same as him.

601
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:48,500
You're the same as him.

602
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,500
You're the same as him.

603
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,620
You're the same as him.

604
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:51,780
You're the same as him.

605
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:52,780
You're the same as him.

606
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:53,860
Lin Lang is so affectionate.

607
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:54,980
We all saw it.

608
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:55,740
He even made a big and fierce face

609
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,060
like me.

610
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:06,900
You don't understand

611
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:08,060
my situation.

612
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:12,900
Is there anything

613
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,100
we don't know about?

614
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:18,980
I had a engagement with someone else.

615
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:19,820
What?

616
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:23,380
Does Lin Lang know about it?

617
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:24,700
He knows.

618
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:26,580
The girl who assassinated my sister.

619
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,740
The bad girl from Tian Luo?

620
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:31,100
It's normal for you

621
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,820
to choose Lin Lang between her and him.

622
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,460
The point is

623
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:40,460
I was also Tian Luo's.

624
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:41,820
You're now

625
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,140
the same as him.

626
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,740
And you broke up

627
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:46,380
with the girl who taught the girl.

628
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:48,140
What are you worried about?

629
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:49,860
Actually,

630
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:54,180
my biggest concern

631
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:57,940
is when I'm with Ye Mei.

632
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:01,540
I can feel

633
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:04,620
I'm relaxed.

634
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:06,700
Anyway,

635
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:12,820
when I'm with Lin Lang,

636
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:17,060
I'm afraid that I might say something

637
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:18,940
and make him unhappy.

638
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:20,020
And

639
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:22,220
I can't even

640
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:25,300
consider his safety.

641
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,420
So I...

642
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:31,020
Do you still have Ye Mei in your heart?

643
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:32,020
So you want to lie to yourself and Lin Lang

644
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,380
with your confession?

645
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:34,660
No.

646
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:35,260
I...

647
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:40,380
Sima Kong, are you crazy?

648
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:42,380
Yes, I'm crazy.

649
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:44,060
If I were not crazy,

650
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:45,380
I wouldn't have given Lin Lang

651
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:46,540
to someone like you.

652
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:49,140
You admit it?

653
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:51,220
So what if I admit it?

654
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:52,420
So what if I don't?

655
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:54,500
Anyway,

656
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:55,380
I won't watch you

657
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:56,500
fool other women

658
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:57,620
to lie to Lin Lang.

659
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:58,900
I didn't.

660
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,260
Wait.

661
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,420
You like Lin Lang too?

662
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:05,300
You knew it long ago.

663
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:07,340
You two are still brothers.

664
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:09,620
And you quit because of your brother.

665
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:12,100
It's so touching.

666
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:13,620
I'm not doing this for him.

667
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:15,220
From the beginning,

668
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:16,940
I just want Lin Lang to be happy.

669
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:18,820
Every thought of him

670
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:20,900
is in my heart.

671
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:23,100
Every drop of tears

672
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:25,660
is in my pain.

673
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:30,420
As long as he's happy,

674
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:33,620
it doesn't matter who he chooses.

675
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:39,300
As long as he's happy,

676
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:44,700
I understand.

677
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:46,420
I understand.

678
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:47,780
Thank you, Brother Sima.

679
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:53,780
Are you really going to

680
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:55,100
give Lin Lang to him?

681
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:58,420
I just said

682
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:01,980
as long as he's happy,

683
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:04,740
I'll be happy.

684
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:17,060
Why did you bring me here?

685
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:18,660
You were always messing around during the day.

686
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:19,740
Now,

687
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:20,740
I've been here for a day.

688
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:21,700
I want to rest.

689
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,100
Give it to me.

690
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:26,380
Don't worry about that.

691
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:29,220
I just want to take a good look at you.

692
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:30,220
Look.

693
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:31,860
Because you killed the criminal,

694
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,620
they can now be with their families

695
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:35,020
and live in harmony.

696
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:36,820
You're a palace official.

697
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:39,140
You're a palace official too.

698
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:40,700
I'm a palace official.

699
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,140
I'm a palace official.

700
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:43,620
I'm a palace official.

701
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:45,340
You're a palace official too.

702
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:47,740
Since we're both palace officials,

703
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:49,980
shouldn't we celebrate it?

704
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:53,140
The investigation bureau

705
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,740
has appointed a person to be the official.

706
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,420
He's a criminal.

707
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:58,220
Great!

708
00:31:58,220 --> 00:31:59,220
Great!

709
00:31:59,220 --> 00:31:59,900
Great!

710
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:01,020
He's a genius.

711
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,260
Look over there.

712
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:07,780
How much is this?

713
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:12,980
Here.

714
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:15,180
Here.

715
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:18,460
The world is on fire.

716
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:20,740
It's the best scene in the world.

717
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:21,740
Yes.

718
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:25,380
We met in the world.

719
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:28,220
The disaster is also in the world.

720
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:38,900
Lingla,

721
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:42,060
I was too concerned about the past.

722
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:43,500
So,

723
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:45,100
I've been

724
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:47,780
careful and careful.

725
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:50,620
Although I feel a little free

726
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:52,420
when I'm with Ye Mei,

727
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:55,380
I've known

728
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:56,420
your marriage with Ye Mei.

729
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:59,020
You don't have to emphasize that I'm the extra one.

730
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:10,460
You misunderstood me.

731
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:13,900
I mean

732
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:16,220
I'm careful and careful

733
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:19,620
because I care more about you.

734
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:23,420
Every move you make

735
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:26,380
is a distraction to my mind.

736
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:29,820
You're the person

737
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:32,300
I care about most in my life.

738
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:43,780
Lingla,

739
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:46,500
will you

740
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:50,700
spend your life with me?

741
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:13,500
Man Man,

742
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,860
over there,

743
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:18,420
there

744
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:22,040
is a lớn forced to stop

745
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:25,660
and a big problem,

746
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,940
and strong elements are Old Ji脱

747
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,100
and also free with the weak.

748
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:31,620
So you are able to

749
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,320
get more strip

750
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:37,740
and border damrad

751
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:41,260
equally as that in your court.

752
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:44,340
Your hug ends up in emptyness

753
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:49,080
acute word is just like operation

754
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:52,260
freeze is like the warm moon

755
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:55,340
frozen is like the warm moon

756
00:34:55,340 --> 00:35:00,320
as usual we can't be apart

757
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:03,700
deep into the nocturnal

758
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:06,360
like a flower blooming

759
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:11,680
I write my heart on my paper

760
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:17,480
In my dream, I am a man in my life

761
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:23,480
In my dream, I am a man in my life

762
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:29,480
I will never forget you for my whole life

763
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:34,680
I have no more worries in the mountains and rivers

764
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:40,680
I will never forget you for my whole life

765
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:46,680
I have no more worries in the mountains and rivers

00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:52,680
If we can meet again, how will it be?

00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:58,680
I write my heart on my paper

768
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:04,680
In my dream, I am a man in my life
