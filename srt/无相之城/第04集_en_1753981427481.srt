1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,660
bedeutet

2
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Episode 16

3
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,520
The whereabouts of Lu Jiu

4
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,920
has been searched by the government.

5
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,480
It seems that they have a spy

6
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,760
around him.

7
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,640
Your bag is broken.

8
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,600
Let's see what you dropped.

9
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,680
What?

10
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,240
The token my parents left me

11
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,280
is missing.

12
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,240
I didn't hear anything

13
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,760
from the place along the way.

14
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,080
Did you see it

15
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,080
when you walked behind me?

16
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,320
Did you leave it in the teahouse?

17
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,280
I'll go back and look for it.

18
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,000
I'll go with you.

19
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,360
You're on the wanted list now.

20
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,600
You often go back and forth.

21
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,480
Don't bother.

22
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,800
I'll go over the small path.

23
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,600
I'll be back soon.

24
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,440
Be careful.

25
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,880
Lu Jiu left the city by a coffin car.

26
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,640
This is their way to the capital.

27
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,920
Go on the right side of this road.

28
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,360
We'll catch up with them soon.

29
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,680
Why do we go on this road?

30
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,520
This is the official road.

31
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,880
How could they be driven away

32
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,000
by the people who were wanted?

33
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,720
Check the case.

34
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,600
Except for the fact that

35
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,000
they were searched by someone,

36
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,960
they also need to learn

37
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,920
to think from the suspect's perspective.

38
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,360
You mean

39
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,320
they need to become the perpetrators first?

40
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,280
If you say so,

41
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,400
are there any good people

42
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,400
in the investigation department?

43
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,160
I understand what you mean.

44
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,360
Isn't it just thinking from the suspect's perspective?

45
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,080
Lu Jiu and the people who helped him out

46
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,280
will definitely choose to

47
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,360
interrupt the official's sight.

48
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,520
They will definitely go to the official road.

49
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,080
How is it? Am I smart?

50
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,320
Thank you, Master.

51
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,440
Don't call me Master.

52
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,360
Don't call me Master.

53
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,240
But

54
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,240
I heard some immortals

55
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,880
taught their elders

56
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,600
this way.

57
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,960
Don't do it here.

58
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,080
He has never been so angry before.

59
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,160
My Lord.

60
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,560
My Lord.

61
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,040
What else do you want?

62
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:22,720
Go.

63
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,040
Be careful.

64
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,280
Thank you, Master.

65
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,320
Go.

66
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,600
The investigation department

67
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,040
dares to meddle in my business.

68
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,000
My Lord.

69
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,640
Even Geng Zhao wants to be my enemy.

70
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,960
Tell the spy in the investigation department

71
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,520
that I want to know everything about Geng Zhao.

72
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:02,600
My Lord.

73
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,040
The investigation department and Tian Luo

74
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,280
are not under the control of the six departments.

75
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,560
I heard that

76
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,440
Geng Zhao met His Majesty

77
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,560
before he left the capital.

78
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,400
I'm afraid...

79
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,120
What are you afraid of?

80
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,480
The investigation department

81
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,120
is just a power

82
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,000
that the six departments are covering up for Tian Luo.

83
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,880
It's just a relief.

84
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,320
What Tian Luo can do for the court

85
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,120
is to check the investigation department

86
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,560
and make sure nothing happens.

87
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,280
My Lord, you're wise.

88
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,880
Have you cleared

89
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,760
Feng Lei Hall's old department?

90
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,320
My Lord.

91
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,720
A few days ago, the dead body

92
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,120
was sent out and some of them didn't come back.

93
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,040
What did you say?

94
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,520
That man is a bit old.

95
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,120
He has been looking for a way back for 20 years.

96
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,960
He only does coffin business.

97
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,920
He is weak.

98
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,440
I didn't expect

99
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,040
that his daughter

100
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,400
is the coroner

101
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,480
who helped Lu Jiu solve the case.

102
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,760
Xu Lin Lang.

103
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,840
Xu Lin Lang.

104
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,840
The token that father gave me

105
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,200
must not be lost.

106
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,200
It's been so long.

107
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,000
They haven't come back yet.

108
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,280
Are they lost?

109
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,680
Think about the good things.

110
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,880
Maybe they were caught by the government.

111
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,320
You're a mouth of a crow.

112
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,720
We're already in a distance

113
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,920
from Luoyang.

114
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,000
I hope that the Japanese

115
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,480
didn't chase us.

116
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,720
No.

117
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,760
The location is in the south of the city.

118
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,800
We can't go there.

119
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,800
We can't go there.

120
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,800
We can't go there.

121
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,800
We can't go there.

122
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,800
We can't go there.

123
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,800
We can't go there.

124
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,800
We can't go there.

125
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,800
We can't go there.

126
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,800
We can't go there.

127
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,800
We can't go there.

128
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,800
We can't go there.

129
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,400
The Japanese are in the south of the city.

130
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,400
They often have soldiers to patrol.

131
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,400
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

132
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,800
Xu Lin Lang is no longer wanted.

133
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,800
He won't be in danger.

134
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,400
But you're different.

135
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,400
You're the one who got him involved.

136
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
You designed all this?

137
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,200
Yes.

138
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,000
I just want to get rid of Xu Lin Lang.

139
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,800
Have you ever thought about it?

140
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,400
Lin Lang sent us out

141
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,400
in a way of mourning.

142
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,200
If the soldiers in the city

143
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,400
didn't find him going back,

144
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,800
they would suspect that he's related to us.

145
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,800
So what?

146
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,200
We've all left.

147
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,400
How can the government be sure

148
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,600
that he sent us out?

149
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,200
The government's job is lost.

150
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,600
It's not for any good.

151
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,400
He risked his life to save a man

152
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,400
who only met him once.

153
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,400
How could there be such a fool in this world?

154
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,000
You mean

155
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,800
Lin Lang was sent by the government to spy on me?

156
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,800
You're finally awake.

157
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,400
I don't know about others.

158
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,600
But Lin Lang

159
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,200
is not that kind of person.

160
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,000
If you're not afraid of being poisoned,

161
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,000
then go ahead.

162
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,800
You've been poisoned.

163
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,400
I'll detoxify the poison for you every seven days.

164
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,800
You know what?

165
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,200
In front of the living,

166
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,200
friendship is not worth a penny.

167
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,800
It's a pity

168
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,000
that you didn't count it.

169
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,800
The Soul-locking Powder.

170
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,800
The Soul-locking Powder

171
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
is also in your heart.

172
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,000
It's called

173
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
self-sacrifice.

174
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,000
For me,

175
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,800
friendship is more important than living.

176
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,000
My family members are missing.

177
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,800
If I lose this friend,

178
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I'll be dead.

179
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,200
What's the point?

180
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,000
Lin Lang.

181
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,200
Wait.

182
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,000
Why are you here?

183
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,600
I'm worried about you.

184
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,200
I'm not wanted by the government.

185
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,200
It's all your fault.

186
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:37,600
I...

187
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,400
My family is a dance company in the foreign trade.

188
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,400
The foreign trade in the world

189
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,800
is all about food.

190
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,200
Others look down on us.

191
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,800
We can't look down on ourselves.

192
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:56,800
Forget it.

193
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,600
I'll do it for you.

194
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,600
Don't bother.

195
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,600
I know you're strong.

196
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,400
I made the ropes for you.

197
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,600
Let her go.

198
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,600
If you can,

199
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,600
just come at me.

200
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,800
Don't be so self-willed.

201
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,800
I just caught you by the way.

202
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,400
She's the one I want to catch.

203
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Who are you?

204
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,200
I have no grudge against you.

205
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,400
No grudge?

206
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,400
You're not my brother.

207
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,800
Don't you remember?

208
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,600
I have a grudge against you.

209
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,400
Xiaolian and I were a normal couple.

210
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,600
But the heavens are unpredictable.

211
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Our daughter is sick.

212
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
To cure our daughter,

213
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:54,600
Xiaolian buried herself in the flower garden.

214
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,400
Xiaoxiao is a good girl.

215
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,800
She often told me

216
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,200
when she grows up and earns money,

217
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,600
she'll bring her mother back.

218
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,600
We're a family.

219
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,200
The heavens are unfair.

220
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,800
I got the news that day.

221
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,800
When I arrived,

222
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,600
I saw you took her away.

223
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,600
Open the door.

224
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,400
Open it.

225
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,000
I regretted it so much.

226
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,000
What are you doing?

227
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
What are you doing here?

228
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,600
What are you doing?

229
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,200
If it weren't for you,

230
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,200
she wouldn't have died.

231
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,400
Let her go.

232
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,600
Let her go.

233
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,600
Get out of here.

234
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,400
Fengqing.

235
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,000
Are you okay?

236
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,600
To let you feel

237
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,400
the death of your beloved

238
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:56,200
in front of you.

239
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,400
We're not...

240
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,800
Are we?

241
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,600
It's up to me.

242
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,000
You...

243
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Before you came,

244
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,000
Ling Lang couldn't have tested the body.

245
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,200
He lost his mind.

246
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,600
I did everything to let him get rid of it.

247
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,400
Kill me.

248
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:24,800
Father.

249
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,200
Lu Jiu has set off

250
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,400
to the grave as you planned.

251
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,800
Lu Jiu.

252
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,400
Lu Jiu.

253
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,800
Father.

254
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,800
Brother and sister.

255
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,600
I know you're all good people.

256
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,400
Please don't kill my father.

257
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:23,800
Sir.

258
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,800
Now that we know

259
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,800
Lu Jiu and his men have escaped,

260
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,200
why don't we go after them

261
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,800
and return to Luoyang County?

262
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,000
Your Majesty.

263
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,000
Aren't you afraid of Lu Jiu?

264
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,000
Your Majesty.

265
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,600
Are you listening to me?

266
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,000
I'm rude.

267
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,000
But I'm anxious.

268
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,000
What are you anxious about?

269
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,200
I'm afraid Lu Jiu and his men will run away.

270
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,200
Since you taught me last time,

271
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,200
I've figured out

272
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,000
the rules of the investigation department.

273
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:04,000
We차

274
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:24,680
Imagine what a worldwide

275
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,640
the court is here to regulate the law of the Western Regions.

276
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,960
If all of them don't obey,

277
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,600
the world will be in chaos.

278
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,080
Let me ask you.

279
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,040
Is the male body of the Lu family

280
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,200
Lu Mingcheng?

281
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:38,760
No.

282
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,680
Does Lu Jie have any motive to kill?

283
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,720
No.

284
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:43,840
My lord.

285
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,400
Why did you take me

286
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,000
to investigate Lu Jiu's whereabouts?

287
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,840
Do you just want to know where he went?

288
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,160
You never thought of arresting him?

289
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,400
My lord.

290
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,400
Lu Jiu and his men

291
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,960
followed our plan.

292
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,080
He...

293
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,080
You...

294
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:03,520
My lord.

295
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,720
Didn't you say

296
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,400
the third party can't know about this?

297
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,320
Fine.

298
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,040
I was wondering why Lu Jiu

299
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,440
was so easy to get away.

300
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,120
You let him go on purpose.

301
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,080
And you even colluded with this bastard.

302
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,520
You'll understand it later.

303
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,520
I don't understand.

304
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,280
I colluded with you

305
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,240
because you're the best constable in the world.

306
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,520
I've investigated the case.

307
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,920
But I didn't expect

308
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,040
you're such a person.

309
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,240
Ignore him.

310
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,280
Report it in time.

311
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,040
My lord.

312
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,560
I found out that

313
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,840
the murderer of the painting case

314
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,160
and the lover of the Qin teacher Jia Changyi

315
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,200
ambushed them in the central office.

316
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,760
But Lu Jiu has

317
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,840
a craftsman named Sima Kong

318
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,920
to protect him.

319
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,880
So he's safe.

320
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,760
Check his background.

321
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:01,280
Yes.

322
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,440
I kept a secret.

323
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:10,080
I didn't reveal the matter of Lu Jiu

324
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,920
being a craftsman to Geng Zhao.

325
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,640
You're so smart.

326
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,360
You're not only under the order of Geng Zhao.

327
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,960
He's not only your eyes.

328
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,000
I'm sorry.

329
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,680
From now on,

330
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,600
don't do anything.

331
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,360
I'll take care of everything.

332
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,680
It seems

333
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,160
it's time to start the case.

334
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,720
You want to join the assassin alliance?

335
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,320
I'm a good painter.

336
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,840
I'm willing to paint Lu Jiu's portrait

337
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,760
and make a contribution.

338
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:24,680
Your Highness.

339
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,920
There's no progress in the painting.

340
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,560
We can't continue.

341
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:53,680
Slow down.

342
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,560
Don't you know the rules?

343
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,240
I never leave a living body.

344
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,600
You can punish anyone who goes with him.

345
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,600
It's been burning for a day and a night.

346
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,600
It's not good.

347
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,520
It's not a good idea to drag it out.

348
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,280
We need to find a way to get some medicine.

349
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,000
When did you go there?

350
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,160
There are police officers everywhere.

351
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,960
It's dangerous for you to go out.

352
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:29,760
Don't worry.

353
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,120
The police officers are fake.

354
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,520
Fake?

355
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,000
How do you know?

356
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,760
We guards walk around the street.

357
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,080
We believe the police officers.

358
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,440
I'm afraid someone will report to you.

359
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,760
You have time to suspect me.

360
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,720
You'd better think about the situation now.

361
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,040
For example,

362
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,040
why the police officers are fake?

363
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,280
You mean

364
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,680
someone deliberately led us away from Luoyang County?

365
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,200
Yes.

366
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,040
It reminds me of

367
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,280
when we were in prison.

368
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,200
We were so relaxed.

369
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,320
It's like

370
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,240
the person behind us was deliberately behind us.

371
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:07,200
The most urgent thing is to cure him.

372
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,040
Thank you for the medicine you gave Lu Jiu.

373
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,400
I'll pay you back.

374
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,600
What are you going to pay me back?

375
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,200
Lu Jiu is so stupid.

376
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,360
You're so stupid.

377
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,120
You actually paid all your debts

378
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,440
to Jiang Cheng.

379
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,360
Lu Jiu.

380
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,720
Lu Jiu.

381
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,320
No.

382
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,680
Lu Jiu, you're awake.

383
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,440
Ling Lang.

384
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Where's Jiang Cheng?

385
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,400
He was released by a fool.

386
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,800
He even paid all his debts

387
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,000
to others.

388
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:12,400
Jiang Cheng is a poor man.

389
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,960
You did the right thing.

390
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,240
Lu Jiu, are you okay?

391
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,640
This is the result of

392
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:19,920
not listening to me and playing the hero.

393
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,360
Even if you're poisoned, you have to come back to save him.

394
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,280
You're so stupid.

395
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,520
Lu Jiu, you're poisoned.

396
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,840
Why didn't you tell me before?

397
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,240
I'll see if I can help you detoxify.

398
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,280
I can't die.

399
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,040
Why are you laughing?

400
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,360
You two are both fools.

401
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,160
I haven't finished your debt yet.

402
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,400
What debt?

403
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:48,720
On the way here,

404
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,200
someone had been sending him messages.

405
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,520
Last time when he buried my father,

406
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,880
I'm afraid he went to the street.

407
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,240
This time, he knew that your Tong Ji Ling was fake,

408
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,440
but he didn't tell us.

409
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,120
Let's prove it.

410
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,120
I just found out that Tong Ji Ling was fake.

411
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,320
Moreover,

412
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,920
he also pretended to be a bad dancer.

413
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:07,880
That's right, Lu Jiu.

414
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,240
I'm not lying to you.

415
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,600
I don't remember what happened just now.

416
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,280
It seems that Mr. Lu Jiu

417
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,000
still doesn't take us as his own people.

418
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,840
He knows that the Lu family is a big family.

419
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,040
Maybe he's hiding

420
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,200
the secret message of the famous poet.

421
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,000
I want to ask you.

422
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,080
I've been asking

423
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,120
what my purpose is.

424
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,440
Horse 479, Xu Wen Yuan

425
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,600
How could Sima Kong

426
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,840
be caught by the assassin alliance's midst?

427
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,360
Assassin alliance?

428
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:18,600
Let's go.

429
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,240
You are Lu Jiu.

430
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,320
You run first.

431
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:42,840
What about you?

432
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:43,960
They came for Lu Jiu.

433
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,200
Take care of yourselves.

434
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,800
After all, you have to pay me back.

435
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,440
Yes.

436
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,600
Sir, where are you going?

437
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,520
You don't tell me.

438
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,840
I have to follow you.

439
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,320
He claimed that I was his enemy.

440
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,800
And he wanted me dine out.

441
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,160
He said

442
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:27,720
all the people here

443
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,480
were his prototype.

444
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,640
I have been 不反复路

445
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,640
for more than a year.

446
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,520
A real speed war

447
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,000
can only go on for years.

448
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:40,000
approximately three or four years.

449
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,080
Young masters

450
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:42,540
don't hesitate.

451
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:44,920
Only after

452
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,520
How can you save him now?

453
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,840
This is the second time

454
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,600
he saved me.

455
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,280
I can't leave him alone.

456
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,240
You hide here.

457
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,280
I'll go and lure them away.

458
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,000
No.

459
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,160
I can't let you risk it alone.

460
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,720
You're their target.

461
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,760
Even if they catch you,

462
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:00,560
you'll be fine.

463
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:01,760
Linglang.

464
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:03,960
Linglang.

465
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,360
If I don't come back,

466
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,800
you can't forget me.

467
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:16,760
Hang.

468
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,240
езд elis of Tang Group

469
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,400
As you'm received money,

470
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,400
Why are you here?

471
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,400
We're here to kill each other.

472
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,400
I'm here to kill Lu Jiu

473
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,400
because you're the one who's here.

474
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,400
I'll let you live.

475
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,400
Let's see how long you can hold on.

476
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,400
I'll deal with you later.

477
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,400
Lu Jiu

478
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,400
You brat,

479
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,400
how dare you play tricks on me?

480
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,400
Lu Jiu

481
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,400
One by one,

482
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,400
it's even.

483
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,400
Are you okay?

484
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,400
I'm fine.

485
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,400
You think it's even?

486
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,400
That's because you didn't see my true strength.

487
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,400
Mu Fu Formation

488
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,400
What's this?

489
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,400
This is the formation Lu Ban created.

490
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,400
It's very strange.

491
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,400
This Lin Bu Ci

492
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,400
actually used this amazing formation

493
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,400
to kill people.

494
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,400
Even you can't break it.

495
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,400
I didn't expect you to look down on me.

496
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,400
If so,

497
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,400
at the worst, I'll die with him.

498
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,400
This kind of fun.

499
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,400
What?

500
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,400
I can't live without Lu Jiu.

501
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,400
Didn't I tell you not to come?

502
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,400
I won't

503
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,400
let you be with him alone.

504
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,400
Don't think you can escape from my revenge.

505
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,400
I was going to

506
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,400
let you three

507
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,400
save your friends on the road to the netherworld.

508
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,400
But

509
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,400
the buyer

510
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,400
insisted on keeping you alive.

511
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,400
They

512
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,400
are different.

513
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,400
No!

514
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,400
Who are you?

515
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,400
Diancha Si, Geng Zhao.

516
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,400
So you are Lord Geng of the Divine Treasures.

517
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,400
But as far as I know,

518
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,400
Lu Jiu

519
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,400
is a fugitive who is on the run.

520
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,400
I'm arresting people for your government.

521
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,400
There's no reason to stop me, right?

522
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,400
In the past few years,

523
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,400
you killed dozens of people

524
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,400
for the Assassin's League.

525
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,400
I'm also working for the government.

526
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,400
I'm still

527
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,400
a killer

528
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,400
ranked top ten

529
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,400
in the Assassin's League.

530
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,400
You alone

531
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,400
want to stop me?

532
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,400
Who says

533
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,400
I came alone?

534
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,400
Oh, no!

535
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,400
Please,

536
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,400
spare me!

537
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,400
Please,

538
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,400
spare me!

539
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,400
Please,

540
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,400
spare me!

541
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,400
Why are you here?

542
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,400
I'm the princess.

543
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,400
I'm not on the run.

544
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,400
I'm here to see you.

545
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,400
Come with me.

546
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,400
Lu Jiu is over there.

547
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,400
Please, spare me!

548
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,400
We seemed to have been here just now.

549
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,400
It's Zhang Qian.

550
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,400
Ling Lang,

551
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,400
bring the medicine.

552
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,400
Bring the medicine here.

553
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,400
Bring it out if you have the medicine.

554
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,400
We were just running away.

555
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,400
Thanks to your medicine,

556
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,400
I'm much better now.

557
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,400
You have this?

558
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,400
Give it back to me.

559
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,400
It's such an important thing.

560
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,400
You're injured now.

561
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,400
I'll protect it for you.

562
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,400
Don't you think

563
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,400
my medicine

564
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,400
is used to harm people?

565
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,400
Don't say so much.

566
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,400
Let's run away.

567
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,400
Let's go.

568
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,400
Let's go.

569
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,400
Mr. Sima,

570
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,400
are you all right?

571
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,400
I'm fine.

572
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,400
Bring some water

573
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,400
to Mr. Sima.

574
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,400
I'll treat his wound.

575
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,400
No.

576
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,400
I know how to use the medicine.

577
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,400
Mr. Sima,

578
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,400
a doctor can't treat himself.

579
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,400
He can't be treated by the doctor.

580
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,400
He can't be treated by the doctor.

581
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,400
He can't be treated by the doctor.

582
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,400
He can't be treated by the doctor.

583
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,400
He can't be treated by the doctor.

584
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,400
I can't treat myself.

585
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,400
Let me check it for you.

586
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,400
Come on.

587
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,400
Wait.

588
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,400
Let me do it.

589
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,400
Be gentle.

590
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,400
He's injured.

591
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,400
Be gentle.

592
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,400
Be gentle.

593
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,400
Hold it.

594
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,400
Hold it.

595
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,400
All right.

596
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,400
It's done.

597
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,400
It's done well.

598
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,400
Although I've treated the external wound,

599
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,400
I still need to touch your bones

600
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,400
to see if there's any internal injury.

601
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,400
Bite this.

602
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,400
I've learned its power.

603
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,400
I, Sima Kong,

604
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,400
never know what pain is.

605
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,400
It's hurt.

606
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,400
It's hurt.

607
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,400
I'm sorry, Mr. Sima.

608
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,400
I usually check the dead body.

609
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,400
Mr. Sima,

610
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,400
hold on.

611
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,400
I'll help you to restore your body.

612
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,400
You're sick.

613
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,400
We need to treat you.

614
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,400
The assassin alliance sent someone to kill Lu Jiu.

615
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,400
Lu Jiu.

616
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:07,400
The red thread is entangled in my palm,

617
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:10,400
but my arms are empty.

618
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:16,400
Our thoughts are like a film, but hard to capture.

619
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:21,400
The moon is gentle, why does it look like moonlight?

620
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:26,400
I am self-satisfied, but I cannot help it.

621
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:30,400
You are in the deep of the night,

622
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:33,400
like a flower blooming,

623
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:38,400
with the heart written on the paper.

624
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:44,400
A dream is like a man's life,

625
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:50,400
but a dream is like a man's life.

626
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:56,400
I will never forget you for the rest of my life.

627
00:33:56,400 --> 00:34:01,400
The mountains and rivers are long gone, but the wind is still blowing.

628
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:07,400
I will never forget you for the rest of my life.

629
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:13,400
I will never forget you for the rest of my life.

630
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:16,400
If we can meet again,

631
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:19,400
how will it be?

632
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:25,400
I will write a poem to write your name on it.

633
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:30,400
Time.
