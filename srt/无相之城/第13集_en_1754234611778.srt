1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,400
yes, you are awake all day

2
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:40,180
in perfect auspicious laugh and SEO

3
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:44,480
we add some books and show our affection

4
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:46,000
pumpkin treekm

5
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,340
mud painted

6
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,800
spring in 지옷

7
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,720
in the rhythm

8
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,640
waiting for you

9
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,420
at the wall

10
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:03,720
But the这么生和谁那么远走

11
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:08,880
千百岛石坟家庆标面状

12
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,340
一粟细雨 追逐辗轮光

13
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:18,180
鸣云朗朗 抽活青青花

14
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:22,820
悄悄照亮 心的小现场

15
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:27,820
The words are all memories

16
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:32,820
The night wind and you fill my dream

17
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:36,820
Don't hate the old days

18
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:42,820
Two years, like the four seasons

19
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:57,820
The Long Ballad

20
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:00,820
Episode 16

21
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:19,820
How can a person be so easy to break up with the past?

22
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:27,820
The Long Ballad

23
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:31,820
It's just a normal object, no new clues

24
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,820
I thought you were capable

25
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,820
But you're just like this

26
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:38,820
If so, please teach me

27
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,820
Take your clothes up

28
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:46,820
Shake it

29
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,820
Iron powder?

30
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,820
Yes, iron powder

31
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,820
For the sake of the dead

32
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:57,820
Before making the magic, we need to keep our hands clean

33
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:00,820
So it must not be on the Taoist temple

34
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,820
Si Ma Kong's clothes

35
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,820
Iron frame

36
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,820
Although your memory is not recovered yet

37
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:18,820
We still have the same understanding

38
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,820
But with your ability

39
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,820
Why do you find these clues now?

40
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,820
Because I was a servant in the government

41
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:27,820
I was the one who checked these things before

42
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,820
So

43
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,820
I'm not good enough

44
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,820
But it doesn't matter

45
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:37,820
From now on, I will always be by your side

46
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,820
Hurry

47
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,820
What are you looking at?

48
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,820
You're a bastard

49
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,820
You're not qualified to learn our Tian Luo's martial arts

50
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:08,820
I think someone is very jealous

51
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,820
And is happy to teach my father's unique martial arts

52
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,820
Miss, we...

53
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,820
Get lost

54
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,820
Don't worry

55
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,820
I'm here with you

56
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,820
No one dares to bully you

57
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,820
Senior sister

58
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,820
You remember me?

59
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:34,820
I just remember it for a while

60
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,820
But

61
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,820
Thank you for protecting me in the past

62
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,820
So you're Lu Jiu's senior sister

63
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,820
No wonder you have extraordinary ability

64
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,820
Of course

65
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,820
We grew up together

66
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,820
We can't compare with others

67
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,820
Okay

68
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:56,820
It's not the time to talk about this

69
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,820
Since Sima Kong and those missing men are related to iron frame

70
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,820
Let's continue to investigate

71
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,820
There is only one iron frame in the house

72
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,820
It's easy to be found in the day

73
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,820
Why don't we wait for the night to remember it?

74
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:18,820
Go

75
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,820
Finally

76
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,820
The material is the border between the mountain and the outside world

77
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,820
No one is in charge

78
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,820
I heard that even if a big case happens here

79
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,820
It won't spread to the court

80
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,820
Now it seems that the atmosphere here is really strange

81
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,820
It seems that you have done your homework

82
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,820
Of course

83
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,820
Many years ago, it will be led by the Feng Lei Hall

84
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,820
A peace

85
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,820
But since the owner Luo Feng's wife died

86
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,820
Feng Lei Hall collapsed

87
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,820
No one in the world is in charge

88
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,820
The fire is burning

89
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,820
The emperor is going to put pressure on

90
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,820
The enemy is afraid of the Feng Lei Hall for the sake of the war

91
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,820
Never thought

92
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,820
The war broke out

93
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,820
Blood flows into the river overnight

94
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,820
They avoid the pressure of the government

95
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,820
Gather together in this mountain

96
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,820
The mountain is the border of the four provinces

97
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,820
It's connected to the holy land

98
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,820
Then the song came out

99
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,820
Do you know why we came to the war?

100
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,820
Of course

101
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,820
Follow Lu Jiu to investigate the secret of the infinite treasure

102
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,820
The road ahead is dangerous

103
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,820
If you don't want to be involved

104
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,820
I am willing

105
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,820
No matter how dangerous the road ahead is

106
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,820
As long as I am with you, I will not say a word

107
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,820
Ok, then I will protect you

108
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,820
Go

109
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,820
What does he mean by this sentence?

110
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,820
Go

111
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,820
Go

112
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,820
It's done

113
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,820
Eat while it's hot

114
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,820
Linglong

115
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,820
You eat first

116
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,820
You

117
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,820
You are a man of your word

118
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,820
Why should you give it to someone irrelevant?

119
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,820
How could he be irrelevant?

120
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,820
Then who is he?

121
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,820
I

122
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,820
I am just an ordinary friend with him

123
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:38,820
He has a knot in his heart

124
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,820
I hope you can untie it soon

125
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,820
You are a little self-aware

126
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,820
You

127
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,820
The sachet is so ugly

128
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,820
The sachet is so ugly

129
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,820
Ai Ju

130
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,820
You don't know he is born with a sharp sense of smell

131
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,820
He hates this kind of smell

132
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,820
I have known him for a long time

133
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:20,820
I don't know him better than you

134
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,820
Give it to me

135
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,820
People change over the years

136
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,820
Ai Ju is out of the city

137
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,820
And it's not suitable for the material world

138
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,820
Linglong, don't listen to him

139
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,820
It's dark

140
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,820
It's time to go to the cave to look for the silk

141
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,820
You

142
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,820
Why did you make him angry?

143
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,820
He almost took you away from me

144
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,820
I don't like him

145
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,820
Fei Ying, you belong to me

146
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,820
If you want to stay here

147
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,820
Don't tell anyone

148
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,820
I am Fei Ying's

149
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,820
Ai Ju

150
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:05,900
Once we start the search,

151
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,820
you'll never forget

152
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:10,580
your home and family.

153
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:11,500
We've gone far into the folder.

154
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:12,820
When we left,

155
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:14,780
I sent credible covers

156
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:15,900
to signal people

157
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,860
saying there must be an Tyler rice farm where

158
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:20,460
ė화를 old man was sleeping gone long ago.

159
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:21,460
Thatит 닥 먹欲於

160
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:22,900
Taidia,

161
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:25,020
you wish me

162
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:25,980
to stay born

163
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:26,820
to be living once again.

164
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:29,020
young man,

165
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:30,700
brother Yuan,

166
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:34,260
it's my fate

167
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,420
I'll go check on the situation.

168
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:36,100
No.

169
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:37,500
You don't know martial arts.

170
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:38,220
I'll go instead.

171
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,500
You're good at martial arts.

172
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:41,100
I'm still strong.

173
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,820
I'll go in and ask Tuoxi.

174
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,980
You two really think I'm a pushover?

175
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:54,740
It's so late.

176
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,220
There's a cart that's transporting the ore.

177
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:58,980
There's something wrong.

178
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:02,540
You said

179
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:05,020
shooting arrows with your head is a must-have for a rich man,

180
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:05,860
isn't it?

181
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,100
Fei Ying, what's wrong?

182
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:35,980
I don't remember

183
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:37,420
what happened here.

184
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:42,740
The invitation?

185
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:46,820
Yeah, the invitation got lost.

186
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,020
Here.

187
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:53,340
Right,

188
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:56,780
someone hurt Fei Ying and

189
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:00,740
also caused him to be killed by evil spirits.

190
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,700
Yes, the Poison Man.

191
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,420
They want to turn Sima Kong into the Poison Man.

192
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:14,780
If the workers die

193
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:16,020
and the time comes,

194
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:18,860
we might not be able to save him.

195
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:19,900
If so,

196
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:21,340
Sima Kong must be in danger.

197
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,900
Why do we come back to waste time?

198
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:23,940
We must save him immediately.

199
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:24,660
Wait.

200
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:26,980
Once the Poison Man is involved,

201
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,380
the thing behind the scene will be different.

202
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:30,940
It's possible that it's Tian...

203
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:35,740
What did you say?

204
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:38,980
It's possible

205
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,140
that it's Tian Luo.

206
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:42,620
Tian Luo?

207
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:44,380
How do you know?

208
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:46,740
That's because...

209
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:47,420
Anyway,

210
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:49,020
once Tian Luo is involved,

211
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:52,220
the Investigation Department and the court will interfere.

212
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:54,300
We must take the long-term plan.

213
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:59,060
I don't want you to believe me.

214
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,220
But you must believe in yourself.

215
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:02,340
You said

216
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,300
no matter who I become,

217
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,140
I won't forget who I was.

218
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:22,460
What can't you say in front of Xu Linglang?

219
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:23,460
You know it.

220
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:24,340
What?

221
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,540
Are you afraid?

222
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,620
You exchanged the first killer of Tian Luo's honor

223
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:29,060
with blood.

224
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:30,700
But now you hide your true self

225
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,340
for this woman.

226
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,860
That's not me.

227
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,140
Don't lie to yourself.

228
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:38,180
These days,

229
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:40,540
you have more and more memories.

230
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:42,100
You know better than anyone

231
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,980
what the original Fei Ying was like.

232
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,020
That's all in the past.

233
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,300
I won't allow you to say a word to Linglang.

234
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:52,380
But it's all for this woman.

235
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:55,460
As long as she dies,

236
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:57,540
we can go back to the past.

237
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:58,620
I warn you.

238
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:01,140
If you dare to touch Linglang,

239
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:03,540
I won't let you go.

240
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:04,780
I don't care

241
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:06,500
what you had with me before.

242
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:21,340
Why do I feel that you two are weird today?

243
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:23,700
It's because of someone else.

244
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:24,900
Lu Jiu.

245
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,580
Don't be so fierce to Ye Mei.

246
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,580
Although she is a bit of a pervert,

247
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:30,860
I can see that

248
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,540
she really cares about you.

249
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:34,340
I know that.

250
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:37,060
Didn't you say you have a long memory?

251
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:38,540
Why are you here?

252
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:40,620
I remember you said

253
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:42,300
that you wanted to observe the way

254
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:43,620
the victims walked

255
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,380
before the case

256
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:46,900
and their life.

257
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,420
Did you find that

258
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,020
this place is different from other places?

259
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:51,660
Time is short.

260
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:53,300
Almost every place has a hard time.

261
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,220
Of course it's different.

262
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:56,260
You were also a member of the palace.

263
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,420
Didn't you find that

264
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,500
there is no government office here?

265
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,180
Yes.

266
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:02,740
A man disappeared the other day.

267
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:03,860
It's not that the government office is not here.

268
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,260
It's that there is no government office here.

269
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:10,420
The residence is between the court and the martial arts world.

270
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:11,540
No one is here.

271
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:12,940
The person in charge of the case

272
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,340
chose to work here.

273
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:15,740
Maybe that's why he likes it.

274
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:16,660
You knew it long ago.

275
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:17,940
Why didn't you say it earlier?

276
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:21,100
Someone didn't want me to say it.

277
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:22,220
Be serious.

278
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:23,620
Since there is no government office,

279
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:26,460
the people won't be killed.

280
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:27,780
The most dangerous place

281
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,100
is the safest place.

282
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:32,380
Maybe the murderer is hiding in it.

283
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,300
That's right.

284
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:36,100
The murderer may be right next to us.

285
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:43,500
When you were shopping,

286
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:44,020
you said that

287
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:46,340
the cloth of this kind of blood was very expensive, right?

288
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:48,500
You went shopping with him?

289
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:50,100
It's not the time to talk about this.

290
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,100
The cloth,

291
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:53,700
the pattern,

292
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,140
it seems that the people in the cultivation are wearing it.

293
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:57,980
But what kind of people in the cultivation

294
00:14:58,420 --> 00:14:59,700
would be so luxurious?

295
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,100
Where are you going?

296
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,580
Master's asthma is getting worse.

297
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:12,820
I need to get some medicine.

298
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:13,900
Hurry up.

299
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:14,700
Master is in the dining room.

300
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:15,820
No one can serve him.

301
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:16,500
I know.

302
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:17,220
Go.

303
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:17,900
Go.

304
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,700
The Taoist priest is quite generous.

305
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:24,020
I didn't even let anyone serve him.

306
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:26,220
I heard that the Taoist priest had asthma.

307
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:27,220
Most of the diseases

308
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:29,820
are caused by food and excessive oil.

309
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,380
A person who cultivates Taoism

310
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,060
has such a rich disease.

311
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:34,820
It seems that Taoist priest has some clues.

312
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:39,140
Master, what's the ticket?

313
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,500
The people from the inspection department

314
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:43,500
are leaving so quickly.

315
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:44,700
It's not because of us.

316
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,460
It should be for this case.

317
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,900
No matter what they do,

318
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,860
they can help us.

319
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:52,140
Son,

320
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,700
I buried your medical officer

321
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:56,060
to rest in peace.

322
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:57,420
I hope you won't be

323
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:59,340
taken away by the evil spirits.

324
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,180
Do you really believe that

325
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,300
it was done by the evil spirits?

326
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,700
Who are you?

327
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,900
How dare you to spread the evil spirits here?

328
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:07,140
The inspection department, Geng Zhao.

329
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:10,740
Lord Geng,

330
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,100
we are in a desolate place.

331
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:14,060
We have never dealt with the court.

332
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:16,220
I don't know why you came here

333
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,020
to do so.

334
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:18,980
It's nothing.

335
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:20,140
I heard that

336
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,460
many people were kidnapped in the town.

337
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:22,700
So I came to check.

338
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:24,140
Kidnapped?

339
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:25,860
The inspection department said kidnapped?

340
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,580
It must be kidnapped.

341
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,620
My son is still alive.

342
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:30,180
Yes.

343
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:31,820
My son is still alive.

344
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:32,660
It's great.

345
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,380
A girl said that

346
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:35,380
she was kidnapped

347
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:36,780
before she died.

348
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:39,300
Why don't we believe it?

349
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:42,060
The girl you said

350
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:43,660
is her?

351
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:44,460
Yes.

352
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:45,380
It's her.

353
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:48,180
Master.

354
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:49,260
Master.

355
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:50,380
Don't be rude.

356
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:51,580
You are in a panic.

357
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:52,500
How can you be so polite?

358
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:54,620
You should meet the inspection department.

359
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:57,340
The inspection department really did come.

360
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:58,580
Someone put a few clothes

361
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,100
at the door of the temple.

362
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:02,460
They said it was for the inspection department.

363
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:03,660
I saw that

364
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:04,780
it was left by the person

365
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,620
who was kidnapped by the evil spirits.

366
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:07,900
I thought I saw a ghost.

367
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:17,900
The assassin of the Alliance.

368
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:24,100
Ling Lang.

369
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:25,340
Are you really going to

370
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,860
talk to Geng Zhao about the case?

371
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:28,380
This is a matter of importance.

372
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:29,980
I'm afraid that with our power,

373
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,180
we can't

374
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:32,100
fight against the person in charge.

375
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,660
It's our best way

376
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:34,980
to cooperate with Geng Zhao.

377
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,340
But we fooled him

378
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,900
in the iron wall warehouse last time.

379
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:40,340
I'm afraid he doesn't trust you.

380
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:43,100
I'm afraid he doesn't trust you.

381
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:44,580
I'm afraid he doesn't trust you.

382
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:45,980
I'm afraid he doesn't trust you.

383
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,260
I don't think so.

384
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:49,660
After all, Miss Xu is the one

385
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,220
whom Geng Zhao values

386
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:53,140
and who is your eyesore.

387
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,340
Lu Jiu, listen to me.

388
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,460
You don't have to say it anymore.

389
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:56,900
If you want to

390
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,700
do me a favor

391
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,340
and have countless chances along the way,

392
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:02,660
I trust you.

393
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,100
Lu Jiu.

394
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:11,820
Are you done?

395
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:13,260
If you don't leave now,

396
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:14,580
Geng Zhao will leave again.

397
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:16,220
Lu Jiu,

398
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:18,020
your life is not yet settled.

399
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:19,260
Leave Geng Zhao

400
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:20,540
to us.

401
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,620
Ye Mei is a good martial artist.

402
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,340
We will come back safely.

403
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,140
Yes.

404
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,340
I will protect her.

405
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:36,100
Leave the sword before you leave.

406
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:37,060
Otherwise,

407
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,060
Geng Zhao will think that

408
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,380
you are not sincere in negotiation.

409
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:43,660
You're right.

410
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:45,220
This sword

411
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:46,860
is our engagement token.

412
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:47,980
I'll leave it to you to keep it.

413
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:49,060
It's more suitable than that.

414
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:49,900
Engagement?

415
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:50,700
Yes.

416
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,260
My Tiger Head Sword

417
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:53,340
and your Hu Zhaodao

418
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,460
are a pair.

419
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:55,980
My father gave it to us

420
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:57,180
when we were engaged.

421
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,500
Fei Ying,

422
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,340
from today on,

423
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:13,140
I'll leave my daughter to you.

424
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:14,580
From now on,

425
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:18,220
Tian Luo will be your world.

426
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:26,020
Ling Lang, I...

427
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:29,620
It's late.

428
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:31,060
We really have to go.

429
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:33,020
Ling Lang,

430
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,340
let me explain.

431
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:36,500
I have nothing to do with you.

432
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:37,740
No need to explain.

433
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:39,340
I only want to save Sima Kong

434
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,980
and the rest of the people.

435
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:42,260
I have nothing to do with them.

436
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:45,100
Ling Lang, I...

437
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,020
Why do you always

438
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:52,740
tell her these

439
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:53,940
useless things at the critical moment?

440
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,620
You only said that I should keep it for you.

441
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:57,020
You are Fei Ying's secret.

442
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:59,220
You didn't say that you wouldn't let me say these.

443
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:00,940
If you want to blame,

444
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,500
you can only blame her bad luck

445
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:04,340
for not knowing you earlier than me.

446
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:10,900
I don't need to see her. I can kill her.

447
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:12,500
I won't kill her.

448
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:14,500
It depends on your face.

449
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,140
Don't worry.

450
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,700
My horn and your sword

451
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:44,740
are a pair.

452
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,300
My father gave it to us

453
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:47,540
when we got engaged.

454
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:00,300
You were once a man in the government office.

455
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:01,140
You should know that

456
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,100
you can only win an enemy

457
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,940
if you are not careful.

458
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,860
You have never been my enemy.

459
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,980
With your skill,

460
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:08,940
I'm afraid you already know

461
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:10,820
the real identity of the missing person.

462
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:11,860
A scholar with a good reputation.

463
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:13,020
An assassin with a fierce face.

464
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:14,220
He is the second killer.

465
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:15,980
He came to us.

466
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:17,820
I didn't expect that he would be here.

467
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,740
I'm sure it's not an ordinary person

468
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,220
who can catch him and Sima Kong.

469
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:23,620
So I want to ask for your help.

470
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:24,580
Let's

471
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:26,300
punish the person behind it.

472
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:30,140
Father ambushed his accomplice.

473
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:32,340
Is this your cooperation attitude?

474
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:34,700
You can't have the heart of a superior.

475
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,420
You can't be free from the heart of a person.

476
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:38,740
Besides,

477
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,580
don't you have accomplices?

478
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,460
Why did you let him come?

479
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:49,820
This time

480
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,660
I want to ask you to cooperate with him.

481
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:54,100
After all, my friend was caught.

482
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:55,020
It's not good for you

483
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,700
to deceive me.

484
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:58,060
My eyes

485
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:59,820
never blind people.

486
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,500
So you agreed?

487
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:02,980
Before that,

488
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:04,620
let me admire one thing.

489
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:06,100
Why are you

490
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:08,580
acting like you're more perfect as a dragon than aarung?

491
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,060
What?

492
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,780
You've seen her again?

493
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:22,300
Lin Lang.

494
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:34,060
You...

495
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:36,500
Lin Lang,

496
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:37,620
what...

497
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:39,620
What's happened to you?

498
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:42,100
If it wasn't for him,

499
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:44,700
Miss Xu wouldn't have known

500
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:45,940
that you are Fei Ying.

501
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:51,260
Linglang, listen to me.

502
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:54,140
Si Ma Kong also hid this from me.

503
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,620
We did it for...

504
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:57,900
You, Geng Zhao, Si Ma Kong,

505
00:22:58,060 --> 00:22:59,380
and even him, they all know it.

506
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,540
Only I don't know it.

507
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,060
Listen to me.

508
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,380
Si Ma Kong and I

509
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:04,900
hid this to

510
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,100
avoid getting out of this

511
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:06,900
and it's not good for you.

512
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:08,180
But my father died in the Celestial Dragon.

513
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:08,820
How can you let me

514
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:10,180
be with the murderer?

515
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:10,700
No.

516
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:11,940
No wonder you are so afraid

517
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,740
that he would know your real identity.

518
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:15,660
If I knew it,

519
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:18,140
I should have let my father's men

520
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,460
kill him together.

521
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:20,420
Shut up!

522
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:23,060
Linglang, listen to me.

523
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:23,660
I...

524
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,020
From now on,

525
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:28,020
I will never let you and Linglang be together.

526
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:32,020
Linglang!

527
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:33,260
Linglang, Linglang.

528
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:35,180
Is that all you care about?

529
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:38,460
Do you think I'm worthless?

530
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,820
I'm the daughter of the Celestial Dragon's leader, Dugu.

531
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,300
I'm a noble woman.

532
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,220
I've suffered for you

533
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:47,460
for so many times.

534
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:48,900
I know it's unfair to you.

535
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:50,420
But I can't

536
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:51,580
pretend to be someone else.

537
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:52,500
Fei Ying,

538
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:54,300
don't you think

539
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,540
after he knows your real identity,

540
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,300
he will still come back to you?

541
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:07,820
Come back to the Celestial Dragon with me.

542
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:10,180
Night and night,

543
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:11,540
Fei Ying

544
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:13,820
are all dark.

545
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:17,060
We know each other best.

546
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:18,980
No one can separate us.

547
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:22,300
But if you stay in the dark for too long,

548
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:25,500
you will long for light.

549
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,620
Linglang is my light.

550
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,420
From the first time I saw him,

551
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:33,660
he is...

552
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:36,380
The cold wind blows.

553
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:39,380
Even if he treats you as his enemy,

554
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:43,140
you have to be angry with me and ignore me

555
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,820
and be with him.

556
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:48,180
The red thread is full of hands.

557
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:51,060
My arms are empty.

558
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:55,780
The blue sky in your eyes is hard to see.

559
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:57,140
I'll ask you again.

560
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:00,220
Will you come back with me?

561
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:03,220
I know you've helped me a lot before.

562
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:05,180
If you're willing,

563
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:08,180
take my body back.

564
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:11,500
It's my repayment to you.

565
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:14,860
Even if you die,

566
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:18,980
you won't be with me.

567
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:25,260
I want to be with you forever.

568
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:31,420
I want to be with you forever.

569
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:37,060
I want to be with you forever.

570
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:39,260
I will make you the way you used to be.

571
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:42,660
I will make you the way you used to be.

572
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:45,460
Time.

573
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,780
I'm worried about you.

574
00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:00,060
The clothes that Xu Linglang put on the altar

575
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:01,620
are clearly to lure you to the palace.

576
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:02,700
You can think of that.

577
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:04,220
Can't I think of that?

578
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:05,820
Then you have to see him.

579
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:08,780
Do you still want to take him as your disciple?

580
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,740
Can't you think of something serious?

581
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:13,780
I know.

582
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,580
The man in town disappeared for no reason.

583
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:18,460
Among them, there is Xu Linglang's friend.

584
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:19,740
He is from the coronation.

585
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,860
He can save us a lot of time.

586
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:22,900
Tell me.

587
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:25,460
What clues have you learned today?

588
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:26,460
According to him,

589
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:29,420
the treasure is hidden in the iron mine in the eastern suburb.

590
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,860
You believe everything he says?

591
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:33,420
Last time in the iron mine,

592
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:35,180
he said he would cooperate with us.

593
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:35,980
What happened?

594
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:38,420
The person in the coronation is the most important person in the case.

595
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:40,060
Is he just being afraid of his own safety

596
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:42,100
and just doing nothing?

597
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:42,580
I...

598
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:43,900
I thought you have improved a lot.

599
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:45,180
I didn't expect you to be

600
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:46,900
the big miss who doesn't know the world.

601
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:50,540
I don't understand the big reason you are talking about.

602
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:52,340
You don't understand what I'm thinking.

603
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:03,420
How is the preparation for the auction tomorrow?

604
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:05,180
Don't worry, master.

605
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:06,500
Everything is ready.

606
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:07,620
I promise all of you

607
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:09,860
will come with a sincere heart and come back with a pure heart.

608
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:12,700
Very good.

609
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,980
Make sure you arrange it well.

610
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:17,980
Don't make any mistakes.

611
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:19,300
Yes, master.

612
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:30,780
Got it.

613
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:38,500
Got it.

614
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:42,220
upbeat.

615
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:44,860
Support me.

616
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:48,260
Understand.

617
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:56,300
So then...

618
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:57,740
You have a thumb?

619
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:59,140
How're we supposed to communicate?

620
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:00,340
you have nothing to do with the future.

621
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,300
There are usually

622
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:05,660
passports in underground auction houses.

623
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:07,660
Didn't you see

624
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:19,720
the

625
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:20,900
first killer, Fei Ying,

626
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:22,700
who has always been chasing after the ancestors?

627
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:24,540
Lingla,

628
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:26,300
I've been hiding it from you.

629
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:27,380
It's my fault.

630
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:28,340
But now,

631
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:29,580
aren't you the same as me?

632
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:30,740
We have a common goal.

633
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:31,940
We'll save Si Ma Kong.

634
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:38,220
Put this on.

635
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:39,020
What is this?

636
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:40,380
I've checked.

637
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,340
There are a couple

638
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:43,260
who are selling their houses today.

639
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:44,580
I've brought their clothes

640
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:45,980
and passports.

641
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,100
Is it that simple?

642
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:49,860
Tie them up.

643
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:52,940
Tie them up temporarily.

644
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:58,260
I didn't forgive you just like that.

645
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:01,620
You said Si Ma Kong had a plan.

646
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,580
But I need someone like him on the way.

647
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:05,100
Now,

648
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:06,380
I just need you

649
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:07,660
to save people with me.

650
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:10,900
Let's go.

651
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:11,780
Put it on.

652
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:18,500
Here.

653
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:22,460
Okay, let's go.

654
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:23,420
Let's go.

655
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:27,420
Wait.

656
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:29,660
Blood, Xie, Tian, Xiong, Zi, Zhi, Ying.

657
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,540
Qian, Hu, Ba, Ji, Zhi, Nan, Xing.

658
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:38,460
Let me see.

659
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:43,540
This lady is so young.

660
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:45,460
She looks like a girl who hasn't left the house.

661
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:46,700
My wife always likes to

662
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:47,820
throw arrows into the lake.

663
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:49,140
She doesn't like

664
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:50,140
to shoot these dead things.

665
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,780
So I came to see

666
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,020
if there are any living things.

667
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:57,260
The guest must be satisfied with this trip.

668
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:58,060
Please.

669
00:29:58,180 --> 00:29:58,820
Thanks.

670
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:04,860
It seems that your ability to lie

671
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:06,060
is indeed very good.

672
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:07,420
That person is still watching.

673
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:22,540
Next time, go and see the shop over there.

674
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:23,820
This shop

675
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:24,980
is not well-equipped.

676
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:27,340
What if my wife falls down?

677
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:28,900
No one is following you now.

678
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:30,060
You don't have to act anymore.

679
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:34,420
Do you think I have acted in a play with you?

680
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,340
Do you think I will believe your words?

681
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:39,780
I know you have a grudge in your heart.

682
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:41,380
When the horse is out of control,

683
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:42,820
I will stay away from you

684
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:44,020
and not disturb your life.

685
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:44,980
That's right.

686
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:45,820
You should have

687
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:47,220
returned to your original life.

688
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:50,500
I didn't mean that.

689
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:53,180
Don't worry, my lady.

690
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:56,260
Slow down.

691
00:30:58,420 --> 00:30:59,300
Get off.

692
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:04,420
Why are you 나와?

693
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:06,020
Please don't disturb ourselves.

694
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:07,660
My lady.

695
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:13,220
Here.

696
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:14,340
Please have a seat, my lady.

697
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:17,100
Gosh.

698
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:19,460
The scent is so good.

699
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:24,540
It's so good that

700
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:25,940
it's the sole courtesan of the capital

701
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,160
who has made the grapeater

702
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,160
What's the meaning of this?

703
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,000
This...

704
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
What's this?

705
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,280
So many people.

706
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,280
How can we find them?

707
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,000
Look at me.

708
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,040
I'm so tired.

709
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,040
This is a tree.

710
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,400
Look at that crazy girl.

711
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,720
Why are you looking at her?

712
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:45,400
You can knock on the door.

713
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,400
No, I don't want her.

714
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:47,800
Look.

715
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:48,800
I'm not going to do it.

716
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:49,960
Which one do you want?

717
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,040
No.

718
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,520
It's too noisy.

719
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:53,920
It's not clear.

720
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
This one is okay.

721
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,240
It's clean.

722
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,320
Come here.

723
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,000
Where's the sachet I gave you?

724
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
How is it?

725
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
There are too many spices.

726
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,480
It's still not clear.

727
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
What should we do?

728
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,520
Let's go. Hurry up.

729
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:43,760
Let's go.

730
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:00,040
Symeden

731
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:17,080
The onyx掌扎

732
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:21,140
myla

733
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:25,780
Mycenae

734
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,260
feels empty

735
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:33,840
how we shoot for�

736
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,080
soft moon

737
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:42,280
why are URGENT

738
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:45,200
literally

739
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:48,120
deep in silence

740
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:51,120
Like the blooming of the cherry blossoms

741
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:56,120
The heart is written on the paper

742
00:33:56,120 --> 00:34:02,120
A lifetime of dreams, a lifetime of people

743
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:08,120
The dream is like a wall, no one can replace it

744
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:14,120
I will never forget you for the rest of my life

745
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:19,120
The mountains and rivers are long gone, and there is no wind in the evening

746
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:25,120
A lifetime of dreams, a lifetime of people

747
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:31,120
The dream is like a wall, no one can replace it

748
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:37,120
If we can meet again, how will it be?

749
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:43,120
Thank you for looking back at the past with a single glance

750
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:47,120
Time
