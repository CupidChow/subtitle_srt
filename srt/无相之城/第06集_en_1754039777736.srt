1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:28,920
Moonlight of Qing

2
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Episode 18

3
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,080
You two,

4
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,840
do you want to stay or sleep?

5
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,760
One room upstairs.

6
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,840
The cheapest room on the street.

7
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,600
Sir,

8
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,320
how noisy is the room next to it?

9
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,120
I'm a bed-sleeper.

10
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,680
I can't sleep.

11
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,720
You'll stay upstairs.

12
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,720
I'll stay upstairs.

13
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,680
Do you want me to say more?

14
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:29,840
No, no.

15
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,160
But

16
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,680
I'll stay upstairs.

17
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,040
You'll stay next to it.

18
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,640
It's not appropriate.

19
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,880
You're a weirdo.

20
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,240
I don't want to

21
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,000
give you back a sore thigh.

22
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,360
How do you know

23
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,240
I'll have sore thighs

24
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,400
if I sleep on a cheap bed?

25
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,600
I... I never told you before.

26
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,960
I didn't expect you to care about me so much.

27
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:52,920
It's okay.

28
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,160
You don't want me to take you back.

29
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:54,880
No.

30
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,200
Stop arguing.

31
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,200
There's only one room left

32
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,600
next to it.

33
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,400
It's okay.

34
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,120
We can just make do.

35
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,680
Sir,

36
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,880
it's important to take care of the case.

37
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,080
The room next to it is convenient for us to observe the situation nearby.

38
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,480
You can just make do.

39
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,560
I'm

40
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,160
Shaoqi.

41
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,240
I'm a good man.

42
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,200
We're not...

43
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,160
Thank you, sir.

44
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,720
Hmm?

45
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:32,920
Tell them

46
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,000
we're at the corner.

47
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,840
Why me again?

48
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,520
This is what a good man should do.

49
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:40,720
And

50
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,240
bring our luggage here.

51
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:44,720
I...

52
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,960
Hurry up.

53
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,080
Hurry up.

54
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,680
Don't come over.

55
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,680
What's going on?

56
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,360
Give me back my luggage.

57
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,600
Give it back to me.

58
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,800
You're dying.

59
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,240
She's a lunatic.

60
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,280
Sir,

61
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,920
why do you keep this kind of goods?

62
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,880
Kill her and avenge your wife.

63
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,160
Kill her.

64
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,040
Kill her.

65
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:12,840
Kill her.

66
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,560
Don't hurt her.

67
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,880
It's not wrong to kill people.

68
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,200
But we should let the government handle it.

69
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:18,840
In a few days,

70
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,680
it'll be the day when Zhang Qilin disappears once a month.

71
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,360
I suggest

72
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,400
we lock him up temporarily.

73
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,560
What if he runs away?

74
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,960
We'll be in big trouble.

75
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:25,800
Kill him.

76
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,560
We can't let him die.

77
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,360
Kill him.

78
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,400
Calm down, everyone.

79
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,640
If we keep going on our own,

80
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,200
what's the difference between us and the murderer?

81
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,080
You're a woman from a foreign village.

82
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:32,960
You're in charge of our village.

83
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:33,840
We want to avenge our lives.

84
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,560
Avenge our lives?

85
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,560
We don't want to see him.

86
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,480
Calm down, everyone.

87
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,800
Kill him.

88
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,560
Kill him.

89
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,560
Kill him.

90
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,480
Linglong, are you all right?

91
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,080
I'm fine.

92
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,200
Dr. Li,

93
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,120
wait for Gao Wanzhou.

94
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,240
Say something.

95
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,800
I can't see.

96
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,360
They can't hear.

97
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,680
What's the difference

98
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,160
between saying it and not saying it?

99
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,720
Dr. Li.

100
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:56,600
Ling'er.

101
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,200
Don't be impulsive.

102
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,280
They're monsters.

103
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,080
They're beasts.

104
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,200
You can't save them if you go to Ban'an.

105
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,360
And you hurt yourself.

106
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:02,960
Yes.

107
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,080
He's right.

108
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,720
But I can't watch

109
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,040
Erguo get killed.

110
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,480
Ling'er.

111
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,000
Beat him.

112
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,880
Beat him.

113
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,840
Beat him.

114
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,840
Beat him.

115
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:19,840
Beat him.

116
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,840
Beat him.

117
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:21,840
It's raining.

118
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,840
Beat him.

119
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,840
Beat him.

120
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,520
Beat him.

121
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,240
Drink the soup.

122
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,680
It'll warm you up.

123
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,640
Get up.

124
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,440
The case is about to end.

125
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,240
Manager Zhang's organs

126
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,440
are being removed once a month.

127
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,400
We'll have to get ready for that.

128
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,760
But Si Makong's wound...

129
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:14,080
It's just a lie.

130
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,760
You want to stay.

131
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,720
How did you know?

132
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,560
You won't hide it normally.

133
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,880
You can figure it out if there's anything on your mind.

134
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,040
And you want to stay

135
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,020
and investigate the case?

136
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,540
It's the most important thing for us

137
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,180
to find out where your brother is.

138
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:28,900
If we miss this opportunity,

139
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:30,220
we'll have to wait for more than a month

140
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,500
before we can get out of here.

141
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,180
Actually,

142
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:38,980
I went to Wuzhen

143
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:41,620
not just for my brother.

144
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,300
Why did you bring me here?

145
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,420
When I found the corpse,

146
00:06:58,580 --> 00:06:59,980
I came here with the villagers.

147
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,940
This is the corpse.

148
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:05,780
On the wall over there,

149
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,420
there are the scars left by the two dogs.

150
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:08,220
It's me.

151
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:11,460
I left

152
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:13,540
the scars.

153
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:16,260
Young Master,

154
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,220
everything is fine.

155
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,420
You've been through many hardships

156
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:20,940
to get here.

157
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,260
You just came to say hello to me?

158
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:22,940
No.

159
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:23,980
I found that

160
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,300
Geng Zhao of the Diancha Bureau

161
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:27,180
was guarding the dead outside the Zhangji Forest.

162
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:28,620
His purpose

163
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,060
should be the same as that of Lian Buci.

164
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,540
He just wants to get Lu Jiu back.

165
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:32,700
It's not enough.

166
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:34,620
I've found out

167
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:35,700
the information you asked me to find.

168
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:37,060
The protection

169
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,900
is Tian Luo's unique martial arts.

170
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:40,300
For the past ten years,

171
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:41,940
the leader of Tian Luo, Dugu,

172
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,500
has only passed it on to one person.

173
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,460
It's his adopted son, Fei Ying.

174
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,060
Fei Ying?

175
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:48,620
The first killer of Wu Xiang City

176
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:49,900
who disappeared years ago?

177
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,260
Before he disappeared,

178
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,380
Dugu sent him

179
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,540
to be the leader of the Dark Sect.

180
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:57,340
He was only 13 years old that year.

181
00:07:58,420 --> 00:07:59,460
Thirteen years ago,

182
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,020
I got a serious illness.

183
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:02,580
I don't remember anything when I wake up.

184
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,500
Don't look at me!

185
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,180
The protection

186
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,460
is indeed the same as your previous martial arts.

187
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:18,700
But looking at the traces,

188
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:21,460
it should be a weapon like a knife.

189
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,500
I've never seen a knife with a shape of a tiger's paw.

190
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:26,500
Ever since I entered this village,

191
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:28,260
I've had a feeling of familiar.

192
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:29,820
I remember you said

193
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:31,820
you had a serious illness when you were a child.

194
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:34,220
After that, all your memories are gone.

195
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:35,540
Could it be that...

196
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:37,500
I'm not sure.

197
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:38,860
But

198
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:40,660
everything

199
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:43,020
should be related to Wu Zhen.

200
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:44,780
How did you know?

201
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:46,980
Follow me.

202
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:49,340
Let's go.

203
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:54,420
Before,

204
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,620
I found a map of Wu Zhen

205
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:59,220
in my brother's study.

206
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:00,940
That's why I and Sima Kong

207
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:02,740
went together.

208
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,660
And in my memory,

209
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,300
this map

210
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,020
appeared here.

211
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,580
Fei Ying was young at that time.

212
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:16,460
He was strong and powerful.

213
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,100
He was a good model for the Demon Realm.

214
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,380
But I'm afraid

215
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:20,740
Tian Luo's purpose

216
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,140
is not just to get some silver money.

217
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,860
You mean

218
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:26,860
the burial goods in the tomb

219
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:28,580
are related to the Wuxiang Treasure?

220
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:31,460
Send my brother to report to the master.

221
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:32,300
Yes.

222
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:34,660
But...

223
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:35,620
But what?

224
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,460
If the master asks,

225
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:40,460
how did you know about the tiger's paw?

226
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:46,020
One of the assassins who assassinated Lu Jiu

227
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,660
had used the tiger's paw.

228
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:49,300
That makes sense.

229
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:52,540
But...

230
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,460
What's wrong?

231
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:56,940
Young Master,

232
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:58,980
have you been

233
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,500
suddenly nervous

234
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,660
and blushed recently?

235
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,220
It seems to be.

236
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:05,100
Why do you ask?

237
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,420
It's a beautiful place

238
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,460
with a beautiful scenery.

239
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:12,020
It's easy for a man and a woman to have a relationship.

240
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,260
I only care about them.

241
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:14,580
I've never been in love with a woman and a man.

242
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:17,460
No.

243
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,420
I mean

244
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:21,100
Lu Jiu.

245
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:24,140
Lu Jiu and Lin Lang are in love.

246
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,380
If they have a relationship

247
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,340
and get together,

248
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:28,940
it'll be more difficult

249
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,140
for the young master to get information.

250
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:30,900
I see.

251
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:31,740
You may go.

252
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,620
Why are you back so late?

253
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:49,580
How is it?

254
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:51,020
Everything is normal.

255
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:52,740
Why haven't you slept yet?

256
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:55,060
I found that the top of the medicine cabinet

257
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:56,140
has many unusual drugs.

258
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:57,060
They're all broken.

259
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:58,460
So I reorganized them

260
00:10:58,540 --> 00:10:59,300
and moved them to the lower level

261
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:00,340
so that it's convenient for Dr. Li to take them.

262
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:02,780
Miss Xu,

263
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:04,940
thank you so much.

264
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,900
I could see the medicine cabinet

265
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:09,140
in the past few years.

266
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,380
So I made it taller.

267
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,260
But I couldn't see it.

268
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:13,780
It's not convenient to move the cabinet.

269
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,020
So I put it down.

270
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:16,660
You could see it before.

271
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:18,380
Yes.

272
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:21,780
I was a childhood sweetheart.

273
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,820
I learned medicine from her.

274
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:26,860
But she suddenly left me.

275
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:29,300
I cried every day.

276
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:30,780
My eyes...

277
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,540
Speaking of which,

278
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:37,060
the cabinet

279
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,420
was built when we got married.

280
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:41,380
At that time,

281
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:44,500
she helped me to organize these drugs

282
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,660
like Miss Xu did every day.

283
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:51,140
It's been so many years.

284
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:53,500
Dr. Li,

285
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:54,980
thank you.

286
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:00,380
We've disturbed you for so long.

287
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,780
It's time to leave.

288
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,420
You're leaving?

289
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,340
I've checked it.

290
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,540
The steam will dissipate tomorrow morning.

291
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:11,940
We can leave now.

292
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,060
Since the death of my wife,

293
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,660
my stove

294
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:18,300
has been so busy for years.

295
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:20,860
I'm really reluctant

296
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,340
to leave you.

297
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,340
Dr. Li,

298
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:25,620
we'll come back to see you

299
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:26,900
after we're done.

300
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,220
That's good.

301
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,500
That's good.

302
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:33,060
You have to leave tomorrow.

303
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:35,260
Have a good rest today.

304
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,260
I'll leave now.

305
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:47,100
It will take another 10 days.

306
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,860
I didn't have time to find you.

307
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:55,620
Don't add more drama to it!

308
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:07,100
Lu Qiao,

309
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,780
have you slept?

310
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:10,900
No.

311
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:12,660
Do you know

312
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,300
what is the most important thing

313
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:15,620
that a person

314
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:17,260
and my aunt.

315
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:19,860
Although she's determined to make money,

316
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:22,300
her feelings for her husband and child

317
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,100
are not comparable to that of other people.

318
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,180
It's a pity that she's not a good person.

319
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,540
She's pretending to be a man and can't make money.

320
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:30,900
She even made her wife sell herself for money.

321
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,460
In the end,

322
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:35,540
human emotions are the most worthless things in this world.

323
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:37,060
Do you think everyone is like you?

324
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:38,740
They measure everything with money.

325
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:40,620
Let me tell you. You...

326
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,220
Why are you so close to me?

327
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,460
I'm just afraid that you...

328
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:45,900
Why are you afraid of me?

329
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,700
Didn't you lock the quilt?

330
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,820
Can you two stop arguing?

331
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,260
I thought you two could sleep together

332
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:53,300
and have a romantic relationship and live in peace.

333
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,420
Who wants to live in peace with her?

334
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,100
Who wants to have a romantic relationship with her?

335
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,420
And sleep together?

336
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,020
Give it to me.

337
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:15,500
Where's Li Lang?

338
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,660
I haven't seen him since this morning.

339
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,580
Yesterday, Dr. Li was in the medicine cabinet.

340
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:22,820
He had a few patients.

341
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,620
Maybe he went up the mountain to collect the medicine.

342
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,500
Then why did you go there early this morning?

343
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,740
I went to see Dr. Li.

344
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,420
I was worried that he might be sick.

345
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:36,420
I went to see him.

346
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:37,420
I went to see him.

347
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,420
I went to see him.

348
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:39,420
I went to see him.

349
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,420
I went to see him.

350
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:41,420
I went to see him.

351
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:42,420
I went to see him.

352
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:43,420
I went to see him.

353
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:44,860
What did you do there early this morning?

354
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,820
Dr. Li said he likes to drink medicinal wine.

355
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,260
I made him some.

356
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:49,940
He should be able to drink it in a few days.

357
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:53,260
I didn't expect you to do this.

358
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:54,420
You don't make money.

359
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:59,020
Lin Lang and I are both grateful and generous.

360
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:01,260
Unlike someone who eats and drinks every day

361
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:02,260
and does nothing.

362
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:03,260
Okay.

363
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:05,260
I'll go get you some water.

364
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:12,180
I can see Mr. Lu Jiu water it himself.

365
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:13,500
It's rare to see him eat and drink.

366
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,820
If you can also drink it,

367
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:18,420
you can do some easy work like making wine.

368
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:21,860
Let me tell you.

369
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:22,860
You are...

370
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:26,900
Lin Lang didn't go to collect the medicine.

371
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,500
In the village,

372
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:32,980
except you and Lin Lang,

373
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:34,420
only Li Mu can make medicinal wine.

374
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:36,460
But Lin Lang said

375
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:38,380
there's medicinal wine

376
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:40,020
when Er Gou hurt him.

377
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,180
I...

378
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:05,580
What is this place?

379
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,940
Why are there so many abandoned houses?

380
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:15,020
Which is the most bad way?

381
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,300
Shall we go?

382
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:26,420
Later that day,

383
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,540
I made you someга oil.

384
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:29,820
In six times,

385
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,780
would six describe the feeling

386
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:33,500
of some big decidedly?

387
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:36,940
Do you know

388
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:38,820
what Nine Silent Nuns say?

389
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,260
And what Taoism says.

390
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:41,300
What Taoism?

391
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,780
but the body lacks internal organs.

392
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,140
So that's the reason.

393
00:16:58,380 --> 00:16:59,020
Look.

394
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,780
This is your favorite flower.

395
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:02,860
It's just picked.

396
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:05,780
Do you like it?

397
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,340
Miss Xu.

398
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,620
Since you're here,

399
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:17,740
why are you leaving so soon?

400
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:21,540
Lu Jiu.

401
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,220
How is it?

402
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:24,660
I asked everyone in their village.

403
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:25,860
They didn't show up.

404
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,500
Let's go to the tomb.

405
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:40,820
What did you do to me?

406
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:42,700
Don't worry.

407
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:44,380
It's just some soft bone powder.

408
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:47,020
It's just so your hands and feet can't move.

409
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:50,380
You're the one who killed Ji Ergou.

410
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:51,820
You don't believe

411
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:54,060
the story of the revival of the magical flag in the magical book, do you?

412
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,780
I was right.

413
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:59,060
Just a few words

414
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:01,460
can tell the secret.

415
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:06,780
Medical doctor, medical doctor.

416
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:07,980
You're using the magical book.

417
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:09,620
That's false.

418
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:10,660
It's said that

419
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,540
blood is like water.

420
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:23,320
Water until it penetrates into your

421
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:28,580
レ

422
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:29,780
You're a chinese medicine doctor.

423
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,460
I tried to Tesla many times.

424
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,340
Though with every trial

425
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:34,380
there should be one thing left.

426
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:35,320
It's still시다

427
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:36,740
Teacher,

428
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:37,820
I fried some Tableware for you.

429
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:39,980
You killed them and took the organs out

430
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,980
just to save your wife.

431
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:43,980
You're really a doctor.

432
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:45,980
Do you think I want to?

433
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:51,980
We promised to protect the world

434
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:53,980
and cure the disease.

435
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:54,980
So at first,

436
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:57,980
we all tried to cure ourselves.

437
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:01,980
Oh, right.

438
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:04,980
Li Mu,

439
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:05,980
it's because we couldn't see

440
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:07,980
and it was inconvenient to move the body,

441
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:08,980
so we asked Erkou to help us.

442
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:10,980
He wouldn't have taken Li Mu

443
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:11,980
to such a far place, would he?

444
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:12,980
You mean...

445
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:18,980
Your eyes

446
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:20,980
are so blind.

447
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:22,980
Even so,

448
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,980
I still couldn't save him.

449
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:31,980
I was wondering

450
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:32,980
if only the organs of a woman

451
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,980
could bring him back to life.

452
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:38,980
I tried to find

453
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:40,980
the strongest heart,

454
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,980
the most delicate fingers,

455
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:43,980
and the brightest eyes.

456
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:45,980
One or two,

457
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:47,980
two or three.

458
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:49,980
But then,

459
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,980
the organs needed were getting more and more.

460
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:55,980
I had to find a helper.

461
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:57,980
I'll see if you can see.

462
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:58,980
I'll see if you can see.

463
00:19:58,980 --> 00:19:59,980
I'll beat you to death, you fool.

464
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:00,980
I'll beat you to death, you fool.

465
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:01,980
Okay, let's go.

466
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:02,980
Let's go.

467
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:03,980
Let's go.

468
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:16,980
Remember.

469
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:18,980
You're not wrong.

470
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,980
They are wrong.

471
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:21,980
They are wrong.

472
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:22,980
They are wrong.

473
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:24,980
They are wrong.

474
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:25,980
They are wrong.

475
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:26,980
They are wrong.

476
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:27,980
They are wrong.

477
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:28,980
They are wrong.

478
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:29,980
They are wrong.

479
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:30,980
They are wrong.

480
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:31,980
They are wrong.

481
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,980
The people wrong should all die.

482
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:34,980
All should die.

483
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:36,980
All should die.

484
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:37,980
All should die.

485
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:39,980
All should die.

486
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:52,980
Now it's your chance to take revenge.

487
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:02,860
Cute

488
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:10,080
душ

489
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,360
I want you to wait for me.

490
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,320
Why did you use Erkang?

491
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,160
He shouldn't have walked on this path.

492
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,520
I was helping him.

493
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,120
Without me,

494
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,480
he's still being bullied by those people.

495
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,760
They should all die anyway.

496
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,040
It's useless for me to help them.

497
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,000
It's not worth living for nothing.

498
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,400
I won't let you succeed.

499
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,040
Lu Jiu and Sima Kong will definitely come to save me.

500
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,360
Save you?

501
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,280
When they see you again,

502
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,920
I'm afraid they won't recognize you anymore.

503
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,560
What are you going to do to me?

504
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,000
I changed his internal organs for him.

505
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,080
But it's still useless.

506
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,520
Instead,

507
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:13,360
it's because his body is too burdened

508
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,280
that he can't continue to preserve it.

509
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,840
You're being too self-willed.

510
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,240
Don't worry.

511
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,760
When I was about to give up,

512
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,240
you came.

513
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,920
Your passion for it

514
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,240
and your strength to not admit defeat

515
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,000
are exactly the same as him.

516
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,800
So I thought

517
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,840
since I can't preserve his body,

518
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:44,600
it's good to preserve his face.

519
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,280
You're going to return my face to him?

520
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,240
Here.

521
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:06,840
What's this?

522
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,280
What lock is this?

523
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,680
Why is it so strange?

524
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,760
The most secret lock in the world is the Nine-Legend Ring.

525
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,000
If there's no key,

526
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,720
only the one inside the door can open it.

527
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,640
Don't you need a high-level memory?

528
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,680
Can you unlock it?

529
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:43,560
Yes.

530
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,120
But I need three days.

531
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,360
If you can open it like this,

532
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,960
why do you need the Nine-Legend Ring?

533
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,360
I have a better way.

534
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:01,200
Bridge of

535
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,000
siitä

536
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,360
What are you trying to give me?

537
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,920
YouOS!

538
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,400
I didn't.

539
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,920
Why didn't you go to the bedroom with me and do anything else?

540
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,360
We didn't make any trouble.

541
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,280
We didn't need to.

542
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,640
It will have been easy to kill out there.

543
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,640
Lyu Qu!

544
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,000
I- I am sorry!

545
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,320
Godfather!

546
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,440
weakness

547
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,240
Weakness

548
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,740
Oh no.

549
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,240
Lin Lang.

550
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,240
Long Jiu.

551
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,740
Long Jiu.

552
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,240
Long Jiu.

553
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,740
Long Jiu.

554
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,240
How are you?

555
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,240
Lin Lang.

556
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,240
I will definitely get you out.

557
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,240
If it wasn't because I...

558
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,740
Because I was locked up.

559
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:19,240
Open your mouth.

560
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,240
What do I do?

561
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,760
There's only one pill

562
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:27,760
that Sima Kong said.

563
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,760
You gave it to me.

564
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,760
What are you going to do?

565
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,760
As long as you're fine,

566
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,760
I'll do anything.

567
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,240
Luo Qiao!

568
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,760
Luo Qiao!

569
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,240
What are you going to do?

570
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,240
Luo Ming!

571
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,240
Don't scare me, Luo Qiao!

572
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,240
Wake up!

573
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,240
I have so much to say to you.

574
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,240
I won't let you die.

575
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,240
Luo Qiao!

576
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,240
Luo Qiao, you're awake.

577
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,240
Don't worry.

578
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,240
For you,

579
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,240
I'll live well.

580
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,240
Sima Kong is still outside.

581
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,240
We have to get out of here.

582
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,240
We've waited for days.

583
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,240
Why is there no news?

584
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,240
Sir, why don't we...

585
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:58,240
Sir, you've been standing by for the past two days.

586
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,240
You must be exhausted.

587
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,240
Since everyone is here,

588
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,240
I'll send you two to the road.

589
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,240
It's not that.

590
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,240
This blind man is not good at martial arts.

591
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,240
I have to deal with him with some effort.

592
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,240
It's only worth three to one.

593
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,240
You've been in a bad mood.

594
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,240
You didn't take the pill. I gave it to Lin Lang.

595
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,240
I gave him the pill.

596
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,240
Luo Qiao,

597
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,240
bring Lin Lang here.

598
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,240
Leave it to me.

599
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,240
Cut the crap!

600
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,240
Luo Qiao!

601
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,240
Luo Qiao!

602
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,240
Luo Qiao, take Lin Lang away!

603
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,240
Luo Qiao!

604
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,240
We can't leave Sima Kong alone.

605
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,240
I know.

606
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,240
Luo Qiao, don't do anything stupid.

607
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,240
It's not stupid to let someone you care about

608
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,240
be in danger.

609
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,240
You said you'd protect yourself for me.

610
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,240
Luo Qiao!

611
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,240
Let me make a bet.

612
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,240
If I win,

613
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,240
you'll treat me to a lifetime of sweet and bitter.

614
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,240
Luo Qiao.

615
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,240
If I lose,

616
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,240
I hope you can remember

617
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,240
that there was a person like me

618
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,240
in your life.

619
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,240
You want to die?

620
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,240
I'll give you a life.

621
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,240
Stop!

622
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,240
You want to hurt him?

623
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,240
Have you asked me?

624
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,240
Why are you back?

625
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,240
I'm still watching the master.

626
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,240
I hired you.

627
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,240
If he bullies you, then he bullies me.

628
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,240
You're the one who's a dog.

629
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,240
Even if there's one more person,

630
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,240
he's not my opponent.

631
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,240
Who said there's only one more?

632
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,240
I'm not your opponent.

633
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,240
There's only one more.

634
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,240
And me.

635
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,240
You came back on your own.

636
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,240
Isn't the Nine-Legend Ring

637
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,240
not open from the outside?

638
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,240
Have you forgotten?

639
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,240
I've been in power for a long time.

640
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,240
I can easily open the door that you can't open.

641
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,240
You two are stupid.

642
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,240
I'm here to support you.

643
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,240
I didn't ask you two to come back and kill him.

644
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,240
Don't say so much.

645
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,240
Let's just get the gift back.

646
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:16,240
You three are really unworthy of your own power.

647
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,240
One round twoして, one round.

648
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,240
Captured!

649
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:48,880
I know.

650
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:51,000
He wants to exchange me with the corpse.

651
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,280
It's because the corpse

652
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,360
can't hold on for long.

653
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,680
Then we'll delay the time.

654
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:55,640
In this way,

655
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,320
his sword skill can't be obtained.

656
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,200
I'm sorry.

657
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:10,920
I'm sorry.

658
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:11,640
I'm sorry.

659
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,200
I'm sorry.

660
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:12,880
I'm sorry.

661
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:13,520
I'm sorry.

662
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,200
I'm sorry.

663
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:14,840
I'm sorry.

664
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:15,680
I'm sorry.

665
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,440
I'm sorry.

666
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,080
I'm sorry.

667
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:17,880
I'm sorry.

668
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:18,640
I'm sorry.

669
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:21,600
Linglong.

670
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:22,640
Linglong.

671
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,400
Are you okay?

672
00:31:47,880 --> 00:32:00,880
So no time to utensil for your

673
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,920
feast is a well-gotten work.

674
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,800
It's a **** **

675
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,800
He has a good idea.

676
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,360
I'm gonna Speed-feed

677
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,000
it to him.

678
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,600
His sword Coastal Formation

679
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,320
can kill brimstone and sickle

680
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,680
by relatives.

681
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:52,480
I want to be with you forever.

682
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:58,480
I want to be with you forever.

683
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:04,480
I want to be with you forever.

684
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:09,880
I want to be with you forever.

685
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:15,680
I want to be with you forever.

686
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:21,280
I want to be with you forever.

687
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:24,280
If we can meet again,

688
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:27,480
how will it be?

689
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:37,280
Thank you for looking back at this moment.

690
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:53,280
I want to be with you forever.
