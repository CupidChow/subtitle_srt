1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
почти

2
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Episode 16

3
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,720
Feng Lietang never committed any crime.

4
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,080
Li Chu and Dugu Wu were the ones who colluded.

5
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,880
They pretended that Master Luo was the one who had the unparalleled treasure

6
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,440
and threatened the court.

7
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:10,800
In fact,

8
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,040
they were the ones who wanted to take the treasure.

9
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,640
Li Chu.

10
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,440
Li Chu.

11
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,560
Li Chu

12
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,920
hid the fact that he had married a girl

13
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,440
for the trust of Master Bo De

14
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,880
and proposed to me.

15
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,360
I was confused at that time.

16
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,120
When I realized his true face,

17
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,200
I was already pregnant with his child.

18
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:03,880
Look,

19
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,640
how cute the young master is.

20
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,080
But he took away your child

21
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,320
when you were born.

22
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,640
As a son,

23
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,600
you should leave the child to Master Luo.

24
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,520
What are you doing?

25
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,000
What are you doing?

26
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,120
Give me the child.

27
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,320
Give me the child.

28
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,160
Give me the child.

29
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,360
Give me the child.

30
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,400
Madam.

31
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:25,880
What are you doing?

32
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,800
Give me the child.

33
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,240
Give me the child.

34
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,160
Give me the child.

35
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,720
Give me the child.

36
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,880
You escaped from the Ou's Club

37
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,760
and searched for your news everywhere.

38
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,120
It's been

39
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,120
twenty years.

40
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,440
So,

41
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,920
you didn't want to abandon me.

42
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,120
How could you have a mother

43
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,480
to abandon her own child again?

44
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,020
Madam,

45
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,520
don't get me wrong.

46
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,720
We can't totally believe

47
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,120
you just because you said so.

48
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,520
Jieryan, you said

49
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,000
you were looking for Lu Jiu's grandson

50
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,040
for years

51
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,000
Then why did you check

52
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,360
his birth record

53
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,920
when hearing about Lu Jiu's identity?

54
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:17,880
His birth record on that

55
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,040
was no longer found

56
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,520
in Xintong.

57
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,800
to verify his pregnancy?

58
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,120
A few months ago,

59
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,320
I found someone

60
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,240
selling his body and body.

61
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,640
When I was collecting the clues,

62
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,600
I found that

63
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,400
Luoyang County Lu family

64
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,840
had two bodies

65
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,480
used for the gold silk.

66
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:35,840
The person behind it

67
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,200
was Li Chu.

68
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,880
So,

69
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,280
Lu Jiu is not the real child of the Lu family.

70
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,560
Seven years ago,

71
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,840
Lu Jiu suddenly lost his memory

72
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,760
when he was flying.

73
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,560
How could he be found by the Lu family?

74
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,440
He was so confused.

75
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,880
It was Li Chu later,

76
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,400
and then the Lu family.

77
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,960
What happened?

78
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,840
Lu Kun, the master of the Lu family,

79
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,360
is the picture

80
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,280
that Li Chu used to hide his identity.

81
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:24,320
Lu Kun's identity

82
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,280
Li Chu was under the shelter of Tian Luo.

83
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,400
He used Lu Kun's identity to cover his face.

84
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,480
He actually secretly searched

85
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,080
and locked up the old cloth of Feng Lei Hall

86
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,880
to find the whereabouts of the Infinite Treasure.

87
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,840
So,

88
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,720
Tian Luo and Li Chu

89
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,160
cultivated Lu Jiu together

90
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,440
to find the Infinite Treasure.

91
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,040
But why did they hide Lu Jiu

92
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,680
in Luyang County

93
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,160
without taking action?

94
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:53,920
The court.

95
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,640
Tian Luo killed Feng Lei Hall

96
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,920
in the name of the court.

97
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,640
But after that,

98
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,680
he didn't find the whereabouts of the Infinite Treasure.

99
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,360
So, His Majesty

100
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,040
had a guard against Tian Luo.

101
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,840
That's why he sent the inspection department

102
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,040
to investigate it again.

103
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:10,960
That's right.

104
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,960
The Infinite Treasure can be found in the world.

105
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,640
Seven years ago,

106
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,440
the living king was famous.

107
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,680
Fei Ying got the key clue of the Infinite Treasure.

108
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,000
All the forces

109
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,360
were watching him at once.

110
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,880
But when he returned to Tian Luo

111
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,840
and went through the fog, he disappeared.

112
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,160
So they didn't want to find the clue

113
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,040
on Lu Jiu.

114
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,360
They were afraid that the court

115
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,120
would find out their evil intentions.

116
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,080
So they waited for seven years

117
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,160
until the world was peaceful

118
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,720
and the storm came again.

119
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,280
Everything was in their plan.

120
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,520
But there was an accident.

121
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:50,720
Moreover,

122
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,280
the person found something wrong with the Lu family

123
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,800
and secretly arrived at Lu Yao County.

124
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,880
But Lu Mingcheng ran away.

125
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,720
That's why he showed up.

126
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,120
Since Lu Jiu's memory seven years ago is so important,

127
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,400
why did someone poison him in the prison?

128
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:08,760
It's not poison.

129
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,040
It's a fake poison.

130
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,880
But Lu Mingcheng escaped

131
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,080
and escaped.

132
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,520
How did you know?

133
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,680
Do you think we're so naive?

134
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,640
He tried to lead you on the road

135
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,920
but he protected you secretly

136
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,520
to follow you

137
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,480
and find the person behind you.

138
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,880
So this is the way from Lu Yao County

139
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,120
to Lu Yao County.

140
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,800
The situation is too complicated now.

141
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,400
There were Tian Luo, Li Chu,

142
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,680
and even

143
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,800
the Tang family.

144
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,000
Don't look at me like that.

145
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,760
our Tang family is after the Precious Unusual.

146
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,120
It's for the painting of weapons

147
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,120
and memorial snacks.

148
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,680
If I say

149
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,440
they love money,

150
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,200
but they value craftsmanship more,

151
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,280
do you believe it?

152
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:56,720
Yes.

153
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,720
When I was in trouble,

154
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,120
he took the medicine that disturbed his mind

155
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,080
and took all the medicine.

156
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,200
Did I say anything else?

157
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,240
Everyone has a reason.

158
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,160
Only I

159
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,600
are a tool that no one cares about.

160
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,880
Your friend is well-rested.

161
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,080
You can live here without worry.

162
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,680
If you need anything, just tell me.

163
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,040
Your friend is well-rested.

164
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,280
You can live here without worry.

165
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,200
If you need anything, just tell me.

166
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:05,840
Okay.

167
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,120
These ability to diamond

168
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,480
I,

169
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,080
I thought

170
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,760
I will be his opposite.

171
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:24,880
If he can't go to military comparidof

172
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,200
can he meet he?

173
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,080
I just hope

174
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,320
he can.

175
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,840
I said

176
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,880
You mean

177
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,960
this room

178
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,960
was prepared for me

179
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,800
in the morning?

180
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:48,920
You're an adult now.

181
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:49,840
You must not like

182
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,240
these little things.

183
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,920
You didn't have time to clean up today.

184
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:53,880
I'll get someone to move them away.

185
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,440
No.

186
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,640
I like these things.

187
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,840
It's okay to put them here.

188
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,080
As long as you like them.

189
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,680
I'm a junior.

190
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,640
You don't have to be so polite.

191
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,080
I'm not being polite.

192
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,840
I just didn't expect

193
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,360
that I could achieve my dream

194
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,080
in the 20 years of my life.

195
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,680
Jiu'er, I'm really happy

196
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,280
that you can come back

197
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,960
and stay by my side forever.

198
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,200
I'm tired.

199
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,800
I didn't think it through.

200
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,440
You should take a rest.

201
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,320
We haven't seen each other for 20 years.

202
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,440
There are things that are not urgent.

203
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,520
Not urgent.

204
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,400
I haven't slept on such a comfortable bed for a long time.

205
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,720
It's like my home in the capital.

206
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,000
That laundry lady...

207
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,760
No, Mrs. Xu Xiang.

208
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,320
She seems to be generous

209
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,680
to us because of Lu Jiu.

210
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,400
What's wrong?

211
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,040
Lu Jiu has found her birth mother.

212
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,320
Aren't you happy for her?

213
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,800
Of course I'm happy for her.

214
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,200
But she suddenly found out

215
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,000
that her biological father is a villain.

216
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,680
She even traded him as her enemy

217
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,840
and with Tian Luo.

218
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,600
She must be very sad.

219
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,560
That's true.

220
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,200
She suddenly found out that

221
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,240
none of her biological father

222
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,000
really loves her.

223
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,520
She must be very sad

224
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,480
for anyone else.

225
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,440
I'm sorry.

226
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,880
I all that's protruding back

227
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,800
is e obedient to Her Holiness Jiuyang

228
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,120
and given my rosy hair.

229
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,640
Don't think degrees Jarja

230
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,720
someone else like Lu Jiuyang

231
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:15,320
and not

232
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,840
Can't sleep in your heart?

233
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,600
I'm sorry.

234
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,320
It's more ugly to be sad over alcohol.

235
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,280
Drinking when you're in a bad mood

236
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,280
will only disappoint the taste of the alcohol.

237
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,320
I don't know this principle.

238
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,240
But now only alcohol

239
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,160
can make me forget those worries.

240
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,320
I still remember

241
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,320
when we were in the slave auction,

242
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,800
I lied to myself

243
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,560
that I was alone in the Xu family.

244
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:47,800
I didn't expect

245
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,600
I was right.

246
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,400
You can think positively.

247
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,320
You used to

248
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,000
blame your father's coldness

249
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,560
for your own mistakes.

250
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,600
Now

251
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:57,960
you know your father and brother

252
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,720
never treated you as their family.

253
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,640
Then you don't have to

254
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,920
be sad for them.

255
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,480
That's true.

256
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,440
But we've known each other for so many years.

257
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,160
I've been used.

258
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,960
I feel really bad.

259
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,920
I don't even know

260
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,800
who cares about me.

261
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,440
You...

262
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,520
Who cares about me?

263
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,680
I can't guarantee

264
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,760
what others think.

265
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,600
But

266
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,600
no matter what happens,

267
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,280
I'll be by your side.

268
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,600
In my life,

269
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,880
I'm lucky

270
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,880
to have met you.

271
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,240
What?

272
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,760
You think you've finished

273
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,160
the task of escorting

274
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,040
Young Master and Miss Xu?

275
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,800
So you retreated

276
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,040
and left in silence?

277
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,360
Their purpose of their trip

278
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,160
is to find the secret of the body.

279
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,800
Now they've found the answer.

280
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:28,960
I have no reason

281
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,000
to stay here.

282
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:31,640
Really?

283
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,800
When I saw you

284
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,120
fighting with others in the restaurant,

285
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,600
I noticed something was wrong with you.

286
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:43,800
I thought

287
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,800
you were a little too close to me.

288
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,680
When I caught you,

289
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,960
you were very skilled.

290
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,920
I even ordered someone

291
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:49,840
to use more medicine

292
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,040
to control your martial arts.

293
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,400
But now,

294
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,680
you're not fully skilled.

295
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,120
So what if I'm skilled?

296
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,080
So what if I'm not?

297
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,960
I feel more free now.

298
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:11,760
I heard that Young Master

299
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,680
was kidnapped by someone

300
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,040
who was poisoned by the poison of the five-sacred poison.

301
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,040
He almost died.

302
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,240
You were the one who found the antidote

303
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,280
at the last moment.

304
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:19,800
Your martial arts

305
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,280
were lost at that time.

306
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,160
Don't worry.

307
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,960
It's all my choice.

308
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,000
I didn't destroy my martial arts

309
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,040
for the sake of wine.

310
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:27,960
Miss Xing'er,

311
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:28,520
you don't have to ask for the credit

312
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,640
from me to Xu Xiangzhai.

313
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,440
You're asking for the person

314
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,800
who gave you the sachet, right?

315
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,080
Don't forget.

316
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,640
I know about you.

317
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,400
It's so late.

318
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,600
Is he still going out?

319
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:45,440
Let's go and have a look.

320
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,680
You were so ignorant when you were kidnapped.

321
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,040
But you really care about this sachet.

322
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:54,920
I know that

323
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,480
the person who gave you the sachet

324
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,000
is very important to you.

325
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,760
For me,

326
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,080
he's just a friend.

327
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,640
Friend?

328
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,320
Who can't tell who's a wanderer?

329
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,560
You're protecting him everywhere.

330
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,160
You even lost your martial arts

331
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,360
to save Young Master Lu Jiu.

332
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,200
It's just for the sake of Miss Boxu.

333
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,920
Don't be angry.

334
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:25,880
You're the only one in my heart.

335
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,360
Lin Lang is just a friend to me.

336
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,280
What... What are you doing?

337
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,480
You guys

338
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,080
are not telling the truth.

339
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,040
We're not.

340
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:48,960
You and I were in that place

341
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,160
where we couldn't see the sun.

342
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,320
We died together.

343
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,000
It was you who saved me

344
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,080
from danger again and again.

345
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,160
From then on,

346
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,360
you've been living in my heart.

347
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,080
Isn't it just acting that

348
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,280
needs to be so fierce?

349
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,040
They're still outside.

350
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:07,880
Xing'er.

351
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,880
Xing'er,

352
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,480
please forgive me this time.

353
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:15,640
You're the only one

354
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,200
in my heart.

355
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,040
Trust me.

356
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,280
The moon is so beautiful today.

357
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,360
We...

358
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,440
We're here to invite you to enjoy the moon.

359
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:32,840
Yes.

360
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,120
Xing'er

361
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,480
loves to enjoy the moon.

362
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,200
Your family name?

363
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,160
Your family name?

364
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,600
I haven't forgiven you yet.

365
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,000
Stop being so happy.

366
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,320
You're acting like an undercover.

367
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,160
Bro,

368
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,640
you're good.

369
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,800
You're a talented student.

370
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,080
When did you

371
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,960
fall in love with Xing'er?

372
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,200
Enough.

373
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,600
Don't fight with Si Ma Kong.

374
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,760
I'm happy for you

375
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,960
that you can find the one you love.

376
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,360
Thank you.

377
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:10,800
Well,

378
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:11,600
Linglang,

379
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:15,120
Xing'er was so shy just now.

380
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,000
Go and see her.

381
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,000
Explain to her

382
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,800
that we didn't eavesdrop on her.

383
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,280
You're so thoughtful.

384
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,160
I'll go now.

385
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,600
You're really

386
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:28,960
with Xing'er?

387
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,520
What?

388
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,480
Only you can find the one you love.

389
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,040
Can't I find my happiness?

390
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,080
Stop investigating.

391
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,040
I still remember

392
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:36,840
the last punch you gave me.

393
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,160
I can tell

394
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,520
you still love Linglang.

395
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,160
Yes.

396
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,040
I did love Linglang before.

397
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,080
But it was before.

398
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,120
I'm a businessman.

399
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,480
I never do business with a loss.

400
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,120
Now that I know

401
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,640
you're the one Linglang loves,

402
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,880
why should I bother?

403
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,560
It's natural to

404
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:51,680
find someone else.

405
00:18:58,920 --> 00:18:59,760
Bro,

406
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,520
no.

407
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,560
You invited us yesterday.

408
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,760
You invited us yesterday.

409
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,720
Today, you invited us again.

410
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,960
It's not the time to be brothers.

411
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:05,560
Do you know that?

412
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,320
No.

413
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,520
Mr. Xu is here.

414
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,680
Let me buy you tea.

415
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:09,680
Please.

416
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,440
Bro,

417
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,600
I'll pay for it.

418
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,440
I said I'll pay for it.

419
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,360
Why are you here again?

420
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:14,760
I'll pay for it.

421
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:15,880
Have you broken your arm

422
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,960
and haven't recovered it?

423
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:19,800
I lost it

424
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,960
more than ten years ago.

425
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,920
Last time, it was my last arm.

426
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,440
I've repaired it.

427
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,000
That's right.

428
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,240
You broke your last arm.

429
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,520
I should pay for it.

430
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,720
Enough.

431
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,440
I just found my son.

432
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,480
I'm happy.

433
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,440
I should pay for

434
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,000
today's tea.

435
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,040
Thank you, Mr. Xu.

436
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,040
Mr. Xu, take care.

437
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,240
Take care.

438
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:41,840
Okay.

439
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,800
They all know your real name.

440
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,560
You've always been secretive.

441
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,920
Haven't you seen Zhenrong?

442
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:50,480
I've never

443
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,840
hidden my identity.

444
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,800
They're trying to protect my safety.

445
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,560
That's why I hid it.

446
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,320
As for the name of the laundry woman,

447
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,480
it's because when Gu Shan just started,

448
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,240
many people from the underworld

449
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,280
are reckless

450
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,440
and don't know how to manage their lives.

451
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,960
I often help them wash clothes.

452
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,840
You're merciful.

453
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,640
That's why you're respected.

454
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,200
It's just...

455
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,920
Do you want to ask

456
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,160
why I took in

457
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,160
these evil and evil men

458
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,640
to protect you?

459
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,440
Please enlighten me.

460
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,920
They look scary.

461
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,560
But they're actually good people.

462
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,080
Good people?

463
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,560
I was the one

464
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,360
who blamed them.

465
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,480
But when we came to Gu Shan,

466
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,560
we saw someone selling children.

467
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:34,800
Look.

468
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,440
That's Six.

469
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,320
His son is always

470
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,840
sneaking around.

471
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,680
He doesn't want to live a peaceful life.

472
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:43,880
So he came to find me

473
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,440
and asked someone to act for him.

474
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,520
He wanted to show the child

475
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,040
the ridiculous end of life.

476
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,320
Now it seems

477
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,200
it's time to make a joke.

478
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,200
I see.

479
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,280
It's the best way

480
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,120
to use the carvings

481
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,360
to make a living.

482
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,480
So,

483
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,360
they're all

484
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,200
pitiful people who can only live in death.

485
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,280
Why is Gu Shan,

486
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,960
who's spread by the outside world, so scary?

487
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,600
It's because His Majesty

488
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,600
is so wise.

489
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:11,240
He made a pact with the Celestial Pagoda and the Diancha Bureau.

490
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,160
After the Fenglei Hall was destroyed,

491
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,480
the world was in chaos.

492
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,160
Only by making Gu Shan suffer from the evil,

493
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,760
can we temporarily

494
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,200
control the disputes in the world.

495
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,200
Right?

496
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,360
They're so pitiful.

497
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,840
They wanted to live a peaceful life here.

498
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,560
But the people outside

499
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,560
are spreading the evil

500
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,560
and ruining their reputation.

501
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,240
You've known the truth

502
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,720
and you don't want me to

503
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,440
support Gu Shan for so many years.

504
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,640
No.

505
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,720
We must find a way to change it.

506
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,120
Mother.

507
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,760
If you can trust me,

508
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,440
I'll help you

509
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:45,760
to change Gu Shan

510
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,400
into a human in the underworld

511
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,880
who's been waiting for the paradise.

512
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,720
Good.

513
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,560
Good boy.

514
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,280
I'll wait for this day.

515
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,280
Father.

516
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,520
A spy from Gu Shan sent a letter to report that

517
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,240
he's staying in Gu Shan.

518
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,280
He said he'd turn Gu Shan

519
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,160
into a paradise

520
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,680
that the people in the underworld are looking for.

521
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:17,720
Father.

522
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,880
If this goes on,

523
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,160
the secret of the Five-Illumined Treasure

524
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,440
will never be revealed.

525
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,760
You're in a hurry.

526
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,360
How can it be a big deal?

527
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,640
The more relaxed you are,

528
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:32,360
the easier it is to expose your weakness.

529
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,960
What are you busy with these days?

530
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,880
You're too busy to eat.

531
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,480
Drink the porridge first.

532
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:08,960
By the way,

533
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,200
look.

534
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,000
This is

535
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:14,040
the map I designed for the Gu Shan Academy.

536
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,360
Academy?

537
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,280
I see.

538
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,920
You want to help Gu Shan

539
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,960
to open the door and teach them a lesson.

540
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,560
Yes.

541
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,280
Gu Shan was captured

542
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,040
by Jianghu

543
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,640
because he was misunderstood

544
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,680
by the people in the underworld.

545
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,520
He only left his impression

546
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,760
and knew how to fight and kill.

547
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:30,680
He didn't know the culture.

548
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,840
He only knew how to read.

549
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:32,920
He could make them

550
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,360
understand the logic of the people

551
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,440
and express their thoughts.

552
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,280
Lu Jiu.

553
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,760
You're becoming

554
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,120
more and more like the Young Master.

555
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,120
What Young Master?

556
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,320
But

557
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,760
I haven't been with my mother for more than ten years.

558
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,560
I just want to share more for her.

559
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:54,920
Lin Lang.

560
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:56,740
I will not only

561
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,520
posture the who cry of Mount TV,

562
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,600
but also your future.

563
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,360
My future?

564
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,260
Besides

565
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,100
the

566
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:07,240
path plain and unset up in Mount TV,

567
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,480
you're totally asking me

568
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,560
whether I should keep an eye on it

569
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:11,640
or Очень web drama.

570
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:12,960
So soon?

571
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:14,760
I'm afraid

572
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,020
this human is

573
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:17,240
just one.

574
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,040
You

575
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,860
miss your dad.

576
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:21,640
No.

577
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:23,540
Not only will I miss my mom.

578
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:24,620
Have you found your father?

579
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:27,740
I...

580
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:29,580
I've been thinking about it.

581
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:31,340
My memories of Feiyin

582
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:32,580
are not always there.

583
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:35,140
As for my father and my brother,

584
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:37,500
I don't want to look for them.

585
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:40,140
Let's stay in Mount Gu

586
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:41,540
and enjoy our lives,

587
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:42,500
okay?

588
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:46,260
Okay.

589
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:53,420
What's that?

590
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:55,180
Nothing.

591
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,860
That's a tool for the Academy model.

592
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:01,620
Well, it's late now.

593
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,380
Let's go back and rest.

594
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:04,020
Let's go.

595
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:07,780
By the way, it's cold now.

596
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:09,180
You should be careful not to catch a cold.

597
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:11,860
Linglong.

598
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:14,940
Why does your body smell

599
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:17,140
more fragrant than before?

600
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:18,620
What do you mean?

601
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:20,820
You forgot that I said

602
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:22,780
your body smells different from others.

603
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:24,580
Maybe you were busy with your case

604
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:26,220
and the smell was covered by the wet and smelly.

605
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:27,780
But recently,

606
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:29,780
the smell is more obvious.

607
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:30,780
What smell?

608
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:33,180
It should be the smell of the incense stove.

609
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:37,020
The incense stove?

610
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:38,020
I'm going back now.

611
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:39,220
Have a good rest.

612
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:55,020
How could he know

613
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:57,420
that the smell of my body

614
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:58,700
was the smell of the five-sit test

615
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,580
and the mark of his case?

616
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:01,660
Even if my father

617
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,660
gave me the incense bowl and tried hard to suppress it,

618
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,180
it couldn't be removed.

619
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,300
But now,

620
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:10,380
I have no chance to take revenge.

621
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,700
This is your Mount Gu,

622
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:16,900
but not mine.

623
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:23,780
Great.

624
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:26,780
Great.

625
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,100
Great.

626
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:34,500
As the saying goes,

627
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,100
who would be willing to take the Mount Gu?

628
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,700
The Taoist has the Tao, but the Mount Gu is not.

629
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:40,060
The paper window is made of bamboo, and the body is warm.

630
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,780
The monk is sleeping, and the servant is in the group.

631
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:43,860
Today,

632
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:45,580
the Mount Gu Academy is officially opened.

633
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:47,220
It's called the Academy of the Unwavering.

634
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:48,540
May the world be unwavering

635
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:49,940
and may all beings help each other.

636
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:51,900
Great.

637
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,900
Great.

638
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:55,620
Lu Jiu used to say

639
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:57,180
that his life was meaningless.

640
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:58,620
He did everything

641
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:00,180
to get closer to his father.

642
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:01,460
Now,

643
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:03,260
he finally found his own life.

644
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:04,740
Lu Jiu has grown a lot.

645
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:06,900
I'm also impressed by him.

646
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:08,740
It's really admirable.

647
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:10,940
What did you say?

648
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:13,940
I said I was happy for him.

649
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,580
I can surely challenge him.

650
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:23,380
Waiting for the result of your last performance.

651
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,340
Get on my shoulders!

652
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:37,940
He almost lost his horse.

653
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:40,700
He can't get any money every day these days.

654
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:42,300
Here, too.

655
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:44,380
Don't cry.

656
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:45,820
I need these

657
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:46,740
horses and pasta.

658
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:47,540
Really?

659
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,020
Do you really remember

660
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:51,060
a good man who does good deeds.

661
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:53,060
I'm not a good man.

662
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:54,740
I'll try to

663
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:56,260
keep this Taiping Island

664
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:57,140
as a safe place.

665
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:00,580
Here you are.

666
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:02,700
Thank you, good man.

667
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,820
I've been working for Chang'an for my whole life.

668
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:10,460
I should protect the people of Gu City.

669
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,420
I'm lucky to die.

670
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:14,220
But

671
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,500
I don't know how he is now.

672
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:18,500
My Lord.

673
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:19,660
I'm sorry.

674
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:24,660
Could it be

675
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:27,140
I've been thinking too much lately?

676
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:29,940
My Lord.

677
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:32,100
My Lord.

678
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:35,540
My Lord.

679
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:40,740
My Lord.

680
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:42,740
I miss you so much.

681
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:44,940
I knew you wouldn't leave me alone.

682
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:50,660
Let go of me.

683
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:52,620
How can you be so rude

684
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:53,460
in public?

685
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:56,020
I haven't seen you for a long time.

686
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,260
I couldn't help it.

687
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,900
We're the superiors and subordinates.

688
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:02,140
No matter when and where,

689
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:03,820
you must remember your identity.

690
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:07,540
We've been through so many hardships together.

691
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:09,020
And I've made it clear

692
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:10,620
in the material world.

693
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,620
You still think I'm your subordinate.

694
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:14,220
Since the day you entered the Supervisory Department,

695
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:15,420
I've warned you.

696
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:17,140
If you're willing to do anything,

697
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:18,300
I'll let you go.

698
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,220
I'll drive you back to the capital

699
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:22,340
for the thought of love.

700
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:26,020
Don't bother, Lord Geng.

701
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:28,500
I've known my identity as a princess

702
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,740
since I was with you.

703
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:30,780
You hate me.

704
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:31,980
Don't worry.

705
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:33,940
From now on,

706
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:35,820
I'll never show up by your side again.

707
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:38,180
And I won't let my true heart be trampled on again.

708
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,060
You changed your mind.

709
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:54,700
There's not much left for you two to do.

710
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:56,620
To save the dead,

711
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,140
bring home the meat.

712
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:00,300
Bell peppers.

713
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:02,020
Come.

714
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:07,660
Let's have a snack and drink.

715
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:10,580
Lord Geng.

716
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:12,580
Mr. Xue.

717
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:14,100
It's all thanks to you

718
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,140
for the summoning Avoidance gamble.

719
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:15,860
Cheers.

720
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:17,660
No problem.

721
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:19,860
I'm sorry.

722
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:24,340
Where are you going?

723
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:26,300
I'm going back to the capital.

724
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:27,900
Did Mr. Geng ask you to go back?

725
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:29,620
Don't mention him to me.

726
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:32,580
I have nothing to do with him now.

727
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,460
Linglang, let me tell you.

728
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:36,740
Men will never see

729
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:38,180
the efforts we've made for them.

730
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:39,860
Women live for themselves.

731
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:41,660
Why do you say that?

732
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:44,220
If you want to act stupid,

733
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:46,300
then keep acting.

734
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:47,340
I'm leaving.

735
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:49,700
Let's go.

736
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:58,940
Enjoy yourself.

737
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,780
Let's go over there.

738
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:02,860
Come on.

739
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:09,820
Come on, let me give you a toast.

740
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:16,820
Linglang's mood is not good recently.

741
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:18,140
If you feel bad,

742
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:19,580
then go comfort him.

743
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:24,380
Forget it.

744
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:26,940
What he wants

745
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:28,860
is never my comfort.

746
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:32,380
You're usually cold and cold.

747
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,380
You only know how to be nice even after making a fuss.

748
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:36,620
You even brought me in.

749
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:39,020
You...

750
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:41,980
Forget it.

751
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,420
I can only help you here.

752
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:48,820
Let me see.

753
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:49,380
Come on.

754
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:50,300
Look at this.

755
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:52,060
This is good.

756
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:53,380
It's very nutritious.

757
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:55,420
Thank you.

758
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:56,300
You're welcome.

759
00:31:58,860 --> 00:31:59,380
Come on.

760
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:01,500
Come on.

761
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,020
Hurry up.

762
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:04,740
Try this.

763
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:08,140
Miss Xu,

764
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:09,860
why do you only look at the food?

765
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:12,220
Is it because the food doesn't suit your taste?

766
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:13,180
What do you want to eat?

767
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:14,860
Let the kitchen cook it for you.

768
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:15,860
Yes.

769
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:16,940
You two are...

770
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:18,660
We're the most famous matchmaker in Mount Gu.

771
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:19,980
Just call me Aunt San.

772
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:21,140
Call me...

773
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:22,780
Call me Aunt Liu.

774
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:25,580
Aunt San, Aunt Liu.

775
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:26,260
Yes.

776
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:27,460
You're really a name.

777
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,780
We're so good at looking at people.

778
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:31,340
The girls in the day

779
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:33,060
all hope that Young Master Lu will like them.

780
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:34,460
In our opinion,

781
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:38,060
Young Master Lu will definitely marry you.

782
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:39,860
Yes.

783
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:41,180
Marry me?

784
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,020
I haven't thought about it that far.

785
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:44,780
Not far.

786
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:46,780
Young Master Lu is twenty years old this year.

787
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:48,780
He'll get married in spring and have a baby at the end of the year.

788
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:50,780
When the child is older, he'll be a man of great power.

789
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:52,380
He can help his son to make a fortune.

790
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:53,260
Right?

791
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:54,580
I think

792
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:55,900
although his butt is a little smaller,

793
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:57,780
his body is strong.

794
00:32:57,780 --> 00:33:00,180
He must be a good son.

795
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,180
I promise that

796
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:02,100
in less than three years,

797
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:04,020
I'll definitely hold two children.

798
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:05,060
It won't be a problem.

799
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:09,780
I haven't thought about it that far.

800
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:11,860
I just want to teach Shuyan's books well.

801
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:15,060
Women mainly want to be with each other.

802
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:16,340
What books?

803
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:17,860
Besides,

804
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:18,860
we, Mount Gu,

805
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:20,380
haven't been out for twenty years.

806
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:22,380
Why do we need to learn martial arts?

807
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:23,620
The lessons in this school

808
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:24,660
are taught by Young Master Lu Jiu

809
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:25,660
because he's afraid that you'll be bored

810
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:26,980
and he'll make you lose your temper.

811
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:28,380
Yes.

812
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:30,340
But Lu Jiu didn't say that.

813
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:32,420
Even if Young Master Lu is the young master,

814
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:33,500
I have to say that

815
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,260
before getting married,

816
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:36,300
men should listen to what they say,

817
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,100
right?

818
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:38,700
Let me tell you.

819
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:39,540
After getting married,

820
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:41,860
he'll definitely want you to be his wife.

821
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:43,820
The things that he promised before

822
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:46,060
are just his own feelings.

823
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:47,500
It won't take long.

824
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:16,900
Your Majesty.

825
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:17,900
I'm here to see you.

826
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:18,900
I'm here to see you.

827
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:19,900
I'm here to see you.

828
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:20,900
I'm here to see you.

829
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:21,900
I'm here to see you.

830
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:22,900
I'm here to see you.

831
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:23,900
I'm here to see you.

832
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:24,900
I'm here to see you.

833
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:25,900
I'm here to see you.

834
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:26,900
I'm here to see you.

835
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:27,900
I'm here to see you.

836
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:28,900
I'm here to see you.

837
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:29,900
I'm here to see you.

838
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:30,900
I'm here to see you.

839
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:31,900
I'm here to see you.

840
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:32,900
I'm here to see you.

841
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:33,900
I'm here to see you.

842
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:34,900
I'm here to see you.

843
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:35,900
I'm here to see you.

844
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:36,900
I'm here to see you.

845
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:37,900
I'm here to see you.

846
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:38,900
I'm here to see you.

847
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:39,900
I'm here to see you.

848
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:40,900
I'm here to see you.

849
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:46,100
I'm willing to give up my life for you.

850
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:49,300
You are in the deep of the world.

851
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:52,300
Like the blooming of the flowers.

852
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:57,700
My heart is in your hands.

853
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:03,500
In my dream, I'm a man for a lifetime.

854
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:09,700
In my dream, I'm a man for a lifetime.

855
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:15,500
I'm willing to give up my life for you.

856
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:20,900
In my dream, I'm a man for a lifetime.

857
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:26,700
In my dream, I'm a man for a lifetime.

858
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:32,900
I'm willing to give up my life for you.

859
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:35,300
If we can meet again,

860
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:38,500
we can be together forever.

861
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:48,300
Thank you for looking back at the past with a smile.
