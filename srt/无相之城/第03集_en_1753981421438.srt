1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,240
O OB VIGIL十運

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,800
You wake up in the morning before dawn

3
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,800
The smile we made together is like an autumn dream

4
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:44,400
My excitement is like a wind

5
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:49,000
You are green, a bright red

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,800
Don't say it's shy, listen to the sound of the zither

7
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:58,600
I'm in the rain, I'm crying and listening to the song

8
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:03,400
But who is behind me?

9
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:08,400
A thousand years, ten years, a thousand years

10
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,200
I chase the light with you

11
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,000
The bright moon, the waves, the flowers, the stars

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,800
Light up the small window of the heart

13
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:27,600
The words are all memories

14
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,200
Don't hate you for your big dream

15
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:37,000
Don't hate the old days

16
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,400
The yearning is like a flash of light

17
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,600
Episode 16

18
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,400
You're not eating again?

19
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,800
Lin Lang, I watched him grow up.

20
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,200
You are his friend.

21
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,800
Even if I believe you killed him, it's still a helplessness.

22
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,200
But you have to eat.

23
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:32,200
Or else, before the people from the Ministry of Justice arrive, you will be gone.

24
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,600
From now on, you are my best friend.

25
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:55,200
Sorry, I'm a coroner. I only believe in evidence.

26
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,800
Now even the only friend doesn't trust me anymore.

27
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,000
Lu Jiu.

28
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,800
Lu Jiu, I can do whatever you want.

29
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,000
I'm just doing my duty. I have no choice.

30
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Your duty is to be a good wife and to find out the truth.

31
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,800
Why do you believe in the false image?

32
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,600
I don't want to believe it either, but this...

33
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,200
Leave!

34
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,600
Lu Jiu!

35
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,200
You scared me!

36
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,600
I found something wrong with Lu Jiu's case.

37
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:02,000
I've been a coroner for so many years. I don't need you to teach me how to investigate.

38
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,200
I found someone trying to poison Lu Jiu's food.

39
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,600
Lu Jiu's case has been closed.

40
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,600
The person who can do that must be the real killer.

41
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,800
I think he's afraid of changes in the case.

42
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,600
So he wants to kill Lu Jiu.

43
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,400
He's afraid he'll be the one to kill Lu Jiu.

44
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,600
I think he's afraid of changes in the case.

45
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,400
So he wants to kill Lu Jiu.

46
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,800
Does anyone else know about this?

47
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,200
I've told Officer Zhao of the prison guard.

48
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,000
He said that Lu Jiu's food was made by the kitchen in the yard.

49
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,400
No one else touched it.

50
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,400
But I can trust Officer Zhao's character.

51
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,400
He didn't make it.

52
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,000
Okay.

53
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,600
Let's just leave it at that.

54
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,600
Don't let anyone know about this.

55
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,000
What are you going to do?

56
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,800
Xu Linglong, I know you're a little stupid.

57
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,000
You always think I'm useless.

58
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,200
But I can do it in this position.

59
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,800
I have my own reason.

60
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,400
Go ahead.

61
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Thank you, sir.

62
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,800
You're useless.

63
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,000
You poisoned Second Young Master and he's dead.

64
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,200
You let a little coroner do it?

65
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,000
You're doing it for Second Young Master.

66
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I heard he's trying to get him to turn the case.

67
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,000
Xu Linglong.

68
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,600
The prison is closed now.

69
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:35,200
How can I find out about Lu Jiu's poisoning?

70
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,400
What's the matter, Fan Dao?

71
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,200
Maybe I can help you.

72
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,400
A craftman?

73
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,600
An old customer. I can give you a discount.

74
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,800
It's a pity you can't help me.

75
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,400
As long as the price is right, there's nothing I can't do.

76
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,400
Lu Jiu is in prison. He's really vicious.

77
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,000
How can I protect him?

78
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,400
Who says there's no way?

79
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,000
At least I can go to jail and tell your friend.

80
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
But it seems...

81
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Don't worry. We'll take care of this business.

82
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
But we won't break the law.

83
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,200
Then I'll leave it to you.

84
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,400
It's easy to say.

85
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,600
But everything has its costs.

86
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,400
As long as I can save Lu Jiu, I'll pay any amount.

87
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,000
Take it.

88
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,000
I'm a businessman, not a crook.

89
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,600
I only make what I should.

90
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,600
Besides, I'm on my way.

91
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,000
On your way?

92
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,600
According to the order of the Lord,

93
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,800
the drug dealer has taken care of the letter after giving it to Xu Ling.

94
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,000
Good.

95
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:48,800
We can't let Lu Jiu fall into the hands of those people.

96
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:54,800
Hunting and killing is more interesting than shooting arrows.

97
00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:01,400
It's more exciting to play with people's lives.

98
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,400
Lu Jiu

99
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,600
There's another one.

100
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,400
Ying Lang, what are you doing?

101
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,600
This is the Southern House.

102
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,600
I'm reckless.

103
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,200
I just want to learn the decoding technique from my brother.

104
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,800
I heard that Lu Mingcheng has the disease of timidity.

105
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,200
I want to see if the timidity is the same as the shoot of the high monk's son.

106
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,200
You know how he died.

107
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,600
Why do you check that?

108
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,400
You didn't break the body?

109
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,200
The condition of the body is similar to the description of the Lu family's servant.

110
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:45,400
Didn't you check that the female corpse is Wan Lingling?

111
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,800
When she was carried here, she was wearing a wedding dress.

112
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,800
If it wasn't Lu Mingcheng, who else could it be?

113
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,200
You're not so stupid.

114
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,400
No, I want to check again.

115
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,400
Xu Linglang, you've been a coroner for years.

116
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,600
The corpse I've seen is more saltier than the one you've eaten.

117
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,400
Go, go, go.

118
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,800
I'm sorry, brother.

119
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,800
Xu Linglang, what are you doing?

120
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,600
Let me down. What are you doing?

121
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,200
Xu Linglang, what are you doing? Let me down.

122
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,600
Xu Linglang, you're breaking the law. Do you know that?

123
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,000
It's urgent. You should take more time.

124
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,200
You...

125
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,200
I...

126
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,600
The location is the same as the case provided by the pharmacy.

127
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,800
The dead person is not Lu Mingcheng.

128
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,600
Sir.

129
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:36,800
Sir.

130
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,800
Xu Linglang, do you know that

131
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,600
the body of the deceased is the same as the case provided by the pharmacy?

132
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,200
Xu Linglang, Xu Linglang.

133
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,200
Did you sneak into my study?

134
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,600
I've checked the corpse.

135
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,200
The male corpse of the Lu family is not Lu Mingcheng.

136
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,600
The deceased is not Lu Mingcheng.

137
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,800
He's a servant of the missing person.

138
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,200
The Lu family's housekeeper knows nothing about the missing person.

139
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,600
Wait.

140
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,800
As a girl, you're testing the male corpse.

141
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,400
This is illegal.

142
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,000
If the superior knows about this, it's my responsibility.

143
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
It's urgent. Everything should be done in a case.

144
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Enough.

145
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,800
Don't be so straightforward.

146
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,400
What kind of person are you?

147
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,000
You don't have any feelings for her, do you?

148
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,200
Besides, you're a coroner. You're investigating cases.

149
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,600
If no one cares about you, do you want to be my bodyguard?

150
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,400
I'm willing to be punished for my mistakes.

151
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,200
But there's one thing about the Lu family case.

152
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,400
If you can prove Lu Jiu's innocence,

153
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,400
the bodyguard will praise you for your intelligence.

154
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,000
I don't need your intelligence.

155
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,200
Go.

156
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,000
I'll take my leave.

157
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,000
Sir.

158
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,800
How many days has it been?

159
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,200
A few days.

160
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,600
How did you know my brother died?

161
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,800
I didn't know.

162
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,400
I didn't know.

163
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,200
I didn't know.

164
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,000
I didn't know.

165
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,800
I didn't know.

166
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,600
I didn't know.

167
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,400
I didn't know.

168
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,200
I didn't know.

169
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,600
I didn't know.

170
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,400
I didn't know.

171
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,600
I don't know.

172
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,200
It's you.

173
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,800
We met in the gallery before.

174
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,400
That's right.

175
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,800
Why did you come in?

176
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,240
There will be such a good thing next time.

177
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,600
Remember to be a brother.

178
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,520
What are you looking at?

179
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,880
Stay here.

180
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,920
Please enjoy.

181
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,040
Actually, someone asked me to help you get a letter.

182
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,160
Be careful of the person who poisoned you.

183
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:30,480
Who is it?

184
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,280
It's my professional assistant

185
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,640
to keep the owner's identity secret.

186
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,280
Who is it?

187
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,520
It's him.

188
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,360
It must be him.

189
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,400
Since I can take money in,

190
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,760
I can take money to take you out.

191
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,760
How do I get out of the deep-dark prison?

192
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,080
I'm the kind of person

193
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,760
who is most suitable to wait for death

194
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,120
in the prison.

195
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,240
Remember to change shifts

196
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,240
in a hurry.

197
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,520
You want to get a letter to get a credit?

198
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,280
It's not worth it

199
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,440
to get a letter.

200
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,080
But it's different to help Mr. Lu Jiu.

201
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,440
You want me to die in prison.

202
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,480
Only by living

203
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,880
can I find out the truth.

204
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,560
My Lord.

205
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,440
My Lord.

206
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:31,600
What's wrong?

207
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,760
When will the case of Lu Jiu

208
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,320
be reviewed again?

209
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,400
The evidence is solid.

210
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:37,800
It doesn't need to be reviewed again.

211
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,640
But I gave you a new

212
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,360
autopsy report yesterday.

213
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,320
New autopsy report?

214
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,640
I didn't receive it.

215
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,280
If you don't care,

216
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,960
I'll submit it to the Investigation Department.

217
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:53,800
Go ahead.

218
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,400
Is the Investigation Department

219
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,600
able to report

220
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,640
a low-level coroner?

221
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,720
I'll report it to the Department of Justice

222
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,720
and the Golden Wheel Palace.

223
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,120
You want to rebel?

224
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,120
I declare

225
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,000
that I will not allow those two coroners to work.

226
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,160
You are not a member of the government.

227
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,960
You have no right to participate in the investigation.

228
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:09,960
Come on.

229
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,120
Drive her out.

230
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:13,800
Get lost.

231
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:14,640
Yes.

232
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,240
You...

233
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,360
You are a dog officer.

234
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,440
I'll let the truth be revealed one day.

235
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,480
You are a dog officer.

236
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,880
Let go of me.

237
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,000
Dog officer.

238
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,080
I'm so tired

239
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,040
from working late.

240
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,360
Don't tell me

241
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,360
that the steamed buns in your prison

242
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,400
are quite delicious.

243
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,720
That's right.

244
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,520
Here,

245
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,400
no matter it's the common people

246
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,680
or the rich,

247
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,600
as long as they eat the steamed buns

248
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,480
after a few days of prison,

249
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,200
they'll find it delicious.

250
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,400
I'm leaving, bro.

251
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,360
What?

252
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,520
You've regretted it?

253
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,080
It's easy to capture her key.

254
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,680
Even a person can get her key.

255
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,040
I didn't expect you to observe it so carefully.

256
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,600
The stubborn young master Lu Jiu

257
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,120
that everyone has seen is indeed a fake.

258
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,840
We are the same.

259
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,240
Didn't you just pretend to steal the key

260
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,240
and see my reaction?

261
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,640
Who said that?

262
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,600
Let's see what you have.

263
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:36,040
Island in the

264
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,160
Are you not left

265
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,760
because you are suspicious of me?

266
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,520
It's the same place as the Eight Stages in the Western County.

267
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,680
He escaped in broad daylight.

268
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,600
He was willing to die.

269
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,960
Then you just let this chance go in vain.

270
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,120
It's a good chance to get a good rest.

271
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,480
That's right.

272
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,240
Lu Kun was very powerful back then.

273
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,600
How could his son

274
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,840
be a mediocre man?

275
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,000
Hurry up.

276
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,760
Hurry up.

277
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,680
What are you doing?

278
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,080
What?

279
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:22,760
Hurry up.

280
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,360
Sir, it's me.

281
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,120
Sir.

282
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,640
Sir, don't run.

283
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,720
Sir, you must want to ask

284
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,440
why I followed you to Luoyang County.

285
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,280
That's because I'm your assistant.

286
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,280
I heard that you sneaked into Luoyang County.

287
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,760
Of course I have to catch up with the guests.

288
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:54,880
It's temporary assistant.

289
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,840
So you care about the details

290
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,040
about me so much.

291
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,520
Sir,

292
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,480
the Imperial Examination Department

293
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,520
has always been strict with women.

294
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,160
But fortunately, my father is the Prince.

295
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,560
As long as I'm interested in the case,

296
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,480
no one can stop me.

297
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,720
Interested in the case?

298
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,240
You're more interested in you.

299
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,560
I actually promised the Prince

300
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,640
to keep you by his side.

301
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:17,880
I won't break my promise.

302
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,960
But if you can't pass the examination,

303
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,560
you can go back to the capital city with me.

304
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,960
No problem, sir.

305
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,320
Sir,

306
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,080
what case are you going to hold

307
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,360
in Luoyang County?

308
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,480
This is the first exam I gave you.

309
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,760
You want to examine

310
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,760
what I've found in the capital city.

311
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,560
But I only found that

312
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,960
people are very fond of you.

313
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,560
The storybook says that

314
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,680
once you faced the attack of ten people,

315
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,600
you fought them with one punch.

316
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,440
You fought them with your fists.

317
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,440
They were defeated.

318
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,240
People also call you

319
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,820
the best

320
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,320
Lord Geng.

321
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,000
You're Lord Geng?

322
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:53,840
Yes.

323
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,520
My dream is to be like you

324
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,040
and help the people investigate the case.

325
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,120
Lord Geng,

326
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,200
you're here for personal reasons.

327
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,520
Is it because of the case of the Lu family?

328
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,480
Did Tong Yao meet the Lu family?

329
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,200
Yes.

330
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,240
This is my report.

331
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,240
Lu Jiu was sentenced to jail

332
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,640
and the court is under his protection.

333
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,880
Please make the decision.

334
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,040
Your Excellency,

335
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:18,920
you didn't really

336
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,520
believe that girl, did you?

337
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,720
The storybook says it clearly.

338
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,040
It's logical.

339
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,720
Look at her.

340
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,880
Look at you.

341
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,840
I'm not like her.

342
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,800
I'm a proper

343
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,480
inspection officer.

344
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,240
Yes.

345
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,360
A temporary officer

346
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,840
who wipes the rouge.

347
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:38,840
Your Excellency,

348
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,040
I have some ideas

349
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,440
about the Lu family case.

350
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,440
Whether it's a case of injustice,

351
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,520
I think

352
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,600
Lu Jiu

353
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,240
won't sit and wait.

354
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,240
Maybe

355
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,240
he'll prove himself innocent by prison.

356
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:03,560
What are you doing?

357
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:06,760
Lu Jiu is in prison.

358
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:07,720
What's going on?

359
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,000
Lu Jiu is like a crazy man.

360
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,240
He beat up several brothers.

361
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,040
Let's go.

362
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,520
You...

363
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:23,840
It seems that

364
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,240
you planned all this.

365
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,200
The clothes and the powder are in the budget.

366
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,720
But you should add...

367
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,600
Passing the river and breaking the bridge

368
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,360
is the way of Mr. Lu Jiu.

369
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:37,800
I'm not the kind of person

370
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,360
who passes the river and breaks the bridge.

371
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,400
But

372
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,320
you showed up

373
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,360
to me several times.

374
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,800
You planned the prison as well.

375
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:44,800
You didn't do anything.

376
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,560
Tell me.

377
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,560
What's your motive?

378
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,920
You saved Mr. Lu Jiu's life

379
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,680
and took half of the Lu family's property.

380
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,680
Isn't that too much?

381
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,480
I'm afraid you'll be disappointed.

382
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,520
Our business

383
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,800
has nothing to do with us.

384
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,800
Then let me help you.

385
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,160
When I met my father last time,

386
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,600
it was six or seven years ago.

387
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,760
He wouldn't

388
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,840
make such a big effort for me.

389
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,400
That's not necessarily the case.

390
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,200
Now your brother is dead.

391
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,720
You're his only son.

392
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,680
Mr. Lu is a businessman.

393
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,600
He knows how to be a man of power.

394
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,920
Yes.

395
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,040
The world is full of ups and downs.

396
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,400
It's full of ups and downs.

397
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,240
The world is full of ups and downs.

398
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,240
It's full of ups and downs.

399
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,920
Fine.

400
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,040
I don't know martial arts.

401
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,640
I need you on this journey.

402
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:31,480
Deal.

403
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,480
This is not a normal umbrella.

404
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,480
Who are you?

405
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,120
Shut up.

406
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:34,920
Run.

407
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:38,880
Go after them.

408
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,880
Your umbrella.

409
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,880
Over there.

410
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:50,880
Go.

411
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,880
Hurry.

412
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:52,880
Hurry.

413
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,880
Hurry.

414
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,880
Hurry.

415
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,880
Hurry.

416
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,880
Hurry.

417
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,880
Hurry.

418
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,880
Hurry.

419
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,880
Hurry.

420
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,880
Hurry.

421
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,880
Hurry.

422
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,880
Stop.

423
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,480
Go.

424
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,280
You owe me a favor.

425
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,280
We owe each other.

426
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,880
Dad.

427
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:32,880
Dad.

428
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,280
I'm afraid that you'll be so angry.

429
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,880
It's no use.

430
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,680
Luckily,

431
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,080
I met you

432
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,680
before I left.

433
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,080
You're so beautiful.

434
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,080
I'm so happy.

435
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,080
I'm so happy.

436
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,080
I'm so happy.

437
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,080
I'm so happy.

438
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,080
I'm so happy.

439
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,080
I'm so happy.

440
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,080
I'm so happy.

441
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,080
I'm so happy.

442
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,080
I'm so happy.

443
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,080
I'm so happy.

444
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,080
I'm so happy.

445
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,280
On one side,

446
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,080
I'm

447
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,880
the happiest person in my life

448
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:10,480
is to have you as my daughter.

449
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,280
Dad.

450
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,880
I used to think

451
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:19,280
if you were really my daughter,

452
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,480
it would be so great.

453
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,080
Dad.

454
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,880
I'm your daughter.

455
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,680
In the underground prison,

456
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,680
there's a heart-shaped doll

457
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,680
of your biological parents

458
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:36,680
in the dark room.

459
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,680
Take the heart-shaped doll

460
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,680
to the dark room

461
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:44,680
to find Uncle.

462
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,280
I don't want to find Uncle.

463
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:49,280
I just want you to be by my side.

464
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,280
Actually,

465
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:53,680
I just want to

466
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,680
be by your side

467
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,680
all the time.

468
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,680
Dad.

469
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,680
I want to be by your side.

470
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,680
Dad.

471
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,280
Dad.

472
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,680
Dad.

473
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,680
Dad.

474
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:15,680
Dad, look at me.

475
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,680
Maybe the secret of my brother's death

476
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,680
is hidden in this secret room.

477
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,680
Something is really hiding from me.

478
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,680
And it's a big deal.

479
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,680
The material.

480
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,680
When you get to the material,

481
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,680
maybe you can reveal

482
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,680
the secret you want to know.

483
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,680
What's wrong?

484
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,680
What's going on?

485
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,680
What's going on?

486
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,680
What's going on?

487
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,680
What's going on?

488
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,680
It seems that even if we disguise ourselves,

489
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,680
it's hard to get out of the city.

490
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,680
What's going on?

491
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,680
What's going on?

492
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,680
Go and buy me a sugar-coated gourd.

493
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,680
At this time, you still...

494
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,680
I can't get my money out.

495
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,680
Before I leave,

496
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,680
I have to see someone.

497
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,680
Ling Lang.

498
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:28,680
Why did your father suddenly...

499
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,680
That day I just entered the house.

500
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,680
I saw the thief for a day.

501
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,680
My father...

502
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,680
Last night, Sima Kong and I

503
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,680
were also attacked by someone.

504
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,680
I was so worried.

505
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,680
I was so worried.

506
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,680
I was so worried.

507
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,680
I was so worried.

508
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,680
I was so worried.

509
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,680
I was so worried.

510
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,680
I was so worried.

511
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,680
Sima Kong was also attacked.

512
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,680
Could it be...

513
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,680
I've investigated the traces of this fight.

514
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,680
It wasn't done by the same group of people.

515
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,680
Who did it?

516
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,680
As a police officer at the police station,

517
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,680
I shouldn't have told you some things.

518
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,680
But that bastard and the real murderer

519
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,680
stopped me from committing the crime.

520
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,680
Now I'm famous at the police station.

521
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,680
I still tell you

522
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,680
that I've been in the police station.

523
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,680
I've released the body again.

524
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,680
The body is not your brother at all.

525
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,680
The body is fake?

526
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,680
My brother's whereabouts are unknown.

527
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,680
The government is rushing to convict him.

528
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,680
There must be a conspiracy.

529
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,680
Now I'm the only witness.

530
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,680
I'm afraid it's very difficult to turn the case.

531
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,680
Wu Zhen.

532
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,680
The truth should be in Wu Zhen.

533
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,680
My father also asked me to go to Wu Zhen

534
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,680
to find my uncle before he died.

535
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,680
This is the letter

536
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,680
my parents left me.

537
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,680
It's just the right time.

538
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,680
But...

539
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,680
Sima Kong and I

540
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,680
are being wanted now.

541
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:20,680
lived in Donburi in想念

542
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,680
fed up with preparing for him

543
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,680
and

544
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,680
drove cars to Liu Dan's Numbering House

545
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:29,680
did nothing.

546
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,600
They are now

547
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,680
not afraid to be single

548
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,680
if not tried now.

549
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,680
That's a shame.

550
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,680
Wu Zhen,

551
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,680
by twist of fate,

552
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,440
Hey.

553
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,360
A few days ago,

554
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,880
someone broke into the Xu's Mansion

555
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:51,880
and killed Xu's father.

556
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,160
It's time to punish him.

557
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,360
He's so cunning.

558
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,520
Let's go.

559
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,000
My Lord.

560
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,640
The fake wanted notice was posted at the gate.

561
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,360
I've been taken away.

562
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,040
Lu Jiu and his men

563
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,840
have left the city as you planned.

564
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,760
Are we still going to chase them?

565
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,520
No need.

566
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:30,840
Wait for the good news.

567
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,760
Isn't this the Lu family's blood file

568
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:47,960
that the female coroner gave?

569
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,600
Why are there two copies?

570
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,920
I knew you were cold and hot.

571
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,480
I'm afraid I'm too tired.

572
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,120
Get out.

573
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,480
I'm the princess.

574
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,280
I'm here to help you pack up.

575
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,120
How dare you...

576
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,760
I don't have a princess here.

577
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,080
If you want to be a princess,

578
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,640
you can go back to the capital now.

579
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,080
I'm not a princess.

580
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,080
I'm a princess.

581
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,600
I'm not a princess.

582
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,600
I'm a princess.

583
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,600
I'm a princess.

584
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,600
I'm a princess.

585
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,600
I'm a princess.

586
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,600
I'm a princess.

587
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,600
I'm a princess.

588
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,600
I'm a princess.

589
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,600
I'm a princess.

590
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,600
I'm a princess.

591
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,600
I'm a princess.

592
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,600
I'm a princess.

593
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,600
I'm a princess.

594
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,600
I'm a princess.

595
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,600
I'm a princess.

596
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,600
I'm a princess.

597
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,600
I'm a princess.

598
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,600
I'm a princess.

599
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,600
I'm a princess.

600
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,600
I'm a princess.

601
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,600
I'm a princess.

602
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,600
I'm a princess.

603
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,600
I'm a princess.

604
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,600
I'm a princess.

605
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,600
I'm a princess.

606
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,600
I'm a princess.

607
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,600
I'm a princess.

608
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,600
I'm a princess.

609
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,600
I'm a princess.

610
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:48,400
Father, don't worry.

611
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,600
I'll go to Uncle Lin's house

612
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,120
according to your will.

613
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,920
If you want to eat or drink anything,

614
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,640
just tell me.

615
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,640
Don't worry about me.

616
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,680
Don't worry.

617
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,720
I'll take care of Lin Lang.

618
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,600
The capital was robbed?

619
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,600
Yes.

620
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,600
The body of Lu Zhai

621
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,600
isn't from Lu Ming City.

622
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,400
The Beggar Gang sent a message.

623
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,600
Someone spent a lot of money

624
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,920
to get rid of the body.

625
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,520
Even if Lu Ming City is not dead,

626
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,920
but he hasn't been found yet,

627
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,920
and the clue is only a miscarriage,

628
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,520
then Lu Jiu

629
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,520
is the last card in our hands.

630
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,520
So as long as we take his card,

631
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,520
we'll have hope

632
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,520
to find clues about the Lu family's treasure.

633
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,640
But

634
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:33,040
the government has already found Lu Jiu's clue.

635
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,800
There should be an informant around him.

636
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,520
Xu Linglong?

637
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,520
Why did he take so long to get rid of the body?

638
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,240
Someone was in the prison

639
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,240
to report the news.

640
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,520
Maybe

641
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,120
he went to meet that person.

642
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,720
Although Sima Kong

643
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,920
took my money

644
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,520
and went to the prison to send you a message,

645
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,320
he risked so much

646
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,320
to go with you to the prison.

647
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,520
I'm afraid he has other intentions.

648
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,640
Why are you looking at me?

649
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,520
It's you

650
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,240
who reminded Wei Yunhui to poison you.

651
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,240
Yes.

652
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:12,720
That day in the prison,

653
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,440
you kicked me out without listening to me.

654
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,120
How dare I report to you?

655
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,320
It's all my fault.

656
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:19,520
I shouldn't...

657
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,320
All right.

658
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,320
If all the evidence points to you,

659
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,120
I'm not so firm about your attitude.

660
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,520
Now we're even.

661
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,120
But

662
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,720
I have to be careful with Sima Kong.

663
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,520
Don't worry.

664
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,320
My surname is Liu Shu.

665
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:31,920
I don't know martial arts.

666
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:32,920
And he

667
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,520
has the skill of escaping death.

668
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,120
To find out the truth,

669
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,320
we need to find someone.

670
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:40,520
Lu Jiu,

671
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,720
I found that you're different from before.

672
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,520
Now

673
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,920
I'm missing

674
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,720
and I'm charged with murder.

675
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:49,720
I'm no longer

676
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,320
Lu Jiu.

677
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,520
We talked about the price of escorting people.

678
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,920
The investigation and tracking need extra price.

679
00:30:58,920 --> 00:30:59,920
Why did you go for so long?

680
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,720
I was just washing my hands.

681
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,320
But I thought I should go to the meeting

682
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,320
and change my clothes.

683
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,920
Mr. Sima is really Mr. Sima.

684
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,320
It's really unusual

685
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,720
to send someone to deliver clothes.

686
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:11,920
We're the same.

687
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:13,840
Is that so?

688
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,320
Yes.

689
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:27,520
I just flagshiped the bathroom and

690
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,920
got an order to go to the bathroom.

691
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,120
Go this way.

692
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:36,420
Wait.

693
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:39,920
This way.

694
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,320
Wu Zhen is located on the southeast of thebowland.

695
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,520
I feel that

696
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,280
she has a lot of things to hide from us.

697
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:46,640
Don't worry.

698
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,600
I'll protect you.
