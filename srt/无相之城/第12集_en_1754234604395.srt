偷寫與你瞄了有聽親歌

00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:03,420
It's a pity that no one is willing to leave behind

00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:08,200
After a thousand and twenty quarters of the nucleus of the insanity

10
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:13,260
It rains psychologists to chase after the anteater

Episode 16

18
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,480
Father once taught me

19
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,480
that if the evidence is complicated

20
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,480
when solving the puzzle,

21
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,480
as long as the subject is sincere,

22
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,480
and the two sides are in harmony,

23
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:13,480
he can find the result he wants from it.

24
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:16,480
He won't be disturbed by the other things.

25
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,480
Someone is here.

26
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,480
You are right.

27
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,480
The assassin saw us in the temple,

28
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,480
he was not surprised,

29
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,480
and wanted to come out of the temple.

30
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,480
This is your trick.

31
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,480
You are not stupid.

32
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,480
You are a little brainless.

33
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,480
But it's a pity

34
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,480
that you understood it too late.

35
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,480
You two have a good plan.

36
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,480
You even fooled me.

37
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,480
We didn't notice it.

38
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,480
We were afraid that you were afraid,

39
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,480
so we hid it from you.

40
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,480
I understand.

41
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,480
I'm the best at solving the puzzle.

42
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,480
Say it.

43
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,480
Who sent you here?

44
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,480
You think you are so smart.

45
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,480
Why do you interrogate me?

46
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,480
Fine.

47
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,480
I can't help you.

48
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,480
What are you doing?

49
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,480
What are you doing?

50
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,480
What are you doing?

51
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,480
This is the real thing.

52
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,480
This is the legendary ten torture games.

53
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:28,480
It seems normal to pass on these ten torture games,

54
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,480
but everything can make people

55
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,480
beg for life and death.

56
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,480
I only heard that you have it.

57
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,480
If you like it,

58
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,480
I'll give it to you.

59
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,480
Really?

60
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,480
There is no torture game

61
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,480
for girls.

62
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,480
But today,

63
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,480
I can let Lin Lang try it.

64
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,480
You guys,

65
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,480
don't be too arrogant.

66
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,480
The people who want to catch you

67
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,480
are not only us.

68
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,480
Tian Luo,

69
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,480
Tang Man,

70
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,480
and the people from the E.R.

71
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,480
Department are watching you.

72
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,480
You won't be able to

73
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,480
rest in peace

74
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,480
even if you kill me.

75
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,480
So you are from the Assassin League.

76
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,480
We can handle it.

77
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,480
You are lying to me.

78
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,480
But he is right.

79
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,480
The forces of all parties

80
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,480
have tightened their pursuit of us.

81
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,480
We must speed up.

82
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,480
Sir, please.

83
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,480
It's right ahead.

84
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,480
You have to talk to him for a while.

85
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,480
Or else, the patrol will come.

86
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,480
I can't afford to wait.

87
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,480
My father has passed away.

88
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,480
No one is holding me back.

89
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,480
Now,

90
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,480
you are going to kill me, right?

91
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,480
You misunderstood.

92
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,480
I am Geng Zhao from the E.R. Department.

93
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,480
I am really embarrassed.

94
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,480
I am sorry.

95
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,480
I am sorry.

96
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,480
I am sorry.

97
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,480
I am sorry.

98
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,480
I am sorry.

99
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,480
I am sorry.

100
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,480
I am sorry.

101
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,480
I am sorry.

102
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,480
I am sorry.

103
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,480
I am sorry.

104
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,480
I am sorry.

105
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,480
I am sorry.

106
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,480
I am sorry.

107
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,480
I am sorry.

108
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,480
I am sorry.

109
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,480
You are a liar.

110
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,480
Before you die,

111
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,480
you can still read

112
00:04:52,480 --> 00:05:16,680
the first

113
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,480
Go to the capital's capital

114
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,480
and investigate the details.

115
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,480
The numbers will be left.

116
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,480
You will never lie to anyone.

117
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,480
Thank you for your advice.

118
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,480
The closer you get to the truth,

119
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,480
the closer you get to your death.

120
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,480
According to the clues given by Mr. Meng,

121
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,480
the Tang family has indeed

122
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,480
secretly collected money

123
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,480
in the name of the Ministry of Works.

124
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,480
But the family's income is a lot.

125
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,480
It is not a strange thing

126
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,480
to secretly collect money.

127
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,480
Sir, why do you

128
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,480
pay special attention to the Tang family?

129
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,480
The problem is

130
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,480
that their accounts are hidden.

131
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,480
Seven years ago, after the Feiyin case,

132
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,480
Tian Luo and the Tang family

133
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,480
had multiple money

134
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,480
to get out of the city.

135
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,480
You mean

136
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,480
every time they entered,

137
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,480
the dirty money was checked.

138
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,480
Before Feiyin disappeared,

139
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,480
they appeared in the Tianchi cemetery.

140
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,480
If the tomb was the tomb,

141
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:20,480
the money was the burial object.

142
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,480
But after the case,

143
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,480
Feiyin disappeared.

144
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,480
There must be

145
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,480
a bigger secret behind it.

146
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,480
As my father expected,

147
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,480
the Geng Zhao of the Diancha Temple

148
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,480
has been found

149
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,480
by the Tang family and the Ministry of Works.

150
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,480
These fools

151
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,480
only know to wait for others to come to feed them.

152
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,480
Once there is danger around,

153
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,480
they will fight back.

154
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,480
It's good to help us

155
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,480
to find new clues.

156
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,480
Sir,

157
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,480
I made the night incense for you.

158
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,480
Thank you.

159
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,480
I knew it was bought outside.

160
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,480
There is also

161
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,480
the paper taste of the Dianxin shop.

162
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,480
I knew it was a secret.

163
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,480
I didn't make it

164
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,480
because I was afraid

165
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,480
you wouldn't eat it.

166
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,480
So...

167
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,480
So you changed the crown.

168
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,480
This is quite ugly.

169
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,480
In the future,

170
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,480
pay more attention to the investigation.

171
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,480
Don't do anything tasteless.

172
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,480
I am the princess.

173
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,480
This is the first time I cook for someone.

174
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,480
Even my father

175
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,480
has never eaten what I cook.

176
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,480
You actually...

177
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,480
It's ugly,

178
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,480
but it tastes

179
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,480
pretty good.

180
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,480
You're so stubborn.

181
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,480
Hu Xingquan.

182
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,480
He is really Fei Ying.

183
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,480
How dare you

184
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,480
enter the inspection department at night?

185
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,480
What do you think this is?

186
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,480
Don't move.

187
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,480
Fire!

188
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,480
Fire!

189
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,480
Sir.

190
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,480
Sir.

191
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,480
Sir.

192
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,480
Sir.

193
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,480
Sir.

194
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,480
Sir, where are you?

195
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,480
Sir, are you okay?

196
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,480
Let's go.

197
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,480
Are you crazy?

198
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,480
You're going to die

199
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,480
without any protection.

200
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,480
I know you're in there.

201
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,480
I want to save you.

202
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,480
With my body,

203
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,480
do I need you to save me?

204
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,480
I...

205
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,480
Didn't you just see the paper taste?

206
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,480
Why did it suddenly start?

207
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,480
Someone broke in just now.

208
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,480
The person who came

209
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,480
should be Fei Ying.

210
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,480
They are all Tian Luo's killers.

211
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,480
They are Tian Luo's people.

212
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,480
It seems that

213
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,480
we are going to meet

214
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,480
their key man.

215
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,480
Don't be nervous.

216
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,480
The mystery will be revealed soon.

217
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,480
Yes.

218
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,480
When the mystery is revealed,

219
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,480
I can share the secret with you.

220
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,480
Why are you always

221
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,480
acting strange lately?

222
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,480
It seems that Lu Jiu and I

223
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,480
owe you something.

224
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,480
That's because...

225
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,480
Enough.

226
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,480
All the clues

227
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,480
are just like a pillow.

228
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,480
There is a seal behind it.

229
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,480
Yes. Yes.

230
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,480
Do you need anything?

231
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,480
I won't bother you.

232
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,480
Why do we have to bring him?

233
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,480
The cost is too high.

234
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,480
It's not worth it.

235
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,480
Why don't we kill him?

236
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,480
No.

237
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,480
Although he is a killer,

238
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,480
we don't have the right to kill him.

239
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,480
Let's just leave it to the government

240
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,480
after some time.

241
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,480
That's right.

242
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,480
He is sent by the Assassins Alliance.

243
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,480
I don't know the person behind it.

244
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,480
It might be useful

245
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,480
to keep him.

246
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,480
He's been in the dark for so long.

247
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,480
It's already late autumn.

248
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,480
I'm famous for hot pot.

249
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,480
It's also because you want to eat it.

250
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,480
It can make you feel better.

251
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,480
Why are you so generous all of a sudden?

252
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,480
Do you need me to write a note?

253
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,480
If someone else needs it,

254
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,480
you don't have to.

255
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,480
I won't be polite then.

256
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,480
No.

257
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,480
I'm too old to eat hot pot.

258
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,480
Fine.

259
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,480
You don't have money in your wallet anyway.

260
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,480
You have to spend mine.

261
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,480
Five copper coins per bowl.

262
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,480
I'll give it to you.

263
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,480
Thank you.

264
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,480
I'm leaving now.

265
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,480
See you.

266
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,480
Five copper coins per bowl.

267
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,480
Write it down on the account.

268
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,480
Why do you take my money?

269
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,480
Because you're shameless.

270
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,480
I'm shameless?

271
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,480
You're not shameless than me.

272
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,480
Whoever agrees, I'll say so.

273
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,480
You're obviously shameless than me.

274
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,480
I...

275
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,480
That's weird.

276
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,480
Why is there nothing?

277
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,480
That's right.

278
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,480
How can there be mosquitoes

279
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,480
in such a cold day?

280
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,480
Even if there are mosquitoes,

281
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,480
I can't see your shamelessness.

282
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,480
I'm just a little poor.

283
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,480
Enough.

284
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,480
Don't be like the little concubine.

285
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:25,080
The dependable

286
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,480
I made two sachets for you.

287
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,480
They're for pets.

288
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,480
Here.

289
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,480
You made this yourself?

290
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,480
Yes.

291
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,480
Mine looks better than the next one.

292
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,480
Nonsense.

293
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,480
Mine is more convenient.

294
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,480
Mine is better than yours.

295
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,480
Mine is better.

296
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,920
and smell and smell.

297
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:52,560
Didn't you

298
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,360
find a problem?

299
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:04,560
Over there.

300
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:12,960
It seems that

301
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,640
she knew that you were trying to track her

302
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,240
and touched her clothes.

303
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,200
But why didn't she fear the cold

304
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,280
when she wanted to take off her clothes?

305
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,840
If she ran away,

306
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,040
why didn't she take off

307
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,000
her weapon?

308
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,040
I did come here.

309
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,840
There is a map

310
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,720
leading to the house.

311
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,520
It means that she and my father

312
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,720
knew my identity

313
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,560
and tried to hide it from me.

314
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,200
If you don't want to tell the truth,

315
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,440
just go in and check it.

316
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,440
It's heavily foggy here.

317
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,280
Are you sure it's a hot pot restaurant?

318
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,520
I didn't see the hot pot restaurant.

319
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,960
But I saw

320
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,120
the place where people eat.

321
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,440
It's over there.

322
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,800
There is no bones. Only clothes.

323
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,760
It must be the old woman Yin Shan.

324
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,080
She was a master of magic.

325
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,160
But why

326
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,080
the old woman Yin Shan,

327
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,320
who is a man, came out again?

328
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,520
It's a pity.

329
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,120
Zhang Yuanwei spent a thousand taels

330
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,680
to make that magic.

331
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,360
Yes.

332
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,440
Yes.

333
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,600
She was eaten.

334
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:20,880
Her clothes are still there.

335
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,760
I think she is the same as Li Mu.

336
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,120
She is a fake mother.

337
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,680
She was kidnapped.

338
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:26,760
You little girl,

339
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:27,600
what do you know?

340
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,000
You are making trouble for me.

341
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,280
I'll see how you end up.

342
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:31,320
Yes.

343
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,280
The people outside know everything.

344
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,000
Let's go.

345
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:33,560
Let's go.

346
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,240
Let's go.

347
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:34,840
Yes.

348
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:35,640
Let's go.

349
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:37,320
Let's go.

350
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:44,760
Let's go.

351
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:45,800
Let's go and have a look.

352
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,760
The old woman Yin Shan is here.

353
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:05,960
Everyone, run!

354
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,000
Run!

355
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,040
Run!

356
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,440
Run!

357
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,560
Run!

358
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,440
Run!

359
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:14,960
Look how scared they are.

360
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,160
They even arrived.

361
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,480
They are playing tricks.

362
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,040
Let's open it.

363
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,560
It's strange.

364
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,800
Including the scholar and killer,

365
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,760
all the clothes and clothes of the missing people

366
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,880
have been taken off.

367
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,360
And the clothes are covered with leather.

368
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,520
They are old clothes.

369
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,680
They are not used for making false promises.

370
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,000
So you mean

371
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,520
they were all kidnapped.

372
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,280
Why did the kidnappers take them off?

373
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,720
My Lord, the explanation is

374
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,960
they can't wear clothes in that situation.

375
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,600
They can't wear clothes?

376
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,080
I once saw a kind of

377
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,120
secret recipe that was very popular on an ancient book.

378
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,800
The person who was controlled must take off

379
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,160
everything related to the past

380
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,800
in order to forget the memories and be driven away by others.

381
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,040
Isn't that a blood spell?

382
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,400
Yes.

383
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,920
Who are you?

384
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,200
You are devils.

385
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,960
You even let the dead go.

386
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,480
You will be punished.

387
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,400
Yes.

388
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,560
We will be punished.

389
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,400
Everyone,

390
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,440
we are not here to steal things from the dead.

391
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,360
To be honest,

392
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,640
I am a coroner.

393
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:26,920
According to my investigation,

394
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,960
there is another hidden person in the town.

395
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,120
The rumor of Aunt Yin Shan

396
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,800
was just fabricated by the murderer.

397
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,280
It's nonsense.

398
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,200
I have been practicing for many years.

399
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,480
The Grand Master was sincere with me

400
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,640
and gave me the secret recipe.

401
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,240
We finally knew that Yin Shan was dead.

402
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,280
You are not a little girl

403
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,000
who can talk nonsense.

404
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,160
The Taoist priest is right.

405
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,640
They are the ones who are addicted to the divine power.

406
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,040
They even stole things from the dead.

407
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,080
Arrest them.

408
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:55,600
Arrest them.

409
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,560
Arrest them.

410
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,480
Arrest them.

411
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,160
Stop.

412
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,400
Stop.

413
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,760
Stop.

414
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:01,680
Arrest them.

415
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:02,360
Stop.

416
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,040
Stop.

417
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,000
Stop.

418
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,120
Stop.

419
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,160
Why should we run?

420
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,240
They are just a few villagers.

421
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,640
I can handle them by myself.

422
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,720
After all,

423
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,440
they are just ordinary people.

424
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,560
They were caught up by the murderer

425
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,720
and then chased after us.

426
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,680
They even lost their families.

427
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:26,880
They are the most pitiful.

428
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,600
I am the one who said it.

429
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,280
You are indeed on the same page.

430
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,720
This is really strange.

431
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,680
We must find out the body quickly

432
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,400
to prevent more people from getting hurt.

433
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,480
But if we do this,

434
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,120
it may affect our purpose of coming to Wuzhen.

435
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:45,640
It's fine.

436
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,320
I'll investigate with you if you want to.

437
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:49,600
No.

438
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,960
I just heard from the people in the town

439
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,280
that someone spent a thousand taels of silver

440
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,520
to drive Granny Yin Shan away.

441
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,920
If we break the case,

442
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,680
the money will be yours.

443
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,440
No.

444
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,720
You can't even get the money.

445
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,040
That's how Lin Lang is.

446
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,280
We must investigate if he wants to.

447
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,200
Look at the mess.

448
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,480
This is not an ordinary case.

449
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,240
If it's really related to the murder of the murderer,

450
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,280
it must be very dangerous.

451
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,480
We can't let Lin Lang take the risk.

452
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,840
Why are you so excited?

453
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:12,520
I...

454
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,040
Investigate.

455
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:14,920
He won't investigate with you.

456
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:15,800
I'll investigate with you.

457
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:17,960
I...

458
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,760
I fell to the bottom of the pit.

459
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,000
I was framed.

460
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,840
So many people have disappeared.

461
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,920
I can't just sit around and do nothing.

462
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,200
Lu Qiao.

463
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,080
I'm sorry.

464
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:27,880
I'm sorry.

465
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:28,800
Lu Qiao.

466
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,200
Fine.

467
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,360
You love Tian Xiang.

468
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,240
Only I'm selfish.

469
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:37,960
Lin Lang.

470
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:38,640
Si Wan Kong.

471
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,760
Just let him calm down.

472
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,960
His bag is still there.

473
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,080
I bet he'll be in the same room as me.

474
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,520
You two are in a harmony.

475
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,040
I'm doing this for your own good.

476
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,280
When did I become like this?

477
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,480
Being exactly like that?

478
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,200
Definitely not.

479
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,640
I just believe this.

480
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,400
Lin Lang,

481
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:06,500
please forgive me for not having done well to Beside Hai'stung Restaurant.

482
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:09,800
Sir,

483
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,200
I like to have it but I don't like livening up when wine glasses don't work.

484
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,040
If this time were stood by something nice,

485
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,920
I could've bought the restaurant in the first place.

486
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,800
this time as the singing hymn ofード

487
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,040
if myThis time as the singing hymn ofreibende

488
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:27,800
if my

489
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,600
Why do you ask me?

490
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,040
His Majesty set up the Celestial Fall

491
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,280
to stabilize the country.

492
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,440
But now the Celestial Fall

493
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,480
is heavily armed.

494
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,040
They are using this to protect the country.

495
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:40,200
Tang Men is using it to pay for their military expenses.

496
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,400
If the case is cleared now,

497
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,560
I can still plead for His Majesty.

498
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,800
Let me say it again.

499
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,480
Tang Men only takes money for business.

500
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,400
He never asks about the guests' intentions.

501
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,480
He never violates the law of the court.

502
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,040
Do you think you can

503
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:56,960
clean up your own mess

504
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,440
by saying that?

505
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,520
If that's the case,

506
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,440
why don't you report it to the court?

507
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,400
Why do you come to me to ask questions?

508
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,920
Because you know

509
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,440
I obey His Majesty.

510
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,280
You dare not to decide

511
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,320
whether it's His Majesty's order or not.

512
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,840
No matter whose order it is,

513
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,000
I, Geng Zhao,

514
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,000
will leave the Palace of Judicial Review

515
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,040
to investigate the case

516
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,480
for the people of the world.

517
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,560
But now the world is in chaos.

518
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,800
People are suffering.

519
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,480
I, Geng Zhao, will not sit back and do nothing.

520
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,600
Then I hope you can find out the truth as soon as possible.

521
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,200
This is the secret report

522
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,680
I received today from the Procuratorate.

523
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,600
I hope you can take care of yourself

524
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,000
after reading it.

525
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,720
I haven't failed you yet.

526
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,640
Go through it as soon as possible.

527
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,440
You must go through it.

528
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,280
Yes, Your Majesty.

529
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:18,800
See you.

530
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,800
you will be fooled by Dugu.

531
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,440
What are you looking at?

532
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:28,520
Your Excellency,

533
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,240
I think you are the most brave man

534
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,640
in the world.

535
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,840
It's more important to get the official business.

536
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,160
Pack up our luggage now.

537
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,400
We are going to Wuzhen.

538
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:39,480
Yes.

539
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,240
It's time.

540
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,680
Lu Jiu and his men should be here.

541
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,880
We must take the chance

542
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,960
before Tian Luo and his men.

543
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,440
Then let's go.

544
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,560
It's already four or five minutes.

545
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,920
Why hasn't he come back yet?

546
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,200
He shouldn't have come back.

547
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,000
Let's go and check on him.

548
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:04,840
Sima Gu.

549
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:07,840
Sima Gu.

550
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,240
Oh no.

551
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:16,920
He's gone.

552
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,520
He's gone.

553
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,520
It's Li Yi again.

554
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,120
His clothes are still warm.

555
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,080
He shouldn't have gone far.

556
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,280
It's not too late to chase him now.

557
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:26,560
Let's go.

558
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,560
What's this place?

559
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,640
Is he hurt?

560
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:10,960
What must be the cause of his injury?

561
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,040
Maybe he's still unconscious.

562
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:15,960
It's on the book.

563
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,800
Who are you?

564
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:24,840
What are you doing?

565
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,160
There are traces of people walking on both sides.

566
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,280
Let's split up to chase them.

567
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,000
Wait.

568
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,560
The number of people on the other side is definitely not small.

569
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:42,640
How can I let you

570
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,520
walk alone?

571
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,240
You can't.

572
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:44,880
How can I let you

573
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,800
take the risk alone?

574
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:46,840
It's getting dark.

575
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,120
We don't have much time left

576
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,000
to save Sima Kong.

577
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,280
If the enemy only uses

578
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,440
the evil spell that can kill people,

579
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,560
what is more important than

580
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,560
saving Sima Kong?

581
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,720
We really don't have much time left.

582
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:56,720
Let's go.

583
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,480
Be careful.

584
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,080
Let's go.

585
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,080
Sorry.

586
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:53,640
It's you.

587
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,680
You recognized me?

588
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,240
We just met by chance.

589
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,560
Although you saved me just now,

590
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:01,760
what does it mean?

591
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,520
Fei Ying,

592
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,480
I'm Ye Mei.

593
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,520
I've been with you since I was little.

594
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,080
I'm sorry.

595
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,680
I'm sorry.

596
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,360
I'm sorry.

597
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,960
I'm Ye Mei who grew up with you.

598
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:17,880
It's more important

599
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,720
to achieve your goal than to take the necessary measures.

600
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,480
Since Fei Ying has brought back

601
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,760
the materials you ordered,

602
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,360
please forgive me.

603
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,120
Are you all right?

604
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:27,760
Senior,

605
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,040
begging for mercy is useless.

606
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,760
Only if you live

607
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,600
can you have hope.

608
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:15,960
Lu Jiu.

609
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:24,760
Ling Lang.

610
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:33,640
Ling Lang,

611
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,880
it's not what you think.

612
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,800
Listen to my explanation.

613
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,840
I just want to save Sima Kong.

614
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:39,880
I...

615
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,680
Why do you explain to him?

616
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,080
I've been with you since I was little.

617
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,200
We grew up together.

618
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,680
We've been through the same thing.

619
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,440
No matter what memories I have with you,

620
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,280
I'm telling you,

621
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,680
I have nothing to do with you.

622
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:53,960
Stop.

623
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,480
What if

624
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,520
I know where your friends are?

625
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,680
They're all here?

626
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,280
Yes.

627
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,840
They've followed your plan

628
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,040
to check on the old lady in Chanyin Mountain.

629
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,520
The shadow that has been in the water for 20 years

630
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,160
can disappear.

631
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,080
Yes, Father.

632
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,480
Ling Lang,

633
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,200
I will surely 안善无恙地

634
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,240
go out and meet you.

635
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,520
I'll go see you all.

636
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,160
Ling Lang.

637
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,240
와서 prejudice

638
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,480
sooner or later.

639
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:44,800
Come on.

640
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,600
Let's piss him off.

641
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,840
Do you hear me?

642
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,880
Who are you?

643
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:01,680
What are you doing?

644
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:03,720
Miss Su.

645
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:04,960
My wound has cucumber.

646
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,900
It is good to get one back

647
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:07,960
after catching dozens of people.

648
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,000
replaced by your shoes, right?

649
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:28,360
You'releb to気 off this

650
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,040
Don't come out alive

651
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,360
You don't deserve this meal

652
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,780
Father!

653
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:50,980
Let me die...

654
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,660
Father!

655
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:09,360
Let go of me.

656
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,360
What are you doing?

657
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,360
Stay still.

658
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,360
Didn't you say you'd take us to Sima Kong?

659
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,360
Why are we here?

660
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,360
I only said that there was a clue.

661
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:47,360
When did I say that he was here?

662
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:52,360
Sima Kong's whereabouts are unknown.

663
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,360
They must have done it too.

664
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,360
Since they are in this coffin,

665
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:58,360
maybe we can find the clue

666
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:00,360
in the clothes before he disappeared.

667
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:19,560
Zhao

668
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:23,240
I am世如 Pretty

669
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:26,360
Even the World can't be 유

670
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,840
Kill them!

671
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,400
It's just a natural thing.

672
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,840
They were scared to death.

673
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,600
I guess they were also

674
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,040
suffering from the pain of Yinshan's grandmother.

675
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,640
Poor them.

676
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,840
You've been busy for so long

677
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,560
just to save these stupid people?

678
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,520
No matter what, they're still a life.

679
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,880
How can we just sit and watch?

680
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,880
It's better to die

681
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,760
if you're useless.

682
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:09,960
Right?

683
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,680
I saw you and Lu Jiu were friends.

684
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,040
You saved him yesterday.

685
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,280
I thought you were just a cold-blooded person.

686
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,840
I didn't expect you to be so cold-blooded.

687
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,480
He and I are the same.

688
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:27,560
Am I right?

689
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:33,640
Listen to me.

690
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,440
Listen to me.

691
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,080
I...

692
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,680
I just forgot what happened before.

693
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,320
Forget it.

694
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,000
I don't want to hear about the past.

695
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:42,720
No, Linglong.

696
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,120
I knew it.

697
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,800
Although your memory hasn't recovered,

698
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,520
what you think in your heart

699
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,240
is the same as what I think,

700
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,080
right?

701
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:53,720
You don't have to pretend

702
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,840
that you know me very well.

703
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,440
I have nothing to do with the past.

704
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,160
That's you.

705
00:32:58,800 --> 00:32:59,480
Let's get down to business.

706
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,120
Mi.

707
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,600
The flowers bloom

708
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:11,160
The heart is written on the paper

709
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:16,920
The dream is a life, a life, a life, a life

710
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:22,880
The dream is a life, a life, a life

711
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:28,760
I will never forget you for my whole life

712
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:34,240
The mountains and rivers are long gone

713
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:39,880
I will never forget you for my whole life

714
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:45,720
I will never forget you for my whole life

715
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:51,960
If we can meet again, how will it be?

716
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:57,320
I will write your name on the paper

717
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:02,280
of time
