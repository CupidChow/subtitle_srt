1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Your Majesty

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,220
You wake up before amplifier

3
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:40,020
The smile of together was light as a everywhere dream

4
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:44,760
My excitement is like a cherish

5
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:50,720
The

6
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:54,000
heartbeats that end in Zhejiang

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,860
Throw a line eaves, smexing to listen to songs

8
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:03,360
The scene carried three eagles

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,980
The print volumeош

10
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:12,560
Yinyi N drifting

11
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:17,340
What's wrong with my dried feet

12
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:21,980
A needle and Excise

13
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:26,960
I'd be grateful if you were trying to find us

14
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,960
Episode 18

15
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:09,880
Let's go.

16
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:10,680
Let's go.

17
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,560
It's here.

18
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,200
Come out.

19
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,440
You found me?

20
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,120
You've been hiding behind me for a long time.

21
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,360
How could I not find you?

22
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,040
You should have told me earlier.

23
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,440
You made me walk so hard.

24
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,480
Didn't you say

25
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,040
you were a trap by Xu Linglang?

26
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:27,760
What's wrong?

27
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,720
Have you changed your mind?

28
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,160
Who changed his mind?

29
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,840
I'm just afraid that you'll be fooled again

30
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,760
and no one will help you.

31
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,720
I'm innocent.

32
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,560
Even if I die,

33
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,360
no one will pay my respects.

34
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,200
I don't need to be punished.

35
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,680
I don't allow you to say that.

36
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,320
Get back to work.

37
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,920
Why is it so crowded here?

38
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,400
Let's find Sima Kong.

39
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,480
It's time to break the silence.

40
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,280
Let's go.

41
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,120
I found it.

42
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,280
Sima Kong.

43
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,520
Sima Kong.

44
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,360
No wonder no one lost.

45
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,920
He can't escape.

46
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,360
What's wrong with him?

47
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,360
With his personality,

48
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,400
he doesn't want us to see him like this.

49
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,040
Hurry up.

50
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,160
Sima Kong.

51
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,560
Sima Kong.

52
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,920
Sima Kong.

53
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,280
Sima Kong.

54
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,160
Sister.

55
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,800
Sister, please save me.

56
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:41,600
I'm scared.

57
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,560
Don't be afraid.

58
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,800
We're here to save you.

59
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,120
Someone is coming.

60
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:51,800
We should leave.

61
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,640
We can't leave him here alone.

62
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,240
Yinping can't do that.

63
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,160
We should leave.

64
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,160
Don't worry.

65
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,600
We'll save you.

66
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,680
Wait for us here.

67
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,640
I'm leaving.

68
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,240
Let's go.

69
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,000
Sister, don't go.

70
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,120
Everyone.

71
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,680
Sorry for the long wait.

72
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,040
The slave trade conference

73
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,760
is about to begin.

74
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,360
Come on.

75
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,520
Get on the fire.

76
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,480
Everyone is here.

77
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,560
Look at these goods.

78
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,720
Each one is better than the other.

79
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,760
Can we do this?

80
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,320
From the number of people they have locked up

81
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,920
and the dressing of the horse family,

82
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,240
the business here is huge.

83
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,360
We can only make up for the losses.

84
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:44,760
Don't worry.

85
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,120
I've been to

86
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,600
a similar place with my brother.

87
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:50,680
Come here.

88
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,760
This is the first time

89
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,120
I've seen a slave.

90
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,320
What is this?

91
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,680
Right.

92
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,080
I can't look down on him.

93
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:05,120
He's worth more than four pieces.

94
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,160
He's worth more than his brain.

95
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,880
The martial arts skills of all major schools in the world

96
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,960
are all in his head.

97
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:13,680
Yeah.

98
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,080
I want this man.

99
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,160
Thank you for your hospitality.

100
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,560
But we haven't paid the price yet.

101
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,520
I want it no matter how much it is.

102
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,080
Go away. Don't listen to him.

103
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,640
200 taels.

104
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,960
200 taels.

105
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,600
210 taels.

106
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,280
210 taels.

107
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,880
Aren't we going to Sima Kong?

108
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,080
Why is it so big?

109
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:35,840
Is there more?

110
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:36,720
Listen to me.

111
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,880
210 taels.

112
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,720
I know the mind of a businessman.

113
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,080
When he meets a rival who is richer than him,

114
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,040
he will be happy.

115
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,280
Let them know

116
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,400
what is real and what is not.

117
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,960
But we don't have any money.

118
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,920
You really don't think I'll give them money, do you?

119
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,400
Are you fighting?

120
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,280
What are you talking about?

121
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,480
260 taels.

122
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,840
280 taels.

123
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,000
300 taels.

124
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,280
300...

125
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,160
300 taels.

126
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,560
Is there more?

127
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,280
No matter how much it is,

128
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,320
I'll add one more.

129
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,880
Add one more?

130
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:06,720
Well.

131
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,120
You are really generous.

132
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,400
But

133
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,200
I'm a businessman.

134
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,280
I'm just a businessman.

135
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,120
But you can't live for a few years

136
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,320
if you buy a dirty old man for 300 taels.

137
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,880
I always feel that you are the one who is at loss.

138
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,880
I can't help you.

139
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,360
You said it.

140
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,680
It's the mind that is worth money.

141
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,400
If you can't do it,

142
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,920
just give me a clean one.

143
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,760
You can't do it on the stage.

144
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:33,960
You are not an actor.

145
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,080
Please, sir.

146
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,160
Which one do you like?

147
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:37,880
Which one do you take with you?

148
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,800
It's easy to say.

149
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,520
This one.

150
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,080
How about this one?

151
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:41,680
This one.

152
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,120
Not good.

153
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,240
This one.

154
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,360
This one is young.

155
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,520
It's too thin.

156
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,240
It's dry.

157
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,920
You are not an actor.

158
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,720
I'm not an actor.

159
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,280
Is there any more?

160
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,000
Yes.

161
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:55,720
Yes.

162
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,200
Come on.

163
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:56,960
Please come in.

164
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,400
Sir.

165
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,800
Miss is in the house.

166
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,480
I've sent someone to protect her.

167
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,920
She is hiding it from me on purpose.

168
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,520
Why should I protect her?

169
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,160
But she is your daughter after all.

170
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,520
Only the one who can do everything for me

171
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,280
can be here.

172
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,240
She chose the husband and wife.

173
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,520
She should find the right one.

174
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,360
Sir.

175
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,800
You've been picking for a long time.

176
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,360
You are just a slave.

177
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,440
You can't just take one.

178
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:54,800
Sister.

179
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,400
Sister.

180
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,840
Please save my husband.

181
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:57,960
Go back.

182
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,840
He is tall and thin.

183
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,120
He doesn't look like a man.

184
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,720
But he has a sweet tongue.

185
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,320
It's good to make my wife happy.

186
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,120
That's him.

187
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,000
This old man

188
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,600
wants to use his daughter's marriage contract

189
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,760
to tie up Feiyun.

190
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,240
It's a dream.

191
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,160
Now Ye Mei has a crush on Feiyun.

192
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,200
Should we be careful

193
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,280
and get her back?

194
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,240
I've been trying to lure her here

195
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,760
to get her memories back.

196
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:35,760
I want to catch her.

197
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,320
Why do I have to keep her for so long?

198
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,280
How can I...

199
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,080
Don't be angry, father.

200
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,840
I can't think it over.

201
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,880
How could she keep such a useless girl?

202
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,080
Mr. Xu, please.

203
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,080
If it weren't for your family,

204
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,280
I wouldn't have let you

205
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,080
be satisfied with your marriage.

206
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,680
You are my friend from now on.

207
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,200
Thank you, Mr. Xu.

208
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,320
Sister, they are coming for me.

209
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:09,960
Mr. Xu.

210
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:10,840
Well...

211
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,200
This is the guard of our house.

212
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,160
He is here to pick me up.

213
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,320
Mr. Xu, it seems that

214
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,680
you are very busy.

215
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,120
How about this?

216
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,280
You can do your own work.

217
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,640
Leave these to me.

218
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,800
Leave these two slaves

219
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,480
to me for now.

220
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,760
You can come and pick them up

221
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,960
when you are done.

222
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,480
If you don't have time,

223
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,720
I can send them to your house.

224
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:32,560
What do you think?

225
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,440
Thank you.

226
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,520
It's my duty.

227
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:35,880
It's my duty.

228
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:38,640
Sister.

229
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,200
Mr. Lu, you are so generous.

230
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,280
You let the people of the Supervisory Department

231
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,240
to be your guards.

232
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,320
You can be a little louder.

233
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,960
Let them all out.

234
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,240
You have caught the thief.

235
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,120
The people who were kidnapped

236
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,120
are more than we thought.

237
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,840
It's not a matter of a day

238
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,200
if they do this kind of thing.

239
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,160
It's a life-and-death situation.

240
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,040
Even our friends

241
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,400
were killed.

242
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,160
I will handle the case of the house.

243
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,440
But before that,

244
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,760
please go back with me

245
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,840
and make it clear about the other cases.

246
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,360
Mr. Gu.

247
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,200
Mr. Gu.

248
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,080
If you are doing this

249
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,600
to catch Tian Luo's first death,

250
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,640
I am willing to go back with you.

251
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:30,960
I didn't expect

252
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,120
you would admit it so easily.

253
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,600
The truth will come out sooner or later.

254
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,240
If I had been honest with you earlier,

255
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,960
there wouldn't be such a misunderstanding today.

256
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,480
I lost my memory before.

257
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,680
I only recently found out

258
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,160
that I can go back with you.

259
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,680
The only condition

260
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,960
is to ensure the safety of Lin Lan and Si Ma Kun.

261
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,640
I won't let you go.

262
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,440
There is something wrong with these people.

263
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,640
Catch them.

264
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,400
Hurry up.

265
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,440
Sister, save me.

266
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,960
Sister, save me.

267
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:14,800
Retreat.

268
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,320
Retreat.

269
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:21,760
Brother Lin.

270
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,440
Retreat.

271
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:11,640
Bai Yu.

272
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,000
Bai Yu, what's wrong?

273
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,160
Are you okay?

274
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,120
Sir, I am fine.

275
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,160
I have told you many times.

276
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,840
Girls shouldn't try to push forward.

277
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,840
Don't you know what Lu Jiao was looking for?

278
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,360
It's none of your business.

279
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,080
As long as you are fine.

280
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,240
What's wrong with you?

281
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,400
I don't know why either.

282
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,800
I feel hot.

283
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,840
This is cool.

284
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:38,840
Let's go.

285
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:44,440
Let's go.

286
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,560
Be careful.

287
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:46,760
Let's go.

288
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,360
No one is here.

289
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,120
I feel hot.

290
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:53,800
Hot?

291
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,240
Maybe I just

292
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,080
caught some herbs.

293
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,760
One of them is from the Western Regions.

294
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,760
I don't know the ingredients.

295
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,240
I didn't figure it out.

296
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,640
Let's take a break.

297
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:05,840
Okay.

298
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,080
Let's take a break.

299
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,480
No. What are you doing?

300
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,440
Didn't you say you wanted to take a break?

301
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,920
You need to take off your clothes when you go to bed.

302
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,480
It's a wild place.

303
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,480
Why do you need to take a break?

304
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,560
Take care.

305
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,400
Take a good rest.

306
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,120
Yes.

307
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,920
This is not at home.

308
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,400
But it's good that

309
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,920
you are by my side.

310
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,400
It's so nice to have you by my side.

311
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,680
Do you really think

312
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,600
I'm nice

313
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,120
by your side?

314
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,120
Of course.

315
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,120
I not only think you are nice by my side,

316
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,000
but I also like you.

317
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:45,920
Linglang, what are you doing?

318
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,320
What do you think I'm doing?

319
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:49,720
Linglang,

320
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,120
I'm not a person who can tell the truth.

321
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,480
But I can't take advantage of it.

322
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,720
Besides, my identity

323
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,440
is not a big deal

324
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,600
in the future.

325
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,280
I'm very clear.

326
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:04,880
Linglang,

327
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,480
I can't be like this.

328
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,240
Lu Jiu,

329
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,320
what are you doing?

330
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:14,680
I...

331
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,400
Aren't we in the old house?

332
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,640
Why are we here?

333
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:28,680
You...

334
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,080
You don't remember

335
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,080
what happened just now?

336
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,760
What's so special?

337
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,040
It's good.

338
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,440
I don't want to be confused and go with you.

339
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,880
What are you talking about?

340
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,000
Nothing.

341
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:43,920
I mean,

342
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,440
we are now strangers.

343
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,040
They don't know

344
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,440
how to treat Si Ma Kong.

345
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,720
What are you doing?

346
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,200
Let go of me.

347
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,200
Yes.

348
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:10,920
Tell me.

349
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,400
Where are your friends?

350
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,520
I don't know.

351
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,040
I don't know.

352
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:22,240
I thought you were a good person who can make medicine.

353
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,840
I didn't expect you to catch a scourge.

354
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,320
Sit down.

355
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,120
Priest.

356
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,640
It's a pity to kill him.

357
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,200
I found something on his clothes.

358
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,160
Maybe it can be a bait

359
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,760
to make him think of something useful.

360
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,520
It's not too late to kill him

361
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,120
after finding his accomplice.

362
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,120
Let him go for now.

363
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,160
After we catch him,

364
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,440
we'll kill him.

365
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,040
To vent my anger.

366
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,320
Why aren't you afraid of me?

367
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,720
Your eyes

368
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,000
are the same as that sister's.

369
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,280
You are a good person.

370
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,160
You won't hurt me.

371
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,120
I'm not a good person.

372
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,320
Do you know this object?

373
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,160
That's mine.

374
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,080
Give it back to me.

375
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,280
That's mine.

376
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,760
It seems that this sachet

377
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,080
is very important to you.

378
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:27,880
Ling Lang.

379
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,040
Ling Lang.

380
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,200
Give it back to me.

381
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,440
Ling Lang.

382
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,120
Xu Ling Lang.

383
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,640
The person who is on the assassin alliance list.

384
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:38,920
Sister.

385
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,160
Give it back to me.

386
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,000
Sister.

387
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,120
Give it back to me.

388
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,160
Give it back to me.

389
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,320
Just such a broken sachet.

390
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,520
The person who saved him

391
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,960
also escaped by seducing everyone with the powder.

392
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,400
Maybe he can find clues from the sachet.

393
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,200
You should handle

394
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,120
this little thing.

395
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:05,840
Jinglan.

396
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,680
Miss Hua is our First Valley Master.

397
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,880
These days,

398
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,680
you must not make any mistakes.

399
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,480
I understand.

400
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,560
But

401
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,280
the mountain of lonely has started to ask about the person who is on the assassin alliance list.

402
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,560
I'm afraid that Aunt Xi has already started to suspect us.

403
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,800
You should know

404
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,920
why I raised you.

405
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:33,360
If you can't even do this little thing,

406
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:37,080
don't think about meeting your little brother again.

407
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,640
I understand.

408
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,240
I will definitely solve this matter for you.

409
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,280
I won't let you worry.

410
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,120
You may leave.

411
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:45,800
Yes.

412
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,080
Brother.

413
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,800
Don't worry.

414
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,920
I will definitely

415
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,720
get you out of the guest's hands.

416
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,760
I'm just a useless person.

417
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,360
You don't care about me.

418
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,240
I'm just a useless person.

419
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,560
I'm just a useless person.

420
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,760
I'm just a useless person.

421
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,000
I'm just a useless person.

422
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,160
Although the person who killed my father is Tian Luo,

423
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,560
you were once a member of Tian Luo.

424
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,480
But you've been out of their hands for the past seven years.

425
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,480
In my eyes,

426
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,600
you are Lu Jiu, not Fei Ying.

427
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,880
You really don't mind?

428
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,320
Just like where we were born,

429
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,040
we can't choose.

430
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:52,040
Now that I'm giving you a chance to make you choose again,

431
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,240
you must live the life you want.

432
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,640
Linglang.

433
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,440
What are you thinking about?

434
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,080
Nothing.

435
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:08,640
Really?

436
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,600
Yes.

437
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,280
Lu Jiu,

438
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,960
are you hiding something from me again?

439
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,520
I really have nothing to hide from you.

440
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,360
If I keep it from you,

441
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,560
I'll be in a big trouble.

442
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,400
Why are you making such a serious matter?

443
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,000
You two look like newlyweds.

444
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,560
I have all kinds of jewelry here.

445
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,760
I'll give some to you.

446
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,800
What are you talking about?

447
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,320
We are not a couple.

448
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,760
We are not a couple.

449
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,200
Why are you laughing?

450
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,960
I just think

451
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:42,600
we haven't been out like this for a long time.

452
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,840
It's nice to be like before.

453
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,400
You still say you are not a couple.

454
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,120
Look at you two.

455
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,320
Even if you are not married,

456
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,360
you must be a single.

457
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,000
What single?

458
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,160
That's not true.

459
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,520
It must be the gap between the window and the window.

460
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:01,920
I have

461
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,560
some fragrant powder from the Western Regions.

462
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,000
When you buy it,

463
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,720
you will feel like you are dreaming

464
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,600
when you smell it.

465
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,760
Fragrant powder?

466
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,760
I like you.

467
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,160
Miss.

468
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:24,760
Li La.

469
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,760
Do you want it?

470
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,520
Li La, don't be shy.

471
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,560
Last night...

472
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,200
Last night, I didn't blame you.

473
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,640
Actually, I...

474
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,880
Li La, are you okay?

475
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,920
Don't be so nervous.

476
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:38,920
I'm fine.

477
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,320
Didn't you see that my goods were ruined?

478
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,760
You still have the heart to ask me if I'm okay?

479
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,320
I'm sorry.

480
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,560
I didn't see it clearly just now.

481
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,440
You didn't see it clearly?

482
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,840
You have a sharp eye.

483
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:47,880
What sharp eye?

484
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:48,760
How much is it?

485
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,520
I'll pay you.

486
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,200
You...

487
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,200
Enough.

488
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:53,840
Miss Xing'er.

489
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,800
This lady is also heartless.

490
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,520
The weather is dry these days.

491
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,880
The ground is a little muddy.

492
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,400
Remove the dirtiest part.

493
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,800
It won't affect our sale.

494
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,800
Yes.

495
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,520
Thank you for your help.

496
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,520
But today is indeed my fault.

497
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,800
Although I don't have much money,

498
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,360
it's still a token of my love.

499
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,920
It's no big deal.

500
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,440
My father told me since I was a child

501
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,680
that I should be responsible for my own affairs.

502
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,080
You should take it.

503
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,080
Linglong.

504
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,080
Since you don't take it,

505
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,360
you're forcing yourself to give it to her.

506
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,760
It's like a private fishing.

507
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,920
How about this?

508
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,320
Let's go in and buy something.

509
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:42,720
So that Miss Xing'er can rest assured when she takes the money.

510
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,720
Let's go.

511
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,440
Tell me.

512
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,920
What's your new plan?

513
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,040
You know me better.

514
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,200
Since you entered the house,

515
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,200
you've been calling that Miss Xing'er.

516
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,560
You must have noticed something wrong with her.

517
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,760
Maybe I'm just being selfish.

518
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,760
You're not like that.

519
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,760
That's true.

520
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:13,120
Last night, there was a pretty girl

521
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,720
who had a bad feeling about me.

522
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,200
Luckily, I held on to her.

523
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,280
It seems that I'm a real gentleman.

524
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,800
You're still talking about this?

525
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,360
Okay, let's get serious.

526
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,120
I found the scent of the sachet of Sima Gong

527
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,880
on her.

528
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,960
You mean

529
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,960
she's on the same team with those people?

530
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,000
It's possible.

531
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:47,480
And the silk

532
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,320
that fell to the ground just now

533
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,280
was stepped on by her.

534
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,560
So the silk and the coffin

535
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,960
are the places where they exchange information.

536
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,960
Have you two picked out the clothes?

537
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,240
The cloths here are so beautiful.

538
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,760
Why don't you recommend me one?

539
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,560
This girl is so beautiful.

540
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:07,560
The colorful flowers don't suit you.

541
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,760
But this one

542
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,560
is simple and elegant.

543
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,760
It suits you well.

544
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,160
You run such a big silk shop.

545
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,760
Why did you embroider it yourself?

546
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,760
You even made a lot of thorns.

547
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,960
I'm also from a poor family.

548
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,160
I saved some money from this shop.

549
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,560
Of course, I can save some money.

550
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,960
The real silk

551
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,960
should be paid by paper.

552
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,360
And your silk

553
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,760
is at the mouth of the lake.

554
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,360
It's like a whip that you use all the time.

555
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,760
This shop is so strange.

556
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,360
Why don't they close the shop

557
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,760
and do business in the daytime?

558
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:49,960
In a few days,

559
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,760
I want to find an excuse to hang around.

560
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,760
Sir.

561
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,760
You know too much.

562
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,360
I won't let you two get out alive.

563
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,160
You won't.

564
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,160
Just now, before I entered the shop,

565
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,560
I saw the water and food of the stray cats

566
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:04,160
at the door of the silk shop.

567
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,960
You can do everything you want.

568
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,960
People who can come to this kind of shop

569
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:08,960
are all rich and noble.

570
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,360
They hate wild cats and dogs the most.

571
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,560
And you even adopted them.

572
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,760
Besides, you were just

573
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:13,960
being righteous at the door.

574
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:16,360
I can tell that you're not a bad person.

575
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,160
Do you think I'll let you go just because you do this?

576
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:18,960
A person's image of a person

577
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,760
will be affected by the living environment.

578
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,560
Although you're beautiful,

579
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,560
you're still a former wife.

580
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,360
It can be seen that you often

581
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,560
turn the evil into the good.

582
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,960
You're being bullied.

583
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,160
Who are you?

584
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,560
It doesn't matter who we are.

585
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,360
What matters is that

586
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,360
we can let those innocent people

587
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,360
regain their freedom and reunite with their families.

588
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:40,760
Oh no.

589
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,360
I won't kill you this time.

590
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,160
But don't let me see you again.

591
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,160
Everyone has their own fate.

592
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,360
Don't worry about the reality.

593
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,160
But...

594
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,560
They went out that way.

595
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,360
Go after them.

596
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,360
Go after them.

597
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,560
Will it be dangerous

598
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,960
if he let us go?

599
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,160
I don't think so.

600
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,760
He's in a bad position.

601
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,360
There will be a way to solve it.

602
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,360
But

603
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,760
the intention of our rescue

604
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,160
is too obvious.

605
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,760
We have to find a way to act as soon as possible.

606
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,760
I got it.

607
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:37,720
The silk

608
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,760
You're lucky.

609
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:44,960
Someone can come to save you.

610
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,760
Who can come to save me?

611
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,560
Who can come to save me?

612
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,560
Who can come to save me?

613
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,560
Who can come to save me?

614
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:53,560
Who can come to save me?

615
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,560
Who can come to save me?

616
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,560
Who can come to save me?

617
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,560
Who can come to save me?

618
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,560
Who can come to save me?

619
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,560
Who can come to save me?

620
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,560
Who can come to save me?

621
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,560
Who can come to save me?

622
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,560
Who can come to save me?

623
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,560
Who can come to save me?

624
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,560
Who can come to save me?

625
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,560
Who can come to save me?

626
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,560
Who can come to save me?

627
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,560
Who can come to save me?

628
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,560
Who can come to save me?

629
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,560
Who can come to save me?

630
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,560
Who can come to save me?

631
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,560
Who can come to save me?

632
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,560
Who can come to save me?

633
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,560
Who can come to save me?

634
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,560
Who can come to save me?

635
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,560
Who can come to save me?

636
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,560
Who can come to save me?

637
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,560
Who can come to save me?

638
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,560
Who can come to save me?

639
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,560
Who can come to save me?

640
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,560
Who can come to save me?

641
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,560
Who can come to save me?

642
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,560
Who can come to save me?

643
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,560
Who can come to save me?

644
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,560
Who can come to save me?

645
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,560
Who can come to save me?

646
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,560
Who can come to save me?

647
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,560
Who can come to save me?

648
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,560
Who can come to save me?

649
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,560
Who can come to save me?

650
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,560
Who can come to save me?

651
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,560
Who can come to save me?

652
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,560
Who can come to save me?

653
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,560
Who can come to save me?

654
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,560
Who can come to save me?

655
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,560
Who can come to save me?

656
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,560
Who can come to save me?

657
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,560
Who can come to save me?

658
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,560
Who can come to save me?

659
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,560
I found it.

660
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,560
Master.

661
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,560
Xing'er has been acting strangely lately.

662
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,560
You must be careful.

663
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,560
You just have to keep an eye on him.

664
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,560
He doesn't have a guardian's document.

665
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,560
He can't escape from the fog formation.

666
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,560
Moreover,

667
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:01,560
he always thinks that his brother

668
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,560
is still in the dark.

669
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:05,560
He is not a good person.

670
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,560
He is not a good person.

671
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,560
He is not a good person.

672
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,560
I still have the document.

673
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,560
I still have the document.

674
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,560
He will never betray me.

675
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,560
He will never betray me.

676
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,560
He is smart.

677
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,560
He never thought of it in his dreams.

678
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,560
In fact, that little bastard

679
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,560
died a few years ago

680
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,560
in a hospital.

681
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,560
If he really found something strange,

682
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,560
you can replace him.

683
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,560
Thank you, Master.

684
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,560
Then, Xing'er...

685
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,560
I think Xing'er

686
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,560
is a little bit under the skin.

687
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,560
I think Xing'er is a little bit under the skin.

688
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,560
If you go to the brothel,

689
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,560
you may be able to get a good price.

690
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,560
Master, I have been with you for so many years.

691
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,560
I haven't tasted the taste of women.

692
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,560
Before I sell Xing'er to the brothel,

693
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,560
can I...

694
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,560
How dare you!

695
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,560
Master, please forgive me.

696
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,560
Don't be afraid.

697
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,560
It's not impossible

698
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,560
to give her to you.

699
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,560
Thank you, Master.

700
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,560
Master.

701
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,560
Master, you are hit by a target.

702
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,560
I got it.

703
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,560
Here, here.

704
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,560
This...

705
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,560
What should I do?

706
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,560
You two.

707
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,560
Who are you?

708
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,560
You saved us.

709
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:51,560
Come with me.

710
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,560
Miss Xu has arranged everything.

711
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,560
There is no news from the Taoist temple.

712
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,560
It's good that you are able to frame us.

713
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,560
It's good that you are able to frame us.

714
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,560
It's my duty.

715
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,560
You hate it when people are gossiping.

716
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,560
Sima Kong, we love you so much.

717
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,560
We love you so much.

718
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,560
We love you so much.

719
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,560
We love you so much.

720
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,560
We love you so much.

721
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,560
We love you so much.

722
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,560
We love you so much.

723
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,560
Sima Kong is such a clean person.

724
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,560
Now he is locked in that place.

725
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,560
It's really hard for him.

726
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,560
If he had listened to me earlier,

727
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,560
he wouldn't have fallen into such a situation.

728
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,560
Sima Kong was arrested for a few days.

729
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:52,560
Lin Lang and I haven't revealed the news yet.

730
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,560
You can come and save people right away.

731
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,560
Who are you?

732
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,560
Does this have anything to do with you saving him?

733
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,560
Yes.

734
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,560
I don't care about his identity.

735
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,560
Now, he is my friend.

736
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,560
I will risk my life to save him.

737
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,560
Looks like my young master has a good taste.

738
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:17,560
I am just taking the man's father with a mean heart.

739
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,560
I can see that you are very good to him.

740
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,560
You are friends too, right?

741
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,560
I dare not say that I am your friend.

742
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,560
I am just his servant.

743
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,560
Although you look like a giant,

744
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,560
you are actually kind-hearted.

745
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:32,560
You have never been harsh on me in all these years.

746
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,560
I am just repaying your kindness.

747
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,560
By the way,

748
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,560
is that plan feasible?

749
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,560
According to the news I got,

750
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,560
the person who will be trading with me tomorrow

751
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,560
is the eldest daughter of the ancient man of Shanxi,

752
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,560
Hua Jin Shen.

753
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,560
No one has seen her true face.

754
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,560
I told them to stop them.

755
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:53,560
Those bandits probably won't be able to escape.

756
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,560
You are right.

757
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,560
But,

758
00:31:56,560 --> 00:32:01,560
it is indeed hard for Lin Lang to get a big family back.

759
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,560
Who said it is hard for me?

760
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,560
Look.

761
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,560
The red thread is entangled in my palm.

762
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,560
My arms are empty.

763
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:03,560
We are like a film that is hard to be taken.

764
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,560
The moon is like a gentle breeze.

765
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:10,560
Why does it look like moonlight?

766
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,560
I am just like the moon.

767
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:15,560
It is also night.

768
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:18,560
You are in the depth of the world.

769
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:21,560
Like the blooming of the flowers.

770
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:26,560
The heart is written on the paper.

771
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:32,560
In the dream, I am a man in my life.

772
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:38,560
In the dream, I am a man in my life.

773
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:44,560
I will never forget you for the rest of my life.

774
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:49,560
I have no fear in the mountains and rivers.

775
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:55,560
In the dream, I am a man in my life.

776
00:33:55,560 --> 00:34:01,560
In the dream, I am a man in my life.

777
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,560
If we can meet again,

778
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:07,560
how will it be?

779
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:16,560
Thank you for looking back at the past with a single glance.

780
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:24,560
Thank you for watching.
