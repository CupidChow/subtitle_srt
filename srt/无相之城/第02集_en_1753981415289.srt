00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Episode 18

3
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,720
Xu Lin

4
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,360
made Mr. Lu Jiu in the court

5
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,000
I'm not a god

6
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,600
I'm not a god

7
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,480
Well

8
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,400
Don't worry, my lord

9
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,360
There are so many eyes staring at the painting room

10
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,920
It's actually letting him go

11
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,200
that will cause suspicion

12
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,720
If we settle the matter in the court

13
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,440
it will show your power

14
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,560
Then the Lu family will be happy

15
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,720
You are so thoughtful

16
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,320
No, no, no

17
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,000
You are so wise

18
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,440
Let's go

19
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,320
Let's go

20
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,520
Court

21
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,000
I, Sheng Tang, have a complaint

22
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,800
My lord

23
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,240
Miss Lin

24
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,960
asked me to cook ginseng soup for her

25
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,640
Everyone in the painting room knows

26
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,640
Lu Jiu always comes to find Miss Lin

27
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,720
That ginseng is sent by Lu Jiu

28
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,000
There is also private affection here

29
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,640
My lord

30
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,800
When I sent ginseng soup to Miss Lin

31
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,480
they seemed to quarrel because of something

32
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,720
Thank you, Mr. Lu

33
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:37,320
I will serve you well in this life

34
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,360
No need

35
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,840
Your life is yours

36
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,680
Take your pulse

37
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,600
My lord

38
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,720
She is lying

39
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,600
Li'er

40
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,720
My Li'er

41
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,760
The court is in a hurry

42
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:05,680
Go

43
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,080
My lord

44
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,320
If I can disprove the autopsy

45
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,000
I will find out the murderer

46
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,520
Disprove?

47
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,920
That's to report to the government office

48
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,160
Disprove

49
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,400
I must

50
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,680
If I can find out something

51
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,880
I will be unable to operate

52
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,080
If you can find out something

53
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,320
and you can operate

54
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,240
it will make you a talented man

55
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,600
By then

56
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,160
I will be rewarded

57
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,280
But I have a condition

58
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,680
If I can be proven innocent

59
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:05,000
Xu Linglang must apologize to me in public

60
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,680
He is in pain and has no external injury

61
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,080
He has nothing to say

62
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,480
Miss Li'er, I'm sorry

63
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,120
My lord, when can I come back?

64
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,240
The painting and painting workshop

65
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,560
can't be separated from me

66
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,080
Shut up

67
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,040
In order to avoid collusion

68
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,840
you three can't be together

69
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,600
I consider you as a father

70
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,440
so I allow you to be in the court

71
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,640
They

72
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,280
don't have a better life than you

73
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,600
You don't know?

74
00:05:53,400 --> 00:06:15,860
I just 깨

75
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:18,100
The murderer of the painting workshop

76
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,820
is going to be executed.

77
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,980
You two, please sign it.

78
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:23,100
Okay.

79
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,200
Twisted Nails

80
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:52,580
That's what happened.

81
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,140
Looks like the monster has taken the painting.

82
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:04,660
I can't

83
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:07,020
feel relieved没有產生什么 stiffness

84
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:07,540
Momo.

85
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:08,500
Let's go.

86
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:10,820
Where are we going?

87
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:12,100
The prison, of course.

88
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:14,140
You both filled watches out.

89
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,380
You were the murderer.

90
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:16,380
They're talking nonsense.

91
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,740
They did it.

92
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:21,620
Your Grace.

93
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,980
These two are the remains of the ginseng soup

94
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,260
found in Ling'er's stomach.

95
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,820
The other one was found in the back yard of the painting studio.

96
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,820
They are exactly the same.

97
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,820
The ginseng soup is poisonous.

98
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:37,540
No.

99
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,420
The ginseng soup is so precious.

100
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,460
Why did they throw it away if it wasn't poisonous?

101
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,180
It's obvious that the cook is guilty.

102
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:46,020
If she poisoned it directly,

103
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,180
it would be easy to be discovered.

104
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,140
So,

105
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:49,940
she must have a accomplice.

106
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:55,180
Ling'er has been visiting the painting studio for many years.

107
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,580
She bought the items

108
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:57,340
by the news of the fire.

109
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:00,340
Recently, she often felt a headache

110
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:01,820
and went out to buy medicine.

111
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:03,100
Today,

112
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:04,900
she suddenly found the medicine.

113
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,540
The medicine is poisonous.

114
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:11,900
The ginseng soup and the ginseng soup are very similar.

115
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:13,100
They are not poisonous.

116
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,780
But the ginseng soup and ginseng soup are consumed at the same time.

117
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:16,980
It can cause a lot of poison.

118
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:20,580
So,

119
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:23,660
the cook and the cook are both partners.

120
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:26,220
I'm at most a person who knows nothing.

121
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:27,500
Right, Your Grace?

122
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,260
You didn't kill anyone yourself,

123
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,620
but you are the culprit.

124
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,340
They both confessed.

125
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:34,580
You took Ling'er's money

126
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:37,060
and wanted to take the money she had accumulated for years.

127
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:40,140
That's why you asked them to commit the murder.

128
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:44,980
They are both liars.

129
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,540
I should have killed them myself

130
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:48,220
and not have so many goods.

131
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:49,980
You have been running the painting studio for many years

132
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:50,860
and made so much money.

133
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:52,060
Why do you want to take the money

134
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:53,660
of a poor woman?

135
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,020
A poor woman?

136
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,620
I'm not a poor woman.

137
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,620
I just want to be alone

138
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:08,580
with my beloved one for the rest of my life.

139
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:09,220
No.

140
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:11,460
I did

141
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:13,820
do this alone.

142
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,460
I only did it for someone else.

143
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:18,940
I

144
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,060
am willing to be punished.

145
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,380
Chen Xiang, Da Bai.

146
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:34,660
Take her away.

147
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:35,300
Yes.

148
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:39,860
He is a thief.

149
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:40,980
He is a thief.

150
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,180
Mr. Lu Jiu, you are not guilty.

151
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:49,580
You are being punished.

152
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:50,940
Please,

153
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:51,780
Mr. Lu.

154
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:57,580
Dear friends,

155
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:58,500
dear fathers,

156
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:00,340
I am Xu Lin Lang, the coroner of the Yamen.

157
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,300
I wronged Mr. Lu Jiu yesterday.

158
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:04,340
I am apologizing to him.

159
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:05,660
Please accept my apology.

160
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:07,700
Please accept my apology.

161
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:08,700
You are not finished yet?

162
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:10,260
Of course I am not.

163
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,580
You haven't forgiven me yet.

164
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:12,700
You rich people

165
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:13,740
are the most important.

166
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:14,900
I will kneel down and apologize to you.

167
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,140
Can't I accept your apology?

168
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:20,660
All right.

169
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:21,580
Let's go.

170
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:22,540
Let's go.

171
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:23,500
You are a girl.

172
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,980
You are chasing a boy on the street.

173
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:26,180
Aren't you afraid of losing your reputation?

174
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,140
The truth is the biggest.

175
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:30,020
The truth has nothing to do with sex.

176
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:31,460
Just now in the hall,

177
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:32,620
you were like me.

178
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:34,180
You saw that the Knight's Head was wrong.

179
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,020
That's why you helped me.

180
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:37,940
I was

181
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:39,260
a man of my word.

182
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:41,380
I know.

183
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:43,140
You are like

184
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,540
Tang Xuan Zong Li Chen in the novel.

185
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:45,620
You pretend to be a fool

186
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,700
and make your people relax.

187
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:48,940
You are planning a big business.

188
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,340
I didn't mean to betray anyone.

189
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,260
I was right.

190
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:53,860
I warn you.

191
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,020
You can't tell anyone

192
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:56,860
about this.

193
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,460
I almost forgot.

194
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:03,940
You must be hungry

195
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:04,820
after staying in the Yamen for a day.

196
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:05,940
I'll invite you to my house for dinner.

197
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,220
I'll apologize to you.

198
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,140
Your house?

199
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:20,900
Why is there a quilt in the coffin?

200
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,340
That's my bed.

201
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:24,260
Alright, stop staring.

202
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:24,980
Let's eat.

203
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:26,700
Come on.

204
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:27,900
Sit down.

205
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:32,540
Don't stare.

206
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:33,220
Sit down.

207
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:35,380
Come on.

208
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,260
Sit down.

209
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,300
There are spices over there.

210
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:49,980
How could you know they are surrounding spices?

211
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,340
You are a shanty.

212
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:52,620
You are an expert in spices.

213
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,020
They belong to my father.

214
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:55,700
In those beloved laughable names,

215
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,420
my father used to make me someintestine

216
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:59,780
to get rid of mould.

217
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:03,380
Father.

218
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:05,100
And my father?

219
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:07,380
He's been out for the whole night.

220
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:09,860
He even brought a man home.

221
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,380
What are you talking about?

222
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:13,300
Dad, let me introduce you.

223
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,260
He's Lu Jiu.

224
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:15,860
I almost wronged him yesterday.

225
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,860
So I brought him home for dinner.

226
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:18,860
I'll take it as my apology.

227
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:20,940
Lu Jiu?

228
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:24,460
The famous playboy?

229
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,420
He's not a playboy.

230
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:27,420
He's a good man.

231
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,140
A good man would come home

232
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,660
for breakfast regardless of your reputation.

233
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,260
I'm sorry for my rudeness.

234
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,780
Dad, he's here.

235
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:37,020
Don't say so much.

236
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:40,180
Come on.

237
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:41,100
Sit down.

238
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,300
Lu Jiu, don't be shy.

239
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:45,860
Let's eat.

240
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:53,860
By the way,

241
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,100
go to the fridge

242
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,500
and bring me that phoenix claw.

243
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,620
Put it next to the finger

244
00:12:58,620 --> 00:12:59,780
that we took the evidence

245
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:01,100
from the East Village a few days ago.

246
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:02,380
Hurry up.

247
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:02,900
Okay.

248
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:04,620
Hey.

249
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:06,460
Mr. Lu,

250
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,020
you don't know

251
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,980
well

252
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:11,620
the human fingers

253
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:12,420
such as crevice,

254
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:26,940
officer케,

255
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:31,660
Where's he?

256
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:34,620
I was going to treat you to a meal.

257
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,620
I didn't expect you to be so hungry.

258
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,340
Ice sugar gourd.

259
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:40,660
There's ice sugar gourd over there.

260
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:41,820
Ice sugar gourd is the best.

261
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:42,460
Wait.

262
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,660
I'll go buy it for you right now.

263
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:44,900
Ice sugar gourd.

264
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,220
What about the ice sugar gourd?

265
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:48,340
One yuan.

266
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:50,060
Here.

267
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,220
Thank you.

268
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,300
Isn't this the work of a great man

269
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,260
who doesn't care about his power?

270
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:56,980
What's wrong?

271
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,460
You said it before.

272
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:01,100
Now you're going to be a concubine to Childe Lu?

273
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,380
I'm not going to be a concubine.

274
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,860
You're going to be a concubine?

275
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:05,540
People with dirty minds

276
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:06,700
look at everything dirty.

277
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:07,740
You're not worthy.

278
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,660
You don't deserve to look at yourself in the mirror.

279
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:10,940
You're not worthy of...

280
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:11,940
Childe Lu.

281
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:12,540
Lin Langshou, my friend.

282
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:13,420
Do you have a word with him?

283
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:15,380
Excuse me.

284
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:18,380
Perfect match.

285
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:26,140
The light is so bright.

286
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,260
Don't you hate it when

287
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:28,820
you're in contact with others?

288
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:30,380
I...

289
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:31,420
I can't

290
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:33,260
watch others bully my friend.

291
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:35,300
We're friends?

292
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:38,620
Others dislike me.

293
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,180
I've never had any friends since I was a kid.

294
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,500
Then you're like me.

295
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:45,140
Since I got hurt seven years ago,

296
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,660
I can't remember a lot of things.

297
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,140
Not only friends,

298
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:51,540
even my family feels unfamiliar.

299
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:54,540
I, Lin Lang, am grateful to you.

300
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:55,940
I never drag you down.

301
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:56,620
Lu Jiong,

302
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:58,180
you're my best friend from now on.

303
00:14:58,820 --> 00:14:59,660
I'm sorry.

304
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:00,540
I'm sorry.

305
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:01,460
I'm sorry.

306
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:02,460
I'm sorry.

307
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:03,460
I'm sorry.

308
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,460
I'm sorry.

309
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:05,460
I'm sorry.

310
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:06,460
I'm sorry.

311
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:07,460
I'm sorry.

312
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:08,460
I'm sorry.

313
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:09,460
I'm sorry.

314
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:10,460
I'm sorry.

315
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:11,460
I'm sorry.

316
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:12,460
I'm sorry.

317
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:13,460
I'm sorry.

318
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:14,460
I'm sorry.

319
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:15,460
I'm sorry.

320
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:16,460
I'm sorry.

321
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:17,460
I'm sorry.

322
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:18,460
I'm sorry.

323
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:19,460
I'm sorry.

324
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,460
I'm sorry.

325
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,460
I'm sorry.

326
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:22,460
I'm sorry.

327
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:23,460
I'm sorry.

328
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:24,460
I'm sorry.

329
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:25,460
I'm sorry.

330
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:26,460
I'm sorry.

331
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:27,460
I'm sorry.

332
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,460
I'm sorry.

333
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:29,780
I'm sorry.

334
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:34,380
No

335
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:37,180
Good one.

336
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:38,540
Lu Jiong's MBage

337
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:39,740
is not like that of the Lu family.

338
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:41,100
But is she a virgin?

339
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,660
It's normal for her to wear a sword.

340
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:46,660
It's not done for now.

341
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:48,860
Yes

342
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:50,540
I'll go back now to report to the head.

343
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,940
I'm not investigating Lu Jiong for now.

344
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:54,260
The real clue

345
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:56,220
should be on Lu Mingcheng.

346
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:57,820
What about Lu Kun?

347
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:59,620
According to my investigation,

348
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,340
Lu Kun handed all his business

349
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,420
to his eldest son, Lu Mingcheng.

350
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,780
He has never been in the city

351
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:07,060
and never showed up.

352
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:08,940
Seven years ago,

353
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:11,500
it was rumored that the first assassin of Tian Luo, Fei Ye,

354
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,420
found the clue of the Five-Faith Treasures.

355
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,220
Then he set up the trap in the material formation.

356
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,820
Lu Kun was also in the material formation.

357
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:20,660
Was it a coincidence?

358
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:22,260
How is the next preparation

359
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:24,260
for the young master?

360
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:30,460
The Five-Faith Treasures

361
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:52,060
Peach blossoms smell so good.

362
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,500
According to the script,

363
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:55,820
Young Master,

364
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,580
are you thinking about

365
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:58,740
the female dancer?

366
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:02,820
I've been in various art forms.

367
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,700
How can I be so easily moved?

368
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:08,060
You're used to the wedding, right?

369
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:09,780
You'll think about

370
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:11,700
the side dishes you made yourself.

371
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,140
Nonsense.

372
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:15,660
Young Master,

373
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,500
I just want to remind you

374
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:18,820
that our study

375
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:21,820
has many books about the theory of the case.

376
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,860
You can use them to show your good fortune.

377
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:28,500
Are you free?

378
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,100
Go back to work.

379
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:35,460
Zuo Yin.

380
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:37,820
He's still in the study.

381
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,860
The Book of Theory

382
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:08,300
I...

383
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:09,900
I'm here to find the book.

384
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:13,580
Men

385
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,820
should have a small vault behind their wives.

386
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:17,980
I just found it

387
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,180
before you came in.

388
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,420
And you found it here.

389
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:22,220
It seems that

390
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:23,340
I should hide it

391
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:24,420
to make it look more solid.

392
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:27,740
Where is the book

393
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,340
in Zuo Yin's resting room?

394
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:33,980
In your brother's hand,

395
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:37,060
why did you marry that woman?

396
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:41,100
I but I realized that

397
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,780
you don't like your sister-in-law very much.

398
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:44,640
Maybe

399
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:46,180
you're worried that

400
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:47,660
you'll bring shame to me.

401
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:50,900
We're brothers.

402
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,300
After you got married,

403
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:54,060
I still treat you well.

404
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:55,340
I'm not.

405
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:56,780
By the way,

406
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:59,780
I heard that you were caught in a case last night

407
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:01,540
and suffered a night in the yard.

408
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:02,740
I'm fine now.

409
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:03,820
I've checked it.

410
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:05,500
It won't affect your marriage.

411
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:07,300
It doesn't matter.

412
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:08,700
What I'm worried about is

413
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,740
if you're okay.

414
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:13,060
Go back and have a rest.

415
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,300
If you want to read,

416
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,500
I'll ask the butler to send you there.

417
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:18,500
Go ahead.

418
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:20,260
Thank you, brother.

419
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:24,900
Go away.

420
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,060
and love.

421
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:19,460
Young Master,

422
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:20,820
what are you doing here?

423
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:21,940
Where is my brother?

424
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:23,820
Young Master went to the painting workshop.

425
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:25,580
She is discussing about the wedding.

426
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:27,820
She asked me to send the dowry to Miss Wan.

427
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:29,900
Give it to me.

428
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:33,220
You may go.

429
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,180
Yes, Young Master.

430
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,500
Although I don't like that woman,

431
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:42,060
she is

432
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,780
my brother's life-long priority.

433
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:46,900
As her younger brother,

434
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:48,500
I should take responsibility.

435
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:54,900
I'm sorry.

436
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:57,700
Lu Jiu is so mean to me.

437
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:58,580
You saw her.

438
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,740
She doesn't like me.

439
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:03,500
Lian'er is dead.

440
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:05,220
Why do you mention her?

441
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:06,420
What about Lu Jiu?

442
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,660
He is just a business man.

443
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:11,820
He came back to ask for the dowry.

444
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:13,540
He has a lot of property.

445
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,980
Do you want to share it with him?

446
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,220
We are brothers.

447
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:18,500
For so many years,

448
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:19,820
Jiu has never

449
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:21,900
wanted to take away my property.

450
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:23,740
I will take good care of her.

451
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:25,340
I will take good care of her.

452
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,180
Don't think I don't know

453
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:31,060
what you are up to in the background.

454
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:34,180
You have secretly found Ling'er before.

455
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:34,780
Shut up.

456
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,940
If you want to marry into the Lu family,

457
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,860
shut up.

458
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:48,700
Brother.

459
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:49,380
Brother.

460
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:54,860
I... I'm here to

461
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,900
give sister-in-law a gift.

462
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:05,220
Your sister-in-law has finished her work.

463
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:06,620
No matter what,

464
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:09,180
I will always be your brother.

465
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:20,940
How do you get on my brother's申意?

466
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:22,100
But

467
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:24,260
let me warn you.

468
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:25,760
Don't try to

469
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,340
betray the friendship between us, brothers.

470
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:30,100
In the past,

471
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,260
you made me bricks.

472
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:34,420
And I also視 you as favorable person.

473
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,300
Now you don't even know

474
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:37,060
how to appreciate people.

475
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:39,220
I don't even know

476
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:41,660
who is good or bad to find in your eyes.

477
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,420
Another to do what is good

478
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:46,820
in your life.

479
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:48,020
you can't even tell.

480
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:49,900
What do you mean?

481
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:51,660
I mean...

482
00:22:58,340 --> 00:22:59,340
I mean

483
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:00,860
in this world,

484
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,860
only I love you.

485
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:06,980
I did everything for you.

486
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:08,540
I'll disappear

487
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:10,940
if you say a word.

488
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:13,940
You're not

489
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,820
worthy of my brother.

490
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:17,660
Shh.

491
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:21,060
Don't blame me then.

492
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:23,380
Even if I destroy

493
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:24,620
what I can't get,

494
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,580
I won't let him live in peace.

495
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:28,980
What are you doing?

496
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:30,660
Help!

497
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:32,300
Help!

498
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,180
Help!

499
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:33,860
What's wrong?

500
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,820
She's ignoring me.

501
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:37,700
Help! She's ignoring me.

502
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:42,460
Chen.

503
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:44,100
Why did you do that?

504
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:45,300
It's wrong.

505
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:47,660
Help!

506
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,300
I heard that

507
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:55,900
you and Lu Jiu

508
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:58,220
were fighting on the street

509
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:59,300
and hugging each other.

510
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:00,740
How could you be so polite?

511
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,180
What are you talking about?

512
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:04,060
I've had no friends since I was a kid.

513
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:05,380
Lu Jiu has no friends either.

514
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:06,740
He doesn't dislike me.

515
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:08,100
We're brothers now.

516
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,500
What brother?

517
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:12,940
You're a daughter.

518
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:13,860
Don't you know that?

519
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:17,100
I've put you in a lot of trouble.

520
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:20,300
It's so hard for you to get married.

521
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:22,100
I don't want to get married anyway.

522
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:23,460
Even if I get married,

523
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:25,140
I'll still have to continue to investigate the case.

524
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:27,860
Don't talk about getting married first.

525
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:29,660
Just because I'm making friends,

526
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:31,580
the Lu family is a big family.

527
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:33,020
How can he tolerate

528
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,140
a coroner

529
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:36,340
having a relationship with their young master?

530
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,500
Just because I'm a coroner,

531
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,780
can't you make friends with me?

532
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:39,940
What's wrong with coroner?

533
00:24:44,060 --> 00:25:06,700
Navaltree

534
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:07,740
My lord.

535
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:09,260
My lord, my lord.

536
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:10,580
My lord, are you okay?

537
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:12,060
Go away!

538
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:16,060
I really only see the new people laughing.

539
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:20,100
I don't see the old people crying.

540
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:23,300
In this world,

541
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:26,020
no one cares about me.

542
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:45,500
I, Xu Linglang, am very grateful.

543
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,940
I never liked to drag you into trouble.

544
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:48,540
From now on, you are my best friend.

545
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:50,340
No.

546
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:53,540
I still have a friend.

547
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:15,300
Get up presently.

548
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:17,380
Every girl and guy termebs

549
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:20,620
is extremely mathematical.

550
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:22,180
ALIEN

551
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,300
is very fresh.

552
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:31,500
Get up here.

553
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,700
I'm your friend.

554
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:35,460
Are you a рассказ?

555
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:36,260
аже

556
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:38,420
You...

557
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:41,460
I'm your friend.

558
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:43,100
I'm your friend.

559
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:44,860
in the coffin.

560
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:45,660
This time,

561
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:47,420
there is a real murder case.

562
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:48,420
Dad.

563
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:15,860
Lu Mingcheng is dead?

564
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:16,860
He died suddenly.

565
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:18,860
Lu Jiu was caught on the spot.

566
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:19,860
He has been arrested.

567
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:20,860
But the news was blocked.

568
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:21,860
He was dead.

569
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:22,860
We can't find anything.

570
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:25,860
If Lu Jiu killed him,

571
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:29,860
it's not a good thing.

572
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:45,860
When I came in,

573
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:47,860
the body was lying on the bed.

574
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:49,860
No.

575
00:27:58,860 --> 00:27:59,860
Who is that person?

576
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:02,860
I was watching at the door.

577
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:03,860
Who locked the door?

578
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:09,860
Who is it?

579
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:10,860
Who is it?

580
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:14,860
Where is he?

581
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:15,860
What is he doing?

582
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,860
Someone thousand嘛...?

583
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:18,860
The place where Lu Jiu is?

584
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:23,860
Nothing happened.

585
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:24,540
I heard that

586
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:25,860
there are some breaking up with Lu Jiu.

587
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:26,860
Did you hear that?

588
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:27,860
Nobody cracked up.

589
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:28,860
Did you hear that?

590
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:29,860
Nobody...

591
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:30,860
Even you are plug on me.

592
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:33,860
I wonder

593
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:36,860
what to do with this,

594
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:37,860
wearing clothes.

595
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:40,860
Lu Jiu...

596
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:41,860
Who is that man?

597
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:44,660
is completely different from the ice cream Lu Jiu bought.

598
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:55,500
Did Ling Lang find out the truth?

599
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:00,540
What did you find out?

600
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:02,100
You'll know when you get to the hall.

601
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,100
Let's eat first.

602
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,100
Don't worry.

603
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:10,820
Our Lord is a famous iron rooster.

604
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:13,540
Even if he wants to use you to confess,

605
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:15,660
he won't have such good food.

606
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:19,060
Someone asked me to be nice to you.

607
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:21,140
Let's eat.

608
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:22,460
I'm leaving.

609
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:44,820
I knew you wouldn't leave me alone.

610
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,100
The suspect, Lu Jiu.

611
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:12,380
The suspect killed

612
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:14,180
Brother Lu Mingcheng's husband.

613
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:15,660
The case is under investigation.

614
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:18,660
The murder case should be investigated publicly.

615
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:20,420
Why did you push everyone back?

616
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:23,460
Did you push me back or did I push you back?

617
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:28,340
Summon the coroner.

618
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:39,820
Ling Lang.

619
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:42,060
Your Excellency.

620
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:43,220
According to the investigation,

621
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:44,220
both bodies,

622
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:46,020
Lu Mingcheng and Wan Lingling's physical characteristics

623
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:47,540
and the age of the bones are similar.

624
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:48,820
The fatal injury is the knife wound.

625
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,780
The arms and chest of the body

626
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:52,500
all have the same marks of the wrong injury.

627
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:54,220
And...

628
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:58,860
Lu Jiu took the knife and killed him.

629
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:00,060
Tang Rong, I really killed someone.

630
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:02,260
How could I stand there and wait for you to catch me?

631
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:03,940
Someone wanted to kill me.

632
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:05,980
Lu Jiu, you didn't help the case at all.

633
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:09,100
Now the evidence is all about you killing someone with the knife.

634
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,100
If you think you're innocent,

635
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:11,740
you can summon the coroner to write a report.

636
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:12,540
Next time, the court...

637
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:13,540
No next time.

638
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:15,460
Lu Jiu killed his brother and sister-in-law.

639
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:16,460
The evidence is clear.

640
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:19,060
It has a great influence on the people.

641
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:21,340
No need to investigate this case.

642
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:22,660
But Your Excellency,

643
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:24,660
there are also drug in the wine of Lu's wedding night.

644
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:26,460
All the servants are in a coma.

645
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:27,460
No one is awake.

646
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:30,100
Even Lu Jiu has the characteristics of taking drug.

647
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:30,740
So...

648
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:33,820
So Lu Jiu is a self-evident country.

649
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,780
He was caught by us

650
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:38,380
because he took the drug he made.

651
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:40,420
So I declare

652
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:43,340
this case is already solved.

653
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:44,340
Report to the Ministry of Justice.

654
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:46,820
Guoguan.

655
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:47,700
Lu Jiu.

656
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:48,700
You're a dog.

657
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:50,940
Brother Xiaohu's brother is still out there.

658
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:52,420
You're so muddled.

659
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:53,180
Guoguan.

660
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:54,420
Guoguan, come on.

661
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:55,060
Help me. Help me.

662
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:56,140
Guoguan.

663
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:57,100
The door is closed.

664
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:58,100
The servants didn't come.

665
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,500
Xu Lei, you're the one who closed the door.

666
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:01,340
You...

667
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:01,940
Yes.

668
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:03,140
I'm sorry.

669
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:04,060
I'm the coroner.

670
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:04,980
I only believe in evidence.

671
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:39,220
I'm sorry.

672
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:40,100

00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:47,100
I'm sorry.

680
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,100
I'm sorry.
