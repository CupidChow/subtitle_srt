1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,080
Huh的是

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,800
Engineering

3
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:27,960
There is a hole in the ground

4
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,120
The hands become Internal Lois

5
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,800
Necl Astros

6
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,920
Neon storyline

7
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,720
The smiles of us are like a dream

8
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:44,320
My excitement is like a wind

9
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,020
The past is clear, the face is red

10
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:53,820
The sun says it's very old, listen to the song, the heart is moving

11
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:58,520
The fairy and you are crying and listening to the song

12
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:03,520
It's a pity that the sound is far away

13
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:08,520
A thousand years, ten years, a thousand years, a thousand years

14
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:13,320
With you, the rain is chasing the flow

15
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:18,120
The bright moon is wavy, the fire is in the heart

16
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:22,920
Light up the new little window

17
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,720
The words are all memories

18
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:32,520
The night wind and you fill my dream

19
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:50,520
There was a time when the

20
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:57,520
light celebrated the past

21
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,520
Episode 16

22
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,680
If you want to take revenge,

23
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,480
count me in.

24
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,720
We can join hands

25
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,040
to kill all the people of Tian Luo.

26
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:16,760
But

27
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:17,960
if we also

28
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,240
kill them all,

29
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,640
what's the difference

30
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,920
between us and the evil people of Tian Luo?

31
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,200
missing

32
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,520
Sir Dugu

33
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,880
just forgive them,

34
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,080
let them down.

35
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,360
I'm willing to bear their scale.

36
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,280
Comemce this big mess every year and

37
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,120
thousands of people

38
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,080
I...

39
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,080
Pay 100,000 copper coins to Tianluo every year

40
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,360
to keep the Iron Treasury safe.

41
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,560
Thank you for your kindness.

42
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,680
Why did you react so slowly today?

43
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,080
I've been following you.

44
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:17,960
Why haven't you noticed?

45
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,320
I'm thinking about something.

46
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,120
Are you worried about Sima Kong?

47
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,080
Don't worry.

48
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,160
The people from the Chess Division won't catch him.

49
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,320
Have some water.

50
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,840
I just had some at the river.

51
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,440
Actually,

52
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,800
I found something

53
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,480
in the Iron Treasury this time.

54
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,880
I heard that the assassins' alliance

55
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,920
has two top assassins

56
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,760
who took over the secret plan.

57
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,200
They're not only after Lu Jiu,

58
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,440
but also your name

59
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,480
is recorded on the record.

60
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,360
This business is too dangerous.

61
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,480
Why don't you leave first

62
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,240
and we'll observe it secretly?

63
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,720
I'm afraid that before I find out the truth,

64
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,040
someone has already leaked my whereabouts.

65
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,280
I didn't mean to betray you.

66
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,440
We're both from Tang.

67
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,840
You can't be responsible

68
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,840
for whatever Master asks.

69
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,440
You really don't blame me?

70
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,480
If you really want to send me to this place,

71
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,960
you won't let a secret watchman

72
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,480
remind you in the Iron Treasury.

73
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,200
How do you know it's me?

74
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,440
Master is the best at

75
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,360
making decisions without making any decisions.

76
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,880
How can you leave a chance

77
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,000
for the useless to change?

78
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,880
You're the head of the fire department.

79
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,120
The head has high expectations of you.

80
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,600
As long as we complete the task on time,

81
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,840
we can pretend that nothing has happened.

82
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,000
Master is a strict person.

83
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,600
Will he really pretend that

84
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,640
nothing has happened?

85
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,600
The head loves you deeply

86
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:48,640
and is angry with you.

87
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,600
But now,

88
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,600
you're too emotional

89
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,080
for the people you're destined to leave.

90
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,920
It's not worth it.

91
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,120
You might even fall into their trap.

92
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,720
People destined to leave?

93
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,080
Is this what you found

94
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,200
in the Iron Treasury?

95
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,960
According to the shopkeeper,

96
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,600
I'm the same person

97
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,520
who is the owner of the jade pendant.

98
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,160
Then this jade pendant

99
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,200
should be the one I took

100
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,000
before I lost my memory.

101
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,280
From the date,

102
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,280
it does look like the jade pendant on the tomb.

103
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,880
The jade pendant is made of gold steel.

104
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,080
It's not expensive.

105
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,440
The Lu family can afford it.

106
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,680
But the Lu family doesn't have any martial artists.

107
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,400
They won't spend much money on weapons.

108
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,000
Look.

109
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,440
The knife and the shield are covered with dust.

110
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,480
It means that it's been in the Iron Treasury for many years.

111
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,520
But the blade is still sealed.

112
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,400
It has a hook that looks like a tiger's paw.

113
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,120
Tiger's paw?

114
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,880
Ordinary weapons

115
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,160
are not designed like this.

116
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:03,840
That's right.

117
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,560
This design is used to cut wounds.

118
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,840
Even if it's not cut,

119
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,240
it will still be a piece of flesh.

120
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,200
It's a great weapon for assassination.

121
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:12,960
Assassination?

122
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,400
In recent years,

123
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,680
I've been investigating

124
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,480
the large and small cases of jade pendant

125
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,480
in the country.

126
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,480
I've never seen

127
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,240
such a complicated record.

128
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,240
So,

129
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,400
the clue

130
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,120
is cut again?

131
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,960
Sima Kong is familiar with all kinds of weapons.

132
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,680
When he comes back, we'll ask him.

133
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,080
But Sima Kong said he went shopping.

134
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,520
Why hasn't he come back for so long?

135
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,480
There's a room here.

136
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,720
I was going to wait for him to come back.

137
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,920
But he's not here.

138
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,960
I brought him back to show him.

139
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,600
Is there anything special

140
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,520
about this room?

141
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,280
What does it have to do

142
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,200
with this tiger's paw?

143
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,560
What's wrong, Luo Jiu?

144
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,080
Do you have

145
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,000
any new symptoms?

146
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,480
I feel that

147
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
my sense of taste

148
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,200
is much stronger than before.

149
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,400
Everything around me

150
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,160
can't escape my eyes

151
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,920
and ears.

152
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,400
Do you know where this house is?

153
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,040
Do you know where this house is?

154
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,720
Let's go find it together

155
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,840
when Sima Kong comes back.

156
00:07:58,840 --> 00:07:59,480
No.

157
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,240
Just the two of us.

158
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,320
Sima Kong said

159
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,320
he came to help me

160
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,320
for money.

161
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,160
But just now in the iron armory,

162
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:09,240
the shopkeeper said he had more than 2,000 fingerprints.

163
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,760
He must have other purposes.

164
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,560
Luo Jiu,

165
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:12,840
why do I feel that

166
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,640
you've become so suspicious recently?

167
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,560
Sima Kong and we

168
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,840
have been through life and death together.

169
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:17,920
No matter what the reason is,

170
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,200
you can't doubt him.

171
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,040
Yes.

172
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,000
I was too worried.

173
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,080
But

174
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,160
he doesn't know when he'll come back.

175
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,640
Why don't we go there first

176
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,160
and leave him a note?

177
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,320
When he sees the address,

178
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,200
he'll come over.

179
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:49,480
Here.

180
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,840
It's a secret place.

181
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,880
If you didn't lead the way,

182
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:52,920
I wouldn't have been able to find it.

183
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,160
It's isolated and easy to escape.

184
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,680
This is a good place to hide.

185
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,640
I'll go with you.

186
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,440
Go with me.

187
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,040
Go.

188
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:00,640
Go.

189
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,440
Go.

190
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:01,960
Go.

191
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,520

213
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,600
This is a good place.

214
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,840
I'll go in with you.

215
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:30,960
I'm here.

216
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,000
Don't worry.

217
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,840
Seeing Phoenix Xiaohua

218
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,800
I want to1

219
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,680
You're here.

220
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:59,900
Welcome to hui bindshan's

221
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,680
I...

222
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,520
Nothing.

223
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,400
Let's go in and have a look.

224
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
It seems that no one has lived here for a long time.

225
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:45,100
It should be under the

226
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:48,580
ground.

227
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:54,200
The Wind bustle itny

228
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:00,220
You

229
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,520
fainted my eyes.

230
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,760
What are you seeing?

231
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,260
Aren't they your friends?

232
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,440
"... How is our score from the treasure treasure in the tomb?"

233
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,680
I won't share with anyone.

234
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:58,980
icon

235
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,440
It's okay.

236
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,320
After Fan Qin killed me,

237
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,920
I sent these two buns

238
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,440
to my family.

239
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,440
They haven't eaten for days.

240
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:35,920
Human emotions

241
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,760
are the most useless things in the world.

242
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,400
These are the lessons

243
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,360
you haven't learned from me.

244
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,360
Tian Luo's killer

245
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,000
can't make any mistakes.

246
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,680
Do you know your mistake?

247
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Good.

248
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,400
You're so stubborn.

249
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,320
You let the gold-finger man go.

250
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,960
I've sent someone to solve it.

251
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,880
You're so soft-hearted.

252
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,520
It's of no use.

253
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,440
You used 100,000 coins

254
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,080
to trade your life in the iron armory.

255
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,400
It's your idea, isn't it?

256
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,040
You're a traitor.

257
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,240
But you're still

258
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,280
a dumb wolf.

259
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,680
Remember this.

260
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,360
I'll teach you martial arts.

261
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,440
Don't forget who's your master.

262
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,240
Father,

263
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,520
you taught us

264
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,400
how to achieve the goal

265
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,160
is more important than how to take it.

266
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,560
Now that I've brought back the money you ordered,

267
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,160
please forgive me.

268
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:58,920
Are you okay?

269
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,720
Senior.

270
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:01,760
Go away.

271
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,480
Get out of my way.

272
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,960
I'll hit you.

273
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,000
You'll learn a lesson.

274
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:34,960
You...

275
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:49,880
Lu Jiu,

276
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,320
yourverze,

277
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:51,960
you're taking actions

278
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,680
more and more quickly.

279
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,040
It's like few shadow bands.

280
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,360
Maybe I am really not.

281
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:00,920
Lu Jiu,

282
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,760
you're doomed today.

283
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:03,720
La breaks all another rhythm

284
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,720
You're dead for sure.

285
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,280
Let's go.

286
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:21,760
Let's go.

287
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,120
Luo Jiu, it's good to have you.

288
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,360
Stop!

289
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:39,720
Luo Jiu!

290
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,320
Si Ma Kong, stop!

291
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,400
Luo Jiu is unconscious now.

292
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,320
Don't hurt him.

293
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:46,880
Luo Jiu, look.

294
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,720
He's our friend, not an enemy.

295
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,960
He's our friend who's experienced

296
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,360
life and death together, Si Ma Kong.

297
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,160
Who's his friend?

298
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,440
At this time,

299
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,080
can't you say something

300
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,280
you cherish?

301
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,240
I'm alone.

302
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,160
I don't need to cherish.

303
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,920
Luo Jiu, I know

304
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,120
that everything you do now

305
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,520
is not out of your intention.

306
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,560
As long as I'm by your side,

307
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,040
you won't forget the original.

308
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,440
What happened just now?

309
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,880
Luo Jiu, you're awake.

310
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,880
You're a good person.

311
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:26,760
Luo Jiu.

312
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,480
I have...

313
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,880
As long as you're okay,

314
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:38,880
everything is fine.

315
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,960
He's fine.

316
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,520
I almost died.

317
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,160
Sir,

318
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,880
why are you still wandering around?

319
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,840
Shouldn't we go after Luo Jiu?

320
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,640
How?

321
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,360
We can't just wait.

322
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,560
Who said I'm waiting?

323
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,640
Do you have a plan?

324
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,160
I know you're in a bad mood.

325
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,080
I'll listen to you

326
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,080
for everything you do next.

327
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,000
Then let's

328
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,160
eat something first.

329
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,000
Luo Jiu.

330
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,680
Si Ma Kong, stop.

331
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,640
Luo Jiu is unconscious now.

332
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,640
Don't hurt him.

333
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,360
Why am I so sad?

334
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,800
The Sect Leader loves you

335
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,080
deeply and he's angry at you.

336
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:32,760
But

337
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,000
you're destined to leave now.

338
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,800
You're too emotional.

339
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,000
It's not worth it.

340
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:38,880
You might even

341
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,400
fall into his trap.

342
00:17:54,840 --> 00:18:14,440
The

343
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,680
You just came back.

344
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,360
Why don't you rest in your room?

345
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,400
Look,

346
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,560
I got bamboo shoots for you.

347
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,000
I'll cook them for you tonight.

348
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,240
Stop hiding it.

349
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,600
I fell down when I was digging bamboo shoots.

350
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,880
It's none of your business.

351
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,080
I remember how I hurt you.

352
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,240
That's not you.

353
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,200
I don't blame you.

354
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,520
But I blame myself.

355
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:37,760
Last time,

356
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,240
I made you drag your feet.

357
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,960
This time, I made you bleed.

358
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,960
I don't know how I'll hurt you next time.

359
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,400
Don't think about yourself because of something that hasn't happened yet.

360
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,800
That kind of thing will definitely happen.

361
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,200
I know myself.

362
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,040
Recently, the average of that person has become higher and higher.

363
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,120
The more I control myself, the more powerful I become.

364
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,360
I feel like I'll be swallowed up right away.

365
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,280
No.

366
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,800
You won't be swallowed up.

367
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,920
You're just using it to protect yourself and us.

368
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:04,880
Have you forgotten?

369
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:05,720
If it weren't for you,

370
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,160
I would have been killed by Li Mu long ago.

371
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,000
If I use the way of killing to protect myself,

372
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,000
I'll continue to kill people in the future.

373
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,560
I'm the crazy demon who kills people.

374
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,640
Stay away from me.

375
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,320
I'm good to you and I'm good to me.

376
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,840
You're still the pure Lu Jiu in my heart.

377
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,440
You won't become a bloodthirsty assassin.

378
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,800
But why should I let you believe it?

379
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,160
Just because of this.

380
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,640
You said this is the most important picture for you.

381
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:32,840
I believe that in the future,

382
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,720
we will have more and more beautiful memories.

383
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,040
It's just a piece of shabby painting.

384
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,600
Nothing can change.

385
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,320
My painting!

386
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,880
Sorry, Ling Lang.

387
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,280
I can only use this method to keep you away from me.

388
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,680
Only by doing this,

389
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,560
you'll be safe.

390
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,360
I've found it!

391
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,040
Ling Lang, why are you so hurt?

392
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,200
I'm fine.

393
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,320
I just fell down

394
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,440
when I was washing the vegetables at the river.

395
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,360
You never make a fuss about things.

396
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,720
Tell me, what's going on?

397
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,400
Did she bully you again?

398
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,520
I knew she was a person who likes to cross the river.

399
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,560
But I didn't expect that

400
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,320
she treated me like this and she treated you like this.

401
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,400
I have to make her happy today.

402
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,800
There's no cross the river.

403
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,440
Lu Jiu and I left you a note

404
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,560
before we came here.

405
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,120
So,

406
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,880
you didn't want to leave me behind?

407
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,280
Leave you behind?

408
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,520
How could we leave you behind?

409
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:44,680
You two...

410
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,960
You recorded the most important things

411
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,080
you wanted to record.

412
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,800
So you won't forget it.

413
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,480
As long as I have the portrait of Ling Lang,

414
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,240
I won't forget it.

415
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,160
Don't worry.

416
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:20,480
Now,

417
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,560
I'll save you.

418
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,760
How about it in the future?

419
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:30,160
Seniors will find me when I've water it.

420
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,040
And they'll show me

421
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,400
the wide garden辰.

422
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,520
grade 12.

423
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,520
Please come in, Mr. Wen.

424
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,160
The goods are very good this time.

425
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:01,280
Mr. Wen.

426
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:13,920
Well...

427
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,320
Well...

428
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,480
If you don't want to

429
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,120
wear this Versace face,

430
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,320
Who will you listen to?

431
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,360
If you don't tell me,

432
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,600
I'll cut off your hands and feet

433
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,240
and sell them to a single person.

434
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,440
Such a beautiful face,

435
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,720
if you put it on the official official's face,

436
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,520
you can't bear it anymore.

437
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,400
Since I'm so beautiful,

438
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,640
it's better to keep my hands and feet

439
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,840
to play with you.

440
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,560
Start.

441
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,000
This is not

442
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,520
a good idea.

443
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,040
So,

444
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,240
back...

445
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,920
So, you're dreaming?

446
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:40,880
Why?

447
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,320
CloudUSTrures

448
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,920
You are one of Tian Luo's men

449
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:48,620
It was my mistake

450
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:49,800
That was the most painful for me

451
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:51,920
Miss

452
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:52,900
This way you can vent your anger

453
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:53,880
Come

454
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,340
My mechanical weapon

455
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:56,740
has turned me into hostage

456
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,620
I even could be sold to Mount Gu

457
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,080
Miss, spare me

458
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:03,460
I'm sorry

459
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,920
Father, the spy just reported that

460
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,720
Xiaojiu has arrived at the bamboo house.

461
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,320
If we don't report to the police,

462
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,320
we'll see the day again.

463
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,520
Congratulations, father.

464
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,520
Sir,

465
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,920
we've been walking around all day till night.

466
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:38,120
You haven't caught a cold yet?

467
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,920
Aren't you the one who likes to walk around?

468
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,120
You're not happy this time?

469
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,920
I've already got pregnant with this man.

470
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,920
How can I be with a man who's already married?

471
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,520
You said that.

472
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,920
We're going to start working now.

473
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,520
Sir.

474
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,320
They actually went there.

475
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,520
It's just a bamboo house.

476
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:02,720
Is there anything special?

477
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:05,320
I went there to chase the flying shadows years ago.

478
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,520
Flying shadows are just the wings of the dragon.

479
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,920
Flying shadows are just a dead body of the dragon.

480
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:13,720
What skills does the Lord have to let him investigate it in person?

481
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:14,920
I found out that

482
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,120
Dugu sent flying shadows to find the missing clues

483
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:19,320
to find the missing treasure.

484
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,520
But in the end, it suddenly disappeared.

485
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,320
Then I'll go to Dugu to confront him.

486
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,520
At that time,

487
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,320
I was as naive as you.

488
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:29,320
I ordered the investigation of the dragon and its duties.

489
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,920
But I didn't expect

490
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,520
my disciple

491
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,320
to be killed by Dugu.

492
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,520
The one who breaks the laws of the heaven

493
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,720
will suffer a great loss.

494
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,520
So

495
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:56,320
you never accepted me as your disciple.

496
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,720
Dugu has been in power for a long time.

497
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:13,920
He has suppressed the case of killing the official of the Dianchan Temple.

498
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,320
This time,

499
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,320
I can't let him commit the crime again.

500
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,920
Stay away from me.

501
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,120
It's good for you and me.

502
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,920
If this can make you feel better,

503
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,920
I'll look at you from afar.

504
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,920
I'll be waiting for you.

505
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,320
What are you doing here?

506
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:52,920
Enjoying the moon.

507
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,120
Enjoying the moon?

508
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,320
I've been in a bad mood recently.

509
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,120
I haven't been in the mood to enjoy the moon for a long time.

510
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,520
It's good to have you by my side.

511
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:21,520
I'm happy to have a friend like you.

512
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:27,920
Linglong,

513
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:31,120
you've seen a lot of people in the government office.

514
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,720
I want to ask you something.

515
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,920
What is it?

516
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,120
I...

517
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,120
No, it's a friend of mine.

518
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,920
You have other friends besides Lu Jiu and me?

519
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,520
It's a client.

520
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,320
I've worked with him several times.

521
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,720
So I'm a little bit familiar.

522
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:50,320
I met him near the iron wall in the daytime.

523
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,720
No wonder we've been waiting for you in the mountain for so long.

524
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,120
What's wrong with him?

525
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,720
He's been a little bit troubled recently.

526
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:01,120
He's always sad and happy because of someone.

527
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,120
He can't control his heart.

528
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,520
He must be in love with that person.

529
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,320
You're my father.

530
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,320
Why?

531
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,320
In front of the wealth of the Fuhe Empire,

532
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:28,320
the so-called family love is not worth mentioning.

533
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,720
You're my father.

534
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:30,920
Why?

535
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,520
The so-called family love is not worth mentioning.

536
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:36,120
This is the first lesson I taught you.

537
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,320
It might be the last lesson.

538
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,320
No!

539
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,520
Who is that person?

540
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,720
Why did he call her father?

541
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,520
Father's name...

542
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,120
Father's name...

543
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,520
Son.

544
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,520
Son, why are you here?

545
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,720
I've been looking for you everywhere.

546
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,520
I've finally found you.

547
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,520
Is that flag really mine?

548
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:32,920
What are you doing?

549
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,120
Wei Linglong!

550
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,720
Do you know how much I've done for you?

551
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:06,120
Even if you've lost your memory,

552
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,520
it can't be an excuse to hurt me.

553
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,520
I know.

554
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,720
I've let you down.

555
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,320
What are you doing?

556
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,120
This is for me.

557
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:25,520
You've been ungrateful and abandoned me.

558
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,520
You've deliberately hidden your plan.

559
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,720
I left a note at the top of the mountain.

560
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:30,720
What note?

561
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,120
I didn't find anything when I arrived.

562
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,720
Then why are you here?

563
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,320
You touched my feet.

564
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,320
You're so good at acting.

565
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:43,320
You didn't realize that I put on the scented perfume.

566
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:47,320
I thought I was in the Iron Holes.

567
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,120
Speaking of the Iron Holes,

568
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,920
what were you doing when Linglong was entangled by Geng Zhao?

569
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,920
Your reaction was extraordinary.

570
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,320
If you have time to doubt me,

571
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:58,920
you might as well think about the mystery on your body.

572
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,120
Have you ever thought about

573
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,520
why your reaction was so strong this time?

574
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,120
Let me tell you.

575
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,920
The owner of this house is Fei Ying.

576
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,120
Don't you have any new memories?

577
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:17,120
You knew I was Fei Ying long ago.

578
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,720
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

579
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:22,120
You even took the lead in Fei Ying's wanted list.

580
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,720
Let me tell you.

581
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:26,520
Does it have any benefits to you and Linglong?

582
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,120
Does it have any benefits?

583
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,720
Your soul is wavering.

584
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:04,520
The family is so big, I can't think of anything.

585
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:08,120
My red thread is tangled in my palm.

586
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,920
My arms are empty.

587
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:16,320
Our love is so strong.

588
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,120
The moon is so gentle.

589
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:22,320
Why does it look so bright?

590
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:27,520
I can't help myself from this night because of love.

591
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:30,520
You are in the deep of the five-lake-dome.

592
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,520
Like the blooming of the cherry blossoms.

593
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:38,920
The heart is written on the paper.

594
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:44,720
The dream is so deep that it can't be written.

595
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:50,920
The dream is so deep that no one can be written.

596
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:56,520
I will never forget you for the rest of my life.

597
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:01,920
The mountains and rivers are long gone.

598
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:07,720
I want to be with you for the rest of my life.

599
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:13,720
I want to spend the rest of my life with you.

600
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:16,320
If we can meet again,

601
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:19,520
I will be happy.

602
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:29,520
Thank you for looking back at this time with a single glance.
