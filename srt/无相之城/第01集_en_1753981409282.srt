00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Personal cooking

2
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Episode 2

3
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It's dead!

4
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It's dead!

5
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
It's dead!

6
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It's dead!

7
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Since I was a high-ranking official,

8
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I've never encountered such a big case.

9
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Go and wake up the first female minister of the Overwatch Department.

10
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
You mean,

11
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
the first female minister of the Overwatch Department,

12
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Xu Lin Lang, Mr. Xu?

13
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Who else can break this case except her?

14
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
There are people in the Xiyuan Road.

15
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
The imperial family is not important to the general public.

16
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
The general public is not important to the state of the state.

17
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
The state of the state is not important to the inspection.

18
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Even the inspection is not carried out.

19
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
How can we talk about the case?

20
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
The wound is left-handed.

21
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
The right shoulder is wide.

22
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
The murderer uses his left hand.

23
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Su He Xiang?

24
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Su He Xiang can relieve the inflammation.

25
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
You have skin disease in your neck.

26
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
You have a sprain in your hand.

27
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
You are the murderer.

28
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Lin Lang.

29
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Lin Lang, wake up.

30
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
With my first female minister of the Overwatch Department,

31
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Xu Lin Lang,

32
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
there is no case that I can't break.

33
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
What Overwatch Department?

34
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
This is Luoyang.

35
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It's 18,000 miles from the capital.

36
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
You are a small coroner.

37
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
What are you dreaming about?

38
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You just said there was a case.

39
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It can't be a dream, right?

40
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
That's true.

41
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
The body is on the hall.

42
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It's okay if there is a case.

43
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
If you break one more case,

44
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
you have one more chance to become a female minister.

45
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Excuse me.

46
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
The deceased is a cow?

47
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
This is a hot pot.

48
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
This is a braised meat.

49
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
This is a good smell.

50
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
It's not oily at all.

51
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Use this cow to make a dent.

52
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
That's right.

53
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
What's wrong with the soup?

54
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I let Gu Zhang San raise the cow for my family.

55
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I didn't expect him to be so quick.

56
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I didn't expect him to be so quick.

57
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
How dare he poison the cow for me?

58
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Poison him?

59
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
You can't eat it?

60
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Don't worry, sir.

61
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Maybe it's hard for the defendant to escape.

62
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Zhang San,

63
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
you know your crime.

64
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I will be fair and just.

65
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I will never let anyone be hurt.

66
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I won't be innocent.

67
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I'm sorry, sir.

68
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I drank a little yesterday.

69
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
The cow was dead when I came back.

70
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Sir, I'm Li Si.

71
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I saw Zhang San feeding the cow something that was unknown.

72
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Sir,

73
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
this is found in the cow shed.

74
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
There's a batch of it.

75
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Sir,

76
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I really don't know there's a batch of it.

77
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Li Si kept telling me to leave.

78
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I have a mother and a son.

79
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I can't get any money.

80
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I can't afford to lose this job.

81
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
No money?

82
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
It's a waste of time.

83
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
The silver needle is only in the neck of the cow.

84
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
It was poured in after the cow was dead.

85
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Xu Lin Lang,

86
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
you are a man of the government.

87
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
How dare you disturb the court?

88
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Sir,

89
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
the cow just spoke.

90
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
What's going on?

91
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Sir,

92
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
this is the cow heart I just took out.

93
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Although the cow is dead,

94
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
the blood is still in the heart.

95
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
It can tell who killed the murderer.

96
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Ordinary people only touch it with their hands.

97
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Only the murderer can see the white blood.

98
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
This is fun.

99
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
This is fun.

100
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I recommend you to participate.

101
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I also recommend you to participate.

102
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Yes.

103
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Who is the murderer?

104
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
There is blood everywhere.

105
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Sir,

106
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
how did I become the murderer of the cow?

107
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Yes.

108
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Xu Lin Lang,

109
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
how could the corpse be the murderer of the cow?

110
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I just sprinkled the silver powder on the cow heart.

111
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
The murderer is guilty.

112
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
When he was checking,

113
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
he would make a false claim and dare not touch it.

114
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Only the innocent people have the green light.

115
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Sir, please forgive us.

116
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
You three are working together for your own interests.

117
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
None of you can escape the punishment.

118
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
You are punished according to the law.

119
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Sir, please forgive us.

120
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Xu Lin Lang,

121
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
you dare to take the case on behalf of me.

122
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I dare not.

123
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
You dare not.

124
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
All three of you are working together for your own interests.

125
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
None of you can escape the punishment.

126
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
You are punished according to the law.

127
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Happy New Year.

128
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Miss, here is your money.

129
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Happy New Year.

130
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Sir, please come to see me next time.

131
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Please.

132
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Mr. Lu is here.

133
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Is Ling'er here?

134
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Ling'er has been waiting for you.

135
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Please come in.

136
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Here comes the young master.

137
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
This is for you.

138
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
There are ginseng in it.

139
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Let them stay for a while to nourish your body.

140
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
You are always like this.

141
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Here.

142
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Here.

143
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
You are so kind.

144
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
You are so kind.

145
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
You are so kind.

146
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
You are even getting along with each other.

147
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Doggie.

148
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Doggie.

149
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
You are lucky today.

150
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Eat it.

151
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I just made it today.

152
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I want to share it with my colleagues.

153
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
But they all dislike me.

154
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
What?

155
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
You also dislike me?

156
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Meat buns.

157
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
You know that

158
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
there are some benefits and some difficulties.

159
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I can give you steamed buns every day.

160
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
But who can give you meat buns every day?

161
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Xu Linglang.

162
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Xu Linglang.

163
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Father.

164
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I arranged a blind date for you today.

165
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I know you are going to

166
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
be like the last time

167
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
to let go of your pigeon

168
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
and deliberately block you here.

169
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Mr. Zhang is from a family of scholars.

170
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
He was raised by a woman at the age of fourteen.

171
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Although he is not rich and noble,

172
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
he is still a gentleman

173
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
and knows the rules.

174
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
And his mother passed away early.

175
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
You don't have to be angry with your mother-in-law.

176
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
How can a blind date be like a tea house?

177
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
You are my precious daughter.

178
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
How can I be careless about your marriage?

179
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
No, no.

180
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
You have to change your clothes.

181
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Go.

182
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Father.

183
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
The first minister of Diancha Temple,

184
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Geng Zhao,

185
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
can enter the government office

186
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
and leave the country.

187
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
He is known for his black and white.

188
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
That day,

189
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Lord Geng didn't want to be the first minister

190
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
of the country,

191
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
he wanted to find out the truth.

192
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
But the enemy attacked him for several times.

193
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
In the meantime,

194
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Lord Geng was not only

195
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
willing to attack him,

196
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
but also a mountain-slayer.

197
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
The enemy was very stubborn.

198
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
He was quick to say the truth.

199
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Lord Geng was very determined.

200
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
He took the key evidence.

201
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
He attacked him in the city.

202
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
He was as powerful as a tiger.

203
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
The world was disappeared.

204
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
There was no trace of him.

205
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
He was so arrogant.

206
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
He was willing to kill him.

207
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Diancha Temple was the only official.

208
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
He was a good man.

209
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Good.

210
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Good.

211
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
When can I go to Diancha Temple

212
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:39,600
to be a

213
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,600
I can't go out.

214
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,600
What's wrong with a woman?

215
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,600
Diancha Temple is not a person of good origin.

216
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,600
As long as she is smart and capable,

217
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,600
she can do great things.

218
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,600
Everyone can invest.

219
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,600
Moreover,

220
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,600
she is born to be delicate.

221
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,600
She is more suitable than a man to solve cases.

222
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,600
Look.

223
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,600
She is a powerful woman.

224
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,600
She dares to say she is delicate.

225
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,600
You are a woman

226
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,600
who is good at drinking.

227
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,600
You want to be a member of Diancha Temple?

228
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,600
Go to dream.

229
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,600
You.

230
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,600
My legs.

231
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,600
My legs hurt.

232
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,600
My legs.

233
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,600
My legs.

234
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,600
Go to find a doctor.

235
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,600
No need.

236
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,600
I can take care of the

237
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,600
bones and stomach.

238
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,600
I will help you.

239
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,600
Are you kidding?

240
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,600
A chauyue master

241
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,600
can take care of bones?

242
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,600
Don't worry.

243
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,600
Our martial arts industry

244
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,600
is not only good at checking bodies,

245
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,600
but also at curing bones and stomach.

246
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,600
Thank you,

247
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,600
doctor.

248
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,600
How do you know I am a chauyue master?

249
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,600
You are so good at martial arts.

250
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,600
You can tell it's a human body.

251
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,600
And you are good at martial arts.

252
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,600
And your math.

253
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,600
I think

254
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,600
you are a chauyue master.

255
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,600
Almost.

256
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,600
My family is a martial arts industry.

257
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,600
The martial arts industry

258
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,600
in the martial arts world

259
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,600
is all about the skills.

260
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,600
Others look down on us.

261
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,600
We can't look down on ourselves.

262
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,600
You are right.

263
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,600
Oh, no.

264
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,600
I almost forgot

265
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,600
the job my brother gave me.

266
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,600
See you.

267
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,600
Chauyue master.

268
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,600
I'm here.

269
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,600
How can you give me

270
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,600
the right to know the truth?

271
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,600
How's the investigation going?

272
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,600
Lu Mingcheng, the eldest son of the Lu family,

273
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,600
is back.

274
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,600
The gun is out of stock.

275
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,600
The gun is out of stock.

276
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,600
The gun is out of stock.

277
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,600
The gun is out of stock.

278
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,600
See you.

279
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,600
Mr. Lu.

280
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,600
Shut up.

281
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,600
It's the old rule.

282
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,600
Mr. Lu, you are here.

283
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,600
It's really not a coincidence, Mr. Lu.

284
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,600
The room you often go to

285
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,600
is temporarily rented to a young man

286
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,600
and a young lady for a blind date.

287
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,600
How about you ask around

288
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,600
and find the best place for you?

289
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,600
This...

290
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,600
What are you talking about?

291
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,600
Don't you know

292
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,600
our young man is coming today?

293
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,600
I'm not here to ask about it.

294
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,600
I'm here to ask about it.

295
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,600
I'm here to ask about it.

296
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,600
I'm here to ask about it.

297
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,600
What?

298
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,600
I understand.

299
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,600
I guess

300
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,600
the guests in the room upstairs

301
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,600
are almost done.

302
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,600
I'll go and clean up now.

303
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,600
Young Master, please.

304
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,600
The abalone is too much to digest.

305
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,600
The chicken is already tasty.

306
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,600
And this fish...

307
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,600
You...

308
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,600
Are you going to let them eat it?

309
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,600
I'm sorry, guys.

310
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,600
The owner of the room is here.

311
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,600
We have to dig this place out.

312
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,600
Or we'll be in trouble.

313
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,600
Please ask around.

314
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,600
Okay, I'll leave first.

315
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,600
Come on, clear the account first.

316
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,600
Eat.

317
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,600
This...

318
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,600
Why am I still here?

319
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,600
I have no choice.

320
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,600
Young Master.

321
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,600
Mr. Lu.

322
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,600
Mr. Lu Jiu.

323
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,600
Jun Yulin.

324
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,600
I heard that

325
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,600
you are very elegant.

326
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,600
Today,

327
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,600
you look gorgeous

328
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,600
and natural.

329
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,600
You are really extraordinary.

330
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,600
I'm still a scholar.

331
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,600
I'm so engrossed in you.

332
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,600
You are so fast at making up.

333
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,600
Mr. Lu.

334
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,600
I have no connection

335
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,600
with this low-class female dancer.

336
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,600
Please don't misunderstand.

337
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,600
There are female dancers in this dance.

338
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,600
What's wrong with the female?

339
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,600
You are so annoying.

340
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,600
You look down on women.

341
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,600
I, Xu Linglang, am a dancer now.

342
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,600
I will be the first judge

343
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,600
of the Diancha Temple in the future.

344
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,600
Forget it.

345
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,600
I can't stand to see you.

346
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,600
I'm leaving first.

347
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,600
I'm leaving first.

348
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,600
You are still a goddess.

349
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:21,600
Look.

350
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,600
Look.

351
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,600
How funny it is.

352
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,600
Who said that a woman has to marry a man?

353
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,600
I, Xu Linglang,

354
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,600
will do a great thing.

355
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,600
If I leave like this,

356
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,600
it will be too cheap.

357
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,600
If you want to follow our young master,

358
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,600
you can't do it without some physical strength.

359
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,600
Do you know how long I practice?

360
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,600
One hour.

361
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,600
One hour.

362
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,600
Of course it's not good.

363
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,600
I found a dance teacher

364
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,600
at the tea party.

365
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,600
I know.

366
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,600
You scholars

367
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,600
want to be righteous, don't you?

368
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,600
You can dance for me.

369
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,600
Master.

370
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,600
You are so unimpressed.

371
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,600
I will help you.

372
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,600
My chest is broken.

373
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,600
Please pay the bill.

374
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,600
You dare to pretend to be dead?

375
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,600
Don't pretend to be dead.

376
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,600
Miss.

377
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,600
Please pay the bill.

378
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,600
Why should I pay?

379
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,600
I didn't want to eat this meal.

380
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,600
Let him pay.

381
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,600
Miss.

382
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,600
It's a small business.

383
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,600
Don't make it difficult for me.

384
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,600
Please pay me one tael of silver.

385
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,600
I was going to

386
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,600
study in the inspection department.

387
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,600
I just thought that I could go to

388
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,600
the book reading this month.

389
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,600
The spring festival is coming.

390
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,600
It's really hard to make money.

391
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,600
It's hard to make money.

392
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,600
Do you know that

393
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,600
it's easy to make money?

394
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,600
I'll pay the bill.

395
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,600
Wait.

396
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,600
I never take advantage of others.

397
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,600
Let's go.

398
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,600
Don't worry.

399
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,600
I have a condition.

400
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,600
What condition?

401
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,600
Give me this bone.

402
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,600
You mean this?

403
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,600
Which one do you think it is?

404
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,600
I don't think anything.

405
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,600
This bastard.

406
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,600
Why does he talk to me like that?

407
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,600
I don't believe it.

408
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,600
I don't believe it.

409
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,600
I don't believe it.

410
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,600
I don't believe it.

411
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,600
I don't believe it.

412
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,600
I don't believe it.

413
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,600
I don't believe it.

414
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,600
Why does he talk to me like that?

415
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,600
I don't believe it.

416
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,600
I can't let him go.

417
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,600
Yes, that's right.

418
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,600
You pay the bill for this meal.

419
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,600
Then I'll be polite.

420
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,600
Is it good?

421
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,600
Mr. Lu.

422
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,600
I'll return this box to you.

423
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,600
Goodbye.

424
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,600
Go.

425
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,600
Mr. Lu.

426
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,600
Mr. Lu, Mr. Lu is back.

427
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,600
Brother is back.

428
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,600
Brother.

429
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,600
Xiaojiu.

430
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,600
I miss you, brother.

431
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,600
How are you recently?

432
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,600
Good?

433
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,600
Pretty good.

434
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,600
How is father?

435
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,600
Everything is fine.

436
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,600
Come on, sit down.

437
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,600
Come on, sit down.

438
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,600
Brother.

439
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,600
Did you come back from the eastern suburb?

440
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,600
Don't you forget

441
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,600
that you came back from Shui City

442
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,600
and went to the west of the city?

443
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,600
I've been pampering you.

444
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,600
But as your brother,

445
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,600
I still have to do

446
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,600
some training.

447
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,600
Xiaojiu,

448
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,600
please listen to me.

449
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,600
I heard that

450
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,600
you've been

451
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,600
looking for those

452
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,600
street-lady-like people

453
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,600
these days

454
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,600
when I'm not here.

455
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,600
You're getting old.

456
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,600
You should do something serious.

457
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,600
Brother,

458
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,600
people are different.

459
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,600
I'm not a person who can't be a person.

460
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,600
I'm a person who can't be a person.

461
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,600
Brother,

462
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,600
people are not grass and wood.

463
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,600
You don't need to be a talent.

464
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,600
Besides, our family

465
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,600
has a good tree

466
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,600
like you.

467
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,600
You

468
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,600
always say no.

469
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,600
What should I say about you?

470
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,600
Father lives in Shui City.

471
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,600
I want to visit him

472
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,600
but he doesn't let me see him.

473
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,600
I wonder if he's still

474
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,600
blaming me for leaving home when I was a kid

475
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,600
and making the whole family worried

476
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,600
and angry about it.

477
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,600
How could it be?

478
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,600
You were young

479
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,600
and you were sick.

480
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,600
You were confused.

481
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,600
You've been wandering outside for so long.

482
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,600
It's already a blessing

483
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,600
to be able to go home safely.

484
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,600
Why would father blame you?

485
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,600
But father has been

486
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,600
avoiding me for so many years.

487
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,600
He seems to be still angry.

488
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,600
Father's deep plan and distant strategy

489
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,600
is not something that we can guess.

490
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,600
The new owner of Jingyi.

491
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,600
The new owner.

492
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,600
Look.

493
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,600
Look.

494
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,600
This hairpin

495
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,600
is so well made.

496
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,600
I hope he likes it.

497
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,600
Is it made

498
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,600
by the palace?

499
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,600
Let's go.

500
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,600
Do you want to see the art room?

501
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,600
Let me see

502
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:09,600
who wants to see the art room.

503
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,600
Did you make

504
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,600
all these jewelry?

505
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,600
Yes, I did.

506
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,600
Sister Hua Kui.

507
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,600
You're much better

508
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,600
than the other people.

509
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,600
I'm going to marry

510
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,600
the young master of the Lu family

511
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,600
in a few days.

512
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,600
I need some jewelry.

513
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,600
Clean up.

514
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,600
Come with me.

515
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,600
Why did you

516
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,600
bring me here?

517
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,600
You don't come here often.

518
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,600
But you said

519
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,600
you came to see sister-in-law.

520
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,600
Your sister-in-law

521
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,600
is not an ordinary person.

522
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,600
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

523
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,600
Xiao Jiao, call me sister-in-law.

524
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,600
By the way,

525
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,600
I need some jewelry

526
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,600
for the wedding.

527
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,600
Today I met this craftsman.

528
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:11,600
His jewelry looks like this.

529
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,600
But it's a little expensive.

530
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,600
As long as you like it,

531
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,600
I'll buy it for you.

532
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,600
Tomorrow,

533
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,600
choose the most luxurious style.

534
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,600
Don't worry about the price.

535
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,600
Send it to the Lu family.

536
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,600
Let Lingling choose it.

537
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,600
You're the best for me.

538
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,600
Yes.

539
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:29,600
But I'm Hua Kui.

540
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,600
But I'm going to be a man's father soon.

541
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,600
I'll be compared with someone sooner or later.

542
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,600
Who is it?

543
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,600
What a coincidence.

544
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,600
My name is Wan Lingling.

545
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,600
His name is Ling'er.

546
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,600
He also said

547
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,600
he wanted to change the painting style.

548
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,600
How dare you make me unhappy?

549
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,600
Come on.

550
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,600
Let the head coach

551
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,600
teach her a lesson.

552
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,600
Stop.

553
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,600
Stop.

554
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,600
Brother.

555
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,600
Ling'er is my girl.

556
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,600
I don't want to see her.

557
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,600
Let her go.

558
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,600
I'm the future mother of the Lu family.

559
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,600
She's just a singer.

560
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,600
How dare you compare me with her?

561
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,600
I'll take care of her.

562
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,600
You...

563
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,600
Enough.

564
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,600
We're family.

565
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,600
Don't make fun of others.

566
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,600
Okay.

567
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,600
Come on.

568
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,600
Dad.

569
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,600
Dad.

570
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,600
It's my fault.

571
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,600
I swear

572
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,600
I won't make trouble again.

573
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,600
It's my fault.

574
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,600
I mistook Zhang Xiuzai

575
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,600
for a good man.

576
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,600
I almost pushed you into the fire pit.

577
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,600
Dad.

578
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,600
Are you not angry?

579
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,600
I'm still angry.

580
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,600
What are you angry about?

581
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,600
We're a family of five.

582
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,600
Others think we're bad.

583
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,600
Dad, you must have begged

584
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,600
a lot of people for today's blind date.

585
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,600
As long as I can let you marry a good man,

586
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,600
I'm willing to do anything.

587
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,600
Then I won't marry anyone.

588
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,600
I'll be your girlfriend, okay?

589
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,600
If I don't marry anyone,

590
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,600
I can live my own life.

591
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,600
We'll travel the world

592
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,600
and spread justice and break the injustice.

593
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,600
The world is so beautiful.

594
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,600
It's not as beautiful as you think.

595
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,600
How do you know that?

596
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,600
Well...

597
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,600
You're the one who listens to the story.

598
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,600
I'm not the one who listens to it.

599
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,600
I have nothing to ask for.

600
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,600
I just want you to find a good man

601
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,600
to live a good life.

602
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,600
Lin Lang.

603
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,600
Lin Lang.

604
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,600
There's a death case.

605
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,600
This time, it's really a death case.

606
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,600
Take the box and come with me.

607
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,600
Hurry up.

608
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,600
Dad, what did I say?

609
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,600
Just wait and see.

610
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,600
Let's go.

611
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,600
I don't know if it's because

612
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,600
he's into this business.

613
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,600
Sir, sir.

614
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,600
Something happened.

615
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,600
What can happen if I'm here?

616
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,600
He's dead.

617
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,600
Why are the people down there coming so fast?

618
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,600
Yeah.

619
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,600
I didn't expect it to be so fast today.

620
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,600
Please come in.

621
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,600
Sir.

622
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,480
Sir, you visited the

623
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,600
private room nearby.

624
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,600
I heard something happened here.

625
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,600
So I came here.

626
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,600
Right.

627
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,600
What's going on now?

628
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,600
Sir.

629
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,600
A singer died in her room.

630
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,600
I'm sure it was a guest who forced her to die.

631
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,600
Since you're here, let's go and see.

632
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,600
Yeah, please.

633
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,600
What's going on?

634
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,600
No fatal injury.

635
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,600
But the wound is black.

636
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,600
It should be a poison.

637
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,600
But what kind of poison is it?

638
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,600
Please take all the people

639
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,600
who have been in contact with Ling'er

640
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,600
back to ask.

641
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,600
I'm an official.

642
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,600
You don't need to give me any instructions.

643
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,600
Zhao Budao.

644
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,600
Yes.

645
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,600
Take everyone back to the prison.

646
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,600
Yes.

647
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,600
Sir.

648
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,600
Sir,

649
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,600
how can we

650
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,600
do business

651
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,600
if you do this?

652
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,600
How dare you

653
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,600
ask me for instructions?

654
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,600
No, no, no.

655
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,600
Actually,

656
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,600
I know who the murderer is.

657
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,600
Today, a young man

658
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,600
had a fight with Ling'er.

659
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,600
Ling'er drank the ginseng soup

660
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,600
he brought before he died.

661
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,600
Later, the fireman saw

662
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,600
them quarreling.

663
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,600
Then,

664
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,600
Ling'er died.

665
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,600
Sir.

666
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,600
Where is he now?

667
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,600
There.

668
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,600
It's him.

669
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,600
Mr. Lu Jiu.

670
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,600
I'm close

671
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,600
with your brother, Lu Mingcheng.

672
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,600
I've been out of practice in the county office for a long time.

673
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,600
Last time, it was your brother

674
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,600
who gave me a chance to take a break.

675
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,600
You must

676
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,600
send my greetings

677
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,600
to my brother

678
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,600
on my behalf.

679
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,600
Be more familiar

680
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,600
with so many people.

681
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,600
Today,

682
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,600
it's already late.

683
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,600
I'm sorry for the people.

684
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,600
All the people

685
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,600
related to this case

686
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,600
should be registered

687
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,600
and be interrogated tomorrow.

688
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,600
Be interrogated tomorrow.

689
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,600
No.

690
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,600
He has the right and the right.

691
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,600
If you let him interrogate tomorrow,

692
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,600
I'm afraid he'll have a chance

693
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,600
to change his mind.

694
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,600
Sir,

695
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,600
take him back now

696
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,600
and interrogate him on the day.

697
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:05,600
You...

698
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,600
In a few days,

699
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,600
it's my brother's wedding day.

700
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,600
I don't want to cause trouble for him.

701
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,600
I didn't kill him.

702
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,600
I'm not afraid.

703
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,600
If I find out that it's really related to me,

704
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,600
then

705
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,600
it's not too late to arrest me.

706
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,600
It's reasonable

707
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,600
to be so human.

708
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,600
Mr. Lu,

709
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,600
you can do whatever you want.

710
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,600
Do whatever you want.

711
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,600
Don't leave.

712
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,600
Don't leave.

713
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,600
The red thread is in my hands,

714
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:15,600
but my arms are empty.

715
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:20,600
We are like a pair of swallows.

716
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,600
The moon is gentle,

717
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,600
why does it block the moonlight?

718
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,600
I'm willing to be alone,

719
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:31,600
but I'm also helpless.

720
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,600
You are in the depth of the world,

721
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:37,600
like the blooming of the cherry blossoms.

722
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:42,600
The heart is written on the paper.

723
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,600
In a dream,

724
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:48,600
a life is like a pair of people.

725
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,600
In a dream,

726
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:54,600
no one is left.

727
00:32:54,600 --> 00:33:00,600
I won't forget you for life.

728
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:03,600
The mountains and rivers are long gone,

729
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,600
but there is no wind in the wind.

730
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,600
In a dream,

731
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:12,600
a life is like a pair of people.

732
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,600
In a dream,

733
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:18,600
no one is left.

734
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,600
If we can meet again,

735
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:24,600
how will it be?

736
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:33,600
Thank you for looking back at the past with a single glance.

737
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:40,600
Thank you for watching.
