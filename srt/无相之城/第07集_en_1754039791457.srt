1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,360
Already lost in the wildness, you wake me up

2
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:39,480
The smiles of our eyes are看 as a dream

3
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,480
A performance of romance, I soprattutto l'ai feathers

4
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,400
You are its glutton, I listen to the politician

5
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:54,320
Say she's looking for a bride

6
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,800
För you, I feel so drop dead

7
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:32,780
– don't hate me as you worldviews my dreams

8
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:37,660
– please don't hate me, w rolls the Communist Party

9
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:41,640
– the Lian

10
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,800
Episode 18

11
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:06,680
My Lord,

12
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,280
there's something wrong with these killers.

13
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,120
Although their weapons

14
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,200
don't have any mark,

15
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,000
their craftsmanship

16
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,400
is the same as the one

17
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,440
that killed Xu Linglang's father.

18
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:16,960
When did you find out

19
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,120
Xu Linglang's father's case?

20
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,240
You always say that

21
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,800
Xu Linglang's paper is well written

22
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,960
and is professional in solving cases.

23
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,320
I just want to find out

24
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,720
what he's really like.

25
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,360
What's wrong with your documents?

26
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,600
You'd better not ask me about it.

27
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,400
Yes.

28
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,360
How's that?

29
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:47,080
I didn't ask you to

30
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,080
take down the lid

31
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:50,640
on the letter.

32
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,880
The criminal was Mr. Lu.

33
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,520
What?

34
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,720
Since everyone is here,

35
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,080
I'll start the official business.

36
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:01,760
I...

37
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,640
You can't hurt Linglong.

38
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,600
She's going to be my wife soon.

39
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,040
How can I hurt her?

40
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,640
You have to return my face to her.

41
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,240
I've already given you the anesthetic.

42
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,880
When you wake up,

43
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,280
you'll be my wife.

44
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,080
Go!

45
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,040
A monoc fusion from the beast power to take the Notice of quaisITY

46
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,520
You've been sl Мoooooov corv nied

47
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:53,480
Ba...

48
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,840
Why do you feel that way?

49
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,020
Your Highness,

50
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,180
?)

51
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,500
Your Highness,

52
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,020
Ar CRUEL!!!

53
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,460
Don't we all understand each other?

54
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,440
I will...

55
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,320
In theory,

56
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:53,960
the news from Clan Master

57
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,920
The news should have been passed on by now.

58
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,280
Why can't we

59
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,200
get the letter?

60
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:05,960
I'll wait for you outside.

61
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:06,480
Okay.

62
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,760
You two

63
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,200
can stay for two more days.

64
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,800
Oh no.

65
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,320
Could it be that something happened

66
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,320
to the Chief?

67
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:24,800
What's wrong?

68
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,840
It's hard to say

69
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,200
that I'm not feeling well

70
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,640
when I see myself killing people.

71
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,880
You killed a bad person

72
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,960
who is not willing to accept the punishment.

73
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,960
You didn't do anything wrong.

74
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,240
They killed people

75
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,360
to get out of prison together.

76
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,920
But you did it to save me.

77
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,360
You didn't do anything wrong.

78
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,600
Please help me.

79
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,880
You started actingaze

80
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,200
after the letter was sent.

81
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:43,960
What happened?

82
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:46,920
I am not sure,

83
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,280
just

84
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:49,840
feeling a bit nervous.

85
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,080
You suspect that there's other way

86
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,080
I might Mostly

87
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:53,760
more than two days.

88
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,360
Do you remember

89
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,360
the sand in Lin Mu's wife's body?

90
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,640
I've seen it.

91
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,000
Could it be the nine-cut Cloud Sand?

92
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,880
Nine-cut Cloud Sand?

93
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,240
It's a treasure of the Feng Lei Hall.

94
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,840
It can keep you alive for ten years.

95
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:21,920
That's why

96
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,920
the body of Lin Mu's wife

97
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,080
can be preserved.

98
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,400
But since the Feng Lei Hall was destroyed

99
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,360
twenty years ago,

100
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,880
no one has seen the nine-cut Cloud Sand.

101
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,600
How did you know?

102
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,600
My family of five

103
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,120
has heard many stories about it.

104
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,440
My father told me about it.

105
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,240
Forget about it.

106
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,760
There's a treasure of the Feng Lei Hall

107
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,120
in your brother's secret room.

108
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,680
Maybe it's related to

109
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,000
the Feng Lei Hall case.

110
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:42,920
Let's leave the city

111
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:43,760
and get the relic.

112
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:44,600
Wait.

113
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,520
Before we leave the city,

114
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,880
I think there's something

115
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:48,880
more important.

116
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,840
The martial arts can be soft,

117
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,720
but also weapons.

118
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,600
But I can't control myself.

119
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,160
Then learn to control it.

120
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,200
Don't let it get you down.

121
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,120
Look.

122
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,520
This is how you control it.

123
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,640
I see.

124
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,360
Teach me more.

125
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,600
So this is how it feels to learn martial arts.

126
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,160
Lu, you're so good.

127
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,320
You're so nice.

128
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,920
We'll be even more confident on the way.

129
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,240
You have a spy?

130
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,000
Don't be surprised.

131
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,240
You can solve the problem

132
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,400
by spending money.

133
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,360
No wonder you like to make money.

134
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,000
Have you had enough?

135
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,040
I have good news

136
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,880
and bad news for you.

137
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,600
The assassin alliance

138
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,440
has doubled the reward

139
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,640
for hunting us down.

140
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,000
What good news is this?

141
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,080
The reward is doubled.

142
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,520
More people are hunting you down.

143
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:16,880
Not you.

144
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,120
It's me.

145
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,480
You're the one who killed me.

146
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,720
You're the one who killed me.

147
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,480
It's us.

148
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,560
Us?

149
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,360
You mean

150
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,360
Ling Lang was also hunted down

151
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,520
by the assassin alliance?

152
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:30,720
Yes.

153
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,560
Although Xu Ling Lang saved him,

154
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,640
the remnant of Feng Lei Hall

155
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,720
is a disaster

156
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,480
to keep him by his side.

157
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,000
Don't worry, father.

158
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,520
I've arranged it long ago.

159
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,720
But what did I do wrong?

160
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,680
It's okay to make your own decisions.

161
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,920
But don't learn from Lu Jiu.

162
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,320
Don't forget who your son is.

163
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,560
Yes. Yes.

164
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,240
The other news is...

165
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,440
Can I not listen?

166
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,400
The one I found

167
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,640
in Li Mu's secret room just now.

168
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,360
This one.

169
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,120
The gold coin is beautiful.

170
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:24,960
I've never seen it before.

171
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:25,840
This is a red pattern.

172
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,320
The script often says

173
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,560
red pattern is a common currency

174
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,720
for the people of Jianghu.

175
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:30,720
Now we're going to

176
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,960
the Panshan Pavilion in Shui City.

177
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,680
What bad news is this?

178
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,760
The bad news I'm referring to is

179
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,280
that Li Mu is not an ordinary doctor.

180
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,440
I believe his death

181
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,000
will be spread out soon.

182
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,040
By then,

183
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,720
we'll attract more attention.

184
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,560
What's the Iron Wall?

185
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:50,840
In the script,

186
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,000
the red pattern is not fake.

187
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,800
You're talking too much.

188
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,160
The Iron Wall is a bank account of the people of Jianghu.

189
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,880
This is how the jade pendant is used.

190
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,120
This jade pendant...

191
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,120
What's wrong?

192
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,960
I think I've seen it somewhere.

193
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,800
Fei Ying is Wu Xiang Cheng's killer.

194
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,120
He must have set up a trap in the Iron Wall.

195
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,840
If he left a secret

196
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,840
of Wu Xiang Cheng's treasure before he died,

197
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,120
he might be in the Iron Wall.

198
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,600
How did Li Mu get the Jiu Duan Xiao Yun Sha?

199
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,200
Maybe he could find clues in the Iron Wall.

200
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,680
So I suggest

201
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,280
we should go to the Iron Wall

202
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,240
before we get the material.

203
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,600
Okay.

204
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,400
What do you mean?

205
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,000
This is the deposit you made.

206
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,160
We were brothers when we were born.

207
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:52,960
Now,

208
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,080
we're strangers.

209
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,120
Who's your brother?

210
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,840
Someone said they couldn't control the transformation,

211
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,480
but they kept saying it.

212
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,120
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

213
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,240
I really don't know how I transformed.

214
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,200
I regained my normal state after I woke up.

215
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,840
Two transformations.

216
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,760
There's one thing in common

217
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,360
besides life and death.

218
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,560
Tell me.

219
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,440
When you transformed,

220
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,840
you had Lin Lang.

221
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,400
What does it have to do with me?

222
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,000
We're just friends.

223
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,760
There's no reason to change for him.

224
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,880
It's best that way.

225
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,480
Then I won't have to worry about being dragged into this.

226
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,800
You're always talking nonsense.

227
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,320
Who knows what you're thinking?

228
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,600
Lu Jiu, don't do anything silly.

229
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,480
Letting the one you care about die in the process.

230
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,040
It's not silly.

231
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:59,000
Did I really think it through?

232
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,200
Lin Lang!

233
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:21,960
Are you all right?

234
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,360
Lu Jiu.

235
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,600
It's getting late.

236
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,360
Let's hurry up and get going.

237
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,720
What are you thinking about?

238
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,160
You...

239
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:47,560
Lin Lang!

240
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,400
Lin Lang!

241
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,720
What's the meaning of this, Lord Geng?

242
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,160
You once left and joined the Investigation Department.

243
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,560
Have you changed?

244
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,120
I haven't changed.

245
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,840
It's just that

246
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,040
I'm now famous in the county.

247
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,920
I'm afraid I won't have this chance again.

248
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,480
I'll give you this chance today.

249
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,560
Are you interested in being a police officer?

250
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I'm not interested.

251
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,720
Are you interested in being my confidant?

252
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:29,560
Geng Zhao finally can't hold his anger.

253
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,160
Lin Lang!

254
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,200
Lin Lang!

255
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,240
Lin Lang!

256
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:35,960
Lin Lang!

257
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,440
Are you all right?

258
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,280
Why did you disappear all of a sudden?

259
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,120
Why didn't you tell me?

260
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,560
Why are you so fierce?

261
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,040
What does it have to do with you?

262
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,440
I...

263
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:49,520
I...

264
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:18,760
Let's go to the inn.

265
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,640
My father.

266
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,600
Si Ma Kong,

267
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,120
why did you suddenly become so generous?

268
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,200
I think he thinks it's dirty.

269
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,400
The environment here is too bad.

270
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,760
Lin Lang is a girl's home.

271
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:30,520
It's not good to live here.

272
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,320
It's at least half a day's journey

273
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,840
from the town in front.

274
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,360
You're not afraid of danger

275
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,160
if you drive at night.

276
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,640
Besides, we're taking Lin Lang with us.

277
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,640
It's easy to be ambushed

278
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,000
if you drive at night.

279
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,800
I'm not a rich girl.

280
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,080
Let's have a drink tonight.

281
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,080
You two have a good time.

282
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,840
I don't know when you'll get along.

283
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,480
It seems that I'm the one who's in charge.

284
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,840
I'm just talking about the matter.

285
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,720
You two stay here.

286
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,200
I'm an extra.

287
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,160
I'll leave first.

288
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:02,920
Si Ma Kong.

289
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,640
You must be hungry.

290
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,880
I'll get you something to eat.

291
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:09,720
When I was a kid,

292
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,520
I often went to the bird-fighting with my father.

293
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,400
I didn't bring a slingshot.

294
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:19,640
I'm sorry.

295
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,600
Since I became a god,

296
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,800
not only did I improve my martial arts,

297
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,200
I've also become more intelligent.

298
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:41,800
I don't know

299
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,280
what kind of person I used to be.

300
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:47,840
You should

301
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,400
report Lu Xiao's whereabouts

302
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,920
and enter the Supervisory Bureau.

303
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,320
You'll be

304
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,840
in a lot of trouble.

305
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:54,760
Mr. Geng,

306
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,440
I've always regarded you as my idol.

307
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:57,920
Because you're narrow-minded and bold,

308
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,000
you've been killing people.

309
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,320
Now,

310
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,960
you make me betray my friends.

311
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,400
I, Xu Lin Lang,

312
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,440
can't communicate with you.

313
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,200
The one who killed your father

314
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,440
is from Tian Lu.

315
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:12,960
Under the sky,

316
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,440
the only person who can fight against the sky

317
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,280
is the Supervisory Bureau.

318
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:19,480
Lin Lang,

319
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,480
what's wrong with you?

320
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,880
When you eat,

321
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,360
it's the happiest time for you.

322
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,840
It has nothing to do with you.

323
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,600
Mr. Sima,

324
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,240
are you really not eating?

325
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,360
I'm on a diet.

326
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,400
I'm not eating.

327
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:45,960
What a pity.

328
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,280
You're so fat and tender.

329
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,960
You're not fat and tender.

330
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,400
You're so delicate.

331
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,120
The fire is just right.

332
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,000
It's really delicious.

333
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:11,320
I'm out of energy.

334
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,480
One of you is not in the mood to eat.

335
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,080
The other one doesn't want to eat.

336
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,000
I'm full.

337
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:15,800
Throw it away.

338
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,000
No, thank you.

339
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,040
No.

340
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,800
I want to eat too.

341
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,040
It might turn it into hasi士 with rice.

342
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,600
So I just have to get rid of it and similarities with the other two.

343
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,040
Thank you.

344
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,360
Recipe is like a fly whar I can kiss.

345
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,120
Cook is like a bee who efforts to glass itsume.

346
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,280
When will you stop fighting?

347
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,040
We didn't do anything.

348
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,040
Forget it.

349
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,640
It has nothing to do with me.

350
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,320
Waste of ingredients.

351
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,720
Add one more to finish.

352
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,280
Waste of ingredients.

353
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,320
Ridiculous.

354
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,840
Why am I so angry?

355
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,920
Thank you for your hard work.

356
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,440
What are you doing?

357
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,320
Do you want to eat?

358
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,280
What's wrong?

359
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,440
Did your eyes fly blind again?

360
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,520
Lu Jiu.

361
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,320
Lu Jiu.

362
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:13,960
What's wrong?

363
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,080
Are you entangled in her dream again?

364
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,080
What's wrong?

365
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,320
I was dreaming.

366
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,440
I thought I was dreaming.

367
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,040
You dreamed of me?

368
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,160
No.

369
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:30,440
I...

370
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,600
I did dream of you.

371
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,840
But it's not that kind of dream.

372
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,800
I didn't say it's that kind of dream.

373
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,320
Lingla.

374
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,360
I have something to tell you.

375
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,040
I...

376
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,440
The person who killed your father

377
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,680
came from the Celestial Land.

378
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,280
In the Underworld,

379
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,920
the only person who can fight against Celestial Land

380
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,480
is Dingzhang Si.

381
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,200
I've always been...

382
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,080
I'm the same.

383
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,200
You're the same.

384
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,520
I'm the same.

385
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,800
I also treat you as a good friend.

386
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,480
And Sima Kong.

387
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,120
We're all good friends.

388
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,000
Ling...

389
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:14,600
Ling...

390
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,440
What's wrong with you?

391
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:18,920
What else can I do?

392
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:19,280
I...

393
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:20,760
I did nothing.

394
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,240
Maybe

395
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,040
I did nothing wrong.

396
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:39,680
Lu Jiu.

397
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,040
Don't blame me.

398
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,720
I'm doing this to find out

399
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,160
who killed my father.

400
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,400
Are you okay?

401
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,240
I'm fine.

402
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:13,600
Let me go.

403
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:15,360
Be strong.

404
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,360
I told you for years

405
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,480
you would give this hand to me.

406
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,360
What's wrong with you?

407
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,040
I tried everything.

408
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,960
I did everything for you.

409
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,720
Then I did everything for you.

410
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,040
You can't do that.

411
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:31,960
I...

412
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,320
I had time.

413
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,000
Yuan Bro.

414
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:41,920
Where is Lu Jiu?

415
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,800
He just felt ashamed to see you.

416
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,200
Sorry.

417
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,280
I didn't mean to hurt you.

418
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,480
This is for me.

419
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,720
It's so far from the city.

420
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:25,960
You came back so quickly.

421
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,120
It must be hard for you.

422
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:29,320
I can only do this.

423
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,560
Don't worry.

424
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,880
It's just a small injury.

425
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:36,400
It's nothing serious.

426
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,400
Don't forget

427
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,960
I'm a street-sweeper.

428
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,160
I can't hurt you.

429
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:41,720
I'm sorry.

430
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,440
Don't comfort me.

431
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,000
I'm serious.

432
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,480
When I was handling the case,

433
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,800
I was in a hurry to go back to the office.

434
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,720
I happened to fall off the carriage.

435
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,880
I was also crushed by the carriage passing by.

436
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,000
I was so shocked.

437
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,200
I was so shocked.

438
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,160
Am I amazing?

439
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:55,920
Lingla.

440
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:57,560
Can you

441
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:00,240
stop pretending to be okay every time?

442
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,600
If it weren't for me,

443
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,880
you would have been killed long ago.

444
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,320
No one would have chased you.

445
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,240
And no one would have been...

446
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,640
It's not your fault.

447
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,440
But I'm so confused now.

448
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:09,960
I'm a martial artist.

449
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:10,880
Maybe

450
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,560
I'm a killer

451
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,960
who comes from the cold and ruthless world.

452
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,960
I don't want to hurt you.

453
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,000
Stay away from me.

454
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,760
I won't let you become that kind of person.

455
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,360
As long as I'm here,

456
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,480
you won't forget the path of the future.

457
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,400
You won't become

458
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,040
a cold and ruthless killer.

459
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,000
It seems that my beloved disciple

460
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,400
is gradually recovering his memory.

461
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,560
He has found the treasure

462
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,560
he found before he lost his memory.

463
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:17,240
He has also recovered his memory.

464
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,200
Send a message to Lu Kun.

465
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,320
Ask him to meet me.

466
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,240
Yes.

467
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,400
Lord Dugu.

468
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,800
It's been a long time. How are you?

469
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,240
You're here so early.

470
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,160
Brother Lu.

471
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,200
It's been a long time.

472
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,840
How are you?

473
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:33,880
I'm old.

474
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,000
If it weren't for your blessing,

475
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,920
I wouldn't be alive today.

476
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,160
Brother Lu, you're too kind.

477
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,320
With your talent,

478
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,000
even if you don't date me,

479
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:45,400
you can still make a great achievement.

480
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,760
Brother Lu, you're still not feeling well?

481
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,120
I'm old.

482
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,200
I just want to

483
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,760
rest in peace

484
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,320
under your protection.

485
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,120
Come on.

486
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,040
Please sit.

487
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,120
Sit. Sit. Sit.

488
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,040
Please, Lord.

489
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,960
It's autumn.

490
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,840
You should be more careful.

491
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,240
Come on.

492
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,840
Bring the wine His Majesty gave you

493
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,320
to warm you up.

494
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:13,640
No.

495
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,000
Lord, I'm weak.

496
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,480
I'm afraid I can't drink.

497
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:18,800
Thank you, Lord.

498
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,040
Then have some tea.

499
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,160
Brother Lu is not feeling well.

500
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,760
You should set up a trap

501
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,320
to lure the concubines.

502
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,640
It's not easy to set up a trap

503
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:35,960
to lure the concubines back to the formation.

504
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,320
Please have some tea, Lord.

505
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,080
I've been pretending to be a stranger

506
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,040
and living in the city.

507
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,320
I've been working for you in the formation.

508
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,440
I've never set up a trap.

509
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,240
When the concubines lost their memories,

510
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:51,880
we made a promise

511
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,560
to do it again

512
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,400
when the world is in peace.

513
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,720
No one else

514
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,720
knew about this.

515
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:04,320
But someone set up a trap

516
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,000
and almost got Fei Ying

517
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:08,640
to be in the hands of Diancha Si Gengzhao.

518
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,360
Tell me.

519
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,440
What's going on?

520
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,760
I can see it.

521
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:19,400
I'm loyal to you.

522
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:22,720
I know your loyalty.

523
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,080
Otherwise,

524
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,080
you wouldn't have

525
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,720
set up the trap

526
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:33,320
and come to me, right?

527
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,240
Li Chu.

528
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,520
Three of Lu Jiu's men

529
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:59,360
are now the third in the ranking list.

530
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,080
There were only 100

531
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,440
of them at the beginning.

532
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,880
That's because at the beginning,

533
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,560
they didn't know he could do martial arts.

534
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,800
They thought he was a playboy.

535
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:07,880
Killing him

536
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,440
was like killing a chicken.

537
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,800
Who knew Lu Jiu

538
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,360
was so powerful?

539
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,080
I'm sure he's a playboy.

540
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,400
He's a playboy.

541
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:16,560
He's a playboy.

542
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,760
He's a playboy.

543
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,080
He's a playboy.

544
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,160
He's a playboy.

545
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,320
He's a playboy.

546
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,560
He's a playboy.

547
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,640
He's a playboy.

548
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:24,880
He's a playboy.

549
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,360
He's a playboy.

550
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:27,520
He's a playboy.

551
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:31,120
Is there anyone who can take the responsibility?

552
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,480
I think it's too late.

553
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,360
It's likely that

554
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,240
Li Chu and Fei Ying are the same.

555
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,440
No one can take the responsibility

556
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,640
even if they've been rewarded for years.

557
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:38,400
By the way,

558
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,760
how long have Li Chu and Fei Ying

559
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,080
been rewarded?

560
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,360
Li Chu

561
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,280
must have been rewarded for 20 years.

562
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,920
Fei Ying has been rewarded for six or seven years.

563
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,200
The reward is increasing every year.

564
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,840
But no one can take the responsibility.

565
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,440
Is it because

566
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,920
they're good at martial arts

567
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,720
or because they can't find anyone?

568
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,160
Jin'er, you know it.

569
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,040
The killers who assassinated them

570
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,600
never came back.

571
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,960
They're all dead.

572
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:39,400
Leng Yi Fan

573
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:04,960
It's hard to tell.

574
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,960
The moon is gentle.

575
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:10,960
Why does it look like moonlight?

576
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,960
I love myself.

577
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,960
I can't help it.

578
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,960
You are in the depth of the world.

579
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,960
Like the blooming of the flowers.

580
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:27,960
The heart is written on the paper.

581
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:32,960
A lifetime of dream, a lifetime of life.

582
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:38,960
No one can replace the dream.

583
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:44,960
I will never forget you.

584
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:50,960
The mountains and rivers are long gone.

585
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:55,960
A lifetime of dream, a lifetime of life.

586
00:33:55,960 --> 00:34:01,960
No one can replace the dream.

587
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:07,960
If we can meet again, how will it be?

588
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:17,960
Thank you for looking back at the past with a single glance.

589
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:30,960
