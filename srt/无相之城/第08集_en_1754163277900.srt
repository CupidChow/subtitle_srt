1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,880
Sacred Reworker

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,740
You wake up before the lie

3
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:39,740
The smile of being together is like a dream

4
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:44,320
My excitement is like a wind

5
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,080
You are clear, a bright red

6
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:53,920
The sun says it's very good, listen to the song, turn the heart

7
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,620
I'm with you, I'm crying and listening to the song

8
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:03,420
It's a pity that there's no one behind me

9
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:08,600
Two million jeg factors of rich and moderate

10
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:12,960
Unee

11
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:19,600
Raindrops pop our hands and feet

12
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,100
usage of

13
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:27,700
These words make people go

14
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:31,660
Don't shun interests and stop my dreams

15
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:36,740
Pisffeit dance pranks

16
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:43,180
Nathan's time is very beautiful

17
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,500
Marquis simplest

18
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:28,700
Lu Jing, it's me.

19
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,140
Did you have a fever again?

20
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:41,300
Didn't you promise not to do anything to him?

21
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:42,140
I...

22
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:58,620
Do your best!

23
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,560
You must not let anyone approach you.

24
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:02,060
Darn you, a baby,

25
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,100
how can you hit others?

26
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:07,980
I don't think

27
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:08,380
I can!

28
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:11,380
Don't talk nonsense!

29
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,260
Stop it.

30
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,340
If you attack them,

31
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:14,340
your charge will be cut off.

32
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,220
Don't you agree

33
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:17,140
I should learn to control my body

34
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:17,980
rather than let him control me?

35
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:27,620
Are you guys careful?

36
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:28,700
Behind you!

37
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:36,980
Li Wen!

38
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,300
Let her go.

39
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:39,620
I'm the one you're looking for.

40
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:41,700
She's worth more than you.

41
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:42,900
I'm curious

42
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,540
why this girl

43
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:46,100
deserves so much reward.

44
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:58,420
Wait.

45
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:00,540
There are more killers behind the key.

46
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:01,700
Ling Lang is injured now.

47
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,140
I can't protect him.

48
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,260
Who asked you to protect me?

49
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,180
Didn't you see that?

50
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,020
I'm so powerful.

51
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:08,380
It's not the time to be willful.

52
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:10,020
From now on,

53
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,740
I won't let you leave me.

54
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:20,540
Send a message.

55
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,660
Don't hurt her life

56
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:22,660
if you don't chase after him.

57
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,020
You want to use the Dietchang Division

58
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:25,300
for Xu Ling Lang?

59
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,220
He hasn't agreed to be our immortal yet.

60
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:28,060
Li Chu, Fei Ying,

61
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,020
the assassin who chased after the killer

62
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:29,700
on the list,

63
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,620
is involved in the Feng Lei case 20 years ago.

64
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,460
Xu Ling Lang is involved in it.

65
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:34,700
This must be related.

66
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:36,140
Excuse me.

67
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:37,860
I think you're just being selfish.

68
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:40,420
You've always only listened to the court's orders.

69
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:41,620
But you accepted

70
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,260
the file of Xu Ling Lang in Luoyang County.

71
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:44,940
Now you're being so nice to him.

72
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:45,980
I think...

73
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:46,780
I think...

74
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,380
I think you're obviously into him.

75
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:51,580
I just think

76
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:52,860
he's a good candidate for the case.

77
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:54,260
I want to put him in the Dietchang Division.

78
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:56,100
Although the Dietchang Division

79
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,740
is not divided into men and women,

80
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:59,500
in all these years,

81
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:01,060
there haven't been many women who can go in.

82
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,980
You still said you liked him.

83
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:05,220
Nonsense.

84
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,580
Don't think I don't know.

85
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:08,860
Since the first day I went into the Dietchang Division,

86
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,340
you've been looking down on me.

87
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:11,940
You always find excuses

88
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:13,180
to drive me back to the capital.

89
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,340
I don't want to do as you say.

90
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,260
I'll pass on the message

91
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,220
to protect Xu Ling Lang

92
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:19,660
so that you won't make any mistakes.

93
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:26,860
It's cold.

94
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:27,940
It's cold.

95
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:28,700
Lu Jiu,

96
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:29,900
how are you?

97
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,220
It's cold.

98
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,940
That bastard went to get some medicine.

99
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,620
He still doesn't know he's back.

100
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:57,580
Young Technologies,

101
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:58,580
has he killed or beaten the guy's son?

102
00:05:59,020 --> 00:05:59,620
Hmm.

103
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:01,780
I didn't kill him.

104
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,860
Hisshirts have been tied up.

105
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:05,180
Someone decorated his futons.

106
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:14,460
He'll surely like to steal his

107
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:14,780
handsomely disguised clothes.

108
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:16,060
Alright.

109
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:17,500
of the parameters.

110
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:21,380
How about

111
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,140
I'm telling it to you first

112
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:23,300
because I want Didai楊

113
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:24,460
to handle the case?

114
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:25,980
Forbidden City

115
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,020
I'm sorry, Ximo.

116
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,140
You grew up and became tough.

117
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:31,460
You're just trying to assassinate your brother.

118
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:32,620
My son is innocent.

119
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:35,140
I told them to kill Xiaojiu.

120
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:36,580
I just brought him back.

121
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:37,820
I went to find the assassinator.

122
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:38,980
I was afraid that our people

123
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,420
would expose my father's whereabouts.

124
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,860
If you really care about your brother,

125
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,180
why did you keep him in Luoyang County?

126
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,100
I received the news

127
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,260
that the Geng Zhao of the Investigation Department

128
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:50,500
sneaked into Luoyang County secretly

129
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,380
to investigate our Lu family.

130
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:52,420
I was afraid that

131
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:54,300
he would reveal my father's true identity.

132
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,260
So I took the opportunity to sneak in.

133
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,020
Xiaojiu was caught.

134
00:06:58,420 --> 00:06:59,540
I was totally surprised.

135
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,420
It was an accident and an injustice.

136
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,660
I raised him for seven years.

137
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,500
I almost lost my job because of you.

138
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:11,500
They...

139
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,220
Before I died,

140
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,460
they had already taken action.

141
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:15,660
Tian Luo...

142
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:17,300
Tian Luo is their chief.

143
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:18,620
It's possible that

144
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,700
the evil man is behind this.

145
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:23,100
Then he was pushed to my father's hand.

146
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,060
Dugu...

147
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:27,940
And that Xu Linglang.

148
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:29,260
Dugu knew that

149
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,780
his father was a former minister of Fang Lei Hall.

150
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,940
He also told him to stay with Xiaojiu.

151
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:35,420
I was afraid that they had other plans.

152
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,340
That's why I ordered them to kill him.

153
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,380
You and I are father and son.

154
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:50,500
We should share the same heart

155
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:53,020
so that we can get the five treasures together.

156
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,580
Yes.

157
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,380
Luckily, I got fired.

158
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:43,020
Come in!

159
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,220
I'm not feeling well.

160
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:55,700
I'm feeling very uncomfortable.

161
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:57,940
So...

162
00:08:58,460 --> 00:08:59,020
Yesterday,

163
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:00,780
you were in bed all day.

164
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,020
You've worked hard.

165
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:03,420
You're talking about this?

166
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:04,500
I'm not working hard.

167
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:06,140
By the way,

168
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:08,060
didn't you say you were going to help Lu Jiu get the medicine?

169
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,180
Why didn't you come back?

170
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,260
Do you want me to come back?

171
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:11,740
Of course I want you to come back.

172
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,660
After all, you're going to help Lu Jiu get the medicine.

173
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:16,780
I'm not going to help you.

174
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:17,980
I'm going to help you.

175
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:19,380
You're not going to help me?

176
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:20,500
I'm going to help you.

177
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,060
I'm going to help you.

178
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:23,620
Oh.

179
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,300
Lu Jiu has lost all his fever.

180
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,420
Why can't he wake up?

181
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,300
He's still in a coma.

182
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:31,740
I won't let him die easily.

183
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,700
Si Maokuo, you're sick!

184
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:42,980
No.

185
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,260
You're the one who's sick.

186
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,140
Lu Jiu, you're finally awake.

187
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:46,820
I...

188
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,700
Did I have a fever again?

189
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,140
I didn't pass out this time.

190
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:57,180
Why do I still have a fever?

191
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:58,380
No matter what the reason is,

192
00:09:59,140 --> 00:09:59,660
in short,

193
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,500
it's because Ling Lang has been guarding you all night.

194
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:05,180
As long as you can recover normally,

195
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:06,620
everything is not important.

196
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:16,820
But...

197
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:19,220
Why...

198
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,380
Why are we here?

199
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:25,020
If we come to the inn rashly,

200
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:28,060
the assassins will find us easily.

201
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,260
I agree.

202
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,020
But Ling Lang insisted on doing so

203
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,140
for your health.

204
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:34,260
It's okay.

205
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,660
Someone will protect us.

206
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:37,900
I found traces of the government's surveillance

207
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:39,740
near the inn.

208
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,540
They just looked at us from afar.

209
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:43,300
They didn't want to arrest us.

210
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:44,660
They even wanted to protect us.

211
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:45,820
Protect us?

212
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,420
It should be related to this.

213
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:53,620
What's this?

214
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,220
The reward order of the assassins' alliance.

215
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:57,260
Your current reward is the third most important.

216
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:59,660
It's more than two hundred times more than ours.

217
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:03,300
How many times has he recovered his flying shadow?

218
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,300
In one's mind,

219
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,780
there are two people's memories.

220
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:09,420
How can there be such a magical world in the world?

221
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:10,780
I'm afraid it's not pretending.

222
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:11,860
Let me try you.

223
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:13,340
Si Wan Ku, what are you doing?

224
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,180
You're not pretending.

225
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:18,580
Pretend for what?

226
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:19,580
Your martial arts today

227
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:20,900
are much better than yesterday.

228
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:21,740
It seems that you're awakening

229
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:23,140
your deep memories.

230
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:24,300
But you were a useless person

231
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:25,580
who used martial arts as a spirit.

232
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:26,460
Si Wan Ku,

233
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:27,860
don't blame me for your reasoning.

234
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:28,980
Don't scold me all the time.

235
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:46,980
I...

236
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:01,340
Si Wan Ku,

237
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:02,860
look what you did.

238
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,820
You insisted on using martial arts in the bathroom.

239
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:06,300
Ling Lan Hao is a girl.

240
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,260
How embarrassing she is!

241
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,100
I tried you.

242
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,380
I was thinking for you.

243
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:10,620
I'm not trying to do anything.

244
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,020
I'm just trying to help you.

245
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,340
I'm just trying to help you.

246
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:14,700
I'm just trying to help you.

247
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:15,860
I was thinking for you.

248
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,140
As for Ling Lang,

249
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:18,820
I didn't expect that.

250
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:20,860
You're so sweet.

251
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:23,420
Don't you want to know

252
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:25,740
who is the other person in your body?

253
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:26,820
You know?

254
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:28,380
Not yet.

255
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:29,980
But it's certain that

256
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:31,220
you're still you

257
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:32,940
and haven't been controlled by that person.

258
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:34,660
I'm afraid

259
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,300
I'll be that person completely.

260
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,860
Guards, come out!

261
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:40,700
Ling Lang.

262
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:45,540
Go.

263
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:53,660
Did someone pass by just now?

264
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:54,380
I don't know.

265
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:55,460
Did you see that?

266
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:57,220
Go.

267
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:15,580
Lu Jiu.

268
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:18,700
Be careful.

269
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:19,540
Don't do this.

270
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:20,340
Lu Jiu.

271
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:21,100
Lu Jiu.

272
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,100
Lu Jiu.

273
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,700
Ling Lang, are you okay?

274
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:39,460
Why are you crying?

275
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:41,820
I'm not crying.

276
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,020
I'm just crying.

277
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,220
I'm just crying.

278
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:45,900
Si Ma, you...

279
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,420
You almost killed me just now.

280
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:49,180
The inn was just a routine.

281
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:50,740
You suddenly changed and took Ling Lang away.

282
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:51,580
I was kind enough to come after you.

283
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:52,420
But you...

284
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,180
You forgot about us again.

285
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,660
These things

286
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,260
are getting more and more frequent.

287
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:02,940
I feel like

288
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:04,980
I'm going to be another person.

289
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,220
Another person?

290
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:08,140
Did you remember something?

291
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:11,700
Since I fell into the river

292
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:13,900
thirteen years ago,

293
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,540
I don't remember anything.

294
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:18,860
When I woke up, they told me

295
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:19,980
that my name was Lu Jiu,

296
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:21,500
the second young master of the Lu family.

297
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:23,060
But in my heart,

298
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,820
there's always a voice telling me

299
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:26,740
that I'm not Lu Jiu.

300
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:27,980
Maybe

301
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:29,340
your memory has been wrong

302
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,660
since the beginning.

303
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:32,580
Do you remember

304
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:34,220
how you lost your memory?

305
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:36,260
Since I fell into the river,

306
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:38,500
I don't remember anything

307
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:40,420
after I got a fever.

308
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,140
The flying shadow is missing from the object.

309
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,220
There's a river nearby.

310
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,260
If you think so,

311
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:50,380
your memory was told by others.

312
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:51,660
Have you asked for help

313
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:52,900
from other relatives and friends?

314
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:54,140
In my family,

315
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:56,020
there's only my brother and my father.

316
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,460
As for my mother,

317
00:14:58,780 --> 00:14:59,980
my father said

318
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:02,740
that she and my mother were just a couple.

319
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,660
After I was born,

320
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:06,580
he abandoned me.

321
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:09,180
My father spent a lot of effort

322
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:10,660
to find me back.

323
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,340
Lu Kun is so shameless.

324
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,060
He made such a

325
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,620
serious mask for himself.

326
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:19,020
Who doesn't know that he abandoned his original family

327
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:20,180
and cheated the marriage.

328
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:23,700
He even abandoned the third master of Fang Lei Hall.

329
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:25,900
He even abandoned his child.

330
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:28,620
I'm the illegitimate son of my father.

331
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,420
So I'm not close to him.

332
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:33,740
Last time I saw him,

333
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,460
he was the one

334
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:37,420
who put me by my brother's side.

335
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,100
But I'm still grateful to him.

336
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,620
If it weren't for him,

337
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:44,380
I would have died long ago.

338
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,780
You said that your memory was gone seven years ago.

339
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:51,740
And you were suddenly in the state of no return.

340
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,260
There's someone

341
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,100
who's also like that on this reward.

342
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:56,580
Who is it?

343
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,260
It's not true.

344
00:15:58,660 --> 00:15:59,700
The best killer in Tian Luo,

345
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:00,940
the most capable of killing the dark sect,

346
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:02,180
killing people without any punishment,

347
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:04,260
he used Hu Zhao Quan to march the world.

348
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,340
He disappeared five times seven years ago.

349
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:07,940
He's exactly the same age as you.

350
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:09,780
Hu Zhao Quan?

351
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:11,620
There's his portrait up here.

352
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:12,980
Do you want to see it?

353
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,100
Look.

354
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:33,780
The child looks like me

355
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,420
in the rain.

356
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:37,540
If it's not this black paper,

357
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,780
it might be a misunderstanding.

358
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:41,500
If someone asks you

359
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:42,540
if you're Fei Ying,

360
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:44,780
you can tell them

361
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:45,700
you're not.

362
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:47,780
Fine.

363
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,500
Why are you so serious?

364
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:54,300
Did you use Fei Ying's reward order

365
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,700
to test Lu Jiu?

366
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:56,980
That's right.

367
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:58,860
It's a pity that

368
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:01,340
Lu Jiu is a martial artist with no image.

369
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:02,980
But he looks

370
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:04,580
different from Fei Ying.

371
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,860
So it's more likely that

372
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:09,060
Fei Ying has been in the Lu family for years.

373
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,780
He taught Lu Jiu's martial arts.

374
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:14,340
Are you suspecting me?

375
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:17,020
No.

376
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:19,140
I just think

377
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:22,380
it's been a long time since I left Zhang Qing Ling.

378
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:25,180
Why did you just contact me?

379
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:26,140
Don't worry.

380
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:28,260
I didn't forget the medicine you gave me.

381
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:35,940
I've been following you for so long.

382
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:36,940
How could I be bothered

383
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:38,900
by a small medicine?

384
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:41,020
Really?

385
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:42,540
I didn't know

386
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:43,940
you were so loyal to me.

387
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:47,340
I'm loyal to you.

388
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:52,180
You're not loyal to me.

389
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:53,380
You're loyal to the Tang family.

390
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:55,340
Master asked you to help me achieve great things.

391
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,500
Not only are you a good student,

392
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:00,820
you're also loyal to the Tang family.

393
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:02,620
I'm a personal teacher.

394
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:04,540
I value the interests of the Tang family.

395
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:06,420
As a disciple of the Tang family,

396
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:08,540
I'm grateful to you.

397
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:09,820
Although I'm a little strict,

398
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:11,300
I'm sure you'll be happy

399
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:14,900
to see the benefits of the Tang family.

400
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:18,460
Since Lu Jiu isn't Fei Ying,

401
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:21,380
you don't have to waste time on him.

402
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:24,060
Why don't you go back with me to report to the police?

403
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:27,100
Lu Jiu isn't Fei Ying,

404
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:28,780
but he's Li Chu's son.

405
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,540
He's known as Lu Kun's father-in-law, Xu Jiu.

406
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:33,060
He must have a plot.

407
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:36,860
He's not familiar with Fei Ying and Lu Mingcheng.

408
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:40,060
Lu Jiu is our only clue.

409
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,940
You're thoughtful.

410
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,140
I'll leave you to it.

411
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:55,940
Lu Jiu,

412
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:58,180
I can only help you here.

413
00:18:58,740 --> 00:18:59,700
Look at the lanterns.

414
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,300
Look at the lanterns.

415
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:02,940
Look at the lanterns.

416
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,060
Look at them.

417
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:06,860
Miss, look at the lanterns.

418
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:08,860
Here's the candied hawthorn.

419
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:10,740
How is it?

420
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:12,100
Is it delicious?

421
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:12,860
Yes.

422
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,580
Can you buy me more?

423
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:15,420
No problem.

424
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:17,220
I'll buy you more every day.

425
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,340
The past is beautiful.

426
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:24,300
What if Lu Jiu forgets me again

427
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:26,300
after he's addicted to it?

428
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:32,140
It's for you.

429
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:33,660
Handcuffs?

430
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:36,220
You can write down

431
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:37,540
the most important things

432
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:38,580
you want to record on it.

433
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,060
Then you won't forget it.

434
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,140
Lin Lang's hands

435
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,860
are used to remove the body.

436
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:46,140
I didn't expect you to be so good at making handcuffs.

437
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:47,100
Could it be

438
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:48,940
made by human skin?

439
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,300
I just got better for two days.

440
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:51,620
I'm not a human.

441
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:52,780
I'm just a human.

442
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:53,980
I'm just a human.

443
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:55,180
I'm not a human.

444
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:56,460
I'm just a human.

445
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:57,620
I'm just a human.

446
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:58,860
I'm not a human.

447
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:00,020
I'm not a human.

448
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:01,180
I just got better for two days.

449
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:02,380
You can't treat me like this.

450
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,020
Lu Jiu, where are you going?

451
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:15,780
Where are they?

452
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,620
Where are they?

453
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:22,380
Take it.

454
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:26,140
Here.

455
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:27,660
I'll put it on you.

456
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,580
How is it? Is it beautiful?

457
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:31,420
I knew you'd like it.

458
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:32,260
Let's go.

459
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:35,500
Let's buy flowers.

460
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:40,460
Young Master, let's buy flowers.

461
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:42,260
Let's buy them for Yizhong.

462
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:00,860
I'm back.

463
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:04,660
You're back.

464
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:06,980
I went to the forest

465
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:08,700
to hunt a wild feed

466
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:09,980
and have dinner tonight.

467
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,020
You don't even know how to lie.

468
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:15,140
You went out suddenly just now

469
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:16,340
because you were afraid you'd hurt me

470
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,700
when you changed, right?

471
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:18,900
I'm not afraid of that.

472
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,340
I'm just worried that

473
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,420
you'll kill me.

474
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:22,540
I'm not afraid of that.

475
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:23,740
I'm not afraid of that.

476
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,180
I'm not afraid of that.

477
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:26,300
I'm not afraid of that.

478
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:27,580
I'm not afraid of that.

479
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:28,740
I'm not afraid of that.

480
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:29,420
You hurt me

481
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:30,700
when you were in the forest, right?

482
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:33,500
I...

483
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:37,100
I'm afraid I'll forget you.

484
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:38,980
That's not what you think.

485
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:41,460
Besides, every time you forget me,

486
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:42,580
you'll forget me for a while

487
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:44,860
and you'll try to save me again.

488
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:46,620
That's a good thing.

489
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:48,020
But I feel

490
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,660
I'm going to be completely controlled by that person.

491
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:57,980
So I gave you this bracelet.

492
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,620
I'll record the most important things

493
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:00,980
you want to record on it.

494
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,980
So you won't forget me.

495
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:19,020
I will.

496
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:24,100
It's getting late.

497
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:25,780
I'll go cook first.

498
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:58,700
Okay.

499
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:20,460
I'll record the most important things

500
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:22,140
you want to record on it.

501
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:25,940
Because

502
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:27,540
you're the one

503
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:29,260
I can't forget the most.

504
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:33,180
Can you give me this painting?

505
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:44,020
I'll take it as

506
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:45,460
the most important thing to me.

507
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,100
Keep it well.

508
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:56,940
Go.

509
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:09,660
So tired.

510
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:18,500
That...

511
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:21,060
Bargain causing me tight eyes.

512
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:22,180
You don't need to tell me.

513
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:23,860
Seriously.

514
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:25,720
She must have Sasaki's painting.

515
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,400
What?

516
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,880
Let me see what's in your eyes.

517
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,400
No need.

518
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:33,720
Be serious.

519
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,120
Be serious.

520
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,280
You'll hurt Lin Lang

521
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,280
if you change your body several times.

522
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,000
We have to think of a way.

523
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,040
Are you sure

524
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,720
this is the way you said?

525
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,320
Yes.

526
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,200
Lu Jubei is tied up like this.

527
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,080
It's so hard to say.

528
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,000
And

529
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,640
with his power when he changes his body,

530
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,120
even the rope can't hold him.

531
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:57,720
Don't worry.

532
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,280
This is my special rope.

533
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,000
Even a stone can't break it.

534
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,080
I...

535
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:04,960
Sir.

536
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,160
I'm sorry.

537
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,000
Sorry to bother you.

538
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,160
You're busy.

539
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:10,720
No.

540
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:11,400
I...

541
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,280
Look.

542
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,360
You came up with this idea.

543
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,680
Do you have a better idea?

544
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,040
All right.

545
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,080
Let's eat.

546
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,160
You've been taking care of him these days.

547
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,360
You should take good care of yourself.

548
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:24,960
I...

549
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,000
Don't listen to him.

550
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,600
You seem to be rich.

551
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,200
Actually, he'll

552
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,800
ask you to pay double the price.

553
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,440
From today on,

554
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,160
you'll keep all the money.

555
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,280
What do you mean?

556
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,960
I dare not take it

557
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,480
before you make it clear.

558
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,360
I'm not as dark as someone said.

559
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,360
I just think it's more appropriate

560
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,880
to give you the money.

561
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,080
Well...

562
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:55,840
I'm hungry.

563
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:56,680
I want to eat chicken.

564
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:57,520
How much?

565
00:25:58,760 --> 00:25:59,600
Plus the money.

566
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,360
All right.

567
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,440
Let me feed you.

568
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:06,880
Wait.

569
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,200
You've worked so hard.

570
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,040
Leave this little thing

571
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,200
to me.

572
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,600
Eat chicken.

573
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,440
Is this how you feed people?

574
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,640
This is the only way to get the money.

575
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,480
All right.

576
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,640
You two are like children.

577
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,680
Let me feed you.

578
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:46,520
It's good.

579
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,040
It's good.

580
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:48,560
It's good.

581
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,160
It's good.

582
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:49,760
It's good.

583
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:50,360
It's good.

584
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:50,920
It's good.

585
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:51,520
It's good.

586
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,160
It's good.

587
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:52,800
It's good.

588
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,360
It's good.

589
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:58,560
I don't know

590
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,360
if the form that I came often

591
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,880
hiding was right or wrong like this.

592
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,240
But with my friend

593
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,920
disguised as an outsider,

594
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,640
I can't buttons for being all alone.

595
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:09,940
That's all right.

596
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:10,960
Let me feed you.

597
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,040
That's not going to cost me any money.

598
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,460
He's creepy.

599
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:30,380
I'm doting on his murder case though.

600
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,160
He폌 Director,

601
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,580
it's a perfect fit.

602
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:42,180
The scene looks very interesting.

603
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:43,760
About ses happy,

604
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,420
so onions were speakers.

605
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:50,060
The taste is already amazing.

606
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:52,340
Imp厌.

607
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:55,940
I guess he must have guessed it already.

608
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:02,740
Raising a child is like making a machine.

609
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:06,340
Sometimes, if you have a little bit of trouble, just smooth it out.

610
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:10,740
As long as Kong'er can complete this mission,

611
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:13,740
he will still be our Young Sect Leader.

612
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:24,140
Come.

613
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:35,940
If you are really feeling uncomfortable, I will just let you go.

614
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:39,940
It's fine. With you by my side, I can be at ease no matter how sleepy I am.

615
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:40,940
I am very at ease.

616
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:44,340
Then go to sleep. I am right there.

617
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:46,740
Call me if you need me.

618
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:24,740
Where is this place?

619
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:42,740
Bai Ta Si.

620
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:54,740
Bai Ta Si.

621
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:24,740
Bai Ta Si.

622
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:35,340
Ling Lang.

623
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:37,940
Ling Lang.

624
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:39,940
Ling Lang.

625
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:41,940
Ling Lang.

626
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,940
Ling Lang.

627
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:50,740
Shopkeeper, please help me look.

628
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:52,540
Grab some medicine.

629
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:56,340
Miss, you are here to grab medicine again?

630
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:59,340
Your husband's health is not good. He is always taking medicine.

631
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:01,940
He is not my husband. He is just a friend.

632
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:04,540
He must be a very important friend to you.

633
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:06,940
You are willing to give him such a precious medicine.

634
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:09,540
I just discovered a new thing about his illness last night.

635
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:11,940
According to the medical records, there are some adjustments.

636
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:14,540
I don't know that these medicines are very expensive.

637
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:17,940
Shopkeeper, how much are these medicines?

638
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:19,140
Ten taels of silver.

639
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:22,940
Ten taels? It's that expensive?

640
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:25,940
Luckily, Si Ma Kong gave me money.

641
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:30,540
Oh no, why is my wallet missing?

642
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:35,740
Shopkeeper, I didn't bring enough money. Can you give me a credit?

643
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:39,340
I will send it to you when I find my family in the house.

644
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:40,940
The house is so far from here.

645
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:43,740
If I want to wait for you to pay, how long will I wait?

646
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:45,940
Miss, this is a small business.

647
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:48,140
Please forgive me if I don't pay you.

648
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:52,140
You are a doctor. You should be more understanding.

649
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:56,340
Don't touch me!

650
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:01,740
You are a doctor. I just have a little bit of the same face.

651
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:04,940
I just grabbed two bottles of medicine and it's not good. It's even worse.

652
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:08,340
Don't be angry. This medicine needs to be effective.

653
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:12,340
I told you when I grabbed the medicine. I have a business to discuss.

654
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:15,340
Now this guy is really... How am I going to do business?

655
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:18,940
Brother, don't be angry. I also know medical skills.

656
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:21,940
How about you show me the prescription that the shopkeeper gave you?

657
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,940
You are a little girl. You know medical skills?

658
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:26,140
Just show me. You won't suffer any loss anyway.

659
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:29,740
Fine. You two don't look like a team.

660
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:33,140
This is the prescription.

661
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:38,940
The prescription is effective. The amount is fine.

662
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:40,940
Then why is it not good for me to eat?

663
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:44,340
If you trust me, I'll help you take a few needles.

664
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:48,940
Fine. I'm a man. I'm not afraid of taking a few needles.

665
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:52,740
Shopkeeper, can you lend me your needle-like bag?

666
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:55,940
Okay.

667
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:57,140
Okay.

668
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:06,740
It's done.

669
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:07,540
It's done.

670
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:08,940
Really?

671
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:12,140
It's really done. I'm in love.

672
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:14,140
Miss, you are a real doctor.

673
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:16,340
I only took a few needles for emergency.

674
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:19,740
I can only take care of it for half a day. It's enough for you to talk to the shopkeeper.

675
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:23,340
For the future treatment, you have to take the medicine that the shopkeeper gave you.

676
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:24,740
Don't leave any ice in it.

677
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:28,540
Okay. Miss, you really helped me a lot.

678
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:30,540
If my restaurant opens,

679
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:33,740
you have to come and visit me. I have to thank you.

680
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:37,540
Miss, please. The medicine you took just now, I haven't taken it yet.

681
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:39,940
Didn't you say you won't pay for it?

682
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:41,940
It's indeed the rule of the shop.

683
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:44,940
But your money is from your medical bills.

684
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:46,340
Really?

685
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:47,740
It's for the sake of the parents.

686
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:49,540
Thank you, Shopkeeper.

687
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:57,500
Dassoul

688
00:34:54,740 --> 00:35:00,740
A lifetime of dreams, a lifetime of life, a lifetime of life

689
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:06,740
A lifetime of dreams, a lifetime of life, a lifetime of life

690
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:12,740
I will never forget you for the rest of my life

691
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:17,740
I will never let go of your hand, no matter how hard it is

692
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:23,740
A lifetime of dreams, a lifetime of life, a lifetime of life, a lifetime of life

693
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:29,740
A lifetime of dreams, a lifetime of life, a lifetime of life

694
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:35,740
If we can meet again, how will it be?

695
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:45,740
Thank you for looking back at the past with a single glance
