1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,880
Forced love, built to the elder brother

2
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:42,400
The smile bashed

3
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:46,760
I'm sweet

4
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:50,960
Let's say nice

5
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,900
Listen to the interviewees

6
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:58,500
Seize a chance to listen to the song

7
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,660
The wind and you fill my dream

8
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:37,500
Don't hate the old days

9
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:42,900
Two years of love and death

10
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,500
Episode 16

11
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:13,500
Ling Lang.

12
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,100
Why are you here?

13
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:16,900
Stop.

14
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:19,500
Didn't you promise me

15
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,500
not to do anything to Ling Lang?

16
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:21,900
Which eye of yours

17
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,300
saw me doing anything to him?

18
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,700
Didn't you see me tied up?

19
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:26,900
Ling Lang came to help me.

20
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,700
I almost fell off the bed.

21
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:29,300
Really?

22
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,100
Yes.

23
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,900
I just came back from buying medicine.

24
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:32,900
I saw him like this.

25
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:35,900
It's my fault to tie you up.

26
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,700
I made you suffer and tortured you.

27
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:40,900
I'll untie you now.

28
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,900
I have something to tell you two.

29
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,100
What is it?

30
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,500
I lost all the money

31
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,100
you gave me.

32
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:56,300
What?

33
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,300
That's all our money.

34
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,100
Don't believe him.

35
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,100
He must have other money.

36
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:02,900
I'm not lying.

37
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,500
That's all my money.

38
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:05,700
I gave it to Ling Lang.

39
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,700
If I can't eat,

40
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:09,500
I'll take it as my

41
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,500
jewelry jade pendant.

42
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,900
But it's cheap.

43
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,500
It's not worth much.

44
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,300
Jade pendant?

45
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,300
It's cold in the mountain.

46
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,100
Be careful not to catch a cold.

47
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:26,900
Si Meng Kong,

48
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,300
we should be careful.

49
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:28,900
You know?

50
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,100
I'm the one who

51
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,300
has to be careful.

52
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:34,900
Have you had enough?

53
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:57,900
It's here.

54
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:01,900
White Tower Temple.

55
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,100
There's a jade pendant.

56
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,100
We can use it as a pendant.

57
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,100
We'll have a plate.

58
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:23,700
Wait.

59
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,700
This jade pendant is not for you.

60
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:26,700
You can't use it.

61
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,500
Why?

62
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:29,900
Don't you think

63
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,100
it looks familiar?

64
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,100
It's the same as

65
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,300
the jade pendant we found in the Li Mu's house.

66
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,100
It's the account card of the Iron Cloth Store.

67
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,500
Iron Cloth Store?

68
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,100
You mean

69
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,300
the dream of Lu Jiu

70
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,700
and the other person in his memory

71
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:50,900
are related to Iron Cloth Store?

72
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,100
Iron Cloth Store

73
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,500
is the nine-stop Xiang Yun Sand.

74
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,300
We just need to follow this clue.

75
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,500
Then we can find my previous memory

76
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,500
and my brother's missing secret.

77
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,100
They actually went to Iron Cloth Store.

78
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,900
The account card of the Iron Cloth Store's staff.

79
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,500
According to the information from a few days ago,

80
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,300
Xu Lin Lang has no money to catch the medicine.

81
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,500
If they want to continue their journey

82
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,100
and go to the Iron Cloth Store to prepare some money,

83
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,100
it's also possible.

84
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:19,500
Sir,

85
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:20,900
has Xu Lin Lang

86
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,500
not agreed to your proposal?

87
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,700
I just want to remind you

88
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,100
not to trust the bold man.

89
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,700
As long as Tian Luo is still willing to kill,

90
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,300
I can trust Xu Lin Lang.

91
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:30,700
Tian Luo?

92
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,100
The killers we met a few days ago

93
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,900
also killed Xu Lin Lang's father.

94
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,300
They are actually Tian Luo's men.

95
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,100
But

96
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,100
Tian Luo and the Investigation Department

97
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,300
all obeyed His Majesty.

98
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,100
How dare they...

99
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:47,500
I got it.

100
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:48,700
His Highness

101
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,700
asked you to investigate the second-rate official.

102
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:51,700
His Highness

103
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:54,900
asked you to investigate the case of the Thunder Hall 20 years ago.

104
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,500
Could it be that he was worried about Dugu?

105
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:02,300
Dugu was ordered to break into the Thunder Hall 20 years ago.

106
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:05,700
But the treasure of the Unparalleled Precious was always missing.

107
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,100
Could he be the little demon?

108
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,500
Greetings, Mr. Geng.

109
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:16,700
Eunuch Zhao.

110
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:20,500
Minister of Revenue, Mr. Zhou's wife,

111
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,700
sent me here

112
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:24,300
to ask you to return to the capital for investigation.

113
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,300
But what precious items were lost?

114
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,700
There was nothing valuable.

115
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,700
I heard that his concubine

116
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,300
had a private conversation with a servant

117
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,900
and took some money.

118
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,900
Such a small matter

119
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,300
and you even asked Mr. Geng to go back?

120
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,700
I remember now.

121
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,900
When the Ministry of Revenue was appointed,

122
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:46,100
all officials in the capital came to congratulate us.

123
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:49,100
Only Mr. Geng was busy with his work and didn't go.

124
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,700
I'm afraid this time he's looking for revenge.

125
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,300
You are a low-level constable.

126
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,100
What?

127
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,700
You want to disobey the order of Mr. Geng?

128
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,700
Then I have to ask you.

129
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,300
Did you follow the order of His Majesty?

130
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,700
I'm just passing the word of Noble Consort Zhou.

131
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:11,100
Who doesn't know that the Noble Consort is the sister of Mr. Zhou

132
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,900
and is in good health and is in good health?

133
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,900
It turns out that it was the matter of Noble Consort Zhou.

134
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,100
The family paper is calculated.

135
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,700
She begged my father to send her to prison.

136
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,700
It was just a matter of three or four years ago.

137
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,500
My eyes.

138
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:27,500
My eyes.

139
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,300
I didn't recognize it.

140
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,900
It's the Princess.

141
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,100
I'm not a princess now.

142
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,100
I'm the deputy head of the Diancha Department

143
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,700
who specializes in assisting Mr. Geng to handle the case.

144
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,700
You are a princess.

145
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:41,500
How can you...

146
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:42,700
How can you be the one

147
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:45,100
who even you can't look up to?

148
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,300
You're laughing so hard.

149
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,300
You're laughing so hard.

150
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,300
You're laughing so hard.

151
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,500
Go back and tell the brothers and sisters of Noble Consort Zhou

152
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:54,100
that they can handle their own problems.

153
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,100
Don't bother us.

154
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:55,700
Yes.

155
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:02,700
How is it?

156
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,300
I'm better than Xu Linglang, right?

157
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,300
I'm here.

158
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,300
No one dares to tease you.

159
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,900
A Chwen can play the role of a five-foot six.

160
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,900
Chwen is a common coin in the underworld.

161
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,100
It is also used by the iron coin shop to store, collect and store coins.

162
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,700
The silver is easy to be tracked by the court.

163
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:20,700
So the gold-digger

164
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:21,700
uses Chwen to trade.

165
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:22,500
It's naturally valuable.

166
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,100
So

167
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,700
the bag of Chwen of Li Mu

168
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,100
is enough for us to get to the town?

169
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:30,900
No wonder you are so generous

170
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,300
to give the money to Linglang.

171
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,500
So these are all your money.

172
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:36,300
You're so ridiculous.

173
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,900
You're so ridiculous.

174
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:41,100
This is the way to the Iron Coin Shop.

175
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,100
Maybe

176
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,500
the Guzis are nearby.

177
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,500
How can there be such a coincidence?

178
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,300
Right.

179
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:46,900
Eat.

180
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:52,900
This is good.

181
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:53,900
Sit down.

182
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,700
We've worked hard this time.

183
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,300
We've worked hard too.

184
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:58,500
Yes.

185
00:08:58,700 --> 00:08:59,300
Xia'er.

186
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,100
Thank you.

187
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,100
I'll give you all the delicious food

188
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:04,700
you have picked.

189
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:05,900
No, no.

190
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:06,900
Thank you.

191
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:08,900
I'm so tired.

192
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,300
Especially the roasted chicken.

193
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,300
It looks delicious.

194
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,500
Wait.

195
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:13,700
Just four buns.

196
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:14,900
Okay.

197
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:15,700
My lord.

198
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,100
I'm so busy.

199
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,500
I can't eat all the food.

200
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,300
You can eat all of it?

201
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,300
I'm not a pig.

202
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,700
Of course I can't eat all of it.

203
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:22,900
I can eat one bite each.

204
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,300
I just need the leftover ingredients.

205
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,700
Do you know how many people

206
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,100
can't eat half of the meal in the world?

207
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,900
I'm wrong.

208
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,100
I thought you were really sincere.

209
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,100
If I knew it,

210
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:33,900
I would have asked the eunuch

211
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,300
to take you back to the capital.

212
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,300
My lord.

213
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,700
Why are you taking me back again?

214
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,100
I don't want to eat.

215
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,100
When you go back,

216
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,100
we'll go there again.

217
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:42,900
Eat.

218
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,500
Eat.

219
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:12,300
There's a way to the iron cup shop.

220
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:23,300
Xia'er.

221
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:24,700
Okay.

222
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,100
Miss.

223
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,500
The guest asked you to pack it.

224
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,300
Please take it.

225
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,100
I'm not going to take it.

226
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,500
I'm going to pack it.

227
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,300
It's always like this.

228
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,500
It's always annoying.

229
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:56,100
The iron cup shop of the Dark Lord of Jiang Hu

230
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,900
is surrounded by black and white.

231
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,900
The gold and silver are more than a few times of the national treasury.

232
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,700
But no one dares to touch it.

233
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,900
This is the iron cup shop?

234
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:04,900
Yeah.

235
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:06,700
Are you sure?

236
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,540
The most dangerous place

237
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:10,220
is the safest place.

238
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,180
You're right.

239
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:13,900
It's easier to get into trouble

240
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,420
than to have a drink with someone.

241
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:17,660
The rule of the Iron Cloth Store is

242
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:19,660
that a jade pendant

243
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:20,660
corresponds to one person's income.

244
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:21,620
Take it.

245
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:23,540
What about you?

246
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:24,820
I'll use my own money.

247
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,700
He said he'd store all his money in the bank account.

248
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,020
But it's the Iron Cloth Store.

249
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,260
No wonder he suggested

250
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,660
coming to the Iron Cloth Store.

251
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,640
Soyalah CCN

252
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,980
At Sanha particularly this time.

253
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,980
I would rather have hard work and poor games.

254
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:49,260
Help me look at my budget.

255
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:49,780
OK.

256
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:54,780
Your account roasts 2,300 silver dollars.

257
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,820
I didn't know the tomb was so rich.

258
00:11:58,540 --> 00:11:58,980
No.

259
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:00,340
I'm paying the floods.

260
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:02,980
It turns out

261
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,500
you're a retired servant.

262
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,380
Don't use this excuses to look down on me.

263
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:07,460
I'll pay you.

264
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:08,500
Let's get to the point.

265
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,460
Please come in.

266
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,780
Come on, come on.

267
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:40,020
Come on, come on.

268
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:41,700
It's been years.

269
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:42,820
Fei Ying,

270
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:45,500
I didn't expect you to show up again.

271
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:48,060
Come on, come on.

272
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:48,900
Buy some gifts.

273
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:49,900
Buy some gifts.

274
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:50,860
Buy some gifts.

275
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:51,740
Come on, come on.

276
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:52,580
Come on, come on.

277
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:53,780
One, two, three, four.

278
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:56,420
Don't let anyone know

279
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:57,100
that you two

280
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,620
are the same old guys.

281
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:00,860
I want to know

282
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,180
who you are, Si Ma Ke.

283
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:04,700
You have so much money.

284
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,060
When I asked you for money,

285
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:07,060
why didn't you agree?

286
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:13,060
Do you really want to know?

287
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,220
Of course.

288
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:14,940
Then I can

289
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:15,980
check myself.

290
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:17,260
I'll change it no matter what.

291
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:18,580
Next time when I ask you for money,

292
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:19,580
you'll lend it to me.

293
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:22,860
I'm not not lending it to you.

294
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:23,860
I'm not lending it to everyone.

295
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,140
I save money because I like it.

296
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:27,900
Your hobby is quite strange.

297
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,980
I think money is more reliable than people.

298
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,460
You must have experienced something

299
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:32,980
to not believe others.

300
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:33,860
But luckily,

301
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:34,980
you have us in the future.

302
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,540
Why are you like Lu Jiu?

303
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,020
I'm not like him.

304
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:40,820
I just want to comfort you.

305
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:41,820
That's all.

306
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:46,420
I don't need your comfort.

307
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:47,220
Si Ma Ke,

308
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,180
why do you always wear

309
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:49,740
a cold mask to cover yourself?

310
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,060
Cover myself?

311
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,180
I'm always like this.

312
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:55,340
You're a cover.

313
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:57,220
When you met Li Mu and Lian Beci,

314
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,220
you risked your life to save them.

315
00:13:58,540 --> 00:13:58,940
No,

316
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,100
and earlier in the tea house,

317
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:00,740
when you saw someone

318
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:01,580
smuggling our foreign goods

319
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:02,540
to help us,

320
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:03,340
you were never

321
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:04,140
a cold-hearted person.

322
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,100
What kind of person I am is important?

323
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:09,300
Of course it's important.

324
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:11,860
We're brothers.

325
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:13,860
Who are you to be a brother?

326
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:14,980
When we're done,

327
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:15,980
I'll throw you out.

328
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:19,980
Please come this way.

329
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:25,540
This way, please.

330
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:29,060
Please.

331
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:31,140
Be polite.

332
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:38,340
Be polite.

333
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:42,340
Be polite.

334
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:46,340
Be polite.

335
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:46,980
Please.

336
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:49,420
Young Master,

337
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,420
you may come in.

338
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:54,140
This way, please.

339
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,620
Si Ma, this way, please.

340
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:08,060
I'll be back soon.

341
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:13,420
I understand.

342
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:14,540
We understand the rules.

343
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:15,420
Okay.

344
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:31,860
I wonder how much money

345
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,060
is hidden here.

346
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:33,980
Here?

347
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:35,620
It's not just the gold and silver.

348
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:37,700
Many people in the martial arts world

349
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:38,580
have some secrets.

350
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,900
Maybe they'll hide their secrets

351
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,020
here.

352
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,140
I found this waistband

353
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,340
in my dream.

354
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:53,420
Maybe my secret

355
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,300
is hidden here.

356
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:56,820
Let's try it.

357
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:07,620
Be careful.

358
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:11,420
Be careful.

359
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:15,380
Be careful.

360
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:22,340
Be careful.

361
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:26,940
Young Master, you may come in.

362
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:29,380
I want to see.

363
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:29,980
Check it.

364
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,060
Let me check it out.

365
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:42,580
The owner of the envinflator

366
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:44,220
is not a match with her information.

367
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:46,100
You aren't allowed to go in

368
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,220
according to the rules of themates.

369
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:48,340
Sorry.

370
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,140
Why do you mention going in?

371
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:55,340
Maybe

372
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:57,620
I'm the real owner

373
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:58,580
of this envinflator.

374
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:26,860
Xia Men,

375
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:31,020
He's using this secret weapon to remind me

376
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:32,460
that the Tang Gate is the most important mission.

377
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,460
Otherwise, I'll be like Lu Jiu

378
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,740
who's chasing after the Tang Gate secretly.

379
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,540
The iron armory in the Ming Dynasty

380
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:49,780
is so simple.

381
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:51,740
I know.

382
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:53,860
It's to cover someone's ears.

383
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:57,060
But it's so secretive

384
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,820
that it's a mess.

385
00:17:58,860 --> 00:17:59,380
What?

386
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:00,100
I know.

387
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,220
Because most of the money

388
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,820
is used in the iron armory.

389
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:05,420
It's convenient to have a chat

390
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:06,820
and do things.

391
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:10,100
Sir, do you have anything to say?

392
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,340
You've said everything.

393
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,340
Do I need to say anything?

394
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:17,660
But the iron armory is so messy.

395
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:19,580
There should be more people in it.

396
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,900
Why did you take me out alone

397
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,140
from the Hall of Contemplation?

398
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:25,780
Is it to avoid the eyes of the Heavenly Dragon

399
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:26,980
in the collusion?

400
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:28,540
Not only that.

401
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,420
Why?

402
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:32,780
Have you heard of the secret recipe

403
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:34,100
to lure the people to be the officials?

404
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,860
Secret recipe?

405
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:41,860
It's to break the secret recipe.

406
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:55,620
Why didn't you steal the lock?

407
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:56,620
You don't have much money.

408
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:59,260
Did the people in the iron armory

409
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:00,460
steal the lock

410
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:01,460
and take your money?

411
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:02,980
I'll go to them.

412
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:04,980
It's none of your business.

413
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,020
Why are you so agitated?

414
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,380
Why is it none of my business?

415
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,700
Your business is my business.

416
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:12,980
All right.

417
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:14,340
I have enough money.

418
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:16,620
But don't think that you'll help me

419
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:17,700
to get the money because I don't have enough money.

420
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:19,460
Is that what you look like?

421
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:22,340
It's my turn now.

422
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,180
Did something happen?

423
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:26,420
I'll go to the Hall of Contemplation

424
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:27,380
to learn the art of culture.

425
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:28,980
I'm the master of this jade pendant.

426
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:30,980
It seems that my identity

427
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,820
might be hidden in this vault.

428
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:36,660
I'll go in with you.

429
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:39,460
I'll wait for your good news here.

430
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:57,060
Right.

431
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:02,660
Sir.

432
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:06,980
Why are you so careless?

433
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:07,660
I'm in a hurry.

434
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:08,180
Take him down.

435
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:13,500
The rule of the iron armory

436
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,500
is to kill the person who made the fake one.

437
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,060
That's killing someone.

438
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:21,060
That's killing someone.

439
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:22,060
That's killing someone.

440
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:23,060
That's killing someone.

441
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:24,060
That's killing someone.

442
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:25,060
That's killing someone.

443
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:26,060
That's killing someone.

444
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,100
That's killing someone.

445
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,100
That's killing someone.

446
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,100
That's killing someone.

447
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,100
Why did he come out here?

448
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,100
Why did he come out here?

449
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,100
Everyone is suspicious.

450
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,100
That's right.

451
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,100
That's right.

452
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,100
That's right.

453
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,100
I think I'm in the wrong.

454
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,100
That's right.

455
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,100
How dare you!

456
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:41,100
Don't you need to pass the government?

457
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:43,100
This is our rule.

458
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,100
I see.

459
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,100
I'm sorry to let you suffer.

460
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,100
I have something else to do.

461
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,100
Please do as you please.

462
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,100
The iron armory

463
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:55,100
is indeed an outlandish place.

464
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,100
I'm sorry.

465
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:58,100
I'm sorry.

466
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,100
I'm sorry.

467
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,100
I'm sorry.

468
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,100
I'm sorry.

469
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,100
I'm sorry.

470
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,100
I'm sorry.

471
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,100
I'm sorry.

472
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,100
I'm sorry.

473
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,100
I'm sorry.

474
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,100
I'm sorry.

475
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,100
I'm sorry.

476
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,100
I'm sorry.

477
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:10,100
I'm sorry.

478
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,100
I'm sorry.

479
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,100
I'm sorry.

480
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,100
I'm sorry.

481
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,100
I'm sorry.

482
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,100
I'm sorry.

483
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,100
I'm sorry.

484
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,100
I'm sorry.

485
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,100
I'm sorry.

486
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,100
I'm sorry.

487
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,100
I'm sorry.

488
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,100
I'm sorry.

489
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,100
I'm sorry.

490
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,100
I'm sorry.

491
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,100
I'm sorry.

492
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,100
I'm sorry.

493
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:26,900
I'm so sorry.

494
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,500
I'm sorry.

495
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,500
I'm sorry.

496
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,500
I'm sorry.

497
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,500
I'm sorry.

498
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,500
I'm sorry.

499
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,100
This is your other memories' secret.

500
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,100
We need to thank Lin Mu.

501
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:56,100
I think I left a passport mark

502
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,100
in the tomb.

503
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,100
You're so skillful.

504
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:04,100
It seems that you often

505
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:06,100
bring it with you when you go there.

506
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,100
It's a long way to go.

507
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,100
Take a seat.

508
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,100
I'm sorry.

509
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,100
I'm sorry.

510
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,100
I'm sorry.

511
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,100
I've been waiting for you.

512
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:35,100
This way, please.

513
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,100
Oh no.

514
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,100
Gengchao is here.

515
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,100
It's dangerous to get caught.

516
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,100
Come on. Buy some gifts.

517
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,100
Buy some gifts.

518
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,100
Come on.

519
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,100
Come on.

520
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,100
Come on.

521
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:51,100
One, two, three.

522
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:53,100
Buy some gifts.

523
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,100
What's wrong?

524
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,100
I...

525
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,100
Don't be afraid.

526
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:01,100
I'm here.

527
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,100
Follow me.

528
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,100
Miss Xue.

529
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,100
Why did you say yes?

530
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:13,100
I didn't hide from you.

531
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,100
I'm secretly looking for Feiyin.

532
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,100
Feiyin?

533
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,100
Yes.

534
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:21,100
Feiyin disappeared seven years ago.

535
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,100
He's hiding here

536
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,100
because he's hiding from the secret.

537
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:31,100
What are you doing?

538
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,100
Are you going to let him

539
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,100
deal with Gengchao alone?

540
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,100
Where have you been?

541
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,100
You and I are not

542
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:37,100
Gengchao's opponents.

543
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,100
At this time,

544
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,100
we can only kill each other.

545
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,100
So I'm sure

546
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,100
Feiyin is here.

547
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,100
As for why there's no

548
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,100
trace of Feiyin,

549
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,100
firstly, because

550
00:23:52,100 --> 00:24:07,180
people in the world are afraid of Iron Clad

551
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:08,100
and secondly, because

552
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,100
all the gossipers are killed.

553
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:11,100
Why does Mr. Geng look at me like this?

554
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,100
I didn't see the wrong person.

555
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:14,100
You lied in front of me.

556
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,100
You're so calm and logical.

557
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,100
You're a good girl.

558
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,100
Come on.

559
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,100
Go.

560
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,100
Don't fight.

561
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,100
Come on.

562
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,100
Come on.

563
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,100
Come on.

564
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,100
Are you blind?

565
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,100
Who are you?

566
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,100
Hit him.

567
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,100
Stop fighting.

568
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,100
Stop fighting.

569
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,100
Stop fighting.

570
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,100
Stop fighting.

571
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,100
Stop fighting.

572
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:52,100
Stop fighting.

573
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,100
Stop fighting.

574
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,100
Those who are in the world are dead.

575
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:58,100
Don't enter Iron Clad.

576
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,100
Why don't you care about that person?

577
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:06,100
Hand over your iron clad jade.

578
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,100
Or get out of here.

579
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,100
The world is not a land.

580
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,100
The Diancha Bureau is under the order

581
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,100
to arrest the criminals.

582
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,100
Who dares to stop them?

583
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:15,100
What's the Diancha Bureau?

584
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,100
Black and white, two ways.

585
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,100
Only recognize gold and silver.

586
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:18,100
Even if Geng Zhao comes,

587
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,100
you have to bow your head.

588
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,100
Yes.

589
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:24,100
I'm Geng Zhao.

590
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,100
He is...

591
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:28,100
He is...

592
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,100
I don't know where this secret passage

593
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:40,100
can lead to.

594
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:41,100
As long as we don't meet Geng Zhao,

595
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:42,100
we can do anything.

596
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,100
Go.

597
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,100
Sir.

598
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,100
I didn't expect you to be so powerful

599
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,100
in the world.

600
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,100
Then why didn't we

601
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:58,100
follow you?

602
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,100
You are a girl.

603
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:01,100
You should be careful when you are out to do business.

604
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,100
Don't go forward without any reason.

605
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,100
The world is different from the court.

606
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,100
Sir.

607
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:08,100
You didn't continue to entangle with them

608
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,100
because you cared about me.

609
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:13,100
I'm your master.

610
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,100
What's wrong with caring about you?

611
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,100
I can't do that.

612
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:17,100
Sir.

613
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,100
You promised to take me as your disciple.

614
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,100
I will follow you to investigate the case

615
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,100
and be your spy.

616
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:25,100
No.

617
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:27,100
I mean,

618
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:29,100
I won't embarrass you.

619
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,100
But, sir.

620
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,100
I have a question.

621
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,100
I've been wanting to ask you.

622
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:34,100
How can there be a place

623
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:35,100
like an iron wall

624
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:37,100
under the sky?

625
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,100
The world is big.

626
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,100
There are many things.

627
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,100
It's not the law that can solve it.

628
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,100
Once the world loses its balance,

629
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,100
it provokes the opposition

630
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,100
to the court.

631
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,100
In the end,

632
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,100
the people suffer the most.

633
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:50,100
Our investigation department

634
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,100
is to solve these problems.

635
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,100
So,

636
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,100
we can't set an enemy.

637
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:55,100
We can only take action.

638
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,100
Since you call me master,

639
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,100
I have to teach you something.

640
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,100
Iron wall painting?

641
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,100
Sir.

642
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,100
You are really good at it.

643
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,100
You are really good at it.

644
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,100
It's you.

645
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:22,100
Why did you pretend to be a ghost?

646
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,100
If I didn't do that,

647
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,100
I wouldn't look like a bad guy.

648
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:27,100
You are really a joke.

649
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,100
If you were a bad guy,

650
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,100
why would you stop us from doing it?

651
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:34,100
Although the iron wall is an illegal place,

652
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:36,100
we can't go against the court.

653
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,100
Coincidentally,

654
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,100
this lady saw something

655
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,100
that shouldn't be seen.

656
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,100
I can only

657
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,100
send your bodies

658
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:45,100
to the execution ground.

659
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,100
We were killed by the evil people.

660
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,100
That's why we are in the underworld.

661
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,100
If you dare to let us go,

662
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,100
I, Lu Jiu, will be loyal.

663
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,100
Lu Jiu?

664
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:58,100
Luoyang County's richest man,

665
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:59,100
Lu Jia's second son.

666
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:02,100
He killed his brother's evil disciple.

667
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,100
He sent you to the government.

668
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:08,100
He can also make a favor for my iron wall painting.

669
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,100
It seems that I can only bother you,

670
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:11,100
and you will shut up forever.

671
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,100
Didn't you say

672
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,100
that you hate to solve problems

673
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:15,100
by killing people?

674
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:18,100
Killing one person can save us three.

675
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,100
It's worth it.

676
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,100
But we can't kill anyone.

677
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,100
I'm only trying to kill people

678
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:24,100
to protect my honor.

679
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,100
I don't want this to happen.

680
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:28,100
I've been guarding the iron wall for ten years.

681
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:33,100
I've seen a lot of people like you.

682
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,100
But you are forced to do so.

683
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,100
You are still soft-hearted.

684
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,100
But after that person,

685
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,100
only you.

686
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:44,100
That person?

687
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,100
Do you mean

688
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,100
you are willing to let us go?

689
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:50,100
If I can talk so well,

690
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:51,100
can the iron wall shop

691
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:53,100
still be opened?

692
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,100
Shopkeeper,

693
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,100
the iron wall shop is the source of

694
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,100
a lot of drug dealers wanted by the government.

695
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:59,100
Don't you think the government will know?

696
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,100
So what?

697
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,100
The reason why the government

698
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:04,100
is so open-minded

699
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,100
is to use the iron wall shop

700
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:07,100
to maintain the balance of the underworld.

701
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,100
But the noise outside

702
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,100
is the most ungrateful person

703
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,100
in the police department.

704
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:12,100
If things are exposed,

705
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,100
what will happen?

706
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,100
Shopkeeper.

707
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:19,100
They are the ones who are...

708
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:22,100
Take them away quickly.

709
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:25,100
This way, please.

710
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,100
Lord Geng.

711
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,100
It's been a long time.

712
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:42,100
I didn't expect that the people in the police department

713
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:44,100
also like to go to the dark door.

714
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,100
We are upright.

715
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:47,100
If you didn't deliberately stop us,

716
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,100
how could we go to the dark door?

717
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:50,100
I'm the only one in the secret passage.

718
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:53,100
If you don't believe me,

719
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:55,100
you can go and have a look.

720
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:58,100
But if you can't find

721
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:59,100
the person you are looking for,

722
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:01,100
don't blame us for not giving the police department

723
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,100
the respect.

724
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,100
There is no one in front of us.

725
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:11,100
Did we make a mistake?

726
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,100
Shopkeeper.

727
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:38,100
Shopkeeper.

728
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,100
You really let those young people go.

729
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:43,100
Aren't you afraid that the police department will take the blame?

730
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,100
The iron wall warehouse

731
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:47,100
was almost taken over by Tian Luo.

732
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:49,100
Someone let me go.

733
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:51,100
I will return this favor

734
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,100
to him.

735
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:05,100
That was really a surprise.

736
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:07,100
We almost got caught by Lord Geng.

737
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:08,100
Ling Lang.

738
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:10,100
What did you just tell Geng Zhao?

739
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:12,100
How could she let you go so easily?

740
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:13,100
I told her that

741
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:15,100
Fei Ying was in the iron wall warehouse.

742
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:19,100
And thanks to the reward you brought back.

743
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:21,100
Except for the three of us,

744
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:23,100
I only remember the one called Fei Ying.

745
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:26,100
The assassin alliance rewarded him with so many rewards.

746
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:28,100
He must be a big man.

747
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:30,100
He really tricked Lord Geng.

748
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:34,100
But you and Geng Zhao are not related.

749
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,100
Why would she

750
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:37,100
trust you so easily?

751
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,100
Because

752
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:42,100
she used to call me her spy.

753
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:44,100
She was by your side

754
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:46,100
and informed her.

755
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:49,100
During the foresting?

756
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:50,100
Yes.

757
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:54,100
You have been working for the police department since you were little.

758
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:56,100
Geng Zhao is also your model.

759
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,100
I am just a fugitive.

760
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:58,100
You are also

761
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:00,100
a regular.

762
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:02,100
I won't betray you.

763
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:05,100
Then why did you have an affair with her?

764
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,100
Could it be that Geng Zhao

765
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:07,100
threatened you?

766
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,100
No.

767
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:11,100
Lord Geng never threatened me.

768
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:12,100
I should thank him instead.

769
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:14,100
If it wasn't for him,

770
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,100
I wouldn't have known that my father

771
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,100
was killed by the people of Tian Luo.

772
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:21,100
Then

773
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:22,100
are you going to

774
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:25,100
seek revenge on Tian Luo?

775
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:27,100
I haven't thought about it.

776
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:29,100
Now, with my ability,

777
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:31,100
I can't even compete with Tian Luo.

778
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:32,100
If you want to take revenge,

779
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:33,100
I will be one of you.

780
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,100
At the worst, we will work together

781
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:35,100
to kill Tian Luo one by one.

782
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:36,100
Then

783
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:37,100
you are not going to

784
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,100
make the sound of the script.

785
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,100
I mean...

786
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:40,100
I understand.

787
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:42,100
But

788
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,100
if we also

789
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:45,100
fight with our hands,

790
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:47,100
what's the difference

791
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,100
between the evil people of Tian Luo and us?

792
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,100
There are people

793
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,100
who are ambushed

794
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,100
near the iron wall.

795
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:59,100
We will split up.

796
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:00,100
After an hour,

797
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:02,100
we will meet at the hill.

798
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,100
I'm sorry.

799
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:27,100
I'm sorry.

800
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:28,100
I'm sorry.

801
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,100
I'm sorry.

802
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,100
I'm sorry.

803
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:31,100
I'm sorry.

804
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:32,100
I'm sorry.

805
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,100
I'm sorry.

806
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:34,100
I'm sorry.

807
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:35,100
I'm sorry.

808
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:36,100
I'm sorry.

809
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:37,100
I'm sorry.

810
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:38,100
I'm sorry.

811
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:39,100
I'm sorry.

812
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:40,100
I'm sorry.

813
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:41,100
I'm sorry.

814
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:42,100
I'm sorry.

815
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:43,100
I'm sorry.

816
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:44,100
I'm sorry.

817
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:45,100
I'm sorry.

818
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,100
I'm sorry.

819
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:47,100
I'm sorry.

820
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,100
I'm sorry.

821
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:49,100
I'm sorry.

822
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,100
I'm sorry.

823
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,100
I'm sorry.

824
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:52,100
I'm sorry.

825
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:53,100
I'm sorry.

826
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,100
I'm sorry.

827
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:55,100
I'm sorry.

828
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:56,100
I'm sorry.

829
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,100
I'm sorry.

830
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:58,100
I'm sorry.

831
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:59,100
I'm sorry.

832
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:00,100
I'm sorry.

833
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:01,100
I'm sorry.

834
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,100
I'm sorry.

835
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,100
I'm sorry.

836
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,100
I'm sorry.

837
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:05,100
I'm sorry.

838
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,100
I'm sorry.

839
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:07,100
I'm sorry.

840
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:08,100
I'm sorry.

841
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:09,100
I'm sorry.

842
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:10,100
I'm sorry.

843
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:11,100
