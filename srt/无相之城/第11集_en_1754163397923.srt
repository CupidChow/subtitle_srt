1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,400
As if they are all fake

2
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,820
you wake up in spring wind

3
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:39,820
Our smiles are just like insects

4
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:43,740
My touching melancholy

5
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:46,560
I must move forward

6
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:49,080
Don't lose focus

7
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,740
Don't think too much

8
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:53,980
Shirks say they know

9
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,160
I go first to 데酒

10
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:55,660
with you

11
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:58,560
Go back in time to listen to a lighttop

12
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:03,560
But who is behind me?

13
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:08,560
Ten thousand taels of silver, ten thousand pieces of gold

14
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:13,560
The rain is falling, the rain is falling, the rain is falling

15
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:18,560
The moon is blue, the moon is blue, the moon is blue

16
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,560
The little window of the heart is lit up

17
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:28,560
The rain is falling, the rain is falling, the rain is falling

18
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,560
The night wind and you are my dreams

19
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:38,560
Don't hate the old days

20
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,560
Two years of love and death

21
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:58,560
The Long Ballad

22
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,560
Episode 16

23
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:19,560
So at the beginning, my brother pretended to escape without me

24
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:24,560
He knew I was a burden

25
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,560
No

26
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:37,560
Lu Jiu and the Tieluo killer Fei Ying are not the same person

27
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,560
That's why I hid this from you

28
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,560
You can hide it for a lifetime

29
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,560
You can't hide it for a lifetime

30
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,560
I have to face it myself

31
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,560
Do you want to investigate it?

32
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,560
Yes

33
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,560
If I am the murderer of the killer, I will turn myself in

34
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,560
Ok

35
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,560
I will investigate it with you

36
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,560
I have another thing to ask you for help

37
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,560
Don't tell Lin Lang

38
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,560
Why?

39
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:26,560
I have another person in my mind recently

40
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,560
No, Lin Lang is still outside

41
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,560
Tonight, none of you can leave here alive

42
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,560
You didn't even have time to dress up

43
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,560
Are you worried about me?

44
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,560
I

45
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,560
Why do you still keep this painting?

46
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,560
You gave it to me

47
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,560
It's my business to deal with it

48
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,560
I am afraid that you will be in danger

49
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,560
I am afraid that you will be in danger

50
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:22,560
I am afraid that my memory of you will be blurred like this painting

51
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,560
Then I will let you recognize me again

52
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,560
With the Tang Honglu and Zhu Banggu

53
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,560
Then I will draw a new one for you

54
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,560
No need

55
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,560
Lu Jiu, come and help

56
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,560
Let's go out and help him

57
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,560
Si Ma Kong is still injured

58
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,560
You bastard, I thought you were going to escape again

59
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,560
I have to tell you when I wear a dress

60
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,560
I have said it many times, I have left a note

61
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,560
I believe what you said when you dressed them

62
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,560
It's a deal

63
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,560
You

64
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,560
What are you waiting for?

65
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,560
Take out your kung fu

66
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,560
I didn't say it

67
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,560
No

68
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,560
You are a master of poison

69
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,560
You want to play tricks in front of me

70
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,560
You should drink more milk

71
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,560
I can do it

72
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,560
You can do it

73
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,560
Lu Jiu

74
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,560
Lu Jiu

75
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,560
There are four maps of the Five-Faith Treasures

76
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,560
There is one in the hands of the North Fu and Li Chu

77
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,560
Except for one of Feng Lei Hall

78
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,560
The location is unknown

79
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,560
There is another one

80
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,560
Wandering the world

81
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,560
Recently I found that map

82
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:25,560
In the hands of Mr. Wen, Yin Guai in Jiangnan

83
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,560
I will take it back for father

84
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,560
I will take the map

85
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:33,560
Ok, I will reward you

86
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,560
By the way, this is your favorite white sugar cake

87
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,560
I prepared it for you

88
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,560
Eat it before you go

89
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,560
Thank you father

90
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,560
City leader

91
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,560
Father is busy with work

92
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,560
I will leave now

93
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,560
You should go to catch the fly eagle

94
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,560
I will go to catch the fly eagle

95
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,560
Fly

96
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,560
I told you to catch the fly eagle

97
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,560
But you failed

98
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,560
You even alerted the committee

99
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,560
City leader, calm down

100
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,560
Although the fly eagle has recovered his memory

101
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,560
But his kung fu is still in good condition

102
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,560
In the prison

103
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,560
Except for the city leader and the lady

104
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,560
Do you have any worries?

105
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,560
I have a dream

106
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,560
I am dreaming

107
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,560
You are awake

108
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,560
I seem to have had a dream

109
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,560
I dreamt of a woman

110
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,560
It is

111
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,560
I take care of the body here

112
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,560
But you have a dream of a ghost

113
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,920
You really didn't see that woman?

114
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,720
No.

115
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,360
Then maybe

116
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,480
I really had a dream.

117
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,400
You didn't react well this time.

118
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,600
You still have the mood to have a dream.

119
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,400
Let me have a rest.

120
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:18,960
I...

121
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,040
Why?

122
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,040
This bed is mine.

123
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,280
I want it, too.

124
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:25,720
Take it together.

125
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:26,920
I...

126
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,000
I...

127
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,360
It must be a wound that has been cracked.

128
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,280
Let me check it for you.

129
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,880
You two are so strange today.

130
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,040
You were so powerful before.

131
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,200
But you were not hurt.

132
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,240
Why is it so serious this time?

133
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,440
That's because I want to save you.

134
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,520
Then you two were in the bathroom

135
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,440
for so long

136
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,640
that you left me alone outside.

137
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,040
By the way,

138
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,120
you two were in the bathroom for so long.

139
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,080
What were you talking about?

140
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,720
Nothing.

141
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,880
We were just discussing the future.

142
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,360
I think that's the reason

143
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,040
why he is hiding Lin Long for the time being.

144
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,400
Thanks to you, Lin Long.

145
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,840
I didn't expect that you can use dark energy

146
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,720
better than me.

147
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,240
I'm not good at using dark energy.

148
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,080
I just read the death theory in medical books.

149
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,200
I just didn't try it before

150
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,200
and just ran into bad luck.

151
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,360
But the poison is really powerful.

152
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,600
Why didn't you use it before?

153
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,600
This is my last move.

154
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,800
I won't use it unless I have to.

155
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,480
Then why did you use it so easily today?

156
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,360
Seeing you in danger,

157
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,400
I can't care about that much.

158
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:47,760
All right.

159
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,320
I'll go to the bathroom.

160
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,160
I'll go to the bathroom.

161
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,080
Don't worry about those

162
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,280
details.

163
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,000
Didn't you find that

164
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,160
the assassin is different today?

165
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,760
What did you find?

166
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,520
The assassin we met before

167
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,760
was very cunning.

168
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,720
But he just wanted to take my uniform back.

169
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,120
And today's assassin

170
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,960
wants to kill us.

171
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,680
We know the assassin is in the dark.

172
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,120
We can't sit and wait.

173
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,400
We have to take action.

174
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,560
Young Master, please don't be angry.

175
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,600
Sang San Niang and Gu Wen Tu

176
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,440
are the top assassins

177
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,480
of the Assassination Alliance.

178
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,000
If Xu Ling Lang and Sima Kong

179
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
hadn't protected them,

180
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,600
we would have been taken by Young Master.

181
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,480
Lu Jiu's instinct will only

182
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,520
be triggered by the death of Guan Tao.

183
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,520
If we let him reach Wuzhen

184
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,120
smoothly,

185
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,160
we won't have any chance.

186
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,280
While those two old guys

187
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,120
don't know the key to

188
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,280
the recovery of Fei Ying,

189
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,120
we have to hurry up

190
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,120
and take action.

191
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,040
Young Master, you mean...

192
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,120
They didn't want to take him back to Wuzhen.

193
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,800
Are you looking for the missing

194
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,480
five-way treasure seven years ago?

195
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,680
I'll help them.

196
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,200
Be careful.

197
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,520
They must have never thought

198
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,800
that the mechanism we designed for them

199
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,920
was a drug that can

200
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,800
make people sick.

201
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,800
They must be

202
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,840
as strong as a monkey now.

203
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,120
I didn't know how to do martial arts

204
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:27,920
when I first started on the road.

205
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,360
I was afraid I would drag you down.

206
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,720
I didn't expect that the incense

207
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,000
could be useful.

208
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,360
Your incense craft,

209
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,240
my medicine,

210
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,840
and Sima Kong's mechanism design

211
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,320
will make them

212
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,520
see our power.

213
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,960
You are kind and kind.

214
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,080
Even if you are an assassin,

215
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,120
you can't kill them.

216
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,560
You just play with them

217
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,120
and slow down their pace.

218
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,360
Everything in the world

219
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,400
is a game of chess.

220
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,400
You can't kill them.

221
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,960
Everything in the world is spiritual.

222
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,920
Although they are assassins,

223
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,280
they only obey their fate.

224
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,200
No one is willing to be an assassin

225
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,280
when they are born.

226
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,400
All right.

227
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,200
When we arrive at Wuzhen,

228
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,720
all the mystery will be solved.

229
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,560
There are still a dozen days

230
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,320
before we arrive at Wuzhen.

231
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,120
There is no time to try the formation.

232
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,040
Why don't we buy some things

233
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,280
and go on the road?

234
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,000
All right.

235
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,720
We just got the money from the iron armory.

236
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,840
We haven't had time to use it yet.

237
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,280
Why are you looking at me?

238
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,240
I only know how to make money.

239
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:17,920
I won't spend money.

240
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:19,960
All right.

241
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,160
Let me show you

242
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,280
how cool kids

243
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,280
spend money.

244
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,280
Let's go.

245
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,040
Miss, look.

246
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,240
These are all top-grade fabrics.

247
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,640
What do you think?

248
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,000
It's a bit too bright.

249
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:36,840
Look at this color.

250
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,440
Is it pretty?

251
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,240
It's so pretty.

252
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,480
Look.

253
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,480
This one is so pretty.

254
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,040
It looks good.

255
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,200
Try it on.

256
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,720
How is it?

257
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,080
Not bad.

258
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,680
But there is one thing missing.

259
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,360
Mr. Kong, pay the bill.

260
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:25,680
Why?

261
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,520
Because you have money.

262
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,720
Mr. Kong, pay the bill first.

263
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:29,800
Here.

264
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,720
There are so many pairs.

265
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,760
I don't know how to choose.

266
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,560
It's so pretty.

267
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,480
I want to buy it.

268
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,280
I want to buy it.

269
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,320
I want to buy it.

270
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,160
I want to buy it.

271
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,080
I want to buy it.

272
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,040
I want to buy it.

273
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:43,960
I want to buy it.

274
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:44,960
I don't know how to choose.

275
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:45,960
What's the point of buying it?

276
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,840
Boss, I bought it all.

277
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,280
All of it?

278
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,000
Yes, all of it.

279
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,400
Si Ma Gou.

280
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:01,880
Hurry up.

281
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:04,800
This one.

282
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,000
It's not bad.

283
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,480
Take it.

284
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:15,440
Come on.

285
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,280
It feels so good to spend money.

286
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,320
Did you

287
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,520
spend money like this every day?

288
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,240
I do spend money.

289
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,480
But it's the first time

290
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,360
I'm working as a part-time worker.

291
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,560
Did I spend too much money?

292
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,160
You've got it.

293
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,640
Buy whatever you want.

294
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,160
Really?

295
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,560
Right, Kong Kong?

296
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,200
Yes.

297
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,200
Sorry.

298
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,040
It's okay.

299
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:43,640
Let's go.

300
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,600
Let's go.

301
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,720
There's no mole on her face.

302
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,680
Her behavior is different from that of Feiyin.

303
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,360
Did she get it wrong?

304
00:14:59,040 --> 00:14:59,640
No.

305
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,640
I have to go back to the capital

306
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,320
to re-examine her identity.

307
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,120
It feels so good to spend money.

308
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,680
It's a pity that it's not convenient

309
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,800
to keep these things on the road.

310
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,640
I'll just leave them here

311
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,560
and relax after I return.

312
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,000
I'll just keep them here.

313
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,200
You've been busy for so long.

314
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,000
Just for a last-minute gift.

315
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,880
We're leaving soon.

316
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,360
I'll go to another place to have a look.

317
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,520
Enjoy your meal.

318
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,680
It's okay.

319
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,160
It's not like someone likes it.

320
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:32,560
Right.

321
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,120
It's good that she likes it.

322
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,440
It's hard to imagine that

323
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,640
you can say that.

324
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,000
And you just bought

325
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,160
the first return.

326
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,520
You look like

327
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,480
you're more than Ling Lang.

328
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,440
I used to only know how to make money.

329
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,560
I always felt heartache when I spent money.

330
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:52,880
But this time, it's different.

331
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:56,040
I feel like I have a little bit of regret.

332
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,760
Do you feel that way when you spend money?

333
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,720
Maybe

334
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,760
it's because I spent money on Ling Lang.

335
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:10,880
You think so?

336
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,440
I'll just leave her to you.

337
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,440
What do you mean?

338
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:21,960
Nothing.

339
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,280
Then I can rest assured

340
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,880
that you'll go with her.

341
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,440
That's right.

342
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,680
We should think about

343
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:31,600
how to go.

344
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,880
After leaving the city, we'll head to Baihe.

345
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,680
The fastest way is to go down the river.

346
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,000
We'll arrive at Wuchen in ten days.

347
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:39,960
No.

348
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,160
The number of killers

349
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,680
on the way is increasing.

350
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,120
It's obvious that they've already

351
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,120
taken our route.

352
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,360
We have to move in time,

353
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,360
take the opportunity,

354
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,440
and go around the mountain road.

355
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:50,920
Good idea.

356
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:52,960
If we leave the city together,

357
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,760
the target is too big.

358
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,680
You and Ling Lang go together.

359
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:55,640
I'll go alone.

360
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:56,640
But...

361
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,400
It's settled.

362
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,120
We'll meet at the canal

363
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,240
in an hour.

364
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,620
The ancient pickpocket girl,

365
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,800
the ż Eventually obtained a knife and had to be coat with Tanzi finger versions.

366
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:14,640
The two were

367
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,460
world-famous killers.

368
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:29,880
Your agony

369
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,320
is increasing.

370
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,840
15% of the usage

371
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,000
means you

372
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,640
should escape thei body,

373
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,080
the chance to die and pick up a one- scolded target.

374
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,080
Is this your

375
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,280
ten-year-old phoenix?

376
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,360
It's just a portrait of Princess Bai Yu's

377
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:45,960
several days ago.

378
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,000
It was before.

379
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,760
She has changed it now.

380
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,520
The Tang family has always been obsessed with poison.

381
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,240
But the way to poison it

382
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,760
is not like the Tang family's.

383
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,040
I remember you said

384
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,800
the Tang family has always been obsessed with it.

385
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,200
They never like the simple way

386
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,480
to poison it.

387
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,560
They have poison on their bodies.

388
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,720
They also feed on the exposure stone

389
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,600
and kill themselves.

390
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,400
So,

391
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,760
there's only one possibility.

392
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,040
There's only one more important thing

393
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:17,920
than their lives.

394
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,560
I've asked the villagers nearby.

395
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,000
There used to be a man

396
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,160
who was in the business of the workers.

397
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,880
But he hasn't been back for six or seven years.

398
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,200
The Demon King is a thug.

399
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,600
He's been chasing after people.

400
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:49,920
He's really a thug.

401
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:53,520
Who's there?

402
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,040
Who's there?

403
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,240
Who's behind him?

404
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,720
My Lord, he committed suicide.

405
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,680
Poison in the snake.

406
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,760
This is the death of Tian Luo.

407
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,240
We wanted to use the wine to find out

408
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,000
the whereabouts of Lu Ming and Lu Kun.

409
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,000
But we didn't expect that

410
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,640
the assassins were around the wine

411
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,120
and it was Tian Luo's death.

412
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,600
It seems that the wine is the key to

413
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,800
finding the five treasures.

414
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,160
But...

415
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,000
Say it.

416
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,440
Poison in the snake.

417
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:54,720
Back then,

418
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,040
now,

419
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,760
the Tang family will definitely stop it.

420
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,040
That's right.

421
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,720
In order to make up for the loss,

422
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,400
we're going back to the capital this time

423
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,000
to investigate the whereabouts of Tian Luo.

424
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,560
Are you going to fight against Tian Luo directly?

425
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,000
What's wrong? Are you afraid?

426
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,680
I'm not afraid.

427
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,840
As long as you're here,

428
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:13,920
you'll definitely protect me.

429
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,080
Ling Lang.

430
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,880
Please forgive me for not saying goodbye.

431
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,080
I'm leaving without saying goodbye.

432
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,080
If

433
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,720
I really were Tian Luo's death,

434
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:39,880
staying by your side

435
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,760
would only put you in danger.

436
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,320
What?

437
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,800
You're crying because you're leaving without saying goodbye?

438
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:55,840
You...

439
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:56,960
I haven't paid you yet.

440
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,560
How could I let you run away so easily?

441
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,000
We've known each other for so long.

442
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:00,720
What are you thinking?

443
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,160
You can tell from the look of your face.

444
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,440
You've been acting strange since you left the Iron Cloth House.

445
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,320
The closer you are to the truth of your birth,

446
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,400
the more you're afraid.

447
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,080
I'm afraid that you...

448
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,040
Me?

449
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,520
You're afraid that your birth will get me involved?

450
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,000
We've been fighting side by side for these past days.

451
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,320
No one can leave us.

452
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,320
Lu Jiu,

453
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,960
don't leave, okay?

454
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,320
Let me remind you.

455
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,560
My kung fu is top-notch.

456
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,160
Even if you escape to the ends of the world,

457
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,480
I can still catch you.

458
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,320
You...

459
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,280
Enough.

460
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,120
Don't be so impulsive.

461
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,240
Let's get on the road.

462
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,480
You can't even do a small thing?

463
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,120
I didn't expect

464
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:41,240
that Diancha Temple's Geng Zhao would appear there.

465
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,080
My Lord, I'm worried that

466
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,200
if this news gets to His Majesty...

467
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:49,680
I, Tian Ruo, will be in charge of the court.

468
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,440
Even if he returns to the capital,

469
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,760
he can't be my partner.

470
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,480
What do you mean?

471
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,960
I have my own plans for Geng Zhao.

472
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,080
The most urgent thing is

473
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,480
to bring Fei Ying back.

474
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:09,440
She's the key to my search for the Infinite Treasure.

475
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,040
I can't let her wander the world

476
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,880
and fall into the hands of others.

477
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,320
Yes, Your Majesty.

478
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,280
But my power is limited.

479
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,800
I'm afraid that she's not my opponent.

480
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,560
The First Miss is on a mission in the southwest.

481
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,440
Can you ask her for help?

482
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,200
My Lord.

483
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,960
Fei Ying is still alive.

484
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,880
Don't let her know.

485
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:33,920
Yes, Your Majesty.

486
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,120
Here.

487
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:10,240
This place is under the order of the imperial court and palace.

488
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,720
It can't be built by the Iron Lock Bridge and the Stone Pagoda Bridge.

489
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,440
Now, it can only be built

490
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,640
according to the design.

491
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:17,840
I understand.

492
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,160
You have to decide the time of the journey and the ship.

493
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,400
The bridge will be taken when the journey is over.

494
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,520
The bridge will be taken when the ship is on the way.

495
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,040
Draw this drawing

496
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:36,600
and give it to the magistrate to decide.

497
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,080
Why do I need to decide?

498
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,800
The master drew this drawing himself.

499
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,400
He even dared not to modify the design of the palace.

500
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,280
Don't be rude.

501
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,160
I'm a man of my word.

502
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,400
I can't be a buyer

503
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,960
if I don't do my job well.

504
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,360
I know my mistake.

505
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:51,640
Master.

506
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,000
The Imperial Investigation Bureau is here to see you.

507
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:54,800
Me?

508
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,040
Help him to draw the drawing.

509
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:09,120
You're here to see me.

510
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,280
Please come in.

511
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:12,960
We're busy.

512
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,200
We're busy.

513
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,880
The assassins, the Mongolian and Sang Sanniang,

514
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,960
died in the drug factory.

515
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,760
How do you explain it?

516
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:24,400
You must have all the evidence.

517
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,520
Why didn't the Investigation Bureau send someone to arrest them?

518
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:31,000
Why did you have to go there yourself?

519
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,600
The poison is a secret drug.

520
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:36,040
But it's not a murder.

521
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,400
Please explain it.

522
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
The assassins, the Mongolian and Sang Sanniang

523
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,400
were killed by Yinzhen.

524
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,960
They took the poison and stabbed them to death.

525
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,120
The poison was poisoned.

526
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,520
That's why they were killed on the spot.

527
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,880
Besides, when they were killed,

528
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,240
we also met the death of Tian Luo.

529
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,160
The Tang family is very skilled.

530
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,600
The poison of Chiyu Chang

531
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,720
was entrusted by the Ministry of War.

532
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,080
It's used in war.

533
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,800
The disciples of the Tang family dare not use it recklessly.

534
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,800
The poison of the Tang family is unparalleled.

535
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,640
I heard that Tian Luo's weapon is also a part of the Tang family.

536
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:17,760
The Tang family only collects money and does business.

537
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,440
It's convenient for him to move from the capital to the capital

538
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,960
for business.

539
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,480
Tian Luo uses the weapons made by the Tang family

540
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,560
only because he values the Tang family's craft.

541
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,920
Nothing else.

542
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,880
If you don't believe me,

543
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:34,640
I can hand over all the Chiyu Chang's files

544
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,600
to serve you.

545
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,040
Thank you, Mr. Tang.

546
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,280
By the way,

547
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:41,720
Mr. Tang is a great disciple.

548
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:42,840
His name is Sima Kong.

549
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:43,880
He has a high memory.

550
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,640
He intends to cultivate him as a successor.

551
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,400
I hope that one day,

552
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,960
I can meet him

553
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,040
in person.

554
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,800
Thank you, Mr. Geng.

555
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,720
I will visit him

556
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,720
at the Diancha Temple in person.

557
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,720
The death of Tian Luo

558
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,840
was recognized by Geng Zhao at a glance.

559
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,040
The City Leader Dugu was too careless.

560
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,640
They have been on the same boat with Tian Luo

561
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:13,160
for the sake of the Five Elements.

562
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,360
If you say so,

563
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,000
it will be very sad.

564
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,280
Before that,

565
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,440
Tian Luo and the Tang family

566
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,040
had no relationship.

567
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,520
The Chiyu Chang is the only friend of the Tang family.

568
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,760
Even if you want to remove him,

569
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,360
the Diancha Temple won't agree.

570
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,680
Don't think I don't know.

571
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:37,600
Tian Luo didn't die for the Diancha Temple.

572
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,640
He wanted to kill my disciple Sima Kong.

573
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,160
Now even Geng Zhao is watching my disciple.

574
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,080
How do you deal with this?

575
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,480
Don't be angry, Mr. Tang.

576
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,480
I'm just married to Lu Jiu.

577
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,280
Who taught your disciple and Lu Jiu

578
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:57,400
to be like brothers?

579
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,600
It's a consensus that we work together

580
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,160
to find the Five Elements.

581
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:05,920
Now you also want to kill my disciple.

582
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,560
You want to take over the Five Elements.

583
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,120
I wonder

584
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:15,440
why Sima Kong is willing to die for Lu Jiu.

585
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,440
It turns out to be with Mr. Tang.

586
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,520
Love

587
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:26,080
is a human weakness.

588
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:29,160
Sima Kong, I have cultivated since childhood.

589
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,760
In the future, I will take over the young leader of the Tang family.

590
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,320
What I did

591
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,760
was all for the Tang family.

592
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:41,240
I will never allow you to do it.

593
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,680
Cultivated since childhood?

594
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,360
I have done all my work

595
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:49,040
to raise my disciple Fei Ying.

596
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:53,160
But after finding the treasure,

597
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,240
I tried to escape.

598
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,320
I advise you, Mr. Tang.

599
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:00,800
Don't be too ambitious

600
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,280
for those uneducated kids.

601
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,120
Don't worry about their family affairs.

602
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,600
It's about the treasure.

603
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:09,000
I have to take care of it.

604
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
The treasure is not the only thing.

605
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,520
I don't know who the deer is.

606
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,200
Although we didn't kill him,

607
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,720
the assassin came to us.

608
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,920
We have to be careful.

609
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,040
There is no problem with the mechanism in the house.

610
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,580
But the wild

611
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:39,400
wild animals are hidden by the assassin.

612
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,400
It's not safe.

613
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,400
Before going to bed,

614
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,800
I will set up some mechanisms in the nearby woods.

615
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:44,800
No need.

616
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:49,320
There are no other people around except for the flying wild animals.

617
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,320
How do you know?

618
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,800
I can hear it.

619
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,800
That's right.

620
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,800
You are different from the past.

621
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,800
Lu Jiu and I will stay outside tonight.

622
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,800
Mr. Lin, you can go in and have a rest.

623
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:02,800
No need.

624
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,800
We can rest in the shabby temple together.

625
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,200
You two can go in and have a rest.

626
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,000
I will stay outside alone.

627
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,200
First, to be careful of the assassin.

628
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,200
Second,

629
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,800
to prevent from hurting you.

630
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,800
But it's so cold.

631
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,800
I just need to have enough firewood.

632
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,600
Although he stayed at night,

633
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,400
it's not easy for the heart to be broken.

634
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,400
Doing this is for your safety.

635
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,600
Your Excellency,

636
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,600
I have checked it.

637
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,600
It's just the process and the consequences

638
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,600
of the Tang family making the food.

639
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,600
It's the same as what he said.

640
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,600
There is nothing strange.

641
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,600
But

642
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,600
I always feel strange.

643
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,600
What is strange?

644
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,600
If I say it's the daughter's intuition,

645
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,600
will you beat me?

646
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,600
If it was before,

647
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,600
I definitely wouldn't believe it.

648
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,600
But now,

649
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,600
I can't believe it.

650
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,600
I can't believe it.

651
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,600
I can't believe it.

652
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,600
If it was before,

653
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,600
I definitely wouldn't believe it.

654
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,600
But the situation these times

655
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,600
has been carefully calculated by you.

656
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,600
Tell me about it.

657
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,600
I think the problem is

658
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,600
the same as the craftsmanship of the Tang family.

659
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,600
It's too skillful.

660
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,600
It's hard to find the flaw.

661
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,600
It's like

662
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,600
it's made specially for others.

663
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,600
Did I say something wrong?

664
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,600
No.

665
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,600
Go on.

666
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,600
I think

667
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,600
Tang Wuxin

668
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,600
has taken the initiative to help the investigation.

669
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,600
I think he has already thought of a solution.

670
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,600
The investigation

671
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,600
will leave evidence

672
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,600
as long as the case is solved.

673
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,600
And in these files,

674
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,600
it also records that

675
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,600
Tang family has helped the Ministry of Works

676
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,600
to design the project.

677
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,600
The Minister of Works, Meng Fei,

678
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,600
has proposed a plan.

679
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,600
But the project was launched

680
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,600
without any problems.

681
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,600
Good analysis.

682
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,600
Then

683
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,600
let's hurry up

684
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,600
and get to the point.

685
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,600
Let's go.

686
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,600
Sir, where are you going?

687
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,600
Lu Xiu.

688
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,600
Lu Xiu, what's wrong?

689
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,600
Nothing.

690
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,600
I've been

691
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:03,600
feeling very sensitive recently.

692
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,600
Especially at night,

693
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,600
I feel that

694
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,600
everything around me

695
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,600
can't be heard or seen.

696
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,600
No wonder your dark circles

697
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,600
are getting more and more severe.

698
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,600
I have an idea.

699
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,600
Don't be afraid.

700
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:03,600
It's better to be a little more careful.

701
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:07,600
The red thread is in my palm.

702
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,600
My arms are empty.

703
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:15,600
We are like a film.

704
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,600
The moon is gentle.

705
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:21,600
Why is the moonlight blue?

706
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:26,600
I am willing to be alone.

707
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:29,600
You are in the deep of the world.

708
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,600
Like the blooming of the flowers.

709
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:38,600
The heart is written on the paper.

710
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:43,600
A dream is a lifetime.

711
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:49,600
A dream is a lifetime.

712
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:55,600
I will never forget you.

713
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:00,600
The mountains and rivers are long gone.

714
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:06,600
A dream is a lifetime.

715
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:12,600
A dream is a lifetime.

716
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:15,600
If we can meet again,

717
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:18,600
how will it be?

718
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:24,600
Thank you for looking back at the past.

719
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:29,600
Thank you for looking back at the past.
