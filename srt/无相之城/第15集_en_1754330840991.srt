1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,500
You be cheerful IchikÑ‘ offered

2
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:37,900
My emotion

3
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:47,300
You can look at Su leaned

4
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:50,480
You talk about some

5
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:55,480
The King of Blaze

6
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,480
Episode 16

7
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,480
Who said it's hard for me?

8
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,480
Look.

9
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:25,480
The King of Blaze

10
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,480
Do I look like him?

11
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,480
No.

12
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,480
Not like him.

13
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,480
It's obvious.

14
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,480
He's even more beautiful than a lady.

15
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:44,480
He's elegant, gorgeous, and beautiful.

16
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,480
He's a fairy.

17
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,480
I don't think he can only rely on clothes.

18
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,480
I want to learn how to be elegant.

19
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,480
I think the lady on the stage

20
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,480
is like this.

21
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,480
Linglong, don't make it hard for yourself.

22
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,480
It's good to be yourself.

23
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,480
What are you talking about?

24
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,480
Don't move.

25
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,480
It's this feeling.

26
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,480
What feeling? It hurts.

27
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,480
It's exactly the same as Miss Hua.

28
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,480
It's like this.

29
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,480
It's exactly this feeling.

30
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,480
Miss Hua.

31
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,480
Although Miss Hua is elegant,

32
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,480
she's also a beautiful lady.

33
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,480
She once married a new head of the department.

34
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,480
She was in a bad relationship with her husband.

35
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,480
Her husband wrote a letter to divorce her.

36
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,480
She inherited the legacy of the Hua family.

37
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,480
She became the first wife of Shanxi for several years.

38
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,480
So she's a womanizer.

39
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:46,480
Isn't she different from you?

40
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,480
I've seen you.

41
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,480
Put this on.

42
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,480
Don't say it's her.

43
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,480
Even you can't recognize yourself.

44
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,480
Human skin mask?

45
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:02,480
Miss Hua is from a family of merchants.

46
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,480
How is she related to the martial arts world?

47
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,480
Miss Hua's godmother

48
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,480
is the owner of the Five Ye Hall in the south of the Yangtze River.

49
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,480
She has always been in contact with these people.

50
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,480
And this Miss Hua

51
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,480
is not like her father,

52
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,480
who is honest and diligent.

53
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,480
As long as it's a business that makes money,

54
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,480
she can handle it.

55
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,480
So this time,

56
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,480
it's not an ordinary deal.

57
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,480
It's a man of the medicine.

58
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,480
Man of the medicine?

59
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,480
Taoist priest,

60
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,480
Miss Hua sent a message.

61
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,480
She'll be here soon.

62
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,480
Miss Hua

63
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,480
is our chief.

64
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,480
Someone broke in at this time.

65
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,480
We have to be careful.

66
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,480
Pass on the order.

67
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,480
Let everyone

68
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,480
see it today.

69
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,480
Go.

70
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,480
Yes.

71
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,480
Hmm.

72
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,480
Taoist priest, Miss Hua is here.

73
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,480
Miss Hua, you came here.

74
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,480
I have a reason.

75
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,480
I'm not here to talk to you.

76
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,480
Where's the thing I want?

77
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,480
You go to the room and take a rest.

78
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,480
I'll arrange it right away.

79
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,480
Please.

80
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,480
It's hot.

81
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,480
Our country

82
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,480
definitely doesn't have

83
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,480
the tea that can fit Miss Hua's eyes.

84
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,480
Am I here for tea?

85
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,480
The matter of the medicine

86
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,480
is very important.

87
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,480
I also have to

88
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,480
ask Miss Hua for a favor.

89
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,480
What favor?

90
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,480
Last time,

91
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,480
Mrs. Liu

92
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,480
helped us.

93
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,480
She used five black-sand palm

94
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,480
to kill my enemy

95
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,480
and saved my life.

96
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,480
I wonder if Miss Hua

97
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,480
saw it.

98
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:06,480
That's a great memory.

99
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,480
It seems that since my godmother,

100
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,480
Liu Erfuren,

101
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,480
washed the gold plate

102
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,480
and gave the person tea,

103
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,480
her reputation

104
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,480
is not worth it in the martial arts world.

105
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,480
I'm going back to persuade her.

106
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,480
Don't show up again.

107
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,480
Or you'll be lost.

108
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,480
This person is very sharp and tender.

109
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,480
How could he be a slave?

110
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,480
Come.

111
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,480
Miss Hua's godmother

112
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,480
is the owner of the Five Ye Hall in Jiangnan.

113
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,480
She has always been in contact with these people.

114
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,480
And this Miss Hua

115
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,480
is not like her father,

116
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,480
who is honest and hardworking.

117
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,480
She is a person who can handle

118
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,480
any business that makes money.

119
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,480
So this time,

120
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,480
it's not an ordinary deal.

121
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,480
It's a drug deal.

122
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,480
Why do you help me?

123
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,480
I'm not helping you.

124
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,480
I'm helping myself.

125
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,480
The girl who disguised as Miss Hua

126
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,480
and traded with you tomorrow,

127
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,480
I want her to disappear from this world.

128
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,480
Miss, you are a real master.

129
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,480
It's not a big deal

130
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,480
to kill someone.

131
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,480
Do you need to be a master?

132
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,480
If you don't,

133
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,480
I'm afraid people will see you.

134
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,480
You don't have to

135
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,480
know about me.

136
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,480
If you can do this,

137
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,480
I won't treat you badly.

138
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,480
Tian Luo?

139
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,480
Tian Luo?

140
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,480
Thank you for

141
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,480
seeing a face of this person.

142
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,480
Fei Ying!

143
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,480
Fei Ying!

144
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,480
So,

145
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:12,480
you have a different guest here.

146
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,480
Miss Hua's Black Sand palm

147
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:18,000
I've heard a lot about you.

148
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,240
I'm really impressed.

149
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,720
But I don't know

150
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,200
this lady.

151
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,840
I want you to kill her.

152
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:29,840
Stop it.

153
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,320
Are you okay?

154
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,880
Thank you for your intelligence.

155
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,600
I know someone doesn't want this business to succeed,

156
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:41,000
so I was prepared in advance.

157
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:45,400
Are you still suspecting my identity?

158
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,200
Actually, it doesn't matter who I am.

159
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,720
The business of the drug addicts is very good.

160
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,040
Everyone wants to do it.

161
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,800
Not to mention you,

162
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,400
even King of Tieluo

163
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,520
wants to monopolize this business.

164
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,560
How can I take this?

165
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,880
Several years ago,

166
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,320
Tieluo had already bought a lot of drugs

167
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,480
to find out the truth about them.

168
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,440
The living person

169
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,640
is the best candidate to be in the scene.

170
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,920
Find out the truth?

171
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,960
You mean seven years ago?

172
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:13,720
Priest,

173
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,120
this person has no idea about the drug addicts.

174
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,400
How dare he pretend to be Tieluo's man?

175
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,080
Please think twice.

176
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,840
This lady claims to be Tieluo's man.

177
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,000
Her identity is suspicious.

178
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,320
But Miss Hua's black sand field

179
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,240
can't be fake.

180
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,920
If so,

181
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,360
it's no use keeping you.

182
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,680
Fei Ying

183
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,360
has already done it for me.

184
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,360
I told you

185
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,920
not to touch her.

186
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,720
I will touch her today.

187
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,760
Lu Jiu.

188
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:00,880
Lu Jiu.

189
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,040
Lu Jiu.

190
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,480
Lu Jiu.

191
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,800
Lu Jiu.

192
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,840
Lu Jiu.

193
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,680
Lu Jiu.

194
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,720
Lu Jiu.

195
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,680
Lu Jiu.

196
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,680
Lu Jiu.

197
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,680
Lu Jiu.

198
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,080
Lu Jiu.

199
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,120
Lu Jiu.

200
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,280
The inspection bureau brought someone in.

201
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,200
Miss Hua is a private agent.

202
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,600
If you don't want Tieluo to be in front of the inspection bureau,

203
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,000
please leave now.

204
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,800
You people

205
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,920
even tried to get me.

206
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,680
Take my head.

207
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,680
I'll make you all die.

208
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,680
Sir, are you okay?

209
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,680
You're dead.

210
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,680
I'll make you all die.

211
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,680
Are you serious?

212
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,680
My brother is dead?

213
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,680
Let's just leave it at that.

214
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,680
If he's still alive,

215
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,680
I hope you can live a free life.

216
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,680
Take your passport and document

217
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,680
and leave here.

218
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,680
Before I leave,

219
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,680
I have to do something.

220
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,680
Didn't you say

221
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,680
you wanted me to help you?

222
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,680
Tomorrow, I'll help you

223
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,680
to play a good show.

224
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,680
Sister, I knew you would come to save me.

225
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,680
Let's go.

226
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,680
You can go that way later.

227
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:11,680
You can go out.

228
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:15,680
What about you?

229
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,680
I have something to do.

230
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,680
You go out first.

231
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,680
Where are you going?

232
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,680
Don't you want me anymore?

233
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,680
I don't want you.

234
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,680
There are people here

235
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,680
who are like you.

236
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,680
I need to save them.

237
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,680
Be good.

238
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,680
Sister, don't leave me.

239
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,680
I don't want to.

240
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,680
I don't want to.

241
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,680
Be good.

242
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,680
Be good.

243
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,680
Sister.

244
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,680
Sister.

245
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,680
Lin Lang.

246
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,680
Master Shang, you finally woke up.

247
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,680
Master Yan.

248
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,680
Your expression

249
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,680
makes me feel embarrassed.

250
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,680
Master,

251
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,680
you must be tired.

252
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,680
I'm fine.

253
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,680
But I need to go to the toilet.

254
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,680
You go.

255
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:31,680
Master,

256
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,680
I'm fine.

257
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,680
I'll go with you.

258
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,680
Go on.

259
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,680
I'll go with you.

260
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,680
But you finally regained your mind.

261
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,680
I lost my mind?

262
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,680
Why can't I remember anything?

263
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,680
You can't remember anything.

264
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,680
Remember to think about the person you want to see.

265
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,680
You're right.

266
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,680
I did something I shouldn't have done.

267
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,680
I'm afraid this time I sent you to save me

268
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,680
is the last chance for me.

269
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,680
No.

270
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:01,680
This time, it's Xu Lin Lang and Lu Jiu who saved you.

271
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,680
What?

272
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,680
Your identity has been found by the Overwatch Division.

273
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,680
Even the missing information

274
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:17,680
was given to the master by Geng Zhao directly.

275
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,680
The master did it for the Tang family.

276
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,680
He had no choice.

277
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,680
It's reasonable.

278
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,680
Where are they?

279
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,680
They...

280
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,680
Lin Lang is in trouble.

281
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,680
No, no, no.

282
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:37,680
It's not him.

283
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,680
It's Lu Jiu.

284
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,680
What's wrong with him?

285
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,680
You're awake.

286
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,680
He's so nice.

287
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:53,680
How is he now?

288
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,680
I've taken care of his wound.

289
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,680
But his condition is not good.

290
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,680
Who gave him such a heavy poison?

291
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,680
He came for me.

292
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:03,680
Lu Jiu did it to save me.

293
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,680
It's all because of me.

294
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,680
If it wasn't for saving me,

295
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,680
it wouldn't have come to this.

296
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:11,680
Don't say that.

297
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,680
Your medical skill is better than mine.

298
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,680
Take a look at him.

299
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,680
Look at him.

300
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,680
The poison is very sour.

301
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,680
If we can't ask the person who gave the poison

302
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,680
to get the antidote,

303
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,680
I'm afraid we can only know

304
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,680
the solution by getting another one.

305
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,680
I've tried it.

306
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,160
But I can't feed it.

307
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,440
It's weak now.

308
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,320
If it doesn't go into the soup,

309
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,560
I'm afraid it won't last long.

310
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,960
I want to eat more.

311
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,960
The dusk is wavering.

312
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:03,320
The house is full of the sound of the flute.

313
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,120
The red thread is in my palm.

314
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,040
My arms are empty.

315
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:16,080
The heart is written on the paper.

316
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:22,280
In my dream, I'm a man for a lifetime.

317
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:28,720
In my dream, I'm a man for a lifetime.

318
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:35,200
I'll never forget you for the rest of my life.

319
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:45,640
Thank you for looking back at this moment.

320
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,440
It went into the soup.

321
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,140
Yes.

322
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:17,340
He's dead?

323
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:18,540
His pulse suddenly rose.

324
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,580
I think it's only recently facing me.

325
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,820
I've been Communications whom several laws on it.

326
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,300
He's just a same as me.

327
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:28,860
He's your son rest of all.

328
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,680
We'd better not take them so lightly.

329
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,560
Idiot!

330
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,160
I don't want him to die.

331
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,080
He still hasn't share any sort of clue about born grave.

332
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:38,480
But if we go to offer the medicine now,

333
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,480
I'm afraid it will reveal your great plan.

334
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:49,680
Don't worry. This matter was caused by the daughter of Old Man of Dugu.

335
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,880
But in the face of the Five-star Treasure,

336
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,280
I'm sure she won't just sit around and do nothing.

337
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,280
You're wise, Father.

338
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,480
This... This has already taken two of my pills.

339
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,480
It has no effect at all.

340
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,480
Hurry up. Hurry up.

341
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,080
Shut up.

342
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,080
Her poison has not only not decreased,

343
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,080
but it's getting worse.

344
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,680
It's like I already knew how to deal with her.

345
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,680
What should we do then?

346
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,080
To cure the spirit, one needs to cure the spirit.

347
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,880
I'm afraid she has already known me.

348
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,280
Even if I want to see her,

349
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,680
she doesn't want to see me.

350
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,480
Then I'll go give her a few pills.

351
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,080
Ling Lang, you've been with her for a day.

352
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,480
The water hasn't been filled yet.

353
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,680
Hurry and rest for a bit.

354
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:41,280
Leave the rest to me and Old Man Yan.

355
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,080
If she can't do it for a day,

356
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,680
I won't leave for a day.

357
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,080
But you...

358
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,480
Let's go.

359
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,880
It's all my fault.

360
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,480
If it wasn't for me,

361
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,680
I wouldn't have been able to cure her.

362
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,480
If it wasn't for me,

363
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,880
you wouldn't have been so impulsive.

364
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,880
If I was a bit more powerful,

365
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,480
I could have cured your poison.

366
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:13,080
Lu Jiu, wake up.

367
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,280
Wake up, okay?

368
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,480
Who is it?

369
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,680
I know you're here.

370
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,680
I also know that Lu Jiu is the most important person to you.

371
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:32,280
Otherwise, you wouldn't have risked your life to save her.

372
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,280
Lu Jiu is very badly poisoned.

373
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,880
Please save her.

374
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,280
Or else, she will die.

375
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,480
Please save her.

376
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:49,080
How can you save her?

377
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,480
As long as you're willing to save her,

378
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,880
I'm willing to leave her.

379
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,680
I will never appear by her side again.

380
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:12,080
Do you think I will use her life

381
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,680
to exchange for your leaving?

382
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,880
What can you do to save her?

383
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,680
As long as you say it, I'm willing to do it.

384
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,680
Say something!

385
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:25,280
What can you do to save her?

386
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:31,680
Do you think I don't want to save her?

387
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:34,280
This poison doesn't have any antidote!

388
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:37,880
I don't believe it! How can there be poison without antidote?

389
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:41,280
I don't believe it! Please save her!

390
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:59,480
In her world, there is only one thing

391
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:06,680
Perhaps your fate is destined to be a

392
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,880
In my world, there is only one thing

393
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,680
At least you can still be by her side.

394
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:16,080
And I...

395
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,480
don't even have the right to do so.

396
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,480
I don't want to see you

397
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,680
be with you in this world.

398
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:27,880
Only in my heart

399
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,880
is your name

400
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,480
destined to be a

401
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:38,880
In my world, there is only one thing

402
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:45,280
Perhaps your fate is destined to be a

403
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:50,080
In my world, there is only one thing

404
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:56,680
At least you can still be by her side.

405
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,680
Linglong!

406
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,280
Why are you drenched?

407
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,280
I'll go boil some hot water for you.

408
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,880
No need.

409
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:18,880
I just want to be alone with Lu Jiu for a while.

410
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,680
I heard that your poison can't be cured.

411
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:48,880
Jin Xifeng and other people

412
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,480
said that the one who can eat the golden pig will be black.

413
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,880
I've been with you for too long.

414
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,680
I've become so insincere.

415
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,080
Forget it.

416
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,480
Since you're poisoned,

417
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,680
I won't bother you anymore.

418
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,480
I'll go boil some hot water for you.

419
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,280
No need.

420
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,680
Don't you remember

421
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:18,280
that last time you got poisoned,

422
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:29,680
Si Ma Kong's mountain

423
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,680
and you got poisoned.

424
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,480
I owe you so much.

425
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,280
How can I repay you?

426
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,480
How about

427
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:50,280
I give you my body, okay?

428
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:53,880
I'll tell you a secret.

429
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:56,680
I've liked you for a long time.

430
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:07,680
I don't even know when it started.

431
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:12,080
Maybe it was from Jia Chang Yi.

432
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,080
You changed your name.

433
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:18,880
Or maybe you rushed in from Lin Mu to save me.

434
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,280
Maybe

435
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:26,080
it was the first time I saw you.

436
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,480
You're already in my heart.

437
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,880
Lu Jiu,

438
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:37,280
wake up, okay?

439
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,280
Wake up.

440
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:42,080
I haven't waited for your answer yet.

441
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,880
Wake up and cry.

442
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,080
Sect Leader!

443
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,280
Where are you going?

444
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,680
Tang Men.

445
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,680
He's been poisoned by Master's

446
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:02,080
special move for the Heavenly Fowl.

447
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,280
Master is a cautious person.

448
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,080
He'll definitely leave a mark.

449
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,480
Here.

450
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:10,080
This is about Tang Men's loyalty to the Heavenly Fowl.

451
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,280
You think the Sect Leader will leave a mark

452
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,080
for someone who has nothing to do with it?

453
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,680
You know Tang Men Yu doesn't care, right?

454
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:17,080
He's not someone who has nothing to do with it.

455
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,280
He's my friend.

456
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,880
Is it just because he's your friend?

457
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,480
He's still a kind of person I like.

458
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,880
The person in his heart isn't you.

459
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:30,680
What are you trying to do?

460
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:33,080
I don't want him to have me in his heart.

461
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,680
Everything I've done

462
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:38,080
is just to make him not to be sad anymore.

463
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,280
Do you know

464
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:44,080
that you didn't turn back at all?

465
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,480
If you don't have a companion,

466
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,680
even if you're honest,

467
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,680
what's the point?

468
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,280
Sect Leader!

469
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:02,480
Sect Leader, I finally caught up with you.

470
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,480
You...

471
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,080
Teacher.

472
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,880
Sect Leader.

473
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,880
You still remember me as your teacher?

474
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,280
Teacher heard that I was kidnapped by a villain.

475
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,880
Didn't he also send someone to save me?

476
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,680
How dare you!

477
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,880
Tang Wen Li has put his personal interests at the highest.

478
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:30,480
Teacher did the right thing.

479
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,280
I broke the rules.

480
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,080
I'll punish myself.

481
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,880
Sect Leader!

482
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,280
You know the rules.

483
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,280
Come back with me.

484
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,480
You're still the sect leader of Tang.

485
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,480
I know the position of the sect leader.

486
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:00,080
I hope that you can try to

487
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:03,080
give me the antidote to the poison.

488
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:07,080
If I give you the antidote now,

489
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:11,080
won't you tell Tian Luo that I have a second heart?

490
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:13,080
Sima Kong,

491
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,680
I've been training you for so many years.

492
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:18,480
You're not even concerned about Tang's life!

493
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,080
If Tian Luo wants to pursue me, I'll take it on my own.

494
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:25,680
Can you afford it?

495
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,680
I came to the Wuzhen Sect this time

496
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:33,080
because Tian Luo is the only one who can guide me.

497
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:38,280
I'm afraid that he already knows that I have the antidote.

498
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:41,080
It depends on how I act.

499
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,880
That's easy.

500
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:47,480
As long as I'm not a disciple of Tang,

501
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,880
I can take the position of the sect.

502
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,880
You...

503
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,480
What do you want to do?

504
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,880
During the time when the sect leader was kidnapped,

505
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:12,440
he was given the antidote to the

506
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:24,280
Taoist Sect's martial arts.

507
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:28,680
I'm afraid that he won't be able to return the antidote

508
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,880
that he's been training for so many years.

509
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:35,880
I'll return the Taoist Sect's martial arts first.

510
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,080
From now on,

511
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:43,480
I have nothing to do with the Tang Sect anymore.

512
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,480
No!

513
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,480
Sect Leader!

514
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:55,300
Convey my greeting's Seal to the2017 Martial club's

515
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:58,280
new disciple!

516
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:01,440
Poke his â†’

517
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,820
even yourerk!

518
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:08,280
Dip, nor, blow or scrape!

519
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,280
She will be here soon.

520
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:13,880
If this news is known,

521
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,680
let us know

522
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:18,260
through the live video comments.

523
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,880
Chief...

524
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,380
Don't worry about Veiledricoad ë¶„ë…¸

525
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:23,220
I forgot to tell you one more thing.

526
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:26,060
When I was imprisoned,

527
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:27,980
when I saw you as a child,

528
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,180
you used it to train my demons.

529
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:38,100
Actually...

530
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:39,460
Actually, in your eyes,

531
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,700
I'm no different from those

532
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,100
who died in the process of death

533
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,740
and the demons who died by the workers.

534
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:54,140
The chief doesn't have the tools.

535
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:17,100
Since you think so,

536
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:20,620
I don't need you anymore.

537
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:22,940
From now on,

538
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:25,340
you and I city disciple

539
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:27,580
have à®Žà®© direktun.

540
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:21,940
I...

541
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,100
We can't just die.

542
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:24,700
But only by using the acupuncture to kill Lu Jiu

543
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:26,340
can you kill him.

544
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:29,540
I don't want you to die.

545
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:30,780
It's not that serious.

546
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:33,620
It's just that I'm using less acupuncture.

547
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:36,740
If you only use less acupuncture,

548
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:38,060
it's fine.

549
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:40,380
But if Lu Jiu comes to see me now,

550
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:43,220
the soldiers will use up all your acupuncture.

551
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:44,860
I'm not going to let you die.

552
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:46,460
I'm not going to let you die.

553
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:48,180
I'm not going to let you die.

554
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:49,380
I'm not going to let you die.

555
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:50,380
I'm not going to let you die.

556
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:51,620
All your acupuncture...

557
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:53,340
When the time comes,

558
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:55,980
Lu Jiu may not be able to save you.

559
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:58,020
You'll be in danger.

560
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:00,900
I don't want you to die.

561
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:03,220
I'm a man of the imperial court.

562
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:04,500
I only know the justice.

563
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:05,980
If you don't understand,

564
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,380
then you'd better

565
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:09,380
not follow me anymore.

566
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:13,460
Your Excellency!

567
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:21,220
Your Excellency!

568
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:51,220
Your Excellency!

569
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:21,220
Your Excellency!

570
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:55,380
I don't want to be a man of the imperial court.

571
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:58,260
If we can meet again,

572
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:01,620
we'll be happy.

573
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:11,020
Thank you for looking back at the past with a single glance.
