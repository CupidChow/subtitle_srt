 True Beauty

00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:13,860

 True Beauty

00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:35,080
 Episode 13 

5
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:40,350
Goddess, my ass.

6
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:53,460
  Welcome to  Saebom High School's Admission Information Session 

7
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,090
It's Im Ju Gyeong.

8
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:08,180
Ju Gyeong, is this really you?

9
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:12,430
 Exposing the real identity of Saebom High School's goddess, Im Ju Gyeong. 

10
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:14,810
 Before she transferred schools, she was famous for being a dumpling shuttle. 

11
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:16,730
 If you guys all see this, you will be shocked. 

12
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:19,650
  She's super ugly. Only looks like that because of makeup. 

13
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:45,920
Wow, that's no joke.

14
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,830
This is fascinating for me.

15
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:50,070
This is a scam.

16
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:51,330
Wow, this is just, wow!

17
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:53,960
Goodness.

18
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:02,270
Im Ju Gyeong!

19
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,790
Ju Gyeong.

20
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,350
Ju Gyeong.

21
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,970
Hey, Ju Gyeong.

22
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:32,990
What? A Goddess?

23
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:36,550
What a joke. Bring this b**ch with us.

24
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:41,100
Let go. Let go!

25
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:43,360
Let go!

26
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,980
Hey, weren't you dating Han Seo Jun?

27
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:54,220
But what? Lee Su Ho?

28
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:56,060
What a seductress.

29
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:58,100
How did you seduce Lee Su Ho with this face?

30
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:00,380
Wow, this is no joke.

31
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,280
Does Lee Su Ho know your real face?

32
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,060
If he doesn't know, he'll break up. If he knows...

33
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,490
then what's with him?

34
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:11,530
What kind of bullshit is it that you're a goddess?

35
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:12,820
Grab her.

36
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:15,630
- What are you doing?
 - Stay still.

37
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:17,780
What? We just want to see your bare face.

38
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,520
Don't do that.

39
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:23,590
- Why? It's fun.
 - Don't do that.

40
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:25,470
Wow, seriously.

41
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,530
Is that her?

42
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:30,490
- I said, stop! 
 - Stop moving.

43
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:33,180
Look at the complexion difference already. Oh my!

44
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,350
I said don't do that.

45
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:36,960
Oh my, my , my.

46
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,070
Wow, amazing.

47
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:40,850
Wow.

48
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:42,700
Get your hands off!

49
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:54,920
Ju Gyeong. Ju Gyeong!

50
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:59,300
Im Ju Gyeong. Im Ju Gyeong!

51
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:02,600
Im Ju Gyeong! Im Ju Gyeong!

52
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:08,050
Where are you going?

53
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,440
Are you crying?

54
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:15,590
Hey, Im Ju Gyeong!

55
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,200
- Did you see Im Ju Gyeong? 
 - Did you two fight again?

56
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,950
I asked if you saw her!

57
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:27,030
She went that way.

58
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:31,930
I don't care whether you're fighting or not.

59
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:34,720
Hey, Han Seo Jun! Han Seo Jun! Im Ju Gyeong is unbelievable.

60
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,230
You better not talk about Im Ju Gyeong to me anymore.

61
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:38,780
I don't want to care.

62
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:41,910
Look at this. Hurry.

63
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:34,270
 ♡Boyfriend♡ 

64
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:39,600
 Dating someone like you drags Lee Su Ho's reputation down. 

65
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:42,420
 There are 4 missed calls. 

66
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,600
Hey, did you see the video?

67
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,300
- Of course I did.
 - Wow, I almost got fooled.

68
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:02,600
- Goddess Im Ju Gyeong? What a joke?
 - I know, right?

69
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,510
- Her face is so freaking red. 
 - Exactly.

70
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:09,420
What? Say it. What did you just say?
 - What?

71
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:11,200
You jerk!

72
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,400
You bastard.

73
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,210
- What's the matter? 
 - Hey, stop!

74
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:18,370
- Do we need to call a teacher? 
 - Hey, hey, what's the matter?

75
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:20,170
Let go!

76
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:23,130
Say it. Say it again, you jerk!

77
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:25,240
- What did you say?
 - Hey!

78
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:29,020
Hey, Im Ju Yeong, stop it! Stop it!

79
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:32,960
Let it go.

80
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,140
Sit.

81
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,420
Calm down. Don't get worked up.

82
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:54,820
There you go. Good job.

83
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:58,530
I'm also mad about Unni Ju Gyeong's incident.

84
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:02,020
But no matter what, violence shouldn't be used.

85
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:05,110
There is a saying "don't even hit with a flower."

86
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:09,040
There isn't anything that can't be solved with a conversation, okay?

87
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,440
Hand.

88
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,480
Are you a retriever?

89
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,260
Here.

90
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:21,540
Your hand is scraped.

91
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:34,670
- Hey, can you even recognize her? 
 - I was seriously shocked.

92
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:36,230
What would she do now?

93
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:37,680
Are you watching something interesting?

94
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,130
Hello.

95
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:40,890
This way, you punk.

96
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:43,060
Time for morning assembly.

97
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,690
I don't see Ju Gyeong and Su Ho.

98
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:57,560
They must've gone on a date.

99
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:02,880
Mr. Han, I don't think Ju Gyeong will come today.

100
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,160
Is she sick?

101
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,830
 Could it be because of me? 

102
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:08,690
 Unni! 

103
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:10,360
 - Hello. 
 - Mr. Han? 

104
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,050
 - We are dating. 
 - Why out of all people does it have to be my teacher? 

105
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:15,850
 How can I go to school when it's so uncomfortable? 

106
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,720
But, Mr. Han, Han Seo Jun isn't in school today either.

107
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,940
- Seo Jun too? 
 - Yes.

108
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:34,460
- Who is that? 
 - I don't know but he's handsome.

109
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:36,130
Saebom High?

110
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:42,370
Seo Jun. Han Seo Jun.

111
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:43,920
Did you call for me? Why?

112
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,760
I told you I won't let it be if you did something like this again.

113
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,020
How won't you let it be?

114
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:51,260
- Delete it while I'm being nice.
 - Delete what?

115
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:54,510
The video that you showed me yesterday!

116
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:58,350
- You uploaded it on the anonymous  bulletin board.
 - Huh? Anonymous bulletin board?

117
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:01,150
What are you talking about?

118
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:03,810
Did it get uploaded on your school's bulletin board?

119
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:07,630
Wow, unbelievable. Is that why you came here?

120
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,600
But too bad it wasn't me.

121
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,910
- It's not you? 
 - It's not me.

122
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:13,500
Dumpling doesn't even go to my school anymore.

123
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,450
Why would I go through the work of uploading it on Saebom High's bulletin board?

124
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:20,400
Is there anyone else who would do such a thing other than you?

125
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:24,580
Why not?

126
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:29,200
How do you think I found out that dumpling bitch is Im Ju Gyeong?

127
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:40,220
Would I be able to get married?

128
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:05,360
- A guardian angel?  (T/N: in Korean, 'Su-ho-shin')  
 - Ahjussi, is Ju Gyeong here?

129
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,840
No.

130
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:12,970
 The Lovers 

131
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:26,090
- Oh my! My Ho is here.
 - Hello. By chance, is—

132
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:29,370
Oh no, why do you look so weak?

133
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:31,420
- Is your leg any better? 
 - Yes, is Ju Gyeong—

134
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:33,480
Is Jusama... no.

135
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,950
How's your father?

136
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:37,570
So so.

137
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,940
I shouldn't have brought it up.

138
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:42,300
- Is Ju Gyeong—
 - Huh?

139
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,890
Ju Gyeong?

140
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:48,300
Never mind. I'll get going. Bye.

141
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,120
Make sure you don't skip a meal!

142
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:53,550
And watch out for cars! Don't get in accidents.

143
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:58,070
Wait? Isn't it school time?

144
00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:00,290
Why did he come here?

145
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:06,310
Im Ju Gyeong.

146
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:12,590
This girl splurged on makeup again.

147
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,160
What's this?

148
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:18,350
 Registration Card 

149
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:27,930
   

150
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:29,930
That rascal!

151
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:34,380
Hey, Choi Su Ah, did you really not know?

152
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:36,690
Ju Gyeong and you are best friends.

153
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:39,410
What best friends?

154
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:42,620
- Did she pretend to be a goddess and even became the school model? 
 - I know, right?

155
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,230
How did she come to date Su Ho?

156
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:47,150
- Hey, of course he didn't know her bare face.
 - Do you want to bet?

157
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:49,360
You guys should watch what you say.

158
00:11:57,290 --> 00:11:59,160
Come out.

159
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:02,240
- Why?
 - Should I say it here?

160
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:05,090
Class will start soon.

161
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:10,910
Come out when I say come out.

162
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:15,370
Whoa, what’s going on?

163
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:17,010
Beat her up, beat her up.

164
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:18,830
Wow, he’s totally angry.

165
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:20,450
Let go.

166
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,430
Were you trash this bad?

167
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:27,260
Delete the video.

168
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:30,000
- I don't want to.
 - You don't want to?

169
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:34,330
Why do you care?

170
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:37,520
What would Lee Su Ho think of you when he finds out?

171
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:40,400
Delete it before I tell him everything!

172
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,420
- Tell him. I'm not scared.
 - What?

173
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:46,420
And I can't even if I wanted to.

174
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:50,430
Would it change anything if I deleted it? Is there anyone who hasn't seen it yet?

175
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:53,200
Why are you going this far?

176
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,460
Is it because of Lee Su Ho?

177
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:58,400
If he finds out, you think he'll even think of you as a friend?

178
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:02,920
A friend? I have no intention of staying as a friend like a fool

179
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:06,270
and having a heartbroken one-sided love like you.

180
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:13,040
You think you destroyed Im Ju Gyeong?

181
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:18,230
You're the one who's broken down.

182
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:35,400
- Hey, Kim Cho Rong. 
 - What?

183
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:38,830
- Hurry and come out. 
 - My... small... and precious...

184
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:42,500
- I need to finish pooping before I come out. 
 - I said, just end it now and come out!

185
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,120
What the hell?! Come on...

186
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:53,130
I heard that only the administrator of an anonymous bulletin board can delete the video. Do you know who that is?

187
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:54,520
Obviously, I don't know!

188
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,900
Why don't you know?!

189
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:58,850
I don't even know when my poop will come out, so how would I know  that ?

190
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:03,130
- Then find out. 
 - How am I supposed to find out—!

191
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:07,480
But, Han Seo Jun, why do you care all of a sudden?

192
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,070
- About what? 
 - Nothing, just...

193
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:12,120
Don't say you have a crush on Im Ju Gyeong?!

194
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,540
What kind of crap is that! Just figure it out!

195
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:18,060
How am I supposed to figure it out, you stupid idiot—!

196
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:28,080
What's going on with classroom 5?

197
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:31,280
I heard that two of your students cut class today.

198
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:34,960
It's probably because the teacher is too busy dating to care.

199
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,630
Dating?

200
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:43,910
  Hui Gyeong, were we being selfish? 

201
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:16,370
Miss.

202
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:20,000
You know this is the bus terminal, right?

203
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:37,790
 Where are you? Ju Gyeong, just tell me where you are.

The last bus has already left! It's late. You should leave soon.

It's so chilly...

218
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:00,200

236
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:20,930
  No, she's not home yet. Gosh, Im Ju Bal. Where could she be at this hour? 

237
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:22,680
Okay.

Ju Gyeong...

241
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,850
Ju Gyeong.

242
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,730
Im Ju Gyeong.

243
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,760
 Pass Guaranteed for Cosmetician's Licence - Makeup Written Test

  Registration Card for Belle Academy 

245
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:04,340
J-Ju Gyeong, are you home?

246
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:06,660
You. Where have you been with your phone turned off?

247
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:07,640
The library.

248
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,300
- How dare you lie to me?! 
 - H-Honey...

249
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:13,300
You went to this Makeup Academy, didn't you?

250
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:16,270
I was wondering where you've been spending all of your time, coming home late afterwards.

251
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:17,610
Let's talk about this later.

252
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:21,290
How did you afford to register for classes?

253
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:23,870
Today has been a rough day.

254
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:26,130
- Let's talk tomorrow. 
 - Answer me right this instant!

255
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:29,020
How the hell did you afford to register and go behind your mother's back like this?!

256
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,960
Noona, you're home?

257
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:33,240
I took up part-time jobs.

258
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:37,560
What? Part-time?

259
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:40,430
You don't study when I tell you to, but what?! You work part-time?!

260
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:42,650
Who... who gave you the right?

261
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:45,160
I said let's talk tomorrow! Just leave me alone!

262
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,000
That's right, Dear. Let's talk tomorrow.

263
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,030
- Yeah, Mom. 
 - Tomorrow, my ass.

264
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:54,110
I want you to say that you aren't going to pursue makeup. Now!

265
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:57,010
You.

266
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,850
Why cosmetology of all things?

267
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:06,230
Do you want to end up like me?!

268
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:13,150
Go get a refund for your tuition, first thing tomorrow!

269
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:15,930
If you don't, I'll go get the refund myself.

270
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:19,220
If you do this crap one more time, you'll be kicked out of this house. Got it?!

271
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:21,570
Why are even you like this, Mom?

272
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:24,860
This is what I want to do. What's bad about that?

273
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:27,670
Why do people always tell me "No, you can't."

274
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:31,760
I want to do what I like and date whom I like!

275
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:36,450
Am I not allowed to be happy? Don't I have the right to be?!

276
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,240
You little brat! Get back here!

277
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,530
Honey, Honey, H-Honey.

278
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:42,330
Noona!

279
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:45,590
- Honey. 
 - Let go of me!

280
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:47,760
Let's talk tomorrow.

281
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:04,360
Noona.

282
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:33,630
 How did she manage to date Lee Su Ho with that face? How freaking unbalanced. 

283
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:35,700
 Lee Su Ho, snap out of it. 

284
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:39,360
  Won't their school have to pick a new school model? What if word spreads that their school is bomb-quality?  

285
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,980
  She sure lives an easy life, thanks to makeup. 

286
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:45,990
  - As I saw her, now my bare face looks like a goddess. 
 - To be honest, if this happened to me, I'd give up on life. 

287
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:49,720
  Who uploaded this? Wouldn't this video count as cyber-bullying? 

288
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:02,870
 I'm going to kill every single person who continues to write hate comments under my comment.  

289
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,500
Wow, he looks so serious.

290
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:14,070
I'm going to kill every single person who continues to write hate comments under my comment.

291
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:15,260
Ugh, so cringey, dude!

292
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:19,500
I'm going to kill every single person who continues to write hate comments under my comment~

293
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:23,100
- Quiet down. 
 - "Quiet down."

294
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,870
Hey, Kim Cho Rong. Kim Cho Rong!

295
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:28,450
Did you figure it out yet? The page admin?

296
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:30,870
Wait and see~

297
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:36,450
 If someone tells me who the page admin is, I'll set you up with Han Seo Jun. No lie. 

298
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:39,260
Jun-ie, what are you going to do when you find out who the admin is?

299
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:41,640
Are you going to be her knight in shining armor?

300
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,260
Our Jun-ie likes Im Ju—

301
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:45,930
Hey, hey. Eat this.

302
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:48,630
- It's Im Ju Gyeong! 
 - Where?!

303
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,930
Hey, I'm Ju Gyeong~

304
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:54,520
I'm hard to get~

305
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:45,950
Why did you call? Wanted to hear my voice first?

306
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:48,300
Stop.

307
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:51,350
Don't cross the road.

308
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:56,980
Let's just talk like this. I'm too weak to say it to your face.

309
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:58,890
What are you talking about?

310
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:02,550
We...

311
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:06,800
We should take a break.

312
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:10,040
Huh? All of a sudden? Why?

313
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:12,310
I don't think this is appropriate.

314
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:15,460
I didn't know that Ju Gyeong would be so affected by it.

315
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:20,680
If I had known that you were Ju Gyeong's older sister, I wouldn't have gotten involved in the first place.

316
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:24,600
That's an overreaction! Who breaks up over something like that?

317
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:28,630
I... I'm transferring schools next year.

318
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:33,360
In exactly one year from today, this second.

319
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:38,890
If your love for me hasn't faded by then, let's date again.

320
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:40,990
What? One year?!

321
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:45,950
Stop, stop! Please, stop!

322
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:52,310
Goodbye.

323
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:03,710
Jun Woo! Han Jun Woo!

324
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:07,160
What kind of dog shit was that? Goodness!

325
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,610
Oh, Su Ho!

326
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:20,580
- Why did you come here?
 - I've known you for so long.

327
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:24,460
I felt like I needed to apologize

328
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:26,100
for giving you a hard time about Se Yeon.

329
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:28,890
You should apologize to Se Yeon and his family.

330
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:30,460
You're right.

331
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:33,810
I visited them and asked for forgiveness.

332
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:37,050
I have to live the rest of my life with a guilty conscience.

333
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:43,620
Su Ho, the CEO really didn't know.

334
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:46,820
He took full responsibility regardless.

335
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:50,780
The things in the past are all a misunderstanding. He never crossed the line.

336
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:52,780
Why are you explaining all that?

337
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:56,480
He doesn't really show it but he loves you very much.

338
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,530
I know that.

339
00:26:58,530 --> 00:27:02,740
So... resent me,

340
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:05,480
but don't hate the CEO.

341
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:09,660
After hearing that you've been agonizing,

342
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:13,320
I really wanted to tell you this.

343
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:15,160
I'll get going.

344
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:30,020
 Are you free today? 

345
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:34,460
 I'm going abroad soon, so I'd like to see you before I leave. 

346
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:39,170
- Oh, Su Ho.
 - Where's Ju Gyeong?

347
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:41,020
I don't think she'll go to school again.

348
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:43,070
Then can you tell her to answer her phone?

349
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:45,560
She's not in a situation to answer phones and such.

350
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,690
 Warning
 Off Limits 

351
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:49,160
Aren't you going to school?

352
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,540
Are you protesting because I'm not letting you attend the beauty academy?

353
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:53,480
Why is her puberty here now?

354
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:58,050
Honey, just go to work. I'll talk with Ju Gyeong later.

355
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:02,380
Then tell her I'll wait at Prince Comics.

356
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:04,910
Wow, this is real love.

357
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:06,830
Still, will you cut class today again?

358
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:09,280
You should go.

359
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:14,050
When her mentality comes back, I'll have Dad make her answer the phone.

360
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:17,130
Let's go.

361
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:23,410
Wow, where did you get those shoes from?

362
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:28,180
I'm so immature. Forget it.

363
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:34,660
The school homepage is crazy, too.

364
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:36,870
There are so many negative comments!

365
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:41,000
- I think we should shut down the school homepage temporarily. 
 - Right?

366
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:44,970
 Then was she absent yesterday because of this? 

367
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:48,550
How should we resolve this?

368
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:52,320
The kids in the video aren't even from our school so we can't have a disciplinary committee.

369
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:56,090
And how do we find the kid who uploaded the video?

370
00:28:56,090 --> 00:28:59,290
- Is Ju Gyeong absent again today?
 - Yes.

371
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:02,150
Wow, a student refusing to be at school.

372
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,830
Looking at how things are, it seems pretty serious.

373
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:08,720
You should meet with Ju Gyeong's parents.

374
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,710
Yes, I will.

375
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:15,120
What should I do with this over-reacting Han Jun Woo?

376
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:19,010
 Just one year. If our love hasn't faded till then, 

377
00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:21,210
 let's date again. 

378
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:24,970
Miss Im, are the meeting materials ready?

379
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:30,390
What kind of bullshit is one year?

380
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:34,680
Take you time please.

381
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,880
   

382
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:46,530
Her face is totally messed up.

383
00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:50,190
Oh, Su Ho's here. Hi.

384
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:52,180
You should watch what you say.

385
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:58,500
Who did this?

386
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:01,600
You should just take it down. What are you doing?

387
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,780
Right.

388
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:08,110
How's Im Ju Gyeong?

389
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:15,820
The person who uploaded that video...

390
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:17,680
I know.

391
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,550
You know?

392
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:29,080
♫ I like you so much, what should I do?

393
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:32,350
♫ You're too pretty, what should I do?

394
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:35,460
Gosh, seriously my eyes are ruined.

395
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:38,330
I'm not in the mood to laugh. Stop it.

396
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:41,630
♫ Would you laugh for once, how would you look?

397
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:45,110
♫ Just laugh like this, hahaha.

398
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:46,990
Jeez, I'm laughing because of you.

399
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:48,390
My Su Ah laughed!

400
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:51,010
Su Ah, ♫ I'm so happy that you laughed.

401
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:55,070
♫ What should I do? What should I do?

402
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:59,410
♫ You're so pretty, what should I do?

403
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:03,770
♫ I'm so happy that you laughed, what should I do?

404
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:07,910
♫ I'm so so happy, what should I do?

405
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:11,220
Kids, time for morning assembly.

406
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:23,350
Ju Gyeong is absent again today.

407
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:27,130
Mr. Han, are we getting a new school model? Kids are all talking about it.

408
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:31,020
That's true. How can Ju Gyeong represent Saebom High?

409
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:33,930
- True, true. 
 - Right?

410
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:38,170
Is that why you guys took down all the posters?

411
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:42,870
You all know why Ju Gyeong didn't come to school

412
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:47,080
and how she would feel now, right?

413
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:50,230
But is there no one who worries about her?

414
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:56,100
I'm so disappointed in you, and I'm also scared of you.

415
00:31:56,100 --> 00:32:00,790
How can you laugh and gossip about a video of a classmate suffering?

416
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:07,000
To you,  the pain that Ju Gyeong suffered is  just ... just gossip.

417
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:16,800
 Ju Gyeong, did you eat? You aren't crying, are you? 

418
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:19,660
- Hey, that's Lee Su Ho. 
 - Could that really be true? He's not dating her, is he?

419
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:22,270
I am dating Im Ju Gyeong.

420
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:24,840
Wow, unbelievable.

421
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:27,990
Hey, Lee Su Ho! Don't you have something to tell me?

422
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:29,700
Tell you what?

423
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:32,420
Why didn't you tell me that you're dating Im Ju Gyeong?

424
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:36,350
Do you know how hard I tried to get you guys together? I thought you got rejected.

425
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:39,600
Because my heart was broken, I hurt so much here

426
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,630
that I couldn't even sleep.

427
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:44,300
And I was so worried. Did you even think of me as a friend?

428
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:48,140
Oh. Sorry. Ju Gyeong wanted to keep it a secret.

429
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:49,900
But you know what I'm more upset about?

430
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:53,120
It seemed like Han Seo Jun already knew about you two dating.

431
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,630
- So what?
 - Wow, now that you made up with Han Seo Jun, you keep leaving me out.

432
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:58,720
Who would you save first

433
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,310
if Han Seo Jun and I were both drowning?

434
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:01,960
- You first. 
 - Me first?

435
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,820
- You will save me first? 
 - Han Seo Jun is a good swimmer.

436
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:06,980
Either way, you'll save me first, right, Su Ho?

437
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:09,420
By the way...

438
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:11,150
Yes, ask me anything, my best friend.

439
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:14,130
How do you make your girlfriend feel better when she's upset?

440
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:18,280
I wasn't going to say this, but what should I do with you?

441
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:22,640
Ju Gyeong.

442
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,700
Aren't you going to eat?

443
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:28,520
I taped up

444
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:31,380
the registration card real well.

445
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:34,110
And I will persuade Mom.

446
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:36,600
So come out and eat.

447
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,490
Ju Gyeong.

448
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:47,370
This smells amazing.

449
00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:51,540
Wow, this looks so good, right?  It drives you crazy, doesn't it?

450
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:53,810
"Delicious Restaurant TV!"  This is the episode of Daddy's food.

451
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:57,600
The pork belly Dad's grilling is pouring out juice!

452
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:02,300
Wow, this looks good. Come out! You've got to come out and eat to gain strength to fight Mom.

453
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:04,460
So you can get permission to attend the academy.

454
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:07,010
I'll try one first.

455
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:10,470
Ju Gyeong, guess how good this is.

456
00:34:10,470 --> 00:34:12,730
There was never a pork like this.

457
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:15,280
Is this pork belly or ice cream?

458
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:21,020
Pork belly that Dad's grilling which melts like ice cream, try some!

459

 - Stop right there!

- Let go, you crazy bitch!
 - You are the crazy one.

471
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:10,600
Even if you got that tip, how can you upload that kind of thing on the bulletin board?

472
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,720
Whoever uploaded it is at fault.

473

00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:19,100
You told me to not use violence.

476
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:21,020
You told me to not even hit a flower.

477
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:24,220
- Oh my God!
 - Who are you? Let go!

478
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:26,760
Are you not letting go?!

479
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:29,030
- Wow.
 - It's Han Seo Jun.

480
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:31,350
Oppa Seo Jun.

481
00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:35,190
It's Han Seo Jun! It's Han Seo Jun!

482
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:38,170
- Why are you involving yourself, Oppa?
  - Oppa?

483
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:40,280
Did you know she is his sister?

484
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:43,150
What did you just say to my little sister?

485
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:45,270
- Your little sister?
 - He's her brother?

486
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:48,150
Han Go Woon is Han Seo Jun's sister?

487
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:52,010
- What bitch? 
 - Wow, unbelievable.

488
00:35:57,230 --> 00:36:01,380
Hey, are you the admin?

489
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:02,870
Yes.

490
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:05,450
You're deleting it, right?

491
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:10,590
Seriously, I told you to ignore me at school!

492
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:13,740
Then as your brother, how can I just watch you like that?

493
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:15,170
I was really holding back.

494
00:36:15,170 --> 00:36:17,560
You should've held back more.

495
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:22,670
But why does it matter that I'm your brother? Are you ashamed of me?

496
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,010
You don't know anything.

497
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:27,840
The kids will bug me like in middle school.

498
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:30,350
To introduce you to them, why do I not resemble you.

499
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:32,520
Bring all the jerks that say those things. I ought to—

500
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:36,430
Never mind. Don't you ever come down to Grade 10's floor.

501
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:37,970
Go Woon!

502
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:40,370
Hey, poop fly, don't you dare follow me.

503
00:36:40,370 --> 00:36:44,880
Why not? You were worried for me earlier.

504
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,480
Hey, hey.

505
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,110
W-W-What?

506
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:51,070
Are you still following my sister?

507
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:53,480
- You're going to get in trouble.
 - What?

508
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,460
Can't I have a crush on someone?

509
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:58,150
Have you never had a crush?

510
00:36:58,150 --> 00:37:02,030
You can't stop it easily even if someone scolds you.  Love is like that.

511
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:04,700
It doesn't work like that.

512
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:11,440
I bid you farewell.

513
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:31,790
Sorry.

514
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:41,940
Did something happen between you two?

515
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,760
No, why?

516
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:47,050
It's nothing.

517
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:50,580
Right, Ju Gyeong's video was deleted from the bulletin board.

518
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:53,230
Yeah? That's good.

519
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:54,890
Let's go.

520
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:15,040
Hyung Su Ho!  Wow, you're here again.

521
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,460
I said I'll let you know when my sister is better.

522
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:20,640
You should just camp out here.

523
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,760
Can you give this to her?

524
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,940
Thanks for caring but

525
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:25,760
she doesn't even come out of her room.

526
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:29,030
Then she probably didn't eat either. You just let her be like that?

527
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:31,080
I mean it's nice that you're caring for her,

528
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:33,700
but it's  not like I'm your messenger.

529
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:35,770
Do you need to get paid?

530
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:44,470
Should I take them off?

531
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:48,530
Hyung! I'd love that—

532
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:51,860
No, I can't sell off my sister like this.

533
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:55,510
Just give it to me. I just need to relay it, right?

534
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:17,080
Noona! Noona!

535
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:19,670
  Authorized Personnel Only! 

536
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:23,160
Wow, how can she not make a single sound?

537
00:39:24,050 --> 00:39:27,990
No way, Im Ju Bal... Is she thinking something bad?

538
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:31,670
Noona! No!

539
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:33,200
Noona!

540
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:37,680
Noona! You can't!

541
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:40,500
What are you doing?

542
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:44,630
Noona, you scared me!

543
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:47,400
Wait, wait!

544
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,570
This is from Su Ho.

545
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:51,760
Eat something.

546
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:59,470
Su Ho's been waiting since yesterday.

547
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:02,100
At least answer his calls.

548
00:40:30,290 --> 00:40:33,550
I wanted to come talk to you, Mr. Han.

549
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:37,540
To be honest, Ju Gyeong has been saying that she wants to pursue makeup.

550
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:39,560
I can't begin to explain how I feel inside.

551
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:43,090
She was working part-time behind my back so she could pay for classes at the Academy!

552
00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:46,210
Mr. Han, did you know about this?

553
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:52,230
Ma'am, I actually want to speak with you about a different matter today.

554
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:55,260
A different matter?

555
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:01,140
Ma'am, you may be shocked by this news, but

556
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:04,760
Ju Gyeong is going through this kind of situation right now...

557
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:07,790
I thought that we needed to let her parents know.

558
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:37,070
This... Is my Ju Gyeong?

559
00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:44,960
This isn't photoshopped or edited?

560
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:51,280
Is it really my J-Ju Gyeong...

561
00:41:55,390 --> 00:41:57,270
Ju Gyeong.

562
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:16,650
Im Ju Gyeong?

563
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:24,420
You're here?

564
00:42:25,270 --> 00:42:29,780
Were you waiting out here in the cold? You should have called.

565
00:42:29,790 --> 00:42:32,060
I wanted to ask you something.

566
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:35,850
Ask me something?

567
00:42:35,850 --> 00:42:38,530
There's no way that you'd do such a thing...

568
00:42:39,370 --> 00:42:42,400
But I keep having this scary thought.

569
00:42:44,210 --> 00:42:45,810
Su Jin.

570
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,120
It's not you, is it?

571
00:42:52,910 --> 00:42:55,030
My secret...

572
00:42:55,730 --> 00:42:59,450
And the fact that I'm dating Lee Su Ho.

573
00:42:59,450 --> 00:43:01,650
You're the only one who knows all of that.

574
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:06,360
No matter how I think about it, you're the only one.

575
00:43:07,730 --> 00:43:10,000
But still, it's not you, right?

576
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,100
You're not the person who posted about it, right?

577
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:15,030
If you're so convinced it's not me, why did you come to my house?

578
00:43:16,290 --> 00:43:19,210
I wanted to hear you say that it's not you.

579
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:25,620
Oh no. I don't think I can say that.

580
00:43:26,530 --> 00:43:27,970
Why?

581
00:43:30,470 --> 00:43:32,460
Why are you being like this?

582
00:43:33,370 --> 00:43:36,220
Why exactly are you doing this to me?

583
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:39,360
Because I can't stand to see you next to him.

584
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:42,530
What?

585
00:43:42,530 --> 00:43:45,490
Didn't you run away here after what happened at Yongpa High?

586
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:50,430
Why don't you just run away again? You're good at that.

587
00:43:50,430 --> 00:43:55,630
You should run away as far as possible, and hide yourself so no one can find you.

588
00:43:55,630 --> 00:43:57,880
This is how I truly feel.

589
00:45:09,730 --> 00:45:13,250
 Im Ju Gyeong's spot. 
 Sitting without permission will cause hair to grow on your butt! 

590
00:45:40,810 --> 00:45:43,720
I finished tidying up. Is there anything else you need me to do?

591
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:46,450
I said it's fine. Just enjoy some comic books.

592
00:45:46,450 --> 00:45:47,870
Time goes by faster if I keep myself busy.

593
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:50,760
So then why are you spending so much time here?

594
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:53,640
- Be honest. You got rejected by Ju Bal, right? 
 - No, I didn't!

595
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:58,850
Come on, it's always the same reason when a guy spends all of his time in front of his girlfriend's house.

596
00:45:58,850 --> 00:46:01,480
I said, that's not it.

597
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:03,180
Isn't it frustrating?

598
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:08,200
Pick a card. I'll read Ju Gyeong's feelings for you.

599
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:09,470
Forget it.

600
00:46:09,470 --> 00:46:11,640
You need to kill your time, anyway.

601
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:13,550
Pick a card.

602
00:46:24,370 --> 00:46:26,780
  The Lovers 

603
00:46:28,190 --> 00:46:31,540
This card is "The Lovers."

604
00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:34,200
What does it mean if you picked it up reversed?

605
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:35,970
One second...

606
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:40,280
 In reading Tarot cards, a card selected upside down is called "reversal" or "reversed card". 

607
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:45,780
 The Lovers, reversed meaning: breaking up 

608
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:49,080
 Breaking up  

609
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:53,600
 The Lovers 

610
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:19,420
Noona!

611
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:21,230
Where have you been?

612
00:47:21,230 --> 00:47:22,880
I was just out in front of the house.

613
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:24,340
Did you eat?

614
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:26,260
I'm not hungry.

615
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:30,590
Why won't you eat? You little—

616
00:47:35,930 --> 00:47:37,940
Poor thing...

617
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:40,710
Mom.

618
00:47:41,310 --> 00:47:43,690
Mom went to the school.

619
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:49,100
Why didn't you tell me?

620
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:54,030
You should have told me. Why did you go through that alone?

621
00:47:54,670 --> 00:47:58,320
I didn't tell you because I knew you'd react this way. How could I tell you?

622
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:02,600
But still, I'm your mom. I should have known.

623
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:07,050
I didn't even know my baby was harassed like that...

624
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:20,000
Who did that to you? I'm going to go do the same thing to them!

625
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,110
Who was it? Tell me everything.

626
00:48:22,110 --> 00:48:23,330
Oh, Mom.

627
00:48:23,330 --> 00:48:25,780
- Oh, Mom.  
 - Mom, stop crying.

628
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:28,080
Ju Gyeong will be sad.

629
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:33,990
You must have suffered so much.

630
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:41,470
Those kids...

631
00:48:42,790 --> 00:48:46,460
Did they hit you?

632
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:49,490
Where did they hit you?

633
00:48:49,490 --> 00:48:52,480
Tell Mom everything.

634
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:56,510
No, they didn't hit me.

635
00:48:56,510 --> 00:48:59,270
It's all in the past. It's okay.

636
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:02,080
It's okay.

637
00:49:08,180 --> 00:49:10,240
My baby.

638
00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:14,160
I'm so sorry.

639
00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:41,550
I had no idea because she's always smiling and easygoing.

640
00:49:43,470 --> 00:49:46,480
It's because I always broke her spirits.

641
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:50,310
She was too afraid of me to talk to me.

642
00:49:50,310 --> 00:49:51,700
It's all my fault.

643
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:54,500
Why is this your fault, Dear?

644
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:02,080
After Ju Gyeong was born, I conceived Ju Yeong right away.

645
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:06,330
So Ju Gyeong was raised in the countryside, without a lot of attention.

646
00:50:06,330 --> 00:50:09,790
And people always asked us if we had adopted or fostered her from somewhere.

647
00:50:10,730 --> 00:50:14,910
She didn't receive affection at home, so she didn't receive affection elsewhere.

648
00:50:16,810 --> 00:50:21,690
It's my fault for not being able to raise her

649
00:50:21,690 --> 00:50:24,540
like a beautiful, precious, elegant princess.

650
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:26,510
Who else can I blame it on?

651
00:50:28,090 --> 00:50:30,340
It's my fault.

652
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:36,040
I made you too busy with work to take care of our kids, so it's my fault.

653
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:38,750
All I did was scolding her for wearing makeup.

654
00:50:39,450 --> 00:50:43,600
That's why she was so upset when I threw away her cosmetics.

655
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:53,650
I'm sorry that I was so clueless all this time.

656
00:50:56,490 --> 00:51:01,200
It's no big deal. Don't worry about what those people say about you.

657
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:03,330
You decide your own self-worth.

658
00:51:03,330 --> 00:51:07,640
As long as you are confident, no one can touch you. Okay?

659
00:51:11,530 --> 00:51:13,890
Ju Gyeong, stop crying and go to sleep.

660
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:23,070
Get out.

661
00:52:23,070 --> 00:52:25,340
- Why? 
 - Come on, get out.

662
00:52:26,750 --> 00:52:29,650
- Where are we going? 
 - Don't ask questions. Just follow me.

663
00:52:29,650 --> 00:52:31,450
Ah, seriously...

664
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:44,680
Would you mind taking off your glasses?

665
00:52:51,870 --> 00:52:55,120
I can estimate what procedures we can do.

666
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:59,180
Please make her drop-dead gorgeous, like a goddess.

667
00:52:59,180 --> 00:53:01,920
- G-Goddess? 
 - Mom...

668
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:06,450
Since you already have double eyelids as a base,

669
00:53:06,450 --> 00:53:10,900
we can make your eyes more prominent with a non-incisional procedure.

670
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:15,240
Cut in the front and cut in the back.

671
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:18,970
We can make your eyes look bigger. Like a photo filter, you know?

672
00:53:18,970 --> 00:53:23,280
For your nose, we can enhance your nose with some silicone.

673
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:29,110
We can transplant some cartilage from your left ear onto the tip of your nose and make it more prominent.

674
00:53:29,110 --> 00:53:32,540
Her nose is shaped like a clove of garlic. It's so adorable.

675
00:53:32,540 --> 00:53:35,570
A lot of people have told her that her nose is pretty.

676
00:53:36,550 --> 00:53:42,250
From a medical perspective, this is definitely... not a pretty nose.

677
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:47,450
Now, we can make an incision at the hairline and do a face lift.

678
00:53:47,450 --> 00:53:52,100
After lifting the skin as much as we can, we'll transfer some fat from your buttocks,

679
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:56,400
And insert it into the forehead, chin, and cheekbones.

680
00:53:57,740 --> 00:53:59,980
Your full face will be voluminous,

681
00:54:00,050 --> 00:54:03,050
and your flat face will become more contoured.

682
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:06,690
Who cares if it's contoured? It's not like she's from another country.

683
00:54:06,690 --> 00:54:09,850
We can shave down her jawline,

684
00:54:09,850 --> 00:54:11,460
and reduce her cheekbones from the side.

685
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:14,500
Is her face an apple? Why do you need to shave it down.

686
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:17,350
That's how we can make the jawline slimmer. A V-Line.

687
00:54:17,350 --> 00:54:20,490
A person's face needs to have some structure to it in order for them to live a prosperous life!

688
00:54:20,490 --> 00:54:23,180
Then what do you expect me to do?

689
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:25,310
Honestly, if you want this face to be prettier,

690
00:54:25,310 --> 00:54:27,820
you need to change everything.

691
00:54:27,820 --> 00:54:30,920
Are you renovating a house?! Why would you change everything?

692
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:33,080
You have to cut, shave, and sew in order for a person to be pretty?

693
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:36,080
Beauty and ugliness, who defines those standards?!

694
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:38,090
My daughter is beautiful in my eyes.

695
00:54:38,090 --> 00:54:41,190
Mom, why are you being like this? Let's just leave.

696
00:54:41,190 --> 00:54:43,520
Goodness. Would you like to see for yourself?

697
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:45,870
If you want this face to become beautiful like this,

698
00:54:45,870 --> 00:54:48,800
You need to change everything!

699
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:52,540
Goodness, goodness. You'd make a face like  this   with all of that money?

700
00:54:52,540 --> 00:54:55,210
This is what she looks like when she has makeup on.

701
00:54:55,210 --> 00:55:00,610
Wow, my daughter's makeup skills are way better than any surgery.

702
00:55:00,610 --> 00:55:05,230
Let's go. Why would we operate on a face that's just fine?

703
00:55:05,230 --> 00:55:07,900
W-Wait.

704
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:13,370
A goddess?

705
00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:33,280
I heard that video spread all over the school.

706
00:55:35,590 --> 00:55:41,330
Don't worry. I'm going to transfer you to a school where no one knows you.

707
00:55:41,330 --> 00:55:43,570
What?

708
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:01,740
 Prince Comics 

709
00:56:02,890 --> 00:56:07,080
  Why don't you just run away again? You're good at that. 

710
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:11,880
  You should run away as far as possible, and hide yourself so no one can find you.  

711
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:14,200
  This is how I truly feel.  

712
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:23,950
It's Im Ju Gyeong.

713
00:56:33,570 --> 00:56:35,520
Did you cry?

714
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:37,650
No.

715
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:42,660
Then why won't you show me your face?

716
00:56:42,660 --> 00:56:46,040
- I feel so sorry to you. 
 - For what?

717
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:51,630
People are talking badly about you, and it's all my fault.

718
00:56:52,410 --> 00:56:54,700
So that's why I can't bear to look at you.

719
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:57,810
Still, let me see your face.

720
00:56:59,950 --> 00:57:05,640
I was waiting here for you for so long. Squirrel, squirrel~

721
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:10,640
Oh? You won't smile even if I do this? Meow, meow~

722
00:57:11,650 --> 00:57:15,550
That's from forever ago.

723
00:57:16,350 --> 00:57:18,230
You still don't recognize me.

724
00:57:18,230 --> 00:57:20,260
Huh?

725
00:57:24,250 --> 00:57:26,640
What a relief.

726
00:57:28,550 --> 00:57:31,040
I missed you so much.

727
00:57:45,770 --> 00:57:47,830
- Let's go. 
 - Huh?

728
00:57:47,830 --> 00:57:51,690
How long are you planning to hide in here? Let's go.

729
00:57:57,430 --> 00:57:58,930
Are you tired already?

730
00:57:58,930 --> 00:58:02,830
Should we just turn around?

731
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:05,200
Put some strength into it, some strength.

732
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:08,840
I haven't eaten yet, so...

733
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:11,010
I have no strength.

734
00:58:11,010 --> 00:58:12,850
This won't do.

735
00:58:12,850 --> 00:58:15,170
Okay, let's just turn around.

736
00:58:15,170 --> 00:58:18,260
Whoa, I said we should just turn around.

737
00:58:18,260 --> 00:58:20,670
- I'm heavy! 
 - Come on.

738
00:58:20,670 --> 00:58:23,680
I said, I'm heavy!

739
00:58:27,910 --> 00:58:30,540
You feel a bit better as we are out here, don't you?

740
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:34,340
Yeah, it's nice.

741
00:58:34,340 --> 00:58:38,350
That day... Why did you leave?

742
00:58:39,750 --> 00:58:45,760
I'm by your side now, so why did you run away?

743
00:58:47,670 --> 00:58:52,230
Good question. I ran away again.

744
00:58:53,670 --> 00:58:55,510
I think I just wanted to hide.

745
00:58:55,510 --> 00:58:58,340
Why would you hide? You did nothing wrong.

746
00:58:58,340 --> 00:59:00,850
It's embarrassing.

747
00:59:01,740 --> 00:59:07,110
Everyone knows my true face now.

748
00:59:08,510 --> 00:59:11,230
What do I do now?

749
00:59:12,820 --> 00:59:15,810
Then is your face fake after you put makeup on?

750
00:59:17,180 --> 00:59:21,910
No matter what you look like, whether you're wearing makeup or not,

751
00:59:21,910 --> 00:59:24,640
you're always going to be yourself, Im Ju Gyeong.

752
00:59:27,110 --> 00:59:29,660
I saw this expression somewhere.

753
00:59:29,660 --> 00:59:34,830
Do you know which country has the tastiest tomatoes?

754
00:59:34,830 --> 00:59:37,120
Spain, apparently.

755
00:59:38,930 --> 00:59:40,740
- Really? 
 - Yeah.

756
00:59:40,740 --> 00:59:45,050
It's quite difficult to grow tomatoes on the land in Spain.

757
00:59:45,050 --> 00:59:47,000
That’s why the tomatoes taste better.

758
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:50,400
Why? You just said they're hard to grow there.

759
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:52,890
They're delicious because it's difficult.

760
00:59:52,890 --> 00:59:55,810
They try their hardest to survive,

761
00:59:55,850 --> 01:00:01,450
so they become stronger and more fragrant.

762
01:00:01,450 --> 01:00:03,810
I see.

763
01:00:04,570 --> 01:00:07,400
You see, the ones that are a little rough around the edges,

764
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:11,760
bruised, and ugly are the tastiest fruits.

765
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:15,370
The same probably goes for people, right?

766
01:00:16,830 --> 01:00:19,440
Are you trying to say that I'm ugly?

767
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:21,690
Yep.

768
01:00:21,690 --> 01:00:26,330
Just kidding. You probably don't know, but...

769
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:30,620
You're way stronger than you know.

770
01:00:32,330 --> 01:00:34,640
You're stronger than I am.

771
01:00:40,510 --> 01:00:44,640
I'm thinking to get a little stronger too, now.

772
01:01:13,090 --> 01:01:16,000
Why did I come here?

773
01:01:17,780 --> 01:01:21,780
  It fits perfectly. Wear these and come to me. 

774
01:01:21,780 --> 01:01:26,260
  I'll treat you well. Come to me, Han Jun Woo. 

775
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:35,380
These two feet... they keep leading me to you, Hui Gyeong.

776
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:49,640
Oh no!

777
01:01:53,540 --> 01:01:56,560
- Hui Gyeong. 
 - Oh.

778
01:01:56,560 --> 01:02:00,670
- What are you doing at my office? 
 - I saw that your company has had a lot of lawsuits recently.

779
01:02:00,670 --> 01:02:03,610
Did you just get off of work?

780
01:02:03,610 --> 01:02:05,800
It's about time for our Hui Gyeong-ie to get hungry.

781
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:07,790
Do you want to eat dinner? Together?

782
01:02:07,790 --> 01:02:10,140
We're in no relationship to be eating dinner together.

783
01:02:10,140 --> 01:02:13,590
Not in a relationship to be  unable  to have dinner either.  Come on, it's not like I asked you to date me again.

784
01:02:13,590 --> 01:02:15,870
I just wanted to eat a meal with you.

785
01:02:15,870 --> 01:02:17,830
If not, then are you seeing someone?

786
01:02:17,830 --> 01:02:20,200
Seeing?

787
01:02:26,430 --> 01:02:28,480
Of course not.

788
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:32,190
For one year, I'm single.

789
01:02:32,190 --> 01:02:34,480
Let's go eat, then. Where should we go?

790
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:36,770
You like spicy food. Let's go eat something spicy.

791
01:02:36,770 --> 01:02:38,750
Sounds good.

792
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:42,740

793
01:02:46,570 --> 01:02:48,780
Thank you.

794
01:03:33,220 --> 01:03:35,330
   Are you okay? 

795
01:03:45,970 --> 01:03:48,400
   Is Im Ju Gyeong okay? 

796
01:03:50,210 --> 01:03:52,750
  I saw that the video got taken down. 

797
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:09,610
Are you going to cut classes tomorrow, too?

798
01:04:09,620 --> 01:04:11,780
My mom offered to transfer me to a different school.

799
01:04:11,780 --> 01:04:13,280
What?

800
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:15,380
She's probably just saying that.

801
01:04:15,380 --> 01:04:18,990
Does that make sense? We can't even afford to move houses.

802
01:04:21,880 --> 01:04:24,620
I don't want to go inside.

803
01:04:24,620 --> 01:04:27,030
When I see my mom looking sad,

804
01:04:27,030 --> 01:04:30,610
it breaks my heart, and I feel so sorry.

805
01:04:31,830 --> 01:04:34,310
So you're not going to go home all night long?

806
01:04:34,310 --> 01:04:36,830
That sounds good to me.

807
01:04:38,190 --> 01:04:40,350
I'll go inside.

808
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:43,400
Wait a second.

809
01:04:47,380 --> 01:04:49,120
Here.

810
01:04:50,590 --> 01:04:55,250
Tonight, you need to make sure Im Ju Gyeong can sleep with no anxieties.

811
01:04:55,250 --> 01:04:57,610
Got it?

812
01:05:06,850 --> 01:05:12,050
- I'll see you tomorrow. 
 - Okay.

813
01:05:40,310 --> 01:05:42,280
  ♡Boyfriend♡ 

814
01:05:46,510 --> 01:05:50,180
 Where are you? 
 Ju Gyeong? 
 I asked where are you, so tell me! 

815
01:05:54,750 --> 01:05:58,590
♫   I like you so much, what do I do? What do I do? 

816
01:05:58,590 --> 01:06:02,380
♫   You're so beautiful, what do I do? What do I do? 

817
01:06:02,380 --> 01:06:06,620
♫   Will you smile just once? What do you think? 

818
01:06:06,650 --> 01:06:09,150
♫   Don't make any excuses and just smile— 

819
01:06:09,150 --> 01:06:11,750
 I'm waiting, so be sure to call me. 

820
01:06:18,750 --> 01:06:22,850
♫   You're so beautiful, what do I do? What do I do? 

821
01:06:22,850 --> 01:06:28,310
  Su Ah, it's so nice to see you smile. What do I do? What do I do? 

822
01:06:47,010 --> 01:06:51,360
 ♫ I like you so much, what do I do? What do I do? 

823
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:55,790
 ♫ You're so pretty, what do I do? What do I do? 

824
01:06:55,790 --> 01:07:00,180
 ♫ Don't make any excuse but just smile. What do you think? 

825
01:07:07,020 --> 01:07:11,300
 ♫ I like you so much, what do I do? What do I do? 

826
01:07:11,300 --> 01:07:15,390
 ♫ You're so pretty, what do I do? What do I do? 

827
01:07:15,390 --> 01:07:19,370
 ♫ Would you give me a smile? What do you think? 

828
01:07:19,370 --> 01:07:24,670
 ♫ Don't make any excuse but just smile, hahaha, hahaha. 

829
01:07:37,470 --> 01:07:39,780
He must've left.

830
01:07:45,110 --> 01:07:47,030
Lee Su Ho.

831
01:07:53,930 --> 01:07:56,520
Why are you out?

832
01:07:56,520 --> 01:07:58,820
What's this?

833
01:08:00,190 --> 01:08:02,190
I'm leaving.

834
01:08:07,050 --> 01:08:10,880
- Go in, or you'll catch a cold. 
 - Okay.

835
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:12,740
Good night.

836
01:08:13,540 --> 01:08:15,480
Good night.

837
01:09:05,030 --> 01:09:11,790
 It'll be hard right now, but I'd like you to have a conversation at least.  

838
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:21,440
 I'm going abroad soon, so I'd really like to see you before I leave. 

839
01:09:21,440 --> 01:09:25,120
 I hope you won't regret anything. 

840
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:37,360
Thank you.

841
01:09:52,650 --> 01:09:53,810
Su Ho.

842
01:09:53,810 --> 01:09:56,810
I'm in front of your house. Are you home?

843
01:09:56,810 --> 01:09:58,520
My house?

844
01:09:59,970 --> 01:10:01,750
You're in front of my house?

845
01:10:01,750 --> 01:10:02,890
 Yes. 

846
01:10:02,890 --> 01:10:05,600
What to do? I'm at the airport right now.

847
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:09,140
I'm going to be in US for a while.

848
01:10:09,140 --> 01:10:12,030
 - The reporters here—
  - When will you come back to Korea?

849
01:10:12,030 --> 01:10:16,920
I need to finish up something at work, so I'll be back around next month.

850
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:21,240
Su Ho.

851
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:27,940
How about coming with me to the US for a while? And study music there.

852
01:10:27,940 --> 01:10:31,740
I don't want to. I'll see you when you come back.

853
01:10:31,740 --> 01:10:37,250
When you come... buy me something delicious.

854
01:10:38,900 --> 01:10:40,160
 Bye. 

855
01:10:40,160 --> 01:10:42,230
Su Ho.

856
01:10:43,190 --> 01:10:47,640
Okay, I'll see you when I come back.

857
01:10:59,890 --> 01:11:00,960
- Director Kang.
 - Yes.

858
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:03,830
- Make a reservation at a restaurant on the day I come back.
 - Yes, sir.

859
01:11:03,830 --> 01:11:06,070
No, I'll take care of that.

860
01:11:06,070 --> 01:11:08,120
Find out what kids like these days.

861
01:11:08,120 --> 01:11:09,250
I will.

862
01:11:09,250 --> 01:11:12,340
- Is that Lee Ju Heon?
 - It's Lee Ju Heon.

863
01:11:19,380 --> 01:11:21,730
Breakfast!

864
01:11:21,730 --> 01:11:23,480
That smells good!

865
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:25,530
The smells just bursts into your room, right?

866
01:11:25,530 --> 01:11:26,450
Yeah, is it someone's birthday?

867
01:11:26,450 --> 01:11:29,000
What birthday? It's for Ju Gyeong.

868
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:32,090
She's been starving for days.

869
01:11:33,320 --> 01:11:38,520
There's bulgogi that Ju Gyeong loves.

870
01:11:38,520 --> 01:11:40,350
Oh, there's also japchae!

871
01:11:40,350 --> 01:11:44,290
Mrs. Hong made all the things Ju Gyeong loves!

872
01:11:49,430 --> 01:11:51,330
Im Ju Bal!

873
01:11:53,360 --> 01:11:56,940
Little Noona, come eat.

874
01:11:57,860 --> 01:11:59,860
Noona?

875
01:12:00,830 --> 01:12:04,420
Im Ju Bal, why aren't you answerin— Huh?

876
01:12:05,460 --> 01:12:08,910
What? When did she get out?

877
01:12:23,930 --> 01:12:26,340
What the heck?

878
01:12:41,530 --> 01:12:43,720
Why did she come like that?

879
01:12:56,500 --> 01:13:01,000
- Did she come bare faced? 
 - Is that her bare face?

880
01:13:20,020 --> 01:13:22,320
Wow, look at how self-confident she is.

881
01:13:49,260 --> 01:13:50,440
Ju Gyeong, you're here.

882
01:13:50,440 --> 01:13:52,820
- Are you okay? 
 - Yup.

883
01:13:52,820 --> 01:13:54,600
Ju Gyeong, you're really cool.

884
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:57,330
You're a real woman.

885
01:14:00,650 --> 01:14:02,890
S-Su Ah!

886
01:14:02,890 --> 01:14:05,020
Su Ah! Su Ah!

887
01:14:05,020 --> 01:14:06,210
Where are you going?

888
01:14:06,210 --> 01:14:08,080
Choi Su Ah!

889
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:09,320
Su Ah!

890
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:12,910
Su Ah! Su Ah!

891
01:14:19,340 --> 01:14:23,730
Hey.  I heard that Im Ju Gyeong came to school bare-faced. Wow, she's really full of herself.

892
01:14:23,730 --> 01:14:26,020
Do you think it's true she's dating Lee Su Ho?

893
01:14:26,020 --> 01:14:29,140
Seeing her bare face earlier, it looked a lot worse than the picture.

894
01:14:29,140 --> 01:14:32,860
He probably broke up after seeing her bare face. How can you date someone with that face?

895
01:14:32,860 --> 01:14:36,010
Isn't Lee Su Ho out these days, too? His dad is totally out.

896
01:14:36,010 --> 01:14:40,530
- Maybe he's lost it and dating anybody.
 - Wow, that's harsh.

897
01:14:40,530 --> 01:14:43,390
- Hey, let's go. 
 -  Let's go.

898
01:14:43,390 --> 01:14:46,520
- Hey, what is this? 
 - Hey, hey, hey.

899
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:03,200
Hey, you guys!

900
01:15:03,200 --> 01:15:05,320
Take back what you just said.

901
01:15:05,320 --> 01:15:07,380
Who is that?

902
01:15:07,380 --> 01:15:09,790
Im Ju Gyeong?

903
01:15:09,790 --> 01:15:12,340
Walking around bare-faced, you must be crazy.

904
01:15:12,340 --> 01:15:13,430
You aren't going to?

905
01:15:13,430 --> 01:15:16,220
Right, I'm dating Lee Su Ho.

906
01:15:16,220 --> 01:15:19,250
Lee Su Ho is my boyfriend!

907
01:15:19,250 --> 01:15:22,280
Happy? Does that resolve your curiosity?

908
01:15:22,280 --> 01:15:24,980
- I think she's crazy. 
 - I think you're right.

909
01:15:24,980 --> 01:15:28,100
He doesn't discriminate against people for their looks.

910
01:15:28,100 --> 01:15:31,170
And he likes me as who I am no matter how I look.

911
01:15:31,170 --> 01:15:33,990
So he's so much better than you guys with ruined personalities.

912
01:15:33,990 --> 01:15:37,020
So don't gossip about him to drag him down

913
01:15:37,020 --> 01:15:38,480
but come and talk to me personally from now on.

914
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:40,450
I will counter every single thing, got it?

915
01:15:40,450 --> 01:15:43,350
- So refreshing. 
 - Her courage is amazing.

916
01:15:43,350 --> 01:15:47,340
And rather than evaluating people's looks, study!

917
01:15:47,340 --> 01:15:50,190
Do you know who comes after the Great King Sejong? You don't, right?

918
01:15:50,190 --> 01:15:51,440
Isn't it Shin Saimdang?

919
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:54,750
So dumb. Get out of my way!

920
01:16:22,180 --> 01:16:30,590
♫  When I'm looking at you, I'm so excited  ♫

921
01:16:31,510 --> 01:16:38,990
♫  Because it feels like I'm flying in the sky. I’m falling in love  ♫

922
01:16:38,990 --> 01:16:45,960
♫  It's windy. When your scent reaches me  ♫

923
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:52,590
♫  I can even feel a soft small breath  ♫

924
01:16:52,590 --> 01:16:58,470
♫  Is this love  ♫

925
01:16:58,470 --> 01:17:02,760
♫  Love so fine  ♫

926
01:17:02,760 --> 01:17:11,290
♫  Come closer, approach me. Lean in my arms  ♫

927
01:17:11,290 --> 01:17:18,680
♫  Always in my heart. I think I’m in love with you  ♫

928
01:17:20,220 --> 01:17:22,000
 Epilogue  
 Hey.

929
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,150
 I'm hungry. 

930
01:17:24,150 --> 01:17:26,120
 Then should we go get some tteokbokki? 

931
01:17:26,120 --> 01:17:27,970
 - Okay! 
 - Okay! 

932
01:17:27,970 --> 01:17:30,080
 Excuse me. 

933
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:33,190
 Can't I come with you? 

934
01:17:33,190 --> 01:17:37,250
 What? You're not friends with us. 

935
01:17:37,250 --> 01:17:40,150
 - What's wrong with her? 
 - I know, right? 

936
01:17:40,150 --> 01:17:42,790
 Let's go over there. 

937
01:17:52,910 --> 01:17:55,490
  
 - Are you crying? 

938
01:17:59,430 --> 01:18:03,690
 Is it because the comic is too scary? 

939
01:18:04,570 --> 01:18:06,560
 It's okay, don't cry. 

940
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:09,110
 This is not at all scary, squirrel. 

941
01:18:09,110 --> 01:18:13,190
 Squirrel, I'm a squirrel, squirrel. 

942
01:18:13,190 --> 01:18:15,550
 You're still not laughing? Meow. 

943
01:18:15,550 --> 01:18:20,400
 Meow, meow, a cat. 

944
01:18:21,370 --> 01:18:25,940
 Finally you're laughing! Squirrel, I'm a squirrel. 

945
01:18:25,940 --> 01:18:31,230
 You know what? If you cry then laugh, hair will grow from your butt. 

946
01:18:31,230 --> 01:18:33,760
 I'm a squirrel, squirrel. 

947
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:36,730
 Squirrel. 

948
01:18:41,150 --> 01:18:48,190


949
01:18:48,190 --> 01:18:50,920
