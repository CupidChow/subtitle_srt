00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:13,240

 Episode 12 

5
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:44,220
 Lee Ju Heon makes  declaration of conscience related to Jeong Se Yeon's death. 

6
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:00,860
Lee Su Ho!

7
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:13,040
It's Im Ju Gyeong again.

8
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,820
Yeah.

9
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,530
It's me again.

10
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:26,550
I missed you.

11
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,840
And you came.

12
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:36,100
I came to give you a hug.

13
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,880
Are you doing okay?

14
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:06,020
I barely have any memories of time spent with my dad.

15
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:08,680
After my mom passed away,

16
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,320
my dad was almost always in the United States.

17
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:15,870
I used to live with my maternal grandma,

18
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:18,670
but I've lived by myself since middle school.

19
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:22,910
That must have been difficult.

20
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:26,980
I resented him for a long time.

21
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:32,790
All of the things that I had repressed deep down,

22
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:35,910
they came spilling out today.

23
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,790
And I thought that I would feel the weight off of my shoulders,

24
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,470
but it feels as heavy as ever.

25
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:00,800
Whether it's because I haven't forgiven him yet

26
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,250
or  I feel sorry for him

27
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:06,640
I don't really know...

28
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:11,520
how I'm feeling right now.

29
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:32,380
What? You ran out without a word?

30
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:34,530
Honey, Honey, calm down. Let's talk about it.

31
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:36,610
What the hell were you thinking?

32
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:41,500
Do you know what an important time in your life this is?!

33
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:45,550
How dare you—! Don't look at me like that!

34
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,260
- Why, you little—! 
 - Honey, Honey, wait!

35
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:54,440
Honey! Honey!

36
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:59,870
How dare you? Open the door right this instant!

37
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:02,680
Calm down, Honey!

38
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,970
Open this door!

39
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:33,710
  Team Leader Kang, how's the office?  

40
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:35,410
  It's a complete mess.  

41
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:38,630
  Reporters and Black Soul fans have camped out in front of the building.  

42
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,610
  In one way or another, the huge damage to the company is mounting.  

43
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:43,350
  The CEO is probably overwhelmed, too.  

44
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:20,370
♫  A sky colored violet  ♫

45
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:29,200
♫  A night getting colder in the mournful wind  ♫

46
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:35,050
♫  The familiar memories etched on my heart  ♫

47
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:42,090
♫  The night filled again with you  ♫

48
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:50,160
♫  Remain just as grateful memories  ♫

49
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:55,740
 Hey. 
   

50
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,520
 Huh? 

51
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:01,710
  Ugh, this one is too loose!  

52
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:06,080
  - Yours is crooked! 
 - Try this on. 

53
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:14,120
 Lee Su Ho, Han Seo Jun. 

54
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,410
 It looks good. 

55
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:18,520
 This is so cringey, I almost didn't write it. 

56
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:23,920
  During my first place acceptance speech, I was crying too hard to talk about you guys. 

57
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:27,260
 I'm writing this just in case you're sad about it. 

58
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:36,930
 Thanks to you guys appearing in my cold life, 

59
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:40,580
 These past three years have been really warm. 

60
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:46,000
 As we spent those warm days together, I smiled a lot. 

61
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,220
 I gained a lot of confidence, too.  

62
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,880
 And I was able to make my dreams come true. 

63
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:58,750
♫  When my song reaches the sky  ♫

64
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:02,140
♫  Come slowly like an eternal dream  ♫

65
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:04,750
 The brightest day of my lifetime 

66
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:11,290
 is today, being here with you guys in this moment. I'll remember it forever. 

67
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:17,690
 My precious friends, 

68
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,750
 I love you. 

69
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:27,150
 When you read this letter, I'll probably want to high-kick under my blanket (for this embarrassment). 

70
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:30,410
 So I hope that this letter stays hidden forever. 

71
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:32,230
 From Se Yeon. 

72
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,510
Do you remember what Se Yeon said on the day we bought these bracelets?

73
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:58,430
- For us to stay together forever? 
 - And I said that it's childish or something like that.

74
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:01,860
Yes, you did.

75
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:05,100
That seemed so obvious at the time.

76
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,970
I thought we would be together for the rest of our lives.

77
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:12,930
But who knew that that life would be so short?

78
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:18,020
I know, right? It was too short.

79
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:20,960
After leaving him alone during such a difficult time...

80
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,780
I felt so sorry and regretted it like crazy.

81
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:27,630
But that rascal isn't here anymore.

82
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:31,170
So if I didn't grab you and curse you out constantly,

83
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:34,500
I didn't think I could handle it.

84
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:41,050
But due to my own pain, I couldn't see that you were hurt too.

85
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:45,720
I'm sorry.

86
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,950
Why are we like this?

87
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,070
 Missed call from Father 

88
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,890
How's your dad doing?

89
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:14,730
I don't know.

90
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:18,750
I used to be so jealous that you have a rich dad.

91
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,890
But now I'm not jealous at all, Dude.

92
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:24,260
What's there to be jealous of? You have a mom.

93
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:26,440
Are you trying to have a pity competition here?

94
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:29,130
Your family has a lot of money!

95
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:30,640
Won't we be broke now, though?

96
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,180
People say that, even if a wealthy person goes broke, they can still afford to eat three meals a day.

97
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:36,560
Three generations, not meals. You dummy.

98
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,130
- What? 
 - Do you even know anything?

99
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:43,290
Who the hell is throwing cigarette butts?!

100
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:47,100
Who, me?

101
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:54,400
Did you just throw a cigarette butt at a human being? You're such a thug, old man.

102
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,330
This little baby just called me a thug.

103
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:58,290
What the hell?

104
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:00,770
Hey. Who the hell are you guys?

105
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:04,170
Who are you? I asked a question.

106
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:07,020
Come here, little guy.

107
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:09,040
Oh, wow.

108
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,620
Restrain yourself a little, will you?

109
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:13,480
Hey. Run!

110
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,680
- Hey!  Hey! 
 - Grab them.

111
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,800
Come back!

112
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:24,850
Hey! Are you going to throw that?

113
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,900
Damn it!

114
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:29,850
Get back here!

115
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:31,340
Come here quickly!

116
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:33,120
Stop right there!

117
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,540
Hey! Come back here!

118
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,400
Come back here!

119
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,560
Grab them—!

120
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:43,200
Catch them!

121
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,890
Get over here!

122
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:02,370
Damn, that smells! What the?

123
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:05,680
- Get out of there. 
 - What the heck?

124
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,360
Wow, you ran into a manure pile, sheesh.

125
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,470
- What did they put in that manure? 
 - Consider yourselves lucky, you little pricks.

126
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:13,720
- Let's go, guys. 
 - Yes, sir.

127
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,480
- P-Poo—? 
 - Damn it, you should control your temper!

128
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,650
How was I supposed to know?!

129
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:24,460
Ugh, I carried you on my back.

130
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:26,190
My leg hurts, man.

131
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:28,170
Ugh, the smell...

132
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,780
Get off of me, man.

133
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:44,730
Ju Gyeong needs to see you like this.

134
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,010
You think she'll be disappointed?

135
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:49,230
Even so, do you think she'll go to you?

136
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:52,290
Why did the conversation become this? Are you conscious of me?

137
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:55,290
Would I not be? Did you sort out your feelings or no?

138
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:57,290
Is that easy to do?

139
00:12:57,290 --> 00:13:00,240
Are you saying you're going to confess to her or something?

140
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,740
Are you crazy? When she's dating you?

141
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,490
Sort it out.

142
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:07,240
- Again, do you think it's easy to? 
 - So what are you saying you'll do?

143
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:10,420
- I don't know. Move a bit over. Go away. 
 - Don't touch me.

144
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:15,080
I didn't touch you. The shit on your face is no joke and the stink now ...

145
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,240
You're the same you know.

146
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:18,990

149
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:28,260
 My friend Su Ah: Are you finally enrolling? 

150
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:30,690
 Yeah, yeah. My part-time pay came in today. 

151
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:34,110
 Is our Im Ju going to become the second Selena? 

152
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:09,190
Hello. I would like to enroll here. 
  ELLE 

153
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:11,940
Okay, please fill out the application.

154
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:17,700
 Im Ju Gyeong 

155
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,850
Don't spill while you eat.

156
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:37,770
- Should I put rice in? 
 - Yeah.

157
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:50,460
I ate well. Lee Su Ho, go get some water.

158
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:00,580
Hey, it's mine.

159
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,630
Are you being obvious about dating?

160
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:05,450
Gosh.

161
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:09,120
Did you guys make up?

162
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,570
I told you, it's not your business.

163
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:14,800
How could I not? Didn't you guys fight because rumors about me and Im Ju Gyeong dating spread?

164
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,200
You petty jerk.

165
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:21,830
But don't you think there's a reason why she can't tell the others that you guys are dating?

166
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:24,080
What reason?

167
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:28,040
Seemed like she couldn't say it because of Kang Su Jin.

168
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,560
Kang Su Jin?

169
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:35,170
How are you planning to date if you are this clueless?

170
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:38,900
 These days, you've been on my mind. 

171
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:41,430
 Girlfriend 

172
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:59,050
Yeah, I...

173
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:02,160
Don't laugh. Did you come back well?

174
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,660
Almost. At the very end, it became a spectacle.

175
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:08,210
Hm? Why? Did something happen?

176
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:10,650
 I rolled in the poop field. 

177
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:13,760
Lee Su Ho, you even know how to joke. How's your leg?

178
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,020
Was it not hard on you to go about with crutches?

179
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,500
They say you shouldn't overexert yourself.

180
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:22,190
I searched that bananas, spinach, safflower seeds, broccoli, and oranges are good for your bones.

181
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:24,060
 Remember it well and make sure to eat them. 

182
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:26,700
 Bananas, spinach, safflower seeds... 

183
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:32,930
- Why are you laughing? 
 - I like you nagging. Keep doing it.

184
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:34,920
What?

185
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:38,060
Oh, right. I have something to give you.

186
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:41,270
- What is it? 
 - Wait.

187
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:44,940
Where did it go? Ta-da!

188
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:48,430
 You don't have anything to give? Huh? Huh? 

189
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:49,880
Me?

190
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:56,230
Ta-da!

191
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:59,830
There's one here too.

192
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:04,290
 - Im Ju Bal! 
 - I told you to knock! 

193
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:07,070
- Receive this. 
 - What is it?

194
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:12,010
- Boong! 
 - Oh, the smell.

195
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:16,500
You, seriously... Do you want to die?!

196
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,370
What do I do?

197
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:24,920
Goodnight. I'll call you again tomorrow.

198
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:31,890
Oh, what was that?

199
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,420
Hey, Han Seo Jun. Are you not going to open the door?

200
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:56,220
Hey, hey! Han Seo Jun!

201
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:10,060
  To boyfriend: I'm finally seeing you. See you at school. 

202
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,730
You should come home early at night!

203
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:13,840
Just like her father, she wanders in and out.

204
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:17,030
I'll be going!

205
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:23,880
 Boyfriend: I'm here.  
 - Already?

206
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:35,370
You must have come out early.

207
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:37,360
You must have been tired, so you should have just gone straight to school.

208
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,200
We can't let it show at school.

209
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,170
Let's walk like this until we get to the bus stop.

210
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:46,120
But is it okay? You said we should tell the others.

211
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:49,890
I went a bit crazy because I was jealous.

212
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:54,170
Jealous? Why are you being jealous?

213
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:57,890
Once you feel comfortable, let's tell then.

214
00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:00,330
Oh, right. If Kang Su Jin...

215
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:02,220
Huh? What?

216
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,550
No, it's nothing.

217
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:08,790
Excuse me.

218
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:11,540
Since your zipper was open.

219
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:13,720
Oh, thanks.

220
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,910
You're the transferred student in the classroom next to mine, right? I saw you at the staff room.

221
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:18,920
Oh, yeah.

222
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:25,060
Ju Hye Min? Your name is pretty.

223
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:26,620
Yeah...

224
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:35,660
Ju Gyeong. Im Ju Gyeong!

225
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:05,380
Im Ju Gyeong?

226
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:12,770
Su Jin, let's go.

227
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:27,170
 Why is Hye Min here? 

228
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:29,190
 She's wearing our school uniform, though. 

229
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:31,360
 Did she transfer here? Why all of a sudden? 

230
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:33,370
What's wrong? Are you not feeling well?

231
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:37,690
Huh? No, it's nothing.

232
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:43,070
Lee Su Ho! Your father retire—

233
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:46,240
My friend came. Congrats on your complete recovery. Clap.

234
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,070
Clap.

235
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:50,040
What congrats.

236
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:57,530
Hey, Lee Su Ho. Oh, did you take off your cast?

237
00:20:57,530 --> 00:21:00,170
- And what if he did take it off? 
 - I took it off.

238
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:03,240
- To fight? 
 - That's good.

239
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,520
Are you already sleeping this morning?

240
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:11,170
- Yup. 
 - What's this, this emotionless atmosphere? It's nice, though.

241
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:13,640
 As expected, it's friendly between friends. 

242
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:17,360
Oh, Im Ju, Im Ju! You came? Hurry and look at this.

243
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:19,810
Instagram is voting for a goddess and I uploaded your picture.

244
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:22,110
But, wow, you're in second place right now!

245
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:24,660
The vote difference isn't that big, so if we do well, you can become first place.

246
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,410
Oh, is that so?

247
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,480
What's good about being first place? Do they give cash or something?

248
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,170
No, it's just that if you place first, you feel good.

249
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,910
You know the leader of the girl group that debuted in the spring?

250
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:37,850
She was the winner from last year's contest and got really famous to the point where she got signed by a label.

251
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:40,290
Right. So what's good about being very famous?

252
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:44,390
It's that if you become really famous, you feel good.

253
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:46,720
I don't feel good.

254
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,120
This is like a competition between the schools.

255
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,550
Everyone is freaking out, trying to get a girl from their school into first place.

256
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:54,770
I was eliminated so fast, unfortunately.

257
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:58,270
But you should win first place and protect Saebom High's pride.

258
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:01,640
Annoyingly, first place is from Yongpa High. Look.

259
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,620
  Instagram Goddess Competition: Introducing the Goddess from my school! 

260
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:07,600
 Park Sae Mi? 

261
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:19,050
Wow! Goddess!

262
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:22,310
- She's right next to me. 
 - Isn't it obvious?

263
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:26,710
Hey, you threatened others to vote for you. What kind of...

264
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:35,490
Hey! Why did you upload my picture? Take it off right now.

265
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:39,590
- People are already voting, so I can't take it down midway. 
 - What?

266
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:43,500
Guys, go on Instagram and vote for Im Ju Gyeong!

267
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:48,790
Vote for Ju Gyeong!

268
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:53,940
Only vote for Ju Gyeong, okay?

269
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:10,870
  Im Ju Gyeong, Class 5 

270
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:13,030
 A+ 

271
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:22,000
Oh, why? Why? Do you have something to say?

272
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,990
No, just 'cause.

273
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:28,260
Oh my. But Ju Gyeong got an A plus.

274
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:33,250
She sure got a good grade. A plus.

275
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:36,740
Is there a reason that Ju Gyeong should not receive an A plus?

276
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,670
It was very refreshing that she chose horror literature as her topic.

277
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:42,830
And her critical analysis about traditional literature versus genre literature was written logistically in an orderly fashion.

278
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:45,730
I gave her this grade because it fit all of the correct criteria to deserve such a grade!

279
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:48,210
Not because I gave it to her specially.

280
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,230
Now that you explained it in such a desperate way,

281
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:53,530
it seems like a totally lame, cheap excuse.

282
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:55,330
You're becoming very suspicious.

283
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:58,730
Lame and cheap? I-I'm lame and cheap?

284
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:02,330
Me? When?!

285
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:05,850
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

286
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:20,000
Lee Su Ho.

287
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,290
- Is your leg totally healed now? 
 - Yeah.

288
00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:27,770
That's a relief. I was worried.

289
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:30,920
What are you doing after classes end? Let's talk later.

290
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:33,320
What talk? You can say it now.

291
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:36,600
Oh... it's a bit awkward to do it here. Later, outside—

292
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,560
I have a commitment today.

293
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:42,520
Is it an important commitment? Can't you cancel it?

294
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:44,850
It's something I can only talk to you about.

295
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:47,830
 Seemed like she couldn't say it because of Kang Su Jin. 

296
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:51,790
I have a commitment with my girlfriend.

297
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,920
Oh, I didn't tell you before, right?

298
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:58,100
It's Ju Gyeong. My girlfriend.

299
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:04,930
For whatever reason, she didn't tell others yet. Pretend you don't know.

300
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:08,090
Then why did you tell me?

301
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:11,070
Because I felt like I needed to.

302
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:13,030
Because you're a friend.

303
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,540
Hey, people will see!

304
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:45,900
It'll be okay if I do this.

305
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:49,460
What? I guess Lee Su Ho isn't fully healed yet.

306
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:51,750
Get well soon, Su Ho.

307
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,860
- Why's he so tall? 
 - The height difference is...

308
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:56,220
Did you see that?

309
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:59,160
Is something the matter? Your expression doesn't look good.

310
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,830
It's okay.

311
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:06,120
Kang Su saved spots for us.

312
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,750
Oh! Over there.

313
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:09,790
Enjoy your food!

314
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:11,760
- Darling! 
 - You're here?

315
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,470
- Thanks. 
 - I'm so hungry.

316
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:21,850
Kang Su, who's that?

317
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:23,930
Ah, she's Hye Min.

318
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:26,310
We were in the same class, so we came here together afterward.

319
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:28,010
I see. Hi!

320
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:30,150
- Hi! 
 - H-Hi.

321
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:33,740
You look like a new face. Did you transfer schools? Where did you come from?

322
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:36,410
She's from Yongpa High School.

323
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:38,310
Oh, really?

324
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:40,190
What? Yongpa High School again?

325
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:45,210
Im Ju, those guys who snatched you away were from Yongpa High School too.  So annoying.

326
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:48,120
Ju Gyeong, you transferred here too.

327
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:51,090
Where did you say you transferred from?

328
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:53,180
Ah, have you even told us before?

329
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:56,430
Oh, that's right. Now that I think about it, I don't think you've told us.

330
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:58,690
Im Ju, where did you come from?

331
00:26:58,690 --> 00:27:04,390
Uh... I transferred from pretty far away.

332
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:10,090
Hey... don't you recognize me?

333
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:17,570
There was a girl named Im Ju Gyeong at my old school, too.

334
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:20,310
I just thought that you look similar.

335
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:27,000
Really? Im Ju, did you transfer from Yongpa High School?

336
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,370
Nope. I don't know you.

337
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:36,410
I don't know how similar we look, but I didn't transfer from Yongpa High School. Don't be mistaken.

338
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:41,190
Oh, r-really? S-Sorry.

339
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:44,970
Hey, why do you have to take things that far?

340
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:48,310
I don't feel too good, I'm going to get going.

341
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:51,930
- Ju! 
 - Ju Gyeong.

342
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:55,710
Is she in a lot of pain?

343
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:07,050
Do you not know, or are you pretending not to know?

344
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:16,720
Do people change that much with makeup? Beyond recognition?

345
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,570
Huh?

346
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:28,490
She didn't recognize me, right?

347
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:31,670
At least we're not in the same class.

348
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:35,930
Yeah. As long as I don't run into her, I won't get caught.

349
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,780
Why are you doing that?

350
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:49,350
Oh, it's nothing!

351
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:57,680
Here, a gift for you.

352
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:02,630
Only kind people are able to see it.

353
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:06,650
There's a watch in there, can't you see it? It's extremely expensive!

354
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:09,930
Hand me that.

355
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:14,140
If you ever feel short of breath again, put your mouth here like this.

356
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:18,560
Breathe in, breathe out. Breathe in, breathe out. You'll calm down right away.

357
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:21,290
Make sure you keep this with you, okay?

358
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:27,190
- You have something else? 
 - These are worry dolls.

359
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:29,680
When you can't fall asleep at night, talk to these guys.

360
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:32,560
Your sad thoughts, your worries, everything.

361
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,500
And if you put them under your pillow before bed,

362
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:37,370
the dolls will take away your anxieties while you're sleeping.

363
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:38,660
Isn't this all just superstition?

364
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:42,120
Come on, I heard that they do this as psychological treatment at the hospital.

365
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,600
I looked into everything, you know.

366
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:54,130
I heard that yarn crafts are good for helping you relax, too.

367
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:56,670
- Yarn crafts? 
 - Yup.

368
00:29:57,590 --> 00:30:00,820
And finally, ta da!

369
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:03,390
I bought these with my paychecks from working part-time.

370
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:06,640
It's a couple item. Open it up.

371
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:13,400
Aren't they cute?

372
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:17,190
If we have these at school, won't our classmates notice?

373
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:21,740
I know. So I bought these for when we can comfortably reveal it to people.

374
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:24,430
- Let's wear these when that time comes. 
 - So you just want me to hold onto it?

375
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:27,640
It still feels nice to know that you have it.

376
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:41,990
By the way, have you talked with your dad since that day?

377
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:46,300
No.

378
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:49,260
I know it'll be hard to do right away,

379
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:53,200
but I just think it would be nice if you talked with him.

380
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:57,800
Because I don't want you to have any regrets.

381
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:02,230
Okay.

382
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:07,040
But don't you need these worry dolls more than I do?

383
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:09,880
You're such a worrywart.

384
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,920
No, these are for you.

385
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:17,900
- These are super cute. 
 - Aren't they cute?

386
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:19,380
They all have a different expression.

389
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:26,710
What? This girl is in first place?

  Instagram Goddess Competition: Introducing the Goddess from my school! 

391
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:32,390
Im Ju Gyeong should be first place.

392
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:35,000
  Instagram Goddess Competition: Introducing the Goddess from my school! 

393
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,750
Ah, where is it?

394
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:41,890
What are you looking for?

395
00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:45,280
My hoodie. Did mom put it in here?

396
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:48,250
Why, why, why?

397
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:51,220
Are you okay?

398
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:53,460
It smells. You kept this?!

399
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:56,020
 Power of tiger, gush out! Roar! 

400
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:59,060
 Han Seo Jun. Roar! 

401
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:01,910
Hey, this guy was on my right arm for a long time. How could I dump it?

402
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:04,550
Still, you're going to bury it in there like a hidden treasure?

403
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:07,330
Because it's a memory! When I see it later, I'll be like,

404
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:11,070
"Ah, that's right. That was a rough time."

405
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:13,420
And I'll relive those memories! How could I dump it?

406
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:16,370
You're nuts, you're crazy.

407
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:18,960
Ouch, my toe.

408
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,890
Are you okay?

409
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:31,440
She's right, just throw it out.

410
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:40,350
But still, it's my right arm.

411
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:42,700
How can I just dump it?

412
00:32:53,790 --> 00:32:57,650
What? How did I click on this?

413
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:19,150

428
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:48,100
Here comes Im Ju Gyeong, the goddess who grabbed first place in the Instagram Goddess Competition!

429
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:54,230
- What? 
 - Ju Gyeong, you beat the girl from Yongpa High School! You're first place!

430
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:58,600
How? Why am I first place?

431
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:03,800
Ms. Goddess, how do you feel after flipping the social networks upside down?

432
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:07,140
How do you feel?

433
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:18,600
It's an honor for me to be considered a candidate for first place.

434
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,350
- What the hell? 
 - What's this?

435
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:23,290
- OMG! You're second place! 
 - What?!

436
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:25,680
What the— What kind of bitch took first place?!

437
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,850
Ouchie.

438
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:33,000
Ju Gyeong, won't you debut as a celebrity at this rate? 
 [I'm Team Leader Choi Hyeon of JJ Entertainment. / From Park Seong Nyeong: We're making a new girl group. 

439
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,100
Not just any random person can be a celebrity!

440
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:39,200
Choi Su Ah, seriously, you put me through this!

441
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:43,100
Ju Gyeong, you have to enjoy this moment!

442
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:44,740
OMG, I want to be her manager.

443
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:47,250
I'll be the stylist!

444
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:49,910
It's perfect!

445
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:52,390
Dude.

446
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,800
What are you doing in someone else's classroom? Aren't you leaving?

447
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:59,690
I asked Su Ho, but he absolutely refused.

448
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:01,680
He's such a difficult kid. What do we do?

449
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,250
If everyone refuses to do it, then who will?

450
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:05,750
That's what I'm saying.

451
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:07,540
- Why is everyone gathered here? 
 - What's this?

452
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:10,240
This year's Instagram Goddess is a girl from our school! Im Ju Gyeong from class 5!

453
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,940
Daebak. Won't she become a celebrity after being chosen as the goddess?

454
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:16,590
What? In-star-gram? There's a star at our school?

455
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:19,090
- Goodness. 
 - Who's that?

456
00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:21,560
There, sir.

457
00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:47,630
Until when will you live like this?

458
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:02,600
Here.

459
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:09,360
How could you trip on your own feet?

460
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:12,690
Why? Were you worried that I fell?

461
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:14,460
Was your heart hurting?

462
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:17,850
Did your heart sink and all that?

463
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:25,310
Do you like me that much?

464
00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:28,990
Yeah.

465
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:32,460
Ju Yeong, since you're smart,

466
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:35,180
I trust that you'll understand what I'm going to say.

467
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:40,020
You're finally recognizing my charm.

468
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:42,230
Do you like or dislike poop flies?

469
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:44,470
Poop flies? Dislike, of course.

470
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:48,590
If you're sleeping and there's a poop fly in front of your nose, what do you think you'd do?

471
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:52,010
I'd feel bothered and annoyed.

472
00:37:52,010 --> 00:37:53,990
Correct.

473
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:56,670
So stop it now.

474
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:59,700
Since you're Ju Gyeong's brother, if you don't bother me,

475
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:02,150
I can at least be friends with you.

476
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,620
Poop fly?

477
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:13,600
- Are you going directly to your academy? 
 - Yeah.

478
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:19,160
- Hi. I'm Yongpa High's Park Sae Mi. You know me, right? 
 - Hi.

479
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:25,570
 Oh? Hey! 

480
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:29,350
 Wow. 

481
00:38:30,370 --> 00:38:32,270
I'm not sure.

482
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:37,450
You took first place in the Instagram Goddess contest...  Even overtaking me.

483
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:41,430
But... the picture is a bit better.

484
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:45,420
But even so, you look completely different from the Im Ju Gyeong that I know.

485
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:48,970
Oh, okay.

486
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:53,040
What are you so busy for?

487
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:56,070
It makes it seem like you're avoiding me.

488
00:38:57,590 --> 00:39:00,800
Why isn't Han Seo Jun coming out?

489
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:04,780
I don't know either. Let's go, Su Jin.

490
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,450
She's seriously ignoring me.

491
00:39:07,450 --> 00:39:09,350
Oh! It's that bitch, Ju Hye Min.

492
00:39:09,350 --> 00:39:11,580
Oh! Hye Min!

493
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:14,040
Where are you going?

494
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:18,900
Hye Min!  What's up?

495
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,420
Smile. Smile!

496
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,900
Let's go.

497
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:34,930
Hey. Who told you to ignore our calls? You want to die?

498
00:39:34,930 --> 00:39:38,140
I-I said it was nothing.

499
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:42,550
I've been watching her, and she really has nothing to do with Han Seo Jun.

500
00:39:43,810 --> 00:39:48,350
Even if they're like this, it's nothing still? You seriously...

501
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:53,520
Hey, just keep following Im Ju Gyeong and find out any dirt about her.

502
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,840
For example, if she has any guys that she is flirting with,

503
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:59,310
if there's anything foul that we can reveal about her personality.

504
00:39:59,310 --> 00:40:03,350
That way those two will split. Is that not so?

505
00:40:03,350 --> 00:40:05,700
Are you not going to answer?

506
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:07,720
Ju Hye Min!

507
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:13,120
Were you guys hitting her?

508
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:18,330
What are you saying? We were just talking. Why?

509
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:26,040
You... You said you would do an assignment with us today.

510
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:28,730
Did you forget?

511
00:40:28,730 --> 00:40:30,680
Huh?

512
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:32,430
Y-y-yeah.

513
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:36,500
She said she's going somewhere with us today.

514
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:43,590
The assignment is more important. Let's hurry and go.

515
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:46,510
Where are you going?

516
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:54,430
Hey. Who are you to interfere?

517
00:40:54,430 --> 00:40:58,010
You guys are from Yongpa High, right?

518
00:41:08,450 --> 00:41:10,500
Thank you.

519
00:41:11,290 --> 00:41:12,890
I'll be going.

520
00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:14,520
Excuse me...

521
00:41:15,290 --> 00:41:18,790
You're Ju Gyeong, right?

522
00:41:21,890 --> 00:41:24,910
Thanks for helping me.

523
00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:28,560
But... you became really pretty.

524
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:31,630
- I couldn't recognize you at first— 
 - Just because I helped you

525
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:35,230
doesn't mean I forgive you.

526
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:42,050
I'm sorry about back then.

527
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:47,400
I was worried that I'd get picked on like you did if I didn't listen to them.

528
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,870
I did it because I was scared.

529
00:41:52,350 --> 00:41:57,080
I still shouldn't have done that to you. I'm sorry.

530
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,920
To my friends here...

531
00:42:02,610 --> 00:42:05,360
I don't want them to find out about my past self.

532
00:42:07,210 --> 00:42:09,630
So don't make it seem like you know me at school.

533
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:14,450
I swear I won't tell them! I won't tell anybody.

534
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:28,110
Turning it.

535
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:34,460
What are you doing? Knitting?

536
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:36,660
It's said that it's good for stabilizing the heart.

537
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:39,040
Yeah, do something at least.

538
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,690
But why'd you call me out?

539
00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:42,760
I have something to ask you.

540
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:47,800
It's about Kang Su Jin being the reason that Ju Gyeong couldn't say we were dating.

541
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:50,450
What do you mean by that? Do you know something?

542
00:42:50,450 --> 00:42:51,850
What about it?

543
00:42:51,850 --> 00:42:54,640
These days, Ju Gyeong has been weird.

544
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,470
I feel like there's something going on but...

545
00:42:56,470 --> 00:43:00,350
Why are you asking me about your worries for your girlfriend?

546
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:03,350
How is she weird?

547
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:10,430
Last time, she asked about a friend of her friend.

548
00:43:10,430 --> 00:43:13,020
That the friend of her friend got a boyfriend,

549
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:17,570
but that the friend liked her boyfriend and then the friend of the friend...

550
00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:20,270
that friend suddenly said she liked her boyfriend,

551
00:43:20,270 --> 00:43:21,770
and so the friend of the friend...

552
00:43:21,770 --> 00:43:25,470
That friend of the friend... of the friend...

553
00:43:25,470 --> 00:43:27,670
If you don't understand, leave it.

554
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:31,960
 Then what about you? Isn't Su Jin a longtime friend? 

555
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:34,170
 Then can you not do all the things I don't like? 

556
00:43:34,170 --> 00:43:36,510
 Can you throw away your friends? 

557
00:43:36,510 --> 00:43:37,870
When did she say that?

558
00:43:37,870 --> 00:43:40,850
When we made the dumplings and cut our toenails—

559
00:43:40,850 --> 00:43:44,970
Don't ask me. I don't want to remember.

560
00:43:47,350 --> 00:43:50,530
Hey, you dropped a stitch there.

561
00:43:50,530 --> 00:43:51,740
How do you know?

562
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:54,790
I crocheted a few things back when Go Woon used to do it a lot.

563
00:43:54,790 --> 00:43:56,790
If you keep knitting without going back again, then you're screwed.

564
00:43:56,790 --> 00:43:58,370
Is that so?

565
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:04,780
What do I do?

566
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,070
Let me see.

567
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:12,730
You can't do this one thing correctly.

568
00:44:12,730 --> 00:44:15,530
No, no, it's not like this.

569
00:44:17,210 --> 00:44:20,170
Lee Su Ho! You said we were friends.

570
00:44:20,170 --> 00:44:23,440
You wouldn't go even when I hung onto you and begged you to go to the PC room with me once.

571
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:25,370
Just because you guys made up and what's this now?

572
00:44:25,370 --> 00:44:28,870
How could love— No... friendship change?

573
00:44:28,870 --> 00:44:31,080
What's with him?

574
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,050
- Have you ever knitted before? 
 - Yeah.

575
00:44:34,050 --> 00:44:35,980
I've knitted a scarf for Su Ah before.

576
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:37,930
Were you knitting?

577
00:44:38,930 --> 00:44:40,710
- After I put this in. 
 - After putting it in...

578
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:41,760
Turn it.

579
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:45,010
Hey, Han Seo Jun! Are you going to be like that?

580
00:44:45,010 --> 00:44:48,550
You straight up ignored me when I told you we should go to the coin noraebang... and you're here doing this?

581
00:44:48,550 --> 00:44:52,910
What to do? How could our friendship change?

582
00:44:52,910 --> 00:44:54,490
Come here.

583
00:44:55,010 --> 00:44:57,240
I'm hungry.

584
00:44:58,290 --> 00:44:59,690
You waited long, didn't you?

585
00:44:59,690 --> 00:45:01,280
Did you listen well to your academy lecture?

586
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:04,300
Yeah. Why'd you come all the way here for?

587
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:06,650
So we could go together.

588
00:45:10,050 --> 00:45:12,470
- Im Ju Gyeong. 
 - Hm?

589
00:45:12,470 --> 00:45:16,670
Right now, are you feeling good or bad?

590
00:45:16,670 --> 00:45:17,970
Why all of a sudden?

591
00:45:17,970 --> 00:45:22,810
Just 'cause. Are you feeling good or bad?

592
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:26,810
Good.

593
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:33,950
Are you not going to tell me what's going on?

594
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:40,690
To be honest, a girl from my old school transferred here.

595
00:45:40,690 --> 00:45:41,790
What?

596
00:45:41,790 --> 00:45:43,910
 Was it not because of Kang Su Jin? 

597
00:45:43,910 --> 00:45:48,120
I thought she wouldn't recognize me, but she did right away.

598
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,950
Are you okay?

599
00:45:49,950 --> 00:45:54,650
I'm a bit anxious, but she thankfully said she wouldn't tell anybody.

600
00:45:54,650 --> 00:45:56,610
You must have been surprised.

601
00:45:57,660 --> 00:45:59,290
A bit.

602
00:46:00,770 --> 00:46:03,780
But now I'm really okay.

603
00:46:12,510 --> 00:46:16,320
Are you not hungry? Shall we go somewhere to eat delicious food?

604
00:46:17,490 --> 00:46:19,490
What should we eat?

605
00:46:19,490 --> 00:46:21,570
Whatever you like.

606
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:31,700
Became prettier, my butt.

607
00:46:33,690 --> 00:46:37,180
I got another pimple.

608
00:46:45,690 --> 00:46:48,580
So annoying, seriously.

609
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:50,720
Hui Gyeong, do you want to go on a blind date?

610
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:54,900
- Well, I mean, the pig's trotter store's son— 
 - I have a lover.

611
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:57,100
- Lover? 
 - Lover?

612
00:46:57,100 --> 00:46:59,860
You're not just lying to get out of the blind date?

613
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:02,130
It's true.

614
00:47:02,790 --> 00:47:04,630
How long have you been dating for? What does he do?

615
00:47:04,630 --> 00:47:06,630
Is he handsome? What about his age?

616
00:47:06,630 --> 00:47:09,550
It's a secret. I'll introduce you to him when it's time.

617
00:47:09,550 --> 00:47:10,950
Do you have a picture of him?

618
00:47:10,950 --> 00:47:12,890
I can tell what kind of person he is once I see his physiognomy.

619
00:47:12,890 --> 00:47:18,670
I'm so curious! What kind of person is he?

620
00:47:19,890 --> 00:47:22,640
- My grapefruit. 
 - Grapefruit?

621
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:26,340
The more you see him, the cuter he gets.

622
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:30,050
His face is the juicy type.

623
00:47:30,050 --> 00:47:31,110
Juicy type?

624
00:47:31,110 --> 00:47:32,720
I'm home.

625
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:35,590
Oh, you're home. Come and eat.

626
00:47:35,590 --> 00:47:39,230
How could a mere poop fly eat?

627
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:48,190
 Second year, Im Ju Gyeong. Please come to the auditorium right now. 

628
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:55,550
Our Ju Gyeong! You're doing well, doing well! So pretty!

629
00:47:55,550 --> 00:47:59,270
Wow! It's the descent of a goddess!

630
00:47:59,270 --> 00:48:02,270
Wow, you sure did demolish the stage!

631
00:48:02,270 --> 00:48:05,370
Milky skin, milky skin!

632
00:48:05,370 --> 00:48:09,060
 How did I end up here, seriously...? 

633
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:12,370
She's such a school model!

634
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:16,830
Dean, do I really have to do this?

635
00:48:16,830 --> 00:48:20,850
Usually, the school model is either the school president or the school's first rank, is it not?

636
00:48:20,850 --> 00:48:25,420
- Yeah, but Ju Gyeong, they said no. 
 - What?

637
00:48:26,060 --> 00:48:27,800
But why must it be me?

638
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:32,130
What must? I heard you're our school's Instagrammer.

639
00:48:32,130 --> 00:48:35,540
Since you're the star of the stars, the star should be doing it.

640
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:39,260
Saebom High's Billboard Star!

641
00:48:41,910 --> 00:48:44,120
Please strike a pose.

642
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:46,320
You're pretty!

643
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:50,660
Pretty!

644
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:53,670
Do it properly. The stance should be this.

645
00:48:53,670 --> 00:48:57,420
So if we go on our school's homepage, your face will appear like a banner?

646
00:48:57,420 --> 00:49:01,340
Oh~ Saebom High's face representative Im Ju Gyeong!

647
00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:06,070
Please don't be like that. What face representative?

648
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:10,340
Three, four, five...

649
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:13,400
Have those two made up after being hospitalized together?

650
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:15,390
Is it like mutual sympathy or something?

651
00:49:15,390 --> 00:49:18,170
- Seven. 
 - I think something's wrong? Hold on correctly.

652
00:49:18,170 --> 00:49:21,320
Hurry and do it. Again.

653
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:24,760
- One. 
 - Why is it one?

654
00:49:25,550 --> 00:49:29,000
 Park Sae Mi 

655
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,990
Who is it?

656
00:49:30,990 --> 00:49:33,170
It's nothing.

657
00:49:33,170 --> 00:49:37,550
Do it seriously. Are you even counting it correctly?

658
00:49:42,690 --> 00:49:45,270
What the heck? Why are you taking my pictures?

659
00:49:45,270 --> 00:49:47,320
Because you're cool.

660
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:50,200
Don't you like Lee Su Ho?

661
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:52,400
Yes. So?

662
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:55,080
- Don't you know he's dating Im Ju Gyeong?
 - I know.

663
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:57,160
You know yet you still like Ju Gyeong, too.

664
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:58,770
Don't you?

665
00:50:10,430 --> 00:50:12,600
 Can you give me some pics of Im Ju Gyeong? 

666
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:15,450
 Then send me some pics of Seo Jun. Give and take. Just one, please? Please? 

667
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:19,040
 To: Park Se Mi 

668
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:30,760
 It's got boyfriend vibes. Thank you! 

669
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:34,120
 But why do you want her pictures? 

670
00:50:48,930 --> 00:50:51,030
 Is this all you got? 

671
00:50:51,610 --> 00:50:53,000
Running made me hungry.

672
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,480
Let's go to the school store.

673
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:56,950
- Okay. What should we eat?
 - Ouch!

674
00:50:56,950 --> 00:50:59,030
Im Ju.

675
00:51:00,210 --> 00:51:02,200
Sorry.

676
00:51:35,310 --> 00:51:37,480
Im Ju, what's wrong? Are you looking for something?

677
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:40,830
What do I do? I think I lost my necklace.

678
00:51:40,830 --> 00:51:42,490
Where could it be? I never took it off.

679
00:51:42,490 --> 00:51:44,540
- The one that you always wear?
 - Yes.

680
00:51:44,540 --> 00:51:46,670
When did you see it last?

681
00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:48,720
I think I had it till the morning.

682
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:51,080
Did it come loose during gym earlier?

683
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:53,860
- You think? 
 - I'll help you look for it. Let's go out.

684
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:55,790
Thanks.

685
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:11,710
Where is it?

686
00:52:16,970 --> 00:52:19,300
I told her to not look for it.

687
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:21,990
She'll be looking all night.

688
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:29,490
Would it be there?

689
00:52:30,450 --> 00:52:32,060
Someone probably already took it.

690
00:52:32,060 --> 00:52:33,960
They said nothing came in at the lost and found.

691
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:36,720
And I trust our students' consciences.

692
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,450
Wow, you're really proud of our school.

693
00:52:38,450 --> 00:52:41,610
- Is it because you're the model now? 
 - No.

694
00:52:41,610 --> 00:52:43,870
Go over there. You might step on it.

695
00:52:43,870 --> 00:52:45,630
Should I look for it, too?

696
00:52:45,630 --> 00:52:47,830
What will you do if I find it?

697
00:52:48,750 --> 00:52:50,870
I'll buy you spicy tteokbokki.

698
00:52:50,870 --> 00:52:52,910
Buy me something else!

699
00:52:52,910 --> 00:52:54,540
Why? You like it.

700
00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:57,070
- You said you couldn't have enough.
 - Whatever.

701
00:52:57,070 --> 00:52:59,590
If I find it, you have to get me something nice.

702
00:52:59,590 --> 00:53:01,190
Deal.

703
00:53:04,130 --> 00:53:06,800
Oh! I found it!

704
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:08,740
Really?

705
00:53:09,590 --> 00:53:11,400
500 won. Awesome.

706
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:14,320
What the heck!

707
00:53:19,590 --> 00:53:23,420
Wow, I really found it. Is this the necklace?

708
00:53:23,420 --> 00:53:25,480
You found it?

709
00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:30,560
Why don't you just go home?

710
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:33,070
Fine fine. I'll open my eyes wide and find it.

711
00:53:33,070 --> 00:53:35,780
Stop playing around.

712
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:39,380
It's a gift from Lee Su Ho. I have to find it.

713
00:53:41,170 --> 00:53:43,920
- I'm going.
 - What? You said you'll look for it with me.

714
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:45,480
I'm a busy man.

715
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:48,810
Do you have to look for it in this weather?

716
00:53:48,810 --> 00:53:51,220
Is Lee Su Ho acting petty because you lost it?

717
00:53:51,220 --> 00:53:53,410
No.

718
00:53:53,410 --> 00:53:55,550
It's precious

719
00:53:55,550 --> 00:53:57,980
so I want to find it.

720
00:53:57,980 --> 00:54:00,590
If it's so important, you should've taken a better care for it.

721
00:54:00,590 --> 00:54:03,600
Exactly. I must be crazy.

722
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:07,160
I'm not going home until I find the necklace.

723
00:54:10,110 --> 00:54:12,090
Look hard.

724
00:54:12,090 --> 00:54:13,820
I'm off.

725
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:19,880
What the?

726
00:54:21,750 --> 00:54:23,640
Whatever.

727
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:38,550
How do I find it?

728
00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:44,840
Are you looking for this?

729
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:50,110
Kang Su Jin.

730
00:54:56,030 --> 00:54:57,810
What the heck?

731
00:54:59,050 --> 00:55:01,250
You know whose this is.

732
00:55:01,250 --> 00:55:03,060
Yes, I know.

733
00:55:03,060 --> 00:55:05,780
Then what are you doing?

734
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:07,990
Because I like you.

735
00:55:09,190 --> 00:55:12,130
You're not even surprised. Did you already know?

736
00:55:12,130 --> 00:55:14,980
Do you think this makes sense?

737
00:55:14,980 --> 00:55:16,950
Aren't you and Ju Gyeong friends?

738
00:55:16,950 --> 00:55:20,450
- As long as you don't like her, we're friends.
 - What?

739
00:55:20,450 --> 00:55:24,350
Ju Gyeong is bright, nice, and warm, so I like her.

740
00:55:24,350 --> 00:55:28,270
But not as much as you.

741
00:55:28,270 --> 00:55:32,130
Rather than losing you, I'll abandon her.

742
00:55:32,130 --> 00:55:36,120
So if you don't want to see her hurt after losing a friend, break up with her.

743
00:55:36,810 --> 00:55:38,620
You...

744
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:41,160
Are you the Kang Su Jin that I know?

745
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:43,520
Why Ju Gyeong out of all people?

746
00:55:47,430 --> 00:55:49,100
You haven't even known her for that long.

747
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:52,710
Why is it not me who's been by you for 10 years but her?

748
00:55:53,550 --> 00:55:57,140
Can't you just break up with her and like me from now on?

749
00:55:57,140 --> 00:55:58,980
You can do that.

750
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:01,020
If I had told you that I liked you first,

751
00:56:01,020 --> 00:56:03,980
then you would've chosen me anyway.

752
00:56:06,540 --> 00:56:08,280
No.

753
00:56:09,430 --> 00:56:11,650
I wouldn't have done that.

754
00:56:41,930 --> 00:56:44,120
 Don't look for the necklace. 

755
00:56:57,130 --> 00:56:59,640
Should I have just one more?

756
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:02,300
- It's late. 
 - Right, it is late.

757
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:04,400
No, no.

758
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:07,890
I have to go on a diet and get my visuals back. No, no.

759
00:57:07,890 --> 00:57:09,950
I don't think she'll find it.

760
00:57:09,950 --> 00:57:12,450
What? Hey.

761
00:57:12,450 --> 00:57:15,870
If I lose just a little bit of weight, my visuals are pretty okay.

762
00:57:18,540 --> 00:57:20,390
I'm off.

763
00:57:20,390 --> 00:57:23,000
Where are you going in the middle of eating?

764
00:57:24,660 --> 00:57:26,090
Such a waste.

765
00:57:26,090 --> 00:57:28,730
I'm gaining weight because of you.

766
00:57:43,290 --> 00:57:46,830
Did someone really take it?

767
00:57:54,150 --> 00:57:56,960
- Im Ju Gyeong.
 - Oh my God!

768
00:58:00,870 --> 00:58:02,320
I knew you'd be like this.

769
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:04,770
I can't give up without even trying.

770
00:58:04,770 --> 00:58:09,920
- You know what time it is?
 - I was going to go home after looking here one last time.

771
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:14,400
- Then we're going home after looking around here.
 - Okay.

772
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:18,360
You look over there. I'll look here.

773
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:21,850
I just looked over there. It wasn't there. Let's look here together.

774
00:58:21,850 --> 00:58:25,040
Still... why don't you look again?

775
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:27,520
I even checked every speck of dust.

776
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:30,080
- It'll never be there.
 - Never say never.

777
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:31,900
Are you 100% sure?

778
00:58:31,900 --> 00:58:34,220
100%?

779
00:58:34,220 --> 00:58:36,940
Maybe not...

780
00:58:36,940 --> 00:58:40,270
Then you should look once more.

781
00:58:43,070 --> 00:58:45,930
I looked here earlier.

782
00:58:59,910 --> 00:59:01,830
I found it!

783
00:59:03,170 --> 00:59:05,440
That's such a relief.

784
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:12,090
It's a relief.

785
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:14,010
Why did I come here?

786
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:19,350
See? Good thing I looked for it. Don't you think?

787
00:59:19,350 --> 00:59:22,280
You're right. Good job.

788
00:59:24,010 --> 00:59:26,010
Let me put it on.

789
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:31,500
♫  I hope I can reach  ♫

790
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:40,320
♫  Going deeper, I am  ♫

791
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:48,060
♫  As I'm with you, I am  ♫

792
00:59:50,210 --> 00:59:53,820
♫  I'm missing you  ♫

793
00:59:53,820 --> 00:59:57,430
♫  Waiting for you  ♫

794
00:59:57,430 --> 01:00:00,210
♫  My heart is set for you  ♫

795
01:00:00,210 --> 01:00:02,360
Who is there?!

796
01:00:04,430 --> 01:00:06,060
Let's go.

797
01:00:19,090 --> 01:00:21,350
Who's there?

798
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:42,610
Did I see wrong?

799
01:00:45,570 --> 01:00:47,570
Unni!

800
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:52,070
Hui Gyeong, are you okay?

801
01:00:52,620 --> 01:00:54,330
Mr. Han?

802
01:00:55,900 --> 01:00:57,850
Hello.

803
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:01,320
Hi.

804
01:01:09,140 --> 01:01:11,200
So bored.

805
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:13,620
Should we go to a noraebang (karaoke)?

806
01:01:14,410 --> 01:01:16,570
- What do you think of this?
 - Not pretty.

807
01:01:16,570 --> 01:01:18,580
It's not?

808
01:01:18,580 --> 01:01:21,390
- Something's weird.
 - What is?

809
01:01:21,390 --> 01:01:26,050
Why did Im Ju Gyeong's friend ask for Im Ju Gyeong's pictures?

810
01:01:26,050 --> 01:01:29,190
Huh? What are you saying? Why doesn't she take them herself?

811
01:01:29,190 --> 01:01:32,580
Because they are two different peopl—

812
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:35,350
What do you mean?

813
01:01:39,260 --> 01:01:42,080
Jeez, I was a total idiot!

814
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:45,460
 Kang Su Jin 

815
01:01:45,460 --> 01:01:47,430
Wow, seriously. This is big.

816
01:01:47,430 --> 01:01:49,770
Hey, Kang Su Jin!

817
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:52,970
You came quickly.

818
01:01:52,970 --> 01:01:55,040
Were you the one who told us to come out?

819
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:56,540
We came to meet her?

820
01:01:56,540 --> 01:01:59,610
I also had something to ask you.

821
01:02:00,610 --> 01:02:03,630
Answer correctly.

822
01:02:03,630 --> 01:02:06,370
Is she that b*tch?

823
01:02:11,670 --> 01:02:14,340
I heard you guys didn't eat yet.

824
01:02:14,340 --> 01:02:16,790
For now, let's eat well—

825
01:02:16,790 --> 01:02:19,410
You. What were you doing in school in the middle of the night?

826
01:02:19,410 --> 01:02:21,410
What were you doing at night?

827
01:02:21,410 --> 01:02:24,110
I asked you first! Put in the dumplings.

828
01:02:24,110 --> 01:02:25,660
I lost my necklace so I was looking for it.

829
01:02:25,660 --> 01:02:28,290
Necklace? Which one?

830
01:02:29,590 --> 01:02:32,350
- It's pretty. Did you receive it as a gift? 
- Yeah.

831
01:02:32,350 --> 01:02:35,280
Why are you hiding under the desk with my teacher?

832
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:37,560
- Mr. Han, dangmyeon (glass noodle) is for later, later. 
 - Okay, okay.

833
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:39,590
We are dating.

834
01:02:41,230 --> 01:02:43,500
That juicy boyfriend...

835
01:02:44,690 --> 01:02:46,740
That was our teacher? Are you crazy?

836
01:02:46,740 --> 01:02:47,950
I'm crazy in love!

837
01:02:47,950 --> 01:02:50,750
Why can't a man and woman, both with healthy minds and bodies, love?

838
01:02:50,750 --> 01:02:52,910
Oh, it's boiling, boiling.

839
01:02:52,910 --> 01:02:56,410
So you came to your younger sister's high school to fool around, because you're crazy in love?

840
01:02:56,410 --> 01:02:59,990
She's not crazy. I was working overtime, and our Hui—

841
01:02:59,990 --> 01:03:02,980
No, Hui Gyeong packed me some food.

842
01:03:02,980 --> 01:03:07,190
He didn't want to get caught by you so my Grapefruit—

843
01:03:07,190 --> 01:03:08,160
- Grapefruit? 
 - Grapefruit?

844
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:09,920
Our Jun Woo was so worried so we were hiding.

845
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:11,540
Why out of all people does it have to be my teacher?

846
01:03:11,540 --> 01:03:13,690
How can I go to school when it's so uncomfortable?

847
01:03:13,690 --> 01:03:17,310
Why did you have to date the son of my company's CEO, seriously?

848
01:03:17,310 --> 01:03:19,230
Wait, is it okay because he's the ex-CEO?

849
01:03:19,230 --> 01:03:21,590
- Anyway! 
- Was there really no other man?

850
01:03:21,590 --> 01:03:24,880
Our Grapefruit is special!

851
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:27,120
I told you to put in the glass noodles later!

852
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:29,150
You have to put it in after it boils longer!

853
01:03:29,150 --> 01:03:30,780
- Are we eating fried rice? 
 - Of course.

854
01:03:30,780 --> 01:03:32,020
- With a side of cheese?
- Two extra servings.

855
01:03:32,020 --> 01:03:33,400
Can we have two extra servings of fried rice?

856
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:35,800
- Auntie, can we get some soda? 
- Okay!

857
01:03:37,350 --> 01:03:39,130
Is she still not answering?

858
01:03:39,130 --> 01:03:41,120
I'm getting annoyed.

859
01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:43,820
Where did she say Im Ju Gyeong's house is?

860
01:03:50,650 --> 01:03:53,630
How did those two meet?

861
01:03:53,630 --> 01:03:57,020
How am I going to look at Teacher's face tomorrow at school?

862
01:03:57,020 --> 01:03:58,990
Is it that uncomfortable?

863
01:03:58,990 --> 01:04:03,010
Of course! I have to be more careful in school.

864
01:04:03,010 --> 01:04:06,040
It's going to go directly to Unni.

865
01:04:08,140 --> 01:04:11,520
Do you think our teacher looks like grapefruit?

866
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:15,950
She must be blinded by love.

867
01:04:15,950 --> 01:04:18,360
  Prince Comics  

868
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:23,490
- Good night! 
- Good night!

869
01:04:25,710 --> 01:04:27,760
- Is it here? 
- Is it here?

870
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:28,930
It's here.

871
01:04:28,930 --> 01:04:31,290
It's here!

872
01:04:31,290 --> 01:04:33,450
 To My Sister: Are you done with your part-time job? 

873
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:54,500
- That smell... 
 - Where is it?

874
01:04:54,500 --> 01:04:55,850
I think it's there!

875
01:04:55,850 --> 01:04:57,670
She really lives in a filthy place.

876
01:04:57,670 --> 01:05:00,390
Park Se Mi!

877
01:05:00,390 --> 01:05:02,730
Han Seo Jun?

878
01:05:02,730 --> 01:05:04,800
Why are you here?

879
01:05:18,380 --> 01:05:20,630
We've arrived.

880
01:05:20,630 --> 01:05:22,540
We've arrived.

881
01:05:26,730 --> 01:05:29,260
- Han Seo Jun! 
 - Why are you looking for Im Ju Gyeog?

882
01:05:29,260 --> 01:05:31,750
I haven't seen her in a while so I wanted to talk!

883
01:05:31,750 --> 01:05:32,620
Been a while?

884
01:05:32,620 --> 01:05:36,920
It turns out that I actually know her.

885
01:05:40,920 --> 01:05:43,080
- What is this? 
- Can't you tell?

886
01:05:43,080 --> 01:05:46,470
It's Im Ju Gyeong.

887
01:05:49,160 --> 01:05:51,720
He doesn't know, he doesn't know!

888
01:05:51,720 --> 01:05:53,890
Why? Are you shocked?

889
01:05:53,890 --> 01:05:57,090
I was completely deceived as well!

890
01:05:57,090 --> 01:05:58,690
Why are you showing me this?

891
01:05:58,690 --> 01:06:00,940
I was worried for you.

892
01:06:00,940 --> 01:06:04,500
If you knew your girlfriend used to be like this in the past, would you have still wanted to date her?

893
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:07,830
She used to be a dumpling shuttle back in my school.

894
01:06:07,830 --> 01:06:09,520
A total loser.

895
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:13,000
She isn't on the level for kids like you to date.

896
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:16,110
In my eyes, I think she is prettier than girls like you.

897
01:06:16,110 --> 01:06:19,910
What? Are you defending her because she's your girlfriend?

898
01:06:19,910 --> 01:06:21,530
Or are you blinded by love or something?

899
01:06:21,530 --> 01:06:22,960
She only looks like that because of makeup!

900
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:24,230
- Are you okay? 
 - Hey.

901
01:06:24,230 --> 01:06:27,320
Her bare face is a mess, and you—

902
01:06:28,550 --> 01:06:30,650
Han Seo Jun!

903
01:06:30,650 --> 01:06:36,560
I really can't hold it back when I see kids bullying others in school, because it reminds me of my friend.

904
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:38,410
What, shuttle?

905
01:06:38,410 --> 01:06:42,040
If I catch you doing things like this to other people once more,

906
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:44,100
I'm not going to let it go.

907
01:06:56,460 --> 01:06:59,110
You should go quickly now.

908
01:06:59,110 --> 01:07:01,860
I will go when you go inside.

909
01:07:01,860 --> 01:07:05,000
Okay, I will really go in.

910
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:06,870
See you tomorrow!

911

  Bright face! Bright smile! A school where everyone's happy! 

927

What is all this? So embarrassing.

01:09:26,820 --> 01:09:30,200
  Welcome to  Saebom High School's Admission Information Session 

929
01:09:31,220 --> 01:09:35,360
  Mom, look at this. I became the school's model. 

930
01:09:37,140 --> 01:09:39,370
Saebom High School's goddess?

931
01:09:39,370 --> 01:09:43,330
No! Face representing our school?

932
01:09:43,330 --> 01:09:44,970
Let's go.

933
01:09:51,830 --> 01:09:55,400
  Saebom High School's Bright Future! Lively tomorrow! 

934
01:10:00,620 --> 01:10:03,100
Hey, look at this.

935
01:10:03,100 --> 01:10:05,230
I can't believe it!

936
01:10:05,230 --> 01:10:08,640
Daebak. Look at this!

937
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:29,060
Goddess, my ass.

938
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:34,550
Goddess?

939
01:10:34,550 --> 01:10:36,590
How is she a goddess?

940
01:10:40,090 --> 01:10:43,830
  Welcome to  Saebom High School's Admission Information Session 

941
01:10:54,090 --> 01:10:57,790
Ju Gyeong, is this really you?

942
01:10:59,300 --> 01:11:01,920
 Exposing the real identity of Saebom High School's goddess, Im Ju Gyeong. 

943
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:04,420
 Before she transferred schools, she was famous for being a dumpling shuttle. 

944
01:11:04,420 --> 01:11:06,190
 If you guys all see this, you will be shocked. 

945
01:11:06,190 --> 01:11:09,370
  She's super ugly. Only looks like that because of makeup. 

946
01:11:15,160 --> 01:11:17,730
This is really interesting.

947
01:11:17,730 --> 01:11:20,150
Wow, this is no joke.

948
01:11:21,700 --> 01:11:25,470
 Because. You. Are. Ugly. 

949
01:11:32,060 --> 01:11:35,230
Wow this is... Wow.

950
01:11:35,230 --> 01:11:37,400
Wow!

951
01:12:00,590 --> 01:12:04,150
Look at this!

952
01:12:12,760 --> 01:12:14,530

♫  I can reach   ♫

959
01:12:56,440 --> 01:13:02,210
♫  Going deeper, I am  ♫

960
01:13:02,210 --> 01:13:08,160
♫  As I'm with you, I am  ♫

961
01:13:08,160 --> 01:13:12,060


962
01:13:12,060 --> 01:13:16,930
♫  I'm missing you  ♫

963
01:13:16,930 --> 01:13:20,230
♫  Waiting for you   ♫

964
01:13:20,230 --> 01:13:23,470
 The kids know my real face now, 

965
01:13:23,470 --> 01:13:26,360
 so I can't look at you. 

966
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:28,100
   What are you doing instead of just taking it off? 

967
01:13:28,100 --> 01:13:30,270
  Is there anyone else beside you who would do something like that? 

968
01:13:30,270 --> 01:13:31,380
  Why won't there be? 

969
01:13:31,380 --> 01:13:32,900
  Did you really not know? 

970
01:13:32,900 --> 01:13:34,920
  You are Ju Gyeong's best friend! 

971
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:38,320
 Whatever state you are in, whether you are wearing makeup or not, 

972
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:41,130
 you will always be Im Ju Gyeong.  

973
01:13:41,130 --> 01:13:44,640
  Run away as far as you can, and hide. 

974
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:49,470
  Don't worry. I will transfer you to a school where no one knows who you are. 

975
01:13:49,470 --> 01:13:54,660
♫  Only thinking about you all day long, I am  ♫
