 True Beauty

00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:51,660
 After Jeong Se Yeon's name was changed and his past white-washed, confirmed as violent assailant 

5
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:58,460
 "XXX, give me the money." Many victims of Se Yeon's school violence come forward. 

6
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,200
 Lee Su Ho 

7
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,320
Do you have nothing to say to the victims' families?

8
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,970
Is it true that you hid your past when you signed with Move?

9
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:17,600
Please say something to your disappointed fans!

10
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,310
Please explain the rumor about your having served time at the juvenile detention center!

11
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:21,950
Please make a comment!

12
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:24,640
Where are you going?

13
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:27,210
To Su Ho.

14
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,020
What?

15
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:30,720
Su Ho would believe me.

16
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,070
If only Su Ho believes in me, then the CEO will listen to what I have to say.

17
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:37,970
- Then let's go together. 
 - Please say something to your victim!

18
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:41,910
- Mr. Jeong Se Yeon! 
 - Please say something to your fans!

19
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:54,660
Se Yeon.

20
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,860

23
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:42,190
  I'm sorry! 

24
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:48,420
Hey, Lee Su Ho.

25
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:54,100
After killing a friend, you must be happy.

26
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:24,010
Excuse me, is it because of the helmet?

27
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:25,700
No.

28
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,840
I want to eat with you.

29
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,710
Han Seo Jun!

30
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:50,430
This bastard, really.

31
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:22,900
Hit me.

32
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:25,550
I said to hit me.

33
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:27,020
Hey!

34
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:30,590
What are you guys doing over there?

35
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:34,780
Are you not going to separate?!

36
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:51,330
Han Seo Jun, what kind of kid are you, huh?

37
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:54,070
You were running around trying to become an idol, then threw that away.

38
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:56,300
Are you trying to become a gangster now?

39
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:59,630
How dare you, a student, throw fists at a sacred school?

40
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:02,930
Right, Teacher? I was so surprised, too.

41
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:05,060
They were fist fighting right in front of me and I really

42
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:07,050
thought a grain of rice would pop out from my nose.

43
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:09,730
- Go back in, you punk! 
 - Yes, sir.

44
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:11,470
Goodbye.

45
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:15,710
What if the school violence committee holds a meeting? Do you want to be expelled?

46
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:17,930
I started the fight first.

47
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:23,780
Su Ho, what are you protecting this kid for?

48
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:28,530
Good going for someone who took a leave of absence from school because of his sick mother.

49
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:32,900
How could she not get sick when her son goes around

50
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:35,770
- acting like this? 
 - Sir.

51
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:37,560
Stop it, please.

52
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:42,630
Hey, since Su Ho wants to be so generous and forgiving,

53
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:44,040
let's just settle things out.

54
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,600
We don't need to make a commotion to hold a disciplinary committee against school violence.

55
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,500
Don't you think so?

56
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:53,470
Stop it!

57
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:56,010
Our Su Ho, you have a math competition tomorrow.

58
00:05:56,010 --> 00:06:00,480
You must control your condition well. Go on back to your class.

59
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,710
Stop it!

60
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,920
What's this? Are you not going to open your eyes correctly?

61
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,880
- You, really! 
 - Stop it, Teacher.

62
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,870
Are you not going to say you did wrong?!

63
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:29,100
Hey, are you okay? You are hurt.

64
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:33,760
You should've got beaten up and broke an arm or something.

65
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:37,070
That way, I would've been able to get first place at this competition. Don't you think?

66
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:39,170
If you're going to spout nonsense, go away.

67
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:42,660
Or since you grabbed him, you should have thrown him on the ground.

68
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:45,720
You should've stomped on him hard so he wouldn't have been able to ever start a fight with you again.

69
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,030
What did you learn Jujitsu for?

70
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:51,880
In elementary school and even now, you're still so soft inside.

71
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,680
What happened between you and Han Seo Jun?

72
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,680
Is it perhaps... because of Jeong Se Yeon?

73
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:03,410
Hey. Put this on.

74
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,890
- I heard the top two fought because of her. 
 - A love triangle?

75
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:13,930
Daebak.

76
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:17,940
  What kind of situation is this? 

77
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:21,400
Ju Gyeong, I heard you got confessions from both Lee Su Ho and Han Seo Jun.

78
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,110
Who are you going to choose between the two?

79
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,930
Who?

80
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:30,620
What choosing?

81
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:38,030
Will it be God Su Ho or God Seo Jun?

82
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:41,020
- Who will you choose? 
 - Who?

83
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:43,240
Hey, just go to the M Countdown site and choose Eighteen. 
  (TN: M Countdown is a Korean music ranking show)  

84
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,270
- That's right! 
 - No, we want to know!

85
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:48,530
It's not like that. There's no way the top two would both like me.

86
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:50,750
Their relationship isn't good, so that's probably why they fought.

87
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:54,030
No, it's not that.

88
00:07:55,900 --> 00:08:02,400
But then why did Mr. H sit beside Miss I?

89
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,010
We would like to know—  (TN: impersonating the host of the TV show 'Unanswered Questions') 

90
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:09,380
Hey, hey!

91
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:11,190
If Ju Gyeong says it isn't like that, then it isn't.

92
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:13,160
Go back to your respective classrooms. Go back!

93
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,940
Why?

94
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,910
You guys, go!

95
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,750
You're having a hard time because you're pretty.

96
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:25,650
Think about if an average girl sat in that position.

97
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:28,160
Do you think these rumors would have come about?

98
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,010
It's tiring.

99
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:33,990
What's going on, seriously?

100
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:37,800
  In this aspect, were my prior days of having zero presence easy? 

101
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,960
It's Su Ho!

102
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:43,400
- Lee Su Ho... 
 - What's going on?

103
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:52,160
Hey, Lee Su Ho.

104
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:56,490
Come see me for a bit.

105
00:08:57,850 --> 00:08:59,650
Hey, Lee Su Ho.

106
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:02,580
Who are you to pick a fight with Han Seo Jun?

107
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:05,480
- This audiovisual  ...
 - Audacious.  (TN: Kim Cho Rong is incorrectly using a word for the similarly sounding correct word) 

108
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:08,110
Audacious.

109
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:12,450
Well, anyway, what are you going to do if Seo Jun gets disciplinary punishment because of you?

110
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:16,020
- Since you grabbed him first, it's preemptive defense. 
 - Self-defense.

111
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:18,280
Self-defense.

112
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,300
Are you imitating a gangster?

113
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,620
Where do you think you're running away—

114
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:28,030
You're crossing the line.

115
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:33,310
Hey, look at him crossing the line.

116
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:36,450
Take him!

117
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:39,030
Do you work out?

118
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:42,770
Guys, come in already!

119
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:47,220
Geez, really?

120
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,340
Stop it.

121
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,810
Are you guys... snaring a pig?

122
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:01,300
Hey, you jerks!

123
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,900
Are you guys starting it again?!

124
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:05,500
- No, no. 
 - Be quiet!

125
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,590
That Kim Cho Rong... Going overboard, seriously...

126
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,420
You punks keep trying to cause trouble whenever you get a chance!

127
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:17,370
- We were just working out... 
 - Exercise?! Is that a body that works out?

128
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:29,350
Hey, Lee Su Ho. If you were to have been hit by me, you would have died, so I let it slide.

129
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:33,360
I don't think he'll even hear.

130
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,830
I'll tell him instead.

131
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:38,120
- Hey, Lee Su Ho! 
 - M-Man Sik, Man Sik!

132
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:41,970
I... I got a spasm.

133
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:43,990
- Spasm! Hurry!
 - I have a spasm.

134
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:48,010
- Let's go to the school nurse's office! 
 - Call 119!  (equivalent to 911 in the U.S) 

135
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,420
Hello?

136
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:53,210
Han Seo Jun.

137
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:58,140
What do you want from me?

138
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:00,100
What I want?

139
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:03,080
Don't appear in front of me.

140
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,470
If you don't want to see me, then avoid me.

141
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:08,540
Because there's no reason for me to run away from you.

142
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:10,650
Shameless jerk.

143
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:15,690
Right. That's your natural self, right?

144
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,990
That day.

145
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:24,490
When Se Yeon came to find me...

146
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:28,030
Why?

147
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:36,060
Are you going to make an excuse now?

148
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:39,420
That pitiful jerk, that day!

149
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:42,810
Do you know what his finals words to me were?

150
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:47,310
That you would believe in him.

151
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,260
Without knowing you were the world's coldest and most selfish bastard!

152
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:57,120
He ran trusting you that day.

153
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:05,120
So don't ever say his name with your mouth ever again.

154
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,500
 Bring Se Yeon back to life. 

155
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:49,760
 Bring Se Yeon back to life! 

156
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,220
 Bring him back. 

157
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:54,420
 Bring Se Yeon back, you bastard! 

158
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:21,990
 Prince Comics 

159
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:34,250
 Im Ju Gyeong's spot. 
 Sitting without permission will cause hair to grow on your butt! 

160
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:51,150
 Are you crying? 
   

161
00:13:56,610 --> 00:14:01,120
 No way.  Is the comic too scary for you? 

162
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,500
 It's okay. Don't cry. 

163
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,260
 This is not scary at all. 

164
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:11,660
 Squirrel, squirrel, I'm a squirrel. 

165
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:18,380
 You won't laugh? Kitty cat, kitty cat, meow a kitty cat. 

166
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:21,090
 Finally a smile! 

167
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:24,750
 Squirrel, squirrel, I'm a squirrel. 

168
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:30,090
 You know what? If you smile while you cry, you'll grow hair on your butt. 

169
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:35,120
 I'm a squirrel, squirrel, a squirrel. 

170
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:38,160
Lee Su Ho.

171
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:43,430
I saw you while passing by.

172
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:47,520
Here, drink it.

173
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:50,980
I saw Han Seo Jun earlier, leaving first.

174
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:53,730
Did you clean the auditorium all by yourself?

175
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:59,490
And you let him just leave like that? Fighting like little kids...

176
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:06,390
Never mind. I have no right to talk when I myself fought with my brother not too long ago.

177
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:09,090
I'm the one who fights every day.

178
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:18,520
When I fight with my brother, there is something that my mom always makes us do.

179
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:21,830
"I love you."

180
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:26,020
We say this and like this...

181
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:31,360
- We cut each other's toenails. 
 - Toenails?

182
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:37,790
When you cut each other's toenails, it tickles and naturally we make up with each other.

183
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:44,480
Did you just smile?

184
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,360
Wow, I don't think I've ever seen you smile.

185
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,360
No, I didn't smile.

186
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,680
I don't know what happened,

187
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:58,130
but if you ever want to talk to someone because you're frustrated, let me know.

188
00:15:58,130 --> 00:16:00,850
I'll lend you my ears.

189
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,830
What can't I do for our God Su Ho?

190
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:08,130
What? Guardian angel? 
  (TN: Suhosin means "guardian angel") 

191
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:11,410
Kids says that your nickname is Saebom High's God Su Ho.

192
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:14,990
- You didn't know? 
 - Guardian angel, my butt.

193
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:20,920
- Don't call me that. 
 - Why not? You're my guardian angel.

194
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:24,950
You're my guardian angel guarding my bare face.

195
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:39,230
Does it bother you that much?

196
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:41,090
What?

197
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:43,020
Your bare face.

198
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:47,070
I thought all girls look different without makeup.

199
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:49,560
You can't say that elsewhere.

200
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:54,080
I'm a serious case. I'm two extremes.

201
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:57,960
I can't really tell.

202
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:03,140
Are your eyes okay? How can you not see?

203
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:09,010
You know how much effort I put into makeup? I transform from THIS face.

204
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:14,760
Did you hurt your lip?

205
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:17,990
That looks painful.

206
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:31,250
You guys shouldn't be looking at adult comics.

207
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:38,750
You should hurry home now. It's getting late. Hurry. Hurry!

208
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:41,620
- It's not even 8 yet.
- That's why you should go home and study.

209
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:43,960
A student shouldn't be at a comic store in the early evening.

210
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:47,230
- You're not very good at school, right? What's your rank?
 - That's not true.

211
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:50,510
Who comes after King Sejong the Great? You have three seconds.  One, two, three!

212
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:53,890
- G-g-gojong? 
 - What did you do with 400 years? You're really bad.

213
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:58,610
Go home. Hurry. Go home and study!

214
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:07,580
What did I just blabber?

215
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:22,180
Goodness. That's so dangerous!

216
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:30,330
- Hey, Im Ju Gyeong. 
 - Me? What?

217
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:34,110
- Are you dating Lee Su Ho? 
 - N-no.

218
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:39,500
- Really? 
 - Not in a —. We're not.

219
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:43,200
I can see you aren't.

220
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,260
You can see? What did you see?

221
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,480
Look at her.

222
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,150
 Is that blood? Why does she have blood on her nose? 

223
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:58,220
What's this?

224
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:01,830
Hey hey hey, Lee Su Ho. Good to see you.

225
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:06,660
Say, Ho, Ho!  When I turn around, Ho!

226
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:10,020
- Ho! 
 - Hey, hey.

227
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:16,030
My Hoon has tried dozens of times, but he never goes for it even once!

228
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:29,120
The class looks exactly like my pimples.

229
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,370
You don't know when it'll pop.

230
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:48,430
What's taking him so long to buy me a meal?

231
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:50,760
Is he a shy guy?

232
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:56,440
I'll just give him one more day.

233
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:01,140
What's the limiting value of constant function 7 when x goes over 6?

234
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:03,220
Of course it's 7.

235
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:06,950
It's because the constant function's value remains at 7.

236
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:11,470
Who will come out and solve the next question?

237
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:16,380
I shouldn't have asked.

238
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:21,490
Our math geniuses Su and Su, come out and solve number 1 and 2.

239
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:24,210
And...

240
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:28,640
transfer student, Im Ju Gyeong. Come up and solve number 3.

241
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:04,160
Of course not.  They are not.

242
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:13,010
Lee Su Ho, please help me.

243
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:18,000
Maybe just a formula? Please? God Su Ho.

244
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:35,450
As expected! You won't have a problem winning this year's math olympiad.

245
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:37,480
The principal's really looking forward to it.

246
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:42,870
You have to be good. You should really be pressured.

247
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:47,600
You know it'll change the atmosphere of the teacher meetings. Understand?

248
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:56,380
This is the limiting value of my despair.

249
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:03,780
Ju Gyeong? What good is looking at it when you've got a different question?

250
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:06,380
You're right.

251
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:12,770
It looks like Seo Jun is confident.

252
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:16,610
Han Seo Jun, come out and solve this instead of Ju Gyeong.

253
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:20,020
That won't work. Come out.

254
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:23,440
Yes!

255
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,600
Hurry.

256
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,250
I probably won't be able to enter college if I give up math, right?

257
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:39,410
You'll have to be good at everything except math.

258
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:41,460
I won't be able to get into college for sure.

259
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:45,980
Do you want to come to my math academy? All the kids good at math like Su Jin and Lee Su Ho attend to study there.

260
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:49,040
- Should I?
 - Yes. 
 - My mom did tell me to look into math academies.

261
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:52,280
Come, come. We do a study group after and we'll let you in, too.

262
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,910
- Thank you. 
- Hey, Lee Su Ho.

263
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:58,360
Do you want to join our study group? We have one spot open.

264
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:02,340
- I don't want to.
 - You should join so my mom will stop nagging.

265
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:04,610
Just tell her I'm in.

266
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:08,400
You want me to lie? Why don't you just join?

267
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:11,950
Gosh, acting so difficult.

268
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:14,950
I didn't even expect him to. Let's just do it with the four of us, including Hoon.

269
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:18,520
Okay. Then we start as soon as Ju Gyong registers at the academy, okay?

270
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:21,530
Right, if you miss it to go on a date with Tae Hoon, you're out instantly.

271
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:24,220
Fine!

272
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:27,640
Oh right, Im Ju, I gave your number to that guy I'm setting you up on a blind date with.

273
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,220
- Already? 
- Yeah.

274
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:33,020
He should call you soon. Look, isn't he cute?

275
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:36,700
His character should be cute. Make up your mind after you meet him.

276
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:40,080
I'm not mentally ready yet.

277
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,680
Should I just meet him rather than suffer from rumors?

278
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:47,470
Good idea! He's already into you after just looking at your pics.

279
00:23:57,430 --> 00:24:00,930
Why... why are you...

280
00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:02,650
Comic book store.

281
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,070
You read more comics than I expected.

282
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:08,980
How can you manage being first place in the entire school even after that?

283
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:13,770
Good luck with your math contest tomorrow.

284
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:15,850
I don't like sweets.

285
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,340
Okay.

286
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:26,080
Oh, for that contest, all the best math whizzes around the country are showing up, right?

287
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,530
What kind of questions do you have to solve? Is it similar to mock exams?

288
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:31,390
Do they ask about sets like the sum of sets or intersection?

289
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:34,010
Sets are all you know in math, right?

290
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:38,370
Hey, sets... I learned that when I was in the tenth grade!

291
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:40,840
Equation formula of a circle, then.

292
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:42,640
I'm just a little lacking in math.

293
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,220
Who comes after King Sejong the Great?

294
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:47,940
Hey! If you ambush me with unrelated questions,

295
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:50,110
even for things I know, I can't remember because my brain gets fried.

296
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:51,840
You don't know, do you?

297
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:55,820
 Ji Woo Hyeon 

298
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:58,500
Oh, I got a text from the guy I'll have a blind-date with!

299
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:01,880
 Hello, this is Ji Woo Hyeon. When would you like to meet? 

300
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:04,820
What date when you don't even study?

301
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:06,860
This is a study of life.

302
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:08,110
 Hello, this is Im Ju Gyeong. 

303
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:09,250
And you never know.

304
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:12,440
If things go well, maybe a boyfriend who goes to Hankuk University will teach me.

305
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:15,000
I get a boyfriend, and my scores go up...

306
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,140
 Then should we meet up tomorrow? When is good? 

307
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:18,770
Tomorrow?

308
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:21,390
Do people meet up for blind dates at night usually?

309
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:23,870
In the daytime. When it's really bright out.

310
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:25,560
Oh, I see.

311
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:28,300
 Daytime works for me. 

312
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,040
- You're dying of happiness. 
- What do you mean?

313
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:36,050
This is all because you and Seo Jun fought in front of me.

314
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:37,860
Because strange rumors got started.

315
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:41,890
If you don't want to do it, just don't do it then.

316
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:46,950
It's not that I don't want to, but it makes me feel nervous.

317
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:52,560
To be honest... it's my first time meeting a boy outside alone.

318
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:55,440
But aren't you meeting me outside?

319
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:08,710
Hey! How can you grab my face like a pumpkin that's rolling away?

320
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:11,580
I'm a person with eyes, nose, and mouth, too!

321
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:16,610
Wow! I really wanted to see this movie! 
  Then let's catch the matinee of this movie!  

322
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:35,250
Hey, you said you were going to the comic book store!

323
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:37,310
What's the matter with him?

324
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:39,770
Good luck with your contest tomorrow!

325
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:55,150
Mom!

326
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:56,400
Oh, Seo Jun!

327
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,610
Did the meeting go well?

328
00:26:57,610 --> 00:27:00,790
Why did you come? You should have gone straight home after school.

329
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:03,650
But... you didn't ride the motorcycle here, right?

330
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:05,710
I told you I don't!

331
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:10,470
Ms. Mi Hyang, why are you starting to worrying so much?

332
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:11,470
What did the doctor say?

333
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:15,680
He said that, so far, there's no transplant rejection and the numbers are good.

334
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:18,440
He told me to keep taking medicine and take good care of myself.

335
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,110
That's a relief!

336
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:22,350
Should we go eat something delicious? And call Go Woon, too?

337
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:25,470
Next time. I have to stop by somewhere today.

338
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:26,710
Where?

339
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:29,450
It's already so messy! Why are you putting those things in here?

340
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:32,470
This is an aromatic candle I made at the Culture Center.

341
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:34,270
I wanted to ask you to give them out to your regulars.

342
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:36,710
If the response is good, I'm going to seriously sell them.

343
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:40,980
Please don't do anything seriously.

344
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:43,990
Oh my, I love aroma oil!

345
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:46,640
I only get massaged with aroma oils, too!

346
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,710
What kind of scent is it, Hui Gyeong's Dad?

347
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:51,340
This is a Ylang-ylang candle.

348
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:53,110
Ylang-ylang is good for high blood pressure

349
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:55,090
and female hormones.

350
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:56,860
- Particularly, Ylang-ylang is— 
 - Let's hurry, hurry out of here.

351
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:59,160
I will hurry, hurry out, okay.

352
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:03,960
Oh, he's so handsome. You must be full just looking at his face.

353
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,350
Why do you keep treating him so badly?

354
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:09,280
If not for that face, I would have thrown him away already.

355
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:14,290
You're back to Ju Gyeong again.

356
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:16,910
I couldn't tell when you had makeup on.

357
00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:19,260
Are you a magician?

358
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:22,940
It's Ju Gyeong's magic!

359
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:26,470
- I washed my face, Mom. Hurry up and give me a face pack! 
 - I told you no!

360
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:28,870
I'm busy, so why are you acting up, too? Go home and study instead!

361
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:30,240
It won't take long, though!

362
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,170
Unni!

363
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:37,030
Oh my! Mi Hyang, is that you?

364
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:42,550
 Why is he here? But I'm bare-faced! 

365
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:46,940
My son.

366
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:49,910
Oh, hello.

367
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:54,200
What in the world? I can't believe this.

368
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:57,590
What did you eat to become this handsome?

369
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:01,740
That's my second.

370
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:18,310
What's the matter with her? What are you doing?

371
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:20,580
Get up, Im Ju Gyeong!

372
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:22,440
Im Ju Gyeong?

373
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:31,650
You look much better than when you were on dialysis.

374
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:35,690
I met a great doctor, so the surgery went well. I was lucky.

375
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,780
That's great to hear.

376
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:41,640
- Have you been well? 
 - Of course, I've been well!

377
00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:45,850
This is daebak.

378
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:52,100
Mom, I'm going home.

379
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:55,910
Do you want to make the neighbors faint in the middle of the night? Go and wash it off!

380
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:05,740
 But now I have to put makeup on again in the middle of the night... 

381
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:59,340
You must be popular since you're pretty.

382
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:04,110
But if you're in the same class, you must be close to Seo Jun.

383
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:09,320
No. Not especially.

384
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:11,640
They can become close from now on!

385
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:16,470
Like they say these days, MFS and MFD.  (mom's best friend's son and daughter - mythical beings who are smart) 

386
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:19,440
Since we've met, come to our house tomorrow, Son.

387
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,040
I'll cook something delicious for you.

388
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,770
Well, I have to study tomorrow.

389
00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:26,980
I heard she's going on a blind-date.

390
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:29,650
What's a young girl going out on a blind-date for?

391
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:32,810
That's why you were making all that fuss for a face mask, huh?

392
00:31:32,810 --> 00:31:36,340
Why? When can she go on dates if not at her age?

393
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:39,550
It would be nice if Seo Jun had a girlfriend, too.

394
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:42,270
He's always riding his bike...

395
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,770
Although, he doesn't ride it these days.

396
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:46,280
He rides it every day!

397
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,390
- He rides it really fa— 
 - Hey!

398
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:52,200
... fast, so I nearly got run over.

399
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,740
How could you? You made a promise!

400
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:58,460
But how can I not when I have it? It's a waste of bus fare.

401
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:02,480
 Acting all strong... With his mom, he's got nothing. 

402
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,040
Han Seo Jun, this is not going to work!

403
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:07,310
Ju Gyeong, let me ask you for a favor.

404
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:10,180
Please don't let him ride his bike.

405
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:14,210
If you see him riding it, let me know right away.

406
00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:16,370
Mom, why would you ask her to do that?

407
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:19,090
Why? So you can break your promise again?

408
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:22,440
You can do that for me, right?

409
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:26,470
Of course. Just trust me.

410
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:32,080
 Pandora Shop 

411
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:35,480
I can't go around bare-faced here either.

412
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:38,530
I almost got caught.

413
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:40,310
Hey, you!

414
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:44,990
I won't leave you alone if you tell my mom useless stuff!

415
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:49,040
Wh- what? The bike?

416
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:54,080
- That's a promise I made with your mom, so I can't promise—
 - Also.

417
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:58,500
Also? What do you mean?

418
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:02,440
- Oh, you being beaten up by those punks before... 
 - What?

419
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,740
If it's not that...

420
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:09,810
then what else could you have done wrong?

421
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:14,270
There almost was a school violence committee because of Lee Su Ho!

422
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:22,030
I won't tell her. Of course I won't...

423
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:25,030
I'm very good at keeping secrets.

424
00:33:31,930 --> 00:33:34,900
He's a total troublemaker.

425
00:33:39,090 --> 00:33:41,920
It's still too hilarious to look at.

426
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:53,800
 When you go on a blind-date, 

427
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,930
 it's hard to look at the mirror often. 

428
00:33:56,930 --> 00:33:58,970
 "Oh, I have a blind-date today," 

429
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:02,040
 "so should I try a color I haven't before?" 

430
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,300
 "I should try something a little different." 

431
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:08,640
 I'm sure there are people who think that way. 

432
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:12,270
 Oh, you! Nope! That's not the right color! 

433
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:13,910
 Move your hand away! 

434
00:34:13,910 --> 00:34:17,040
 My Selebies, just because it's a very important day, 

435
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,570
I put on a new eye shadow color.

436
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:21,990
 If you wear makeup you're not used to, it can make you look more awkward. 

437
00:34:21,990 --> 00:34:24,560
 It can end up looking really bad, too. 

438
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:27,300
 Just wear makeup the way you've always done. 

439
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:30,280
 Instead, be more detailed. 

440
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:34,810
 The point is to make yourself look lovelier. 

441
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:54,910
I heard a lot about you, Oppa.

442
00:34:54,910 --> 00:34:58,770
Oppa? That's going overboard.

443
00:34:58,770 --> 00:35:00,730
Mr. Woo Hyeon?

444
00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:05,370
That's a little strange. What should I call him?

445
00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:53,280
Everything looks the same.

446
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:59,350
Isn't this what Mom ordered for her before?

447
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:03,280
What, you bastard?

448
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:13,960
The tag is still on.

449
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:22,370
 Math contest test times 

450
00:36:22,370 --> 00:36:25,200
Who is he? He's so handsome!

451
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,820
He's cute!

452
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:29,040
Hey, Lee Su Ho.

453
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:32,120
- Are you prepared? 
 - What is there to prepare?

454
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:36,240
You're gross.  I know you'll do well without any preparation.

455
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,990
Don't you get sick of saying that for every test?

456
00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:44,130
Hey, at my house, your scores matter the most after mine.

457
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:46,890
- This is me. Good luck. 
 - Okay. Good luck.

458
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:48,560
Oh, hey!

459
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:52,120
Don't do better than me. Just do enough.

460
00:37:13,210 --> 00:37:15,170
I'm by the window.

461
00:37:28,770 --> 00:37:30,110
Hello.

462
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:32,380
Nice to meet you. Have a seat.

463
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:34,010
Okay.

464
00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:38,290
You look so much better than the picture. I almost didn't recognize you.

465
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:41,740
- No way.
 - It's for real.

466
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:43,840
Can I speak informally?

467
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,650
Of course, please speak comfortably.

468
00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:50,060
- What do you want to drink? Their bubble teas are good. 
 - Sure. I like that.

469
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:54,460
Wow, are you already confessing your love?

470
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:58,640
I meant that I like bubble teas...

471
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,980
I'm joking.

472
00:38:18,610 --> 00:38:22,210
- Welcome.
 - A popcorn and two cokes.

473
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:25,800
Let me get this. You paid for the movies.

474
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:30,500
Since this is our first date, let me get this. Then I'll have an excuse to meet you again.

475
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:33,590
 "Again"? Does he mean we're going out again? 

476
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:35,900
Your popcorn's ready.

477
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:18,610
 That was quick. 

478
00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:21,260
  Are there no customers? 

479
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,370
 Huh? 

480
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:47,000
That bastard!

481
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:56,520
 What's going on? 

482
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:59,970
 Get out of the way! 

483
00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:01,880
What is it?

484
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:05,040
- Do you know him?
 - No.

485
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,380
How would I know such a person?

486
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:09,780
I'm sorry.

487
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:16,450
I shouldn't be here. Haru!

488
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:20,110
Eun Dan Oh. Eun Dan Oh! 
  (Characters from the 2019 drama "Extraordinary You") 

489
00:40:26,610 --> 00:40:30,630
Hey, what are you doing?

490
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:32,780
Get out!

491
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:42,610
I want to take you home but I have a class meeting that I need to go to.

492
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:46,000
- Sorry. 
 - That's okay. You should get going.

493
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:51,220
- Thanks. You'll meet me again next time, right?
 - Huh?

494
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:56,190
Yes.

495
00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:58,380
Am I being too obvious with my feelings?

496
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:00,900
I'll call you later.

497
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:02,810
Take care on your way back.

498
00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:06,310
Okay.

499
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:09,070
Good bye.

500
00:41:15,490 --> 00:41:18,440
 A Package Deal for Midnight Screening 

501
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:24,680
What am I doing?  How pathetic.

502
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:26,960
What's wrong with me?

503
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:30,890
Sweetie, where are you?

504
00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:33,100
I'm already here.

505
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:35,680
Tada! Darling.

506
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,890
- When did you get here?
- Did you wait long?

507
00:41:37,890 --> 00:41:41,010
I got here too early because I wanted to see you so badly.

508
00:41:41,010 --> 00:41:42,950
Let's go.

509
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:50,340
 How was it? How does he look in real life? What did you guys eat? How is he? Are you seeing him again? 

510
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:52,930
 So many questions. He did ask me out again. 

511
00:41:52,930 --> 00:41:56,350
  Aw, look at you two flirting! 

512
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:02,230
 From Ji Woo Hyeon: Did you get home okay? I miss you already. 

513
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:09,630
 He just texted me. What should I say? How do I reply? 

514
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:13,760
 Don't get too excited. For now, don't reply right away. Get back to him later. 

515
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:16,600
 How can I? I can't just leave him on read. 

516
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:19,970
  Don't even look at your phone. This is the start of playing hard to get. 

517
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:21,620
Playing hard to get?

518
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:25,300
- This doesn't hurt? It feels good?
 - Yeah.

519
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:29,270
- Does this feel good?
 - It feels good.

520
00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:31,510
So you won't call me, huh?

521
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:33,480
Should I just go see you at school?

522
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:35,870
I'm home.

523
00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:37,650
That looks good!

524
00:42:37,650 --> 00:42:40,880
Where has my daughter been all dressed up like that?

525
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,970
Hey, those clothes!

526
00:42:42,970 --> 00:42:46,280
- That is...
 - Looks new.

527
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:49,040
It's pretty.

528
00:42:49,050 --> 00:42:50,150
Right?

529
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:55,450
You were out on a blind date, right? That girl, already seeking out boys...

530
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:59,340
- A blind date? 
 - Mom, Su Ah said

531
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:01,780
you can postpone studies but not dating.

532
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:04,380
What a whole load of nonsense.

533
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:09,320
If you study and get into a college then I'll match you up with someone like Seo Jun.

534
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:11,350
- Seo Jun? 
 - He's a total delinquent.

535
00:43:11,350 --> 00:43:14,320
A delinquent? Hey, Ju Gyeong, a delinquent will never do.

536
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:17,630
What do you mean? He's such a nice kid.

537
00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:23,040
When Mi Hyang was suffering after a kidney transplant, he took care of her.

538
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,600
He got a part-time job to pay for tuition and living expenses.

539
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:28,480
- He even paid part of his mom's hospital bills.
 - Really?

540
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:31,630
It would be great if he didn't ride that motorcycle.

541
00:43:31,630 --> 00:43:35,210
Mi Hyang was really worried.

542
00:43:35,210 --> 00:43:39,410
Actually, her husband died in a traffic accident.

543
00:43:41,290 --> 00:43:43,180
Act like you don't know.

544
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:45,440
- Really? 
 - Yeah.

545
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:49,160
Then why won't he listen if he's such a good kid?

546
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:56,870
- Hello?
 -  Congratulations. You're eligible for a loan... 

547
00:43:56,870 --> 00:43:58,710
This is not the call I was expecting.

548
00:43:58,710 --> 00:44:02,190
You bitch, you want to offer your life as collateral?

549
00:44:02,190 --> 00:44:05,370
Seriously! I'm so mad.

550
00:44:05,370 --> 00:44:09,750
Hey, give me that.

551
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:20,120
I keep losing more.

552
00:44:21,390 --> 00:44:26,080
Mona Lisa, I know your pain.

553
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:32,100
Ouch.

554
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:37,860
 Let's date if there's electricity once more between us. 

555
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:40,080
 Let's date if there's electricity once more between us. 

556
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:50,180
 Im Hui Gyeong  
 Anyhow, she did tell me to buy her a meal.

557
00:45:10,150 --> 00:45:12,590
This feels good.

558
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:16,870
Hey, why are you so happy?

559
00:45:16,870 --> 00:45:18,720
Did you get a confession or what?

560
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:21,510
Actually...

561
00:45:22,650 --> 00:45:25,900
I went out on a date.

562
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:30,450
- And I think it's going well.
 - Wow, my Ju Bal is all grown up going out on a date.

563
00:45:30,450 --> 00:45:33,250
I've succeeded with my makeup.

564
00:45:33,250 --> 00:45:36,690
But, Unni, when you play hard to get, how much later do you respond to a text?

565
00:45:36,690 --> 00:45:41,470
Su Ah told me to reply after a while and it's been 30 minutes.

566
00:45:41,470 --> 00:45:44,380
I don't play hard to get. I plow straight ahead.

567
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:48,210
- Don't make him wait and reply.
 - Right?

568
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:55,020
 I take back the words that I miss you. To be honest, I have a girlfriend. 

569
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:58,240
 I'm trash that was trying to have an affair with you. I apologize. 

570
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:00,330
What does this mean?

571
00:46:00,330 --> 00:46:04,080
He rejected you. But what kind of rejection is this?

572
00:46:05,150 --> 00:46:07,340
I got rejected?

573
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:11,420
But if he didn't like you, then he should've said that you're not fated. Fate.

574
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:14,980
- He's total trash. 
 - Is that so?

575
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:17,880
So he rejected me...

576
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:19,950
Of course.

577
00:46:19,950 --> 00:46:22,790
How can I get a man with this face?

578
00:46:22,790 --> 00:46:27,380
It's rare to end up in a relationship from a blind date. Forget about it.

579
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:33,770
Look at this.

580
00:46:33,770 --> 00:46:39,320
Hello, you told me to buy a meal but that would take too much of your precious time,

581
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:42,950
which would be inconvenient for you, so I'll pay you instead.

582
00:46:42,950 --> 00:46:45,130
Please give me your account number.

583
00:46:45,130 --> 00:46:48,150
- What? What account number?
 - He's rejecting you.

584
00:46:49,190 --> 00:46:51,750
Reject? Ha!

585
00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:55,460
He rejects me? Wow.

586
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:58,500
I've never had a guy do this to me.

587
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:01,330
You still get rejected with that face?

588
00:47:02,690 --> 00:47:05,970
Then how much prettier do I have to get?

589
00:47:05,970 --> 00:47:09,820
Seriously! Why are you guys flipping out when I'm pooping.

590
00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:12,200
Get out!

591
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:20,150
It's so embarrassing to tell Su Ah that I got rejected.

592
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:25,680
Witnessing the event.

593
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:31,480
- What are you doing? 
 - Your mom told me to let her know when I see you riding a motorcycle.

594
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:35,400
- Gosh, I can't believe this. 
 - That's why you shouldn't ride it when she says not to.

595
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:37,520
Are you my mom's Mafia?

596
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:39,740
Mafia? You mean spy?

597
00:47:39,740 --> 00:47:43,600
It's the same thing. Aren't they both bad?

598
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:50,810
You're not the only one who has one. I got one, too.

599
00:47:52,830 --> 00:47:54,620
Delete it when I ask you nicely.

600
00:47:54,620 --> 00:47:57,590
Hey, Han Seo Jun! Han Seo Jun!

601
00:47:57,590 --> 00:48:01,310
- Delete it! Delete it! 
 - You first!

602
00:48:05,730 --> 00:48:08,670
I wasted my energy so early on.

603
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:14,860
Are you trying to stamp your face onto my clothes again?

604
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:18,060
Oh, sorry.

605
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:21,860
Don't look elsewhere.

606
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:23,930
What?

607
00:48:23,930 --> 00:48:26,870
I'm telling you to stay focused. Study more if you have time—

608
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:29,130
Again, again. I memorized all of it!

609
00:48:29,130 --> 00:48:31,530
♫ Tae, Jeong, Tae, Se, Mun, Dan, Se, Ye, Seong, Yeon, Jung, In, Myeong, Seon,

610
00:48:31,530 --> 00:48:34,830
♫ Gwang, In, Hyo, Hyeon, Suk, Gyeong, Yeong, Jeong, Sun, Heon, Cheol, Go, Sun.

611
00:48:34,860 --> 00:48:38,450
 (TN:  Joseon Dynasty kings starting with Tae Jo (first king in 1392)  to Sun Jong (1907-1910). Until 1835, each was "Jong" if his father was a king, otherwise "Jo" ) 

612
00:48:45,490 --> 00:48:48,320
- D-darling. 
 - Hm?

613
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:50,130
Are you not going to protect my face?

614
00:48:50,130 --> 00:48:54,650
Don't stick too close to me with selfies. It becomes obvious when I photoshop.

615
00:48:55,860 --> 00:48:58,680
It feels like I'm dating two girls.

616
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:02,190
Choi Su Ah in front of me and Choi Su Ah in Instagram.

617
00:49:03,090 --> 00:49:06,440
Then you should break up with Choi Su Ah in front of you and date on DM.

618
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:11,100
No! How could I break up with someone this cute?

619
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:14,100
Come on.

620
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:18,090
Ju Gyeong, who is flirting!

621
00:49:18,090 --> 00:49:20,750
What do you mean flirting? It's not.

622
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:24,790
Why? You said you were going to meet again. Was the atmosphere not good?

623
00:49:24,790 --> 00:49:29,870
I got a message after I texted you...

624
00:49:29,870 --> 00:49:34,110
He's... a bit weird.

625
00:49:34,110 --> 00:49:37,290
Why? What'd he say? Show me.

626
00:49:39,150 --> 00:49:41,710
Here.

627
00:49:41,710 --> 00:49:46,320
"I take back the words that I miss you. To be honest, I have a girlfriend."

628
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:51,050
"I'm trash that was trying to have an affair with you. I apologize."

629
00:49:51,050 --> 00:49:54,870
- What's with him?
 - Did you get dumped?

630
00:49:54,870 --> 00:49:57,390
How can you get rejected instantly?

631
00:49:57,390 --> 00:50:00,810
Love isn't easy.

632
00:50:00,810 --> 00:50:03,970
Not easy.

633
00:50:03,970 --> 00:50:07,290
 Oh, that high schooler? Not sure. 

634
00:50:07,290 --> 00:50:11,430
 Her figure is so-so, but her face is acceptable. 

635
00:50:11,430 --> 00:50:16,620
 But the kid is kind of dense. I think she'll fall for me quickly. 

636
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:20,560
 She's good for some laughs. 

637
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:23,170
 What's going on? 

638
00:50:23,170 --> 00:50:25,000
 Take back what you said this instant. 

639
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:31,300
 I take it back. I take back everything. Is that good? 

640
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:34,740
 To 'Third Auntie':  Did you get home okay? I miss you already. 

641
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:40,010
 What is it, you bastard? Ow! Ow! I have chronic dislocation of my shoulder. 

642
00:50:40,010 --> 00:50:42,260
 You son of a bitch. 

643
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:49,880
- Ta-da! 
 - Wow!

644
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:54,060
- Daebak! 
 - Look at this!

645
00:50:57,270 --> 00:51:01,170
What is that? Is he showing the pic?

646
00:51:01,170 --> 00:51:05,020
- Look at this, here. 
 - That's nose hair!

647
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:06,670
- Is it, really?  
 - Here, here.

648
00:51:06,670 --> 00:51:08,590
Wow. 
  Target Search 

649
00:51:08,590 --> 00:51:10,180
 Target Lock 

650
00:51:10,180 --> 00:51:12,380
You know, this was...

651
00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:16,000
So funny, hey, open a chat room and send it to me.

652
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,030
Hey!

653
00:51:19,030 --> 00:51:23,270
What the heck?  Hey, Im Ju Gyeong!

654
00:51:23,270 --> 00:51:27,710
Hey, hey! Im Ju Gyeong! Give it to me while I'm being nice!

655
00:51:27,710 --> 00:51:30,800
I saw it all! Come here, give it to me.

656
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:36,110
- Give it to me.  
 - What?

657
00:51:36,110 --> 00:51:38,200
I saw everything.

658
00:51:40,550 --> 00:51:44,150
- What's with you? 
 - What are you doing?

659
00:51:48,740 --> 00:51:54,450
Stop! You guys are going to fight again in front me, right?

660
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:02,580
Please, don't! Here, I'll give you back your key. Now, separate!

661
00:52:02,580 --> 00:52:07,970
You, this way. You, that way. Let's go! I'm this way! Go!

662
00:52:16,070 --> 00:52:18,230
Our tutor is a good teacher. You should pay attention.

663
00:52:18,230 --> 00:52:21,050
Will I get out of math abandonment?

664
00:52:21,050 --> 00:52:23,660
Hey, you can do it too.

665
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:28,000
- Don't give up. Both you and I. 
 - Okay.

666
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,900
Right, Kang Su. Should we let my friend who goes to Sinhwa Boys High join our study group?

667
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:35,910
Ah, Sinhwa Boys High? What kind of friend is he?

668
00:52:35,910 --> 00:52:38,970
Now I have billions of question marks dancing around in my brain!

669
00:52:38,970 --> 00:52:42,600
- Why should we invite someone we don't know? 
 - So Ju Gyeong can flirt.

670
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:48,540
♫ Dating is a necessity. Marriage is a choice. Amor Fati!

671
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:01,400
What are you doing? You said you don't do study groups.

672
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:05,020
I said I don't want to, but never said I wouldn't do it.

673
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:09,750
Wow. Our study group has both the school's first and second ranks.

674
00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:12,740
We're totally the avengers.

675
00:53:23,250 --> 00:53:26,760
It's a basic concept. How can you not know?

676
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:29,750
Because... I don't know the basic stuff.

677
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:39,050
When N goes to infinity, it becomes N over N squared, which makes it 1/N, so the limit value is zero.

678
00:53:39,050 --> 00:53:46,930
In contrast, if it is N squared over N, the value will be N, which means it will go to infinity.

679
00:53:53,570 --> 00:53:58,480
- Why?
 - How could such a small head solve these difficult problems?

680
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:00,790
What's your IQ? Is it above 150?

681
00:54:00,790 --> 00:54:03,110
How can you not focus even for just a little while?

682
00:54:03,110 --> 00:54:05,850
Is your IQ two digits? FYI, a dolphin's IQ is 80.

683
00:54:05,850 --> 00:54:09,720
- Dolphins are that smart?
 - If you want to win against dolphins, work harder.

684
00:54:11,620 --> 00:54:13,740
Focus!

685
00:54:16,810 --> 00:54:18,740
So what would its number be?

686
00:54:35,770 --> 00:54:37,770
 I'm jealous. 

687
00:54:38,910 --> 00:54:42,490
By the way... When did you get so close to Lee Su Ho?

688
00:54:42,490 --> 00:54:45,010
He's not the type to teach someone.

689
00:54:45,010 --> 00:54:46,640
This is close?

690
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:48,830
Uh... By his standards.

691
00:54:48,830 --> 00:54:51,120
Ah, that...

692
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:55,640
I'm not sure.

693
00:54:55,640 --> 00:55:00,760
Maybe he's teaching me because I'm so bad at math?

694
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:04,080
That show off.

695
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:10,660
Guys! To commemorate our first study group—

696
00:55:10,660 --> 00:55:13,820
- Coin karaoke? 
 - Okay!

697
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:17,590
- You had this planned, right? 
 - Let's go! Yay!

698
00:55:17,590 --> 00:55:20,540
Lee Su Ho, you're not going, right?

699
00:55:20,540 --> 00:55:22,760
I'll just stop by for a bit and go.

700
00:55:25,290 --> 00:55:30,850
♫ The real, real, real. The absolute real.

701
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:36,000
♫ The real deal has appeared. Right now.

702
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:44,140
♫ The real, real, real. The absolute real.

703
00:55:44,910 --> 00:55:48,290
♫  I'm going to love you deeply.

704
00:55:48,290 --> 00:55:51,140
♫ Cheer up, baby. Cheer up, baby.

705
00:55:51,140 --> 00:55:53,590
♫ Cheer up a little bit more.

706
00:55:53,590 --> 00:55:58,140
♫ A girl shouldn't give her heart easily. That's how you'll like even more.

707
00:55:58,140 --> 00:56:00,950
♫ No, I'm okay. Don't be burdened.

708
00:56:00,950 --> 00:56:03,890
♫ Because I don't have a boyfriend anyway.

709
00:56:03,890 --> 00:56:07,880
♫ But why are you not saying anything?

710
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:11,440
♫ When I see you, it's too much.

711
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:15,110
♫ And when I see you again, it's too much.

712
00:56:15,110 --> 00:56:18,850
♫ It's ice cold. My body is shivering. Naengmyun, naengmyun, naengmyun. ( Cold buckwheat noodles )

713
00:56:18,850 --> 00:56:22,480
♫ Though it's chewy, it's too chewy. Naengmyun, naengmyun, naengmyun.

714
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:27,690
♫ Even so, I love you. Hey-ya! Hey-ya! Fire, fire! Ooh!

715
00:56:27,690 --> 00:56:34,830
♫ Hey-ya! Hey-ya! Warning, warning. No, no! 
 ♫ Hey-ya! Hey-ya! Fire!

716
00:56:35,780 --> 00:56:51,020
♫ Sometimes I forget. Sometimes I meet people pretending I don't care.

717
00:56:51,020 --> 00:56:54,220
Oh! He sings really well.

718
00:56:54,220 --> 00:56:57,840
- He's like a pro singer. 
  - ♫ Since sometime

719
00:56:57,840 --> 00:57:01,950
This song sounds familiar, feels like I've heard it before.

720
00:57:01,950 --> 00:57:04,460
Where did I hear this?

721
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:11,910
♫ How do you do? How are you doing?

722
00:57:11,910 --> 00:57:18,660
♫ I guess I'm not doing too great.

723
00:57:22,210 --> 00:57:25,410
Is it because I haven't been here in a while? I see many new faces.

724
00:57:25,410 --> 00:57:28,630
- You look so great in person! 
 - You're so cool!

725
00:57:28,630 --> 00:57:32,900
We should have a gathering to learn all the faces.

726
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:35,750
Have a seat. Let's start this meeting.

727
00:57:35,750 --> 00:57:37,370
Yes, sir.

728
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:43,970
I think we should release a memorial album in time with Jeong Se Yeon's one-year memorial.

729
00:57:43,970 --> 00:57:48,050
Rather than N6 making a grand comeback without Se Yeon,

730
00:57:48,050 --> 00:57:54,750
I think our priority should be consoling the longing the group's members and fans are feeling with this memorial album.

731
00:57:54,750 --> 00:57:58,350
This song was found in the files Se Yeon left behind.

732
00:57:58,350 --> 00:58:03,680
It's recorded that Se Yeon wrote its lyrics and someone named Leo composed its melody.

733
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:07,850
It's a good song. Did you say Leo?

734
00:58:07,850 --> 00:58:13,650
Yes, who that is isn't revealed yet, so we are searching for him.

735
00:58:22,820 --> 00:58:26,670
Oh? Isn't that Han Seo Jun's motorcycle?

736
00:58:28,290 --> 00:58:30,950
Is he nearby?

737
00:58:33,490 --> 00:58:35,900
Oh! It is.

738
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:39,010
He rode his motorcycle again.

739
00:58:39,010 --> 00:58:41,500
This motorcycle, seriously!

740
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:46,300
Han Seo Jun! I...! I'm going to break this!

741
00:58:46,300 --> 00:58:48,270
What are you doing?

742
00:58:50,060 --> 00:58:53,180
No! Nothing.

743
00:58:53,180 --> 00:58:56,460
- Did you do something to my motorcycle? 
 - I didn't even touch it!

744
00:58:56,460 --> 00:58:58,650
Ah, seriously.

745
00:59:02,350 --> 00:59:05,900
- You! Come here for a bit. 
 - Why? Why? Why?

746
00:59:11,020 --> 00:59:12,500
What's going on?

747
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:16,790
Let's... talk here. Here.

748
00:59:16,790 --> 00:59:20,230
- Is it a conversation that needs to be this private?  
 - Oh, yeah.

749
00:59:20,230 --> 00:59:23,390
Hey! Han Seo Jun!

750
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:29,780
- Why are you coming out from there? 
 - What do you mean?

751
00:59:29,780 --> 00:59:31,740
 You bastard! 

752
00:59:33,290 --> 00:59:34,650
Hey.

753
00:59:34,650 --> 00:59:36,770
 Why did this guy have to appear here? 

754
00:59:36,770 --> 00:59:42,140
Oh, what is this? Why did you bring a girl to this inconspicuous place?

755
00:59:42,140 --> 00:59:44,590
Hey, you should hurry and go.

756
00:59:44,590 --> 00:59:47,170
What should I do?

757
00:59:50,850 --> 00:59:55,400
- Grab them! Grab them! 
 - Hey! Are you not going to stop!

758
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:57,060
Hurry!

759
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:07,540
Stop there!

760
01:00:25,940 --> 01:00:27,760
Seriously.

761
01:00:49,550 --> 01:00:51,200
Where are they?

762
01:00:58,990 --> 01:01:01,260
- What the...? 
 - Damn it!

763
01:01:07,140 --> 01:01:10,810
What's this? This jerk goes to Saebom High.

764
01:01:24,390 --> 01:01:27,260
They are gone. They left.

765
01:01:27,830 --> 01:01:30,420
Hey, I told you to go. Why'd you drag me?

766
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:33,190
What do you think those jerks would think?

767
01:01:35,190 --> 01:01:36,430
What will they think?

768
01:01:36,430 --> 01:01:40,660
If you run like that, it looks fishy to anyone.

769
01:01:40,660 --> 01:01:42,720
You're so stupid.

770
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:45,440
I saved you and what? Stupid? Hey!

771
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:47,950
- Do you know who's the king after King Sejong the Great?
- Gojong.

772
01:01:47,950 --> 01:01:49,860
Where did those 400 years go?

773
01:01:49,860 --> 01:01:53,300
- You're an even bigger idiot. 
 - What?

774
01:01:53,300 --> 01:01:56,870
What's up with you? Why'd you follow us?

775
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:02,170
Where are you going? Han Seo Jun's friend?

776
01:02:02,170 --> 01:02:04,880
Or... his minion?

777
01:02:05,750 --> 01:02:06,870
Move.

778
01:02:06,870 --> 01:02:10,830
If you call Han Seo Jun over, I'll let you go.

779
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:12,660
Why should I?

780
01:02:12,660 --> 01:02:15,990
Wouldn't he come out if a friend called him? Is that not so?

781
01:02:15,990 --> 01:02:17,270
He won't answer my phone call.

782
01:02:17,270 --> 01:02:20,940
Then we can just check. Take his phone.

783
01:02:20,940 --> 01:02:23,720
Just a sec.

784
01:02:24,670 --> 01:02:26,370
It's here.

785
01:02:27,950 --> 01:02:29,740
You grabbed me?

786
01:02:30,590 --> 01:02:32,240
Are you not letting go?

787
01:02:33,740 --> 01:02:35,800
Seriously...

788
01:02:36,620 --> 01:02:37,690
What are you doing?

789
01:02:37,750 --> 01:02:39,550
- Get up. 
 - Where are you going?

790
01:02:39,550 --> 01:02:42,050
Let go. Let go.

791
01:02:42,050 --> 01:02:43,950
This bastard, seriously!

792
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:48,010
Hey, hey, hold him, hold him!

793
01:02:48,010 --> 01:02:49,460
I grabbed him!

794
01:02:49,460 --> 01:02:51,110
You go!

795
01:02:51,140 --> 01:02:52,200
Uh oh, sorry!

796
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:53,790
- You guys! 
 - You're top, I'm bottom.

797
01:02:53,790 --> 01:02:56,080
One, two, three!

798
01:03:02,660 --> 01:03:03,990
Hey, hey, hey!

799
01:03:03,990 --> 01:03:05,990
Grab him!

800
01:03:07,230 --> 01:03:08,480
Hold him tightly!

801
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:11,280
Hold on, stay still for a bit.

802
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:18,020
With no fear, you really want to die!

803
01:03:18,050 --> 01:03:19,850
- What's over there?! 
 - Damn it.

804
01:03:19,850 --> 01:03:22,450
- Let's run. 
 - Let's go.

805
01:03:36,780 --> 01:03:37,850
What?

806
01:03:37,850 --> 01:03:39,860
Lend me some money.

807
01:03:39,860 --> 01:03:41,250
I don't want to.

808
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:44,330
The guys left with my bag because they couldn't find me.

809
01:03:44,330 --> 01:03:46,670
My phone and wallet are in my bag.

810
01:03:46,670 --> 01:03:49,200
You deserve that.

811
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:51,870
Since I saved you, you can think of it as paying back the kindness.

812
01:03:51,870 --> 01:03:54,390
Just the bus fare. Just the bus fee.

813
01:03:54,450 --> 01:03:58,350
What kindness? I don't want to. Try walking.

814
01:03:59,820 --> 01:04:02,020
You're so cold-hearted.

815
01:04:10,660 --> 01:04:12,300
Hey.

816
01:04:14,010 --> 01:04:17,770
- Before I change my mind, hurry and get on. 
 - Really?

817
01:04:17,770 --> 01:04:19,860
Thanks.

818
01:04:22,930 --> 01:04:25,540
How do I get on this?

819
01:04:26,550 --> 01:04:28,870
Like this?

820
01:04:28,870 --> 01:04:30,850
I'm going.

821
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:53,350
 Prince Comics 

822
01:05:05,510 --> 01:05:07,760
Thanks.

823
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:11,150
If you're thankful, delete the picture.

824
01:05:12,550 --> 01:05:14,490
Im Ju Gyeong.

825
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:22,330
I went through all this fuss so these guys wouldn't meet up.

826
01:05:22,330 --> 01:05:25,060
Were you guys a couple in the last lifetime?

827
01:05:25,060 --> 01:05:26,390
It's you again, Lee Su Ho?

828
01:05:26,390 --> 01:05:27,670
Why did you give her a ride?

829
01:05:27,670 --> 01:05:31,050
Then what about you? Why are you waiting for her?

830
01:05:34,410 --> 01:05:38,190
Okay, guys. How about going to your respective homes now?

831
01:05:38,190 --> 01:05:40,050
It's late. You should go over there.

832
01:05:40,050 --> 01:05:43,650
And you over there. On each side—

833
01:05:46,220 --> 01:05:47,780
Unni!

834
01:05:49,410 --> 01:05:51,480
What's this?

835
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:55,480
Who is this pair of pretty boys?

836
01:05:58,650 --> 01:06:03,150
Did I die? Have I gone to heaven?

837
01:06:04,010 --> 01:06:05,930
Unni!

838
01:06:05,930 --> 01:06:07,790
Unni.

839
01:06:10,190 --> 01:06:11,780
Let's go.

840
01:06:11,780 --> 01:06:14,810
I'll make sure you debut.

841
01:06:14,810 --> 01:06:16,550
Unni.

842
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:22,420
I'm going crazy. It's me, wake up!

843
01:06:23,870 --> 01:06:26,230
If you throw up, I'm killing you.

844
01:06:26,710 --> 01:06:28,420
Let's go to your house.

845
01:06:28,420 --> 01:06:30,480
No, why should I?

846
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:33,290
Why should I? Ah, seriously!

847
01:06:33,290 --> 01:06:35,770
Im Hui Gyeong, I dare you to wake up!

848
01:06:35,770 --> 01:06:37,920
Let's go!

849
01:06:37,950 --> 01:06:40,850
Block her mouth, try to cover her mouth.

850
01:06:46,380 --> 01:06:48,740
We're here. It's here!

851
01:06:48,740 --> 01:06:52,540
Thank you so much. I won't ever forget your kindnesses.

852
01:06:52,540 --> 01:06:54,320
No!

853
01:07:19,020 --> 01:07:22,660
I'm so sorry. I'll have it dry-cleaned. No, I'll set it on fire and

854
01:07:22,660 --> 01:07:26,250
buy and give you a new one. I'm so sorry. Goodbye!

855
01:07:41,690 --> 01:07:43,470
Hey, Lee Su Ho.

856
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,280
Do you like Im Ju Gyeong?

857
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:57,430
- What? 
 - You don't like her?

858
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:05,400
What about you, then? Why do you keep hanging around her?

859
01:08:07,670 --> 01:08:09,640
Do you like Im Ju Gyeong?

860
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:15,940
I'm thinking I should.

861
01:08:49,510 --> 01:08:53,000
 Sniskern Energy that doesn't stop 

862

863
01:09:11,580 --> 01:09:15,140
  What? Where are you going, student? 

864
01:09:31,850 --> 01:09:34,100
  Do you like Im Ju Gyeong? 

865
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:13,270
Here, take it.

866
01:10:14,370 --> 01:10:18,150
- Huh? 
 - You said to not ride the motorcycle.

867
01:10:18,150 --> 01:10:20,510
Lee Su Ho is coming behind us.

868
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:25,900
Starting from today, I plan to listen only to you.

869
01:10:29,830 --> 01:10:31,770
What, what? Is he confessing or what?

870
01:10:31,770 --> 01:10:34,510
Does Han Seo Jun like Im Ju Gyeong?

871
01:10:34,510 --> 01:10:36,410
Wow.

872
01:10:36,410 --> 01:10:37,940
Hey, Han Seo Jun.

873
01:10:37,940 --> 01:10:39,810
Don't go.

874
01:10:43,060 --> 01:10:45,730
- Wait. 
 - I said don't go.

875
01:10:59,430 --> 01:11:06,420

 If there's no other seat, sit here. 

884
01:11:41,390 --> 01:11:43,340
 She had a goddess mask on.

  But... don't play with Im Ju Gyeong. 

893
01:12:03,590 --> 01:12:05,910
