1
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:04,750
 True Beauty 

2
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:13,200


3
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:32,100
 True Beauty 

4
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:59,040
 The ace of Seonil High School, player Ryu Hyeong Jin. Six wins and no losses this season. 

5
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:02,840
 He's currently ranked as the number one for earned run average.  

6
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:08,040
 Strike one. 

7
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,980
 Strike two. 

8
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:13,390
 Strikeout! 

9
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:15,620
 - What situation is this? 
 - It's two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning. 

10
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:19,090
 Tie at 5 to 5. Ryu Hyeong Jin is pitching! 

11
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:21,050
 What is going on with Ryu Hyeong Jin? 

12
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:23,630
 Is there a problem? 

13
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:26,290
 The screen isn't frozen, right? 

14
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:29,770
 W-what's wrong? 

15
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:38,260
Strike.

16
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:41,610
It has hit the center...

17
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:52,490
 Episode 7  
 Hello.

18
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:54,320
Whoa, Mr. Han!

19
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,970
You are glowing. There's light coming from your forehead.

20
00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:00,560
- You look so handsome! 
 - Mr. Han, you look great as expected!

21
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,270
The classroom is that way.

22
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:04,220
We already know that.

23
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:08,210
We wanted to tell you that you look cool. See you later!

24
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:18,130
This is thanks to Hui Gyeong's mo–

25
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:20,690
Ju Gyeong's mother.

26
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:27,820
No...

27
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,750
How could she not give me a single call

28
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:35,010
while these eyebrows were settling in place?

29
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:38,650
Is a kiss a joke to her?

30
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:41,840
Are my lips easy? Hello?

31
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,180
Hello, this is Han Jun Woo.

32
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:47,200
Lower. Get lower. Get into the proper position.

33
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,330
- Do it properly! 
- Good morning.

34
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:53,370
If the noraebang owner reported you all to the police,

35
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:55,860
you would've been forced to transfer schools. Do you understand?

36
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:58,440
I said it wasn't us, Teach!

37
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,470
A group fight at the noraebang involving Saebeom High School students.

38
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:03,410
Would there be others besides you boys?

39
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:06,220
If there are, bring them here, you rascals.

40
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:08,180
We said it really wasn't us!

41
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:11,830
It wasn't us!

42
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:14,230
That person was me!

43
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:17,090
The fight. I was in it.

44
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:19,420
Seo Jun...

45
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:21,450
I was going to call on you either way.

46
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:25,420
Stand here. Seriously, all you rascals...

47
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:27,540
Get in position!

48
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,980
- Seo Jun... 
 - Don’t look at me. It’s embarrassing

49
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,950
Be quiet!

50
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:34,260
- The group fight... 
 - It was us!

51
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,760
- What? 
 - Kids!

52
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,190
Wow, you three look well-behaved, but you have no fear.

53
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:41,470
Stand right here. Hurry!

54
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:43,640
Stand here! Get in position.

55
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,290
Get in position properly!

56
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:47,750
These rascals, seriously.

57
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:50,640
This is really a big issue.

58
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,700
I was with them too.

59
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,750
I see this is a trainwreck.

60
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,910
Oh my, seriously.

61
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:00,100
I started it first.

62
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,780
That fight.

63
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:03,700
Good job. You did well.

64
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,750
Oh dear!

65
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,920
You rascals!

66
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,240
Our school's number one,

67
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,040
are you hurt anywhere? Anywhere?!

68
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,520
I can't even! Those idiots from Yongpa High! ( TN: "Pa" meaning "faction" is added to gang names in Korean )

69
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,730
What did they do to you guys

70
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:24,390
that our Su Ho got into a fight?

71
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,830
Mr. Han Jun Woo?  Mr. Han Jun Woo?

72
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:29,370
- Yes? 
 - Ah, here.

73
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:31,500
A flower delivery came for you.

74
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,130
- Woo hoo! 
 - Wow!

75
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:37,480
Flower? Who?

76
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:40,930
- Ah, Im Hui– 
 - AH!

77
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:43,350
Sorry.

78
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:45,950
It's nothing. I got it. I know.

79
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:48,360
I think I know who sent it.

80
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,500
You all go to the counseling room.

81
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,000
- You! 
 - Yes?

82
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,670
Guys...

83
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,790
Go to the counseling room.

84
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:07,630
 Did you receive the flowers? 

85
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:11,790
Ms. Im Hui Gyeong, why did you send flowers?

86
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:15,920
But can't a woman send a man flowers?

87
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,750
We even kissed.

88
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,170
- Ms. Im Hui Gyeong! 
 - It's Reeve's spiraea.

89
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:23,010
Re...Reeve's what?

90
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:25,200
Reeve's spiraea.  Reeve's spiraea!

91
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:29,240
Oh yes, no. Right now, it's not important what kind of flowers they are.

92
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:32,170
Do you know what the meaning of Reeve's spiraea is in the language of flowers?

93
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:34,560
"I'll work hard to make it work with you."

94
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,170
I'm working hard right now to make you as my man, Mr. Han Jun Woo.

95
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:43,640
So please think about me whenever you look at the flowers.

96
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:47,480
I have a business trip tomorrow. Are you free for dinner tonight?

97
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,890
I'm busy.  It's exam season, so I'm a bit busy.

98
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:53,680
I guess I'm the only one disappointed.

99
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,170
Are you still not interested in buying new shoes?

100
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:59,430
Please think deeply about that.

101
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,460
 I am sorry. 

102
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:13,030
 I am sorry. 

103
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,230
Are you two Han Seok Bong? 
  (TN: Han Seok Bong is a calligrapher from the Joseon Dynasty.) 

104
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:27,660
What great calligraphers you guys are!  Why don't you just get the proper ink and brush?

105
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:30,450
At this rate, when will you write 10 pages?

106
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:32,630
Okay, look here.

107
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:35,230
Look. How about this?

108
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:37,880
My ambidextrous skills, which I've obtained from my previous experience.

109
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,240
What do you think?

110
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:43,140
Honey, do you think these two have ever written a statement of apology?

111
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,680
Look here.

112
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,660
That's something to brag about.

113
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:57,240
I'm sorry, guys. It's all my fault.

114
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,970
Why are you sorry?

115
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:03,210
Hey Han Seo Jun, you should apologize to Ju Gyeong.

116
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:06,760
Those people bothered her because they thought she was your girlfriend.

117
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:10,180
Well, she looks healthy.

118
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,820
Are your legs just accessories?

119
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:14,710
You should've run away.

120
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:16,920
Do you have your mouth for making others angry?

121
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,320
Whatever.

122
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:21,050
They don't have a reason to bother you anymore,

123
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:22,890
so don't worry.

124
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:27,160
Did you look for them and fight again?

125
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,620
What fight?

126
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:32,660
They're not at a level to fight with me.

127
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:36,610
If I met them, then it would probably be to crush them.

128
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,040
- Crush them? 
 - Crush them?

129
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:46,660
- Dang... 
 - He's too scary.

130
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,380
Let's hurry up and finish it quickly.

131
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:50,720
Keep writing.

132
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:53,780
Gosh, he's scary.

133
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:04,130
Hey, Lee Su Ho.

134
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,740
No matter what is between us,

135
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:10,200
the thing with my mom is a separate issue

136
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:13,200
and it's something that I'm thankful for.

137
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:16,460
But from now on,

138
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:19,060
don't concern yourself with my problems.

139
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,430
What? What are you doing?

140
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:32,950
Ah, I dozed off for a bit.

141
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:38,200
Dozed...?

142
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:41,860
What is with him?

143
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,460
Damn...

144
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,770
 Roar! 

145
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:57,200
Hey!

146
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:00,950
- What? 
 - Do... that.

147
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:03,850
- What is "that?" 
 - That... "Roar!"

148
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:05,890
- That. 
 - What?

149
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:10,390
What? Roar! ROARRR!

150
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:14,730
Wow... I'm scared this will appear in my dreams.

151
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:16,850
What a wild animal.

152
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,820
What the heck?

153
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:23,150
That's nonsense, for sure.

154
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:25,130
You are studying for your exams, right?

155
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:28,860
Teacher! Please decrease the scope of the exam for Korean Literature.

156
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,510
Just a little.

157
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:32,830
- It's too much now! 
 - That's right!

158
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:36,750
There are some people who don't know what they really want,

159
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:39,300
and some others who are hesitating even though they know what they want.

160
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:42,780
But this thing called opportunity is suddenly coming to you like an unpredicted shower,

161
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,840
so only the people who are prepared can grasp it.

162
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:48,700
Therefore, when the opportunity to achieve your desired dream comes to you, if you want to catch that opportunity properly—

163
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:51,480
Teacher! Thank you for imparting your words of wisdom to us again!

164
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,860
You are the best! Goodbye!

165
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,110
- Thank you, sir! 
 - Bye!

166
00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:00,070
Hey, let's go get tteokbokki  (spicy rice cakes) !

167
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:05,490
Do your best in preparing for your midterms.

168
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:07,940
That's what I wanted to say.

169
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,600
That's all for today.

170
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,270
- Lee Su Ho. 
 - Yes?

171
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:22,880
Well... a new volume of 'Mystery Scenario' was released.

172
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,000
Do you want to go to Prince Comics with me?

173
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,630
- No. 
 - Okay.

174
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:31,090
What is he so busy with?

175
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:37,180
- Im Ju Gyeong. 
 - Yes?

176
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:40,260
The bus is almost here though.

177
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:43,030
I didn't tell you to get on.

178
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:45,330
You said you needed to raise your grades.

179
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:49,000
Let's study together. I'll see you at the study cafe tomorrow.

180
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:06,350
You want us to study together? Why?

181
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:15,110
 Because... I want to be with you. 

182
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:26,220
 See you tomorrow. Goodnight. 

183
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:28,570
Goodnight.

184
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:34,700
Goodnight? You want to 'goodnight' in the early evening?

185
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:38,180
During exam time, you don't think about studying and instead want to sleep?!

186
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:40,010
I was studying.

187
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:44,840
You... If you don't increase your rank by thirty this time, I'm going to throw away everything.

188
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:49,540
I understand! I'm studying, but you're hindering me.

189
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:26,380
You're cool even while sleeping, huh?

190
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:28,240
It's heart fluttering.

191
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,910
I don't want to study.

192
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:01,030
You're falling asleep again? Wow, you must not care about studying at all.

193
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:02,830
Quick, name the poets of the Blue Deer Anthology.

194
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:05,680
One, two, three.

195
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,460
You must have slept during class hours. Will you be able to raise your grades like this?

196
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:11,510
This is scary. Why are you so harsh on her?

197
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:15,050
Did you have to reprimand her to the point of hiccups?

198
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,670
Oh, right. When we finish the exam, shall we go to the baseball stadium?

199
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:26,260
Oppa Hyeong Jin has a game that day.

200
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:28,680
I can't because of my private tutoring.

201
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:31,370
Okay. I went last time and it was fun.

202
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,530
Yes!

203
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:36,450
But it's a secret from Hoon, okay?

204
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,640
What's a secret?

205
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:41,550
Huh? It's nothing.

206
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:44,060
Ah, is it like a surprise or something?

207
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:46,870
No. Study.

208
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,990
- We're going to go first.
 - We're going!

209
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:56,830
Get home safely.

210
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:02,130
- I'm going.
 - Bye.

211
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:04,040
Why does he look tired?

212
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,650
- We should go too.
 - Yeah, let's go.

213
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:08,680
Who's this jerk?

214
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,730
Im Ju Gyeong. I... at the noraebang ...

215
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:21,470
I was going to apologize!

216
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:23,730
I was going to say I'm sorry.

217
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:26,700
I did it, okay?

218
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:31,610
What's wrong with him? Did he eat something weird?

219
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:36,690
Why? Why is that?

220
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:39,390
Oh! You scared me.

221
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:44,400
Hey. You saw, right? I apologized.

222
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:03,290
  Apologize. 

223
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:05,790
 This jerk, seriously. 

224
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:08,700
 Apologize! 

225
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:13,310
 Apologize! Apologize! Apologize! 

226
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:19,340
 Apologize! Apologize! Apologize! 

227
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:24,650
 Apologize! Apologize! Apologize! 

228
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:35,480
 What's this? What's going on? 

229
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:39,320
  Apologize! 

230
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:42,310
 Ah, this crazy jerk! 

231
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:48,340
 Damn it! I almost won. 

232
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:55,350
 Father, I'm home. 

233
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:58,670
 - Seong Yong, did you do something to apologize for?
 - What? 

234
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,250
I couldn't sleep because I was chasing him around.

235
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:20,070
But it's a relief.

236
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:22,820
I was afraid that he would hold a grudge and track me down again.

237
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:26,390
Now I can sleep in peace.

238
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:28,470
Drink up, drink up!

239
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:31,330
Wow, that must be nice.

240
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:33,820
When will we become college students?

241
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:36,180
But is alcohol that great?

242
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,950
When my sister drinks, she gets drunk. She's a dog.

243
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:41,410
Well, because drinking makes you feel good?

244
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:44,250
You drank before?

245
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:48,010
A little of the bottle that my father left out at night.

246
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:51,880
Why? Have you never had the taste of alcohol?

247
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:55,940
I'm a scaredy cat, I didn't even try.

248
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:02,120
Alright, cheers!

249
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:06,980
Finishing touch.

250
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:14,340
How is it? Do I look older?

251
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:18,670
You're totally a college student. The popular girl at a women's university type of feeling?

252
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:21,060
I'm so thirsty.

253
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:26,130
Hey, aren't that professor's lectures boring these days?

254
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:30,660
Yes, that's right. What do you want to do on our free period on Monday?

255
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:33,850
I'm not sure. Should we ask the class president to buy us lunch?

256
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:35,690
Sounds good.

257
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:39,610
Your ID card?

258
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:44,830
Oh my. I forgot my ID card. Do you have yours?

259
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:48,880
I also forgot. Can't you just ring us up? We're college students.

260
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,720
- Which college? 
 - Hankuk University, second year.

261
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,280
- What major? 
 - English.

262
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,260
I'd like to pay, please.

263
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:55,920
- What is the name of the English department's homeroom teacher?
 - Han Jun Woo.

264
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,500
- Ju Gyeong! 
 - Gotcha!

265
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,550
You guys are high schoolers, right?

266
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:03,230
Shall I call your homeroom teacher, huh?

267
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:05,110
- I'm sorry. 
 - I'm sorry.

268
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:07,820
- Cheers! 
 - Cheers!

269
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:15,720
- I'm getting drunk!
 - It's sweet.

270
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:20,740
- That looks really good.
 - Oh, the smell!

271
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:25,730
- How is it? 
 - It's tasty!

272
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:28,590
Hey, hey. But aren't I an idiot?

273
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:32,200
Hey! What was that about our English teacher? Ouch!

274
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,240
Oh no!

275
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:36,710
Do you keep putting on hand cream?

276
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:39,080
It's okay.

277
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:42,350
That looks painful. How'd it turn out like that?

278
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:46,030
Well, it's because of my habit.

279
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:49,040
I keep washing my hands.

280
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,500
I do it unconsciously when I'm stressed.

281
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,300
I need to fix it, but it's not going well.

282
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:56,010
Stress? From what?

283
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:59,460
What do you think? It's because of my grades.

284
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:03,800
Wow, if I had your grades, my parents would carry me around.

285
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:07,810
My pride will get hurt, so don't tell anybody.

286
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:11,030
You're the first friend I've told.

287
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:16,770
Thanks. For telling me.

288
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:19,770
What are you thanking me for?

289
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:28,060
To be honest, before I transferred here, I was an outcast.

290
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,630
What?

291
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:34,030
But I'm so happy that I made a friend like you now.

292
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:37,820
You're the only one who knows, okay? Cheers!

293
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:51,010
The Blue Deer Anthology. In 1939, the poets Cho Chi Hun, Pak Tu Jin, and Park Mok—

294
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:58,490
I... was about to crack my head. Thanks.

295
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:01,630
I blocked you so the tree wouldn't be bent.

296
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:04,490
Wow, you're like a rock.

297
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:07,000
What? A rock?

298
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:11,980
What are you looking at?

299
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:14,890
Don't talk to me. I can't fail this exam.

300
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:18,010
Oh, we have an exam today?

301
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:19,320
What are you looking at?

302
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:24,530
Literature. No matter how little interest you have in studying, isn't this too much?

303
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:26,700
And you're good at studying?

304
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:29,910
Hey, I at least put in effort.

305
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:33,290
Do you know what group Cho Chi Hun, Pak Tu Jin, and Park Mok Wol were in?

306
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:35,730
Whether they're a physically-adept group or an impulsive group, what's that to me?

307
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:38,620
Wow, you are so dumb. They're in the Blue Deer Anthology poetry group! Blue Deer!

308
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:40,830
This is definitely going to be on the exam. Remember it.

309
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:45,640
And the group of Life Poets started to write poems in the 1930's.

310
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:49,300
From one to five, what number do you like?

311
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,960
Three?

312
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,020
I should choose five. 
  (Korean exams have answer choices 1-5) 

313
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:14,810
You didn't bring a pen?

314
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:16,120
I borrowed it.

315
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,140
You should have told me. I brought three.

316
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:20,270
Dang, I should have borrowed from you.

317
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:21,540
Did you study a lot?

318
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,900
No. If I don't know the answer, I always choose three.

319
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,770
If you don't know either, pick three.

320
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:28,350
No. I can solve it.

321
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:33,540
Good luck on the exam, Im Ju. Fighting!

322
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:15,710
Until now, there hasn't been a candle like this. Is this a perfume or a candle?

323
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:18,110
A hand-made aroma scented candle is only ₩9,000.

324
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:20,740
- I'll buy two.
 - Thank you, madam.

325
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:23,410
This smells so good.

326
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:26,080
- It's okay, right?
 - Thank you.

327
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,660
Sell a lot!

328
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:31,330
- We'll buy it next time.
 - Yes, please do.

329
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,540
What have you been doing all these days at your wife's salon?

330
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:42,770
I'm making money! I made over ₩100,000 (~$100) today!

331
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:45,300
Shut that mouth.

332
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:48,450
What? You're making money now? How much was it to gather all of the materials?

333
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:50,130
- It was ₩5,000 per unit. 
 - How many did you make?

334
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:51,990
- I made 50 to start off. 
 - How many did you sell?

335
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:55,990
- About 30 candles...? 
 - After spending ₩250,000, you earned ₩270,000?  Plus, ₩70,000 for the class at the Cultural Center.

336
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:57,450
₩80,000.

337
00:23:57,450 --> 00:24:00,050
If you add in transportation fees, you're in the negatives!

338
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:03,900
Gosh, this life in the negatives! Don't waste time nor money.

339
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:08,170
Stay still and just breathe. Got it?!

340
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:19,260
Ryu Hyeong Jin! Ryu Hyeong Jin! Ryu Hyeong Jin!

341
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:24,590
- Wow! 
 - What did you tell Tae Hoon about coming here?

342
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:27,370
Oh, I told him that it was my grandma's 80th birthday party!

343
00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:29,710
Live a long life, Grandma!

344
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:34,310
What a big birthday party, renting out a baseball stadium! Is this a celebratory game?

345
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:38,330
- Did you think I wouldn't know? 
   - Oppa, I'll go to cheer you on at your semifinal tournament! 

346
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:41,830
Did you spy on the one I'm following? Gosh, I'm getting goosebumps.

347
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:43,310
You lying to your boyfriend gives me more goosebumps!

348
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:46,650
Would you have let me come if you knew? You get jealous so easily over guys I know!

349
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:49,380
If I had bad intentions, I'd DM him and meet him separately.

350
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:51,680
Would I have come here to cheer him on so innocently?

351
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,410
What's with you guys? Let's not fight.

352
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:54,850
Who said I doubted you?

353
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:57,860
Would that guy you know see you only as a girl he knew?

354
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:03,020
You look like an angel! How could he not fall for you?!

355
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:05,440
Well, that's true, but...

356
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:09,230
We even bought chicken. Are we supposed to leave? How could we?

357
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:14,620
I'm sorry. Gosh, you're so cute that I can't even get mad.

358
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:20,380
My heart. You're so cute.

359
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:22,500
Honey, have this chicken, okay?

360
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:25,990
Alright, thank you.

361
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:30,860
Lee Su Ho, when did you get so close to Tae Hoon that you come to baseball games with him?

362
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:33,280
Yeah, we're close. Starting today.

363
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:38,940
Su Ho, I really treasure this, but I'll give it to you.

364
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:40,710
Congrats.

365
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:51,240
♫   Real, real, real. It's totally real   ♫

366
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:57,340
The real one appeared, Seonil! 
♫  The real one appeared, now!   ♫

367
00:25:57,340 --> 00:26:09,790
♫   Real, real, real. It's totally real.  I will love you truly   ♫

368
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:21,110
Gosh, what a jerk. Lee Su Ho, why are you bothering Ju Gyeong?

369
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,470
I'm going to throw this away.

370
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:26,660
Hyeong Jin was so good, right?

371
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:30,270
What if he really gets chosen by a Major League team at this rate?

372
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:33,450
Oh! Oppa! Hyeong Jin Oppa!

373
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:39,410
- What? 
 - Oppa!

374
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,170
Do you know how long I was searching for you after the last game?

375
00:26:48,170 --> 00:26:51,850
Wow, you were friends with Su Ah?

376
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:54,940
- What? 
 - Two strikes.

377
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:58,570
Looking at you from this close, how are you so pretty?

378
00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:01,490
Wow.

379
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:05,120
If you're Su Ah's friend, I guess I'm your oppa.

380
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:09,820
Ooh, Ryu Hyeong Jin!

381
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:12,910
- Give me your number, alright? 
 - My phone number?

382
00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:17,250
- Give it! Give it! Give it! 
 - I have to go. Quickly.

383
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:19,110
Give it! Give it! Give it!

384
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:21,570
- Ah, I... 
 - Give it! Give it!

385
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:29,340
Give it! Give it! Give it! Give it!

386
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:31,370
Here you go.

387
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:37,490
I saved it. I'll reach out to you.

388
00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:44,820
That's amazing! Has he fallen for you?

389
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:47,150
Are you so fearless of the world, just giving your number out like that?

390
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:51,330
You think it's okay just because Su Ah knows him? What if he's weird?

391
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:52,760
What?

392
00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:55,730
I'll be going.

393
00:27:58,550 --> 00:28:00,500
What's up with him?

394
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:11,460
  To be honest, I've fallen for you. 

395
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:14,360
  Even when I buy shoes, 

396
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:19,360
  I ponder about them and look at them for a long time before I buy them. 

397
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,760
  Then, I feel more affection towards them and treasure them. 

398
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:25,670
  Even when they get old, I still cherish them. 

399
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:32,070
  Then, from now on, how about you ponder about me and look at me for a long time? 

400
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:35,110
  But when I'm not interested in buying shoes, 

401
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:38,560
  I don't even go near shoe stores. 

402
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:41,190
  You seem like a great woman, 

403
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:44,790
  but I'm not looking to date right now. 

404
00:28:56,900 --> 00:29:00,320
 Are you still not interested in buying new shoes? 

405
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,230
In my current circumstances, love is a luxury.

406
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:07,030
What's this? Are you thinking of your lover?

407
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:10,260
- No, I'm not. 
 - Yeah, right. You totally are!

408
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:12,920
- I'm not. 
 - He said he isn't!

409
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:15,290
- Right? 
 - Right.

410
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:17,910
Then, that's great.

411
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:22,280
What? Oh, you.

412
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:27,180
♫ Close your eyes and feel the wind.

413
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:29,150
This sound.

414
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:36,030
♫ It's the feeling of your mother's touch.

415
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:37,780
That's her from the festival?

416
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:42,420
She looks like a totally different person. Just like Im Ju Bal.

417
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:49,930
Bravo. That was great. I praise you.

418
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:53,900
That vibrato and the perfect high-pitched head voice.

419
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:56,690
What kind of crazy...

420
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:03,460
No need to get embarrassed.

421
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:14,980
Woohoo!

422
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:17,780
Why'd you follow me?

423
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:20,150
You like Ju Gyeong, don't you?

424
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:23,240
You make it so obvious. Did you think I wouldn't know?

425
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:25,740
I knew it was weird when you followed me to the baseball game,

426
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,980
but when you were eating chicken,

427
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:30,010
you just gave Ju Gyeong all the drumsticks.

428
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:31,990
That's true love.

429
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:37,790
But after seeing you getting so jealous of Ryu Hyeong Jin, you're back to the...

430
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:41,970
I'm so smart! Gosh, I'm crazy.

431
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:44,770
But you didn't even confess. What are you doing?

432
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:48,970
If you keep hesitating, Ju Gyeong will be taken by a guy like Ryu Hyeong Jin!

433
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:53,200
I mean, she's not taken yet, but...

434
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:02,210
Have fun on your date, okay?

435
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:06,230
Hey, Su Ah! Choi Su Ah!

436
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:08,470
- How are you here? 
 - I'm going to drop you off at home.

437
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:10,610
- What? 
 - It's just an excuse.

438
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:13,960
I wanted to see you again, so I ran away from my dorm.

439
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,490
You ran away? Is that allowed?

440
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:20,310
No! If I get caught, I'll be kicked out of my team.

441
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:25,530
What do we do? You should go back. Go back.

442
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:29,380
I'm joking. I'm the ace. How can they kick me out?

443
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:32,100
Ah, I see.

444
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:35,940
Ah. Three strikes.

445
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:40,490
I think I'm totally taken by you.

446
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:43,680
Hey, even when we were studying together, you had Ju Gyeong right in your grasp.

447
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,700
Tsundere? That doesn't work anymore. ( TN: Tsundere is a Japanese term for someone who is initially cold but warms up over time.) 

448
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:51,010
If I were her, I'd just choose to date a straightforward guy like Ryu Hyeong Jin.

449
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:53,900
What am I supposed to do, then?

450
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:58,930
What do we do with you, huh? With your inexperience in dating?

451
00:31:58,930 --> 00:32:02,700
Should I give you a tip?

452
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,770
Do you have a boyfriend?

453
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:08,430
Oh, no.

454
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:13,580
Is that so? I don't have a girlfriend, either.

455
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:19,080
If you think about it, the chances of the person I like liking me back...

456
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:24,020
Comparing it to baseball, that's just as hard as having a perfect game, right?

457
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:30,250
  The chances of the person I like liking me back? 

458
00:32:35,930 --> 00:32:37,820
Hey!

459
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:41,630
Oh, Su Ho! My best friend!

460
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:45,770
- Hey! 
 - Wow...

461
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:50,290
The strong-willed Yoo Tae Hoon! You tried for so long, and Su Ho finally gave in!

462
00:32:50,290 --> 00:32:53,400
I won't wash my hand today.

463
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:58,690
Happiness is not based on your grades, but if you get good grades, you're happy.

464
00:32:58,690 --> 00:33:04,370
Lee Su Ho! Congratulations on being the first among all 11th grade students of our school. Give him a round of applause!

465
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:07,640
 Im Ju Gyeong - Korean Literature / Probability and Statistics / Calculus / English...  

466
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,000
 School rank: 175 
 Literature 49% / Probabilities and Statistics 50%... 

467
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,320
- Alright, Seo Jun. 
 - I'm doomed.

468
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:15,640
Seo Jun, let's give applause, hoping he can be happy in the future!

469
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:24,100
Oh! A 50% in literature. I just chose 3 for all multiple-choice questions. That's amazing.

470
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:29,310
Hey, Im Ju Gyeong, what'd you get? Let's see.

471
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:34,880
49%? Gosh, even though you acted so arrogantly. Keep up the good work.

472
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:43,470
I should've chosen the number 3 for all questions, too. Mom is going to kill me.

473
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:52,770
Su Jin, are you ranked second again, then? What a shame.

474
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:58,090
  School rank: 12th. Class rank: 4th 

475
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:10,780
You got the right answers but marked wrongly, starting from question #30.

476
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:14,770
Kang Su Jin, why'd you make such mistakes? You normally don't.

477
00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:16,780
I'll be going.

478
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:25,180
- What's wrong? 
 - Don't know. You're annoying.

479
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:32,670
Hey, hey! Isn't that Ryu Hyeong Jin?

480
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:36,480
What? Isn't that Ryu Hyeong Jin?

481
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,180
- Isn't that Ryu Hyeong Jin? 
 - That's him, right?

482
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:39,780
My eyes are enjoying this so much.

483
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:41,640
His looks are amazing.

484
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:45,330
- Which classroom is Im Ju Gyeong in? 
 - Im Ju Gyeong?

485
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:47,320
Still, your rank went up by 20.

486
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,380
It's not like it went down. You think she'd be mad?

487
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:52,100
- Right? 
 - Ju Gyeong!

488
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:54,530
- Ju Gyeong! 
 - Oppa Hyeong Jin!

489
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:57,910
- Huh? 
 - What is this?

490
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,080
Why have you come?

491
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:05,500
To see you. Take this.

492
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,590
Take what?

493
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:10,060
Hey, speak up. Hey, I think he wants to fight.

494
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:14,890
I have a bit of a jinx, so I can't throw the ball without this.

495
00:35:14,890 --> 00:35:17,540
But why are you giving it to me?

496
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:20,550
I'd like you to come to my final game.

497
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:25,710
If I win, there's something I'd officially like to tell you.

498
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:27,600
Can't you just tell me now?

499
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:31,810
No. How could someone confess in a place like this?

500
00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:33,770
Amazing. Is he giving a notice in advance about confessing?

501
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:36,400
- Whoa! 
 - Oh my god!

502
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,900
Oh, Im Ju Gyeong, you're quite popular.

503
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:42,850
There was recently a huge rumor that we were dating.

504
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:45,070
You can't do this so suddenly without giving any break term.

505
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:48,670
- What? 
 - You don't have much consideration towards your previous boyfriend.

506
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:53,410
What are you guys doing? Who are you?

507
00:35:53,410 --> 00:35:56,560
- Come to the game, alright? You pretty thing. 
 - Hey, you!

508
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:00,300
Oppa!

509
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:07,210
You! Where are going?

510
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:20,260
Hey, Su Ho. You remember me, right?

511
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:22,120
We were in the same class last year.

512
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:25,270
We've also done some group projects too.

513
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:30,650
I've actually been interested in you since last year.

514
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:33,860
- If you don't have a girlfriend, do you—
- No.

515
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:36,500
I have someone that I like.

516
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:46,060
Someone that he likes?

517
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:57,310
I can't believe he likes someone...

518
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,960
 You must come, pretty girl. 

519
00:37:12,370 --> 00:37:15,010
 The weather forecast says we will have spring rains soon. 

520
00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:20,460
 - Therefore, I bought a pretty rainbow car. Beautiful! How is it? Is it pretty?
- Yes! 

521
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:24,350
 - Does it look good together with me? 
 - Yes! 

522
00:37:24,350 --> 00:37:28,960
 (silently) Shh! Your mom is so mad! 

523
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,730
 - She threw away all your cosmetics. 
 - What? 

524
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:34,380
 Wait! 

525
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:38,870
 Pay attention! One, two, three! 

526
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:46,380
- Where are the apples—
- I brought you apples.

527
00:38:05,830 --> 00:38:08,220
- Mom! 
 - Oh! When did you get back?

528
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:11,180
Where are all my cosmetics?

529
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:14,570
- I have thrown them away. Why? 
- What?

530
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:17,050
I called your homeroom teacher and heard everything.

531
00:38:17,050 --> 00:38:19,690
You didn't increase your rank by 30.

532
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:23,280
It's up, though. It didn't even go down. Can't you just let it go? Huh?

533
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,670
Yeah, her ranking went up by 20.

534
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:30,680
Even if your rank went up by 50, you wouldn't even be able to go to a four-year university in Seoul, girl.

535
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:32,570
I didn't expect you to rank 30th among all the 11th grade students of your school, did I?

536
00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:34,220
At the very least, if you studied freaking hard,

537
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:36,850
it wouldn't have been that hard to bring your rank up by 30 places from your previous rank, would it?

538
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:39,510
Right.  You were at rock bottom to begin with...

539
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:42,750
But I did my best.

540
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:46,360
Where are all the cosmetics? You didn't really throw away all that stuff, did you? Huh? Did you hide it?

541
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:48,200
I've really thrown them away!

542
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:51,770
From now on, see what's going to happen if you walk around with makeup caked on your face.

543
00:38:51,770 --> 00:38:54,420
It's not just cosmetics. I'm going to throw you away too!

544
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:56,270
What?

545
00:38:57,270 --> 00:38:59,140
Did you really throw them away?

546
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:03,370
Mom! You know how much I treasured them, but you secretly threw them away?

547
00:39:03,370 --> 00:39:05,950
- They're mine! Are they yours? 
 - How dare you raise your voice!

548
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:08,390
What do you want me to do when it doesn't work even though I really worked hard?

549
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:09,770
Is it my fault that my brain is not smart?

550
00:39:09,770 --> 00:39:13,440
There's nothing you can't do with a lot of effort. It's because you put in less effort than others do!

551
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:16,210
This time I really did it like I was going to die!

552
00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:21,010
Why don't you believe me? Why?! You always don't trust me.

553
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:24,500
This is why I don't talk to you.

554
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:28,650
Hey. You're crying and blowing up because I threw away your cosmetics.

555
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:32,000
Right. What didn't you tell me?

556
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,170
What didn't you tell me?!

557
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:38,560
Do you know why I'm wearing makeup like my life depends on it?

558
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:41,330
You don't know how I feel!

559
00:39:41,330 --> 00:39:45,320
You really don't know anything.

560
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:51,680
What I had to go through at school in the past ...

561
00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:02,530
You! Where are you going at this hour?!

562
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:05,980
Yes! Go out and never come back, girl!

563
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:08,780
Honey, hold it back, hold it back.

564
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:17,950
 Su Ho, shouldn't you make the other person's heart flutter? 

565
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:20,860
 The heart like pounding, huh? 

566
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:23,860
 First, just go in front of her house and call her. And if she answers? 

567
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:28,130
 Then tell her that you miss her. With the deep sound of your breath.  

568
00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:30,360
 Make sure to show her that you miss her, like emotionally. 

569
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:33,410
 Then, she's going to say, "where are you right now?" 

570
00:40:33,410 --> 00:40:37,220
 Then, as if you've been waiting, tell her to open your window. Open the window. 

571
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:41,700
 An emotional  look... You give her an emotional look. And here's the key point. Write that down. 

572
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:45,980
 When she comes out, you hug her and push her against the wall and then hit the wall— 

573
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:49,300
 Do I have to? The wall? 

574
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:52,430
 Don't you watch dramas? Your face looks exactly like the male lead from a drama. 

575
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:55,340
 What should I do with you? Aigo. 

576
00:40:56,350 --> 00:40:59,000
 Have you even kissed bef—. Aigo.  

577
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,710
 Hey. Hey! After you hit the wall? 

578
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:03,090
 The wall, my ass. 

579
00:41:33,270 --> 00:41:35,390
Im Ju Gyeong.

580
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:50,380
Haven't you eaten?

581
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:53,980
What's that?

582
00:41:54,990 --> 00:41:59,020
Ah... My mom really threw away my cosmetics.

583
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:03,830
Because my rank didn't go up by 30 places. She's so merciless.

584
00:42:06,310 --> 00:42:10,280
- So that's why you cried? 
 - No.

585
00:42:12,350 --> 00:42:15,650
Ah, right... You already saw.

586
00:42:16,570 --> 00:42:20,940
It was just frustrating.

587
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,350
She does not even know why I'm obsessed with cosmetics.

588
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:36,090
She should've given birth to me with a smart brain then.

589
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:39,140
You did well.

590
00:42:43,050 --> 00:42:45,680
I said you did well.

591
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:49,750
I know you've worked hard, and your rank went up 20 places too.

592
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:51,840
I'm proud of you.

593
00:42:54,570 --> 00:42:56,640
Are you crying again?

594
00:42:58,130 --> 00:43:01,680
Crying? You're teasing me now, aren't you?

595
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:05,020
I can't even feel moved by a word from the top student of the whole school.

596
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:08,660
What can I do for you?

597
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:12,220
Do you want me to buy you all new cosmetics?

598
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:15,710
Why are you so sweet today?

599
00:43:15,710 --> 00:43:20,580
I mean, usually, you were like cool tone with icy touch. But today, you're like warm tone.

600
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:23,520
Do you hate cool guys?

601
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:27,750
- Huh? 
 - How about you?

602
00:43:35,430 --> 00:43:38,980
Where's this little girl walking around in the middle of the night?

603
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:44,130
I called Prince Comics. She's at the comic book store.

604
00:43:44,130 --> 00:43:49,830
Really? That comic book store.

605
00:43:49,830 --> 00:43:54,510
But... What didn't she tell me?

606
00:43:54,510 --> 00:43:56,150
Did she cause an accident that we don't know about?

607
00:43:56,150 --> 00:43:59,730
There's no accident Ju Gyeong would've caused.

608
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:04,440
By any chance, was she ridiculed at school for being ugly...?  No, she probably wasn't.

609
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:07,340
Ugly? What do you mean ugly? Our Ju Gyeong? She's nice and pretty.

610
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:11,040
You're right, because she took after you.

611
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:16,270
Weirdly, that makes me feel bad.

612
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:37,240
- What? 
 - I think I stepped on something weird.

613
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:39,950
- Isn't it an worm? 
 - It's nothing.

614
00:44:39,950 --> 00:44:43,570
- It's a branch. 
- No, it's not.

615
00:44:43,570 --> 00:44:45,530
I think it's a worm.

616
00:44:45,530 --> 00:44:48,880
No, it's not. It's a branch.

617
00:44:50,290 --> 00:44:56,200
Ah! It's a worm! I really hate worms!

618
00:44:58,370 --> 00:45:01,390
Stay still. I'll help you.

619
00:45:13,290 --> 00:45:16,070
You're going to fall. Sit down.

620
00:45:16,890 --> 00:45:19,770
Can I do that?

621
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:32,780
I was telling you to sit there.

622
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,840
Huh?

623
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:40,490
No, it's fine. There you go.

624
00:45:40,490 --> 00:45:43,740
Oh, thank you.

625
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:51,500
Then, be careful on your way home.

626
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:53,740
Wait!

627
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:21,360
Study hard.

628
00:46:22,930 --> 00:46:24,750
Good night.

629
00:46:51,950 --> 00:46:55,580
Hey! Why are you coming so late? Don't you need to talk to your mom?

630
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:58,510
Im Ju Gyeong!

631
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:22,490
What should I do?

632
00:47:24,490 --> 00:47:27,330
My heart is about to explode.

633
00:47:27,330 --> 00:47:30,260
♫  You will also  ♫

634
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:33,350
♫  Get to like me.  ♫

635
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:37,240
♫  I know love is so crazy  ♫

636
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:41,150
♫  At the end, I'll become happy  ♫

637
00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:45,070
♫  You'll also become watching me all the time  ♫

638
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:47,390
♫  We're shining...  ♫

639
00:47:47,390 --> 00:47:50,620
Do you want to go on a date with me?

640
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:52,480
Let's go on a date! Do you want to go on a date?

641
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:55,510
Do you want to go to watch a movie with me? Let's go to watch a movie!

642
00:47:55,510 --> 00:47:58,950
Shall we go eat? Do you want to go eat?

643
00:47:59,970 --> 00:48:04,480
Didn't you know that your father had been contemplating this these days?

644
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:07,730
Never mind that you couldn't beat Su Ho! What's with ranking 12th among all 11th grade students of your school?

645
00:48:07,730 --> 00:48:11,290
You've never been pushed out of the top ten!

646
00:48:12,950 --> 00:48:16,680
By any chance, do you have a boyfriend?

647
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:19,760
No... You're distracted by something else—

648
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:22,230
Mom, please!

649
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:25,960
Su Jin! Su Jin!

650
00:48:26,890 --> 00:48:30,760
No matter how it is, to do that to a girl's face...

651
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:52,580
 Date places in Saebom-Ro, the best aioli pasta and the best hand drip coffee that girls like. 

652
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:54,540
 Date places that girls like, hidden gems in Saebom-Ro with delicious food. 

653
00:48:54,540 --> 00:48:56,120
 Introducing the TOP 8 delicious restaurants in Saebom-Ro that girls like.  

654
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:57,960
 I think it's always exciting to plan a date. What can I do to look my absolute best? 

655
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:28,830
- Why did you follow me? 
 - Is something wrong?

656
00:49:30,770 --> 00:49:32,410
What do you mean?

657
00:49:32,930 --> 00:49:34,740
Did you get hit?

658
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:38,050
Is he still doing that to you?

659
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:41,510
You knew about everything?

660
00:49:41,510 --> 00:49:43,620
How could I not know?

661
00:49:46,730 --> 00:49:50,970
You're so annoying. You don't know anything.

662
00:49:50,970 --> 00:49:53,630
But I'm always struggling to do better than you.  I can't take it any more!

663
00:49:53,630 --> 00:49:55,940
It pisses me off! Everything pisses me off!

664
00:49:55,940 --> 00:49:59,620
It pisses me off that I'm always compared to you.

665
00:50:00,830 --> 00:50:03,330
I really don't think I can do this anymore.

666
00:50:03,330 --> 00:50:08,100
Why do you have to go to the same school as me? Why don't you just transfer!

667
00:51:03,270 --> 00:51:05,760
 I have someone that I like. 

668
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:46,560
Hey. Just forget what I said earlier.

669
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:48,620
Just make sure you forget it, okay?

670
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:52,180
- Does he hit you often? 
 - No.

671
00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:54,240
If he did, I would have already reported it.

672
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:58,050
Don't whine about it by yourself, but ask me for help if you need it.

673
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:02,470
Wow, you must think of me as a close friend, huh?

674
00:52:02,470 --> 00:52:04,270
Of course, you're a friend.

675
00:52:05,270 --> 00:52:09,790
Are my eyes really red? Can you tell that I cried?

676
00:52:12,850 --> 00:52:15,650
- Kind of. 
 - Let me borrow this.

677
00:52:36,550 --> 00:52:38,680
Now, let's begin class time.

678
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:40,530
Yes!

679
00:52:40,530 --> 00:52:45,570
We'll start today's lesson by reviewing material for the September assessment exam.

680
00:52:45,650 --> 00:52:48,850
I've selected some important practice problems for you to work on,

681
00:52:48,850 --> 00:52:51,550
so go ahead and take a look at the handouts and start working on the problems.

682
00:52:51,570 --> 00:52:53,550
Okay.

683
00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:02,500
Since we learned about derivatives today, please review that topic.

684
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:05,860
And next week, we will be utilizing what we learned about derivatives today. See you next week.

685
00:53:05,860 --> 00:53:09,570
Okay, thank you.

686
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:15,660
Your eyes seem to be okay now.

687
00:53:16,850 --> 00:53:19,870
Wow, I thought we were friends. So cold-hearted...

688
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:25,180
She already left.

689
00:53:25,180 --> 00:53:28,570
Hey. Can I keep this?

690
00:53:31,650 --> 00:53:33,540
Bye.

691
00:53:46,730 --> 00:53:51,500
That's right. My feelings weren't that serious, anyway.

692
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:54,550
Any girl would swoon over a face like that.

693
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:59,630
I was just fan-girling over Lee Su Ho.

694
00:53:59,630 --> 00:54:03,820
People tend to get sad when their favorite celebrity has a dating scandal, too.

695
00:54:03,820 --> 00:54:06,960
And if you stop liking them, you can leave the fandom.

696
00:54:32,260 --> 00:54:34,950
If you had feelings for someone else, you should have told me from the start.

697
00:54:34,950 --> 00:54:36,710
Instead of leading me on!

698
00:54:36,710 --> 00:54:38,970
Why did you give me that hair pin? And telling me to sit on your shoulders?

699
00:54:38,970 --> 00:54:41,130
You're such a bad man.

700
00:54:41,130 --> 00:54:45,880
Lee Su Ho, I'm going to crush you!

701
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:47,830
Hey, Im Ju Bal.

702
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:51,410
Darn it!

703
00:54:51,410 --> 00:54:53,860
Lee Su Ho, just wait until I get my hands on you!

704
00:55:02,870 --> 00:55:05,150
Manager Im, did you enjoy your business trip?

705
00:55:05,150 --> 00:55:08,300
Yes, I'm back.

706
00:55:11,210 --> 00:55:13,160
What's this?

707
00:55:20,290 --> 00:55:22,270
 Thank you. 

708
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:25,970
This won't do.

709
00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:48,410
 Im Hui Gyeong 

710
00:55:51,820 --> 00:55:54,730
-  Hello? 
 - What are you doing?

711
00:55:54,730 --> 00:55:57,010
I was sleeping.

712
00:55:57,010 --> 00:55:59,190
Did I wake you up?

713
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:02,660
How was your business trip?

714
00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:04,760
Were you waiting for me to get back?

715
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:07,850
I guess not?

716
00:56:09,450 --> 00:56:12,850
- I miss you. 
 - Are you still out?

717
00:56:12,890 --> 00:56:15,160
Do you mind opening your window?

718
00:56:28,010 --> 00:56:30,640
You won't even show me your face?

719
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:34,050
He didn't even fall for my dreamy eyes.

720
00:56:48,390 --> 00:56:50,320
How did you get here—

721
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:54,450
Why did you send me those flower petals?

722
00:56:56,020 --> 00:56:58,200
Were you trying to get me out of your head?

723
00:56:59,490 --> 00:57:01,590
You don't want to see me anymore?

724
00:57:03,950 --> 00:57:06,010
Should we stop seeing each other?

725
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:12,030
No!

726
00:57:28,890 --> 00:57:32,270
 Im Ju Gyeong's spot. 
 Sitting without permission will cause hair to grow on your butt! 

727
00:57:35,670 --> 00:57:37,970
 Can you meet me at Prince Comics? 

728
00:57:38,950 --> 00:57:41,010
Is something wrong?

729
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:45,000
Why are there so many of these?

730
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:52,050
Are you a ghost or something?

731
00:57:52,050 --> 00:57:54,060
I'm not in the mood to joke around.

732
00:57:54,060 --> 00:57:55,690
Are you feeling okay?

733
00:57:55,690 --> 00:57:57,040
If you're not feeling well, you should've said so before coming here.

734
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:59,070
I'm not sick.

735
00:57:59,070 --> 00:58:02,570
We're here to pick out Go Woon's birthday present. I couldn't miss that.

736
00:58:02,570 --> 00:58:04,540
Did you get rejected by Ryu Hyeong Jin?

737
00:58:04,540 --> 00:58:06,340
- No, I didn't! 
 - Ah, so you did!

738
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:07,900
No, I didn't!

739
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:11,850
He wanted me to see him so badly, he sent me tickets for the game.

740
00:58:11,850 --> 00:58:15,640
Really? But your face just screams "rejection."

741
00:58:16,230 --> 00:58:17,740
Let's go.

742
00:58:19,370 --> 00:58:22,240
I-It's because I couldn't sleep!

743
00:58:22,730 --> 00:58:25,140
Wow, he's like a total psychic.

744
00:58:33,270 --> 00:58:35,200
Hello?

745
00:58:35,820 --> 00:58:37,440
Are you home?

746
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:39,990
No, I'm at a department store.

747
00:58:39,990 --> 00:58:41,520
Why?

748
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:43,630
Did you go by yourself?

749
00:58:43,630 --> 00:58:45,380
 Im Ju Gyeong! 

750
00:58:46,750 --> 00:58:47,990
Hurry up!

751
00:58:47,990 --> 00:58:50,390
Are you with Han Seo Jun?

752
00:58:51,310 --> 00:58:56,020
It's kind of cramped here, so I'll call you back later.

753
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:10,680
Smelling the makeup makes me feel better.

754
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:12,730
- Are you buying her some makeup? 
 - Yes.

755
00:59:12,730 --> 00:59:14,540
She said there will be a show at the academy soon.

756
00:59:14,540 --> 00:59:16,640
She's practicing stage make up.

757
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:19,010
- I heard Go Woon attends a musical academy.
 - Yeah.

758
00:59:19,010 --> 00:59:22,610
How can you both sing so well?

759
00:59:22,610 --> 00:59:24,590
You've never heard me sing.

760
00:59:24,590 --> 00:59:28,540
I heard you were an idol trainee and you sing really well.

761
00:59:28,540 --> 00:59:31,280
But why aren't you preparing to become a singer anymore?

762
00:59:32,820 --> 00:59:34,780
What's so great about being a celebrity?

763
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:36,920
Just pick me something.

764
00:59:38,340 --> 00:59:45,670
For stage make up, it would be nice to get a color shadow with good pigmentation or a lip lacquer that's smudge-proof.

765
00:59:45,670 --> 00:59:49,900
This must be a new tint. I wonder if it'll be long-lasting.

766
00:59:54,930 --> 00:59:57,050
I can't really tell over my lipstick.

767
00:59:57,050 --> 00:59:58,260
Do you want to try?

768
00:59:58,260 --> 01:00:00,910
No. You tried it on your lips.

769
01:00:00,910 --> 01:00:02,680
It's a sample. Come here.

770
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:05,150
- No.
 - Come on.

771
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:14,950
The color is nice.

772
01:00:14,950 --> 01:00:16,970
Do you want to get this one?

773
01:00:18,930 --> 01:00:20,600
- Hey, Han Seo Jun! 
 - Huh?

774
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:22,300
This one.

775
01:00:23,060 --> 01:00:26,370
L-let's get this one.

776
01:00:29,380 --> 01:00:31,860
D-do we go that way?

777
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:40,730
- Her? 
 - Ah, it’s cold.

778
01:00:40,730 --> 01:00:42,880
Me?

779
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:45,540
No way.

780
01:00:45,540 --> 01:00:48,560
 Door is opening. 

781
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:02,710
Get away. Get away. You'll get make up on you.

782
01:01:03,750 --> 01:01:05,210
 The capacity is exceeded. 

783
01:01:05,210 --> 01:01:06,910
- I told you to lose weight.
 - I'm sorry.

784
01:01:06,910 --> 01:01:10,000
Everybody hold your breath. Two, three!

785
01:01:11,950 --> 01:01:14,650
 The capacity is exceeded. 

786
01:01:14,650 --> 01:01:16,370
I told you not to eat too much for lunch.

787
01:01:16,370 --> 01:01:20,100
- Let's get on the next one. 
- Get off. Get off. Quickly. Quickly.

788
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:21,670
Darn.

789
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:40,310
- What are you doing here?
 - Let's go.

790
01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:45,670
Where are you going? We're not on the first floor yet.

791
01:01:48,370 --> 01:01:50,310
Excuse me ...

792
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:56,920
Let's go.

793
01:01:59,230 --> 01:02:01,600
What kind of bother is this?

794
01:02:20,610 --> 01:02:22,310
What's happening?

795
01:02:24,110 --> 01:02:27,340
Look at that! I think the elevator is stuck.

796
01:02:32,930 --> 01:02:36,210
 Under maintenance 

797
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:40,500
Why don't you let go now?

798
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:42,700
If you let go first.

799
01:02:43,620 --> 01:02:45,640
- Why are you here?
 - To shop.

800
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:48,890
- You? Shopping? 
 - Can't I shop?

801
01:02:48,890 --> 01:02:51,380
If you came to shop, then go shop.

802
01:02:51,380 --> 01:02:54,970
- Why are you here holding on to her? 
 - I'm shopping with her.

803
01:02:54,970 --> 01:02:58,790
Let go. I said let go.

804
01:02:58,790 --> 01:03:01,710
That damnable shopping, shopping!

805
01:03:04,180 --> 01:03:06,220
What's wrong? Are you feeling okay?

806
01:03:06,220 --> 01:03:10,110
Are you scared? They'll open it soon.

807
01:03:10,110 --> 01:03:11,260
Hang on a little more.

808
01:03:11,260 --> 01:03:15,120
No, no. I can't hold it.

809
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:18,110
I can't hold it anymore!

810
01:03:18,110 --> 01:03:19,710
Why did you get me a large coffee?

811
01:03:19,710 --> 01:03:24,960
You played with a perfectly fine elevator door and broke it!

812
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:26,860
What do I do!

813
01:03:26,860 --> 01:03:30,490
Hello! Hello! When are you going to open this?

814
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:36,060
Are you nuts?!

815
01:03:38,330 --> 01:03:40,150
Hurry. Hurry.

816
01:03:40,150 --> 01:03:42,080
Please!

817
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:45,220
Are you okay? We'll open it soon.

818
01:03:45,220 --> 01:03:48,100
Please don't move. Don't move.

819
01:03:51,510 --> 01:03:53,610
Ah, I'm getting out!

820
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:08,650
This is so embarrassing! How can I face Lee Su Ho again? Die, I should die!

821
01:04:13,610 --> 01:04:16,510
They didn't say it was going to snow.

822
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:40,280
Hi, Pretty.

823
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:43,200
- How did you...? 
 - Wow!

824
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:45,370
This is destiny.

825
01:04:47,950 --> 01:04:53,910
 There are some people who don't know what they really want, 

826
01:04:53,910 --> 01:04:56,930
 and some others who are hesitating even though they know what they want. 

827
01:04:58,010 --> 01:05:03,270
 But this thing called opportunity is suddenly coming to you like an unpredicted shower, 

828
01:05:03,270 --> 01:05:06,540
 so only the people who are prepared can grasp it. 

829
01:05:25,300 --> 01:05:27,150
- Sorry. 
 - Sorry.

830
01:05:27,150 --> 01:05:29,060
♫   Real, real, real.  ♫

831
01:05:29,060 --> 01:05:32,430
Friend! It's nice to see you here.

832
01:05:32,430 --> 01:05:34,490
Why are you here?

833
01:05:34,490 --> 01:05:36,940
I came to a baseball game to watch baseball. Would I be here to watch soccer?

834
01:05:36,940 --> 01:05:38,700
I thought you didn't like baseball.

835
01:05:38,700 --> 01:05:39,810
I came to like it.

836
01:05:39,810 --> 01:05:41,820
- Since when?
 - Since recently?

837
01:05:41,820 --> 01:05:44,210
Really? High school baseball?

838
01:05:44,210 --> 01:05:47,890
Is major league the only baseball game? You're insulting high school baseball.

839
01:05:47,890 --> 01:05:50,870
♫  I will love you truly!  ♫

840
01:05:53,810 --> 01:05:55,740
It's going to be a fun game.

841
01:05:55,740 --> 01:05:57,480
Enjoy the game.

842
01:05:57,480 --> 01:06:02,410
 Ryu Hyeong Jin is entering. Wow, his glare is fierce. 

843
01:06:02,410 --> 01:06:05,590
 His appearance just overpowers the whole stadium. 

844
01:06:05,590 --> 01:06:08,740
 He looks pretty good today. 

845
01:06:08,740 --> 01:06:11,780
 He is the main person to watch in today's game. The monster pitcher from Seonil High School, Ryu Hyeong Jin! 

846
01:06:11,780 --> 01:06:13,030
Have you seen Ju Gyeong?

847
01:06:13,030 --> 01:06:15,410
I saw her go out earlier.

848
01:06:15,410 --> 01:06:18,660
Gosh, this little brat is going out instead of studying over the weekend.

849
01:06:18,660 --> 01:06:20,340
What good is scolding her all the time?

850
01:06:20,340 --> 01:06:23,570
 This is the start of a tough game. 

851
01:06:29,890 --> 01:06:33,310
Ryu Hyeong Jin! Ryu Hyeong Jin!

852
01:06:33,310 --> 01:06:35,900
Ryu Hyeong Jin!

853
01:06:37,020 --> 01:06:38,120
 Strike! 

854
01:06:38,120 --> 01:06:41,430
I heard that a major league scouter is here to see Ryu Hyeong Jin today.

855
01:06:41,430 --> 01:06:45,580
Awesome. Does that mean if he wins today, he'll fly to the US?

856
01:06:45,580 --> 01:06:46,990
He's flying.

857
01:06:46,990 --> 01:06:49,470
Monster pitcher Ryu Hyeong Jin!

858
01:06:49,470 --> 01:06:52,070
Monster pitcher Ryu Hyeong Jin!

859
01:06:52,070 --> 01:06:54,560
Monster pitcher Ryu Hyeong Jin!

860
01:06:54,560 --> 01:06:58,370
Monster pitcher Ryu Hyeong Jin!

861
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:04,920
 He's known to always keep body balance to maintain the best fastball.  

862
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:06,470
Where have you been?

863
01:07:06,470 --> 01:07:11,110
- To buy a selfie stick. 
 -  Isn't it touching to know that his mind is already set like a pro? 

864
01:07:11,110 --> 01:07:14,130
 They say you cannot beat a genius who works hard. 

865
01:07:14,130 --> 01:07:17,010
He's already no joke.

866
01:07:17,010 --> 01:07:18,470
He'll be wanted everywhere.

867
01:07:18,470 --> 01:07:21,140
 Let's hope he doesn't make a mistake like last time. 

868
01:07:21,140 --> 01:07:23,170
How can a baseball player be so good looking?

869
01:07:23,170 --> 01:07:25,550
 And does his best today. 

870
01:07:26,370 --> 01:07:29,630
He confessed to me.

871
01:07:29,630 --> 01:07:32,480
- Why would he?
 - It's for real.

872
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:34,540
I even dumped him.

873
01:07:34,540 --> 01:07:37,270
Unbelievable. Simply unbelievable.

874
01:07:43,250 --> 01:07:47,690
 I will send you the baseball by courier for sure. 

875
01:07:47,690 --> 01:07:48,950
 I'm sorry. 

876
01:07:48,950 --> 01:07:51,240
 What do you mean? 

877
01:07:51,240 --> 01:07:54,710
 I have someone that I like. 

878
01:07:59,460 --> 01:08:02,350
 Does he like you back? 

879
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:12,440
 You said it's as hard as a perfect game. 

880
01:08:21,280 --> 01:08:24,650
 Ryu Hyeong Jin's perfect finish! 

881
01:08:24,650 --> 01:08:25,840
Wow!

882
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:28,690
 He never disappoints! 

883
01:08:28,690 --> 01:08:32,530
 Thanks to his awesome performance, the high school baseball finals 

884
01:08:32,530 --> 01:08:36,000
 winner is Seonil High School! 

885
01:08:38,510 --> 01:08:40,700
Ryu Hyeong Jin!

886
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:44,210
Monster pitcher Ryu Hyeong Jin!

887
01:08:44,210 --> 01:08:47,200
Monster pitcher Ryu Hyeong Jin!

888
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:51,040
Monster pitcher Ryu Hyeong Jin!

889
01:08:51,910 --> 01:08:53,690
Did you have fun?

890
01:08:55,530 --> 01:08:56,820
It was fun.

891
01:08:56,820 --> 01:08:59,750
Yeah? It wasn't for me.

892
01:08:59,750 --> 01:09:04,610
I came just in case Im Ju Gyeong came. I was nervous.

893
01:09:04,610 --> 01:09:09,910
That's why I came, but you came to watch baseball.

894
01:09:10,710 --> 01:09:12,600
Right?

895
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:15,740
Yes, that's right.

896
01:09:17,460 --> 01:09:21,480
Why ask twice? I'm going.

897
01:09:23,910 --> 01:09:27,400
Why Im Ju Gyeong, you jerk?

898
01:09:29,580 --> 01:09:31,640
Hey, Lee Su Ho!

899
01:09:39,850 --> 01:09:44,930
Fine. To be honest, I came because I like Im Ju Gyeong, not baseball.

900
01:09:48,340 --> 01:09:51,310
Is there a reason I can't do that?

901
01:10:04,580 --> 01:10:11,500


902
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:20,780

 Are you guys announcing your relationship by wearing matching clothes today? 

908

 You should date! You should date! You should date!

 You have someone you like.

 Why did you avoid me today? 

911
01:10:55,910 --> 01:10:59,010

 I don't know why it had to be her either!
