00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:37,996
You didn't have to walk me home.

3
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:40,832
Well, it was a proper date after all.

4
00:00:41,624 --> 00:00:43,168
I wouldn't walk a friend home.

5
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:49,090
You live too close to the bus stop.

6
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:53,011
What are you talking about?
My house is far from the bus stop.

7
00:00:53,094 --> 00:00:54,929
No, it's not. It was a very short walk.

8
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:57,724
We're here.

9
00:00:58,683 --> 00:00:59,642
Get home safe.

Ju-kyung.

11
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:04,689
Yes?

12
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:08,068
I'm…

13
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:11,237
going to use my wish.

-Still…

17
00:02:09,587 --> 00:02:10,588
we have some dates left.

18
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:14,467
Good night.

19
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:56,259
Do you still have feelings for Ju-kyung?

20
00:02:57,802 --> 00:02:59,053
Did you tell her how you feel?

21
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:01,222
No.

22
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:03,683
I'm dating her.

23
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:07,520
I know that's not true.

24
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:10,815
What do you know?

25
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:17,822
I told you I met Ju-kyung yesterday.

26
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:21,868
Exactly. Why did it have to be yesterday?

27
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:26,623
-The first snow fell.
-What are you saying?

28
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:28,499
So it's not true, right?

29
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:31,961
Guess I made you nervous.

30
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:38,259
-I'm not nervous.
-Whatever, you punk.

31
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:16,005
So he hugged her?

32
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:21,678
But we broke up.

33
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:24,430
I didn't miss you.

34
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,139
Hey, you're up.

35
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:08,391
Yes.

36
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:11,352
Who gave you these flowers?
You got a new boyfriend?

37
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:13,313
No, it's not like that.

38
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:17,275
I brought these out from your room.
I didn't want them to wither.

39
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:19,861
I forgot about them.

40
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:28,661
Flowers are so pretty
when they are in a vase,

41
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:31,497
but pitiable when they wilt
without anyone to look at them.

42
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:46,637
Are you super busy?

43
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:48,723
I'm in your company building.

44
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:51,309
Can I see you after practice?

45
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,394
I'll be waiting in the lobby.

Seo-jun.

49
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:24,008
You should've left when I didn't reply,
and not waited for hours.

50
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:25,051
Well…

51
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:27,386
Actually…

52
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,013
Yes, actually what?

53
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,557
Did you have dinner?

54
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,559
Do you want to get dinner with me?

55
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:36,437
Are you here to take me out?
I'm quite busy today.

56
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:38,397
I have something to say.

57
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,566
Save that for some other time.

58
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:44,028
I'm too busy today to go out on a date,

59
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:46,072
so this will make it even.

60

Seo-jun…

61
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:09,554
Did you know?

62
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:13,307
Soo-ho is going back to the States
on a red-eye tonight.

63
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:15,393
-What?
-What with his dad waking up,

64
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:18,729
he said he only came in briefly
to take care of some things.

65
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:21,482
You should hurry
if you want to say goodbye.

66
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:25,319
Hey, don't just stand there.

67
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:27,029
Hurry along.

68
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:28,990
You don't want to miss him.

69
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:34,162
Go on.

70
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:35,079
Go.

71
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:38,249
Goodbye.

72
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:10,114
The door is closing.

73
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,025
What's this?

74
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:48,402
It's unlike you to study so hard.

75
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:49,862
Blow it out.

76
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,948
I'm not going to sing for you.

77
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:03,876
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you

78
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,253
You said you wouldn't sing.

79
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:10,424
Hey, Ju-kyung.

80
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:12,343
What?

81
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:14,887
What number will you pick
if you don't know the answer?

82
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:17,515
Number three?

83
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:20,309
Then I should guess all numbers
other than three.

84
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:21,978
Wait.

85
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:24,313
Here.

86
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:27,567
Don't get nervous and do well.

87
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:28,609
Thank you.

88
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:35,408
Here. Good luck to you too.

89
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:37,159
Thanks.

2021 COLLEGE SCHOLASTIC ABILITY TEST

00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:47,003
I'm taking it.

92
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:48,462
One, two, three!

93
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:51,424
-You look so awkward.
-Guys, it looks too gloomy.

94
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:52,883
-Act natural.
-Okay.

95
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:54,552
-Look cute.
-Bye, Saebom High.

96
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:56,637
-One, two, three!
-Farewell, Saebom High!

97
00:09:57,638 --> 00:09:58,848
Hey, Ju-kyung!

98
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:00,433
How could you exclude me?

99
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:03,102
-Go to your class.
-Don't you know when not to butt in?

100
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:04,437
Okay, Seo-jun. I got you.

101
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,938
I'll take pictures of you two.

102
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:07,231
-Come stand here.
-Go on.

103
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:09,942
-Get ready.
-You should've come sooner.

104
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:11,986
-Smile.
-Try to look friendly.

105
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:14,488
-Look friendlier.
-One, two, three!

106
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:15,406
Jeez.

107
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:18,951
-Come on.
-Do it right this time.

108
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:22,038
-You closed your eyes.
-Hey, do it right.

109
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:25,166
Okay, one, two, three!

110
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:49,398
Soo-ho is going back to the States
on a red-eye tonight.

111
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:20,221
Taxi!

112
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:23,140
Taxi!

113
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:29,522
Darn it.

114
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,034
Hey, Lee Soo-ho!

115
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:45,621
Did you leave already?

116
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:48,249
You bastard!

117
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:51,669
Why did you come back
if you were going to just take off?

118
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:54,088
Why did you even follow me around?

119
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:02,096
Ju-kyung.

120
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:07,560
Don't leave.

121
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:18,988
Don't leave!

122
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:22,450
I'm not going to let you go,
so please don't go.

123
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:26,662
I'm not

124
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:28,456
going anywhere.

125
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:31,375
Don't you ever leave.

126
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:36,505
Stop crying, okay?

127
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,435
Don't go.

128
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:50,644
I'm not going.

129
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:55,816
I tried to pretend I was fine,

130
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:58,736
but I was so nervous
I thought I'd go insane.

131
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:00,863
Over what?

132
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:02,031
I was worried

133
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:04,950
you might refuse to see me.

134
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:06,118
You're lying.

135
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:08,787
I mean it.

136
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:12,124
But you were going to leave.

137
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,084
What are you talking about?

138
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:16,504
I heard you were going back
to the States tonight.

139
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:17,922
Why would I?

140
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:19,882
What's that suitcase for then?

141
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:22,176
I was unpacking earlier.

142
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:24,803
What? Seo-jun said you were going back…

143
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:27,932
Seo-jun said that?

144
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:35,231
Well…

145
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,233
So you ran over here
thinking I was leaving?

146
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:40,778
-No, it's not like that.
-To make me stay?

147
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,364
I said it's not like that.

148
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:44,532
Ju-kyung.

149
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:45,491
Ju-kyung!

150
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:52,248
-Why are you running away?
-I'm not running…

151
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:53,290
Aren't you here to see me?

152
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:54,792
I better go home.

153
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:57,586
I have a very important event at home.

154
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:58,629
It's not that way.

155
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:03,968
I'll take you home.

156
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:10,474
Do you hate me?

157
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,144
Are you not going to look at me?

158
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:15,604
You were going to come back.

159
00:14:16,855 --> 00:14:18,190
You came back.

160
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,820
Why did you do that then?

161
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:25,155
I thought waiting…

162
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:29,159
would be too hard on you.

163
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:32,079
Waiting was nothing…

164
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,416
compared to what you made me go through.

165
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,013
It was the same for me.

166
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:52,892
It was excruciating.

167
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:56,854
That's why…

168
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:01,358
I'd been looking for ways to come back.

169
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:03,819
Even if my dad hadn't woken up,

170
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:08,407
I would have come back for you.

171
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:10,868
What if I had forgotten about you?

172
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:12,745
I'd chase after you then.

173
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:16,582
What if I still didn't want you back?

174
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:18,709
I would've cried and begged,

175
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:21,378
or won you over with my charms.

176
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:24,840
Ju-kyung.

177
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:28,302
Please look at me.

178
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:32,097
I gave you such a hard time.

179
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:36,393
I'm sorry.

180
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:38,896
There's no need for that.

181
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:43,108
I understand how you felt.

182
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:45,361
I get it.

183
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:47,529
But seeing your face

184
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:51,116
reminds me of how sad I was.

185
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,826
I'm sorry I hurt you.

186
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,411
I'm sure you were hurting too.

187
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:58,332
How hard it must have been for you
so far away from home.

188
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:00,709
With no other family members,

189
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:05,297
you must have struggled alone
at the hospital.

190
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:07,132
How painful it must have been for you.

191
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:11,261
I was worried and I wanted
to be there for you right away.

192
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:17,184
No 18-year-olds have that kind of money.

193
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:28,320
We were too young.

194
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:30,364
Right?

195
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:31,490
Yes.

196
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:34,159
Don't cry.

197
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:36,704
Come here.

198
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:44,336
I was surprised to find out
they were dating,

199
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,463
so I'm amazed to hear
they're getting married.

200
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:51,218
Who'd hold up against Hee-kyung
if not someone like Mr. Han?

201
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:02,062
-Why are you staring at me like that?
-What?

202
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:03,981
Just because.

203
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:06,692
You've changed a lot.

204
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,153
You even drive now.

205
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:17,870
I've kept mine too.

206
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:20,330
You didn't throw it away.

207
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:25,961
It's the same.

208
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:28,297
What is?

209
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,132
We haven't changed at all

210
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:32,509
from the past.

211
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:37,389
When in the past?

212
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:39,016
When you were a crybaby?

213
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:42,061
You keep calling me that
when I just cried once.

214
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:43,729
But you are a crybaby.

215
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:48,025
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

216
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:51,028
If I hadn't found the writing,
I wouldn't have known.

217
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:52,863
I was saving it for a special day,

218
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:54,865
but I never got to tell you.

219
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:57,409
You should have just told me.

220
00:17:58,327 --> 00:17:59,369
Back when we were kids,

221
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:01,455
I had a crush on you.

222
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:06,001
I used to wait for you at the comics shop.

223
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:09,755
I guess the feeling was mutual,

224
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:12,800
seeing how you remember me
after all this time.

225
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:14,968
It wasn't.

226
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:18,639
I just remember you as a crybaby
from the comics shop.

227
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:21,266
That's too bad.

228
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:23,435
It was one-sided then.

229
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:28,148
How have you been feeling? Are you better?

230
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:29,733
What are you talking about?

231
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:32,569
Was I ever not feeling well?

232
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:35,197
You even went to the ER.
How's your constipation?

233
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:38,575
Right. That's better now.

234
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:41,161
You need to exercise regularly
and eat a lot of fiber.

235
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:43,622
You should also take probiotics,
drink lots of water,

236
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:45,165
and set up a regular lifestyle--

237
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:48,210
Hey, do you really have to bring that up
at this moment?

238
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:50,045
It's embarrassing.

239
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,506
I've been having some trouble
from the recent stress,

240
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:55,134
but my bowel movements
are usually more than fine.

241
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:58,053
Stop the car.

242
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,805
I'll walk home for the exercise.

243
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:02,349
You can stop right there.

244
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:03,642
Pull over.

245
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:16,798
-Hey.
-Are you heading home?

246
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:19,551
Yes, I am.

247
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:21,887
-Aren't you feeling tired?
-Not at all.

248
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,889
I shouldn't call you while you're driving.

249
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:25,349
You could call me from home.

250
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:27,893
No, it's all right.

251
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:31,813
I want to hear your voice.

252
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:37,444
What are you doing tomorrow?

253
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:40,405
Why do you ask?

254
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:42,074
So I can come see you.

255
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:44,576
It feels like a dream

256
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:47,371
to be able to see you tomorrow again.

257
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:49,581
I feel the same way.

258
00:20:57,464 --> 00:21:01,343
PRINCE COMICS

259
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:06,265
When we get to the refrain,

260
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:08,225
-the drums need to make an impact.
-Right.

261
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:10,560
-Like an explosive sound?
-Exactly.

262
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:12,104
And the guitar here.

263
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:14,273
-Don't keep playing a D.
-Should I jump ahead?

264
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:16,191
-Move on right away?
-That's it. Move on.

265
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:19,653
Why did you have to come out right then?

266
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:22,406
You stole my moment.

267
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:26,576
-What do you mean?
-Whatever.

268
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:31,581
It was my last chance.

269
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,334
To do what I couldn't do two years ago.

270
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:37,254
To tell her how I feel and get rejected.

271
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:40,632
I'm finally doing it now.

272
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:09,494
What brings you here?

273
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:19,504
I'm not busy today, so I'll hear you out.

274
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:24,092
I don't know how to say this…

275
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:25,427
What do you mean?

276
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:28,972
It's written all over your face.

277
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:31,933
You've always been an open book.

278
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:34,394
I have nothing to say

279
00:22:35,353 --> 00:22:37,564
except thank you and sorry.

280
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,983
There's nothing to be sorry about.

281
00:22:41,234 --> 00:22:42,402
I already knew…

282
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:45,030
that you were never over Soo-ho.

283
00:22:46,948 --> 00:22:48,575
So you don't have to feel sorry.

284
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:52,120
I knew there was no place
for me in your heart.

285
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:54,372
I was just reaching for it.

286
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:57,084
I'm sorry.

287
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:58,460
I'm sorry for confusing you

288
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:01,296
by telling you how I feel.

289
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:07,010
It would be cool if I felt that way,
but that's nonsense.

290
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:09,471
I should at least get to try, right?

291
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:14,059
Your brother Ju-young once told me

292
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:17,145
that it's easier to let go
after getting rejected.

293
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:20,065
Don't you worry.

294
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:21,983
I'm so busy preparing for my debut

295
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:24,277
that I won't be able to
think about you for long.

296
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:25,821
I'll get over you in no time.

297
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:30,408
I'm going to leave
if you keep looking at me like that.

298
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:33,703
-I'm getting up.
-Okay, I get it. Let's eat.

299
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:35,872
-It's on me.
-Okay.

300
00:23:50,345 --> 00:23:51,429
Let's go.

301
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,852
Are you using tricks from the first round?

302
00:23:57,686 --> 00:23:59,771
-Please let go.
-I'll bet all my aroma candles

303
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:01,606
on your hand having filthy intentions.

304
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:02,607
What will you bet?

305
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:05,068
What are you two doing?

306
00:24:06,736 --> 00:24:07,946
What are you doing all dressed up?

307
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:11,116
I'm practicing giving Hee-kyung
away for tomorrow.

308
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:14,244
What are you talking about?
They'll be walking in together.

309
00:24:14,327 --> 00:24:15,829
-Everyone, come eat!
-What?

310
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:17,539
But why?

311
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:19,499
I hear it's popular these days.

312
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:20,876
Soo-ho, you're here again?

313
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:22,169
Did you sleep in again?

314
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:24,629
You've been coming
to our place for a month now.

315
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:27,966
If you're going to keep that up,
why don't you just marry her?

316
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:31,219
Why don't you just shut your trap?

317
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:33,221
It'd be nice to get them married off soon.

318
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:35,640
I can't give her up that easily.

319
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:37,434
What time should I pick you up later?

320
00:24:37,517 --> 00:24:39,477
It's okay, you're tired. Don't pick me up.

321
00:24:40,103 --> 00:24:43,148
-It's no trouble for me.
- Soo-ho is really awesome.

322
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:47,652
I'm so jealous.
You're unemployed but affluent.

323
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:49,696
Why don't you focus on
getting into college?

324
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:53,325
I studied until early in the morning.
I'm more desperate than anyone else.

325
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:55,493
Is Go-un going to wait for you
until you get in?

326
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:57,537
Don't you dare jinx a CSAT retaker.

327
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:58,997
What? Are you talking back?

328
00:25:00,957 --> 00:25:03,168
He keeps acting like
a brother-in-law to him.

329
00:25:03,251 --> 00:25:04,711
-Just eat your meal.
-Okay.

330
00:25:07,422 --> 00:25:09,507
MAKEUP CONCEPT PROPOSAL
FOR MOVE ENTERTAINMENT'S NEW BOY BAND

331
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:10,675
ELIGIBILITY: ALL EMPLOYEES

332
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:14,471
A makeup concept proposal
for the new boy band?

333
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:21,436
Che-ni, the filming's being delayed.

334
00:25:22,312 --> 00:25:23,563
-Please wait here.
-Sure.

335
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:25,857
Hold on. Hello?

336
00:25:28,568 --> 00:25:31,613
Ju-kyung, are you dating Seo-jun?

337
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:33,907
No, I'm not.

338
00:25:34,991 --> 00:25:37,661
Thought so.
He wouldn't if he had working eyes.

339
00:25:38,286 --> 00:25:39,120
Right.

340
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:40,622
Seo-jun does have working eyes,

341
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:43,166
so he wouldn't go out with just anybody.

342
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,877
Face mist.

343
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:49,589
Enough.

344
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:52,425
I didn't ask for a wet sauna.
That's enough.

345
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:07,983
By the way,
why do you keep bringing her along?

346
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:10,986
It's crowded enough as it is,
and she's not doing anything.

347
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:13,280
She's an intern,
so I'm training her on the job.

348
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:14,197
That's my point.

349
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:16,491
Why are you training her
while working for me?

350
00:26:16,574 --> 00:26:19,411
Even the professionals
don't fully meet my standards.

351
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:22,497
How would a newbie not get on my nerves?

352
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,833
-Seriously?
-She has a serious attitude problem.

353
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:27,711
You're our angel, Che-ni.
Could you try to be understanding?

354
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:33,258
Then, can you get me
some gimbap since I'm hungry?

355
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:35,176
Cheese gimbap.

356
00:26:43,643 --> 00:26:47,188
It was dumplings in high school,
and now it's gimbap.

357
00:26:53,611 --> 00:26:55,447
Hey, hurry up!

358
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:56,364
Here you are.

359
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:01,786
What's this?

360
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,371
Don't you know I hate cucumber?

361
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:05,540
You should have asked
to take the cucumber out.

362
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:08,209
I'm sorry.
I didn't know you didn't like it.

363
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:10,128
Should I go get a new one?

364
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:13,381
No need. I'm starving,
so just take the cucumber out.

365
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:17,969
What are you doing?

366
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,347
Take the cucumber out.

367
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:21,890
You take it out.

368
00:27:23,683 --> 00:27:25,810
Hey, I'm Che-ni.

369
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:28,980
Should I be taking the cucumber
out of my gimbap?

370
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:32,150
I said you take it out!
Do you not have hands?

371
00:27:32,233 --> 00:27:34,736
I didn't study cosmetology
to take cucumber out of gimbap!

372
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:35,904
What's with the power trip?

373
00:27:37,238 --> 00:27:39,407
Hey, are you crazy?
Do you want to get fired?

374
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:41,659
I'd rather quit than get fired by you.

375
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:43,661
You insolent brat with no personality!

376
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:45,830
What? What did you just say?

377
00:27:46,581 --> 00:27:47,916
Che-ni, what's going on?

378
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:50,502
This girl just…

379
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:52,045
Here she goes again.

380
00:27:52,128 --> 00:27:53,838
Hey, what the heck?

381
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:55,507
What did you do to her?

382
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:58,426
That's enough, please!
You need to stop too, Che-ni.

383
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:01,012
-Why do you keep putting on a show?
-Have you lost it?

384
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:03,181
Hey, what did you just say to her?

385
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:04,724
Hey!

386
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:10,355
Are you some thug who pushes girls?

387
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:12,399
Kang Su-jin.

388
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:17,195
Are you all right? Did he hurt you?

389
00:28:22,158 --> 00:28:23,368
How have you been?

390
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:25,578
I've been okay.

391
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:28,915
How have you been?

392
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:30,917
After I dropped out,

393
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,086
my mom and I went abroad
to stay with my aunt.

394
00:28:33,628 --> 00:28:35,213
My parents got divorced.

395
00:28:35,296 --> 00:28:37,048
So you must be in school now, right?

396
00:28:37,632 --> 00:28:38,466
No.

397
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:40,802
I'm doing overseas volunteer work.

398
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:43,263
I got back from Haiti not too long ago.

399
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:45,014
I see.

400
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:47,809
So that was why.

401
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:52,731
No one heard from you,
so I wondered what happened to you.

402
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:54,357
Because I didn't tell anyone.

403
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:57,610
I wanted to apologize
when I came back to Korea.

404
00:28:58,361 --> 00:29:00,905
So I asked around about
where you work and came here.

405
00:29:01,948 --> 00:29:02,949
Ju-kyung,

406
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,201
I'm sorry.

407
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:08,246
It's too late, but I apologize.

408
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:13,084
I'm really sorry.

409
00:29:14,335 --> 00:29:16,004
I'm not saying this expecting forgiveness.

410
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:17,297
Su-jin.

411
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,382
I was so twisted then.

412
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:22,677
I thought you had everything
that I didn't,

413
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:26,264
so it felt like I had lost again.

414
00:29:26,347 --> 00:29:29,058
I thought by taking
and ruining things for you

415
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:31,519
would mean my victory.

416
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:35,273
I always had to beat someone else and win.

417
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:38,359
That's how I was taught.

418
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:42,906
But when I got away from my dad,

419
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:45,950
I realized how badly I hurt you…

420
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:50,121
and what I had lost.

421
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:53,625
I regretted it so much.

422
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:56,211
So I wanted to apologize to you,

423
00:29:57,837 --> 00:30:00,215
but I didn't feel like
I should do it over the phone.

424
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:03,676
I thought you might avoid my calls too.

425
00:30:05,553 --> 00:30:06,930
You should have just called.

426
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:10,934
I would have gladly picked it up.

427
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:15,313
I guess I should have.

428
00:30:22,445 --> 00:30:23,696
I'm fine.

429
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:26,699
I'm really okay now.

430
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:30,036
The memories from then

431
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:33,331
don't pain me as much anymore.

432
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:37,377
I'm not even upset with you.

433
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:40,129
But still…

434
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:42,549
I'm relieved

435
00:30:43,716 --> 00:30:45,677
that I got to meet you and apologize.

436
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:48,263
I'm even more relieved

437
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:50,181
to hear that you're free now.

438
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:52,684
Your hands are all healed.

439
00:30:56,312 --> 00:30:57,146
They're pretty.

440
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:07,198
Your kick was still amazing.

441
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:08,783
I lost my temper and kicked him.

442
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:11,369
I hope I didn't get you into trouble.

443
00:31:11,452 --> 00:31:13,621
The worst that can happen is they fire me.

444
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:14,539
It's okay.

445
00:31:18,751 --> 00:31:21,421
-That song?
-Of course. I suggested it.

446
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:24,215
I told you I've been a fan of Leo's songs.

447
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:26,217
You and Se-yeon wrote the song together.

448
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:29,262
I thought it'd be meaningful
if Seo-jun sang it.

449
00:31:29,345 --> 00:31:32,473
We're not doing Se-yeon justice
by leaving it as a plagiarized song.

450
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:33,850
I'm sure you were upset too.

451
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:38,813
What has you so deep in thought?

452
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:40,356
It's just hard to believe.

453
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:42,984
I haven't even studied music properly.

454
00:31:43,526 --> 00:31:45,570
All I know is what I learned from Se-yeon.

455
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:47,280
Seo-jun told me everything.

456
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:51,159
He said one can easily see your passion
from all those instruments at home.

457
00:31:52,952 --> 00:31:55,455
We're not going to put it
on the album if it sounds bad,

458
00:31:55,538 --> 00:31:56,956
so don't get ahead of yourself.

459
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:02,378
I want to hear
Leo's version of "Starlight."

460
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:05,882
Don't overthink it and send it along.
Okay?

461
00:32:07,508 --> 00:32:09,594
All right, that's enough business talk.

462
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:11,930
Can I open my wedding gift now?

463
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,514
Sure.

464
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:16,768
Goodness, why is it so heavy?

465
00:32:26,402 --> 00:32:29,280
Gosh, this is so thoughtful of you.

466
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:31,616
Congratulations on your wedding.

467
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:34,369
We have a lot of things
that needed fixing at home.

468
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:47,715
I want to hear
Leo's version of "Starlight."

469
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:08,379
Who is he? What's his name?

470
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:10,381
Su-jin already kicked him for me.

471
00:34:11,674 --> 00:34:12,592
That's nice of her.

472
00:34:12,675 --> 00:34:16,137
-Were I there, I would've nearly killed--
-You're not nearly killing anyone.

473
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,722
Luckily, I didn't get fired.

474
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:20,183
I'm being punished, but still.

475
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:23,644
I need to finish this quickly,
so I'll call you later.

476
00:34:29,984 --> 00:34:30,985
What are you doing?

477
00:34:31,819 --> 00:34:34,572
I'm washing the brushes and sponges.

478
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:36,157
-All by yourself?
-Yes.

479
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:39,660
What do you think you're doing?

480
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:42,455
These are latex puffs.
They shrink when washed in hot water!

481
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:45,124
I'm sorry.

482
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:49,420
Sort out the natural brushes
from the synthetic ones first.

483
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:51,631
They're washed differently,
so don't get confused.

484
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:53,424
Understood.

485
00:34:54,008 --> 00:34:55,301
Lim Su-jeong, was it?

486
00:34:55,384 --> 00:34:57,345
I'm Lim Ju-kyung.

487
00:34:57,428 --> 00:35:00,098
Are you the one
who told Che-ni off earlier?

488
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:02,600
I'm really sorry about that too, ma'am.

489
00:35:02,683 --> 00:35:03,976
You did well on that.

490
00:35:04,727 --> 00:35:06,604
She looked down on my staff too much.

491
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:09,107
I told her to go elsewhere.

492
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:11,317
Ma'am.

493
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:13,903
The poster on the announcement board

494
00:35:13,986 --> 00:35:17,115
for the makeup concept proposal
for Move Entertainment's new boy band…

495
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:18,449
Can I submit one too?

496
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:21,828
-Lim Kyung-ja, can't you read?
-What?

497
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:25,665
The eligibility section clearly states,
"all employees."

498
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:29,377
Thank you! I'll try my best!

499
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:33,214
But my name is Lim Ju-kyung.

500
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:52,108
Gosh, he's really handsome. Who is he?

501
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:54,152
-Is that his girlfriend?
-Probably just a friend.

502
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:55,403
Were you waiting long?

503
00:35:57,196 --> 00:35:59,657
Babe, what took you so long?

504
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:00,867
I was waiting for you.

505
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:03,327
Babe, did you eat yet?

506
00:36:03,911 --> 00:36:05,496
Here, open up.

507
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:08,040
Let's just do this. She's his girlfriend.

508
00:36:14,922 --> 00:36:16,174
Did you just get jealous?

509
00:36:16,757 --> 00:36:18,676
"Babe"?

510
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:23,014
As if.

511
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:26,726
Don't go around smiling like that. Got it?

512
00:36:27,476 --> 00:36:30,271
I think those middle schoolers
made you jealous just now.

513
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:33,608
Didn't they, "babe"?

514
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:35,401
That's enough, Soo-ho.

515
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:38,112
Why did you stop calling me "babe," babe?

516
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:39,864
No, thank you.

517
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:41,782
Should I try it?

518
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:42,700
Try what?

519
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:44,702
Calling me babe?

520
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:49,081
I'm not sure how to approach it
since I've rarely done makeup on guys.

521
00:36:51,792 --> 00:36:55,046
-This is quite ticklish.
-Hold still. I really need to try this.

522
00:36:55,129 --> 00:36:58,382
Imagining it and actually seeing it
in front of me is different.

523
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:01,219
Come on, you're my model.

524
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:04,347
-Come on, Soo-ho.
-I get it.

525
00:37:04,972 --> 00:37:06,515
-Hold still.
-Okay.

526
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:09,310
Hey, the vibe is great. One, two.

527
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:11,938
Good. Look over here, one, two, three!

528
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:14,190
It's great, the models are great,
a great vibe.

529
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:17,235
Smile. Seo-jun, look here and smile.
That's perfect!

530
00:37:19,153 --> 00:37:21,948
One, two, three, two, three.
Look over here, that's great.

531
00:37:24,116 --> 00:37:26,535
Guys! You're so handsome!

532
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:29,830
I bet girls will go nuts over you!

533
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:31,499
Why are you two so overly excited?

534
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:34,961
Because you're doing great.
Let's turn the industry upside down!

535
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:37,421
Your frown actually looks cool.
Nice, Seo-jun.

536
00:37:55,898 --> 00:37:58,317
FINAL VERSION OF "STARLIGHT"

537
00:38:03,739 --> 00:38:04,573
Here goes nothing.

538
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:11,455
EMAIL HAS BEEN SENT SUCCESSFULLY

539
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:24,051
Here, ma'am.

540
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:27,179
MAKEUP CONCEPT PROPOSAL
FOR MOVE ENTERTAINMENT'S NEW BOY BAND

541
00:38:37,898 --> 00:38:40,693
You felt okay about it?
Weren't you angry at all?

542
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:43,446
Not at all.
It was so great to see her again.

543
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:46,657
You're just too nice.

544
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:51,412
But I do want to see her too, though.

545
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:52,997
I've wondered how she's doing.

546
00:38:55,624 --> 00:38:57,543
This one's cute. Try it.

547
00:38:57,626 --> 00:38:59,086
-Should I?
-Sure.

548
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:06,052
This one's also super cute. Try this one!

549
00:39:08,971 --> 00:39:11,140
How much did your sister give you
for a new bag?

550
00:39:11,223 --> 00:39:12,183
What's your budget?

551
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:17,104
-She gave me her card!
-Hey, then get both. Just buy everything.

552
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:19,857
No, I also need to buy my outfit
for her wedding day.

553
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:21,650
-I'll take this one.
-Yes.

554
00:39:27,656 --> 00:39:30,076
Which one would work better
for Hee-kyung's wedding?

555
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:31,160
This one or that one?

556
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:34,413
I like this one.

557
00:39:34,955 --> 00:39:35,790
No, this one.

558
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:37,708
No, this one.

559
00:39:38,292 --> 00:39:41,629
-I like this one.
-Then why did you ask me to pick?

560
00:39:44,965 --> 00:39:48,886
By the way, you went on a trip
with Soo-ho recently.

561
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:50,012
I did. So?

562
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:53,307
-Nothing happened?
-What do you mean?

563
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:54,683
Well, you know.

564
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:58,229
This and that. And you know…

565
00:39:58,312 --> 00:39:59,438
"This and that"?

566
00:40:00,022 --> 00:40:01,565
I almost lost my phone and--

567
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:03,234
No, not that kind of stuff.

568
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:04,193
More like…

569
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:06,779
You know what I'm saying.

570
00:40:06,862 --> 00:40:08,614
Come on.

571
00:40:08,697 --> 00:40:11,283
We just took an early morning train
for a day trip.

572
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:13,911
What? You two are too uptight.

573
00:40:13,994 --> 00:40:16,247
-You're not in high school anymore and--
-Stop it.

574
00:40:17,331 --> 00:40:18,916
Don't be embarrassed.

575
00:40:18,999 --> 00:40:21,252
Why aren't you seeing Soo-ho
on your day off?

576
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:22,628
He's meeting Tae-hoon today.

577
00:40:22,711 --> 00:40:23,546
What, Tae-hoon?

578
00:40:23,629 --> 00:40:25,673
Why didn't you say that? Let's join them.

579
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:27,716
Let's just let them
hang out by themselves.

580
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,926
Hey, I actually miss…

581
00:40:30,177 --> 00:40:31,011
Well…

582
00:40:32,012 --> 00:40:34,515
I need to get something from him,

583
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:36,642
so call Soo-ho.

584
00:40:36,725 --> 00:40:37,601
Okay.

585
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:40,604
BOYFRIEND

586
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:46,861
He's not answering.

587
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:49,113
What? Try calling him again.

588
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:57,455
He's still not answering.
I guess they're busy talking.

589
00:40:58,372 --> 00:40:59,874
Something is fishy.

590
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:02,543
Tae-hoon's been enjoying himself
too much before the military.

591
00:41:04,211 --> 00:41:05,087
APGUJEONG BEAR PUB

592
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:06,714
We are going somewhere hot today!

593
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:07,715
What?

594
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:09,675
What?

595
00:41:10,217 --> 00:41:11,302
"Somewhere hot"?

596
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:13,053
What is it?

597
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:15,139
APGUJEONG BEAR PUB

598
00:41:15,222 --> 00:41:18,392
-What the heck? This is a singles bar!
-What?

599
00:41:19,393 --> 00:41:20,478
A singles bar?

600
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:22,062
APGUJEONG BEAR PUB

601
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:23,814
Yoo Tae-hoon, you're dead meat.

602
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:27,359
Did he answer?

603
00:41:28,402 --> 00:41:29,945
He's not picking up.

604
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:32,239
Why are you calling?

605
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:34,408
Hey, where are you now?
What are you doing?

606
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:36,577
I'm having a hot-ass time with Soo-ho.
Why?

607
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,496
-"A hot-ass time"?
-What? "Hot-ass"?

608
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:41,040
-Hey, if you don't--
-I'm busy. Hang up.

609
00:41:41,123 --> 00:41:43,501
Hello? Hey, Yoo Tae-hoon!

610
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:45,836
-What did he say?
-This dirtbag!

611
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:47,546
Did someone call me?

612
00:41:48,297 --> 00:41:49,298
-Move!
-Out of my way!

613
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:08,859
YOUR DRIVER IS ON THE WAY

614
00:42:11,445 --> 00:42:14,031
Yoo Tae-hoon, you went
to a singles bar with Soo-ho, right?

615
00:42:14,114 --> 00:42:15,199
What are you saying?

616
00:42:15,282 --> 00:42:17,701
Your post said
you were going "somewhere hot"!

617
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:20,538
-What did you do in your "hot-ass time"?
-But where's Soo-ho?

618
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:22,581
Let go! We went over there.

619
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:25,709
A sauna?

620
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:27,211
-Yes!
-What?

621
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:29,713
It's Ju-kyung.

622
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:33,634
You two were "somewhere hot"

623
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:34,927
and had a "hot-ass time."

624
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:39,431
-Yes, it was hot.
-Right.

625
00:42:39,515 --> 00:42:41,141
It was very hot.

626
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:43,310
Hey.

627
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:44,937
Hey, Su… What's up with him?

628
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:46,689
He's listless like seaweed!

629
00:42:46,772 --> 00:42:48,774
I made him drink a bit in the sauna.

630
00:42:48,857 --> 00:42:49,984
What do we do with him?

631
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:51,569
Soo-ho, wake up.

632
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:53,654
Du-kyung.

633
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:56,240
-Why are you calling her "Du-kyung"?
-Why are you calling her "Du-kyung"?

634
00:42:56,323 --> 00:42:57,783
You're really drunk.

635
00:42:57,866 --> 00:42:58,742
I'll take you home.

636
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:00,327
-I'm going, guys. Let's go.
-Okay.

637
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:02,454
-Okay.
-Come here, get up.

638
00:43:03,455 --> 00:43:05,082
Okay, get home safe.

639
00:43:05,874 --> 00:43:07,084
Get home safe!

640
00:43:07,167 --> 00:43:09,044
The ground is coming towards me.

641
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:11,922
-Taxi.
-Taxi.

642
00:43:13,215 --> 00:43:14,508
No, not there.

643
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:17,011
-Here, let's go.
-Let's go.

644
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:18,095
Bye!

645
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:23,809
I'll be off, then.

646
00:43:23,892 --> 00:43:25,686
Wait, Tu-ah… no.

647
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:26,604
I'm sorry.

648
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:28,772
But why did you come here?

649
00:43:29,898 --> 00:43:31,233
What do you mean?

650
00:43:31,317 --> 00:43:33,444
Well, we're not together.

651
00:43:33,527 --> 00:43:35,779
So my going somewhere hot
or having a hot-ass time

652
00:43:36,363 --> 00:43:37,781
is hardly your business, right?

653
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:41,994
I never said it was my business.

654
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:45,039
You know you dumped me 17 times already?

655
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:48,334
I'm never going to take you back
regardless of what you say.

656
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:51,211
-Why follow me if you won't take me back?
-It's late.

657
00:43:53,505 --> 00:43:55,633
It's dangerous.
I can't let you go home alone.

658
00:43:56,842 --> 00:43:58,719
Seriously, whatever.

659
00:43:59,845 --> 00:44:00,804
I love…

660
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:04,308
I love you.

661
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:09,104
Come here.

662
00:44:12,941 --> 00:44:13,942
Thank you.

663
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:18,572
Come here.

664
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:22,951
Don't you ever drink like this again.

665
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:27,164
Ju-kyung.

666
00:44:30,042 --> 00:44:31,418
Where am I?

667
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:34,213
Where? You're at your place.

668
00:44:34,296 --> 00:44:35,631
-Here.
-My head's spinning.

669
00:44:35,714 --> 00:44:38,008
Be careful. Here, careful.

670
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:55,109
That's…

671
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:58,445
I came across it,
but I'm specially giving it to you.

672
00:44:59,071 --> 00:45:01,323
You're now my friend
I've shared my secret with,

673
00:45:01,407 --> 00:45:02,658
so I should care for you.

674
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:06,161
You've put it here.

675
00:45:16,296 --> 00:45:19,842
Look at him all drunk,
smiling with his eyes. It won't do.

676
00:45:19,925 --> 00:45:22,302
-Didn't I tell you not to smile so much?
-What?

677
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:24,847
By the way, who are you?

678
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:26,723
What?

679
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:30,060
Who are you
to barge into my place like this?

680
00:45:31,478 --> 00:45:33,605
-I'm Lim Ju-kyung.
-Lim Ju-kyung?

681
00:45:35,107 --> 00:45:37,025
My girlfriend's name is also Lim Ju-kyung.

682
00:45:40,654 --> 00:45:42,156
You're pretty too.

683
00:45:42,948 --> 00:45:43,866
Is that right?

684
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:47,870
Then do you want to break up
with your girlfriend and date me?

685
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:49,997
I can't do that!

686
00:45:50,706 --> 00:45:52,583
I'm Lim Ju-kyung's man!

687
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:54,501
That's too bad.

688
00:45:56,879 --> 00:45:58,672
Then I'll be leaving now.

689
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:01,008
Get some rest.

690
00:46:02,801 --> 00:46:03,844
Wait.

691
00:46:05,512 --> 00:46:06,763
Come here.

692
00:46:15,022 --> 00:46:19,860
I like you so much, what do I do?

693
00:46:19,943 --> 00:46:21,904
Hey, that's really cringey. Stop.

694
00:46:22,571 --> 00:46:28,160
I like you so much, what do I do?

695
00:46:28,243 --> 00:46:31,246
You're a totally different person
when you're drunk.

696
00:46:36,376 --> 00:46:37,336
Ju-kyung.

697
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:40,214
You know what?

698
00:46:42,549 --> 00:46:45,010
The song Se-yeon and I wrote together…

699
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:48,931
is going to be sung by Seo-jun.

700
00:46:50,724 --> 00:46:51,767
Really?

701
00:46:55,854 --> 00:46:56,939
Would Se-yeon…

702
00:46:58,857 --> 00:46:59,816
like that?

703
00:47:02,402 --> 00:47:04,780
Of course. I'm sure of it.

704
00:47:06,281 --> 00:47:07,157
Really?

705
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:09,701
Of course.

706
00:47:10,953 --> 00:47:13,872
If I were him, I'd be over the moon.

707
00:47:17,376 --> 00:47:18,252
I do…

708
00:47:19,962 --> 00:47:21,588
hope so.

709
00:47:57,874 --> 00:47:58,792
Ju-kyung.

710
00:48:01,128 --> 00:48:01,962
Wake up.

711
00:48:09,886 --> 00:48:10,804
Ju-kyung.

712
00:48:12,347 --> 00:48:13,348
It's late.

713
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:15,767
Wake up.

714
00:48:20,314 --> 00:48:21,690
I tried to wake you up.

715
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:25,319
You just didn't wake up.

716
00:48:30,282 --> 00:48:31,491
I love you.

717
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:55,766
-Are you all right?
-What?

718
00:48:55,849 --> 00:48:56,683
Yes.

719
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:59,436
I was going to go once you were asleep,
but I fell asleep.

720
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:00,854
I was about to wake you up.

721
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:03,815
3 MISSED CALLS
MOM

722
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:06,985
Mom called me.

723
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:08,737
I didn't tell her I'd be late.

724
00:49:09,321 --> 00:49:11,114
Why didn't you go home?

725
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:13,992
I told your mom
you were sleeping at my place.

726
00:49:14,076 --> 00:49:16,453
Have fun, my friend.

727
00:49:17,829 --> 00:49:20,248
Aren't you going to call her?

728
00:49:23,043 --> 00:49:24,002
Well…

729
00:49:24,086 --> 00:49:26,672
I think Su-ah covered for me.

730
00:49:27,923 --> 00:49:28,757
She did?

731
00:49:31,885 --> 00:49:34,346
I'll take you home. Where are my car keys?

732
00:49:34,429 --> 00:49:36,098
Where did I put them?

733
00:49:36,181 --> 00:49:37,599
But you drank tonight.

734
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:39,351
Right.

735
00:49:40,435 --> 00:49:42,521
I can call a designated driver.

736
00:49:44,106 --> 00:49:45,524
I'll just call a taxi.

737
00:49:48,985 --> 00:49:51,905
I can't seem to get one.
Is it because it's early in the morning?

738
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:00,163
I'll try to get one outside.

739
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:06,920
Can you just stay?

740
00:50:09,756 --> 00:50:10,674
Do you have to go?

741
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:13,802
It's already late.

742
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:19,808
Don't go.

743
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:24,790
Are you cooking something?

744
00:51:25,457 --> 00:51:26,666
That's impressive.

745
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:27,793
What, this?

746
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:30,378
I'm just stir-frying things.

747
00:51:32,964 --> 00:51:35,050
I can't even cook instant noodles right.

748
00:51:35,133 --> 00:51:37,052
I guess I'll be the cook then.

749
00:51:39,304 --> 00:51:40,889
It looks good. Here.

750
00:51:41,515 --> 00:51:42,390
I'm hungry.

751
00:51:43,517 --> 00:51:44,351
Ta-da!

752
00:51:46,645 --> 00:51:47,646
Take your time.

753
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:49,481
It's really good.

754
00:51:49,564 --> 00:51:52,734
-Did you use some kind of secret sauce?
-Have some salad too.

755
00:51:52,818 --> 00:51:53,693
I told you.

756
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:56,404
You need to have a lot of fiber
for your constipation.

757
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:12,587
Hold on.

758
00:52:18,468 --> 00:52:19,553
Ta-da!

759
00:52:22,722 --> 00:52:24,099
In my eyes…

760
00:52:26,434 --> 00:52:27,811
you are Lim Ju-kyung.

761
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:33,525
You kept this all this time?

762
00:52:34,776 --> 00:52:35,735
Here.

763
00:52:38,613 --> 00:52:40,073
Do you know how to tie hair?

764
00:52:40,782 --> 00:52:41,950
I'll give it a try.

765
00:52:46,496 --> 00:52:47,497
Does it look weird?

766
00:52:48,039 --> 00:52:50,000
Why did you keep it?

767
00:52:50,083 --> 00:52:51,501
I'm glad I kept it.

768
00:52:52,961 --> 00:52:55,755
Do you want to go see a movie
after I get off work?

769
00:52:56,715 --> 00:52:59,301
I can't today. I have important business.

770
00:53:00,552 --> 00:53:01,678
"Important business"?

771
00:53:03,805 --> 00:53:10,437
As I close my eyes
The sight of you grows clearer

772
00:53:10,937 --> 00:53:17,235
I long even more for your bright light

773
00:53:17,736 --> 00:53:23,491
You used to spend long nights here

774
00:53:24,659 --> 00:53:27,537
It's where I'll briefly rest

775
00:53:27,621 --> 00:53:31,291
And stay by your side

776
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:38,131
When the song borne out of my weary tears

777
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:45,639
Reaches the sky

778
00:53:45,722 --> 00:53:48,224
Approach me slowly…

779
00:53:48,308 --> 00:53:49,893
-Great job, everyone.
-Well done.

780
00:53:49,976 --> 00:53:52,228
Hey, you were awesome.

781
00:53:52,896 --> 00:53:54,439
You might get sued at this rate.

782
00:53:54,522 --> 00:53:56,775
For breaking the hearts of fangirls.

783
00:53:56,858 --> 00:53:57,901
Cringe much?

784
00:53:57,984 --> 00:54:00,570
So Leo, what did you think?

785
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:01,488
Poor.

786
00:54:02,614 --> 00:54:04,282
You'll break those poor fangirls' hearts.

787
00:54:05,408 --> 00:54:06,826
-Are you kidding me?
-No.

788
00:54:07,953 --> 00:54:10,163
Hey, beautiful guys. Go ahead and fight.

789
00:54:10,246 --> 00:54:13,083
-I love all the blood, sweat, and tears.
-Hold on.

790
00:54:13,166 --> 00:54:14,709
You're not throwing up again, are you?

791
00:54:14,793 --> 00:54:16,252
Jeez.

792
00:54:16,336 --> 00:54:17,587
Finish up the session.

793
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:19,798
I need to go get ready
for my wedding tomorrow.

794
00:54:19,881 --> 00:54:21,049
I'll be off then.

795
00:54:21,132 --> 00:54:23,760
Congratulations.
You're getting yourself a fine husband.

796
00:54:23,843 --> 00:54:24,678
Right?

797
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:27,389
I need to give my grapefruit a good life.

798
00:54:27,472 --> 00:54:29,015
-Bye!
-Goodbye.

799
00:54:30,558 --> 00:54:33,144
-I'm hungry.
-Do you want to eat something?

800
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:35,897
Is that enough?

801
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:38,900
Hey, I can't sing well when I'm full.

802
00:54:38,984 --> 00:54:39,818
By the way,

803
00:54:40,402 --> 00:54:42,070
your voice isn't what it used to be.

804
00:54:42,153 --> 00:54:43,905
Hey, when I was singing earlier,

805
00:54:43,989 --> 00:54:46,032
I saw you secretly crying!

806
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:46,950
Who, me?

807
00:54:50,036 --> 00:54:53,039
I won't get to see you as often
when you get busy after your debut.

808
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:56,167
I'll be super busy.
Get in line while you can.

809
00:54:56,835 --> 00:54:58,586
Hey, I'll be busy too.

810
00:54:59,754 --> 00:55:01,339
I'm going to start studying.

811
00:55:02,048 --> 00:55:03,675
-Studying what?
-Studying music.

812
00:55:04,259 --> 00:55:06,511
I learned how to compose
by watching others do it.

813
00:55:06,594 --> 00:55:09,389
I want to learn it properly,
starting from the basics.

814
00:55:09,472 --> 00:55:11,433
Hey, are you taking the CSAT then?

815
00:55:13,226 --> 00:55:15,937
Poor Ju-kyung.
She has to support a CSAT taker then.

816
00:55:16,021 --> 00:55:18,148
Even if I were to take it now,
I could get into most schools.

817
00:55:18,231 --> 00:55:19,649
You jerk, stop bragging.

818
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:21,568
Do you want some cola?

819
00:55:21,651 --> 00:55:24,946
Carbonation is bad for your vocal cords.
Drink water instead.

820
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:27,157
Okay, I get it. I'll drink water.

821
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:28,908
There was a reason
you didn't sound as good.

822
00:55:30,035 --> 00:55:31,786
Are you my wife? Stop nagging.

823
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:34,164
You're debuting soon,
so have some self-discipline.

824
00:55:41,421 --> 00:55:44,007
LIM HEE-KYUNG, HAN JUN-WOO
WE'RE GETTING MARRIED

825
00:55:44,090 --> 00:55:45,300
BRIDE'S SIDE

826
00:55:45,383 --> 00:55:46,593
GROOM'S SIDE

827
00:55:46,676 --> 00:55:48,011
LIM HEE-KYUNG, HAN JUN-WOO
WE'RE GETTING MARRIED

828
00:55:52,807 --> 00:55:54,392
Hey, who is it?

829
00:55:54,476 --> 00:55:56,561
Who do you keep texting?

830
00:55:56,644 --> 00:55:57,729
Someone from my school.

831
00:55:57,812 --> 00:55:58,730
Someone from school?

832
00:55:59,314 --> 00:56:00,607
A guy or a girl?

833
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:03,318
-A guy.
-A guy?

834
00:56:04,944 --> 00:56:06,279
You're smiling?

835
00:56:07,447 --> 00:56:10,116
Shouldn't you wait for me
to get into college next year?

836
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,701
Who told you to take the CSAT again?

837
00:56:12,368 --> 00:56:13,787
It's not like I chose to.

838
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:14,788
Whatever.

839
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:18,333
Okay, I'll stomach you flirting with guys.

840
00:56:18,917 --> 00:56:22,087
Enjoy your college life, but not too much.

841
00:56:25,673 --> 00:56:26,883
Hey, Ju-young.

842
00:56:27,634 --> 00:56:28,468
What?

843
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:34,224
I know how much you like me,
and I know there's no one quite like you.

844
00:56:34,307 --> 00:56:38,311
So don't you flirt with other girls
at your academy.

845
00:56:38,394 --> 00:56:39,979
I'll make you pay.

846
00:56:42,607 --> 00:56:44,275
Go-un!

847
00:56:47,737 --> 00:56:49,280
Gosh, Ju-kyung.

848
00:56:49,364 --> 00:56:52,700
I see your time in college and internship
was a good bang for your buck.

849
00:56:52,784 --> 00:56:54,911
Watch your language. You're the bride.

850
00:56:54,994 --> 00:56:56,412
Hold still, won't you?

851
00:56:57,330 --> 00:56:59,499
Hee-kyung looks so beautiful.

852
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:03,086
What's wrong with me? Seriously…

853
00:57:03,169 --> 00:57:05,380
I shouldn't keep crying,
but I can't help myself.

854
00:57:06,131 --> 00:57:09,175
-The bride and the groom are switched.
-He's so cute.

855
00:57:10,718 --> 00:57:11,719
What is that, Dad?

856
00:57:11,803 --> 00:57:14,305
He cried all night long,
so his eyes were puffy.

857
00:57:16,474 --> 00:57:17,892
They are much better now.

858
00:57:17,976 --> 00:57:18,810
But…

859
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:20,937
my…

860
00:57:24,732 --> 00:57:26,151
Why do you keep crying?

861
00:57:26,234 --> 00:57:28,736
She's marrying a guy
who's just like her dad.

862
00:57:30,363 --> 00:57:31,698
-All done.
-Really?

863
00:57:32,407 --> 00:57:35,368
Gosh, is this really me? What?

864
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:36,453
You did great, thanks.

865
00:57:36,536 --> 00:57:38,163
-Hyun-sook.
-You're here.

866
00:57:38,246 --> 00:57:39,831
-Hello.
-Hee-kyung, you look so pretty.

867
00:57:39,914 --> 00:57:40,748
Congratulations.

868
00:57:40,832 --> 00:57:43,001
-Where's Seo-jun?
-It's just me and Go-un.

869
00:57:43,084 --> 00:57:45,795
Seo-jun's really busy
preparing for his debut.

870
00:57:46,629 --> 00:57:48,131
You look beautiful.

871
00:57:48,214 --> 00:57:49,757
-Hyun-kyu Almighty.
-Yes, Savior Tae-hoon?

872
00:57:49,841 --> 00:57:52,135
What's this?
Why didn't you bring your girlfriend?

873
00:57:53,595 --> 00:57:54,637
My girlfriend is busy.

874
00:57:56,014 --> 00:57:57,056
You were lying, right?

875
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:59,476
You lied about having a girlfriend
to get out of the military pact.

876
00:57:59,559 --> 00:58:02,645
Even your couple's ring looks ridiculous.

877
00:58:02,729 --> 00:58:04,564
-Are you wearing your dad's?
-My dad's?

878
00:58:04,647 --> 00:58:07,442
It's an 18k white gold ring
custom-made in Dongdaemun.

879
00:58:07,525 --> 00:58:09,068
-Whatever.
-What do you know?

880
00:58:09,152 --> 00:58:10,487
Hoon!

881
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:12,989
You look so handsome in your suit.

882
00:58:13,072 --> 00:58:15,074
What? Why are you
calling him "Hoon" again?

883
00:58:15,158 --> 00:58:17,076
You only call him "Hoon"
when you're dating.

884
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:18,578
Are you two back together?

885
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:20,914
When did I call him "Hoon"?

886
00:58:20,997 --> 00:58:22,707
You need to get your ears checked.

887
00:58:22,790 --> 00:58:25,084
That's fishy,
you don't easily call him "Hoon."

888
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:26,586
What do you mean, "fishy"?

889
00:58:26,669 --> 00:58:28,505
-Hey, long time no see!
-Hey, what's up?

890
00:58:28,588 --> 00:58:29,464
Hyun-kyu!

891
00:58:41,309 --> 00:58:43,061
Su-ah, your hand got larger.

892
00:58:43,144 --> 00:58:44,270
Hey, what are you doing?

893
00:58:45,688 --> 00:58:47,607
Why are you grabbing my girlfriend's hand?

894
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:49,859
No, it's not like that…
What? Your girlfriend?

895
00:58:49,943 --> 00:58:50,818
Hey!

896
00:58:51,569 --> 00:58:54,531
Hey, you two were always arguing,
When did you get so close?

897
00:58:54,614 --> 00:58:57,075
You told me you two would never date.
This is insane.

898
00:58:57,158 --> 00:58:59,452
I told you to be careful
not to get caught!

899
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:00,453
-Seriously.
-Amazing.

900
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:02,205
-Babe!
-"Babe"?

901
00:59:02,288 --> 00:59:04,707
Do I embarrass you, babe?

902
00:59:04,791 --> 00:59:06,584
-Stop it.
-What the heck?

903
00:59:07,835 --> 00:59:08,670
Hey, guys.

904
00:59:09,504 --> 00:59:12,674
-Please give us your blessing.
-No, stop.

905
00:59:12,757 --> 00:59:14,342
-Hold on.
-Stop it!

906
00:59:14,425 --> 00:59:16,010
Hey, don't!

907
00:59:16,094 --> 00:59:17,971
What do you think you're doing?

908
00:59:18,054 --> 00:59:19,931
-What's wrong with him?
-Hey!

909
00:59:20,014 --> 00:59:22,475
-Hoon, let's just go.
-I can't stand the sight of you.

910
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:24,519
Ju-kyung!

911
00:59:26,604 --> 00:59:27,772
You're here.

912
00:59:27,855 --> 00:59:29,440
How did her makeup turn out?

913
00:59:29,524 --> 00:59:32,819
Why do I feel nervous and weird
when Hee-kyung's the one getting married?

914
00:59:32,902 --> 00:59:35,572
Any news about the proposal?
You said you find out today.

915
00:59:35,655 --> 00:59:38,283
Yes, they made the announcement.

916
00:59:38,366 --> 00:59:40,660
-So, how did it go?
-Well…

917
00:59:41,536 --> 00:59:43,288
Good or bad?

918
00:59:45,790 --> 00:59:47,542
-You got it?
-I didn't.

919
00:59:47,625 --> 00:59:48,459
You didn't?

920
00:59:48,543 --> 00:59:51,504
It'd be weird for me to get picked
when I'm the newest employee.

921
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:54,090
That's too bad. You worked so hard on it.

922
00:59:54,674 --> 00:59:56,259
But it still feels good.

923
00:59:56,342 --> 00:59:58,761
My internship ends soon
with the semester coming up.

924
00:59:58,845 --> 01:00:01,306
I would've felt sorry for it to end
only having done chores.

925
01:00:01,389 --> 01:00:03,016
I learned a lot
preparing the presentation.

926
01:00:03,099 --> 01:00:04,517
I'm so proud of you.

927
01:00:06,853 --> 01:00:09,063
But I think I picked the wrong model.

928
01:00:09,147 --> 01:00:10,273
Why?

929
01:00:10,356 --> 01:00:13,443
People were more interested
in you than my proposal,

930
01:00:13,526 --> 01:00:14,736
asking where I booked you.

931
01:00:16,487 --> 01:00:17,947
It's your fault I didn't win.

932
01:00:18,781 --> 01:00:20,241
-Was it because of me?
-Yes.

933
01:00:20,908 --> 01:00:22,118
How do I make up for it?

934
01:00:22,785 --> 01:00:23,953
-Well…
-Really.

935
01:00:27,415 --> 01:00:29,334
Why do you two look
so pretty and handsome?

936
01:00:29,417 --> 01:00:31,836
-People might think it's your wedding.
-They so would.

937
01:00:35,381 --> 01:00:36,674
Su-jin.

938
01:00:36,758 --> 01:00:38,635
What? Kang Su-jin?

939
01:00:41,512 --> 01:00:43,723
Gosh, you haven't changed a bit.

940
01:00:44,724 --> 01:00:46,100
Long time no see, Kangsu.

941
01:00:47,685 --> 01:00:49,479
I haven't heard that nickname in years.

942
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:53,232
I'm glad you came.
Su-ah was asking about you too.

943
01:00:55,485 --> 01:00:58,112
-How have you been?
-I heard about your dad.

944
01:00:58,863 --> 01:01:02,158
-Glad to hear he's better now.
-Yes, thank you.

945
01:01:04,410 --> 01:01:06,537
Hey, I've missed you.

946
01:01:07,914 --> 01:01:09,040
You should have called.

947
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:12,460
I'm sorry.

948
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:15,254
That's so cute.

949
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:17,757
Hee-kyung, our wedding bands arrived.

950
01:01:18,257 --> 01:01:20,134
And not a minute too soon.

951
01:01:20,218 --> 01:01:21,719
-See if it fits.
-Yes.

952
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:26,474
-It's too snug.
-What?

953
01:01:27,058 --> 01:01:28,393
-I can't get it off.
-What?

954
01:01:28,476 --> 01:01:30,019
It's because you drank last night!

955
01:01:30,103 --> 01:01:31,729
What kind of bride drinks before--

956
01:01:31,813 --> 01:01:33,314
It's not coming off. You try.

957
01:01:33,398 --> 01:01:34,482
-Goodness.
-Let me see.

958
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:36,859
What? It's really not coming off.

959
01:01:38,152 --> 01:01:40,780
-I could just walk in wearing the ring.
-You can't do that.

960
01:01:40,863 --> 01:01:43,241
The exchange of rings
is important at a wedding.

961
01:01:43,324 --> 01:01:45,660
He's right. Let me see. I'll get it off.

962
01:01:45,743 --> 01:01:46,577
You will?

963
01:01:47,078 --> 01:01:48,371
I'm good at these things…

964
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:52,667
You're going to pull my finger off!

965
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:54,919
Easy, honey. Go easy.

966
01:01:55,002 --> 01:01:56,963
I will take it off for you!

967
01:02:02,969 --> 01:02:04,053
It came off.

968
01:02:07,557 --> 01:02:08,391
There it is.

969
01:02:14,355 --> 01:02:17,191
Ms. Lim, please come with me
to the bridal room.

970
01:02:17,275 --> 01:02:18,192
I got it.

971
01:02:22,530 --> 01:02:23,364
What's going on?

972
01:02:25,658 --> 01:02:26,617
-What?
-What is it?

973
01:02:26,701 --> 01:02:28,077
Darn it…

974
01:02:30,830 --> 01:02:32,123
Congratulations, Hee-kyung--

975
01:02:34,917 --> 01:02:37,044
What? Isn't this the bridal room?

976
01:02:37,128 --> 01:02:38,337
Why is the groom here?

977
01:02:39,046 --> 01:02:40,047
Hello.

978
01:02:40,131 --> 01:02:41,674
Goodness, what's going on?

979
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:44,594
Do grooms have waiting rooms these days?

980
01:02:44,677 --> 01:02:46,929
You look so handsome, Mr. Han!

981
01:02:47,013 --> 01:02:49,307
-Congratulations!
-Thank you.

982
01:02:49,390 --> 01:02:51,392
Let's take a photo.
Gather next to the groom.

983
01:02:51,476 --> 01:02:53,311
-Sure. Come over here.
-Yes.

984
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:55,688
Here, take a seat.

985
01:02:57,231 --> 01:02:58,941
Okay, I'm going to take it now.

986
01:02:59,025 --> 01:03:01,110
One, two, three.

987
01:03:02,779 --> 01:03:04,155
Ms. Lee.

988
01:03:04,947 --> 01:03:06,783
-Goodness!
-Are you okay?

989
01:03:08,242 --> 01:03:09,827
Gosh, Ms. Lee!

990
01:03:09,911 --> 01:03:12,580
-Please prepare for your entrance.
-All right.

991
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:15,958
-What do we do?
-Ms. Lee.

992
01:03:16,042 --> 01:03:17,084
I'm the groom!

993
01:03:20,087 --> 01:03:20,922
It's not working!

994
01:03:21,005 --> 01:03:22,882
When did her face get so big?

995
01:03:22,965 --> 01:03:25,218
What do we do? Should we call for help?

996
01:03:25,927 --> 01:03:27,470
-Police? Fire department?
-911?

997
01:03:27,553 --> 01:03:29,806
The bride needs to enter right now.
What do we do?

998
01:03:29,889 --> 01:03:30,807
What?

999
01:03:30,890 --> 01:03:32,850
Finally, the stars of the show!

1000
01:03:32,934 --> 01:03:35,561
The bride and the groom will now enter.

1001
01:03:35,645 --> 01:03:39,023
All guests,
please face the back of the room.

1002
01:03:39,106 --> 01:03:40,942
Now, please give a big round of applause

1003
01:03:41,025 --> 01:03:43,945
and a dolphin-like loud cheer
at your highest vocal register

1004
01:03:44,028 --> 01:03:47,532
to the man and the woman of the hour!

1005
01:03:47,615 --> 01:03:49,951
Bride and groom, you may enter.

1006
01:03:59,168 --> 01:04:02,964
This might be the most
beautiful wedding I've ever seen.

1007
01:04:04,632 --> 01:04:05,633
A round of applause!

1008
01:04:10,847 --> 01:04:13,808
The bride's necklace is very beautiful.

1009
01:04:19,856 --> 01:04:22,984
Now that we have finished
this sacred wedding processional,

1010
01:04:23,067 --> 01:04:26,445
the honorable wedding officiant
will share a word of blessing.

1011
01:04:26,529 --> 01:04:31,993
I am so grateful
and honored beyond measure

1012
01:04:32,076 --> 01:04:35,705
to be officiating the wedding

1013
01:04:35,788 --> 01:04:39,375
of Mr. Han Jun-woo and Ms. Lim Hee-kyung.

1014
01:04:39,458 --> 01:04:42,336
When I first met the groom,
Mr. Han Jun-woo,

1015
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:47,842
I saw a halo around him as he entered
the gate of Saebom High School.

1016
01:04:47,925 --> 01:04:51,596
I knew then and there
that he had the quality and the potential

1017
01:04:51,679 --> 01:04:56,100
to open up a new chapter in the history
of Saebom High School.

1018
01:04:56,183 --> 01:04:59,312
Now, the bride will demonstrate
her love for the groom

1019
01:04:59,395 --> 01:05:01,397
by giving three cheers!

1020
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:04,775
Han Jun-woo is my man!

1021
01:05:04,859 --> 01:05:08,362
-Han Jun-woo is mine!
-That was thunderous! Applause, please!

1022
01:05:14,660 --> 01:05:15,703
Kiss.

1023
01:05:15,786 --> 01:05:17,705
-Kiss!
-Kiss!

1024
01:05:17,788 --> 01:05:19,373
-Kiss!
-No, we won't.

1025
01:05:21,417 --> 01:05:22,335
A round of applause!

1026
01:06:17,556 --> 01:06:18,683
You're so awesome!

1027
01:08:32,691 --> 01:08:33,901
I'll go wash the sponges.

1028
01:08:38,030 --> 01:08:38,864
Seo-jun.

1029
01:08:39,573 --> 01:08:41,367
Hey, you're here too.

1030
01:08:41,450 --> 01:08:44,036
Hey, you look handsome today.

1031
01:08:44,537 --> 01:08:46,205
Just today?

1032
01:08:46,288 --> 01:08:47,665
I'm handsome all the time.

1033
01:08:49,708 --> 01:08:50,709
Are you done, Seo-jun?

1034
01:08:51,544 --> 01:08:53,212
-Should we get to it?
-Sure.

1035
01:09:10,062 --> 01:09:11,939
I guess you're paying attention today.

1036
01:09:31,917 --> 01:09:33,335
What color would you recommend?

1037
01:09:33,419 --> 01:09:35,671
Sorry? Me?

1038
01:09:35,754 --> 01:09:37,506
Who else could I be asking?

1039
01:09:42,344 --> 01:09:45,764
Considering the color of his hair
and his outfit…

1040
01:09:48,684 --> 01:09:51,395
how about going with something matte?

1041
01:09:52,479 --> 01:09:54,106
Then why don't you try it?

1042
01:09:54,773 --> 01:09:57,151
-Me?
-Seriously, who else is there?

1043
01:09:57,902 --> 01:09:58,736
Here.

1044
01:09:59,486 --> 01:10:02,406
You two are friends, right?
Good luck finishing it up for him.

1045
01:10:08,704 --> 01:10:09,747
Right.

1046
01:10:10,331 --> 01:10:11,332
Your concept proposal.

1047
01:10:12,625 --> 01:10:15,127
It wasn't half bad,
coming from a new member.

1048
01:10:16,128 --> 01:10:17,004
Lim Ju-kyung.

1049
01:10:21,383 --> 01:10:22,218
What's going on?

1050
01:10:22,301 --> 01:10:25,679
Hey, you heard her complimenting me
and calling my name, right?

1051
01:10:25,763 --> 01:10:26,805
I'm not dreaming, am I?

1052
01:10:27,556 --> 01:10:28,432
Are you that happy?

1053
01:10:29,558 --> 01:10:32,394
You don't know how
this fangirl is feeling right now!

1054
01:10:34,813 --> 01:10:35,856
Hurry up and finish it.

1055
01:10:37,274 --> 01:10:38,150
Okay.

1056
01:10:46,367 --> 01:10:47,743
Why are your hands shaking?

1057
01:10:48,369 --> 01:10:51,163
Actually, this is my first time
holding a brush on the job.

1058
01:10:52,331 --> 01:10:55,251
-You did it fine the last time.
-It's not the same thing.

1059
01:10:55,834 --> 01:10:58,254
Even if you try, you can't ruin it.

1060
01:10:58,337 --> 01:11:00,214
My lips are too gorgeous.

1061
01:11:02,841 --> 01:11:03,968
Hold still.

1062
01:11:20,651 --> 01:11:21,485
All done.

1063
01:11:24,071 --> 01:11:24,905
Thank you.

1064
01:11:25,823 --> 01:11:27,157
It's not like I did much.

1065
01:11:27,241 --> 01:11:28,826
Break a leg. I'll be watching.

1066
01:11:28,909 --> 01:11:29,994
Don't get nervous.

1067
01:11:31,078 --> 01:11:32,037
Good luck to you too.

1068
01:11:33,372 --> 01:11:34,373
Go get them!

1069
01:11:35,124 --> 01:11:36,792
Hey, your palm is so sweaty.

1070
01:11:37,668 --> 01:11:39,253
You're nervous, aren't you?

1071
01:11:39,336 --> 01:11:43,257
I'm not nervous. I'm fearless.
Does it look like I get nervous?

1072
01:11:58,856 --> 01:11:59,690
Let's go!

1073
01:11:59,773 --> 01:12:01,191
-Let's go.
-Put your hands here.

1074
01:12:02,234 --> 01:12:04,570
We practiced hard.
Let's give it our all out there.

1075
01:12:04,653 --> 01:12:06,572
-Sure thing!
-One, two, three.

1076
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:07,781
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

1077
01:12:11,035 --> 01:12:11,869
I'm back.

1078
01:12:12,578 --> 01:12:15,164
-Did it go well?
-Yes. I did Seo-jun's lips myself.

1079
01:12:16,206 --> 01:12:17,082
What about me?

1080
01:12:19,126 --> 01:12:20,294
They're starting.

1081
01:12:45,611 --> 01:12:49,573
The sky is tinged with violet

1082
01:12:51,867 --> 01:12:57,206
The bleak wind blows
Turning the night colder

1083
01:12:58,415 --> 01:13:04,088
Familiar memories etched into my heart

1084
01:13:04,171 --> 01:13:10,052
Once again
The night fills up with you

1085
01:13:13,639 --> 01:13:18,143
Only thankful memories remain

1086
01:13:19,937 --> 01:13:25,359
Of you and I, excited and smiling

1087
01:13:25,442 --> 01:13:32,408
Worried you might become a star
And vanish again

1088
01:13:32,491 --> 01:13:38,789
I will keep these feelings
In the space left by you

1089
01:13:39,832 --> 01:13:42,751
As I close my eyes

1090
01:13:42,835 --> 01:13:47,089
The sight of you grows clearer

1091
01:13:47,589 --> 01:13:50,342
I long even more

1092
01:13:50,426 --> 01:13:53,720
For your bright light

1093
01:13:53,804 --> 01:14:00,060
You used to spend long nights here

1094
01:14:01,061 --> 01:14:04,356
It's where I'll briefly rest

1095
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:08,235
And stay by your side

1096
01:14:08,318 --> 01:14:15,117
When the song borne out of my weary tears

1097
01:14:15,868 --> 01:14:22,040
Reaches the sky

1098
01:14:22,583 --> 01:14:24,960
Approach me slowly

1099
01:14:25,461 --> 01:14:29,840
Like a neverending dream

1100
01:14:29,923 --> 01:14:32,426
As a star

1101
01:14:32,509 --> 01:14:35,679
By my side

1102
01:14:54,615 --> 01:14:59,620
It's like wandering in the darkness
For a long time

1103
01:15:00,621 --> 01:15:04,333
And encountering a ray of light

1104
01:15:04,416 --> 01:15:07,419
All the weary days and sorrow

1105
01:15:08,086 --> 01:15:13,008
Melt away like the snow

1106
01:15:13,509 --> 01:15:18,347
A single thread of hope held off

1107
01:15:18,430 --> 01:15:22,684
-Countless tears
-Countless tears

1108
01:15:23,268 --> 01:15:27,981
I jumped in for a vague dream

1109
01:15:28,065 --> 01:15:32,528
Dedicating my whole heart to it

1110
01:15:33,028 --> 01:15:36,657
It all begins today

1111
01:15:37,157 --> 01:15:39,451
It's like I'm born again

1112
01:15:39,535 --> 01:15:45,666
The world unfolds before my eyes

1113
01:15:45,749 --> 01:15:49,920
I will begin my race again

1114
01:15:52,965 --> 01:15:56,468
-The future I only dreamed of
-You're so handsome!

1115
01:15:57,052 --> 01:16:02,474
Is turning into reality, piece by piece

1116
01:16:02,558 --> 01:16:08,105
All those dreams that I had longed for

1117
01:16:08,188 --> 01:16:14,736
Are almost within my grasp

1118
01:16:19,658 --> 01:16:23,453
PRINCE COMICS

1119
01:16:23,537 --> 01:16:25,205
I haven't finished reading it.

1120
01:16:29,668 --> 01:16:30,627
Are you done?

1121
01:16:30,711 --> 01:16:31,628
Not yet.

1122
01:16:32,212 --> 01:16:35,507
Isn't that too slow?
You said you're a fast reader.

1123
01:16:36,008 --> 01:16:38,343
I'm taking my time,
enjoying each and every page.

1124
01:16:39,344 --> 01:16:41,680
Are you just looking at the pictures
and moving on?

1125
01:16:42,264 --> 01:16:45,309
-That's a discourtesy to the genre.
-Unlike you, I am a fast reader.

1126
01:16:46,393 --> 01:16:47,769
Enough with the bragging.

1127
01:16:49,229 --> 01:16:51,523
Gosh, this is really good, though.

1128
01:16:51,607 --> 01:16:54,401
This is Killer of Darkness
reimagined as a zombie apocalypse.

1129
01:16:54,484 --> 01:16:56,194
It's a brilliant and modern take.

1130
01:16:56,278 --> 01:16:58,572
You think so?
I thought it was unnecessary.

1131
01:16:59,156 --> 01:16:59,990
With the zombies,

1132
01:17:00,073 --> 01:17:02,034
the classic charm of invoking an odd fear

1133
01:17:02,117 --> 01:17:04,286
toward an unknown metaphysical being

1134
01:17:04,369 --> 01:17:05,287
has all disappeared.

1135
01:17:06,121 --> 01:17:06,955
True.

1136
01:17:07,039 --> 01:17:09,333
There are many classics
where the originals are better.

1137
01:17:09,416 --> 01:17:12,169
Like the one published
by Ed Seller in 1921,

1138
01:17:12,252 --> 01:17:13,545
-Night of Nightmares!
-Night of Nightmares!

1139
01:17:13,629 --> 01:17:15,380
-Of course, you know it.
-How could I not?

1140
01:17:15,464 --> 01:17:17,090
With a modern drawing style--

1141
01:17:17,174 --> 01:17:19,551
I get it. Let's finish this first.
I want to see what happens.

1142
01:17:19,635 --> 01:17:20,802
Okay, turn the page.

1143
01:17:22,763 --> 01:17:24,264
I'm done reading. Go on, turn it.

1144
01:17:27,601 --> 01:17:28,685
Come on.

1145
01:17:31,355 --> 01:17:32,230
What are you doing?

1146
01:17:34,941 --> 01:17:37,277
No, it's not what you're thinking.

1147
01:17:40,989 --> 01:17:42,199
I'm sorry.

1148
01:17:42,282 --> 01:17:45,035
Please continue.
I'm heading out to grab a bite.

1149
01:17:45,118 --> 01:17:46,995
Actually, I'm getting a full-course meal.

1150
01:17:51,708 --> 01:17:52,918
Shall we continue?

1151
01:17:53,919 --> 01:17:56,421
Come on. Stop it.

1152
01:18:01,176 --> 01:18:02,427
I found it.

1153
01:19:15,208 --> 01:19:17,669
THANK YOU TO GO WOO-RI AND DAYOUNG
FOR THEIR SPECIAL APPEARANCE

1154
01:20:19,856 --> 01:20:24,611
