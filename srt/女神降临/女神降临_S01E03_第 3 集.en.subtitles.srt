1
00:00:47,964 --> 00:00:48,882
Did you see that?

2
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:51,009
-That's Soo-ho, right?
-What's happening?

3
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:52,510
-What is he doing?
-What is it?

4
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:13,490
He's awesome.

5
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:15,700
-Are you serious?
-Soo-ho just saved…

6
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:22,415
You're all just staring
and not helping your friend.

7
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:25,126
Get back into your classrooms.

8
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:28,004
-Go on!
-Yes, sir.

9
00:01:28,087 --> 00:01:30,965
Do you think that school is a playground?

10
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:03,915
I need to be quick.

11
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:09,087
Hey, Soo-ho.

12
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:15,093
-You sure are proactive lately.
-Did you come back to see me?

13
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,594
What?

14
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:18,680
Why do you care so much about what I do?

15
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:21,349
-What the hell?
-You could always ignore me.

16
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,144
Don't go around following my every move.

17
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,198
That was really close.

18
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:54,841
Thank you.

19
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:58,887
But why did you help me out?

20
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:02,390
Hey, you.

21
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:05,768
Never mind.

22
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:08,521
-Bring my helmet tomorrow--
-Will do.

23
00:03:09,188 --> 00:03:10,023
Hey!

24
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:11,691
My helmet…

25
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:18,990
Hey, Ju-kyung.

26
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:20,783
Are you all right?

27
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:25,747
I'm really sorry.

28
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,832
Don't ever pull that kind of prank again.

29
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,542
No worries. I'm really okay.

30
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:32,211
By the way, Soo-ho totally startled me.

31
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:34,255
I've never seen him help anyone out.

32
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:36,216
I'm right, aren't I?

33
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:39,135
It's probably because
the hall monitor was there.

34
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:45,850
Anyway, Ju-kyung looks pretty
even after being hit with a cake.

35
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:48,603
Are you okay, Ju-kyung?

36
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:50,855
-That must have been a shock.
-The cake hit her.

37
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:52,065
Come on, Hyun-kyu.

38
00:03:52,148 --> 00:03:54,317
-I told you.
-She's still a goddess.

39
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:57,237
Let's sit.

40
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:10,458
Did he perhaps help me
because he knew my true face?

41
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:23,554
Hey.

42
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,014
What the…

43
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,766
Hey, what's going on?

44
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:29,644
Here.

45
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,230
So what do you think?

46
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:35,233
He must have figured it out.
Otherwise, why would he help you?

47
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:36,734
Right?

48
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:38,486
When did he figure it out?

49
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:41,114
He seemed clueless not so long ago.

50
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:43,074
But why help me out, though?

51
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:46,369
He's not the type to help someone out.

52
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:47,829
People call him a sociopath.

53
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,623
To hold it against you.

54
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:52,625
Why?

55
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,919
It's not my fault I look ugly!

56
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:56,963
You're a fraud
for pretending to be pretty.

57
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:02,343
It's not as if I extorted money
or harmed anyone by applying makeup--

58
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:04,345
You did say you teased him shamelessly.

59
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:07,432
And the fact that he got conned.

60
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:09,642
That in itself can be very humiliating.

61
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:11,144
You're in big trouble now.

62
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:13,855
I'd rather he just
take it out on me right now.

63
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:17,817
Maybe he's planning
to take revenge on you.

64
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:20,069
Revenge?

65
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,279
What? How?

66
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:23,906
He's going to slowly close in on you

67
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,034
and turn you into a nervous wreck.

68
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:27,243
And then…

69
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:32,123
"Revenge is a dish best served cold."

70
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,542
That saying is there for a reason.

71
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:37,837
Gosh, it's killing me.

72
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:41,716
I'll be off then.

73
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,134
Bye.

74
00:05:46,345 --> 00:05:48,556
Unbelievable. Are you close with her?

75
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,391
She's a beauty. Can you hook me up?

76
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:51,893
I want to ask her out.

77
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:56,064
What? Ask her out? You have a girlfriend.

78
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:59,067
Now, English is not that hard.

79
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,277
So just trust me and follow my lead, okay?

80
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,320
-Yes.
-Yes.

81
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:03,571
All right, now.

82
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:06,282
Singular comes from
the Latin word singularis…

83
00:06:06,365 --> 00:06:08,034
Does he really know?

84
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:10,453
No, he can't know that for sure.

85
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:12,538
What if he knows?

86
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:15,666
Plural comes from the Latin word pluralis.

87
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:18,377
Which means more than one.

88
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:19,504
PLURAL, REVENGE, PLURAL…

89
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:20,713
So…

90
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:25,676
When we have more than
one person or a thing,

91
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,346
we would use a plural noun.

92
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:32,308
Maybe he's planning
to take revenge on you.

93
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:34,519
Okay, Chapter One.

94
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:35,812
-Chapter One.
-Chapter One.

95
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,730
All right, now.

96
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:42,318
Grammatical numbers
are frequent themes on tests…

97
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:43,402
An earthquake?

98
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:47,365
Although they are not plural forms,

99
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:51,619
some words that have "s" at the end
are easily mistaken for the plural…

100
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:55,540
The most important thing
in a science experiment is safety.

101
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:57,625
Be careful not to hurt yourself or others.

102
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:59,043
-Yes.
-Yes.

103
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:02,505
When heating up the tube,
tilt it away from people

104
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:05,341
so that the liquid
won't splatter onto anyone.

105
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:06,384
-Yes.
-Yes.

106
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:09,095
Don't place the tube
right in the middle of the flame.

107
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:14,225
Heat it up from the side
and sway it lightly.

108
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:15,435
-Yes.
-Yes.

109
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:18,980
You have to submit your paper later,
so make sure to make neat notes.

110
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:22,984
He's going to slowly close in on you

111
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:25,736
and turn you into a nervous wreck.

112
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,447
And then…

113
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:30,950
Are you all right? Get her some towels.

114
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:32,285
-Let's wipe this up.
-Okay.

115
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:35,288
Hey, Ju-kyung?

116
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:38,082
-Yes?
-Are you feeling unwell?

117
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:41,461
I feel fine, thank you.

118
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,817
-I'm so sorry.
-You should be more careful.

119
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:06,777
-Sorry about that, Soo-ho!
-I'm sorry.

120
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,368
I'm going to…

121
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:56,661
Take revenge?

122
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:12,843
What's wrong, Ju-kyung?

123
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:16,222
Lim Ju-kyung.

124
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:24,897
I'm going to…

125
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:28,234
Ju-kyung, what's the matter?

126
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:33,656
Do you feel guilty or something?
Why do you keep running away from me?

127
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:35,241
What?

128
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:37,326
I'm going to lend you this.
The teacher told me to.

129
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,870
I've marked the chapters we covered
before you came here,

130
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:41,664
so give it back after making copies.

131
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:47,461
Copies.

132
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:04,061
PRINCE COMICS

133
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:06,731
What a long day.

134
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:25,416
I'm exhausted.

135
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:31,756
LEE SOO-HO

136
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:44,226
The number you have reached
is not in service--

137
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,853
Not funny, Lim Ju-bal.

138
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,149
Not funny, I see.

139
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:51,651
Meet me at the comics shop.

140
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:55,946
-Why?
-I have something for you.

141
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,449
No. You don't need to.

142
00:10:59,033 --> 00:10:59,992
I didn't say what it was.

143
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:01,827
I'll wait.

144
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,413
Hello? Soo-ho?

145
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:08,376
Gosh, what do I do?

146
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,753
Who cares? I didn't tell him to wait.

147
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:15,591
Wait, no.

148
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:21,263
I'll make sure he'll never even
dream of me being Lim Ju-kyung.

149
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:42,618
It's about to go out.

150
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:48,332
Hey, Ju-bal.
Can you mind the shop for a little bit?

151
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:52,002
Yes, Ju-bal is here!

152
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:54,797
I better fix this right away.

153
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:04,348
Hey.

154
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:06,267
It's been a while.

155
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:07,601
I wouldn't say that.

156
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:12,273
Has it not?

157
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,567
So, why did you want to see me?

158
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:18,154
Here.

159
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:20,531
It's best served cold.

160
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:23,534
-What, revenge?
-Tiramisu.

161
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:25,077
For Cursed Mask.

162
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:28,372
Tiramisu.

163
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,208
You shouldn't have.

164
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:38,591
You must have come right after school.
I've never seen you in uniform.

165
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:40,092
Really?

166
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:43,637
Of course. Your uniform's nice.

167
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:45,848
At my school…

168
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:49,101
there's someone who reminds me of you.

169
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:51,479
Really?

170
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:57,568
I have a very common face.
I actually get that a lot.

171
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:01,030
You must go to a co-ed school then.

172
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:02,615
Where do you go?

173
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:03,616
Saebom High.

174
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:06,202
I've never heard of it.

175
00:13:06,785 --> 00:13:08,579
It must not be around here.

176
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:10,706
And where do you go?

177
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:12,333
Me?

178
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:14,960
I…

179
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:19,798
You know Ttangkkeut Village, Haenam,
in Gyeongnam province?

180
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:23,010
-I go to school there.
-Isn't that in Jeonnam province?

181
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,304
Yes.

182
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:27,765
Ttangkkeut Village in Jeonnam, I mean…

183
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:29,725
Haenam.

184
00:13:29,808 --> 00:13:31,519
Haenam in Jeonnam province.

185
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:36,148
-So you transferred here?
-Transferred?

186
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:37,483
No, I dropped out.

187
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:39,860
Soon, I'll leave for Canada.

188
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:42,363
I'm staying with my grandma for now.

189
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:45,533
-Where in Canada?
-Where?

190
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:48,077
The capital.

191
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:49,870
To the capital.

192
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:51,830
-Vancouver.
-Ottawa.

193
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:53,249
Ottawa.

194
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,960
There.

195
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:01,340
Geography is not my forte.

196
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:04,677
Anyway, it was nice to meet
a fellow horror comics lover.

197
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:08,222
It's sad to think
I'll never see you again.

198
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:10,057
Why do I feel like
we'll see each other again?

199
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,892
You must be sad too.

200
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:14,562
-Come visit me in Otta after you graduate.
-Ottawa.

201
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:15,688
Yes, Ottawa.

202
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:18,023
I said Ottawa.

203
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:22,486
I better head back.

204
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:26,115
Thank you for this. Take care. Goodbye.

205
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:27,157
This is ridiculous.

206
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:34,081
Lim Ju-kyung.

207
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,224
You're bad at acting.

208
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,144
You're Lim Ju-kyung.

209
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,068
No, I'm Lim Ju-bal.

210
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:07,239
I called you using a number
I got from school.

211
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:08,741
Yet you show up.

212
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:10,159
How will you explain that?

213
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:14,121
-I can explain.
-Go ahead.

214
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:16,624
We're cousins.

215
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:19,710
Mine broke, so I'm using Ju-kyung's phone.

216
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:22,463
-I'm supposed to believe that?
-What's stopping you?

217
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:23,756
You have the same voice.

218
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,591
It runs in the family.

219
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:29,762
-So you're saying I'm wrong?
-One hundred percent.

220
00:15:58,123 --> 00:15:58,958
But…

221
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:12,137
in my eyes…

222
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,401
you are Lim Ju-kyung.

223
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:46,130
Lim Ju-kyung,
I know you're here instead of studying.

224
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:48,007
Lim Ju-kyung!

225
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:53,178
Yes, I am Lim Ju-kyung.

226
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:54,263
So what?

227
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:56,974
Are you going to report me
for pretending to be a goddess?

228
00:16:57,057 --> 00:17:00,144
What are you going to do about it?

229
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:01,645
What will you do?

230
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:09,611
That's great, Ju-kyung.

231
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:12,281
You better head home straight away!

232
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:28,881
I'm done for.

233
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:38,348
What's wrong with my life?

234
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:48,400
I just bought this.

235
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,029
She must have it out for my jackets.

236
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:28,857
CURSED MASK

237
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:31,110
Thanks for keeping a secret
about my no-makeup face!

238
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:35,114
Hey, wait up.

239
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:38,117
I brought the wrong thing.

240
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,368
Give it back.

241
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:41,829
There are menstrual pads inside.

242
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:44,915
I'll bring the right one tomorrow.

243
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:56,718
Hey, Soo-ho.

244
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,805
Do you know Ju-kyung's number?

245
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:02,349
I'll take it off in the restroom.

246
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:07,855
-What was that?
-Isn't being ugly bad enough?

247
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:13,360
Seriously, what's with my life?

248
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:27,124
Goodness.

249
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:30,544
You scared me.

250
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:34,173
I sent you home to study.
What are you doing here on the floor?

251
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:35,799
Mom?

252
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:39,428
Can I please drop out?

253
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,181
Wait, what is this sewer smell?

254
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:45,642
This place is a dump.

255
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:52,274
You scared the heck out of me.

256
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:54,860
What's with you?

257
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:56,361
Hey, sis.

258
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:59,364
Can you just step on me and kill me?

259
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:00,699
Whatever.

260
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:03,702
Mom, I'm home. What are you doing?

261
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:06,121
The sewer smell is coming up.

262
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:07,539
What do we do?

263
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:09,541
You're right, I smell it too.

264
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:10,626
What do we do?

265
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:11,960
Gosh, it's seriously bad.

266
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:15,923
The sewer smell is
more important than I am.

267
00:20:17,674 --> 00:20:19,468
Of course, it is.

268
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:24,264
Gosh, what now, Mom?

269
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:50,624
Ju-kyung?

270
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:52,960
-Ju-kyung.
-Yes?

271
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:54,920
Why are you staring off into space?

272
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:56,838
Go tell your sister that dinner's ready.

273
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:58,799
Okay.

274
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:00,842
Really?

275
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,012
What's with her?

276
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:08,225
What's gotten into her head, not studying?

277
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:12,479
She's just like her dad
in making me upset.

278
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:14,231
Honey, you're getting heated again.

279
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:16,191
Drink some cold water to cool you down.

280
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:17,359
That's good.

281
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:19,695
-Nice and cool.
-It's too cold!

282
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:27,452
Hee-kyung,

283
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:30,330
Mom says dinner's ready.

284
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:39,172
Darn it. I said not to dive into it.

285
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:41,258
That ridiculous idiot.

286
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:45,679
Don't be afraid. The end of fear is ruin.

287
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:46,596
Ruin?

288
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:49,349
You think I'll end the game like this?

289
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:51,393
Here I go. I'll carry out solo kills.

290
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:55,814
-Darn it!
-The end of fear

291
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:58,900
is ruin and only ruin.

292
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:01,445
Yes,

293
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,947
let's not be afraid.

294
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:07,993
Feel the power of my blade!

295
00:22:27,095 --> 00:22:30,474
Eat the veggies and raw kimchi first
before they spoil.

296
00:22:36,104 --> 00:22:37,939
You didn't eat what I brought last time.

297
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:40,275
-I've been eating out.
-Were they not good?

298
00:22:40,358 --> 00:22:41,193
No.

299
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:43,820
I mean, they were good.

300
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:47,282
A cleaning lady should stick to cleaning

301
00:22:47,365 --> 00:22:49,868
and not bring those awful things, right?

302
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:51,369
They tasted great.

303
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:53,663
I mean it.

304
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:54,790
Right?

305
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:57,250
Make sure not to skip your meals
even if you're busy.

306
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:06,593
MESSAGE

307
00:23:06,676 --> 00:23:09,429
I have something to say.
Let's meet before school.

308
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:12,474
-I'll get going.
- Wait.

309
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:16,061
Do you not want me to clean
that room today either?

310
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:21,108
Yes. I'll do it.

311
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:22,359
Don't go in there.

312
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:31,409
Hey, you! What did you do to your eyes?

313
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:33,078
You look like you got punched.

314
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:35,539
Sweetheart, that's a makeup trend.

315
00:23:36,414 --> 00:23:37,666
Smoky makeup.

316
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:39,126
Erase that before you go!

317
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:40,252
Silence!

318
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:43,922
Don't stop me now.

319
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:45,924
I'm on my way…

320
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:49,136
to end someone.

321
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:52,681
As if.

322
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:53,974
You go, girl!

323
00:24:07,445 --> 00:24:08,363
Lee Soo-ho!

324
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:24,462
The end of fear…

325
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:26,631
is ruin.

326
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:42,731
The sword has been drawn.

327
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:47,694
There's no turning back.

328
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:56,745
If you say a word about my no-makeup face,

329
00:24:57,537 --> 00:24:58,663
I will…

330
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:10,675
You will what?

331
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:16,640
The end of fear…

332
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:18,725
is ruin?

333
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:28,777
Well,

334
00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:31,404
I'm not saying I'll do something.

335
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:35,867
I'm on my knees begging you not to tell.

336
00:25:36,534 --> 00:25:38,536
It might seem small
to a good-looking guy like you,

337
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,622
but it's a matter of life or death for me.

338
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:42,374
I beg of you.

339
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:43,375
Seriously?

340
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:44,876
Must I?

341
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:46,795
Why?

342
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:49,965
Why should I do you a favor
when you deceived me with two faces?

343
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:51,132
Please.

344
00:25:52,425 --> 00:25:55,303
Can you have mercy on me
like the generous man that you are?

345
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:58,932
I'll do anything you ask
if you keep my secret.

346
00:26:01,184 --> 00:26:02,102
Just get up.

347
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:04,771
Yes.

348
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:07,941
He is one of the two towers.
Savior Soo-ho.

349
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:12,404
Please have mercy on me.

350
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:19,744
You'll do anything I say?

351
00:26:53,236 --> 00:26:54,362
What's this?

352
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:57,991
Did you read my mind or something?

353
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:02,120
How in the world did you bring me here?

354
00:27:02,203 --> 00:27:03,413
Goodness.

355
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:24,142
Jackpot.

356
00:27:36,112 --> 00:27:37,155
Can I give you a hand?

357
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:40,992
No, that's okay.
I'm calling my insurance company.

358
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:43,244
Who has the time for all that?
Aren't you busy?

359
00:28:07,727 --> 00:28:10,021
What are you doing?
Get your spare tire out.

360
00:28:11,564 --> 00:28:12,399
Sure.

361
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:24,494
Here's the tire.

362
00:28:24,577 --> 00:28:26,413
I'm sorry. One second.

363
00:28:32,168 --> 00:28:33,086
Gosh.

364
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:35,213
How is he so cute?

365
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:42,053
-You've never replaced one, have you?
-No.

366
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:44,889
I actually don't drive often.

367
00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:55,442
How can she do that
with such small wrists?

368
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:58,611
She's so strong.

369
00:29:00,363 --> 00:29:01,948
-Cute, right?
-Yes.

370
00:29:02,031 --> 00:29:03,533
Where does he go?

371
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:21,801
Can't have you hurt your precious eyes.

372
00:29:22,385 --> 00:29:23,470
Well, then.

373
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:32,854
He'll take pity on me
and not spread the word.

374
00:29:35,231 --> 00:29:37,734
Look how merciless he looks.

375
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:13,394
Please drink this while you work on it.

376
00:30:14,103 --> 00:30:15,021
Thank you.

377
00:30:29,744 --> 00:30:30,662
Here.

378
00:30:30,745 --> 00:30:31,871
Okay.

379
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:33,873
Do you teach here?

380
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:37,001
Yes. I teach literature here.

381
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:39,504
I knew you were in liberal arts.

382
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:44,175
By the way,
this car was discontinued long ago.

383
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:45,593
Are you into classic cars?

384
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:46,761
No.

385
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:48,346
Well, it's…

386
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:52,058
the first car my dad bought in 1995.

387
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:54,435
I have lots of memories with it,

388
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:56,646
so I couldn't just get rid of it.

389
00:30:56,729 --> 00:30:58,398
I take it out for a spin sometimes.

390
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:01,568
But all of a sudden, it causes trouble.

391
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:04,195
But I guess this will also
form a good memory.

392
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:05,530
I don't like that.

393
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:07,198
Excuse me?

394
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:10,702
I rather want it to be a beginning
rather than a memory.

395
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:12,871
"A beginning rather than a memory."

396
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:16,124
That has a nice ring to it.

397
00:31:18,334 --> 00:31:19,168
Well…

398
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:20,837
what kind of beginning?

399
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:22,547
It's all fixed.

400
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:27,051
Thank you. How can I repay you?

401
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:28,553
Why don't you buy me dinner?

402
00:31:29,512 --> 00:31:31,556
-Excuse me?
-Here, type it in.

403
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:32,515
Your number.

404
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:36,311
Okay.

405
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:40,690
Here you go.

406
00:31:43,526 --> 00:31:44,402
Sparks.

407
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:46,946
If we get another spark,

408
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:48,740
we'll start dating, okay?

409
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:51,326
Excuse me?

410
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:54,829
Hello?

411
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:57,206
Yes, I see. I'll be right there.

412
00:31:57,707 --> 00:31:58,541
Your name is?

413
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:00,418
Han Jun-woo.

414
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:03,087
Then I'll wait for your call, Han Jun-woo.

415
00:32:03,838 --> 00:32:04,714
Bye.

416
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:10,178
Consider what I said about a beginning.

417
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:18,061
This feels surreal.

418
00:32:24,525 --> 00:32:25,860
ECONOMIC CHANGES IN THE EARLY JOSEON ERA

419
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:28,529
The important factors
of early Joseon's economy are

420
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:31,741
the tax system and the land system.

421
00:32:31,824 --> 00:32:34,118
The tax laws created
under the rule of King Sejong

422
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:37,246
are the nine-level year law
and the six-level land law.

423
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:40,500
Firstly, the nine-level year law
is based on

424
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:43,920
-I'm thirsty.
-how good of a harvest…

425
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:47,799
What's wrong?

426
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:52,720
Sir, can I go to the restroom, please?

427
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:53,721
Sure, go ahead.

428
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:02,772
In the Joseon era,
ladies couldn't say such things.

429
00:33:02,855 --> 00:33:03,982
It's not an issue today.

430
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:06,025
Hey, let me go too. I have to pee as well.

431
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:07,235
I'll see you next class.

432
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:08,569
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

433
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:15,660
Get out of my way.

434
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:23,251
You must have been so thirsty.

435
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:25,962
It's your favorite drink. Enjoy.

436
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:27,922
Have a good one today.

437
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:37,807
Hold it higher. I can't see.

438
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:39,642
-Like this? How's it now?
-I can't see.

439
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:42,103
-No, I can't see.
-Like this? How about now?

440
00:33:43,062 --> 00:33:44,022
Jeez.

441
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:46,774
-Helmet?
-Sorry, my bad.

442
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,194
Hey,

443
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,113
where's my helmet?

444
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:54,782
Right, the helmet.

445
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:58,995
I was so busy and I forgot.

446
00:33:59,078 --> 00:34:00,038
You forgot?

447
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:02,874
You must be out of your mind.

448
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:05,376
I'm really sorry.

449
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:10,339
You think I'm a pushover
because I'm being nice?

450
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:13,509
A pushover? Of course not.

451
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:17,055
I'll bring it tomorrow. I mean it.

452
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:18,806
If you don't bring it tomorrow,

453
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:20,558
you'll pay for it.

454
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:22,810
Okay. Got it.

455
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:34,113
Why are you being so tough on her?

456
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:36,532
She's obviously trying to get
your attention with that helmet.

457
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:38,576
She took my helmet to get my attention?

458
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:39,869
She just got me upset.

459
00:34:39,952 --> 00:34:42,038
Why would the goddess steal
the woodcutter's clothes?

460
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:44,999
It's because she had her eyes
set on the big picture.

461
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:47,502
But wasn't it the other way around?

462
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:49,879
Who the heck…

463
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:52,340
It's just old me.

464
00:34:53,674 --> 00:34:54,842
Hello, sir.

465
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:56,302
-Hello.
-Hello.

466
00:34:56,385 --> 00:34:57,929
Button up. Go ahead and button up.

467
00:34:58,012 --> 00:34:59,430
You're at school, not a sauna!

468
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:02,892
I'm sorry.

469
00:35:09,565 --> 00:35:10,399
I'm sorry!

470
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:30,878
Mission accomplished.

471
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:36,008
What was that?

472
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:38,761
-What are you smiling at?
-What do you mean?

473
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:41,097
Hey, I heard you snicker just now.

474
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:44,809
I got goosebumps hearing you laugh
for the first time in a year.

475
00:35:44,892 --> 00:35:46,477
What was it? Tell me.

476
00:35:47,895 --> 00:35:49,480
Come on, what were you watching?

477
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:52,400
Gosh. Whatever.

478
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:54,068
Bye.

479
00:36:04,036 --> 00:36:05,079
FATHER

480
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:09,125
Come home early.
We'll have dinner with Mr. Choi.

481
00:36:12,461 --> 00:36:13,421
I will.

482
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:21,637
-What was that?
-Are you okay?

483
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:24,473
Su-jin, wasn't Korean History
super boring?

484
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:26,184
I seriously slept through it.

485
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:47,288
Kangsu!

486
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:50,333
Kangsu!

487
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:53,377
Are you zoning out?

488
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:01,510
No. I was just trying to remove
a stain from my hands.

489
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:06,390
Not here.

490
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:13,481
Where is it?

491
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:16,776
How can such a big thing disappear?

492
00:37:21,155 --> 00:37:24,617
Hey, I ironed your skirt.
The pleats are sharp as a knife.

493
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:25,826
Be careful not to cut yourself.

494
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:29,872
Dad, do you know
where the helmet in my room went?

495
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:32,708
That?

496
00:37:36,879 --> 00:37:37,755
Hey, Ju-young!

497
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:40,758
-You little punk!
-What was that for?

498
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:42,468
You come here, you dumbass.

499
00:37:42,551 --> 00:37:44,428
-Why did you sell the helmet?
-So what?

500
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:46,389
You said you got it off the streets.

501
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:48,766
You come here.

502
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:51,519
-Who did you sell it to?
-Hey, you two.

503
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:52,937
I sold it online. Why?

504
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:55,564
I'm your older sister.

505
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:56,565
Come here.

506
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:57,900
You come right here.

507
00:37:57,984 --> 00:37:59,151
Break it off, guys.

508
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:00,444
-Get it back.
-Stop--

509
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:02,071
Get it back!

510
00:38:02,154 --> 00:38:03,364
Are you crazy?

511
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:06,117
Hey, you're pulling all my hair!

512
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,368
Like I care!

513
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:09,036
Everyone stop!

514
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:17,753
How dare you little ones fight
in front of your mom and dad?

515
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:19,922
-Mom, he…
-You started it.

516
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:21,507
Honey,

517
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:23,467
bring it out.

518
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:27,096
-Please.
-Not that.

519
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:29,056
Come on, hurry up!

520
00:38:43,195 --> 00:38:45,614
-I love you.
-I love you.

521
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:53,289
-I love you.
-I love you.

522
00:38:54,957 --> 00:38:55,833
I'm home.

523
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:58,044
I love you.

524
00:38:58,711 --> 00:39:00,004
I love you.

525
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:01,589
I guess they fought again.

526
00:39:02,256 --> 00:39:04,091
Keep it going. Love each other.

527
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:08,512
-I love you.
-I love…

528
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:10,097
You're tickling me. Do it right.

529
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:11,515
I love you.

530
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:14,769
Didn't you wash your feet?

531
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:16,187
I love you.

532
00:39:19,648 --> 00:39:22,985
The helmet belongs to Han Seo-jun,
so bring it back no matter what.

533
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:24,403
It's Han Seo-jun's?

534
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:27,031
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

535
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:29,867
Watch it.

536
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:32,495
Put it right here.

537
00:39:35,122 --> 00:39:35,998
LEE SOO-HO

538
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:37,500
Garden of Blood Volume Three.

539
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:39,585
-Playground in ten minutes.
-In ten minutes?

540
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:46,092
I love you, my little brother.

541
00:39:46,175 --> 00:39:47,551
We made up. Okay, Mom?

542
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:49,303
Hey, Lim Ju-kyung!

543
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:51,472
-That brat!
-Honey!

544
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:55,393
-Don't tear the pages, got it?
-Got it.

545
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:56,894
No!

546
00:39:56,977 --> 00:39:58,145
Hey,

547
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:01,357
can you please let me have this book?

548
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,765
LEE SOO-HO

549
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:36,225
It's been ten minutes.

550
00:40:44,316 --> 00:40:46,610
Hey, cutie pie…

551
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:49,447
Who are you calling a cutie pie?
Do you know how old I am?

552
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:55,077
Hey, cool kid.
Can you please let me have this book?

553
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:56,495
I'm not sure.

554
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:00,291
Hey, I got you the ice cream--

555
00:41:00,374 --> 00:41:02,293
I said I'll think about it.

556
00:41:02,918 --> 00:41:04,128
And I'm thinking about it.

557
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:09,383
This little brat.

558
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,427
Are you getting mad at me?

559
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:16,390
I was going to let you have it
considering your situation.

560
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:18,142
But I don't want to anymore.

561
00:41:18,225 --> 00:41:19,894
Hey, please.

562
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:23,314
What can I do to change your mind?

563
00:41:24,064 --> 00:41:25,524
Make you laugh?

564
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:26,901
Look at this!

565
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:28,319
That's not funny.

566
00:41:28,402 --> 00:41:30,404
That's from forever ago.

567
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:33,282
How about my zombie act?

568
00:41:34,241 --> 00:41:35,159
Watch this.

569
00:41:40,372 --> 00:41:41,832
That's great.

570
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:43,834
Do it once more!

571
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:47,922
One more time!

572
00:41:50,633 --> 00:41:51,967
How do you do that?

573
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:55,304
Got something else?

574
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:58,057
Do it once more.

575
00:41:58,682 --> 00:41:59,683
Then…

576
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:02,770
Just once more, okay?

577
00:42:09,151 --> 00:42:09,985
You're late.

578
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:11,987
I'm sorry.

579
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:14,823
I got into an argument with a little kid.

580
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:17,326
Here you go. Bye.

581
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:18,786
Wait…

582
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:29,129
-Isn't it great to be back at school?
-So nice.

583
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:31,090
-Even the air is fresher.
-Stop it.

584
00:42:31,173 --> 00:42:32,883
-This fresh air…
-Come on, stop it.

585
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:34,802
Seriously, stop it.

586
00:42:36,136 --> 00:42:38,055
Hey, the thing is…

587
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:43,727
There's no way you could have folded up
my helmet and put it in your pocket.

588
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:47,356
I couldn't bring myself to say it.

589
00:42:49,608 --> 00:42:50,568
Here.

590
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:52,194
Read this after I leave.

591
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:54,488
What is this?

592
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:56,448
A love letter!

593
00:42:56,532 --> 00:42:58,158
You're still so popular!

594
00:42:58,242 --> 00:43:00,536
-Still popular!
-Still popular!

595
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:04,081
-What did she say?
-Don't look.

596
00:43:04,164 --> 00:43:05,416
-Why not?
-Hey, don't look.

597
00:43:05,499 --> 00:43:06,917
There's an old saying

598
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:09,920
that patience is a virtue.

599
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:12,673
Please read my letter
with this saying in mind.

600
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:16,510
Turns out, my little brother
sold your helmet online.

601
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:17,803
I'm really sorry.

602
00:43:17,886 --> 00:43:19,847
I'll bring it back to you within a week.

603
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:24,935
So please be patient with me
and be virtuous.

604
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:26,437
PS. Please don't hurt me!

605
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:28,480
Hey, what did she say?

606
00:43:28,564 --> 00:43:31,734
-I want to see a real love letter.
-What's there to see? It's obvious.

607
00:43:31,817 --> 00:43:32,693
Come on!

608
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:34,862
I've never received one in my life.

609
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:35,821
Just once. Please?

610
00:43:35,904 --> 00:43:36,739
Stop it!

611
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:39,533
-Whatever.
-Show me what a love letter looks like!

612
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:40,951
Show me!

613
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:42,077
Come on.

614
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:47,374
-Read it to us!
-Read it to us!

615
00:43:57,718 --> 00:43:59,303
Another day begins.

616
00:44:08,937 --> 00:44:10,314
Hey, over here.

617
00:44:10,397 --> 00:44:11,565
It's spicy pork.

618
00:44:12,524 --> 00:44:14,360
It's on the menu whenever I'm on a diet.

619
00:44:14,443 --> 00:44:16,320
No, it's about the same.

620
00:44:16,403 --> 00:44:17,988
Earphones from the classroom.

621
00:44:25,871 --> 00:44:27,748
ARE YOU LEAVING ME ON READ?

622
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:30,417
BUT IT'S SPICY PORK

623
00:44:35,422 --> 00:44:37,341
Where are you going, Ju-kyung?

624
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:39,176
What the…

625
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:46,558
Hey, Ju-young!
Did you get the helmet back?

626
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:49,395
I'll get it, just wait.

627
00:44:49,478 --> 00:44:52,231
How dare you raise your voice at me?

628
00:44:52,314 --> 00:44:53,732
Have you seriously lost it?

629
00:45:02,157 --> 00:45:04,493
-It came out well.
-I told you so.

630
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:12,209
Here.

631
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:14,711
Wait…

632
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:22,719
We move ahead, going straight

633
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:24,847
-No lights here, at all
-At all

634
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:28,517
A dazzling sunshine shining

635
00:45:32,354 --> 00:45:35,107
What's that about?
Why's your boyfriend skipping lunch again?

636
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:37,443
He's rehearsing for
the talent show audition.

637
00:45:37,526 --> 00:45:40,487
There are so many applicants,
so they're only choosing five teams.

638
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:43,115
Ju-kyung, how come you look so down?

639
00:45:43,198 --> 00:45:44,241
Did something happen?

640
00:45:46,618 --> 00:45:48,412
No. Nothing at all.

641
00:45:48,495 --> 00:45:49,538
She's just hungry.

642
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:53,584
Wait, I need to go somewhere.

643
00:45:53,667 --> 00:45:54,668
Gosh, she scared me.

644
00:45:54,751 --> 00:45:56,712
-Limju, what about lunch?
-What was that?

645
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:00,340
Hasn't she been acting weird lately?

646
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:08,015
-My helmet.
-I told you I'd get it back in the letter.

647
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:08,932
What?

648
00:46:15,314 --> 00:46:18,108
I'm really sorry. That came out wrong.

649
00:46:18,942 --> 00:46:21,111
Please be patient
and I'll bring it back to you.

650
00:46:21,778 --> 00:46:22,821
Sorry.

651
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:27,534
What was that?

652
00:46:31,163 --> 00:46:34,541
Pass it over here. One more.

653
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:36,460
Hey Seo-jun, are you some kind of thug?

654
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:40,672
You made the whole class
cower last semester,

655
00:46:41,381 --> 00:46:43,300
and now you're stealing
from a new student?

656
00:46:44,176 --> 00:46:47,638
Acting like some sort of gang leader
by having these idiots follow you around

657
00:46:47,721 --> 00:46:49,640
just makes you look pathetic.

658
00:46:50,557 --> 00:46:53,060
If I see you bullying
other students ever again,

659
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:55,812
I'll report you to the school
and embarrass you publicly.

660
00:46:55,896 --> 00:46:57,981
Got that, you ridiculous poopheads?

661
00:46:58,565 --> 00:47:01,109
Poopheads? Who are you calling poopheads?

662
00:47:01,193 --> 00:47:02,402
What did she say?

663
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:04,780
-She called us poopheads.
-Poop what?

664
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:09,201
She's so cool.

665
00:47:19,044 --> 00:47:20,254
What do you want me to do?

666
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:21,755
Clean this up?

667
00:47:21,838 --> 00:47:22,965
They're for you to eat.

668
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:26,843
These are for me? Really?

669
00:47:26,927 --> 00:47:27,761
What's with you?

670
00:47:28,428 --> 00:47:30,514
Food disposal. These are leftovers.

671
00:47:31,306 --> 00:47:32,224
Of course, it is.

672
00:47:32,849 --> 00:47:35,143
For a second,
I thought you were treating me.

673
00:47:39,147 --> 00:47:41,191
-This is good.
-Doubt it.

674
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:42,317
It's really delicious.

675
00:47:42,401 --> 00:47:44,695
Why would you not eat these
and throw them out?

676
00:47:44,778 --> 00:47:45,696
You must be joking.

677
00:47:46,655 --> 00:47:47,698
So yummy.

678
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:50,117
I'm going to mix these all together.

679
00:47:54,788 --> 00:47:57,374
-Seriously?
-You have no idea.

680
00:47:57,457 --> 00:47:59,626
It's the best way
to take care of leftovers.

681
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:06,133
Ta-da!

682
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:07,551
Help yourself.

683
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:10,470
-Why? Won't you have any?
-No.

684
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:12,180
You've never tried this, have you?

685
00:48:12,264 --> 00:48:15,475
Once you try it,
you'll come back for more.

686
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:17,019
Come on. Try some.

687
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:18,687
Eat it yourself.

688
00:48:24,276 --> 00:48:26,320
Unbelievable. It's so tasty.

689
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:27,529
Yum.

690
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:32,034
Come on, try some.

691
00:48:32,117 --> 00:48:35,162
Even if it's garbage disposal,
I can't eat it all by myself.

692
00:48:35,245 --> 00:48:36,747
Here, go ahead. Try some.

693
00:48:54,056 --> 00:48:54,890
How is it?

694
00:48:58,393 --> 00:49:00,437
-Weird.
-Weird?

695
00:49:02,731 --> 00:49:04,608
It tastes good to me.

696
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:06,568
It's weird that it's this good.

697
00:49:12,699 --> 00:49:13,742
I mixed it well, huh?

698
00:49:14,409 --> 00:49:15,744
Don't you snort it out today.

699
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:20,874
Try the glass noodles too.

700
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:40,602
By the way,

701
00:49:41,436 --> 00:49:42,896
how are you feeling right now?

702
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:46,983
Good or bad?

703
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:50,153
-Why do you ask?
-Just because.

704
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:52,447
Good or bad?

705
00:50:00,205 --> 00:50:01,164
Here's the deal.

706
00:50:02,457 --> 00:50:04,000
Let's call it even with a big one.

707
00:50:04,084 --> 00:50:05,335
What do you mean?

708
00:50:05,419 --> 00:50:08,171
I did say that I'd do anything you asked,

709
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:10,257
but sending me on little errands

710
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:12,509
is beneath a smart
and handsome person like you.

711
00:50:12,592 --> 00:50:14,845
You wouldn't want this
to go on forever, right?

712
00:50:14,928 --> 00:50:18,181
You'd have to keep me around,
which would mean a lifelong headache.

713
00:50:18,890 --> 00:50:20,767
So call it even with a big one?

714
00:50:21,643 --> 00:50:22,519
Right.

715
00:50:23,437 --> 00:50:28,442
Something difficult like acquiring
another first print of old horror comics.

716
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:30,277
Must I? I don't want to.

717
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:34,698
Come on, think about it. Please?

718
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:40,704
Okay, let's call it even.

719
00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:42,706
Call it even? Really?

720
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:45,041
What do you want? What's your mission?

721
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:57,846
Why are you tapping the table?

722
00:50:58,805 --> 00:51:02,976
TALENT SHOW AUDITION

723
00:51:11,651 --> 00:51:14,362
You trusted me

724
00:51:14,988 --> 00:51:19,910
And you waited for me, my love

725
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:28,168
Before I tell you I'm sorry

726
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:29,961
I want to say

727
00:51:30,045 --> 00:51:30,962
-Last night
-Last night

728
00:51:31,046 --> 00:51:32,798
-I started hating you
-I started hating you

729
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:37,093
-Spinning round and round
-Spinning round and round

730
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:39,888
Hey.

731
00:51:40,722 --> 00:51:41,932
Next!

732
00:51:42,015 --> 00:51:43,016
-Gang!
-Gang!

733
00:51:43,099 --> 00:51:44,935
Gosh, I'm so nervous…

734
00:51:58,865 --> 00:52:04,496
Seeing him confess to me

735
00:52:04,579 --> 00:52:08,291
I thought of you

736
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:12,045
And held back my tears

737
00:52:12,128 --> 00:52:15,882
His eyes were waiting

738
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:17,884
-She's terrible.
-For my answer

739
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:21,471
I felt so guilty

740
00:52:21,555 --> 00:52:27,769
I couldn't say anything

741
00:52:31,523 --> 00:52:32,774
This won't cut it.

742
00:52:34,109 --> 00:52:35,026
I'm done for.

743
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:37,112
We move ahead, going straight

744
00:52:37,195 --> 00:52:38,488
-No lights here, at all
-At all

745
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:40,615
-A dazzling sunshine shining
-Swag

746
00:52:40,699 --> 00:52:42,617
-Dazzling, dazzling, can't breathe, 911
-911

747
00:52:42,701 --> 00:52:44,953
-What I probably need is Su-ah
-Su-ah

748
00:52:53,378 --> 00:52:54,796
This won't be easy.

749
00:52:59,259 --> 00:53:00,760
Did I drink too much water?

750
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:03,013
I could make it in time, right?

751
00:53:04,514 --> 00:53:06,600
You guys go ahead.

752
00:53:08,226 --> 00:53:09,644
The next team may come in.

753
00:53:11,771 --> 00:53:13,315
-Let's go.
-I'm so nervous!

754
00:53:13,398 --> 00:53:14,733
-Break a leg!
-Break a leg!

755
00:53:15,317 --> 00:53:16,443
What should we get?

756
00:53:19,446 --> 00:53:20,572
"The end of fear…

757
00:53:22,449 --> 00:53:23,700
is ruin."

758
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:26,745
I can do it.

759
00:53:27,954 --> 00:53:29,122
Come on!

760
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:44,554
What's going on?

761
00:53:44,638 --> 00:53:46,431
It can't be over already, can it?

762
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:31,494
Please pick me.

763
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:34,581
I'm Lim Ju-kyung from junior class five.

764
00:55:34,664 --> 00:55:36,916
Save me in your hearts!

765
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,251
EDUCATION AND RESEARCH DEPARTMENT

766
00:55:38,918 --> 00:55:39,794
Delete.

767
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:48,720
Vice Principal,
I said "delete" right away.

768
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:53,099
I dare say Ju-kyung dances really well.

769
00:55:54,893 --> 00:55:56,061
This is what I'm saying.

770
00:55:56,895 --> 00:55:59,230
The last nationwide exam results
were disappointing.

771
00:55:59,981 --> 00:56:05,153
How many students can we possibly send
to universities in Seoul this year?

772
00:56:05,236 --> 00:56:07,280
Reflect on yourselves!

773
00:56:10,533 --> 00:56:11,868
I'm sorry.

774
00:56:12,952 --> 00:56:13,787
So sorry.

775
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:14,829
-You.
-Yes, sir.

776
00:56:14,913 --> 00:56:17,582
I asked you to improve
the average grades of the students.

777
00:56:17,665 --> 00:56:20,168
What's going on? Put in more effort!

778
00:56:26,007 --> 00:56:27,425
That was super embarrassing.

779
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:10,510
I'll be discharged soon.
You didn't have to come.

780
00:57:10,593 --> 00:57:12,929
I wanted to see you
even if it's just for a moment.

781
00:57:13,721 --> 00:57:15,014
How did you feel today?

782
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:16,516
I felt great.

783
00:57:17,183 --> 00:57:18,393
How's school treating you?

784
00:57:18,977 --> 00:57:20,687
Well, it's the same.

785
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:24,482
I love seeing my son in uniform.

786
00:57:25,066 --> 00:57:26,901
I have a good physique, that's why.

787
00:57:26,985 --> 00:57:29,362
I'd still look like a model even in rags.

788
00:57:30,321 --> 00:57:34,033
I'm thankful for whoever gave birth to me.

789
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:35,118
Goodness.

790
00:57:36,786 --> 00:57:38,830
I'll get some sleep now, so head home.

791
00:57:39,414 --> 00:57:40,957
I'll stay and watch you sleep.

792
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:43,001
I can't fall asleep with you around.

793
00:57:43,084 --> 00:57:45,587
Don't leave Go-un alone late at night.

794
00:57:47,213 --> 00:57:48,214
Got it.

795
00:57:48,798 --> 00:57:49,632
Sleep tight.

796
00:57:49,716 --> 00:57:52,135
You didn't ride your motorcycle here,
did you?

797
00:57:52,635 --> 00:57:55,013
It's dangerous. Please don't do it, okay?

798
00:57:55,096 --> 00:57:56,347
Don't you worry.

799
00:58:10,028 --> 00:58:11,613
That's Lee Ju-hun!

800
00:58:11,696 --> 00:58:12,864
Hey, let's get a picture.

801
00:58:12,947 --> 00:58:14,032
VIP WARD

802
00:58:14,115 --> 00:58:16,409
-Hi, we're big fans.
-Can we take pictures?

803
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:18,036
Please don't do this here.

804
00:58:18,119 --> 00:58:19,996
- It's okay.
-Thank you!

805
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:22,165
One, two, three.

806
00:58:22,665 --> 00:58:24,417
-Thanks a lot!
-Thank you.

807
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:28,796
We are grateful for your donation.

808
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:30,173
My pleasure.

809
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:40,308
UNDERSTANDING AROMAS

810
00:58:49,275 --> 00:58:52,320
Understanding Aromas?

811
00:58:53,196 --> 00:58:54,948
-Why are you reading this, Dad?
-Well…

812
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:59,702
I signed up for a class
on making scented candles.

813
00:58:59,786 --> 00:59:01,871
-You signed up for a class?
-A class?

814
00:59:01,955 --> 00:59:04,374
Where did you get the money?

815
00:59:07,252 --> 00:59:09,128
Did you take some from my wallet?

816
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:12,590
Honey, the children are listening.

817
00:59:13,883 --> 00:59:15,176
I just borrowed some.

818
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:17,053
I knew it.

819
00:59:17,136 --> 00:59:19,055
I couldn't account for the missing money.

820
00:59:19,138 --> 00:59:21,891
And what if the kids are listening?
Are you even embarrassed?

821
00:59:23,351 --> 00:59:25,395
Before understanding aromas,

822
00:59:25,478 --> 00:59:28,022
try to understand how I must feel.

823
00:59:28,106 --> 00:59:30,400
That's rich, an unemployed man
enjoying a hobby.

824
00:59:30,483 --> 00:59:31,859
It's not a hobby.

825
00:59:32,443 --> 00:59:34,821
I'm trying things out to make a living.

826
00:59:34,904 --> 00:59:36,573
You could always be a homemaker!

827
00:59:36,656 --> 00:59:40,368
Mom, it's hard just staying at home.

828
00:59:40,451 --> 00:59:42,954
Who knows, he might make it big
with scented candles.

829
00:59:43,037 --> 00:59:44,914
Dad, I'm rooting for you!

830
00:59:44,998 --> 00:59:45,957
Thanks, Hee-kyung.

831
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:48,960
The more I study,
the more amazed I am by scented candles.

832
00:59:49,043 --> 00:59:52,297
In 5000 BC, in Afghanistan…

833
00:59:53,298 --> 00:59:55,967
-No, wait. It was Pakistan.
-Are you sure?

834
00:59:56,050 --> 00:59:57,302
I am. It was Pakistan.

835
00:59:57,385 --> 00:59:59,679
My goodness.

836
00:59:59,762 --> 01:00:02,849
I fell for this face and married him.

837
01:00:02,932 --> 01:00:06,144
-I was a fool. A fool!
-You are a sucker for looks, Mom.

838
01:00:06,227 --> 01:00:07,228
What?

839
01:00:07,312 --> 01:00:08,313
I'm home.

840
01:00:08,396 --> 01:00:10,982
Hey, welcome home.
You're later than usual.

841
01:00:11,065 --> 01:00:12,525
Yes, I…

842
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:16,863
You went shopping for makeup again, right?
You think I wouldn't know?

843
01:00:16,946 --> 01:00:18,656
That's not it. I just missed my bus.

844
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:22,744
You have makeup caked on your face.

845
01:00:22,827 --> 01:00:25,413
You'll get to do that plenty
when you go to college.

846
01:00:25,496 --> 01:00:27,498
What's the rush with the makeup?

847
01:00:27,582 --> 01:00:31,169
Use that time to memorize
one more English word instead!

848
01:00:31,252 --> 01:00:32,170
Honey.

849
01:00:32,253 --> 01:00:35,506
Girls even younger than Ju-kyung
wear makeup these days.

850
01:00:35,590 --> 01:00:37,383
Girls who don't have good grades!

851
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:40,928
When you get older,
all that matters is your grades.

852
01:00:41,012 --> 01:00:44,432
You don't know what it's like at school.
All that matters is looks.

853
01:00:44,515 --> 01:00:47,393
What's the point of dolling up

854
01:00:47,477 --> 01:00:49,729
when your true face is not up to scratch?

855
01:00:49,812 --> 01:00:53,733
How will you get married
with that face without a decent job?

856
01:00:53,816 --> 01:00:54,901
Honey.

857
01:00:54,984 --> 01:00:57,862
-Bombarding her with facts.
-Come on, Mom. You've gone too far.

858
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:01,783
They say even the hedgehogs
think their babies are cute.

859
01:01:01,866 --> 01:01:02,700
Unbelievable.

860
01:01:02,784 --> 01:01:05,411
You brat, I'm not finished. Come back!

861
01:01:05,495 --> 01:01:06,704
Calm down, Mom.

862
01:01:09,207 --> 01:01:10,041
Goodness.

863
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:13,294

Here.

866
01:01:24,389 --> 01:01:26,391
I paid an extra 20,000 won to get it back.

867
01:01:26,474 --> 01:01:27,809
So what?

868
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:30,103
I didn't ask you to sell it.

869

320 LIKES

870
01:01:49,330 --> 01:01:51,457
Someone's really popular.

871
01:01:52,458 --> 01:01:54,293
Her post received 320 likes.

872
01:01:58,381 --> 01:01:59,924
That startled me.

873
01:02:01,759 --> 01:02:02,885
I get it.

874
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:06,180
I look ugly, even to myself.

875
01:02:07,181 --> 01:02:09,100
I guess it's the same for Mom.

876
01:02:11,394 --> 01:02:14,230
-I'm pushing!
-Come on!

877
01:02:14,313 --> 01:02:16,733
Hey, this is mine.
I'll give you each a bite.

878
01:02:16,816 --> 01:02:19,110
-You all can give me a bite in return.
-No, thanks.

879
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:22,739

There's another one.

Another one who likes you.

884

If I post my true face,
you'll all cry, "I hate you."

889
01:03:44,111 --> 01:03:45,071
Jeez.

890
01:03:45,154 --> 01:03:46,697
Hey, are you okay?

891
01:03:47,448 --> 01:03:50,326
-Watch where you're going.
-I'm sorry.

892
01:03:50,409 --> 01:03:51,869
Do you know how much this costs?

893
01:03:51,953 --> 01:03:52,995
I'm sorry.

894
01:03:53,079 --> 01:03:55,164
You look like a turd…

895
01:03:55,832 --> 01:03:59,377
Why would you run around in the night
and cause trouble to others?

896
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:00,461
I'm sorry.

897
01:04:00,545 --> 01:04:03,047
Hey, take it easy.

898
01:04:03,714 --> 01:04:06,551
Look at her face.
Do you think her eyes work?

899
01:04:07,552 --> 01:04:09,470
I had to bump into some stupid turd.

900
01:04:09,554 --> 01:04:12,390
Hey, your face is a mess.

901
01:04:13,432 --> 01:04:15,977
Eyes, nose, and mouth.
None of them are in order.

902
01:04:16,769 --> 01:04:17,645
Hey, lady.

903
01:04:18,229 --> 01:04:21,566
Just put your head down and go home.

904
01:04:22,066 --> 01:04:24,819
-Or at least cover yourself.
-Should I give her my clothes?

905
01:04:24,902 --> 01:04:26,529
-What nonsense.
-What about mine?

906
01:04:26,612 --> 01:04:29,156
-Nobody wants to see you naked.
-I mean, seriously.

907
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:33,828
-I felt threatened by her face.
-Lady, you're ruining the mood, so go!

908
01:04:33,911 --> 01:04:35,079
Please go.

909
01:04:35,162 --> 01:04:37,707
Off you go.

910
01:04:37,790 --> 01:04:39,333
Dang, that totally killed my vibe.

911
01:04:43,838 --> 01:04:45,756
She has confidence despite her looks.

912
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:47,425
She's the ugliest girl at school.

913
01:04:47,508 --> 01:04:48,676
Why live?

914
01:04:48,759 --> 01:04:51,012
If you don't have the looks,
you should at least be sharp-witted.

915
01:04:51,095 --> 01:04:52,096
Know your place.

916
01:04:52,179 --> 01:04:55,516
Do you really want to know?
Because you are ugly.

917
01:05:16,537 --> 01:05:17,997
-You…
-Here.

918
01:05:19,457 --> 01:05:20,875
Didn't you bring an umbrella?

919
01:05:21,751 --> 01:05:22,627
Why?

920
01:05:23,961 --> 01:05:25,421
You want me to get one for you?

921
01:05:26,839 --> 01:05:28,799
-Okay.
-That's not what I meant.

922
01:05:28,883 --> 01:05:29,926
What did you mean then?

923
01:05:30,426 --> 01:05:32,428
You ask me to do stuff for you
all the time.

924
01:05:33,012 --> 01:05:34,555
Don't you think it's too much?

925
01:05:34,639 --> 01:05:36,682
I did say that I'd do anything,

926
01:05:36,766 --> 01:05:39,143
but are you having fun
holding my secret against me?

927
01:05:40,686 --> 01:05:44,190
How are you any different
from the people who bullied me?

928
01:05:45,858 --> 01:05:47,860
It's not my fault I'm ugly.

929
01:05:48,444 --> 01:05:50,780
How come everyone hates me?

930
01:05:53,324 --> 01:05:55,368
What's the point of putting on makeup?

931
01:05:55,451 --> 01:05:57,662
I'm still ugly Lim Ju-kyung,

932
01:05:58,663 --> 01:06:01,582
and I got found out by the likes of you
as soon as I transferred.

933
01:06:01,666 --> 01:06:04,377
I can't even sleep at night
out of worry you'll reveal everything

934
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:06,295
and run errands for you to appease you.

935
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:09,548
Do you know how I feel?

936
01:06:09,632 --> 01:06:12,426
Don't you have a secret
you'd like to hide?

937
01:06:16,806 --> 01:06:17,848
You…

938
01:06:18,683 --> 01:06:22,311
You shouldn't make fun of someone's pain.

939
01:06:53,426 --> 01:06:54,802
Wait here for a sec.

940
01:07:40,848 --> 01:07:41,682
Ju-kyung!

941
01:07:42,725 --> 01:07:43,559
Ju-kyung!

942
01:07:44,435 --> 01:07:45,269
Ju-kyung!

943
01:07:46,270 --> 01:07:47,188
Ju-kyung!

944
01:08:10,252 --> 01:08:11,253
I thought you left.

945
01:08:12,755 --> 01:08:13,714
I just…

946
01:08:14,340 --> 01:08:15,716
got embarrassed.

947
01:08:19,470 --> 01:08:21,597
Well, I wasn't thinking straight earlier…

948
01:08:30,064 --> 01:08:31,440
I'm okay.

949
01:08:50,751 --> 01:08:54,004
If people find out,
I won't be able to show my face.

950
01:08:54,088 --> 01:08:55,923
But it's a matter of life or death for me.

951
01:08:56,006 --> 01:08:57,716
I beg of you.

952
01:08:57,800 --> 01:09:01,762
You shouldn't make fun of someone's pain.

953
01:09:17,528 --> 01:09:18,529
Sorry.

954
01:09:22,533 --> 01:09:23,409
I'm sorry.

955
01:10:26,972 --> 01:10:28,015
Hey, Lee Soo-ho.

956
01:10:29,808 --> 01:10:31,518
You got a friend killed.

957
01:10:32,519 --> 01:10:33,896
Yet you seem to be doing well.

958
01:11:05,844 --> 01:11:06,845
Excuse me…

959
01:11:07,513 --> 01:11:08,847
Is this about your helmet?

960
01:11:08,931 --> 01:11:09,765
Not at all.

961
01:11:11,308 --> 01:11:12,518
I'm having lunch with you.

962
01:11:20,067 --> 01:11:21,193
Han Seo-jun!

963
01:11:32,705 --> 01:11:34,790
Seriously, you punk?

964
01:12:20,461 --> 01:12:23,005
I'm not sure what happened before,

965
01:12:23,839 --> 01:12:27,009
but if you feel like talking to someone,
let me know.

966
01:12:27,092 --> 01:12:28,635
I can be the secret wall you can talk to.

967
01:12:29,762 --> 01:12:31,347
Do you like Lim Ju-kyung?

968
01:12:31,430 --> 01:12:34,433
I heard both Lee Soo-ho
and Han Seo-jun like you.

969
01:12:34,516 --> 01:12:36,727
Who are you going to pick between the two?

970
01:12:36,810 --> 01:12:37,644
Don't get off track.

971
01:12:37,728 --> 01:12:38,937
Come over here for a moment.

972
01:12:39,021 --> 01:12:41,732
I'm being dogged by rumors as is.
Should I just meet him?

973
01:12:43,108 --> 01:12:44,276
I have something to say.

974
01:12:45,778 --> 01:12:47,696
I don't think I'm ready yet.

975
01:12:49,031 --> 01:12:54,036
