2
00:01:49,734 --> 00:01:51,986
Hey, I heard Lim Ju-kyung
came to school without makeup on.

3
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:54,489
Do you really think
she's dating Lee Soo-ho?

4
00:01:54,572 --> 00:01:56,574
I saw her face earlier
and it was worse than the pictures.

5
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:58,409
They would've broken up by now.

6
00:01:58,493 --> 00:01:59,786
How could he date her
after seeing that face?

7
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:02,288
Isn't he also lame lately?
His dad is a has-been.

8
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:04,874
I guess he's just out of his mind
and dating anyone now.

9
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,960
-Gosh, that was harsh.
-What?

10
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:08,503
-Let's go.
-Sure, let's!

11
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:10,755
-Hey, what's that?
-Hey.

12
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:19,639
Hey, you!

13
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:23,226
-Take back what you just said.
-Lim Ju-kyung?

14
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:26,980
Hey, are you crazy,
going around without makeup on?

15
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:29,482
Yes. I'm dating Lee Soo-ho.

16
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:31,776
Lee Soo-ho is my boyfriend!

17
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,695
Happy? Did that satisfy your curiosity?

18
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:36,030
-She must have gone crazy.
-Right?

19
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:39,367
He doesn't judge people by their looks,

20
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:42,370
and he likes me for who I am,
no matter what I look like.

21
00:02:42,453 --> 00:02:44,956
He's a way better person
than you mean and awful people.

22
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:47,876
So don't talk behind his back
and put him down for dating me.

23
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:49,836
Say it all straight to my face!

24
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,546
I'll take you all down. Got it?

25
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:53,840
And if you have time
to judge others' looks,

26
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:55,466
try studying instead!

27
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:56,968
Step aside!

28
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,393
Are they really dating?

29
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:09,522
I'm so jealous.

30
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:52,941
Let's go.

31
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:06,079
Hey, you're here.

32
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:07,330
What should we eat later?

33
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:10,041
-Tteokbokki.
-I know a great tteokbokki place.

34
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:11,459
Really? Shall we go there?

35
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:14,128
A boyfriend? Of course, I don't.

36
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:35,191
Gosh, your car's pretty nice.

37
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,568
-I guess you're doing well.
-Do you like it?

38
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:38,611
Yes.

39
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:40,363
Do you want it?

40
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:44,492
That's cute.

41
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:49,580
You can be my grapefruit from now on.

42
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,922
-But I'm the grapefruit!
-Goodness!

43
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:01,217
Goodness, my heart…

44
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,760
I'd love some grapefruit.

45
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:06,973
I just really love grapefruit, you know.

46
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,940
-Are they really dating?
-I'm so jealous.

47
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:19,986
That's the end of our dating in secret.

48
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:22,030
Yes.

49
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:25,992
I came clean about both my bare face
and our relationship today.

50
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:27,952
Are you all right?

51
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:29,704
No.

52
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:32,457
I'm as nervous as I can be.

53
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:35,501
Why didn't you come as you usually do?

54
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:39,422
Go-un said this to me once.

55
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:43,009
If I started hating my face

56
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:44,844
because of others' rude comments,

57
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:47,472
I'd be accepting it as a fact
that I'm ugly.

58
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:50,600
So moving forward,

59
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:54,187
I'm only going to listen
to the people who love me.

60
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:58,066
Words spat out by people who don't know me

61
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:00,151
are not worth my attention.

62
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:03,404
I'm not going to run or hide anymore.

63
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:04,989
That's why I didn't wear makeup.

64
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:08,242
You've grown so much, Ju-kyung.

65
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:12,789
Hey, Mom.

66
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:15,333
She's all right.
She has her savior by her side too.

67
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,210
What? What savior?

68
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:19,712
-No need to worry.
-No one's bothering her?

69
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:21,547
So I don't need to show up?

70
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:22,965
All right.

71
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:25,051
Is Ju-kyung doing all right?

72
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:27,428
He says she's doing okay,

73
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:29,514
but we can't know
how she's actually feeling.

74
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:31,933
I'm sure she's fine. She's your daughter.

75
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:37,939
Why are you here?

76
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:39,982
Go!

77
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,238
-Go away!
-What the heck?

78
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:47,949
-Why is he…
-Goodness.

79
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:50,034
-What is this?
-Don't stir up my heart!

80
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:50,952
Just leave!

81
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:52,453
Go away!

82
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:53,996
Who's this crazy…

83
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,584
Mr. Han?

84
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,545
Mr. Han?

85
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,048
Hello.

86
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:07,802
This is a no-parking zone.

87
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:09,512
Seeing your car parked here

88
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:11,931
made me upset.

89
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:14,308
Goodbye!

90
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:19,439
I mean, who gets that upset
over a parked car?

91
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:20,940
An anger management issue?

92
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:25,319
No, he has a cuteness management issue.

93
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:28,614
-Gosh.
-What's going on?

94
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,836
What is this? Are you kidding me?

95
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,130
-You two are something.
-Seriously.

96
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:46,132
I can't believe this.

97
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:48,384
-Props to her.
-Same.

98
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:55,558
Seriously, I'm so jealous.

99
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:03,983
Ju-kyung, I was so worried about you.

100
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:05,985
By the way, you were awesome earlier.

101
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:11,991
-Good morning.
-Good morning, sir.

102
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:13,993
Time for afternoon assembly.

103
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:15,828
-Morning assembly.
-Morning assembly.

104
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:17,413
If you say so.

105
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:20,041
-What?
-Sorry?

106
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:23,711
And please leave
if you're not in this class.

107
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:25,630
Sir, that's Lim Ju-kyung.

108
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:26,547
If you say so.

109
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:29,175
Ju-kyung?

110
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,677
-Yes?
-Are you Ju-kyung?

111
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,304
Yes.

112
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:34,222
Ju-kyung…

113
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:36,807
Welcome back, Ju-kyung.

114
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:38,935
I mean…

115
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:41,354
I was just…

116
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,147
I just…

117
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,067
I was so worried about you.

118
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:50,947
Don't cry.

119
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:53,574
-Are you crying, sir?
-Why are you crying?

120
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:55,785
-He's really crying.
-Don't cry, sir.

121
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:57,537
Sorry about that, guys.

122
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,163
Ju-kyung is finally back!

123
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:05,127
-Don't cry!
-Don't cry!

124
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:07,421
I'm really sorry.

125
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:09,215
Ju-kyung… That's it.

126
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:11,801
Don't cry!

127
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:23,521
So you really came to school like that.

128
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:26,107
Excuse me?

129
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:30,444
It's like you're putting on a show
for the whole school.

130
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,242
You wanted the attention that badly?

131
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:38,703
I guess having Soo-ho by your side

132
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:40,371
gave you some sort of courage?

133
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:43,374
Hey, Su-jin!

134
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:48,087
How could you?

135
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,005
Su-ah…

136
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:50,381
Su-jin,

137
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,175
you're seriously the worst.

138
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:56,345
You should be begging on your knees
for her forgiveness, but what?

139
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:57,555
Is that all you can say?

140
00:09:57,638 --> 00:09:59,223
Why should I have to beg?

141
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:02,602
It's you who posted the pictures
and videos on the anonymous forum!

142
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:06,314
-Shouldn't we stop him?
-Where are they going?

143
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:08,274
-Stop him.
-Me? I stop him?

144
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:10,484
-What's wrong with him?
-I should stop him?

145
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:11,819
Hey, where are you going?

146
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:12,737
Lim Ju-kyung.

147
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:16,282
You think you destroyed her, don't you?

148
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:21,287
It's you who's destroyed.

149
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:33,090
Sure, I tried to understand you at first.

150
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:36,010
"Maybe she liked him too much
and did it in a fit of jealousy."

151
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:38,471
"She'd be regretting it by now at least."

152
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:41,307
"What with Ju-kyung
missing school and all,

153
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,934
she must be feeling sorry
and worried about her by now."

154
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:45,478
That's what I thought!

155
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:46,979
That's why

156
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:50,274
I was waiting for you
to apologize to Ju-kyung first!

157
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:53,986
Instead, is this who you really are?

158
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:55,696
Yes.

159
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:58,449
It turns out this is who I am.

160
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:12,046
Su-ah!

161
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:28,604
Su-ah!

162
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:37,780
Su-jin.

163
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:41,367
Why are you taking things this far?

164
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:43,035
Is something going on at home?

165
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:45,413
Is it because of your dad?

166
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:46,872
What do you care?

167
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:49,333
I've been thinking
but I just can't figure it out.

168
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,377
This isn't who you are.

169
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:55,047
Is this what you really wanted?

170
00:11:57,174 --> 00:11:58,884
-Yes.
-I know it's not.

171
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:00,886
I know you're regretting it.

172
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,221
It's not too late.

173
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:05,057
Just apologize to Ju-kyung.

174
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:07,643
-Say you're sorry and…
-Stay out of this.

175
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:16,277
Su-ah!

176
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:18,988
Su-ah, wait!

177
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:23,659
Hey, Su-ah, I'm sorry.

178
00:12:23,742 --> 00:12:24,577
Let go.

179
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:28,914
I'm really sorry about not telling you.

180
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:33,502
But I thought you might not want to
be my friend anymore if I did.

181
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:37,214
Ju-kyung,

182
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:39,508
what kind of person did you think I was?

183
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,260
Was I ever your true best friend?

184
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:44,263
That was all the more reason
why I couldn't tell you.

185
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:46,432
But you told Su-jin about it.

186
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:48,934
Gosh, you only told her everything

187
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,644
and didn't tell me anything.

188
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:54,940
You thought I would cut you off
if I saw your bare face?

189
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:58,486
I may act childish,

190
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:01,864
but how could you think so little of me?

191
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:07,077
Su-ah, I'm sorry.

192
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:11,916
After all I did to get you a boyfriend,

193
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:14,418
you didn't tell me about
you dating Soo-ho.

194
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:18,547
Your best friend shouldn't have to learn
you're dating from an anonymous forum.

195
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:21,675
I'm really sorry, Su-ah.

196
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:36,482
What do you think made her go that far?

197
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:38,609
Nothing made her do it.

198
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:40,819
She chose to do this herself.

199
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:43,989
How could she do something like that?

200
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:48,661
Su-jin is the one who left us.

201
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:50,996
To her, you and I…

202
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:54,542
only mattered this much.

203
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:02,967
Let me see your face.

204
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:05,302
What's so bad that you were hiding…

205
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:12,518
You'd look prettier
if you worked on your skin.

206
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:14,478
Go see a dermatologist,
get some treatments,

207
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:16,689
drink a lot of water, and take vitamins.

208
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:18,190
That's it. Don't worry.

209
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:23,070
And you need to tell me
everything from the start, okay?

210
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:24,530
When did you two start dating?

211
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:26,240
Who confessed first? Is he good to you?

212
00:14:26,323 --> 00:14:29,743
That borderline sociopath
doesn't ever throw fits at you?

213
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:32,872
-He doesn't do that.
-Don't grin like that!

214
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:35,082
Tell me everything from start to finish!

215
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:36,750
Be prepared to stay up all night!

216
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:40,588
What did you mean by this?

217
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:43,173
Hey, take that off! It's disgusting.

218
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:45,092
Wasn't it a sign of your affection?

219
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:46,427
What?

220
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:48,387
This is the last time I'll ask.

221
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:51,765
Haven't you warmed up to me even a little?

222
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:53,058
No, not at all.

223
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:54,727
Don't. Prove yourself.

224
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:59,231
You really don't have feelings for me?
Then step on me as you cross.

225
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:03,485
Wait. Think carefully.

226
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,779
I said this will be the last time I ask--

227
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:23,255
I have no intention
of foolishly remaining a friend

228
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,716
and having a painful
one-sided love like you.

229
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:42,316
Hey.

230
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:43,817
Are you okay?

231
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:47,488
Are you crying?

232
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:51,867
-I didn't think it hit you that hard.
-Seo-jun.

233
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:54,411
What do I do now?

234
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:58,832
What do you mean?

235
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:02,002
Did Go-un reject you?

236
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:03,504
I really like her.

237
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:06,256
But she doesn't feel the same way.

238
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,718
I get flustered every time I see her
because she's so pretty.

239
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,971
I can't just stay friends.

240
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:14,306
Right.

241
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:17,601
I would be really good to her
if she were to date me.

242
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:20,354
I know.

243
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:23,649
I didn't know how hard it was
to be in unrequited love.

244
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:29,613
No one would have known.

245
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:33,033
But there's this, you know.

246
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:36,495
If you've given your all,
there are no regrets.

247
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:41,834
Now that she's rejected me
after I properly told her how I felt,

248
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:42,960
I think…

249
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:45,879
I'll finally be able to move on.

250
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:58,809
So when did you two start dating?

251
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:01,145
It hasn't been that long…

252
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:04,314
-Since the school trip.
-You've been together since then?

253
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:05,691
How could you?

254
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:07,484
Wait.

255
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,987
A question from Channel Hyun-kyu.

256
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,780
When was your first kiss?

257
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:13,240
On the school trip--

258
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:19,038
-You idiot, why would you ask that?
-Seriously, why would you?

259
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:22,082
-Even I don't think that's right.
-You always disagree with me.

260
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:25,294
"To make a flower bloom
on a swaying branch,

261
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:28,255
how many challenges
did the snow have to face?"

262
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:31,759
"Silently it must have tapped the branch."

263
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:35,846
"Quietly it must have danced."

264
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:39,975
"Sliding off the branch
a hundred times and more."

265
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,656
"Look at the euphoric sight
that finally bloomed."

266
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:58,952
"Every spring, where it was burned once,

267
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:02,289
the branches burst open
the most beautiful scar in the world."

268
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:04,750
"Where it was burned once,

269
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:08,545
the branches burst open
the most beautiful scar in the world."

270
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:10,172
How was it?

271
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:21,725
Are you sleepy?

272
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:24,645
Yes, I didn't sleep yesterday
and can't take it anymore.

273
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:26,897
I'll be taking a nap in the music room.

274
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,899
-You go have lunch.
-How could I?

275
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:31,276
You go ahead.
I'll be right there with some snacks.

276
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,778
No, it's okay…

277
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:36,109
What is it?

278
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:38,320
You're up.

279
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:40,155
When did you get here?

280
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:42,574
You woke me up.

281
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:46,245
Gosh, you seem very tired,

282
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:47,788
Soo-ho's cousin.

283
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:49,998
Well,

284
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:52,292
I wasn't trying to fool you.

285
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:53,627
You weren't fooling anyone.

286
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:56,546
It was obvious that you two were lying.

287
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:59,258
What? You figured it out then?

288
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:04,721
What?

289
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:07,057
What are you going to say?

290
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:09,559
With or without, you look about the same.

291
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:12,479
What do they mean, they were fooled?

292
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:15,440
I don't get it.

293
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,110
Thanks for comforting me.

294
00:21:18,193 --> 00:21:19,611
I meant you look ugly either way.

295
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,114
Are you making fun of me?

296
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:28,287
By the way, I heard you helped
take down the video from the forum.

297
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:32,332
Thank you.

298
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:35,085
Don't mention it.

299
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:47,472
You got matching items. I'm so jealous.

300
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:49,266
I wish I had a girlfriend.

301
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:52,436
Are you taking her out today?
Where are you going?

302
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:54,521
Should I give you some tips
on decent places?

303
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:55,814
I can do my own research.

304
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:58,984
The information on the web
is all advertisements.

305
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:02,612
They feature tons of places
that girls don't actually like.

306
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:05,615
Our friend here doesn't have a clue
about dating, does he?

307
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:07,242
Really?

308
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:12,414
-Let me see what you've found.
-Yes, let's see.

309
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:17,252
So?

310
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:22,758
-I can see you tried.
-So he says. You did try.

311
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:28,055
-Hold on! What's this?
-I like you so much, what do I do?

312
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:31,558
I find you so pretty, what do I do?

313
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:33,268
-Gosh!
-Hey!

314
00:22:34,352 --> 00:22:37,522
Such a charmer. So you've got a plan.

315
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:40,984
-There's a softy behind this facade!
-So soft!

316
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:44,154
-What do I do?
-What do I do?

317
00:22:44,237 --> 00:22:46,490
-Shut up.
-What do I do?

318
00:22:46,573 --> 00:22:48,450
-What do I do?
-Softy here is…

319
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:49,618
-Bye.
-Ju-kyung!

320
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:52,204
-Softy!
-What do I do?

321
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:54,122
-Ju-kyung!
-Yes?

322
00:22:54,831 --> 00:22:57,417
I'm taking her today.

323
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:59,169
Sorry, I'll call you later.

324
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:01,088
Gosh, what are you going to do?

325
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:02,214
-What do I do?
-What do I do?

326
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:03,632
Should we take you out?

327
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:05,550
-What do I do?
-What do I do?

328
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:06,885
You should hang out with us

329
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:09,429
-What do I do?
-What do I do?

330
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:14,893
What do I do?

331
00:23:18,313 --> 00:23:20,649
Amazing!
They look so handsome on the cover.

332
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:21,858
I love it.

333
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:25,153
It's so cool.
This is Crash's first new album in ages.

334
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:26,196
I'm so excited!

335
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:28,323
By the way, I was caught off guard

336
00:23:28,406 --> 00:23:31,868
by your hardcore taste in music
compared to your cute appearance.

337
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:34,454
We'll have two corn dogs, please.

338
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:35,539
They look delicious.

339
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:37,958
Thank you.

340
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:39,876
Thank you.

341
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:41,461
Let's go.

342
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:44,214
-Let's see what's in Hye-min's backpack.
-Let's do that.

343
00:23:44,297 --> 00:23:46,133
-That hurts!
-"That hurts"?

344
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:48,301
-Are you going to hurt her?
-No, I'll kill her.

345
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:50,762
What's that?

346
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:52,722
Are they taking a kid from our school?

347
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:01,481
Limju, where are you going?

348
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:05,819
-Hey, Ju-kyung!
-I'm starving.

349
00:24:05,902 --> 00:24:08,655
-Can I please have five corndogs?
-Ju-kyung!

350
00:24:13,326 --> 00:24:15,453
Five corn dogs and one tteokbokki, please.

351
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:23,128
-Left foot, right foot.
-When are you leaving?

352
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:24,546
Be quiet. After this round.

353
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:26,756
Can you not interrupt this crucial moment?

354
00:24:28,216 --> 00:24:29,259
Come on!

355
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:33,180
Let's see how much money Hye-min has.

356
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:37,100
-What?
-You said you wouldn't come back.

357
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:39,102
You said you'd let me go.

358
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:42,981
That was for when you actually
found some dirt on Ju-kyung.

359
00:24:43,064 --> 00:24:46,318
But you didn't do a single thing,

360
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:47,402
did you?

361
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:49,362
Hey, Park Sam-mi!

362
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:59,789
-Lim Ju-kyung?
-Hey, it's Dumpling!

363
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:04,127
I've been meaning to pay you a visit,
and here we are.

364
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:06,254
Let go of Hye-min.

365
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,341
What if I don't?

366
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:12,844
Hye-min, come here.

367
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:15,889
Where do you think you're going?

368
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:17,641
Ju-kyung.

369
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:22,479
You're dating Soo-ho
and hanging out with Seo-jun.

370
00:25:22,562 --> 00:25:23,855
You've come up in the world.

371
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:27,442
But I heard your videos and photos
are all over the forum.

372
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:32,447
Your life is ruined, isn't it?
What can you do?

373
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:34,491
It's not like you can be born again.

374
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:35,533
Hey!

375
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:43,917
What the…

376
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:45,752
Are you crazy?

377
00:25:45,835 --> 00:25:48,713
-Do you want to die?
-You're the ones who are dying tonight.

378
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:53,843
It's unfair you have a weapon!

379
00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:55,804
Hey!

380
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:58,556
Does your mom know you're doing this?

381
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,142
Leave my mom out of it! Cham, cham, cham!

382
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:02,602
Head!

383
00:26:04,771 --> 00:26:06,481
I see that you've grown up.

384
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:11,820
What's in that bag? That hurts!

385
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:14,114
You sneaky little…

386
00:26:15,323 --> 00:26:16,825
You're dead meat!

387
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:29,421
-Left, right. Jump!
-Yes.

388
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:34,968
How dare you, Dumpling?

389
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:38,638
Who do you think I am?

390
00:26:45,603 --> 00:26:46,521
Hey, hand it over.

391
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:50,108
Are you challenging me?

392
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:52,527
I'll accept your challenge.
Come and get it, Soo-ho.

393
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:07,876
Hey! Nice!

394
00:27:15,508 --> 00:27:16,343
Soo-ho!

395
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:19,429
You lose, Hyun-kyu!

396
00:27:19,512 --> 00:27:21,598
-Let go.
-Let go.

397
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:22,974
-Let go!
-Let me go!

398
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:25,977
-Hey!
-Let go!

399
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:28,897
Who the heck are you? Get off each other!

400
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:34,402
-Hey, let go.
-Why, you little…

401
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:42,077
What sort of punks are putting their hands
on Saebom High students?

402
00:27:46,664 --> 00:27:49,751
Hey, I'll deal with these guys.
You should all just go.

403
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:01,096
Hey,

404
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:03,306
thank you, Ju-kyung.

405
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:05,058
Don't ever follow them from now on.

406
00:28:05,141 --> 00:28:07,102
If they try to drag you, call the cops.

407
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:08,561
-Okay?
-Okay.

408
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:10,897
But Sam-mi doesn't scare me anymore.

409
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,816
Turns out she's not very intimidating.

410
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:16,444
Why was I so scared all this time?

411
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:18,238
I should have fought back earlier.

412
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:21,616
Right, I should have done that too.

413
00:28:25,703 --> 00:28:28,248
Jeez, I just got this today.

414
00:28:28,331 --> 00:28:29,541
What now?

415
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:32,293
Boys, I'm sorry I couldn't protect you.

416
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:33,878
It must have hurt a lot.

417
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:35,922
-Oh no.
-I'm so sorry.

418
00:28:37,173 --> 00:28:38,508
Would you like to have this?

419
00:28:39,592 --> 00:28:41,302
I always buy two copies.

420
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:44,305
Can I really have this?

421
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:46,266
Thank you so much.

422
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:48,977
I'll treat you to something yummy!

423
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:54,441
By the way, are you also a Jelateen?

424
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:58,361
-Yes, a third-generation Jelateen. You?
-Same here.

425
00:28:58,445 --> 00:29:00,989
-Really?
-Gosh, it's so nice to meet you!

426
00:29:01,656 --> 00:29:04,534
-Got tickets for the year-end concert?
-Yes, standing section A.

427
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:06,703
-What? I'm also in the A section!
-Really?

428
00:29:06,786 --> 00:29:09,456
We could totally go together then!
This is amazing!

429
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:11,040
Thank you so much for this!

430
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:13,460
Glad I can help.

431
00:29:14,043 --> 00:29:15,462
What a pity this got ripped.

432
00:29:16,337 --> 00:29:19,048
The memories I never wanted to revisit.

433
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:22,302
But something has changed.

434
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:25,430
I'm not alone anymore.

435
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:38,067
It's getting late.

436
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:41,446
GIRLFRIEND

437
00:29:41,529 --> 00:29:43,323
Are you having fun?

438
00:29:43,406 --> 00:29:44,365
Did you have dinner?

439
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:46,493
You're not answering my calls.

440
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:47,786
I could come pick you up.

441
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:48,912
It's getting late.

442
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:53,124
-You're…
-Totally…

443
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:54,459
tiresome.

444
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:58,963
Why don't you eat
and not peek at my phone?

445
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:02,425
Jeez, why can't you just let her
relieve some stress and have fun?

446
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:04,886
Why bombard her with so many texts?

447
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:07,096
She'll let you know
when she's heading home.

448
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,807
He's obsessed. You're obsessed.

449
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,975
-I'm just worried.
-I'm more worried about you.

450
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:13,353
I was just like you in the beginning.

451
00:30:13,436 --> 00:30:16,523
I called her and texted her
every chance I got.

452
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:19,984
She almost broke up with me within a week.

453
00:30:20,568 --> 00:30:24,614
She said I was making her get tired of me.

454
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:26,199
What?

455
00:30:26,282 --> 00:30:27,951
Even if you totally love her,

456
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:30,745
-you shouldn't be too available.
-"Don't be too available."

457
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:33,915
So she won't get tired of you.

458
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:35,166
"Won't get tired of you."

459
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:37,293
You should take notes too.
What are you doing?

460
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,587
-You should leave. Go!
-But…

461
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:41,339
-Wait…
-We should finish the chicken.

462
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:50,223
Tu-ah, are you having fun?

463
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:52,225
I miss you so much!

464
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:56,980
I'll be right there to pick you up, babe.

465
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:00,900
Be available… No. Don't be tiresome.

466
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:06,406
Soo-ho, I don't know much about dating,

467
00:31:06,489 --> 00:31:07,782
but if you ask me, I--

468
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:08,783
Aren't you leaving?

469
00:31:11,452 --> 00:31:12,954
I'll finish this quickly.

470
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:37,186
I should call Soo-ho.

471
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,099
I shouldn't.

472
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:32,617
Su-ah.

473
00:32:36,412 --> 00:32:38,790
Hey, why are you calling me at this hour?

474
00:32:38,873 --> 00:32:40,124
Send me a text right now.

475
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:41,542
My phone must not be working.

476
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:43,294
It's fine. It's working too well!

477
00:32:43,836 --> 00:32:46,422
Seriously, if it were broken,
you couldn't have called me.

478
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:47,840
Seeing how she hasn't texted,

479
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:50,802
-it's having problems with receiving--
-You're suffocating.

480
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:52,679
Just go to bed. You're driving me nuts!

481
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:53,596
Hey, Yoo Tae--

482
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:55,515
Seriously.

483
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:57,725
Yoo Tae-hoon!

484
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:13,950
Is he still asleep?

485
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:27,213
GIRLFRIEND

486
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:43,855
I already cleaned the floor this morning.
You can just leave it.

487
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:47,150
But you're always busy and tired,
so I wanted to help you out.

488
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:49,027
-Is there anything I can help with?
-No.

489
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,403
Come on.

490
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,196
I could organize these.

491
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,032
You're not helping! Just go home.

492
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:58,870
Mom, the thing is…

493
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:01,414
Hey, why don't you

494
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:03,499
check under the chair?

495
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:07,670
-What? Why?
-Just do it.

496
00:34:13,968 --> 00:34:14,886
What is…

497
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:20,475
Mom!

498
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:23,686
Turns out you have to study a lot.
There's even a practical exam.

499
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:25,480
All that equipment must not be cheap.

500
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:27,899
You can't afford all that
with just a part-time job.

501
00:34:27,982 --> 00:34:28,816
Then…

502
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:32,737
Are you giving me your blessing
about my studying cosmetology?

503
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,238
Quit your part-time job.

504
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:36,657
You've made up your mind, so do it right,

505
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:38,534
give it your all,

506
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:41,913
and become famous like that girl Salad,
or Selena, whatever her name is.

507
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:44,248
-Got it?
-Mom!

508
00:34:45,958 --> 00:34:47,877
You're grossing me out. Let me go!

509
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,338
I'll really try my best.

510
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:52,173
I love you, Mom.

511
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:55,051
That tickles. Wait, I'm so ticklish.

512
00:34:55,134 --> 00:34:58,179
-Thank you.
-Let go of me.

513
00:34:58,262 --> 00:35:00,014
Hey, that tickles!

514
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:01,891
-Stop! That's enough!
-Thank you.

515
00:35:02,683 --> 00:35:04,644
Lim Ju-kyung!

516
00:35:05,394 --> 00:35:07,188
-What?
-Why didn't you answer my calls yesterday?

517
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:08,397
Why didn't you?

518
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:11,067
I blew off some steam for a change.
Why must you be so controlling?

519
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:12,360
All those calls and texts!

520
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:13,820
I want to be free now.

521
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:19,158
What do you mean?
Are you breaking up with me?

522
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:23,788
You're so tiresome!

523
00:35:23,871 --> 00:35:25,331
What?

524
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:30,920
I'm not tiresome at all.
What do you say? Ride with me?

525
00:35:31,587 --> 00:35:32,713
-Sure.
-Don't.

526
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:34,632
Don't go with him.

527
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,467
Lim Ju-kyung.

528
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:38,594
Lim Ju-kyung!

529
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:43,683
No!

530
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:51,732
MISSED CALL
GIRLFRIEND

531
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:53,651
What? She called me?

532
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:57,363
Why did I have such a dream?

533
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:13,087
GIRLFRIEND

534
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:19,177
-Hello?
-Yesterday…

535
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,053
When did you get home?
Why didn't you call?

536
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:24,056
I'm not looking for an apology,
but you could've at least called.

537
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,016
I waited all night.

538
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:26,893
Now that I hear your voice, I miss you.

539
00:36:26,976 --> 00:36:29,103
So let's meet up.
I was about to go see you--

540
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:30,855
-You're…
-Totally…

541
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:32,064
tiresome.

542
00:36:33,816 --> 00:36:34,734
Where are you?

543
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:38,279
My class is about to start.
I'll call you after.

544
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:40,114
What? I…

545
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:49,707
Hello, class.

546
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:51,584
-Hello!
-Hello!

547
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:55,546
Now, keep in mind
the volume of a human face.

548
00:36:56,589 --> 00:37:00,176
Apply the foundation thicker
in the protruding areas.

549
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:04,639
As for where the skin is thin,
like near the eyes and the lips,

550
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:08,476
you should apply a minimal amount
to avoid making the face look flat.

551
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:10,770
-Yes.
-Why don't we practice on your partner?

552
00:37:10,853 --> 00:37:11,687
-Okay.
-Okay.

553
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:25,201
Hello, I got a call earlier.

554
00:37:25,284 --> 00:37:26,118
Where is he?

555
00:37:26,702 --> 00:37:28,621
He's over there. He's totally out.

556
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:30,331
-Goodness, thank you.
-No problem.

557
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:33,042
Gosh.

558
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:36,087
Jun-woo.

559
00:37:37,171 --> 00:37:39,131
Wake up. Grapefruit.

560
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:40,883
Grapefruit!

561
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:43,469
Did you call me?

562
00:37:47,848 --> 00:37:49,642
-It's my woman.
-What?

563
00:37:53,312 --> 00:37:54,897
Or maybe you're not anymore.

564
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:56,524
We did break up.

565
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:57,775
What?

566
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:03,698
How can I make you mine?

567
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:05,241
What?

568
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,705
Don't you run away. Wait for me.

569
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:14,834
After a year, you'll be mine again.

570
00:38:25,761 --> 00:38:26,846
This is too much.

571
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:29,307
INSTANT NOODLES
BUY ONE, GET ONE

572
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,822
-I got it first!
-But…

573
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:46,574
Let go!

574
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,208
-What?
-You first.

575
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:01,339
Do I know him from somewhere?

576
00:39:02,965 --> 00:39:04,592
-Honey, try this one.
-Co…

577
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:05,760
Co… come and open up!

578
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:08,512
Columbus Park! Hold it right there!

579
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:10,306
You bastard!

580
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:11,974
-Columbus Park?
-Stop right there!

581
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:14,143
Hold it! Hey, you!

582
00:39:14,935 --> 00:39:15,895
Wait.

583
00:39:16,979 --> 00:39:19,065
Right here. There you go.

584
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:22,943
I miss Hee-kyung

585
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:24,528
What do I do?

586
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:27,073
What do you do? You should get in.

587
00:39:27,156 --> 00:39:28,491
There you go.

588
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:33,329
You can't even last a day,
much less a year.

589
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,582
-Stop right there!
-What the heck?

590
00:39:36,665 --> 00:39:39,752
Please help us catch him!

591
00:39:39,835 --> 00:39:40,836
Man.

592
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:50,805
Goodness, thank you so much!

593
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,641
Mom? Dad?

594
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:54,767
Hee-kyung?

595
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:01,857
Grapefruit!

596
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:11,117
Soo-ho!

597
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:13,285
You're pretty good.

598
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:15,037
Hey.

599
00:40:18,165 --> 00:40:20,251
Why are you here on a weekend
instead of on a date?

600
00:40:20,334 --> 00:40:23,212
-Ju-kyung's been busy.
-Are you upset you didn't get to see her?

601
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:25,131
I'm not upset.

602
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:26,757
Why couldn't she make the time?

603
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:29,802
She can't have gotten tired of
your handsome face yet.

604
00:40:29,885 --> 00:40:30,970
She's not.

605
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:33,055
What are you doing here?

606
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:35,433
I was just bored.

607
00:40:35,516 --> 00:40:37,768
But why come all the way here
to learn martial arts?

608
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:39,353
You can learn it from me.

609
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:40,479
What do you know?

610
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:42,857
What's there to learn?
It is all about instinct.

611
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,942
Instinct, my foot. It's about technique.

612
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:49,989
You see that? Instinct.

613
00:40:50,072 --> 00:40:51,490
You may have great instincts,

614
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:53,742
but you can't flip a person who's trained.

615
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:55,369
-What if I do?
-What if you do?

616
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,371
What's in it for me if I flip you?

617
00:40:58,205 --> 00:40:59,165
Are you that bored?

618
00:40:59,748 --> 00:41:01,208
Whoever flips the other wins.

619
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:03,377
The loser grants the winner a wish.

620
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:04,503
What do you say?

621
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:06,422
You'll be left penniless.

622
00:41:06,505 --> 00:41:08,507
You should be worrying about yourself.

623
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:12,052
No rules.
Count to three once on the ground.

624
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:13,637
Sure.

625
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:51,217
One, two,

626
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:53,761
two and a quarter, two and a half.

627
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:56,305
You're taking out your anger on me,
aren't you?

628
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:00,768
Three.

629
00:42:06,148 --> 00:42:07,483
Couldn't you just let me win?

630
00:42:09,318 --> 00:42:10,152
Jeez.

631
00:42:10,986 --> 00:42:13,322
What do you say?
Do you want to train here too?

632
00:42:13,405 --> 00:42:14,406
No thanks.

633
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:16,033
So what will you have me do?

634
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:18,118
Just say it already.

635
00:42:23,123 --> 00:42:25,167
I don't love

636
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:27,378
So obviously

637
00:42:40,933 --> 00:42:44,353
From far away, so far away

638
00:42:45,312 --> 00:42:48,190
I see you walking in

639
00:42:53,862 --> 00:42:58,242
How do I put my fluttering heart

640
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:01,704
Into words

641
00:43:03,956 --> 00:43:05,249
You have

642
00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:10,879
Stolen my heart

643
00:43:10,963 --> 00:43:14,174
From the first moment

644
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:21,515
You left me with an incurable disease

645
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:24,727
I want to become a flowerpot

646
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:28,522
This I always pray

647
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:31,650
I'll become your flowerpot

648
00:43:31,734 --> 00:43:35,404
On your small windowsill

649
00:43:35,487 --> 00:43:38,449
Even if I can't say a word

650
00:43:38,532 --> 00:43:41,910
Though I couldn't ask for more

651
00:43:41,994 --> 00:43:45,456
I'd be graced me with your smile

652
00:43:45,539 --> 00:43:48,626
And your touch every now and then

653
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:51,795
I'd get to see your sleeping face

654
00:43:52,504 --> 00:43:58,260
To my heart's content

655
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:05,225
-Encore!
-You're so awesome!

656
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:06,810
Here's the pizza you ordered.

657
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:07,728
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

658
00:44:08,854 --> 00:44:11,023
I'm not going to make a bet
with you ever again.

659
00:44:12,107 --> 00:44:13,150
Were you hungry?

660
00:44:13,233 --> 00:44:16,236
I had a jiu-jitsu match and sang a song.
Of course, I'm hungry.

661
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,321
By the way,

662
00:44:18,364 --> 00:44:20,157
your voice isn't what it used to be.

663
00:44:21,408 --> 00:44:24,578
-It's become deeper and more manly.
-That's my point.

664
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:28,916
So why aren't you singing
with that deeper and more manly voice?

665
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:32,044
It's too late now.

666
00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:34,588
-It's not.
-I don't want to.

667
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:41,428
I want you to sing again.

668
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:45,349
I know Se-yeon

669
00:44:45,974 --> 00:44:47,393
would want that too.

670
00:44:53,565 --> 00:44:55,692
What were you going to ask for
if you had won?

671
00:44:56,402 --> 00:44:58,737
-Do you want to know?
-Let me hear it.

672
00:45:01,323 --> 00:45:02,366
Can I tell Ju-kyung

673
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:04,368
how I feel about her?

674
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:10,332
I was going to ask for your permission.

675
00:45:10,999 --> 00:45:12,042
Tell her how you feel?

676
00:45:12,626 --> 00:45:13,460
Yes.

677
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:15,629
I want to get rejected and get over her.

678
00:45:27,433 --> 00:45:28,976
From what he was saying,

679
00:45:29,768 --> 00:45:33,230
Mr. Won took all his money
and left him penniless.

680
00:45:33,772 --> 00:45:36,275
Would he still be in Korea
if he had money?

681
00:45:36,358 --> 00:45:38,068
He would have fled overseas long ago.

682
00:45:38,735 --> 00:45:39,653
Still.

683
00:45:39,736 --> 00:45:43,407
We turned him in,
so he'll pay for his actions.

684
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:47,119
I thought I'd get everything back
if I caught him…

685
00:45:47,911 --> 00:45:48,996
I'm sorry, honey.

686
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:49,913
Enough.

687
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:53,208
Think of it as our fate
and something that couldn't be helped.

688
00:45:53,876 --> 00:45:57,880
Our moving here at least freed
Ju-kyung from those bullies.

689
00:45:58,464 --> 00:46:00,674
And Hee-kyung got to meet her other half.

690
00:46:00,757 --> 00:46:01,717
Isn't that right?

691
00:46:02,217 --> 00:46:03,177
She's right, Dad.

692
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:05,012
Had Ju-kyung not transferred,

693
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:07,097
I couldn't have met my grapefruit.

694
00:46:07,681 --> 00:46:08,682
By the way,

695
00:46:09,725 --> 00:46:11,560
when is Mr. Grapefruit going to wake up?

696
00:46:11,643 --> 00:46:12,895
Is he going to stay asleep?

697
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:25,824
Were you waiting long?

698
00:46:26,575 --> 00:46:27,618
No.

699
00:46:28,911 --> 00:46:30,204
I should charge my phone.

700
00:46:31,413 --> 00:46:33,874
You ordered this? It looks good!

701
00:46:34,374 --> 00:46:36,001
I ordered it for myself.

702
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:39,129
What's wrong?

703
00:46:39,671 --> 00:46:41,590
-Are you mad at me?
-No.

704
00:46:41,673 --> 00:46:43,258
-Are you upset?
-No.

705
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:45,928
Do you think I'd get upset over nothing?

706
00:46:46,762 --> 00:46:48,514
He's obviously upset about something.

707
00:46:49,306 --> 00:46:50,140
I see.

708
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:53,644
You don't seem pleased
about my being here.

709
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:55,729
I better go then.

710
00:46:55,812 --> 00:46:56,730
Where are you going?

711
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:00,943
Should I stay?

712
00:47:03,862 --> 00:47:06,907
Then what is it? Why are you upset?

713
00:47:09,785 --> 00:47:11,703
Are you really not going to tell me?

714
00:47:12,746 --> 00:47:15,249
Why? We haven't gone on a date
after making it official.

715
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:17,668
I prepared everything,
but now you're busy and unreachable.

716
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:19,419
Tae-hoon said I was being tiresome,

717
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:21,171
and Seo-jun asked if he could
tell you how he felt.

718
00:47:21,255 --> 00:47:23,423
I'm dying inside from all the agony.

719
00:47:28,554 --> 00:47:30,013
-What is it?
-I love you.

720
00:47:32,391 --> 00:47:33,392
I love you, Ju-kyung.

721
00:47:34,601 --> 00:47:37,271
If you say that out of nowhere…

722
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:38,313
What?

723
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:41,775
You're giving me butterflies.

724
00:47:41,858 --> 00:47:44,278
How was your first class? Was it fun?

725
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:47,781
Yes. It's a basic course,
but all the others seemed so professional.

726
00:47:47,864 --> 00:47:50,409
I'm the only person
who hasn't taken the written exam.

727
00:47:50,492 --> 00:47:52,536
I'll have to study hard
and pass it in one go.

728
00:47:52,619 --> 00:47:55,122
Do you want to go somewhere
after your written exam?

729
00:47:55,205 --> 00:47:57,249
-Where?
-Wherever you want.

730
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:01,920
Why don't we go to the beach?

731
00:48:02,004 --> 00:48:04,381
We could take an early bus
and go see the winter ocean.

732
00:48:04,464 --> 00:48:06,466
Sure, let's do that.

733
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:10,929
Can I please have this?

734
00:48:11,013 --> 00:48:11,930
It was for you--

735
00:48:12,431 --> 00:48:14,057
You were upset!

736
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:17,185
Well, I meant to say we can share.

737
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:19,021
You can have some and I can have some.

738
00:48:19,688 --> 00:48:21,148
You skipped tutoring again.

739
00:48:21,898 --> 00:48:24,109
Didn't you learn anything
from the last time?

740
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:25,902
Are you rebelling?

741
00:48:25,986 --> 00:48:29,114
I'm asking you what your problem is!

742
00:48:31,533 --> 00:48:32,409
Give me your phone.

743
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:34,786
Why?

744
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:38,832
I need to see if it's your lowly friends
that are making you so absent-minded

745
00:48:38,915 --> 00:48:42,711
or if it's some boy you're seeing.

746
00:48:42,794 --> 00:48:45,631
-Hand your phone over.
-I won't.

747
00:48:45,714 --> 00:48:46,882
I said, hand it over!

748
00:48:50,927 --> 00:48:52,095
Are you out of your mind?

749
00:48:53,013 --> 00:48:53,847
Honey!

750
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:06,109
-Did you get the table?
-Yes.

751
00:49:07,569 --> 00:49:08,612
I'm hungry.

752
00:49:10,572 --> 00:49:11,406
-Here.
-Good.

753
00:49:12,032 --> 00:49:13,450
-Dad, here's your rice.
-Thanks.

754
00:49:14,576 --> 00:49:16,870
-Please set the soup bowls.
-Sure.

755
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:18,664
For Ju-kyung.

756
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:22,834
Grapefruit, have breakfast.

757
00:49:25,837 --> 00:49:26,755
Here.

758
00:49:26,838 --> 00:49:27,964
Thank you.

759
00:49:28,048 --> 00:49:30,050
Hope you enjoy, Jun-woo.

760
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:32,344
"Jun-woo"?

761
00:49:32,427 --> 00:49:35,597
Don't call him that.
She said he's called grapefruit.

762
00:49:35,681 --> 00:49:38,016
Father, I don't go by grapefruit.

763
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:39,184
"Father"?

764
00:49:39,267 --> 00:49:41,353
Your cheeks are as red as a grapefruit.

765
00:49:43,188 --> 00:49:45,774
I don't need to call you Mr. Han
at home, right?

766
00:49:45,857 --> 00:49:46,692
Jun-woo.

767
00:49:47,192 --> 00:49:48,193
Don't push it.

768
00:49:48,694 --> 00:49:52,197
Why did you break up with her over me?
That just made me feel bad.

769
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:55,075
Vacation starts today
and I'm moving up a grade, so it's fine.

770
00:49:55,158 --> 00:49:56,243
Ju-kyung,

771
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:58,120
I'm so embarrassed.

772
00:49:58,203 --> 00:50:01,081
There's no need for that.
We'll be a family soon, Jun-woo.

773
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:06,712
Hee-kyung, what's going on?

774
00:50:06,795 --> 00:50:09,089
What do you mean?
You're stuck with me now.

775
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:10,340
There's the sleep.

776
00:50:13,135 --> 00:50:15,512
Let's eat! Eat, Grapefruit!

777
00:50:15,595 --> 00:50:17,139
-Thank you.
-Let's eat.

778
00:50:25,105 --> 00:50:26,606
-Really?
-That's crazy!

779
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:27,524
What the heck?

780
00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:42,581
-Hey, she's here.
-Really?

781
00:50:43,331 --> 00:50:44,458
How could she do that?

782
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:48,003
Gosh, she's a psychopath.

783
00:50:48,086 --> 00:50:51,631
Ju-kyung, did you get to check
the anonymous forum?

784
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:52,632
The anonymous forum?

785
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:57,971
-She didn't even check it?
-I feel bad for her.

786
00:50:59,181 --> 00:51:00,891
There're hundreds of comments.

787
00:51:00,974 --> 00:51:01,808
All about her.

788
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:04,144
I'll tell you about what I heard
in the girls' restroom.

789
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:06,396
Junior Kang Su-jin from class five
is super creepy.

790
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:09,775
She's the one who submitted
Lim Ju-kyung's video and pictures.

791
00:51:09,858 --> 00:51:12,861
They were best friends, but when
Soo-ho and Ju-kyung started dating,

792
00:51:12,944 --> 00:51:14,571
she got super jealous
and betrayed her friend.

793
00:51:14,654 --> 00:51:15,697
I'm not making this up.

794
00:51:15,781 --> 00:51:18,950
I saw another friend
yelling at Su-jin about it myself.

795
00:51:19,034 --> 00:51:20,786
Just like a villain in a drama, right?

796
00:51:20,869 --> 00:51:24,122
Is she a psychopath or something?
She's a total backstabber for sure.

797
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:26,750
Unbelievable. She went too far.

798
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:28,668
How could she do that to a friend?

799
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:30,128
Betraying a friend over a guy?

800
00:51:30,212 --> 00:51:32,672
She's the worst.
I never thought she was that mean.

801
00:51:33,507 --> 00:51:35,008
Don't you feel bad for Ju-kyung?

802
00:51:35,091 --> 00:51:36,426
-I do.
-I know.

803
00:51:39,387 --> 00:51:42,182
Did you take that picture
of Soo-ho and Ju-kyung in secret?

804
00:51:42,265 --> 00:51:44,684
Are you a stalker? That's really scary.

805
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:47,521
How is Kang Su-jin going to
show her face at school?

806
00:51:47,604 --> 00:51:49,272
-Right?
-Practically impossible.

807
00:51:49,356 --> 00:51:50,732
-She's a criminal.
-Terrible.

808
00:51:50,816 --> 00:51:52,943
-She's troubled.
-That's totally crazy.

809
00:51:53,026 --> 00:51:54,152
Lim Ju-kyung.

810
00:51:54,236 --> 00:51:55,904
You think you destroyed her, don't you?

811
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:58,073
It's you who's destroyed.

812
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:02,702
-She's a serious stalker.
-What? She's leaving.

813
00:52:08,208 --> 00:52:09,543
That's ridiculous.

814
00:52:11,837 --> 00:52:12,963
Su-jin!

815
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:14,589
Su-jin!

816
00:52:16,216 --> 00:52:17,133
Where are you going?

817
00:52:18,885 --> 00:52:20,178
Why are you running away?

818
00:52:25,684 --> 00:52:29,229
Do you still have nothing to say to me?

819
00:52:31,815 --> 00:52:33,066
You aren't sorry at all?

820
00:52:34,276 --> 00:52:36,653
No, I'm not sorry at all.

821
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:40,991
Even so,

822
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:44,286
I don't want things
to be like this between us.

823
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:49,124
So I'm reaching out one last time.

824
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:51,585
I don't want regrets later.

825
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:56,923
Su-jin, let's not do this, please?

826
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:07,475
Do you think I'd take your hand?

827
00:53:10,103 --> 00:53:13,523
Do you really believe
that we can go back to how we were?

828
00:53:26,244 --> 00:53:27,537
Ju-kyung, was it?

829
00:53:27,621 --> 00:53:29,164
Nice to meet you.

830
00:53:34,753 --> 00:53:35,587
Let's go!

831
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:54,290
Eyeshadow, mascara.

832
00:55:00,338 --> 00:55:03,258
On the side of the eyes…

833
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:17,480
NATIONAL MAKEUP ARTIST LICENSE
WRITTEN EXAM CENTER

834
00:55:22,569 --> 00:55:23,778
Did you do badly?

835
00:55:25,196 --> 00:55:27,741
It's okay, you can do better next time.

836
00:55:28,408 --> 00:55:29,617
I passed!

837
00:55:31,953 --> 00:55:32,787
Well done.

838
00:55:34,581 --> 00:55:36,833
-I passed.
-Great job.

839
00:55:36,916 --> 00:55:38,501
I guessed on one problem and got it right.

840
00:55:38,585 --> 00:55:40,503
-You were lucky.
-Yes.

841
00:55:41,296 --> 00:55:42,630
I can't breathe.

842
00:55:47,761 --> 00:55:50,305
Rise up, spirit of the tiger. Roar!

843
00:55:51,139 --> 00:55:52,265
Is this a recyclable?

844
00:55:56,186 --> 00:55:57,562
Whatever. I'm throwing it out.

845
00:56:09,616 --> 00:56:12,619
LIM JU-KYUNG

846
00:56:17,749 --> 00:56:19,918
You must feel lighter
now that the exam is over.

847
00:56:20,001 --> 00:56:21,336
I'm just getting started.

848
00:56:21,419 --> 00:56:23,505
I hear the written exam is nothing.

849
00:56:23,588 --> 00:56:25,882
I need to start studying
for the practical exam.

850
00:56:25,965 --> 00:56:27,634
It'll be harder to go on dates then.

851
00:56:28,468 --> 00:56:30,428
You should be studying too.

852
00:56:31,513 --> 00:56:33,973
Speaking of,
I don't see you studying much lately.

853
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:37,477
I've been so distracted by you.

854
00:56:39,604 --> 00:56:40,688
Wait a minute.

855
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:44,734
It's Seo-jun.

856
00:56:52,325 --> 00:56:53,243
Hello?

857
00:56:54,285 --> 00:56:56,162
Hey, are you done with your exam?

858
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:58,331
I'm taking your call since it's over.

859
00:56:58,414 --> 00:56:59,707
Why? What's up?

860
00:57:01,376 --> 00:57:03,336
Can I see you right now?

861
00:57:04,337 --> 00:57:05,296
Right now?

862
00:57:07,423 --> 00:57:09,425
I'm with Soo-ho right now.
Can we both come?

863
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:13,721
No. I need to see you alone.
I have to tell you something.

864
00:57:14,973 --> 00:57:16,933
Well, today is actually…

865
00:57:17,016 --> 00:57:19,269
Remember how you have to grant me a wish?

866
00:57:20,395 --> 00:57:21,980
I'll send you the location.

867
00:57:22,063 --> 00:57:22,939
See you there.

868
00:57:26,693 --> 00:57:27,610
Hey, Seo-jun.

869
00:57:29,070 --> 00:57:29,946
What was that?

870
00:57:30,029 --> 00:57:31,114
What did he say?

871
00:57:32,115 --> 00:57:34,868
He wants to meet to tell me something.

872
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:36,453
I'll tell him we should postpone.

873
00:57:38,705 --> 00:57:39,831
Go.

874
00:57:41,416 --> 00:57:43,209
-What?
-Go meet him.

875
00:57:49,674 --> 00:57:50,717
Seo-jun!

876
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:54,471
Why did you wait outside when it's cold?

877
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:56,556
Your nose is red.

878
00:58:01,436 --> 00:58:03,229
What was so urgent?

879
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:14,908
Let's go eat something.

880
00:58:28,671 --> 00:58:29,964
You're buying, okay?

881
00:58:30,673 --> 00:58:33,218
You're using your wish.
Why didn't you pick something better?

882
00:58:33,301 --> 00:58:35,386
-It's your favorite.
-It is.

883
00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:37,222
I could have this all week.

884
00:58:41,059 --> 00:58:42,852
So what did you want to tell me?

885
00:58:43,603 --> 00:58:45,772
You didn't ask to see me just for this,
did you?

886
00:58:47,982 --> 00:58:48,983
I need dating advice.

887
00:58:49,067 --> 00:58:50,985
What? Really?

888
00:58:53,863 --> 00:58:56,574
But what do I know about dating?

889
00:58:58,451 --> 00:59:01,079
Tell me then.
I'm not sure I'll be much help, though.

890
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:05,291
-I like this girl.
-Okay.

891
00:59:07,877 --> 00:59:08,878
But I'm giving her up.

892
00:59:09,462 --> 00:59:11,881
Why? Have you told her how you feel?

893
00:59:11,965 --> 00:59:12,882
No.

894
00:59:13,466 --> 00:59:15,301
You're giving up without telling her?

895
00:59:16,135 --> 00:59:17,554
She has a boyfriend.

896
00:59:20,515 --> 00:59:22,976
Why did it have to be
someone with a boyfriend?

897
00:59:24,143 --> 00:59:25,353
Do you like her a lot?

898
00:59:25,937 --> 00:59:26,813
I do.

899
00:59:27,438 --> 00:59:28,273
A lot.

900
00:59:28,356 --> 00:59:29,857
Goodness.

901
00:59:31,150 --> 00:59:32,485
Steal her from her boyfriend.

902
00:59:34,904 --> 00:59:35,738
Should I?

903
00:59:36,698 --> 00:59:38,366
So who is it? Someone at our school?

904
00:59:39,576 --> 00:59:41,744
Not telling. It's a secret.

905
00:59:48,293 --> 00:59:49,210
Wait.

906
00:59:51,004 --> 00:59:51,838
Is it…

907
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:01,598
Is it Su-ah?

908
01:00:02,807 --> 01:00:05,268
You can't steal her, you jerk.
What about Tae-hoon?

909
01:00:05,351 --> 01:00:07,770
No, it's not her.

910
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:09,564
It's not?

911
01:00:11,733 --> 01:00:14,360
Then who could it be
that you're pining for her?

912
01:00:14,444 --> 01:00:15,987
She must be really pretty.

913
01:00:17,530 --> 01:00:18,364
Yes.

914
01:00:19,073 --> 01:00:19,907
She is.

915
01:00:21,075 --> 01:00:22,285
I have high standards.

916
01:00:23,036 --> 01:00:26,122
If she's that pretty,
you should have made a move sooner.

917
01:00:27,999 --> 01:00:28,833
If I had,

918
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:30,877
do you think we'd be together?

919
01:00:31,961 --> 01:00:33,671
But what's the point now?

920
01:00:34,839 --> 01:00:38,051
There's nothing else I can do for you,
so I'll get you one more…

921
01:00:38,134 --> 01:00:38,968
No.

922
01:00:39,636 --> 01:00:41,721
I'll get you anything you want to eat.

923
01:00:41,804 --> 01:00:44,349
-Excuse me, can we get two more?
-Sure!

924
01:00:44,432 --> 01:00:46,059
She's so clueless.

925
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:48,978
Want some fritters? Anything else?

926
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:19,926
It smells good.

927
01:01:35,733 --> 01:01:39,404
Option one, option two, and option three.

928
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:42,281
Which place do you like?

929
01:02:19,235 --> 01:02:20,820
I'm sorry I kept you waiting.

930
01:02:21,696 --> 01:02:22,822
It was your hair, right?

931
01:02:23,448 --> 01:02:24,407
It looks very pretty.

932
01:02:25,324 --> 01:02:28,244
I called to let you know I'd be late,
but you didn't answer.

933
01:02:28,327 --> 01:02:29,996
I forgot and left my phone at home.

934
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:32,415
What? Jeez.

935
01:02:34,208 --> 01:02:35,918
-Here.
-What is it?

936
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:38,212
Wait, this is…

937
01:02:39,172 --> 01:02:40,089
Did you make this?

938
01:02:40,173 --> 01:02:42,925
Some girl asked me to.
She even gave me the yarn.

939
01:02:43,509 --> 01:02:45,887
I wasn't asking you to make it for me.

940
01:02:45,970 --> 01:02:48,765
I gave you all that
since it helps calm the mind.

941
01:02:48,848 --> 01:02:50,349
But it's pretty.

942
01:02:50,433 --> 01:02:52,101
Prettier than the ones from a store.

943
01:02:53,019 --> 01:02:54,103
Here.

944
01:02:58,316 --> 01:02:59,942
Put it around your neck like this.

945
01:03:00,693 --> 01:03:02,945
-How does it look?
-Pretty.

946
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:07,116
The bus is here. Let's go.

947
01:03:32,058 --> 01:03:34,393
Feeding the sheep made me hungry.

948
01:03:35,019 --> 01:03:37,063
I heard your tummy
make a thundering sound.

949
01:03:37,146 --> 01:03:38,439
That was from the sheep.

950
01:03:39,106 --> 01:03:40,024
Right.

951
01:03:40,107 --> 01:03:42,151
I'm going to post the pictures
on Newstagram.

952
01:03:42,902 --> 01:03:45,822
NEW POST
#LOVESTAGRAM

953
01:03:47,865 --> 01:03:50,660
-Why are you only posting your picture?
-What?

954
01:03:51,536 --> 01:03:52,620
I thought you'd mind.

955
01:03:53,371 --> 01:03:54,455
I don't mind.

956
01:03:56,207 --> 01:03:57,333
I'll post you too, then.

957
01:04:00,294 --> 01:04:02,338
Lovestagram, couple's trip,

958
01:04:02,421 --> 01:04:05,299
boyfriend, healing, couple photo.

959
01:04:05,383 --> 01:04:06,342
It's uploaded.

960
01:04:08,010 --> 01:04:09,178
We look nice.

961
01:04:12,223 --> 01:04:15,101
-What do you want to eat?
-What should we have?

962
01:04:28,114 --> 01:04:30,533
Why are you laughing?
Did you draw me weirdly?

963
01:04:30,616 --> 01:04:31,534
Not at all.

964
01:04:31,617 --> 01:04:32,493
Let me see.

965
01:04:33,703 --> 01:04:35,496
Let's show each other at the same time.

966
01:04:35,580 --> 01:04:36,998
One, two, three!

967
01:04:45,089 --> 01:04:47,300
So you do have something
you're not good at.

968
01:04:48,384 --> 01:04:49,218
But it looks cute.

969
01:04:50,219 --> 01:04:51,304
Sure, it's pretty.

970
01:04:51,387 --> 01:04:52,722
Let me see mine.

971
01:04:53,389 --> 01:04:55,057
I did well, right?

972
01:04:55,641 --> 01:04:56,976
My nostrils are too…

973
01:04:57,059 --> 01:04:59,061
It's not finished yet.

974
01:05:00,313 --> 01:05:02,231
Hold on, I'll make them smaller.

975
01:05:13,618 --> 01:05:14,702
You're doing so well.

976
01:05:17,121 --> 01:05:18,080
Watch your step.

977
01:05:42,647 --> 01:05:44,106
I'm going to push it for real!

978
01:05:45,733 --> 01:05:47,568
-Are you having fun?
-Yes!

979
01:06:22,687 --> 01:06:24,563
Hi, it's been a while.

980
01:06:25,272 --> 01:06:28,651
-Sure, it's been a while.
-Hey, watch your language.

981
01:06:28,734 --> 01:06:29,819
You dropped the honorifics first.

982
01:06:29,902 --> 01:06:32,738
I heard you're Ju-kyung's friend.
I'm her older sister.

983
01:06:33,572 --> 01:06:35,408
Ms. Lim, you're Ju-kyung's older sister?

984
01:06:36,409 --> 01:06:37,660
Yes.

985
01:06:37,743 --> 01:06:40,162
Why do we have two beautiful guys here?

986
01:06:40,246 --> 01:06:41,831
Am I in heaven?

987
01:06:41,914 --> 01:06:42,915
No!

988
01:06:50,297 --> 01:06:51,924
You're that drunkard who went nuts?

989
01:06:52,967 --> 01:06:53,801
"Went nuts"?

990
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:56,762
-You've seen me like that?
-What brings you here?

991
01:06:56,846 --> 01:06:58,889
Haven't you heard how you blew up?

992
01:06:59,473 --> 01:07:00,433
I blew up how?

993
01:07:01,225 --> 01:07:06,355
Didn't you know your video was trending
on Newstagram and NerTube? Look.

994
01:07:06,439 --> 01:07:10,067
Stolen my heart…

995
01:07:10,151 --> 01:07:12,111
-So what?
-What do you mean?

996
01:07:13,112 --> 01:07:14,822
You still won't train to be a singer?

997
01:07:15,364 --> 01:07:16,615
Will you just keep working here?

998
01:07:16,699 --> 01:07:18,701
I'll acknowledge it if this is your dream.

999
01:07:18,784 --> 01:07:20,828
But I heard you wanted to be a singer.

1000
01:07:21,412 --> 01:07:24,874
Do you think I'll ever go back
to your company?

1001
01:07:25,458 --> 01:07:26,459
Why not?

1002
01:07:27,043 --> 01:07:29,295
You know we have
completely new management now.

1003
01:07:29,879 --> 01:07:32,381
It's not the same company
you used to know.

1004
01:07:34,091 --> 01:07:36,218
Why are you trying so hard
to get me on board?

1005
01:07:39,805 --> 01:07:41,640
I have a good feeling about you.

1006
01:07:41,724 --> 01:07:44,685
I saw your trainee videos
when I was looking for Leo.

1007
01:07:45,728 --> 01:07:48,647
You should sing again. Please?

1008
01:07:48,731 --> 01:07:50,316
I want you to sing again.

1009
01:07:50,941 --> 01:07:53,652
I know Se-yeon would want that too.

1010
01:08:00,284 --> 01:08:01,160
Hello?

1011
01:08:01,243 --> 01:08:02,995
Seo-jun, are you with Soo-ho right now?

1012
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:55,881
Let's take pictures.

1013
01:08:55,965 --> 01:08:56,799
-Pictures?
-Yes.

1014
01:08:56,882 --> 01:08:58,467
I'll go get the phone. Wait here.

1015
01:09:19,071 --> 01:09:24,076
I LOVE YOU, SOO-HO

1016
01:09:26,287 --> 01:09:27,413
Ju-kyung!

1017
01:09:29,832 --> 01:09:30,791
What did you write?

1018
01:09:35,379 --> 01:09:37,464
-If you didn't see it, forget it.
-What was it?

1019
01:09:37,548 --> 01:09:39,049
You know, some stuff.

1020
01:09:41,218 --> 01:09:43,470
-Stand over there.
-Okay.

1021
01:09:47,224 --> 01:09:48,934
I guess the battery ran out.

1022
01:09:49,018 --> 01:09:50,853
Maybe we took too many pictures earlier.

1023
01:09:52,062 --> 01:09:54,106
We won't get any pictures
at the beach then.

1024
01:09:54,690 --> 01:09:56,942
-Want to come back later and take more?
-Sure.

1025
01:09:57,026 --> 01:09:58,360
Let's go.

1026
01:10:00,905 --> 01:10:03,490
-Let's go find a place to charge it.
-Are you warm now?

1027
01:10:03,574 --> 01:10:06,035
Hey, Lee Soo-ho!

1028
01:10:07,411 --> 01:10:08,746
Hey, Lee Soo-ho!

1029
01:10:08,829 --> 01:10:10,956
The person you are trying to reach is…

1030
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:13,042
Why aren't either of them picking up?

1031
01:10:15,044 --> 01:10:18,380
-Hey, Seo-jun. What's up?
-Are you with Su-ah?

1032
01:10:19,298 --> 01:10:21,133
Ask her if Ju-kyung is with Soo-ho today.

1033
01:10:23,010 --> 01:10:23,928
The beach?

1034
01:10:27,806 --> 01:10:29,725
-It looks delicious.
-Let's eat.

1035
01:10:34,980 --> 01:10:36,106
Have this too.

1036
01:10:36,732 --> 01:10:37,775
It's delicious.

1037
01:10:38,567 --> 01:10:39,860
I guess I have two stomachs.

1038
01:10:39,944 --> 01:10:42,112
I had so much tteokbokki
with Seo-jun yesterday,

1039
01:10:42,196 --> 01:10:43,322
but I can still eat today.

1040
01:10:43,906 --> 01:10:45,741
-Did you have a nice talk?
-Yes.

1041
01:10:46,825 --> 01:10:48,160
He asked for dating advice.

1042
01:10:51,288 --> 01:10:52,122
Do you think…

1043
01:10:52,831 --> 01:10:54,375
he has feelings for Su-ah?

1044
01:10:56,710 --> 01:10:57,920
What?

1045
01:10:58,003 --> 01:10:59,630
That would make things complicated.

1046
01:11:00,673 --> 01:11:02,091
But he said it wasn't her.

1047
01:11:03,676 --> 01:11:05,094
This one's fully cooked.

1048
01:11:12,977 --> 01:11:13,936
Why are you laughing?

1049
01:11:14,728 --> 01:11:16,188
I need a photo of this.

1050
01:11:16,272 --> 01:11:18,107
Why? Do I have something on my face?

1051
01:11:18,190 --> 01:11:19,024
Here.

1052
01:11:26,532 --> 01:11:28,200
-All done.
-Did you put more on me?

1053
01:11:29,076 --> 01:11:30,536
-Yes.
-Come on.

1054
01:11:31,287 --> 01:11:33,247
Try the instant noodles. They're so good.

1055
01:11:37,626 --> 01:11:38,877
Why aren't they picking up?

1056
01:11:45,884 --> 01:11:46,719
Here.

1057
01:11:48,262 --> 01:11:50,764
-Aren't you cold?
-I'm all right.

1058
01:11:51,390 --> 01:11:52,975
Let's visit again when it's warm.

1059
01:11:53,559 --> 01:11:55,602
Sure, let's do that.

1060
01:11:57,980 --> 01:11:59,106
You know,

1061
01:12:00,566 --> 01:12:04,445
what I wrote in the sand earlier…

1062
01:12:06,071 --> 01:12:07,114
It was…

1063
01:12:32,348 --> 01:12:33,932
Why did you close your eyes?

1064
01:12:41,190 --> 01:12:42,983
That hurts!

1065
01:12:43,067 --> 01:12:46,278
-I got sand in my eye.
-What were you thinking about?

1066
01:12:46,862 --> 01:12:47,905
What?

1067
01:12:47,988 --> 01:12:49,698
About the sand in my eye.

1068
01:13:14,723 --> 01:13:16,975
-Watch your hand.
-Okay.

1069
01:13:25,901 --> 01:13:26,985
It's pretty.

1070
01:13:29,655 --> 01:13:31,824
Let's take a picture to remember this.

1071
01:13:31,907 --> 01:13:34,076
Shall we?
I'll go see if the phone's charged.

1072
01:13:35,369 --> 01:13:36,370
Wait here.

1073
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:47,923
Is it all charged?

1074
01:13:50,259 --> 01:13:52,302
-Seo-jun!
-Where's Soo-ho?

1075
01:13:53,053 --> 01:13:53,887
What?

1076
01:13:57,850 --> 01:13:58,934
How did you know where we were?

1077
01:14:00,686 --> 01:14:03,439
Hey, you should've brought your phone.

1078
01:14:03,522 --> 01:14:04,773
What is it?

1079
01:14:04,857 --> 01:14:05,732
Soo-ho.

1080
01:14:16,493 --> 01:14:19,538
ACTOR LEE JU-HUN IN SURGERY
FOR BRAIN HEMORRHAGE IN THE STATES

1081
01:15:00,913 --> 01:15:02,456
He'll be fine.

1082
01:15:02,539 --> 01:15:03,373
Right.

1083
01:15:04,208 --> 01:15:05,667
He'll be fine.

1084
01:15:12,007 --> 01:15:14,551
Soo-ho, it's time for your flight.

1085
01:15:34,321 --> 01:15:36,990
You head back. I should go upstairs.

1086
01:15:39,243 --> 01:15:40,118
Seo-jun.

1087
01:15:40,911 --> 01:15:43,539
Can you take Ju-kyung home for me?

1088
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:46,625
Don't worry.

1089
01:15:54,508 --> 01:15:55,384
Soo-ho.

1090
01:16:03,934 --> 01:16:05,477
Don't worry…

1091
01:16:07,145 --> 01:16:08,647
and have a safe journey.

1092
01:16:10,899 --> 01:16:11,900
I love you.

1093
01:16:29,835 --> 01:16:31,211
I'll call you when I arrive.

1094
01:16:35,507 --> 01:16:36,633
Bye.

1095
01:17:17,299 --> 01:17:18,550
What do I do?

1096
01:17:19,718 --> 01:17:21,470
What if he passes away?

1097
01:17:23,555 --> 01:17:25,307
Poor Soo-ho.

1098
01:18:30,914 --> 01:18:33,417
2 YEARS LATER

1099
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:36,420
-If you don't drink, you'll be in trouble.
-We get it.

1100
01:18:36,503 --> 01:18:37,879
Hyun-kyu, you take the shot.

1101
01:18:38,922 --> 01:18:40,382
Whatever!

1102
01:18:41,466 --> 01:18:44,636
This is all useless.

1103
01:18:45,470 --> 01:18:46,888
Ju-kyung's out.

1104
01:18:46,972 --> 01:18:48,765
Hey, Limju, are you asleep?

1105
01:18:48,849 --> 01:18:50,016
Limju!

1106
01:18:50,100 --> 01:18:51,685
-Hey, is he coming?
-Yes.

1107
01:18:51,768 --> 01:18:54,312
He should be here to take care of her.
Where is he?

1108
01:18:56,690 --> 01:18:58,233
He's here. Hey, over here!

1109
01:18:58,316 --> 01:19:01,027
-Hey, over here!
-Look at the time.

1110
01:19:01,111 --> 01:19:05,157
-Come here already.
-Guys, who got her this drunk?

1111
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:06,742
-She did it to herself.
-Don't blame us.

1112
01:19:06,825 --> 01:19:08,410
-It's unfair.
-She drank it herself.

1113
01:19:09,327 --> 01:19:10,203
Ju-kyung.

1114
01:19:10,287 --> 01:19:11,663
Ju-kyung!

1115
01:19:11,747 --> 01:19:12,581
I'm here.

1116
01:19:14,833 --> 01:19:16,293
-Wake up.
-What?

1117
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:25,135
-You're here.
-I am.

1118
01:20:04,716 --> 01:20:06,176
It's snowing here.

1119
01:20:08,136 --> 01:20:09,554
I hope the place you're in

1120
01:20:09,638 --> 01:20:12,724
is not cold but warm.

1121
01:20:12,808 --> 01:20:15,227
Don't wait for my calls anymore.

1122
01:20:15,310 --> 01:20:16,645
Sleep well.

1123
01:20:18,104 --> 01:20:20,065
One, two, three!

1124
01:20:20,607 --> 01:20:22,484
You held back your feelings for two years…

1125
01:20:22,567 --> 01:20:23,902
Whatever!

1126
01:20:23,985 --> 01:20:25,403
-I'm not drunk.
-…then told her in a fit of anger.

1127
01:20:25,487 --> 01:20:28,198
Shouldn't you know how I feel by now?

1128
01:20:28,281 --> 01:20:29,950
Because I missed you.

1129
01:20:30,033 --> 01:20:31,618
I didn't miss you.

1130
01:20:33,995 --> 01:20:39,000
