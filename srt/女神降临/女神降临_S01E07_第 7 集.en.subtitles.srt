1
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:57,724
Sunil High School's ace player,
Ryu Hyeong-jin.

2
00:00:57,807 --> 00:01:02,187
His record for this season is 6-0,
with the lowest ERA.

3
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:13,198
The batter swings. A strikeout!

4
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:16,076
-What's the situation?
-Two outs, bottom of the ninth.

5
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,202
Tied five to five.

6
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:18,578
Ryu Hyeong-jin!

7
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:21,372
What's this? Ryu Hyeong-jin?

8
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:23,333
Is there something wrong?

9
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,044
Did the screen just freeze?

10
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:28,880
What's going on?

11
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:41,226
She struck me hard.

12
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:51,444
-Hi.
-Hello, sir.

13
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:52,654
Hi.

14
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:54,614
-Sir.
-Sir!

15
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:57,158
-You changed your hair!
-Your face is glowing.

16
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:58,243
You look so handsome.

17
00:01:58,326 --> 00:02:00,328
I obviously knew you were handsome.

18
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,705
The classroom is that way.

19
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:03,790
We know.

20
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:06,292
-You look stunning.
-You look good.

21
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:07,877
-Bye!
-See you later, sir!

22
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,137
This is all thanks to Hee-kyung's…

23
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:20,140
Ju-kyung's mom.

24
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:25,103
BASED ON WEBTOON TRUE BEAUTY
BY YAONGYI

25
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:32,443
How could she not even call once

26
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:34,737
during the time my brows have all set?

27
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:38,074
Is a kiss meaningless to you?

28
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:39,993
My lips aren't easy--

29
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:41,661
-Hello?
-Good morning, sir.

30
00:02:41,744 --> 00:02:44,372
Hello? This is Han Jun-woo.

31
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:45,665
Go lower.

32
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:47,000
Keep your form.

33
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:49,919
-Do it right.
-Good morning.

34
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,590
Had the karaoke owner called the cops,

35
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:56,092
you would have been transferred. Got it?

36
00:02:56,175 --> 00:02:57,886
Sir, it wasn't us!

37
00:02:57,969 --> 00:02:58,970
-Cho-rong!
-Cho-rong!

38
00:02:59,053 --> 00:03:01,764
Who else from our school
would fight in a karaoke room

39
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,057
other than you punks?

40
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,019
Bring them in if you can.

41
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:07,687
It really wasn't us.

42
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,772
-Jeez, we didn't do it.
-We swear it.

43
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:11,274
Did I just hear "jeez"?

44
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:13,359
It was me!

45
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:17,030
I was in the fight.

46
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:18,698
Seo-jun!

47
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:21,701
I was going to call you in anyway.

48
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:22,994
Come stand next to them.

49
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:25,872
You punks always cause trouble together.

50
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:27,081
Get into position!

51
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:30,627
-Are you serious, Seo-jun?
-Don't look. It's embarrassing.

52
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:31,878
Be quiet.

53
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:34,130
-The group fight was us.
-That was us.

54
00:03:34,213 --> 00:03:35,882
-Excuse me?
-Guys!

55
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:38,635
They say it's always the quiet ones,
but what were you thinking?

56
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:40,720
Come stand next to them. Go on!

57
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:42,388
Stand there.

58
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,724
Get in position. Do it right!

59
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:46,893
What were you all thinking?

60
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:49,979
You all have serious issues.

61
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:53,066
I was also in the fight.

62
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:56,069
This is absolutely outrageous.

63
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:57,528
My goodness.

64
00:03:58,196 --> 00:03:59,239
I started it.

65
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:01,658
That group fight.

66
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,035
Well done. You must be proud.

67
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:06,371
Well!

68
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:11,668
Goodness.

69
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:13,419
Our star student.

70
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:15,171
Did you get hurt anywhere?

71
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,339
Are you all right?

72
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:20,426
What the heck did those
Yongpa High punks do

73
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:24,555
to get you, our dear Soo-ho,
involved in a brawl?

74
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,683
Mr. Han Jun-woo?

75
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,935
-Mr. Han Jun-woo?
-Yes.

76
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:30,853
Right. I have a flower delivery for you.

77
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:34,232
A flower delivery!

78
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,442
-Flowers?
-Yes.

79
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:39,279
-From who?
-Well, Ms. Lim Hee--

80
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:42,490
I'm sorry.

81
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:44,367
No worries.

82
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:47,453
I know. I think I know who sent them.

83
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:51,499
You guys…

84
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:53,668
go wait in the guidance office.

85
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:55,503
-You!
-Yes?

86
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:56,421
And the others…

87
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:58,923
To the guidance office.

88
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,466
-Me?
-Us?

89
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:07,974
Did you get the flowers?

90
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:08,891
Ms. Lim Hee-kyung.

91
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,561
Why did you send me flowers?

92
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:15,523
I mean, can't a woman
send a man some flowers?

93
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:17,317
We even shared a kiss.

94
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:18,860
Ms. Lim Hee-kyung.

95
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:20,320
They're bridalwreath spirea flowers.

96
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:21,237
Bride…

97
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:22,989
A bride's what?

98
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:25,158
Bridalwreath spirea!

99
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:27,160
I see.

100
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:29,329
The flowers themselves are not the point.

101
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:31,831
Do you know what they symbolize?

102
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,000
They mean, "I'll try."

103
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:37,920
I'm trying to make you my man, you know.

104
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,717
So think of me
when you look at those flowers.

105
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:45,428
I leave tomorrow for a business trip.

106
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:46,721
Are you free this evening?

107
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:47,722
Well…

108
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:49,223
No, I'm busy.

109
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:51,350
It's exam week, so it's been busy…

110
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:53,227
I guess I'm the only disappointed one.

111
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,647
You still don't want to
buy a new pair of shoes?

112
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:58,733
Think hard about it.

113
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:12,914
I'M SORRY

114
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:26,135
Are you all some master calligraphers?
You're putting in too much effort.

115
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:27,887
Why don't you make your own ink too?

116
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:30,723
How will you fill out
ten pages at that speed?

117
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:31,766
All right, watch.

118
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:33,976
Look how I'm doing it.

119
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,311
How's this?

120
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:38,189
All those hours spent writing lines
have left me ambidextrous.

121
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:39,440
Are you impressed?

122
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:43,361
Babe, do you think they've ever
written a reflection letter?

123
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:44,278
Look.

124
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:52,328
Ta-da.

125
00:06:52,411 --> 00:06:53,830
Good for you.

126
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:54,997
I'm sorry, guys.

127
00:06:55,873 --> 00:06:57,500
This is all because of me.

128
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,043
Don't say that.

129
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:00,002
Hey, Seo-jun.

130
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,506
Apologize to Ju-kyung properly.

131
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:06,551
We're in this mess because
they thought she was your girlfriend!

132
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:07,969
Well…

133
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:10,138
She looks healthy enough.

134
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:12,098
What are your legs for?

135
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:14,934
You should've run.

136
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:16,936
Then is your mouth for annoying people?

137
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:18,146
Enough.

138
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:20,690
They won't look for you ever again.

139
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,108
So don't worry.

140
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:27,613
Don't tell me you sought them out
and fought with them.

141
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:29,115
What do you mean by fight?

142
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:31,742
They're not even on my level.

143
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,330
More like I beat them up.

144
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:41,461
-"Beat them up"?
-"Beat them up"?

145
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:47,049
I'm scared.

146
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:48,801
Let's just finish these quickly.

147
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:50,094
Okay, Su-ah.

148
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:52,972
Gosh, he's frightening.

149
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:03,691
Hey, Soo-ho.

150
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:07,695
No matter where things stand between us,

151
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:09,572
my mom's situation is a separate issue,

152
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:12,366
and I'm grateful for your help there.

153
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:14,577
Even so,

154
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:18,581
stay out of my business from now on.

155
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:28,049
What's this?

156
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:29,467
What are you playing at?

157
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:32,053
I fell asleep.

158
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:37,808
What the…

159
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:41,103
What's wrong with him?

160
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:52,365
Roar!

161
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:56,953
Hey!

162
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:00,581
-What?
-Do that thing.

163
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:03,042
-Do what thing?
-You know what.

164
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:04,585
The "roar."

165
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:06,212
What?

166
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:07,255
Whatever…

167
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:10,550
Roar!

168
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:15,221
Not in my wildest nightmares
do I want to see that.

169
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:16,556
You're a wild beast.

170
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:19,892
What was that?

171
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:22,770
There's no way.

172
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,356
I hope you're studying hard for the exam.

173
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:29,068
Sir, can you please remove some chapters
from the material we have to cover?

174
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:30,111
Just this much.

175
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:33,239
-There's too much to review!
-Please, sir!

176
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:36,909
Some may not be aware of
what their heart's desire is,

177
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:39,453
and some may hesitate,
though they know what they want.

178
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:43,165
As opportunity presents itself randomly
like a sudden storm in summer,

179
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:45,126
only the prepared can seize it.

180
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:48,921
If you want to take the opportunity
to make your dreams come true…

181
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:51,632
Gosh, sir, thank you so much
for your encouragement.

182
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:53,134
You're the best! Bye.

183
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:55,595
-Thank you!
-Let's go!

184
00:09:57,471 --> 00:09:59,265
Hey, who wants to go get tteokbokki?

185
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:00,933
Me!

186
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:04,770
Study hard for your midterm exam…

187
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:07,481
is what I'm trying to say.

188
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,151
Class dismissed.

189
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:16,884
Soo-ho.

190
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:19,261
-Yes.
-Well…

191
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:23,099
They released the newest volume
of Grotesque Scenario.

192
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:25,184
Want to visit Prince Comics with me?

193
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:26,394
No.

194
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:27,436
Okay.

195
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:30,898
What's keeping him so busy then?

196
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:36,654
-Ju-kyung.
-Yes?

197
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,782
But my bus is almost here…

198
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:42,284
I didn't mean you should get in.

199
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:44,578
You said you need better grades.

200
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:48,624
Meet me at the study cafe tomorrow
so we can study together.

201
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:03,889
You want to study together?

202
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:05,599
Why?

203
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:14,275
Obviously, I want to spend time with you.

204
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:23,617
I'll see you tomorrow.

205
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:34,420
It's only early evening at best,
and you say good night?

206
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:38,299
You're thinking about going to bed
instead of studying for your exams?

207
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:39,592
But I was studying.

208
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:42,344
Make sure you rank
30 places higher this time.

209
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:44,513
I'm throwing all of these away otherwise.

210
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:46,390
I get it.

211
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:48,893
You're the one
who's disrupting my studies.

212
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,929
How does he look so handsome
even in his sleep?

213
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:27,848
It gives me butterflies.

214
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:58,170
I don't want to study.

215
00:13:58,254 --> 00:13:59,672
How come you fell asleep?

216
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:01,340
You are not even trying to study.

217
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:03,259
Name the three Blue Deer School poets.

218
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:05,261
One, two, three.

219
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:08,222
Seems you dozed off in class.
How will your grades improve?

220
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:09,640
Goodness, it's intense.

221
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:11,767
You're totally scaring her.

222
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:14,186
You scolded her so much she's hiccuping.

223
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:24,905
Right. Let's go to a baseball game
on the last day of exams.

224
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:26,532
Hyeong-jin has a game that day.

225
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:27,783
I can't. I have tutoring.

226
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:31,662
Sure, I had fun the last time.

227
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:33,038
Yay!

228
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:35,833
But keep it a secret from Tae-hoon, okay?

229
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:38,836
Keep what a secret?

230
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:40,838
Nothing.

231
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,300
Are you getting me
a surprise gift or something?

232
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,051
No. Go back to studying.

233
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:54,894
-We'll be off then.
-Okay.

234
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:56,186
-Bye.
-Be safe!

235
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,271
Let's go.

236
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,233
-I'm leaving.
-Okay, bye.

237
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:04,069
Why does he look so tired?

238
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:06,155
-Let's go.
-Sure, let's.

239
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:08,073
What's this guy doing here?

240
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,243
Ju-kyung.

241
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:14,121
In the karaoke room, I was…

242
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,586
Jeez. I was going to apologize.

243
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,923
Hey, I was going to say I'm sorry.

244
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:25,925
I said it, okay? I did.

245
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:30,763
What's up with him?

246
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:33,682
Why?

247
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,768
Why would he do that?

248
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:38,520
Gosh, you startled me.

249
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:42,232
Hey, you saw that, right?

250
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:43,776
I did it. I apologized.

251
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:03,629
APOLOGIZE

252
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:06,048
What's with this punk?

253
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:07,883
-Apologize!
-Apologize!

254
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:14,807
-Apologize!
-Apologize!

255
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:21,188
-Apologize!
-Apologize!

256
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:24,024
-Apologize!
-Apologize!

257
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:35,119
What is it? What's happening?

258
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:39,164
APOLOGIZE!

259
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:41,542
That crazy idiot!

260
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:45,963
Damn it.

261
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:48,007
Man, I almost had it…

262
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:53,721
Dad, I'm home.

263
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:57,016
Did you cause trouble again?

264
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:58,058
Excuse me?

265
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:14,199
I got no sleep chasing him around.

266
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:20,247
But still, what a relief.

267
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:23,083
I was worried he might hold a grudge
and come visit again.

268
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:25,252
I won't lose sleep over him now.

269
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,756
-Bottoms up, guys!
-Cheers!

270
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:31,508
-Nice job, everyone!
-That must be nice.

271
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:33,385
When will we ever get to be in college?

272
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:36,305
Why do you think
people like alcohol so much?

273
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:38,766
My sister gets wasted when she drinks.
She's like an animal.

274
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:41,435
I guess drinking makes you feel better.

275
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:42,978
Have you tried drinking before?

276
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,316
I took a sip from a bottle
my dad had already opened.

277
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:51,320
What? You've never even tasted it?

278
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:55,449
I don't have the balls,
so I've never even tried to.

279
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:01,914
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

280
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:06,668
The finishing touch.

281
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:13,550
How do I look? Do I look mature enough?

282
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:17,262
You totally look like a college student.
Like a sorority queen.

283
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:18,764
Stop it.

284
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:20,390
I'm thirsty.

285
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:26,438
Hey, our professor's lectures
have been really slow, right?

286
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:27,356
Totally.

287
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:30,901
What do you want to do
on Monday between lectures?

288
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:31,819
I don't know.

289
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:34,113
Maybe lunch with
the department representative?

290
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:35,280
That sounds good.

291
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:38,909
IDs, please.

292
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:43,330
Gosh, I forgot to bring my ID.

293
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:44,414
Do you have yours?

294
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,291
I forgot mine too.

295
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,835
Can we just pay for it?

296
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:48,794
We're in college.

297
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:50,963
-Which one?
-Second year at Hankook University.

298
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:52,589
-What major?
-English Literature.

299
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:56,093
-Your English teacher's name?
-Han Jun-woo!

300
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:57,761
-Ju-kyung.
-You little…

301
00:18:57,845 --> 00:18:58,971
You punks.

302
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:00,848
You're high schoolers, aren't you?

303
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:02,975
Should I call your homeroom teacher?

304
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,810
-We're sorry.
-We're sorry.

305
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:07,312
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

306
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:13,819
That feels nice.

307
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:15,529
It tastes sweet.

308
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:18,991
This looks so good.

309
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:20,325
It smells amazing.

310
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:23,412
How is it?

311
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:25,122
So good!

312
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:27,749
That was really dumb of me, wasn't it?

313
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:31,378
How can you fall for that trick question?

314
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:33,964
Hey, are you okay?

315
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:37,050
Have you been applying some hand cream?

316
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:39,261
It's okay.

317
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:40,512
That looks painful.

318
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:42,389
How did this happen?

319
00:19:42,472 --> 00:19:43,307
Well…

320
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,517
it's because of my habit.

321
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:50,731
I keep washing my hands.
I do it inadvertently when I'm stressed.

322
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:53,650
I need to break out of it,
but it's not easy.

323
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:54,651
Stressed?

324
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:56,153
Why?

325
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:57,404
What do you think?

326
00:19:58,655 --> 00:19:59,531
My grades.

327
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:03,994
If I had your grades,
my parents would treat me like royalty.

328
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:06,538
It's embarrassing as is,
so don't tell anyone, okay?

329
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,334
You're the first friend I've told this to.

330
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:14,463
Thank you.

331
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:16,048
For confiding in me.

332
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,051
What's there to thank?

333
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:24,348
Actually.

334
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,850
I was an outcast at my last school.

335
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:29,770
-What?
-I was.

336
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,732
But now, I'm so glad
I have a friend like you.

337
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:35,943
Please keep this to yourself, okay?

338
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:37,319
Cheers.

339
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:46,119
Blue Deer School.

340
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:50,374
Debuted by recommendation in 1939,
Cho Chi-hun, Pak Tu-jin, Pak Mok-wol…

341
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:56,505
I could have seriously hurt my head.

342
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:58,423
Thank you.

343
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:00,550
I was protecting the tree, okay?

344
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:04,096
It's as hard as a rock.

345
00:21:04,888 --> 00:21:06,306
What? A rock?

346
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:12,271
What are you reading?

347
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:15,148
Stop talking to me.
I can't mess up this exam.

348
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:17,526
We have an exam today?

349
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:19,611
On what?

350
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:20,570
Literature.

351
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:23,991
I get you don't care for studying,
but isn't this a bit much?

352
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:26,451
You're not good at studying either.

353
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:29,830
Hey, at least I put in some effort.

354
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:33,625
What school did Cho Chi-hun, Pak Tu-jin,
and Pak Mok-wol belong to?

355
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:35,961
I couldn't care less for any of that.

356
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:38,839
You dummy. It's the Blue Deer School!

357
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:41,174
This will be on the test, so take note.

358
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:43,802
Life School Poets emerged in the 1930s…

359
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:44,761
Whatever.

360
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:48,432
What's your favorite number
from one to five?

361
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:50,183
Three?

362
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:53,478
I'll mark all my answers number five then.

363
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:15,125
You didn't bring a marker?

364
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:16,501
No. So I borrowed one!

365
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:18,712
You should have told me, I brought three.

366
00:22:18,795 --> 00:22:20,547
I should have borrowed it from you.

367
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:21,757
Do you feel prepared?

368
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,217
No. I always choose three
if I don't know the answer.

369
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:25,719
You should do that too, Limju.

370
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:27,012
No, thanks.

371
00:22:27,095 --> 00:22:28,305
I'll solve my answers.

372
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:32,976
Good luck with your exam. Do your best!

373
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:13,767
No scented candle has been this good.

374
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:15,811
Is it perfume or a scented candle?

375
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:18,230
One handmade scented candle
goes for only 9,000 won.

376
00:23:18,313 --> 00:23:20,565
-I'll take two.
-Thank you, madam!

377
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:22,734
These smell so good.

378
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:25,445
-They do, right?
-Yes, they do.

379
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:26,822
-Thank you.
-Sure.

380
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:29,241
-Good luck with this.
-We'll get one next time.

381
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:30,325
-Okay.
-Good luck!

382
00:23:30,408 --> 00:23:31,284
Thank you.

383
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:36,248
I have a new customer.

384
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:39,960
What do you think you're doing
for days on end in my shop?

385
00:23:40,043 --> 00:23:41,294
I'm making money.

386
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:43,088
I made over 100,000 won today.

387
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:44,881
Shut that mouth.

388
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:47,300
What? You're doing good?

389
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:49,553
-How much for the ingredients?
-5,000 won a pop.

390
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:51,304
-How many did you make?
-50 to start.

391
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:52,973
-How many were sold?
-About 30?

392
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:54,975
You spent 250,000 won
and made 270,000 won.

393
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:56,935
-Your class cost 100,000 won.
-80,000 won.

394
00:23:57,769 --> 00:24:00,313
Including the cost of transportation,
this is a net loss.

395
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:02,149
You're a lost cause.

396
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:04,067
Stop wasting your time and money.

397
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:06,778
Just stay still and breathe in and out.

398
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:08,029
Got it?

399
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:15,996
-Ryu Hyeong-jin!
-Ryu Hyeong-jin!

400
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:18,999
-Ryu Hyeong-jin!
-Ryu Hyeong-jin!

401
00:24:19,082 --> 00:24:20,208
Strike!

402
00:24:23,378 --> 00:24:25,505
By the way, what did you tell Tae-hoon?

403
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:27,799
I told him
it's my grandma's 80th birthday!

404
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:29,801
Many happy returns, ma'am!

405
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:32,470
Quite a birthday party.
Did you borrow the entire stadium?

406
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:34,014
Is this a celebratory game?

407
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:36,641
You thought I wouldn't know?

408
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:40,228
-I'll go cheer for you in the semifinal!
-Spying on my social media activity?

409
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:42,147
That's so creepy. I can't believe it.

410
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:44,858
-Not as much as you lying to me!
-Would you have let me go if I told you?

411
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:46,860
He's just a friend,
but you got so jealous.

412
00:24:46,943 --> 00:24:49,279
If I were actually interested,
I would've DMed him,

413
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:51,948
not cheer for him
in the bleachers like this!

414
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:53,700
Come on, guys. Don't fight.

415
00:24:53,783 --> 00:24:54,993
Did I say I doubted you?

416
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:58,038
But your supposed friend
wouldn't think of you just as a friend!

417
00:24:58,121 --> 00:24:59,497
You're as pretty as an angel,

418
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:02,000
so how could a guy
not fall in love with you?

419
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:05,170
Well, you are right about that.

420
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:07,839
But how can I leave now
when I got fried chicken?

421
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:10,133
-Come on. That's not right.
-I'm sorry--

422
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:13,470
You're so cute I can't stay mad at you.

423
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:17,349
My heart.

424
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:19,768
You're so adorable.

425
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:24,898
-Babe, have some fried chicken.
-Will do. Thanks.

426
00:25:26,274 --> 00:25:27,359
By the way, Soo-ho.

427
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:30,237
Why did you accompany Tae-hoon
when you two aren't even close?

428
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:32,989
We're close. Starting today.

429
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:34,574
Soo-ho.

430
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:38,119
I love drumsticks,
but I'll give this to you.

431
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:40,288
Congratulations.

432
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:55,553
-The real deal has arrived, go Sunil!
-The real deal has arrived, go Sunil!

433
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:17,367
What a jerk.

434
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:20,036
Hey Soo-ho,
why are you being mean to Limju?

435
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,329
Seriously.

436
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:24,916
-I'll go throw this out.
-Okay.

437
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,960
Isn't Hyeong-jin totally awesome?

438
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:29,421
He might make it
to the Major Leagues at this rate!

439
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:32,966
Hey, Hyeong-jin!

440
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:37,262
What?

441
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:38,847
Hyeong-jin!

442
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:48,565
Do you know how much I looked for you
after the last game?

443
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:51,026
You're a friend of Su-ah's?

444
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:54,279
Excuse me?

445
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:56,906
Up close,

446
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:58,992
you look even more stunning.

447
00:26:59,075 --> 00:26:59,909
Goodness.

448
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:04,539
I'm older than you
if you're Su-ah's friend, right?

449
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:09,127
What's this, Hyeong-jin?

450
00:27:10,253 --> 00:27:11,087
Give me your number.

451
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:13,006
My phone number?

452
00:27:13,089 --> 00:27:15,216
-Number!
-Number!

453
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,594
I need to get going. Hurry and type it in.

454
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:19,137
-Number!
-Number!

455
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:21,639
-Well…
-Number!

456
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:26,269
-Number!
-Number!

457
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:29,731
-Number!
-Number!

458
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:30,940
Here.

459
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:36,446
Saved. I'll hit you up.

460
00:27:40,867 --> 00:27:41,951
I can't believe this!

461
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:44,120
Hyeong-jin must have a crush on you!

462
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:47,207
Do you just give out
your number to strangers?

463
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:50,835
You think it's okay because she knows him?
What if he's a weirdo?

464
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:52,504
What?

465
00:27:54,422 --> 00:27:55,298
I'm leaving.

466
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,011
What's with him?

467
00:28:07,602 --> 00:28:08,978
I'll be frank with you.

468
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:11,022
I've fallen for you.

469
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:13,733
Even when buying a pair of shoes,

470
00:28:14,692 --> 00:28:16,027
I think hard about them

471
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:18,655
and spend time closely looking at them.

472
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:21,741
That way, I grow attached,
take better care of them,

473
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:24,869
and cherish them
even when they're worn out.

474
00:28:26,162 --> 00:28:29,040
Why don't you start thinking hard about me

475
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:31,835
and spend time closely looking at me?

476
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:34,462
But when I don't intend to buy a pair,

477
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:37,507
I avoid the shoe store completely.

478
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:40,552
I'm sure you're wonderful,

479
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:43,888
but I don't think I can be in
a relationship right now.

480
00:28:57,318 --> 00:29:00,530
You still don't want to
buy a new pair of shoes?

481
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:02,699
I can't afford to be in love right now.

482
00:29:02,782 --> 00:29:03,867
What are you doing?

483
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:06,661
Thinking about your girlfriend?

484
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:08,413
No, sir.

485
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:10,415
You totally are thinking about her!

486
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:12,584
-No, it's not--
-He said he wasn't!

487
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:15,086
-You're not, are you?
-Sure.

488
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:16,880
If not, we're good.

489
00:29:18,381 --> 00:29:19,466
What's with her?

490
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:25,263
Close your eyes

491
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:29,392
-Feel the wind
-It's her voice.

492
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:36,316
It's the caress of your mother's hand…

493
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:38,067
That's the girl from the festival?

494
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:39,527
She looks totally different.

495
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:41,404
She's on Lim Ju-bal's level.

496
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:49,788
That was brilliant. It was.

497
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:53,792
The right amount of vibrato
and head voice for the high notes.

498
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:55,293
What kind of crazy…

499
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:03,051
She's so shy.

500
00:30:15,104 --> 00:30:16,314
Why did you follow me here?

501
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:19,901
You like Ju-kyung, don't you?

502
00:30:20,401 --> 00:30:23,196
What, you thought I wouldn't know
when you made it so obvious?

503
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:26,157
I thought it was weird
that you'd follow me to the stadium.

504
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:27,617
But when eating fried chicken,

505
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:30,286
I saw you give Ju-kyung
all the drumsticks.

506
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:31,913
That's true love.

507
00:30:32,413 --> 00:30:35,375
And then I saw you being
super jealous of Ryu Hyeong-jin,

508
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:36,876
which made it clear that you…

509
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:40,213
I'm so smart. It's insane.

510
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:43,341
But then again,

511
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:44,801
why haven't you told her how you feel?

512
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:47,637
Someone like Ryu Hyeong-jin
will get her if you hesitate.

513
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:52,141
I mean, it hasn't happened yet.

514
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:01,818
Have fun on your date.

515
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:05,321
Hey, Su-ah! Choi Su…

516
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:08,324
-How…
-I wanted to walk you home.

517
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:10,159
-What?
-That's an excuse.

518
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:13,246
I wanted to see you again,
so I snuck out of my dorm.

519
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:15,331
You snuck out?

520
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:16,708
Is that allowed?

521
00:31:16,791 --> 00:31:18,167
Of course not.

522
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:20,628
I'll get kicked out if I get caught.

523
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:21,546
Goodness!

524
00:31:22,338 --> 00:31:24,173
Then you should go back, please.

525
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:25,091
Go…

526
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:27,719
That was a joke.

527
00:31:27,802 --> 00:31:29,804
They won't kick out their star player!

528
00:31:31,347 --> 00:31:32,181
You're right.

529
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,560
Three strikes.

530
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:39,439
I think you totally got me.

531
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:44,110
You were so harsh on her
when we were studying together.

532
00:31:44,193 --> 00:31:45,945
Being mean is not working for you.

533
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:48,781
I'd date Ryu Hyeong-jin
who's upfront and charming

534
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:50,033
if I were her.

535
00:31:50,116 --> 00:31:51,367
Come on, man.

536
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:52,577
Then what should I do?

537
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:55,997
What do we do with you?

538
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,999
What do I do
with this relationship virgin?

539
00:31:59,542 --> 00:32:01,753
Do you want me to teach you a secret?

540
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:05,506
Do you have a boyfriend?

541
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:07,717
I don't.

542
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:09,886
Really?

543
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:13,222
I don't have a girlfriend either.

544
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:15,558
If you think about it,

545
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:18,603
the odds of my crush
reciprocating my feelings

546
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:20,813
are almost as slim

547
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:23,232
as having a perfect game in baseball.

548
00:32:25,818 --> 00:32:29,614
"The odds of my crush
reciprocating my feelings"?

549
00:32:37,246 --> 00:32:38,164
Hey!

550
00:32:45,004 --> 00:32:45,880
That's huge.

551
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:47,590
Your will paid off, Yoo Tae-hoon.

552
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:50,760
Lee Soo-ho finally caved
at your tenacious attempts.

553
00:32:50,843 --> 00:32:52,637
-I'm not washing my hand today.
-Sure.

554
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:56,015
Your grades shouldn't determine
your happiness,

555
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:58,017
but good grades would make you happy.

556
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:01,479
Lee Soo-ho took first place
in the whole school.

557
00:33:01,562 --> 00:33:03,272
Congratulations. A round of applause!

558
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:05,900
MIDTERM EXAM
LIM JU-KYUNG

559
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:07,652
SUBJECT: LITERATURE
SCORE: 49

560
00:33:07,735 --> 00:33:09,445
-He's my friend!
-He got first place?

561
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:10,530
Here, Seo-jun.

562
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:11,739
I'm done for.

563
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:12,657
All right.

564
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:15,118
Let's give a round of applause
wishing him happiness.

565
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:18,705
Good luck!

566
00:33:19,914 --> 00:33:20,957
I got 50 in Literature.

567
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:23,543
I marked three for all my answers.
Awesome!

568
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:26,671
Hey Ju-kyung, what's your score?

569
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,506
Let me see. How is it?

570
00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:29,674
SCORE: 49

571
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:30,633
You got 49?

572
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:33,011
So that was all talk earlier.

573
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:34,345
Keep it up.

574
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:41,102
I should have marked
number three on everything.

575
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:43,229
Mom's going to kill me.

576
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:50,111
Su-jin, does that mean
you got second place again?

577
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:52,280
That's a shame.

578
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:58,036
TOTAL RANKING: 12, CLASS RANKING: 4

579
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:10,548
I see you marked wrong
starting from number 30.

580
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:13,843
Su-jin, what made you slip up
to make such a mistake?

581
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:16,054
Excuse me.

582
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:24,520
-What's wrong?
-I don't know. You're annoying.

583
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:31,444
Hey, it's Ryu Hyeong-jin!

584
00:34:32,361 --> 00:34:35,031
-What?
-What? Isn't that Ryu Hyeong-jin?

585
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:38,576
-Isn't that Ryu Hyeong-jin?
-Ryu Hyeong-jin?

586
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:40,078
He's a treat to look at.

587
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:41,496
He's so good-looking.

588
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:43,372
What class is Lim Ju-kyung in?

589
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:45,041
Lim Ju-kyung?

590
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:47,460
You still ranked 20 places higher.

591
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:49,629
It's not like it dropped,
so she won't get mad.

592
00:34:49,712 --> 00:34:50,671
-Right?
-Ju-kyung!

593
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:52,048
-Yes.
-Ju-kyung.

594
00:34:52,965 --> 00:34:54,759
-Ju-kyung!
-Hyeong-jin?

595
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:01,182
-It's Ryu Hyeong-jin!
-Look at him!

596
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:03,142
-What brought you here?
-To see you.

597
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:05,061
He said, "to see you."

598
00:35:05,144 --> 00:35:06,145
Take it.

599
00:35:06,854 --> 00:35:07,897
"Take it," my foot.

600
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:10,399
Hey, speak up.
I think he wants to fight you--

601
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:14,320
This is my lucky ball,
so I can't pitch without it.

602
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:16,781
Then you shouldn't give me--

603
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:19,867
I'm asking you to come to the final.

604
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:22,370
If I win the game,

605
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:24,872
I have something to say to you officially.

606
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:28,000
Can't you just say it here?

607
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:29,085
No way.

608
00:35:29,168 --> 00:35:31,170
Who would ever ask someone out so lazily?

609
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:34,173
Gosh, he just said he'd ask her out!

610
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:38,928
Lim Ju-kyung, you're quite popular.

611
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:43,266
Until recently, there were rumors
that you were dating me.

612
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:45,017
You can't move on so quickly.

613
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:46,144
What?

614
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:47,979
You're being insensitive to your ex.

615
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:52,108
What are you brats doing?

616
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:53,151
Who are you?

617
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:55,278
Come see me play…

618
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:56,654
-Beautiful.
-Hey, you!

619
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:00,992
-Hyeong-jin!
-Hyeong-jin!

620
00:36:05,037 --> 00:36:06,330
Where are you going?

621
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:19,552
Hey Soo-ho, do you remember me?

622
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:24,348
We were in the same class last year.
We did group projects together as well.

623
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:29,437
Actually, I've had a crush on you
since last year.

624
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:32,899
If you're not seeing anyone, would you--

625
00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:33,816
No.

626
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,693
I like someone else.

627
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:45,453
He likes someone else?

628
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:56,839
He likes someone?

629
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:06,432
Make sure you come, beautiful!

630
00:37:12,939 --> 00:37:15,274
Soon, there'll be spring rain.

631
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:18,527
So I got myself
a pretty pair of rain boots.

632
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:20,529
-How do they look? Pretty?
-Yes.

633
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:23,282
-Do they look good on me?
-Yes.

634
00:37:25,868 --> 00:37:28,162
Your mom's really mad.

635
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:31,666
She threw out all your makeup.

636
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,251
What?

637
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:36,212
Focus, everyone!

638
00:37:36,295 --> 00:37:38,547
One, two, three!

639
00:37:42,885 --> 00:37:43,803
How long will you…

640
00:37:43,886 --> 00:37:45,304
Here are the apples.

641
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,411
-Mom!
-When did you get home?

642
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:09,787
Where's all my makeup?

643
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:13,624
I threw them out. Why would you ask?

644
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:14,834
What?

645
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:17,336
I called your teacher
and heard everything.

646
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,963
You didn't score 30 places higher.

647
00:38:19,046 --> 00:38:21,257
But my grades went up, though!

648
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:23,634
They didn't go down.
Can you cut me a little slack?

649
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:26,053
Yes, she scored 20 places
higher than the last time.

650
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:28,764
You won't be able to go to a college
in a metropolitan area

651
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:31,225
even if you score 50 places higher.

652
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:32,977
Did I say to rank 30th in the school?

653
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,478
If you had truly tried,

654
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:37,106
it wouldn't have been so hard
to score 30 places higher.

655
00:38:37,189 --> 00:38:38,024
Right.

656
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:40,026
Your grades were pretty low to begin with.

657
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:42,194
But still, I tried really hard.

658
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:43,988
Where is my makeup?

659
00:38:44,071 --> 00:38:46,115
You didn't actually throw it all out,
did you?

660
00:38:46,198 --> 00:38:48,534
-Did you hide it?
-I really threw it out!

661
00:38:48,617 --> 00:38:52,038
Don't you ever go around
with makeup on your face again.

662
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:54,582
I'll throw you away, not just the makeup.

663
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:55,499
What?

664
00:38:57,626 --> 00:38:58,878
You really threw it away?

665
00:38:59,545 --> 00:39:01,964
Mom! You know how much it meant to me.

666
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:03,758
Yet you threw it away without a word?

667
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:06,344
-That was mine, not yours!
-You didn't do as promised!

668
00:39:06,427 --> 00:39:08,596
I can't do it even if I try hard!

669
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:10,097
Is it my fault that I'm stupid?

670
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:11,849
What do you mean, you can't do it?

671
00:39:11,932 --> 00:39:13,976
You didn't try harder than others,
that's why!

672
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:16,020
I really tried my best this time!

673
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,147
How come you don't believe me?

674
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:20,358
You never believe what I say.

675
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:24,737
This is the reason why
I don't tell you things.

676
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:28,282
You're talking back and crying
for throwing away some makeup?

677
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:29,825
Okay.

678
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:31,619
What did you not tell me?

679
00:39:32,244 --> 00:39:33,454
What did you not tell me?

680
00:39:35,581 --> 00:39:38,167
Do you know why
I care so much about makeup?

681
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:40,711
Do you even know how I feel?

682
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:42,671
You…

683
00:39:42,755 --> 00:39:44,340
don't know a thing about me.

684
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,010
How things were for me…

685
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:50,846
at my last school.

686
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:02,316
Where do you think
you're going at this hour?

687
00:40:02,858 --> 00:40:06,195
Go! Leave and never come back, you brat!

688
00:40:06,278 --> 00:40:07,738
Honey, calm down.

689
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:18,207
Soo-ho, you need to make
the other person's heart flutter.

690
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:21,168
Like butterflies in the stomach. Get it?

691
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:22,962
First, go to her place.

692
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:24,255
Then call her. She answers?

693
00:40:24,338 --> 00:40:26,132
Tell her you miss her. Straight up!

694
00:40:26,215 --> 00:40:27,258
With a deep breath,

695
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:29,635
filled with longing…

696
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:33,639
Then she'll say,
"Where are you right now?"

697
00:40:33,722 --> 00:40:35,015
That's your cue.

698
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:35,933
"Open your window."

699
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:40,146
Gaze at her longingly.

700
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:41,814
That's the key. Write it down.

701
00:40:41,897 --> 00:40:44,525
When she comes out running,
hug her and grab the wall.

702
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:46,944
-When you grab the wall…
-Must I?

703
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:49,029
Against the wall?

704
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:50,823
Do you not watch dramas?

705
00:40:50,906 --> 00:40:52,700
You look like you could star in one.

706
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:54,034
What do I do with you?

707
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:57,872
Have you ever kissed…

708
00:40:58,414 --> 00:40:59,415
Jeez.

709
00:40:59,498 --> 00:41:01,000
Hey, what's after the wall?

710
00:41:01,083 --> 00:41:03,377
-Forget about the wall.
-Hey.

711
00:41:33,365 --> 00:41:34,200
Ju-kyung.

712
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:49,256
You didn't have dinner?

713
00:41:52,134 --> 00:41:53,219
What's that?

714
00:41:56,805 --> 00:41:59,099
My mom really threw all my makeup away.

715
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:01,018
Just because my grades
didn't go up 30 places.

716
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:03,354
Really gave me no slack.

717
00:42:06,815 --> 00:42:07,691
So you cried?

718
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:09,652
No.

719
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:14,782
Right. You saw me.

720
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:17,785
Well…

721
00:42:19,286 --> 00:42:20,579
I was just frustrated.

722
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:33,467
She doesn't even know
why I care so much about makeup.

723
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:35,553
She could've at least made me smart.

724
00:42:37,304 --> 00:42:38,180
Good job.

725
00:42:43,477 --> 00:42:44,478
You did well.

726
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:47,523
I know you tried hard.

727
00:42:47,606 --> 00:42:48,899
You scored 20 places higher.

728
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:51,068
I'm proud of you.

729
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:55,656
Are you crying again?

730
00:42:58,576 --> 00:42:59,785
I'm not…

731
00:42:59,868 --> 00:43:01,161
Are you making fun of me?

732
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:04,498
It doesn't feel sincere at all
coming from the top student.

733
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:08,085
Is there anything I can do?

734
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:09,920
Should I get you

735
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:11,880
a whole new set of makeup?

736
00:43:12,631 --> 00:43:14,174
Why are you being so sweet today?

737
00:43:16,135 --> 00:43:18,804
You're always so cool and brisk,

738
00:43:18,887 --> 00:43:20,347
so I don't know what's gotten into you.

739
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:22,766
Don't girls like guys cool and brisk?

740
00:43:23,642 --> 00:43:24,476
What?

741
00:43:25,728 --> 00:43:26,770
What about you?

742
00:43:35,821 --> 00:43:38,699
Where is she scampering about
at this late hour?

743
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:41,285
I called Prince Comics.

744
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:43,078
She's there.

745
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:45,539
She is?

746
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:48,792
That place, really.

747
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:51,003
By the way,

748
00:43:51,712 --> 00:43:53,756
what could she possibly have not told me?

749
00:43:54,673 --> 00:43:56,300
Could she have gotten into trouble?

750
00:43:56,383 --> 00:43:58,802
Ju-kyung couldn't have done anything bad.

751
00:44:01,013 --> 00:44:03,432
Kids might have picked on her
for her looks at school,

752
00:44:03,515 --> 00:44:04,767
but that's probably not it.

753
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:06,435
What do you mean by her looks?

754
00:44:06,518 --> 00:44:07,645
She looks very nice.

755
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:08,979
Of course, she does.

756
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:09,980
She takes after you.

757
00:44:13,984 --> 00:44:15,361
That makes me feel oddly bad.

758
00:44:30,959 --> 00:44:31,794
What?

759
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:33,337
I…

760
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:36,799
I think I stepped on something weird.

761
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:38,842
Is it a worm?

762
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:40,928
It's nothing. Just a twig.

763
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:42,763
No.

764
00:44:43,972 --> 00:44:45,349
It's definitely a worm.

765
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:47,434
No. It's a twig.

766
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:52,815
It is a worm.

767
00:44:52,898 --> 00:44:54,191
I hate worms.

768
00:44:54,274 --> 00:44:55,150
How do I…

769
00:44:58,779 --> 00:45:01,115
Hold still. I'll get it off for you.

770
00:45:13,585 --> 00:45:15,379
You could fall down. Sit.

771
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:18,882
Can I, really?

772
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:31,770
I meant over there.

773
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:34,064
What?

774
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:37,609
Nothing.

775
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:39,903
Here, all done.

776
00:45:40,821 --> 00:45:42,906
Okay. Thanks.

777
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:49,872
Get home safe.

778
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:52,833
Wait.

779
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:20,360
So you study hard.

780
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,156
Good night.

781
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:53,852
-You're home so late!
-You're home?

782
00:46:53,936 --> 00:46:55,562
Don't we need to have a talk first?

783
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:57,189
Lim Ju-kyung!

784
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:21,213
What do I do?

785
00:47:24,841 --> 00:47:26,718
It feels like my heart is going to burst.

786
00:47:47,739 --> 00:47:49,992
Do you want to go on a date with me?

787
00:47:50,909 --> 00:47:51,743
Want to go on a date?

788
00:47:51,827 --> 00:47:52,786
Go out for a date?

789
00:47:52,869 --> 00:47:53,787
Do you want to

790
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:54,871
catch a movie with me?

791
00:47:54,955 --> 00:47:55,789
Let's go see a movie.

792
00:47:55,872 --> 00:47:56,707
Want to grab dinner?

793
00:47:56,790 --> 00:47:57,791
Let's have a meal together.

794
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:03,422
Didn't you know your dad
was just waiting to scold you?

795
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:08,051
Not beating Soo-ho's one thing,
but 12th place?

796
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:10,345
You've never fallen below 10th place.

797
00:48:13,348 --> 00:48:15,392
Are you dating someone?

798
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:18,103
It's just…

799
00:48:18,186 --> 00:48:19,688
we can't let you get distracted--

800
00:48:19,771 --> 00:48:21,732
Mom, not you too!

801
00:48:23,275 --> 00:48:24,735
Su-jin!

802
00:48:27,279 --> 00:48:29,781
Still, how could he slap her face?

TOP 8 RESTAURANTS THAT WOMEN LIKE
ON SAEBOM STREET

805
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,435
PLANNING A DATE ALWAYS
GIVES YOU BUTTERFLIES…

806
00:49:26,505 --> 00:49:28,715
-Why are you following me?
-What's going on?

807
00:49:31,009 --> 00:49:31,927
What do you mean?

808
00:49:33,261 --> 00:49:34,513
Did you get slapped?

809
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:37,432
Your dad's doing this again?

810
00:49:39,518 --> 00:49:40,644
You knew all along?

811
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:42,938
How could I not?

812
00:49:47,067 --> 00:49:48,652
You're really annoying.

813
00:49:48,735 --> 00:49:50,362
I can't keep doing this,

814
00:49:51,279 --> 00:49:53,740
one-sidedly trying to do better than you.

815
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:55,617
It's all so frustrating!

816
00:49:56,368 --> 00:49:58,954
I'm over constantly being compared to you.

817
00:50:01,081 --> 00:50:02,582
I can't keep this up anymore.

818
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:05,168
Why are you at my school?

819
00:50:05,752 --> 00:50:07,337
Transfer somewhere else!

820
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:04,936
I like someone else.

821
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:43,600
Hey.

822
00:51:44,434 --> 00:51:46,770
Forget what I said.

823
00:51:46,853 --> 00:51:47,771
I mean it, okay?

824
00:51:50,232 --> 00:51:52,234
-Does he do that often?
-No.

825
00:51:52,317 --> 00:51:54,236
If he did, I'd have reported him long ago.

826
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:57,239
Don't keep it all to yourself.
Tell me if you need help.

827
00:52:00,283 --> 00:52:02,869
I guess you think of me as a friend?

828
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:04,037
Of course, you're a friend.

829
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:08,917
Anyway, are my eyes super red?
Does it look like I cried?

830
00:52:13,171 --> 00:52:15,423
-A little.
-Then let me borrow this.

831
00:52:36,862 --> 00:52:38,864
Okay, let's begin today's class.

832
00:52:38,947 --> 00:52:40,156
-Okay.
-Okay.

833
00:52:40,866 --> 00:52:44,786
First, we'll review the nationwide exam
conducted in September.

834
00:52:45,871 --> 00:52:48,832
We're only going to go over
the important questions,

835
00:52:48,915 --> 00:52:51,960
so please solve the problems
on the sheet I gave you.

836
00:52:52,043 --> 00:52:53,712
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

837
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:02,721
We learned about derivatives today,
so make sure to review them.

838
00:53:02,804 --> 00:53:04,848
Next time, we'll move on
to their application.

839
00:53:04,931 --> 00:53:05,932
See you next time.

840
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:08,518
-Okay, thank you.
-Thank you.

841
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:14,941
Your eyes look fine now.

842
00:53:17,152 --> 00:53:19,362
I thought we were friends.
You're so heartless.

843
00:53:23,533 --> 00:53:24,701
She already left.

844
00:53:25,577 --> 00:53:28,038
Hey, let me have this.

845
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:32,834
Bye.

846
00:53:47,182 --> 00:53:48,058
Right.

847
00:53:48,975 --> 00:53:50,644
It wasn't as if I had deep feelings.

848
00:53:51,728 --> 00:53:53,897
Who wouldn't get butterflies
seeing that face?

849
00:53:56,816 --> 00:53:59,361
It was more of a fan's adoration.

850
00:53:59,444 --> 00:54:01,071
You get upset when you hear a rumor

851
00:54:01,154 --> 00:54:03,406
that your favorite celebrity
is in a relationship.

852
00:54:04,157 --> 00:54:06,785
You can always stop being a fan
when you get tired of them.

853
00:54:32,352 --> 00:54:35,146
He should have told me
if he liked someone.

854
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:36,606
I got confused for no reason.

855
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:39,025
Why give me the hair clip
or have me sit on his shoulders?

856
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:41,277
What a scumbag.

857
00:54:41,361 --> 00:54:42,237
Lee Soo-ho,

858
00:54:42,737 --> 00:54:45,115
I will crush you!

859
00:54:45,991 --> 00:54:47,575
Hey, Lim Ju-bal.

860
00:54:47,659 --> 00:54:49,411
Lee Soo-ho, seriously!

861
00:54:51,955 --> 00:54:53,707
Lee Soo-ho, I'll be watching you!

862
00:55:03,258 --> 00:55:05,552
Ms. Lim, did you have
a pleasant business trip?

863
00:55:05,635 --> 00:55:07,637
I did, thank you.

864
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:12,684
What's this?

865
00:55:14,602 --> 00:55:16,271
THANK YOU

866
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:21,818
Thank you.

867
00:55:24,029 --> 00:55:25,905
Seriously, this guy.

868
00:55:45,216 --> 00:55:47,594
LIM HEE-KYUNG

869
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:52,891
Hello?

870
00:55:52,974 --> 00:55:54,017
What are you doing?

871
00:55:55,143 --> 00:55:56,770
I was sleeping.

872
00:55:57,353 --> 00:55:58,521
Did I wake you?

873
00:56:01,066 --> 00:56:03,026
How was your business trip?

874
00:56:03,109 --> 00:56:04,486
You were waiting for me?

875
00:56:05,862 --> 00:56:07,072
I guess not.

876
00:56:09,741 --> 00:56:10,784
I miss your face.

877
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:12,994
Are you still outside?

878
00:56:13,078 --> 00:56:14,579
Can you open your window?

879
00:56:28,426 --> 00:56:30,470
You're not going to let me see your face?

880
00:56:31,471 --> 00:56:33,515
Even a longing look doesn't work on you.

881
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:49,697
How did you…

882
00:56:52,117 --> 00:56:53,618
Why did you send the flowers back?

883
00:56:56,329 --> 00:56:57,664
Not to think about me?

884
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:01,501
Are you not going to see me anymore?

885
00:57:04,254 --> 00:57:05,880
Should we not see each other?

886
00:57:10,802 --> 00:57:11,845
I don't want that!

887
00:57:29,154 --> 00:57:32,615
RESERVED FOR LIM JU-KYUNG.
SIT HERE AND YOU'LL GROW BUTT HAIR.

888
00:57:35,618 --> 00:57:37,787
Want to come to Prince Comics?

889
00:57:39,247 --> 00:57:40,540
Is something wrong?

890
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:44,252
Why are there so many?

891
00:57:51,050 --> 00:57:52,260
Are you a ghost?

892
00:57:52,343 --> 00:57:54,262
I'm not in the mood for jokes.

893
00:57:54,345 --> 00:57:55,305
Are you ill?

894
00:57:56,014 --> 00:57:57,307
You should have told me.

895
00:57:57,390 --> 00:57:58,641
I'm not sick.

896
00:57:59,434 --> 00:58:02,479
Of course, I should help you choose
Go-un's birthday present.

897
00:58:03,062 --> 00:58:05,482
-Did you get dumped by Ryu Hyeong-jin?
-No.

898
00:58:05,565 --> 00:58:06,649
That's what it is!

899
00:58:06,733 --> 00:58:07,942
I said it's not.

900
00:58:08,026 --> 00:58:11,070
He even sent me a ticket
asking me to come watch him.

901
00:58:11,946 --> 00:58:12,780
Really?

902
00:58:12,864 --> 00:58:15,033
You have the face
of someone who got dumped.

903
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:17,327
Let's go.

904
00:58:19,579 --> 00:58:21,915
I just didn't get enough sleep.

905
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:24,292
He's good.

906
00:58:33,593 --> 00:58:34,636
Hello?

907
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:37,013
Are you home?

908
00:58:37,805 --> 00:58:40,058
No, I'm at the mall.

909
00:58:40,141 --> 00:58:40,975
What's up?

910
00:58:42,810 --> 00:58:44,187
Did you go by yourself?

911
00:58:44,270 --> 00:58:45,230
Ju-kyung.

912
00:58:46,731 --> 00:58:47,774
Hurry up.

913
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:49,651
Are you with Seo-jun?

914
00:58:51,653 --> 00:58:52,487
Well…

915
00:58:52,570 --> 00:58:55,365
It's busy here. I'll call you later.

916
00:59:07,502 --> 00:59:10,171
The scent of makeup lifts my mood.

917
00:59:11,005 --> 00:59:12,215
You're getting her makeup?

918
00:59:12,298 --> 00:59:14,717
Yes, she has a recital coming up
at her academy.

919
00:59:14,801 --> 00:59:16,970
She was practicing stage makeup
pretty intently.

920
00:59:17,053 --> 00:59:19,347
-I hear she's attending a musical academy.
-She is.

921
00:59:19,430 --> 00:59:21,641
How are you both so good at singing?

922
00:59:23,017 --> 00:59:24,561
You've never heard me sing before.

923
00:59:25,061 --> 00:59:26,354
I heard you were a trainee.

924
00:59:26,437 --> 00:59:27,981
They say you are amazing.

925
00:59:28,898 --> 00:59:30,400
Why have you stopped training?

926
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:36,239
What's so great about being a celebrity?
Just help me pick a gift.

927
00:59:38,741 --> 00:59:39,993
For stage makeup,

928
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:41,911
a super-pigmented eye shadow

929
00:59:41,995 --> 00:59:44,789
or a smudge-free lip stain would be nice.

930
00:59:45,999 --> 00:59:48,876
These are the new lip tints.
I wonder if they're long-lasting.

931
00:59:55,133 --> 00:59:57,343
I put it over my lipstick,
so it's hard to say.

932
00:59:57,427 --> 00:59:58,428
Can you try it?

933
00:59:58,511 --> 00:59:59,345
No.

934
00:59:59,846 --> 01:00:02,557
-You used it on your lips.
-It's just a tester. Come on.

935
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:04,517
-No.
-Come on.

936
01:00:12,066 --> 01:00:13,443
It has decent pigmentation.

937
01:00:15,486 --> 01:00:16,446
Want to get this one?

938
01:00:18,781 --> 01:00:20,533
-Hey, Seo-jun.
-Yes?

939
01:00:20,617 --> 01:00:21,743
This one?

940
01:00:22,702 --> 01:00:24,078
Right.

941
01:00:24,162 --> 01:00:25,622
I'll get her this.

942
01:00:29,751 --> 01:00:31,210
The checkout is that way, right?

943
01:00:39,385 --> 01:00:40,219
Her?

944
01:00:40,303 --> 01:00:41,137
It's cold.

945
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:42,138
Me?

946
01:00:43,222 --> 01:00:44,140
Surely not.

947
01:00:45,850 --> 01:00:47,602
The door is opening.

948
01:00:50,063 --> 01:00:51,397
YANGKWANG UNIVERSITY
SSIREUM TEAM

949
01:00:59,238 --> 01:01:00,823
Hey, back up.

950
01:01:00,907 --> 01:01:02,492
-You'll get makeup on you.
-Okay.

951
01:01:04,118 --> 01:01:05,161
We are at maximum capacity.

952
01:01:05,244 --> 01:01:07,246
-I told you to lose some weight.
-I'm sorry.

953
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:09,165
Hey, hold your breath. Two, Three.

954
01:01:12,418 --> 01:01:14,253
We are at maximum capacity.

955
01:01:14,921 --> 01:01:16,506
I told you to go easy at lunch.

956
01:01:16,589 --> 01:01:19,342
We can take the next one. Let's get off.

957
01:01:20,176 --> 01:01:22,470
-But lunch was so good.
-This is embarrassing.

958
01:01:37,735 --> 01:01:39,529
-How did you…
-Let's go.

959
01:01:42,073 --> 01:01:44,659
Where are you going?
This isn't even the first floor.

960
01:01:48,746 --> 01:01:49,622
Excuse me…

961
01:01:55,294 --> 01:01:56,212
I said, let's go.

962
01:01:59,757 --> 01:02:00,800
What a nuisance.

963
01:02:20,987 --> 01:02:21,988
What is it?

964
01:02:23,698 --> 01:02:26,409
Look, I think the elevator
stopped working!

965
01:02:33,166 --> 01:02:35,251
UNDER MAINTENANCE

966
01:02:38,921 --> 01:02:39,964
Why don't you let go?

967
01:02:40,923 --> 01:02:41,883
If you let go first.

968
01:02:43,968 --> 01:02:45,928
-Why are you here?
-To go shopping.

969
01:02:46,012 --> 01:02:47,889
You? Shopping?

970
01:02:47,972 --> 01:02:49,098
I can't shop?

971
01:02:49,182 --> 01:02:51,142
Go shopping if you're here for that.

972
01:02:51,809 --> 01:02:52,894
Why hold onto her?

973
01:02:52,977 --> 01:02:54,020
She's going to join me.

974
01:02:55,438 --> 01:02:56,439
Let go.

975
01:02:57,607 --> 01:02:58,900
Let go of me.

976
01:02:58,983 --> 01:03:00,943
This damned shopping!

977
01:03:04,655 --> 01:03:06,032
What's wrong? Are you okay?

978
01:03:06,699 --> 01:03:09,202
Is it because you're scared?
They'll get us out soon.

979
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:12,371
-Wait for a bit.
-No.

980
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:13,956
I can't.

981
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:17,835
I can't hold it anymore!

982
01:03:17,919 --> 01:03:20,046
Why did you have to get me a large coffee?

983
01:03:20,129 --> 01:03:24,050
And you probably broke the elevator
playing with the buttons!

984
01:03:25,343 --> 01:03:28,095
-What do I do?
-Excuse me!

985
01:03:28,179 --> 01:03:29,806
When can you open the door?

986
01:03:34,268 --> 01:03:35,311
Are you insane?

987
01:03:38,523 --> 01:03:41,150
-Come on, hurry, please.
-Okay.

988
01:03:43,611 --> 01:03:45,571
-Are you okay?
-We'll get it opened soon.

989
01:03:45,655 --> 01:03:47,657
Please don't move.

990
01:04:03,506 --> 01:04:05,508
How can I face Soo-ho again after this?

991
01:04:05,591 --> 01:04:07,969
I should just die.

992
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:16,102
They didn't say it was going to snow.

993
01:04:38,249 --> 01:04:40,209
Hello, beautiful.

994
01:04:40,793 --> 01:04:42,587
-How…
-My goodness.

995
01:04:43,504 --> 01:04:45,006
It's destiny!

996
01:04:48,426 --> 01:04:52,889
Some may not be aware of
what their heart's desire is,

997
01:04:54,223 --> 01:04:56,684
and some may hesitate,
though they know what they want.

998
01:04:58,394 --> 01:05:02,648
As opportunity presents itself randomly
like a sudden storm in summer,

999
01:05:03,691 --> 01:05:05,526
only the prepared can seize it.

1000
01:05:25,463 --> 01:05:26,964
-I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry.

1001
01:05:28,966 --> 01:05:31,719
Hey there, friend.
It's good to see you here.

1002
01:05:32,845 --> 01:05:33,763
Why are you here?

1003
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:37,099
Obviously to watch baseball.
Why else would I be here?

1004
01:05:37,183 --> 01:05:40,061
-I thought you didn't like baseball.
-I grew to like it.

1005
01:05:40,144 --> 01:05:41,938
-Since when?
-Since lately.

1006
01:05:42,021 --> 01:05:44,357
Really? High school baseball at that?

1007
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:46,108
It's not like
only professional games count.

1008
01:05:46,192 --> 01:05:48,027
Don't look down on high school baseball.

1009
01:05:54,033 --> 01:05:55,242
Looks like it will be fun.

1010
01:05:56,118 --> 01:05:57,119
Enjoy the game.

1011
01:05:57,870 --> 01:05:59,413
Ryu Hyeong-jin enters the stadium.

1012
01:05:59,497 --> 01:06:02,124
Goodness, he has an intense look.

1013
01:06:02,208 --> 01:06:05,920
His presence alone sets
a different mood over the stadium.

1014
01:06:06,003 --> 01:06:09,048
Fortunately, he seems to be
in good shape today.

1015
01:06:09,131 --> 01:06:11,926
The highlight of the game today
is Sunil's Monster Pitcher…

1016
01:06:12,009 --> 01:06:13,302
Have you seen Ju-kyung?

1017
01:06:13,386 --> 01:06:14,929
She went out earlier.

1018
01:06:15,846 --> 01:06:18,432
She should be studying
at home on a weekend.

1019
01:06:18,516 --> 01:06:20,643
It doesn't matter
how many times I scold her.

1020
01:06:30,444 --> 01:06:33,114
-Ryu Hyeong-jin!
-Ryu Hyeong-jin!

1021
01:06:33,781 --> 01:06:35,324
-Ryu Hyeong-jin!
-Ryu Hyeong-jin!

1022
01:06:36,575 --> 01:06:37,994
Strike!

1023
01:06:38,077 --> 01:06:41,622
I hear recruiters from the Major Leagues
are here to see Ryu Hyeong-jin.

1024
01:06:41,706 --> 01:06:42,665
That's amazing.

1025
01:06:42,748 --> 01:06:45,835
Will he be going to the US
if he does well in today's game?

1026
01:06:45,918 --> 01:06:47,086
Without a doubt.

1027
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:49,839
-Monster pitcher, Ryu Hyeong-jin!
-Monster pitcher, Ryu Hyeong-jin!

1028
01:06:49,922 --> 01:06:55,052
-Monster pitcher, Ryu Hyeong-jin!
-Monster pitcher, Ryu Hyeong-jin!

1029
01:06:55,136 --> 01:06:57,179
-Monster pitcher, Ryu Hyeong-jin!
-Monster pitcher, Ryu Hyeong-jin!

1030
01:07:00,099 --> 01:07:02,643
To maintain the best fastball,

1031
01:07:02,727 --> 01:07:05,146
it's said that you must keep
the balance of your body…

1032
01:07:05,229 --> 01:07:07,857
-Where have you been?
-I went to buy a selfie stick.

1033
01:07:07,940 --> 01:07:11,694
Already thinking like a professional.
Isn't he impressive?

1034
01:07:11,777 --> 01:07:14,280
People say it is impossible
to beat a diligent genius…

1035
01:07:14,363 --> 01:07:16,615
Gosh, he's already a big shot.

1036
01:07:17,366 --> 01:07:19,118
Every team would want him.

1037
01:07:21,162 --> 01:07:23,539
What kind of baseball player
is that handsome?

1038
01:07:26,625 --> 01:07:28,878
That guy asked me out.

1039
01:07:30,004 --> 01:07:31,714
Hey, why would he do that?

1040
01:07:31,797 --> 01:07:33,966
I'm serious. I even rejected him.

1041
01:07:34,884 --> 01:07:36,635
Unbelievable.

1042
01:07:43,642 --> 01:07:47,021
I'll send you the baseball
through a courier.

1043
01:07:48,105 --> 01:07:49,065
I'm sorry.

1044
01:07:49,148 --> 01:07:50,566
What do you mean?

1045
01:07:51,650 --> 01:07:53,819
I like someone else.

1046
01:07:59,950 --> 01:08:01,535
Does that person like you back?

1047
01:08:08,292 --> 01:08:11,629
You said the odds of that happening
are as slim as that of a perfect game.

1048
01:08:21,764 --> 01:08:24,934
Ryu Hyeong-jin's perfect finish!

1049
01:08:25,017 --> 01:08:29,063
He never fails to disappoint.

1050
01:08:29,146 --> 01:08:32,024
With Ryu Hyeong-jin's
wonderful performance,

1051
01:08:32,775 --> 01:08:35,194
Sunil High wins
the High School Baseball Final!

1052
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:40,866
-Monster pitcher, Ryu Hyeong-jin!
-Monster pitcher, Ryu Hyeong-jin!

1053
01:08:40,950 --> 01:08:44,286
-Monster pitcher, Ryu Hyeong-jin!
-Monster pitcher, Ryu Hyeong-jin!

1054
01:08:44,370 --> 01:08:50,459
-Monster pitcher, Ryu Hyeong-jin!
-Monster pitcher, Ryu Hyeong-jin!

1055
01:08:52,336 --> 01:08:53,379
Did you have fun?

1056
01:08:55,965 --> 01:08:56,882
It was fun.

1057
01:08:56,966 --> 01:08:59,176
Really? It wasn't fun for me.

1058
01:08:59,885 --> 01:09:01,846
I came in case Ju-kyung would come.

1059
01:09:02,513 --> 01:09:03,639
I was worried.

1060
01:09:05,057 --> 01:09:06,475
That's why I came,

1061
01:09:07,685 --> 01:09:09,395
but you came here to watch the game.

1062
01:09:10,729 --> 01:09:11,981
Right?

1063
01:09:13,107 --> 01:09:14,942
Yes, that's what I said.

1064
01:09:18,028 --> 01:09:19,113
Why ask me twice?

1065
01:09:19,947 --> 01:09:20,823
Bye.

1066
01:09:24,118 --> 01:09:26,662
Why does it have to be Lim Ju-kyung,
you idiot?

1067
01:09:29,957 --> 01:09:31,000
Hey, Soo-ho!

1068
01:09:40,259 --> 01:09:41,135
You're right.

1069
01:09:41,844 --> 01:09:44,430
I'm here for Lim Ju-kyung
and not for the game.

1070
01:09:48,809 --> 01:09:50,603
Is there a reason why I shouldn't?

1071
01:10:15,044 --> 01:10:17,838
THANK YOU TO JUNG GUN-JOO
FOR HIS SPECIAL APPEARANCE

1072
01:10:44,323 --> 01:10:46,325
You two have matching outfits.

1073
01:10:46,408 --> 01:10:48,994
Are you going to surprise us
with news that you're dating?

1074
01:10:49,078 --> 01:10:52,289
-Date!
-Date!

1075
01:10:52,373 --> 01:10:53,999
There's someone you like.

1076
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:56,335
Why were you avoiding me today?

1077
01:10:56,418 --> 01:10:58,462
No, I wasn't avoiding you.

1078
01:11:02,549 --> 01:11:04,176
Why does it have to be Lim Ju-kyung?

1079
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:05,261
I have no idea!

1080
01:11:05,344 --> 01:11:06,929
Why it has to be her.

1081
01:11:08,430 --> 01:11:09,974
Why are you crying over him?

1082
01:11:10,933 --> 01:11:12,476
Is it because you like him?

1083
01:11:13,936 --> 01:11:18,941
