 Episode 8 

5
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:06,390
 Excuse me. 

6
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:18,210
 - Thank you. 
 - It's nothing. 

7
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:27,590
 My lady! Where have you been all by yourself? 

8
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:31,110
 I've been looking for you. Let's go. 

9
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:38,900
  Young master! Young master. 

10
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,460
 Do you know that lady's name by chance? 

11
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:46,250
 Looking at that handmaid, she looks like Lord Im's daughter. 

12
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:48,770
 Lord Im's daughter... 

13
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:52,650
 Her hands are soft like silk. 

14
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:55,060
 How beautiful her face must be... 

15
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,110
 I should write a love letter. 

16
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:01,170
 A l-love letter? 

17
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:15,550
Welcome.

18
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:19,080
From here to here, show me all of them.

19
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,890
All of them?

20
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,500
Yes, all of them.

21
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,770
- Is it for a birthday present?
 - No.

22
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:28,550
I'm going to confess right now.

23
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:34,850
A confession. 
 It's reasonable to confess. 

24
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:43,070
So they are friends who like the same girl?

25
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:46,950
Right. But that guy liked her first.

26
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:50,510
He said "This girl is mine. Don't bother her."

27
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:53,210
Heol! Then why is he fussing like that now?

28
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:55,240
I thought he got close for revenge at the beginning.

29
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:59,320
He's getting clingy stating that he suddenly fell in love.

30
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,490
That bastard.

31
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:04,580
It's not a sin to have fallen in love!

32
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:07,240
 Not a Sin to Fall in Love 

33
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:11,990
What are you saying? Just take your boxers and go to your room.

34
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:21,860
This one and this one.

35
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:26,910
Enough with buying make up.

36
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:32,700
What are you going to do? Your bare face will be instantly revealed on the field trip.

37
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,710
I'm going to bed the latest.

38
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:38,540
When they all fall asleep, I'll wash up then put on make up perfectly again.

39
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:42,210
What a tearjerking struggle to hide your bare face.

40
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:45,880
By the way, why were you like that last time? Did Su Ho dump you?

41
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,050
What are you talking about? Who dumped whom?

42
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:51,690
I thought you liked Su Ho.

43
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,650
We're just friends.

44
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,650
Yeah? Okay.

45
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:59,050
My girl friends, after getting along with me, always confessed to me.

46
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:02,630
Telling me that they developed feelings for me or something.

47
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:06,080
Don't lose friends and love.

48
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,430
I could've taken the bus.

49
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:22,880
But the bags are heavy.

50
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,660
Thanks, Unni.

51
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,140
- I said thank you. 
 - Oh, okay.

52
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:29,220
- I'll be going then. 
 - Bye.

53
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:32,400
- Listen to your teacher!
 - Okay.

54
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:39,400
Jun Woo.

55
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,430
Jun Woo.

56
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,680
 What is this? 

57
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,910
 I have some debt. 

58
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:53,730
 A debt? How much? 

59
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:56,610
 Did you get a private loan? 

60
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:59,740
 - A student loan. 
- A student loan? 

61
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:03,210
 H-how old are you? 

62
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:05,590
 I was born in 1990, early in 1990. 

63
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:07,410
 1990? 

64
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:19,530
 This is what I've saved up until now. 

65
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:29,540
 You must be disappointed. 

66
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:33,310
 That's why I never wanted to date someone. 

67
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:37,390
 All your blood, sweat, and tears from trying to save up money are in here. 

68
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:40,160
 No matter how much you saved, it's nothing trivial. 

69
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,710
 Hui Gyeong... 

70
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:45,540
 Gosh, come here. 

71
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:50,810
 Jun Woo. 

72
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:54,790
 Sit here. 

73
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:05,540
 I bought this on my business trip. 

74
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:06,930
 It fits you perfectly. 

75
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:09,420
 So you can come to me wearing these. 

76
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:12,310
 I'll be good to you. 

77
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:14,290
 Come to me, Han Jun Woo. 

78
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,740
Sis!

79
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,490
My cell phone.

80
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:26,610
- Hello. 
 - Hi.

81
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,310
- What is it?
 - I don't have my cell phone.

82
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:33,130
You're so clumsy. Why did you leave it?

83
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:36,730
- Do it properly!
 - I'm sorry!

84
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,170
- Open the lid. Right now. 
 - It's a snack.

85
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:41,290
Snack my butt.

86
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:43,010
So that's how they make snacks these days?

87
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:44,670
Go!

88
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:49,140
- Would you like one? 
 - You must be thirsty.

89
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:51,110
Here, do you want a shot?

90
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:53,000
- Sorry. 
 - Go!

91
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,880
- Isn't it cold, sir? 
 - What's wrong with your chest?

92
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,680
Open up. Open up!

93
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,990
Seriously, all you rascals gotta be f***ing kidding me!

94
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:00,860
- Go over there! 
 - A trip to go see new scenery is...

95
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:04,160
- Are you guys waiters? What's with carrying all the alcohol? 
 - Mr. Han?

96
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,200
Please have a safe trip.

97
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:08,000
Ah... yes. Thank you.

98
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,530
So cute.

99
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:15,000
So gross. I've got to get a girlfriend or something.

100
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,750
Hey, if that worked out like you wished, you wouldn't be single until now.

101
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,700
What's up with the hat? Are you Kim Sat Gat? 
  (TN:  A Joseon poet who was called the Wandering Minstrel) 

102
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:23,730
- This is why you don't have a girlfriend. 
 - Make a heart shape.

103
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:26,220
What the... Look at them. Are they also a couple?

104
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:28,690
What's going on? Why are you guys matching?

105
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:32,760
Are you guys making a surprise announcement of your relationship?

106
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:36,220
- That's not it!
 - Im Ju Gyeong, I think that's what you were going after.

107
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:39,530
Did you want to become my girlfriend that badly? Should we just start dating?

108
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:43,100
- What's wrong with you? Put your jacket on now. 
 - I don't want to. I'm hot.

109
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,460
- What do you mean hot? It's cold. Hurry. 
 - I'm healthy and strong!

110
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:47,810
Should I draw you some stripes? It'll be quick.

111
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:49,950

Oh, Lee Su Ho, you're sitting in the front? I'm sitting here.

Pause! Pause!

119
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:20,730
Is this something like "we're a couple and sitting together"?

120
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:25,890
You should date! You should date! You should date!

121
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:28,180
There are a lot of empty seats in the front.

122
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:30,450

 - Oh dear, this is too heavy.

 - Huh?

145
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:36,800
This bird.

146
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:40,340
- What bird?
 - That bird.

147
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:46,070
That bird...

148
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,170
What's the microphone for?

149
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:55,200
I brought it to use it all night.

156
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:16,570
It's been a while for me too. Camping with Lee Su Ho's family when I was little was the last time.

157
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:20,500
So you've been really close to Lee Su Ho since you were young, huh?

158
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,370
Right, right, right.

A girl from class 6 confessed to Lee Su Ho, but he dumped her saying that he liked someone else.

00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:34,640
Isn't it you, Kang Su?

162
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,590
And you believe that? He just made something up.

163
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:39,240
You're always trying to make a couple out of people, Choi Su Ah.

164
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,790
What? There were so many rumors of you guys dating since freshman year.

165
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:44,870
Even at a glance, you two look great together as a couple,

166
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:47,890
so it doesn't make sense that you've been just friends for 10 years, does it?

167
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:49,230
Tell  us, Kang Su.

168
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:53,240
Have you ever seen Lee Su Ho as a guy for even a second?

169
00:10:57,020 --> 00:11:00,990
- What are you saying?
 - Have you, have you? Never? Never?

170
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:03,900
That tickles!

171
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,150
Guys, look here.

172
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:10,050
Making only one person look pretty!  I'll go first!

173
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:12,780
One, two, three!

174
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:14,910
- One, two...
 - You want to die?

175
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:17,520
Stop messing with me.

176
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,620
- If you do it one more time— 
 - Do it properly!

177
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,250
Do it properly!

178
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:24,940
Background change!

179
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:26,810
One, two, three!

180
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:29,440
Guys! Everyone, gather up. I'll take a picture for you.

181
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,980
Yes, sir!

182
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:37,250
Su Ho, join in.

183
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:39,720
- I'm fine. 
 - Yeah?

184
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,490
Look at you, not social at all.

185
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:45,270
You should get in the picture.

186
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:46,870
No thanks, that's too much of a bother.

187
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:49,060
- Okay, I'm taking the picture now. 
 - Okay!

188
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:52,440
One, two, three, four.

189
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:55,470
What was that?

190
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:57,310
It looks more natural this way.

191
00:11:57,310 --> 00:11:59,920
Teacher, can you take a couple's picture for these two?

192
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,370
Yes!

193
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:07,590
Hey! Who's dating in school?

194
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:10,290
- These two, sir! 
 - No, we're not. 
 - You kids, wait and see when I catch you!

195
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:14,460
Sir, you're now caught in the frame.

196
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:16,960
- Do the heart! 
 - Taking the picture now!

197
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,170
One, two! Took it.

198
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:22,690
- What? Teacher, please! 
 - What is this?

199
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:24,980
- Are you guys really a couple? 
 - You guys are really dating, right?

200
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:27,220
Hey, they're dating!

201
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:29,900
No, we aren't! Hey, take off your shirt.

202
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:32,900
Hey, why are you trying to undress me?  You're so naughty!

203
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:37,700
- No, I meant for you to change! 
 - Whoa! Look at them!

204
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,490
The cutie of recreational activities, I'm MC Jae Rong! Nice to see you all!

205
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:46,350
- We're playing the newspaper game. Everyone knows it, right? 
 - Yes.

206
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:48,340
Four people become one team.

207
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:51,700
The most important thing is to choose the person who'll be good at it or the person you really like.

208
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,730
Get into teams of four! Alright, get together.

209
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:56,860
Find the person you like, the person you're interested in.

210
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:00,300
- Ju Gyeong! Come. 
  - For example, if you don't like someone, kick that person out!

211
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:03,240
- Here! 
  - If you don't like that person, kick him or her out! That's right!  It's important to make a four-person team.

212
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,040
No groups of three or five.

213
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,500
- Go. Go. Go. 
 - By chance, if your group has five people, you need to kick one out.

214
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,790
- You're trying to leave your girlfriend behind? Do you want to die? 
 - Sometimes you should also know how to let go of one boldly.

215
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:15,100
Four people in one team. Is there anyone left out?

216
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:17,970
- Come here. 
 - Are you guys in groups of four now? 
 - Yes!

217
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:20,010
Alright, gather together now in groups of four.

218
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:23,970
Oh, wow!

219
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:28,990
- See, I told you! 
 - Well, now I'll explain the rules of the newspaper game.

220
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:32,120
Everyone will stand on the folded up newspaper.

221
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:35,350
You win if you can do it for five seconds. Get on the newspaper now, please.

222
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:36,830
Get on the newspaper.

223
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:39,900
That first place spot is ours. Hold on tight.

224
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:42,390
- Good luck! 
 - Good luck. 
 - If anyone's foot is outside of the paper, your team is out!

225
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:44,100
Is everyone standing on the newspaper?

226
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:47,420
- Argh, hold on, sorry! 
 - Your foot should never leave the square, never!

227
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:50,980
- Hey, do it properly! 
 - H-H-Hey... this isn't right...

228
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:54,090
- Good luck.  
 - The timer for the newspaper game will start!

229
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:56,470
- Oh dear, wait! 
 - One, two...

230
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:59,380
Hey, hold on.

231
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:04,850
... Three, four, four, four, four! I see many of you are falling!

232
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:07,650
Give a round of applause to these final three!

233
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:11,270
Wow, great! How passionate you guys are! Great!  Now, the important thing is!

234
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:14,000
Everyone, listen. Since you three teams are so good,

235
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,990
we're going to upgrade the game.

236
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:20,240
Make the newspaper 1/4 smaller.

237
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,440
Fold it!  Don't feel too pressured, but just fold it!

238
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,690
Let's play the game passionately.  Fold it, please. Fold it now.

239
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:29,510
- Let's go, carry me... 
 - What are you doing, Ahn Hyeon Gyu?

240
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:31,240
Like this, you should reduce the number of legs!

241
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:34,580
- Where are you going? 
 - The guys only team, what are you going to do?

242
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:41,750
I'll carry you. Get on.

243
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:45,260
One, two, three.

244
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:48,070
No, no, no!

245
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:53,750
Wow, what a cool guy here! He's carrying the girl!

246
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:08,510
I'm going to count down. Five, four, three, two...

247
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:10,400
The male student team is out!

248
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,480
These two teams succeeded. They succeeded.

249
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,910
They're doing so well, but we need a final winner.

250
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:18,030
Out of the two teams, the team that falls will lose. Are you ready?

251
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:20,090
Male students, raise one leg up!

252
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:22,450
I don't think I can do this. I can't.

253
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:25,380
Raise your leg, then we'll start the countdown.

254
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:27,660
Raise your leg. Okay. Five, four...

255
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:32,920
What the... Ahn Hyeon Gyu, your head smells like poop!

256
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:35,860
Wow, how amazing!

257
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:38,460
Wash your hair!

258
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:42,250
Take your prize. Congratulations. Good job, good job.

259
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:44,150
- Good work. 
 - It hurts here.

260
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:47,200
- Where does it hurt? 
 - Here.

261
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:53,950
 Have you ever seen Lee Su Ho as a guy for even a second? 

262
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:58,590
No access is allowed?  It has a warning sign. 
    

263
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:02,260
- Hey, doesn't it feel a bit spooky here? 
 - Are you a scaredy-cat? You are bulky like a mountain.

264
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:05,430
- You can't go there! 
 - Argh, that scared me!

265
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,930
You can never go there.

266
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:13,720
Why? Is there something in this forest?

267
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:16,740
We can't lose any more people.

268
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:19,130
What? People? Why?

269
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:21,790
That direction.

270
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:25,630
No, no, just act like you never heard this.

271
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:29,330
Anyway, you can never go in that direction.

272
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:31,320
- Understood? 
 - Yes.

273
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:35,110
- Got it? 
 - Yes, sir.

274
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:41,970
- What is it? I'm so curious. 
 - No, no, let's not go that way.

275
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:45,870
- I'm curious. 
 - No, no.

276
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:51,940
No one's going to buy it! Stop bothering the customers and go. Go!

277
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:53,450
Then, what should I do with the rest of these?

278
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:55,650
Aroma candles or whatever, would you like me to use them for your funeral?!

279
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,580
Either sell them to a junk shop or throw them away!

280
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:14,140
 Prince Comics 

281
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:23,850
 Hiring: a part-timer for weekends 
 Wages and time are negotiable 

282
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,550
There has never been a scented candle like this before.

283
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:36,160
Is it a scented candle or a fragrance?

284
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,980
- I'm not buying. 
 - I'm just giving it to you.

285
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:41,050
If you're going to talk about stuff like a treasure ship, please leave.

286
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:43,310
The proudest moment of my life is

287
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:46,590
when I didn't invest my money when you were talking about the treasure ship.  That's it.

288
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:50,720
Why are you speaking about the past?

289
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:54,080
Hey, I was wondering...

290
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:59,840
Here. About that part-time weekend job, can I have it?

291
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,640
Part-time? I already found someone for it.

292
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,660
Already? Okay.

293
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,740
Is it good?

294
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:14,150
Can I have a bite?

295
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:18,350
What are you doing?

296
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:21,390
Just one bite!

297
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:23,860
Hey, you want to eat this?

298
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:25,500
Eat it, eat it!

299
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,110
It's good.

300
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:30,820
Kim Si Hyeon.

301
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:32,830
What's this?

302
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:35,040
The smell was bad earlier, right?

303
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,140
I just washed my hair.

304
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:39,040
- Enjoy your food. 
 - He has a conscience, at least.

305
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:41,180
Hey, Ahn Hyeon Gyu.

306
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:42,900
It didn't smell that bad.

307
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,550
- Hey, why are you lying? 
 - You almost threw up!

308
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:48,600
What's up with him?

309
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:52,020
What's this smell?

310
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:54,020
- Please leave them here. 
 - Eat the mushrooms too.

311
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:56,680
- Let me know if you run out of anything. 
 - Yes, thank you.

312
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:59,730
Enjoy your food!

313
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:03,240
It's really delicious, really good.

314
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,500
Hey, is Im Ju Gyeong a museum artifact?

315
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,480
What, the Ancient Celadon, or something like that?

316
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,450
It's Goryeo Celadon.

317
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:15,350
How long are you just going to stare at her from afar?

318
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:17,920
Later, I'm going to lay down the works for you. Subtly find out how she feels.

319
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,290
- Then, you can confess. 
 - Eat this.

320
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:25,160
- Argh... 
 - Eat!

321
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:28,550
- Is this now cooked? 
 - Take it slowly.

322
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,310
This is good.

323
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:34,490
Are you an animal? Let it cook more before eating it!

324
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:37,790
Hey, don't eat the pork like such a pig. Eat more like a human!

325
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:39,650
Teacher, I'm a human.

326
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:42,490
- You guys enjoying the food? 
 - Yes!

327
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:45,920
Let me see the fire. Yeah, it's good.

328
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:50,300
Sir, what were you going to tell us earlier?

329
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,680
Oh, that. It's just a story from the past.

330
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,880
What is it? Please tell us! Please, please, please tell us!

331
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:56,750
It's not much, so why are you so curious?

332
00:19:56,750 --> 00:20:00,150
No, please! Tell us.

333
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:03,250
Alright, then.

334
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:10,060
- Listen closely. 
 - Yes.

335
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:16,430
Long ago, in the forest, there was a well.

336
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:26,260
  My wife, we have already married, but why do you still hide your face from me? 

337
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:28,190
  I'm shy. 

338
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:30,500
  How shy you are. 

339
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:36,120
  Morning will come before we even have our first wedding night. 

340
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:39,750
  Then, please answer one thing. 

341
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:44,400
 Husband, do you like fool's gold? 

342
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,560
 No matter what the color of fool's gold is, it's not actual gold after all. 

343
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:50,350
 They say to not judge a book by its cover.  

344
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:52,580
  Why are you asking? 

345
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:57,250
  Enough of that talk, you can come here. 

346
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:00,810
  Don't be shy. You can raise your head. 

347
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:05,190
  Then, please don't be shocked. 

348
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,550
  - My husband! 
 - Is this why you didn't show your face? 

349
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:18,980
 You said to not judge a book by its cover.  

350
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,670
  - My husband! 
 - Let go. 

351
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:23,750
  - Where are you going? 
 - Let go! 

352
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,750
 Soon Dol!  Soon Dol! 

353
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:29,120
 - Husband! 
 - Let go!  Soon Dol! 

354
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:41,740
 Born with an ugly face, I couldn't even be in my husband's arms. 

355
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:49,820
 My life is worth even less than fool's gold. 

356
00:21:57,020 --> 00:22:02,320
  What do you like so much about me to be following me everywhere? 

357
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,580
 I like your wide chest, sir! 

358
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:09,660
 What do you mean? I like his sturdy thighs! 

359
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:11,690
  That's good. Everything is good! 

360
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:13,990
 Ah, this is fantastic! 

361
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:17,870
 Then, tonight, let's enjoy our time together until the dawn breaks! 

362
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:20,890
  - That sounds good! 
 - Yes, that's great. 

363
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,380
That woman died with much resentment.

364
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:32,220
At night, she's roaming around as an ugly-faced ghost,

365
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:35,150
and to the face of anyone she encounters, BAM!

366
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:36,870
She steals their faces.

367
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:41,130
That's why the people from this area never go in that direction.

368
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:42,940
As some people had gone missing too,

369
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:47,380
we even had a shamanist rite for this ugly-faced ghost in front of that well.

370
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:49,320
No way.

371
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:52,540
What kind of nonsense is an ugly-faced ghost who steals faces?

372
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:54,580
It's really hard to pretend we're scared too.

373
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:57,080
That's why you told us not to go into the forest?

374
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:00,650
But since she only steals pretty and handsome faces,

375
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:02,890
you can all decide for yourselves.

376
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:06,550
Just don't go by yourself. Got it?

377
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,450
It's almost night.

378
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:13,870
Don't worry. Nothing will happen to you guys.

379
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:16,810
- Don't worry. 
 - I... Gosh, Teacher!

380
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:18,880
Except for me, you guys are all okay.

381
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,880
You should go around with your friend, holding hands.

382
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,880
  The Late Jeong Se Yeon's Memorial Album Project 

383
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,010
  The Late Jeong Se Yeon's Memorial Album Project 

384
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:36,630
 It's nice to meet you. 

385
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:40,700
 I'm Im Hui Gyeong of Move Entertainment's Planning and Development Team. 

386
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,420
 Haven't we met somewhere? 

387
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:43,830
 I don't think so. 

388
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:47,130
 Right? I guess I was mistaken. 

389
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:49,880
 What is this about? 

390
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,050
 I'll get to the point. 

391
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:57,580
 We're planning a memorial album of unreleased songs for the first anniversary of Jeong Se Yeon's death. 

392
00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:01,510
 But most of the songs he left behind 

393
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:06,210
 were co-produced with someone named Leo. 

394
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:08,580
 Do you know how long we've been looking for you? 

395
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:11,090
 Mr. Han Seo Jun, you're Leo, right? 

396
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:13,790
 I'm not. 

397
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:17,460
 Maybe you want to keep it secret. 

398
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:20,760
 It's up to you if you don't want to believe it. 

399
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,600
 It's funny. 

400
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:26,910
 You kicked him out as soon as the scandal of school violence started and let him die. 

401
00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:29,010
 And you're doing this now? 

402
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:35,420
 Move will never be able to make the memorial album. 

403
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:41,190
 Even if I have to die, I won't let it happen. 

404
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:54,880
How do I persuade him?

405
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:01,500
 Move Entertainment 

406
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:05,100
- Yes. 
 - Big sis.

407
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:08,310
I'm home by myself. When will you be home?

408
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:12,030
Let's start the game. Time limit is 30 minutes.

409
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:13,600
Order some chicken.

410
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,710
To eat or not to eat, the choice is yours.

411
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:19,900
Seriously, stop playing around.

412
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:27,050
- CEO. 
 - You're working so late.

413
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:30,050
- It's okay. Have you eaten?
 - No, not yet.

414
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:32,840
Director Oh, how about some chicken?

415
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:35,650
- The choice is yours. 
 - Sounds good.

416
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:38,170
It's because you seemed to feel embarrassed. Was I funny?

417
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:39,940
Yes, thank you.

418
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:45,050
- Right, CEO, I met Han Seo Jun.
 - Is that so?

419
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:48,000
But he rejected saying he's not Leo.

420
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,750
He was friends with Se Yeon, so he must have bad feelings about the company.

421
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:54,060
But I don't think we should let him go.

422
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:57,300
It would be a waste to let his music making skills go.

423
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,810
I want to persuade him a little more.

424
00:25:58,810 --> 00:26:00,870
You're very passionate.

425
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:04,320
Please take care of newbies of our company with that attitude.

426
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,640
Yes, sir.

427
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:09,150
- Good night. 
- Yes, thank you. Good bye.

428
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:12,360
Chicken, chicken, chicken!

429
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:15,980
About the memorial album, was it still ongoing?

430
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:19,880
I thought if we didn't rush her, she would wrap it up, but seems like she's been on it.

431
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:22,630
I will take care of it.

432
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:30,950
Yes, Hui Gyeong. No, other teachers are asleep.

433
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:35,140
Why aren't you sleeping? Are you thinking about me?

434
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:38,780
I can't really sleep when I'm away.

435
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:40,270
Should I sing you a lullaby?

436
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:43,480
No, no, I'll just go to bed. Good night.

437
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:46,400
♫ I love you, I love you.

438
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:50,290
♫ I love you.

439
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:53,250
 ♫ I love you, I love you. 

440
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:54,610
- I love you? 
 - I love you?

441
00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:55,750
I love you?

442
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:59,340
Mom. Mother? Are you at a noraebang?

443
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:01,000
Are you dating someone?

444
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,250
I'm not!

445
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:04,750
Sorry.

446
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:06,850
- Good night. 
 - Good night.

447
00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:09,650
♫ I love you!

448
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:14,450
You're making me lose my appetite for the chicken, seriously.

449
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:17,430
♫ I love you! I love you!

450
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:20,590
♫ I love you!

451
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:24,260
What's wrong with you?! My neck hurts!

452
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:25,840
Ahn Hyeon Gyu, you've pooped your pants before!

453
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,710
Are you joking? No.

454
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:31,260
Kim Si Hyeon.

455
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:33,810
I'm the universe's best goddess.

456
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:36,260
No!

457
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:37,640
- You lied! 
 - Lied!

458
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:41,020
Lee Su Ho, I've had a first kiss.

459
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:43,490
Three, two, one!

460
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:45,270
Answer it!

461
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:46,640
Hurry! Answer it!

462
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,730
He's never played the game, sheesh.

463
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:51,830
Love or friendship?

464
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:54,950
Love.

465
00:27:57,140 --> 00:28:00,530
- That's so corny! As it's too corny, hit him! 
 - Hit him! Hit him!

466
00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:02,920
- It's the truth!
 - So cringy!

467
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:06,000
- I'm handsome, right?
 - Yeah.

468
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,450
- Why did you lie? 
 - You lied!

469
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:12,100
- Yoo Tae Hoon or Eighteen?  (T/N: A parody of 'Seventeen')   
- Of course, my honey Yoo Tae Hoon.

470
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,700
- True love! 
 - I like it!

471
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:14,500
Hit both of them.

472
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:17,470
You guys are gross.

473
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:21,560
- I have someone I like.
 - Yes!

474
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:25,190
You liar.

475
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:26,800
- Why did you lie and say you liked someone? 
 - It was a lie!

476
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:29,540
- It's a lie! 
 - A liar!

477
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:33,920
There was a time you wanted to break up with Su Ah.

478
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:37,230
No.

479
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:46,120
Try it again. There was a time you wanted to break up with me.

480
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:48,590
Oh no. I said no.

481
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:51,220
See? I said no.

482
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:53,320
Try it again. There was a time you wanted to break up with me.

483
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:55,910
Absolutely not! No! Never!

484
00:28:55,910 --> 00:28:58,650
No? I don't think so. It seems you should say yes.

485
00:28:58,650 --> 00:29:00,550
- You're wrong. 
 - Is that so?

486
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:03,620
- That's what you thought? 
 - No.

487
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:05,720
Let's break up!

488
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,690
Su Ah! Su Ah!

489
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:09,030
Su Ah!

490
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:11,590
Su Ah!

491
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:14,250
I'm a girl.

492
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:21,740
It works fine.

493
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:27,740
I like someone.

494
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:34,690
It works fine now.

495
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:41,730
Lee Su Ho, when did you get here?

496
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:44,030
You should've said something.

497
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:48,220
I'll get going.

498
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:52,010
- Im Ju Gyeong. 
 - Yeah? What?

499
00:29:52,010 --> 00:29:56,150
- Come with me for a sec.
 - What?

500
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:01,610
Okay...

501
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:07,490
Is he mad?

502
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:09,730
What is it?

503
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,860
Why did you avoid me today?

504
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:21,700
I didn't avoid you.

505
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,100
- Really? 
 - Of course.

506
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:28,980
Should we use the lie detector?

507
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:32,530
You know, that's not very reliable.

508
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:34,630
Then I guess not.

509
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:39,410
The trail is prettier at night.

510
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,990
Why is there no bench?

511
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:48,160
There are so many stars.

512
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:50,770
Where?

513
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:53,160
It's so cloudy.

514
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:08,230
You know in the movies, zombies jump out from the bush and stuff, so...

515
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:14,700
So what did you have to tell me? Why did you bring me here?

516
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:19,520
- That is— 
 - Oh?

517
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,580
Look at that.

518
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:37,780
This is so pretty. It's like a picture.

519
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:40,970
I know.

520
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,340
Should I play some music?

521
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,600
 Motorhead - Ace of Spades 
 Ironmaiden - Run to the Hills 

522
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,640
 Megadeath - Hanger18 
 Guns N' Roses - Welcome to the Jungle 

523
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,390
I'm low on battery.

524
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:04,460
I'll play some.

525
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:21,730
 Missing you - by Unknown 

526
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,990
Wow. 
 ♫  The sky dyed in purple    ♫

527
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:40,440
He's got a good voice. Who sang it?

528
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,530
Se Yeon.

529
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:45,640
♫  The night when a forlorn breeze feels icier   ♫

530
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,960
I like it.

531
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,720
♫  The familiar memories   ♫

532
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,000
I think I've never heard it before.

533
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,420
♫  Engraved on my mind   ♫

534
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:55,200
It's an unreleased song.

535
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,020
♫  They are again filled with you    ♫

536
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:59,590
You're the first one to hear it.

537
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:02,500
Is that so?

538
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:07,430
♫  Only thankful memories remain  ♫

539
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:11,400
♫  Feeling excited together...  ♫

540
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:14,500
I don't want to, seriously.

541
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:15,500
Where are you going?

542
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:18,000
They want to go catch a ghost.

543
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,990
There is a ghost at the well.

544
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:23,880
If I film the horror experience and upload it on Youtube, wouldn't it get so many views?

545
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:26,090
Come with us.

546
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:29,420
I don't want to. Go ahead.

547
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:33,730
Han Seo Jun, you must be afraid of ghosts.

548
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:37,630
- Where is the well? 
 - There!

549
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:39,620
- There! 
 - There... hey...

550
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:43,790
- Oh, Han Seo Jun! 
 - Come on!

551
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:55,220
Sorry, you don't like it.

552
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:01,190
But why don't you like it?

553
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:07,560
When I was little, I had hard time because of the paparazzi.

554
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:12,530
I see why you don't like it. It must've been tiring.

555
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:16,910
You should take more.

556
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:31,970
You like taking pictures?

557
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:36,830
I used to not like it,

558
00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:39,680
but since I started putting on make up,

559
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:42,230
I like it.

560
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:43,820
- You like it?
 - Yeah.

561
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:45,420
I like it.

562
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:48,130
Do you like boating?

563
00:34:48,130 --> 00:34:51,090
Yes, I like it.

564
00:34:53,490 --> 00:34:57,120
Then... do you like listening music?

565
00:34:57,120 --> 00:35:00,060
Sure, I like it.

566
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:10,980
Do you want to take a picture with me?

567
00:35:45,370 --> 00:35:46,840
Im Ju Gyeong!

568
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,530
Guys, it's not too late yet. Aaarrrggg!

569
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,520
Stop it.

570
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:56,730
Don't freak out. There is nothing.

571
00:35:56,730 --> 00:35:58,720
It feels like there is something.

572
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,780
Seriously.

573
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:03,190
Hey, come quickly.

574
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:05,400
What is he saying is in here?

575
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:09,450
I'm really sorry. Because of me...

576
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:14,100
But did all of my makeup get removed?

577
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:16,740
Yeah.

578
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:20,380
What do I do?

579
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:23,300
The kids can't see it.

580
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:26,060
Do you want me to get you your makeup?

581
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:29,810
  My bag has my undergarments and everything. 

582
00:36:29,810 --> 00:36:33,530
No, I'll just hide well and go.

583
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:38,030
It's cold, right?

584
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:41,520
No. I'm not cold at all.

585
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,360
Since your body temperature can't drop.

586
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:52,910
 My heart, you're acting silly. 

587
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:56,890
 This is not a romantic scene but a survival scene in a disaster! 

588
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:06,300
Su Jin?

589
00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:14,560
Lee Su Ho?

590
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:20,380
What's going on? Why are you soaking wet? Did you fall into water?

591
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:21,710
I was walking and then my foot slipped.

592
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:25,680
- You should be careful. Are you okay? 
 - Yes.

593
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:29,450
- But they said you went together with Ju Gyeong. 
 - No, I didn't.

594
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:31,490
Oh, is that so?

595
00:37:34,410 --> 00:37:36,080
What's that sound?

596
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:40,890
- A wild boar. Wild boar. 
 - What?

597
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:43,340
- Let's go. 
 - Hey!

598
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:55,960
Go inside.

599
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:58,750
- What about you?
 - I need to find something.

600
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:00,620
Hey, Lee Su Ho.

601
00:38:21,770 --> 00:38:24,390
Guys, that's the well.

602
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:27,110
It's creepy, right?

603
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:31,910
Look at him! He freaked out!

604
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:34,390
- Stop it, jerk! 
 - You stop it!

605
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:36,420
It's not funny.

606
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:39,220
What is that?

607
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:41,610
- Don't do it. 
 - Cho Rong, don't go...

608
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:44,800
Guys, it's nothing.

609
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:48,430
Everybody, we just heard something suspicious from there.

610
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:50,280
I'll try to go there.

611
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,440
No...

612
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:11,020
They probably didn't recognize me, right? What do I do?

613
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:13,000
Hey, Kim Cho Rong!

614
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,760
The well is here.

615
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,900
Where'd they go?

616
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:30,070
Where'd they go?

617
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:35,330
Go quickly, seriously.

618
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:01,530
Gosh, that scared me.

619
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:11,480
 Missed call from Lee Su Ho 

620
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,340
 Text from Lee Su Ho 

621
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:15,950
  Why aren't you answering your phone? Where are you? 

622
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:33,010
  Yeah, I just came inside. 

623
00:40:50,890 --> 00:40:52,770
It's all wet.

624
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:12,300
It feels like I went in and out of a fairy tale for a little while.

625
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:17,540
But the reality is a gutter.

626
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:45,210
Im Ju, you already woke up?

627
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:47,840
Of course I woke up.

628
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:51,230
This girl is pretty even in the morning.

629
00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:09,360
Team leader, why am I suddenly moved to the PR team?

630
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,040
Now is not the usual period of personnel change, either.

631
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:15,000
I know. I found out when I saw the announcement.

632
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,150
Then what about the projects I've been working on?

633
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:20,010
By any chance, Ms. Im,

634
00:42:20,010 --> 00:42:22,930
did you do something to make you an outcast to the CEO or other executives?

635
00:42:22,930 --> 00:42:26,790
It's strange that you're the only one transferred out of the blue, isn't it?

636
00:42:26,790 --> 00:42:28,880
I've done nothing wrong.

637
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:33,350
And if I'm an outcast, then is it okay for them to move me around as they please?

638
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:36,230
Okay, kids. What do you think the highlight of a field trip is?

639
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:39,690
- Talking casually to teachers! 
 - Ball games!

640
00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:44,340
The highlight of a field trip is the treasure hunt.

641
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:46,950
That's boring.

642
00:42:46,950 --> 00:42:49,390
I hid them well.

643
00:42:49,390 --> 00:42:51,750
So search while enjoying the scenery.

644
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:53,780
It's not like we're elementary kids!

645
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:56,260
We're not 8 but 18.

646
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:59,800
- That's true.
 - Teacher, I'm hungry!

647
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:03,440
The first place prize is a ₩50,000 gift card!

648
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:06,290
- ₩50,000? 
 - We have to find it!

649
00:43:06,290 --> 00:43:08,830
Go! Go! Go!

650
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:15,620
Teacher, I'm not feeling well.

651
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:32,580
Im Ju Gyeong.

652
00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:35,130
Are you hurt somewhere?

653
00:43:41,430 --> 00:43:44,490
You're hot. Why did you leave it like this?

654
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:55,320
- I found it!
 - Me too!

655
00:43:56,830 --> 00:43:58,280
How is this treasure?

656
00:43:58,280 --> 00:43:59,580
  Knowledge is power. 

657
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:02,730
- ₩50,000! 
 - Hey! That's my wise saying!

658
00:44:02,730 --> 00:44:04,040
I found it!

659
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:06,600
You found it?

660
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:09,790
- I found it. 
 - You found it?

661
00:44:11,050 --> 00:44:13,250
  You know the depth of love only 

662
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:16,000
  in the pain of separation. 

663
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:18,840
It's okay, it's okay.

664
00:44:18,850 --> 00:44:19,950
Move aside!

665
00:44:19,950 --> 00:44:22,150
Hey, where are you going? 
 ♫  I can't let you go even if I die   ♫

666
00:44:22,150 --> 00:44:25,310
♫  How can I let you go?  ♫

667
00:44:25,310 --> 00:44:27,230
I can't let you go even if I die.

668
00:44:27,230 --> 00:44:28,820
How can I let you go?

669
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:30,810
If you want to go, if you want to leave,

670
00:44:30,810 --> 00:44:33,350
fix my heart, you fool!

671
00:44:33,350 --> 00:44:36,620
Why would you die?

672
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:40,650
Anyone who loves Choi Su Ah, raise your hand.

673
00:44:44,470 --> 00:44:47,230
Anyone who can't forget Choi Su Ah, raise your hand.

674
00:44:47,230 --> 00:44:50,270
Anyone who wants to hold on to Choi Su Ah, raise your hand!

675
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:52,510
Darling!

676
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:07,280
Wake up for a sec. I got some fever reducers.

677
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:21,230
How'd you know?

678
00:45:28,710 --> 00:45:30,500
Take a nap.

679
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:32,210
Thanks.

680
00:45:32,210 --> 00:45:34,040
Don't be sick.

681
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:36,850
I hate it when someone is sick.

682
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,830
Su Ho, did you find anything?

683
00:45:48,830 --> 00:45:51,260
Hey, Lee Su Ho. I found the first place prize!

684
00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:53,060
Have you not seen Im Ju Gyeong?

685
00:45:53,970 --> 00:45:55,520
Ju Gyeong?

686
00:46:51,470 --> 00:46:53,150
She'll wake up.

687
00:46:53,150 --> 00:46:54,660
Let go.

688
00:46:55,220 --> 00:46:57,050
What if I don't want to?

689
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:00,040
Get off the bus.

690
00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:33,420
What? It looks like they're fighting.

691
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:37,470
- Are you a human?
- Did you sprain your eyes? Then what do you see me as?

692
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:42,600
- You know I like her! 
 - Is it first come, first served? So what if you liked her first?

693
00:47:43,750 --> 00:47:44,920
Are they really fighting?

694
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:49,030
- Why does it have to be Im Ju Gyeong?! 
 - I don't know why it's her either!

695
00:47:49,030 --> 00:47:51,160
- Give up! 
 - Why me?!

696
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:53,650
Aren't Im Ju Gyeong's feelings important?

697
00:47:58,770 --> 00:48:01,060
I told you to give up.

698
00:48:02,650 --> 00:48:04,830
My feelings don't work like that.

699
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:17,910
My eyebrows! What are you going to do about it?

700
00:48:17,910 --> 00:48:20,270
I told you yesterday.

701
00:48:20,270 --> 00:48:23,250
That if you do it thick, it'll look weird for about a week.

702
00:48:23,250 --> 00:48:24,600
After some time, it'll be okay.

703
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:27,140
They say I look like Jjangu! 
  (TN: Jjangu is Shin-chan from the cartoon 'Crayon Shin-chan') 

704
00:48:27,140 --> 00:48:30,100
Do I have to hear that I look like Jjangu at this age?!

705
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:31,700
I should have done it at Gangnam.

706
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:33,870
I came all the way here because I heard you were good.

707
00:48:33,870 --> 00:48:37,070
Give me a refund right now and return my eyebrows back to normal!

708
00:48:37,070 --> 00:48:40,030
Then go get it done at Gangnam. Why are you fussing here?

709
00:48:40,030 --> 00:48:42,230
How dare you to a customer...!

What are you doing? In someone else's workplace?

713
00:48:54,950 --> 00:49:00,320
It's because she made someone's eyebrows look like this ... Sir.

714

If you still look like Jjangu after a week, then come back.

Yeah, I said thank you. What about it?

Suho~ my best friend! Hey, hey.

726
00:50:05,950 --> 00:50:09,060
What's this? Did you make up with Choi Su Ah?

727

Don't you know the saying that one must know the pain of separation in order to know the depth of love?

Who knew my love would be this deep? A basement of three floors, no, four floors.

729
00:50:16,550 --> 00:50:18,160
You still haven't confessed?

730
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:23,530
You should do it by today. A confession should just come out from extraordinary things.

731
00:50:23,530 --> 00:50:26,340
That'll increase the rate of success. Do you understand, man?

732
00:50:26,340 --> 00:50:30,360
Hey, Im Ju Gyeong! I heard you took some meds earlier. Are you feeling better now?

00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,370
Are you eating well?

Again! Again, again, you're bothering Lee Su Ho.

738

Hey, this guy doesn't like you. You should catch on by now.

739
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,160
What are you saying? Speak properly.

- What?
 - What? What?

741
00:50:49,910 --> 00:50:52,920
- Are you copying me? What? 
 - Are you copying me? What?

742
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:01,530
What did you set up here?

743
00:51:01,530 --> 00:51:06,080
Well, today, the moon's nice, Ju Gyeong's not here,

744
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:09,080
and Hui Gyeong and Ju Yeong will be home late.

745
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:11,380
So I set this up. Come sit down.

746
00:51:13,190 --> 00:51:17,900
As I gave you one compliment after scolding you every day, you're now so excited, eh?

747
00:51:18,790 --> 00:51:21,110
Why the tofu-kimchi?

748

Do you not remember our first date?

749
00:51:23,650 --> 00:51:27,840
At Cheongpyeong, we ate tofu-kimchi while drinking rice wine.

750
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:29,900
You sure do remember everything.

751
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:33,690
I should've ran away back then. Why did I fall for him?

752
00:51:33,690 --> 00:51:36,240
I'm still suffering even now.

753
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:38,590
Too bad I have a weakness for pretty faces. Too bad!

754
00:51:38,590 --> 00:51:41,230
You're breaking the mood.

755
00:51:46,090 --> 00:51:50,430
But still... your looks were the best back then.

756
00:51:50,430 --> 00:51:54,660
And with that face, you also sang well. How could I not fall for you?

757
00:51:54,660 --> 00:51:57,140

00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:52,300
What is he dragging with his teeth? A bicycle!

788
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:54,250
Strength show...

789
00:54:54,250 --> 00:54:57,340
Success!

790
00:54:57,340 --> 00:54:59,510
A bigger one!

791
00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:02,510
Go!

792
00:55:07,430 --> 00:55:11,520
The master of inner-force, breaking the balloons a moment later!

793
00:55:13,270 --> 00:55:16,480
Finish!

794
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:19,080
♫  Jjara papa!  You're beautiful!   ♫

795
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:22,250
Dance time!

796
00:55:22,250 --> 00:55:24,200
Everybody clap with the beat.

797
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:27,820
♫  Jjara papa!  You're reliable!   ♫

798
00:55:27,820 --> 00:55:31,670
♫  Jja, jjara, jjara papapa!   ♫

799
00:55:31,690 --> 00:55:35,440
♫  Jjara papa!  Don't be shy   ♫

800
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:39,190
♫  Jja, jjara, jjara papapa!   ♫

801
00:55:39,190 --> 00:55:43,170
♫  Jjara papa!  Let's sing delightfully!   ♫

802
00:55:43,170 --> 00:55:46,240
♫  Jjara jjara papapa!   ♫

803
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:49,860
The idol of our Saebom High School.

804
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:52,740
I heard there is a friend who was an idol trainee.

805
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:54,600
Where are you? Raise your hand!

806
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:57,600
- Over here! 
 - Many friends already know who it is.

807
00:55:57,600 --> 00:55:59,070
- What?  
 - Great!  Please give him a hand!

808
00:55:59,070 --> 00:56:03,410
- His handsome halo-like aura is no joke. We can't just leave him be. 
 - Gosh, the rumor is already out?

809
00:56:03,410 --> 00:56:06,260
How far did the rumors spread?

810
00:56:06,260 --> 00:56:09,010
- Hey, hey, hey. Don't joke around. 
 - The friend over there, sit down!

811
00:56:09,010 --> 00:56:11,840
We can't just leave him like that. Come up to the stage. Give him a big hand and cheer!

812
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:16,050
- Hey, Kim Cho Rong. It was you, right?
 - Hey, you're good at singing. Please, just one song!

813
00:56:16,050 --> 00:56:19,350
- I won't do it. 
 - Are you really not doing it?

814
00:56:19,350 --> 00:56:21,990
I want to hear you sing.

815
00:56:21,990 --> 00:56:24,790
Han Seo Jun! Han Seo Jun!

816
00:56:24,790 --> 00:56:29,730
Han Seo Jun! Han Seo Jun! Han Seo Jun!

817
00:56:29,730 --> 00:56:33,840
- Do you want to hear it? 
- Of course. Is it perhaps because you're embarrassed?

818
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:35,990
Go on up quickly.

819
00:56:35,990 --> 00:56:40,060
- Then grant me a wish. 
 - You're exactly like Im Ju Yeong.

820
00:56:40,060 --> 00:56:43,690
Okay. If you sing, I'll listen to your wish.

821
00:57:01,210 --> 00:57:05,580
♫ On a night illuminated by stars, you and I are surrounded by that scene. 
  (Song: To You My Light by Maktub) 

822
00:57:05,580 --> 00:57:11,430
♫ Making me new, making me warm

823
00:57:11,430 --> 00:57:15,200
♫ The look in your eyes, your smile

824
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:19,440
♫ I'll hold onto them forever

825
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:24,870
♫ My heart that is full of you, I who am becoming similar to you

826
00:57:24,870 --> 00:57:30,560
♫ A present for me more beautiful than a dream

827
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:34,400
♫ In each other's arms

828
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:38,430
♫ Let's walk the never-ending night

829
00:57:38,430 --> 00:57:43,800
♫ I want to give you all of my days

830
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:48,580
♫ I want to tell you all of these feelings of mine

831
00:57:48,580 --> 00:57:53,390
♫ The blue winds that can't sleep

832
00:57:53,390 --> 00:57:58,440
♫ Brightly light up this night

833
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:03,030
- Im Ju, where are you going? 
 ♫ Living this small, ordinary life together with you

834
00:58:03,030 --> 00:58:07,950
♫ Do you know that this is my greatest happiness?

835
00:58:07,950 --> 00:58:12,690
♫ You become the light in my world

836
00:58:12,690 --> 00:58:19,930
♫ Just the way you are now, by my side

837
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:29,980
Hey, Ju Gyeong!

838
00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:31,720
Ju Gyeong.

839
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:36,600
Here. Can you give this to Su Ho?

840
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:38,450
- Me? 
- Listen well.

841
00:58:38,450 --> 00:58:42,970
If you keep going straight in the southeast direction, you will see Su Ho taking a walk near a creek.

842
00:58:42,970 --> 00:58:47,670
Oh, it seems like I have to go to the bathroom quickly. Sorry.

843
00:58:47,670 --> 00:58:49,180
You have to give me the clothes.

844
00:58:49,180 --> 00:58:50,960
Oh, right.

845
00:59:02,110 --> 00:59:08,100
Su Ho! Su Ho! If you go straight in the southeast— no, northwest direction,

846
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:11,080
Ju Gyeong will be outside near a creek.

847
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:14,070
I hope you will be successful with your confession, friend.

848
00:59:15,690 --> 00:59:17,830
Don't be so touched.

849
00:59:45,140 --> 00:59:47,030
Lee Su Ho.

850
00:59:59,260 --> 01:00:03,230
 Ju Gyeong! Why aren't you coming inside? 

851
01:00:03,230 --> 01:00:06,020
 - It's...
 - By the way, have you seen Lee Su Ho? 

852
01:00:06,020 --> 01:00:07,000
 Lee Su Ho? 

853
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,650
 You still haven't confessed? 

854
01:00:08,650 --> 01:00:11,200
 You should do it by today. 

855
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:15,140
 I saw him going in that direction earlier. 

856
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:18,400
 - Isn't that Lee Su Ho's? 
 - Huh? 

857
01:00:18,890 --> 01:00:21,810
 Oh yeah, Tae Hoon told me to give it to him. 

858
01:00:21,810 --> 01:00:24,700
 Oh, really? Then I will go give it to him. 

859
01:00:29,230 --> 01:00:33,630
 Okay. You can give it to him then. 

860
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:35,880
 That is right. 

861
01:00:36,740 --> 01:00:38,040
 He's near the creek. 

862
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:40,560
 Really? Go back inside and rest. 

863
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:50,110
Im Ju Gyeong.

864
01:00:55,470 --> 01:00:58,480
You can't forget that you owe me a wish.

865
01:01:01,070 --> 01:01:02,900
How was it?

866
01:01:03,490 --> 01:01:05,860
You said you wanted to listen to me sing.

867
01:01:08,390 --> 01:01:11,650
Why? Were you that touched?

868
01:01:11,650 --> 01:01:15,810
Many kids did cry after listening to me sing.

869
01:01:15,810 --> 01:01:18,320
But you shouldn't cry.

870
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:26,350
Hey, what's wrong?

871
01:01:30,850 --> 01:01:32,830
What is this?

872
01:01:32,830 --> 01:01:36,010
What? Ju Gyeong told me to give it to you.

873
01:01:36,010 --> 01:01:38,700
- She gave it to you? 
- Yeah.

874
01:01:40,450 --> 01:01:43,910
You should take your clothes.

875
01:01:47,610 --> 01:01:51,270
You dropped this.

876
01:02:10,090 --> 01:02:12,330
What's wrong?

877
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:15,740
Is it because you're sick?

878
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:19,010
I'm sorry.

879
01:02:19,010 --> 01:02:22,680
Whatever it is, I'm sorry for everything.

880
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:28,310
Why... Why isn't it me for Lee Su Ho?

881
01:02:32,820 --> 01:02:34,650
- I... 
 - Don't talk.

882
01:02:34,650 --> 01:02:36,010
I...

883
01:02:36,010 --> 01:02:37,650
I told you to not say anything!

884
01:02:37,650 --> 01:02:40,970
I like Lee Su Ho.

885
01:02:40,970 --> 01:02:42,880
I told you not to say anything.

886
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:45,880
I thought I would be okay,

887
01:02:47,070 --> 01:02:49,780
but my heart hurts.

888
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:57,680
♫  I'm afraid it will be too much for you  ♫

889
01:02:57,680 --> 01:03:01,860
This is a secret. Okay?

890
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:05,920
 Then you should have kept it a secret from me too. 

891
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:07,900
♫  I am loving you  ♫

892
01:03:07,900 --> 01:03:09,780
Look at me.

893
01:03:13,230 --> 01:03:16,860
You are ugly when you cry.

894
01:03:16,860 --> 01:03:19,030
♫  I just found out  ♫

895
01:03:19,030 --> 01:03:21,710
♫  Fall in you  ♫

896
01:03:22,980 --> 01:03:26,100
♫  I am waiting for you  ♫

897
01:03:26,100 --> 01:03:33,870
♫   Fall in you, you are my destiny   ♫

898
01:03:33,870 --> 01:03:39,400
♫  The one person who will be my star  ♫

899
01:03:40,140 --> 01:03:41,580
It's fine.

900
01:03:41,580 --> 01:03:44,730
My makeup is going to come off.

901
01:03:50,710 --> 01:03:54,020
♫  You  ♫

902
01:04:10,690 --> 01:04:14,110
Why did you have to cry?

903
01:04:14,110 --> 01:04:16,150
The talent show isn't over yet, right?

904
01:04:16,150 --> 01:04:19,070
I need to put on makeup before other kids come.

905
01:04:22,040 --> 01:04:24,310
You said you aren't avoiding me.

906
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:28,300
Did you cry?

907
01:04:28,300 --> 01:04:31,870
Why? Because of Han Seo Jun?

908
01:04:33,300 --> 01:04:35,730
Why are you crying because of that bastard?

909
01:04:36,490 --> 01:04:38,700
Do you like him?

910
01:04:40,040 --> 01:04:42,530
- What? 
- Do you like Han Seo Jun?

911
01:04:42,530 --> 01:04:45,240
- Why do you care? 
- Answer me.

912
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:47,390
Why are you like this?

913
01:04:47,390 --> 01:04:51,520
Why are you curious whether I cry or like someone?

914
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:56,160
If you already have someone you like, why are you making me confused like this?

915
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:57,680
What do you mean?

916
01:04:57,680 --> 01:05:00,580
You like Su Jin!

917
01:05:00,580 --> 01:05:04,110
Then why are you so nice to me and make my heart flutter—

918
01:05:07,780 --> 01:05:11,720
Im Ju Gyeong, I think you are misunderstanding something.

919
01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:13,440
 The problem isn't me, but— 

920
01:05:13,450 --> 01:05:16,550
 - When you pushed it that way— 
 - I know, right? 

921
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:18,800
  I'm not wearing any makeup! 

922
01:05:27,070 --> 01:05:28,160
The ugly-faced ghost!

923
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:30,450
It's the ugly-faced ghost!

924
01:05:30,450 --> 01:05:32,820
- Ghost, ghost, ghost! 
 - You're now dead!

925
01:05:32,820 --> 01:05:37,010
- Catch the ugly-faced ghost! 
 - Catch it!

926
01:05:37,010 --> 01:05:38,870
Take me with you!

927
01:05:38,870 --> 01:05:40,740
Catch her!

928
01:05:45,110 --> 01:05:47,330
Catch the ghost!

929
01:05:55,860 --> 01:05:59,520
Why are they following me? What should I do?

930
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:22,980
Over here, over here!

931
01:06:22,980 --> 01:06:25,940
- Just wait until you're caught! 
 - Go down there!

932
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:28,180
Catch her! Catch the ghost!

933
01:06:28,180 --> 01:06:30,780
Catch her!

934
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:35,670
There it is!

935
01:06:40,180 --> 01:06:42,610
I don't like Kang Su Jin.

936
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:45,750
The person I like...

937
01:06:45,750 --> 01:06:48,460
It's over there!

938
01:06:48,460 --> 01:06:50,050
It's you.

939
01:07:02,750 --> 01:07:09,830
♫  I'm missing you, waiting for you  ♫

940
01:07:09,830 --> 01:07:17,230
♫  My heart is facing towards you  ♫

941
01:07:17,230 --> 01:07:24,840
♫  I'm missing you, waiting for you   ♫

942
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:32,170
♫   Today, I wait for you again  ♫

943
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:40,200
♫  You always protected me by my side   ♫

944
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:46,460
♫   I don't want to let you go. Really.  ♫

945
01:07:46,460 --> 01:07:53,650
♫  I'm missing you, waiting for you   ♫

946
01:07:53,650 --> 01:08:01,040
♫   My heart is facing towards you   ♫

947
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:07,500
♫   I'm missing you, waiting for you   ♫

948
01:08:08,510 --> 01:08:15,710
♫  Today, I wait for you again   ♫

949
01:08:16,700 --> 01:08:23,720
    


950
01:08:24,990 --> 01:08:30,100
 So the person who knows to not judge a book by its cover was right here.  

951
01:08:30,980 --> 01:08:34,850
♫  Call me maybe you  ♫

952
01:08:34,850 --> 01:08:36,660
  There's no one from our school nearby, right? 

953
01:08:36,660 --> 01:08:37,750
  Get down! 

954
01:08:37,750 --> 01:08:39,240
  Do we have to go this far? 

955
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:41,410
  I'm a bit embarrassed. 

956
01:08:41,410 --> 01:08:42,850
  Why do you want to work part-time? 

957
01:08:42,850 --> 01:08:44,940
  I want to save money for makeup school. 

958
01:08:44,940 --> 01:08:46,970
  Do you want me to find you a part-time job? 

959
01:08:46,970 --> 01:08:48,100
  I'm so bad at this. 

960
01:08:48,100 --> 01:08:51,550
  No, you are far worst than I ever imagined. 

961
01:08:51,550 --> 01:08:56,010
  I brought you here because I have something to show you. 

962
01:08:56,010 --> 01:08:58,320
  I like Lee Su Ho. 

963
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:02,590
 Im Ju Gyeong, let's break up. 

964
01:09:02,590 --> 01:09:07,290
♫  Call me maybe you  ♫

965
01:09:07,290 --> 01:09:09,020
♫  Call me  ♫
