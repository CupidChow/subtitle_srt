 True Beauty

00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,580
 Episode 15 

4
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,940
I am here.

5
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,970
Dad.

6
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:21,000
Oh!

7
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:25,010
I'm sorry.

8
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:29,500
I'm sorry, Su Ho.

9
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:33,760
I was worried I wouldn't have been able to

10
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:38,160
say these words to you.

11
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:41,570
It's okay.

12
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:18,970
Dad, you should have your breakfast.

13
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,690
Here.

14
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:32,530
I was going to

15
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:36,040
buy you a delicious meal.

16
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:40,270
Buy it for me when you are all better.

17
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:47,440
Something delicious.

18
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:02,740
 Boarding pass to Incheon airport for Lee Su Ho
 Republic of Korea passport 

19
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,800
 Girlfriend♡ 

20
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:08,600
Did you not sleep? Isn't it early morning there?

21
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,910
I was studying. I am a senior now.

22
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,980
- Are you at the airport? 
 - Not yet.

23
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:17,350
I'm going to head straight to the airport after I see my dad get discharged from the hospital.

24
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:18,940
Are you coming back with your dad?

25
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:21,670
No. I'll be coming first.

26
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:23,660
It's still too difficult for him to travel long distances,

27
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:26,000
so he'll come back after resting more.

28
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,260
Oh, is that so?

29
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:32,270
We are going to see each other after a month.

30
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:34,130
Right.

31
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:36,940
I miss you.

32
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,110
I'll come and wait at the airport.

33
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:41,890
No. I'll come as soon as I reach there.

34
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:43,200
Don't come out.

35
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,960
No, see you tomo—

36
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,620
- I mean, see you later. 
 - Okay.

37
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:17,160
 Operating room 

38
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,170
Dad!

39
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:23,360
Dad! Dad! Dad!

40
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,600
There was secondary bleeding in his brain, so I had to perform an emergency surgery.

41
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,790
The location of the bleeding isn't as ideal as it was the last time,

42
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:34,740
but we are doing our best.

43
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:56,390
 Operating room 

44
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:59,060
Your father had a cardiac arrest during the operation.

45
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:01,160
Fortunately, his life was never at risk.

46
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:05,580
His vitals are stable, but his condition is still serious.

47
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:08,060
 Arrivals 

48
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,290
- Hey, God Tae Hoon. 
 - Hey, God Hyeon Gyu.

49
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:05,960
- Looking forward to working with you. 
 - Me too.

50
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:08,130
You thought well. Oh! Ju Gyeong!

51
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:09,720
Ju Gyeong, are you also in the same class?

52
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,520
- This is such a familiar scene. 
 - I know, right?

53
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,180
Take good care of us this year too.

54
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:15,490
One, two, three, fighting!

55
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:18,450
- Hello, I'm Yoo Tae Hoon! 
 - I'm Ahn Hyeon Gyu!

56
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:19,950
Im Ju!

57
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,320
- You're here. 
 - Yup.

58
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:31,010
Ju Gyeong, Su Jin dropped out of the school during the winter break.

59
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:34,050
What? Really?

60
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:36,580
There were some rumors that she went abroad.

61
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:40,120
But are you okay?

62
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,950
You haven't heard when Lee Su Ho is coming back?

63
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:46,140
No. Not yet.

64
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:55,870
Why is it so cold?

65
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:08,670
 How is your dad? 

66
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:10,210
 He's the same. 

67
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:12,360
 Did you get some sleep? 

68
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:54,480
Ju Gyeong, are you not going to sch—

69
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:58,140
Ju Gyeong! What happened?

70
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:00,490
Oh my! Look at you sweating. Are you sick?

71
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:02,550
- My stomach! 
 - Your stomach?

72
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:05,330
My god! What to do?

73
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:09,150
My God! Does it hurt a lot?

74
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:24,490
 Girlfriend♡ 

75
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,450
 ♡ Boyfriend ♡ 

76
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:37,200
- Su Ho?  
   - How are you? 

77
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,590
How are you?

78
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:41,430
I was...

79
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:43,780
but where is Ju Gyeong?

80
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:46,800
Ju Gyeong is sick, so we are at the hospital now.

81
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,900
Sick? What happened?

82
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:52,260
Don't be shocked. It's not a big deal. She just has a stomachache.

83
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:55,300
She must have had a hard time studying and what not as she is now a senior.

84
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:58,500
Can you put Ju Gyeong on the phone?

85
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:02,090
What can I do? She fell asleep.

86
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:06,040
 But how is your dad? 

87
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,330
Still not much improved.

88
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:12,300
You are also having a hard time alone there.

89
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:15,170
I'll ask Ju Gyeong to call you once she wakes up.

90
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:17,980
Okay.

91
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,420
Su Ho.

92
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:47,590
It think it's been a while since we talked on the phone.

93
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:50,350
Yes. Anything new in your life?

94
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:52,770
Of course there's nothing new— Ah!

95
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:57,860
I have a news. I got my National Technical Skill Certificate!

96
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:02,370
- Good job. 
 - Right?

97
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:06,200
- Ju Gyeong. 
 - Huh?

98
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,740
Let's

99
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:12,990
break up.

100
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,130
What?

101
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:18,780
I don't even know when my dad will wake up, so waiting for me,

102
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:21,870
honestly, is hard for you too, right?

103
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:28,140
What are you saying?

104
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:33,980
I am not having a hard time.

105
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:37,980
I can wait. It's okay.

106
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:40,350
I feel sorry towards you.

107
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:44,000
I am not even able to be with you.

108
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:47,690
I feel sorry about that.

109
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:50,160
So...

110
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,100
Did someone ask you to be sorry?

111
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:56,000
I'm saying I'm fine. Why are you doing this?

112
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:02,910
I don't want to break up.

113
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,580
It's fine even if you have to stay there forever.

114
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:07,860
It'll be okay if I save money and come and visit you from time to time.

115
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:12,040
How can we do that?

116
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,890
 Why can't we? 

117
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:21,680
Go to school properly.

118
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,470
Don't wait for my calls anymore

119
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:27,700
and sleep well.

120
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:31,200
Don't do this. Don't!

121
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,800
Don't talk as if this is the last time.

122
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:38,610
 I didn't hear this. 

123
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:41,830
I didn't get this call today.

124
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,740
Ahjussi!

125
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,120
You're here, Ju Bal?

126
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,830
Why are you throwing the chair away?

127
00:12:56,830 --> 00:13:00,410
It's become too old, so I'm changing it.

128
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,640
Come in.

129
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:53,440
  Ta da! 

130
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:58,180
  I bought these with my paychecks from working part-time. It's a couple item for us. 

131
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:03,600
 Isn't it cute? 

132
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:31,030
 I'm not a cry baby. I'm Lee Su Ho. 

133
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:35,490
  When will you remember who I am? 

134
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:41,800
  When the first snow falls, I should go make a wish at Namsan Peak. 

135
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,870
  A wish for you to remember who I am. 

136
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:47,000
What's this?

137
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:53,250
You should have told me.

138
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:55,920
How was I supposed to know?

139
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:28,330
  Hey, did you hear that your wishes will come true if the first snowfall falls on you? 

140
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:31,360
  Then that means that everyone who gets snowed on should be happy. 

141
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,030
  But why are there so many unhappy people? 

142
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:35,610
  My dad is still unemployed. 

143
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:37,290
  It's fascinating that you believe in that stuff.  

144
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:39,820
  People wouldn't say that expression for no reason! 

145
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,790
  I thought about it over and over, 

146
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:47,520
  and I think that only the person who feels the very first snowflake has his or her wishes granted. What do you think? 

147
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,600
  That makes no sense. 

148
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,720
  So this year, when the first snow falls, I'm going to go to the highest place, 

149
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,570
  and I'm going to be the first one to get touched by the first snow flake!  

150
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:58,390
  The highest place? Like an airplane? 

151
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:00,740
 - I'm going to Namsan Peak. 
 - What? 

152
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:03,310
  Namsan Peak is the highest place in Seoul. 

153
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:04,880
  Sure, whatever you say. 

154
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:09,770
  Wait and see. You'll know I'm right when my wish comes true. 

155
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:22,180
 I'm not a cry baby. I'm Lee Su Ho. 

156
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:24,650
 When will you remember who I am? 

157
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,810
 When the first snow falls, I should go make a wish at Namsan Peak. 

158
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:29,000
 A wish for you to remember who I am.  

159
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:35,730
How can you remember all of those conversations?

160
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:39,030
 When the first snow falls, I should go make a wish at Namsan Peak. 

161
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:43,150
 A wish for you to remember who I am. 

162
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:47,630
Your memory is so good.

163

00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:11,340
I'm totally screwed.

  2021 College Entrance Exam 
 Seoul Metropolitan City 13th Testing Zone, 17th Testing Site  

167
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:46,260
 I took the college entrance exam today.  

168
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,330
  As long as I do well on the practical exam, 

169
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:52,760
 I think I'll be able to go to my dream university. 

170
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:57,740
  I guess this is what it feels like to have my dreams coming true. 

171
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:00,290
  It gives me butterflies, and I like it. 

172
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:06,490
  I wonder if you have started studying music there. 

173
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:11,260
 Someday... somewhere. 

174
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:15,420
  I'll be happy to hear the music that you've made. 

175
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:23,760
  All this time, I kept sending you messages with the excuse that I'm having a hard time. 

176
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:28,270
  But now that the exam is over, I can't use that excuse anymore. 

177
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:34,120
 Su Ho, it's snowing here. 

178
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:41,860
  I hope that wherever you are, you feel warm instead of cold.  

179
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:52,030
 I'll... stop contacting you from now on.  

180
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:57,280
  Goodbye. 

181
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:05,470
Miss Chae Ni, smile.

182
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:08,060
- She's so pretty! 
 - The lighting is great.

183
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:10,050
Chae Ni, try moving your hair like this!

184
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:11,560
It looks so pretty, Chae Ni.

185
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,510
So nice!

186
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:16,500
Please touch up her hair.

187
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:22,890
Over here.

188
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,420
- Gargle. 
 - Yes!

189
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:35,710
Mist.

190
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,950
- I'll spray it. 
 - Okay.

191
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:49,320
Right, Unni. When will you set me up with Oppa Seo Jun?

192
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:56,090
He's a trainee right now, so he's not really in the right place to be meeting people, he says.

193
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:58,340
You probably see him around at the company more than I see him.

194
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:01,150
No, I can give him a hint only once or twice.

195
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:03,740
Why do I have to keep making the first move? It hurts my pride.

196
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:08,300
I heard that you're really close friends with him. Please arrange for me meet him alone, okay?

197
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,840
Since we're on that topic, why don't you ask him right now? Please.

198
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,860
- R-right now? 
 - Yes! Please~

199
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:19,020
- Please! Just this once. 
 - Okay, one second.

200
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,190
    She's twisting my arm every time I see her! 

201
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:26,160
    Just meet her once, huh? I'll treat you to Korean barbecue! 

202
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,580
    No no, it's annoying. 

203
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:30,720
   Just keep your eyes shut and eat a meal with her! 

204
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,810
Unni! What did Oppa Seo Jun say?

205
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:41,000
Oh, maybe he's a l-little busy right now. He's not answering.

206
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:49,000
   No. Her type is the absolute worst. 

207
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:52,410
- Oh no! 
 - What's wrong? Oh, what do we do!

208
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:54,690
This is sponsored clothing from the designer brand!

209
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:56,830
- You should've been more careful. 
 - No, it was—

210
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:58,620
I know right!

211
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:01,360
I told you to be careful not to spill anything on the clothing!

212
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,930
Ugh, seriously, what do I do?

213
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:06,070
I apologize, I apologize.

214
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:10,950
Unni, what are you going to do? Even if you saved your part-time paycheck for a year, you wouldn't be able to pay this back.

215
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:15,920
It's not coming out. What do we do?

216
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:21,170
Unni, try to persuade Oppa Seo Jun, okay?

217
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:23,350
It's okay! It's okay, everyone.

218
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:25,710
I'll speak with my agency about it and sort things out nicely.

219
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:27,990
So just get me a change of clothes because this feels sticky and gross~

220
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:30,040
- Thanks! 
 - You're an angel. An angel!

221
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,560
Don't scold her too much!

222
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,870
- Oh, so gross~ 
 - You're so kind, kind.

223
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:37,490
Thanks.

224
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:43,850
Cheers!

225
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:46,800
Saebom High, forever!

226
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,530
If she likes him, she should charm him herself.

227
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:52,550
Why is she bugging me to death?!

228
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:55,630
I heard her personality is total bullshit, so her staff changes on a monthly basis.

229
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:59,900
If only Han Seo Jun would close his eyes and go out with her once, your life as the staff newbie would get easier.

230
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,290
He can't even do that for you?

231
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:05,200
He said he doesn't want to. It would be too much for me to force him against his will.

232
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,360
But it's so exhausting for me.

233
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:11,260
Hey, hey, Yoo Tae Hoon. Why did you gather us all today?

234
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:13,800
I had plans to go see a movie with my Min-nie.

235
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:17,020
Isn't that right, Darling?

236
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:18,390
Isn't that right, Darling?

237
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:20,340
Oh, Babe~

238
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,800
You're rubbing salt in the wound for us single people.

239
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,560
Why? I thought you said you were flirting with someone. Did you get rejected again?

240
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,240
R-Rejected?!

241
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,130
What? Are you happy to see me as a single man?

242
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:30,180
First you lied, and now you're dwelling on your past with me?

243
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:33,650
What the hell? In your dreams!

244
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:41,160
Alright! The reason why I gathered you all here today is... I have an important announcement.

245
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:44,920
What is it? What?

246
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:48,490
- I! 
 - What's he doing?

247
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:50,530
I'm going to enlist in the military with Ahn Hyeon Gyu next month.

248
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:53,880
- What?! 
 - When?

249
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:58,730
Hyeon Gyu and I agreed to enlist together on good terms, so I hope you'll support us.

250
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:02,330
- Salute! 
 - Salute!

251
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:06,050
I'm sorry, dude. I didn't register to enlist.

252
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:07,890
What?

253
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:10,860
- I have a girlfriend. 
 - What? No way!

254
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:14,760
Recently, one woman has claimed a spot in my heart

255
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,000
Regardless, I can't enlist. Just keep that in mind.

256
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,270
I'm so speechless right now. What the!

257
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:23,970
We agreed to enlist together, you little back-stabbing bastard!

258
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,290
As soon as I finally escape from being forever alone,

259
00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:31,560
- how can I make my girlfriend wait alone now?  
 - Wait alone, my ass! I knew from the moment you walked in with that haircut!

260
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,970
Bring me some scissors!

261
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:35,530
Stop it, Yoo Tae Hoon!

262
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:38,120
Hey, hey, hey, stop it! Stop.

263
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:41,300
Ugh, seriously. How could you guys enlist together while fighting like this?

264
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:44,440
Let's toast! Cheers!

265
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,600
Quit everything!

266
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:50,390
Let's just quit everything.

267
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,130
Ju Gyeong passed out.

268
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:55,690
Hey, Im Ju! Did you fall asleep? Im Ju!

269
00:23:55,690 --> 00:23:57,120
Is he on his way?

270
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,320
This guy needs to hurry over and take care of her. Where is he?

271
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,670
Oh, he's here! Over here! Here!

272
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:09,830
Hey, hey. Who let Ju Gyeong drink this much?

273
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:13,970
She drank it herself. It's not like we fed her!

274
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:18,410
Ju Gyeong. Im Ju Gyeong! I'm here.

275
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:21,030
Wake up.

276
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:28,180
-  Are you here? 
 - Yeah.

277
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:48,600
- Seo Jun. 
 - Yeah?

278
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:55,960
You're dead! It's your fault that I'm suffering with Chae Ni!

279
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,110
Hey, don't be like that!

280
00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:01,080
Hey, you're going to destroy our beer here!

281
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:04,040
You're dead, for real.

282
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:06,430
Who goes there!

283
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:10,140
- Who goes there! 
 - What a mess.

284
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:15,000
Knock knock. Knock knock. Make sure they get home alright.

285
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
- She's wasted! 
 - You guys are, too!

286
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,230
Hey, you. Dino.

287
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:24,140
- Im Ju Gyeong. 
 - You're adorable!

288
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:27,770
Hey guys, I'm going to take her back home. You guys go have round two amongst yourselves.

289
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:30,830
Bye!

290
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:32,790
Where should we go next?

291
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:34,440
Hey, you might as well get on my back.

292
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:37,240
No, I'm not drunk. I can walk!

293
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,960
Okay, okay. Just come this way.

294
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:44,090
- I'm going, right? I'm going. 
 - Just get on.

295
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:45,830
Get on.

296
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:48,510
Oh, you octopus! Octopus!

297
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:50,990
Come with me to the beach!

298
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:52,690
- Come with me to the beach! 
 - Hey, hey!

299
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:54,360
I'll let you escape from the tank!

300
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:57,000
What are you doing right now? Playing with food.

301
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,670
Taxi! Taxi!

302
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:04,040
Please take me home.

303
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:07,270
- Let's go home. 
 - Miss, what are you doing right now?

304
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:11,440
I'm sorry, sir! Come on Ju Gyeong, let's go!

305
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:15,490
- Let's go home! 
 - Alright, get on.

306
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:18,600
Hey, I feel kind of nauseous!

307
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:22,790
Have you sobered up a bit?

308
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:26,490
Of course not. You wouldn't have done those things if you were sober.

309
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:28,790
You lifted up that raw octopus and just—

310
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:35,190
Why did you pick me up and run around? It makes me nauseous.

311
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:38,290
- Then just throw up or something. 
 - No, the food I ate is too precious.

312
00:26:38,290 --> 00:26:40,030
I'm going to digest every last bite.

313
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:44,080
I'll feel better after I sit for a while. It'll be okay.

314
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:47,700
It's okay. I'm okay.

315
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:50,260
Seo Jun.

316
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:55,160
Han Seo Jun!

317
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:58,920
What? Why?

318
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:02,550
Meet Chae Ni just once please.

319
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:04,150
I told you I don't want to.

320
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:06,980
Can't you help me out and make my life easier at work?

321
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:09,300
Just have one meal with her. One meal.

322
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,830
Can you meet a person whom you don't even like?

323
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:13,590
I didn't ask you to date her.

324
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:17,330
- Stop it! 
 - Meet her just once.

325
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:20,870
Don't keep telling me to meet other women.

326
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:22,950
It hurts.

327
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:26,450
- Why?
 - What? Why?

328
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:30,860
By now, isn't it time that you notice my feelings?

329
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:53,380
Ow my head!

330
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:08,810
Hey, Im Ju Yeong! Give me water.

331
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:14,010
- Drink less. You are worse than elder sister. 
 - What did you say?

332
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:16,050
Where are you kicking me?

333
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:19,330
You... you slept at our home?

334
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:22,740
He was sweating bullets after carrying you home in the middle of the night. How could I just send him off?

335
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:25,790
I'm embarrassed to even look at Seo Jun's face.

336
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:30,530
Is that so?  I don't remember anything from the bar.

337
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,560
I totally blacked out. Completely.

338
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:37,060
Are you proud of it?

339
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:38,890
I heard you're debuting soon, Seo Jun.

340
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:41,330
The concept is out, and we are selecting the title song.

341
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:42,940
Wow! Daebak!

342
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:45,220
Hyung, give that back without washing it later.

343
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:47,700
Once you make it big, I can say "These are clothes worn by Han Seo Jun,"

344
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:52,010
and sell it for a ton of money.

345
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:57,370
But Seo Jun, if you become a famous top star, won't it be difficult to see you in person?

346
00:28:57,370 --> 00:28:59,370
I'll come over all the time.

347
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:01,330
To see Ju Gyeong?

348
00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:06,980
No. To eat the food you make, Ahjussi.

349
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:10,600
How is it more tasty than what my mom makes?

350
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:14,940
I was always good at everything except studies. Shall I pack some for you to take home?

351
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:16,620
"Some"?

352
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:19,110
Pack a lot for me. A lot.

353
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:22,120
Yes, eat a lot. I'll pack a lot for you.

354
00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:34,540
Dad said to take this to your dorm and eat well. Good luck with your training. Bye.

355
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:36,390
Hey, Im Ju Gyeong!

356
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:41,870
About yesterday.

357
00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:44,670
What about yesterday?

358
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:47,780
You really don't remember what happened after you left the bar?

359
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:51,340
I don't remember. Did I make a scene or something like that?

360
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:52,580
You really don't remember?

361
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:54,880
Of course. Why would I lie to you?

362
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,440
Will you keep pretending not to remember?

363
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:59,140
Pretend? I really don't remember.

364
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:01,130
We kissed.

365
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:22,700
 Let's go. 

366
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:27,960
 Get on my back. 

367
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:36,540
 Let's go. Let's go home. 

368
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:39,760
 Madam Hong is waiting. 

369
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,490
 Let's go. 

370
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:45,710
Hey! We didn't kiss!

371
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:48,840
You said you don't remember anything, so how do you know that?

372
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,190
Huh?

373
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:55,710
You remember. That's why you were overreacting and walking on egg shells around me since morning.

374
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:58,080
I've known you for years.

375
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:02,130
Then what am I supposed to do? So what if I remember?

376
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:05,250
It only makes us awkward. You must have been confused and drunk and—

377
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:07,350
I wasn't confused.

378
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:10,500
And moreover not because I was drunk.

379
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:15,550
Yes. I was going to tell you someday but not in an absurd way like yesterday.

380
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:18,960
But I had to because I got so angry when you kept talking about Chae Ni...

381
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,010
What is the point here now?  Fine.

382
00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:23,260
Better forget it. Forget it.

383
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:28,040
Forget everything and wait. I'm going to confess properly.

384
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:53,780
What? Han Seo Jun? Me?

385
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:58,730
Is it a prank?

386
00:31:58,730 --> 00:32:00,850
Is it April fool's day?

387
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:02,590
No, it isn't.

388
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:08,660
Then why?

389
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:11,730
Since when?

390
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:27,310
What should I do?

391
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:31,660
So the confession that you held in for two years came out in a rush,

392
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:34,090
in front of her house when you were holding that packed kimchi

393
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:37,190
and at 8 AM while looking like that?

394
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:38,910
It wasn't a confession.

395
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:42,110
If we had to call it something, then a preview of the confession?

396
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:43,490
Teaser for the confession? Or something like that?

397
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:46,070
Confession teaser? B*llshit!

398
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:48,690
Hey! Don't cry.

399
00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:52,690
I'm losing muscle mass right now, so I can't cry with you.

400
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:56,510
But I think it is good this way.

401
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:58,980
If you hadn't told it in a rush, then because of Lee Su Ho—

402
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:02,940
Anyhow, you wouldn't have confessed, right?

403
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:04,960
Good job. Good job.

404
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:10,200
Since it went this way anyway...

405
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,110
Let's go on with it.

406
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:13,710
How can I confess in a cool way?

407
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:15,840
You don't even watch dramas?

408
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:19,220
Don't you see how the male leads in the dramas always rent an amusement park,

409
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:21,650
fly a helicopter on the rooftop,

410
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:25,550
or borrow a cruise ship and set off fireworks in the sky like boom, boom, boom!

411
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:28,860
Am I that rich? Where do I get that much money?

412
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:31,730
Right? Right.

413
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:34,840
Then let's make it work with your face.

414
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:37,160
No matter what it is, if you do it, it will surely be cool.

415
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:41,860
Look at me, have a romantic gaze and

416
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:45,260
"If you drink this, we are dating."

417
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:50,000
You fell for me. You fell for me, didn't you? Try it.

418
00:33:52,850 --> 00:33:54,820
Will you date me?

419
00:33:57,010 --> 00:34:02,500
My heart just skipped a beat. My heart is fluttering! Fluttering!

420
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:07,220
- Hey, just do it this way, and she can never say no. 
 - Really?

421
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:12,050
Will you date me?

422
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,610
Let's date. Let me date you!

423
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:19,430
Don't. Don't do that. My heart flutters.

424
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:21,050
Don't do this either.

425
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:23,590
 Certificate for Professional Aromatherapist - Im Jae Pil 

426
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,920
Hello.

427
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:30,630
Nice to meet you. I am Im Jae Soon.

428
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:35,440
Hello. I am Wang Ja of Prince Comics.

429
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,150
I love you.

430
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:40,180
You surprised me! How can you be so straightforward?

431
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:43,010
Let's change roles. You do the female role.

432
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:45,370
Hello. Nice to meet you.

433
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:47,010
Yes. Nice to meet you.

434
00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:49,260
But you really...

435
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:51,180
What will I do if you are here?

436
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:55,610
- Then where should I? 
 - A flower is supposed to be in a flower garden.

437
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:56,960
What are you doing?

438
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,410
We are practicing because Wang Ja is going on a blind date tomorrow.

439
00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:03,900
Really? It should go well so that you can also get married next year.

440
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:05,210
Only if someone is willing to.

441
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:09,950
There is. There will be someone somewhere. Search well. Look at our Hui Gyeong.

442
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:14,900
This girl was so stubborn that she wouldn't get married, but she found herself a partner and is getting married soon.

443
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:16,720
One minute.

444
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:20,360
Hyungnim! What's wrong with him?

445
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:25,050
Nowadays, if we talk about Hui Gyeong's marriage, he tears up like that.

446
00:35:25,050 --> 00:35:28,540
I think Hyungnim is very upset.

447
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:31,960
Oh right! Isn't it the day Ju Yeong's college entrance results come out?

448
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:35,510
Right. Ju Yeong will pass with flying colors.

449
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:37,230
Become smaller! 
  (Referring to the face) 

450
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:40,010
 Successful Candidates for Freshmen for 2022 

451
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:44,140
- Shall we check at the same time? 
- No.

452
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:46,490
- Rock, paper, scissors. 
 - Rock, paper, scissors. Nice!

453
00:35:46,490 --> 00:35:49,320
Yours first!

454
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:53,550
- Did I pass? 
 - Wow!

455
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:55,620
Why? Did I fail?

456
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:58,120
- Pass! 
 - Really?

457
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:05,450
Hey, Im Ju Yeong! Let's date.

458
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:13,480
Now we should check yours.

459
00:36:14,530 --> 00:36:17,100
What? You failed.

460
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:20,450
Ah! I'm cancelling what I said just now.

461
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:30,630
What's up with them? I thought they were close friends. When did they become like that—

462
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:33,850
 By now, isn't it time that you notice my feelings? 

463
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:48,470
 Let's have dinner together tomorrow. Don't think of avoiding me, and meet me tomorrow. 

464
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:52,550
 Forget everything and wait. I'm going to confess properly. 

465
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:03,440
Point brush!

466
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,490
Sorry.

467
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:09,550
- One minute. 
 - Move.

468
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:13,240
Won't you focus?

469
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:16,100
I don't need an assistant, so go and wait there.

470
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,810
Sorry.

471
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:23,090
You're getting on my nerves, so go and wait there.

472
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:28,960
 You should have done well.   

473
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:34,730
Would you please sign for a donation for the children in Africa? Thank you.

474

Would you please sign for a donation? Thank you.

475
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:38,420
Would you please sign for a donation? Thank you.

476
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:42,100
- See you tomorrow. 
- You've worked hard today. Go home safely.

477
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,200
Ju Gyeong!

478
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:50,140
Are you alright?

479
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:55,010
Sorry. Sorry.

480
00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:07,130
♫ All those hard days and everything

481
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:12,040
♫ Pour down like snow falling

482
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:15,990
- What's wrong with him? 
 - ♫ Just one tie called fate...

483
00:38:15,990 --> 00:38:18,190
-  Are you having a fling? 
 - He is!

484
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:20,830
- He's waiting for a girl to contact him.  
 - No!

485
00:38:20,830 --> 00:38:24,530
- Oh! 
 - See? I was right!

486
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:26,770
 Okay. 

487
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:32,290
 Then let's meet as soon as you finish your work.   

488
00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:41,570
See you tomorrow.

489
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:59,030
Such a beautiful goddess will become my wife.

490
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:02,450
You're starting again! Is it okay if I don't wear this?

491
00:39:02,450 --> 00:39:06,600
It feels a little tight. Can I request a more loose-fitting one? I think I'm done trying things on...

492
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:10,500
Hui Gyeong, try more. They said we can try three dresses before making our choice.

493
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:12,710
How about the bell line dress we saw earlier?

494
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,230
I think it will suit you well.

495
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:18,240
It is important that we are getting married. Is the dress important?

496
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:22,190
The bride has a cool personality.

497
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:25,010
Then how about selecting the bridegroom's tuxedo first?

498
00:39:25,010 --> 00:39:26,550
Yes.

499
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:38,940
Hui Gyeong.

500
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:48,040
- How do I look?  
 - You look cool. You should choose that one.

501
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:50,960
But wasn't the first one I tried on better?

502
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:55,610
The first one? They seem similar. The tuxedos are all the same.

503
00:39:55,610 --> 00:39:59,820
What do you mean it's the same? The first one had a notched lapel with a vest in black.

504
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:03,970
This one has a deep-navy shawl lapel with a cummerbund.

505
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:08,200
The one earlier had a straight point collar, and this one has a rounded collar.

506
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:12,960
Depending on the angle of the collar, a person can look sharp or soft. Do you know how much it can change the appearance?

507
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:17,160
Do you know how important it is for a groom to make a good impression at the wedding hall? People can say the bride chose the wrong groom...

508
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:20,900
You are already so handsome that I can't even notice the clothes.

509
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:23,070
Are you going to be like that?

510
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:26,420
Okay, try the next one. I will look at it carefully this time.

511
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:28,320
Try on the next one.

512
00:40:31,310 --> 00:40:35,820
- Wow.  
 - How do I look?

513
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:39,920
Now it feels like he found his own clothes. He is shining!

514
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:43,570
Is that so? It's the same one I was wearing earlier.

515
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:49,390
- I didn't change my outfit. 
 - What? You are lying.

516
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:51,980
I think I'm done with trying on clothes for the day.

517
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:58,670
Darling ... Jun Woo, Jun Woo ... Darling ... Jun Woo!

518
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,420
Are you upset?

519
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:06,930
No. Why would I be? I guess I'm marrying alone.

520
00:41:06,930 --> 00:41:09,800
How can you get married alone?

521
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,750
You are doing it with me.

522
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:15,050
It seems like I'm the only one who is excited.

523
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:20,010
Okay, okay. I'm sorry for everything.

524
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:22,110
What are you sorry for?

525
00:41:23,450 --> 00:41:27,380
That... Just everything.

526
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:31,570
When you think of why you are sorry, then call me.

527
00:41:31,610 --> 00:41:35,190
Jun Woo ... Hey, Han Jun Woo!

528
00:41:41,310 --> 00:41:47,340
Seriously, how am I going to make him less angry this time?

529
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:07,630
Mist.

530
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:15,500
I can't walk because my feet hurt.

531
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,430
Wait a moment.

532
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,370
Here.

533
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:34,890
- You can go pick it up, Unni. 
 -  Chae Ni, that is a bit...

534
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:44,980
Han Seo Jun!

535
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:49,080
It's Oppa Seo Jun! Oppa!

536
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:55,420
How did you know I got first in the music chart and brought me flowers?

537
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:58,030
Here you go.

538
00:43:03,930 --> 00:43:06,570
Hey, do you not have hands?

539
00:43:06,570 --> 00:43:09,510
Me? Hands?

540
00:43:09,510 --> 00:43:11,630
Here it is.

541
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:17,890
Then pick it up yourself with your own hands.

542
00:43:18,790 --> 00:43:20,030
- Noona. 
 - Yeah?

543
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:21,660
If her schedule is over, Im Ju Gyeong is done for today, right?

544
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:24,620
Yeah, we are getting off work after dropping off her things. You should get off work, Ju Gyeong.

545
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:27,290
No, I will drop it off at her house first and then leave—

546
00:43:27,290 --> 00:43:30,100
- Then we will leave now. 
 - Okay, bye.

547
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:35,380
Hey... I'm sorry, but I'm leaving first! I will see you tomorrow!

548
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:40,900
What is this, seriously?

549
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:58,390
- Why are you standing? 
 - Huh? It's nothing.

550
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:05,070
Is this somewhere I can come to while looking like this?

551
00:44:05,090 --> 00:44:06,860
You look pretty.

552
00:44:13,830 --> 00:44:16,730
You are holding it upside-down.

553
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:30,560
- How is it? 
 - Huh?

554
00:44:31,910 --> 00:44:36,170
Oh it's delicious. The atmosphere is nice too.

555
00:44:36,170 --> 00:44:41,230
- Are you nervous? 
 - Huh? Why would I be nervous?

556
00:44:43,630 --> 00:44:45,670
I am nervous.

557
00:44:47,290 --> 00:44:50,320
After laying everything out in the open yesterday,

558
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:54,950
I was debating on how I should confess so that I'd look cool.

559
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:59,740
I don't want to make a big deal of it like in dramas or movies.

560
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:04,040
There must be a reason why other people come here.

561
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:07,830
I will just tell you honestly.

562
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:13,660
I like you, Im Ju Gyeong.

563
00:45:21,490 --> 00:45:23,720
Seo Jun, I...

564
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:26,070
I have liked you for a long time.

565
00:45:27,610 --> 00:45:30,670
As I knew your feelings back then,

566
00:45:30,670 --> 00:45:35,730
I couldn't confess or give up. I've been hovering around you for three years.

567
00:45:37,220 --> 00:45:40,050
But I can't hold back my feelings any longer.

568
00:45:40,050 --> 00:45:43,370
My feeling keeps coming out like last night, so

569
00:45:43,370 --> 00:45:47,820
- I can't hide it. I can't do that.  
 - Seo Jun...

570
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:53,590
I am holding on to you, asking you to see me as a man right now.

571
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:59,410
I want you to be shaken, just once.

572
00:46:01,470 --> 00:46:04,230
I'm not asking you to answer me right now.

573
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:12,460
Just three times. Let's go on date, as a man and a woman.

574
00:46:24,610 --> 00:46:28,210
- Why are you like this? 
 - It's nothing.

575
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:31,480
Hey, what's wrong?

576
00:46:33,710 --> 00:46:35,380
Is your stomach upset?

577
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:42,210
- Here.  
 - Thank you.

578
00:46:42,210 --> 00:46:47,060
I knew this was going to happen when you were swallowing so quickly.

579
00:46:47,130 --> 00:46:48,960
Do you not have to eat medicine?

580
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:52,480
I think it's just indigestion.

581
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:55,050
Was it that uncomfortable?

582
00:46:55,090 --> 00:46:59,400
- No ... 
 - I'm happy.

583
00:47:00,270 --> 00:47:03,230
I hope you keep feeling uncomfortable whenever you see me.

584
00:47:03,230 --> 00:47:08,650
I want you to be nervous and be self-conscious around me, like how I am with you.

585
00:47:09,980 --> 00:47:12,920
Oh, don't be sick though.

586
00:47:32,590 --> 00:47:38,460
 I am holding on to you, asking you to see me as a man right now. 

587
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:45,840
 I want you to be shaken, just once. 

588
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:30,100
  You deserve to be loved 

589
00:48:45,270 --> 00:48:48,160
Why are you opening this now?

590
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:01,470
  You deserve to be loved 

591
00:49:20,690 --> 00:49:26,160
I'm not in the right state of mind to be doing this right now.

592
00:49:30,750 --> 00:49:35,060
Brother-in-law, thank you very much.

593
00:49:35,090 --> 00:49:37,420
Buy something delicious with this, Brother-in-law.

594
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:42,310
Brother-in-law, how about we make a heart at the end of this path of candles?

595
00:49:42,310 --> 00:49:45,780
Then should these brothers-in-law make it together?

596
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:52,730
- Where are you going? 
 - The convenience store.

597
00:49:52,730 --> 00:49:55,890
Come help us blow this! Where are you doing?

598
00:49:57,950 --> 00:50:00,490
I can't do this anymore.

599
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:07,880
- You are crying again? 
 - Now it's so soon... our Hui Gyeong's wedding.

600
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:13,610
You are starting again. Why are you crying? Hui Gyeong should be the one crying instead.

601
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:17,620
No, I'm going to let Hui Gyeong know in advance.

602
00:50:17,620 --> 00:50:21,170
This is a surprise. Why would you tell her in advance?

603
00:50:21,170 --> 00:50:22,850
Honey—

604
00:50:26,290 --> 00:50:28,420
Yes, Madam Hong.

605
00:50:29,630 --> 00:50:35,400
Right now, Son-in-law Han is making a big mess at home to prepare a surprise proposal for you.

606
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:39,480
What? Proposal? That is why he acted like he was upset earlier.

607
00:50:39,530 --> 00:50:42,570
He is super excited to see you moved,

608
00:50:42,570 --> 00:50:46,110
so when you see him later, cry. Even if you have to squeeze your eyeballs, do it.

609
00:50:46,110 --> 00:50:50,560
I can only cry if tears fall. Okay, I got it.

610
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:55,260
What kind of cute event is he planning?

611
00:50:55,310 --> 00:50:57,600
But how am I going to cry?

612
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:03,020
When is the last time I cried?

613
00:51:06,060 --> 00:51:07,900
Here you go.

614
00:51:09,690 --> 00:51:14,210
It's already first snow? It's so annoying when it snows.

615
00:51:14,210 --> 00:51:16,460
It's  5700 won.

616
00:51:25,630 --> 00:51:31,950
  When the first snow falls, I should go make a wish at Namsan Peak. A wish for you to remember who I am. 

617
00:51:36,070 --> 00:51:38,910
I like this kind of ambience.

618
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:43,300
The night view is so pretty.

619
00:52:27,750 --> 00:52:29,730
Su Ho!

620
00:52:36,910 --> 00:52:38,880
I'm sorry.

621
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:53,180
My girl likes strawberries.

622
00:52:55,380 --> 00:53:01,440
♫  You don't know yet  ♫

623
00:53:02,610 --> 00:53:07,250
Oh, yeah, it's me. 
 ♫  How special you are  ♫

624
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:09,860
Of course I'm here. It's cold, so dress warmly. 
 ♫  To your heart  ♫

625
00:53:09,860 --> 00:53:14,440
♫  I hope I can   ♫

626
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:17,800
♫   reach  ♫

627
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:23,320
♫  Going deeper,   ♫

628
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:26,540
Looks like it's about time to change my contacts. 
 ♫   I am  ♫

629
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:29,370
♫  As I'm with you,   ♫

630
00:53:29,370 --> 00:53:34,730
♫   I am  ♫

631
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:39,920
♫  I'm missing you  ♫

632
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:43,560
♫  Waiting for you  ♫

633
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:50,900
♫  My heart is set for you.  ♫

634
00:53:50,950 --> 00:53:54,530
Ah, I can't calm down. 
 ♫  I'm missing you  ♫

635
00:53:54,530 --> 00:53:57,370
 Note: You were my world and every moment. I like you. Do you know what yellow tulips mean? It's a crush, a one-sided love.  

636
00:53:57,370 --> 00:54:00,410
 Note: When I saw you first, you sank into my eyes like moonlight. Whenever I see you, my heart stops like a broken clock. 

637
00:54:00,410 --> 00:54:03,550
Ah, seriously. I couldn't say anything.

638
00:54:03,550 --> 00:54:05,310
Meaning of a flower!

639
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:08,060
I didn't even tell her that.

640
00:54:08,060 --> 00:54:13,160
♫  A lot on my mind now  ♫

641
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:15,210
Sheesh, the meaning of the flower.

642
00:54:20,170 --> 00:54:23,610
Drinking alcohol alone is the best.

643
00:54:23,610 --> 00:54:27,270
A lot of snow is coming.

644
00:54:27,270 --> 00:54:30,890
♫  Waiting for you  ♫

645
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:38,070
♫  My heart is set for you  ♫

00:54:41,790 --> 00:54:45,800
♫  Waiting for you  ♫

648
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:51,950
♫  I'm waiting for you again today  ♫

649
00:54:51,950 --> 00:54:53,890
What time is it?

650
00:54:53,900 --> 00:55:01,000
♫  You're always staying by my side  ♫

651
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:04,090
♫  So I don't want to lose you  ♫

652
00:55:04,090 --> 00:55:06,940
♫  I really don't  ♫

653
00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:09,140
Please show me your ticket.

654
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:11,860
Did I drop it?

655
00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:14,420
Hold on.

656
00:55:14,420 --> 00:55:18,150
♫  Waiting for you  ♫

657
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:25,400
♫  My heart is set for you  ♫

658
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:29,060

659
00:55:29,060 --> 00:55:33,190
♫  Waiting for you  ♫

660
00:55:33,190 --> 00:55:36,570
♫  I'm waiting for you again today  ♫

661
00:55:36,570 --> 00:55:40,220
I found it!

662
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:04,070
 Heart Lock 

663
00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:09,120
Im Ju Gyeong?

664
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,010
Ju Gyeong.

665
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:24,160
 Heart Lock  

666
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:49,380
I ran here as soon as I got back.

667
00:56:53,710 --> 00:56:55,450
And you're here.

668
00:57:11,610 --> 00:57:13,660
Your face is cold.

669
00:57:15,270 --> 00:57:17,110
You must be cold.

670
00:57:23,130 --> 00:57:24,870
Why are you here?

671
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:29,920
Because I missed you.

672
00:57:31,630 --> 00:57:33,600
We broke up.

673
00:57:35,810 --> 00:57:37,720
So why do you miss me?

674
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:39,340
Even so,

675
00:57:43,410 --> 00:57:45,350
I missed you.

676
00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:50,710
As I missed you so much, I thought I might die.

677
00:58:01,010 --> 00:58:02,580
I...

678
00:58:06,210 --> 00:58:08,950
I didn't miss you.

679
00:58:15,190 --> 00:58:18,600
Ju Gyeong. Ju Gyeong!

680
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:22,810
 Did you get back okay? 

681
00:58:22,810 --> 00:58:25,870
Wow, you're at the practice room this late?

682
00:58:25,870 --> 00:58:28,170
Yes, I don't think I can sleep tonight.

683
00:58:28,170 --> 00:58:31,980
Why not? Are you nervous because of your debut?

684
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:33,810
Punk, work hard.

685
00:58:33,810 --> 00:58:35,580
Right, Director Kang said

686
00:58:35,580 --> 00:58:38,280
- that Su Ho came back today. You know that, right?
 - What?

687
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:41,990
You didn't know? Ex-CEO woke up last month.

688
00:58:41,990 --> 00:58:43,940
They say it's a miracle at the hospital.

689
00:58:43,940 --> 00:58:45,780
It's nice, right?

690
00:58:45,780 --> 00:58:46,960
Right, it's nice.

691
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:48,790
Don't overwork yourself and get some rest.

692
00:58:48,790 --> 00:58:50,780
- I'm off.
 - Okay.

693
00:58:52,430 --> 00:58:54,810
He didn't even tell me.

694
00:58:57,590 --> 00:59:00,370
 The customer... 

695
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:01,450
What the...

696
00:59:01,450 --> 00:59:04,070
Ju Gyeong! Let's talk for a bit.

697
00:59:04,070 --> 00:59:07,000
Let go. I don't want to see you right now.

698
00:59:07,970 --> 00:59:09,330
Are you hurting somewhere?

699
00:59:09,330 --> 00:59:10,820
Ju Gyeong.

700
00:59:10,820 --> 00:59:13,020
No, just go. Ow!

701
00:59:13,990 --> 00:59:15,520
Are you okay?

702
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:17,820
Let's go to the hospital.

703
00:59:41,990 --> 00:59:44,130
Why are you getting sick?

704
00:59:54,530 --> 00:59:57,440
 Emergency Center 

705
01:00:17,020 --> 01:00:19,390
Why are you still here?

706
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:23,050
I told you to go.

707
01:00:23,050 --> 01:00:24,390
How can I go?

708
01:00:24,390 --> 01:00:27,310
- Hurry and go. 
 - I'm not going.

709
01:00:28,130 --> 01:00:30,420
Then I'll go.

710
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:33,550
How are you?

711
01:00:33,550 --> 01:00:35,270
I'm fine.

712
01:00:35,270 --> 01:00:37,170
- Are the test results back? 
 - Yes.

713
01:00:37,170 --> 01:00:39,040
Nothing major, right?

714
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:40,060
It's nothing major.

715
01:00:40,060 --> 01:00:42,840
Then why is she hurting so much?

716
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:44,110
What is it?

717
01:00:44,110 --> 01:00:46,200
It's 'constipation'.  (T/N: the doctor said it in English.) 

718
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:47,520
Excuse me?

719
01:00:49,330 --> 01:00:51,020
Is it something serious?

720
01:00:51,020 --> 01:00:52,940
It's not something that I need surgery or something, right?

721
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:54,680
You're constipated.

722
01:00:54,680 --> 01:00:58,530
It seems that you had a severe stomachache momentarily due to constipation.

723
01:00:58,530 --> 01:01:00,060
As you can see on the X-ray here,

724
01:01:00,060 --> 01:01:04,450
this patchy area is all gas and stool.

725
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:07,300
How long has it been?

726
01:01:07,300 --> 01:01:10,700
No! I-I'm fine.

727
01:01:18,090 --> 01:01:20,630
Drinking is not good for constipation.

728
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:25,310
Ju Gyeong. Ju Gyeong! Ju Gyeong!

729
01:01:25,310 --> 01:01:27,610
 Restroom 

730
01:01:27,610 --> 01:01:30,320
Gosh, it's driving me nuts.

731
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:38,980
What do I do?

732
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:49,040
Im Ju Gyeong's guardian? Please come here to pay.

733
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:50,360
Okay.

734
01:02:01,630 --> 01:02:03,690
 My loving Hui Gyeong, will you marry me? 

735
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:07,440
- I'm turning it on.  
 - She's coming, shhh.

736
01:02:10,940 --> 01:02:14,300
♫ The door's opening.

737
01:02:14,300 --> 01:02:17,110
♫ You step in.

738
01:02:17,110 --> 01:02:19,930
♫ At first sight,

739
01:02:19,930 --> 01:02:23,850
♫ I knew you were my sister-in-law.

740
01:02:23,850 --> 01:02:25,600
- L-Little Noona?
 - Was that Ju Gyeong?

741
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:27,730
Yeah, that was Ju Gyeong.

742
01:02:27,730 --> 01:02:29,610
Let's die, just die.

743
01:02:29,610 --> 01:02:32,300
Why did you live, Im Ju Gyeong?

744
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:34,440
Why do I meet him like this?

745
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:38,370
Darn it.

746
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:43,470
What is this, Grapefruit? This is so touching!

747
01:02:44,170 --> 01:02:47,700
This is so touching.

748
01:02:47,700 --> 01:02:50,730
This is no good. No good. Let's do it again from the beginning.

749
01:02:50,730 --> 01:02:52,380
Hui Gyeong, let's get out.

750
01:02:52,380 --> 01:02:54,290
- You have to re-enter. 
 - Darn it.

751
01:02:54,290 --> 01:02:55,820
- Why?!
 - We have to do this over.

752
01:02:55,820 --> 01:02:57,130
Gosh, seriously!

753
01:02:57,130 --> 01:02:59,570
- Let's do this again. 
 - What's wrong with you?

754
01:03:00,870 --> 01:03:03,880
It's okay, it's okay. Let's do this one more time. Calm down.

755
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:06,080
This is okay. Take a deep breath.

756
01:03:06,080 --> 01:03:08,300
It's not easy to get married, right?

757
01:03:22,190 --> 01:03:25,130
- Yes.
 -  I left your bags at home. 

758
01:03:25,130 --> 01:03:28,790
 Where did you have to go in such a hurry? 

759
01:03:54,750 --> 01:03:56,610
 I found it. 

760
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:08,100
 Im Ju Gyeong? 

761
01:04:16,930 --> 01:04:18,830
Because it was snowing.

762
01:04:19,570 --> 01:04:20,860
They said it was the first snow.

763
01:04:20,860 --> 01:04:23,360
 What? Oh, you can use the car in front of your house if you need to. 

764
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:25,800
-  It's your dad's car. 
 - Okay.

765
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:27,830
Thank you for today.

766
01:04:43,300 --> 01:04:46,240
 Girlfriend 

767
01:04:48,710 --> 01:04:51,690
 Calling Girlfriend   

768
01:04:51,690 --> 01:04:53,710
 Girlfriend 

769
01:05:09,300 --> 01:05:11,600
 Lee Su Ho 

770
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:24,090
 Did you get back okay? 

771
01:05:31,700 --> 01:05:34,830
 Missed call: Han Seo Jun 

772
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:42,110
- Han Seo Jun.
 - You're back.

773
01:05:43,140 --> 01:05:44,620
How did you know I was back?

774
01:05:44,620 --> 01:05:46,260
I heard at work.

775
01:05:46,260 --> 01:05:48,960
Aren't you being too much? How can you not call me?

776
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:50,140
Sorry.

777
01:05:50,140 --> 01:05:53,370
I got back in a hurry, so I had to sort some things.

778
01:05:53,370 --> 01:05:55,520
Your house looks the same.

779
01:05:57,330 --> 01:05:58,400
I only have water.

780
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:00,030
That's okay.

781
01:06:00,030 --> 01:06:01,560
How's your dad?

782
01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:02,930
Is he okay now?

783
01:06:02,930 --> 01:06:04,620
Did he get discharged from the hospital?

784
01:06:04,620 --> 01:06:08,100
He transferred to a rehabilitation center for more physical therapy.

785
01:06:08,100 --> 01:06:09,430
That's good.

786
01:06:09,430 --> 01:06:13,530
Hey, if you're back in Korea, you should've come right to me.

787
01:06:13,530 --> 01:06:16,880
How can you not even call me? I called you so many times.

788
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:18,850
I was out of it.

789
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:21,590
I met Ju Gyeong.

790
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:27,420
Is that so? You met her today?

791
01:06:27,420 --> 01:06:30,840
Yeah. Coincidentally.

792
01:06:37,740 --> 01:06:39,690
 Are you crying? 

793
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:43,590
 It's because it's spicy. 

794
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:46,890
 You've always eaten it well, though. 

795
01:06:50,610 --> 01:06:54,920
 Are you crying? Did the colleges announce their results? 

796
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:57,450
 Is it because you failed? 

797
01:06:59,110 --> 01:07:03,060
 But why are you crying? Is something going on? 

798
01:07:03,060 --> 01:07:05,540
 It's because I miss him. 

799
01:07:07,150 --> 01:07:09,740
 I miss him. 

800
01:07:09,740 --> 01:07:12,150
 That jerk, seriously. 

801
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:17,370
 Then you should call him. Based on his personality, he's probably like that because he's sorry. 

802
01:07:17,370 --> 01:07:19,520
 Should I tell him? 

803
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:26,200
 No. I'm really going to forget him now. 

804
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:28,780
 I'm almost done sorting it out. 

805
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:33,050
 But why am I like this today? 

806
01:07:33,940 --> 01:07:36,340
 Is it because it's snowing? 

807
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:47,230
- Han Seo Jun. 
 - Huh?

808
01:07:47,230 --> 01:07:48,900
Did you eat? Shall I order you something?

809
01:07:48,900 --> 01:07:50,520
Of course you should!

810
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:52,900
We haven't seen each other in a long time, so we should catch up.

811
01:07:52,900 --> 01:07:54,810
Stay here.

812
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:22,200
This kind of coincidence?

813
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:24,200
We meet here.

814
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:26,060
What's this?

815
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,870
Where are you going? Where are you going?

816
01:08:31,870 --> 01:08:33,070
Don't follow me.

817
01:08:33,070 --> 01:08:35,590
I'm not following you. I'm also going this way.

818
01:08:35,590 --> 01:08:37,800
This is also a coincidence.

819
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:40,280
Did you eat breakfast?

820
01:08:40,280 --> 01:08:42,640
Show me your face a bit.

821
01:08:43,830 --> 01:08:46,810
The first snow came yesterday, right? Why did you come to Namsan?

822
01:08:46,810 --> 01:08:49,610
You remembered me, right?

823
01:08:51,060 --> 01:08:54,780
Your words were right. My wish really came true.

824
01:08:54,780 --> 01:08:56,890
Im Ju Gyeong. Im Ju Gyeong!

825
01:08:56,890 --> 01:08:59,250
Your stomach is going to hurt if you do that!  Im Ju Gyeong!

826
01:08:59,250 --> 01:09:01,870
Ju Gyeong. Ju Gyeong!

827
01:09:01,870 --> 01:09:04,170
Taxi! Taxi!

828
01:09:04,170 --> 01:09:06,080
Im Ju Gyeong! Ju Gyeong!

829
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:08,090
Im Ju Gyeong! Im Ju Gyeong!

830
01:09:08,090 --> 01:09:10,040
Ju Gyeong!

831
01:09:13,350 --> 01:09:17,370
After a year of no contact, what is he doing now that he's here?

832
01:09:28,670 --> 01:09:30,600
Lee Su Ho?

833
01:09:33,030 --> 01:09:34,480
How'd you know to come here?

834
01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:37,020
There's even this kind of coincidence.

835
01:09:37,020 --> 01:09:39,950
You work here? When do you finish today?

836
01:09:39,950 --> 01:09:42,070
Who told you? Im Ju Yeong? Yoo Tae Hoon?

837
01:09:42,070 --> 01:09:44,310
It's really a coincidence.

838
01:09:44,310 --> 01:09:46,790
You came to a hair-makeup shop coincidentally? You?

839
01:09:46,790 --> 01:09:50,580
Seriously. I came to get my hair done.

840
01:09:50,580 --> 01:09:53,000
Get your hair done well and leave.

841
01:09:53,700 --> 01:09:55,440
Hey!

842
01:09:57,570 --> 01:09:59,870
Is that man perhaps an actor?

843
01:09:59,870 --> 01:10:02,310
- I'm not sure. He's handsome— 
 - Excuse me.

844
01:10:02,310 --> 01:10:04,100
Could you get me something to drink?

845
01:10:04,100 --> 01:10:06,880
My throat is so dry.

846
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:09,570
What are you doing? Hurry and give one to him.

847
01:10:09,570 --> 01:10:11,350
Okay.

848
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:23,180
You should give him a lot because he's handsome!

849
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:28,210
Lee Su Ho doesn't like sweets...

850
01:10:28,210 --> 01:10:30,120
Why do I remember these types of things?

851
01:10:30,120 --> 01:10:32,380
Whether he likes it or not.

852
01:10:34,570 --> 01:10:37,710
 Selena Beauty 

853
01:10:42,780 --> 01:10:44,420
Is she working without having eaten?

854
01:10:44,420 --> 01:10:46,180
After ten minutes, you'll be done.

855
01:10:46,180 --> 01:10:47,540
Already?

856
01:10:47,540 --> 01:10:50,080
Then... could you get it back to normal?

857
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:52,800
I changed my mind.

858
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:54,050
You've worked hard.

859
01:10:54,050 --> 01:10:55,760
- You've worked hard, Ju Gyeong. 
 - You've done well.

860
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:57,540
You worked hard.

861
01:11:00,890 --> 01:11:03,250
He must have left.

862
01:11:12,140 --> 01:11:14,550
- Han Seo Jun? 
 - Oh?

863
01:11:14,550 --> 01:11:15,840
You finished early.

864
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:18,310
- Without calling... 
 - Play with me today.

865
01:11:18,310 --> 01:11:19,720
What?

866
01:11:19,720 --> 01:11:23,530
You said you'd meet me for three dates. Did you forget?

867
01:11:24,330 --> 01:11:27,240
That... yesterday, I...

868
01:11:27,240 --> 01:11:29,200
You met Lee Su Ho?

869
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:30,560
You heard?

870
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:34,200
So what if you met him? Can't you hang out with me?

871
01:11:35,310 --> 01:11:39,960
Today, don't think about anything and only think about me.

872
01:11:41,190 --> 01:11:43,720
That's the courtesy for my confession.

873
01:11:44,950 --> 01:11:47,670
Okay, I understand. What are we going to do for fun?

874
01:11:47,670 --> 01:11:50,260
Trust this oppa and follow me.

875
01:11:51,070 --> 01:11:52,760
What oppa?

876
01:11:52,760 --> 01:11:54,870
Where are we going?

877
01:12:12,470 --> 01:12:14,720
Why skating all of a sudden?

878
01:12:14,720 --> 01:12:17,740
When guys date, don't you know they normally bring girls here?

879
01:12:17,740 --> 01:12:21,930
When she falls, he can grab her and as skin contact happens,

880
01:12:21,930 --> 01:12:26,370
they can both skate and flirt. Isn't it something like that?

881
01:12:26,370 --> 01:12:28,690
I can't skate well.

882
01:12:28,690 --> 01:12:30,810
Same here.

883
01:12:30,810 --> 01:12:33,010
- What? 
 - What do we do?

884
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:37,100
Let me see. I'll do it for you.

885
01:12:37,100 --> 01:12:40,430
Okay, okay. How should I do this?

886
01:12:41,730 --> 01:12:42,640
You tied it well.

887
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:46,470
♫  I like you  ♫

888
01:12:46,470 --> 01:12:50,410
♫  You will also  ♫

889
01:12:50,410 --> 01:12:53,660
♫  come to like me  ♫

890
01:12:53,660 --> 01:12:55,070
Huh? Hey!

891
01:12:55,070 --> 01:12:57,410
Be careful.

892
01:12:57,410 --> 01:13:01,240
♫  I will become happy at the end  ♫

893
01:13:01,240 --> 01:13:02,600
♫  You will also come to look at me only  ♫

894
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:05,300
You said you couldn't skate well.

895
01:13:05,300 --> 01:13:07,790
Im Ju Gyeong, let's make a bet.

896
01:13:07,790 --> 01:13:11,710
The person who goes over to that pillar the fastest will win. How about a wish?

897
01:13:11,710 --> 01:13:13,010
It's always a wish with you.

898
01:13:13,010 --> 01:13:16,140
Let's do it once. Instead, I'll skate backwards.

899
01:13:16,140 --> 01:13:17,560
Ready.

900
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:20,270
One, two, three. Go!

901
01:13:20,270 --> 01:13:23,120
♫  Everyone will come to look at me only  ♫

902
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:25,930
- Oh, you're good. 
 - Aren't I good?

903
01:13:27,340 --> 01:13:31,030
Oh! Oh!

904
01:13:31,030 --> 01:13:33,560
Im Ju Gyeong!

905
01:13:33,560 --> 01:13:36,250
Im Ju Gyeong!

906
01:13:36,250 --> 01:13:40,050
Im Ju Gyeong, are you okay? Did you get hurt a lot?

907
01:13:40,050 --> 01:13:41,440
I'm okay.

908
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:42,880
Let's get up.

909
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:45,300
One, two, three...

910
01:13:46,180 --> 01:13:47,650
Did you get hurt a lot?

911
01:13:47,650 --> 01:13:50,380
It just got skinned slightly.

912
01:13:50,380 --> 01:13:51,690
Give it. I'll put it on.

913
01:13:51,690 --> 01:13:53,490
Let me see.

914
01:14:01,430 --> 01:14:03,200
 Sorry. 

915
01:14:05,110 --> 01:14:06,950
 I'm sorry. 

916
01:14:09,700 --> 01:14:12,250
I said I'll do it.

917
01:14:16,820 --> 01:14:18,970
We did the bet for no reason.

918
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:22,460
Why do you like bets that much?

919
01:14:22,460 --> 01:14:24,500
Here. Throw it away.

920
01:14:26,090 --> 01:14:28,220
I won, okay?

921
01:14:56,750 --> 01:14:58,590
I need to buy an earring.

922
01:14:58,590 --> 01:14:59,970
For Go Woon?

923
01:14:59,970 --> 01:15:02,460
No, for me.

924
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:09,450
Which out of the two is better?

925
01:15:10,520 --> 01:15:13,300
- This one for me. 
 - This one?

926
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:14,930
Please give me this one. Oh!

927
01:15:14,930 --> 01:15:17,010
She's going to pay. Thanks.

928
01:15:17,010 --> 01:15:20,480
What? Hey, Han Seo Jun!

929
01:15:29,980 --> 01:15:32,200
It's changed a lot.

930
01:15:39,780 --> 01:15:43,200
 Im Ju Gyeong's spot. 
 Sitting without permission will cause hair to grow on your butt! 

931
01:15:45,630 --> 01:15:48,190
 After this, you want to break up? You jerk. 

932
01:15:48,190 --> 01:15:50,540
 I hope you get constipation! 

933
01:16:02,870 --> 01:16:04,540
 Where are you? 

934
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:07,840
 I'll wait for you. 

935
01:16:08,540 --> 01:16:11,990
Since you bought my earring, this one's on me.

936
01:16:11,990 --> 01:16:13,750
I should have ordered something more expensive.

937
01:16:13,750 --> 01:16:16,040
This is expensive.

938
01:16:16,040 --> 01:16:17,980
It's tasty!

939
01:16:19,180 --> 01:16:22,450
  Lee Su Ho: I'll wait for you. 
 Missed call: Lee Su Ho 

940
01:16:30,770 --> 01:16:34,730
- It's greasy. You want to eat ice cream? 
 - Huh?

941
01:16:34,730 --> 01:16:36,170
- Excuse me. 
 - Yes!

942
01:16:36,170 --> 01:16:38,500
- Please give us mint ice cream. 
 - Okay, I understand.

943
01:16:38,500 --> 01:16:40,870
- Make it refreshing! 
 - Okay!

944
01:16:40,870 --> 01:16:44,070
- Strong mint flavour, please! 
 - Okay.

945
01:16:45,770 --> 01:16:47,970
  Prince Comics  

946
01:16:49,110 --> 01:16:51,300
I'm okay. You didn't have to walk me home.

947
01:16:51,300 --> 01:16:54,790
Because today it's a man to a woman?

948
01:16:54,790 --> 01:16:57,210
If you were a friend, I wouldn't have walked you home.

949
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:03,130
Don't you think you live in an  area with too many  stations?

950
01:17:03,130 --> 01:17:06,030
What are you saying? It's so far from a bus station.

951
01:17:06,030 --> 01:17:09,800
No, it only takes a short time.

952
01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:11,630
We're here.

953
01:17:11,630 --> 01:17:13,810
Go back safely.

954
01:17:14,740 --> 01:17:17,050
Im Ju Gyeong.

955
01:17:17,050 --> 01:17:18,750
Hm?

956
01:17:20,370 --> 01:17:25,330
I... I'm going to use my wish.

957
01:17:43,100 --> 01:17:48,680
♫  I just don't have the courage  ♫

958
01:17:50,010 --> 01:17:55,580
♫  I'm afraid it will be too much for you  ♫

959
01:17:56,980 --> 01:18:04,210
♫  I'm always anxious  ♫

960
01:18:04,210 --> 01:18:09,840
♫  I am loving you  ♫

961
01:18:10,540 --> 01:18:14,050
♫  Fall in you  ♫

962
01:18:14,050 --> 01:18:17,730
♫  I just found out  ♫

963
01:18:17,730 --> 01:18:21,770
♫  Fall in you  ♫

964
01:18:21,770 --> 01:18:24,720
♫  I am waiting for you  ♫

965
01:18:24,720 --> 01:18:28,120
♫  Fall in you  ♫

966
01:18:28,120 --> 01:18:32,530
♫  You are my destiny  ♫

967
01:18:32,530 --> 01:18:37,580
♫  The one person who will be my star  ♫

968
01:18:37,580 --> 01:18:43,050
♫  Am I too late  ♫

969
01:18:43,050 --> 01:18:46,210
♫  I'm afraid of hurting you  ♫

970
01:18:46,210 --> 01:18:50,080
 True Beauty 

971
01:18:50,080 --> 01:18:54,370
 The memories from back then aren't as painful now. 

972
01:18:54,370 --> 01:18:56,260
 I'm sorry. 

973
01:18:56,260 --> 01:18:58,070
 Do you still like Ju Gyeong? 

974
01:18:58,070 --> 01:19:02,580
 No. I'm dating Im Ju Gyeong. 

975
01:19:02,580 --> 01:19:03,670
 It's Ju Gyeong. 

976
01:19:03,670 --> 01:19:05,940
 He's weird. He's like seaweed! 

977
01:19:05,940 --> 01:19:07,170
 I'm going to start studying. 

978
01:19:07,170 --> 01:19:10,510
 I plan to start studying properly from the beginning. 

979
01:19:10,510 --> 01:19:12,560
 Did you know? 

980
01:19:12,560 --> 01:19:15,640
 Today was my last. 

981
01:19:15,640 --> 01:19:17,440
 Don't leave. 

982
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:23,880
