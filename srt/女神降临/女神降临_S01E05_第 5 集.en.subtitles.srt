1
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:53,428
Here, take it.

2
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:57,182
-What?
-You told me not to ride it.

3
00:00:58,308 --> 00:00:59,851
Are they dating?

4
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:02,312
Starting today,

5
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,230
I'll only listen to you.

6
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:11,112
What was that? Was that a confession?

7
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:13,323
Does Seo-jun like Ju-kyung?

8
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:14,908
That's huge.

9
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:17,160
Hey, Seo-jun!

10
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:18,536
Don't go.

11
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:24,250
-Just a--
-I said, don't go.

12
00:01:38,097 --> 00:01:38,932
Why?

13
00:01:40,558 --> 00:01:41,684
I have something to say.

14
00:01:42,685 --> 00:01:43,812
Something to say?

15
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:46,564
About what?

16
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:50,485
Well…

17
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,113
Well?

18
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:57,450
The wildfires in Australia are caused
by the Indian Ocean Dipole and El Niño.

19
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:59,452
What do you think about
their interrelationship?

20
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:02,330
Niño what now?

21
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,500
-Here.
-Pass it.

22
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:08,086
Hey.

23
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:15,385
Take this back.
Why would you give it to me?

24
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:19,139
You should hold on to it
so I don't ride the motorcycle.

25
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:20,056
Why?

26
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,850
Because I'll only listen to you.

27
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:22,767
-What?
-What?

28
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,145
Are you trying to get back at me

29
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:27,689
for blackmailing you
with the photo of you and the motorcycle?

30
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:30,191
Get back at you? Please.

31
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:37,282
I found this on the way here.
You can have it.

32
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,659
BASED ON WEBTOON TRUE BEAUTY
BY YAONGYI

33
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:41,619
I prefer strawberry.

34
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,961
Limju, what's up with him all of a sudden?

35
00:02:50,044 --> 00:02:51,588
What's with the motorcycle key?

36
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,516
Seo-jun.

37
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:07,812
-What's with you two?
-There she is!

38
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:09,439
Catch it.

39
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:16,946
-Hey, what's going on?
-What is it?

40
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,991
-What's that?
-Hey, what is it?

41
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:22,702
-See this?
-That's awesome.

42
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:24,662
-Watch this, look.
-Hey, Si-hyun.

43
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:26,706
You're so bad at it. Go home and practice.

44
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:28,499
Can we have lunch later--

45
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,419
Enjoy your lunch.

46
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:33,796
-What's up with him?
-Look.

47
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:39,010
When did he put this in here?

48
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:45,350
You can sit here if you want.

49
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:52,523
Thanks.

50
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:06,913
-You said you weren't drinking it.
-I can't just throw it away.

51
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:08,248
-Here, have this.
-What…

52
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:19,717
All right. Take a seat, everyone.

53
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:20,635
-Okay.
-Yes.

54
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:24,514
I'm going to do a roll call.

55
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:25,723
-Yes.
-Yes.

56
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:27,850
-Kim Si-hyun.
-Present.

57
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:30,186
-Kim Ji-eun.
-Present.

58
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,522
-Kim Eun-sol.
-Present.

59
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:34,524
-Kim Seo-won.
-Present.

60
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,609
-Ha Ji-young.
-Present.

61
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,820
-Kim Ju-won.
-Present.

62
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:40,905
-Kim Su-jin.
-Present.

63
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:42,407
-Park Jun-young.
-Present.

64
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:45,618
When organic matter
is decomposed by enzymes,

65
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:46,995
inorganic matter is created,

66
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:49,998
and energy is produced during the process.

67
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:53,501
Some of the energy is converted into ATP,

68
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:56,879
and the rest is released
as thermal energy.

69
00:04:57,547 --> 00:05:02,135
That's when cellular respiration occurs.

70
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:25,825
Did he bring this

71
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:29,162
because I said I liked strawberry?

72
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:37,128
During the day, the light energy is stored

73
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:39,964
so that it can be used when needed.

74
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:41,507
Let's look at the next page.

75
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:43,217
Ju-kyung, let me sit next to you.

76
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,262
How could you?

77
00:05:46,345 --> 00:05:47,722
Seo-jun, seriously?

78
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:49,849
You're annoying.

79
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:52,977
Seo-jun, go away if you're here
to give her a hard time.

80
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:55,354
I'm only going to listen to Ju-kyung.

81
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:58,900
-"Only going to listen to her."
-"Only going to listen to her."

82
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:01,360
Then,

83
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,154
can you do me a favor?

84
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:06,574
Of course.

85
00:06:07,658 --> 00:06:09,202
Can you get lost?

86
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:10,661
What?

87
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:14,624
I'll do anything other than that.

88
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:17,585
-"I'll do anything."
-"I'll do anything."

89
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:20,838
Then can you not talk to me?

90
00:06:22,381 --> 00:06:23,257
Not that either.

91
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:26,052
What are you even saying?

92
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:31,224
You don't like this one?

93
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:37,021
That's my favorite side dish!

94
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,232
I was saving that for last!

95
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:40,525
Why would you do that?

96
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:42,401
Why do you care about how I eat?

97
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:46,739
I'll only listen to you.

98
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:49,534
Hey, bring the pork cutlets.

99
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:51,452
-"Pork cutlets."
-"Pork cutlets."

100
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:54,163
Ta-da!

101
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,710
You want me to eat all of these?

102
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:01,045
Yes.

103
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:04,132
Is this a crush or a crash? I can't tell.

104
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:06,884
You need to eat more
to grow taller, right?

105
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:13,224
Don't eat your hair, though.

106
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,272
What a gentleman.

107
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:28,781
Just take your key.
Don't sneak it into my pocket again.

108
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:30,408
What would I do with it, though…

109
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:34,620
when my motorcycle is parked
in front of your place.

110
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,459
-Gosh.
-That's disgusting.

111
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:43,296
-Hey.
-Look at Seo-jun's face.

112
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:45,590
-I'm okay.
-Are you crazy?

113
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:46,799
Great job, Ju-kyung.

114
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:47,717
What now?

115
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:51,053
Hey, I'm really sorry.

116
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:53,014
-You find this funny?
-I can't believe it.

117
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:02,148
Ju-kyung!

118
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:03,441
You have such a long tail.

119
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:09,947
Like a long-tailed monkey!

120
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:12,950
-Don't make fun of me.
-Of course, I'll listen to you.

121
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:29,717
-What are you doing?
-You two are so cute.

122
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:37,308
-Hey!
-Why did you catch me?

123
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:38,684
I fell because of you.

124
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:41,229
-I saved you!
-I don't need you to save me.

125
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:44,941
And please just listen to me
and take back your motorcycle key.

126
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:49,487
Can't I just attend school in peace?

127
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:51,489
Are you all right?

128
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:54,617
Yes.

129
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,746
-What were you thinking?
-She dumped you.

130
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:00,373
-She's into me!
-Let's get him out.

131
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:02,208
-I'm Han Seo-jun!
-We know, it's okay.

132
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:06,128
-To the countless hands
-To the countless hands

133
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:10,716
-That have uplifted me
-That have uplifted me

134
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:17,807
-Like the sun that illuminates me
-Like the sun that illuminates me

135
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:21,894
-Become
-Become

136
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:27,817
-A light
-A light

137
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:30,152
Brava!

138
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:32,154
Brava.

139
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:36,033
I thought Maria Callas
came back from the grave.

140
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:41,539
Go-un's voice is such a pleasure
to the ears, isn't it?

141
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:45,543
Congratulazioni.

142
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:52,717
The solo part goes to you, Han Go-un.

143
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:58,848
Like a lone flower blossoming

144
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:03,436
In a wide open field

145
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:08,983
-I've protected the feeling of emptiness…
-She's so good at singing.

146
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:11,777
Get out.

147
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:16,115
Hey.

148
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:19,160
Didn't I tell you not to give it your all?

149
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:28,878
You're not actually thinking about
taking the solo part, are you?

150
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:32,965
Go tell the director right now
that you can't do it.

151
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:42,016
Those mean girls.

152
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:44,518
How could she slap a classmate?

153
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:13,839
Do you have tutoring today?

154
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:15,674
Yes. Two sessions at that.

155
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:17,718
That's impressive.

156
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:22,723
-What's wrong with your hands?
-What about them?

157
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:25,267
Your hands are all cracked
when it's not even winter.

158
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:26,977
Hold on.

159
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,480
Give me your hands.

160
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:35,403
Your skin is amazing.
It should be the same for your hands.

161
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:36,904
What's this for?

162
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:39,365
You know my mom owns a beauty shop, right?

163
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:41,575
All done.

164
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:44,537
How is it? Smells nice, right?

165
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:47,498
Yes, it does.

166
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:57,508
What? Hey.

167
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:14,900
Amazing.

168
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:18,654
You are really something.

169
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,535
Right. Thought you were someone I knew.

170
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:27,621
Hey, really sorry.

171
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:29,081
Does she not recognize me?

172
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:30,124
By the way,

173
00:12:30,749 --> 00:12:31,584
you…

174
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:34,462
Let's go. Sir, we're getting off here!

175
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:40,092
Step aside so we can get off.

176
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:49,518
What was that? Rude!

177
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:50,561
Who is she?

178
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:51,645
I don't know.

179
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:55,274
I follow her on social media.
I thought I knew her for a second.

180
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:59,111
-That could've been embarrassing.
-But that girl was so rude. What the hell?

181
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,368
Why were you so terrified?

182
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:08,704
-Do you know them?
-What?

183
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:11,999
Well…

184
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:17,796
They just seemed like delinquents.

185
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:20,591
Hey, don't be scared of them.

186
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:22,968
They act meaner
if they know you're scared.

187
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:24,595
Be brave next time, okay?

188
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:00,608
What?

189
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:02,151
"I'll only listen to you"?

190
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:15,164
I should have left Seoul.

191
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:21,128
I made a promise to myself.

192
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:23,464
As long as I have you within my sight,

193
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:26,675
I'll protect you.

194
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:31,931
What are you doing, you brat?

195
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:35,392
Woman!

196
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:37,478
Do you want to revolutionize
the order of your ribs?

197
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:41,607
Get off unless you want
a crash landing in hell.

198
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:43,609
-Come on.
-Careful. This is expensive.

199
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:46,278
What is he thinking, parking this here?

200
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:51,492
What are you doing?

201
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:58,749
Are you asleep?

202
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:02,419
LIM JU-KYUNG

203
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:23,524
Good grief.

204
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:29,113
Hey, come out already.

205
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:32,449
She takes her sweet time
removing her thick makeup.

206
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:34,034
Hello?

207
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,161
Isn't this Ju-kyung's number?

208
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:37,788
She's in the shower.

209
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:39,498
Who are you?

210
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:40,833
The person showering next.

211
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:44,378
Goodness, Ju-young.

212
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:46,672
I told you to flush after you pee.

213
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:48,924
And turn the fan on when you poop.

214
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,343
Who are you to tell me
how to pee and poop?

215
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,178
Seriously, watch your mouth.

216
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:56,140
What are you doing?
Why did you answer my phone?

217
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:57,975
LEE SOO-HO

218
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:00,352
Lee Soo-ho?

219
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:28,547
LEE SOO-HO

220
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:37,765
LIM JU-KYUNG

221
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:43,020
Hey.

222
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,149
I hung up by accident.

223
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:51,653
-Was that your younger brother?
-Yes. My younger brother.

224
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:53,614
-But why--
-Well--

225
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:55,908
Sorry. You go first.

226
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:57,367
Want to meet up?

227
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:00,204
-Right now?
-I need my jacket back anyway.

228
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:04,541
Your jacket.

229
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:06,752
Yes, I'll be right out.

230
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:08,796
I'll see you at the playground.

231
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,223
I got goosebumps.

232
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:29,274
What?

233
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:48,961
Were you waiting long?

234
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:50,462
No.

235
00:18:57,469 --> 00:19:00,139
He seems to like you.
He was feisty towards me.

236
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:02,766
Yes, this cat has a temper.

237
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,226
He's incredibly wary,

238
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:07,437
but I fed him daily and groveled
to earn his special treatment.

239
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:09,565
Even to a cat.

240
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:12,359
You meddle in everything.

241
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:14,987
Still,

242
00:19:15,612 --> 00:19:18,073
it's sad that he's alone
because he's cold to everyone.

243
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:21,910
That sounds like me.

244
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:28,709
So you know you're cold.

245
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,755
At least you have your family.
But the cat…

246
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:35,924
I don't have a family.

247
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:42,514
Do you live alone then?

248
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:44,683
Yes, I do.

249
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,852
Then do you cook at…

250
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:52,274
I'm sorry. It's none of my business.

251
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:54,318
It's okay.

252
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,528
Why did you put makeup on?

253
00:19:58,238 --> 00:20:00,115
-What?
-Earlier…

254
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:03,285
Well…

255
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:06,038
your brother said you showered.

256
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:13,545
I always shower right before I go to bed.
I'll do it when I get home.

257
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:15,255
I see.

258
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:18,884
Did you come all the way here
just to get your jacket?

259
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:20,928
Of course.

260
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:25,390
What other reason would I have
other than just to get my jacket?

261
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:27,059
Right.

262
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:28,393
It's my favorite one.

263
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:30,062
I'm very attached to it.

264
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:31,563
Really?

265
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:33,565
Hey,

266
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:36,693
I'm really, truly, sorry.

267
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:39,029
But the jacket isn't quite dry yet.

268
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:43,200
You came all the way out here to get it.

269
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,160
Well, can't be helped.

270
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:47,329
Thanks for understanding.

271
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:49,706
I'll treat you to something nice
next time instead.

272
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:58,757
Okay, then. Bye.

273
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:04,388
Hey.

274
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:07,099
Yes?

275
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:09,226
There's a basketball.

276
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:21,947
It's nothing.

277
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:25,534
I didn't expect that.

278
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:27,953
You look like you'd spend
all of your time studying.

279
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:31,748
Can you make a shot?

280
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:45,345
-It's flat, that's why.
-You sure?

281
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:49,933
Awesome!

282
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:50,976
Did you see that?

283
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:53,312
Hey, watch this.

284
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:55,022
The left hand only guides.

285
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:56,898
You were using your left hand too much.

286
00:21:57,566 --> 00:21:58,984
Like so.

287
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:03,322
I was captain of the varsity team
until last year.

288
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:05,657
Then why aren't you playing
in the next game?

289
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:08,327
-Just because.
-Did you get cut from the team?

290
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:09,745
Because you couldn't make shots.

291
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:12,789
The left hand only guides. Like so.

292
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:14,082
Enough with the left hand.

293
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,335
You'd faint if you saw me play a game.

294
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:19,296
What did I say?

295
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:22,174
I said it just guides.

296
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:12,808
Well…

297
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:15,560
How was it?

298
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:16,520
What--

299
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:18,897
What do you mean? The hug--

300
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,148
The scent.

301
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:23,318
I got a new laundry detergent yesterday.

302
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:25,028
Laundry detergent?

303
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:27,906
The ad said the scent lasts,
even after a workout.

304
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:29,908
I just wanted to check.

305
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:34,246
Yes. It smelled amazing.

306
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:38,834
But why is your face…

307
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:51,555
It's you guys again.

308
00:23:59,312 --> 00:24:00,564
What are you doing?

309
00:24:00,647 --> 00:24:01,731
How's the scent?

310
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:03,608
I got a new detergent.

311
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:04,901
Is it citrus?

312
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:10,699
It's fresh and nice.

313
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:11,867
Is that so?

314
00:24:14,744 --> 00:24:16,705
Yes, this one's good. Is it an import?

315
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:18,957
Hold still.

316
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:23,837
Sir…

317
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,467
My heart skipped a beat
while checking the scent.

318
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:31,887
You idiot.
What kind of excuse is laundry detergent?

319
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:33,597
Hey, by the way,

320
00:24:34,764 --> 00:24:36,516
you don't have to walk me home.

321
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:39,853
The bus stop is closer on the other side.

322
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:43,940
I thought…

323
00:25:11,092 --> 00:25:12,010
We're here.

324
00:25:12,802 --> 00:25:14,638
Yes, we are.

325
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:19,726
Then, I'll go inside now. Bye.

326
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:22,062
You should give it to me.

327
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:24,856
Your jacket?

328
00:25:25,523 --> 00:25:27,025
It's not dry yet.

329
00:25:27,525 --> 00:25:29,277
No, the motorcycle key.

330
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:31,696
I'll return it to him.

331
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:33,782
No. I'll give him the key.

332
00:25:34,449 --> 00:25:35,700
What if you fight again?

333
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:38,078
It's okay. Don't worry about it.

334
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,170
Has he returned the key already?

335
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:51,091
They better not have had another fight.

336
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,178
Good.

337
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:57,889
Nice.

338
00:25:58,473 --> 00:25:59,474
Soo-ho,

339
00:25:59,557 --> 00:26:02,143
I saw that Seo-jun
took the motorcycle right away.

340
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:03,728
Did he?

341
00:26:06,481 --> 00:26:08,149
-That was good.
-Nice.

342
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:09,567
-Not bad.
-Over here.

343
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:15,657
You hug very well.

344
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:18,660
-What?
-What?

345
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:21,579
I mean, you receive it well.

346
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:23,665
The ball.

347
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:27,502
Do you see this?

348
00:26:27,585 --> 00:26:29,546
Does that look like a basketball to you?

349
00:26:29,629 --> 00:26:31,423
What a show from the worst on the team.

350
00:26:31,506 --> 00:26:33,174
We'll see how it goes in the match.

351
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:34,634
We, the Saebom Devils,

352
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:37,262
will crush the class basketball club
made up of nobodies.

353
00:26:37,345 --> 00:26:39,180
-"Nobodies"?
-I meant you.

354
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:42,600
Our Savior Soo-ho will play again!

355
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:45,103
What? Soo-ho's going to play?

356
00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:47,522
-Why is he playing all of a sudden?
-Really?

357
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,735
I guess he's playing in the game.

358
00:26:51,818 --> 00:26:53,903
Who's going to block that giant?

359
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:59,284
Seo-jun, you're good at basketball, right?

360
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:02,495
What?

361
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:03,413
Why?

362
00:27:03,496 --> 00:27:05,790
-Do I seem like I'd be good at it?
-Yes.

363
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:07,459
I'm super good.

364
00:27:07,542 --> 00:27:08,918
You're super good, right?

365
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:10,462
Then for the festival,

366
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:13,923
can you join our team
and show off your super good skills?

367
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:16,051
Then…

368
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:19,054
I'll have to ask Ju-kyung first.

369
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:22,849
Lately, I only listen to her.

370
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:26,811
-He only listens to her!
-He only listens to her!

371
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:30,732
Ju-kyung, do you want to see me play?

372
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:32,150
No, not at all.

373
00:27:33,651 --> 00:27:34,903
Not at all?

374
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:39,282
Please, Ju-kyung. Tell him to play.
I really don't want to lose to Tae-hoon.

375
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:43,495
Whatever. I don't care.

376
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:45,955
If it's what you want, I'll do it.

377
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:47,499
I'll play.

378
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:49,918
Thank you so much.

379
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:52,670
It's just like this.

380
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:56,925
-This way, sir.
-This is it, right?

381
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:58,218
Yes, this way.

382
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:00,178
You watch your mouth.

383
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:02,555
He really might be into you.

384
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:04,516
He can't be doing all that for a photo.

385
00:28:05,141 --> 00:28:07,310
Whether he likes her
or is messing with her,

386
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:08,686
he's so childish.

387
00:28:10,313 --> 00:28:12,774
I can never figure Soo-ho out.

388
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:14,526
Look, he's playing volleyball alone.

389
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:16,361
-It's handball.
-Right.

390
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:18,571
Look.

391
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:21,658
It's seriously too hot.

392
00:28:22,283 --> 00:28:23,868
She's like a lottery ticket.

393
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:26,287
My speculations never turn out right.

394
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:29,582
Hello?

395
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:32,043
Yes, that's me.

396
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:34,879
What? Being towed?

397
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:38,091
What did you do now, Ju-kyung?

398
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:40,385
Hey, Ju-kyung!

399
00:28:46,307 --> 00:28:47,559
What was that for?

400
00:28:47,642 --> 00:28:49,227
It's your turn to tidy things up.

401
00:28:51,646 --> 00:28:53,106
So immature.

402
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:57,110
-Don't you want your motorcycle back?
-I see.

403
00:28:57,986 --> 00:28:59,446
It was you who reported it then?

404
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:02,741
-You must have lost it.
-Just so you know, I have the key.

405
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:12,751
Hey, people from other schools
will be there too.

406
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:15,670
What will they think of our choir
if they see you doing the solo?

407
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:17,547
Why shouldn't I do the solo?

408
00:29:18,214 --> 00:29:19,758
You still don't get it, do you?

409
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:22,427
You can't because you're ugly, you hag.

410
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:29,768
What the heck? That's the rag water.

411
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:30,935
What the hell?

412
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:33,271
Your language is foul,
so I figured it needed cleaning.

413
00:29:33,354 --> 00:29:35,231
Who are you to say such things to her?

414
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:39,110
What's the use of a pretty face
when your mind is filthy and disgusting?

415
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:40,111
Aren't you a junior?

416
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:42,697
Who are you to get involved
and make a fuss?

417
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:43,823
Me?

418
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:51,581
I'm her older sister. What now?

419
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:55,460
Go-un!

420
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:59,214
Who was that crazy psycho?

421
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:02,592
-What did you just call her?
-Who is this now?

422
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:10,642
I missed.

423
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:15,480
If I catch you doing this again,
your noses will need fixing.

424
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:30,453
Because you are ugly.

425
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:46,678
Here.

426
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:54,644
Like they said,

427
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:59,190
do you think only certain people
should get to perform on a stage?

428
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:00,483
Not at all.

429
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:02,944
You were chosen because you did great.

430
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:06,030
I heard you singing the other day too.

431
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:08,950
I thought that being talented
would be enough,

432
00:31:10,451 --> 00:31:12,871
but if the audience laughs at my face,
just like them…

433
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:18,084
I'm scared my face will turn my voice

434
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:19,919
into a joke as well.

435
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:23,131
They're the ones in the wrong.
You shouldn't have to give up anything.

436
00:31:23,631 --> 00:31:25,967
Don't run away because you're scared.

437
00:31:27,802 --> 00:31:29,470
But you're pretty,

438
00:31:31,097 --> 00:31:32,807
so you wouldn't know how I feel.

439
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:35,476
You're wrong.

440
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:37,395
In fact,

441
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:39,939
I know better than anyone else.

442
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:50,700
One thing to remember
when applying eyeshadow.

443
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:53,786
Apply makeup to the inner
and outer corners of your eyes…

444
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:57,248
This would work well for Go-un.

445
00:31:57,332 --> 00:32:01,586
This way, your eyes will look bigger.
The base color…

446
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:02,795
Like so…

447
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,591
-What are you watching?
-What?

448
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:08,927
It's a makeup tutorial.

449
00:32:10,803 --> 00:32:13,723
Well, there's this girl I came across.

450
00:32:13,806 --> 00:32:15,350
I found her situation to be…

451
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:17,560
unfortunate.

452
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:19,854
I was wondering what I could do to help.

453
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:21,689
You're meddling again.

454
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:24,484
Right.

455
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:25,860
I'm being meddlesome.

456
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:27,737
But that kind of meddling

457
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:30,073
could provide support
to someone who needs it.

458
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:33,576
To be honest,

459
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:36,788
she reminded me of my old self.

460
00:32:38,539 --> 00:32:40,416
That must be why I feel drawn to her.

461
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:44,045
I look worse than her without makeup,
of course.

462
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:48,216
-That's not true.
-Sorry?

463
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:49,968
You look pretty even without makeup.

464
00:32:57,225 --> 00:32:59,394
-The bus will arrive shortly.
-The bus is here.

465
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:01,229
Okay.

466
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:24,502
No way.

467
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,839
It can't be.

468
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:32,343
LOVE COUNSELING

469
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:36,014
Hey guys. A guy hugged me,
asked how his new detergent smelled,

470
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:37,765
and told me I'm pretty.

471
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:38,933
What does that mean?

472
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:41,269
He likes you.
The detergent's an excuse for a hug.

473
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:42,520
He 100 percent likes you.

474
00:33:42,603 --> 00:33:44,814
The detergent thing sounds fishy.
Is he a player?

475
00:33:44,897 --> 00:33:45,815
Ask him out.

476
00:33:45,898 --> 00:33:48,693
Men never spend their time or money
if they're not interested.

477
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:49,736
Ask him out?

478
00:33:51,904 --> 00:33:54,866
I can't. I could never.

479
00:33:59,662 --> 00:34:01,039
LEE SOO-HO

480
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:09,338
Why do my words come out
with no filter anymore?

481
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:21,934
Are you heading home okay?

482
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:23,394
My sister

483
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:26,064
gave me free movie tickets.

484
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:29,192
If you have time

485
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:30,735
after the festival tomorrow,

486
00:34:30,818 --> 00:34:31,861
do you…

487
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:33,821
want to go watch a movie?

488
00:34:38,826 --> 00:34:39,911
READ

489
00:34:40,536 --> 00:34:41,621
He read them.

490
00:34:57,804 --> 00:34:59,764
Sure, let's do that.

491
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:02,934
Goodness.

492
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:06,229
-That scared me.
-What is she doing?

493
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:11,234
No way.

494
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:15,363
Lee Soo-ho likes me?

495
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:19,951
My gosh.

496
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:21,661
What do I do?

497
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:39,428
So what should we watch?

498
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:43,307
Is there anything you want to watch?

499
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:47,145
How about a horror movie?

500
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:13,838
I'LL SEE YOU…

501
00:36:13,921 --> 00:36:16,007
HAN SEO-JUN

502
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:21,429
Soo-ho, where are you?

503
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:26,893
You pulled a weird stunt, Soo-ho.

504
00:36:31,105 --> 00:36:31,939
Give me my key.

505
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:37,153
I like Lim Ju-kyung.

506
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:38,863
So?

507
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:40,448
Should I congratulate you?

508
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,575
Don't use her because of me.

509
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:44,785
What if I'm not using her?

510
00:36:45,828 --> 00:36:47,163
Then you mean it's for real?

511
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:48,664
Why?

512
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:50,750
Are you worried I might take her from you?

513
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:56,631
Mr. Han Jun-woo.

514
00:36:58,424 --> 00:36:59,592
Hello.

515
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:02,553
What brings you here?

516
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:04,972
-I'm here to collect my money.
-Excuse me?

517
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:08,309
You offered compensation.
I came to collect it myself.

518
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:10,519
Right.

519
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:12,855
Of course, I will give…

520
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:15,066
Well,

521
00:37:15,149 --> 00:37:16,734
I don't have any cash right now.

522
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:18,819
How much were you considering?

523
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:22,698
I'll use the money
you were going to pay me

524
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:23,991
to buy your time.

525
00:37:31,832 --> 00:37:33,125
The sun's gone down.

526
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:36,754
What do you want to do for two hours?

527
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:40,216
So…

528
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:43,052
you said you work at Move Entertainment?

529
00:37:44,553 --> 00:37:45,388
I did.

530
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:47,014
That's really amazing.

531
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:48,724
Well, I mean.

532
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:50,059
I don't know much,

533
00:37:50,142 --> 00:37:53,020
but some of my students
dream of becoming singers,

534
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:55,564
so I know that being
a part of the industry isn't easy.

535
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:59,068
Have you always wanted
to work in the entertainment industry?

536
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:01,445
I've never gotten that question before.

537
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:03,990
I usually get,
"Who have you met in person?"

538
00:38:04,073 --> 00:38:05,908
or "Is that rumor true?" and such.

539
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:08,744
I feel like I get to know
a person a little better

540
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:11,664
through the dreams that they've had.

541
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:15,710
Are you the Little Prince?

542
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:17,461
I'm not.

543
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:20,798
You have a rare innocence about you.

544
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:23,009
-Here are the dishes you ordered.
-Thank you.

545
00:38:27,763 --> 00:38:29,432
Didn't you order an oil-based pasta?

546
00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:31,976
I'm sorry. I'll get it prepared again.

547
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:34,353
That's okay. I can just have this.

548
00:38:35,938 --> 00:38:37,148
It looks good.

549
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:39,400
It actually looks better
than the one I ordered.

550
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:41,444
Thank you. Enjoy your food.

551
00:38:41,527 --> 00:38:42,445
Thank you.

552
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:44,363
Please, help yourself.

553
00:38:57,835 --> 00:39:00,087
Why did you do that
when you can't eat spicy food?

554
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:01,839
You should've let her switch it out.

555
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:04,592
-It's all right.
-What?

556
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:06,052
The part-timer was so young.

557
00:39:08,095 --> 00:39:09,889
Imagine her embarrassment.

558
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:16,437
You're quite high-maintenance.

559
00:39:19,565 --> 00:39:20,858
I'm sorry.

560
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:23,736
I spouted on you.

561
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:25,321
Your eye…

562
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:27,740
I'm sorry.

563
00:39:27,823 --> 00:39:28,991
It was a bit spicy…

564
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:31,577
Playing hard to get isn't in my nature.

565
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:35,122
I can't put on a mask to chat a guy up.

566
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:36,957
I'll be frank with you.

567
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:38,876
I've fallen for you.

568
00:39:40,002 --> 00:39:40,836
Excuse me?

569
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:43,547
-What?
-Look over there.

570
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:45,216
-Sure.
-Hey.

571
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:49,303
Who is that?

572
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:52,306
Who is she?

573
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:53,849
What's up with her face?

574
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:55,684
Why is everyone acting weird?

575
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:57,228
Is there something on my face?

576
00:39:58,354 --> 00:39:59,772
Who is that?

577
00:39:59,855 --> 00:40:00,689
What the heck?

578
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:04,026
Oh, no.

579
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:06,445
Did I come here
without wearing any makeup?

580
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:12,868
-What is that?
-What's happening?

581
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:34,390
To me,

582
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:36,684
even your bare face looks beautiful.

583
00:40:56,078 --> 00:40:57,121
It was a dream.

584
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:02,501
But a pig in a dream signifies good luck.

585
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:07,173
How great must my luck be

586
00:41:07,256 --> 00:41:10,050
to have dreamed of not just a pig,
but a pig on a white horse?

587
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:21,896
She reeks of alcohol.

588
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:28,402
You're all right, aren't you?

589
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:32,031
Yes, of course. I'm all right.

590
00:41:32,114 --> 00:41:33,949
Has she lost her mind?

591
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,246
Where's your sister?

592
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:40,581
She passed out drunk.

593
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:44,668
She works overtime and has
late-night staff dinners every day.

594
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:47,796
It'll catch up to her.
Should I get her some herbal medicine?

595
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:51,258
You're always worrying about the kids.
Take care of yourself too.

596
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:57,598
-By the way, Dad.
-Yes?

597
00:41:57,681 --> 00:41:59,850
What did you like about Mom
to have married her?

598
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:01,519
She's pretty.

599
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:03,270
What?

600
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:04,230
Seriously?

601
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:07,608
She looks pretty to you?

602
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:09,568
Even without any makeup? Look at her now.

603
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:11,153
Even in her current state?

604
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:14,406
Are you making fun of your mom
this early in the morning?

605
00:42:15,157 --> 00:42:17,701
It's just that Dad is as handsome
as Prince Charming,

606
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:20,704
so I wondered why he fell for you
instead of another princess.

607
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:25,000
To me, your mom was
as beautiful as Snow White.

608
00:42:26,293 --> 00:42:27,294
Seriously?

609
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:28,462
Not one of the dwarves?

610
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:29,588
She could be Grumpy.

611
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:31,632
I'll kill you.

612
00:42:33,342 --> 00:42:35,511
This face isn't pretty at all.

613
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:52,695
Maybe the contour of my face
has changed a little?

614
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:56,156
Goodness. I don't know.

615
00:42:56,865 --> 00:42:58,659
THE EIGHTH ANNUAL SAEBOM FESTIVAL

616
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:13,924
Put more energy into it!

617
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:16,302
-What?
-What is this?

618
00:43:16,385 --> 00:43:17,511
Did you see this?

619
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:18,596
What is it?

620
00:43:25,644 --> 00:43:27,563
So this is what a school festival is like.

621
00:43:27,646 --> 00:43:29,189
I missed out last year, so I had no idea.

622
00:43:30,983 --> 00:43:32,651
-Here's a balloon.
-Thank you.

623
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:33,777
It's my heart.

624
00:43:34,528 --> 00:43:36,739
My girlfriend is here.
My future girlfriend.

625
00:43:36,822 --> 00:43:38,115
Should I ask for her number?

626
00:43:43,078 --> 00:43:45,414
How about we watch Soul Voice?

627
00:43:45,998 --> 00:43:47,333
He's not reading my messages.

628
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:50,002
Is he still at home?

629
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:54,590
She looks awful.

630
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:57,259
-Who is she?
-Look at her makeup.

631
00:43:57,343 --> 00:43:58,552
Hey, isn't that Han Go-un?

632
00:43:58,636 --> 00:43:59,928
What's up with her face?

633
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:01,847
Go-un?

634
00:44:02,681 --> 00:44:05,017
No. That's not it, Go-un.

635
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:06,644
Hey, Go-un, is that--

636
00:44:08,354 --> 00:44:10,022
-Hey, look at her.
-Goodness.

637
00:44:10,105 --> 00:44:11,190
Who is she?

638
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:14,276
-Hey!
-Go easy!

639
00:44:20,032 --> 00:44:21,075
Time out.

640
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:23,494
Hey, Seo-jun.
Are you upset about something?

641
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:25,663
-I don't know.
-Hold on.

642
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:27,122
Don't leave. You're our front.

643
00:44:27,206 --> 00:44:29,208
-A front for what?
-You're our frontman.

644
00:44:29,291 --> 00:44:31,335
Girls line up when you're around.

645
00:44:31,418 --> 00:44:33,003
I'm gonna go see my baby.

646
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:34,004
Who's your baby?

647
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:35,005
Excuse me?

648
00:44:35,089 --> 00:44:37,633
-How do I play this?
-Who wants to throw water balloons?

649
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:44,264
I'm not confident since it's my first time
doing someone else's makeup,

650
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:46,266
but let's give it a try.

651
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:49,728
We can't let those judgy girls
bring you down and ruin your performance.

652
00:44:49,812 --> 00:44:50,687
By the way…

653
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:53,607
do I look that weird?

654
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:56,193
You're pretty.

655
00:44:56,276 --> 00:44:59,488
You're pretty,
but let's touch it up a bit.

656
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:08,247
Even just shaping your brows

657
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:10,249
can make your features look more defined.

658
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:13,585
Let's use a taupe-colored eyeshadow

659
00:45:14,169 --> 00:45:16,338
to create some depth.

660
00:45:17,506 --> 00:45:20,259
For a glamorous look suitable for a stage,

661
00:45:20,342 --> 00:45:22,094
I'll add some glitter.

662
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:38,777
Don't be nervous, everyone.

663
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:40,404
Take a deep breath, then…

664
00:45:42,197 --> 00:45:43,282
Everything's fine.

665
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:47,619
By the way, where is Go-un? We're up next.

666
00:45:48,704 --> 00:45:52,166
Ma'am, I don't mind taking her place.

667
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:53,417
Ma'am.

668
00:45:54,376 --> 00:45:55,586
I'm here.

669
00:45:59,214 --> 00:46:02,301
-This counts as volunteer work, right?
-That's why we're all here.

670
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:04,553
You did say so.

671
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:06,096
You're here.

672
00:46:06,722 --> 00:46:07,723
Enjoy the show.

673
00:46:07,806 --> 00:46:08,849
Whatever.

674
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:10,476
Hi.

675
00:46:11,143 --> 00:46:13,896
-She's really pretty.
-What are you saying?

676
00:46:30,829 --> 00:46:31,914
Hey, who's that?

677
00:46:32,664 --> 00:46:34,833
I didn't know they had
such a pretty girl in the choir.

678
00:46:38,754 --> 00:46:42,966
-The world
-The world

679
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:48,222
-Abandoned me
-Abandoned me

680
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:53,894
-I wanted to believe
-I wanted to believe

681
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:58,482
-I was all alone
-I was all alone

682
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:04,154
-I knew it was
-I knew it was

683
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:09,243
-My own misunderstanding
-My own misunderstanding

684
00:47:09,326 --> 00:47:14,665
-Something I knew
-Something I knew

685
00:47:14,748 --> 00:47:20,587
-But had always avoided
-But had always avoided

686
00:47:21,338 --> 00:47:26,134
Like a lone flower blossoming

687
00:47:26,718 --> 00:47:31,557
In a wide open field

688
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:34,226
I've protected

689
00:47:34,309 --> 00:47:39,356
The feeling of emptiness

690
00:47:39,439 --> 00:47:42,317
Inside my heart

691
00:47:42,401 --> 00:47:47,239
-Like the sun coming out
-Like the sun coming out

692
00:47:47,322 --> 00:47:52,244
After heavy rain

693
00:47:52,327 --> 00:47:54,913
-My heart
-My heart

694
00:47:54,997 --> 00:47:58,166
-My surroundings
-My surroundings

695
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:03,088
-I'm trying to illuminate it all
-I'm trying to illuminate it all

696
00:48:03,171 --> 00:48:08,385
-To the countless hands
-To the countless hands

697
00:48:08,468 --> 00:48:13,682
-That have uplifted me
-That have uplifted me

698
00:48:13,765 --> 00:48:16,727
Like the sun

699
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:22,316
that illuminates me

700
00:48:23,275 --> 00:48:26,778
Become

701
00:48:27,529 --> 00:48:33,827
-A light
-A light

702
00:48:50,177 --> 00:48:51,762
Great work, everyone.

703
00:48:52,471 --> 00:48:54,640
You really proved your skills, Go-un.

704
00:48:54,723 --> 00:48:56,642
-You looked so pretty up there.
-Great job.

705
00:48:56,725 --> 00:48:57,851
Seriously.

706
00:48:58,352 --> 00:48:59,770
-You all did great.
-Ju-kyung!

707
00:49:00,437 --> 00:49:02,314
-Great work.
-Nice job.

708
00:49:02,397 --> 00:49:03,398
Ju-kyung.

709
00:49:04,024 --> 00:49:06,693
-That was seriously the best.
-Thank you so much.

710
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:08,236
I didn't do anything.

711
00:49:09,029 --> 00:49:10,155
Hey!

712
00:49:12,532 --> 00:49:13,617
Seo-jun?

713
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:16,912
You two know each other?

714
00:49:16,995 --> 00:49:18,413
How do you know my brother?

715
00:49:18,497 --> 00:49:19,539
Your brother?

716
00:49:20,749 --> 00:49:22,167
He's your brother?

717
00:49:23,502 --> 00:49:24,336
Ju-kyung!

718
00:49:24,878 --> 00:49:26,755
Ju-kyung, please help me out.

719
00:49:26,838 --> 00:49:28,715
Kangsu suddenly said she can't make it.

720
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:30,342
-I need you.
-Sure.

721
00:49:30,425 --> 00:49:32,678
-See you around, Go-un.
-Yes, Ju-kyung.

722
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:36,473
How do you know Ju-kyung?

723
00:49:39,559 --> 00:49:41,603
You look extra pretty today.

724
00:49:41,687 --> 00:49:43,313
Who are you trying to impress?

725
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:44,314
Actually…

726
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:48,026
No, I'll tell you later.

727
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:49,986
What's this? You're being a tease.

728
00:49:52,364 --> 00:49:53,990
Here. Take it.

729
00:49:56,034 --> 00:49:57,869
-A pig?
-Why? You don't like it?

730
00:49:58,453 --> 00:49:59,746
Want to be the bunny instead?

731
00:50:00,455 --> 00:50:02,666
No. I like the pig costume.

732
00:50:02,749 --> 00:50:04,376
-I love it.
-What was that then?

733
00:50:04,459 --> 00:50:07,671
Get changed and head to the courts.
I'll go pick up some sports drinks.

734
00:50:07,754 --> 00:50:08,755
-Okay.
-See you later.

735
00:50:23,895 --> 00:50:24,813
You're here!

736
00:50:25,605 --> 00:50:28,024
How did you sleep? How do you feel?

737
00:50:28,608 --> 00:50:30,610
Remember the girl
I told you about yesterday?

738
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:32,446
The girl who reminds me of the old me?

739
00:50:34,656 --> 00:50:35,866
Are you feeling all right?

740
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:39,619
Did something happen?

741
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:44,332
What's up with you?

742
00:50:45,667 --> 00:50:46,543
What?

743
00:50:47,294 --> 00:50:48,754
You said we'll go to the movies.

744
00:50:48,837 --> 00:50:50,255
Why would I watch a movie with you?

745
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:53,800
-What?
-Don't kid yourself.

746
00:50:54,384 --> 00:50:56,303
I was only being nice
because I pitied you.

747
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:03,101
Why would you…

748
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:05,812
pity me?

749
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:10,317
Because you know my secret?

750
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:16,031
You found me pitiable for kneeling
and groveling at your feet?

751
00:51:16,615 --> 00:51:17,449
I did.

752
00:51:19,034 --> 00:51:22,704
That's why you told me I look pretty
and looked out for me.

753
00:51:23,955 --> 00:51:26,291
Just like looking after stray cats,
you pitied me.

754
00:51:26,374 --> 00:51:27,209
I did.

755
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:30,378
But now it's bothersome and annoying.

756
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:32,714
I no longer…

757
00:51:33,673 --> 00:51:36,009
want to care about you anymore, so leave.

758
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:40,430
I never realized,
but you're meddlesome yourself.

759
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:43,058
I never asked you to look after me.

760
00:51:43,892 --> 00:51:45,435
I never asked you to care for me.

761
00:51:47,103 --> 00:51:48,980
I won't bother you anymore,

762
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:52,359
so you can stop your pity.

763
00:52:12,212 --> 00:52:15,215
It hasn't been long
since I've been living this dreamy life,

764
00:52:16,341 --> 00:52:17,676
yet I got too excited

765
00:52:17,759 --> 00:52:20,637
and went overboard,
dreaming of something I couldn't have.

766
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:23,557
It was nothing but a meaningless dream.

767
00:52:24,307 --> 00:52:25,684
I'm so stupid.

768
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:45,620
Don't use her because of me.

769
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:47,622
What if I'm not using her?

770
00:52:48,582 --> 00:52:50,041
Then you mean it's for real?

771
00:52:50,667 --> 00:52:51,501
Why?

772
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:53,628
Are you worried I might take her from you?

773
00:52:54,212 --> 00:52:56,339
I know you think Se-yeon died
because of me.

774
00:52:56,423 --> 00:52:58,091
That's not a thought. It's a fact.

775
00:52:58,174 --> 00:53:00,135
So how long will you take it out on me?

776
00:53:00,218 --> 00:53:01,303
Until you die…

777
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:04,723
and meet Se-yeon again.

778
00:53:13,189 --> 00:53:14,024
I see.

779
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:16,568
Does Ju-kyung know?

780
00:53:19,946 --> 00:53:21,364
That you killed your friend?

781
00:53:27,621 --> 00:53:29,331
What would she think of you
if she finds out?

782
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:33,460
Never forget.

783
00:53:34,836 --> 00:53:36,463
You killed Se-yeon,

784
00:53:38,089 --> 00:53:39,674
and you don't deserve to smile.

785
00:53:41,301 --> 00:53:42,636
You murderer.

786
00:53:55,774 --> 00:53:57,692
-I like blue.
-Blue?

787
00:53:57,776 --> 00:53:59,027
-What about you?
-I'll get…

788
00:53:59,110 --> 00:54:01,321
-No, it's mine.
-Does it look good?

789
00:54:02,572 --> 00:54:04,282
-Want to play a game?
-Want to play a game?

790
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:07,786
No. Let's just go.

791
00:54:07,869 --> 00:54:09,162
Let's go.

792
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:13,667
Hey, is this really necessary?

793
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:15,961
If we do this, it'll cheer up Seo-jun.

794
00:54:16,044 --> 00:54:18,213
-All right.
-I feel like he'll get more upset.

795
00:54:18,296 --> 00:54:21,591
-The game will start soon. Let's go.
-Come on, let's go!

796
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:24,302
-Go, Saebom Devils!
-Go, Saebom Devils!

797
00:54:24,386 --> 00:54:27,931
-Go, Saebom Devils!
-Go, Han Seo-jun!

798
00:54:33,436 --> 00:54:35,188
That's right! Seo-jun Almighty!

799
00:54:35,271 --> 00:54:37,899
-He's not on our team.
-I'm sorry.

800
00:54:37,983 --> 00:54:39,359
By the way, where's Lee Soo-ho?

801
00:54:39,901 --> 00:54:41,403
No idea. Maybe he's not here yet.

802
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:47,867
What? You're here?
You said you had tutoring today.

803
00:54:47,951 --> 00:54:49,327
I skipped and snuck out.

804
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:56,584
Limju, what took you so long? Come on.

805
00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:01,297
Go, my super handsome Tae-hoon!

806
00:55:03,299 --> 00:55:05,969
-Han Seo-jun!
-Han Seo-jun!

807
00:55:39,044 --> 00:55:42,297
SAEBOM DEVILS

808
00:56:01,316 --> 00:56:02,525
SAEBOM UNION

809
00:57:44,169 --> 00:57:45,086
Soo-ho!

810
00:57:56,931 --> 00:57:57,765
You were right.

811
00:57:59,392 --> 00:58:01,769
It's all because of me,
and it's all my fault.

812
00:58:03,104 --> 00:58:05,231
So you can take it out on me all you want.

813
00:58:05,315 --> 00:58:06,733
I'll take it.

814
00:58:10,361 --> 00:58:11,237
But

815
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:13,740
don't play Lim Ju-kyung.

816
00:58:16,451 --> 00:58:17,827
I won't hold back then.

817
00:58:33,801 --> 00:58:39,182
THE EIGHTH ANNUAL SAEBOM FESTIVAL
A NIGHT OF CELEBRATION

818
00:58:39,265 --> 00:58:43,520
I'm too generous in love…

819
00:58:44,312 --> 00:58:45,396
Hey, Limju!

820
00:58:46,022 --> 00:58:47,607
Shall we sit in the front or back?

821
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:49,651
I feel a little tired, so…

822
00:58:49,734 --> 00:58:52,153
Don't say you're leaving.

823
00:58:52,237 --> 00:58:55,198
The party's just getting started.
Where do you think you're going?

824
00:58:55,281 --> 00:58:57,951
Let's all leave after the concert.
Come on.

825
00:58:58,034 --> 00:58:59,202
Let's sit over there.

826
00:59:00,036 --> 00:59:02,956
While we drunkenly dance together

827
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:08,878
Everything falls out of my pockets

828
00:59:08,962 --> 00:59:13,132
But I'm still fine…

829
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:15,593
The next song is not well known,

830
00:59:15,677 --> 00:59:18,513
but it's from the late Jeong Se-yeon,
of whom I was a huge fan.

831
00:59:18,596 --> 00:59:20,807
In memory of Se-yeon,
who left us a year ago,

832
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:22,350
I dedicate this song to him.

833
00:59:22,433 --> 00:59:27,438
Because I can't yet forget…

834
00:59:27,522 --> 00:59:28,356
Jeong Se-yeon?

835
00:59:29,107 --> 00:59:32,318
Hey, that's the guy
who took his own life last year.

836
00:59:32,402 --> 00:59:33,695
Right.

837
00:59:34,737 --> 00:59:36,614
Why did they have to pick this song?

838
00:59:36,698 --> 00:59:39,284
I bet Seo-jun will start
another fight with Soo-ho.

839
00:59:39,367 --> 00:59:41,744
Why? Did he have something
to do with Jeong Se-yeon?

840
00:59:41,828 --> 00:59:43,037
Those three were close.

841
00:59:43,121 --> 00:59:45,498
Lee Soo-ho, Han Seo-jun,
and Jeong Se-yeon.

842
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:48,334
-Did Soo-ho never mention that?
-What?

843
00:59:48,418 --> 00:59:49,544
Right, they were.

844
00:59:49,627 --> 00:59:51,754
Now that I think of it, I think they were.

845
00:59:52,547 --> 00:59:55,383
I live and forget

846
00:59:55,967 --> 00:59:58,344
Pretending I'm fine

847
00:59:58,428 --> 01:00:02,181
I even meet with people

848
01:00:03,766 --> 01:00:06,311
At a certain point

849
01:00:06,978 --> 01:00:10,481
This bitter longing

850
01:00:10,565 --> 01:00:15,236
Became a habit

851
01:00:17,614 --> 01:00:18,698
SE-YEON

852
01:00:18,781 --> 01:00:20,450
ARE YOU DONE WITH PRACTICE?

853
01:00:21,117 --> 01:00:24,704
Reporter Choi, Mr. Lee is too busy
to be dating these days.

854
01:00:26,039 --> 01:00:28,458
He just had a few drinks
after the shoot, that's all.

855
01:00:29,125 --> 01:00:32,128
What do you mean by prostitution?
That's absurd.

856
01:00:33,338 --> 01:00:34,631
Of course not.

857
01:00:49,187 --> 01:00:55,943
JEONG SE-YEON

858
01:01:18,549 --> 01:01:21,678
-I heard Jeong Se-yeon killed himself.
-From the boy band? Goodness.

859
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:24,514
-You can't come in.
-Please leave.

860
01:01:53,793 --> 01:01:56,796
How are you doing?

861
01:01:56,879 --> 01:02:03,261
I guess I'm not doing well

862
01:02:04,053 --> 01:02:10,685
I'm stuck here without you
But I'm not alone

863
01:02:10,768 --> 01:02:15,189
On an island of regret…

864
01:02:15,273 --> 01:02:17,734
-I have to go.
-What?

865
01:02:17,817 --> 01:02:20,987
I didn't know the end would come

866
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:25,575
I didn't even know what love was

867
01:02:26,325 --> 01:02:30,913
A world in which I can't hold you

868
01:02:30,997 --> 01:02:32,874
Or see you…

869
01:02:32,957 --> 01:02:34,292
Soo-ho.

870
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:53,394
Are you all right?

871
01:02:55,354 --> 01:02:56,189
Leave.

872
01:02:58,483 --> 01:02:59,692
I said, leave!

873
01:03:32,517 --> 01:03:34,936
-Take off your jacket.
-It's chilly.

874
01:03:35,019 --> 01:03:36,896
-It's so cold.
-Give me your jacket.

875
01:03:36,979 --> 01:03:39,190
How do you know Ju-kyung?

876
01:03:39,273 --> 01:03:40,233
Well,

877
01:03:41,067 --> 01:03:43,736
she helped me out when I was in trouble.

878
01:03:44,737 --> 01:03:48,366
If weren't for her,
I probably couldn't have sung on stage.

879
01:03:48,449 --> 01:03:50,535
She even did my makeup.

880
01:03:50,618 --> 01:03:51,786
Don't I look good?

881
01:03:51,869 --> 01:03:53,246
Don't play Lim Ju-kyung.

882
01:03:54,956 --> 01:03:56,499
I won't hold back then.

883
01:03:56,582 --> 01:03:57,875
It's too cold.

884
01:03:57,959 --> 01:04:01,295
Seo-jun, what are you thinking about?

885
01:04:01,379 --> 01:04:03,631
You were thinking about that girl,
weren't you?

886
01:04:03,714 --> 01:04:04,966
No.

887
01:04:06,968 --> 01:04:08,261
I haven't been considerate.

888
01:04:08,845 --> 01:04:09,679
What?

889
01:04:12,473 --> 01:04:13,599
I feel sorry…

890
01:04:14,725 --> 01:04:16,102
for no reason.

891
01:04:18,437 --> 01:04:20,064
-Hey, wait up!
-Where are you going?

892
01:04:22,316 --> 01:04:24,485
-You're going to come like this?
-Han Seo-jun.

893
01:04:24,569 --> 01:04:26,571
All our clothes got wet because of you.

894
01:04:26,654 --> 01:04:28,656
-We got all wet.
-We even cheered for you!

895
01:04:28,739 --> 01:04:29,574
Don't follow me.

896
01:04:30,241 --> 01:04:33,119
If you follow me, you're dead.
I'm telling you now.

897
01:04:33,202 --> 01:04:35,663
-Why not?
-But I love you, Seo-jun!

898
01:04:44,130 --> 01:04:46,382
So he was a friend of Jeong Se-yeon.

899
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:51,554
What happened to him earlier?

900
01:04:52,638 --> 01:04:54,223
Was he not feeling well?

901
01:05:06,235 --> 01:05:09,238
Whatever. It's none of my business.

902
01:05:20,708 --> 01:05:22,168
Are you asleep, Ju-kyung?

903
01:05:23,169 --> 01:05:24,170
No.

904
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:26,839
Then wash up before bed,
even if you're tired.

905
01:05:27,548 --> 01:05:28,466
Got it?

906
01:05:32,678 --> 01:05:33,721
He's right.

907
01:05:35,389 --> 01:05:37,850
I should at least remove my makeup
before going to bed.

908
01:05:50,363 --> 01:05:52,031
Where have I seen this before?

909
01:06:04,335 --> 01:06:05,836
That time on the rooftop…

910
01:06:16,305 --> 01:06:17,598
That man was…

911
01:06:21,394 --> 01:06:22,853
Lee Soo-ho?

912
01:06:26,232 --> 01:06:27,441
Did someone you know

913
01:06:28,818 --> 01:06:30,903
jump from a rooftop?

914
01:06:32,905 --> 01:06:36,158
We don't even know each other,
but you saved me and got so angry.

915
01:06:36,242 --> 01:06:38,786
That's why I wondered
if someone close to you had died.

916
01:06:49,255 --> 01:06:51,590
Haven't you thought of
the people you'd leave behind

917
01:06:52,842 --> 01:06:54,677
and how much they would grieve?

918
01:06:55,344 --> 01:06:58,806
Someone out there
might suffer forever with guilt

919
01:06:59,598 --> 01:07:01,767
for failing to save you.

920
01:07:03,561 --> 01:07:06,731
There's nothing you can do
for a dead person.

921
01:07:08,524 --> 01:07:09,608
So don't do it.

922
01:09:01,178 --> 01:09:02,263
It was here…

923
01:09:05,224 --> 01:09:06,183
From here…

924
01:09:09,186 --> 01:09:10,437
Se-yeon…

925
01:09:14,525 --> 01:09:15,401
I know.

926
01:09:16,110 --> 01:09:17,111
Se-yeon…

927
01:09:23,033 --> 01:09:23,951
I know.

928
01:09:25,786 --> 01:09:27,121
I understand.

929
01:10:43,322 --> 01:10:45,157
Someone told me

930
01:10:45,241 --> 01:10:48,035
that tears cleanse the heart.

931
01:10:49,370 --> 01:10:51,455
A friend of Jeong Se-yeon,

932
01:10:51,538 --> 01:10:52,790
and the son of Lee Ju-hun.

933
01:10:52,873 --> 01:10:54,917
Why does he have so many secrets?

934
01:10:56,377 --> 01:10:58,337
You're home, sweetie?

935
01:10:59,380 --> 01:11:01,382
You are so awesome.

936
01:11:01,465 --> 01:11:04,385
This is Han Seo-jun's girlfriend?

937
01:11:05,094 --> 01:11:07,888
Why? Did you help me again
because you pitied me?

938
01:11:07,972 --> 01:11:09,306
It was them, right?

939
01:11:09,974 --> 01:11:11,267
You must've been so shocked.

940
01:11:12,559 --> 01:11:16,897
