1
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:35,994
Okay, understood.

2
00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:36,953
Sir.

3
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:39,664
-What is it?
-Did you really have to take it this far?

4
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:43,251
-Ms. Lim, what do you think you're doing?
-I get why you wouldn't like it.

5
00:00:43,334 --> 00:00:46,129
People talking about Se-yeon again.

6
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:50,383
But still, you'd steal a song from him
just to hide your own wrongdoing?

7
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:53,052
-What is she saying?
-It's nothing, sir.

8
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:57,599
Do you think he has time to deal
with every new artist?

9
00:00:57,682 --> 00:00:59,017
Come on. Let's talk outside.

10
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,061
Let go. I said, let go of me!

11
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:09,402
BASED ON WEBTOON TRUE BEAUTY
BY YAONGYI

12
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:15,116
Just to hide a picture of you
taken with a young actress,

13
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,077
you ran stories about Se-yeon's bullying.

14
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:21,039
If you actually felt bad
for Se-yeon's death,

15
00:01:21,122 --> 00:01:22,415
you shouldn't have done this.

16
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:26,252
Even if the copyright isn't registered,
this is clearly plagiarism!

17
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,006
How dare you come into my office
and speak such nonsense!

18
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:31,925
Get out.

19
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:35,345
Se-yeon and Leo are only 18.

20
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:37,555
You even have a son yourself.

21
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:40,433
If you feel even a twinge of guilt
toward kids your son's age,

22
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:42,602
take the song down and make things right.

23
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:45,730
Rather than having it revealed
by my whistleblowing,

24
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:48,024
it would look much better
if you dealt with it yourself.

25
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:52,487
So,

26
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:54,948
are you blackmailing me?

27
00:01:56,157 --> 00:01:57,617
Think of it however you want.

28
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:00,578
I said what I said, at the risk of my job.

29
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:02,580
Get out. Have you gone mad?

30
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:04,541
I'll get out myself.

31
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:22,183
Soo-ho.

32
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:26,980
Soo-ho.

33
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:33,611
Hey, Lee Soo-ho!

34
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:35,488
Did you hear?

35
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:37,323
The new song that came out from Move--

36
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:39,617
That prick.

37
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:40,535
Hey!

38
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:42,120
Lee Soo-ho!

39
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:54,090
Hey. What do you think?

40
00:02:54,173 --> 00:02:55,967
Isn't it nice? Want to get one each?

41
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:58,761
-It does look nice.
-Matching items are childish.

42
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,597
Come on, try it. I'll help you.

43
00:03:04,183 --> 00:03:05,435
There you go.

44
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:06,686
Come on, take a look.

45
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:11,190
Guys, you can never take this off, okay?

46
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:12,317
The same goes for you.

47
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:40,678
-Congratulations and celebrations!
-Congratulations and celebrations!

48
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:44,057
-Big congratulations on your debut!
-Big congratulations on your debut!

49
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,225
Congratulations.

50
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:47,518
Why didn't you tell me
about your debut, punk?

51
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:48,728
I felt bad, so…

52
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:49,896
What's there to feel bad about?

53
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:52,690
You started training first,
so of course, you debuted first.

54
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:54,484
Congratulations, Jeong Se-yeon!

55
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:57,487
-Come here!
-Guys, this isn't necessary.

56
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,280
-Nice!
-Got it.

57
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:01,324
Leo. How does that sound? Nice, right?

58
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:02,283
Leo.

59
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:03,660
It sounds perfect for Soo-ho.

60
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:05,495
Leo.

61
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:06,412
Se-yeon.

62
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:09,415
When I debut,
you'll give me this song, okay?

63
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,502
-Why would we give it to you?
-What?

64
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:15,421
-I'm going to sing it with you.
-Says who?

65
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:18,174
-Well, I should hear how you sound first.
-What?

66
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,801
Is this an audition?

67
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:22,053
-What?
-An audition.

68
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:25,056
-Great.
-As I close my eyes

69
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:29,435
The sight of you grows clearer

70
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,939
I long even more

71
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:36,567
For your bright light

72
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:42,949
You used to spend long nights here

73
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:47,495
It's where I'll briefly rest

74
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:51,374
And stay by your side

75
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:54,002
"STARLIGHT"

76
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:59,215
Borne out of my weary tears

77
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:05,805
Reaches the sky

78
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:09,267
Approach me slowly

79
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:13,646
Like a neverending dream

80
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:19,485
As a star by my side

81
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:21,195
Hurry.

82
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,414
EMERGENCY ROOM

83
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:38,129
Soo-ho!

84
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,257
Soo-ho!

85
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,967
Please let me in, Soo-ho.

86
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,552
Soo-ho!

87
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:47,221
Just this once, please.

88
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:49,766
Soo-ho!

89
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:51,851
-Isn't that Jeong Se-yeon?
-Jeong Se-yeon?

90
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:53,603
-Who's that?
-That school bully.

91
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:55,146
The kid who was trending online?

92
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:57,774
-It blew up.
-But what's he doing here?

93
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:00,443
SE-YEON

94
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:01,861
ARE YOU DONE WITH YOUR PRACTICE?

95
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:05,531
Reporter Choi, Mr. Lee is too busy
to be dating these days.

96
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,786
He just had a few drinks
after the shoot, that's all.

97
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:12,330
What do you mean by prostitution?
That's absurd.

98
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:15,458
Of course not.

99
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:33,226
JEONG SE-YEON

100
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:38,898
WAS NSIX'S JEONG SE-YEON A BULLY?

101
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,401
SCHOOL BULLIES SHOULD ALL DIE

102
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:44,112
WE SHOULD BURY HIM.
DOESN'T HE FEEL REMORSE?

103
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:45,738
HIS AGENCY KICKED HIM OUT
SO IT MUST BE TRUE

104
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:47,323
CHIN UP, VICTIMS.
THE TRUTH ALWAYS COMES OUT.

105
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,621
But I wasn't a bully.

106
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:58,000
I never did such a thing.

107
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:00,461
I'm innocent.

108
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:33,369
-I heard Jeong Se-yeon killed himself.
-From the boy band? Goodness.

109
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,205
-You can't come in.
-Please leave.

110
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:13,784
BOYFRIEND

111
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:30,134
The person you are trying to reach is…

112
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:49,362
Ju-kyung.

113
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:52,323
-What are you doing here at this hour?
-Well…

114
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:54,992
I came here to tell you something.

115
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:57,495
Tell me something?

116
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:01,457
I thought I shouldn't drag it out longer.

117
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:05,753
Su-jin, the thing is…

118
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,841
I'm dating Soo-ho.

119
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:16,305
I like him a lot too.

120
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:23,646
I really wasn't trying
to hide it from you.

121
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,691
I wanted to tell you before anyone else.

122
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:30,027
But after you told me you liked him,

123
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,072
I couldn't bring myself to tell you.

124
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:37,243
I thought the truth would
make us grow distant.

125
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,206
I didn't want to lose you.

126
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:46,043
But…

127
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:49,714
I couldn't continue deceiving you.

128
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:52,174
I'm really sorry.

129
00:09:58,389 --> 00:09:59,473
Okay.

130
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:03,102
I'd be lying
if I told you everything was fine.

131
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:04,937
I'm upset.

132
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:07,023
I'm sorry.

133
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:08,357
But,

134
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:12,445
this isn't the first time
I've had feelings for Soo-ho.

135
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:15,406
The feelings quickly died down then.

136
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:19,535
When you're friends for a long time,
your mind can play tricks

137
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:21,537
and get confused sometimes.

138
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:25,041
That's how it is for me.

139
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:27,752
You don't need to feel so bad.

140
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:30,546
-Su-jin…
-Come on.

141
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,966
Seeing you upset like this
makes me feel bad for telling you.

142
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:34,884
Don't cry.

143
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:38,262
You didn't do anything wrong.

144
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:39,555
Lift your chin up.

145
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:41,641
I'm sorry.

146
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:44,143
I'm really sorry.

147
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:49,899
If Soo-ho likes you,

148
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:52,401
what can I do?

149
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:56,155
If I can sort out my feelings,

150
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:58,491
you and Soo-ho,

151
00:10:58,574 --> 00:10:59,700
you and me…

152
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:01,494
can all stay the same.

153
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:34,527
I look uglier swollen like this.

154
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:48,874
BOYFRIEND

155
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:56,590
The person you are trying to reach is…

156
00:11:58,342 --> 00:12:00,344
Is he still that upset?

157
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:06,058
Did he get into an accident
because of what I said?

158
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:10,729
Why aren't you inside?

159
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:12,189
I felt stifled.

160
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,151
Why are you coming out?
Go inside, you'll catch a cold.

161
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:18,320
I felt stifled too. I needed some air.

162
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:20,322
Is everything all right?

163
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:22,158
Not really.

164
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:25,161
Hee-kyung,

165
00:12:25,744 --> 00:12:27,830
what's wrong with me?

166
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:29,832
What do you mean?

167
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:32,334
Every time something comes up,

168
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:35,087
I get scared for no reason
and try to hide.

169
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:37,506
Things keep getting messed up,

170
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:40,426
and I end up hurting people
for no good reason.

171
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:44,138
It would have been better
if I'd opened up from the beginning.

172
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:48,350
It's too bad
that I act too rashly sometimes,

173
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,187
and that you have so much fear.

174
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,773
You can try to open up more from now on.

175
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:58,694
Look at Dad, for example.

176
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:01,780
He could've told us right off the bat
about being scammed.

177
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:03,532
He tried to handle it on his own,

178
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:06,035
putting things on credit cards
and accumulating debt.

179
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:09,038
In the end, he cost us our house,
landing us back here, you know?

180
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,710
I'm sorry, my daughters.

181
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,754
Dad.

182
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:19,048
Jeez, he's going to cry again.

183
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:20,466
How long was he there for?

184
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:22,009
He should've made a noise or something.

185
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:23,802
Right.

186
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:27,181
Didn't you say you're friends
with my CEO's son?

187
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:28,557
Lee Soo-ho, right?

188
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,476
Yes, why do you ask?

189
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:32,645
He got into a car accident
in front of the company.

190
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:33,812
What?

191
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:36,232
A car accident?

192
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:16,605
Soo-ho.

193
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:19,817
Soo-ho.

194
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:12,786
It's all right if you go.

195
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:16,373
With you two around,
I can't even relax properly.

196
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:17,917
How can we just leave you?

197
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,627
Your cast must give you trouble.

198
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:22,129
-Don't worry. I'll just be asleep anyway.
-Goodness.

199
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:23,422
Jeez, you are so stubborn.

200
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:27,051
Then I'll be back early tomorrow
with some things you might need.

201
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:28,677
You should have been more careful.

202
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:29,720
We were so scared.

203
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:31,931
-All right, I need to sleep.
-Okay.

204
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:34,183
Well, call me if something comes up!

205
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:35,476
-Will do.
-Okay, bye.

206
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:58,666
Is Soo-ho all right?

207
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:01,794
Explain everything Ms. Lim said earlier.

208
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:04,004
Well,

209
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:04,922
the thing is…

210
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:09,593
I ran the story last year
to cover up your dating rumors…

211
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:11,512
What?

212
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:23,816
Nothing happened with her.

213
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,528
Why would I date someone that young?

214
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:30,948
We live in the same building,
so after the event,

215
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:32,074
I gave her a ride home.

216
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:35,619
They're saying your living arrangement
is further proof,

217
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:38,539
and that the story will run
as an exclusive Monday morning.

218
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:41,709
Stop them.

219
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:43,919
What would Soo-ho think of me?

220
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,505
He barely talks to me as it is.

221
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:52,219
Such a story wouldn't help
with the upcoming merger either.

222
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:54,555
Pay them off
or use whatever means necessary.

223
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:57,224
I'll see to it.

224
00:16:57,891 --> 00:16:58,726
But still.

225
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:01,687
How can you make a trade
with one of our own artists?

226
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:04,690
I really believed he was a bully.

227
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:07,901
Comments kept cropping up saying
that he'd gone to juvie

228
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:10,946
but changed his name and transferred
when he was in middle school.

229
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,573
I even confirmed the facts.

230
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:15,200
But I only found out
that Se-yeon was falsely charged…

231
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:17,953
for the bullying
by his school's delinquents…

232
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:20,914
after the correction was published.

233
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:24,918
You should have reported it to me, then!
How could you hide it until now?

234
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:27,254
Se-yeon was already dead then.

235
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:29,798
What would be the point?

236
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:32,051
Also,

237
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:33,635
the validity did not matter.

238
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:36,680
The rumors were out already
and the story was bound to blow up.

239
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:39,933
What's the big deal
if I disclosed it earlier?

240
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,229
Shut your mouth.

241
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:46,148
The kid killed himself because of that.

242
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,025
Do you still not get it?

243
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:50,903
And what? Plagiarism?

244
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:53,322
You took a song from the dead kid?

245
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:14,093
Soo-ho.

246
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:17,304
Soo-ho!

247
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,600
Were you badly injured?

248
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:24,019
I'm sorry.

249
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:26,522
I got mad at you over nothing.

250
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:30,651
I'm sorry. Open your eyes, please?

251
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:41,954
Who are you?

252
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:48,377
I asked, who are you?

253
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:55,884
-Who are you?
-Hey, Sis!

254
00:18:58,679 --> 00:18:59,972
Soo-ho!

255
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:04,101
Sis?

256
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:05,769
You have a sister?

257
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:10,023
She's a cousin.

258
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:14,862
When did you get here?

259
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:17,364
Well…

260
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:18,282
Just now.

261
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,376
Don't cry.

262
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:31,086
I'm all right.

263
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,546
I didn't get hurt badly.

264
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:36,091
Sis.

265
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:37,718
What a relief.

266
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:41,305
I kept calling you, but you didn't answer.

267
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:44,016
So I thought you got hurt pretty bad.

268
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:45,851
I lost my cell phone in the accident.

269
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:48,770
I see.

270
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:55,611
I guess you're pretty close
with your cousin.

271
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:58,447
She's crying her eyes out
over you wearing a cast.

272
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,866
-We've always been close.
-I see.

273
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,411
Well, you should get some rest.

274
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:06,038
Are you leaving already?

275
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:09,124
He's right. Stay a bit longer
since you came all the way here.

276
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:10,542
Sis.

277
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:12,711
That's okay. I'll be off.

278
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:17,925
Cousin?

279
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:26,683
What's going on?

280
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:28,477
He got into an accident with Seo-jun?

281
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:31,146
How did that happen?

282
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:34,274
Anyway, it seemed he broke his leg.

283
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,361
Should I go back
to see his face real quick?

284
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,947
No. I should just--

285
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:44,409
What is she doing
sitting on the patient's lap?

286
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,413
-I'm sorry.
-Wait.

287
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:51,208
Let's stay like this for a bit.

288
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:03,428
I was dying to see you.

289
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:11,270
You're hurt.

290
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:12,229
It's all right.

291
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:17,985
Seeing you makes me feel all better.

292
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:30,831
I really feel better.

293
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:33,208
Where did this punk go?

294
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:41,049
Whatever.

295
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:43,802
Who cares if he gets the shot or not.

296
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:47,180
Whether he's hurting or not.

297
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:58,275
I'm sorry about losing my temper then.

298
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:03,613
I'm sorry too.

299
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:05,324
I won't do that again.

300
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:07,451
Please forgive me.

301
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:09,411
I won't either.

302
00:22:10,203 --> 00:22:11,038
Forgive me.

303
00:22:13,373 --> 00:22:16,460
Anyway, what happened?
How did you get into an accident?

304
00:22:21,214 --> 00:22:22,257
Ju-kyung,

305
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:25,052
what do I do?

306
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:30,265
Se-yeon…

307
00:22:45,822 --> 00:22:46,865
I'm going

308
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:49,993
to steal your girl no matter what.

309
00:22:55,248 --> 00:22:56,083
You're too slow.

310
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:59,753
I'm not making the sound with my mouth.

311
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,593
Where have you been at this hour?

312
00:23:08,845 --> 00:23:09,763
What the heck?

313
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:14,559
You're way too slow.

314
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:35,914
Sleep well. I'll visit you again tomorrow.

315
00:23:37,415 --> 00:23:38,416
Right.

316
00:23:40,043 --> 00:23:41,545
He said he lost his phone.

317
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:53,849
Close the window, will you?

318
00:23:57,185 --> 00:23:58,270
I said, close it.

319
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:07,946
How did I get here?

320
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:20,041
Why did you run in?

321
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:22,294
That got you hurt too.

322
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:24,963
I didn't run in for you.

323
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,679
Your dad thinks that I'm Leo.

324
00:24:32,762 --> 00:24:35,182
They said something about a tribute album,

325
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:36,516
and now what?

326
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:42,439
What exactly did you say to your dad
when you bought all those instruments?

327
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:45,609
Had you told him earlier,
this wouldn't have happened.

328
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:49,070
Aren't you upset at all?

329
00:24:55,785 --> 00:24:58,496
Just to hide your picture
taken with a young actress,

330
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:00,582
you ran stories about Se-yeon's bullying.

331
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:04,044
You'd steal a song from him
just to hide your own wrongdoing?

332
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:19,643
Ju-kyung.

333
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:21,311
Su-jin.

334
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:23,813
How did you sleep?

335
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:26,816
What was that? You sounded like a robot.

336
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:29,069
Why are you being so awkward?

337
00:25:29,152 --> 00:25:30,779
Was I? I didn't mean to.

338
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:31,863
Don't be like that.

339
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:33,865
I don't want things
to be weird between us.

340
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:36,618
You tied your hair up today. I did too.

341
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:37,702
Look.

342
00:25:39,412 --> 00:25:40,664
It looks pretty.

343
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:42,540
Let's go.

344
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:47,629
By the way,
can we have the study session today?

345
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:50,006
I have to have
a make-up tutoring session tomorrow.

346
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:51,299
But Soo-ho…

347
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:52,717
What about him?

348
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:56,304
Soo-ho can't make it today.

349
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:57,555
He's in the hospital.

350
00:25:58,306 --> 00:25:59,975
What? When did this happen?

351
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:02,477
He got into an accident
while he was with Seo-jun yesterday.

352
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,187
Why are you telling me just now?

353
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:05,814
What?

354
00:26:08,483 --> 00:26:09,442
That is…

355
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:12,153
-I just found out last night…
-Did he get hurt badly?

356
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:13,488
Where did he get hurt?

357
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:19,869
Never mind. I'll just ask him myself.

358
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:22,747
Go ahead. I need to hand in my homework
at the teachers' office.

359
00:26:23,581 --> 00:26:24,416
Okay.

360
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:45,437
I brought your underwear first.

361
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:49,941
How are you feeling?

362
00:26:54,362 --> 00:26:57,532
If you're uncomfortable,
I'll have someone take care of you.

363
00:26:57,615 --> 00:26:58,575
That's not necessary.

364
00:27:00,618 --> 00:27:01,953
And please don't come here.

365
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:04,789
Soo-ho, what you heard yesterday…

366
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:06,541
Seo-jun, Mom's here!

367
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:08,043
Goodness.

368
00:27:08,626 --> 00:27:09,836
Hello.

369
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:13,882
Hello.

370
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:18,219
We'll talk later.

371
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:35,862
-Here.
-Thanks.

372
00:27:35,945 --> 00:27:37,197
-Hey, Su-jin.
-Yes?

373
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,449
I'm sorry, but can you
tidy up the kids' notes?

374
00:27:39,532 --> 00:27:40,575
Sure.

375
00:27:40,658 --> 00:27:41,659
Okay, new student.

376
00:27:42,243 --> 00:27:45,330
Go wait in your class.
The class president's been notified.

377
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:47,874
-You'll be shown to your seat.
-Thank you.

378
00:27:47,957 --> 00:27:49,000
Okay.

379
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:51,669
Hey, Mr. Han.

380
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:54,756
Isn't there a girl
from Yongpa High in your class too?

381
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:55,965
Do you mean Ju-kyung?

382
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:57,675
Yes, she's from Yongpa High.

383
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:59,260
Well, that school's not that far.

384
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:01,388
Why are so many kids
transferring from there?

385
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:04,391
I guess it tracks.

386
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:07,936
I heard that school has so many bad kids.

387
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:08,937
Gosh.

388
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,313
Come on, sir.

389
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:12,107
The kids must have their own reasons.

390
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:26,121
-I want meat, not this.
-Just eat whatever I give you.

391
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:28,456
Good boy.

392
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:31,376
-You're eating so well, my baby.
-I'm hardly a baby.

393
00:28:31,459 --> 00:28:34,504
This reminds me of
how I fed you when you were little.

394
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:37,674
How did my Leaky grow up so fast?

395
00:28:38,591 --> 00:28:39,801
Hey, Soo-ho,

396
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:41,136
did you know?

397
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:43,596
When Seo-jun was young,
his nickname was Leaky.

398
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,014
"Leaky"?

399
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:46,933
He wasn't potty trained until much later

400
00:28:47,016 --> 00:28:49,519
and would wet his bed at night,
so we called him Leaky.

401
00:28:49,602 --> 00:28:50,895
Why are you telling him that?

402
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:51,813
Let's see.

403
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:53,231
Was it until you were ten?

404
00:28:53,314 --> 00:28:54,315
Wait.

405
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,776
You wet the bed once or twice
in the fifth grade.

406
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,903
-Stop it, Mom.
-Gosh.

407
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:01,698
What's there to be embarrassed about?

408
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:04,325
You're best friends
who used to go to the sauna together.

409
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:08,413
Anyway, how did you get
into an accident together?

410
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:11,666
You guys haven't been hanging out lately,
as if you two had a fight.

411
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:14,127
And Soo-ho,

412
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:16,755
when you visited me
after I had my surgery,

413
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:19,340
you insisted that I never tell
Seo-jun about your visit.

414
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:22,260
I thought it was weird then too.

415
00:29:22,343 --> 00:29:23,428
It's not like that.

416
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:25,597
How are you feeling these days?

417
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:28,433
I feel great.
That's why I can come around like this.

418
00:29:28,516 --> 00:29:30,727
-You said you need to go to work.
-All right.

419
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:32,228
Here, have this first.

420
00:29:33,646 --> 00:29:34,773
Come on. Good boy.

421
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:36,858
Are you done?

422
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:38,693
I'm going to take this out.

423
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:46,201
Are you done too?
Do you want me to take it out for you?

424
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:47,202
I'm all right.

425
00:29:48,411 --> 00:29:50,455
You should take care of Leaky over there.

426
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:51,498
Hey!

427
00:29:56,419 --> 00:29:57,587
I've still got my feet.

428
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:10,099
What's wrong?

429
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:11,142
What?

430
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,312
-You've got a problem?
-No.

431
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:15,730
Okay, then.

432
00:30:17,106 --> 00:30:17,941
Hey, Soo-ho.

433
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:21,110
Never mind.

434
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:24,364
I can't wait. The bathroom…

435
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:26,783
-The bathroom?
-I need to pee.

436
00:30:28,117 --> 00:30:29,577
Leaky, indeed.

437
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:33,039
-Why are you telling me?
-Then who else do I tell?

438
00:30:33,122 --> 00:30:34,624
Call the nurse, Leaky.

439
00:30:34,707 --> 00:30:37,293
Hey, how can I ask the nurse
to take my pants off?

440
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:39,546
Hello.

441
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:41,339
I would like to switch rooms.

442
00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:43,842
-Is there an empty room available?
-Hey!

443
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:04,654
-Babe,
-Yes?

444
00:31:04,737 --> 00:31:07,240
I heard that Soo-ho and Seo-jun
weren't hurt in an accident,

445
00:31:07,323 --> 00:31:09,033
but that it was because they brawled.

446
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:10,285
-Really?
-Yes.

447
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:12,036
It's weird they were
hospitalized together.

448
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,371
That's what the rumors say.

449
00:31:13,454 --> 00:31:14,664
Who do you think won?

450
00:31:14,747 --> 00:31:16,165
It really was a car accident.

451
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:18,918
My sister saw it
because it happened in front of her work.

452
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:22,714
It wasn't that they fought
in front of your sister's work?

453
00:31:22,797 --> 00:31:24,299
She said it wasn't like that.

454
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:26,467
Shouldn't we visit Soo-ho at the hospital?

455
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:28,469
-Should we? We could all go tomorrow.
-Yes.

456
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:31,848
-I'm going to be late for work. Bye!
-What? Okay, bye, Limju!

457
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:33,141
Work hard, Lim Ju-kyung!

458
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:37,228
-Lim Ju-kyung?
-Let's go!

459
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:43,526
Hi.

460
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:46,446
-Hi.
-Who's this beauty?

461
00:31:46,529 --> 00:31:48,656
Hi, but who are you?

462
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,366
-Why are you replying?
-Come on.

463
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:52,118
-Did you get introduced?
-Who is she?

464
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:55,455
Hey, I'm embarrassed to ask you this…

465
00:31:55,538 --> 00:31:57,665
-Ask what?
-Your number.

466
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:00,668
-Congratulations.
-It's 010-262--

467
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:01,794
Do you know Han Seo-jun?

468
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:05,798
Han Seo-jun?
He didn't come to school today.

469
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:07,383
I've been waiting, but he didn't show.

470
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:09,677
-But compared to that Seo-jun, I'm--
-Hey, Joo Hye-min!

471
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:12,347
Why is that bitch here?

472
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:14,474
-Hey, come on.
-Let's step back.

473
00:32:14,557 --> 00:32:16,809
-What the heck?
-Step back, man.

474
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:23,149
Gosh, you transferred to Saebom High?

475
00:32:23,232 --> 00:32:25,568
You snitched on us bullying you,
then bailed.

476
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:27,528
But you only made it this far?

477
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:29,197
-Gosh.
-You stupid bitch.

478
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:32,116
We got detention
because of your crazy ass.

479
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:34,661
-Seriously!
-Hey, stop it.

480
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:38,706
Joo Hye-min,
you want to get away from us, right?

481
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:41,376
Answer me, bitch.

482
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:46,130
Then, if you do as I say,

483
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:47,632
I'll kindly let you go.

484
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:49,717
Can you do that?

485
00:32:51,594 --> 00:32:52,553
Yes.

486
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:55,723
There's someone called
Lim Ju-kyung at your school.

487
00:32:57,850 --> 00:33:00,603
-Ju-kyung?
-Yes, her name's the same as the Dumpling.

488
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:04,273
Find out if she's really
dating Han Seo-jun.

489
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:07,819
You're not answering?

490
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:10,238
Okay. I will.

491
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:13,533
Good. Update me regularly.

492
00:33:13,616 --> 00:33:14,784
You know what'll happen

493
00:33:15,284 --> 00:33:16,953
if you ignore my texts, right?

494
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:31,509
Soo-ho!

495
00:33:34,053 --> 00:33:35,138
You're here.

496
00:33:37,473 --> 00:33:38,641
On a blind date, are we?

497
00:33:39,308 --> 00:33:42,520
Jeez. How did you get hurt?
You should have kept your eyes open.

498
00:33:42,603 --> 00:33:43,896
You didn't have to come.

499
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,606
I was worried about you.

500
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:50,236
It's an air-purifying plant.
It doesn't need to be watered often.

501
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:54,574
I heard you said
you don't need a caregiver.

502
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:56,951
Your dad asked me to get you things,

503
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,578
so I brought items you might need.

504
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:02,248
Face wash, toner…

505
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:06,044
I brought your laptop too.

506
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:08,379
Thanks.

507
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:09,297
You're welcome.

508
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:12,133
Thanks, Seo-jun.

509
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:14,927
I heard you got hurt
trying to save Soo-ho.

510
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:17,555
Why would you say thanks?
You're not even his girlfriend.

511
00:34:17,638 --> 00:34:19,557
If you don't want it, I take it back.

512
00:34:20,933 --> 00:34:23,144
Do you need to keep your cast on for long?

513
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:24,771
You don't need surgery, do you?

514
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,108
-Wait.
-It's all right.

515
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:34,572
Don't they have a private room?

516
00:34:35,114 --> 00:34:38,159
-Want me to ask my dad for a transfer?
-No thanks. Here.

517
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:40,369
Thanks.

518
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:41,788
Don't you have academy today?

519
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:42,997
I'm going to go later.

520
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:44,999
Trying to send me away already?

521
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:46,834
-Typical.
-Why did you come here alone?

522
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:48,878
Where's Ju-kyung?

523
00:34:49,712 --> 00:34:52,006
-What?
-Aren't you two best friends?

524
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:54,133
You're inseparable,
so it's odd to see you alone.

525
00:34:55,134 --> 00:34:56,385
She has work today.

526
00:34:57,303 --> 00:34:58,137
Why?

527
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:00,139
Were you waiting for her?

528
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:01,849
Why would you ask me that?

529
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:03,351
He's the one you should ask.

530
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:07,980
Why would I ask him?

531
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:10,650
Aren't you the one dating Ju-kyung?

532
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:13,569
-That's what everyone says.
-What?

533
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:20,743
Jeez.

534
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:41,097
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

535
00:35:44,016 --> 00:35:45,059
What can I get for you?

536
00:35:46,602 --> 00:35:47,937
Goodness.

537
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,897
Strawberries and grapefruit?

538
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:51,315
You must like fresh flavors.

539
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:53,401
Fresh flavors make you feel good, right?

540
00:35:56,904 --> 00:35:58,114
Just like you.

541
00:35:58,197 --> 00:35:59,240
What do you mean?

542
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:08,416
You're fresh, just like a grapefruit.

543
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:09,458
My grapefruit?

544
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:11,085
Stop it.

545
00:36:11,752 --> 00:36:14,130
-What kind of pet name is that?
-What's the matter?

546
00:36:14,213 --> 00:36:16,174
Couples can have pet names, right?

547
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:17,717
Am I right, my grapefruit?

548
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:19,969
Stop it, my strawberry.

549
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:21,929
See? It's weird.

550
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:27,476
But Hee-kyung,
why didn't you go to work today?

551
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:30,897
I yelled at my CEO.

552
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,607
I took a day off
after realizing what I'd done.

553
00:36:33,649 --> 00:36:35,234
Should I quit before I get fired?

554
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:37,111
Jun-woo.

555
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:38,654
Ju-kyung…

556
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:41,407
Ju-kyung's right there.

557
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:43,784
Sorry? What's going on?

558
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:45,411
Han Jun-woo!

559
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:56,380
Ju-kyung finding out
bothers you that much?

560
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:00,051
It doesn't feel right as her teacher.

561
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:01,802
If Ju-kyung finds out,

562
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:05,097
it will be difficult for her
to see me just as her teacher.

563
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:06,599
And if the school finds out,

564
00:37:06,682 --> 00:37:08,601
if I even give her
a slightly higher score,

565
00:37:08,684 --> 00:37:11,437
people are bound to complain
about favoritism and partiality.

566
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,438
I get it.

567
00:37:13,689 --> 00:37:14,857
We'll keep it a secret.

568
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:17,026
Thank you.

569
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:24,408
Anyway, why is she doing
part-time work here?

570
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:26,077
Why is she making money in secret?

571
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:30,248
She should be studying instead.

572
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:35,169
But Ju-kyung seems to have
found her passion.

573
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:38,714
She wrote down cosmetology
on her career interest survey.

574
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:40,007
Didn't you know?

575
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:41,050
Cosmetology?

576
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:47,598
What have you been up to since earlier?

577
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:49,892
Mom, try to punch me.

578
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:51,102
Punch you? Why?

579
00:37:51,185 --> 00:37:54,647
I have now achieved dynamic visual acuity.

580
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:57,275
Right, left.

581
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:01,570
-Mom!
-Dynamic visual acuity, my foot.

582
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:03,531
-Go to the hospital for me.
-The hospital?

583
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:06,033
Dear Soo-ho got injured and hospitalized.

584
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:09,245
With no mom to take care of him
and eating bland hospital meals…

585
00:38:09,328 --> 00:38:11,831
I made a beef stew for him,
so go give it to him.

586
00:38:11,914 --> 00:38:13,708
Jeez. How did he get hurt?

587
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:14,959
But I'm busy right now.

588
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:18,546
-Ask Dad.
-Your dad went to his class.

589
00:38:19,046 --> 00:38:20,339
Make the delivery, okay?

590
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:31,058
-Hey, Mr. Lim.
-Yes?

591
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:33,644
We're going for a cup of tea.
Would you like to join us?

592
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:37,815
Thank you for inviting me,
but I have to go prepare dinner.

593
00:38:37,898 --> 00:38:41,694
-Goodness, you're so caring!
-What a nice guy!

594
00:38:41,777 --> 00:38:43,529
I know a place that has great coffee.

595
00:38:43,612 --> 00:38:45,489
-Really?
-If you come here

596
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:47,658
and get either your eyelashes
or eyebrows done,

597
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:49,160
coffee is free of charge.

598
00:38:49,243 --> 00:38:50,745
-I'll come.
-Of course, I'll come.

599
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:51,871
See you next class.

600
00:38:51,954 --> 00:38:54,415
-I'll see you next time. Bye!
-Goodbye!

601
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:58,085
-I'm sorry.
-Jeez.

602
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:09,180
Columbus Park?

603
00:39:12,224 --> 00:39:13,476
Hey! Stop right there!

604
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:16,228
Hey, stop!

605
00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:22,026
Hey, stop right there!
Where are you going?

606
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:23,569
Hey! You, where are you going?

607
00:39:23,652 --> 00:39:25,654
Hey, you! Columbus!

608
00:39:30,117 --> 00:39:32,328
Sir, please follow the car in the front.

609
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:40,503
Seo-jun must be there too.

610
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:43,547
Why did I come without makeup yesterday?

611
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:45,966
The mirror.

612
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:52,556
Is that good enough?

613
00:39:54,016 --> 00:39:55,059
ROOM 505
LEE, HAN

614
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:59,355
-Why don't you put it on yourself?
-Come on, do better.

615
00:40:06,612 --> 00:40:07,822
I'll come back later.

616
00:40:12,326 --> 00:40:13,202
Hi.

617
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:16,122
Hey.

618
00:40:16,997 --> 00:40:18,707
You two look very close.

619
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,501
Not at all.

620
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:22,795
I was helping him get changed.

621
00:40:22,878 --> 00:40:23,921
Should I wait outside?

622
00:40:24,004 --> 00:40:25,965
Put it on quickly!

623
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:27,842
I'll get him clothed soon.

624
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:41,647
Going to the restroom?

625
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:44,108
Do you need help?

626
00:40:44,191 --> 00:40:45,484
Help him with what?

627
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:47,319
Right.

628
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:50,030
It must be difficult by yourself.

629
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:50,948
Man.

630
00:40:51,031 --> 00:40:52,867
Don't try to picture it or anything.

631
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:54,201
I'm going for a walk.

632
00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:08,299
I brought these in case you get bored.

633
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:10,801
It must have been heavy.
You shouldn't have.

634
00:41:12,761 --> 00:41:13,721
These look fun.

635
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:17,725
GARDEN OF BLOOD

636
00:41:18,392 --> 00:41:19,560
I'll get it.

637
00:41:25,065 --> 00:41:26,817
-Hold on. I'll undo it.
-Wait.

638
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:28,944
-Hold on.
-I'm sorry, wait a bit.

639
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,573
-Hey.
-Gosh.

640
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:38,913
Hey…

641
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:41,582
Here. My mom wanted me to give you this.

642
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:45,961
I'm leaving.
Get on with whatever you were doing.

643
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:48,255
-It's not like that, Ju-young.
-My hair is--

644
00:41:49,798 --> 00:41:51,675
Just kiss!

645
00:41:52,259 --> 00:41:54,178
I'll kill you if you tell Mom, got it?

646
00:41:54,261 --> 00:41:56,639
Gosh, what do I do?

647
00:41:56,722 --> 00:41:57,556
Wait.

648
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,767
Sorry. Can you scoot to the right?

649
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:01,352
I'm sorry.

650
00:42:01,435 --> 00:42:03,771
-Not sure. What does Seo-jun like?
-Fried chicken.

651
00:42:07,316 --> 00:42:08,150
What do we do?

652
00:42:08,984 --> 00:42:09,985
What do we do?

653
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:13,656
-Here.
-Hold on.

654
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:21,497
-Seo-jun!
-We're here!

655
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:22,998
-He's not here?
-He's not here.

656
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:25,376
-Soo-ho!
-Soo-ho!

657
00:42:25,459 --> 00:42:26,460
-Soo-ho!
-Jeez!

658
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:28,629
-My friend, Soo-ho!
-Goodness.

659
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:29,964
-Soo-ho!
-Stop!

660
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:32,174
Don't touch me.

661
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:33,259
-Why?
-What's wrong?

662
00:42:33,342 --> 00:42:34,718
-It hurts.
-It hurts?

663
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:35,844
-He's hurting.
-He is.

664
00:42:35,928 --> 00:42:36,929
It's heartbreaking.

665
00:42:37,012 --> 00:42:38,514
-Don't!
-Don't touch him!

666
00:42:38,597 --> 00:42:40,432
Goodness. Were you hurt badly?

667
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:45,229
Am I dreaming?

668
00:42:45,312 --> 00:42:48,107
-Whatever.
-Hold on. What are you doing here?

669
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:49,191
Are you sick?

670
00:42:49,275 --> 00:42:50,192
I'm fine.

671
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:52,152
That's good. Hey, hold on.

672
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:53,237
Don't you wonder

673
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,697
what I'm doing here?

674
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:56,740
Aren't you curious
if I'm all right or not?

675
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:57,700
Not at all.

676
00:43:01,537 --> 00:43:03,497
What? Are you really not feeling well?

677
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:06,125
I'm sick. I got this illness.

678
00:43:06,208 --> 00:43:09,128
-What illness?
-A horrible incurable disease.

679
00:43:09,211 --> 00:43:11,046
Symptoms? It's not just a couple.

680
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:12,506
This brain, only thinking of Han Go-un.

681
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:14,800
These eyes, only seeing Han Go-un.

682
00:43:14,883 --> 00:43:16,885
This heart, only beating for Han Go-un.

683
00:43:16,969 --> 00:43:21,015
These legs, running toward
Han Go-un on their own.

684
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,267
-Really?
-Hey, bro!

685
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:24,560
Too bad you're so sick.

686
00:43:24,643 --> 00:43:26,478
-"Bro"?
-What are you going to do?

687
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:28,314
Looks like you'll be dying soon.

688
00:43:28,397 --> 00:43:29,440
At my hands.

689
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:34,820
To Han Go-un,

690
00:43:34,903 --> 00:43:37,448
-Two.
-I won't make unwanted advances.

691
00:43:37,531 --> 00:43:39,700
How dare you hit on my sister?

692
00:43:39,783 --> 00:43:41,160
She said she's not interested!

693
00:43:41,243 --> 00:43:43,704
I'm going to make her interested!

694
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:45,706
-One.
-To Han Go-un,

695
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:47,041
Two.

696
00:43:47,833 --> 00:43:50,377
-I like you.
-You little…

697
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:53,797
I like Han Go-un.

698
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:55,758
Hey, I'll see you again.

699
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:57,676
You, stop right there!

700
00:43:58,927 --> 00:44:00,095
That nutcase.

701
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:05,142
Here, your underwear.

702
00:44:05,934 --> 00:44:06,769
By the way,

703
00:44:07,269 --> 00:44:08,228
does Ju-kyung know?

704
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:10,648
-That her brother likes you?
-What?

705
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:12,650
That's Ju-kyung's little brother?

706
00:44:17,571 --> 00:44:18,489
It tastes good.

707
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:22,910
It tastes good. Hey, try this.

708
00:44:23,952 --> 00:44:25,120
-It's good.
-It is, right?

709
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:26,872
-Han Seo-jun!
-Hey, Seo-jun!

710
00:44:26,955 --> 00:44:29,208
-Seo-jun, you're alive!
-Jeez, look at this.

711
00:44:29,291 --> 00:44:31,460
-Hey, come here.
-What's this

712
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:34,672
Seo-jun, are you all right?

713
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:36,548
-It hurts.
-It does?

714
00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:38,008
Seo-jun!

715
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:39,885
You look good even in a hospital gown.

716
00:44:39,968 --> 00:44:42,304
The glorious wound and the cast.

717
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:43,639
-You still look nice.
-You do.

718
00:44:43,722 --> 00:44:45,557
Do you know how worried I was?

719
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:48,686
-I had lost my appetite, seriously.
-He really did worry.

720
00:44:48,769 --> 00:44:52,022
Hey! It's all those snacks
that chase away your appetite.

721
00:44:55,275 --> 00:44:57,319
Old farts over there,
can you keep it down?

722
00:44:57,403 --> 00:44:58,737
Can't you see the quiet sign?

723
00:44:58,821 --> 00:45:00,322
This isn't your private room.

724
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:02,032
I'm thirsty. Do you have a drink?

725
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,410
Aloe vera juice.

726
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:11,041
I'm sorry.

727
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:12,751
I'll fix it right away.

728
00:45:14,169 --> 00:45:15,003
What are these?

729
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:19,383
-Hey, give those back!
-Look at his underwear!

730
00:45:19,466 --> 00:45:20,759
They're playing around.

731
00:45:21,343 --> 00:45:22,302
-Very nice!
-Very nice!

732
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:23,220
Give them back!

733
00:45:23,303 --> 00:45:25,597
-Move over. Give them back!
-Just for a minute.

734
00:45:26,598 --> 00:45:29,560
-Our Soo-ho needs his rest.
-Come on, give them back!

735
00:45:29,643 --> 00:45:32,062
Look at that cold sweat. Goodness!

736
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:33,522
What do we do?

737
00:45:33,605 --> 00:45:34,815
What do we do?

738
00:45:34,898 --> 00:45:37,192
-My hands are fine.
-They are?

739
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:39,736
Then, I'll wipe down your feet
which are not fine.

740
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:41,155
Wait!

741
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:42,656
Soo-ho, your foot!

742
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:51,623
Your foot is very small and cute.

743
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:53,667
That's a surprise. You like pink?

744
00:45:54,751 --> 00:45:56,295
How dare you touch my foot?

745
00:45:57,129 --> 00:45:58,130
Hey.

746
00:45:58,714 --> 00:46:01,341
I just wanted to wipe your foot…

747
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:02,551
He has very weird taste.

748
00:46:03,051 --> 00:46:04,303
I can't believe it.

749
00:46:04,386 --> 00:46:05,929
That was so mean.

750
00:46:06,513 --> 00:46:07,347
Jeez.

751
00:46:10,309 --> 00:46:11,768
How could you?

752
00:46:13,353 --> 00:46:15,939
-We decided on fried chicken.
-By the way, where's the TV?

753
00:46:16,023 --> 00:46:17,357
-Hey.
-Where are we ordering from?

754
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:19,401
-Let's get pizza too.
-Order what Seo-jun likes!

755
00:46:19,485 --> 00:46:21,111
How about that place from the last time?

756
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:23,989
-Sauce?
-Soy sauce? Or garlic?

757
00:46:24,072 --> 00:46:25,365
-Hey!
-Yes?

758
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:26,742
You should all leave now.

759
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:28,785
But why?

760
00:46:28,869 --> 00:46:31,622
-I'm going to stay the night.
-Hey! We'll take care of you all night.

761
00:46:31,705 --> 00:46:33,165
We're friends, you know?

762
00:46:33,248 --> 00:46:34,750
-Loyalty!
-Loyalty!

763
00:46:34,833 --> 00:46:36,251
Where do you expect to sleep, big guy?

764
00:46:36,335 --> 00:46:37,503
-Leave!
-Yes, please do.

765
00:46:37,586 --> 00:46:38,712
You guys are too loud.

766
00:46:38,795 --> 00:46:40,130
You should go too, please.

767
00:46:40,214 --> 00:46:41,048
Soo-ho!

768
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:42,799
You're really hurting my feelings!

769
00:46:42,883 --> 00:46:44,218
I should leave now.

770
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:45,511
-What?
-Hey, let's go.

771
00:46:46,345 --> 00:46:48,180
-Why?
-Let's go.

772
00:46:48,263 --> 00:46:50,015
That's it. You guys leave too.

773
00:46:50,098 --> 00:46:51,099
Hey,

774
00:46:51,183 --> 00:46:53,727
why are you dying to make us leave?

775
00:46:53,810 --> 00:46:54,937
Come on!

776
00:46:55,604 --> 00:46:57,856
I just want to be alone with Soo-ho.

777
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:59,233
-Alone?
-Just the two of you?

778
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:01,693
I approve of this bromance.

779
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:02,778
-Me too.
-Me too.

780
00:47:02,861 --> 00:47:05,447
-When did you make up?
-Did you guys make up?

781
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,407
Right.

782
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:10,410
I hear they're shooting
that show with Yeo Ha-jin in the lobby.

783
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:13,789
-What, Yeo Ha-jin?
-Everyone's first crush, Yeo Ha-jin?

784
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:17,209
I'm sorry, Su-ah!

785
00:47:17,918 --> 00:47:19,962
Just go! Leave!

786
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:26,885
I'm sorry, Seo-jun! Let's go.

787
00:47:54,997 --> 00:47:55,956
You scared me.

788
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:57,374
Why are you out here?

789
00:47:57,457 --> 00:47:59,376
I took the trouble to chase them away.

790
00:47:59,459 --> 00:48:00,294
Well,

791
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:01,503
it's getting late.

792
00:48:01,587 --> 00:48:03,964
Why do you go through the hassle
to keep it a secret?

793
00:48:04,464 --> 00:48:06,425
Just tell them and be done with it.

794
00:48:06,508 --> 00:48:08,594
I can't do it yet.

795
00:48:08,677 --> 00:48:10,470
Why? Because of Su-jin?

796
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:11,471
Hey, I told you…

797
00:48:12,306 --> 00:48:13,849
that was just an example.

798
00:48:13,932 --> 00:48:15,934
Gosh, you're so funny.

799
00:48:16,018 --> 00:48:18,061
Hey, what do you have on your hair?

800
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:20,480
I'm sorry.

801
00:48:21,148 --> 00:48:23,525
Darn it. I'll need to cut this out.

802
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:26,153
What did you do on the bed
to take a button off?

803
00:48:27,988 --> 00:48:30,574
I guess your loneliness
makes you imaginative.

804
00:48:30,657 --> 00:48:31,992
The boys were just messing with me!

805
00:48:32,701 --> 00:48:33,827
Then I'll write one too.

806
00:48:34,828 --> 00:48:35,746
Give me your arm.

807
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:38,999
Hey, don't write anything weird.

808
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:44,004
Done.

809
00:48:45,422 --> 00:48:46,423
I'm leaving.

810
00:48:48,675 --> 00:48:51,637
Rise up, spirit of the tiger. Roar!

811
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:53,388
Right. Seo-jun!

812
00:48:54,806 --> 00:48:55,766
Roar!

813
00:48:59,561 --> 00:49:01,396
It never gets old to her, does it?

814
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:06,610
BEAUTY SALON

815
00:49:06,693 --> 00:49:09,905
You should have gotten a touch-up sooner.
Why did you come just now?

816
00:49:09,988 --> 00:49:11,573
Still, it'll last longer now.

817
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:13,575
-Thank you.
-Let me see.

818
00:49:16,995 --> 00:49:18,705
-Are you done?
-Yes, it came out well.

819
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:20,582
Mom!

820
00:49:21,166 --> 00:49:24,378
-Are you going to get something?
-No, I'm here to check on what's mine.

821
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:26,380
What's yours? What do you mean?

822
00:49:26,963 --> 00:49:29,800
I am going to head out.

823
00:49:30,759 --> 00:49:32,719
Ms. Hong, your shop is still open, right?

824
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:34,262
-Hello.
-Goodness.

825
00:49:35,347 --> 00:49:38,558
I didn't know you had
such a young and handsome customer.

826
00:49:39,768 --> 00:49:41,228
Well, then, I'll get going…

827
00:49:42,187 --> 00:49:43,855
He's Ju-kyung's teacher.

828
00:49:44,439 --> 00:49:47,651
-Hello.
-Gosh, I could tell from your features

829
00:49:47,734 --> 00:49:49,778
that you were a teacher.

830
00:49:50,445 --> 00:49:53,407
-Are you married?
-No, not yet.

831
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:55,367
Goodness, what a coincidence.

832
00:49:56,034 --> 00:49:57,703
My daughter isn't married either.

833
00:49:57,786 --> 00:49:59,996
I think you'd hit it off with her.

834
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:01,832
Don't you want a blind date?

835
00:50:01,915 --> 00:50:04,042
Well, thank you for the offer,

836
00:50:04,126 --> 00:50:05,419
but no, thank you.

837
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:06,920
-I'll get going, then.
-Goodbye.

838
00:50:07,504 --> 00:50:08,839
But why not?

839
00:50:08,922 --> 00:50:09,965
If things work out,

840
00:50:10,048 --> 00:50:13,385
you'd have my pork trotters for free
for the rest of your life.

841
00:50:13,468 --> 00:50:16,388
Jeez, who'd marry for free pork trotters?

842
00:50:16,471 --> 00:50:18,306
You marry for a like-minded soul.

843
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:20,600
-Goodbye, Mr. Han.
-Good night.

844
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:25,063
Why don't you set Hee-kyung up
for a blind date?

845
00:50:25,147 --> 00:50:26,565
Do you know any nice guys?

846
00:50:27,232 --> 00:50:28,400
Should I?

847
00:50:28,483 --> 00:50:30,360
Hee-kyung, what type of men are you into?

848
00:50:31,027 --> 00:50:32,696
-Just say the word.
-Well.

849
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:34,948
The type of men I'm into?

850
00:50:35,907 --> 00:50:38,452
As for age,
someone who was born in early 1990.

851
00:50:38,994 --> 00:50:40,454
Someone without thick eyebrows.

852
00:50:40,537 --> 00:50:43,540
Someone who looks cute with bangs
but sexy with them pushed back.

853
00:50:43,623 --> 00:50:45,292
Someone who seems modest and quiet,

854
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:47,711
but acts like a kitten
when he's making a fuss.

855
00:50:47,794 --> 00:50:48,754
Someone who makes me…

856
00:50:48,837 --> 00:50:49,880
flustered all the time.

857
00:50:49,963 --> 00:50:51,047
Someone like that.

858
00:50:53,842 --> 00:50:56,219
Just say you don't want to date.
Where's a guy like that?

859
00:50:56,303 --> 00:50:57,971
-There is.
-She's insane.

860
00:50:58,054 --> 00:51:00,056
-Mom, I'm going to hit the store. Bye!
-Okay.

861
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:01,516
That brat.

862
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:02,726
Come back home soon!

863
00:51:04,644 --> 00:51:05,479
-Jun-woo.
-Gosh.

864
00:51:06,104 --> 00:51:07,105
Where are you going?

865
00:51:10,066 --> 00:51:12,110
Why do you keep running away?
It flusters me.

866
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:16,531
This is your neighborhood.
What if Ju-kyung sees us?

867
00:51:16,615 --> 00:51:18,033
She won't pass this alley.

868
00:51:19,075 --> 00:51:19,910
Is that so?

869
00:51:22,788 --> 00:51:24,873
-Do you like pork trotters?
-Excuse me?

870
00:51:24,956 --> 00:51:27,042
Who told you to smile like that
to strangers?

871
00:51:27,125 --> 00:51:28,960
-What did I do?
-It's your pretty smile

872
00:51:29,044 --> 00:51:31,588
that has everyone considering you
a potential groom.

873
00:51:32,547 --> 00:51:34,132
To you, maybe.

874
00:51:35,008 --> 00:51:36,176
Your eyebrows are pretty.

875
00:51:36,843 --> 00:51:38,094
You're prettier, Hee-kyung.

876
00:51:39,638 --> 00:51:40,472
Lower your face.

877
00:51:47,854 --> 00:51:48,688
Hee-kyung?

878
00:51:51,691 --> 00:51:54,319
-Who were you kissing? Your boyfriend?
-Leave!

879
00:51:54,402 --> 00:51:56,196
-Leave!
-Let go of me. Who is it?

880
00:51:57,197 --> 00:51:59,199
-Let go.
-I said, leave!

881
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:01,034
Just let go! Seriously…

882
00:52:02,536 --> 00:52:04,120
Who's that? Is it someone I know?

883
00:52:04,204 --> 00:52:05,956
I said, no.

884
00:52:06,039 --> 00:52:08,333
Goodness. What's with my sisters today?

885
00:52:08,416 --> 00:52:10,377
Why are you getting caught
being all lovey-dovey?

886
00:52:11,169 --> 00:52:12,420
Let's just go home.

887
00:52:13,255 --> 00:52:14,172
Where have you been?

888
00:52:23,348 --> 00:52:26,017
SAEBOM CARD
YONGPA TAXI 154,000 WON

889
00:52:26,101 --> 00:52:29,646
One, ten, hundred, thousand,
ten thousand, hundred thousand…

890
00:52:29,729 --> 00:52:31,064
Honey!

891
00:52:31,147 --> 00:52:33,358
I found him!

892
00:52:33,441 --> 00:52:35,110
-Found who?
-Columbus Park!

893
00:52:35,193 --> 00:52:38,071
I was heading out of my class,
and our eyes locked.

894
00:52:38,154 --> 00:52:39,447
To get him, I…

895
00:52:39,531 --> 00:52:41,741
-Did you get in a cab?
-I did!

896
00:52:41,825 --> 00:52:43,451
So my cab chased after his.

897
00:52:43,535 --> 00:52:45,203
Just like a car chase in the movies.

898
00:52:47,497 --> 00:52:48,748
"Halt, Columbus Park!"

899
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:50,208
"Sir, go a little faster."

900
00:52:50,292 --> 00:52:51,668
So? Did you catch him?

901
00:52:51,751 --> 00:52:53,253
I lost him!

902
00:52:53,753 --> 00:52:54,629
But honey,

903
00:52:54,713 --> 00:52:57,507
at least I confirmed that he's in Seoul.

904
00:52:57,591 --> 00:53:00,051
Confirmed, my foot!
You just lost 150,000 won!

905
00:53:00,135 --> 00:53:01,970
-Honey, wait…
-I just can't!

906
00:53:02,053 --> 00:53:04,431
-Honey, think it through.
-Darn it!

907
00:53:04,514 --> 00:53:06,516
At least we know he's in Seoul!

908
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:09,185
Who cares? You just burned 150,000 won!

909
00:53:13,398 --> 00:53:14,900
You should come clean to me.

910
00:53:15,442 --> 00:53:17,652
-Are you studying cosmetology?
-How did you know?

911
00:53:17,736 --> 00:53:18,904
"How did you know?"

912
00:53:18,987 --> 00:53:21,740
You're not trying something out
because you don't want to study, are you?

913
00:53:21,823 --> 00:53:24,492
It's not like that.
I'm seriously considering it.

914
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:26,953
I really want to do this.

915
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:30,165
But I haven't started properly yet.
I haven't registered at a beauty school.

916
00:53:30,248 --> 00:53:32,375
Are you working part-time
to earn your tuition?

917
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:34,085
How did you know about that?

918
00:53:35,712 --> 00:53:36,546
It's obvious…

919
00:53:37,339 --> 00:53:39,174
seeing how you get home so late lately.

920
00:53:40,008 --> 00:53:41,927
Gosh, you're good.

921
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:43,553
You have amazing intuition.

922
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:46,222
But don't tell Mom for a while.

923
00:53:46,806 --> 00:53:50,393
I'll get really good grades on my exams
and then ask for her permission.

924
00:53:51,269 --> 00:53:52,228
I'll be off then.

925
00:53:55,315 --> 00:53:56,232
Ju-kyung,

926
00:53:56,316 --> 00:53:58,860
if the part-time job is tough,
I can pay for the tuition.

927
00:53:58,944 --> 00:54:01,196
No, I want to try it on my own.

928
00:54:01,279 --> 00:54:03,406
Gosh, you're all grown up now.

929
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:04,574
-Bye!
-Bye.

930
00:54:06,117 --> 00:54:09,079
Ju-kyung, let me know
if things get too tough, okay?

931
00:54:09,746 --> 00:54:12,207
Will do. Thanks, sis! I love you!

932
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:19,756
What?

933
00:54:20,548 --> 00:54:21,758
Mr. Han's girlfriend

934
00:54:22,801 --> 00:54:24,052
is Ju-kyung's older sister?

935
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:38,441
Good morning, sir!

936
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:39,776
Ju-kyung,

937
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:41,861
have this.

938
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:43,780
I love anything strawberry.

939
00:54:43,863 --> 00:54:44,906
Thank you.

940
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:47,200
-Have a great day, Ju-kyung!
-Thank you, sir.

941
00:54:55,834 --> 00:54:56,668
Hello.

942
00:54:57,168 --> 00:54:58,586
You make it too obvious.

943
00:54:59,671 --> 00:55:00,755
What do you mean?

944
00:55:01,548 --> 00:55:03,299
You're being too nice to her

945
00:55:03,383 --> 00:55:05,468
for being the sister of your girlfriend!

946
00:55:07,595 --> 00:55:08,430
Well,

947
00:55:09,514 --> 00:55:10,974
I still don't get what you mean…

948
00:55:14,185 --> 00:55:15,020
I don't know.

949
00:55:16,104 --> 00:55:18,189
I'm not the type to make it obvious.

950
00:55:22,485 --> 00:55:26,406
When two wrappers A and B
are placed on the coordinate plane,

951
00:55:27,073 --> 00:55:30,326
let's say the upper boundary
of the gilt pattern

952
00:55:32,078 --> 00:55:32,996
is y equals

953
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:35,373
f of x.

954
00:55:36,291 --> 00:55:37,167
The lower boundary…

955
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:39,127
He's probably doing well, right?

956
00:55:40,879 --> 00:55:42,338
I wonder what he's up to.

957
00:55:50,055 --> 00:55:53,975
When specified as such,
the area between these two curves

958
00:55:55,769 --> 00:55:57,687
will be the same.

959
00:56:00,982 --> 00:56:01,816
Jeez.

960
00:56:02,442 --> 00:56:03,276
Give it to me.

961
00:56:06,446 --> 00:56:07,489
I want the meat.

962
00:56:08,573 --> 00:56:09,657
Yours look tastier.

963
00:56:14,829 --> 00:56:16,247
Stop spilling, Leaky.

964
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:25,924
There we go.

965
00:56:27,634 --> 00:56:28,885
I'll push you with my legs.

966
00:56:28,968 --> 00:56:30,595
-Hey!
-Okay.

967
00:56:31,096 --> 00:56:32,764
Pull it back a little.

968
00:56:33,598 --> 00:56:34,557
Turn right.

969
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:36,142
Come on.

970
00:56:38,311 --> 00:56:39,270
Here.

971
00:56:39,354 --> 00:56:40,980
You carry this around?

972
00:56:41,689 --> 00:56:42,649
I'm impressed.

973
00:56:42,732 --> 00:56:44,692
For my followers who support me,

974
00:56:44,776 --> 00:56:47,862
even a single selfie needs my best care.

975
00:56:49,697 --> 00:56:51,616
-It looks good.
-She's glowing.

976
00:56:51,699 --> 00:56:53,284
-It's really different.
-It works.

977
00:56:55,411 --> 00:56:57,455
-It's the best photo ever!
-It looks good.

978
00:56:57,539 --> 00:57:00,250
I'm submitting this
to the Newstagram Goddess Competition.

979
00:57:01,668 --> 00:57:03,586
-Do you want to enter too?
-No, I'm good.

980
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:05,046
Ju-kyung, you should take one.

981
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:07,048
-I feel like you'll do well.
-Give it a go.

982
00:57:07,132 --> 00:57:09,551
I'll pour my soul into your picture.

983
00:57:10,135 --> 00:57:10,969
Okay.

984
00:57:11,719 --> 00:57:13,888
All right, Ju-kyung, one, two, three!

985
00:57:15,014 --> 00:57:16,015
Hold up the reflector.

986
00:57:17,642 --> 00:57:18,476
Stay still.

987
00:57:19,602 --> 00:57:20,645
You look so pretty.

988
00:57:21,729 --> 00:57:23,314
Give me goddess vibes, okay?

989
00:57:23,398 --> 00:57:24,566
Beautiful.

990
00:57:28,111 --> 00:57:30,488
What? Why are you taking
pictures of Ju-kyung?

991
00:57:35,535 --> 00:57:36,494
It's nothing.

992
00:57:36,578 --> 00:57:38,121
My fingers slipped.

993
00:57:38,204 --> 00:57:39,581
-Get the sunlight.
-Stay still.

994
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:44,794
You look so pretty.

995
00:57:45,503 --> 00:57:47,464
Look over there, into the distance.

996
00:57:50,425 --> 00:57:51,426
Press it down firmly.

997
00:57:54,429 --> 00:57:56,139
I'll switch it out right away.

998
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:01,311
Soo-ho.

999
00:58:05,982 --> 00:58:07,192
I told you not to come.

1000
00:58:08,276 --> 00:58:10,653
Let's talk, please?

1001
00:58:13,948 --> 00:58:15,283
I feel better now.

1002
00:58:15,825 --> 00:58:16,659
Hey.

1003
00:58:17,702 --> 00:58:19,120
-What?
-You came again?

1004
00:58:19,704 --> 00:58:21,372
You're literally coming here every day.

1005
00:58:21,956 --> 00:58:24,667
I can't call him and I'm worried.
I have to come to see him.

1006
00:58:24,751 --> 00:58:26,503
That's a touching story.

1007
00:58:26,586 --> 00:58:28,713
Hey, you have one less cast!

1008
00:58:28,796 --> 00:58:32,008
Yes, they took another x-ray
and it was all good to go.

1009
00:58:32,091 --> 00:58:33,468
That's great news.

1010
00:58:33,551 --> 00:58:35,428
Soo-ho should get better soon too.

1011
00:58:35,929 --> 00:58:36,763
Hey,

1012
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:40,975
-did you know Soo-ho had a cousin?
-What?

1013
00:58:43,019 --> 00:58:46,022
Sure. I knew that.

1014
00:58:58,076 --> 00:58:59,410
Why did you do that?

1015
00:58:59,494 --> 00:59:00,745
Se-yeon was my friend.

1016
00:59:02,121 --> 00:59:03,790
Why in the world did you do that?

1017
00:59:08,461 --> 00:59:10,088
I had no idea about Se-yeon's story.

1018
00:59:12,257 --> 00:59:14,342
I'd entrusted Director Oh with everything.

1019
00:59:15,218 --> 00:59:17,845
I had no idea that was how
he would deal with things.

1020
00:59:17,929 --> 00:59:19,806
If I had, I wouldn't have done that.

1021
00:59:20,306 --> 00:59:22,308
As you said, Se-yeon was your friend.

1022
00:59:22,976 --> 00:59:24,811
How could I ever do such a thing to him?

1023
00:59:24,894 --> 00:59:26,563
So everything's on Director Oh?

1024
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:30,858
They said that was to cover up your story.

1025
00:59:32,485 --> 00:59:33,361
Also,

1026
00:59:34,362 --> 00:59:36,614
are you simply going to plead ignorance?

1027
00:59:39,117 --> 00:59:41,786
Do you really think
you're blameless in all this?

1028
00:59:44,163 --> 00:59:45,206
Did you know…

1029
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:49,794
I thought Se-yeon made such a choice…

1030
00:59:51,879 --> 00:59:54,674
because I didn't answer his last call.

1031
00:59:57,093 --> 00:59:59,262
Do you know how much I suffered?

1032
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:02,181
It turned out…

1033
01:00:03,224 --> 01:00:05,768
you were at the start of all this.

1034
01:00:06,936 --> 01:00:08,938
Did a scandal scare you that much?

1035
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:10,857
That was nothing!

1036
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:13,526
That…

1037
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:17,697
I didn't want you to be
disappointed in me.

1038
01:00:18,656 --> 01:00:20,325
Our relationship was shaky as it is.

1039
01:00:20,408 --> 01:00:21,618
I thought such an article…

1040
01:00:22,118 --> 01:00:23,703
would make you grow more distant.

1041
01:00:24,621 --> 01:00:25,955
So I tried to cover it up.

1042
01:00:28,374 --> 01:00:30,960
How could I be disappointed
when I had no expectations?

1043
01:00:33,004 --> 01:00:34,088
Long ago,

1044
01:00:36,841 --> 01:00:38,134
I'd already seen everything.

1045
01:00:40,511 --> 01:00:43,097
What you did on the day Mom died.

1046
01:00:56,110 --> 01:00:57,028
What?

1047
01:00:59,864 --> 01:01:00,782
You saw?

1048
01:01:02,450 --> 01:01:04,535
-Soo-ho, back then…
-Please leave.

1049
01:01:05,912 --> 01:01:06,746
Soo-ho.

1050
01:01:07,372 --> 01:01:08,289
Soo-ho!

1051
01:01:08,373 --> 01:01:09,457
I said, leave!

1052
01:01:13,002 --> 01:01:14,045
Soo-ho.

1053
01:01:14,712 --> 01:01:15,713
Soo-ho!

1054
01:01:15,797 --> 01:01:16,798
-Soo-ho!
-Soo-ho!

1055
01:01:16,881 --> 01:01:18,800
Soo-ho, stay with me! Soo-ho!

1056
01:01:18,883 --> 01:01:20,760
Soo-ho, what's wrong? Over here!

1057
01:01:20,843 --> 01:01:22,679
-Soo-ho!
-Sir?

1058
01:01:22,762 --> 01:01:24,472
-What's wrong? Wake up!
-Are you okay?

1059
01:01:24,555 --> 01:01:27,225
Soo-ho, wake up!

1060
01:01:28,017 --> 01:01:30,061
He seems to have suffered a panic attack.

1061
01:01:30,561 --> 01:01:34,232
ECG and other tests didn't show anomalies,
so it's likely a psychological issue.

1062
01:01:34,315 --> 01:01:35,983
If he suffers such episodes often,

1063
01:01:36,067 --> 01:01:38,569
I recommend bringing him
into the psychology department

1064
01:01:38,653 --> 01:01:40,113
and getting him some counseling.

1065
01:02:02,218 --> 01:02:03,803
I knew he kept things to himself,

1066
01:02:04,595 --> 01:02:07,181
but I didn't know it was to the extent
that he'd get sick.

1067
01:02:09,892 --> 01:02:11,644
I'm telling you this
because he won't himself.

1068
01:02:14,147 --> 01:02:14,981
Leo…

1069
01:02:16,149 --> 01:02:17,024
is Lee Soo-ho.

1070
01:02:20,945 --> 01:02:21,821
What?

1071
01:02:22,488 --> 01:02:24,282
Can't you tell just by seeing his home?

1072
01:02:25,199 --> 01:02:26,200
Are you even his dad?

1073
01:02:28,536 --> 01:02:30,079
When he wrote songs with Se-yeon,

1074
01:02:31,038 --> 01:02:32,999
you have no idea how happy he was, do you?

1075
01:04:13,266 --> 01:04:17,061
Actually, I like Soo-ho.

1076
01:04:17,728 --> 01:04:19,063
But it hurts a little.

1077
01:05:13,242 --> 01:05:14,076
Leo

1078
01:05:14,577 --> 01:05:15,411
is Lee Soo-ho.

1079
01:05:17,997 --> 01:05:19,790
When he wrote songs with Se-yeon,

1080
01:05:19,874 --> 01:05:21,959
you have no idea how happy he was, do you?

1081
01:05:42,021 --> 01:05:44,815
What you did on the day Mom died.

1082
01:05:56,911 --> 01:05:59,121
I thought Se-yeon made such a choice…

1083
01:06:00,539 --> 01:06:03,626
because I didn't answer his last call.

1084
01:06:04,210 --> 01:06:06,671
Do you know how much I suffered?

1085
01:06:18,224 --> 01:06:20,059
So how long will you take it out on me?

1086
01:06:20,893 --> 01:06:21,852
Until you die…

1087
01:06:23,396 --> 01:06:24,981
and meet Se-yeon again.

1088
01:06:28,442 --> 01:06:29,402
Never forget.

1089
01:06:30,903 --> 01:06:32,446
You killed Se-yeon,

1090
01:06:33,656 --> 01:06:35,116
and you don't deserve to smile.

1091
01:06:48,254 --> 01:06:49,714
He's sleeping as if he's dead.

1092
01:06:58,180 --> 01:06:59,640
Is he even breathing?

1093
01:07:12,486 --> 01:07:14,280
I saw it all. Why put up a show?

1094
01:07:20,494 --> 01:07:21,328
What?

1095
01:07:21,912 --> 01:07:23,497
I want to get some fresh air,

1096
01:07:24,457 --> 01:07:25,666
but there's no wheelchair.

1097
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:27,835
Just sleep. It's the middle of the night.

1098
01:07:31,047 --> 01:07:31,881
Seriously?

1099
01:07:34,675 --> 01:07:36,010
Hold on tight.

1100
01:07:36,802 --> 01:07:37,636
You're heavy.

1101
01:07:40,306 --> 01:07:41,140
Hey.

1102
01:07:41,223 --> 01:07:43,851
How do you weigh a ton
with such a tiny head?

1103
01:07:43,934 --> 01:07:45,561
-Why do you talk so much?
-Goodness.

1104
01:07:46,312 --> 01:07:47,188
Soo-ho,

1105
01:07:47,271 --> 01:07:49,190
we'll settle all this when your legs heal.

1106
01:07:51,192 --> 01:07:52,193
Jeez.

1107
01:07:52,276 --> 01:07:54,278
Use your strength, Leaky.

1108
01:07:54,361 --> 01:07:55,738
I am using my strength.

1109
01:07:58,365 --> 01:07:59,658
What are you doing?

1110
01:07:59,742 --> 01:08:01,035
We didn't have a wheelchair.

1111
01:08:01,535 --> 01:08:03,120
You could've called for one.

1112
01:08:03,204 --> 01:08:04,705
Wait here, please.

1113
01:08:07,041 --> 01:08:09,126
Hey, you should have called them!

1114
01:08:09,210 --> 01:08:11,420
Why didn't you go get it
with your working legs?

1115
01:08:11,504 --> 01:08:13,756
-I didn't think of that!
-Me neither!

1116
01:08:13,839 --> 01:08:15,758
You're the top student.
Don't you use your brain?

1117
01:08:15,841 --> 01:08:16,842
What place are you in?

1118
01:08:33,317 --> 01:08:34,193
Why…

1119
01:08:35,611 --> 01:08:36,946
didn't you tell me back then?

1120
01:08:39,115 --> 01:08:40,866
That you didn't meet Se-yeon that day?

1121
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:45,746
All this time,

1122
01:08:46,705 --> 01:08:49,667
I thought Se-yeon did it because
you didn't believe him. That's why…

1123
01:08:52,294 --> 01:08:53,838
You should have told me.

1124
01:08:53,921 --> 01:08:55,047
So what if I'd told you?

1125
01:08:57,007 --> 01:08:58,843
It's not like he would have
come back to life.

1126
01:09:03,806 --> 01:09:05,975
I thought he had died because of me.

1127
01:09:10,563 --> 01:09:12,273
"If only I answered his call,

1128
01:09:16,110 --> 01:09:17,653
maybe I could have prevented it."

1129
01:09:22,324 --> 01:09:23,159
Is that…

1130
01:09:24,827 --> 01:09:27,079
what you've been thinking all this time?

1131
01:09:31,292 --> 01:09:32,418
You're so thick.

1132
01:09:44,555 --> 01:09:47,725
Ju-young, come here and have some fruit.

1133
01:09:49,059 --> 01:09:52,605
Where's Ju-kyung when it's the weekend?
Didn't she leave early in the morning?

1134
01:09:52,688 --> 01:09:53,522
Job.

1135
01:09:54,315 --> 01:09:55,149
What?

1136
01:09:56,775 --> 01:09:58,319
It's not my job to know.

1137
01:09:59,111 --> 01:10:01,405
You should care about your sister.

1138
01:10:01,488 --> 01:10:04,074
Lee Ju-hun, the CEO of Move Entertainment,

1139
01:10:04,158 --> 01:10:05,951
-What is he saying?
-revealed that Black Soul's

1140
01:10:06,035 --> 01:10:07,453
title track was plagiarized.

1141
01:10:07,536 --> 01:10:10,289
He announced his retirement
and resignation from the company.

1142
01:10:10,372 --> 01:10:12,750
-His retirement?
-Lee says that the title track

1143
01:10:12,833 --> 01:10:14,168
of the new group, Black Soul,

1144
01:10:14,251 --> 01:10:16,420
-Hello? Ma'am?
-was the late Jeong Se-yeon's…

1145
01:10:16,503 --> 01:10:17,922
-Did you see the news?
-Mom!

1146
01:10:18,005 --> 01:10:19,340
Lee Ju-hun's going to retire.

1147
01:10:19,423 --> 01:10:20,674
But Mr. Lee!

1148
01:10:21,217 --> 01:10:23,469
Why? My goodness!

1149
01:10:23,552 --> 01:10:25,971
No!

1150
01:10:27,598 --> 01:10:30,059
My dear Mr. Lee!

1151
01:10:30,142 --> 01:10:34,230
The two points on this graph
are defined as A and B, respectively.

1152
01:10:34,313 --> 01:10:37,399
Then the function value of A
becomes f of A,

1153
01:10:37,483 --> 01:10:39,318
and that of B becomes f of B.

1154
01:10:39,401 --> 01:10:42,196
Now, the limit.
Slicing it up into the tiniest possible…

1155
01:10:42,279 --> 01:10:44,573
Kangsu, it's huge. Have you seen the news?

1156
01:10:44,657 --> 01:10:45,574
Between A and B…

1157
01:10:45,658 --> 01:10:50,037
LEE JU-HUN ANNOUNCES RETIREMENT
AND APOLOGIZES FOR JEONG SE-YEON'S DEATH

1158
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:53,082
…B gradually moves lower, and…

1159
01:10:56,001 --> 01:10:56,835
Su-jin!

1160
01:11:06,470 --> 01:11:08,597
LEE JU-HUN REVEALS TRUTH
ABOUT JEONG SE-YEON'S DEATH

1161
01:11:23,737 --> 01:11:24,613
Soo-ho.

1162
01:11:35,291 --> 01:11:36,417
It's Ju-kyung, again.

1163
01:11:37,876 --> 01:11:38,711
Yes.

1164
01:11:46,593 --> 01:11:47,636
It's me again.

1165
01:11:49,179 --> 01:11:50,389
I missed you.

1166
01:11:54,810 --> 01:11:55,894
And you're here.

1167
01:11:58,814 --> 01:12:00,357
I came to give you a hug.

1168
01:13:59,935 --> 01:14:02,438
I poured out everything
I'd pressed down deep inside,

1169
01:14:02,521 --> 01:14:03,939
but it still feels heavy.

1170
01:14:04,731 --> 01:14:07,067
If you can't sleep at night,
talk to these guys.

1171
01:14:07,151 --> 01:14:10,112
Tell them all your sadness and worries.

1172
01:14:10,737 --> 01:14:12,197
It's Ju-kyung.

1173
01:14:12,281 --> 01:14:13,782
My girlfriend.

1174
01:14:13,866 --> 01:14:17,828
Goddess, how does it feel to turn
the world of social media upside down?

1175
01:14:17,911 --> 01:14:19,204
Lim Ju-kyung!

1176
01:14:19,705 --> 01:14:20,956
She transferred from Yongpa High School.

1177
01:14:21,039 --> 01:14:24,626
There was also a girl named
Lim Ju-kyung at my old school.

1178
01:14:24,710 --> 01:14:25,711
Are you

1179
01:14:25,794 --> 01:14:27,796
the same Kang Su-jin I used to know?

1180
01:14:28,380 --> 01:14:32,968
