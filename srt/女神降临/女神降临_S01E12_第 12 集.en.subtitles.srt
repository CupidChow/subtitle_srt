LEE JU-HUN REVEALS TRUTH
ABOUT JEONG SE-YEON'S DEATH

2
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:00,226
Soo-ho.

3
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:09,235
BASED ON WEBTOON TRUE BEAUTY
BY YAONGYI

4
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:12,030
It's Ju-kyung, again.

5
00:01:13,364 --> 00:01:14,199
Yes.

6
00:01:22,123 --> 00:01:23,124
It's me again.

7
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:26,211
I missed you.

8
00:01:30,298 --> 00:01:31,508
And you're here.

9
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,012
I came to give you a hug.

10
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:01,139
Are you doing okay?

11
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:05,476
I have almost no memories with my dad.

12
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:07,687
After my mom passed away,

13
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,773
my dad was mostly in the States.

14
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,777
I lived with my grandma on my mom's side,

15
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:18,281
then started living alone
in middle school.

16
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:22,118
It must have been tough.

17
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:26,414
I hated him for so long.

18
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:32,128
I poured out everything…

19
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,632
I'd pressed down deep inside,

20
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,385
thinking it might make my heart lighter,

21
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,222
but it still feels heavy.

22
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,697
Is this because I haven't forgiven him?

23
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,909
Or am I feeling sorry for him?

24
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:05,954
I'm not even quite sure…

25
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:10,959
how I'm feeling right now.

26
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:30,979
You did what?

27
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:32,814
Running out without a word?

28
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:34,607
Honey, calm down and use your words.

29
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:36,359
Are you out of your mind?

30
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:39,904
Don't you get how important
this period is for you?

31
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:42,949
How dare you?

32
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:44,951
Don't glare at me like that!

33
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:51,082
-You little…
-Honey, hold on.

34
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:52,083
Honey!

35
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:53,626
Calm down!

36
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:59,924
What are you doing right now?
Open the door!

37
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:03,011
I'll talk to her, so stop it!

38
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:03,970
Open the door!

39
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:33,958
Mr. Kang, how's the company?

40
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,043
It's out of control.

41
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:38,796
There are hordes of reporters
and Black Soul fans out front.

42
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,506
The loss and damages are huge.

43
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,633
Mr. Lee must not be himself either.

44
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:03,696
"STARLIGHT"

45
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:53,830
Hey.

46
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:57,333
Here.

47
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,003
It's gotten all loose.

48
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,757
Your cone looks slanted.

49
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:05,925
Try this one on then.

50
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:13,683
Lee Soo-ho, Han Seo-jun.

51
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:15,351
-How does it look?
-Not bad.

52
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:18,187
This stuff makes me cringe,
so I wasn't going to write it.

53
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,441
But during my acceptance speech,

54
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:23,693
I was busy crying,
so I didn't get to thank you.

55
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:26,737
I'm doing this so you won't sulk.

56
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:34,328
My life was like winter
until you two came along.

57
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:36,080
Thanks to you two,

58
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,042
the past three years have been very warm.

59
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:43,713
During those warm days,

60
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:44,630
I laughed a lot,

61
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,592
I regained my confidence,

62
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:51,471
and I was able to achieve my dream.

63
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:04,025
The brightest day of my life,

64
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:07,862
this moment with you today,

65
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:10,740
I'll remember it forever.

66
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,038
My dear friends,

67
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:20,041
I love you.

68
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:24,962
The moment you read this mushy letter,

69
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:26,422
I'll regret ever writing it.

70
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:29,258
Here's hoping you'll never find it.

71
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:31,719
Se-yeon.

72
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:53,574
Do you remember what he said
when we bought these?

73
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:56,118
"Let's be together forever"?

74
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,662
I called it childish.

75
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:01,082
Yes, you did.

76
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,793
Being together was a given back then.

77
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,505
I thought we'd be together forever.

78
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:12,385
Who knew that forever would be this short?

79
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:15,012
Right.

80
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:17,557
It was too short.

81
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:20,268
Leaving him alone when he was struggling

82
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:23,271
is something I regret
and feel terrible about.

83
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:26,190
And now he's gone.

84
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:30,444
So blaming you and cursing at you…

85
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:33,781
were my ways of coping.

86
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:37,994
I focused only on my pain,

87
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:40,496
and I didn't notice yours.

88
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:45,334
I'm sorry.

89
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:53,259
What's wrong with us?

90
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,272
MISSED CALL
DAD

91
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:12,445
How's your dad?

92
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,447
Who knows.

93
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,242
I used to be so jealous
of you having a rich dad,

94
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:20,536
but now I'm not jealous at all.

95
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:23,623
What's there to be jealous of?
You have your mom.

96
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,916
This isn't a pity competition.

97
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:28,210
Your family's rich!

98
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:30,713
Are we still?

99
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:34,383
People say rich people can eat
all three meals even after going bankrupt.

100
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,802
It's three generations, dummy.

101
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:37,803
What?

102
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:39,472
You really don't know anything.

103
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:43,059
Who throws a cigarette butt at people?

104
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,562
Who do you mean? Me?

105
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,985
You just threw a cigarette butt at us!

106
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:54,779
What are you? Some gangsters?

107
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:56,822
This boy called us gangsters.

108
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:58,658
-What?
-What?

109
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:01,160
-Who did?
-Who the heck are you?

110
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:02,536
-What is it?
-Hey.

111
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:04,330
What?

112
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:06,332
Come here, boy.

113
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:08,584
Look at that.

114
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:11,128
Hold back, okay?

115
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:12,296
Hey.

116
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,381
Let's run.

117
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:17,051
-Hey!
-Catch him.

118
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:19,345
-Boys, come here!
-Hey, you two!

119
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:21,972
Running like that won't help!

120
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:27,395
-You threw a crutch at us?
-Hey!

121
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:30,189
-Get them!
-You bastard! Come here!

122
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:31,440
Come here!

123
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:33,651
-Hey!
-Stop right there!

124
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:35,778
-Stop!
-Come here!

125
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:39,198
-Get them!
-Come here!

126
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:40,366
Get them!

127
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:42,451
Hey, grab them!

128
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:49,708
-Get them!
-Grab them!

129
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:52,753
Hey!

130
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:01,804
What's this smell?

131
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:03,639
Jeez.

132
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:05,516
-Hey, let me see.
-What's this?

133
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:07,226
They jumped into a pile of turds.

134
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,228
What did they use for manure?

135
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:11,397
Consider yourselves lucky, okay?

136
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:13,524
-Let's go, guys.
-Yes, sir.

137
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:18,237
-Turds?
-Jeez.

138
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:21,031
-Can't you control your temper?
-How could I have known?

139
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:23,909
I even gave you a piggyback ride.

140
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:25,828
Hey, my feet hurt.

141
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:27,538
The smell…

142
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,167
Stay away, jeez.

143
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:44,263
I wish Ju-kyung could see you right now.

144
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:46,599
You think she'd be disappointed?

145
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:49,018
That wouldn't make her fall for you.

146
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:52,521
What makes you say that?
Why are you so conscious of me?

147
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:53,522
How could I not be?

148
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:55,107
Are you over her yet?

149
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:56,692
It's not easy.

150
00:12:57,526 --> 00:12:58,527
Then,

151
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,446
are you going to tell her how you feel?

152
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:02,239
No way! She's dating you!

153
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:03,949
Get over her already.

154
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:05,910
It's not that easy.

155
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:07,536
What are you playing at then?

156
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,747
I don't know. Stay away! Scoot over.

157
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,749
-Don't touch me.
-I didn't touch you.

158
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,335
You have poop all over your face now.

159
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:15,336
The smell…

160
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:16,629
I can say the same, okay?

161
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,636
2ND ASSIGNMENT
CLASSIC ICON MAKEUP

162
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:28,641
Are you finally registering?

163
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:30,935
Yes, I got my pay
from my part-time job today.

164
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:33,521
Is our Limju going to be
the next Selena then?

165
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:35,189
MY FRIEND SU-AH

166
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:07,763

170
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:31,620
Don't spill food when you eat.

171
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,042
-Add the rice?
-Yes.

172
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:48,262
That was great.

173
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:49,889
Soo-ho, get me some water.

174
00:14:58,564 --> 00:14:59,732
It's my phone, okay?

175
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:02,610
Are you showing off that you're dating?

176
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:08,073
Did you two make up?

177
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:10,659
I told you to stay out of it.

178
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:11,869
How could I not?

179
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:15,039
Didn't you two fight because
people thought she and I were dating?

180
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:15,998
You're so petty.

181
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:20,377
But don't you think
she has a reason she can't tell people

182
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,087
about you two dating?

183
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:23,297
What reason?

184
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:27,551
Su-jin seemed to be that reason.

185
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,261
Su-jin?

186
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:34,183
How are you dating her
when you're this clueless?

187
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:36,769
Lately, I've begun

188
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:37,978
to care about you.

189
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:41,774
GIRLFRIEND

190
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:57,706
Hey, it's me…

191
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:00,918
Don't laugh.

192
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:02,294
Did you have a good day?

193
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:03,796
I almost had a good day.

194
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:05,756
The last part was very unexpected.

195
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,425
What? Why? What happened?

196
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:09,718
I fell into a pile of turds.

197
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:12,554
You know how to joke around, I see.

198
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:13,889
How's your leg?

199
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,641
Wasn't it difficult using a crutch?

200
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:17,643
The doctor said not to overexert yourself.

201
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:20,229
I looked it up.
Bananas, spinach, safflower seeds,

202
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:22,564
broccoli, and oranges are good for bones.

203
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:24,316
Remember that and make sure to eat them.

204
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,235
Bananas, spinach, safflower seeds…

205
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:30,489
-Why are you smiling?
-It's nice to hear you fuss.

206
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:31,991
Please continue.

207
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:34,284
Gosh, come on.

208
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:37,621
Oh, right. I have something for you.

209
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:38,998
What is it?

210
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:40,749
One second.

211
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:42,626
Where did it go?

212
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,003
Ta-da!

213
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:48,090
Don't you have anything for me?

214
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:49,675
Me?

215
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:55,472
Ta-da!

216
00:16:57,766 --> 00:16:58,642
I have another one.

217
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:02,771
Hey, Lim Ju-bal!

218
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,648
Hey! I told you to knock!

219
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:05,607
Can you take this?

220
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:06,650
What is it?

221
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:12,031
It stinks.

222
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:15,451
Are you serious? I'll get you!

223
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,081
Sorry about that.

224
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:24,084
-So--
-Good night, I'll call you tomorrow!

225
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:25,961
Darn it!

226
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,341
It stinks.

227
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:49,985
What's this?

228
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,653
Hey, Seo-jun!

229
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:53,906
Open the door! Hey!

230
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:55,657
Seo-jun!

231
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,753
We finally get to see each other.

232
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:08,921
I'll see you at school!

233
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:09,963
BOYFRIEND

234
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:11,757
Come home early, okay?

235
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,051
She's just like her dad, wandering around.

236
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:15,511
Bye, Mom!

237
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:16,845
That brat.

238
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:23,268
-I'm already here.
-Already?

239
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:35,280
You must have left home early.

240
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:37,533
You must be tired.
Why didn't you go straight to school?

241
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:38,951
We can't do this at school.

242
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:41,203
Let's hold hands until the bus stop.

243
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:46,125
Are you okay with this, though?
You wanted to tell people.

244
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:49,169
Well, that was the jealousy talking.

245
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:51,171
Jealousy?

246
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:53,632
There's no need for that.

247
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:56,760
We'll tell everyone
when you feel comfortable.

248
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,389
By the way, did Su-jin…

249
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:01,974
What's that?

250
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:04,935
It's nothing.

251
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:08,313
Excuse me.

252
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:11,567
Your bag was open.

253
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:13,443
Thanks.

254
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:16,822
Aren't you the new girl?
I saw you in the teachers' office.

255
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:18,782
Yes.

256
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:22,077
Joo Hye-min?

257
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:24,663
That's a pretty name.

258
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:34,840
Lim Ju-kyung!

259
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:04,703
Lim Ju-kyung?

260
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:11,919
Let's go, Su-jin.

261
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:26,016
What's Hye-min doing here?

262
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:28,769
She was in our school uniform.

263
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:31,521
Did she transfer here?
Why, all of a sudden?

264
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:32,522
What is it?

265
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:33,565
Is something wrong?

266
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:34,483
What?

267
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,361
No, it's nothing.

268
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:43,033
Hey, Soo-ho! Did your dad retire?

269
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,911
Congratulations on your full recovery.

270
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:47,412
-Applause.
-Applause.

271
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:49,373
There's no need for that.

272
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:54,753
Hey, Soo-ho.

273
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:57,422
You removed your cast?

274
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:58,882
So what if he did?

275
00:20:58,966 --> 00:20:59,800
I did.

276
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:01,635
Are they going to fight?

277
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:02,552
That's good.

278
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:06,765
Are you sleeping already?

279
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:10,269
-Yes.
-What's this calm vibe?

280
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:11,311
I guess it's better.

281
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:13,563
Yes, friends should be nice to each other.

282
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,857
Hey, Limju, you're here!

283
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,192
Hey, take a look.

284
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:20,112
I submitted your picture
to the Newstagram Goddess Competition.

285
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:22,281
Look, you're in second place right now!

286
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:24,908
You aren't that far behind,
so you could even win.

287
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:26,660
I see.

288
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:28,787
Are there perks for the winner?
Some money?

289
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:31,665
No, but it just feels good to win.

290
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:33,917
The leader of Girls On,
who debuted this spring,

291
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:35,711
was the winner last year.

292
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:38,213
She got super famous,
and the agency scouted her.

293
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,716
So what's good about being super famous?

294
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:44,428
Well, it just feels good
to be super famous.

295
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:46,847
I don't feel good at all.

296
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:49,182
It somehow became
an interschool competition.

297
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:51,852
Everyone's voting for the girl
from their own school.

298
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:54,938
Even though I got dropped out quickly,

299
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:58,108
I want you to win
for the honor of our school.

300
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:01,153
Yongpa High's girl
is annoyingly in the lead. Look.

301
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:06,742
Park Sam-mi?

302
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:19,421
-A goddess!
-A goddess!

303
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:21,173
And she's right next to me!

304
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:22,382
It's only natural, isn't it?

305
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:25,635
Hey, you practically begged everyone
to vote for you.

306
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:26,553
Right?

307
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:35,562
Hey, why did you submit my picture?
Please take it down.

308
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:38,732
It can't be taken down
while people are voting.

309
00:22:38,815 --> 00:22:40,067
What?

310
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:44,321
Hey, guys, log onto Newstagram
and vote for Limju! Hurry!

311
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:50,660
Like Ju-kyung's post only.

312
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:53,371
-Only Ju-kyung.
-Vote twice if you can.

313
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:06,510
HORROR, MIDNIGHT BUS

314
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:10,013
JUNIOR CLASS 5, NUMBER 25, LIM JU-KYUNG

315
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:19,106
What is it?

316
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:20,023
What?

317
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:22,442
Do you have something to say?

318
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:23,610
No, it's nothing.

319
00:23:24,277 --> 00:23:26,947
Goodness, Ju-kyung got an A-plus?

320
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:30,117
-Excuse me?
-She got a good grade.

321
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:31,993
An A-plus.

322
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:36,748
Is there any reason
she doesn't deserve an A-plus?

323
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:38,875
Her focus on horror fiction
was refreshing.

324
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:41,753
Her criticism of the division
between literary and genre fiction

325
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:43,421
was logical and laid out well.

326
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:45,590
This grade follows
the grading criteria to a T.

327
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:48,051
I didn't give her special treatment.

328
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:52,806
Your long-winded explanation
sounds like a petty excuse to me!

329
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:55,350
Now I'm actually suspicious.

330
00:23:55,433 --> 00:23:56,726
It wasn't long-winded…

331
00:23:57,644 --> 00:23:58,478
"Petty"?

332
00:23:59,104 --> 00:23:59,938
Me?

333
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:01,648
When?

334
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:03,483
Excuse me.

335
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:05,318
Sorry.

336
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:19,374
Soo-ho.

337
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:25,297
-Is your leg all better now?
-Yes.

338
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,174
That's great, I was worried.

339
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:29,718
What are you doing after school?

340
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:31,052
Can we talk?

341
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:33,221
What is it? We can talk now.

342
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:36,892
Well, not here. Can we talk later--

343
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:38,101
I already have plans.

344
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:41,354
Is it important? Can't you cancel it?

345
00:24:42,772 --> 00:24:44,774
It's something
I can only talk to you about.

346
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:47,485
Su-jin seemed to be that reason.

347
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:50,947
I have plans with my girlfriend.

348
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:54,409
I didn't tell you before.

349
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:56,203
It's Ju-kyung.

350
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:57,579
My girlfriend.

351
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:01,082
I'm not sure why,

352
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:03,501
but she doesn't feel comfortable
telling people yet,

353
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:05,086
so pretend you don't know.

354
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:08,340
Then why are you telling me?

355
00:25:08,423 --> 00:25:10,050
I thought I should tell you.

356
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:12,552
You're my friend.

357
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:43,041
Hey, people could see.

358
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:45,085
It'll be okay if I do this.

359
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:46,878
What?

360
00:25:47,754 --> 00:25:49,589
What? Soo-ho must still be recovering.

361
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:51,549
-Get better soon, Soo-ho.
-Thanks.

362
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:53,718
-How is he so tall?
-Way taller than you.

363
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:55,262
You see?

364
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:58,473
Is something wrong? You don't look well.

365
00:25:59,432 --> 00:26:00,809
No, it's nothing.

366
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:01,935
Hey, they're looking.

367
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:06,064
Kangsu said she saved our seats.

368
00:26:06,147 --> 00:26:07,399
She's right there.

369
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:09,818
-Enjoy your meal!
-Enjoy!

370
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:10,777
Hey.

371
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:13,655
-You're here.
-Gosh, I'm so hungry.

372
00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:21,663
Kangsu, who is this?

373
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:23,790
This is Hye-min.

374
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:26,584
We had a joint class together
and came to lunch after.

375
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:27,544
I see.

376
00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:29,087
-Hi.
-Hi.

377
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:30,422
Hi.

378
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:32,590
I haven't seen you before.
Did you transfer?

379
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:35,468
-Where are you from?
-She transferred from Yongpa High School.

380
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:38,513
I see.

381
00:26:38,596 --> 00:26:40,307
What? Yongpa High, again?

382
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:44,019
Limju, those guys who grabbed you
were also from Yongpa High School.

383
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:45,437
They're so annoying.

384
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,356
By the way, Ju-kyung,
you also transferred here.

385
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,066
Where did you say you were from?

386
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,528
You never told us, right?

387
00:26:53,611 --> 00:26:54,988
That's right.

388
00:26:55,071 --> 00:26:56,573
I don't think I've heard either.

389
00:26:56,656 --> 00:26:57,949
Where did you transfer from?

390
00:26:58,950 --> 00:26:59,784
Well…

391
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:03,913
I'm actually from far away.

392
00:27:05,623 --> 00:27:06,458
Hey,

393
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:09,210
don't we know each other?

394
00:27:13,256 --> 00:27:16,509
There was also a girl named
Lim Ju-kyung at my old school.

395
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:19,179
I thought you looked like her.

396
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:23,266
Really?

397
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:26,144
Limju, did you transfer
from Yongpa High School?

398
00:27:27,228 --> 00:27:28,063
No.

399
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:30,106
I don't know you.

400
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:33,610
I'm not sure how similar we look,

401
00:27:33,693 --> 00:27:35,862
but I didn't go to Yongpa High,
so get it straight.

402
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:39,491
Right.

403
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:41,284
I'm sorry.

404
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:43,661
You didn't need to be that harsh.

405
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:47,290
I'm not feeling well. Excuse me.

406
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:51,127
-Limju.
-Ju-kyung.

407
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:54,756
Is she that sick?

408
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,975
Do you really not know
or are you just playing dumb?

409
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:15,193
Can makeup make that much of a difference?

410
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:16,403
Even beyond recognition?

411
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:17,779
What?

412
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:25,620
PRINCE COMICS

413
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:27,747
She couldn't have recognized me.

414
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:30,708
At least she's not in my class.

415
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:33,086
That's it.

416
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:35,088
I won't get caught
if I don't get involved.

417
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:43,680
What are you doing?

418
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:48,435
It's nothing.

419
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:57,110
Here, this is for you.

420
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:02,741
Only kind people can see it.

421
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:05,660
There's a watch in there. Do you see it?
It's really expensive.

422
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:09,122
Give it to me.

423
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:12,792
If you ever feel out of breath again,

424
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:14,335
put this over your mouth,

425
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:18,673
inhale, then exhale,
and soon you'll calm down.

426
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:20,341
Always take it with you, okay?

427
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:24,804
There's more?

428
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:26,931
And these are worry dolls.

429
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:29,726
If you can't sleep at night,
talk to these guys.

430
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:32,896
Tell them all your sadness and worries.

431
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:34,606
If you sleep with them under your pillow,

432
00:29:34,689 --> 00:29:36,858
they will take away your troubles
as you sleep.

433
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:38,902
Come on, isn't that just a superstition?

434
00:29:38,985 --> 00:29:42,113
Hey, this is what people do
during psychological therapy.

435
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:43,740
I looked it all up.

436
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:53,708
They say knitting is good
for calming the mind.

437
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:56,002
-Knitting?
-Yes.

438
00:29:57,921 --> 00:29:59,130
And lastly,

439
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:00,632
ta-da!

440
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:03,468
I got it with my part-time pay.

441
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:05,428
It's our first matching item. Open it.

442
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:12,477
Aren't they cute?

443
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:17,232
But if we wear these and go to school,
won't everyone notice?

444
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:18,441
I know.

445
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:23,071
When we can actually tell them,
let's put these on then.

446
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:24,572
It's for keeping then?

447
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:26,908
Just keeping it boosts your mood, right?

448
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:36,042
Hey,

449
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:38,002
by any chance,

450
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:41,047
have you spoken with your dad since then?

451
00:30:44,425 --> 00:30:45,385
No.

452
00:30:46,469 --> 00:30:48,304
I know it can't happen anytime soon,

453
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:52,225
but I hope you'll speak to him
at least once.

454
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:56,729
I don't want you to have regrets.

455
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,234
Okay.

456
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:04,571
These worry dolls…

457
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:08,449
Don't you need them more?
You worry constantly.

458
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:13,413
No, these are for you.

459
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:15,415
They are so cute.

460
00:31:15,498 --> 00:31:16,666
I know, right?

461
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:19,502
They all have different expressions.

462
00:31:19,586 --> 00:31:21,462
RANK 3, SUNIL HIGH, KIM DA-YE

463
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:22,881
RANK 1, YONGPA HIGH, PARK SAM-MI

464
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:25,758
What? She's in the lead?

465
00:31:28,761 --> 00:31:30,346
RANK 2, SAEBOM HIGH, LIM JU-KYUNG

466
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:31,848
It should be Lim Ju-kyung.

467
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:39,022
Where is it?

468
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:42,066
What are you looking for?

469
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:43,234
My hoodie.

470
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:44,360
Did Mom put it in here?

471
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:47,572
What is it?

472
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:50,450
Are you all right?

473
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:53,536
It stinks. You kept your cast?

474
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:56,456
Rise up, spirit of the tiger. Roar!

475
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:57,498
Seo-jun!

476
00:31:58,291 --> 00:31:59,208
Roar!

477
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:02,003
This used to be my right arm.
I can't just throw it away.

478
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:04,672
But it's weird to hide it
like some sort of treasure.

479
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,132
It's memorabilia, okay?

480
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:07,425
When I look at this later,

481
00:32:07,508 --> 00:32:09,177
it'll remind me of how things were.

482
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:11,179
How rough I had it.

483
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:13,598
It'll bring all that back.
I can't throw it out.

484
00:32:13,681 --> 00:32:16,225
You're out of your mind.

485
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:19,020
My toes.

486
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:20,313
Are you all right?

487
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,154
She has a point.

488
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:30,949
I'll just throw it out.

489
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,290
But it used to be my right arm…

490
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:41,918
I can't just throw it away.

491
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:53,680
RANK 2, SAEBOM HIGH, LIM JU-KYUNG

492
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:54,597
What?

493
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,599
Why did it get liked?

494
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:19,163
FATHER

495
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:24,395
Like so?

496
00:34:27,648 --> 00:34:29,192
Like so.

497
00:34:30,693 --> 00:34:32,528
Does it really have a calming effect?

498
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:38,076
-She's here!
-She's here!

499
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:44,582
Behold, the glorious winner of
the 2020 Newstagram Goddess Competition.

500
00:34:44,665 --> 00:34:48,377
Here comes Lim Ju-kyung, our goddess!

501
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:50,463
What?

502
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:53,132
Ju-kyung, you beat
that Yongpa High girl and won!

503
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:55,176
What the heck?

504
00:34:55,843 --> 00:34:57,762
Why did I win the thing?

505
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:00,348
Goddess,

506
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:03,684
how does it feel to turn
the world of social media upside down?

507
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:05,728
-How does it feel?
-How does it feel?

508
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:17,573
I'm just honored to even have been
one of the finalists.

509
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:20,451
-What?
-What?

510
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:22,078
What? You got second place!

511
00:35:22,161 --> 00:35:22,995
What?

512
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:26,541
-Who the hell won then?
-That hurt.

513
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:27,792
WINNER, LIM JU-KYUNG

514
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:31,879
Ju-kyung, you might become a celebrity!

515
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:35,591
-Not just anyone can be a celebrity.
-But she might.

516
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:38,511
Su-ah, this is all because of you.

517
00:35:39,595 --> 00:35:43,266
Ju-kyung, just enjoy this moment!

518
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:46,060
-I want to be her agent.
-I'll be her stylist!

519
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:48,813
-It's perfect!
-It's so good!

520
00:35:48,896 --> 00:35:49,939
It's perfect!

521
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:54,068
What are you all doing here?

522
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:55,528
Leave.

523
00:35:56,028 --> 00:35:59,407
I did ask Soo-ho,
but he said he'd never do it.

524
00:36:00,032 --> 00:36:01,909
It's troubling. What do we do?

525
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:04,328
If everyone declines, then who will do it?

526
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:05,246
Exactly.

527
00:36:05,955 --> 00:36:07,415
-Why are you all here?
-What's this?

528
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:09,542
A girl from our school
is this year's Newstagram Goddess.

529
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:11,210
-Lim Ju-kyung from class five.
-Amazing.

530
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:12,503
If she's the Newstagram Goddess,

531
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:14,922
-she'll become a celebrity.
-What? Did you say star?

532
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:16,799
We have a star at our school?

533
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:18,467
-My goodness.
-Who is that?

534
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:20,219
Over there.

535
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:46,829
How long are you going to live like this?

536
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,345
Here.

537
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:08,142
How do you trip over your own foot?

538
00:37:09,518 --> 00:37:10,353
Why?

539
00:37:10,853 --> 00:37:12,188
Were you worried when I fell?

540
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,148
Were you sad for me?

541
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:17,026
Were you scared for me?

542
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:24,617
-Do you like me that much?
-What?

543
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:28,829
I do.

544
00:37:30,456 --> 00:37:34,460
Ju-young, you're a smart guy,
so you'll get what I'm saying.

545
00:37:36,879 --> 00:37:39,882
I see my charms are finally working.

546
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:42,385
Do you like flies or not?

547
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:43,302
Flies?

548
00:37:43,886 --> 00:37:44,720
I hate them.

549
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:47,974
If a fly buzzes around you
while you're sleeping,

550
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:48,933
how would you feel?

551
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:50,518
That'd be annoying and tiresome.

552
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:53,187
That's correct.

553
00:37:53,729 --> 00:37:54,563
What?

554
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:56,440
So just stop it.

555
00:37:57,024 --> 00:37:59,902
Since you're Ju-kyung's brother,
if you don't bother me much,

556
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:01,320
we can at least be friends.

557
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:07,910
A fly?

558
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:12,999
-Going straight to the academy?
-Yes.

559
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:16,419
-Hi.
-Hi!

560
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:18,879
I'm Park Sam-mi from Yongpa High.
You know me, right?

561
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:24,927
What? Hey.

562
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:28,931
Amazing.

563
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:31,559
I don't think so.

564
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:34,937
I saw you won the Goddess Competition.

565
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:36,605
You somehow even beat me.

566
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:41,193
Well, you look better in the picture.

567
00:38:41,777 --> 00:38:44,655
Still, you look totally different
from the Lim Ju-kyung I know.

568
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:48,326
Okay.

569
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:52,538
Are you that busy?

570
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:54,999
It's as if you're avoiding me.

571
00:38:57,835 --> 00:38:59,837
By the way, why isn't Han Seo-jun
coming out?

572
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:02,298
I'm not sure.

573
00:39:02,965 --> 00:39:03,799
Let's go, Su-jin.

574
00:39:06,093 --> 00:39:07,678
Jeez, she's totally ignoring me.

575
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:11,390
-What? That's Joo Hye-min!
-Hey, Hye-min!

576
00:39:11,932 --> 00:39:13,642
Where are you going?

577
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:15,603
Hye-min!

578
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:18,314
-Our darling girl.
-How have you been?

579
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:22,526
Smile, won't you?

580
00:39:24,403 --> 00:39:25,321
Let's go.

581
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:34,205
Hey, you dare ignore our texts?
Do you have a death wish?

582
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:37,750
I told you it wasn't like that.

583
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:42,088
I've watched them,
and she doesn't have a thing with Seo-jun.

584
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:45,508
Do you still think so?

585
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:46,801
You little brat.

586
00:39:48,594 --> 00:39:50,221
Hey, from now on,

587
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:53,265
keep following her around
and dig up some dirt on her.

588
00:39:53,849 --> 00:39:56,018
See if she flirts with other guys.

589
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:58,896
or has a bad temper.
Find me her dirty secrets.

590
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:02,149
Then I'll be able
to break them up, got it?

591
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:05,361
Are you not going to answer?

592
00:40:06,028 --> 00:40:07,238
Joo Hye-min!

593
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:12,743
Were you beating her up?

594
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:14,912
No way.

595
00:40:14,995 --> 00:40:17,540
We were just talking. What's up?

596
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:22,294
You…

597
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:25,464
were going to do homework with us today.

598
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:28,384
Did you forget?

599
00:40:29,051 --> 00:40:29,885
What?

600
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:32,054
Right.

601
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:35,724
She's coming with us today.

602
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:42,398
Homework is way more important.

603
00:40:43,023 --> 00:40:45,067
-Let's go.
-Where do you think you're going?

604
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:52,366
Hey,

605
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:54,160
who are you to butt in?

606
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:57,538
You're from Yongpa High School, right?

607
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:09,758
Thanks.

608
00:41:11,385 --> 00:41:12,470
I'm going to leave.

609
00:41:13,095 --> 00:41:13,929
Wait.

610
00:41:15,514 --> 00:41:17,683
You're Ju-kyung, right?

611
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:23,814
Thanks for helping me.

612
00:41:25,107 --> 00:41:27,943
By the way, Ju-kyung, you got so pretty.

613
00:41:28,777 --> 00:41:30,779
-I didn't recognize you at--
-Helping you…

614
00:41:33,073 --> 00:41:34,533
doesn't mean I've forgiven you.

615
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:41,499
I'm sorry for what I did back then.

616
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:44,376
If I hadn't gone along with it,

617
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:46,629
they would have done
what they did to you to me.

618
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:49,048
I was afraid.

619
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:54,553
But still, I shouldn't have done that.

620
00:41:55,304 --> 00:41:56,555
I'm really sorry.

621
00:42:00,142 --> 00:42:01,310
I don't want people…

622
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:04,647
to find out about my past.

623
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:09,693
So please don't act like
you know me at school.

624
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:11,529
I'll never tell.

625
00:42:11,612 --> 00:42:13,864
I won't tell anyone, so don't worry.

626
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:27,336
Spin the needle…

627
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:32,132
What are you doing?

628
00:42:33,133 --> 00:42:33,968
Are you knitting?

629
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,178
I hear it has a calming effect.

630
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:38,138
Sure. Whatever works.

631
00:42:39,098 --> 00:42:40,349
Why did you want to see me?

632
00:42:40,933 --> 00:42:42,226
I have to ask you something.

633
00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:45,229
You said the reason
Ju-kyung can't say we're dating

634
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:47,398
is because of Su-jin.

635
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:50,401
What did you mean? Do you know something?

636
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:51,860
Why do you ask?

637
00:42:51,944 --> 00:42:53,612
Ju-kyung's been acting weird lately.

638
00:42:54,863 --> 00:42:56,323
I feel like something's up.

639
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:59,326
Why do you ask me about
what's worrying your girlfriend?

640
00:43:01,328 --> 00:43:02,705
How is she acting weird?

641
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:06,750
Just the other day,

642
00:43:07,668 --> 00:43:09,837
she asked me about
her friend's friend's issue.

643
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:12,840
Her friend's friend got a boyfriend,

644
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:15,009
and her friend's friend's, well…

645
00:43:15,092 --> 00:43:16,260
likes her boyfriend.

646
00:43:16,343 --> 00:43:17,595
The friend's friend, then…

647
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:20,723
The friend told her out of the blue
how she liked the boyfriend…

648
00:43:20,806 --> 00:43:21,890
The friend's friend…

649
00:43:21,974 --> 00:43:23,684
The friend's friend's…

650
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:24,602
friend…

651
00:43:25,644 --> 00:43:27,062
If you don't get it, forget it.

652
00:43:29,064 --> 00:43:30,274
Then what about you?

653
00:43:30,357 --> 00:43:31,900
Aren't you and Su-jin old friends?

654
00:43:32,401 --> 00:43:34,361
Then can you drop anything
that I don't approve of?

655
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:36,280
Even throw away your friends?

656
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:38,073
When did she say that?

657
00:43:38,157 --> 00:43:39,992
When we made dumplings and cut toenails…

658
00:43:41,201 --> 00:43:42,036
Don't ask.

659
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:43,954
I don't even want to think about it.

660
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:49,585
Hey, you missed one stitch.

661
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:51,962
How do you know?

662
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:54,089
I tried it too when Go-un was into it.

663
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:56,925
It'll be ruined
if you don't fix it right away.

664
00:43:57,009 --> 00:43:57,843
Really?

665
00:44:03,265 --> 00:44:04,141
What do I do?

666
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:07,311
Let me see.

667
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:11,899
You can't pull off this simple task?

668
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:14,943
No, not like that.

669
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:18,822
Lee Soo-ho!

670
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:20,282
You said we were friends.

671
00:44:20,366 --> 00:44:23,535
You never came along when I begged you
to go to an Internet cafe.

672
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:25,537
You hang out with him
now that you made up?

673
00:44:25,621 --> 00:44:27,081
How can a love… no.

674
00:44:27,873 --> 00:44:28,999
How can a friendship change?

675
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:30,167
What's with him?

676
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:34,129
-Do you know how to knit?
-Yes.

677
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:35,881
I knitted a scarf for Tu-ah once.

678
00:44:35,964 --> 00:44:37,007
Are you knitting?

679
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:40,803
-So I put this here,
-Through here,

680
00:44:40,886 --> 00:44:41,929
then wrap it around.

681
00:44:42,012 --> 00:44:43,847
-Hey, Han Seo-jun!
-Like that?

682
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:45,182
Seriously?

683
00:44:45,265 --> 00:44:47,476
You ignored me when I asked you
to go to karaoke!

684
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:48,686
And now you're here?

685
00:44:48,769 --> 00:44:51,730
How can our friendship change like this?

686
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:54,316
Come sit.

687
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:56,235
I'm hungry.

688
00:44:58,445 --> 00:44:59,947
Were you waiting long?

689
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:01,407
Did your class go well?

690
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:02,324
Yes.

691
00:45:02,825 --> 00:45:06,036
-You didn't have to come all this way.
-I wanted to walk with you.

692
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:11,041
Ju-kyung.

693
00:45:11,917 --> 00:45:12,751
Yes?

694
00:45:12,835 --> 00:45:13,669
Right now,

695
00:45:14,586 --> 00:45:16,422
do you feel good or bad?

696
00:45:17,005 --> 00:45:18,090
Why do you ask?

697
00:45:18,173 --> 00:45:19,174
Just because.

698
00:45:19,258 --> 00:45:22,386
Good or bad?

699
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:26,014
Good.

700
00:45:31,478 --> 00:45:33,397
Are you not going to tell me what's wrong?

701
00:45:35,357 --> 00:45:36,400
Actually…

702
00:45:38,026 --> 00:45:40,112
A girl from my former school
transferred here.

703
00:45:41,029 --> 00:45:42,030
What?

704
00:45:42,114 --> 00:45:43,699
Was it not about Su-jin?

705
00:45:44,283 --> 00:45:47,578
I thought she wouldn't recognize me,
but she did right away.

706
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:49,580
Are you all right?

707
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:51,498
I'm nervous,

708
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:54,418
but thankfully,
she promised not to tell anyone.

709
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:56,128
You must have been shocked.

710
00:45:57,963 --> 00:45:58,881
Just a little.

711
00:46:00,966 --> 00:46:02,926
But I'm really okay now.

712
00:46:12,853 --> 00:46:13,896
Aren't you hungry?

713
00:46:13,979 --> 00:46:15,439
We could go get something yummy.

714
00:46:17,733 --> 00:46:18,859
What do you want to eat?

715
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:20,986
Anything you like.

716
00:46:28,994 --> 00:46:31,121
I didn't get pretty at all.

717
00:46:34,666 --> 00:46:36,418
My acne is acting up again.

718
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:40,506
BLACKHEAD REMOVER

719
00:46:45,928 --> 00:46:47,596
It's so annoying.

720
00:46:48,847 --> 00:46:50,849
Hee-kyung, do you want
to go on a blind date?

721
00:46:50,933 --> 00:46:53,018
The pork trotters place's son
has a friend--

722
00:46:53,101 --> 00:46:53,977
I have a boyfriend.

723
00:46:55,521 --> 00:46:56,855
-A boyfriend?
-A boyfriend?

724
00:46:57,397 --> 00:46:59,566
That's not a lie
to get out of the blind date?

725
00:47:00,108 --> 00:47:01,276
No, I'm serious.

726
00:47:01,902 --> 00:47:04,655
What? How long has it been?
What does he do?

727
00:47:04,738 --> 00:47:05,948
Is he handsome? How old is he?

728
00:47:06,865 --> 00:47:09,493
It's a secret for now.
I'll introduce you when we're ready.

729
00:47:09,576 --> 00:47:10,911
Do you have his picture?

730
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:13,330
I can tell what kind of person he is
by his looks.

731
00:47:13,956 --> 00:47:15,916
I'm dying to know more, seriously!

732
00:47:15,999 --> 00:47:18,085
What is he like?

733
00:47:20,128 --> 00:47:21,213
My grapefruit.

734
00:47:21,964 --> 00:47:22,839
Grapefruit?

735
00:47:22,923 --> 00:47:25,884
The more I get to know him,
the more adorable I find him.

736
00:47:26,593 --> 00:47:28,971
He's as refreshing as a fruit.

737
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:31,390
"Refreshing as a fruit"?

738
00:47:31,473 --> 00:47:32,933
I'm home.

739
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:34,935
You're home, Ju-young! Have some dinner.

740
00:47:36,103 --> 00:47:38,313
A mere fly doesn't deserve dinner.

741
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:47,489
Junior Lim Ju-kyung,
please come to the auditorium.

742
00:47:48,073 --> 00:47:49,199
You look so pretty!

743
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:51,618
Show us more confidence!

744
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:53,870
Ju-kyung! You're doing great!

745
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:55,747
Gosh, you look pretty!

746
00:47:55,831 --> 00:47:58,292
Goodness, the goddess is here!

747
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:02,546
You really have turned
the stage upside down!

748
00:48:02,629 --> 00:48:04,840
-You're super pretty!
-You look super nice!

749
00:48:05,632 --> 00:48:08,385
How did I end up here?

750
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:12,180
-She's a perfect school model!
-She sure is.

751
00:48:12,264 --> 00:48:13,223
A moment, please.

752
00:48:14,182 --> 00:48:16,643
Sir, do I really have to do this?

753
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:21,064
The school president or the top student
is usually the school model, no?

754
00:48:21,148 --> 00:48:21,982
That's right.

755
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:24,526
But Ju-kyung, they didn't want to do it.

756
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:25,444
Excuse me?

757
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:27,779
Then why do I have to…

758
00:48:27,863 --> 00:48:29,406
What do you mean, "have to"?

759
00:48:30,198 --> 00:48:32,284
I heard you were the star of the school.

760
00:48:32,367 --> 00:48:33,619
A star of all stars.

761
00:48:33,702 --> 00:48:35,746
Why wouldn't we want the star
to be our model?

762
00:48:35,829 --> 00:48:38,373
The main star of Saebom High School!

763
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:43,337
Can you do the pose again?

764
00:48:43,962 --> 00:48:45,422
You are so pretty, Ju-kyung!

765
00:48:48,967 --> 00:48:50,344
You look so lovely!

766
00:48:50,886 --> 00:48:51,887
Do it right, okay?

767
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:53,180
Correct your form.

768
00:48:53,805 --> 00:48:57,601
Our school's website
will feature your face then?

769
00:48:57,684 --> 00:49:01,438
The best-looking person at Saebom High,
Lim Ju-kyung!

770
00:49:01,521 --> 00:49:03,440
Please don't.

771
00:49:03,523 --> 00:49:05,108
As if I'm the best-looking person.

772
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:06,902
How many have you done to get sick?

773
00:49:06,985 --> 00:49:10,656
-Three, four, five…
-I did a hundred in a minute at your age.

774
00:49:10,739 --> 00:49:13,575
So did they make up
after staying in the hospital together?

775
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:15,494
As in misery loves company?

776
00:49:15,577 --> 00:49:17,079
-Seven.
-Something's wrong.

777
00:49:17,162 --> 00:49:18,455
Hold my legs properly.

778
00:49:18,538 --> 00:49:19,665
-Hurry up.
-Okay.

779
00:49:19,748 --> 00:49:22,000
-Do it again.
-Jeez.

780
00:49:22,084 --> 00:49:24,127
-One.
-Why are you counting from one?

781
00:49:25,712 --> 00:49:26,755
When I was your age…

782
00:49:26,838 --> 00:49:28,465
PARK SAM-MI
NEW MESSAGE

783
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:30,384
Who is it?

784
00:49:31,259 --> 00:49:33,345
-No one.
-Don't fool around and do it right.

785
00:49:33,428 --> 00:49:34,888
Put some effort into it.

786
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:36,640
Are you counting correctly?

787
00:49:42,896 --> 00:49:45,023
What was that?
Why are you taking my picture?

788
00:49:45,607 --> 00:49:46,441
Because you looked good?

789
00:49:48,527 --> 00:49:49,820
Don't you like Soo-ho?

790
00:49:50,487 --> 00:49:51,655
Yes. So?

791
00:49:52,614 --> 00:49:55,200
-Don't you know he's dating Ju-kyung?
-I know.

792
00:49:55,283 --> 00:49:57,953
But that didn't stop you
from liking Ju-kyung, did it?

793
00:50:10,924 --> 00:50:12,843
CAN YOU SEND PICS OF LIM JU-KYUNG?
SAM-MI: THEN YOU SEND PICS OF SEO-JUN!

794
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:19,182
IT'S A GIVE-AND-TAKE.
JUST ONE PICTURE, PLEASE?

795
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,944
He looks totally dreamy, thanks!

796
00:50:31,027 --> 00:50:33,405
But why do you want photos of her?

797
00:50:49,087 --> 00:50:50,380
Are these all you have?

798
00:50:51,965 --> 00:50:54,134
-I'm hungry after running.
-Let's go to the snack bar.

799
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:56,344
Okay, what should we get?

800
00:50:57,262 --> 00:50:58,221
Goodness, Limju.

801
00:51:00,307 --> 00:51:01,391
I'm sorry.

802
00:51:04,478 --> 00:51:05,562
Are you okay?

803
00:51:35,342 --> 00:51:37,469
Limju, what's wrong?
Looking for something?

804
00:51:37,552 --> 00:51:40,055
What do I do? I lost my necklace.

805
00:51:41,139 --> 00:51:42,724
Where is it? I never took it off.

806
00:51:42,808 --> 00:51:44,267
The one you always wear?

807
00:51:44,351 --> 00:51:45,977
-Yes.
-When was the last you saw it?

808
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:48,313
I saw it this morning.

809
00:51:48,897 --> 00:51:50,857
Maybe it came loose during PE class?

810
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:52,442
You think so?

811
00:51:52,526 --> 00:51:55,070
-I'll help you find it. Let's go.
-Thank you.

812
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:11,378
Where is it?

813
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:17,300
It should be somewhere here.

814
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:18,760
I told her not to look for it.

815
00:52:19,553 --> 00:52:21,304
She'll be here all night at this rate.

816
00:52:27,435 --> 00:52:28,562
You won't find it here.

817
00:52:30,647 --> 00:52:32,274
Someone must have already taken it.

818
00:52:32,357 --> 00:52:34,192
It wasn't at the lost and found.

819
00:52:34,276 --> 00:52:36,319
And I trust the people at our school.

820
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:38,113
What school pride.

821
00:52:38,655 --> 00:52:41,199
-Because you're now the school model?
-No, it's not.

822
00:52:41,867 --> 00:52:43,994
Hey, back off.
I don't want you to step on it.

823
00:52:44,077 --> 00:52:45,161
Shall I help you look?

824
00:52:45,745 --> 00:52:46,955
What will you give me?

825
00:52:48,665 --> 00:52:50,292
I'll treat you to spicy tteokbokki.

826
00:52:50,375 --> 00:52:53,211
No. Can you treat me
to something other than that?

827
00:52:53,295 --> 00:52:54,754
Why? You like that.

828
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:56,590
-You said you always crave it.
-Anyway.

829
00:52:57,299 --> 00:52:59,134
Treat me big time if I find it for you.

830
00:52:59,885 --> 00:53:01,052
Okay!

831
00:53:05,473 --> 00:53:08,184
-I found it!
-What? Really?

832
00:53:09,936 --> 00:53:11,438
500 won. It's huge.

833
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:13,523
What the heck?

834
00:53:20,822 --> 00:53:21,990
It's for real this time.

835
00:53:22,073 --> 00:53:23,366
Is this your necklace?

836
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:24,993
Did you find it?

837
00:53:29,497 --> 00:53:30,832
Why don't you just go home?

838
00:53:30,916 --> 00:53:33,376
Okay. I'll try harder this time.

839
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:35,211
Don't play around.

840
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:38,381
Soo-ho gave it to me as a gift,
so I need to find it.

841
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:40,216
Jeez.

842
00:53:41,468 --> 00:53:44,220
-I'm heading home.
-What? You said you'll help.

843
00:53:44,304 --> 00:53:45,722
I'm a busy person.

844
00:53:45,805 --> 00:53:47,933
Do you have to look for it
in this weather?

845
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:51,227
Is Soo-ho being petty about you losing it?

846
00:53:51,311 --> 00:53:52,479
No.

847
00:53:53,605 --> 00:53:54,898
It's important to me.

848
00:53:55,774 --> 00:53:57,317
That's why I want to find it.

849
00:53:58,193 --> 00:54:00,654
If it's so important,
you should've kept it safe.

850
00:54:00,737 --> 00:54:03,114
I know. What was I thinking?

851
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:06,493
I'm not going home
until I find the necklace.

852
00:54:10,455 --> 00:54:11,414
Good luck.

853
00:54:12,207 --> 00:54:13,041
I'm leaving.

854
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:19,589
What are these for?

855
00:54:21,967 --> 00:54:22,968
Whatever.

856
00:54:36,564 --> 00:54:37,857
How will I find it?

857
00:54:43,154 --> 00:54:44,030
Looking for this?

858
00:54:48,493 --> 00:54:49,869
Su-jin.

859
00:54:56,334 --> 00:54:57,293
What was that for?

860
00:54:59,212 --> 00:55:00,922
You knew who that belonged to.

861
00:55:01,589 --> 00:55:02,966
Yes, I did.

862
00:55:03,049 --> 00:55:04,926
Then why did you do that?

863
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:07,137
Because I like you.

864
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:10,390
You're not even surprised.

865
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:12,142
Did you know?

866
00:55:12,225 --> 00:55:14,519
Do you think this makes sense?

867
00:55:15,228 --> 00:55:17,063
Aren't you friends with Ju-kyung?

868
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:19,357
If only you give her up,
we can still be friends.

869
00:55:20,025 --> 00:55:22,986
-What?
-Ju-kyung is cheerful, kind, and warm.

870
00:55:23,069 --> 00:55:24,487
I like her too.

871
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:25,405
But…

872
00:55:26,531 --> 00:55:28,158
not as much as I like you.

873
00:55:28,241 --> 00:55:31,077
I'd rather lose her than you.

874
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:34,247
So, if you don't want to see her
lose a friend and get hurt,

875
00:55:34,330 --> 00:55:35,373
break up with her.

876
00:55:37,083 --> 00:55:38,001
Are you…

877
00:55:39,294 --> 00:55:41,212
the same Kang Su-jin I used to know?

878
00:55:41,296 --> 00:55:43,173
Why did it have to be Ju-kyung?

879
00:55:47,719 --> 00:55:49,387
You haven't known her for that long.

880
00:55:49,471 --> 00:55:52,265
Why her and not me who's been with you
for the past ten years?

881
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:57,353
Can't you just break up with Ju-kyung
and like me instead?

882
00:55:57,437 --> 00:55:58,688
That will make things okay.

883
00:55:59,272 --> 00:56:01,149
If I had told you I liked you first,

884
00:56:01,232 --> 00:56:03,276
wouldn't you have chosen me anyway?

885
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:07,697
No.

886
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:10,742
I wouldn't have.

887
00:56:42,107 --> 00:56:43,691
Don't look for the necklace.

888
00:56:57,330 --> 00:56:58,957
Should I have just one more?

889
00:56:59,874 --> 00:57:00,792
It's getting late.

890
00:57:00,875 --> 00:57:03,545
Yes, it's getting late.
I really shouldn't.

891
00:57:05,296 --> 00:57:08,049
I'll go on a diet and become handsome.
I'm done.

892
00:57:08,133 --> 00:57:09,425
I don't think it's possible.

893
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:11,344
What?

894
00:57:11,427 --> 00:57:12,262
Come on.

895
00:57:12,762 --> 00:57:15,181
I actually look all right
if I lose some weight!

896
00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:19,602
I'm leaving.

897
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:22,397
You didn't even finish.
Where are you going?

898
00:57:24,858 --> 00:57:25,692
So wasteful.

899
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:28,069
I'm putting on weight because of you.

900
00:57:43,626 --> 00:57:45,962
Did someone really find it and take it?

901
00:57:54,679 --> 00:57:56,055
-Ju-kyung.
-My gosh!

902
00:58:01,102 --> 00:58:02,562
I knew you'd be still here.

903
00:58:02,645 --> 00:58:04,898
I didn't want to give up
without looking for it.

904
00:58:04,981 --> 00:58:06,274
Do you know how late it is?

905
00:58:06,357 --> 00:58:09,152
I was going to leave
after looking here anyway.

906
00:58:10,195 --> 00:58:12,739
Then we're going to leave
after searching here, okay?

907
00:58:12,822 --> 00:58:13,907
Okay.

908
00:58:15,992 --> 00:58:18,453
You search over there.
I'll search over here.

909
00:58:18,536 --> 00:58:19,954
I already looked over there.

910
00:58:20,038 --> 00:58:21,789
It wasn't there. Let's look over here.

911
00:58:21,873 --> 00:58:22,707
Still,

912
00:58:23,583 --> 00:58:25,084
why don't you go look again?

913
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:27,587
I double-checked every speck of dust.

914
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:29,005
It just can't be there.

915
00:58:29,088 --> 00:58:31,299
Never say never. Are you 100% sure?

916
00:58:32,091 --> 00:58:33,134
100%?

917
00:58:34,594 --> 00:58:36,971
Well, not that much…

918
00:58:37,055 --> 00:58:39,432
Then go look again.

919
00:58:41,309 --> 00:58:42,435
Okay.

920
00:58:43,311 --> 00:58:44,854
I looked there earlier…

921
00:59:00,119 --> 00:59:00,954
I found it!

922
00:59:02,872 --> 00:59:04,290
What a relief.

923
00:59:09,963 --> 00:59:11,089
That's great.

924
00:59:12,257 --> 00:59:13,341
Why did I come here?

925
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:18,221
See? It's a good thing I looked for it.

926
00:59:18,304 --> 00:59:19,138
Right?

927
00:59:19,806 --> 00:59:21,391
Yes, you did well.

928
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:25,311
I'll do it for you.

929
00:59:59,971 --> 01:00:01,806
Hey, who's there?

930
01:00:04,892 --> 01:00:05,727
Let's go.

931
01:00:19,365 --> 01:00:20,908
Someone was here for sure.

932
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:41,804
Was I seeing things?

933
01:00:45,850 --> 01:00:47,101
Hee-kyung!

934
01:00:49,312 --> 01:00:51,773
-Are you okay, Hee-kyung?
-Okay.

935
01:00:52,899 --> 01:00:54,025
Mr. Han?

936
01:00:56,069 --> 01:00:56,903
Hello.

937
01:00:59,614 --> 01:01:00,615
Hi.

938
01:01:09,582 --> 01:01:13,002
I'm bored. Should we go to karaoke?

939
01:01:13,086 --> 01:01:13,920
Hey,

940
01:01:14,545 --> 01:01:15,463
how does this look?

941
01:01:15,546 --> 01:01:17,632
-Not pretty.
-Not pretty?

942
01:01:18,883 --> 01:01:21,094
-Something is off.
-What is?

943
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:23,388
Why did Lim Ju-kyung's friend

944
01:01:23,471 --> 01:01:25,932
ask for Lim Ju-kyung's pictures?

945
01:01:26,516 --> 01:01:27,767
What are you talking about?

946
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:29,519
Why didn't she take them herself?

947
01:01:29,602 --> 01:01:31,813
Well, they're two different people, so…

948
01:01:33,606 --> 01:01:34,649
What do you mean?

949
01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:41,864
I'm so dumb.

950
01:01:42,448 --> 01:01:45,535
KANG SU-JIN

951
01:01:45,618 --> 01:01:47,620
Gosh, this is crazy.

952
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:48,996
Hey, Kang Su-jin!

953
01:01:52,291 --> 01:01:53,251
You got here fast.

954
01:01:53,334 --> 01:01:54,627
You called us out here?

955
01:01:55,336 --> 01:01:56,546
We came here to meet her?

956
01:01:56,629 --> 01:01:58,840
I had something to ask her too.

957
01:01:59,674 --> 01:02:00,508
Hey.

958
01:02:01,008 --> 01:02:02,427
Give me a straight answer.

959
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:05,680
Is she the same person?

960
01:02:11,978 --> 01:02:13,521
I heard you haven't eaten yet.

961
01:02:14,439 --> 01:02:15,314
Well…

962
01:02:15,857 --> 01:02:17,692
-Let's eat first and calmly--
-You.

963
01:02:18,276 --> 01:02:19,652
What were you doing there so late?

964
01:02:19,736 --> 01:02:21,571
I could ask the same of you.

965
01:02:21,654 --> 01:02:23,406
I asked you first!

966
01:02:23,489 --> 01:02:24,574
Add the dumplings.

967
01:02:24,657 --> 01:02:26,617
-I was looking for my necklace.
-Necklace?

968
01:02:26,701 --> 01:02:27,535
What necklace?

969
01:02:30,121 --> 01:02:31,497
It's pretty. Was it a gift?

970
01:02:31,581 --> 01:02:32,415
Yes.

971
01:02:32,915 --> 01:02:35,626
Why were you hiding under the desk
with my teacher?

972
01:02:35,710 --> 01:02:37,920
-Sir, the glass noodles go in later.
-Okay.

973
01:02:38,004 --> 01:02:38,880
We're dating.

974
01:02:41,632 --> 01:02:43,092
Your "refreshing as a fruit" boyfriend…

975
01:02:44,594 --> 01:02:45,678
is my teacher?

976
01:02:45,762 --> 01:02:47,054
Are you crazy?

977
01:02:47,138 --> 01:02:48,431
Yes, I'm crazy in love.

978
01:02:48,514 --> 01:02:50,892
Can't two adults with healthy bodies
and minds be in love?

979
01:02:50,975 --> 01:02:51,934
It's boiling.

980
01:02:53,186 --> 01:02:55,396
So you were playing love games
at my school?

981
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:56,856
Because you're crazy in love?

982
01:02:56,939 --> 01:02:58,316
I wouldn't say that.

983
01:02:58,399 --> 01:03:00,735
I was working late, and my Hee… No.

984
01:03:00,818 --> 01:03:03,279
Hee-kyung brought me some snacks…

985
01:03:03,362 --> 01:03:06,199
My grapefruit was so adamant
about not getting caught by you--

986
01:03:07,408 --> 01:03:08,326
-"Grapefruit"?
-"Grapefruit"?

987
01:03:08,409 --> 01:03:10,328
I hid because Jun-woo was so worried.

988
01:03:10,411 --> 01:03:13,873
Why did it have to be my teacher?
How can I go to school knowing this?

989
01:03:13,956 --> 01:03:17,043
I could say the same
about you dating my boss's son!

990
01:03:17,752 --> 01:03:19,003
Is it okay now that he resigned?

991
01:03:19,670 --> 01:03:21,798
-Anyway!
-Were there no other guys out there?

992
01:03:21,881 --> 01:03:23,758
My grapefruit is special!

993
01:03:25,259 --> 01:03:27,178
I said not to add the noodles yet!

994
01:03:27,261 --> 01:03:28,846
It has to boil more first!

995
01:03:29,347 --> 01:03:31,015
-Are we having fried rice after?
-Of course.

996
01:03:31,098 --> 01:03:32,141
-Extra cheese?
-Add two orders.

997
01:03:32,225 --> 01:03:33,810
Two fried rice, please.

998
01:03:33,893 --> 01:03:35,603
-Ma'am, can we have soda too?
-Sure.

999
01:03:35,686 --> 01:03:36,687
Goodness.

1000
01:03:37,563 --> 01:03:38,606
She's not answering?

1001
01:03:39,315 --> 01:03:40,316
She's making me mad.

1002
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:42,944
Where does Ju-kyung live again?

1003
01:03:51,035 --> 01:03:52,662
How did those two meet anyway?

1004
01:03:53,996 --> 01:03:56,582
How do I face him tomorrow at school?

1005
01:03:57,333 --> 01:03:59,085
Is it that uncomfortable for you?

1006
01:03:59,168 --> 01:04:00,461
Of course, it is.

1007
01:04:01,045 --> 01:04:02,797
I need to be extra careful at school.

1008
01:04:03,381 --> 01:04:05,258
He could report to my sister right away.

1009
01:04:08,594 --> 01:04:11,389
Do you think he looks like a grapefruit?

1010
01:04:11,472 --> 01:04:12,473
No.

1011
01:04:13,599 --> 01:04:15,643
She must be crazy in love.

1012
01:04:16,227 --> 01:04:17,353
PRINCE COMICS

1013
01:04:20,314 --> 01:04:22,525
-Good night!
-Good night!

1014
01:04:26,112 --> 01:04:26,946
Is it this way?

1015
01:04:27,029 --> 01:04:28,698
-This way?
-This way.

1016
01:04:29,198 --> 01:04:30,783
-This way, girl.
-This way?

1017
01:04:30,867 --> 01:04:31,742
MY BABY SISTER

1018
01:04:31,826 --> 01:04:32,702
Is your shift over?

1019
01:04:52,305 --> 01:04:53,848
-It stinks.
-Where is it?

1020
01:04:54,724 --> 01:04:55,850
I think it's over there.

1021
01:04:55,933 --> 01:04:57,727
-She lives in a dump.
-It's so gross.

1022
01:04:57,810 --> 01:04:58,728
Hey, Park Sam-mi.

1023
01:05:00,646 --> 01:05:01,647
Han Seo-jun?

1024
01:05:02,982 --> 01:05:04,358
Why are you here?

1025
01:05:18,623 --> 01:05:19,749
We're here.

1026
01:05:20,666 --> 01:05:21,667
Yes, we are.

1027
01:05:26,797 --> 01:05:27,798
Hey, Han Seo-jun!

1028
01:05:27,882 --> 01:05:29,592
Why did you come to see Ju-kyung?

1029
01:05:29,675 --> 01:05:32,219
I wanted to talk to her
since it's been a while.

1030
01:05:32,303 --> 01:05:35,973
-"Been a while"?
-It turns out she's someone I know.

1031
01:05:41,312 --> 01:05:42,772
-What's this?
-Don't you get it?

1032
01:05:43,397 --> 01:05:45,942
That's Lim Ju-kyung.

1033
01:05:49,528 --> 01:05:50,696
He doesn't recognize her.

1034
01:05:51,656 --> 01:05:54,158
Why? Are you shocked?

1035
01:05:54,241 --> 01:05:56,744
She totally fooled me too.

1036
01:05:57,244 --> 01:05:58,913
Why are you showing me this?

1037
01:05:58,996 --> 01:06:01,123
I'm worried for you, that's why.

1038
01:06:01,207 --> 01:06:04,377
I wouldn't want to date someone
who used to look like this, would you?

1039
01:06:04,961 --> 01:06:08,422
She used to run errands for me.

1040
01:06:08,506 --> 01:06:09,715
A total loser.

1041
01:06:09,799 --> 01:06:12,218
You're way out of her league.

1042
01:06:13,344 --> 01:06:16,013
To me, she looks prettier
than someone like you.

1043
01:06:16,597 --> 01:06:17,431
What?

1044
01:06:17,932 --> 01:06:19,684
Are you taking your girlfriend's side?

1045
01:06:20,226 --> 01:06:21,519
Or are you blind?

1046
01:06:21,602 --> 01:06:24,021
-She's covered in makeup.
-Is that okay?

1047
01:06:24,105 --> 01:06:26,691
Come on.
Her bare face looks super ugly, and you…

1048
01:06:27,316 --> 01:06:28,526
Goodness!

1049
01:06:28,609 --> 01:06:30,152
Hey, Han Seo-jun!

1050
01:06:31,070 --> 01:06:31,904
The thing is,

1051
01:06:32,697 --> 01:06:35,241
delinquents bullying someone
reminds me of my friend,

1052
01:06:35,324 --> 01:06:36,784
and I just can't think straight.

1053
01:06:36,867 --> 01:06:37,994
Running errands for you?

1054
01:06:39,036 --> 01:06:41,414
If I ever catch you
pulling a stunt like this again,

1055
01:06:42,331 --> 01:06:43,290
you'll pay for it.

1056
01:06:56,387 --> 01:06:58,264
You should go now.

1057
01:06:59,390 --> 01:07:00,558
You should go in first.

1058
01:07:02,143 --> 01:07:04,478
Okay. I'll go in now, really.

1059
01:07:05,312 --> 01:07:06,397
I'll see you tomorrow.

1060
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:05,623
What we couldn't do earlier.

1061
01:09:10,146 --> 01:09:13,899
SHINING FACE! BRIGHT SMILE!
A HAPPY SCHOOL FOR ALL!

1062
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:17,278
What are all these?

1063
01:09:17,361 --> 01:09:18,696
It's embarrassing.

1064
01:09:27,079 --> 01:09:31,333
WELCOME TO THE NEW STUDENT ORIENTATION
FOR SAEBOM HIGH SCHOOL

1065
01:09:31,417 --> 01:09:34,879
Mom, look. I'm the school model.

1066
01:09:36,630 --> 01:09:38,549
Look, the supposed Saebom High goddess.

1067
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:40,968
Hi.

1068
01:09:41,051 --> 01:09:42,845
She's the face of our school?

1069
01:09:43,512 --> 01:09:44,346
Let's just go.

1070
01:09:51,770 --> 01:09:54,857
THE BRIGHT FUTURE OF SAEBOM HIGH!
A VIBRANT TOMORROW!

1071
01:10:01,071 --> 01:10:03,324
-Hey, come here. Look at this!
-Come here.

1072
01:10:03,407 --> 01:10:04,700
This is so ridiculous.

1073
01:10:05,492 --> 01:10:07,703
-Preposterous, right? Look.
-Gosh.

1074
01:10:26,931 --> 01:10:28,307
Goddess, my foot.

1075
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:35,731
You be the goddess instead.

1076
01:10:49,370 --> 01:10:50,246
This is nuts.

1077
01:10:50,329 --> 01:10:51,914
She doesn't look like the photos at all.

1078
01:10:51,997 --> 01:10:53,874
-How is that her?
-Does that look like her?

1079
01:10:54,458 --> 01:10:56,919
Ju-kyung, is this really you?

1080
01:10:59,505 --> 01:11:02,049
The truth about Lim Ju-kyung,
Saebom High Goddess.

1081
01:11:02,132 --> 01:11:04,468
She was known for running dumpling errands
before her transfer.

1082
01:11:04,551 --> 01:11:06,428
You are all going to be so shocked.

1083
01:11:06,512 --> 01:11:08,514
She's super ugly. It's all her makeup.

1084
01:11:14,061 --> 01:11:15,104
-Gosh.
-That's not her.

1085
01:11:15,187 --> 01:11:16,981
-It's two different people.
-It's crazy.

1086
01:11:17,064 --> 01:11:18,983
-I'm rather amazed.
-Hey, it can't be true.

1087
01:11:22,319 --> 01:11:24,613
Because you are ugly.

1088
01:11:31,078 --> 01:11:34,081
-This is over the line.
-This is wild.

1089
01:11:34,164 --> 01:11:36,542
Gosh, seriously. What is this?

1090
01:12:00,941 --> 01:12:02,109
She's a fraud.

1091
01:12:02,192 --> 01:12:04,236
Shouldn't she see a dermatologist?

1092
01:12:12,828 --> 01:12:13,662
Ju-kyung.

1093
01:12:23,130 --> 01:12:24,381
Ju-kyung.

1094
01:12:30,429 --> 01:12:31,347
Ju-kyung.

1095
01:12:52,368 --> 01:12:54,286
THANK YOU TO CHANI
FOR HIS SPECIAL APPEARANCE

1096
01:13:20,562 --> 01:13:23,690
People now know about my true face.

1097
01:13:23,774 --> 01:13:25,609
That's why I can't look you in the eye.

1098
01:13:26,902 --> 01:13:28,362
Why don't you just rip it off?

1099
01:13:28,445 --> 01:13:30,531
No one would do such a thing
other than you.

1100
01:13:30,614 --> 01:13:31,532
You're wrong.

1101
01:13:31,615 --> 01:13:33,200
You really didn't know?

1102
01:13:33,283 --> 01:13:35,160
You're best friends with Ju-kyung.

1103
01:13:35,244 --> 01:13:36,703
Whatever you look like,

1104
01:13:36,787 --> 01:13:39,957
with or without makeup,
you're always you, Ju-kyung.

1105
01:13:41,333 --> 01:13:44,878
Run away as far as you can and hide.

1106
01:13:44,962 --> 01:13:48,382
Don't you worry. I'll get you transferred
to somewhere no one knows you.

1107
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:54,680
