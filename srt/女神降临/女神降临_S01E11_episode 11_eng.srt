 True Beauty 

2
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:20,110


3
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:32,110
 True Beauty 

4
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:35,670
  Episode 11  
 Yes, I understand.

5
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:37,880
- Chairman. 
 - What is it?

6
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,570
Did you have to go this far?

7
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:42,980
- Assistant Manager Im, what are you doing right now?
 - I'm sure you didn't want it.

8
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:46,100
Se Yeon's name being brought up again.

9
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:50,540
But still, just to cover your embarrassment, you're stealing songs?

10
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:53,590
- What is she talking about? 
 - It's nothing.

11
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,320
You think the CEO will care about every newbie?

12
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,800
Come out. Come out and talk with me.

13
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,350
Let go. I said let go!

14
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:15,040
Just to cover up one picture of you and a young actress,

15
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,890
you released news about Se Yeon's school violence.

16
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:22,750
If you felt even a drop of guilt about Se Yeon's death, then you shouldn't have gone this far.

17
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:26,420
Even if it's not copyrighted, this is an obvious plagiarism.

18
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:31,800
- How dare you come here and give me bullshit?
- Get out.

19
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:35,080
Se Yeon and Leo are only 18.

20
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,270
You have a son too.

21
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:40,070
If you're even a little bit sorry to the kids like your son,

22
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:43,460
you should take down the song and fix it.

23
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:48,890
Don't you think it'll look better for you to resolve it than me whistleblowing?

24
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:55,810
So are you threatening me?

25
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:58,100
Think as you wish.

26
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:00,450
Because I'm risking my job to tell you this.

27
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:02,800
Get out. Are you crazy?

28
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,450
I will get out myself.

29
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:22,800
Su Ho.

30
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:27,630
Su Ho.

31
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:35,400
Hey, Lee Su Ho! Did you perhaps hear it too?

32
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,230
The new song from Move.

33
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:40,580
That bastard. Hey!

34
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:43,420
Hey, Lee Su Ho!

35
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:56,010
  Hey, hey. How's this? It's cool, right? Should the three of us match? 

36
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:58,420
 - That sounds pretty good. 
 - What matching? It's childish. 

37
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:01,030
 Hurry and put it on. I'll buy it for you. 

38
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:07,830
  There we go. Hurry and look. 

39
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:10,680
  You guys can never take this off, okay? 

40
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,030
  Speak for yourself. 

41
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:32,230
♫  A sky colored violet  ♫

42
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:37,340
♫  A night getting colder in the mournful wind  ♫

43
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:40,420
♫  Congratulations! Congratulations! 

44
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:43,740
♫  Congratulations on Jeong Se Yeon's debut. 

45
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:47,290
 - Congrats!
- You rascal. Why didn't you tell us that you were finalized to debut? 

46
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:49,830
 - Cause I felt sorry to you.
- What are you sorry for? 

47
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:54,570
  You started it first, so it's obvious you're debuting first. Congrats, Jeong Se Yeon! 

48
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:57,160
  Come here. 

49
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:00,390
  Leo. What do you think? 

50
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:03,820
 - It's pretty good, right?
- Leo. It matches perfectly with Su Ho. 

51
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:06,700
 Leo. Se Yeon. 

52
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:09,780
 Then when I debut, you guys are giving me this song, okay? 

53
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:12,350
 Why would we give you this? 

54
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:14,040
 When I'll be doing a duet with you later. 

55
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,880
 With whose permission? I first need to listen to you singing it. 

56
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,090
 Is it an audition? 

57
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:22,360
 - Wow.
- Audition. Sounds good. 

58
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:29,690
♫  Because when I close my eyes, you are distinct  ♫

59
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:36,540
♫  Because I miss you more when you shined  ♫

60
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:43,930
♫  In the place where you spent a long night  ♫

61
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:51,240
♫  I am going to rest a while. Stay with me.  ♫

62
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:59,020
♫  In my tired heart bursting with tears  ♫

63
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:05,840
♫  When my song reaches the sky  ♫

64
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:13,570
♫  Come slowly like an eternal dream  ♫

65
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:19,950
♫  Become a star at my side  ♫

66
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:22,320
This way, hurry!

67
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:31,310
   

68
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:39,130
 Su Ho! 

69
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:43,200
 Su Ho. Su Ho! Open this door, Su Ho. 

70
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,640
 Su Ho! 

71
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,770
 Please, just once. 

72
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:49,660
 Su Ho. Su Ho! 

73
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,670
 - Isn't that Jeong Se Yeon? 
 - Jeong Se Yeon? 

74
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:53,410
 - Jeong Se Yeon... 
 - The school violence. 

75
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:55,160
 Oh, the one who's trending on search engines? 

76
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:59,020
 - It's totally blowing up right now. 
 - What's he doing here? 

77
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:01,660
 To: Se Yeon 
Are you done with practice? 

78
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:06,750
 Mr. Choi, the CEO is so busy nowadays  that he doesn't even have time to date. 

79
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:09,170
 He just finished the shoot and had a drink with her. 

80
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:13,170
 What sponsor? What kind of nonsensical rumor is this? 

81
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:15,800
 Of course. 

82
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,800
 Jeong Se Yeon 

83
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:33,140
 Jeong Se Yeon 

84
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,180
 N6's Jeong Se Yeon is a school violence perpetrator? 

85
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:42,080
 Given the lack of a management response, it is unknown whether Jeong Se Yeon will continue to work as an idol. 

86
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,520
  People who use violence at school should just go die. 

87
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:47,320
 He should be six feet under the ground. Doesn't he feel sorry for his victims? 

88
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,270
 It's really not me. 

89
00:06:56,100 --> 00:07:00,600
 I really didn't do it.  I'm really not. 

90
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,420
 I heard the guy who committed suicide is Jeong Se Yeon. 

91
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:33,930
 The idol Jeong Se Yeon? 

92
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:36,760
 - You can't come inside.
- Get out. 

93
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:20,000
 Boyfriend 

94
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:31,070
  The phone is turned off. After the beep... 

95
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:52,290
Ju Gyeong, what are you doing here at this time?

96
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:56,200
I came because I have something to say.

97
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,400
Something to say?

98
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:02,160
Because I don't think it'll be good to drag it out.

99
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,370
Su Jin, to be honest...

100
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,900
Lee Su Ho and I are dating.

101
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,200
I also really like him a lot.

102
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:24,030
I really wasn't trying to hide this from you.

103
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:27,680
I was going to tell you first,

104
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,880
but because you told me you like Su Ho,

105
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,270
I couldn't tell you.

106
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:38,110
I was worried we would become distant...

107
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:42,920
I didn't want to lose you.

108
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:50,620
But I couldn't deceive you any longer.

109
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:53,180
I'm really sorry.

110
00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:07,190
- Okay. Honestly, it would be a lie if I said that I feel fine. I'm upset. 
 - I'm sorry.

111
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:13,270
But... Even back then, I've had these feelings for Lee Su Ho come about for a little while.

112
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:15,830
Back then, the feelings went away right away too.

113
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:22,220
After having been friends for so long, it's natural to waver and get confused at least once.

114
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:26,040
It's just feelings to that extent.

115
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,530
So don't feel too sorry.

116
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:31,950
- Su Jin. 
 - Hey! Because you're like this for nothing,

117
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:36,470
it seems like I just made you have a hard time. Don't cry.

118
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:40,340
Did you commit a sin or something? Hurry and lift up your head.

119
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:45,170
It's because I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

120
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:53,450
Lee Su Ho's feelings are for you, so what can I do?

121
00:10:54,070 --> 00:11:02,320
If I just sort out myself well, then there won't be a change between you and  Lee Su Ho and you and me.

122
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:35,530
I look uglier since I'm swollen.

123
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:48,710
 Boyfriend 

124
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:56,750
 This phone is turned off. After the beep... 

125
00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:00,700
Is he still really angry?

126
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:07,150
Did he get caught in that accident because he was so shocked by what I said?

127
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:10,400
What are you doing out here instead of coming inside?

128
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,470
I'm just frustrated.

129
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:15,020
Why are you coming outside? You'll catch a cold.

130
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:18,760
I'm feeling frustrated too. I wanted to get some fresh air.

131
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,720
- What's going on? 
 -  Nothing, really.

132
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:28,010
Unni, why do I have to look like this?

133
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:29,660
What's wrong with the way you look?

134
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:35,090
Whenever something bad happens, I get scared and hide away by myself.

135
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:40,960
So things keep getting worse and those around me keep getting hurt.

136
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:45,600
I wish I could have been honest from the start.

137
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,030
I'm bold to a fault sometimes,

138
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:52,180
and you're timid to a fault.

139
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:55,210
You should try to be honest from now on.

140
00:12:57,310 --> 00:13:01,480
Look at Dad! It would have been better off if he was honest about getting scammed from the start.

141
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:05,830
He wanted to resolve it on his own, so he took out cash advances from credit cards and accrued a ton of debt.

142
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:09,710
As a result we lost the apartment, and now we're living in this dump again.

143
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,520
I'm sorry, my daughters.

144
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:18,650
Dad, Dad! He's crying again, he's crying.

145
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:22,580
- How long has he been there? 
 - He should've made some noise.

146
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:28,560
Oh, by the way. Are you friends with my boss' son, Lee Su Ho?

147
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:30,430
Yeah, why?

148
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:32,730
Well, he got involved in a car accident in front of the office building earlier.

149
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:36,760
What? A car accident?

150
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:17,010
 Su Ho! 

151
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:20,470
 Su Ho! 

152
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:13,160
You can leave, you know.

153
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:16,150
I can't relax completely when the two of you are in the hospital room.

154
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:19,460
But still, I can't leave you here alone! It must be uncomfortable to be in a cast.

155
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,780
I'm just going to sleep, anyway.

156
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:23,700
Goodness, you're so stubborn.

157
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:26,860
Then I'll go pack a bag and come back early in the morning.

158
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:29,970
You should be more careful! Do you know how shocked we were?

159
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,570
Hurry and go so I can sleep.

160
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:33,930
- Make sure you call if something happens! 
 - Okay!

161
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:35,840
Go in safely!

162
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:59,490
Is Su Ho okay?

163
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:02,440
Explain everything that Assistant Manager Im said earlier.

164
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:10,430
Uh, the thing is... Last year, to cover up your dating scandal...

165
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:12,010
What?

166
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,400
 Jeez. 

167
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,540
 There was nothing to worry about. 

168
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:28,610
 What kind of relationship would I have with such a young lady? 

169
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:32,340
 We live in the same building, so I drove her home after an afterparty. 

170
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:35,300
 I know, but the press is using the fact that you live in the same building as evidence of your relationship. 

171
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:38,650
 They will be publishing an exclusive article about it on Monday morning. 

172
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,830
 Block it. How would Su Ho feel if he saw it? 

173
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:47,390
 He doesn't even like to talk to me regardless. 

174
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:52,260
 And these kinds of articles won't be good for the company's merger, either. 

175
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:54,960
 Use money or whatever you can to block the article. 

176
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:57,400
 I'll take care of it. Don't worry. 

177
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:01,660
But that's besides the point. How dare you use one of our company's artists as a scapegoat?

178
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:05,140
I really thought for a fact that Se Yeon was a bully at school.

179
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:07,790
Since some people kept posting hate comments accusing him of spending time at a juvenile detention center

180
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:10,950
when he was in middle school and later changing his name and transferring schools,

181
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,010
I confirmed those facts.  However, much later, it turned out the real bullies had started that rumor.

182
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:20,670
And I also found out that Se Yeon was the victim when more news with a correction came out.

183
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,370
Then you should have told me at that time!

184
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:25,040
How could you hide that until now?

185
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:28,060
Se Yeon was already dead by then.

186
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:30,640
Would anything have changed if I told you then?

187
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,460
And regardless of whether it was true or false,

188
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:37,450
the rumor had already spread. It was just a matter of  when  the scandal would explode.

189
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:40,380
So why am I the bad guy for detonating the scandal a little earlier?

190
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:46,550
Shut your damn mouth. That kid killed himself because of what happened.

191
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:48,860
You still don't get that?

192
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:51,090
And now you're plagiarizing?

193
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:53,750
You stole a song from a dead kid?!

194
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,440
Su Ho.

195
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:21,820
Su Ho! How badly are you hurt?

196
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:26,730
I'm sorry! I had no right to be mad.

197
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:31,220
I'm sorry! Open your eyes!

198
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,930
Who are you?

199
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:48,760
I said, who are you?

200
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,660
- Who are you? 
 - Noona!

201
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:00,800
Su Ho!

202
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:06,690
Noona? You had an older sister?

203
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,750
She's my older cousin.

204
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:18,930
- When did you get here, Noona? 
 - Huh? J-Just now.

205
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:25,520
 Hospital Room #505 
 Lee * Ho, Han * Jun 

206
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:30,940
Don't cry. I'm okay.

207
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:33,360
They said my injuries aren't serious.

208
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,800
- Noona. 
 - That's a relief.

209
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:41,490
I kept trying to call you, but you weren't answering.

210
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:44,070
I thought you were hurt really badly.

211
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:47,340
I lost my phone during the accident.

212
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,490
Ah, I see.

213
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:55,730
You seem to be really close with your cousin.

214
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:58,400
She's bawling her eyes out over a simple cast.

215
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,890
- We're really close. 
  - I see.

216
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,160
Y-You should get some rest.

217
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,920
Leaving so soon?

218
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:09,630
Yeah, you came all the way here. You should rest up a bit.

219
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:13,680
- Miss? 
 - No, I'll get going.

220
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:18,590
Noona?

221
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:22,660
Oh my god.

222
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:29,600
What the hell? Han Seo Jun was involved too?

223
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:35,100
What happened? It seems like his leg is broken.

224
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,940
Should I go sneak a peek at his face before I go?

225
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:41,260
Never mind, never mind, I should just go—

226
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:45,490
What is she doing, sitting on an injured person's lap?

227
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:51,380
- Oh, sorry. 
 - Wait! Let's just stay like this for a moment.

228
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:04,000
I wanted to see you so badly that I thought I would die.

229
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,990
You're injured.

230
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:12,960
It's okay.

231
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:18,610
It doesn't hurt anymore now that you're here.

232
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:31,220
I'm okay, really.

233
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:34,220
Where did that guy go?

234
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:44,400
Whatever. I don't care if you get the injection or not.

235
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:48,110
Whether you're hurt or not.

236
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:58,920
I'm sorry I got mad at you then.

237
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,810
I'm sorry too.

238
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:07,470
I won't act like that anymore. Forgive me.

239
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:11,730
I won't act like that either. Forgive me.

240
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:17,190
But what happened? How did the accident happen?

241
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:25,350
Ju Gyeong, what do I do?

242
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:30,790
Se Yeon.

243
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:50,820
I'm going to steal your woman, no matter the cost.

244
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:56,860
Pow pow. Too slow!

245
00:22:56,860 --> 00:23:00,870
I'm not making these sounds with my mouth!

246
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:06,850
Where have you been so late?

247
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,660
What the hell?

248
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:15,600
Oh, you're backing off?

249
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,760
 Get a good night's rest. I'll be back tomorrow. 

250
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:42,180
Oh right, he said he lost his phone.

251
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:54,450
Can you close the window?

252
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:59,230
I said, close the window!

253
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:08,550
Ugh, how did I end up like this.

254
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:22,910
Why did you jump in?  Now you're hurt too.

255
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:25,480
You're not the reason why I jumped in.

256
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:32,770
Your dad thinks that I'm Leo.

257
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:37,450
They said that they were going to make a tribute album, but now what kind of bullshit is that?

258
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:43,140
Does your dad know about all of the musical instruments that you bought?

259
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:47,100
If you had told him earlier, this wouldn't have happened.

260
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,290
Don't you feel indignant at all?

261
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:58,400
 Just to cover up one picture of you and a young actress, 

262
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,370
 you released news about Se Yeon's school violence. 

263
00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:04,250
 Just to cover your embarrassment, you're stealing their songs? 

264
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:20,240
Ju Gyeong.

265
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:24,820
Su Jin, did you sleep well?

266
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:26,600
What's this? I thought you were a robot.

267
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:29,160
Why are you talking so awkwardly?

268
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,700
Did I? It's not like that.

269
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:34,100
Don't be like that. I don't want it to be awkward between us.

270
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,950
Oh? You tied your hair today.

271
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:38,470
I did too. Look!

272
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:41,430
It's pretty!

273
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:43,010
Let's go.

274
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:47,440
Can we perhaps move the study meeting to today?

275
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,790
I have a make-up tutor session tomorrow.

276
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:51,580
But Lee Su Ho...

277
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:53,340
What about him?

278
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:58,010
Lee Su Ho can't come today. He's hospitalized.

279
00:25:58,010 --> 00:25:59,780
What? When?

280
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:02,210
Yesterday, he was with Han Seo Jun and got into an accident.

281
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:05,080
Why are you telling me that just now?

282
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:10,930
That... I also found out about it last night.

283
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:13,890
Did he get hurt a lot? Where was he hurt?

284
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:20,270
Never mind. I'll just ask him.

285
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:23,280
Go in first. I have to drop off an assignment at the staff room.

286
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,860
Okay.

287
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:46,190
I brought underwear.

288
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:50,420
How's your body feeling?

289
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,340
If you feel uncomfortable, I can send someone to tend to you.

290
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:59,220
That's unnecessary.

291
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:01,880
And don't come.

292
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:04,600
Su Ho, what you heard yesterday...

293
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,890
Seo Jun, I came!

294
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:10,370
Oh my. Hello.

295
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:14,510
Ah, yes.

296
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:19,080
Let's talk next time.

297
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,830
Teacher, here you go.

298
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:36,970
Su Jin.

299
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:39,330
Sorry, but could you help me organize the students' notes?

300
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:40,490
Okay. 
 Student Record - Ju Hye Min 

301
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:43,290
Okay, transfer student. Go on up to the classroom.

302
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:46,900
I told the class president, so if you go, he'll tell you which seat you're in.

303
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:49,630
- Yes, sir. 
 - Okay.

304
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,560
Hey, Mr. Han. Wasn't there someone in your class who was also transferred from Yongpa High?

305
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:57,490
Oh, Ju Gyeong? Yeah, she's from Yongpa High.

306
00:27:57,490 --> 00:28:02,100
It's not even a far school, so why transfer from there?

307
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:07,880
I did hear that there are a lot of bad kids over there.

308
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:12,960
Teacher, the kids must have some sort of circumstances.

309
00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:24,390
Not this, but the meat.

310
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:27,430
Just eat how I give it to you. Say 'ah.'

311
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:30,230
That's right. You sure eat well, my baby.

312
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:31,220
What baby?

313
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:34,440
I'm remembering when I used to feed you when you were young.

314
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:38,320
When did our Dribs And Drabs grow up this big?

315
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,850
Oh, Su Ho, do you not remember?

316
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:43,760
Our Seo Jun's childhood nickname was Dribs And Drabs.

317
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,790
- Dribs And Drabs? 
- Until he was fully grown, he couldn't control his pee at night.

318
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:48,970
He kept peeing in dribs and drabs in bed, so we called him that.

319
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:50,460
Why are you talking about that?

320
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:53,050
Was it until you were ten?

321
00:28:53,050 --> 00:28:56,640
No. You wet the bed at night like once or twice in fifth grade, didn't you?

322
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,890
Please stop, Mom.

323
00:28:57,890 --> 00:28:59,250
Seriously...

324
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:01,670
Is there embarrassment to be felt between the two of you?

325
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:04,850
You besties even went to the bathhouse together.

326
00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:08,280
How did you two get into an accident together?

327
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:12,330
You guys aren't sticking to each other, and it seems like you two are fighting.

328
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:16,560
And when you, Su Ho, came to visit me after my surgery,

329
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:19,850
you told me to not tell Seo Jun.

330
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:22,170
I did think it was a bit weird then too.

331
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:24,050
It's nothing.

332
00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:25,420
How are you feeling these days?

333
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:28,110
I'm doing well. That's why I'm able to flutter around like this.

334
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:29,240
Don't you have to go to work?

335
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:32,830
Okay. Eat this first.

336
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:35,590
Hurry. That's right.

337
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:38,900
You don't want to eat anymore? I'm going to take this away then.

338
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:45,810
Did you eat everything? Shall I take up the food tray for you?

339
00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:48,140
I'm okay.

340
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:50,410
Just take care of that Dribs And Drabs.

341
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:52,290
Hey!

342
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:59,160
I still have an arm. Okay?

343
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:10,020
What's with you?

344
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,560
What do you mean?

345
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:13,390
Do you have some kind of problem?

346
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:14,630
No.

347
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:16,720
Never mind if you don't.

348
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,490
Hey, Lee Su Ho.

349
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:21,770
Never mind.

350
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:24,680
Hey, I can't hold it in! The bathroom—

351
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,800
The bathroom?

352
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,840
I need to pee.

353
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:31,260
I thought you were Dribs And Drabs. Why are you telling me that?

354
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:32,670
Then who do I tell?

355
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:34,420
Call the nurse, Dribs And Drabs.

356
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:38,300
How could I ask the nurse to take my pants off?

357
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:41,190
Yes. I would like to move hospital rooms.

358
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:42,380
Is there an empty hospital room?

359
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:44,280
Hey!

360
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,800
Honey, about Han Seo Jun and Lee Su Ho...

361
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:08,500
Instead of a car accident, I heard it was because they got into a fight.

362
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,130
- Really? 
 - Yeah.

363
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:11,770
It's weird that they went to the hospital together.

364
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:14,520
The rumors saying that are going about. Who do you think won?

365
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,040
It's correct that it was a car accident.

366
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,670
It happened in front of my sister's company so she saw it.

367
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:22,460
So it wasn't that they fought in front of your sister's company?

368
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:24,060
It's not like that.

369
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:26,230
But shouldn't we visit Lee Su Ho?

370
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:28,320
Is that so? Then shall we all go tomorrow?

371
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,450
I'm going to be late to my part-time. I'll be going first.

372
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:31,650
Bye, Im Ju!

373
00:31:31,650 --> 00:31:34,000
Work hard, Im Ju Gyeong!

374
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:38,010
Im Ju Gyeong?

375
00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:42,430
Okie, okie, tteokbokki.

376
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:43,930
Hi!

377
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:46,200
I... Hello.

378
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,610
Hi. But who are you?

379
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:51,830
- Hey, why do you think she's talking to you? 
 - She's talking to me!

380
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:55,440
Hey there.  It's a little embarrassing to ask this...

381
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,730
What do you mean?

382
00:31:56,730 --> 00:31:59,630
- Your phone number! 
 - Congratulations!

383
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:02,670
- 010... 
 - Do you know Han Seo Jun?

384
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:04,360
Han Seo Jun?

385
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,520
He didn't come to school today.

386
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,270
No wonder, no matter how much I waited, he wasn't coming out.

387
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:10,830
- But to be honest instead of that gangster-like Han Seo Jun, I'm... 
 - Hey, Ju Hye Min!

388
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:12,940
What's with that bitch?

389
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:14,520
Hey, hey!

390
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,230
What?

391
00:32:20,090 --> 00:32:22,960
Wow, you transferred to Saebom High?

392
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,620
Transferring after telling on us that we were bullying you,

393
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:27,810
you came here?

394
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:28,890
Stupid bitch.

395
00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:32,400
Crazy bitch, because of you, we got suspended.

396
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:35,510
- Ah, seriously! 
 - Stop, stop.

397
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:39,960
Ju Hye Min, you want to be rid of us, don't you?

398
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,650
Answer me, you bitch.

399
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:47,770
Then if you do well what I ask you to do, I'll let you go.

400
00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:50,410
Can you do it?

401
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:56,320
There's a girl named Im Ju Gyeong at your school.

402
00:32:57,540 --> 00:33:00,830
- Ju Gyeong? 
 - There's another bitch who has the same name as that dumpling bitch's.

403
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:05,280
Find out if she's really dating Han Seo Jun.

404
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:08,240
Are you not going to answer me?

405
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:11,080
Y-y-yeah. I understand.

406
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:13,490
Okay, okay. Contact me often.

407
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:17,420
If you ignore my texts, you know what's going to happen to you, right?

408
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:32,170
Lee Su Ho!

409
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:35,530
You came?

410
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,940
Are you here for a blind date?

411
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:42,380
How did you get hurt? You should have looked around properly.

412
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:44,030
You didn't have to come.

413
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:46,640
To the person who came because she was worried...

414
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:51,110
It's an air-purifying plant. You don't have to water it often.

415
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,930
I heard you don't need a caregiver either.

416
00:33:54,930 --> 00:33:59,290
Because Uncle Joo Heon asked me, I brought some stuff you might need.

417
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,850
Facial cleanser and skin toner.

418
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:07,120
I also brought your laptop.

419
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,900
- Thanks. 
 - It's nothing.

420
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,940
Thanks, Seo Jun.

421
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:14,750
I heard you got hurt while saving Su Ho?

422
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:17,690
Why are you thankful? You're not even his girlfriend.

423
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:20,780
If you don't want to receive it, then I take back my thanks.

424
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:22,900
Do you have to wear the cast for a long time?

425
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:25,710
You don't have to undergo leg surgery, do you?

426
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:29,470
I'm okay.

427
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:36,400
But there's only a two person room? Shall I ask my dad to move you?

428
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:39,110
No need. Here.

429
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:40,090
Thanks.

430
00:34:40,090 --> 00:34:41,430
But isn't today the day you go to the academy?

431
00:34:41,430 --> 00:34:45,600
A bit later. Why are you trying to send me off already?

432
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:49,450
But why'd you come by yourself? What about Im Ju Gyeong?

433
00:34:49,450 --> 00:34:50,520
What?

434
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:54,800
Aren't you two besties? You guys are always together, but why are you here alone today?

435
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,030
She said she had to work today.

436
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:59,850
Why? Were you waiting for Ju Gyeong?

437
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:03,980
Why are you asking me that? Ask him.

438
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:11,040
Why him? Wasn't it you who was dating Ju Gyeong?

439
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,370
Everybody knows it as that.

440
00:35:12,370 --> 00:35:14,010
What?

441
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:40,270
Enjoy.

442
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:42,260
Thank you.

443
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:46,420
Shall I take your order?

444
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:51,040
Wow, from strawberries to grapefruit. You must like refreshing things?

445
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:54,180
If you eat refreshing things, you feel better.

446
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,390
It's like you.

447
00:35:58,390 --> 00:36:00,100
Why?

448
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:09,800
You, like a grapefruit, are also refreshing. Grapefruit~

449
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,700
Don't do that. What's with the grapefruit?

450
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:16,360
Why? Shouldn't we have a nickname for each other as a couple?

451
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:18,460
Isn't that right, Grapefruit?

452
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:22,920
I said stop it, Strawberry. See, isn't this weird?

453
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:28,790
Hui Gyeong, why didn't you go to work today?

454
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:33,060
I talked back to the CEO strongly. Then I got a reality check, so I took my monthly leave.

455
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:35,620
Before I get fired, should I write a resignation?

456
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:37,450
Jun Woo?

457
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:42,170
Ju Gyeong. Ju Gyeong.

458
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:45,900
Where are you going? Han Jun Woo...

459
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:57,760
You  don't want Ju Geong to find out that badly?

460
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,300
It's a little disturbing as a teacher.

461
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:04,850
If Ju Gyeong finds out, it'll be hard for her to just treat me as a teacher.

462
00:37:04,850 --> 00:37:08,530
And if the school knows, then if I give her a good score,

463
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:11,360
they'll be sure to gossip that I favored her and gave her good grades.

464
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:16,120
I get it, I get it. We'll keep it a secret.

465
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:18,150
Thank you.

466
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:24,270
By the way, why is she working here?

467
00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:26,990
Why is she making money secretly?

468
00:37:28,490 --> 00:37:30,470
Why isn't she studying like she should?

469
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:35,600
But it seemed like there is something that she wants to study.

470
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:39,780
She wrote makeup department for her career interest survey. Didn't you know?

471
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:41,500
Makeup?

472
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:47,050
What are you doing?

473
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:49,550
Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom. Punch me.

474
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:50,990
Punch? Why?

475
00:37:50,990 --> 00:37:54,560
I've acquired dynamic visual acuity.

476
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:58,880
Right, left, right left! Ow!

477
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:02,740
- Mom!
 - Dynamic visual, my butt! Just go to the hospital.

478
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:05,860
- Hospital? 
- My Ho is hurt and is admitted at the hospital.

479
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:09,000
He doesn't have a mom to bring him these things. You get tired of hospital food after a while.

480
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,400
It's bone broth soup. Make sure you take it to him.

481
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:16,120
How did he get hurt? But I'm busy now.

482
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:18,840
- Ask Dad. 
- Your dad is at the culture center.

483
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:21,130
Hurry and take it to him, okay?

484
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:27,790
 Saebom Culture Center 

485
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:33,450
We're going for a tea. Would you like to join?

486
00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:37,660
Thank you but I have to prepare dinner at home.

487
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:41,330
- You're so nice. 
 - You're so kind.

488
00:38:41,330 --> 00:38:43,800
I know a really good coffee place.

489
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:48,980
If you go there and do your lashes or brow tattoos, coffee is free.

490
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:50,620
- We'll go. 
 - Of course we have to go.

491
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:51,970
See you next class.

492
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:53,870
See you next time Bye.

493
00:38:55,730 --> 00:38:58,340
- I'm sorry. 
 - Seriously!

494
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:10,130
C-Columbus Park!

495
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,320
Hey! Stop there!

496
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,630
Hey, stop there!

497
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:22,870
Hey! Stop!

498
00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:26,650
Where are you going? Hey!

499
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:33,090
Please follow that car in the front.

500
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:41,070
Han Seo Jun's probably with him.

501
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:44,470
Why did I come bare-faced yesterday?

502
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:46,680
Oh, the mirror.

503
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:53,060
Is it good?

504
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:56,000
 Hospital Room #505 
 Lee * Ho, Han * Jun 

505
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,730
- Then you do it yourself. 
 - Do it right!

506
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:08,330
I'll come back.

507
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:14,300
Hi.

508
00:40:14,810 --> 00:40:16,720
You came.

509
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:19,410
You guys look close.

510
00:40:19,410 --> 00:40:22,590
I'm dressing him.

511
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:23,710
Should I wait outside?

512
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:26,330
Hurry and dress me!

513
00:40:26,330 --> 00:40:28,700
I'll be quick.

514
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:42,130
Are you going to the restroom?

515
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:44,360
Do you need help?

516
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:46,290
You help him with that?

517
00:40:46,290 --> 00:40:50,920
Right, it must be hard by yourself...

518
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,670
Don't imagine it.

519
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:54,940
I'm going on a walk.

520
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:08,330
I brought these in case you get bored.

521
00:41:08,330 --> 00:41:11,490
It must've been heavy. You shouldn't have.

522
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,370
It looks fun.

523
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:17,960
 The Garden of Blood 

524
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:20,620
I'll get it.

525
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:27,460
- Wait a sec. I'll untangle it. 
 - Ouch, wait.

526
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:29,560
I'm sorry, it'll be just a sec.

527
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:34,710
- Hey, wait. 
 - Ah, my hair...

528
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:39,090
Hey, hey!

529
00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:43,130
My mom told me to bring this to you.

530
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:45,890
I'll be off so carry on.

531
00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:49,500
- That's not it, Ju Yeong.
 - No, my hair—

532
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:52,010
Just go for a kiss, a kiss!

533
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:54,850
You're dead if you tell Mom!

534
00:41:54,850 --> 00:41:57,950
- What do we do? 
  - Just a sec. I'm sorry.

535
00:41:57,950 --> 00:42:01,000
Move to the right a little.

536
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,670
What does Seo Jun like?

537
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:07,200
Seo Jun likes chicken.

538
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:10,550
What do we do? What do we do?

539
00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:14,730
Come here.

540
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:22,090
- Seo Jun!
 - Seo Jun! He's not here.

541
00:42:22,090 --> 00:42:26,160
He's not here. 
 Su Ho!

542
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,840
Su Ho! Su Ho!

543
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,830
Wait!

544
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:33,170
- Don't touch me. 
 - Why, why, why?

545
00:42:33,170 --> 00:42:36,290
- It hurts.
 - It hurts? It hurts? He's hurt.

546
00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:38,430
He said to not touch!

547
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:41,720
What do we do? How bad is it?

548
00:42:43,990 --> 00:42:45,750
- Is this a dream? 
 - What ever.

549
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:47,860
Wait, wait. Why are you here?

550
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:50,180
- Are you sick somewhere?
 - No.

551
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:52,010
That's a relief. Hey, wait, wait!

552
00:42:52,010 --> 00:42:54,360
Aren't you curious why I'm here?

553
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:56,520
If I'm hurt somewhere or something?

554
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:58,420
I'm not curious.

555
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:03,790
What is it? Are you really hurt?

556
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:06,530
- I'm sick. I have a disease. 
 - A disease?

557
00:43:06,530 --> 00:43:09,030
A horrible incurable disease.

558
00:43:09,030 --> 00:43:10,700
The symptoms? There are several.

559
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:12,700
My head that can only think of Han Go Woon.

560
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:14,640
My eyes that only see Han Go Woon.

561
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,630
My heart that only beats for Han Go Woon.

562
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:21,100
My legs that just run to Han Go Woon.

563
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:22,840
- Goodness. 
 - Oppa!

564
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:25,140
- You're so sick. What do we do?
 - Oppa?

565
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:30,100
What do we do? If it's incurable, I guess you'll die soon... by me.

566
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:37,140
- To Han Go Woon! 
 - Two.
 - I will not hit on!

567
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:40,640
How dare you hit on my sister? She says she's not interested.

568
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:43,490
I'll make her get interested.

569
00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:45,470
- One!
 - Han Go Woon!

570
00:43:45,470 --> 00:43:47,570
Two!

571
00:43:47,570 --> 00:43:49,330
Is the one I like.

572
00:43:49,330 --> 00:43:51,190
You rascal.

573
00:43:51,190 --> 00:43:56,360
I like Han Go Woon. See you again, Hyung.

574
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:58,410
Stop right there!

575
00:43:58,410 --> 00:44:01,030
That weirdo...

576
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:05,730
Here are your boxers. Boxers.

577
00:44:05,730 --> 00:44:09,330
Does Im Ju Gyeong know that her brother likes you?

578
00:44:09,330 --> 00:44:13,130
What? He's Ju Gyeong's brother?

579
00:44:13,130 --> 00:44:17,230
Like this, like this.

580
00:44:20,370 --> 00:44:23,700
This is good. Try it.

581
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:25,090
It is good.

582
00:44:25,090 --> 00:44:30,090
- Han Seo Jun!
 - Seo Jun is alive.

583
00:44:30,090 --> 00:44:31,860
What is this?

584
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:34,790
Hey, Han Seo Jun! Are you okay?

585
00:44:34,790 --> 00:44:36,270
- That hurts!
 - It hurts?

586
00:44:36,270 --> 00:44:39,820
Han Seo Jun! That hospital gown is flashy and sexy.

587
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:42,160
Cast, an injury of glory.

588
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:43,460
- You got swag.
 - Swag.

589
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:45,610
Do you know how worried I was?

590
00:44:45,610 --> 00:44:48,440
I even lost my appetite!

591
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:53,330
Hey! You always eat too much. That's why you lost appetite.

592
00:44:53,330 --> 00:44:57,240
Excuse me! Why don't you quiet down a little bit?

593
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:59,830
Don't you see that 'silence' sign? It's not like you use this room by yourself.

594
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:02,130
I'm thirsty. Is there anything to drink?

595
00:45:02,130 --> 00:45:05,600
Oh, aloe.

596
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:13,510
Sorry. I'll restore it.

597
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:15,810
What is this?

598
00:45:15,810 --> 00:45:19,100
- Hey, hey, hey. Bring it back.
 - Wow, undies!

599
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:22,360
- Look at them, playing with those. 
 - It's fancy!

600
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:25,340
Give it back! Get out!

601
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:29,620
Our Su Ho needs to rest.

602
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:34,790
Look at him cold sweat! What to do!

603
00:45:34,790 --> 00:45:37,130
- My hands are fine. 
 - Yeah?

604
00:45:37,130 --> 00:45:39,600
Then I'll wipe your feet that aren't fine.

605
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:41,500
Wait!

606
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:44,340
Lee Su Ho, your feet!

607
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:54,200
Your feet are so small and cute. That was unexpected. You like pink?

608
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:57,020
How dare you touch my feet?

609
00:45:57,020 --> 00:46:01,930
Hey! I was just trying to wipe your feet.

610
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:06,780
You're so mean.

611
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:13,070
You really.

612
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:15,740
- Hey, I thought we're ordering chicken.
 - Is there a TV here?

613
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:17,970
Guys, guys!

614
00:46:17,970 --> 00:46:21,100
 - We should order what Seo Jun likes. 
 - Assorted chickens and pizza! 

615
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:24,930
Seasoning, soy sauce, galbi sauce, garlic.

616
00:46:24,930 --> 00:46:27,310
You guys all should go now.

617
00:46:27,310 --> 00:46:29,930
Why? I'm sleeping over today.

618
00:46:29,930 --> 00:46:32,930
We're taking care of you all night. We're BFF!

619
00:46:32,930 --> 00:46:34,770
-  Loyalty!
 - Loyalty.

620
00:46:34,770 --> 00:46:36,930
Where would you sleep with that body? Leave now.

621
00:46:36,930 --> 00:46:39,870
- That's right. You should leave. You're so noisy.
 - You should go, too. Please.

622
00:46:39,870 --> 00:46:42,810
Su Ho! At this rate, I'm going to be hurt!

623
00:46:42,810 --> 00:46:45,920
I should get going now. Let's go.

624
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:47,940
- Why?
 - Let's go.

625
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:49,890
Right, you should go. Let's go.

626
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:53,410
Hey, why are you dying to send us away?

627
00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:57,620
Seriously! It's because I want to be left alone with Lee Su Ho!

628
00:46:57,620 --> 00:46:59,070
Just the two of you?

629
00:46:59,070 --> 00:47:01,220
Okay, I ship this bromance.

630
00:47:01,220 --> 00:47:03,680
- Me too.
 - That's weird.

631
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:05,980
Did you guys make up?

632
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:10,130
Right, right, I heard Yeo Ha Jin is shooting a drama at the lobby.

633
00:47:10,130 --> 00:47:14,750
- What? 
 - The nation's first love, the famous Yeo Ha Jin?

634
00:47:16,010 --> 00:47:18,650
Sorry, Su Ho!

635
00:47:18,650 --> 00:47:21,730
Go! Go!

636
00:47:21,730 --> 00:47:24,720
Let's go, go!

637
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:27,830
Sorry, Seo Jun. Let's go.

638
00:47:43,550 --> 00:47:46,320
Gosh, that stings...

639
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:57,320
- Goodness!
 - Why are you out?

640
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:59,980
After I finally sent all the kids out.

641
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:01,260
It's getting late.

642
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:03,960
Why are you suffering so much trying to hide it?

643
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:06,060
Just say you're dating.  That would be enough.

644
00:48:06,060 --> 00:48:08,330
I can't say it yet.

645
00:48:08,330 --> 00:48:10,320
Why? Because of Kang Su Jin?

646
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:15,760
Hey! I said that was an example. You're so funny.

647
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:19,260
- Hey, why do you walk around with something on you?
 - Ow!

648
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:21,300
Sorry.

649
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:23,810
I'll have to cut this out.

650
00:48:23,810 --> 00:48:27,410
What did you do on the bed that'll make buttons fall?

651
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:32,530
- You must be lonely to be imagining those kinds of things.
  - The kids were teasing!

652
00:48:32,530 --> 00:48:36,470
Then I should write something too. Give me that.

653
00:48:36,470 --> 00:48:39,930
Hey, don't write anything weird.

654
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:45,160
There you go.

655
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:46,660
I'm off.

656
00:48:46,660 --> 00:48:48,420
 Power of tiger, gush out! Roar! 

657
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:51,710
 Power of tiger, gush out! Roar! 

658
00:48:51,710 --> 00:48:54,380
Right, Han Seo Jun!

659
00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:56,660
Roar!

660
00:48:59,330 --> 00:49:02,670
She's using it over and over again, like bones in bone soup...

661
00:49:04,390 --> 00:49:06,390
   

662
00:49:06,390 --> 00:49:09,870
You should've gotten retouched a long time ago. Why did you come only now?

663
00:49:09,870 --> 00:49:11,860
But still, it'll last longer like this.

664
00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:14,670
- Thank you. 
- Let's see.

665
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:17,880
 From: Im Hui Gyeong 
 Are you finished? 

666
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:21,000
- It looks good, it looks good. 
 - Madam Hong, Madam Hong~

667
00:49:21,070 --> 00:49:24,140
- Are you going out to buy something? 
 - No, I just came to check out my goods.

668
00:49:24,140 --> 00:49:26,620
Your goods? What goods?

669
00:49:26,620 --> 00:49:30,290
I! I will get going now.

670
00:49:30,290 --> 00:49:32,520
Hyeon Suk, are you still open?

671
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:34,210
- Hello! 
 - My Goodness!

672
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:39,370
You had such a young, tall, and handsome customer here.

673
00:49:39,370 --> 00:49:41,800
Yes, well, I'll be going now—

674
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:43,990
He's Ju Gyeong's homeroom teacher.

675
00:49:43,990 --> 00:49:45,090
Hello.

676
00:49:45,090 --> 00:49:49,940
Goodness, you have such an upright presence, I figured that you're a teacher.

677
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:51,770
Are you married?

678
00:49:51,770 --> 00:49:53,990
No, not yet.

679
00:49:53,990 --> 00:49:57,360
This is like destiny. My daughter is single, too.

680
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:59,790
I think you'd be a fantastic match with my daughter.

681
00:49:59,790 --> 00:50:02,070
Would you like to meet her?

682
00:50:02,070 --> 00:50:05,310
Thanks for the concern, but no thank you.

683
00:50:05,310 --> 00:50:07,380
Now, I'll be going—

684
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:13,730
Why not? If things go well, you'll be able to eat my braised pig trotters for free for the rest of your life!

685
00:50:13,730 --> 00:50:16,190
Who on earth would get married just because of some pig trotters?

686
00:50:16,190 --> 00:50:18,310
They need to love each other to get married.

687
00:50:18,310 --> 00:50:19,490
Go on, Mr. Han!

688
00:50:19,490 --> 00:50:21,810
Goodbye.

689
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:24,860
Instead, you should try to find someone for my Hui Gyeong.

690
00:50:24,860 --> 00:50:27,050
Don't you know of any good guys?

691
00:50:27,050 --> 00:50:28,410
Should I?

692
00:50:28,410 --> 00:50:30,580
Hui Gyeong, what kind of men do you like?

693
00:50:30,580 --> 00:50:33,010
Just tell me.

694
00:50:33,010 --> 00:50:35,460
Uh, my taste?

695
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:38,880
I like a typical guy born early in the year 1990.

696
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:43,150
And a guy who looks cute when he covers up his sparse eyebrows with his bangs, but looks sexy with his hair pushed back.

697
00:50:43,150 --> 00:50:47,880
He seems very modest and gentle, but when he tries to act cute, he looks like a little kitten.

698
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:51,730
I like a man who makes me fret over him a lot.

699
00:50:53,580 --> 00:50:56,040
Just tell me that you don't want to be set up! That kind of man doesn't exist!

700
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:57,670
- Yes he does, yes he does! 
 - She's crazy!

701
00:50:57,670 --> 00:51:00,230
Madam Hong, I'm going to go to the convenience store. Goodbye!

702
00:51:00,230 --> 00:51:03,500
Look at that brat. Come home early!

703
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:08,100
Jun Woo! Where are you going?

704
00:51:09,510 --> 00:51:12,670
Why do you keep running away from me? Making me fret.

705
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:16,650
This is your neighborhood, Hui Gyeong. What if Ju Gyeong—

706
00:51:16,650 --> 00:51:18,810
There's no way that she'll pass by this alleyway.

707
00:51:18,810 --> 00:51:20,590
Is that so?

708
00:51:22,730 --> 00:51:24,510
- Do you like braised pig trotters? 
 - Pardon?

709
00:51:24,510 --> 00:51:27,770
- Who said you're allowed to smile at all of these people? 
 - What have I done?

710
00:51:27,770 --> 00:51:32,160
Since you have such a pretty smile, people everywhere  want to marry you off.

711
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:34,680
It's just that you perceive me that way, Hui Gyeong.

712
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:36,490
Your eyebrows look pretty.

713
00:51:36,490 --> 00:51:39,340
You're prettier, Hui Gyeong.

714
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:41,260
Duck your head a bit.

715
00:51:47,410 --> 00:51:49,430
Big sister?

716
00:51:49,430 --> 00:51:51,290
Oh shit, my eyes!

717
00:51:51,290 --> 00:51:53,450
Who are you kissing? Your boyfriend?!

718
00:51:53,450 --> 00:51:54,550
No, just leave!

719
00:51:54,550 --> 00:51:57,240
Let go! Who are you, Mister?

720
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:59,260
- Let go of me. 
 - I said, leave!

721
00:51:59,260 --> 00:52:01,000
Let go!

722
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,320
Ugh, seriously.

723
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:04,290
What? Do I know that person?

724
00:52:04,290 --> 00:52:05,530
I told you, no!

725
00:52:05,530 --> 00:52:08,170
Gosh, what's up with all these women today?

726
00:52:08,170 --> 00:52:11,260
Why do I keep catching everyone with their significant others!

727
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:14,100
Where have you been tonight?!

728
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:16,620
 Watch your head 

729
00:52:23,370 --> 00:52:26,060
   
   
 Hong * Suk's card was charged by Yongpa Taxi for ₩154,000 

730
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:28,240
One hundred...

731
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:31,000
   
   
 Hong * Suk's card was charged by Yongpa Taxi for ₩154,000 

732
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,020
Honey, honey, honey! I found him!

733
00:52:33,020 --> 00:52:35,060
- Who did you find? 
 - Columbus Park!

734
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:37,960
I made eye contact with him while I was leaving the culture center!

735
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:40,100
- I wanted to catch that bastard, so I— 
 - You rode a taxi?

736
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:41,360
Exactly!

737
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:47,210
So I was following him in a taxi, and you know how they show car chase scenes in movies? Like vroom vroom!

738
00:52:47,210 --> 00:52:49,820
I was like, "Don't move, Columbus Park! Sir, could you drive a little faster?"

739
00:52:49,820 --> 00:52:51,330
So did you catch him?

740
00:52:51,330 --> 00:52:53,170
No, I lost him!

741
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:57,190
However, Honey. I confirmed that he's hiding somewhere in Seoul!

742
00:52:57,190 --> 00:53:00,460
Who cares about your confirmation or whatever! You spent ₩150,000 on a taxi ride!

743
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:01,630
- Honey, wait— 
 - Why, I ought to—!

744
00:53:01,630 --> 00:53:04,270
H-Hear me out!

745
00:53:04,270 --> 00:53:06,450
I said, I know for a fact that he's in Seoul now!

746
00:53:06,450 --> 00:53:09,690
Who cares!! You spent ₩150,000 on a damn taxi ride!

747
00:53:13,290 --> 00:53:17,490
- Tell me the truth. Are you studying makeup? 
 - How did you know?

748
00:53:17,490 --> 00:53:21,800
What do you think?  You aren't just dreaming about something else because you hate studying, are you?

749
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:25,040
No, I'm serious about this.

750
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:27,010
I really want to do this.

751
00:53:27,010 --> 00:53:29,890
But I haven't given it a proper effort yet. I haven't even registered for cosmetology school either.

752
00:53:29,890 --> 00:53:32,150
Then are you taking up part-time jobs so you can earn your tuition?

753
00:53:32,150 --> 00:53:34,560
How did you know that, too?!

754
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:39,700
It's obvious from the way you come home so late.

755
00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:43,900
Wow. You're like a ghost... You're really good at reading people.

756
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:46,460
But don't tell Mom about it yet.

757
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:50,770
I'm going to do well on my exams, raise my class rank, and then I can confidently ask for her approval.

758
00:53:50,770 --> 00:53:52,690
I'll get going now.

759
00:53:55,090 --> 00:53:58,540
Ju Gyeong. If you're having a hard time at work, do you want me to pay your tuition bill?

760
00:53:58,540 --> 00:54:01,490
No, I want to try my hardest to do it on my own.

761
00:54:01,490 --> 00:54:03,180
Aw, you're all grown up, Ju Gyeong.

762
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:05,060
- Bye, now! 
 - Okay.

763
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:10,020
Ju Gyeong, let me know if you have a hard time, okay?

764
00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:12,990
Thanks, Unni. I love you!

765
00:54:18,570 --> 00:54:22,330
What the hell? Jun Woo's girlfriend is—!

766
00:54:22,330 --> 00:54:25,000
Ju Gyeong's older sister?!

767
00:54:36,790 --> 00:54:38,750
Good morning, Teacher!

768
00:54:38,750 --> 00:54:41,620
Eat this, Ju Gyeong.

769
00:54:41,620 --> 00:54:44,690
I love strawberry flavored things! Thank you.

770
00:54:44,690 --> 00:54:48,120
- Have a good day today, Ju Gyeong! 
 - Thanks for the candy.

771
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:56,870
Hello, Miss.

772
00:54:56,870 --> 00:54:59,330
You're being too obvious.

773
00:54:59,330 --> 00:55:01,130
What about?

774
00:55:01,130 --> 00:55:06,310
It's obvious that you're giving her special treatment because she's your girlfriend's little sister.

775
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:09,300
Well...

776
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:12,280
I'm not quite sure what you're talking about...

777
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:15,740
I don't know...

778
00:55:15,740 --> 00:55:18,820
I'm usually a very discreet person.

779
00:55:22,130 --> 00:55:26,730
If you plot A and B on their respective coordinate planes,

780
00:55:26,730 --> 00:55:31,730
the curve which represents the proximal upper boundary

781
00:55:31,730 --> 00:55:36,920
Y=f(x).

782
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:39,030
 He's probably doing okay, right? 

783
00:55:39,030 --> 00:55:40,520
Y...

784
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:42,030
 I wonder what he's doing. 

785
00:55:42,030 --> 00:55:44,470
Equals f(x)...

786
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:50,900
When you interpret this graph,

787
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:54,640
the amount of space between these two curves will

788
00:55:55,450 --> 00:55:58,590
be the same for each of them.

789
00:56:02,260 --> 00:56:04,120
Give me some.

790
00:56:06,020 --> 00:56:08,130
Give me some meat. Meat.

791
00:56:08,130 --> 00:56:10,510
Yours looks really good, man.

792
00:56:14,540 --> 00:56:17,160
Ugh, try not to spill, Dribs And Drabs.

793
00:56:24,740 --> 00:56:26,490
Geez...

794
00:56:27,350 --> 00:56:29,000
Hey, hey, hey...

795
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,770
I got it, I got it.

796
00:56:30,770 --> 00:56:33,330
- Back up a bit! 
 - Okay.

797
00:56:33,330 --> 00:56:35,120
Turn right.

798
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:37,290
Ugh, come on.

799
00:56:38,060 --> 00:56:39,030
Here!

800
00:56:39,030 --> 00:56:41,350
You carry this around with you?

801
00:56:41,350 --> 00:56:42,320
You're incredible.

802
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:48,700
I need to give my greatest effort when I take a selfie to share with my loyal followers.

803
00:56:49,350 --> 00:56:50,630
Oh, it looks good!

804
00:56:50,630 --> 00:56:52,060
It looks bright and clean!

805
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:53,950
I can see the difference!

806
00:56:54,990 --> 00:56:57,820
- Oh, what a nice picture. 
 - It came out nice.

807
00:56:57,820 --> 00:57:01,300
There is a contest to select a goddess on Instagram, so I should post this picture.

808
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:03,260
- Do you want to post one too? 
 - No, I'm okay.

809
00:57:03,260 --> 00:57:04,760
Ju Gyeong, you should take a picture too!

810
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:06,660
Yeah, I think it'll come out nicely, might as well take it while we're here.

811
00:57:06,660 --> 00:57:09,620
I'll put my entire soul into taking this picture.

812
00:57:09,620 --> 00:57:11,200
Alright...

813
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:14,530
Here, Ju Gyeong. One, two, three!

814
00:57:14,530 --> 00:57:16,720
Hold up the reflector.

815
00:57:19,730 --> 00:57:21,360
It's so pretty!

816
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:23,740
I get goddess vibes, you know?

817
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:31,320
What are you doing? Why are you taking pictures of Ju Gyeong?

818
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:37,670
I-It's nothing! I took those on accident.

819
00:57:37,670 --> 00:57:40,150
Here, catch the sunlight.

820
00:57:42,230 --> 00:57:45,100
So pretty~

821
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:48,260
Look that way, too.

822
00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:52,330
Please press down firmly.

823
00:57:54,090 --> 00:57:56,630
I'll be right back with a fresh change.

824
00:58:00,290 --> 00:58:02,090
Su Ho.

825
00:58:05,660 --> 00:58:07,850
I told you not to come here.

826
00:58:07,850 --> 00:58:11,140
Let's talk, hm?

827
00:58:14,100 --> 00:58:17,900
- Wow, I feel like I can breathe now. Hey. 
 - Huh?

828
00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:21,500
You're back again? Wow, you clock in as regular as work.

829
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:24,560
I can't contact him by phone, so I can't help but come here when I'm worried.

830
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:27,200
Wow, I'm going to tear up.

831
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:28,970
Oh! You took off one of the casts.

832
00:58:28,970 --> 00:58:31,960
Yeah, they took another X-ray and said that it was okay to remove one of them.

833
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:35,490
What a relief. I hope Su Ho heals quickly, too.

834
00:58:35,490 --> 00:58:41,500
- Hey. Did you know that Lee Su Ho has an older cousin? 
 - Huh?

835
00:58:42,670 --> 00:58:46,960
Oh, yeah, I know! Of course.

836
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:01,830
Why did you do that? Se Yeon was my friend.

837
00:59:01,830 --> 00:59:04,560
Why the hell did you do that?!

838
00:59:07,930 --> 00:59:11,040
I didn't know about what happened to Se Yeon either.

839
00:59:11,860 --> 00:59:14,930
I trusted Director Oh to take care of things,

840
00:59:14,930 --> 00:59:17,800
but I didn't know that he would do it in such a way.

841
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:19,730
Do you think I would act that way if I knew?

842
00:59:19,730 --> 00:59:21,540
Like you said, Se Yeon was your friend.

843
00:59:21,540 --> 00:59:24,640
Surely you don't think I could have done that as your father?

844
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:28,130
So you're saying that it's all Director Oh's fault?

845
00:59:28,130 --> 00:59:32,200
I heard that he did all of that to cover up your own scandal article.

846
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:37,800
But are you free of the blame just because you were clueless?

847
00:59:38,790 --> 00:59:42,390
Do you really think that you have nothing to feel guilty about?

848
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:50,590
I... I didn't pick up the phone when Se Yeon called me for the last time.

849
00:59:51,530 --> 00:59:55,380
And so I thought that caused Se Yeon to make such a decision.

850
00:59:56,760 --> 01:00:00,820
Do you have any idea how tormented and heartbroken I felt?

851
01:00:00,820 --> 01:00:06,760
But! You were the cause of everything.

852
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:09,210
Were you really so afraid of a stupid scandal?

853
01:00:09,210 --> 01:00:12,140
What the hell is that?!

854
01:00:12,140 --> 01:00:18,330
That... I reacted that way because I was afraid you would be disappointed with me.

855
01:00:18,330 --> 01:00:20,180
We already have a bad relationship.

856
01:00:20,180 --> 01:00:24,230
I thought that you would become more remote if that article were published.

857
01:00:24,230 --> 01:00:26,860
That's why I wanted to cover it up.

858
01:00:28,090 --> 01:00:32,040
I had zero expectations of you in the first place, so what could I possibly be disappointed by?

859
01:00:32,820 --> 01:00:34,880
Already in the past ...

860
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:38,720
I had seen everything.

861
01:00:40,260 --> 01:00:44,000
I know what you did on the day that Mom passed away.

862
01:00:55,900 --> 01:00:57,670
What?

863
01:00:59,460 --> 01:01:03,590
You saw that? Su Ho, back then I—

864
01:01:03,590 --> 01:01:05,530
Just leave.

865
01:01:05,530 --> 01:01:08,090
Su Ho. Su Ho!

866
01:01:08,090 --> 01:01:10,130
I said, get out!!

867
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:14,290
Su Ho, Su Ho!

868
01:01:14,290 --> 01:01:16,060
- Su Ho! 
 - Su Ho!

869
01:01:16,060 --> 01:01:17,630
- Su Ho! 
 - Su Ho! Snap out of it!

870
01:01:17,630 --> 01:01:19,600
Su Ho! What's happening?

871
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:21,350
Over here! Su Ho!

872
01:01:21,350 --> 01:01:22,830
Su Ho! What's the matter?!

873
01:01:22,830 --> 01:01:23,900
- Patient, are you okay? 
 - Wake up!

874
01:01:23,900 --> 01:01:25,600
Are you alright?

875
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:27,990
Su Ho! Wake up!

876
01:01:27,990 --> 01:01:29,970
It appears that he suffered a panic attack.

877
01:01:29,970 --> 01:01:34,160
Given the fact there there were no pre-existing issues on the electrocardiogram, it seems to be psychogenic.

878
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:40,930
I recommend that he is referred to a psychologist if this is a common occurrence for him.

879
01:02:01,890 --> 01:02:04,440
I knew he was a frustrating guy,

880
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:08,060
but I didn't know he was suppressing it to the point of getting sick!

881
01:02:09,510 --> 01:02:12,300
I think he won't tell you himself.

882
01:02:13,810 --> 01:02:17,820
Leo is Lee Su Ho.

883
01:02:20,660 --> 01:02:22,220
What?

884
01:02:22,220 --> 01:02:24,900
Can't you tell just by going to his house?

885
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:27,270
Are you guys really father and son?

886
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:30,760
When he was composing music with Se Yeon,

887
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:33,890
do you know how happy he was?

888
01:02:48,690 --> 01:02:54,270
♫  I just don't have the courage  ♫

889
01:02:55,470 --> 01:03:01,100
♫  I'm afraid it will be too much for you  ♫

890
01:03:02,510 --> 01:03:09,670
♫  I'm always anxious  ♫

891
01:03:09,670 --> 01:03:16,150
♫  I am loving you  ♫

892
01:03:16,150 --> 01:03:23,170
♫  Fall in you, I just found out  ♫

893
01:03:23,170 --> 01:03:30,220
♫  Fall in you, I am waiting for you  ♫

894
01:03:30,220 --> 01:03:38,000
♫   Fall in you, you are my destiny   ♫

895
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:43,050
♫  The one person who will be my star  ♫

896
01:03:43,050 --> 01:03:48,640
♫  Am I too late  ♫

897
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:55,670
♫  I'm afraid of hurting you  ♫

898
01:03:55,670 --> 01:04:02,580
♫  I must be scared  ♫

899
01:04:02,580 --> 01:04:08,320
♫  That you are my love  ♫

900
01:04:09,130 --> 01:04:12,740
♫  Fall in you  ♫

901
01:04:12,740 --> 01:04:14,750
  You know... 

902
01:04:14,750 --> 01:04:17,350
  I like Lee Su Ho.  

903
01:04:17,350 --> 01:04:20,350
  It kind of hurts. 

904
01:04:20,350 --> 01:04:23,220
♫  I am waiting for you  ♫

905
01:04:23,220 --> 01:04:31,030
♫   Fall in you, you are my destiny   ♫

906
01:04:31,030 --> 01:04:36,880
♫  The one person who will be my star  ♫

907
01:05:12,630 --> 01:05:16,240
  Leo is Lee Su Ho. 

908
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:19,620
 When he was composing music with Se Yeon, 

909
01:05:19,620 --> 01:05:22,770
 do you know how happy he was? 

910
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:45,520
 I know what you did on the day that Mom passed away. 

911
01:05:56,560 --> 01:06:00,190
  I didn't pick up the phone when Se Yeon called me for the last time.  

912
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:03,700
  And so I thought that caused Se Yeon to make such a decision. 

913
01:06:03,700 --> 01:06:07,400
 Do you have any idea how tormented and heartbroken I felt? 

914
01:06:17,580 --> 01:06:20,360
  So how much longer are you going to take out your anger on me? 

915
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:25,800
  Until you die and meet Se Yeon! 

916
01:06:28,040 --> 01:06:30,490
  Don't forget.  

917
01:06:30,490 --> 01:06:35,960
  You killed Se Yeon, and you don't have the right to smile. 

918
01:06:47,820 --> 01:06:50,530
He's sleeping as if he's dead.

919
01:06:57,830 --> 01:07:00,370
Is he even breathing?

920
01:07:12,110 --> 01:07:15,310
I saw everything. Why are you pretending to be asleep?

921
01:07:20,270 --> 01:07:21,400
What?

922
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:25,490
I want to get some fresh air, but my wheelchair is gone.

923
01:07:25,490 --> 01:07:28,560
Just sleep. It's the middle of the night.

924
01:07:30,950 --> 01:07:32,900
Seriously...

925
01:07:34,570 --> 01:07:36,870
Hold on tight! You're so heavy.

926
01:07:40,780 --> 01:07:43,710
You even have the smallest face. Why are you so heavy?

927
01:07:43,710 --> 01:07:45,960
You're so talkative.

928
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:50,130
Hey, Lee Su Ho. Just wait until your legs are fully healed.

929
01:07:52,050 --> 01:07:54,120
Can you use your strength, Dribs And Drabs?

930
01:07:54,120 --> 01:07:56,730
I am using my strength!

931
01:07:58,010 --> 01:07:59,420
What are you doing?

932
01:07:59,420 --> 01:08:01,190
There's no wheelchair.

933
01:08:01,190 --> 01:08:05,460
If you just called us, we would've delivered you one. Just wait a moment.

934
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:08,920
You should've called them!

935
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:11,230
Then you, with your two fine legs, should've brought the wheelchair!

936
01:08:11,230 --> 01:08:13,480
- I didn't think about that! 
- I didn't either!

937
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:15,750
You are ranked first in the class. Do you not use your brain?

938
01:08:15,750 --> 01:08:17,820
What is your ranking?

939
01:08:32,990 --> 01:08:38,030
Why didn't you tell me back then?

940
01:08:38,750 --> 01:08:41,470
That you weren't able to meet Se Yeon that day.

941
01:08:44,410 --> 01:08:50,360
I thought this whole time that everything happened because you didn't believe in Se Yeon!

942
01:08:51,930 --> 01:08:53,860
You should've told me.

943
01:08:53,860 --> 01:08:59,750
Even if I tell you, that doesn't mean Se Yeon will come back alive.

944
01:09:03,450 --> 01:09:06,760
I thought it was true that he died because of me.

945
01:09:10,220 --> 01:09:13,040
If only I had just answered his call...

946
01:09:15,710 --> 01:09:18,480
I might have been able to stop it.

947
01:09:21,930 --> 01:09:27,550
You... Have you been thinking that way the whole time?

948
01:09:30,930 --> 01:09:33,390
You frustrating bastard.

949
01:09:44,120 --> 01:09:47,410
Son! Come out and eat some fruit!

950
01:09:47,410 --> 01:09:48,730
  You won't die. 

951
01:09:48,730 --> 01:09:50,720
Where is Ju Gyeong when it's the weekend?

952
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:52,450
Didn't she go out somewhere really early in the morning?

953
01:09:52,450 --> 01:09:54,330
- Part-time. 
 - What?

954
01:09:54,330 --> 01:09:56,440
  Stop! Who are you? 

955
01:09:56,440 --> 01:09:58,730
I mean, it's not my part-time job to check on her.

956
01:09:58,730 --> 01:10:01,010
Can you give your sister some attention?

957
01:10:01,010 --> 01:10:03,670
 Move Entertainment's CEO, Lee Ju Heon, 

958
01:10:03,670 --> 01:10:07,190
 declared that the new group Black Soul's title song was plagiarized, 

959
01:10:07,190 --> 01:10:10,270
 and announced that he would step down from his CEO position as well as retire from the entertainment industry. 

960
01:10:10,270 --> 01:10:11,460
Retiring?

961
01:10:11,460 --> 01:10:13,720
 Move Entertainment's big newbie, Black Soul's title song, 

962
01:10:13,720 --> 01:10:16,130
Yes, Team Leader! 
  - was in fact made by the late Se Yeon... 

963
01:10:16,130 --> 01:10:17,670
Did you see the news?

964
01:10:17,670 --> 01:10:18,930
Lee Ju Heon is retiring!

965
01:10:18,930 --> 01:10:20,610
Ju-sama!

966
01:10:20,610 --> 01:10:23,020
Why? Why? Oh my god, oh my god.

967
01:10:23,020 --> 01:10:25,520
No!

968
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:27,800
   

969
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:29,700

  [Using Rumors About School Violence} 

970
01:10:29,740 --> 01:10:34,060
You can assume that the two points between the graphs are each A and B.

971
01:10:34,060 --> 01:10:37,070
Then the function value of A is f(A)

972
01:10:37,070 --> 01:10:39,270
and the function value of B is f(B).

973
01:10:39,270 --> 01:10:41,680
So in a very short amount of time...

974
01:10:41,680 --> 01:10:44,560
  Kang Su, something big happened! Did you watch the news? 

975
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:45,500
Between A and B in the graph...

976
01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:49,510
  Lee Ju Heon is retiring from the entertainment industry! Apologized for Jeong Se Yeon's death. 

977
01:10:49,510 --> 01:10:54,330
Point B becomes smaller like this...

978
01:10:55,930 --> 01:10:57,880
Su Jin!

979
01:11:06,790 --> 01:11:09,660
 Lee Ju Heon makes  declaration of conscience related to Jeong Se Yeon's death. 

980
01:11:23,470 --> 01:11:25,490
Lee Su Ho!

981
01:11:26,650 --> 01:11:33,650


982
01:11:34,990 --> 01:11:37,570
It's Im Ju Gyeong again.

983
01:11:37,570 --> 01:11:39,330
Yeah.

984
01:11:46,210 --> 01:11:48,960
It's me again.

985
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:51,210
I missed you.

986
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:56,340
And you came.

987
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:01,180
I came to give you a hug.

 True Beauty

01:13:59,430 --> 01:14:04,250
  I poured out everything I was suppressing for so long, but I still feel heavy. 

1007
01:14:04,250 --> 01:14:06,690
  If you can't sleep next time, talk to them. 

1008
01:14:06,690 --> 01:14:10,180
  All of your sad thoughts, worries, everything. 

1009
01:14:10,180 --> 01:14:13,400
  It's Ju Gyeong. My girlfriend. 

1010
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:17,640
  Goddess, how does it feel to shake up the world of SNS? 

1011
01:14:17,640 --> 01:14:21,130
  Im Ju Gyeong! She transferred from Yongpa High School. 

1012
01:14:21,130 --> 01:14:24,600
  In my last school, there was a girl named Im Ju Gyeong.
