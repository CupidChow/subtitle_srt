 True Beauty 

4
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,830
It was here.

5
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,880
It was here.

6
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,030
Se Yeon...

7
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,620
- I know. 
 - Se Yeon.

8
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:07,710
I know.

9
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:10,550
I know everything.

 Episode 6 

11
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:52,060
Here.

12
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:00,280
Are you okay?

13
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:05,370
Why would you ask?  I should be the one asking.

14
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,640
I'm okay.

15
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:16,700
 You're not okay. You're having a hard time breathing. 

16
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,100
You must have remembered everything.

17
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:24,500
Why did you pretend not to know? You should have told me about it sooner.

18
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:29,690
Yeah.  Why did I do that?

19
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:34,010
The day I was here

20
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:38,310
I didn't intend to die.

21
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:44,160
So you didn't have to feel sorry for me.

22
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,830
- I wasn't doing that. 
 - Fire!  Fire!

23
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:50,400
- Fire! 
 - Big fire!

24
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,770
- Is there a big fire? 
 - There'a a fire! A fire!

25
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:02,300
What should we do? I don't want to die here.

26
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:05,710
What should we do? There's a fire.

27
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:13,140
How should we leave?

28
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:17,240
Someone was smoking some dried pollack in their home.

29
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,710
During the smoke that arose from the cooking,

30
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:21,570
the fire alarm rang.

31
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:23,480
Why would you cook pollack at home?

32
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:26,440
Yeah, it should be cooked on a grill. That's how it's good.

33
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,920
Get out of the way!

34
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,590
Hey stop that!

35
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:31,240
Let me go first!

36
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,740
Get out of the way, goodness.

37
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,590
What is this in the middle of the night?

38
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:40,030
Don't push.

39
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,410
 Don't misunderstand. 

40
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:44,310
 I just treated you well out of pity. 

41
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:50,050
 Then why did he come all the way here? 

42
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:04,380
  Lost in Love 

43
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:11,020
 Does Im Ju Gyeong know? 

44
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:13,300
 That you killed a friend? 

45
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:18,360
 Don't forget. 

46
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:21,480
 You killed Se Yeon, 

47
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:24,830
 and you don't deserve to smile. 

48
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,130
Someone said this once,

49
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:42,010
that tears can clean our hearts.

50
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,900
I just want to say

51
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,270
that it's okay to cry once in a while.

52
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:54,760
You don't need to pretend to be okay.

53
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:00,170
I'm going.

54
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:29,600
 But now I'm tired of it and annoyed. 

55
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,840
 I don't want to care about you anymore, so get out. 

56
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,250
 I didn't know but you're really nosy, too. 

57
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:39,320
 Did I ask you to care for me? Did I? 

58
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:43,900
 I won't bother you anymore, so you also shouldn't pity me. 

59
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:07,270
Did you just get back?

60
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:15,110
- Why are you here without notice? 
 - Did you eat?

61
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:16,630
I ate so you can leave now.

62
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:19,790
You're chasing me out even though it's been a while since I saw you?

63
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:23,040
Your homeroom teacher called me this morning about the parent teacher conference.

64
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,790
Wow amazing! It's Lee Ju Heon.

65
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:27,750
Amazing!

66
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,460
Pictures aren't allowed.

67
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:31,690
Sorry.

68
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:36,670
Please ignore the parent teacher conference.

69
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:39,890
- I'll let them know you'll probably be busy. 
 - I cleared my schedule.

70
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:44,110
By the way, what do I need to prepare for this meeting?

71
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:45,900
It's my first time, so I'm a bit anxious.

72
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,780
I told you I didn't want to be known as your son at school.

73
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:51,570
All the teachers know you're Lee Ju Heon's son.

74
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:53,980
What will they think of me if I don't visit the school once?

75
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:56,060
Just do what you usually do.

76
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:59,310
I need to rest, so please leave.

77
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,480
I'm home.

78
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,590
You're back?

79
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,750
- Is Mom sleeping? 
 - Yup.

80
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,180
- This looks delicious. 
 - Oppa, go make your own!

81
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:35,940
Just one bite. Give it here.

82
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:40,370
Is that just one bite?

83
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:42,340
Yeah, it's so good. Let me have one more.

84
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:45,020
Oppa, go make your own.

85
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:47,160
So stingy.

86
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:50,840
Are you sure you're my sister?

87
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:53,670
I can't get used to you with makeup.

88
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:57,330
Ju Gyeong put it on for me, so I can't find it in me to wash it off.

89
00:08:57,330 --> 00:09:01,350
By the way, you said Im Ju Gyeong helped you when you were in a difficult situation.

90
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:03,010
What does that mean?

91
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:07,080
There were classmates picking on me because they were jealous I was going to perform.

92
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,000
They were picking on you?

93
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,600
- What are their names? 
 - Why? You'll go look for them?

94
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,470
Don't do anything. It's embarrassing.

95
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:18,160
Also, Ju Gyeong scolded them for me already.

96
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,590
Did she?

97
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,300
She must have lost some sense of fear.

98
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,720
That was a good meal.

99
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,380
You made it well. It was delicious.

100
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:34,450
It was very delicious.

101
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:40,250
Oppa! This was the only one left of my favorite ramen!

102
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:04,010
Hey feet, what's wrong with you? Why aren't you stopping?

103
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:06,170
Why aren't you going to school?

104
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:08,250
Where are you going?

105
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:12,070
Oh, I'm going to school. Where else?

106
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,830
What? Why?

107
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:23,510
Are you going to tease me by saying you'll listen to whatever I say?

108
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:26,590
No, that's not it.

109
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:28,000
I'll only listen to you.

110
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,440
You said you weren't going to say it. Are you joking?

111
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:33,700
If you keep messing with me at school, I won't let you go.

112
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,050
I won't be pushed around.

113
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:45,070
Why would you get in the way?

114
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:48,000
"I'll only listen to you."

115
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:50,730
Kang Su Jin.

116
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:53,590
Kim Si Hyeon.

117
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,300
Su Ah.

118
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,910
- Sang Hyeon. 
 - Yes.

119
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:05,190
Oh my god.  All of my rankings got worse.

120
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:08,250
  2nd out of 25 total 

121
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:13,080
Didn't you improve?

122
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:16,190
Where is the flower that blooms without getting shaken?

123
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:18,330
The beautiful flowers in this world all bloom

124
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:20,260
after getting shaken.

125
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:24,320
So don't be too discouraged by your grades today.

126
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,930
Teacher, please stop. Please.

127
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:29,900
Teacher, please, no.

128
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:32,410
Why does the wind blow so hard in my life?

129
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:34,860
Yeah, Hyeon Gyu, I think you should dwell on this a bit.

130
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:38,900
You know the parent teacher conferences start today right?

131
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:42,690
For those whose parents are coming today, make sure to tell me if there is any change.

132
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:44,760
Okay.

133
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,880
  Mom: I'm here at school. 

134
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,130
I'm doomed.

135
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:56,980
So, Ma'am, if you look  here,

136
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:59,110
it's a lucky number, right? Lucky seven.

137
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:01,170
Is she Genghis Khan or Taejo of Goryeo or something?

138
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:04,330
What the heck.  How could she unify  and get just one grade for everything?

139
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:08,670
I wonder if she just couldn't prepare well for exams because she was adjusting to school after transferring.

140
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:11,910
But with these grades...

141
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:15,380
she probably won't be able to get into colleges in Seoul, will she?

142
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:16,920
Yeah, no.

143
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,240
Gosh, this is making me mad.

144
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,620
Well, it's fine for now.

145
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:25,390
She can start working on her academic record with me from now on.

146
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,640
Ma'am!

147
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:39,430
Did you see it?

148
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:44,280
Well, there was nothing to see.

149
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,630
It's okay. You can overcome it.

150
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:52,630
I can overcome it?

151

Mom!

154
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,990
- Oh my gosh, isn't that Lee Ju Heon? 
 - Yes, it is him!

155
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:44,480
Why is he at our school?

156
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,920
It was so bright that

157
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,810
I thought someone turned on the lights, but it was you. You've arrived!

158
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:57,240
Hello, I'm Su Ho's homeroom teacher.

159
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,480
Nice to meet you. I'm Su Ho's father.

160
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,930
You know what?

161
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:04,260
How could you bring Korea's top star to school?

162
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,980
You should've paid him a visit instead.

163
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:08,260
Apologize! Apologize!

164
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:10,820
- I apol— wait, what? 
 - No, it's okay.

165
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,440
I was just curious about what my son's school was like.

166
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,130
Mom!

167
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:16,890
- Is this the counseling room? 
 - Yes, yes.

168
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:19,690
"I'll buy you with money!"

169
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:27,080
I was such a huge fan of "Love Maze."

170
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,920
Could you give me your autograph here, please?

171
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:33,210
I love you. I love you.

172
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:34,710
- Can I get your autograph, too? 
 - Yes, sure.

173
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:36,490
I'm a music teacher.

174
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:41,310
You can use my back.

175
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:44,820
I was a huge fan of 'Pure Love'.

176
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,140
Mom...

177
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:51,710
I'm teaching him music.

178
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:59,150
Lee Su Ho, Lee Su Ho. Hey, Su Ho. Hey, Su Ho.

179
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:00,610
What?

180
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:02,060
Ah seriously, why are you like this?

181
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:04,380
We really burn up the court together.

182
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:08,050
We're an NBA-level combination.

183
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:13,160
Like Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson. Understand, man?

184
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,980
- You? 
 - Oh my god!

185
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:18,410
Hey, Lee Su Ho! Your dad is Lee Ju Heon?

186
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:21,320
- What? The celebrity? 
 - Yeah, the celebrity Lee Ju Heon!

187
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:24,340
- Wow! Oh my god! 
 - What... what are you talking about?

188
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,830
Lee Ju Heon?

189
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:27,820
People said they saw him in front of the counseling room.

190
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:30,050
Wow, Lee Su Ho! That's amazing.

191
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:35,000
My mom is a huge fan. Could I possibly get his autograph?

192
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,500
The power of genetics is truly amazing.

193
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,490
  He said he had no family. 

194
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:44,470
Kang Su, did you already know about this?

195
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:47,570
Lee Su Ho hates gossip about him.

196
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:49,950
So that's why he didn't say anything.

197
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:51,890
Lee Ju Heon's the CEO of Move.

198
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:53,930
Lee Su Ho is pretty much a second-generation chaebol.

199
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:56,330
I was wondering why he'd always look down on everyone.

200
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:59,050
He's someone from a whole different world compared to us.

201
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:01,090
Yeah.

202
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:02,960
He's in a whole different world.

203
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,360
Didn't Lee Ju Heon's wife die a long time ago? So Lee Su Ho doesn't have a mom—

204
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,480
Hey. Stop with the nonsense. Quiet down and eat your food.

205
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:17,460
Lee Su Ho is great at studies and sports.

206
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:20,030
And he even takes after your appearance. He's flawless.

207
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:22,390
He's the top student!

208
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:24,890
Oh, is that so? Well, I'll see you again soon.

209
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:27,380
- Yes, thank you for coming. 
 - It's Lee Ju Heon!

210
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:29,540
Lee Ju Heon? The actor?

211
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:31,960
- Wow! You're so handsome! 
 - You're so cool!

212
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:34,740
Wow, what is this?

213
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:38,330
Hurry, get pictures!

214
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,290
Wow, this is crazy.

215
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:44,160
You're so handsome and cool!

216
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:47,600
Where'd she go?

217
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,560
Did the talk go well?

218
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,240
Yes.

219
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,720
- Su Ho. 
 - Why'd you come?

220
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,250
It's lunchtime. Have you eaten?

221
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:01,530
I told you not to come to school.

222
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:06,520
Don't you think you're being shameless by showing up like this?

223
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,590
Ju-Sama!

224
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:10,450
Mom! You didn't go yet?

225
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:12,020
I went to meet Ju Yeong's homeroom teacher too.

226
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:13,430
Just go!

227
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:15,820
Ju-Sama is right there!

228
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:17,860
Mom!

229
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:19,190
Nice to see you again.

230
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:21,140
Yes.

231
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:25,690
Is this your son?

232
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:29,830
You're so blessed to have a son like him.

233
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:33,130
Ah, yes.

234
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:36,480
You're Su Ho's classmate, right?

235
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,220
Yes, hello.

236
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:40,320
I'll be going.

237
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:49,610
Is he that prickly at school, too?

238
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:52,120
Yes, a bit.

239
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:55,100
- Let's go, Mom. 
 - Let go.

240
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:59,000
I was a bit sad to just get your autograph earlier.

241
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,200
Can I please get a picture, too?

242
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:21,140
  Did you have to kick Se Yeon out like that? 

243
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:22,430
  Do you want to blame me? 

244
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:25,520
  Seo Jun, you're not the only one hurting. 

245
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,480
  That powerless kid! 

246
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,050
  You could've protected him! 

247
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:34,120
  How dare you act like this to the CEO? 

248
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:38,980
  Do I look like a charity, going around protecting powerless kids? 

249
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,340
  All I did was settle a celebrity causing a social problem. 

250
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:45,680
  according to company policies. Is that a problem? 

251
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:55,350
Dad, you should've come instead. Why'd you send Mom?

252
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:59,310
When Mom comes, just rip up my report card, okay?

253
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:02,790
Spicy pork?

254
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:05,600
Alright, make it really spicy, okay?

255
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,470
Okay, love you, Dad. Bye.

256
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,910
Kang Su.

257
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:14,450
Why would you rip your report card?

258
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:18,200
My mom got Lee Ju Heon's autograph on my report card.

259
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,400
On the front or the back?

260
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,020
On the front.

261
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,990
Gosh, that's worth getting mad over.

262
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:28,380
Anyway, the only one who thinks of me is my dad.

263
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:31,690
Why? Because he's making you spicy pork?

264
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:33,870
Bingo.

265
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:36,840
You must be close to your dad. I'm jealous.

266
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,070
My dad is unemployed. You're jealous?

267
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:42,320
We lost our house because of a big mistake he made, too. Jealous?

268
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,950
 Lee Ju Heon 

269
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,840
Mom, you don't look good here. Isn't this an ugly picture?

270
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,950
My face isn't important, as long as

271
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:17,940
Ju Heon's face came out great.

272
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:22,270
But the camera can't capture his actual beauty's aura.

273
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:24,960
His face was literally shining.

274
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:30,780
This type of backstreet beauty and that nationwide beauty...

275
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:33,550
They're on different levels.

276
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:40,250
But...

277
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:43,750
How could you get him to sign your child's report card, though?

278
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,090
This? A report card?

279
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:48,610
It'd be worthy to call it a report card if the grades were good. This is embarrassing.

280
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:55,140
Son, cross your sister's name out really well.

281
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:57,700
Look at all these sevens.

282
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,810
She has so many she's bought.

283
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:05,400
Even though she's your kid, you're crossing the line.

284
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,270
Hold up.

285
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:11,340
Are you really trying to be sneaky right now?

286
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:17,750
We have to do this to knock some sense into her.

287
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:22,210
I'm home.

288
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:23,810
Hey.

289
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,610
Mom, isn't this my makeup?

290
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:31,290
Yeah. I'm going to throw all of it away.

291
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,050
I haven't used them all yet. Why are you throwing them away?

292
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:35,830
Should I just throw you away then?

293
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:40,550
Save my makeup, please. It's my lifeline. On the upcoming exam, I'll get my rank up by 20.

294
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:43,540
No, by 30 places. 30. Please.

295
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:46,480
I'd rather you say you'd use poop instead of  bean paste.

296
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,600
Mom, please!

297
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:59,290
  Losing is a habit. I told you to fix your habits. 

298
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:02,350
  You think I invested in you to see these grades? 

299
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:04,710
 You can't even beat that vulgar family's son. 

300
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:08,110
 You think you'll be able to go to medical school at Seoul University? 

301
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:38,950
My children, you've suffered lots.

302
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:41,990
I'll protect you guys.

303
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:48,380
Why did I leave this here? Nothing to like about it.

304
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:59,990
He's Jeong Se Yeon's friend and Lee Ju Heon's son.

305
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:02,900
How does he have so many secrets?

306
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:06,850
Is he not on good terms with his dad?

307
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:09,150
Is that why he said he had no family?

308
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:14,010
Oh, forget it. We're not friends anymore. Why do I care?

309
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:18,470
Let's not worry about it.

310
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:23,030
Place it on the glass slide quickly before the blood coagulates.

311
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:24,330
Okay.

312
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:26,170
Put the cover glass on top, too.

313
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:27,240
Got it.

314
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:30,940
First, check if the color changes with your eyes.

315
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:34,910
Then, we'll look using the microscope to see how the cell gets distorted.

316
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:36,400
Got it.

317
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,840
Ju Gyeong, look at this.

318
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,770
Let go.

319
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,240
I said, let go!

320
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,730
You can just use your words; you don't have to grab onto me.

321
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:30,700
I don't have anything to talk with you, so let go—

322
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:39,690
What's up with you guys? Did you fight?

323
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:03,580
    
 Unni, do you have time to spare after school? 

324
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:09,040
I feel a little better now that I've had something high-calorie.

325
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,840
Thanks, Go Woon.

326
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,660
I wanted to treat you to something more delicious.

327
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:16,010
This is totally fine! I've done nothing much.

328
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:19,850
Because your mouth is so filthy, I figured we needed to wash it!

329
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:25,470
Remember when you said that? I was so thankful on that day and at the festival, too, Unni.

330
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:27,040
It's good to see you look so bright.

331
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:31,370
Have those girls kept bothering you since then?

332
00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:33,150
They talk crap about me behind my back, of course.

333
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:36,060
They say that I caked my face with makeup so I could perform on stage.

334
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:40,140
And they wonder how I can bear to walk around bare-faced after that.

335
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:42,260
Are you okay, after hearing those things?

336
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:44,900
If I resent my own face because of their words,

337
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:49,250
that means that I acknowledge that I'm ugly.

338
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:53,570
So I'm just going to ignore them and keep living my life the way that I am.

339
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:59,430
You're so cool.

340
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:06,670
 Why am I so afraid to live my life the way that I am?  

341
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:09,170
 I'm so ugly. 

342
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:14,040
Oh right, do you think you could teach me how to do makeup?

343
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,710
Makeup?

344
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:20,420
Men should be handsome like this.

345
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:25,910
Whoa, nice. Wow!

346
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,430
Shall we begin?

347
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:33,210
♫  Okey dokey yo, is that true? Yes   ♫

348
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:37,030
♫  Okey dokey yo, is that true? Yes  ♫

349
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:39,690
♫  Okey dokey yo, is that true? Yes  ♫

350
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:45,240
♫  Okey dokey yo, say la la la la  ♫

351
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:48,970
♫  Okey dokey yo, is that true? Yes  ♫

352
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:51,060
♫  Okey dokey  ♫

353
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:58,310
What the hell? You were at home?

354
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:02,250
Put some clothes on at home, please!

355
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,370
Oh, you're here?

356
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:12,810
♫  Yes! Okey dokey yo, is that true?  ♫

357
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:16,470
Damn it!

358
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:25,570
H-Hey, I didn't see anything!

359
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:27,820
I'm serious!

360
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:33,990
Damn it!

361
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:42,020
I've told him so many times. It serves him right!

362
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:44,710
My younger brother always acts like that at home too.

363
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:48,590
Oh, he's in the same grade as you. Do you know Im Ju Yeong?

364
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:50,900
No, he's probably in a different class than I am.

365
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:54,690
You're better off not knowing him. Think of him as non-existing.

366
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:56,350
Thanks for everything today, Unni.

367
00:27:56,350 --> 00:28:00,060
What's there to be thankful for? You don't have to see me out, bye!

368
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:03,110
Safe travels!

369
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:08,840
Is she leaving?

370
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:12,940
Im Ju Gyeong!

371
00:28:13,810 --> 00:28:15,780
Im Ju Gyeong!

372
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:18,880
Ah, sorry.

373
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,870
You really... Now you're going to pull on my hair?

374
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:26,990
Well, you should have stopped when I called your name.

375
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:28,520
Why did you call me?

376
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:32,320
Huh? Oh... just.

377
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,220
Just?

378
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:38,200
- Let's go, I'll walk you home. 
 - Forget it, my house is just a quick bus ride away.

379
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:41,610
Who said I'll go all the way to your house? Just to the bus stop.

380
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:44,770
I know where the bus stop is. See ya.

381
00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:48,950
I wanted to say thanks for caring for Go Woon. I couldn't just let you leave.

382
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:50,870
What did you say?

383
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:53,010
- What? 
 - Tha...

384
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:56,320
- What? 
 - You said thanks!

385
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,590
Did I?

386
00:28:57,590 --> 00:29:00,320
Wow, who knew that you could say "thanks."

387
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,770
Say it again, so I can hear it clearly!

388
00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:04,190
Why would I repeat myself? You already heard it once.

389
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:06,570
I didn't hear it properly!

390
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,120
I'm sorry.

391
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:16,520
- You're sorry? 
 - I'm not going to say it twice.

392
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:22,970
No, I should be saying sorry.

393
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:28,570
- What for? 
 - To be honest, I saw everything.

394
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:30,500
Everything?

395
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,500
Your underwear.

396
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:38,540
Hey! You said you didn't see anything!

397
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:41,020
Hey!

398
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:47,600
Oh you came? Long time no see.

399
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:51,370
I haven't heard from Ju Bal. Does she have exams nowadays?

400
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:58,950
Im Ju Gyeong! You're here reading comics instead of studying, aren't you?

401
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:02,400
Oh my goodness! Su Ho?

402
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,250
What's gotten into you?

403
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:18,010
Mom, I'm home!

404
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:19,690
Oh, I can breathe now.

405
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:22,380
Dad, I'm hungry.

406
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:25,250
Welcome home, sweetie.

407
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:35,630
Mom, is that... Lee Su Ho standing next to you?

408
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:41,210
Of course, it's Su Ho. Did you think he was a statue or something?

409
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:50,020
Why would you bring him here?

410
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:53,750
He's my daughter's classmate, so I invited him over for a delicious meal.

411
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:55,680
Seriously, Mom, are you an anti-fan of my life?

412
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:58,550
Why are you doing this to me?

413
00:30:58,550 --> 00:31:00,520
Taste this.

414
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:03,730
Oof, Dad's tastes better.

415
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:16,150
Su Ho, are you closer to my Ju Gyeong in a romantic or a platonic way?

416
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:19,630
We're just not close at all! No closeness whatsoever.

417
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:22,370
Why would you ask that, Dad?

418
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:29,010
Is that so? Then, Su Ho, I hope that you will keep things that way in the future.

419
00:31:29,010 --> 00:31:32,280
Don't you have plans today?

420
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,810
Nope.

421
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:37,050
What are you talking about? Don't you have cram school today?

422
00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:39,710
What? Cram school?

423
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:41,580
I don't have classes today.

424
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:45,280
That's right! You must be starving, Su Ho.

425
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,980
Honey? Can you set up the big table with Ju Yeong?

426
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:50,200
We're going to feast like kings today.

427
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,670
Feast, my foot.

428
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:57,140
What are you doing? Sitting there like cold, stale coffee.

429
00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:01,500
What the hell?

430
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:15,980
Since we're not related, I'll address you like any other person.

431
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:19,350
Excuse me, Mr. Lee Su Ho.

432
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:20,840
How can I help you, Mr. Im Ju Yeong?

433
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:24,910
You've caught my sister bare-faced, correct?

434
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:26,210
It seems so.

435
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:28,400
Now that you know her weakness,

436
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,090
are you trying to give my sister a hard time?

437
00:32:30,090 --> 00:32:32,100
That is not the case.

438
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:35,210
From my perspective, it seems like she is uncomfortable around you.

439
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:37,180
And now you come all the way to our home?

440
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:39,670
Do you have feelings for her or something?

441
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:41,740
That is correct.

442
00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:49,410
Amusing. You are quite amusing.

443
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:51,900
You're good at ad-libbing.

444
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:55,720
But don't joke around like that with my sister.

445
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:58,210
She might misunderstand and get hurt.

446
00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:01,760
But I heard that you hurt her feelings the most.

447
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:04,510
You look down on her and act like it sucks to be related to her.

448
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:06,400
She said that?

449
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:10,210
Wow. You guys are close if she's told you those inner-feelings.

450
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:13,290
I'll acknowledge that.

451
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:18,140
Mr. Lee Su Ho, please carry your weight.

452
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,040
Oh no, this...

453
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:36,090
That table is one of the first furnishings I bought as a married woman.

454
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:39,610
- I apologize. 
 - What for?

455
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:43,520
I can't get married again but I can buy a new table, sure!

456
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:46,910
 Understanding Aromas 

457
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:52,200
I want to feed you a bite. Here, say "Ah!"

458
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,470
- Thank you. 
 - "Ah."

459
00:33:57,630 --> 00:33:59,450
Is it good?

460
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:03,350
If we hadn't gone broke, I could have fed you beef instead of pork.

461
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:08,010
Honey, I heard that pork is healthier than beef nowadays.

462
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:12,210
Oh wow, Young and Rich.

463
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:14,450
Hey, put that down.

464
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:18,320
Ju Gyeong's personality is so clumsy, and her grades aren't great either.

465
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,990
Her class rankings are straight sevens. 
  (TN: Korean high schools rank students out of nine for their grades.) 

466
00:34:20,990 --> 00:34:22,870
Mom, why are you airing out all of that stuff?

467
00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:25,640
My dear Ho, I heard that you're the top of your class.

468
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:27,630
Please take my Ju Gyeong under your wing.

469
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:29,680
- And study with her sometimes. 
 - Yes, ma'am.

470
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:33,620
But not just the two of you! Always in a big group.

471
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:36,560
Why would I study with this guy?

472
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:41,120
Excuse me, this is a genuine designer coat, right?

473
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,350
May I try it on?

474
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:45,610
I just want to see how it fits.

475
00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:47,620
- You little... 
 - Ouch.

476
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:48,810
You can have it if you like it.

477
00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:52,340
Hyung! In that case, thank you!

478
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:54,430
Hey, I said put that down.

479
00:34:54,430 --> 00:34:56,420
Why do you keep kicking me with your gross feet?

480
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:59,150
Let go! Let go!

481
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:01,660
Why you little—!

482
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:14,360
Su Ho is our guest. Can we try to be a little classier?

483
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,380
But Im Ju Bal keeps kicking me!

484
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:18,770
Let go of me, Im Ju Yeong!

485
00:35:18,770 --> 00:35:21,480
Do you want to die?

486
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:35,720
Ju Gyeong? Let's eat.

487
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:43,650
Hyung, do you have a younger sibling?

488
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:45,170
I don't.

489
00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:48,990
Then can I be your younger brother? I hate being her brother.

490
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:53,740
I don't like the idea of giving you my son, but I'd want to give you my daughter.

491
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:56,500
They don't even have their resident cards yet.

492
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:59,020
I'm just joking. Why are you taking it so seriously?

493
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:03,750
- Anyway, Su Ho, you have so many connections to our family. 
 - Pardon?

494
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:09,370
- My oldest daughter works at Move, your father's company. 
 - Yes.

495
00:36:09,370 --> 00:36:11,830
Let's grill the meat and clean up quickly.

496
00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:15,370
She was working at a conglomerate before going to Move last year.

497
00:36:15,370 --> 00:36:17,190
She was always so on point since she was a child.

498
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:21,770
My Hui Gyeong will be a very reliable employee for Mr. Lee Ju Heon.

499
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:31,450
Come back home. I'm back.

500
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,600
I'm back!

501
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,250
Thirsty.

502
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:48,570
- Eat a lot. Eat. 
 - There's no water.

503
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:52,730
I see she drank all the alcohol she could.

504
00:36:57,210 --> 00:37:01,800
- The lights went out again! 
 - This damn house! 
 - It's fine. We just have to find the circuit breaker.

505
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,570
Where is my phone?

506
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:06,650
- I'm sorry, Su Ho. Can you move out of the way? 
 - Yes.

507
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:09,700
Hold on, hold on!

508
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:12,140
- Oh... 
 - Oh no!

509
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:13,430
What's this?

510
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:15,320
- It's my foot. My foot. 
 - Foot?

511
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:18,100
- Why is the sofa up here?
- That's my butt. Seriously, this man.

512
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:20,970
Why are you hitting me?

513
00:37:20,970 --> 00:37:24,590
Oh no, oh no!

514
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:27,740
I found it!

515
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:30,640
Ah, save me!

516
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,030
Honey!

517
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:37,510
What's this?

518
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:45,240
- Move! 
 - Oh, my leg.

519
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:47,740
- What do I do? 
 - Oh, honey!

520
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:49,780
Honey!

521
00:37:54,770 --> 00:37:59,370
I just want to disappear right now.

522
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:11,380
So, why did you follow her?

523
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:13,310
You should've told her you were busy and left.

524
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,840
How could I do that?

525
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:17,170
You're good at that.

526
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:22,220
You're good at being cold and putting up a wall.

527
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:27,160
It must have been annoying and given you a hard time. Have a safe trip home.

528
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:34,400
Ah! This is so embarrassing!

529
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,280
Why did I put them here?

530
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:42,900
  Warning: Do Not Enter 

531
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,680
Hey, Im Ju Gyeong.

532
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:46,930
Hey!

533
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:49,940
- What? 
 - Why are you still sleeping?

534
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:52,270
I was studying until early this morning.

535
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:54,270
Oh, what's the occasion?

536
00:38:54,270 --> 00:38:57,170
You must be tired, so this is perfect. Let's go to sauna.

537
00:38:57,170 --> 00:38:59,810
I need to get rid of the alcohol in my system and cure my hangover.

538
00:38:59,810 --> 00:39:01,380
I don't want to, can't be bothered.

539
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:04,550
Why do you look so down these days? I'll buy you something delicious. Let's go.

540
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:07,560
- I don't have an appetite.
 - Is that so?

541
00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:10,800
Even if it's chicken feet?

542
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,860
- Okay.
 - Okay.

543
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:15,590
- Come out quickly.
 - Sikhye too!  (TN: a sweet rice beverage) 

544
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:18,470
- Okay!
 - And eggs!

545
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:19,990
Let's go over there.

546
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:24,950
  Thick layer of pinewood 

547
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:31,180
  #SpaLand #SteamedRoom #EatingShow #DateWithMySister 

548
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:40,040
So refreshing!

549
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:44,530
Why is it so hot?

550
00:39:44,530 --> 00:39:46,270
Hot!

551
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:57,760
  What's this? Why did I meet him again here of all places? 

552
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:10,310
Isn't this the hottest one? I hate it when it's too hot.

553
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:13,660
Hey, if a man can't handle this, are you really a man?

554
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:18,400
If you can't handle this, go and buy popsicles.

555
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:23,130
What are you saying? I said I hate it, not that I can't handle it.

556
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:24,610
The loser will buy eggs.

557
00:40:24,610 --> 00:40:26,120
Okay!

558
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:32,560
  I'm going to go crazy. 

559
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:35,980
Eggs and sikhye please.

560
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:37,810
And chicken feet!

561
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:40,500
Shall I make the chicken feet spicy?

562
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:45,360
 MEN 

563
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:57,700
 You're quite a handful. 

564
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:59,810
 I'm sorry. 

565
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,270
He was cute.

566
00:41:03,270 --> 00:41:06,770
Make it so that the roof of one's mouth will come off.

567
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:18,810
  Please get out. I'll become barbeque. 

568
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:22,270
It's Saturday, but you're not meeting your girlfriend?

569
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:24,440
What girlfriend?

570
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,700
I'll only listen to you~

571
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:28,350
Do you want to die? It's not like that.

572
00:41:28,350 --> 00:41:33,800
Why? You should try. Im Ju Gyeong is really pretty.

573
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:36,400
What pretty? Have your eyes gone crazy?

574
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,880
 Oh, that punk... 

575
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:41,070
Open your eyes wide and look again.

576
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:47,790
Hey! Hey, hey. That ahjumma over there hasn't moved since earlier.

577
00:41:47,790 --> 00:41:52,050
Do you think she fainted because it's so hot in here?

578
00:41:52,050 --> 00:41:54,470
Ahjumma! Are you okay?

579
00:41:54,470 --> 00:42:00,180
I'm fine! Every part of my body hurts, so I need to heat myself up right down to my bones!

580
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:03,930
- So refreshing.
 - You're a true pro, ma'am.

581
00:42:03,930 --> 00:42:06,820
She's such a pro.

582
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:11,490
Hey, in front of a pro, I think this is meaningless.

583
00:42:11,490 --> 00:42:15,120
I'm going to just go and eat ice cream!

584
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,920
Hey, buy eggs, Kim Cho Rong!

585
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,120
I can't handle this.

586
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,970
Isn't that too hot?

587
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:36,690
You're going to eat something cheap, right?

588
00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:38,600
What can I get you?

589
00:42:41,270 --> 00:42:42,980
Eggs.

590
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:47,580
- Hey! The chicken feet came out, Im Ju—
 - No!

591
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:52,650
  Lee Ju Heon 

592
00:42:52,650 --> 00:42:55,600
- Oh my. You saw Lee Ju Heon? 
 - Yeah.

593
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:58,890
You totally lucked out!

594
00:42:58,890 --> 00:43:00,910
What's this?

595
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:03,940
Ju Gyeong's report card?

596
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:11,950
I mean, how could all three kids study well?

597
00:43:11,950 --> 00:43:14,680
If a girl is pretty...

598
00:43:16,770 --> 00:43:19,580
She can just be kind.

599
00:43:20,350 --> 00:43:22,980
I'm going to go.

600
00:43:27,790 --> 00:43:31,580
If this is Lee Ju Hyeon's autograph, it should be handed down to my descendants for three generations as a family heirloom.

601
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:33,730
Of all things, that girl's report card.

602
00:43:33,730 --> 00:43:35,920
Do I have to guard it for my descendants?

603
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:42,110
Welome!

604
00:43:42,110 --> 00:43:43,570
Hello.

605
00:43:43,570 --> 00:43:46,480
Oh my. Teacher.

606
00:43:56,490 --> 00:44:00,620
  #SpaLand #SteamedRoom #EatingShow #DateWithMySister 

607
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:02,460
She's excited.

608
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:13,160
- You can sit here.
 - Thank you.

609
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:51,520
 Jeong Se Yeon 

610
00:44:55,810 --> 00:44:59,810
 Jeong Se Yeon 

611
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:05,430
Hey, no one will recognize your bare face. Why did you run away?

612
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:07,990
Just in case.

613
00:46:07,990 --> 00:46:10,720
Is this what it feels like when a criminal who has committed a crime is hiding away?

614
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:14,860
Because of you, I can't do a sauna nor eat chicken feet. What is this? Hey, hey, hey.

615
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:17,850
Let's buy hamburgers. I'll give you my card, so hurry and buy it.

616
00:46:17,850 --> 00:46:20,110
You buy it.

617
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:23,120
What about the car? Hurry and come back.

618
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:26,490
- I'm going to eat two then.
 - Okay.

619
00:46:30,810 --> 00:46:33,490
- You're going to wear that?
- Yup.

620
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:39,060
  #SpaLand #SteamedRoom #EatingShow #DateWithMySister 

621
00:46:47,950 --> 00:46:50,030
I really did meet her.

622
00:46:54,910 --> 00:46:58,140
- What should we eat today? 
 - What did they say?

623
00:46:58,140 --> 00:46:59,870
That you got turned down by God Seo Jun

624
00:46:59,870 --> 00:47:01,700
and totally got dissed by Sinhwa High kids.

625
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:04,420
What? What damn punk...

626
00:47:05,270 --> 00:47:06,520
Seriously, it totally ruined my mood.

627
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:09,640
- What are you going to eat?
 - Just order whatever and come on up.

628
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:12,600
Oh, so then.

629
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:15,930
Customer 82, your order has arrived.

630
00:47:15,930 --> 00:47:19,710
- Then some premium and original burgers... 
 - Thank you.

631
00:47:20,950 --> 00:47:24,730
 Sister: I can't stay parked here, so I'm going home first. Take a cab home. Use my credit card. 

632
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:29,610
Im Ju Gyeong?

633
00:47:29,610 --> 00:47:31,880
Hey!

634
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:34,660
Wow, our dumpling, it's been a long time.

635
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:37,670
- You're as ugly as ever! 
 - I think you've become even uglier!

636
00:47:37,670 --> 00:47:40,840
I... I'll be going.

637
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:45,400
Hey, where are you going when I haven't finished talking?

638
00:47:45,990 --> 00:47:48,170
Where did you transfer to?

639
00:47:49,210 --> 00:47:52,760
I moved away from the city... I'm going to a relative's house today.

640
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:57,210
Did you know there was a rumor that you transferred because I bullied you?

641
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,890
What have you been going around telling people?

642
00:48:00,890 --> 00:48:04,140
Why... did you...

643
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:07,280
make someone a bad person?

644
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:09,430
That's not it.

645
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:14,290
That must hurt.

646
00:48:16,770 --> 00:48:19,670
Hey, put your number in.

647
00:48:32,430 --> 00:48:37,730
My wallet! It has my school ID.

648
00:48:37,730 --> 00:48:40,200
Oh, finders keepers.

649
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:43,100
Jackpot!

650
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:11,940
Here.

651
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:23,740
- Are you okay?
 - You're asking if I'm okay?

652
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:27,700
Why? Did you help me because you felt pity for me again?

653
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:30,320
We're not on close terms, so you should have ignored it and left.

654
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:32,970
Who are you to be nosy and help? It's embarrassing!

655
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:35,880
- Im Ju Gyeong.
 - Like an idiot...

656
00:49:37,710 --> 00:49:42,450
When I got excited thinking I got a bit closer to you, you told me not to misunderstand.

657
00:49:42,450 --> 00:49:45,570
You said it's bothersome and annoying!

658
00:49:45,570 --> 00:49:49,430
- Im Ju Gyeong.
 - So that's why I've been avoiding you.

659
00:49:49,430 --> 00:49:52,600
Why would you set boundaries between us and then cross them?

660
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:55,400
You're making me confused going this way and that.

661
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:57,030
Ju Gyeong.

662
00:49:59,740 --> 00:50:01,810
It's them, right?

663
00:50:04,010 --> 00:50:09,740
Before you transferred... your bullies.

664
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:15,640
You must have been surprised.

665
00:50:19,740 --> 00:50:22,180
You were really scared, right?

666
00:50:44,430 --> 00:50:45,900
I think I saw Lee Su Ho.

667
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:47,900
Lee Su Ho?

668
00:50:48,750 --> 00:50:50,720
What's wrong?

669
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:53,550
- Because Kim Cho Rong is here. 
 - What?

670
00:50:55,060 --> 00:50:58,200
- Again?
 - What are you saying?

671
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:01,230
- Let's go.
 - I'm pretty sure.

672
00:51:03,070 --> 00:51:06,000
- Did he leave?
 - Huh?

673
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:11,850
No.

674
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:16,680
Not yet.

675
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:18,860
What do I do?

676
00:51:25,390 --> 00:51:27,270
It's okay.

677
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:31,440
It's okay now.

678
00:52:00,220 --> 00:52:02,430
Don't get caught and go.

679
00:52:25,970 --> 00:52:29,110
Wow, I came face to face with a real bastard.

680
00:52:29,110 --> 00:52:31,240
It's Han Seo Jun.

681
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:34,180
Let's eat hamburgers next time.

682
00:52:34,180 --> 00:52:35,970
Let's go.

683
00:52:35,970 --> 00:52:40,010
Hey. Why do you keep running away when you see me?

684
00:52:40,010 --> 00:52:44,870
We used to get along, and now you're setting boundaries between us?

685
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:48,380
- My feelings are so hurt. 
 - Let's not make a fuss, alright?

686
00:52:48,380 --> 00:52:52,120
Wow, this dude looks so scary when he's acting seriously.

687
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:58,500
Oh? I'm sorry. I thought this was the trash can.

688
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:01,810
- You want to die—
 - If you don't want to die, then quietly go away.

689
00:53:01,810 --> 00:53:05,700
I don't want to get involved with thugs like you.

690
00:53:08,050 --> 00:53:10,900
Lee Seong Yong, let's just go.

691
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:15,290
What? What do you want to do here?

692
00:53:15,290 --> 00:53:18,760
When shall we fight?

693
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:20,950
I'll see.

694
00:53:20,950 --> 00:53:24,930
- Let's go, let's go.
 - Ah, please!

695
00:53:36,470 --> 00:53:40,130
No, you can't blink your eyes, Mr. Han.

696
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:46,880
You just have to be like this for 15 minutes.

697
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:50,980
Although it's a little awkward at first, once it grabs its place, it'll look natural.

698
00:53:50,980 --> 00:53:55,400
Once you put some thick eyebrows on this face,

699
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:59,060
- that'll be the cherry on top! 
 - Thank you.

700
00:53:59,060 --> 00:54:02,580
- Oh, it's raining outside, Madam Hong! 
 - Yeah?

701
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:08,620
Han Jun Woo?

702
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:10,710
Im Hui Gyeong?

703
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:15,970
Teacher, you know my eldest daughter?

704
00:54:15,970 --> 00:54:18,820
- Ye—No.
 - N-No?

705
00:54:18,820 --> 00:54:21,810
Your eldest daughter?  Then, Ju Gyeong's sister?

706
00:54:21,810 --> 00:54:23,520
Yes.

707
00:54:25,260 --> 00:54:27,470
My shoes. Shoes.

708
00:54:27,470 --> 00:54:31,220
Shoes?

709
00:54:31,220 --> 00:54:33,020
Oh my. Why, why?

710
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:37,480
- Goodbye.
 - Where are you going? Han Jun Woo!

711
00:54:39,050 --> 00:54:41,210
Jun Woo!

712
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:46,620
Jun Woo!

713
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:57,680
I caught you!

714
00:55:01,430 --> 00:55:04,700
You'll catch a cold. Use this and go.

715
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:14,330
- What are you doing? 
- You're getting rained on.

716
00:55:14,330 --> 00:55:16,960
- You should hurry and use this.
 - I'm okay, so you can use this and go.

717
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:19,710
No. But still, you're getting rained on.

718
00:55:19,710 --> 00:55:22,770
You keep getting rained on. Come here.

719
00:55:34,110 --> 00:55:36,740
I can't hold it in.

720
00:55:37,910 --> 00:55:40,650
I'm going to do something bad from now.

721
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,370
If you're scared, run away.

722
00:56:07,540 --> 00:56:09,690
Go back safely!

723
00:56:10,790 --> 00:56:13,960
If I call you, make sure to answer it!

724
00:56:57,980 --> 00:57:00,550
  I have confirmed your identity. 

725
00:57:20,990 --> 00:57:25,730
 Let's be successful! Hwaiting!

 ♫  Become a star by my side  ♫

730
00:58:37,010 --> 00:58:42,290
This crazy jerk, Lee Seong Yong. Why does he keep on calling since yesterday?

731
00:58:43,910 --> 00:58:47,430
Hm? Im Ju Gyeong?

732
00:58:48,450 --> 00:58:51,450
I went here too.

733
00:58:54,540 --> 00:58:57,170
Pretending to be pretty.

Roar!

737
00:59:37,780 --> 00:59:40,100
Come on, come on!

738
00:59:40,100 --> 00:59:44,450
- Curve it. 
 - Nice!

739
00:59:47,940 --> 00:59:49,880
Come on, this is...

740
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:54,680
Hey, I skipped school for this and you're going to stay here like this?

741
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:56,400
I'll play one more game. Just one more.

742
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:59,230
- That's what you just said for the last game.
 - This one will finish soon.

743
00:59:59,230 --> 01:00:01,400
Just sit for a bit.

744
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:02,930
Does Han Seo Jun keep not answering his phone?

745
01:00:02,930 --> 01:00:05,510
He's ignoring me, that arrogant jerk.

- Look. 
 - Hey! Wow!

748
01:00:13,490 --> 01:00:15,330
I know who Han Seo Jun's girlfriend is.

749
01:00:15,330 --> 01:00:19,780
- What? 
 - Her name is Im Ju Gyeong.

750
01:00:23,140 --> 01:00:24,620
Im Ju Gyeong?

751
01:00:25,530 --> 01:00:28,320
This girl's name is Im Ju Gyeong too.

752
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:33,070
Damn, that's hilarious.  She has the same name as Im Dumpling of all people.

753
01:00:34,410 --> 01:00:36,400
- They're the same.
 - She's so pretty.

754
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:41,570
Hey. You said she's Han Seo Jun's girlfriend? Really?

755
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:46,690
Wow, that's awesome.

756
01:00:46,690 --> 01:00:48,660
So this can happen.

757
01:00:48,660 --> 01:00:51,860
Im Ju Gyeong?

758
01:00:54,590 --> 01:00:56,830
Okay, today...

759
01:01:01,850 --> 01:01:05,750
- Pay attention to your lectures. That's it. 
 - What?

760
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:10,870
Today, our absentee is Su Ho. Su Ho is absent today.

761
01:01:10,870 --> 01:01:12,570
Just know that!

762
01:01:12,570 --> 01:01:14,840
Teacher!

763
01:01:15,460 --> 01:01:17,470
Huh? Is he not doing words of wisdom?

764
01:01:17,470 --> 01:01:19,660
He must have finished everything. He doesn't have any more.

765
01:01:19,660 --> 01:01:21,170
Is Teacher constipated?

766
01:01:21,170 --> 01:01:22,620
Because you said that, my stomach hurts.

767
01:01:22,620 --> 01:01:24,880
What are you saying?

768
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:27,070
Hey, he's a bit...

769
01:01:28,870 --> 01:01:30,850
Absent?

770
01:01:31,930 --> 01:01:33,630
What's going on?

771
01:01:33,630 --> 01:01:35,770
What's with Lee Su Ho?

772
01:01:39,650 --> 01:01:42,600
 Lee Su Ho, what's wrong? Is something going on? 

773
01:02:08,940 --> 01:02:11,950
  Why did you not come today? 

774
01:02:15,170 --> 01:02:18,230
  You're not hurt somewhere, right? 

775
01:02:23,050 --> 01:02:25,050
  When you come back, bring Melona ice cream.  
  (TN: Melon flavored Korean ice cream brand) 

776
01:02:25,050 --> 01:02:28,690
This jerk, always making his sister do chores!

777
01:02:35,020 --> 01:02:38,890
Your creatinine levels, which were previously a bit high, have decreased.

778
01:02:38,890 --> 01:02:41,470
All your other lab values are normal.

779
01:02:41,470 --> 01:02:43,860
I'll decrease the dosage of your prescription.

780
01:02:43,860 --> 01:02:46,910
- Okay.
 - That's a relief.

781
01:02:46,910 --> 01:02:47,870
Turned out well, Mom!

782
01:02:47,870 --> 01:02:50,570
See? I told you to not worry.

783
01:02:50,570 --> 01:02:51,590
Thank you.

784
01:02:51,590 --> 01:02:53,890
You should thank Dr. Kang.

785
01:02:53,890 --> 01:02:58,820
He said it was a favor from your son's acquaintance, so he mobilized this hospital's best staff members.

786
01:02:58,820 --> 01:02:59,980
My acquaintance?

787
01:02:59,980 --> 01:03:02,600
I said I only need to see him for a little while.

788
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:04,350
I said he's in surgery right now!

789
01:03:04,350 --> 01:03:06,060
And you need an appointment!

790
01:03:06,060 --> 01:03:07,670
Just for awhile!

791
01:03:07,670 --> 01:03:09,620
What's going on?

792
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,510
  From Kang Su Jin: What’s going on, Su Ho? 

793
01:03:35,510 --> 01:03:37,570
 From Yoo Tae Hoon: Su Ho~ Is something wrong? 

794
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:40,400
 From Im Ju Gyeong: one new photo message  

795
01:03:45,070 --> 01:03:47,490
I'm going crazy, seriously.

796
01:03:50,030 --> 01:03:52,620
I should've checked it properly before sending it...

797
01:03:52,620 --> 01:03:55,250
So embarrassing, seriously!

798
01:03:55,250 --> 01:03:57,660
I'm such an idiot.

799
01:03:57,660 --> 01:04:02,250
   
 I'm almost there. I'll reserve a seat. 

800
01:04:12,190 --> 01:04:14,120
Im Ju Gyeong, hi!

801
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:16,130
Have you been doing well?

802
01:04:17,080 --> 01:04:19,360
Of course we'd block this side.

803
01:04:19,360 --> 01:04:21,210
Were you surprised?

804
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:25,960
Hey!

805
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:32,920
  It was the first time since his mother died that Su Ho searched for me. 

806
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:38,450
  He was asking a favor, almost crying, saying to save his friend's mother. 

807
01:04:45,890 --> 01:04:47,290
What's going on?

808
01:04:47,290 --> 01:04:51,890
You... Do you know Dr. Kang?

809
01:04:51,890 --> 01:04:54,490
Who did you hear that from?

810
01:04:54,490 --> 01:04:56,460
Why'd you do it?

811
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:04,800
Did you think I'd come to you crying out of thanks if I find out?

812
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:08,230
Did you do that behind my back expecting that?!

813
01:05:08,230 --> 01:05:11,430
Would you not have done the same?

814
01:05:11,430 --> 01:05:14,460
If you were me...

815
01:05:14,460 --> 01:05:17,970
If my mother was about to die, would you not have done the same?

816
01:05:17,970 --> 01:05:23,150
Because you were my friend. That's why I did it.

817
01:05:23,150 --> 01:05:28,550
If you're that angry receiving help from me, then just forget it.

818
01:05:28,550 --> 01:05:30,620
Then that'll fix it.

819
01:05:31,980 --> 01:05:33,650
Lee Su Ho!

820
01:05:35,180 --> 01:05:37,290
What's this, Im Ju Gyeong?

821
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:44,430
Oh, Han Seo Jun. You answered your girlfriend's call right away.

822
01:05:46,370 --> 01:05:49,910
Han Seo Jun, I'm waiting for you. Come here quickly.

What's with Im Ju? She said she was almost here.

831
01:06:22,590 --> 01:06:25,050
She didn't want to listen to the lecture so she skipped.

Would Ju Gyeong do that?

What?
