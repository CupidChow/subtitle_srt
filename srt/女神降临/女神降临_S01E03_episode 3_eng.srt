1
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:04,730
  True Beauty 

2
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:15,090


3
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:32,110
 True Beauty 

4
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,340
What's going on?

5
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:53,840
What's happening?

6
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:13,670
He's so cool.

7
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:16,520
Is the show over!?

8
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:23,110
You can't even help out your classmate, but you sit back and watch.

9
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:25,580
Get back inside now, all of you. Now!

10
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:27,630
Yes, yes, sir!

11
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:31,800
All of you come to school just to mess around!

12
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:09,680
Hey, Lee Su Ho.

13
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:13,660
You've been stepping out of line lately.

14
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:16,250
- Did you return to school just to see me? 
 - What?

15
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:18,580
I mean, why are you keeping tabs on me or something?

16
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:21,830
- What kind of BS— 
 - Whether I step out of line or not, it's none of your business.

17
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:25,110
And stop being so obvious about trailing me because you're self-conscious.

18
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:30,110
 Episode 3 

19
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,610
Wow that could have been really bad.

20
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:55,660
Thanks...

21
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:59,390
But why did you help me?

22
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,640
Hey, you.

23
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:06,260
Nevermind.

24
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,900
- You better bring back my helmet tomorrow— 
 - Okay!

25
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:12,130
Hey! My helmet!

26
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:21,410
Oh, Ju Gyeong! Are you okay?

27
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:27,460
- I-I-I'm sorry. 
 - Don't play around like that again.

28
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:29,660
It's okay. I'm fine, I swear.

29
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,950
I was super shocked when I saw Lee Su Ho earlier.

30
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:34,430
It's the first time I've seen him helping someone.

31
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:36,970
Right?

32
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:39,930
He probably did it because the dean was right there.

33
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:47,020
By the way, our Ju Gyeong is still pretty, even after she got cake all over her face.

34
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:49,350
Are you okay?

35
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:55,480
I know, I know.

36
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:04,230
No way!

37
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:11,010
 No way. He didn't do that because he knows about my bare face, right? 

38
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:15,330
No way!

39
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,300
W-What's going on? What's going on?

40
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:33,230
- What do you think? 
 - Maybe he figured it out, right?

41
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:35,290
That's why he shielded you so you wouldn't get caught bare-faced.

42
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:36,770
Probably, right?

43
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:41,160
How long has he known? He still seemed clueless until recently.

44
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,460
Why did he do that, though?

45
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:46,170
He's really not the type to cover up for someone or anything like that.

46
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:48,630
People call him a sociopath!

47
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:51,250
Maybe to pick on your weaknesses.

48
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,810
Why!

49
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:54,860
It's not like it's illegal to be ugly!

50
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:57,690
You're committing goddess-fraud!

51
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:01,600
It's not like I scammed people for money with my goddess-fraud.

52
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,620
- And I haven't caused any trouble— 
 - You said you dared to act up to him, though.

53
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:07,660
And the fact that you're tricking all of these people

54
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:10,870
is super offensive. You're screwed now.

55
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:14,830
Then, why doesn't he just get angry with me?

56
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:18,660
Do you think he's trying to get revenge on you?

57
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:21,320
Revenge? Why? How?

58
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:25,890
He's slowly closing in on your neck, putting you through blood-curdling torment.

59
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:28,350
And then!

60
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:32,640
Revenge is a dish best served cold.

61
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,750
There's a saying like that, you know.

62
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:38,420
Ah, I'm going to lose my mind.

63
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,810
I'm leaving.

64
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:43,270
Okay.

65
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:48,360
Whoa, are you close with that noona?

66
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,020
She's so pretty! Can you hook me up with her?

67
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:52,220
Let me flirt with her a little.

68
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:55,660
What? You want to flirt, even though you have a girlfriend?

69
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:58,840
Alright! English isn't difficult at all!

70
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:02,010
- So just trust in me and let me guide you. Okay? 
 - Yes.

71
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:05,910
Good. Now, singular nouns are about one single—

72
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:07,880
 Does he really know? 

73
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:12,180
 No, I don't know for sure. But what if! 

74
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:16,160
And a plural noun indicates that there are more than one of that noun.

75
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,690
 Plural, plural, plural 
 (TN: "plural" and "revenge" are homonyms in Korean) 

76
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:22,700
So, in terms of people or things,

77
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:25,370
if you have more than one of those,

78
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:29,070
the noun would be in plural form.

79
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:32,130
 Do you think he's trying to get revenge on you? 

80
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:35,810
Alright! Chapter one.

81
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:37,570
Good, now.

82
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:39,520
Plural and singular.

83
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,420
Based on the number of things present,

84
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:44,230
- the form of the noun will change. 
 - Earthquake?

85
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,160
In the case that a word is not a plural noun,

86
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,630
but there is the letter "s" at the end of the word,

87
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:51,470
it is easy to mistake that word for a plural noun.

88
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:55,200
Now, the most important thing in science class is safety.

89
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,430
Please be careful not to get hurt.

90
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:58,790
Okay.

91
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:01,970
When you're using an alcohol lamp, to avoid the solution spatter,

92
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:05,040
please be sure to lean your test tube in the direction away from other people as you work.

93
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,370
Okay.

94
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:09,840
And don't put the test tube directly over the flame, but toward the edge of the flame.

95
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:15,230
- And very cautiously, gently mix the solution as it heats up. 
 - Okay.

96
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:18,050
You'll be presenting your results after the lab, so—

97
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:23,060
 He's slowly closing in on your neck, 

98
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:25,410
 putting you through blood-curdling torment. 

99
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:27,220
 And then! 

100
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,510
Are you okay? Grab a tissue.

101
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:33,930
We should wipe this up.

102
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:36,570
- Ju Gyeong? 
 - Huh? Yes?

103
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:38,530
Are you feeling ill?

104
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:41,820
No, I'm okay.

105
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,730
- S-Sorry. 
 - You should be more careful!

106
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:07,520
Su Ho, we're sorry!

107
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,320
I'm going to get revenge on you—

108
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,370
Revenge?

109
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:13,640
What's wrong, Ju Gyeong?

110
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:16,650
Im Ju Gyeong.

111
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:25,830
- I'm going to get— 
 - Ah!

112
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:29,000
Ju Gyeong, what's the matter?

113
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:35,000
Did I upset you somehow? Why do you keep running away from me?

114
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,100
The science teacher told me to get you a copy of my notes.  (T/N: 'Copy' in Korean is 'boksa', which sounds similar to 'revenge'/boksu.) 

115
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,730
I marked the sections that we had learned before you transferred to our school.

116
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:42,060
Hurry up and go make a copy of it.

117
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,160
Copy?

118
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:03,800
 Prince Comics 

119
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:07,190
Today is such a long day.

120
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:31,540
 Lee Su Ho 

121
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:44,040
This phone number does not exist. Please check the number you have dialed and try again—

122
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,390
 This is lame, Im Ju Bal. 

123
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,130
Y-yeah, it was lame.

124
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:52,400
Meet me at the comic book store.

125
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:55,750
- W-What's the occasion? 
 - I have something to give you.

126
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,640
No! You can keep it. Keep it.

127
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,290
You don't even know what it is. I'll be waiting.

128
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:05,100
H-Hello? Hey, Lee Su Ho!

129
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,480
Ugh, forget it!

130
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,980
Wait for me or don't wait, I don't care.

131
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:16,410
Wait.

132
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:22,070
I'm going to take this opportunity to make sure that he can't possibly suspect me as Im Ju Gyeong.

133
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,060
Looks like the lightbulb is going to die.

134
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:48,970
Hey Ju Bal, can you watch the shop for me?

135
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:52,670
Yes, Ju Bal is here!

136
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:55,710
I need to fix that fast.

137
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,860
You're here?

138
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:08,380
- Long time no see. 
 - I don't think it was a long time, though.

139
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:15,400
Sure. But why did you want to see me?

140
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:22,280
- Here. It's best served cold. 
 - Revenge?

141
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:25,780
Tiramisu. I wanted to thank you for letting me read  The Cursed Mask. 

142
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,830
Oh, tiramisu! You didn't have to get this for me.

143
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,600
You must have come here right after school.

144
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,150
I've never seen you in your uniform before.

145
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:41,300
Never?

146
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:44,140
Right? It's such a pretty uniform!

147
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:46,420
By the way, at my school...

148
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,820
There's a girl who looks just like you.

149
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:51,850
Is that so?

150
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:58,010
I have a pretty common face, so I hear that a lot.

151
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:02,500
So you attend a co-ed school? Where do you go to school?

152
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:03,880
Saebom High School.

153
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:06,460
I've never heard of it.

154
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:09,120
It must be in a different neighborhood.

155
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,220
Where do you go to school?

156
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,690
Me?

157
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:20,190
I go to a school in Haenam, all the way at the tip of  Southern Gyeongsang Province.

158
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:21,710
I go to school there.

159
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:23,920
Isn't that in Southern Jeolla province?

160
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,180
Oh right! At the tip of Jeolla province.

161
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:31,920
Haenam in J-J-Jeolla.

162
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:33,580
Gosh.

163
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:34,860
Then, are you a transfer student?

164
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:38,040
What do you mean transfer? I dropped out.

165
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,100
I'm immigrating to Canada soon.

166
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:43,520
But in the meantime, I'm staying with my grandma for a bit.

167
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,940
- Where in Canada? 
 - Where?

168
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,270
The capital. Got to go to the capital.

169
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:52,020
- Vancouver! 
 - Ottawa?

170
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:56,380
Ottawa. There!

171
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:01,460
I'm bad at geography.

172
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:05,020
Anyway, I was really glad to have met a fellow horror-maniac.

173
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:08,280
But it's such a shame that I'll never see you again for the rest of my life.

174
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,140
Why do I have the feeling that we'll see each other again, then?

175
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:13,460
Gosh, you must be sad about it too. Come visit Attawa when you're in university!

176
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:14,580
Ottawa?

177
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:18,640
Ottawa. That's what I said, Ottawa.

178
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:22,930
I... I should get going now.

179
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:25,660
Thanks for this. Stay healthy. Bye!

180
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:27,680
I'm at a loss for words.

181
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,490
Im Ju Gyeong.

182
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:52,740
You're so bad at acting.

183
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:55,820
You're Im Ju Gyeong, aren't you?

184
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,960
No, I'm Im Ju Bal.

185
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:07,220
I called the phone number that I have saved for Im Ju Gyeong though.

186
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:10,840
But you showed up here. Care to explain?

187
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:13,220
I'll explain everything.

188
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:14,700
Go ahead.

189
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,410
She's my cousin.

190
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:19,710
My phone is broken, so I'm borrowing Ju Gyeong's.

191
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,030
You expect me to believe that?

192
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:22,200
It's not unbelievable either.

193
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,880
Your voices are the same too.

194
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,230
It runs in the family.

195
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,160
So you're not her?

196
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,340
No way!

197
00:15:57,810 --> 00:15:59,490
But...

198
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,610
To me...

199
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:25,830
You're Im Ju Gyeong.

200
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:46,110
Im Ju Gyeong, you came here instead of studying, didn't you?

201
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:49,040
Im Ju Gyeong!

202
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:54,270
Fine! I'm Im Ju Gyeong. What about it?!

203
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:57,250
Are you going to report me for acting like a goddess fraudulently?

204
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:02,340
What are you going to do about it? Huh? What are you going to do!

205
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:12,810
Wow, what an incredible Im Ju Gyeong you are! You better go straight home!

206
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:29,670
It's all over.

207
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:39,110
Why is my life like this, seriously.

208
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:49,700
This was brand new.

209
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:52,870
What does she have against my school uniform?

210
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,710
 The Cursed Mask 

211
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:31,730
 Thanks for keeping my bare face a secret! 

212
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:39,700
 Excuse me. Wait. This... I brought the wrong thing, so let go. 

213
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:42,950
 These are sanitary pads. 

214
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:45,110
 I'll give it to you again tomorrow. 

215
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:57,270
 Su Ho! 

216
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:00,200
 Do you know Im Ju Gyeong's number? 

217
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,720
 I'll go take it off in the bathroom. 

218
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,390
 - What's wrong with her? 
 - As if I wasn't sad enough about being ugly! 

219
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:13,300
 Why is my life so sh*tty! 

220
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:30,890
Oh my goodness! Oh, what a shock.

221
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:34,470
This little brat! I told her to go study but she's passed out here.

222
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:39,950
Mom... Can I drop out of school?

223
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:43,190
What's this sewage smell?

224
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:46,120
This darn old house.

225
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:52,850
Ah, you scared the sh*t out of me!

226
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,030
W-what are you doing here?

227
00:19:55,030 --> 00:20:00,430
Unni... Can you stomp me to death?

228
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:03,850
Mom, I'm home! What are you doing?

229
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:07,490
The smell of sewage keeps coming into our house. What a big problem.

230
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:10,420
Oh, you're right, it really smells. What do we do?

231
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:12,230
Oh, this is serious.

232
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:16,030
Of course, the sewage smell is more important than I am.

233
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:17,380
Mom, what are you doing?

234
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:19,910
Of course.

235
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,680
What is this?

236
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:52,800
Im Ju Gyeong? Im Ju Gyeong!

237
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:57,100
Where is your head at? Go tell your sister that dinner is ready.

238
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:05,200
What's wrong with her?

239
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,640
What on earth has her more occupied than her studies?

240
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:12,270
She gives me a hard time, just like her father does.

241
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:16,650
Honey, you're getting heated up again. Here, have some cold tea.

242
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:18,690
Ah, how refreshing!

243
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:20,210
It's too cold!

244
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:30,860
Unni, Mom says it's time for dinner.

245
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:39,590
Ugh, I told you not to dive into the enemy!

246
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,600
You should just keep playing your role.

247
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,570
 Do not be afraid. Ruin awaits those who are afraid. 

248
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:49,130
Ruin. Do you think I'll lay down and die like this?

249
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:52,190
Here I go. Solo kill, let's go!

250
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:59,380
 Ruin, ruin, ruin awaits those who are afraid! 

251
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:04,350
 That's right. I won't be afraid. 

252
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:08,990
 Take my slash! 

253
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:30,780
Make sure to eat the side dishes before they go bad.

254
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,870
You didn't eat any of dishes I brought last time?

255
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:38,890
I tend to eat out a lot.

256
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:40,130
Why? Does it taste bad?

257
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:44,470
Yes. No! That's not why.

258
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:50,300
I should've just focused on cleaning instead of bothering to make bad tasting food, right?

259
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:53,600
It's tasty. It's really good.

260
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:57,790
Right? Even when you're busy, you need to make sure you're well fed.

261
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:09,800
 Can we meet a little earlier? I have to talk to you about something. 

262
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:13,020
- I'll head out now. 
 - Wait.

263
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:16,490
Should I stay out of that room today, too?

264
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:23,130
Yes, I'll clean it. Don't go in there.

265
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:31,200
Y-Y-You! What's that nonsense on your eyes?

266
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,800
You look like you got bruised, beaten by someone.

267
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:36,040
Honey, she's wearing Eskimo-makeup today.

268
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,320
It's called smokey makeup.

269
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,900
Erase it right now!

270
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:40,670
Quiet!

271
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:44,630
Don't mess with me.

272
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:49,890
I'm going to go spear someone down today.

273
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:52,440
What BS...

274
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,720
Good luck, my daughter!

275
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,180
Lee Su Ho!

276
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:27,270
 Ruin awaits those who are afraid. 

277
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:43,280
  I've already unsheathed the sword. 

278
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:48,050
  There is no retreating. 

279
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:59,410
If you spread any rumors about my bare face, I will...

280
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:11,220
What will you do?

281
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:19,100
 Ruin awaits those who are afraid? 

282
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:32,410
Not that I would do anything, but...

283
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:36,000
I'm begging you to not say anything.

284
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,570
Naturally handsome people like you might not understand, but this is more important than my life.

285
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:42,130
I'm begging you.

286
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:46,870
Must I? Me?  Why?

287
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:49,610
Why do I have to help you when you tricked me with your two faces?

288
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:52,210
Please!

289
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:55,690
Can't you look at it with a heart as wide as this playing field just this once?

290
00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:59,680
If you keep it a secret, I'll do whatever you tell me to do.

291
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:02,780
Stop and get up.

292
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:08,580
  Right. He's God Su Ho, one of the top two. 

293
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:12,980
  Please have mercy on me. 

294
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,700
♫   Hallelujah   ♫

295
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:20,300
You said you'll do anything I ask?

296
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,640
What is this?

297
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:58,630
Are you General Kim Yu Shin's horse or something?   (T/N: Legend says his horse took him to his lover's home by itself) 

298
00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:03,750
Why did you drive here by yourself?

299
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:06,130
Gosh.

300
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:24,630
Voila!

301
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,100
Do you need help?

302
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:40,720
No, I'm okay. I'm calling the insurance company.

303
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,730
How long will you have to wait, then? Aren't you busy?

304
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:09,920
What are you doing? Take out the tire.

305
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:13,220
Oh, right.

306
00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:26,950
Here's the tire... Sorry. Just a second.

307
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:36,140
I'm going crazy. Why is he so cute?

308
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:42,460
You've never changed a tire before?

309
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:45,690
Honestly, I don't drive often.

310
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:59,430
  Such strength from slim wrists. How sturdy. 

311
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:23,720
Because your eyes are precious. See you...

312
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:33,330
Hopefully he pities me and won’t spread any rumors.

313
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:38,640
Look at those merciless and tearless eyes.

314
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:13,750
Please have some of this while you work.

315
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:15,580
Thank you.

316
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:32,320
Okay.

317
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,650
Are you a teacher at this school?

318
00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:37,550
Yes. I teach literature here.

319
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:40,190
I had a feeling you wouldn't be a science teacher.

320
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:45,330
By the way, this car model is now discontinued. Are you a classic car lover?

321
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:49,230
No, that's not it.

322
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:52,480
This is the first car my dad bought in 1995.

323
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,800
We have many good memories with this car.

324
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:56,340
I'm afraid we'll lose the memories of this car if we dispose of it,

325
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:58,900
so I take it out on a drive now and then.

326
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:01,620
It just broke down out of nowhere.

327
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:04,080
This will become a memory as well, don't you think?

328
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,230
I don't agree with that.

329
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:10,470
- Pardon? 
- Rather than a memory, I'd like it to be a beginning.

330
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:13,080
A beginning rather than a memory?

331
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:16,760
That's a nice phrase.

332
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:22,800
- What kind of beginning?
- It's done now.

333
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:26,800
Thank you. Is there anything I could do to repay you?

334
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,970
If you're grateful, buy me dinner.

335
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:32,930
- Sorry? 
 - Give me your number.

336
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:36,550
Okay.

337
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:44,660
Here you go. Ouch. Static electricity.

338
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:49,330
Let's date if there's electricity once more between us.

339
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:51,820
Pardon?

340
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:57,540
Hello? Okay, I'll be there right away.

341
00:31:57,550 --> 00:31:59,180
What's your name?

342
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:00,810
It's Han Jun Woo.

343
00:32:00,810 --> 00:32:03,590
I'll be in touch with you, Mr. Han Jun Woo.

344
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:05,160
Got it.

345
00:32:07,770 --> 00:32:10,250
Think about that beginning.

346
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:18,960
It feels like I'm being bewitched...

347
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:31,760
The two important points about the economy in the early days of the Joseon Dynasty are the tax system and the land system.

348
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:37,860
During King Sejong's reign, there were two tax systems: nine levels of yield quality and six levels of land quality.

349
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:40,290
First, the way to determine the nine levels of yield quality is...

350
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:42,330
 Lee Su Ho:  I'm thirsty. 

351
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:47,860
What's wrong?

352
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:52,700
Ow... Teacher, can I go to the restroom?

353
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:54,240
Go.

354
00:32:58,130 --> 00:33:03,640
If you act like that during the Joseon period, you wouldn't be hearing the word "lady." But it's fine right now.

355
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:08,310
Let's go together. I also need to pee. I'll see you guys next time.

356
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:16,080
Move! Move!

357
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:26,410
You're thirsty, right? Here's the drink you like. Enjoy.

358
00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:28,640
Good luck in class today!

359
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:39,030
- Hey, raise it more. I can't see it. 
 - Like this? Is it better?

360
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:42,800
- No, no. I can't see it like that. 
 - Like this?

361
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:45,260
Helmet?

362
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:47,460
I'm sorry. Sorry.

363
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:52,840
Hey, where's my helmet?

364
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:58,610
Right, the helmet. It's been hectic so I forgot about it.

365
00:33:58,610 --> 00:34:00,930
You forgot?

366
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:03,740
You must have no fear.

367
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:06,110
I'm really sorry.

368
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:10,340
You think I'm easy because I'm not doing anything?

369
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:13,360
Easy? No way.

370
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:16,850
I'll bring it tomorrow, for sure.

371
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:20,830
If you don't bring it by tomorrow, be prepared.

372
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:23,540
Okay, I got it.

373
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:31,870
Oh~

374
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:33,790
Why are you acting so scary?

375
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:36,280
It's obvious she's trying to get your attention with the helmet.

376
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:39,680
She's trying to grab my attention by running away with my helmet? It's only making me angry though.

377
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:41,860
Why do you think the fairy stole the woodcutter's clothing?

378
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:44,740
She must have done it for the big picture.

379
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:47,250
Wait, but wasn't the woodcutter the one who stole from her? 
  (TN: In the folktale, the woodcutter stole the fairy's winged clothing) 

380
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:50,490
Ah! Which jerk...

381
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:53,230
It's this jerk, me.

382
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:55,920
Hi, Teacher.

383
00:34:55,920 --> 00:35:00,120
Button up! Button up! Did you come to a sauna?!

384
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:03,640
Ah, I'm sorry!

385
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:11,080
I'm sorry!

386
00:35:29,350 --> 00:35:31,500
 Mission complete. 

387
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:37,830
What's this? What are you smiling at?

388
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:41,140
- What about me? 
 - I just heard you laugh.

389
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:44,460
It's been a year since I heard you laugh last time. Do you see my goosebumps?

390
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:46,790
What are you looking at?

391
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:50,320
What are you looking at?

392
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:54,780
This is so frustrating. I'm going.

393
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,800
 From Father 

394
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:09,890
 We are having dinner with Teacher Choi. Come back early. 

395
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:13,760
 Yes, Father. 

396
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:21,260
Ah! What's with her?

397
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:24,010
Su Jin! Isn't Korean history so boring?

398
00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:27,430
I was about do some head banging, seriously.

399
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:47,650
Kang Su!

400
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,270
Kang Su.

401
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:54,200
Were you thinking of something else?

402
00:36:58,110 --> 00:37:01,680
No, there was just something on my hands.

403
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,350
It's not here.

404
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:14,460
Where is it?

405
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:17,240
How could that huge object just disappear?

406
00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:25,270
My daughter, I've ironed your skirt to have sharp edges. Don't cut your fingers on them.

407
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:30,600
Oh, thank you. Also, Dad, have you seen the helmet in my room?

408
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,890
Oh, that.

409
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:38,360
Im Ju Yeong.

410
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:40,640
Hey! You seriously!

411
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:44,400
Come over here. Why would you sell the helmet? Do you want to die?

412
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,900
What's the matter? You said you picked it up from the street.

413
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:47,630
Gosh!

414
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:50,350
Come here. Where did you sell the helmet?

415
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:53,510
I sold it on 'Heaven for Used Goods', why?

416
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:57,200
How dare you do that to your sister? Come right here!

417
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:00,220
- Hey, stop fighting. 
 - Hand it over!

418
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:03,850
- Bring it back! 
 - Are you crazy?

419
00:38:03,850 --> 00:38:05,860
I'm going to lose hair!

420
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:09,850
- Bring it to me! 
 - Stop moving!

421
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:17,360
How dare you little kiddos fight and pull at each other's hair in front of your parents?

422
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:20,220
- No, Mom he—  
 - You started it.

423
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:22,270
Hui Gyeong's father.

424
00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:25,460
- Bring it over. 
 - No, please.

425
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:29,730
- No, anything but that... 
 - Bring it right now!

426
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:46,320
- I love you. 
 - I love you.

427
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:53,880
- I love you. 
 - I love you.

428
00:38:54,770 --> 00:38:56,600
I'm here.

429
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:59,740
- I love you. 
 - I love you.

430
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:04,870
They must've fought again. Love each other well.

431
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:09,840
- I love you. 
 - I love you. Ah, that tickles! Do it properly!

432
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:12,290
I love you.

433
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:15,020
Did you not wash your feet?

434
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:17,020
I love you.

435
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:22,940
That helmet is Han Seo Jun's, so do whatever you can to bring it back.

436
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:24,690
Han Seo Jun?

437
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:26,840
Why are you telling me that now?

438
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,290
Ow!

439
00:39:28,290 --> 00:39:30,390
Hey.

440
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:33,060
Bring your foot here.

441
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:39,690
  - The Garden of Blood, volume 3. Playground in ten minutes.   
 - Ten minutes?

442
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:47,330
I love you, Ju Yeong. We made up, Mom. That's good enough, right?

443
00:39:47,330 --> 00:39:52,510
Hey! Im Ju Gyeong! Hey! That little...

444
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:55,970
- You can't rip books, okay? 
 - Okay.

445
00:39:55,970 --> 00:40:01,500
No! Can't you let me borrow this book first? Please?

446
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:36,990
 Ten minutes have passed. 

447
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:48,310
- Hey, cutie. 
 - What cutie?

448
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:51,150
- I'm too old to be called that. 
 - Sorry.

449
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:55,010
Hey, cool kid. Can you let me borrow this now?

450
00:40:55,010 --> 00:40:57,150
I'm not sure.

451
00:40:58,070 --> 00:41:02,580
- Hey, I bought you this ice cream! 
 - I said I'd think about it.

452
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:04,780
I'm thinking right now.

453
00:41:06,890 --> 00:41:09,040
This little kid, really...

454
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:12,400
Hey, look at you getting mad.

455
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:16,170
I felt bad for you, so I was going to let you borrow this.

456
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:20,190
- But I don't really want to since you're ruining my mood. 
 - Hey!

457
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:23,810
What should I do to make you feel better, cool kid?

458
00:41:23,810 --> 00:41:26,530
Do you want to laugh?

459
00:41:26,530 --> 00:41:30,780
That's not funny at all. That's such an old dance.

460
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:35,090
Then, should I pretend to be a zombie?  See this.

461
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:39,230
Wow.

462
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:43,470
Amazing. Do it again!

463
00:41:43,470 --> 00:41:48,340
One more time! One more time!

464
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:52,730
How do you do that?

465
00:41:53,830 --> 00:41:56,630
Do you have any other moves?

466
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:58,490
One more time.

467
00:41:58,490 --> 00:41:59,840
This...

468
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:03,420
You'll give it to me if I do it once more?

469
00:42:08,790 --> 00:42:10,580
You're late.

470
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:15,760
I'm sorry. I was arguing with an elementary schooler.

471
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:18,840
- That's good, right? I'm going! 
 - That—

472
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:32,580
How great is coming to school? This fresh air?

473
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:34,580
Hey, stop it.

474
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:38,560
Uh, I...

475
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:43,740
There's no way you folded up my helmet and brought it in your pocket.

476
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:47,660
I'm not able to say it out loud, so...

477
00:42:49,370 --> 00:42:52,930
Here. Read it after I leave, okay?

478
00:42:52,930 --> 00:42:58,010
- What's this? 
 - A confession letter! Han Seo Jun, look at you go!

479
00:42:58,010 --> 00:43:01,020
Yeah, look at him go!

480
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:03,860
- What is it? 
 - Don't look.

481
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:05,220
- Why? 
 - Don't look.

482
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:09,490
  In Ji Wi Deok. There is a saying, "With patience, comes virtue." 
 ( A 4 Chinese character saying. ) 

483
00:43:09,490 --> 00:43:12,690
  Keep this in your mind while you read this. 

484
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:17,610
  My younger brother sold your helmet on the site, 'Heaven for Used Goods'. I'm so sorry. 

485
00:43:17,610 --> 00:43:19,590
  I'll bring it to you within a week. 

486
00:43:19,590 --> 00:43:24,530
  So, please, hold in your anger and virtue will come to you. 

487
00:43:24,530 --> 00:43:26,960
  PS: Please don't hit me. 

488
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:29,580
Hey, what did she write? Let me read this confession letter.

489
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:31,440
Hey, what's there to read? It's obvious.

490
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:34,960
Why? I've never received one ever since I was born.

491
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,990
Let me just see it once.

492
00:43:36,990 --> 00:43:39,360
- Forget it. 
 - Show me the confession letter!

493
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:41,710
Show it! Hey!

494
00:43:41,710 --> 00:43:47,760
Read it! Read it! Read it! Read it!

495
00:43:57,410 --> 00:43:59,990
It's starting again today.

496
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:12,360
- Here, here! 
 - It's pork!

497
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:16,300
♫  You really drive me crazy  ♫

498
00:44:16,310 --> 00:44:18,600
  Lee Su Ho: Bring my earphones from the classroom. 

499
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:25,590
♫  Even though I'm busy all day, when I have some time free, I wonder about you  ♫

500
00:44:25,590 --> 00:44:27,700
  Did you just leave me on read? 

501
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:31,210
  Want some pork? 

502
00:44:35,210 --> 00:44:38,090
Where are you going?

503
00:44:38,090 --> 00:44:40,630
Oh, hey.

504
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:46,730
Hey, Im Ju Yeong. Did you get the helmet back?

505
00:44:46,730 --> 00:44:49,390
I'm going to. Just wait a bit, geez.

506
00:44:49,390 --> 00:44:52,330
Hey, what's with your attitude?

507
00:44:52,330 --> 00:44:54,590
You must be crazy.

508
00:44:56,270 --> 00:45:00,270
♫  Call me maybe, you  ♫

509
00:45:00,270 --> 00:45:01,440

♫  You and I are leaving tonight  ♫

517
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,520
- We're going straight. 
 - Straight.

518
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:24,530
- There are no stoplights here. 
 - None.

519
00:45:24,530 --> 00:45:27,590
Shining sunshine, swag, swag.

520
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:32,100
Stop!

521
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:34,690
What's with that? Why isn't your boyfriend eating again?

522
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:37,200
Oh, he's practicing for an audition for a talent show at the festival.

523
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:40,770
They're only selecting five teams because there are too many applicants.

524
00:45:40,770 --> 00:45:45,530
Hey, Ju Gyeong. You look so lifeless. Did something bad happen?

525
00:45:45,530 --> 00:45:48,260
Oh, no. Nothing happened.

526
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:50,430
She must be hungry.

527
00:45:51,310 --> 00:45:53,390
Wait. I have to go somewhere.

528
00:45:53,390 --> 00:45:57,680
- Im Ju! What about lunch? 
 - What was that?

529
00:45:58,430 --> 00:46:01,200
She's a bit weird lately, don't you think?

530
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:07,690
- Hey, helmet. 
 - I said I'd give it, okay?! I wrote you the letter!

531
00:46:07,690 --> 00:46:09,460
What?

532
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:18,630
I'm very sorry. My words were harsh, right?

533
00:46:18,630 --> 00:46:23,030
Just wait a bit, and I'll give it to you. I'm sorry.

534
00:46:26,430 --> 00:46:28,440
What's with her?

535
00:46:31,130 --> 00:46:34,460
Pass it. Okay, once more.

536
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:37,910
Hey, Han Seo Jun, are you a gangster?

537
00:46:37,910 --> 00:46:40,570
During the first semester, you always made the class atmosphere so brutal.

538
00:46:40,570 --> 00:46:43,950
Now you're trying to extort a girl who just transferred here?

539
00:46:43,950 --> 00:46:47,210
You walk around with these minions, trying to act like bullies,

540
00:46:47,210 --> 00:46:50,210
but they look insignificant to me, just like anchovy poop.

541
00:46:50,210 --> 00:46:52,720
If I see you guys trying to bother others again,

542
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:55,700
I'm reporting you guys to the school and you'll be embarrassed to show your face here again.

543
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:58,100
Do you understand, you anchovy poop-like people?

544
00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:00,780
- A-Anchovy? 
 - I'm bulking up right now!

545
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:02,180
What did she say?

546
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:05,060
- She said we're anchovy poop. 
 - What poop?

547
00:47:06,430 --> 00:47:09,700
Wow. She's so cool.

548
00:47:18,570 --> 00:47:21,870
What do you want me to do? Clean this?

549
00:47:21,870 --> 00:47:23,650
Eat it.

550
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:26,740
You want me to eat it? Really?

551
00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:29,070
- What's the occasion? 
 - Getting rid of leftovers.

552
00:47:29,070 --> 00:47:32,500
- I'm always throwing away my leftovers. 
 - I see.

553
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:35,880
I thought you were trying to feed me good food for doing so much.

554
00:47:37,790 --> 00:47:40,040
Oh, it's good!

555
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:42,250
- No way. 
 - It's really good.

556
00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:44,570
Why do you always throw away these great leftovers?

557
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:48,150
- No way. 
 - It's so good.

558
00:47:48,150 --> 00:47:50,450
Let me mix this up.

559
00:47:54,490 --> 00:47:57,300
- You're going this far? 
 - I guess you don't understand.

560
00:47:57,300 --> 00:48:00,280
This is the best way to get rid of leftovers.

561
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:07,740
Eat up lots.

562
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:10,180
- Why? You're not eating? 
 - No.

563
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:11,920
You haven't eaten it like this, right?

564
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,500
Although there may be people who've never tried this, there's no one who's only tried it once.

565
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:17,200
Here, try it.

566
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:19,060
You can have it.

567
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:27,740
Amazing! It's so good.

568
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:35,020
Try it, I said. How could I eat all of these by myself?

569
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:37,590
Here, try it.

570
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:55,640
How is it?

571
00:48:57,940 --> 00:48:59,300
It's weird.

572
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:01,140
It's weird?

573
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:04,790
It's tasty to me.

574
00:49:04,790 --> 00:49:07,040
I'm saying it's weird because it's tasty.

575
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,150
I mixed it well, right?

576
00:49:14,150 --> 00:49:16,680
Don't spit it out of your nose today.

577
00:49:18,990 --> 00:49:21,590
Eat it with the japchae.
  (TN: glass noodle stir fry) 

578
00:49:38,890 --> 00:49:43,850
You know... How are you feeling right now?

579
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:47,950
Good or bad?

580
00:49:47,950 --> 00:49:49,160
Why are you asking that?

581
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:53,340
Just because. Good or bad?

582
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:03,980
You know... let's call it even with one big one.

583
00:50:03,980 --> 00:50:04,820
What are you talking about?

584
00:50:04,820 --> 00:50:07,850
Of course, I did say that I'll do everything that you order me to.

585
00:50:07,850 --> 00:50:12,520
I thought about it, and ordering me around to do these petty little errands is too tacky for someone as smart and popular as you.

586
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:14,600
And it's not like you're going to order me around forever.

587
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:18,660
Because then that means you'll be involved with me forever, and that's going to be a lifetime of stress for you.

588
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:21,260
So that's why you want to call it even with one big one?

589
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:22,960
Exactly.

590
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:28,000
Well, making me track down the first edition of a classic horror or some difficult mission—

591
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,700
Must I?  I don't want to.

592
00:50:31,510 --> 00:50:34,930
Don't be like that and think about it one more time.

593
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:40,720
Fine, let's call it even then.

594
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:42,880
Call it even, really?

595
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:45,650
What shall I do for you? What do I need to do?

596
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,430
Why are you tapping on the table instead of telling me what you want me to do?

00:53:43,030 --> 00:53:46,920
What? It didn't already end, right?

634
00:54:20,470 --> 00:54:24,200
♫  La li la li la, la li la li la  ♫

635
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:27,230
♫  La li la li la, la la li la li la  ♫

636
00:54:27,230 --> 00:54:31,000
♫  I've been criticized so much, I have indigestion  ♫

637
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:34,700
♫  But even if I'm upset, what can I do? I do?   ♫

638
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:38,890
♫  Everyone's trying so hard to hate me  ♫

639
00:54:38,890 --> 00:54:42,900
♫  If they break me down, does it feed them?  ♫

640
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:46,890
♫  Because I'm lonely, what do I do? I swallowed the hate.  ♫

641
00:54:46,890 --> 00:54:50,250
♫  I don't have the strength to get mad. Nor the leisure.  ♫

642
00:54:50,250 --> 00:54:54,020
♫  What's so offensive? Just go on your way.  ♫

Please pick Im Ju Gyeong from second year class five!

651
00:55:34,100 --> 00:55:37,450
Storing you in my heart~!

652
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:40,490
Delete.

653
00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:49,350
Principal, I have deleted it right away.

654
00:55:49,350 --> 00:55:53,680
Yes. Ju Gyeong is really good at dancing.

655
00:55:54,630 --> 00:55:56,480
I mean...

656
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:59,760
look at the results from our last mock exam!

657
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:03,710
At this rate, how many do you think we're going to be able to send off to a university in Seoul?!

658
00:56:03,710 --> 00:56:05,890
Please reflect on that!

659
00:56:05,890 --> 00:56:08,040
Please reflect on that!

660
00:56:10,550 --> 00:56:13,110
I-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

661
00:56:13,110 --> 00:56:15,300
- Teacher Choi. 
 - Yes?

662
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:18,260
The grades should be going up when you've undertaken a task!

663
00:56:18,260 --> 00:56:21,100
Work harder! Work harder!

664
00:56:24,890 --> 00:56:28,130
I'm so embarrassed!

665
00:57:07,550 --> 00:57:10,510
It's not long before I will be discharged. Why did you come?

666
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:13,490
Even if it's for a short time, I should still see you.

667
00:57:13,490 --> 00:57:15,230
How was your condition today?

668
00:57:15,230 --> 00:57:17,030
It was good.

669
00:57:17,030 --> 00:57:19,450
How does it feel going back to school?

670
00:57:19,450 --> 00:57:21,210
It's the same.

671
00:57:21,210 --> 00:57:24,590
It's nice seeing my son in his uniform.

672
00:57:24,590 --> 00:57:26,680
Well, I make clothes look good!

673
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:30,070
Even in a straw mat, I look like a model.

674
00:57:30,070 --> 00:57:34,860
I don't know who the mom is, but she sure has an amazing son!

675
00:57:36,460 --> 00:57:39,090
I'm going to sleep now, so you should go.

676
00:57:39,090 --> 00:57:41,130
Let me see you sleep.

677
00:57:41,130 --> 00:57:46,840
I can't sleep if you're here, and you shouldn't leave Go Woon by herself.

678
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:49,240
I understand. Sleep then.

679
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:52,180
You didn't come here riding your motorbike, right?

680
00:57:52,180 --> 00:57:54,610
It's dangerous, so don't ride it around.

681
00:57:54,610 --> 00:57:56,900
Don't worry.

682
00:58:10,060 --> 00:58:11,430
It's Lee Ju Heon.  Lee Ju Heon.

683
00:58:11,430 --> 00:58:14,100
Let's take a picture.

684
00:58:14,100 --> 00:58:16,370
- I'm such a huge fan of yours! 
 - Could we take a picture with you?

685
00:58:16,370 --> 00:58:18,130
This isn't a good time for you to be like this.

686
00:58:18,130 --> 00:58:20,500
- It's okay. 
 - Thank you.

687
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:22,470
One, two, three.

688
00:58:22,470 --> 00:58:25,130
Thank you!

689
00:58:25,130 --> 00:58:28,650
We're very grateful that you support us.

690
00:58:28,650 --> 00:58:30,860
Oh, please don't mention it.

691
00:58:38,820 --> 00:58:42,100
  Understanding Aromas 

692
00:58:49,060 --> 00:58:55,350
Understanding Aromas?

693
00:58:55,350 --> 00:58:59,600
I'm going to learn how to make aromatic candles at the Culture Center.

694
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:00,660
You're going to the Culture Center?

695
00:59:00,660 --> 00:59:05,070
Culture Center? With what money did you enter with?

696
00:59:06,940 --> 00:59:09,270
Did you steal money from my wallet?

697
00:59:09,270 --> 00:59:13,510
Honey, what are you saying in front of the kids?

698
00:59:13,510 --> 00:59:15,470
I'm borrowing it.

699
00:59:15,470 --> 00:59:18,910
No wonder. Money kept on disappearing from my wallet.

700
00:59:18,910 --> 00:59:22,300
So what if the kids hear? Do you even know that it's embarrassing?

701
00:59:23,020 --> 00:59:27,890
Before you understand aromas, why don't you understand your wife's feelings?!

702
00:59:27,890 --> 00:59:30,120
What hobby when you're unemployed?!

703
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:34,400
It's not a hobby, but instead an effort in trying to make a living.

704
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:36,690
Don't make a living and instead cook food at home!

705
00:59:36,690 --> 00:59:40,220
Mom, it's even hard to just stay still at home.

706
00:59:40,220 --> 00:59:43,090
You don't know if the aromatic candles will be successful.

707
00:59:43,090 --> 00:59:44,470
Dad, work hard!

708
00:59:44,470 --> 00:59:48,900
Right, Hui Gyeong. The amazing thing about aromatic candles the more you learn about them is that

709
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:53,100
no less than 5,000 BC, in Afghanistan...

710
00:59:53,100 --> 00:59:55,060
No, no. It's Pakistan.

711
00:59:55,060 --> 00:59:58,230
- Is that right? 
 - Yeah, it's Pakistan.

712
00:59:59,550 --> 01:00:02,400
For falling for this face completely and marrying you right away,

713
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:04,310
I'm the idiot. I am!

714
01:00:04,310 --> 01:00:06,900
- You've always been about looks though. 
 - What?

715
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:08,210
I'm home.

716
01:00:08,210 --> 01:00:09,930
You came, my daughter?

717
01:00:09,930 --> 01:00:12,300
- You came a bit late today. 
 - Yeah, I...

718
01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:16,650
You! You were out buying up tons of makeup again, weren't you! You think I didn't know?

719
01:00:16,650 --> 01:00:18,700
No, it's not like that. It's because I missed the bus.

720
01:00:18,700 --> 01:00:22,630
Look at you! Running around with all that makeup caked on your face...

721
01:00:22,630 --> 01:00:25,260
When you'll get plenty of chances to wear makeup when you go to college,

722
01:00:25,260 --> 01:00:27,390
why are you in such a hurry to cake it on like that?!

723
01:00:27,390 --> 01:00:31,120
During that time, you should look at one more English word.

724
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:35,420
These days, even kids who are younger than Ju Gyeong are all wearing makeup.

725
01:00:35,420 --> 01:00:38,490
They're not good at studying! Try and go to society later!

726
01:00:38,490 --> 01:00:40,430
It's all about ability! Ability!

727
01:00:40,430 --> 01:00:45,090
Try and go to school, Mom. It's all about the face.

728
01:00:45,090 --> 01:00:49,540
Who cares if you look good with makeup on when your bare face is a dud?!

729
01:00:49,540 --> 01:00:53,480
If you, with that face, don't have the ability, how are you going to marry?

730
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:56,120
- Honey. 
 - She's being brutal with facts!

731
01:00:56,120 --> 01:00:58,730
Mom, that's not it!

732
01:00:58,730 --> 01:01:02,600
Even porcupines think their babies are cute. Mom, you're seriously...

733
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:05,460
Where are you going when I'm talking to you? Come here!

734
01:01:05,460 --> 01:01:07,540
Madam Hong, Madam Hong, come on.

735
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:14,110
  Warning: Do Not Enter 

736
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:17,040
What?

737
01:01:21,100 --> 01:01:22,700
Here.

738
01:01:24,090 --> 01:01:26,050
I paid ₩20,000 more to get it back.

739
01:01:26,050 --> 01:01:28,120
So what?

740
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:30,990
Who told you to sell it without asking?

741
01:01:33,810 --> 01:01:36,790
  Warning: Do Not Enter 

742
01:01:48,970 --> 01:01:52,050
Wow, you're so popular.

743
01:01:52,050 --> 01:01:55,510
320 people gave you a like.

744
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:00,470
I got surprised.

745
01:02:01,530 --> 01:02:06,720
Yeah, even I think I look ugly.

746
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:10,090
I probably look the same in my mom's eyes.

747
01:02:11,110 --> 01:02:14,080
I'm doing it! I said I'm pushing it!

748
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:15,620
Guys! This is mine.

749
01:02:15,620 --> 01:02:17,750
I'll give you a bite, so give me a bite too.

750
01:02:17,750 --> 01:02:19,710
It's fine.

751
01:02:23,340 --> 01:02:25,270
Wow!

752
01:02:27,020 --> 01:02:28,660
Wow!

753
01:02:28,660 --> 01:02:32,680
Wow?

754
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:42,090
 Newstagram: love_ssam2 likes your photo 

755
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:47,620
One more pressed it. Someone who likes you.

756
01:02:50,370 --> 01:02:52,940
If I upload my bare face,

757
01:02:52,940 --> 01:02:56,010
everyone will say they hate it.

758
01:03:00,950 --> 01:03:02,170
 The Garden of Blood, volumes 4 and 5. 

759
01:03:02,170 --> 01:03:04,530
 Playground in ten minutes. 

760
01:03:06,310 --> 01:03:09,740
He's really not giving me a break.

761
01:03:15,130 --> 01:03:19,830
 Prince Comics 

762
01:03:45,490 --> 01:03:47,720
Are you okay?

763
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:50,380
- Where are you putting your eyes? 
 - I'm sorry.

764
01:03:50,380 --> 01:03:52,950
- Do you know how much this costs? 
 - I'm sorry.

765
01:03:52,950 --> 01:03:55,400
Looking like crap.

766
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:59,200
So why are you going around at night and becoming a nuisance to others?

767
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:01,180
I'm sorry.

768
01:04:01,180 --> 01:04:03,430
Hold back.

769
01:04:03,430 --> 01:04:07,070
Look at her eyes. Does she look like she can see what's in front of her?

770
01:04:07,070 --> 01:04:09,920
What rotten luck to bump into someone like her!

771
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:13,070
Your whole face is just a mess!

772
01:04:13,070 --> 01:04:16,560
There's nothing good about your face.

773
01:04:16,560 --> 01:04:21,540
Ahjumma, just lower your head and go home with that face of yours.

774
01:04:21,540 --> 01:04:23,550
Or cover it when you go out.

775
01:04:23,550 --> 01:04:25,200
-  Should I give her my shirt? 
 - Why would you?

776
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:27,420
- Should I give her mine? 
 - No way!

777
01:04:27,420 --> 01:04:29,970
Seriously, you make me feel fear for my life!

778
01:04:29,970 --> 01:04:33,950
Ahjumma, don't make me lose my appetite. Just go!

779
01:04:33,950 --> 01:04:36,710
Bye!

780
01:04:43,660 --> 01:04:47,450
  - Her face is a mess, but she has so much  confidence. 
 - She has the worst face at our school. 

781
01:04:47,450 --> 01:04:50,790
  - Why does she live?
- If your face is lacking, you should at least have some sense to make up for it. 

782
01:04:50,790 --> 01:04:52,660
 - Can you not even see where you stand? 
 - Should I educate you? 

783
01:04:52,660 --> 01:04:56,260
 Because. You're. Ugly. 

784
01:05:16,190 --> 01:05:19,210
- You... 
 - Here.

785
01:05:19,210 --> 01:05:21,500
It's raining, but you don't have an umbrella?

786
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:26,600
Why? You want me to buy an umbrella?

787
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:28,560
- Okay. 
 - That's not what I'm saying.

788
01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:32,580
What do you mean it's not?  After you called me out at every chance and ordered me around?

789
01:05:32,580 --> 01:05:34,330
Aren't you being too much?

790
01:05:34,330 --> 01:05:36,530
I know I told you I'd do everything that you order me to,

791
01:05:36,530 --> 01:05:40,360
but was it fun using my weakness to make me go around here and there?

792
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:44,750
What's the difference between you and those who made me a loner and a dumpling shuttle?

793
01:05:45,660 --> 01:05:51,350
It's not my fault that I'm ugly, so why is everyone hating on me?

794
01:05:52,950 --> 01:05:55,260
What's the point of looking pretty with makeup?

795
01:05:55,260 --> 01:05:58,730
I'm still the ugly Im Ju Gyeong,

796
01:05:58,730 --> 01:06:01,160
and as soon as I transferred, I got caught by someone like you,

797
01:06:01,160 --> 01:06:04,380
and I'm afraid of rumors being made, so I can't even sleep well at night.

798
01:06:04,380 --> 01:06:07,560
Just running around doing these kinds of errands...

799
01:06:07,560 --> 01:06:09,650
Do you know how I feel?

800
01:06:09,650 --> 01:06:12,850
Do you not have a secret that you want to hide?

801
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:22,760
You really shouldn't play around with someone's pain.

802
01:06:53,190 --> 01:06:55,430
Stay here for a bit.

803
01:07:40,610 --> 01:07:42,440
Im Ju Gyeong.

804
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:46,060
Im Ju Gyeong. Im Ju Gyeong!

805
01:07:46,060 --> 01:07:47,970
Im Ju Gyeong!

806
01:08:09,770 --> 01:08:12,590
I thought you left.

807
01:08:12,590 --> 01:08:16,570
I was just embarrassed.

808
01:08:18,990 --> 01:08:22,630
Earlier, I wasn't in the right mind...

809
01:08:29,900 --> 01:08:32,100
I'm okay.

810
01:08:50,480 --> 01:08:53,530
 I don't think I can show my face at school if the rumors get around. 

811
01:08:53,530 --> 01:08:55,820
 This is more important than my life. 

812
01:08:55,820 --> 01:08:57,630
 I'm begging you. 

813
01:08:57,630 --> 01:09:02,150
  You really shouldn't play around with someone's pain. 

814
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:18,940
Sorry.

815
01:09:22,260 --> 01:09:24,100
I'm sorry.

816
01:10:26,710 --> 01:10:29,600
Hey, Lee Su Ho.

817
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:34,730
After killing a friend, you must be happy.

818
01:11:05,490 --> 01:11:08,480
Excuse me, is it because of the helmet?

819
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:13,480
No. I want to eat with you.

820
01:11:19,860 --> 01:11:21,880
Han Seo Jun!

821
01:11:32,420 --> 01:11:35,530
This bastard, really.

822
01:11:49,260 --> 01:11:56,240


823
01:11:56,240 --> 01:11:58,490
♫  Yeah, yeah  ♫

824
01:11:58,490 --> 01:12:04,280
♫  I'm in the mood for dancing, romancin'  ♫

825
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:07,680
♫  Ooh, I'm givin' it all tonight  ♫

826
01:12:07,680 --> 01:12:11,310
♫  I'm in the mood for chancin'  ♫

827
01:12:11,310 --> 01:12:13,490
♫  I feel like dancin'  ♫

828
01:12:13,490 --> 01:12:17,540
♫  Ooh, so come on and hold me tight  ♫

829
01:12:17,540 --> 01:12:20,420
 True Beauty 

830
01:12:20,420 --> 01:12:23,560
 I don't know what's going on, 

831
01:12:23,560 --> 01:12:29,380
 but if you need someone to talk to, I'll lend an ear. 

832
01:12:29,380 --> 01:12:31,400
 Do you like Im Ju Gyeong? 

833
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:34,070
 I heard you got confessions from both Lee Su Ho and Han Seo Jun. 

834
01:12:34,070 --> 01:12:36,220
 Who are you going to select between the two? 

835
01:12:36,220 --> 01:12:37,220
 Don't look around. 

836
01:12:37,220 --> 01:12:38,800
 Come here for a bit! 

837
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:42,830
 Should I just meet him rather than suffer from rumors? 

838
01:12:42,830 --> 01:12:45,240
 I have something to say. 

839
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:47,760
 My heart isn't ready yet. 

840
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:50,080
♫  Yeah let's dance  ♫

841
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:53,060
♫  Come on and dance  ♫
