1
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,035
I don't like Su-jin.

2
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:38,455
The person I like…

3
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:41,458
is you.

4
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:08,818
BASED ON WEBTOON TRUE BEAUTY
BY YAONGYI

5
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:24,876
Ju-kyung.

6
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:31,966
Why are you running away?

7
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:36,262
I don't know, it just happened.

8
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:38,097
But…

9
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:40,725
it's really me?

10
00:01:41,392 --> 00:01:42,227
Yes.

11
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:43,603
It's you.

12
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,647
That doesn't make sense.

13
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:48,691
You're joking, right?

14
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,819
Is this a hidden camera prank?
Is everyone hiding somewhere?

15
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:52,737
Or are you pity liking me?

16
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:54,447
Or maybe I'm dreaming?

17
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:55,406
It's none of those.

18
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:56,908
Then…

19
00:01:58,326 --> 00:02:00,036
you really like…

20
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:02,413
Am I not allowed to?

21
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:11,840
Goodness.

22
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:15,176
I'm so nervous…

23
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:18,429
I can't even speak.

24
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:25,854
I'm nervous too.

25
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:32,485
I was going to tell you
while giving you this.

26
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:41,327
Look.

27
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:44,080
I got all the steps mixed up.

28
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:58,094
So what about you?

29
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:00,638
Sorry?

30
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:10,064
I'm nervous and I have butterflies.
What do you think that means?

31
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:12,650
-What does it mean?
-It means I really like you.

32
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:14,444
I like you. I like you a lot.

33
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,779
I dream about you
and I've thought about you all day.

34
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:19,324
I'm super lazy,
but I've been waking up before my alarm

35
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:20,575
to go to school early and see you.

36
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:22,118
And when I see you, my heart…

37
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:31,878
Anyway,

38
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:35,632
that's my answer.

39
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:45,183
Lim Ju-kyung.

40
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,608
I still can't believe it.

41
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,986
I'm not dreaming, am I?

42
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:01,074
It hurts.

43
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:08,206
Su-jin!

44
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:10,583
Who is that?

45
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,461
What do you mean? It's Ju-kyung!

46
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,973
Right, I don't have makeup on.

47
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:34,190
Ju-kyung.

48
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:43,157
But why do you
go to such lengths to hide it?

49
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:46,744
Once…

50
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:51,040
I asked the kids who bullied me.

51
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:54,502
About why they hated me so much.

52
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:59,382
Because you are ugly.

53
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:02,385
They said it's because I'm ugly.

54
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:07,849
They simply didn't like my face.

55
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:11,352
But once I put makeup on,

56
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:16,190
kids looked at me differently.

57
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:20,653
They even talk to me first,

58
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:23,364
and I could make friends easily.

59
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,869
That's when I thought,

60
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,622
I could never

61
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:35,043
take this mask off.

62
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:39,797
It must have been difficult for you,
always worrying about people finding out.

63
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:43,342
If they find out about my bare face,

64
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:48,097
I'm so scared that they'll curse at me
and turn on me.

65
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:53,144
I'm really lame, aren't I?

66
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,901
The ones who made you feel this way
are way lamer.

67
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:02,278
Don't you ever think that way again,
got it?

68
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:07,241
You said you don't want
the others to find out.

69
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,452
How do we get you inside?

70
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:14,499
Get up.

71
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:16,375
What?

72
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:21,255
Get in.

73
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:28,304
Let's go.

74
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:30,431
Let's go!

75
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:31,974
-We're going in like this?
-Yes.

76
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:55,414
I really went back and forth
between heaven and hell.

77
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:01,254
I'm grateful it was Su-jin at any rate.

78
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:09,011
LEE SOO-HO

79
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:10,054
Good night.

80
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:18,104
LIM JU-KYUNG

81
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:19,397
My finger slipped.

82
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:31,909
You too.

83
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:24,170
-What's up with Lee Soo-ho?
-Did he just smile?

84
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:26,130
I've never seen him smile before.

85
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:28,132
He's so handsome.

86
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,554
On average…

87
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:37,683
Throw it away.

88
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:42,230
Since when do we exchange drinks?

89
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:43,981
Throw it away. Did you not hear me?

90
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:49,862
That was rude.

91
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:50,863
What is it?

92
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:54,492
Doesn't she know
how expensive strawberries are?

93
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:55,952
Have you not told her yet?

94
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,454
You're killing me.

95
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:04,502
Man.

96
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:08,714
Seo-jun, aren't you going back
to your classroom?

97
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:11,384
-No, I'm not.
-I see.

98
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:13,219
Then where should I sit?

99
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:16,681
-Hurry up and go!
-I don't want to. You go.

100
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:19,058
Hey, I can't change my class on a whim.

101
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:20,893
-Come on. Get up.
-Right.

102
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:23,437
Won't you help me? Come on!

103
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:25,731
That's right.

104
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:28,317
Let's go to the sauna
after studying this weekend.

105
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:29,277
What do you say?

106
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:30,861
The sauna?

107
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:33,698
I don't really want to.

108
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:36,450
Come on, let's go. It'll be fun, right?

109
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:37,702
Let's go together.

110
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:39,620
Well, I…

111
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:45,251
The sauna? No thanks. I hate getting hot.

112
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:47,503
Fine, then. Jeez.

113
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,639
What's that?

114
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:00,725
He always eats alone.

115
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:02,435
Is he close with her?

116
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:05,771
He's having lunch with Ju-kyung?

117
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:08,983
There goes my appetite!

118
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,527
Hey, you only had one bite.

119
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,195
Maybe she's on a diet.

120
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,197
That traitor.
She's trying to get even prettier.

121
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:18,618
She's downright avoiding you, isn't she?

122
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:21,537
She must know you like her
and is giving you the cold shoulder.

123
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:26,292
Savior Soo-ho has already been rejected
before he confesses.

124
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:33,090
Ju-kyung? What happened?

125
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:34,133
TRULY, YOU'RE SO ANNOYING

126
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:35,092
"So annoying."

127
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:37,303
"A butthead."

128
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:39,930
Poor bastard.

129
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:43,976
This one is my favorite,
but you can have it.

130
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,854
TRASH INCINERATION AREA

131
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:52,276
-Gosh, it's Soo-ho.
-He's so tall.

132
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,028
-He's so handsome
-Seriously.

133
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:02,411
Get down.

134
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:07,625
Do we really have to do this?

135
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,585
-Of course.
-Why?

136
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:11,796
What do you mean why?

137
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:13,422
Haven't you heard?

138
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:16,926
After you said you liked someone,
even if a girl brushed shoulders with you,

139
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:19,553
the delinquents who like you
drag them to the rooftop.

140
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:24,016
If word gets out that I'm dating you…

141
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:28,270
Hey.

142
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:33,901
Are you the girl who flirted with Soo-ho?

143
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:34,819
What?

144
00:11:35,694 --> 00:11:37,571
No. It wasn't me.

145
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:39,615
Look at her shaking her tail like a fox.

146
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:44,161
Grab that fox!

147
00:11:45,704 --> 00:11:48,499
No, I didn't flirt with him!

148
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,257
How does that make sense?

149
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:01,262
-It makes perfect sense.
-So you want to keep this up?

150
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:02,346
Well,

151
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:05,057
I'm going to tell Su-jin and Su-ah,
of course.

152
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:07,977
I just feel a bit shy.

153
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:13,149
How do I tell them that you're…

154
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:16,402
my boyfriend?

155
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:18,654
But I am your boyfriend.

156
00:12:19,738 --> 00:12:20,948
It's weird.

157
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:24,118
That word doesn't sound right to me.

158
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:38,174
You know one-on-one counseling
starts next week, right?

159
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:40,009
-Yes.
-Yes.

160
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:46,640
CAREER INTEREST SURVEY

161
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:02,490
It's almost a spy operation.

162
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:08,579
No one from our school is around, right?

163
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:12,708
We're an hour away from school.
No one would come here.

164
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:13,709
But still.

165
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:16,670
Thank you for coming.

166
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:20,549
Welcome! Please follow me.

167
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,551
Would you mind a table in an open area?

168
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:25,429
Somewhere not visible
to security cameras or onlookers.

169
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:27,056
A secretive, hidden spot, please.

170
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:29,558
Okay.

171
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:30,684
Then come this way.

172
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:34,730
Those young kids are already so demanding.

173
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:39,902
Please take your time with your menu
and let me know.

174
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:43,113
Can we get the couple's set?

175
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:46,200
You know, the menu only for couples?
That one, please.

176
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:48,160
We're a couple, you see.

177
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:49,578
All right.

178
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,872
A couple's set? Got it.

179
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:55,209
A couple.

180
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:00,631
We can act like a couple
now that no one's around.

181
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:02,466
You won't even let me
talk to you at school.

182
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,260
It doesn't feel like we're dating.

183
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:06,011
It feels like we are to me.

184
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:08,514
It really hit me when I changed this.

185
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:10,391
What name do you have me saved as?

186
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:12,476
-In mine--
-Lim Ju-kyung.

187
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:15,604
-That's my name.
-Yes.

188
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:18,274
-What about it?
-Well…

189
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,276
My name…

190
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:23,320
is pretty.

191
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:26,407
BOYFRIEND

192
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,370
Enjoy.

193
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:44,925
Do they only give one fork
for a couple's set?

194
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:46,093
Why is that?

195
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:51,807
Open up.

196
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:53,267
You're so cute.

197
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:55,352
To do that.

198
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:01,442
Let's eat.

199
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:02,943
Okay.

200
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:10,910
Here.

201
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:19,752
I'm sorry! I forgot your…

202
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:24,882
Enjoy.

203
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:39,271
What?

204
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:41,023
Ju-kyung?

205
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:43,776
What?

206
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:45,027
Get down!

207
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:51,283
Hyun-kyu, what brought you this far out?

208
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:52,534
This place is famous.

209
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:54,286
-We come to places like this.
-Right.

210
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:56,372
What brought you out here and with whom?

211
00:15:57,831 --> 00:15:59,875
I came here alone.

212
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,627
You came here alone

213
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,045
and ordered a couple's set?

214
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:04,213
It was a decent set.

215
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,548
-She is right about that.
-That's right.

216
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:08,759
I see.
I guess you can eat more than I thought.

217
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:09,718
Enjoy your meal.

218
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:13,013
-Halt.
-No!

219
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:13,973
Excuse me, sir.

220
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:15,182
-Hey.
-What?

221
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:17,643
Let's protect her privacy.

222
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:19,436
-Okay.
-You're quite the gentleman.

223
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,147
Well, I guess your boyfriend is quite shy?

224
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:23,482
What do you mean by boyfriend?

225
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:24,900
Do you want me to lift it up?

226
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:28,404
It was nice meeting you,
Ju-kyung's boyfriend.

227
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:31,323
Next time, let's talk face-to-face.

228
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:36,537
Well, enjoy your date with your boyfriend.

229
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,872
-Go, Ju-kyung!
-Go, Ju-kyung!

230
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,268
Well, that was too close.

231
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:00,853
An hour away is still dangerous.

232
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:03,689
We could run into our classmates again,
so I'll be off first.

233
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:10,529
I brought you here to show you something.

234
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:12,281
Let's see it, then leave.

235
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:15,034
Aren't you…

236
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:17,369
a fan of hers?

237
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:22,207
It's Selena!

238
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,669
What do I do?

239
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:32,551
For makeup on acne-prone skin,
you all use high-coverage products, right?

240
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:33,761
-Yes.
-That's right.

241
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:37,514
However, gentle products
like this tone-up cream

242
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:40,017
work much better to cover skin irritation.

243
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:40,934
Don't forget it.

244
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:42,561
She's awesome.

245
00:17:42,644 --> 00:17:46,565
Okay, here's a question for you.
I have giveaways, so please pay attention.

246
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:48,650
While prepping your face
before foundation,

247
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:52,404
this product can help you apply
the foundation evenly without concealer.

248
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:54,156
What is this product?

249
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:55,824
Me!

250
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,993
Over there, you in the brown jacket.

251
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:58,911
A primer.

252
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,247
A primer? A primer.

253
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:03,832
That is correct!

254
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:09,088
The person who got the answer,
come up and claim your prize.

255
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:12,758
-I'm so jealous.
-What's that?

256
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:18,514
I got this!

257
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:27,022
Excuse me…

258
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:29,983
I'm your biggest fan.

259
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:31,652
Could I get your autograph?

260
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:32,903
To remember this by?

261
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:34,196
Wait a moment. Here it is.

262
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:38,158
It's a long story,
but you gave me a whole new life.

263
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:39,618
My friends say I'm good at makeup,

264
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:41,787
and I learned it all
from watching your videos.

265
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:43,580
Thank you.

266
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:49,294
It sucks.

267
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:50,963
Excuse me?

268
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:53,382
I said, it sucks.

269
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,885
If you learned makeup from my videos,

270
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:59,304
how could you pick this shade
for your lips?

271
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:03,225
Different intensities feel distinct,
even if they're all the same warm tone.

272
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:07,729
A subtle difference in the shade
can ruin the balance of a whole look.

273
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:14,903
Here, how does that look?

274
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:17,990
If you're not going to do it right,

275
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:20,826
don't say you learned makeup from me.

276
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:25,998
Thank you. I'll try to do better.

277
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:31,879
But still, you are doing better
than when I first started.

278
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:34,423
Don't get discouraged and keep on trying.

279
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:57,654
Are you that happy?

280
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:59,448
Yes, I'm so happy.

281
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:02,701
I couldn't tell the difference.

282
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:05,829
You did better than her if you asked me.

283
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:09,625
Hey, I'm nothing compared to Selena.

284
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,543
I couldn't be like her even if I tried.

285
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:13,253
Why not?

286
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:16,048
She wasn't an expert
when she first started out.

287
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:19,968
But still, you are doing better
than when I first started.

288
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:21,303
Come on.

289
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:23,138
Still.

290
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:28,060
I guess you liked seeing Selena
more than our first date.

291
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:29,770
What?

292
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:32,356
Nothing.

293
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:36,693
You haven't closed yet.

294
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:39,404
-Did you have customers this late?
-Hey, Ju-kyung!

295
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:41,406
Why are you roaming about so late?

296
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,242
Did you have dinner yet, Ju-kyung?

297
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:44,826
I did have dinner.

298
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,245
Guess who I saw today?

299
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:47,329
I saw Selena!

300
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:48,580
Selena? Who's that?

301
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:51,750
-She's a famous makeup artist--
-The one who does makeup for celebrities?

302
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:53,627
She has a tough job just like me.

303
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:58,924
There's no money coming in,
but always money going out.

304
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:02,094
Taking care of a family of five
is incredibly difficult.

305
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:04,429
If only we still had our apartment.

306
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:09,434
Is business not doing well lately?

307
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:11,186
It's not like how it used to be.

308
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:15,232
I need to make it work
until you all graduate college.

309
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,193
I'll get going then.

310
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:19,486
Hey!

311
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:21,780
Take this out on your way out.

312
00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:23,615
It stinks.

313
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:26,994
And do the dishes when you get home.

314
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:28,996
COLUMBUS PARK SPOTTED

315
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:30,872
We'll get fruit flies otherwise.

316
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:33,208
Ju-young is at home.
You should have asked him.

317
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,172
I've always wanted this.

318
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:48,181
It's so soft.

319
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:55,147
CAREER INTEREST SURVEY

320
00:21:56,523 --> 00:21:58,525
So what if I have an interest?

321
00:21:58,608 --> 00:22:01,403
It's not as if my interest
will get me there.

322
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:03,405
Which college should I choose?

323
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:23,550
MAKEUP ARTIST LICENSE COURSE
1.5 MILLION WON PER MONTH

324
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:25,177
1.5 million won?

325
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:28,221
It's too expensive to even dream about it.

326
00:22:34,394 --> 00:22:36,104
What's going on? Did you drink again?

327
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:37,022
No.

328
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:38,982
Alcohol…

329
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:41,318
drank me.

330
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:44,863
What's going on with her lately?

331
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:47,699
-Take off your shoes first.
-Throw them out.

332
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:49,618
Hello?

333
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:50,702
Hee-kyung.

334
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:53,705
Where are you?
I couldn't reach you at all.

335
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:56,750
My sister is asleep right now.
By the way, who is this?

336
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:57,667
I…

337
00:22:58,168 --> 00:22:59,878
was her subordinate in the military.

338
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:02,756
Have a good night.

339
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:05,133
Salute!

340
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:09,930
-A subordinate in the military?
-Salute.

341
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:13,725
That voice sounded very familiar.

342
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:46,508
I have a headache.

343
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:48,051
Dad, where's my uniform?

344
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:50,804
-Here it is.
-Honey, get me some water.

345
00:23:50,887 --> 00:23:52,055
Dad!

346
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:54,558
-Honey?
-I'm hungry.

347
00:23:54,641 --> 00:23:56,184
Hey, have you guys seen your dad?

348
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:57,144
No.

349
00:23:57,227 --> 00:23:59,521
Gosh, where did he go
early in the morning?

350
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:01,273
What's this?

351
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:03,984
TO MY DEAR FAMILY

352
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:05,443
I can't believe this!

353
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:07,154
-What is it?
-What?

354
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:10,115
To my dear family, Hyun-sook, kids,

355
00:24:10,198 --> 00:24:13,952
I'm heading to Jeju Island
to catch Columbus Park.

356
00:24:14,035 --> 00:24:16,580
I won't be heading back home

357
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:19,166
until I get him and my money back.

358
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:21,710
But don't you worry about me.

359
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:23,879
This is absolutely ridiculous!

360
00:24:29,342 --> 00:24:30,635
Someone's enjoying her life.

361
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:40,812
Hey, wake up. The bus will be here soon.

362
00:25:00,498 --> 00:25:02,500
Hey, Seo-jun.

363
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:05,337
Hey, do you fall asleep
just about anywhere?

364
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:07,839
You wouldn't know if you got kidnapped.

365
00:25:08,965 --> 00:25:11,092
I'm heavy so that won't be possible.

366
00:25:14,262 --> 00:25:15,597
I'm sorry about that.

367
00:25:16,973 --> 00:25:18,016
Seriously?

368
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:20,894
I should have ignored you and left.

369
00:25:20,977 --> 00:25:22,229
What am I doing, seriously?

370
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:23,563
What?

371
00:25:25,273 --> 00:25:27,567
I see you're not riding
your motorcycle these days.

372
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:29,736
Is it because I told you not to?

373
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:31,738
What?

374
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:42,374
You should listen to your mother.

375
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:43,708
I'm sorry,

376
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:45,669
but I have a soft spot for a sick person,

377
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:47,379
so I have to take her side on this.

378
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:50,715
Hey, your mom's worried sick about it.

379
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,592
So why risk it and ride the motorcycle?

380
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:04,187
Do you think

381
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:06,940
I'm one to simply follow your orders?

382
00:26:07,023 --> 00:26:09,234
I'm a very good son, you know.

383
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:11,569
I'm not riding it
since my mom told me not to.

384
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:14,281
The bus will arrive shortly.

385
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:16,157
The bus is here. Where are you going?

386
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,577
I'm going to run to school
to get some exercise. Why?

387
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:20,912
See you later.

388
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:26,334
What was that?

389
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:29,212
Gosh. What am I doing, really?

390
00:26:30,046 --> 00:26:32,424
I'm sorry.
I won't be able to see you this evening.

391
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:37,137
Is something going on?

392
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:40,473
Mr. Han, if you're free this evening,

393
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:43,268
will you help me choose
a birthday present for the vice principal?

394
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:44,269
Excuse me?

395
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:46,313
I'm supposed to get it,

396
00:26:46,396 --> 00:26:49,107
but I'm not sure what to get for a man.

397
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:51,985
Well, I'm no expert
in choosing gifts either.

398
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:53,278
I can accompany you.

399
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:56,656
I have to go to the department store
to get a present for my wife anyway.

400
00:26:58,074 --> 00:26:59,117
Yes, hello?

401
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:03,455
Well then, Mr. Han. I'll see you later.

402
00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:04,706
But…

403
00:27:14,632 --> 00:27:15,675
Hey, Ju-kyung's here.

404
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:18,928
Limju, you have a boyfriend now?

405
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:21,473
How come you didn't tell me?
What school does he go to?

406
00:27:21,556 --> 00:27:23,808
He's not in our school, is he? Tell me.

407
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:24,809
Who told you that?

408
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:30,357
I saw them at the K-Mall.

409
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,984
She hid him because
she didn't want us to see him.

410
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:35,487
Hey, I told you it wasn't like that.

411
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:38,365
Hey, why are you being so shy?
You got a boyfriend.

412
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:39,407
-So what?
-He's right.

413
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:40,992
You're overreacting too.

414
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:43,912
-Are you dating a celebrity or something?
-"A celebrity."

415
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:45,872
-Is she, though?
-Really?

416
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:52,087
Tell me. Who is it?
So you got a boyfriend?

417
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:53,380
No, it's not like that.

418
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:55,048
Then what are they talking about?

419
00:27:55,131 --> 00:27:55,965
Man.

420
00:27:56,633 --> 00:28:00,929
I told you to tell her how you feel,
you dum-dum!

421
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:08,269
What to do now?

422
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:09,562
What's wrong with you?

423
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:10,855
Don't act up, okay?

424
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:11,940
Hey!

425
00:28:13,316 --> 00:28:14,776
Go back to your seats.

426
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:16,528
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

427
00:28:24,702 --> 00:28:25,537
LIM JU-KYUNG

428
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:26,996
Want to go to Prince Comics later?

429
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:27,914
BOYFRIEND

430
00:28:27,997 --> 00:28:30,125
Sure.
Let's get instant noodles with egg too.

431
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:33,211
I forgot to ask. Send me the picture.

432
00:28:33,294 --> 00:28:34,379
What picture?

433
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:37,424
The picture we took on the boat together.

434
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:46,474
AHN HYUN-KYU

435
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:57,652
BOYFRIEND

436
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:59,362
Why aren't you sending me the photo?

437
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:02,240
AHN HYUN-KYU

438
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:04,534
Ahn Hyun-kyu?

439
00:29:07,203 --> 00:29:09,122
Darn it. Why him?

440
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:15,670
Hey, don't fall off.

441
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:23,428
UNREAD

442
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:25,513
He hasn't read it yet.

443
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:27,682
All right.

444
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:29,559
I just have to get rid of the evidence.

445
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:31,436
I can do it.

446
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:36,191
-Move forward!
-Just do it quickly!

447
00:29:43,823 --> 00:29:44,991
Hey, Ju-kyung!

448
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:47,368
I'm sorry.

449
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:50,997
Hey, I told you not to do it like that!

450
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,708
-You should have done it right!
-You don't even make sense!

451
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,794
-Man, seriously.
-It's not my fault!

452
00:30:03,092 --> 00:30:04,469
USE FINGERPRINT OR ENTER PIN

453
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:09,849
Okay, your Korean History teacher's here!

454
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:13,812
All right,

455
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:15,480
have a seat.

456
00:30:15,563 --> 00:30:18,191
The Japanese Invasion of Korea in 1592,
the Imjin War.

457
00:30:18,274 --> 00:30:19,943
What's a good way to memorize this?

458
00:30:20,026 --> 00:30:22,695
I need to delete it
before he notices his phone's missing.

459
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:25,156
That should do the trick, right?

460
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,366
Fingerprint.

461
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:27,867
Fingerprint.

462
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:29,661
How do I get his fingerprint?

463
00:30:29,744 --> 00:30:31,371
…the politics of that era…

464
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:35,124
Is Su-ah taking a class
on the science of sleep?

465
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:36,751
She wouldn't wake
even if someone took her.

466
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,419
-Cute.
-Seriously, 1592…

467
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:39,337
That's it.

468
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:40,839
Fall asleep.

469
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:43,049
The rest of you, focus up.

470
00:30:43,132 --> 00:30:44,300
Fall asleep.

471
00:30:45,051 --> 00:30:47,303
So you won't know what hits you.

472
00:30:49,138 --> 00:30:50,598
Why is he suddenly studying so hard?

473
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:52,684
Come on, fall asleep.

474
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:05,572
What is she doing?

475
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:13,162
All right, you're falling asleep.

476
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:16,541
Falling asleep.

477
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:21,379
Falling asleep.

478
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:24,132
Red Sun!

479
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:28,720
Mark down the things
I said were important.

480
00:31:28,803 --> 00:31:29,971
Awesome.

481
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:32,640
Okay, that's it for today.
I'll see you next time!

482
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:49,407
LIM JU-KYUNG

483
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:51,242
-What? Why do you have my phone?
-What?

484
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:52,660
I said why do you--

485
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:54,746
What is this about?

486
00:31:57,749 --> 00:31:59,083
It's nothing.

487
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:02,879
Excuse me.

488
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:08,301
Seriously, what's up with her?

489
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:19,896
Gosh.

490
00:32:19,979 --> 00:32:22,565
If Hyun-kyu found out about us,
the whole school…

491
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:25,485
No, even people from other schools
would know of it by now.

492
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:28,780
The rumors about the rooftop
must have really shaken you.

493
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:30,239
That too, but…

494
00:32:32,992 --> 00:32:36,663
I'm afraid of people talking smack
when they learn of our relationship.

495
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:40,124
They'd wonder why a guy like you
would date a girl like me.

496
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,418
And what's wrong with you?

497
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:45,505
It's obvious.

498
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:48,591
I'm neither pretty

499
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:50,301
nor smart.

500
00:32:51,594 --> 00:32:53,721
You are way out of my league.

501
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:57,308
You're enough.

502
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:00,645
You're enough just the way you are.

503
00:33:03,022 --> 00:33:04,482
So don't say things like that.

504
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:17,996
PRINCE COMICS

505
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:22,500
At least this place
is free of our schoolmates.

506
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:25,753
-Want to meet up here from now on?
-Sure.

507
00:33:37,598 --> 00:33:38,599
What is it?

508
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:48,359
Look who's here! Go-un!

509
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:49,944
Ju-kyung!

510
00:33:57,243 --> 00:33:59,162
This place won't work either.

511
00:33:59,662 --> 00:34:01,205
I'll call you later.

512
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:10,506
-Get home safe!
-Okay.

513
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:30,276
It's probably too young for him.

514
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:31,360
Should we exchange it?

515
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:34,781
They all look pretty similar to me.

516
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:39,243
Will you get up, please?

517
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:40,578
How did you…

518
00:34:47,835 --> 00:34:49,378
Do you know this person?

519
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:50,922
Who…

520
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:53,299
-I'm Lim Hee-kyung.
-Right.

521
00:34:53,382 --> 00:34:54,425
And who are you?

522
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,971
-I'm Lee Hye-lim.
-Indeed.

523
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:00,306
I'm his colleague.

524
00:35:00,389 --> 00:35:01,307
For now.

525
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:03,142
Is that going to change in the future?

526
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:07,105
I guess colleagues these days
are quite intimate.

527
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:09,774
You meet outside of work
and fix his ties and stuff?

528
00:35:09,857 --> 00:35:11,609
No. Not at all.

529
00:35:13,152 --> 00:35:13,986
You've misread--

530
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:16,614
What's your relationship
with Mr. Han, then?

531
00:35:16,697 --> 00:35:17,949
-Well…
-His girlfriend.

532
00:35:18,032 --> 00:35:20,159
-Excuse me?
-What?

533
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:23,621
We're seeing each other.

534
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:29,001
-My ears aren't working…
-His girlfriend!

535
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:32,505
-Let's talk outside.
-I can't hear well.

536
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,384
We're dating! This guy is my man!

537
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:37,468
Can't you hear at all?

538
00:35:38,052 --> 00:35:39,637
Jeez, what kind of…

539
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,805
Goodness.

540
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:43,516
You're Mr. Han's girlfriend?

541
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:45,143
So nice to meet you!

542
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:47,979
-Nice to meet you too.
-Sir, I'm sorry.

543
00:35:48,062 --> 00:35:49,313
I'm going to head home.

544
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:50,356
But why?

545
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:52,108
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

546
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:55,570
What is it?

547
00:35:57,029 --> 00:35:57,989
Jun-woo.

548
00:36:04,745 --> 00:36:05,872
It's…

549
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:15,673
CAREER INTEREST SURVEY

550
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:21,554
HANKOOK UNIVERSITY COSMETOLOGY

551
00:36:28,811 --> 00:36:30,855
What's with her?
Why is she sleeping all day?

552
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:32,732
She was up late
looking for a part-time job.

553
00:36:32,815 --> 00:36:34,942
What? A part-time job?

554
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:37,778
She must have been really tired.

555
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:50,291
Hey, you dropped this.

556
00:36:58,216 --> 00:36:59,258
Right, Kangsu.

557
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:00,718
Want to stop by the snack bar?

558
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:03,971
Kangsu!

559
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:19,737
Guys should hold girls like that.

560
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,656
Isn't that Soo-ho's?
Then I'll give it to him.

561
00:37:22,865 --> 00:37:23,783
Have you seen Ju-kyung?

562
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:26,202
Ju-kyung asked me to bring this to you.

563
00:37:26,285 --> 00:37:27,578
She asked you?

564
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:39,799
RESUME

565
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:42,843
-Is this your first job?
-Yes.

566
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:46,597
-I'm looking for someone with experience.
-I'll work hard if you train me.

567
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:48,432
Plenty of people can work hard.

568
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:49,350
The thing is,

569
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:51,102
I need someone who'll do well.

570
00:37:51,185 --> 00:37:52,603
-I'm sorry.
-Well…

571
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:55,273
I understand.

572
00:37:56,065 --> 00:37:58,567
I'm sorry. We already have a part-timer.

573
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:02,780
I guess it's not easy
to get a part-time job either.

574
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:08,160
BOYFRIEND

575
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:14,292
The person you are trying to reach
is unavailable…

576
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:15,835
Is he very busy?

577
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:29,890
A pervert!

578
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:32,101
What the heck?

579
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:36,147
-Seo-jun?
-What's this?

580
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:37,982
What are you doing here?

581
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:39,692
The same goes for you.

582
00:38:39,775 --> 00:38:42,611
Why are you taking your clothes off
in the women's restroom?

583
00:38:45,197 --> 00:38:46,198
Damn it!

584
00:38:54,915 --> 00:38:56,709
You totally look like a model.

585
00:38:57,668 --> 00:38:59,503
Are you doing a photo shoot?

586
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:00,421
Yes.

587
00:39:00,921 --> 00:39:01,756
Bye.

588
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:03,966
What? Really?

589
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:05,760
Hey, Seo-jun!

590
00:39:11,265 --> 00:39:12,433
A billion won?

591
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:15,353
Mr. Lee donated big this year.

592
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:18,272
That's why the hospital director
brought in the press

593
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:21,108
and made a big deal out of
giving him an appreciation plaque.

594
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:25,696
One might think that Lee Ju-hun
founded our hospital's cancer center.

595
00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:30,034
-Hello!
-We kept you waiting, haven't we?

596
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:31,952
-I'm sorry.
-There's no need.

597
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:33,788
I invited you when you must be busy.

598
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:37,500
Soo-ho, it's been a while, right?

599
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:38,959
Hello, how have you been?

600
00:39:40,169 --> 00:39:41,837
Okay, that was great just now. Edgy.

601
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:43,381
Now turn. Just once, that's it.

602
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:45,633
I'm moving in closer.
You look great. One, two.

603
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:48,052
Hey, the last two shots.
One, two, two, three.

604
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:49,804
Three, two… Okay.

605
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:51,972
It's perfect, Seo-jun.
Smile a bit more. One, two.

606
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:53,557
Look down. Here.

607
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:56,060
Okay. One, two.

608
00:39:56,143 --> 00:39:57,770
Three, two. Right, just like that.

609
00:39:57,853 --> 00:39:59,105
Go, one, two.

610
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:01,315
Okay! We got it.

611
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:03,025
Seo-jun, let's get you changed.

612
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:04,485
Great job.

613
00:40:07,029 --> 00:40:08,572
What? You're still here?

614
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:10,825
Yes. It was exciting,
so I stayed and watched.

615
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:14,328
-Hold on. Are you Seo-jun's girlfriend?
-No, she's not.

616
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:15,579
-Hello.
-Hi.

617
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:17,832
If you have such a pretty friend…

618
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:19,166
Pretty, my foot.

619
00:40:20,292 --> 00:40:22,962
-Hurry up and leave.
-Jeez. All right.

620
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:24,046
Wait.

621
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:26,966
What's your problem, kicking her out?

622
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:29,468
Excuse me, Seo-jun's friend?

623
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:32,221
Do you want to model for the day?

624
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:36,934
Actually, our female model didn't show up,
so I was in trouble.

625
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:40,187
-Me?
-Hey.

626
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:41,939
Can anyone be a model now?

627
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:44,400
I told you to leave!

628
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:50,239
We desperately need a model
to update our new items in time.

629
00:40:50,322 --> 00:40:51,699
So, would you like to try it?

630
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:52,616
Well…

631
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,827
But I've never done
anything like this before…

632
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:56,704
You might do better
because you're a blank slate.

633
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:59,790
And since you're his friend,
I'll give you a better pay.

634
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:01,500
There's payment?

635
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:02,710
Then I want to try it!

636
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:04,420
-Hey!
-Awesome.

637
00:41:06,088 --> 00:41:08,132
I heard you two are
in the same class this year.

638
00:41:09,383 --> 00:41:13,179
I hope you take good care of him, Su-jin.

639
00:41:13,762 --> 00:41:16,640
I keep telling him to move in with me,
but he won't listen.

640
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:19,393
Since we live apart,
looking after him isn't easy.

641
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:20,811
I will.

642
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:23,147
I can manage on my own
without a caretaker.

643
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:24,231
Don't you worry.

644
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:26,066
By the way,

645
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:29,653
Soo-ho looks more like you
with each passing day.

646
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:31,322
Have you thought about making him a star?

647
00:41:31,405 --> 00:41:34,408
His grades are too good
for him to just be a celebrity.

648
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:35,493
Is that right?

649
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:37,828
As long as it's something Soo-ho likes,

650
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:39,497
I'll support whatever he chooses.

651
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:41,999
You can say that
since he does well on his own.

652
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:44,877
If I don't hold the reins for Su-jin,

653
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,879
she'll lose her senses and hit the bottom.

654
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:49,131
Compared to boys,

655
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:51,800
she lacks patience
and isn't as competitive.

656
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:54,470
That's why she always falls behind Soo-ho.

657
00:41:55,095 --> 00:41:57,389
Your innate smarts do factor in, but…

658
00:41:57,473 --> 00:41:58,682
We have a study session.

659
00:42:02,269 --> 00:42:04,230
-You're leaving already?
-Yes, excuse us.

660
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:06,857
Let's go.

661
00:42:09,235 --> 00:42:10,194
Goodbye.

662
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:11,654
Take care.

663
00:42:15,115 --> 00:42:17,034
That's a little awkward.
No, don't do that.

664
00:42:17,117 --> 00:42:18,285
Don't point at things.

665
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:20,037
Try acting natural, okay?

666
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,038
All right, one, two.

667
00:42:21,121 --> 00:42:22,373
No, that's not it either.

668
00:42:22,456 --> 00:42:24,542
-Try something natural.
-Something like this?

669
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:26,168
Out of the question. One, two.

670
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:27,336
No. Don't do that.

671
00:42:27,419 --> 00:42:28,879
-Not the hair--
-Come on!

672
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:30,464
You're keeping her when she's this bad?

673
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:34,134
I haven't taken very many photos.
I'm so sorry.

674
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:35,469
That's only natural for a newbie.

675
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:37,137
He was the same. Right, Seo-jun?

676
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:39,807
Seo-jun, can you get close to her
and get things moving?

677
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:42,726
Act like you are really close, okay?

678
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:45,437
Okay, let's go! All right.
One, two, three.

679
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:47,439
That's it. Arms around his shoulders.

680
00:42:47,523 --> 00:42:48,899
Okay, Seo-jun, smile. Go on.

681
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:51,777
We just need you to smile, Seo-jun.
Come on.

682
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:54,405
Hey, Han Seo-jun!
Why are you acting like an amateur?

683
00:42:54,488 --> 00:42:56,073
It's not your first couple shoot.

684
00:42:56,156 --> 00:42:57,616
Let's just stop, then.

685
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,952
It must be your empty stomach talking.

686
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:02,621
I'll get you something nice.
Let's take ten.

687
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:04,039
Let's take ten, guys.

688
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:04,957
Sure.

689
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:10,421
-I'm really bad, aren't I?
-No.

690
00:43:10,504 --> 00:43:11,797
You're awful beyond imagination.

691
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:14,675
So tell him you can't do it and leave.

692
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:18,762
Are you being territorial? That's petty.
You should help me out.

693
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:20,848
I don't want to.

694
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,477
Is it because of the lights?
It's really hot in here.

695
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:32,359
-What are you doing?
-What?

696
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:34,612
I can't ruin a new dress.

697
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:37,615
-It's so hot.
-Jeez.

698
00:43:41,076 --> 00:43:42,328
My face is too shiny.

699
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:50,377
Want me to dab your face?

700
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:55,799
What are you doing?

701
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:57,968
You've got some sweat on you too.

702
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:00,804
No thanks. Go sit over there.

703
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:03,766
Why not? I'm trying to
make you look good in the pictures.

704
00:44:05,267 --> 00:44:06,393
I said, don't.

705
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:11,148
Does this come easy to you?

706
00:44:12,566 --> 00:44:13,484
What does?

707
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:25,412
I'm a man too.

708
00:44:28,582 --> 00:44:30,459
You're certainly a man and not a woman.

709
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:34,505
What's this?

710
00:44:34,588 --> 00:44:36,674
That's what I wanted. Where's my camera?

711
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:37,633
Okay, great.

712
00:44:37,716 --> 00:44:40,219
Let's go. Look this way.
Just like that, one, two.

713
00:44:44,473 --> 00:44:46,183
Cooperate so we can wrap it up quickly.

714
00:45:25,848 --> 00:45:27,433
You really are just reading.

715
00:45:27,516 --> 00:45:29,351
Wasn't the study session just an excuse?

716
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:30,394
No, it wasn't.

717
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:34,398
But still, thank you.
My food wasn't going down back there.

718
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:37,734
Are you really
not moving in with your dad?

719
00:45:37,818 --> 00:45:39,653
It sounded like he really wants you to.

720
00:45:39,736 --> 00:45:42,739
We've lived apart for longer.
It'll only make things awkward.

721
00:45:43,657 --> 00:45:45,033
It's comfortable right now.

722
00:45:45,117 --> 00:45:45,951
Yours and mine…

723
00:45:46,827 --> 00:45:48,162
What's wrong with our dads?

724
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:49,204
By the way,

725
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:51,790
nothing has happened since then?

726
00:45:52,374 --> 00:45:55,377
-Did you get slapped--
-No, nothing happened.

727
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:57,754
Things will be calm
until the next report card.

728
00:45:58,422 --> 00:46:00,841
Anyway, what gives?
You're worried about me?

729
00:46:01,675 --> 00:46:02,593
What do you mean?

730
00:46:02,676 --> 00:46:06,305
You've been talking more lately
as if you've regained some humanity.

731
00:46:06,388 --> 00:46:07,306
Whatever.

732
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:14,146
MISSED CALL LIM JU-KYUNG

733
00:46:14,229 --> 00:46:15,355
I missed a call.

734
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:19,776
BOYFRIEND

735
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:22,279
It's on me since it was
thanks to you I got paid.

736
00:46:22,863 --> 00:46:25,782
-Why are you getting a part-time job?
-To pay for beauty school.

737
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:26,950
Beauty school?

738
00:46:27,034 --> 00:46:29,203
While filling out
my career interest survey,

739
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:31,997
I thought about what I found interesting,

740
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:34,541
and makeup came to my mind.

741
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:37,836
My heart fluttered
when I did stage makeup for Go-un.

742
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:39,880
My sister

743
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:41,882
did look like a different person.

744
00:46:41,965 --> 00:46:43,550
-Here's your tteokbokki.
-It's here!

745
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:55,062
Anyway,

746
00:46:56,104 --> 00:46:57,981
you've had many girlfriends, haven't you?

747
00:46:58,899 --> 00:46:59,733
Why do you ask?

748
00:46:59,816 --> 00:47:01,652
What did you save her as in your phone?

749
00:47:01,735 --> 00:47:04,029
Do guys not put much meaning into this?

750
00:47:05,697 --> 00:47:06,657
Yes, they do.

751
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:09,868
I save my girlfriend's number
under something super sweet,

752
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:11,411
like my love, baby, or princess.

753
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:12,329
With hearts.

754
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:15,332
I see.

755
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:19,294
Right, I told you on our school trip…

756
00:47:19,378 --> 00:47:21,421
I don't care. Don't tell me.

757
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:23,090
I'm dating Soo-ho.

758
00:47:23,757 --> 00:47:26,260
You really don't listen.
I said, don't tell me.

759
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:27,511
I don't want to either.

760
00:47:27,594 --> 00:47:30,013
But after crying about liking him
in front of you,

761
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:32,891
-how could I not say anything?
-I'm not congratulating you.

762
00:47:35,477 --> 00:47:37,354
You're eating well.
Should I order one more?

763
00:47:37,437 --> 00:47:38,438
Don't bother!

764
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:41,692
The others didn't seem to know.

765
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:43,694
Is this also a secret?

766
00:47:43,777 --> 00:47:46,196
Yes, I think it'd be best for now.

767
00:47:46,863 --> 00:47:48,448
And Soo-ho easily agreed to that?

768
00:47:49,074 --> 00:47:49,908
Why do you ask?

769
00:47:50,492 --> 00:47:52,077
If I had a girlfriend,

770
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:55,080
I'd want to show her off
and tell everyone.

771
00:47:56,331 --> 00:47:57,708
That's how I'd feel, at least.

772
00:48:01,461 --> 00:48:02,754
Get down.

773
00:48:02,838 --> 00:48:04,381
Do we really have to do this?

774
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:07,217
I wonder if I hurt his feelings.

775
00:48:10,929 --> 00:48:12,806
-Is it spicy?
-No.

776
00:48:12,889 --> 00:48:15,058
It's perfect. I love it.

777
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:17,311
Are you going home now?

778
00:48:18,312 --> 00:48:20,188
Look! Those kids go to our middle school.

779
00:48:21,815 --> 00:48:22,649
I see.

780
00:48:27,279 --> 00:48:28,947
I think you've gotten taller.

781
00:48:29,031 --> 00:48:31,325
You used to be shorter than me
and would get beaten up.

782
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:32,576
When did you get so tall?

783
00:48:32,659 --> 00:48:34,578
Still talking about our kindergarten days?

784
00:48:43,295 --> 00:48:45,380
-Get home safe.
-Okay.

785
00:48:54,723 --> 00:48:56,099
-I'll walk you home.
-Hello?

786
00:48:56,683 --> 00:48:57,517
See you tomorrow.

787
00:48:58,268 --> 00:48:59,936
We keep missing each other's calls.

788
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:02,439
I have heartburn.

789
00:49:03,357 --> 00:49:06,693
Why did I shove all that in
when I can't even eat spicy food?

790
00:49:08,028 --> 00:49:08,862
Eat.

791
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:11,865
Here.

792
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:21,541
What did you do today?

793
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:24,211
I interviewed for part-time jobs,
but I didn't get any of them.

794
00:49:32,177 --> 00:49:34,554
Anyway, I made some money
for the first time ever.

795
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:35,972
I ran into Seo-jun somehow--

796
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:36,932
Sir?

797
00:49:38,433 --> 00:49:39,518
Soo-ho?

798
00:49:41,895 --> 00:49:42,729
"Sir"?

799
00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:44,523
Who do you mean?

800
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:46,274
Just now…

801
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:48,026
I saw your…

802
00:49:53,281 --> 00:49:54,282
You can't.

803
00:49:57,577 --> 00:50:00,205
How can a person scam others
in a scam victims' group?

804
00:50:00,288 --> 00:50:02,582
They asked us to go catch him as a group.

805
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:05,794
Then they ran off
with our flight and lodging fees.

806
00:50:07,087 --> 00:50:09,005
They were very clever and organized.

807
00:50:10,507 --> 00:50:12,718
It sounds like you fell for a sloppy scam.

808
00:50:12,801 --> 00:50:14,302
No, they were…

809
00:50:14,386 --> 00:50:15,846
Gosh. Whatever.

810
00:50:16,888 --> 00:50:20,267
I talked big to my family
about how I won't return until I got him,

811
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:21,309
so how can I go back?

812
00:50:21,393 --> 00:50:25,522
That's why you should
keep this a secret from Ju-kyung, okay?

813
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:28,191
She must be worried, so how could I?

814
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:30,277
-Let's just call her right--
-No, never!

815
00:50:30,777 --> 00:50:31,945
If you tell her now,

816
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:34,322
I'll run away and never return.

817
00:50:34,406 --> 00:50:37,576
Then what is your plan?
You said you're out of money now.

818
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:43,290
I'd rather freeze to death
sleeping on this cold floor

819
00:50:44,166 --> 00:50:45,417
than go back home.

820
00:50:46,668 --> 00:50:47,669
Not to mine, at least.

821
00:50:48,503 --> 00:50:49,337
Okay.

822
00:50:49,963 --> 00:50:50,797
What?

823
00:50:51,298 --> 00:50:52,674
Well then, good night.

824
00:50:53,258 --> 00:50:54,760
-What?
-I'll get going.

825
00:50:54,843 --> 00:50:56,303
Soo-ho. Wait a moment.

826
00:50:58,221 --> 00:51:01,308
-Your name means savior.
-That's right.

827
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:03,810
You have some saving to do.

828
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:05,395
Hey, Soo-ho, wait up.

829
00:51:11,693 --> 00:51:13,987
You live here by yourself?

830
00:51:14,070 --> 00:51:16,031
Mr. Lee sure must be busy.

831
00:51:16,114 --> 00:51:17,407
You can take a shower here.

832
00:51:33,256 --> 00:51:34,716
Soo-ho!

833
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:40,013
-Are you all right?
-I think I sprained my back. I can't move.

834
00:51:40,096 --> 00:51:41,014
Help me up, please.

835
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:50,941
You can sleep here.
I'll sleep on the couch.

836
00:51:51,817 --> 00:51:53,109
I can't possibly do that.

837
00:51:53,193 --> 00:51:55,278
I can't be so brazen
to my daughter's friend.

838
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:57,113
I'll sleep outside,

839
00:51:57,197 --> 00:52:00,826
so don't mind me,
and sleep here in comfort.

840
00:52:00,909 --> 00:52:02,118
Good night then.

841
00:52:02,744 --> 00:52:04,663
Soo-ho, thank you.

842
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:06,790
Thank you, Soo-ho.

843
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:11,837
The house looks seriously terrible
without Dad.

844
00:52:12,379 --> 00:52:15,799
Hey, why don't you clean my room
while you're at it?

845
00:52:15,882 --> 00:52:18,134
-Then I should start with you.
-That's disgusting!

846
00:52:18,218 --> 00:52:19,845
There you go again!

847
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:23,807
I'll do the cleaning.
Leave it and come have some apples.

848
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:26,351
It's fine.
You must be tired after working all day.

849
00:52:26,434 --> 00:52:27,561
I'm almost done.

850
00:52:28,186 --> 00:52:33,400
-Like a lone flower blossoming
-Like a lone flower blossoming

851
00:52:34,276 --> 00:52:37,529
In a wide open field

852
00:52:37,612 --> 00:52:44,411
I've protected the feeling of emptiness

853
00:52:44,494 --> 00:52:46,329
Inside my heart

854
00:52:46,413 --> 00:52:51,042
Like the sun coming out

855
00:52:51,126 --> 00:52:56,006
-After heavy rain…
-…I've protected

856
00:52:56,631 --> 00:52:58,800
-The feeling of emptiness…
-Hey!

857
00:52:59,759 --> 00:53:01,052
Don't you sing that song.

858
00:53:01,136 --> 00:53:02,429
-Don't sing it!
-What?

859
00:53:05,682 --> 00:53:06,933
What's up with him?

860
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:11,021
Anyway, I wonder if your dad
is at least eating some food.

861
00:53:11,104 --> 00:53:13,857
He's probably eating well
and sleeping well.

862
00:53:22,449 --> 00:53:23,325
Mr. Lim?

863
00:53:23,408 --> 00:53:24,951
Gosh, you startled me.

864
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:26,995
Did I wake you? I'm sorry.

865
00:53:27,078 --> 00:53:29,497
What are you doing up this early?

866
00:53:30,498 --> 00:53:32,292
Son Heung-min's playing, you see…

867
00:53:33,418 --> 00:53:35,128
Right, I'd set an alarm for it.

868
00:53:36,588 --> 00:53:37,756
You're his fan, then.

869
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:39,758
Shall we watch the second half together?

870
00:53:39,841 --> 00:53:41,134
Mr. Lim.

871
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:43,762
After watching the first half highlights.

872
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:50,810
Looks good.

873
00:53:54,230 --> 00:53:55,398
Here, have some.

874
00:53:56,858 --> 00:53:58,026
I don't eat at this hour.

875
00:53:58,109 --> 00:54:00,236
It's not the same with a game going on.

876
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:02,364
You'll regret it if you don't. Come on.

877
00:54:03,698 --> 00:54:04,616
I'll eat it myself.

878
00:54:05,367 --> 00:54:06,284
Okay then.

879
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:10,538
-You have no idea how good it is.
-He's just like Ju-kyung.

880
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:12,374
It looks so good.

881
00:54:14,459 --> 00:54:15,460
It's so hot!

882
00:54:16,503 --> 00:54:17,379
Hot!

883
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:19,464
-I burned my tongue.
-Here.

884
00:54:20,465 --> 00:54:21,967
You should have slowed down.

885
00:54:23,301 --> 00:54:25,804
You're quite sweet, Soo-ho.

886
00:54:25,887 --> 00:54:26,763
The second half starts

887
00:54:26,846 --> 00:54:28,765
-with Son Heung-min's kick-off!
-Son Heung-min!

888
00:54:29,683 --> 00:54:32,644
Which team will advance to the final?

889
00:54:32,727 --> 00:54:34,229
Yes. As we speak,

890
00:54:34,312 --> 00:54:36,815
he quickly goes to score an equalizer
as the second half starts.

891
00:54:36,898 --> 00:54:38,358
He crosses the ball early!

892
00:54:38,441 --> 00:54:39,985
It falls short.

893
00:54:40,068 --> 00:54:41,611
Son Heung-min gets it right away!

894
00:54:41,695 --> 00:54:45,115
He doesn't hesitate
and uses his right foot. Shoot, goal!

895
00:54:45,198 --> 00:54:49,995
Son Heung-min scores
just two minutes into the second half.

896
00:55:52,891 --> 00:55:53,933
Soo-ho!

897
00:55:54,434 --> 00:55:55,268
Soo-ho.

898
00:55:55,769 --> 00:55:57,520
You barely had your breakfast.

899
00:55:57,604 --> 00:55:58,855
Have this on the way.

900
00:55:58,938 --> 00:56:01,357
Go enjoy your classes and come home later.

901
00:56:01,983 --> 00:56:04,319
That's not it.
I'll have gone home by then.

902
00:56:05,236 --> 00:56:06,362
Thanks for everything.

903
00:56:06,446 --> 00:56:07,781
You're going home now, right?

904
00:56:08,281 --> 00:56:09,699
I'll keep your secret just for today--

905
00:56:09,783 --> 00:56:12,035
Okay. I'll be off
as soon as I finish the dishes.

906
00:56:12,118 --> 00:56:14,704
I just need to be prepared mentally.

907
00:56:14,788 --> 00:56:16,706
To get scolded by my wife.

908
00:56:21,461 --> 00:56:23,546
He's so young but is so mature.

909
00:56:24,631 --> 00:56:26,966
Is it because he had to grow up
without his mom?

910
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:28,051
Watch out for cars!

911
00:56:31,429 --> 00:56:32,555
-Have fun at school!
-I'm off.

912
00:56:35,558 --> 00:56:36,559
Let's go.

913
00:56:36,643 --> 00:56:38,728
What are they teaching you
in P.E. class today?

914
00:56:38,812 --> 00:56:40,480
-Soccer.
-Is that so?

915
00:56:40,563 --> 00:56:41,648
That'll be fun.

916
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:08,341
What's wrong? Are you lost?

917
00:57:08,424 --> 00:57:09,467
What?

918
00:57:09,551 --> 00:57:12,095
Why do you continue
to roam around in my thoughts?

919
00:57:13,721 --> 00:57:14,681
All right.

920
00:57:14,764 --> 00:57:17,183
I'll give you a chance
to remain in my thoughts.

921
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:21,771
Well…

922
00:57:22,564 --> 00:57:24,399
Go out with me.

923
00:57:27,652 --> 00:57:28,570
Why?

924
00:57:28,653 --> 00:57:31,364
Are you so overwhelmed
that you can't speak?

925
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:35,910
Really not funny.

926
00:57:38,163 --> 00:57:39,205
"Really not funny"?

927
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:40,123
Here.

928
00:57:40,206 --> 00:57:43,126
I used to work at this cafe,
and they're hiring a part-timer.

929
00:57:43,209 --> 00:57:45,503
I already told them about you,
so visit them later.

930
00:57:45,587 --> 00:57:46,421
Gosh.

931
00:57:46,504 --> 00:57:48,798
Amazing. In one day?

932
00:57:48,882 --> 00:57:51,676
Hey, thank you so much.
You're well-connected.

933
00:57:52,343 --> 00:57:54,179
Great job! Excellent!

934
00:57:55,054 --> 00:57:57,599
You're really great. Thank you.

935
00:57:57,682 --> 00:57:59,267
-Ju-kyung.
-What?

936
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:05,231
Let's go.

937
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:19,996
Try to memorize the menu
as soon as possible.

938
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:22,499
Drink recipes are all posted here,

939
00:58:22,582 --> 00:58:25,543
but until you learn them,
you'll take orders and do the dishes.

940
00:58:25,627 --> 00:58:26,669
Got it.

941
00:58:26,753 --> 00:58:27,921
Welcome.

942
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:29,631
I haven't cleaned the cups yet.

943
00:58:30,131 --> 00:58:32,675
-Can you please wash the cups first?
-Yes, of course.

944
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:34,594
Hi, what can I get you?

945
00:58:56,658 --> 00:58:57,951
Oh, no, are you okay?

946
00:58:58,618 --> 00:59:01,037
-I'm okay.
-Goodness.

947
00:59:01,621 --> 00:59:03,456
These will be uploaded to the website.

948
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:04,749
They came out well, right?

949
00:59:04,832 --> 00:59:06,626
JEONG-HUN

950
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:19,013
Why would he send me these?

951
00:59:19,847 --> 00:59:21,057
He could've sent just a few.

952
00:59:22,350 --> 00:59:23,518
WILL YOU DELETE THIS IMAGE?
DELETE

953
00:59:24,227 --> 00:59:29,065
WILL YOU DELETE THIS IMAGE?
CANCEL, DELETE

954
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:32,110
CAFE OWNER

955
00:59:33,194 --> 00:59:34,320
Yes, ma'am?

956
00:59:35,655 --> 00:59:37,240
You decided to hire Ju-kyung?

957
00:59:37,907 --> 00:59:38,992
Yes.

958
00:59:39,075 --> 00:59:41,160
Thanks for introducing her.

959
00:59:41,244 --> 00:59:43,705
Ju-kyung is here right now
getting trained.

960
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:47,584
Goodness. Did you get hurt, Ju-kyung?

961
00:59:48,543 --> 00:59:50,128
What? She got hurt?

962
00:59:50,211 --> 00:59:52,422
It barely touched me.

963
00:59:52,505 --> 00:59:53,756
I'm all right. Really.

964
00:59:58,511 --> 00:59:59,387
Ju-kyung.

965
01:00:03,308 --> 01:00:04,350
Thank you.

966
01:00:06,561 --> 01:00:07,478
Seo-jun!

967
01:00:07,562 --> 01:00:08,855
Where's Ju-kyung?

968
01:00:09,355 --> 01:00:10,440
She left a bit ago.

969
01:00:10,523 --> 01:00:12,859
-Excuse me?
-Did you run here?

970
01:00:14,569 --> 01:00:15,612
Have I gone mad?

971
01:00:16,821 --> 01:00:18,239
Why did I run here?

972
01:00:20,074 --> 01:00:21,993
Hey, where did you get the eyelash curler?

973
01:00:26,039 --> 01:00:28,416
What's with that rude punk?
He didn't even apologize.

974
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:29,792
Are you all right?

975
01:00:38,051 --> 01:00:39,385
Han Seo-jun?

976
01:00:46,643 --> 01:00:49,270
I guess Hee-kyung is not here yet.
What about Ju-young?

977
01:00:49,354 --> 01:00:51,022
Ju-young? He went to his math tutor.

978
01:00:51,898 --> 01:00:53,858
What? He got a tutor?

979
01:00:54,525 --> 01:00:57,070
He wanted to get better at math
so I got him a tutor.

980
01:00:57,153 --> 01:00:58,780
You always say we don't have money.

981
01:01:00,073 --> 01:01:02,325
You said you had no customers
and that things are rough.

982
01:01:02,408 --> 01:01:05,328
Even if I have no money,
I need to provide for my kids.

983
01:01:06,037 --> 01:01:08,164
If you want a math tutor, tell me.

984
01:01:08,247 --> 01:01:10,249
I'll get you one
even if I have to take out a loan.

985
01:01:11,292 --> 01:01:12,877
Then give me 1.5 million won.

986
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:15,088
1.5 million?

987
01:01:15,171 --> 01:01:16,464
Whatever.

988
01:01:17,674 --> 01:01:19,342
I'm the only one thinking about you.

989
01:01:19,425 --> 01:01:21,594
I'm not doing this anymore.
Have Ju-young do it.

990
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:23,346
Ju-kyung, where are you going?

991
01:01:27,475 --> 01:01:30,019
Hey, how was your first day?

992
01:01:30,103 --> 01:01:31,979
I was a mess.

993
01:01:33,231 --> 01:01:35,775
I'll learn things
and do better moving forward.

994
01:01:35,858 --> 01:01:37,568
Why do you sound so down?

995
01:01:38,319 --> 01:01:39,278
Are you outside?

996
01:01:39,362 --> 01:01:40,196
Yes.

997
01:01:41,197 --> 01:01:42,907
I came out to clear my head.

998
01:01:43,449 --> 01:01:45,034
Do you want to come here?

999
01:01:48,121 --> 01:01:50,581
I feel better after exercise.

1000
01:01:50,665 --> 01:01:52,875
You do? So how do I do it?

1001
01:01:53,459 --> 01:01:54,377
Grab me by my collar.

1002
01:01:56,045 --> 01:01:58,131
I'll grab the sleeve here, and then here.

1003
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:00,091
Step in.

1004
01:02:00,675 --> 01:02:01,634
Hey.

1005
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:03,553
Hey.

1006
01:02:05,638 --> 01:02:06,639
Grabbing it.

1007
01:02:11,811 --> 01:02:12,729
Great job.

1008
01:02:12,812 --> 01:02:14,981
Now flip me over
using what you just learned.

1009
01:02:15,064 --> 01:02:16,441
How can I possibly flip you over?

1010
01:02:16,524 --> 01:02:18,401
If you succeed, I'll grant you a wish.

1011
01:02:19,235 --> 01:02:20,903
Really? You're not lying?

1012
01:02:20,987 --> 01:02:22,780
-Why would I lie to you?
-All right.

1013
01:02:48,347 --> 01:02:49,515
You come here!

1014
01:02:53,436 --> 01:02:55,146
Yay, I did it!

1015
01:02:55,229 --> 01:02:56,355
Wasn't that cheating?

1016
01:02:56,439 --> 01:02:58,483
I just learned.
You need to cut me some slack.

1017
01:02:58,566 --> 01:02:59,400
All right.

1018
01:03:00,026 --> 01:03:00,860
What's your wish?

1019
01:03:00,943 --> 01:03:01,778
My wish?

1020
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:06,157
You can ask me to pay
for the beauty school course.

1021
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:08,618
What? It's super expensive.

1022
01:03:08,701 --> 01:03:09,660
Even if it is.

1023
01:03:10,244 --> 01:03:11,829
Are you showing off that you're rich?

1024
01:03:11,913 --> 01:03:14,832
-Come on, tell me.
-Someone's watched some stuff.

1025
01:03:14,916 --> 01:03:16,125
No, thank you.

1026
01:03:19,003 --> 01:03:20,129
I got one.

1027
01:03:20,838 --> 01:03:21,672
What is it?

1028
01:03:23,174 --> 01:03:24,008
Well…

1029
01:03:25,718 --> 01:03:27,929
It's a bit embarrassing.

1030
01:03:39,857 --> 01:03:41,776
You know what? Never mind.

1031
01:03:41,859 --> 01:03:43,069
I'll go get changed.

1032
01:04:02,672 --> 01:04:05,383
LEE SOO-HO

1033
01:04:10,054 --> 01:04:12,431
The person you are trying to reach
is unavailable…

1034
01:04:18,396 --> 01:04:19,522
Why did you text…

1035
01:04:21,774 --> 01:04:22,900
BOYFRIEND

1036
01:04:23,651 --> 01:04:25,611
GIRLFRIEND

1037
01:04:28,781 --> 01:04:30,283
On my phone,

1038
01:04:30,366 --> 01:04:32,910
I saved your number as "Boyfriend."

1039
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:45,172
It must have sprinkled.

1040
01:04:46,465 --> 01:04:47,425
It must have.

1041
01:04:47,508 --> 01:04:50,553
We don't have an umbrella.
We could have gotten soaked.

1042
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:52,388
Lucky us, I guess.

1043
01:05:07,528 --> 01:05:09,947
-Are you all right?
-That was some bad luck.

1044
01:05:29,550 --> 01:05:30,426
What are you doing?

1045
01:05:31,093 --> 01:05:31,928
Sorry?

1046
01:05:32,511 --> 01:05:33,429
Aren't you coming up?

1047
01:05:34,430 --> 01:05:35,264
I'm coming.

1048
01:05:48,194 --> 01:05:50,613
Wait here. I'll get you some clothes.

1049
01:05:51,364 --> 01:05:52,323
Okay.

1050
01:06:06,545 --> 01:06:07,880
-Want to eat food?
-We could watch TV…

1051
01:06:08,923 --> 01:06:10,007
-Want to watch TV?
-Let's eat.

1052
01:06:11,258 --> 01:06:13,552
Let's eat.
You haven't had dinner yet, right?

1053
01:06:13,636 --> 01:06:14,929
I can make you…

1054
01:06:15,554 --> 01:06:16,973
Or should we just get delivery?

1055
01:06:17,056 --> 01:06:17,890
Sure.

1056
01:06:18,432 --> 01:06:19,976
I'm good with anything.

1057
01:06:20,059 --> 01:06:21,811
-Is pizza okay?
-Yes.

1058
01:06:47,795 --> 01:06:48,921
What is it?

1059
01:06:49,422 --> 01:06:51,048
Hey, what is this room?

1060
01:06:51,716 --> 01:06:54,176
-What?
-It's just locked so well.

1061
01:06:54,260 --> 01:06:56,053
Did you hide something weird in there?

1062
01:06:56,137 --> 01:06:57,179
It's not like that.

1063
01:06:57,263 --> 01:06:59,515
Are there some corpses inside
like in the movies?

1064
01:07:04,603 --> 01:07:05,604
Do you want to see it?

1065
01:07:06,188 --> 01:07:07,898
The passcode has been verified.

1066
01:07:18,993 --> 01:07:20,619
Are you a musician then?

1067
01:07:22,163 --> 01:07:23,664
I wanted to be one before.

1068
01:07:24,582 --> 01:07:25,750
What about now?

1069
01:07:28,169 --> 01:07:29,879
After what happened to Se-yeon,

1070
01:07:31,047 --> 01:07:31,881
I just couldn't.

1071
01:07:33,215 --> 01:07:34,133
It was Se-yeon…

1072
01:07:34,925 --> 01:07:36,427
who taught me how to write music.

1073
01:07:41,932 --> 01:07:43,267
It was hard to look at,

1074
01:07:44,351 --> 01:07:45,811
so I rarely came into this room.

1075
01:07:46,645 --> 01:07:47,480
I'm sorry.

1076
01:07:48,230 --> 01:07:49,148
I shouldn't have…

1077
01:07:49,899 --> 01:07:51,067
But it feels okay.

1078
01:07:53,110 --> 01:07:54,612
Maybe because you're with me.

1079
01:07:58,365 --> 01:08:01,160
Should we tell people that we go out?

1080
01:08:01,243 --> 01:08:03,621
Why all of a sudden?
You wanted to keep it a secret.

1081
01:08:03,704 --> 01:08:07,166
I feel like I pushed things my way
without even asking your opinion.

1082
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:10,461
-What if you get dragged to the rooftop?
-Guess I'll let them.

1083
01:08:11,921 --> 01:08:13,297
I don't care either way.

1084
01:08:13,881 --> 01:08:17,051
It doesn't change the fact
that you're my girlfriend.

1085
01:08:22,306 --> 01:08:24,391
The song you played me before,

1086
01:08:25,267 --> 01:08:26,894
the unreleased song.

1087
01:08:28,312 --> 01:08:29,647
Did you write it?

1088
01:08:30,731 --> 01:08:31,565
Yes.

1089
01:08:32,775 --> 01:08:33,776
The lyrics were…

1090
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:37,488
written by Se-yeon.

1091
01:08:38,489 --> 01:08:39,532
I see.

1092
01:08:41,075 --> 01:08:42,868
The song was really good.

1093
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:50,584
Do you want me to play it?

1094
01:08:51,335 --> 01:08:52,211
Yes.

1095
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:58,425
I quit playing the piano
while learning the first volume of Beyer.

1096
01:08:58,509 --> 01:09:00,177
I haven't played in a while either,

1097
01:09:01,345 --> 01:09:02,972
so don't hold your breath.

1098
01:09:28,914 --> 01:09:30,749
That noise was from outside.

1099
01:09:39,133 --> 01:09:41,385
Is it going to rain?
I can hear the thunder.

1100
01:09:41,468 --> 01:09:42,636
I wonder what's going on.

1101
01:09:52,354 --> 01:09:54,565
This piano sounds amazing.
It's expensive, right?

1102
01:10:01,530 --> 01:10:02,740
I'll go get it right away.

1103
01:10:04,491 --> 01:10:05,326
Wait.

1104
01:10:09,914 --> 01:10:12,583
Jeez, for crying out loud!

1105
01:10:13,292 --> 01:10:14,710
Thank you. Enjoy!

1106
01:10:14,793 --> 01:10:16,212
-Thank you.
-Goodbye.

1107
01:10:32,770 --> 01:10:35,064
I thought I might clean the place for him,

1108
01:10:35,773 --> 01:10:37,524
but it's spotless.

1109
01:10:37,608 --> 01:10:38,901
There's nothing to…

1110
01:10:41,487 --> 01:10:44,365
What's this liquor bottle doing here
at a young student's place?

1111
01:10:45,282 --> 01:10:46,992
Gosh, this is expensive stuff.

1112
01:10:53,290 --> 01:10:54,792
It might have gone bad.

1113
01:10:54,875 --> 01:10:56,794
Trying it is the only way to know.

1114
01:10:58,128 --> 01:11:00,714
Soo-ho, I'll just have a taste, okay?

1115
01:11:01,882 --> 01:11:02,800
Just a pinch.

1116
01:11:45,426 --> 01:11:47,052
Want to watch a movie while we eat?

1117
01:11:47,678 --> 01:11:48,554
Sure.

1118
01:11:52,224 --> 01:11:53,767
It smells good.

1119
01:11:53,851 --> 01:11:54,893
What should we watch?

1120
01:11:55,477 --> 01:11:56,312
Well,

1121
01:11:56,395 --> 01:11:57,688
how about a horror movie?

1122
01:11:58,564 --> 01:11:59,940
We could watch something else.

1123
01:12:00,024 --> 01:12:01,525
Why? You can't watch scary stuff?

1124
01:12:02,693 --> 01:12:06,071
It rained and all, so maybe we can
watch a musical or something.

1125
01:12:06,155 --> 01:12:09,241
What? You, the horror comic nerd,
can't watch horror movies?

1126
01:12:09,325 --> 01:12:11,410
I already read them as comics every day,

1127
01:12:11,493 --> 01:12:13,495
so no need to watch them as movies, right?

1128
01:12:13,579 --> 01:12:16,081
It'll be okay.
I'll cover your eyes if you get scared.

1129
01:12:16,165 --> 01:12:17,666
I'm not that much of a wimp, okay?

1130
01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:19,918
Turn off the lights.
Lights off for horror movies.

1131
01:12:20,002 --> 01:12:21,295
There are other interesting…

1132
01:12:21,378 --> 01:12:25,632
I'm being such a nuisance
when he's on a date with his girlfriend.

1133
01:12:31,013 --> 01:12:32,514
-Here.
-Okay.

1134
01:13:07,841 --> 01:13:09,885
Soo-ho is a man, indeed.

1135
01:13:17,851 --> 01:13:20,020
You really haven't seen horror films,
have you?

1136
01:13:20,104 --> 01:13:22,272
Ghosts don't come out
in these kinds of scenes.

1137
01:13:31,782 --> 01:13:33,117
You said they don't come out.

1138
01:14:29,965 --> 01:14:31,049
Dad?

1139
01:15:12,466 --> 01:15:14,218
-I miss you.
-Me too.

1140
01:15:15,093 --> 01:15:18,222
Since when did you start going out?
Why didn't you tell me?

1141
01:15:18,305 --> 01:15:19,681
Me and Han Seo-jun?

1142
01:15:19,765 --> 01:15:21,141
By the way, Ju-kyung,

1143
01:15:21,225 --> 01:15:23,185
should I tell him how I feel
when I give him this?

1144
01:15:24,228 --> 01:15:27,231
Have you ever liked the same girl
as your best friend?

1145
01:15:27,314 --> 01:15:28,148
No!

1146
01:15:28,649 --> 01:15:29,775
Why are you two coming in together?

1147
01:15:30,359 --> 01:15:34,613
Don't people usually show their boyfriends
old photo albums when they come over?

1148
01:15:35,531 --> 01:15:37,199
I don't like you two talking,

1149
01:15:37,282 --> 01:15:39,076
much less locking eyes.

1150
01:15:39,159 --> 01:15:41,078
-Then we can't see each other?
-Lee Soo-ho!

1151
01:15:42,371 --> 01:15:47,042
