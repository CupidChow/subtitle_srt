1
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,700
  True Beauty  

2
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:12,990


3
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:32,110
  True Beauty  

4
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:53,670
Here, take it.

5
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,740
- Huh? 
 - You said to not ride the motorcycle.

6
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:00,000
Lee Su Ho is coming behind us.

7
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:04,870
Starting from today, I plan to listen only to you.

8
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:10,910
What, what? Is he confessing or what?

9
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:13,090
Does Han Seo Jun like Im Ju Gyeong?

10
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:15,590
Wow.

11
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:18,930
- Hey, Han Seo Jun. 
 - Don't go.

12
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:24,640
- Wait. 
 - I said don't go.

13
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,520
Why?

14
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,310
Because I have something to say.

15
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,930
Something to say?

16
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:46,840
What do you have to say?

17
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:53,850
- That... 
 - "That?"

18
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:56,950
The Indian Ocean dipole and El Niño phenomena were pointed out as the cause of the Australian wildfires.

19
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:00,090
What do you think about the relationship between the two?

20
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:02,960
What, what Niño?

21
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,960
  Episode 5 

22
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:08,980
 Hey, hey. 

23
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:15,840
Take it back. Why are you giving it to me?

24
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,910
If I'm not going to ride my motorcycle, you should have it.

25
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:23,400
- Why? Because I'm... going to listen to you only. 
 - Wow.

26
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,930
Are you perhaps taking revenge right now?

27
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:27,660
Because I threatened you with a picture of you riding your motorcycle?

28
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:30,800
No way, what do you mean by revenge?

29
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:38,010
I grabbed this on the way. Drink it.

30
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:42,510
I like strawberry.

31
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:49,730
Im Ju, what's with him? Why is he doing that all of a sudden?

32
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:51,870
And what's with the motorcycle key?

33
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,040
Han Seo Jun.

34
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:09,940
Catch!

35
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,570
What's this? What?

36
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:18,630
What? What is it?

37
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:20,440
What is it?

38
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:26,780
- That's awesome.
 - Go home and practice.

39
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:29,270
Su Ho, do you want to eat lunch togeth—

40
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:31,980
Eat well.

41
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,670
When did he put this back in my pocket?

42
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:46,150
If there's no other seat, sit here.

43
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:52,860
Oh... Thanks.

44
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:06,570
- I thought you weren't going to drink this. 
 - It's not like I can throw it away.

45
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:08,930
You drink it.

46
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:11,380
Thank you.

47
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:19,330
Okay! Everybody in your seats!

48
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:21,190
Okay!

49
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,210
I will take attendance.

50
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:25,410
Yes!

51
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:27,630
- Kim Si Hyeon? 
 - Here!

52
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:29,860
- Kim Ji Eun? 
 - Here.

53
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:32,230
- Kim Sol? 
 - Here.

54
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,110
- Kim Seo Eun? 
 - Here.

55
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:36,330
- Cha Jin Yeong? 
 - Here.

56
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:38,540
- Kim Do Hun? 
 - Here.

57
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:42,190
- Park Jun Hyeong? 
 - Here.

58
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:45,300
When this organic matter is decomposed by enzymes,

59
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:49,790
it means that minerals are made and energy is gained in the process.

60
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:53,200
Part of this energy is stored in ATP,

61
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:57,250
and the rest is released as thermal energy.

62
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,710
In this process...

63
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:02,250
It will appear.

64
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:29,690
  Did he perhaps... buy it because I said I liked it? 

65
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:40,420
After accumulating the energy, it's going to use it when needed.

66
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:44,670
Ju Gyeong, let's sit together.

67
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:46,320
- Sorry. 
 - How could you do that to my angel?!

68
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,140
Han Seo Jun, seriously!

69
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,290
Hey, Han Seo Jun. If you're going to torment Ju Gyeong, get lost.

70
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:55,980
I'm only going to listen to what Ju Gyeong says.

71
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:59,030
I'm only going to listen!

72
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Then... I have a favor.

73
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:07,300
Just say it.

74
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,360
Can you please get lost?

75
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,280
What?

76
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:14,830
I'll listen to everything but that.

77
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:18,340
Your wish is my command!

78
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:22,100
Then don't talk to me.

79
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,010
Except that too.

80
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:26,910
What's that coming out of your mouth, words or farts?

81
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,260
You don't like this, huh?

82
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,420
My favorite side dish.

83
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:40,380
- I was going to save it for last!
 - Why would you?

84
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,510
Why do you care about my eating habits?

85
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:44,150
Okay.

86
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,990
I'll listen to you. Hey, hey.

87
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,130
- Fried pork cutlets. 
 - Fried pork cutlets!

88
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:54,640
Ta-da!

89
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,500
You want me to eat all of this?

90
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,860
Is it flirting or fighting? I have no words.

91
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:07,440
You need to eat a lot to grow tall.

92
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:11,100
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

93
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,510
You shouldn't eat your hair.

94
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:19,320
Hey~

95
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:28,290
Take your key back. You better not secretly put it back.

96
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:31,360
What's the point of giving back my key?

97
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,130
When my motorcycle is in front of your house.

98
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:38,850
Gross.

99
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:42,780
Oh no!

100
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,140
- Ju Gyeong, you did well! 
 - What do I do?

101
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:51,570
I'm seriously sorry.

102
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:04,400
Im Ju Gyeong. Your tail is freaking long.

103
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,920
- White-tailed monkey. 
 - Stop making fun of me.

104
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,470
Okay, okay. I need to listen to you.

105
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:38,400
Why did you grab me? Huh? Because of you, I fell!

106
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,230
- If I saved you...! 
 - Don't save me!

107
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:45,270
And please take back your key as I said.

108
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,380
I just want to attend school quietly.

109
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:51,940
Are you okay?

110
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:55,190
Yeah.

111
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:58,300
- What was she thinking?
 - You got rejected.

112
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,270
- Hey, she's doing that because she fell for me! 
 - Drag him. Let's go.

113
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:01,770
Seo Jun is feeling off!

114
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:06,150
♫ The help I've received in my lifetime

115
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:11,250
♫ Those many helping hands

116
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:18,490
♫ Like the sun shining brightly,

117
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:28,480
♫ I'll shine.

118
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,010
Brava! Brava.

119
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:36,330
I thought that Maria Callas had come back to life.

120
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:39,890
As expected, our Go Woon's voice enters

121
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:43,090
our ears perfectly, right?

122
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:46,220
 Congratulazioni! (Congratulations in Italian) 

123
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:53,060
The solo for this performance is you, Han Go Woon.

124
00:09:53,700 --> 00:10:03,300
♫  In the wide wilderness, considered to be a petal that bloomed by itself  ♫

125
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,540
She's really good at singing.

126
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,270
Get out.

127
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:20,020
Hey, I told you that I wouldn't leave you alone if you sang properly, right?

128
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:29,180
How dare such a joke like you? You're not really doing this because you want the solo, right?

129
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:34,000
Tell the teacher immediately that you can't do it.

130
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:42,700
These jerks.

131
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:45,130
How could you slap a friend?

132
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:13,960
Do you have private tutoring today too?

133
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,360
Yeah. Unfortunately two sessions.

134
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,910
Amazing.

135
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:22,830
- What's with your hands? 
 - What do you mean?

136
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:25,800
It's not even winter, but your hand is all chapped.

137
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:29,870
Wait. Put your hand out like this.

138
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:35,590
You have honey-like skin on your face, but what's with your hand?

139
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:37,770
- What are you doing? 
 - You know me, right?

140
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:40,210
That I'm Pandora's daughter.

141
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:41,980
Done!

142
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:45,360
How is it? The scent is good, right?

143
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,070
Yeah, it's nice.

144
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,810
Hey!

145
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,490
Wow.

146
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,330
Wow, you're seriously something.

147
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:25,300
Oh, right, right. I thought I knew you.

148
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:27,240
Hey, I'm really sorry.

149
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,740
  Can she not recognize me? 

150
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:31,790
But... You kind of...

151
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:35,000
Let's get off. Driver, we're getting off!

152
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,010
You should move for us to pass.

153
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:50,260
- What's with her rudeness? 
 - Who is she?

154
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:53,440
I don't know. I follow her on Instagram.

155
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,030
Because I see her every day, I thought I knew her.

156
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:56,630
You were about to get really embarrassed.

157
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:59,800
But she's so rude. Who is she?

158
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,710
Why are you so scared?

159
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:09,150
Do you know her?

160
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,470
Just...

161
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:18,420
They just seemed like... troublemakers.

162
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:20,690
Hey, why do you have to be scared?

163
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:22,570
They act more obnoxious if you look scared.

164
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:25,360
Next time, come off stronger. Okay?

165
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:54,030
 Lose 

166
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:02,630
What? I'll only listen to you?

167
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:11,740
I ...

168
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:15,730
should have left Seoul.

169
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:20,980
I made her a promise.
   (TN: From the drama Crash Landing on You) 

170
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:24,910
That as long as I can see her...

171
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:26,990
I will protect her.

172
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:32,330
You jerk!

173
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:37,470
Woman, do you wish for your ribs to be broken 'revolutionarily'?  (another quote from Crash Landing On You) 

174
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:41,150
If you don't want to crash land into hell, you better get off.

175
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:43,230
- Hurry! 
 - Hey, hey, it's expensive.

176
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:46,580
If he put it here, what am I supposed to do?!

177
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:52,030
  What are you doing? 

178
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:58,540
    
 Are you sleeping? 

179
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,800
 Im Ju Gyeong 

180
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,760
 Im Ju Gyeong 

181
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,240
  Im Ju Gyeong 

182
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:29,340
 Hey! Come out quickly! 

183
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:32,720
 She's taking so long because she has to take off her cakey makeup. 

184
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,610
 Hello? 

185
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:36,110
Isn't this Im Ju Gyeong's phone?

186
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:38,170
She's showering right now.

187
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:41,610
- Who are you? 
 - I'm someone who will be showering soon.

188
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:48,710
Hey, Ju Daeng! Flush after you pee and turn the vent on when you poop.   (TN: "Daeng" is a word play on the word for idiot) 

189
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:51,330
What do you care about my pee and poop?

190
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:53,550
 I should really rip your mouth. 

191
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:56,410
What's this? Why are you answering my phone calls?

192
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:57,660
  Lee Su Ho 

193
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:01,310
Lee Su Ho?

194
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:28,290
 Lee Su Ho 

195
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:37,450
 Im Ju Gyeong 

196
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:43,470
Yeah?

197
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:47,730
Yeah, I ended the call without knowing.

198
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:50,500
- Was that your younger brother? 
 - Yeah.

199
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,480
Younger brother.

200
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,460
- Why did you...? 
 - You know...

201
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:56,080
Sorry. You go first.

202
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,900
- Can you come out for a bit? 
 - Right now?

203
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:00,840
To receive my clothing.

204
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:05,000
Ah, your clothing!

205
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,180
Okay, I'll be there soon. See you at the playground.

206
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:19,590
I got goosebumps.

207
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:29,450
What?

208
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,900
- Did you wait long?  
 - No.

209
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:00,690
He seems to like you, though he was acting fierce.

210
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:04,020
He’s a totally fierce cat, always on high alert.

211
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:08,040
I fed him everyday begging for affection and it worked.

212
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,560
Now, even to a cat...

213
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:13,120
You're so nosy to everyone.

214
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:18,370
But still, it's a pity he's by himself just because he's prickly.

215
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:22,030
Like me.

216
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,360
You must know you're prickly.

217
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:34,250
But at least you have a family. He...

218
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:36,070
I don't have a family.

219
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:42,680
You live alone then?

220
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,990
Yeah. Alone.

221
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:47,170
Then, food at your home...

222
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:53,020
Sorry. I said something unnecessary.

223
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:55,070
It's okay.

224
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:57,150
But why did you wear makeup?

225
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,440
I mean, earlier...

226
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,740
That...

227
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,750
Your younger brother said you were taking a shower.

228
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:12,430
I usually take a shower right before I sleep.

229
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:15,490
- I should do it when I get back. 
 - I see.

230
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:19,750
But you came all the way here to get your clothing?

231
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:23,640
Of course. At night...

232
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,850
- Would there be another reason to come besides getting my clothing back?
- That's true.

233
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:30,340
It's a clothing that I cherish a lot and have an attachment for.

234
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:32,460
Really?

235
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:36,710
I'm... really sorry. I'm sorry.

236
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:39,780
To be honest, your clothing isn't dry yet.

237
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:43,910
You came all the way here for nothing.

238
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,770
Well, it can't be helped.

239
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:50,450
Thanks. I'll buy you something really delicious next time.

240
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:59,340
Then... bye.

241
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:04,630
Hey...

242
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:07,810
Huh?

243
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:09,630
There's a basketball.

244
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,590
What'd I do?

245
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:25,390
But it's unexpected!

246
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:28,440
Since you seem like you'd just study.

247
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:32,290
Can you also shoot it in?

248
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:45,760
- It's because it is a bit deflated. 
 - Really?

249
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:51,230
Wow! Did you see that? Did you?

250
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:53,300
Now, look here.

251
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:57,390
The left hand is for support only.  (a famous quote from manga 'Slam Dunk'.)  You put too much tension in your left hand.

252
00:21:57,390 --> 00:21:59,200
Like this.

253
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:03,070
I was captain of our basketball team until last year.

254
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:05,780
But then why aren't you participating in the tournament this time?

255
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:07,020
Just because.

256
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:10,330
Isn't it because you got cut? Because you can't put in shots?

257
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:12,300
I told you that the left hand is for support only. Like this.

258
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:14,240
That darn left hand.

259
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,050
If you see me play basketball, you'll faint.

260
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:22,660
I told you to support.

261
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,070
That...

262
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:15,400
How was it?

263
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:20,110
- What...was? The hug?
 - The scent.

264
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:24,010
I changed my detergent yesterday.

265
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:25,220
Detergent?

266
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:28,650
Because it said the scent wouldn't go away even while exercising.

267
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:30,940
Checking the effectiveness.

268
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:34,850
Oh, yeah, the scent is nice.

269
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:39,440
But why is your face...?

270
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,240
Was it you guys?

271
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:02,410
- What are you doing? 
 - How do I smell?

272
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:05,540
- I changed my laundry detergent. 
 - Citrus?

273
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:12,310
- It’s nice and refreshing. 
 - Really?

274
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:17,830
This is nice. Is it a foreign brand?

275
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:19,600
Stay still.

276
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:24,260
So sudden...

277
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:29,300
 What a flustering way of checking the effectiveness of his new detergent. 

278
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:32,050
 Crazy guy... Why did I bring up detergent fragrance? 

279
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:36,910
By the way... you don’t have to walk me home.

280
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:40,790
The bus stop across from your house is closer to my house.

281
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:44,840
I thought...

282
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:12,510
Here we are.

283
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:15,440
Yeah, it seems like it.

284
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:20,480
Then, I’ll head in from here.  Get home safe.

285
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,230
I should get that thing before I go.

286
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:27,200
Your clothes? They’re not dried yet.

287
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,430
No, the motorcycle key.

288
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:32,230
I’ll return it to him for you.

289
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:35,400
No, I’ll do it! In case you guys fight again.

290
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:38,580
It’s okay. Don’t worry.

291
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:48,650
Did he already return the key?

292
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:51,540
They probably didn’t fight, right?

293
00:25:57,910 --> 00:26:02,380
Lee Su Ho, Han Seo Jun’s bike was completely gone this morning.

294
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:03,840
Oh really?

295
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:07,010
Nice throw.

296
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:10,530
Oh, nice throw!

297
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:16,290
You’re really good at embracing.

298
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:17,540
Huh?

299
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:21,470
Huh? I- I meant that you’re good at catching things!

300
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:24,120
Good at catching balls.

301
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:27,590
Did you see that, man?

302
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:31,310
You think that's basketball? You’re the worst in the school basketball team but super overacting.

303
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:32,910
Just you wait until the next game.

304
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:37,030
Do you think our Saebom Devils will lose to any of the grades' teams?

305
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:39,730
- Just anyone?  
 - I mean, you.

306
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:43,680
God Su Ho is returning to basketball!

307
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:46,140
L-Lee Su Ho is playing?  Wh- Why is he suddenly?

308
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:49,610
- Really? 
 - Whoa!

309
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:51,210
Apparently he’s playing in a basketball game.

310
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:54,560
Who can play against that height?

311
00:26:56,380 --> 00:27:00,290
Seo Jun, you play a little, right?

312
00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:05,610
What? Why? Do you think I’d be good?

313
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:07,200
I’m freaking amazing.

314
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,180
Of course, you’re freaking amazing! Then for this year's school festival,

315
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:14,940
shouldn’t you play for our grade team and show off those freaking amazing skills?

316
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:19,430
Well then, you should ask Im Ju Gyeong.

317
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:23,000
I’m only listening to what she says.

318
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,580
Oh, I’ll only listen to you!

319
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,490
Im Ju Gyeong, want to see me play basketball?

320
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:33,350
No. Not at all.

321
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:35,050
Not at all?

322
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:39,250
Ju Gyeong, please tell him to play. I don’t want to lose to that guy!

323
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:43,720
Ugh, I don’t care, do it or don’t.

324
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:46,140
Your wish is my command.

325
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,670
I’m playing in the basketball game.

326
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:50,650
Okay! Thank you!

327
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:54,760
Just have to take it easy, like this.

328
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,570
- Sir, right this way! 
 - That’s it, right?

329
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:58,550
- Yes! Let’s go! 
 -Let’s go.

330
00:27:58,550 --> 00:28:00,490
Don’t act up.

331
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:02,300
Does he have a crush on you?

332
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:04,770
He wouldn’t act this way just because you took a photo of him riding his motorcycle.

333
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:09,650
Whether he likes her or he’s just teasing her, he’s so childish.

334
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:12,490
I’ll never be able to understand Lee Su Ho.

335
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:15,560
- Look at his playing volleyball by himself. 
 - It’s handball.

336
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:18,960
Oh, right. Look at him go.

337
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:21,930
Ugh, it’s so hot.

338
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:24,120
Why does this girl make me feel like I’m playing lotto?

339
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,700
She’s totally different from what I expected.

340
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:33,040
Hello? Yes, that’s me.

341
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,810
What?! Towing?!

342
00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:38,580
Look at this, Im Ju Gyeong.

343
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:41,940
Hey, Im Ju Gyeong— Ouch!

344
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:49,380
- What’s your deal? 
 - You’re on duty today.

345
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,710
Childish bastard.

346
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:55,970
Don’t you want to go get your motorcycle?

347
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:59,890
Ah, so you’re the one who reported it?

348
00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:03,400
- You must have lost your mind. 
 - For your information, your key is with me.

349
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,150
Damn it.

350
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:12,530
Hey! Kids from other schools are coming to the show.

351
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:15,430
What will they think of our choir club if you do the solo looking like this?

352
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:17,680
Why can’t I do the solo?

353
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,640
You still don’t understand what I’m saying.

354
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:23,590
You can’t do it because you’re ugly, bitch.

355
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:30,600
Are you crazy?! Why would you splash dirty mop water on me?!

356
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,090
Because your mouth is so filthy, I figured we needed to wash it.

357
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:35,420
Who do you think you are to speak to your classmate like that?

358
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:38,720
Is looking pretty outside all that matters, even if your insides are filthy and disgusting?

359
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:42,760
You’re a grade 11? Who the hell are you to throw a f**king fit?

360
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,240
Me?

361
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:52,350
I’m her sister! Why? What about it?

362
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:55,950
Go Woon!

363
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:59,590
Ugh, what’s up with that crazy bitch?

364
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:03,190
- What bitch? 
 - And who’s this bitch, too?

365
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:11,220
Ah, I missed.

366
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:15,920
If I catch you like this again, I’ll make those silicone fillers come out of your nose.

367
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:31,500
 Because. You're. Ugly. 

368
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,390
Here.

369
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:55,220
Like they said...

370
00:30:56,030 --> 00:30:58,890
Do you think that there are people who are meant to be on stage?

371
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:03,510
No way. You got the solo because you’re talented.

372
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:05,700
I heard you singing.

373
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:10,100
I thought that I could make it with just my talent.

374
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:13,700
But what if the audience laughs at me just like those girls?

375
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:19,770
I’m afraid that my voice won’t be taken seriously because of my face.

376
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:23,430
The ones laughing at you are in the wrong. Don’t give up.

377
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:25,980
Don’t run away because you’re afraid.

378
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:30,770
You’re pretty, so...

379
00:31:30,770 --> 00:31:33,140
You probably don’t understand how I’m feeling.

380
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:40,130
  No, to be honest, I relate to you more than anyone else.  

381
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:52,650
  When applying eyeshadow, you need to be aware of the inner and outer corners of your eye.  

382
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:56,790
Oh, this kind of look would be pretty on Go Woon.

383
00:31:56,790 --> 00:32:01,160
  The width of your eye shape can be determined by how you apply your makeup.  

384
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,580
Like this...

385
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:09,290
- What are you watching? 
 - Oh, a makeup tutorial.

386
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:13,480
Actually, there’s a girl that I met coincidentally.

387
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:17,490
She’s going through a bit of a hard time.

388
00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:20,320
So I’m just just trying to see if there’s a way for me to help her out.

389
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,950
You’re so nosy.

390
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:25,960
Right...? Nosy...

391
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:30,390
But that nosiness can help make someone stronger.

392
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:37,380
Actually, she really reminds me of my old self.

393
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:41,160
That must be why I feel particularly bad for her.

394
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:44,410
Of course, my bare face is uglier than hers is.

395
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:48,090
- I don’t think so. 
 - Huh?

396
00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:50,480
You’re pretty without makeup.

397
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:00,030
  The bus will be arriving shortly.   
 - The bus is here.

398
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:01,430
Yeah.

399
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:24,750
No way...

400
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:27,970
Hey, no way.

401
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:36,130
    
 Hey everyone, a guy pulled me in for a hug and asked my opinion about his laundry detergent. 

402
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:38,800
  And he told me that he thinks I’m pretty. What does this mean?  

403
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,450
  He likes you! He wanted to hug you so he used his detergent as an excuse.  

404
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:43,570
  - Yeah, he likes you, 100% sure. 
 - Something seems suspicious about the laundry excuse. 

405
00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:45,690
  - Is he a player? 
 - Ask him out on a date! 

406
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:48,350
  If a guy isn’t interested in you, he’ll never spend his money or time on you.  

407
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:51,320
Ask him out on a date?

408
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:55,380
No, I can’t! Never.

409
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:59,300
 yesyes1213: Ask him out on a date! If a guy isn’t interested in you, he’ll never spend his money or time on you. 

410
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:01,100
  Lee Su Ho  

411
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:10,040
Why do I just say things without my brain stopping me?

412
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:21,670
  From Im Ju Gyeong: Are you getting home okay?  

413
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:26,580
  My sister gave me some free movie tickets.  

414
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:34,130
  After the festival tomorrow, do you want to see a movie with me if you have time to spare?  

415
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:40,190
  Message read  

416
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:42,110
He read it!

417
00:34:57,550 --> 00:35:00,220
  Sure, let’s do it.  

418
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,750
Ah, she scared me.

419
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:06,430
What is she doing?

420
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:09,720
♫  I wouldn't know why I'm like this  ♫

421
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,860
No way.

422
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:16,080
Lee Su Ho... me...?

423
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:21,700
What do I do? What do I do?!

424
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,860
♫  I know it's not really playing hard to get  ♫

425
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:26,060
♫  I have the unfamiliar feeling of swooning  ♫

426
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:30,030
♫  I’m feeling good, like on the moon  ♫

427
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:33,870
♫  I just think I can go anywhere  ♫

428
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:37,480
♫  Now that we are a twosome  ♫

429
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:40,170
 But what movie shall we watch? 

430
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:45,370
 Is there something you want to watch? 

431
00:35:45,370 --> 00:35:47,470
 What about a horror movie? 

432
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:52,800
♫  You and I are leaving tonight  ♫

433
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:57,020
♫  Baby, whisper only to me. Call me tonight  ♫

434
00:35:57,020 --> 00:36:01,440
♫  I will melt sweeter  ♫

435
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:05,160
♫  In the time you are considering, just call me tonight  ♫

436
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:08,090
♫  There's only one chance  ♫

437
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:11,950
♫  Call me maybe you  ♫

438
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:14,560
 Okay. See you tomorrow. 

439
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,920
 Han Seo Jun 

440
00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:22,030
 Lee Su Ho, where are you? 

441
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,610
You sure are doing lots of things.

442
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:32,580
Give me the key.

443
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:37,620
I like Im Ju Gyeong.

444
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:40,580
Is that so? Do you want me to congratulate you?

445
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:43,360
Don't use Im Ju Gyeong because of me.

446
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,510
What if I'm not using her?

447
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:47,390
Then are you saying you're being genuine?

448
00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:51,610
Why? Are you nervous I'll steal her from you?

449
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:57,110
Mr. Han Jun Woo.

450
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,010
Oh, hello.

451
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:02,290
What brings you here?

452
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:04,000
To receive my money.

453
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,230
What?

454
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:07,120
You said you'll pay me.

455
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,870
I came to get it personally.

456
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:10,330
Ah! Right.

457
00:37:10,330 --> 00:37:13,360
Of course I should pay you for your troubles. Here...

458
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:17,030
I'm out of cash right now...

459
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:19,750
How much were you planning to give me?

460
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:22,860
The money that you were going to give to me, I'll buy it

461
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:24,840
as your time.

462
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:33,590
Sun is down.

463
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:36,790
What should we do for two hours?

464
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:44,240
So you work for Move Entertainment?

465
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,340
Yes.

466
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:47,070
I think you're amazing.

467
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:49,820
I don't know much,

468
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:52,830
but I have some students who dream of becoming an idol.

469
00:37:52,830 --> 00:37:55,630
So I know it's not easy working in the entertainment field.

470
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:59,240
Then... was your original dream to be in this field?

471
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:01,620
It's the first time someone has asked me that question.

472
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:03,780
Usually, they ask which celebrities I've seen

473
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:05,970
or if the rumors are true.

474
00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:09,100
If you know what kind of dream they had

475
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:12,360
then I think you get a glimpse of what kind of person they actually are.

476
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:16,440
Are you Little Prince?

477
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,440
No, I'm not.

478
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:20,710
You're a rare naive man.

479
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:23,530
Your food is here.

480
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:29,370
Didn't you order aioli pasta?

481
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:31,880
I'm sorry. I'll prepare it again.

482
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:35,580
No, it's okay. I'll just eat this.

483
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:37,040
It looks delicious!

484
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,080
Looking at it, it looks tastier.

485
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:41,100
Thank you. Enjoy your food.

486
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:42,890
Thank you.

487
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:44,490
Please eat.

488
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,890
Why did you do that when you can't eat spicy food?

489
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:02,190
You should have asked her to change it.

490
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:04,210
It's okay.

491
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:06,600
How flustered

492
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:10,240
must that young part-timer be?

493
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:17,030
You're quite a handful.

494
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:21,680
I'm sorry.

495
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,940
I spit on you...

496
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:26,130
Your eye...

497
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:29,380
I'm sorry. It was a bit spicy so...

498
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:32,010
I don't like playing hard-to-get.

499
00:39:32,010 --> 00:39:35,410
And I can't play cutesy to get a guy.

500
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:37,390
I'll be honest.

501
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:39,620
I've fallen for you.

502
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:41,160
What?

503
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:43,250
  Hey, what's this? 

504
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:46,760
 Okay, okay. 

505
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:50,520
 What is this? 

506
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:52,560
 What is that? 

507
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,770
  What's with her face? 

508
00:39:53,770 --> 00:39:55,470
  Why are they like this? 

509
00:39:55,470 --> 00:39:57,910
  Is something on my face? 

510
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:04,420
 What do I do?! 

511
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:06,790
  Did I come bare-faced? 

512
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:36,730
 In my eyes, your bare face is pretty too. 

513
00:40:55,790 --> 00:40:57,750
It was a dream.

514
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:03,150
But a pig dream is a good dream.

515
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:10,470
Something good is going to happen.  I dreamed of a pig riding a white horse.

516
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:22,440
Jeez, that alcohol smell!

517
00:41:26,490 --> 00:41:29,290
Our daughter is okay, right?

518
00:41:29,290 --> 00:41:32,000
Of course, I'm okay!

519
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,590
Has she lost it?

520
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:41,540
- How about your sister? 
 - She's drunk and out.

521
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:44,390
Our eldest daughter is always working overtime and having company dinners.

522
00:41:44,390 --> 00:41:46,290
She'll hurt her health.

523
00:41:46,290 --> 00:41:49,030
- Shall I give her a tonic? 
 - You're always worrying about the kids.

524
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:51,560
You should think about your health, too.

525
00:41:56,110 --> 00:41:57,560
- But Dad... 
 - Hm?

526
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:00,350
What did you like about Mom that you married her?

527
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:02,300
She's pretty.

528
00:42:02,990 --> 00:42:05,530
Really?

529
00:42:05,530 --> 00:42:07,360
Mom is pretty in your eyes?

530
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:09,740
Even without makeup?

531
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:11,440
Even with her face like this?

532
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:14,820
Are you making fun of me?

533
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:17,240
No, Dad used to be able to beat Terius,  (a reference from manga, 'Candy, Candy') 

534
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:20,530
but I wonder how he happened to like Hong Hyeon Suk, leaving all those numerous Candies behind.

535
00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:25,980
To me, your mother was the wild rose girl, Candy.

536
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:28,230
- Really? 
 - You mean the wild rose clique?

537
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:30,350
She was the black rose clique.

538
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:36,350
What's pretty about this face?

539
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:53,320
Did the lines of my face change these days?

540
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:56,510
I don't know~

541
00:42:56,510 --> 00:42:58,470
 Saebom Festival 

542
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:18,720
What's that? What's that?

543
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:27,610
I didn't know because I didn't come last year

544
00:43:27,610 --> 00:43:29,980
but a festival is like this.

545
00:43:30,810 --> 00:43:34,010
- Accept this balloon. It's my heart. 
 - Thank you.

546
00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:36,570
My girlfriend came. My future girlfriend.

547
00:43:36,570 --> 00:43:38,430
Shall I ask for her phone number?

548
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:45,640
 What do you think of the movie 'Voice of Ghost'? 

549
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:48,110
He hasn't read my texts.

550
00:43:48,110 --> 00:43:50,250
Is he still at home?

551
00:43:55,210 --> 00:43:56,910
Who's that?

552
00:43:56,910 --> 00:44:00,450
Isn't that Han Go Woon? What's with her face?

553
00:44:00,450 --> 00:44:02,360
Go Woon!

554
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:04,860
No. No, Go Woon.

555
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:07,600
  Hey, Han Go Woon, you... 

556
00:44:09,790 --> 00:44:10,850
What's going on?

557
00:44:10,850 --> 00:44:13,320
Hey. Look over there!

558
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:23,960
Time, time, time. Hey, Han Seo Jun, are you angry about something?

559
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:26,980
- I don't know.
 - Where are you going? You have to be the billboard.

560
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:28,780
- Billboard?
 - The face billboard.

561
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:31,110
You need to be here so the girls will line up.

562
00:44:31,110 --> 00:44:35,080
- I'm going to go see my cutie. 
 - What cutie?

563
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:38,460
How are you playing the water balloon game?

564
00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:44,760
This is my first time doing makeup for someone else, so I'm not confident.

565
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:46,120
But let's try it!

566
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:49,400
You shouldn't ruin your show because of the kids who judge you by your looks.

567
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:54,800
But... do I look really weird?

568
00:44:54,800 --> 00:45:00,240
You're pretty. You're pretty, but let's change it a little bit.

569
00:45:05,610 --> 00:45:07,970
If you groom your brows well,

570
00:45:07,970 --> 00:45:10,600
it'll make your whole look cleaner.

571
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:13,760
Using grayish brown eye shadow

572
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:16,650
we'll add depth.

573
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:20,050
So they can see the glamour even on the stage,

574
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:22,530
we'll add some glitter.

575
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:38,520
Guys, don't be nervous.

576
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:41,030
Breathe in deeply and then!

577
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:43,770
Good, good.

578
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:48,440
Bu why isn't Go Woon here? We're next.

579
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:51,930
Teacher! Then is it okay if I sing in her stead—

580
00:45:51,930 --> 00:45:56,440
Teacher, I'm here.

581
00:45:58,830 --> 00:46:00,450
Hey, this will be counted as a volunteering point, right?

582
00:46:00,450 --> 00:46:02,490
That's why we got together.

583
00:46:02,490 --> 00:46:04,910
You promised this will be counted for sure.

584
00:46:04,910 --> 00:46:07,650
You came? Have fun.

585
00:46:07,650 --> 00:46:09,170
What are you saying?

586
00:46:09,170 --> 00:46:11,120
Hello.

587
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:13,810
- She's so pretty. 
 - What are you talking about?

588
00:46:30,690 --> 00:46:32,760
Who is that?

589
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:34,930
Was there always a pretty girl like her there?

590
00:46:38,250 --> 00:46:43,260
♫ The world

591
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:48,520
♫ turned its back on me.

592
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:53,650
♫ That I'm a loner

593
00:46:53,650 --> 00:46:59,010
♫ I wanted to believe

594
00:46:59,010 --> 00:47:04,050
♫ My own

595
00:47:04,050 --> 00:47:09,320
♫ illusion

596
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:14,850
♫ Although I knew that

597
00:47:14,850 --> 00:47:21,020
♫ I always avoided it

598
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:23,600
♫ In the wide wilderness

599
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:26,260
♫ Considered to be a petal

600
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:31,460
♫ That bloomed by itself

601
00:47:31,460 --> 00:47:34,070
♫ In my chest

602
00:47:34,070 --> 00:47:39,290
♫ Inside my empty heart

603
00:47:39,290 --> 00:47:41,930
♫ I kept it.

604
00:47:41,930 --> 00:47:44,170
♫ The rough rain and wind

605
00:47:44,170 --> 00:47:47,100
♫ After it storms

606
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:52,010
♫ Like how the clear sun will rise

607
00:47:52,010 --> 00:47:54,620
♫ My heart also

608
00:47:54,620 --> 00:47:57,940
♫ My surroundings also

609
00:47:57,940 --> 00:48:02,780
♫ Everything will be clear

610
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:05,440
♫ Everybody in my life

611
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:08,040
♫ Who has strengthened me

612
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:13,640
♫ The many touches

613
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:21,900
♫ Like the sun that revealed me

614
00:48:23,090 --> 00:48:32,420
♫ Become light

615
00:48:49,820 --> 00:48:51,980
You worked hard!

616
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:54,470
The class of our Go Woon!

617
00:48:54,470 --> 00:48:57,520
You were so pretty! You worked hard.

618
00:48:58,850 --> 00:49:01,050
Unni!

619
00:49:01,910 --> 00:49:03,360
Unni.

620
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:06,250
- You really were the best. 
 - Thank you, Unni.

621
00:49:06,250 --> 00:49:08,600
I didn't do much.

622
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:10,450
Oppa!

623
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:14,520
Han Seo Jun?

624
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:16,780
You two know each other?

625
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:18,400
You know my brother?

626
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:22,890
Oppa? Do you mean biological brother?

627
00:49:22,890 --> 00:49:26,440
Ju Gyeong! Ju Gyeong, help me.

628
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:30,130
- Kang Su suddenly said she can't come. I need you. 
 - Oh, okay.

629
00:49:30,130 --> 00:49:31,300
Go Woon, I'll see you later.

630
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:33,370
Okay!

631
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:37,090
How do you know Im Ju Gyeong?

632
00:49:39,250 --> 00:49:43,100
You...! Why did you come all dressed up? Who are you trying to look good for?

633
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:44,940
To be honest.

634
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:48,180
Never mind. I'll tell you later.

635
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:50,800
Oh come on, you won’t even tell me.

636
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,250
Here!

637
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:56,650
A pig?

638
00:49:56,650 --> 00:50:00,070
Why? You don't want to? Then do you want to be the rabbit?

639
00:50:00,070 --> 00:50:02,170
No. I like pigs.

640
00:50:02,170 --> 00:50:03,250
I really like them!

641
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:05,780
What the heck, then come to the basketball court after you change.

642
00:50:05,780 --> 00:50:07,650
I’ll buy some drinks and meet you there.

643
00:50:07,650 --> 00:50:09,420
See you later.

644
00:50:23,540 --> 00:50:25,270
You came?

645
00:50:25,270 --> 00:50:28,250
Did you sleep well? How's your condition?

646
00:50:28,250 --> 00:50:32,630
You know how I told you about the girl who's similar to me?

647
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:36,610
Are you hurting somewhere?

648
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:40,580
Did something happen?

649
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:45,340
What's wrong?

650
00:50:45,340 --> 00:50:46,910
What do you mean?

651
00:50:46,910 --> 00:50:48,730
We said we were going to watch a movie today.

652
00:50:48,730 --> 00:50:51,170
Why would I watch a movie with you?

653
00:50:52,010 --> 00:50:54,340
- What?
 - Don't misunderstand.

654
00:50:54,340 --> 00:50:57,180
I just treated you well out of pity.

655
00:51:01,910 --> 00:51:06,330
Why... am I pitiful?

656
00:51:08,510 --> 00:51:10,890
Because you know my secret?

657
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:16,180
Did you pity me because I got on my knees and cried in front of you?

658
00:51:16,180 --> 00:51:17,710
Yeah.

659
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:23,640
So that's why you told me I was pretty and took care of me.

660
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:25,910
Like looking after a stray cat. Because you pitied me.

661
00:51:25,910 --> 00:51:31,360
Yeah. But now I'm tired of it and annoyed.

662
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:36,510
I don't want to care about you anymore, so get out.

663
00:51:37,770 --> 00:51:41,180
I didn't know but you're really nosy, too.

664
00:51:41,180 --> 00:51:45,920
Did I ask you to care for me? Did I?

665
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:52,820
I won't bother you anymore, so you also shouldn't pity me.

666
00:52:11,830 --> 00:52:15,890
  It hasn’t even been that long since my life started to feel like a dream.  

667
00:52:15,890 --> 00:52:21,310
  I forgot my place and got ahead of myself with an empty dream.  

668
00:52:21,310 --> 00:52:23,950
  It was all just a silly dream, anyway.  

669
00:52:23,950 --> 00:52:26,290
  I acted so stupid.  

670
00:52:43,670 --> 00:52:46,040
  Don't use Im Ju Gyeong because of me. 

671
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:48,320
  What if I'm not using her? 

672
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:50,180
  Then are you saying you're being genuine? 

673
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:53,700
 Why? Are you nervous I'll steal her from you? 

674
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:56,250
 I know you think it's because of me that Se Yeon died. 

675
00:52:56,250 --> 00:52:57,760
 It's not a thought, but a fact. 

676
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:59,800
 So when are you going to stop being angry at me? 

677
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:05,150
 Until you die and meet Se Yeon! 

678
00:53:12,930 --> 00:53:15,360
 Okay. 

679
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:17,510
 Does Im Ju Gyeong know? 

680
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:22,060
 That you killed a friend? 

681
00:53:27,470 --> 00:53:30,120
 What will she think of you if she knows? 

682
00:53:32,130 --> 00:53:34,440
 Don't forget. 

683
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:37,750
 You killed Se Yeon, 

684
00:53:37,750 --> 00:53:40,920
 and you don't deserve to smile. 

685
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:43,360
 You murderer. 

686
00:53:55,510 --> 00:53:57,580
I like the blue one.

687
00:53:57,580 --> 00:53:58,690
What color are you picking?

688
00:53:58,690 --> 00:54:02,280
No, I'm going to do everything.

689
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:04,790
Will you be playing?

690
00:54:05,820 --> 00:54:07,710
No. Let's go.

691
00:54:07,710 --> 00:54:09,740
Let's go.

692
00:54:11,630 --> 00:54:13,850
Do we have to do this?

693
00:54:13,850 --> 00:54:16,590
We need to do this to cheer Seo Jun up.

694
00:54:16,590 --> 00:54:18,440
He’s probably more upset now. The game is starting soon. We should go!

695
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:19,870
Let's hurry and go.

696
00:54:19,870 --> 00:54:22,700
Hurry, hurry.

697
00:54:25,210 --> 00:54:27,350
 Devils 

698
00:54:33,550 --> 00:54:34,980
God Seo Jun!

699
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:36,890
Hey, Han Seo Jun isn't on our side.

700
00:54:36,890 --> 00:54:39,850
- I-I'm sorry.
 - Hey, but what about Lee Su Ho?

701
00:54:39,850 --> 00:54:42,340
I don't know. I guess he didn't come.

702
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:47,520
Kang Su! You came? I thought you couldn't come because of private tutoring.

703
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:50,200
I skipped it. I secretly came out.

704
00:54:54,630 --> 00:54:57,400
Im Ju, why did you take so long? Come here.

705
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:02,230
Milky-skinned hottie, Yoo Tae Hoon!

706
00:57:15,170 --> 00:57:16,770
Pass!

707
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:29,550
 Devils 

708
00:57:43,810 --> 00:57:45,750
Su Ho!

709
00:57:56,660 --> 00:58:02,670
Like you said, it's all because of me and it's all my fault.

710
00:58:02,670 --> 00:58:07,650
So take whatever it is out on me. I'll take it.

711
00:58:09,930 --> 00:58:14,710
But... Don't play around with Im Ju Gyeong.

712
00:58:16,170 --> 00:58:18,480
Then I won't hold back, either.

713
00:58:32,710 --> 00:58:37,960
♫ It might be difficult for people to believe,

714
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:43,310
♫ But I’m too generous with love.

715
00:58:44,220 --> 00:58:45,670
Im Ju!

716
00:58:45,670 --> 00:58:47,670
Should we watch in front or behind?

717
00:58:47,670 --> 00:58:49,670
Guys, I'm tired so I'll be going in first—

718
00:58:49,670 --> 00:58:51,940
You better not say you're leaving first.

719
00:58:51,940 --> 00:58:54,970
The highlight of the festival is just about to start, so where are you going?

720
00:58:54,970 --> 00:58:56,720
Yeah, we should watch the performance and then leave together.

721
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:58,060
Let's go.

722
00:58:58,060 --> 00:59:02,810
♫ I get drunk with you and we dance

723
00:59:02,810 --> 00:59:08,600
♫ Even if everything falls out of my pockets

724
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:12,920
♫ Everything is okay in this moment

725
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:18,310
Next song isn't very well known but it's a song of the late Jeong Se Yeon, whom I was a fan of.

726
00:59:18,310 --> 00:59:22,010
I dedicate this song to him, in remembrance of him who passed away a year ago.

727
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:27,140
♫ As I couldn't erase it yet 
    

728
00:59:27,140 --> 00:59:29,240
Jeong Se Yeon?

729
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:34,790
That's the guy who committed suicide last year! Jeong Se Yeon!

730
00:59:34,790 --> 00:59:39,050
Why does it have to be this song? Isn't Han Seo Jun going to fight Su Ho again?

731
00:59:39,050 --> 00:59:41,450
Why? Do they have a relation with Jeong Se Yeon?

732
00:59:41,450 --> 00:59:45,230
Those three were close. Lee Su Ho, Han Seo Jun, and Jeong Se Yeon.

733
00:59:45,230 --> 00:59:47,280
Did Lee Su Ho not say?

734
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:49,320
- What? 
 - Oh yeah, they were.

735
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:52,650
I guess they were close back then.

736
00:59:52,650 --> 00:59:55,820
♫ Sometimes, I forget

737
00:59:55,820 --> 01:00:02,510
♫ I pretend that I’m fine and meet with people

738
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:08,540
♫ How long has it been

739
01:00:08,540 --> 01:00:15,400
♫ Since loneliness became a habit?

740
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:25,760
 Reporter Choi, the CEO is so busy. He doesn't have time to date anyone. 

741
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:28,670
 They just had a drink after the shoot. 

742
01:00:28,670 --> 01:00:33,240
 What do you mean a sponsor? What kind of baseless rumor— 

743
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:35,280
 Of course. 

744
01:00:52,620 --> 01:00:55,760
 Jeong Se Yeon 

745
01:01:18,050 --> 01:01:19,650
 I heard that the person who committed suicide is Jeong Se Yeon. 

746
01:01:19,650 --> 01:01:22,150
 The idol, Jeong Se Yeon?  Oh my god. 

747
01:01:22,210 --> 01:01:24,980
 - You can't come in here. 
 - Please stay out of the line. 

748
01:01:50,230 --> 01:01:56,500
♫ How do you do? How are you doing?

749
01:01:56,500 --> 01:02:03,620
♫ No matter how hard I try, I don’t think I’m okay

750
01:02:03,620 --> 01:02:10,610
♫ You’re not here,

751
01:02:10,610 --> 01:02:14,840
♫ I’m trapped inside of my regrets

752
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:17,400
I'm going to head out.

753
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:25,920
♫ I didn’t know what love is, nor did I know that we would split up.

754
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:30,680
♫ I can’t get to know you

755
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:32,650
♫ And I can’t even see you

756
01:02:32,650 --> 01:02:34,580
Lee Su Ho.

757
01:02:52,300 --> 01:02:54,460
Are you okay?

758
01:02:55,290 --> 01:02:56,920
Go.

759
01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:00,170
I said, go!

760
01:03:32,330 --> 01:03:34,350
Give me your jacket!

761
01:03:34,350 --> 01:03:35,500
Oh, so cold.

762
01:03:35,500 --> 01:03:36,810
What are you going to do?

763
01:03:36,810 --> 01:03:38,970
 How do you know Im Ju Gyeong? 

764
01:03:38,970 --> 01:03:44,500
 Oh that. She helped me when I was in trouble. 

765
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:48,200
 If it weren't for her, I wouldn't have been able to sing up there. 

766
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:51,370
 She even did my makeup for me. Isn't it pretty? 

767
01:03:51,370 --> 01:03:54,740
 Don't play around with Im Ju Gyeong. 

768
01:03:54,740 --> 01:03:58,020
 Then I won't hold back, either. 

769
01:03:58,020 --> 01:04:00,990
Han Seo Jun, what are you thinking about?

770
01:04:00,990 --> 01:04:03,570
You're thinking about her, 'I'm going to listen to you only',  aren't you?

771
01:04:03,570 --> 01:04:08,430
No. I didn't think about her.

772
01:04:08,430 --> 01:04:09,970
Huh?

773
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:16,290
I just... I feel sorry.

774
01:04:18,210 --> 01:04:20,200
Han Seo Jun, let's go together!

775
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:22,060
Woah!

776
01:04:22,060 --> 01:04:22,950
You're going to go like that?

777
01:04:22,950 --> 01:04:26,550
Han Seo Jun, our clothes got all wet because of you.

778
01:04:26,570 --> 01:04:28,160
- We did this for you! 
- We even supported you!

779
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:33,040
Don't follow me. If you follow me, you're dead.  I'm clearly telling you now.

780
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:35,270
Why?

781
01:04:35,270 --> 01:04:37,170
Let's go together!

782
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:47,180
Jeong Se Yeon was his friend.

783
01:04:49,420 --> 01:04:52,370
I wonder why he was like that earlier.

784
01:04:52,370 --> 01:04:54,620
Is he feeling sick?

785
01:05:06,110 --> 01:05:09,750
Whatever. Let's not think about it.

786
01:05:20,420 --> 01:05:22,880
Is my daughter sleeping?

787
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:24,580
Nope.

788
01:05:24,580 --> 01:05:29,030
If you're not sleeping, at least wash up even if you're tired. Okay?

789
01:05:32,220 --> 01:05:34,350
Alright.

790
01:05:35,130 --> 01:05:38,340
I should wash off the makeup before bed.

791
01:05:50,110 --> 01:05:51,890
Where have I seen this before?

792
01:05:51,890 --> 01:05:55,280
 sLh 

793
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:56,540
 sLh 

794
01:05:56,540 --> 01:05:58,970
 sLh 

795
01:06:03,930 --> 01:06:06,300
On the rooftop...

796
01:06:15,910 --> 01:06:18,540
That man...

797
01:06:21,180 --> 01:06:23,360
was Lee Su Ho?

798
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:25,940
 sLh 

799
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:32,330
 I was wondering if another person has been on the rooftop like me. 

800
01:06:32,330 --> 01:06:35,970
 I mean, we're strangers, but you saved me and got mad at me. 

801
01:06:35,970 --> 01:06:39,570
 So I was wondering if you know anyone who's died like that. 

802
01:06:41,210 --> 01:06:44,930
 sLh 

803
01:06:49,070 --> 01:06:52,580
 Have you not thought about the others around you 

804
01:06:52,580 --> 01:06:55,090
 who would be sad if you die? 

805
01:06:55,090 --> 01:06:59,540
 Someone would've felt guilty enough about not saving you, 

806
01:06:59,540 --> 01:07:02,150
 and that could make them miserable their whole life. 

807
01:07:03,210 --> 01:07:07,370
 Because they can't do anything for the person who died. 

808
01:07:08,210 --> 01:07:10,280
 So don't die. 

809
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:41,520


810
01:09:00,660 --> 01:09:02,690
It was here.

811
01:09:04,750 --> 01:09:06,880
It was here.

812
01:09:08,850 --> 01:09:10,930
Se Yeon...

813
01:09:14,130 --> 01:09:15,570
I know.

814
01:09:15,570 --> 01:09:17,530
Se Yeon.

815
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:24,540
I know.

816
01:09:25,540 --> 01:09:27,670
I know everything.

817
01:09:27,670 --> 01:09:35,330
♫  Because when I close my eyes, you are distinct  ♫

818
01:09:35,330 --> 01:09:42,280
♫  Because I miss you more when you shined  ♫

819
01:09:42,280 --> 01:09:49,510
♫  In the place where you spent a long night  ♫

820
01:09:49,510 --> 01:09:56,740
♫  I am going to rest a while. Stay with me.  ♫

821
01:09:56,740 --> 01:10:04,470
♫  In my tired heart bursting with tears  ♫

822
01:10:04,470 --> 01:10:11,340
♫  When my song reaches the sky  ♫

823
01:10:11,340 --> 01:10:19,050
♫  Come slowly like an eternal dream  ♫

824
01:10:19,050 --> 01:10:24,550
♫  Become a star at my side  ♫

825
01:10:27,750 --> 01:10:34,050
♫  When you touch my heart  ♫

826
01:10:34,050 --> 01:10:39,530
♫  Almost like the sky's starlights which shine sometimes on me  ♫

827
01:10:39,530 --> 01:10:43,010
 True Beauty 

828
01:10:43,010 --> 01:10:49,140
 Someone once told me that tears are cleaning our hearts. 

829
01:10:49,140 --> 01:10:52,850
 Jeon Se Yeon's friend and Lee Ju Heon's son. 

830
01:10:52,850 --> 01:10:56,070
 Why does he have so many secrets? 

831
01:10:56,070 --> 01:10:58,940
 My daughter, you're home? 

832
01:10:58,940 --> 01:11:01,390
 You're awesome.  You are. 

833
01:11:01,390 --> 01:11:04,810
 This girl is Han Seo Jun's girlfriend? 

834
01:11:04,810 --> 01:11:07,550
 Why? Did you help me again because I was pitiful? 

835
01:11:07,550 --> 01:11:12,230
 It's them, right? You must've been scared.
