 True Beauty 

2
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:16,380

 True Beauty 

4
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:35,700
 Episode 9  
 I don't like Kang Su Jin.

5
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:39,110
The person I like...

6
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:41,940
is you.

7
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:25,230
Im Ju Gyeong!

8
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:32,210
Why are you running away?

9
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:36,720
I don't know. Without meaning to...

10
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,000
But... it's really me?

11
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,190
Yeah. It's you.

12
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:46,170
No way.

13
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:49,540
You...! You're joking around, aren't you? Is this a prank?

14
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:52,940
Are they hiding back there? Or are you liking me out of pity?

15
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:55,670
- If it's not that, then is this a dream? 
 - It's not like that.

16
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:57,180
Then...

17
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:01,020
You really...

18
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,060
Can't I like you?

19
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,240
What should I do...?

20
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,900
I'm really nervous right now, so I can't speak well...

21
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,430
I'm also nervous.

22
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,990
I originally planned to tell you while giving you this.

23
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:44,710
See? The order is all wrong.

24
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:58,780
What do you think about me?

25
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:10,900
- What do you think it means for me to be nervous and excited? 
 - What does it mean?

26
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:14,200
It must mean I like you! I like you. I like you a lot.

27
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,510
I even dream about you, and there are times when I think about you all day long!

28
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:19,030
I'm usually really lazy, but these days I wake up before my alarm.

29
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:22,680
Because I want to go to school quickly to see you. And then when I see you, my heart—

30
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,490
Anyway...

31
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:36,060
I'm saying my response is that.

32
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:45,820
Im Ju Gyeong.

33
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:54,150
I still can't believe this.

34
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,290
It's not a dream, right?

35
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,790
It hurts!

36
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:08,910
Su Jin!

37
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:10,790
Who is it?

38
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:14,080
Who do you think? It's Ju Gyeong!

39
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:25,980
  Oh, right. I'm barefaced, aren't I? 

40
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,330
Ju Gyeong.

41
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:43,680
But why do you have to go that far to hide this?

42
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:47,820
Before...

43
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:51,720
I asked the kids who bullied me

44
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:55,250
why they hated me so much.

45
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:59,770
 Because. You're. Ugly. 

46
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,610
They said it's because I'm ugly.

47
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:08,360
They don't like my face. Just because.

48
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:12,030
But after I put on makeup,

49
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:16,630
the looks that I get from people are different.

50
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:21,310
They talk to me first.

51
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:24,160
And I made friends quickly.

52
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:28,360
That's when I thought of it.

53
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:35,630
That I should never take off this mask.

54
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:37,920
It was probably hard for you too.

55
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:41,070
Anxious in case you got caught.

56
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:43,750
If they know my bare face...

57
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:48,570
I'm scared they'll curse and turn their backs on me.

58
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,960
I'm seriously a loser, right?

59
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,740
Those bastards who made you feel that way are much bigger losers.

60
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:02,800
Don't think like that again, okay?

61
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:07,620
But you said you didn't want to get caught.

62
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:10,190
How do we get you inside?

63
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:14,790
Get up.

64
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:21,590
Come inside.

65
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:30,270
Let's go. Let's go.

66
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:32,430
- We're going like this? 
 - Yes.

67
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:55,730
I really went to and came back from Heaven and Hell.

68
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:01,980
But it's a relief that the person who caught me was Su Jin.

69
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,400
 Lee Su Ho: Sleep well. 

70
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:17,960
 To Im Ju Gyeong: Sleep well. 

71
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,020
  I pressed wrongly. 

72
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:30,520
♫ When I'm looking at you  ♫

73
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:35,130
  You too. 

74
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:39,740
♫  Because it feels like I'm flying in the sky  ♫

75
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:42,720
♫  I’m falling in love  ♫

76
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,030
♫  It's windy  ♫

77
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:49,660
♫  When your scent reaches me  ♫

78
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:56,310
♫  I can even feel a soft small breath  ♫

79
00:07:56,310 --> 00:08:02,190
♫  Is this love  ♫

80
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:06,330
♫  Love so fine  ♫

81
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:10,130
♫  Come closer, approach me  ♫

82
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:15,050
♫  Come closer, approach me.  ♫

83
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:18,130
♫  Always in my heart  ♫

84
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:21,690
♫  I think I’m in love with you  ♫

85
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:24,070
- What's with Lee Su Ho? 
 - Did he just smile?

86
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:26,010
This is my first time seeing him smile.

87
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:28,950
He's so handsome!

88
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,150
I'm not sure about Hyeon Gyu though.

89
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:38,390
Throw it away.

90
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:42,040
Are we in a relationship that we can give and receive these things from each other?

91
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:44,840
I said to throw it away! Did you not hear me?

92
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:49,350
- What's going on? 
 - No way, did Ju Gyeong just...?

93
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:52,300
What? What?

94
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:55,790
Don't even know how precious strawberries are. Have you still not confessed yet?

95
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:59,410
Geez, you frustrating fool...

96
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:08,610
Hey, Han Seo Jun. Are you not going to your classroom?

97
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:11,130
- I'm not going. 
 - Oh, I see.

98
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:13,250
Then where should I sit?

99
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:15,910
- Hurry up and go! 
 - I don't want to.

100
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:18,840
- You go. 
 - Hey, I can't change my classroom at my wish.

101
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,680
- Hurry and go! Hurry up!  
 - No...

102
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:23,900
Hey, aren't you going to help me? Drag him out.

103
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:28,000
Oh, right. On the weekend, after we study, let's go to the jjimjilbang (sauna).

104
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,670
How's that?

105
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:32,060
Jiimjilbang?

106
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,380
It's a bit so-so for me.

107
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:36,150
Why? Let's go together. It's fun.

108
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:40,290
- Let's go together. 
 - I'm a bit...

109
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:44,990
Hey. What jjimjilbang? I hate hot things.

110
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:46,810
Don't if you don't want to.

111
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,800
What's going on with Lee Su Ho?

112
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,680
He always ate alone, but what's this?

113
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,330
Is he close with that girl?

114
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:06,200
What's with Lee Su Ho? Is he eating with her because he likes her?

115
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:09,710
I lost my appetite!

116
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:12,940
- Hey! After one bite? 
 - She must be on a diet.

117
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:15,260
That traitor. She's trying to get prettier.

118
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:18,390
Im Ju Gyeong is avoiding you, isn't she?

119
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:22,020
It seems like she caught on to you liking her, so she's putting a wall up.

120
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:26,810
Wow. It looks like God Su Ho is going to get rejected even without confessing.

121
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,950
Im Ju Gyeong? What is she saying?

122
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:38,270
How annoying. You're such a jerk.

123
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:40,480
You pitiful boy.

124
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:44,260
I really like this, but I'll give it to you.

125
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:46,630
  Incinerator 

126
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:52,260
Awesome! That's God Su Ho.

127
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,740
He's so handsome!

128
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,570
Bend down! Shh!

129
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:08,660
- Must we really do this? 
 - Of course.

130
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,110
Why?

131
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:13,420
What do you mean why? Have you not heard the rumors?

132
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:15,420
Because you said that you like someone

133
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:19,750
if someone even just brushes shoulders with you, the bully girls who like you will bring her up to the rooftop.

134
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:24,240
But if it gets known that I'm dating you...

135
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:34,740
 Are you the girl who wagged her tail at God Su Ho? 
 (TN: Meaning she seduced him) 

136
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:37,550
 No! I'm not! 

137
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:39,880
 Look at her tail. 

138
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:45,190
 Catch this fox! 

139
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,190
 It's not me! Not me! 

140
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:56,250
Does that make sense?

141
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:01,080
- It makes sense. 
 - So we should keep doing this?

142
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:05,480
Of course, I should tell Su Jin and Su Ah.

143
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:08,590
But... I'm still embarrassed right now.

144
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,290
That you're my boyfrie—

145
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:17,110
How can I say that?

146
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:19,320
I am your boyfriend.

147
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,500
It's weird.

148
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,410
It's a word that really doesn't suit me.

149
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:37,850
You know it's the personal counseling period, starting from the next week, right?

150
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:40,210
Okay.

151
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:46,660
 Career Aspiration Survey 

152
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:02,990
What a secret mission.

153
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,890
Have you seen anyone from our school around here?

154
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:12,480
This place is an hour away from school. Do you think they'd come this far?

155
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,410
But still...

156
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:17,520
Goodbye!

157
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:22,720
Welcome, I'll be your hostess. Would you like a table in the open area?

158
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:27,960
Somewhere out of the way with no CCTV and out of anyone's sight.

159
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:31,550
Oh, sure. Right this way, then.

160
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:35,620
These young little punks are already messing around at their age.

161
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:40,460
Take your time to look at the menu and then order.

162
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:43,280
Give us a couple set, please.

163
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:46,610
Something that only couples eat.

164
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:48,270
Since we are a couple, you see?

165
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:52,940
Yes, a couple set.

166
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:55,950
Couple...

167
00:13:57,180 --> 00:14:00,340
No one can see us here, so we can be a little more obvious now.

168
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:04,080
Since I can't even talk to you at school, I barely feel like we're dating.

169
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,190
I can feel it, though.

170
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:08,410
It really hit me when I was changing this thing.

171
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:10,630
How did you save my contact information in your phone?

172
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:13,030
- I did— 
 - Im Ju Gyeong.

173
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:16,350
- My name? 
 - Yup.

174
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:19,040
What about it?

175
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:23,100
M-My name... It's pretty, yeah!

176
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:26,430
 ♡Boyfriend♡ 

177
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:32,380
Enjoy your meal!

178
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:44,950
Do they usually only give you one fork for a couple set?

179
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:47,000
I wonder why?

180
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,940
Cutie pie.

181
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:56,120
They want us to act like that?

182
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,450
Let's eat.

183
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:11,780
Here.

184
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:20,890
Oh! I'm sorry, I forgot—

185
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,920
Enjoy your food!

186
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:38,070
What should we eat?

187
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:41,990
Oh! Im Ju Gyeong?

188
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:46,380
Hide!

189
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,890
Ahn Hyeon Gyu, what are you doing all the way out here?

190
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:53,450
- This is a trendy place! 
- We come here pretty often.

191
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:57,450
Speaking of, who did you come here with?

192
00:15:57,450 --> 00:16:02,810
- B-b-by myself. 
 - You came b-b-by yourself and ordered a couple set?

193
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:06,340
- Because the menu is really substantial. 
 - That's true.

194
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:10,700
I see, you eat a lot more than I would have assumed. Enjoy your meal!

195
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,600
-  Gotcha! 
 - No!

196
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:17,330
- Oh, excuse us. 
 - Hey, hey. Let's give them some privacy.

197
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:18,990
Wow, you must be a gentleman.

198
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:21,790
Excuse me, Mr. Boyfriend? You shy guy.

199
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:25,600
- What do you mean b-boyfriend? 
 - I should just expose—!

200
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:32,950
Nice to meet you, Im Ju Gyeong's boyfriend. I hope I can see your face and talk to you next time.

201
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:36,380
Have a good time with your boyfriend.

202
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:39,640
Ju Gyeong, good luck!

203
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,880
I don't think this'll do. It's still dangerous when we travel an hour away.

204
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,930
We might run into another person from school, so I'm going to get going—!

205
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:10,980
I brought you here because I wanted to show you something.

206
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:13,840
Let's just see that before we go.

207
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:18,620
Aren't... you a fan of that person?

208
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:23,280
It's Selena!

209
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,510
OMG!

210
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:33,340
- Do you tend to use high-coverage products on your troubled skin areas? 
 - Yes!

211
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:39,820
Actually, it's much better on your skin to use a gentle product like this tone-up cream.

212
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:42,100
- Please keep that in mind! 
 - She's so cool.

213
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:44,640
Now, I have a question for you all.

214
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,570
There is a prize, so focus!

215
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:48,350
When you are doing a foundation-free makeup look,

216
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:54,250
how can you make your skin look smooth without using concealer?

217
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,830
Me! Pick me!

218
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:57,680
Yes, the student in brown?

219
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,610
Using primer!

220
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:04,670
Primer? Primer... Correct!

221
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:10,340
You answered correctly, so come get your prize.

222
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,200
I won this!

223
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:30,040
I... I-I'm a huge, mega fan of yours!

224
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,590
Can you sign this for me? To memorialize today.

225
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:34,210
One second, here.

226
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:38,050
It's a long story, but you helped me be reborn to a new life.

227
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:42,030
All of my friends compliment my makeup, and I learned everything from your videos!

228
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:44,640
Thank you!

229
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:50,020
This looks like shit.

230
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:51,970
What?

231
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:54,750
I said, it looks like shit.

232
00:18:54,750 --> 00:19:00,150
You say that you learned from my videos, but you chose this lip color?

233
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:03,680
Warm-toned colors all vary based on the vibrancy of the color.

234
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:08,620
Just one slight difference in tone can completely ruin the balance of your entire look.

235
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:15,970
Here, what do you think?

236
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:18,850
If you're going to half-ass your makeup like this,

237
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:21,710
don't go around telling people that you learned from me.

238
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:26,730
Thank you, I'll try my best!

239
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:31,720
But still, you're doing way better than I did when I started wearing makeup.

240
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:35,340
Don't be discouraged, and keep working hard.

241
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:00,540
- Are you that happy? 
 - Yes! I'm so happy.

242
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:02,440
I don't really get it.

243
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:05,570
To me, it seems like you're better at makeup.

244
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:09,370
Hey, compared to Selena, I'm like a speck of dust in the wind.

245
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:11,910
I couldn't be on her level even if I tried.

246
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:13,690
What's that supposed to mean?

247
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:16,950
That person had to start off somewhere, too.

248
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:20,050
 But still, you're doing way better than I did when I started wearing makeup. 

249
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:23,640
No way.

250
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:28,580
I guess you liked seeing Selena more than you liked our first date.

251
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:30,190
Huh?

252
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:33,180
It's nothing.

253
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,790
You haven't closed yet. Did you still have customers at this hour?

254
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:39,510
My daughter!

255
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:41,280
You! Who gave you permission to go around this late?

256
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,480
- Ju Gyeong, did you eat dinner yet? 
 - Yes I did!

257
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,990
Guess who I saw today? I saw Selena!

258
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:49,640
- Selena? Who's that? 
 - She's a really famous makeup artist.

259
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,520
Does she do makeup for celebrities?

260
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,180
Goodness, she works hard like me.

261
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:58,810
I have no money coming in, but there are so many places for money to go out.

262
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:02,050
It's tough to feed and clothe a family of five on my own.

263
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:05,410
If only we hadn't lost the apartment...

264
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:09,480
Has it been slow here recently?

265
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,740
It's not like it used to be.

266
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:15,840
I need to tough it out until you all graduate from university.

267
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:19,280
- I'll get going now. 
 - Oh, hey!

268
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,520
Throw this away on your way out.

269
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,360
Ew! It smells.

270
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,950
Oh, and wash the dishes when you get home please!

271
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:30,810
I forgot to do them after breakfast, and there might be fruit flies if we leave them out much longer. 
   

272
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:34,140
Im Ju Yeong is at home. Why didn't you ask him to do it?

273
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,680
I really wanted one of these!

274
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:48,740
Oh, it's so gentle.

275
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:54,890
 Career Aspiration Survey 

276
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:58,610
What use is it to have an aspiration?

277
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:01,590
I'm not even qualified to go to my dream school.

278
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:04,080
Ugh, which university should I write down?

279
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:23,550
  National License Programs  

280
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:25,720
₩1,500,000?!

281
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:28,800
It's too expensive for me to even hope for.

282
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:33,990
Oh, man.

283
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:35,700
What the hell? Did you drink again?

284
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:41,580
No, no. The alcohol swallowed me.

285
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,810
Has something been bothering her lately?

286
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:48,270
Ugh, you should have taken off your shoes before you came in.

287
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:49,420
 Hello? 

288
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:53,670
Hui Gyeong? Where are you? You haven't been answering your phone.

289
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:58,070
- My sister is sleeping right now. Who are you, though? 
 - Your t-t-tea—

290
00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:00,870
I'm a military subordinate!

291
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:05,750
Have a good night! Madam! Salute!

292
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:11,240
- A military subordinate? 
 - Salute!

293
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:14,240
That voice is really familiar.

294
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:46,350
Where could he have gone so early?

295
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:48,780
- Dad! Where's my school uniform? 
 - Here, it's here.

296
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:50,580
Honey! Give me a glass of water!

297
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:53,410
- Dad! 
 - Honey?

298
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:55,990
- I'm hungry. 
 - Kids, have you seen your dad?

299
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:59,920
- No. 
 - Where the heck did he go so early?

300
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:02,120
What's this?

301
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:03,860
 To my beloved family... 

302
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,870
This guy, seriously!

303
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:06,950
What's wrong?

304
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:09,920
 To my beloved family, Suk and my kids, 

305
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:13,790
 I'm going to Jeju Island to find that bastard, Columbus Park. 

306
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:19,080
 I'm never ever coming back until I track him down and take back the money that he conned from me. 

307
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,590
 So don't worry about me. 

308
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:24,670
What a load of bullshit!

309
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:31,150
Wow, look at her, enjoying the nap.

310
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:41,070
Hey, the bus is coming soon. Wake up.

311
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:02,440
Oh, Han Seo Jun.

312
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:05,820
Hey! Do you just fall asleep anywhere?

313
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:08,050
You would sleep through a kidnapping.

314
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:11,850
I'm too heavy for anyone to kidnap me, anyway.

315
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:16,660
Oh, sorry man! Ew.

316
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:18,580
Ugh, come on.

317
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:22,480
I should have just ignored you. What am I doing?

318
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,160
What?

319
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:27,320
Did you stop riding your motorcycle?

320
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,510
Is it because I told you to stop?

321
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:32,560
Huh?

322
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:41,880
 So when Mom said don't ride it, you shouldn't ride it. 

323
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:47,710
 I'm sorry but I'm soft-hearted for sick people, so I have to side with her. 

324
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:53,380
 Why do you ride the dangerous motorcycle when your mother worries so much? 

325
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:06,950
Do you think I would not ride because you told me not to?

326
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:08,820
I'm known to be a filial son.

327
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:12,190
I'm not riding it because my mom told me so.

328
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:14,070
 The bus will arrive momentarily. 

329
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:16,950
Where are you going? The bus is here.

330
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:19,800
I'm going to run for my workout. Why?

331
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,820
See you later.

332
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:26,960
What the?

333
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,560
Seriously, what am I doing?

334
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:33,660
 I'm sorry. I don't think I can meet you tonight. 

335
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:38,670
- I wonder what's wrong. 
 - Mr. Jin Woo.

336
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:44,010
- If you're not busy tonight, will you come with me to buy a birthday present for the vice principal?
 - Pardon?

337
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:48,950
I'm in charge of it, but I don't think I can pick a man's present well by myself.

338
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:51,780
I'm not very good at picking presents either.

339
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:53,400
Should I come with you?

340
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,760
I have to go get my wife a present at the department store.

341
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,770
Hello?

342
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:03,360
Mr. Jin Woo, I'll see you later.

343
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,400
No, I...

344
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:17,060
Ju Gyeong's here.

345
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:20,510
Im Ju, Im Ju! You got a boyfriend? Why didn't you tell me?

346
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:23,680
What school does he go to? Not our school, right? Tell me!

347
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,700
Who says so?

348
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:32,680
I saw you at K-mall. You were trying so hard to hide him.

349
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:35,230
Hey! I told you it's not like that.

350
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:39,100
W-why are you so embarrassed? What's the big deal about have a boyfriend?

351
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:43,370
You're really overreacting. Others might think you're dating a celebrity.

352
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:47,060
- I know, right? 
 - Maybe she really is!

353
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:52,170
Tell me. Who is it? You got a boyfriend?

354
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:54,930
- That's not true. 
 - Then what is he talking about?

355
00:27:54,930 --> 00:27:56,410
Jeez!

356
00:27:56,410 --> 00:28:01,920
So I told you to confess, you dork.

357
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:08,000
What should I do with him?

358
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,650
- I should've checked his face. 
 - Right.

359
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:12,210
Hey!

360
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:16,630
- Go back to your seats. 
 - Let's go, go.

361
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:27,490
 Should we go to Prince Comics later? 

362
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:30,590
 Okay. Let's eat egg ramyun, too. 

363
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:34,440
 - Right! Send me the pic.
 - What picture? 

364
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:38,340
 The picture of us from the boat. 

365
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:43,540
   

366
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:46,020
   

367
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:59,630
 Why aren't you sending the picture? 

368
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:02,330
   

369
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:05,110
Ahn Hyeon Gyu?

370
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,680
Why him of all people?

371
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,880
 Unread 

372
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,660
He didn't see it yet.

373
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:29,850
Right, I just have to get rid of the evidence.

374
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:31,660
I can do it.

375
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:35,980
Forward! Forward!

376
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:45,360
Hey, Im Ju Gyeong!

377
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:48,060
- Sorry.
 - It's okay.

378
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:51,930
- Okay! 
 - You missed the line! 
 - Hey, this wasn't my fault!

379
00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:56,940
- Why couldn't you hang in there? 
 - Come on!

380
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,650
 Use your fingerprint or input the PIN. 

381
00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:05,590
 Please press it longer. 

382
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:10,880
The Korean history teacher is present!

383
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:19,430
Take a seat. How do you memorize the year of the Japanese invasion, 1592?

384
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:22,300
 I need to erase it before he realizes his phone is gone. 

385
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:25,160
It would be nice to memorize it like this, right?

386
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:30,970
 Fingerprint... Fingerprint... How do I get his fingerprint? 

387
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:36,520
Is our Su Ah taking the class for the science of sleep? She won't even notice if she's carried away.

388
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,170
- She's so cute! 
 - Wow, Choi Su Ah was sitting straight before that.

389
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:40,710
 Right.  Fall asleep. 

390
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:42,850
The rest of you focus.

391
00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:47,710
 Sleep. Sleep till you won't notice anything. 

392
00:30:48,530 --> 00:30:51,180
 Why is he suddenly  so studious? 

393
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:53,740
 Go to sleep! 

394
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:06,110
What the heck?

395
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:13,660
 Sleep. You will fall asleep. 

396
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:17,610
 Fall asleep. 

397
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:22,340
 Fall asleep. 

398
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:25,530
 Abracadabra! 

399
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:28,450
Check all the important points that I told you.

400
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:32,110
- Great! 
 - That's it for today. See you next time!

401
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:53,110
Why do you have my phone?

402
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:55,240
What is it?

403
00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:59,560
Oh, it's nothing.

404
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:03,610
Excuse me.

405
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:08,970
What's wrong with her?

406
00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:22,320
Wow, if Ahn Hyeon Gyu found out, it would've only taken a few hours for the whole school ...

407
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:26,340
no, even other schools would've heard.

408
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:31,070
- You must be really scared that you might be dragged to the rooftop.
 - That too.

409
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:37,090
But if others found out about us dating, they'll be cursing.

410
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:40,640
Saying how could a guy like you date a girl like me.

411
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,070
What's wrong with you?

412
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:46,290
What do you mean?

413
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:51,320
My face is like this and my grades are bad.

414
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:54,610
I fall very short compared to you.

415
00:32:56,130 --> 00:32:57,930
You're enough.

416
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:01,240
You as yourself is enough for me.

417
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:04,950
So don't say such things.

418
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:22,780
Still, no one from our school comes here except us two.

419
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:26,130
- Should we meet here all the time from now on?
 - Yes.

420
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:50,290
- Oh, who is this? It's Go Woon!
 - Unnie!

421
00:33:54,890 --> 00:33:56,940
 Prince Comics 

422
00:33:56,940 --> 00:34:02,010
 This place won't do either. I'll call you later. 

423
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:10,680
Then good bye.

424
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:31,920
I think this is too young for his age. Should we exchange it?

425
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:35,220
I think they're all about the same.

426
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:36,810
Oh!

427
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:40,230
- Could you stand up for a sec? 
 - How did you get here?

428
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:42,920
Stand up.

429
00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:51,180
- Do you know her? Who is she? 
 - Ah...

430
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:55,050
I'm Im Hui Gyeong. Who are you?

431
00:34:56,350 --> 00:34:58,780
- I'm Lee Hye Rim.
 - Right.

432
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:01,170
We're colleagues. For now.

433
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:03,360
Would that change in the future?

434
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:06,850
So you guys must be pretty close?

435
00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:10,060
Like meeting separately and helping with the tie and stuff.

436
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:13,010
No, that's not it.

437
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:16,380
- That's a misunderstanding— 
- Then what's your relationship with him?

438
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:19,200
- So... 
 - His girlfriend. 
 - Pardon?

439
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,020
What?

440
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:25,050
We're lovers.

441
00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:30,650
- I can't hear well...
- LO-VER!

442
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:33,570
- Why can't I hear? 
- Let's talk outside. Ouch.

443
00:35:33,570 --> 00:35:37,580
We're lovers. He's my man! Can you hear me?!

444
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:41,050
- Aahhhh! 
 - Why this...

445
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:45,320
Oh, are you Mr. Han's girlfriend? Nice to meet you.

446
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:49,070
I'm sorry but I have to go.

447
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:53,010
- Why? Why?  
 - I'm sorry. Excuse me.

448
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:55,770
What's going on?

449
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:58,600
Jun Woo.

450
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:15,810
 School Newsletter 

451
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:21,910
  
   

452
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:30,410
What's up with her? Why is she sleeping all day?

453
00:36:30,410 --> 00:36:34,780
- She said she went to bed late trying to find a part-time job.
 - A part-time job?

454
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:38,890
Gosh, she must be tired.

455
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:51,180
 You dropped this. 

456
00:36:58,030 --> 00:37:01,300
Right, Kang Su, do you want to stop by the school snack store?

457
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:04,620
Kang Su!

458
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:19,320
 Like that, someone should carry another, even if you two are guys. 

459
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:22,460
 Isn't that Lee Su Ho's? I'll give it to him. 

460
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:24,190
 Have you seen Im Ju Gyeong? 

461
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:27,660
 - Ju Gyeong told me to give this to you. 
 - She asked you? 

462
00:37:36,770 --> 00:37:40,290
 Resume 

463
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:42,490
- Is this your first part-time job?
 - Yes.

464
00:37:42,490 --> 00:37:44,240
We're looking for someone experienced.

465
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,460
But if you train me, I'll do my best.

466
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:50,870
There are many who'll do their best, but we need someone who will do well.

467
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:52,510
Sorry.

468
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:55,770
Okay.

469
00:37:55,770 --> 00:37:59,460
 Sorry, we already hired someone. 

470
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:03,280
It's not easy getting a part-time job.

471
00:38:04,970 --> 00:38:07,780
 ♡Boyfriend♡ 

472
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:14,150
 The customer cannot answer the phone at this moment. 

473
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:16,350
Is he busy?

474
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:31,040
Pervert! Pervert!

475
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,210
What the heck?

476
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:36,520
- Han Seo Jun?
 - What the heck?

477
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,270
Why are you here?

478
00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:43,110
Why are you here? Why are you undressing yourself in the girl's bathroom?

479
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:47,150
Shoot!

480
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:57,380
Wow, you look like a real model.

481
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:59,330
Do you have a photo shoot today?

482
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:02,000
Yes. Good bye.

483
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,310
Oh? Really?

484
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:06,230
Hey, Han Seo Jun!

485
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,190
One billion won?

486
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:15,180
Lee Ju Heon made a big donation this year.

487
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:18,140
So the hospital director invited reporters

488
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:21,700
and held a fancy thank you ceremony.

489
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:26,070
People will think that our cancer center was built by the actor Lee Ju Heon.

490
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:31,030
Sorry for making you wait for so long.

491
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:35,020
No need. I'm the one who called for a busy person.

492
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:37,300
Su Ho, it's been so long, right?

493
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:39,070
Have you been well?

494
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:43,180
Okay, that was a good one. Turn around, right.

495
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:45,610
I'll go, I'll go. Good pose. One, two.

496
00:39:45,610 --> 00:39:47,970
Last two. One, two. Two, three.

497
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:52,050
Three, two. Good one just now. Smile a little more.

498
00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:55,730
Look here. Okay. One, two.

499
00:39:55,730 --> 00:39:59,050
Three, two. Good. We'll go on just like now.

500
00:39:59,050 --> 00:40:03,120
Okay! Seo Jun, let's have a costume change.

501
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,990
Good work.

502
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,990
What is this? You didn't go yet?

503
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:12,050
- I was watching. It's amazing.
 - Wait a sec.

504
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:14,280
- Is this your girlfriend? 
 - No.

505
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,890
Hello.

506
00:40:15,890 --> 00:40:17,430
You should've told me about such a beauty.

507
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:20,010
What beauty?

508
00:40:20,010 --> 00:40:21,900
You should go.

509
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:24,550
- Fine.
 - Wait! Wait!

510
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:27,750
Why are you kicking her out?

511
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:30,140
Seo Jun's friend?

512
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:32,670
Would you like to model today?

513
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:38,110
To be honest, I was frustrated because our female model didn't show up.

514
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:39,970
- Me?
 - Hyung.

515
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:42,490
Modeling is not for everyone.

516
00:40:42,490 --> 00:40:45,010
I told you to go.

517
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:52,400
We really need to update our new line and are in a rush for a shoot. Would you consider it?

518
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,560
But I've never done such thing...

519
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,700
That's why you can be even better, right?

520
00:40:56,700 --> 00:41:00,300
And since you're Seo Jun's friend, I'll pay you more.

521
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:02,770
You'll pay me? Then I want to try.

522
00:41:02,770 --> 00:41:05,000
- Hey!
 - Great.

523
00:41:05,970 --> 00:41:08,820
I heard you two are in the same class this year.

524
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:13,210
Su Jin, I hope you help my Su Ho a lot.

525
00:41:13,210 --> 00:41:16,880
He doesn't want to come live with me.

526
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,510
It's not easy to take care of him living separately.

527
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:20,540
I will.

528
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:22,990
I live well by myself without anyone taking care of me.

529
00:41:22,990 --> 00:41:24,570
Don't worry.

530
00:41:24,570 --> 00:41:29,450
Su Ho seems to resemble you more as he grows.

531
00:41:29,450 --> 00:41:31,140
Don't you want him to become an entertainer?

532
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:34,130
His grades are too good to just be an entertainer.

533
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:35,320
Is that so?

534
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:39,020
I will support whatever he wants to do.

535
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:42,520
You can say that because Su Ho is good no matter what.

536
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:47,300
If we don't push Su Jin, her grades will drop for sure.

537
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:52,220
Compared to boys, girls aren't as tenacious or competitive.

538
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:57,220
That's why she's always behind Su Ho. You have to be born smart but—

539
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:59,480
We have a group study.

540
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:05,080
- You're leaving already?
 - We'll be leaving first.

541
00:42:05,730 --> 00:42:07,340
Let's go.

542
00:42:08,970 --> 00:42:12,070
Good bye.

543
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:18,370
It's a little awkward. Don't do that.

544
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:22,670
Let's do it more naturally. One, two. No, don't do that.

545
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:24,360
- Can you be more natural?
 - How about this?

546
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:27,080
That's not good. No, don't do that. One, two.

547
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:30,390
Hyung! Are you going to keep letting her do this?

548
00:42:30,390 --> 00:42:33,680
I haven't taken many pictures in my life. I'm sorry.

549
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:37,110
Of course, it's awkward at first. Seo Jun was like that too. Right, Seo Jun?

550
00:42:37,110 --> 00:42:40,590
Seo Jun, can you hold her a little closer?

551
00:42:40,590 --> 00:42:43,900
Act like you're super close?  Let's go, fighting!

552
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:45,430
One, two! Three!

553
00:42:45,430 --> 00:42:48,880
Right! Arm around. Seo Jun, smile.

554
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:51,400
Seo Jun, it will be fine if you smile!

555
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:55,860
Hey, Han Seo Jun, why are you acting like an amateur? It's not like you've never done a couple shoot.

556
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:57,730
Then give up.

557
00:42:57,730 --> 00:43:00,330
Hey, you're getting cranky because you're hungry.

558
00:43:00,330 --> 00:43:02,540
Let me get some delicious stuff to eat. Let's take 10.

559
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:05,300
- We'll take 10. 
 - Okay.

560
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:09,460
I'm really bad, right?

561
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:12,020
No, you're unbelievably bad.

562
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:15,430
So tell him that you can't do it and leave.

563
00:43:15,430 --> 00:43:19,510
You're so mean. Just teach me what to do.

564
00:43:19,510 --> 00:43:22,000
I don't want to.

565
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:25,880
It is because of the lights? It's super hot.

566
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:32,190
What are you doing?

567
00:43:32,190 --> 00:43:35,200
They're new clothes. I can't get them dirty.

568
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:38,500
- So hot. 
 - Gosh, seriously.

569
00:43:40,770 --> 00:43:43,220
So oily.

570
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:50,560
Do you want me to do it to you?

571
00:43:54,770 --> 00:43:58,460
- What is it? 
 - Looks like you are sweaty, too.

572
00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:00,780
It's fine. Go away.

573
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:04,260
Why? I'm doing this so the picture will turn out good.

574
00:44:05,070 --> 00:44:07,120
I said don't.

575
00:44:09,570 --> 00:44:11,590
Is this easy to you?

576
00:44:12,450 --> 00:44:14,030
What is?

577
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:25,920
I'm a guy too.

578
00:44:28,370 --> 00:44:31,190
Of course you're a guy. You're not a girl.

579
00:44:33,410 --> 00:44:36,680
What is this? It's here. I like that. Where is the camera?

580
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:40,050
That's good. Let's go. Look here. Just like that. One, two.

581
00:44:40,050 --> 00:44:42,320
Okay!

582
00:44:44,350 --> 00:44:46,780
I'll make this quick. Cooperate.

583
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:52,980
♫  I'm always anxious  ♫

584
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:58,600
♫  I am loving you  ♫

585
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:02,980
♫  Fall in you  ♫

586
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:06,680
♫  I just found out  ♫

587
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:10,870
♫  Fall in you  ♫

588
00:45:10,870 --> 00:45:13,900
♫  I am waiting for you  ♫

589
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:17,160
♫  Fall in you  ♫

590
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:22,140
♫  You are my destiny  ♫

591
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:29,040
You're really just reading. Wasn't it an excuse?

592
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:30,610
It wasn't.

593
00:45:30,610 --> 00:45:35,140
Still, thank you. I almost had heartburn.

594
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:37,550
By the way, are you really not moving in with your dad?

595
00:45:37,550 --> 00:45:39,320
It seems like he wants to live with you.

596
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:43,400
It's been longer living separately. It'll just be awkward.

597
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:44,680
I feel more comfortable now.

598
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:48,030
For both you and me... What's wrong with our dads?

599
00:45:48,030 --> 00:45:52,080
By the way... Did anything happen since then?

600
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:55,240
- Did you get hit or—
 - Nothing happened.

601
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:58,080
It'll be quiet until the report card comes out again.

602
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:01,410
What's up? You never worry about me.

603
00:46:01,410 --> 00:46:02,440
What do you mean?

604
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:06,030
It seems like you're talking more and regaining humanity.

605
00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:07,650
No way.

606
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:13,660
 Missed call 
Im Ju Gyeong 

607
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:15,560
I missed it.

608
00:46:17,910 --> 00:46:19,650
 ♡Boyfriend♡ 

609
00:46:19,650 --> 00:46:22,430
Since I earned some money thanks to you, this is on me.

610
00:46:22,430 --> 00:46:23,850
Why do you want a part-time job?

611
00:46:23,850 --> 00:46:25,650
To earn the enrollment fee for a makeup academy.

612
00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:26,730
A makeup academy?

613
00:46:26,730 --> 00:46:31,820
While looking at the future plan survey and thinking about what I like to do,

614
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:34,310
makeup came to my mind.

615
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:38,610
When I did Go Woon's stage makeup, my heart was pounding.

616
00:46:38,610 --> 00:46:41,450
You did make my sister look like someone else.

617
00:46:41,450 --> 00:46:43,950
- Here's your tteokbokki. 
- It's here!

618
00:46:53,890 --> 00:46:58,710
But ... have you dated many girls?

619
00:46:58,710 --> 00:47:01,420
- Why do you ask? 
 - What do you save your girlfriend as on your phone?

620
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:05,300
Do guys not put too much meaning in things like this?

621
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:10,860
They do. When I get a girlfriend, I save her super sweet as 'my love', 'my baby', 'my princess'.

622
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:12,960
With a bunch of hearts.

623
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:16,160
I see...

624
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:19,110
Right! I told you on our school trip.

625
00:47:19,110 --> 00:47:21,260
It's fine. Don't tell me.

626
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:23,300
I'm dating Lee Su Ho.

627
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:25,970
Seriously, you don't listen. I told you to not tell me.

628
00:47:25,970 --> 00:47:29,830
I don't want to tell you either. But I did make a scene crying that I like Lee Su Ho and stuff.

629
00:47:29,830 --> 00:47:31,110
How can I not tell you?

630
00:47:31,110 --> 00:47:33,520
I'm not congratulating.

631
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,990
You're eating so well. Should I order more?

632
00:47:36,990 --> 00:47:39,170
It's fine!

633
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:43,290
It seemed like other kids don't know. Is this a secret too?

634
00:47:43,290 --> 00:47:46,320
Yeah, I think it should be kept a secret for now.

635
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:48,890
And Lee Su Ho is willing to do that?

636
00:47:48,890 --> 00:47:50,050
Why?

637
00:47:50,050 --> 00:47:56,030
When I get a girlfriend, I want to brag and tell everyone.

638
00:47:56,030 --> 00:47:58,570
If I were him, I would be like that.

639
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:04,780
 - Bend down! Shh. 
 - Do we have to go this far? 

640
00:48:05,630 --> 00:48:07,850
Would he be upset?

641
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:12,550
- Is it spicy? 
 - No!

642
00:48:12,550 --> 00:48:15,750
It's perfect to my taste.

643
00:48:15,750 --> 00:48:18,080
Are you going home now?

644
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:20,670
They are from our middle school.

645
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:23,150
You're right.

646
00:48:26,850 --> 00:48:28,740
You seem to be taller.

647
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:32,330
You used to be shorter than me and got beat up all the time. When did you grow up so much?

648
00:48:32,330 --> 00:48:35,180
You're still talking about our preschool times.

649
00:48:43,070 --> 00:48:45,620
Get home safely.

650
00:48:54,410 --> 00:48:56,200
- I'll take you home.
 - Hello?

651
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:58,030
See you tomorrow.

652
00:48:58,030 --> 00:49:01,000
We must have missed each other's call.

653
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:07,110
Ow, my stomach. Why did I eat all of that when I can't handle the heat?

654
00:49:20,070 --> 00:49:21,300
What did you do today?

655
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:24,860
I had interviews for part-time jobs but got rejected from all of them.

656
00:49:31,870 --> 00:49:34,200
 But I made money for the first time. 

657
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:36,000
I bumped into Han Seo Jun—

658
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,530
Mr. Im?

659
00:49:38,110 --> 00:49:40,220
Master S-Su Ho?

660
00:49:41,550 --> 00:49:43,470
Mr. Im?

661
00:49:43,470 --> 00:49:45,420
Who?

662
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:48,330
Your d—

663
00:49:48,340 --> 00:49:50,650
 Im Ju Gyeong 

664
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:54,800
You can't.

665
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:00,200
How can they scam us at the scam victims' meeting?

666
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:02,470
They said we'll all go get them together,

667
00:50:02,470 --> 00:50:06,820
then they fled with all of the victims' plane and hotel fees.

668
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:10,240
They're so intelligent and planned all the details.

669
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:12,540
I think you fell for a very easy trick.

670
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:16,590
That's not true. They were... Anyway...

671
00:50:16,590 --> 00:50:21,210
I said that I won't come back until I catch him, so how can I go back home now?

672
00:50:21,210 --> 00:50:26,130
So you can't ever tell Ju Gyeong.

673
00:50:26,130 --> 00:50:28,620
How can I? They'll be worried. I'm going to call—

674
00:50:28,620 --> 00:50:30,550
No, you can't.

675
00:50:30,550 --> 00:50:34,100
If you tell them, I'm running away and never coming back.

676
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:35,740
Then what are you going to do?

677
00:50:35,740 --> 00:50:38,290
You said you're out of money.

678
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:43,880
Even if I freeze to death sleeping on this cold ground,

679
00:50:43,950 --> 00:50:48,450
I will never go back to my house.

680
00:50:48,450 --> 00:50:49,850
Okay.

681
00:50:50,930 --> 00:50:52,850
Then rest well.

682
00:50:52,850 --> 00:50:54,250
- Huh?
 - I'll get going.

683
00:50:54,250 --> 00:50:56,890
Hey, Master Su Ho! Just a minute.

684
00:50:57,930 --> 00:51:01,240
- Your name is Su Ho, right? 
 - Right.

685
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:06,000
Su Ho! Su Ho! You should protect, Su Ho. 
  (TN: "Suho" means  to guard, defend, protect) 

686
00:51:09,910 --> 00:51:11,470
Wow...

687
00:51:11,470 --> 00:51:13,740
A student lives alone in a place like this?

688
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:15,820
Mr. Lee Ju Heon must be really busy.

689
00:51:15,820 --> 00:51:17,950
You can shower in here.

690
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:35,580
Su Ho!

691
00:51:35,580 --> 00:51:37,700
- Are you okay? 
 - I... I...

692
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:42,020
I must have slipped. I can't move. Help me stand up.

693
00:51:48,310 --> 00:51:50,590
You can sleep here. I'll sleep on the sofa.

694
00:51:50,590 --> 00:51:52,790
How could I?

695
00:51:52,790 --> 00:51:55,330
I'm so shameless in front of my daughter's friend.

696
00:51:55,330 --> 00:51:56,920
I'll sleep outside.

697
00:51:56,920 --> 00:52:00,320
So you should just think of me as not being here and sleep comfortably.

698
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:02,430
Then, goodnight.

699
00:52:02,430 --> 00:52:07,050
Master Su Ho, thank you. Thank you, Master Su Ho.

700
00:52:08,210 --> 00:52:12,860
Without Dad, this house is a beggar's den.

701
00:52:12,860 --> 00:52:15,740
While you're doing that, go and clean my room too.

702
00:52:15,740 --> 00:52:18,600
- Then I should first clean you out. 
 - It's dirty!

703
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:20,750
You guys are going at it again!

704
00:52:20,750 --> 00:52:23,950
I'll clean, so leave it and eat some fruits.

705
00:52:23,950 --> 00:52:27,910
It's okay, Mom. You came from work so you must be tired. I'm almost done.

706
00:52:27,950 --> 00:52:33,120
♫ I considered it like a single flower petal

707
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:37,150
♫ In the wide open field

708
00:52:37,150 --> 00:52:46,120
♫ I've kept just an empty heart in my chest

709
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:50,930
♫ After being driven by the rain and wind

710
00:52:50,930 --> 00:52:56,330
♫ It is clear as the sun rises

711
00:52:56,330 --> 00:52:59,320
- ♫ The emptiness in my chest— 
 - Hey, hey, hey!

712
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:02,090
Don't sing that song. Don't sing!

713
00:53:02,090 --> 00:53:04,290
Don't sing!

714
00:53:05,370 --> 00:53:07,270
What's wrong with him?

715
00:53:07,270 --> 00:53:10,820
By the way, I wonder if your dad is starving himself now.

716
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:14,390
He must be eating and sleeping well.

717
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:23,250
Mister?

718
00:53:23,250 --> 00:53:26,810
You scared me. You woke up? I'm sorry.

719
00:53:26,810 --> 00:53:30,200
What are you doing early in the morning?

720
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:33,140
Because it's a Son Heung Min match.

721
00:53:33,140 --> 00:53:36,300
Oh, right! I had my alarm set.

722
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:37,590
You must be Heung Min's fan!

723
00:53:37,590 --> 00:53:39,430
Then shall we watch the second half together?

724
00:53:39,430 --> 00:53:41,410
Mister!

725
00:53:41,410 --> 00:53:43,950
First, let's watch the highlights of the first half.

726
00:53:49,340 --> 00:53:52,450
 He should've kicked it right away, not passed it around. 

727
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:55,580
Eat this.

728
00:53:56,490 --> 00:53:57,810
I don't really eat this early in the morning.

729
00:53:57,810 --> 00:53:59,950
It's different eating when you're watching soccer.

730
00:53:59,950 --> 00:54:03,400
If you don't eat this, you'll regret it. Now, eat this. Say 'Ah'.

731
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:05,130
I'll eat it myself.

732
00:54:05,130 --> 00:54:08,400
Alright, then. You don't know how delicious it is.

733
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:10,690
He's the same as Im Ju Gyeong.

734
00:54:10,690 --> 00:54:12,670
This looks tasty.

735
00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:17,810
It's... hot! It's hot!

736
00:54:17,810 --> 00:54:20,190
- My whole tongue got burned. 
 - Here, sir.

737
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:22,450
Eat slowly.

738
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:26,870
- But you're unexpectedly affectionate, Su Ho. 
  - With Son Heung Min's kick off, the second half begins. 

739
00:54:26,870 --> 00:54:29,390
Son Heung Min! Son Heung Min!

740
00:54:29,390 --> 00:54:32,380
 Which team will take the ticket to the championship final match? 

741
00:54:32,380 --> 00:54:33,980
 Oh, as we speak, 

742
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:36,540
 to tie the score, the players are moving fast from the very beginning of second half! 

743
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:37,890
 Early cross! 

744
00:54:37,890 --> 00:54:39,610
 Ah, missed it. 

745
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:40,930
  But then, just now! 

746
00:54:40,930 --> 00:54:42,530
 - Son Heung Min!   
 - Oh, oh!

747
00:54:42,530 --> 00:54:46,090
  Shoot! Goal! 

748
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:55,450
Su Ho! Su Ho!

749
00:55:55,450 --> 00:55:58,360
You only ate a little this morning. Eat this while you go.

750
00:55:58,360 --> 00:56:01,680
Study hard in class, and see you later when you come home.

751
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:04,940
That's not right. Since I'm leaving soon.

752
00:56:04,940 --> 00:56:06,220
Thanks.

753
00:56:06,220 --> 00:56:07,870
You're going home, right?

754
00:56:07,870 --> 00:56:09,410
I'm only protecting your secret up to today.

755
00:56:09,410 --> 00:56:12,110
I know. I'm leaving right after I do the dishes.

756
00:56:12,110 --> 00:56:14,520
I needed time to prepare my heart.

757
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:17,230
Prepare to get scolded by my wife.

758
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:24,360
That youngster has become sensible like a grown adult.

759
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:26,540
Is it because he grew up without a mother?

760
00:56:26,540 --> 00:56:28,610
Be careful of cars!

761
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:33,190
 Have a good day! 

762
00:56:36,410 --> 00:56:39,210
 - What will you be learning during gym time? 
 - Soccer! 

763
00:56:39,210 --> 00:56:42,420
 Oh, really? That sounds like fun. 

764
00:57:06,030 --> 00:57:09,190
- What's wrong with you? Are you directionally challenged? 
 - What do you mean?

765
00:57:09,190 --> 00:57:13,310
Why do you keep losing your way and going around in my mind?

766
00:57:13,310 --> 00:57:14,480
I understand.

767
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:17,990
I'll give you the chance to stay in my mind.

768
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:24,780
Um... Let's date... With me.

769
00:57:27,330 --> 00:57:32,100
Why? Are you so touched that you can't say anything?

770
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:36,480
Seriously so boring.

771
00:57:37,860 --> 00:57:38,860
Seriously so boring?

772
00:57:38,860 --> 00:57:41,690
Here. It's a café that I worked for.

773
00:57:41,690 --> 00:57:45,010
They're looking for a part-timer. I told them about you, so go there later.

774
00:57:45,010 --> 00:57:47,460
Wow. That's awesome.

775
00:57:47,460 --> 00:57:50,260
In one day? Thank you so much!

776
00:57:50,260 --> 00:57:54,730
Your skills are good. Well done, well done!

777
00:57:54,730 --> 00:57:57,380
You're seriously the best. Thank you!

778
00:57:57,380 --> 00:57:59,750
- Im Ju Gyeong. 
 - Huh?

779
00:58:03,870 --> 00:58:05,360
Let's go.

780
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:17,380
 About Coffee 

781
00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:19,840
Memorize the menu in a short amount of time.

782
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:22,070
Although the recipes for the drinks are all here.

783
00:58:22,070 --> 00:58:25,650
Before you get familiar with it, you should prioritize receiving orders and washing the dishes.

784
00:58:25,650 --> 00:58:28,000
- Okay. 
- Welcome!

785
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,830
We didn't wash the cups yet.

786
00:58:29,830 --> 00:58:32,930
- Can you wash the cups? 
 - Sure, I will.

787
00:58:32,930 --> 00:58:36,560
How can I help with your order?

788
00:58:56,050 --> 00:58:58,240
Oh no! Are you okay?

789
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:01,070
- I'm okay. 
 - Ah, what to do...

790
00:59:01,070 --> 00:59:03,190
  These are the pictures that have been uploaded onto the site. 

791
00:59:03,190 --> 00:59:05,610
 I chose the pictures well, didn't I? 

792
00:59:17,410 --> 00:59:19,680
Why would you send these?

793
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:21,730
You should have just roughly sent it.

794
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:23,560
 Will you delete this photo? 
 Delete 

795
00:59:24,380 --> 00:59:30,440
 Will you delete this photo? 

796
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:31,750
  Café Boss 

797
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:34,820
Yes, Boss?

798
00:59:35,410 --> 00:59:37,520
Oh, Im Ju Gyeong decided to work?

799
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:40,850
Yeah, thanks for introducing her to us.

800
00:59:40,850 --> 00:59:44,030
She's learning how to work right now.

801
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:48,260
Ju Gyeong, did you get hurt?

802
00:59:48,260 --> 00:59:50,320
What? She's hurt?

803
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:54,350
It just slightly touched me. I'm really okay.

804
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:05,040
Thank you.

805
01:00:06,300 --> 01:00:07,290
Seo Jun!

806
01:00:07,290 --> 01:00:09,070
Where's Im Ju Gyeong?

807
01:00:09,070 --> 01:00:11,470
- She left a bit earlier. 
 - What?

808
01:00:11,470 --> 01:00:13,480
Did you run over here?

809
01:00:14,250 --> 01:00:16,580
I must be crazy.

810
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:18,880
Why did I run over here?

811
01:00:19,950 --> 01:00:22,510
Hey, where'd you get that eyelash curler?

812
01:00:25,780 --> 01:00:28,750
What's with that rude jerk? He didn't even apologize.

813
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:30,430
Are you okay?

814
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:39,690
Han Seo Jun?

815
01:00:46,330 --> 01:00:49,000
But it looks like Unni didn't come yet. What about Im Ju Yeong?

816
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,510
Ju Yeong? He went to math tutoring.

817
01:00:51,510 --> 01:00:54,150
What? He's getting tutored?

818
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:56,880
He wanted tutoring saying his math grade isn't rising, so I let him.

819
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:59,370
You always say we don't have money.

820
01:00:59,850 --> 01:01:02,250
You said you're having it really hard with no customers at the store.

821
01:01:02,250 --> 01:01:05,730
Even if I don't have money, if my kids want it, then I should!

822
01:01:05,730 --> 01:01:08,130
If you also want tutoring, then tell me.

823
01:01:08,130 --> 01:01:11,090
I'll let you do it even if I get into debt.

824
01:01:11,090 --> 01:01:13,910
Then, give me 1.5 million won too!

825
01:01:13,910 --> 01:01:15,020
1.5 million won?

826
01:01:15,020 --> 01:01:17,360
I don't know.

827
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:19,360
I'm the only one thinking about you.

828
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:21,310
I'm not going to do this! Order Ju Yeong to do this.

829
01:01:21,310 --> 01:01:23,890
Im Ju Gyeong! Where are you going?

830
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:29,980
Did your part-time go well?

831
01:01:29,980 --> 01:01:32,880
I was so clumsy today.

832
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:35,760
I should try my best to learn and do well from now on.

833
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:38,040
Your voice has no energy.

834
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:40,800
- Are you outside? 
 - Yeah.

835
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:43,250
I felt stuffy, so I came outside.

836
01:01:43,250 --> 01:01:45,190
Then do you want to come here?

837
01:01:47,850 --> 01:01:50,230
I feel better when I exercise.

838
01:01:50,230 --> 01:01:53,130
Is that so? How do I do this?

839
01:01:53,130 --> 01:01:55,060
Grab my collar.

840
01:01:56,230 --> 01:02:00,320
Grab the sleeve, grab this, go inside, and...

841
01:02:05,470 --> 01:02:07,090
Grab and...

842
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:11,560
♫  I wouldn't know why I'm like this  ♫

843
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:13,770
Good job. Now with what you learned...

844
01:02:13,770 --> 01:02:15,890
- Flip me over. 
 - How can I flip you over?

845
01:02:15,890 --> 01:02:18,870
If you successfully flip me over, I'll listen to one wish.

846
01:02:18,870 --> 01:02:20,480
It's for real, right? You're not lying, right?

847
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:22,340
- Would I lie to you? 
 - Nice.

848
01:02:22,340 --> 01:02:26,540
♫  Call me maybe, you  ♫

849
01:02:26,540 --> 01:02:30,680
♫  Make me thrilled again. Love you  ♫

850
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:36,190
♫  How far can we go tonight  ♫

851
01:02:36,190 --> 01:02:38,560
♫  Stay with me  ♫

852
01:02:48,130 --> 01:02:50,580
Come here!

853
01:02:53,150 --> 01:02:55,260
Yes! I flipped you over!

854
01:02:55,260 --> 01:02:58,290
- Isn't that cheating?
- You should accept that much since it's my first time.

855
01:02:58,290 --> 01:02:59,780
Okay, fine.

856
01:02:59,780 --> 01:03:02,300
- What's your wish? 
 - Wish?

857
01:03:03,970 --> 01:03:05,870
You can even ask me to enroll you in a makeup academy.

858
01:03:05,870 --> 01:03:08,490
What? That's really expensive!

859
01:03:08,490 --> 01:03:09,920
Even if it's expensive.

860
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:11,780
Are you bragging that you're rich?

861
01:03:11,780 --> 01:03:14,560
- Tell me quickly. 
 - You must have watched many dramas.

862
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:16,780
It's fine.

863
01:03:18,570 --> 01:03:20,590
I thought of a wish.

864
01:03:20,590 --> 01:03:22,230
What is it?

865
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:24,500
It's...

866
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:28,390
a bit embarrassing.

867
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:41,510
No, forget it, forget it.

868
01:03:41,510 --> 01:03:44,040
I'm going to go change my clothes.

869
01:04:04,350 --> 01:04:06,480
  Lee Su Ho  

870
01:04:09,740 --> 01:04:13,300
 The person you are trying to reach is unavailable at this time. 

871
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:20,280
Why did you send me a message?

872
01:04:23,300 --> 01:04:26,480
  Girlfriend ♡ 

873
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:33,550
  I saved you as my boyfriend on my phone. 

874
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:46,100
There was a shower earlier.

875
01:04:46,100 --> 01:04:50,910
I know. We almost got rained on since we don't have an umbrella.

876
01:04:50,910 --> 01:04:53,080
We are lucky.

877
01:05:07,020 --> 01:05:08,270
Are you okay?

878
01:05:08,270 --> 01:05:10,560
I guess we were unlucky.

879
01:05:29,390 --> 01:05:30,840
What are you doing?

880
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:31,990
Huh?

881
01:05:31,990 --> 01:05:34,130
Are you not coming up?

882
01:05:34,130 --> 01:05:36,200
Oh, right.

883
01:05:47,830 --> 01:05:51,060
Wait a moment. I will bring you clothes.

884
01:05:51,060 --> 01:05:52,800
Okay.

885
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:08,630
- Do you want to eat? 
 - Should we watch TV?

886
01:06:08,630 --> 01:06:10,940
- Do you want to watch TV? 
 - Let's eat!

887
01:06:10,940 --> 01:06:13,530
Let's eat. You didn't eat dinner yet, right?

888
01:06:13,530 --> 01:06:17,620
I will make you something delicious, or should we order something so it comes quick?

889
01:06:17,620 --> 01:06:19,730
I'm fine with anything.

890
01:06:19,730 --> 01:06:22,010
You are okay with pizza, right?

891
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:49,160
What is this?

892
01:06:49,160 --> 01:06:52,060
- What is this room? 
 - Huh?

893
01:06:52,150 --> 01:06:55,840
It seems like you locked it tight. Did you hide something weird?

894
01:06:55,840 --> 01:07:00,590
- It's not that. 
 - Is there like a corpse in there, like in the movies?

895
01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:06,100
Are you curious?

896
01:07:06,100 --> 01:07:08,640
  The door is unlocked. 

897
01:07:18,740 --> 01:07:21,770
You do music?

898
01:07:21,770 --> 01:07:24,270
I wanted to.

899
01:07:24,270 --> 01:07:26,470
Then how about now?

900
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:32,960
But after what happened to  Se Yeon, I couldn't anymore.

901
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:37,320
Se Yeon taught me how to compose for the first time.

902
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:46,320
It was too hard to see this room, so I didn't come in here often.

903
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:49,640
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have.

904
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:51,740
But now I feel okay.

905
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:55,250
Maybe because you're in here with me.

906
01:07:58,120 --> 01:08:00,870
Should we tell other kids that we're dating?

907
01:08:00,870 --> 01:08:03,210
Why all of the sudden? You wanted to keep it a secret.

908
01:08:03,210 --> 01:08:07,240
It seems like I just decided that on my own without asking you.

909
01:08:07,240 --> 01:08:09,100
If you are dragged to the rooftop?

910
01:08:09,100 --> 01:08:11,530
I'll just be dragged, I guess!

911
01:08:11,530 --> 01:08:13,410
I don't care either way.

912
01:08:13,410 --> 01:08:17,870
It doesn't change the fact that you are my girlfriend.

913
01:08:21,990 --> 01:08:27,960
You know the song you let me listen to before? You said it wasn't released, right?

914
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:30,370
Did you compose that song?

915
01:08:30,370 --> 01:08:32,400
Yeah.

916
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:38,080
Se Yeon wrote the lyrics.

917
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:40,740
I see.

918
01:08:40,740 --> 01:08:43,540
The song was really good.

919
01:08:48,810 --> 01:08:51,030
Do you want me to play?

920
01:08:51,030 --> 01:08:52,680
Yeah!

921
01:08:55,590 --> 01:08:58,440
I quit piano after playing Beyer's first book when I was younger.

922
01:08:58,440 --> 01:09:03,300
It's been a while for me too, so don't have high expectations.

923
01:09:28,650 --> 01:09:31,650
It's a sound coming from outside the window!

924
01:09:38,910 --> 01:09:43,110
Is it about to rain? I hear thunder.

925
01:09:52,020 --> 01:09:55,280
The piano sounds so good! It's an expensive one, right?

926
01:10:01,210 --> 01:10:03,260
I'll go get it real quick.

927
01:10:04,170 --> 01:10:06,030
Wait.

928
01:10:11,100 --> 01:10:12,850
Seriously...

929
01:10:12,850 --> 01:10:14,440
Thank you, eat it well!

930
01:10:14,440 --> 01:10:16,800
Thank you.

931
01:10:33,330 --> 01:10:35,370
 I was going to do some cleaning at least. 

932
01:10:35,370 --> 01:10:38,910
 But the house is already clean. There's nothing to put away. 

933
01:10:38,910 --> 01:10:41,050
 What's in it? 

934
01:10:41,050 --> 01:10:44,990
 Why is there alcohol in a house that a student lives alone in? 

935
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:47,710
 This expensive thing... 

936
01:10:52,970 --> 01:10:57,850
 I don't know if this has gone bad. I should try it. 

937
01:10:57,850 --> 01:11:01,520
 Su Ho, this ahjussi is just going to have a taste. 

938
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:03,550
 So it's not obvious. 

939
01:11:45,130 --> 01:11:47,430
Do you want to eat while watching the movie?

940
01:11:51,900 --> 01:11:53,540
Delicious smell!

941
01:11:53,540 --> 01:11:55,130
What should we watch?

942
01:11:55,130 --> 01:11:58,180
I can't say.  Do you want to watch a horror movie?

943
01:11:58,180 --> 01:11:59,590
Something else.

944
01:11:59,590 --> 01:12:02,400
Why? Can you not watch something scary?

945
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:06,830
Since it rained earlier, there are a lot of good movies like music movies.

946
01:12:06,830 --> 01:12:09,130
You are a total fan of horror comic books, yet you can't watch horror movies?

947
01:12:09,130 --> 01:12:13,090
We already read comic books everyday, so we don't have to watch horror movies too.

948
01:12:13,090 --> 01:12:15,840
It's okay, it's okay. If it's scary, I will cover your eyes for you.

949
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:17,340
It's not that bad!

950
01:12:17,340 --> 01:12:19,480
Turn off the lights. You have to watch horror movies in the dark.

951
01:12:19,480 --> 01:12:20,830
How about something more fun?

952
01:12:20,830 --> 01:12:22,840
 - He's on a date with his girlfriend.  
 - I'll choose.

953
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:25,660
 I'm such a nuisance. 

954
01:12:30,470 --> 01:12:32,630
- Here you go. 
 - Okay.

955
01:13:07,490 --> 01:13:10,640
  Our Su Ho is a man. 

956
01:13:17,570 --> 01:13:19,930
You really haven't watched horror movies, huh?

957
01:13:19,930 --> 01:13:23,010
Ghosts don't come out in scenes like this.

958
01:13:31,510 --> 01:13:33,670
You said they don't come out!

959
01:14:29,640 --> 01:14:31,570
Dad?

960
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:41,660


961
01:14:42,550 --> 01:14:46,650
♫  Love so fine  ♫

962
01:14:46,650 --> 01:14:55,350
♫  Come closer, approach me. Lean in my arms  ♫

963
01:14:55,350 --> 01:15:02,610
♫  Always in my heart, I think I’m in love with you  ♫

964
01:15:04,010 --> 01:15:08,640
♫  Every day with you  ♫

965
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:12,160
♫  Everything is like a dream  ♫

966
01:15:12,160 --> 01:15:13,170
  I miss you. 

967
01:15:13,170 --> 01:15:14,740
  Me too. 

968
01:15:14,740 --> 01:15:18,020
 Since when were you guys dating? Why didn't you tell me? 

969
01:15:18,020 --> 01:15:19,740
  Me and Han Seo Jun? 

970
01:15:19,740 --> 01:15:23,740
  Ju Gyeong, should I confess after giving this to him? 

971
01:15:23,740 --> 01:15:26,910
  Have you ever liked the same girl as your close friend? 

972
01:15:26,910 --> 01:15:28,230
  No! 

973
01:15:28,230 --> 01:15:30,150
  Why are you guys coming in together? 

974
01:15:30,150 --> 01:15:35,300
  Usually when your boyfriend comes to visit your house, don't you show him an album or something? 

975
01:15:35,300 --> 01:15:38,730
  I don't like seeing you guys talk or even meet eyes.   

976
01:15:38,730 --> 01:15:41,850
 - Then we can't see each other? 
 - Su Ho! 

977
01:15:41,850 --> 01:15:47,010
♫  Love so fine   ♫
