1
00:00:35,952 --> 00:00:37,787
-Hello.
-Hi.

2
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:39,330
-This is your second child?
-Yes.

3
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:41,124
He's a sturdy-looking fellow.

4
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:43,042
She is a baby girl.

5
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:47,964
But Hee-kyung is so pretty…

6
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:50,717
How are you so pretty, Hee-kyung?

7
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,594
She'll run for Miss Korea, right?

8
00:00:56,347 --> 00:00:59,601
Ever since I was young,
I could tell from the looks people gave me

9
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:02,479
that I'm not pretty.

10
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:03,480
General.

11
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:05,482
-General!
-You did it, Grandpa!

12
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:07,442
-Can you take that back?
-No.

13
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:10,361
-Please take that back.
-No way!

14
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:12,781
In Korean chess, what's done is done.

15
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:14,199
-How did it go? Who won?
-No takebacks.

16
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:15,909
-Really?
-I can't take it back.

17
00:01:15,992 --> 00:01:16,910
By the way,

18
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:20,830
how is it that Ju-kyung
solely takes after her mom's side?

19
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:23,083
She'd be better off
if she had Jae-pil's eyes.

20
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:25,418
-Consider getting her plastic surgery.
-Come on.

21
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:26,753
-Don't say that.
-Honey.

22
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:29,339
-She doesn't look like our family.
-Father!

23
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:31,633
-Grandpa!
-You'll hurt her feelings.

24
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:37,096
Your grades are all that matter, got it?

25
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:50,318
Cartoons had me dreaming
of a magical transformation

26
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:54,155
where an average-looking girl
turns into a pretty fairy in a flash.

27
00:01:57,325 --> 00:01:59,369
-What the heck?
-What is that?

28
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:00,703
-What is she?
-What is that?

29
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:02,997
She must think she's a fairy or something.

30
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:04,749
She thinks she's a princess.

31
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:06,543
Now, turn into an ugly monster!

32
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:08,545
Go away, you monster!

33
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:47,041
That was when I realized…

34
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:48,501
CURSED MASK

35
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:52,755
…I'm more of a heroine
with a cursed mask in horror comics

36
00:02:54,048 --> 00:02:55,758
rather than a girl in romance comics.

37
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:07,186
CURSED MASK

38
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:23,745
The depiction of the professor

39
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:28,041
who throws himself into meaningless work
reports on modern society's absurdity.

40
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:31,127
Let's look at the question below.
You'll find different types.

41
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:33,129
Among them, number one is…

42
00:03:33,212 --> 00:03:34,964
I didn't realize it was time already.

43
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:38,218
Hand in the homework by tomorrow.
That's it for today.

44
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:39,552
-Okay.
-Let's hit the snack bar.

45
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:41,262
Let's go.

46
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:43,056
-Hey, Sam-mi.
-Got it.

47
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:50,563
My hair got flat.

48
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:52,440
Who told you to sleep in class?

49
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:54,943
-Goodness.
-I'm sorry!

50
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:57,153
-What are you doing?
-You're here.

51
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,071
What?

52
00:03:58,154 --> 00:03:59,530
BASED ON WEBTOON TRUE BEAUTY
BY YAONGYI

53
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:06,371
Would you like to read this?

54
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:08,248
Not sure.

55
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:15,505
Would you like to listen to this?

56
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:16,965
Not sure.

57
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:25,598
Sam-mi, I want to try your lip tint.

58
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,934
Using her lip tint won't do you any good.

59
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:29,269
Not doing it for you, am I?

60
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,104
You're pissing me off.

61
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:32,647
Hey, look at her.

62
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:38,278
-What is she doing?
-How ridiculous.

63
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:39,320
Hey, Dumpling.

64
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:43,199
-Hey, Dumpling.
-Hey, Dumpling.

65
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:46,953
Hey, Dumpling!

66
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:49,122
Did you call me?

67
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:51,207
Who else is called Dumpling here?

68
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,918
What's up?
Don't you have an errand to run?

69
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:56,170
You mean, now? Got it.

70
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:59,007
She's going to do the delivery.
She's a professional.

71
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,842
A professional dumpling courier.

72
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:16,816
Two with meat and one with kimchi, right?

73
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:19,944
Enjoy your snacks, kids.

74
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:21,863
-I--
-Ma'am, two dumplings.

75
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,033
It's my turn.

76
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:26,034
-What the…
-Jeez.

77
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:27,535
Here you go. Enjoy!

78
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:28,453
-Thanks!
-Thanks!

79
00:05:29,537 --> 00:05:31,205
-Two with meat and--
-One with kimchi, right?

80
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:32,707
Yes.

81
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:35,626
Thank you.

82
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:37,503
Hey, you came!

83
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,896
Is Hyun-bin not here yet?

84
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:11,537
Hey, girl.

85
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,581
Hyun-bin.

86
00:06:14,832 --> 00:06:15,833
Wait, is this…

87
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:17,210
Crash?

88
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,921
I knew you'd get it right away.

89
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:22,799
Of course. This one's a classic.

90
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:26,552
Just as I thought.
You and I have the same musical taste.

91
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:29,055
One moment.

92
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,232
You're so dreamy.

93
00:06:43,861 --> 00:06:46,489
Now that's what I'm talking about.

94
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:51,702
Calm down, heart. Stop acting up.

95
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:53,579
Stop acting up.

96
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:02,004
Stop acting up!

97
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:04,465
Sorry, what did you say?

98
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:09,011
Nothing.

99
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:11,013
-Get it.
-Hey!

100
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:14,016
-Jeez.
-Where's Dumpling?

101
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,102
Is she making the dumplings herself?

102
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:17,812
Goodness, look at her.

103
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:19,355
Why? What is it?

104
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,857
-What is it?
-What?

105
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,191
Who is that person?

106
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,277
Isn't that the guy

107
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,529
who always flirts with you
at the cafeteria?

108
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:29,991
Maybe they have something in common.

109
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,749
-Enjoy your meal.
-Thanks.

110
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:44,922
Isn't Hyun-bin so dreamy?

111
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:46,466
Not sure.

112
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:48,801
He said we have
the same taste in music earlier,

113
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:50,636
and he smiled at me just now.

114
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,264
Don't you think he likes me a little?

115
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:55,933
Not sure.

116
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:58,060
I'll tell him how I feel tomorrow.

117
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,146
Great idea, right?

118
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:02,773
Not sure.

119
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:04,317
Hey, look at Ju-kyung.

120
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,985
Black tights with white socks.

121
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:07,111
-Horrifying. Hey.
-What?

122
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:08,988
Would you date her for ten million won?

123
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:12,158
-Not even for a hundred million won.
-Me neither.

124
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:15,620
I'll have my lunch later.

125
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:16,579
What?

126
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:19,749
Come on, move.

127
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:24,754
-Enjoy your meal.
-Thank you.

128
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,215
-Come on.
-The kimchi looks great.

129
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:28,174
Thank you.

130
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:31,010
Enjoy your meal.

131
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:34,305
Hey, Hyun-bin.

132
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:39,852
Can we meet up for a second
during tomorrow's lunch hour?

133
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:42,355
Tomorrow?

134
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:44,065
Sure.

135
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:45,942
Hey, look at Dumpling.

136
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:53,574
She's really trying to make a move?

137
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:33,698
Do it harder.

138
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:35,575
What brought you out, son?

139
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:37,451
-Are you hungry? Want some fruit?
-No.

140
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:41,789
Lim Ju-kyung.

141
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:44,667
What were you doing in the kitchen
instead of studying?

142
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,127
I just worked on some things.

143
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:48,379
You should work on your grades.

144
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:50,381
Your last test scores dropped again--

145
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:52,091
Fine. I'll work on it.

146
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:54,719
Lim Ju-kyung! I'm still talking.
Where are you going?

147
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:57,638
She said she's got it.
Let me get your neck.

148
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:00,933
I don't get who she takes after.

149
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:08,441
-Come on, do my left side.
-Okay.

150
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:16,449
I CAN'T WAIT ANY LONGER.
CAN YOU RETURN MY INVESTMENT?

151
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:18,618
Focus.

152
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:20,411
Yes, one second.

153
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:21,746
The door is open.

154
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:23,998
-My daughter, you're home!
-Yes.

155
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:27,376
I need to go now, right now.

156
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,295
Number one? Number two?

157
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:31,964
Number two.

158
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:34,091
-I'm in here!
-Hey, you little…

159
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:36,802
I could make you eat my hot dump!

160
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:40,806
-Use the one in the master bedroom.
-Master bedroom…

161
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,308
-It's coming.
-Hold it in.

162
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:44,852
-It's coming.
-Don't move too much.

163
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:46,437
Don't forget to breathe.

164
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,521
Try Lamaze breathing.

165
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:55,154
ABANDONED CHILD

00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:01,118
METAL METAL BAND CONCERT TICKET

167
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:07,041
TO HYUN-BIN

168
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:08,918
"You are a dummy."

169
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:12,046
"A dummy for not knowing
how I feel about you."

170
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:15,549
"And I'm a dummy
for only thinking about you."

171
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:19,720
"You dummy.
Of course, I know how you feel."

172
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:21,847
My gosh!

173
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:26,185
"Will you be my girlfriend
starting today?"

174
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:34,568
Hey, Lim Ju-bal, keep the music…

175
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:38,239
I want to poke my eyes out!

176
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:41,325
What's wrong with her?

177
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,836
JEONG SE-YEON, I'LL ALWAYS
KEEP YOU IN MY HEART

178
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:53,421
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, SE-YEON.
HOPE YOU ARE HAPPY IN HEAVEN.

179
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:56,507
His fans are funny.

180
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,759
Didn't they all trash-talk him
before his death?

181
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:01,220
And now they are pretending to be sad?

182
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:02,930
They're so two-faced.

183
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:07,226
I'm going to tell my crush
how I feel today.

184
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:08,811
I'm so nervous.

185
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:10,187
Cheer me on for courage.

186
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:12,898
I'm so nervous.

187
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:15,484
I admire your courage. You can do it!

188
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:17,903
I hope he likes you back!

189
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:19,238
LET US KNOW HOW IT GOES

190
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:40,301
-Hey. Seriously, stop it.
-Watch it.

191
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:46,640
Jeez.

192
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:49,810
Hey, Sam-mi is here.

193
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:52,480
-Really?
-Where? Let me see.

194
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:54,773
-It's really Sam-mi.
-Let her through.

195
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:58,652
-She looks prettier in person.
-She's beautiful.

196
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:02,114
Hey, give Sam-mi your seat.

197
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:03,449
Sam-mi, you can sit here.

198
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:05,034
-She's so stunning.
-Look at her.

199
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:06,285
Her look is unmatched.

200
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:08,829
I can't believe this.

201
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:13,417
What? She sat on his lap?

202
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:14,585
What is this?

203
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:15,586
What the heck?

204
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,839
I'm sorry.

205
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:30,142
What the…

206
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:32,645
-Hey.
-I'll get you the dumplings.

207
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:36,732
What was that?

208
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:40,319
-Look what she brought.
-What?

209
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:42,947
-Dumpling brought something?
-What's this?

210
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:46,242
What? Cookies?

211
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:48,327
-So ugly.
-Looks tacky.

212
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:49,537
At least she tried.

213
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:52,373
"You are a dummy."

214
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:54,166
"A dummy for not knowing
how I feel about you."

215
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,001
"I'm a dummy too."

216
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:58,420
Jeez, the lines are so lame.

217
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:00,798
-Hey.
-Yes?

218
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:02,424
Is she asking him out today?

219
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:04,176
Well…

220
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,136
Can't even get a word out?

221
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,556
I guess like attracts like.

222
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:17,356
Hyun-bin.

223
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:19,233
Yes, Sam-mi. What's up?

224
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:20,192
Are you busy?

225
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,736
Do you have something to say to me?

226
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,363
Well…

227
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:28,659
Are you dating Lim Ju-kyung?

228
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:29,577
What?

229
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:33,622
-Why do you ask?
-I was shocked when I heard the rumor.

230
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,749
You are like clean spring water,

231
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:40,212
and she's like sewer water way downstream.

232
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:43,757
You are way out of her league.

233
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:46,010
Yes, of course.

234
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:47,761
She must have mistaken your kindness

235
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:50,431
and thought that she had a shot.

236
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:51,390
Right?

237
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:53,684
I know I'm too nice.

238
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:54,643
To be honest,

239
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:57,855
the rumor that you're
going out with Ju-kyung

240
00:14:57,938 --> 00:14:59,565
really broke my heart.

241
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:05,571
I'm the bad guy for making you upset.
Seriously, it's unforgivable.

242
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:07,573
Hyun-bin, you bad guy!

243
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:10,117
Hyun-bin, don't do that.

244
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,453
You could hurt your handsome face.

245
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:17,082
I'll see you again later.

246
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,542
Later when?

247
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:20,419
Today? I have some time now too.

248
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:21,337
Right now…

249
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:23,422
Perhaps soon?

250
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:24,340
All right, Sam-mi.

251
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:25,883
I'll DM you. See you soon.

252
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:27,009
Yes, let's.

253
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:30,679
I'll send you a message!

254
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:33,432
-That was so easy.
-So naive.

255
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:40,230
MORNING CARE

256
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:41,440
AESTHETICIAN LICENSE

257
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:45,611
Done. Perfect!

258
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:49,073
Both brows are symmetrical
like a decalcomania.

259
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:52,326
Your eye is as keen as ever.

260
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:55,829
-Can I have some coffee before I go?
-Of course, dear client.

261
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:59,833
Now, let me see.

262
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:02,628
It came out too subtle last time.

263
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:05,673
Natural and subtle are very on-trend.

264
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:07,508
But I want them to be noticeable.

265
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:11,637
All right, just leave them to me.

266
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:16,934
By the way, your handsome husband
hasn't been around lately.

267
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:19,770
I'm not sure what he's up to.

268
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:22,398
He's on the phone at all times.

269
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:25,192
Maybe he's having an affair.

270
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:26,694
Let him have an affair.

271
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:28,946
I'm okay as long as it's not about money.

272
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:36,495
What is it? You want your eyebrows done?

273
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:37,955
Who's Lim Jae-pil's wife?

274
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:46,755
What is this?

275
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:49,258
These are concert tickets,

276
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,344
cookies I've made,

277
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,596
-and…
-And what?

278
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:57,808
And…

279
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:02,354
my heart.

280
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:06,233
Hyun-bin, I like you.

281
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:07,276
What?

282
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:10,404
Are you asking me out or something?

283
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,826
I'm Hyun-bin.

284
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:16,785
Wang Hyun-bin.

285
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,038
Sorry?

286
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:21,749
Okay.

287
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,919
You thought I would date you
if you said you liked me?

288
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:31,884
You told me
I'm a good person the other day,

289
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:34,261
and we have the same taste.

290
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:35,220
Hey.

291
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:38,766
I took pity on you for being bullied.
Is this how you repay me?

292
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:40,350
Hey.

293
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:43,896
If you don't have the looks,
you should at least be sharp-witted.

294
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:45,189
Know your place.

295
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:52,154
Instead of wasting your time like this,

296
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:54,531
take a look in the mirror.

297
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:09,922
-You're recording this, right?
-Gosh, poor Dumpling.

298
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:14,009
So that's how the ugliest person
in our school confessed her feelings.

299
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,719
A round of applause, everyone!

300
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:23,060
Let's hear your thoughts
on being crushed by your crush.

301
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:24,144
-Let's hear it.
-Let's hear it.

302
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:29,024
Goodness, you look really ugly on camera.

303
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:31,110
-Hey, come on tell us.
-Stop it.

304
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:32,486
You're already in the video.

305
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:33,654
Come on, say something.

306
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:35,072
I said, stop it.

307
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:37,658
-"I said, stop it."
-Hey.

308
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:39,701
Who do you think you're pushing?

309
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:40,869
Have you lost it?

310
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:02,182
Why do you hate me so much?

311
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,483
Why do you hate me?

312
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:16,113
I haven't done anything wrong to you,

313
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:19,449
but why do you hate me so much?

314
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:26,790
Hey.

315
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:30,627
Do you really want to know?

316
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:36,967
Because you are ugly.

317
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:40,345
You have cooties now.

318
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:42,598
-Right.
-Don't come near me.

319
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:44,224
-I forgot about that.
-Don't be ridiculous.

320
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:45,350
-Come on.
-Stop it.

321
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:47,728
-That was just like her. Do it again.
-"Stop it."

322
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:49,438
Did you see how she fell earlier?

323
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:52,024
"I said, stop it."

324
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:54,735
-Where is she going?
-"I said, stop it."

325
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:55,736
Where are you going?

326
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:58,864
-"I said, stop it."
-Look at her crying. I hate it.

327
00:19:58,947 --> 00:19:59,781
Whatever.

328
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,122
YONGPA HIGH ANONYMOUS FORUM

329
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,833
The guy is lousy too.
She has neither looks nor good taste.

330
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:12,419
-She's the ugliest girl at school.
-She has confidence despite her looks.

331
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:14,588
How is she going to
show her face at school?

332
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:18,800
Damn it!

333
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:04,012
Instead of wasting your time like this,

334
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:05,639
take a look in the mirror.

335
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:09,434
If you don't have the looks,
you should at least be sharp-witted.

336
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:10,811
Know your place.

337
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:13,939
Because you are ugly.

338
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:47,472
Look, everyone.

339
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:49,808
Here comes our superstar!

340
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:56,231
-Troll!
-Troll!

341
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:58,150
-Troll!
-Guys, look at that!

342
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:06,658
-Troll!
-Troll!

343
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:12,706
-Troll!
-Troll!

344
00:22:17,085 --> 00:22:19,588
Nobody likes me.

345
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:26,053
How can I possibly go to school tomorrow?

346
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:17,247
WE MISS YOU AND LOVE YOU

347
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:20,083
CELEBRATING THE 18TH BIRTHDAY
OF JEONG SE-YEON

348
00:24:23,503 --> 00:24:27,257
CELEBRATING THE 18TH BIRTHDAY
OF JEONG SE-YEON

349
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:30,802
What a shame.

350
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:33,847
He was only 18.

351
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:48,653
I…

352
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:55,035
I don't want to die.

353
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:02,083
It's so cold.

354
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:51,007
What a relief.

355
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:22,789
What was that about?

356
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:25,625
My glasses.

357
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:27,544
Where are they?

358
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:29,963
My glasses.

359
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:33,800
My glasses.

360
00:26:34,801 --> 00:26:36,761
I can't see anything without my glasses.

361
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:38,430
Where are they?

362
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:40,890
What were you doing?

363
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,227
Were you going to jump?

364
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:47,522
Are you crazy?

365
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:49,733
Are you out of your mind?

366
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:53,361
Why would you do that?
What's troubling you so badly?

367
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:56,239
Why would you make such a choice?

368
00:26:56,823 --> 00:26:58,241
I wasn't going to kill--

369
00:26:58,325 --> 00:26:59,993
Face your life with such courage.

370
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:04,581
Haven't you thought of
the people you'd leave behind

371
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:08,168
and how much they would grieve?

372
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:10,712
-Well…
-Someone out there

373
00:27:11,504 --> 00:27:13,715
might suffer forever with guilt…

374
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:17,427
for failing to save you.

375
00:27:20,555 --> 00:27:21,806
Did you think about that?

376
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:31,149
There's nothing you can do…

377
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:33,818
for a dead person.

378
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:37,489
So don't do it.

379
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:02,889
What?

380
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:04,933
Are you going to jump after I leave?

381
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:08,061
No.

382
00:28:08,895 --> 00:28:09,938
Well…

383
00:28:10,605 --> 00:28:12,273
Hold on.

384
00:28:13,316 --> 00:28:14,526
My glasses.

385
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:20,615
My glasses. Wait up!

386
00:28:20,698 --> 00:28:22,033
ELEVATOR MAINTENANCE CHECK

387
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:31,835
What is it?

388
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:33,420
Is it out of order?

389
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:36,047
Wait for me, sir.

390
00:28:38,758 --> 00:28:40,927
Wait for me.

391
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:44,431
Wait up.

392
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:47,350
I lost my glasses because of you

393
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:49,769
and can't see anything.

394
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:53,064
My prescription is negative eight.

395
00:28:55,608 --> 00:28:57,193
Without my glasses,

396
00:28:58,069 --> 00:28:59,863
I can't tell what's what.

397
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:21,384
Hey.

398
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:22,927
Are you still there?

399
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:28,850
He really must be gone.

400
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:34,230
What's with my life?

401
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:45,867
What?

402
00:29:48,661 --> 00:29:50,872
You didn't leave?

403
00:29:51,372 --> 00:29:52,874
Hold my hand and get up.

404
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:54,375
Okay.

405
00:30:03,092 --> 00:30:04,844
Watch where you're grabbing!

406
00:30:06,554 --> 00:30:11,643
I didn't do it on purpose.

407
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:16,397
Just get on my back.

408
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:24,239
Thank you.

409
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:37,418
I'm heavier than I look, right, sir?

410
00:30:39,295 --> 00:30:40,630
You look heavy too.

411
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:42,715
Why are you calling me "sir"?

412
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:57,272
Excuse me.

413
00:30:58,898 --> 00:31:00,692
I have a question, sir.

414
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:02,777
Why were you also up on the--

415
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:03,695
Ma'am,

416
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:05,780
just speak up.

417
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:09,158
It echoes if I don't whisper.

418
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:10,076
It's scary.

419
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:13,162
And don't call me "ma'am."
I'm wearing a school uniform.

420
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:20,545
Did someone you know

421
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:23,965
jump from a rooftop?

422
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:29,012
I'm just saying.

423
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:32,765
We don't even know each other,
but you saved me and got so angry.

424
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:35,310
That's why I wondered
if someone close to you had died.

425
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:38,062
If you say one more word,

426
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,189
I'll drop you right here.

427
00:31:46,195 --> 00:31:48,072
How are you so heavy?

428
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:53,077
You can do it!

429
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:53,995
Ma'am!

430
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:55,788
Okay, I'll stop.

431
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:57,916
I'm shutting up.

432
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:15,975
Sir,

433
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:18,561
wasn't it out of order?

434
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:21,731
It was just a maintenance check.

435
00:32:21,814 --> 00:32:23,358
You didn't hear the announcement?

436
00:32:27,695 --> 00:32:29,989
Maybe we should have waited.

437
00:32:45,421 --> 00:32:46,881
Excuse me, sir!

438
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:52,220
Seriously?

439
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,098
What is it?

440
00:32:57,642 --> 00:32:58,518
Well…

441
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:02,772
I know I'm not in a place
to be saying this…

442
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:07,568
but hang in there.

443
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:12,865
The dead…

444
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:18,496
wouldn't have wanted the people
they left behind to suffer for too long.

445
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:23,668
So please be happy.

446
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:25,586
You have to be.

447
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:32,552
-Sir, please take me to Bucheon.
-Okay.

448
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:47,942
Why did you go even up there

449
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:50,361
when you don't have the courage to do it,
you idiot?

450
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:53,698
Darn it, those were fairly new glasses.

451
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:55,533
Mom's going to be furious.

452
00:33:57,994 --> 00:34:00,872
After the beep,
your call will be forwarded to voicemail

453
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:02,457
and will be charged accordingly.

454
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:06,669
Mom, I wanted to hear your voice.

455
00:34:09,964 --> 00:34:10,882
Never mind.

456
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:13,468
I guess this is better.

457
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,890
I don't think I could bring myself to die
after hearing your voice.

458
00:34:19,515 --> 00:34:21,476
Thanks for having me…

459
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:26,147
and raising me for the last 18 years.

460
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:30,193
I'll reincarnate as your daughter
again in my next life.

461
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:32,570
I'll see you then.

462
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:38,618
Please make me pretty
the next time you have me.

463
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:47,251
Oh, no.

464
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:51,005
What if she already heard it?

465
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:53,007
She can't.

466
00:34:57,136 --> 00:34:59,263
Why won't she answer?

467
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:02,266
Sir, can you drive faster, please?

468
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:03,184
Sure.

469
00:35:03,976 --> 00:35:05,937
Pick it up, please.

470
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:09,107
MY DAUGHTER JU-KYUNG

471
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:19,784
Mom? Hey, take her to her room.

472
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:20,827
Let go.

473
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:21,828
You idiot.

474
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:23,412
What's in the sea near Ulleungdo?

475
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:25,206
A treasure ship? You bought that?

476
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:28,209
It's not entirely unbelievable.

477
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:30,044
Historically, in 1800…

478
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:31,963
In 1905, during the Russo-Japanese War--

479
00:35:32,046 --> 00:35:34,132
Forget about the Russo-Japanese War.

480
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:36,425
You and I are going to have a war!

481
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:38,594
-Stop her! No!
-Wait! Mom, please!

482
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:40,388
Mom, please don't!

483
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:42,473
-Hey, hold her!
-Let go of me.

484
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:45,726
It's a historical fact
that the cruiser Donskoi sank.

485
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:48,062
My life is on the brink of sinking
because of you!

486
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:51,566
Is half a billion won a petty sum to you,
you rotten bastard?

487
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:54,193
Why did you invest
that kind of money there?

488
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:57,488
How are you still living in a fantasy
at the age of 50?

489
00:35:57,572 --> 00:36:00,700
Dad, tell her you are sorry! Come on!

490
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:03,911
-Come on!
-I'm really sorry.

491
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:07,331
Hyun-sook, I'm sorry.
Please forgive me just for once.

492
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:09,000
Forget it.

493
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:11,377
I'll kill you tonight

494
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:12,712
and gladly go to prison!

495
00:36:12,795 --> 00:36:13,921
No!

496
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,506
Mom, hold on!

497
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:16,674
-No!
-Don't!

498
00:36:16,757 --> 00:36:18,926
-Wait. I'm sorry!
-Mom!

499
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,094
Hang on.

500
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:21,179
-Freeze.
-Mom!

501
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:22,680
-Stop.
-Hang on.

502
00:36:22,763 --> 00:36:24,724
Come here. You're holding out on me?

503
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:26,601
-Calm down.
-How dare you.

504
00:36:28,811 --> 00:36:29,687
Look at that.

505
00:36:31,772 --> 00:36:32,690
Seriously?

506
00:38:03,572 --> 00:38:05,157
The dead…

507
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:09,495
wouldn't have wanted the people
they left behind to suffer for too long.

508
00:38:10,162 --> 00:38:12,665
So please be happy.

509
00:38:38,774 --> 00:38:40,026
Stop crying.

510
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:42,028
Mom!

511
00:38:42,111 --> 00:38:44,739
I'm going to off myself…

512
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:49,827
Mom.

513
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:53,122
Why would you say that?

514
00:38:53,205 --> 00:38:54,165
Hey, you're home.

515
00:38:57,585 --> 00:39:00,963
How can I possibly leave you guys behind?

516
00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:07,053
Let's just die together.

517
00:39:07,136 --> 00:39:07,970
All of us.

518
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:10,389
-I won't say such things again.
-Together.

519
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:11,557
Please don't cry.

520
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,934
How could I not cry in this situation?

521
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:17,938
Gosh, what's up with my life?

522
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:22,026
Why didn't you make me pretty then?

523
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:25,029
Hee-kyung and Ju-young take after Dad.

524
00:39:25,112 --> 00:39:27,239
That's why I did it!

525
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:31,035
-What?
-Am I wrong?

526
00:39:31,118 --> 00:39:34,955
I'm the only one who's ugly
because I take after you!

527
00:39:35,581 --> 00:39:36,707
What did you just say?

528
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:39,377
Hey, read the room.

529
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:40,711
Lim Ju-bal, shut it.

530
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:43,506
I won't kill myself,
so let me get plastic surgery.

531
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:45,383
-Then everything will be okay.
-What?

532
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:48,719
What's this nonsense?
I could kick you out too!

533
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:51,847
You must also prefer a pretty daughter
to an ugly one!

534
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:54,225
Don't add to my troubles. Leave.

535
00:39:54,308 --> 00:39:55,476
I said, leave!

536
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:57,353
-Let me get surgery.
-Let's go.

537
00:39:57,436 --> 00:40:00,856
I want surgery.
I'm the only one who looks like you!

538
00:40:01,982 --> 00:40:03,859
-I want plastic surgery.
-Come on.

539
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:17,665
HYE-MIN

540
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:31,387
CHAT

541
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:33,389
ARE YOU UP, HYE-MIN?
TODAY'S THE DAY!

542
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:37,059
JUST THE THOUGHT OF IT MAKES ME NERVOUS…

543
00:40:37,643 --> 00:40:40,438
I must have been the only one
who thought we were friends.

544
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:45,860
I really have no one starting tomorrow.

545
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:48,946
I want to drop out.

546
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:52,658
Hey, Ju-kyung.

547
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:57,371
-Are you asleep?
-I'm about to.

548
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:00,833
I'm taking Mom out for a drink,
so you sleep, okay?

549
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:11,802
Why did I leave that voicemail?

550
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:13,262
I just broke Mom's heart.

551
00:41:21,937 --> 00:41:22,771
After…

552
00:41:24,064 --> 00:41:25,483
we bought this apartment,

553
00:41:26,233 --> 00:41:28,611
I couldn't sleep for days
because I was so happy.

554
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:31,697
-You're selling it?
-What else can I do?

555
00:41:32,531 --> 00:41:34,325
Selling our old place won't pay much

556
00:41:34,408 --> 00:41:36,035
seeing how nobody wants to rent it.

557
00:41:36,702 --> 00:41:38,579
We'll sell it, settle the debt,

558
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:41,165
-and move back to our old place.
-Don't.

559
00:41:42,082 --> 00:41:45,252
I'll get my severance pay early,
take out some loans, and we'll be--

560
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:46,420
Nonsense.

561
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:48,547
He's my husband, so I'll settle it myself.

562
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:50,049
It's not your problem.

563
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:53,177
Let Dad come back home.

564
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:55,346
Kicking him out in his underwear
in this cold is too harsh.

565
00:41:55,429 --> 00:41:56,263
Whatever.

566
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:58,015
I don't care if he freezes to death.

567
00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:00,142
BEAUTY SALON

568
00:42:07,107 --> 00:42:08,817
Honey, I'm so sorry.

569
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:10,819
Please stop.

570
00:42:20,829 --> 00:42:22,414
I'M GOING TO TELL MY CRUSH
HOW I FEEL TODAY…

571
00:42:23,749 --> 00:42:25,834
-I admire your courage.
-I hope he likes you back!

572
00:42:25,918 --> 00:42:26,752
Let us know how it goes.

573
00:42:26,835 --> 00:42:28,587
Did you do it?
Do you have a boyfriend now?

574
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:30,256
Answer us! Where's your follow-up?

575
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:34,426
Guys, I actually got rejected.

576
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:40,349
No one likes me because I'm ugly.

577
00:42:40,432 --> 00:42:41,267
Oh, no.

578
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:42,184
Focus on studying.

579
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:44,228
A full-body makeover?
Plastic surgeons can reinvent you.

580
00:42:44,311 --> 00:42:47,565
My grades aren't good,
and my mom said no to plastic surgery.

581
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:51,527
Are you good at makeup?

582
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:53,487
You could totally make up for your looks.

583
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:54,488
Check out this link.

584
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:56,282
HOPE YOU ALL GET PRETTIER
AFTER WATCHING THE VIDEO

585
00:42:58,367 --> 00:43:00,035
MIRACULOUS MAKEUP, BEFORE AND AFTER

586
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:01,120
TARGET YOUR CRUSH'S HEART

587
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:08,752
This is unbelievable.

588
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:11,380
This is it.

589
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:17,553
What?

590
00:43:20,222 --> 00:43:21,599
-What?
-What the…

591
00:43:22,182 --> 00:43:23,934
-Why are they staring?
-What?

592
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:25,019
Because of the video?

593
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:25,936
My goodness.

594
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:27,396
Or…

595
00:43:27,479 --> 00:43:28,856
Do I look prettier now?

596
00:43:45,581 --> 00:43:48,334
This is insane! Hurry, take her picture.

597
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:49,793
Hey.

598
00:43:49,877 --> 00:43:52,254
Did you use a marker as an eyeliner?

599
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:53,881
-This is unbelievable.
-It's crazy.

600
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:56,675
-Take a picture.
-I'm going to keep this.

601
00:43:56,759 --> 00:43:58,927
-You look so pretty.
-This is gold.

602
00:43:59,011 --> 00:44:01,722
-It's unbelievable.
-Hey, smile.

603
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:04,350
-They let you leave the house like this?
-She's a beauty.

604
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:05,893
-Smile!
-You look so pretty.

605
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:09,229
-What's with your eyeliner?
-Smile for us.

606
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:10,522
-Hey, smile!
-Smile.

607
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:11,940
-I'm crying.
-It's ridiculous.

608
00:44:12,024 --> 00:44:13,484
-I'm crying too.
-Look here!

609
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:17,613
Yes, I need to sell it fast.

610
00:44:17,696 --> 00:44:19,448
We need the money quickly.

611
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:22,451
As soon as possible, please.

612
00:44:22,534 --> 00:44:23,369
Thank you.

613
00:44:34,963 --> 00:44:36,298
Mom.

614
00:44:41,136 --> 00:44:44,932
What in the world
have you done to your face?

615
00:44:45,724 --> 00:44:47,643
You almost gave me a heart attack.

616
00:44:47,726 --> 00:44:49,478
I just put some makeup on.

617
00:44:49,561 --> 00:44:50,646
Is it that bad?

618
00:44:50,729 --> 00:44:52,272
This isn't makeup.

619
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:53,690
It's costume makeup!

620
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:56,276
Did you just get back
from filming a horror movie?

621
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:57,778
Wash it off immediately!

622
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,280
I'm too embarrassed to go back to school.

623
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:02,241
Mom, I want to transfer schools.

624
00:45:02,324 --> 00:45:03,659
Will you please let me?

625
00:45:03,742 --> 00:45:06,328
Goodness, you don't have to beg for it.

626
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:11,291
We're moving back to our old place,
so you have to transfer.

627
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:13,836
Really? You mean that, right?

628
00:45:13,919 --> 00:45:15,838
Yes!

629
00:45:16,422 --> 00:45:18,882
You really can't read the room, can you?

630
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:21,218
Read what? I feel like dancing!

631
00:45:21,301 --> 00:45:24,138
I'm transferring schools!

632
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:27,015
Are you mocking me right now?

633
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:28,183
I'm home.

634
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:29,643
You're back.

635
00:45:34,314 --> 00:45:35,899
I almost peed myself.

636
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:40,237
-Lim Ju-young, I'll kill you.
-Why would you kill my precious son?

637
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:41,321
Why?

638
00:45:49,037 --> 00:45:50,497
A horror movie?

639
00:45:52,708 --> 00:45:54,334
If I go to school like this…

640
00:46:06,555 --> 00:46:08,390
Is my makeup really that weird?

641
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:09,308
TEEN GODDESS FORUM

642
00:46:09,391 --> 00:46:11,810
I want to stop being an outcast
before transferring.

643
00:46:11,894 --> 00:46:12,728
Help me out.

644
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:15,314
-This is awful.
-Are you a ghost?

645
00:46:15,397 --> 00:46:17,232
Do something about your caterpillar brows.

646
00:46:17,316 --> 00:46:18,525
"Caterpillar"?

647
00:46:22,863 --> 00:46:24,615
They do look like caterpillars.

648
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:27,784
Check out the third most popular post.
It'll help!

649
00:46:27,868 --> 00:46:29,369
"Most popular post"?

650
00:46:30,913 --> 00:46:33,874
Hi, pretty ladies! Here's how to make
your eyes look twice as big.

651
00:46:35,501 --> 00:46:36,627
On one, two, three!

652
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:43,175
What the…

653
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:44,760
That's incredible.

654
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:49,264
Yes,

655
00:46:50,265 --> 00:46:51,475
this is it.

656
00:46:59,608 --> 00:47:03,946
The incident was a huge deal,
almost costing my parents their marriage,

657
00:47:04,738 --> 00:47:08,534
but it was a chance for me
to live a new life.

658
00:47:38,063 --> 00:47:38,897
Welcome.

659
00:48:41,335 --> 00:48:43,962
What perfects your look is the lips.

660
00:48:44,046 --> 00:48:46,465
I'll use this lip tint.

661
00:48:46,548 --> 00:48:47,716
How do I look?

662
00:48:47,799 --> 00:48:49,009
Hey Seluvies,

663
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:51,428
I hope you managed to
reinvent yourselves today.

664
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:53,472
Reinvent myself?

665
00:48:54,556 --> 00:48:58,143
Please follow Selena all the way.

666
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:34,388
Oh, no.

667
00:49:35,597 --> 00:49:36,848
No.

668
00:49:36,932 --> 00:49:37,891
It's okay.

669
00:49:38,975 --> 00:49:40,644
I have to draw them on anyway.

670
00:49:40,727 --> 00:49:41,812
It's okay.

671
00:49:41,895 --> 00:49:42,854
Calm down.

672
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:47,192
Aren't you going to pack?

673
00:49:47,275 --> 00:49:49,319
What is she up to lately?

674
00:49:50,862 --> 00:49:51,947
Focus.

675
00:50:30,068 --> 00:50:31,361
Unbelievable.

676
00:50:36,283 --> 00:50:37,117
GARDEN OF BLOOD 3

677
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:44,249
You Are the Devil.

678
00:50:46,793 --> 00:50:48,587
-You Are the Devil.
-What?

679
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:50,589
-Do you have the latest volume?
-Yes.

680
00:50:51,131 --> 00:50:53,175
I put it in the horror section earlier.

681
00:50:54,092 --> 00:50:55,761
I haven't seen you in a while.

682
00:50:56,678 --> 00:50:58,930
He's always been the same
for the past ten years.

683
00:51:05,562 --> 00:51:06,396
The book…

684
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:09,191
The first page is ripped.

685
00:51:09,274 --> 00:51:10,192
Sorry?

686
00:51:16,198 --> 00:51:18,533
-The kids who borrowed it must've done it.
-But why?

687
00:51:21,369 --> 00:51:23,455
That's outrageous.

688
00:51:26,082 --> 00:51:29,252
Can't you just skip the first page?

689
00:51:29,336 --> 00:51:32,214
You can still understand the story
even if you skip a page.

690
00:51:32,297 --> 00:51:33,799
When singing the national anthem,

691
00:51:33,882 --> 00:51:36,468
do you skip the first verse
and start from the second?

692
00:51:37,302 --> 00:51:38,595
When you watch soccer games,

693
00:51:38,678 --> 00:51:40,972
do you skip the first half
and start at the second?

694
00:51:41,056 --> 00:51:43,433
You probably skip January
and start the year in February

695
00:51:43,517 --> 00:51:45,393
with that kind of logic.

696
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:46,728
I see your point.

697
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:48,104
I'll put in a new order

698
00:51:48,188 --> 00:51:50,899
and let you know immediately,
so if you come by tomorrow…

699
00:51:53,568 --> 00:51:54,861
He never changes.

700
00:52:00,492 --> 00:52:01,409
Ju-kyung.

701
00:52:02,118 --> 00:52:03,912
Wake up. We're almost there.

702
00:52:03,995 --> 00:52:05,413
All right.

703
00:52:05,497 --> 00:52:06,748
PRINCE COMICS

704
00:52:16,842 --> 00:52:17,884
Okay.

705
00:52:39,155 --> 00:52:40,156
Oh, no.

706
00:52:53,378 --> 00:52:54,546
Sorry about that.

707
00:53:11,938 --> 00:53:14,232
Chocolate brown colored lenses, check.

708
00:53:17,527 --> 00:53:21,364
Create some depth to the lids
with light brown eyeshadow,

709
00:53:21,448 --> 00:53:23,867
and finish by dabbing eyeshadow
to the under-eye area

710
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:26,453
to give the illusion of bigger eyes.

711
00:53:27,913 --> 00:53:30,332
LIM JU-KYUNG

712
00:53:31,499 --> 00:53:34,336
"Good first impression makeup" finished.

713
00:53:40,091 --> 00:53:43,094
I went through so much
to get away from this place.

714
00:53:43,178 --> 00:53:45,889
I thought I had made one step forward,
but now I'm back.

715
00:53:45,972 --> 00:53:47,891
Those eight years went down the drain.

716
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:51,645
-You've become eight years younger.
-What?

717
00:53:51,728 --> 00:53:54,189
Yes, honey. It's so nice to be back here.

718
00:53:54,272 --> 00:53:56,524
It's romantic and makes me think
of our honeymoon.

719
00:53:56,608 --> 00:53:58,360
Romantic, my foot.

720
00:53:58,443 --> 00:54:00,070
Ju-kyung, come down and eat…

721
00:54:09,329 --> 00:54:11,039
No thanks. I don't feel like eating.

722
00:54:11,122 --> 00:54:12,499
Even if you don't, you…

723
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:14,542
Who are you?

724
00:54:15,126 --> 00:54:16,211
What?

725
00:54:16,294 --> 00:54:17,837
I'm off to school!

726
00:54:22,634 --> 00:54:24,177
Hey, look. Who is that?

727
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:25,845
-She's really pretty.
-Who is she?

728
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:27,931
-I've never seen her.
-She's so pretty.

729
00:54:28,014 --> 00:54:29,391
She's so beautiful.

730
00:54:29,474 --> 00:54:32,310
-She's so pretty.
-She looks like a goddess.

731
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:33,979
She's stunning.

732
00:54:34,062 --> 00:54:36,231
-She's so pretty.
-I wish I was that pretty.

733
00:54:36,314 --> 00:54:37,440
She's gorgeous.

734
00:54:37,524 --> 00:54:39,192
-Amazing.
-She's stunning.

735
00:54:39,275 --> 00:54:41,152
-She's so pretty.
-My goodness.

736
00:54:41,736 --> 00:54:44,489
SAEBOM HIGH SCHOOL
LIM JU-KYUNG

737
00:54:47,242 --> 00:54:48,368
She's so pretty!

738
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:49,327
Unbelievable.

739
00:54:49,411 --> 00:54:50,662
She's a true beauty.

740
00:54:58,670 --> 00:54:59,713
Did he just…

741
00:55:01,548 --> 00:55:02,882
call me a true beauty?

742
00:55:10,098 --> 00:55:12,017
-I'm jealous.
-She's so pretty.

743
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:13,977
-I wish I looked like that.
-Unbelievable.

744
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:16,229
-I'm jealous.
-She's so pretty.

745
00:55:16,312 --> 00:55:18,356
-She's so pretty.
-Yes, she is.

746
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:19,983
She's so pretty.

747
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:22,902
Where's the teachers' office?

748
00:55:29,325 --> 00:55:30,285
What the…

749
00:55:39,335 --> 00:55:40,545
She's beautiful.

750
00:55:42,922 --> 00:55:44,507
STOP ACTING LADYLIKE

751
00:55:44,591 --> 00:55:46,509
STOP ACTING LIKE A MODEL STUDENT

752
00:55:46,593 --> 00:55:48,053
WHAT?
WATCH IT!

753
00:55:48,136 --> 00:55:51,681
You haven't moved that far,
but it still feels rather strange, right?

754
00:55:51,765 --> 00:55:54,350
It's okay. I used to live here
until I was ten years old.

755
00:55:54,434 --> 00:55:55,435
That's good to hear.

756
00:55:56,561 --> 00:55:57,395
Here you go.

757
00:55:58,104 --> 00:56:00,190
You are now a student at Saebom High.

758
00:56:00,732 --> 00:56:01,566
Thank you.

759

STUDENT ID CARD
SAEBOM HIGH SCHOOL

760
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:07,489
My goodness!

761
00:56:07,572 --> 00:56:10,909
I hear the new transfer student
was top of the class at their last school.

762
00:56:12,118 --> 00:56:13,870
That must be you, right?

763
00:56:14,454 --> 00:56:15,914
Let me see her files.

764
00:56:17,165 --> 00:56:20,085
Would you look at her?
She looks like a model student.

765
00:56:20,168 --> 00:56:22,462
REPORT CARD

766
00:56:23,379 --> 00:56:24,464
I was wrong.

767
00:56:24,547 --> 00:56:25,632
My goodness!

768
00:56:25,715 --> 00:56:28,176
You must be the top student!

769
00:56:28,259 --> 00:56:29,302
Take a good look.

770
00:56:29,385 --> 00:56:31,805
You can tell he's smart
just by looking at him.

771
00:56:32,972 --> 00:56:34,557
Please excuse us.

772
00:56:34,641 --> 00:56:36,935
Of course, go ahead.
Introduce him to the class.

773
00:56:37,018 --> 00:56:40,396
That's the vice principal.
Don't mind what he said.

774
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:42,565
There's more to life than your grades.

775
00:56:42,649 --> 00:56:43,775
Okay.

776
00:56:43,858 --> 00:56:44,776
My goodness!

777
00:56:44,859 --> 00:56:47,445
Here comes our top student
in the junior class!

778
00:56:47,529 --> 00:56:49,364
No wonder the room suddenly lit up!

779
00:56:49,447 --> 00:56:50,782
He's really handsome.

780
00:56:53,159 --> 00:56:55,245
Look at him.
Even his greeting is charming.

781
00:56:55,328 --> 00:56:56,246
Just a nod.

782
00:56:57,497 --> 00:56:59,415
-Here you go, sir.
-Thank you.

783
00:56:59,499 --> 00:57:01,668
I feel like I've heard that voice before.

784
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:03,086
Ask the class president next time.

785
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:04,754
Okay.

786
00:57:04,838 --> 00:57:08,007
I've never seen
such a handsome face in my life.

787
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:08,925
Hey, Soo-ho.

788
00:57:10,051 --> 00:57:14,514
She's a new student in our class.
Can you walk her to our classroom?

789
00:57:14,597 --> 00:57:16,599
Must I do that?

790
00:57:17,684 --> 00:57:18,518
Yes,

791
00:57:19,144 --> 00:57:20,854
you must.

792
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:26,734
-Go after him.
-Okay.

793
00:57:27,402 --> 00:57:28,862
Wait up.

794
00:57:29,529 --> 00:57:30,655
He's so handsome.

795
00:57:30,738 --> 00:57:33,199
On top of that perfect body,
he's the top of the class?

796
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:35,285
God is really unfair.

797
00:57:35,368 --> 00:57:36,828
Hey, Soo-ho.

798
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:42,834
Damn it.

799
00:57:42,917 --> 00:57:44,544
It's supposed to be transfer-proof.

800
00:57:44,627 --> 00:57:45,628
Do we know each other?

801
00:57:46,963 --> 00:57:47,881
Why did you say my name?

802
00:57:47,964 --> 00:57:48,840
Soo-ho, I mean…

803
00:57:48,923 --> 00:57:50,133
Do you have a moment?

804
00:57:50,216 --> 00:57:52,677
-I don't have a moment.
-It won't take long.

805
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:54,095
I have something to tell you.

806
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:57,056
-You have three seconds.
-What?

807
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:58,475
-One,
-Soo-ho, I mean…

808
00:57:58,558 --> 00:58:00,310
-two, three.
-I've had a crush on you since…

809
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:03,396
-My answer is, "No."
-Please at least take this.

810
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:08,193
LEE SOO-HO

811
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:18,286
Hey, wait.

812
00:58:18,369 --> 00:58:19,454
What do I do?

813
00:58:20,788 --> 00:58:22,081
Hold on.

814
00:58:22,165 --> 00:58:23,708
Is my makeup still intact?

815
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:27,045
One, two.

816
00:58:30,632 --> 00:58:32,383
-Hi!
-Soo-ho, you're here!

817
00:58:34,594 --> 00:58:35,887
Hey, hold on.

818
00:58:36,804 --> 00:58:39,224
What's that on your back?
Is that on trend?

819
00:58:39,307 --> 00:58:41,059
It's very cool.

820
00:58:41,726 --> 00:58:44,270
-What is that on his back?
-Isn't it makeup?

821
00:58:51,569 --> 00:58:53,863
Thankfully, my eyes didn't get smudged.

822
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:04,457
Hey!

823
00:59:05,458 --> 00:59:07,168
What's wrong with him?

824
00:59:11,631 --> 00:59:13,508
I just bought this.

825
00:59:15,718 --> 00:59:18,930
This is your new classmate, Lim Ju-kyung.

826
00:59:19,013 --> 00:59:20,598
Do you want to say hi?

827
00:59:21,266 --> 00:59:23,142
Hi, nice to meet you all.

828
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:24,561
-You're so pretty!
-Hi.

829
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:30,149
-You're so pretty!
-Being pretty changed things.

830
00:59:30,984 --> 00:59:32,777
The way people look at me changed.

831
00:59:33,361 --> 00:59:34,779
You're so pretty!

832
00:59:34,862 --> 00:59:35,947
You're pretty!

833
00:59:36,030 --> 00:59:37,615
Except for one person.

834
00:59:38,324 --> 00:59:40,493
The average attractiveness
of our class has gone up now!

835
00:59:41,911 --> 00:59:43,246
-Ahn Hyun-kyu.
-It's gone up.

836
00:59:43,329 --> 00:59:44,539
Don't say such things.

837
00:59:44,622 --> 00:59:47,208
You guys are all beautiful in my eyes.

838
00:59:48,001 --> 00:59:49,419
"Beautiful from far away,

839
00:59:49,502 --> 00:59:50,920
but even more so up close."

840
00:59:51,004 --> 00:59:52,672
That's so lame!

841
00:59:52,755 --> 00:59:55,133
You have no idea how beautiful you are.

842
00:59:55,758 --> 00:59:59,846
Just being 18 years old in itself
is a beautiful and thrilling thing.

843
00:59:59,929 --> 01:00:02,807
So don't try to be something you're not.
Especially you, Su-ah.

844
01:00:02,890 --> 01:00:03,891
Sure.

845
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:07,020
Why are you so serious all the time?

846
01:00:10,023 --> 01:00:11,065
Ju-kyung…

847
01:00:11,149 --> 01:00:13,151
Right. Take the empty seat next to Soo-ho.

848
01:00:15,653 --> 01:00:17,530
I have bad eyesight.

849
01:00:18,031 --> 01:00:19,407
Is that so?

850
01:00:19,490 --> 01:00:21,367
That seat belongs to a student
who's on leave,

851
01:00:21,451 --> 01:00:22,785
but how about behind Su-ah?

852
01:00:23,578 --> 01:00:24,662
Okay.

853
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:30,835
Okay, what's your first class?
Mine, right?

854
01:00:30,918 --> 01:00:32,086
Open your textbooks.

855
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:33,296
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

856
01:00:35,798 --> 01:00:39,761
You do recall the Blue Deer School poets
from the last class, right?

857
01:00:39,844 --> 01:00:40,887
-No.
-No.

858
01:00:40,970 --> 01:00:42,722
Of course, you wouldn't recall.

859
01:00:42,805 --> 01:00:44,474
-Okay, the Blue Deer School.
-Okay.

860
01:00:44,557 --> 01:00:48,102
With nature as their subject matter,
they pursued human aspirations and values…

861
01:00:48,186 --> 01:00:50,229
-Here.
-Thank you.

862
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:51,898
Pak Tu-jin, Pak Mok-wol, and Cho Chi-hun.

863
01:00:51,981 --> 01:00:53,900
These three poets formed a club

864
01:00:53,983 --> 01:00:57,153
and published a book together
called The Blue Deer Anthology.

865
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:01,032
Good work, class.

866
01:01:01,115 --> 01:01:02,784
Make sure to do your homework
by next time.

867
01:01:02,867 --> 01:01:04,410
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

868
01:01:04,994 --> 01:01:06,454
It feels so awkward.

869
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:09,499
I saw you at the gate this morning.

870
01:01:09,582 --> 01:01:10,458
You did?

871
01:01:11,125 --> 01:01:12,669
Hi, new face!

872
01:01:13,294 --> 01:01:14,212
Hi.

873
01:01:14,295 --> 01:01:16,130
What's your number? Type it in for me.

874
01:01:16,756 --> 01:01:17,590
Sure.

875
01:01:18,424 --> 01:01:20,259
What's your Newstagram handle?

876
01:01:20,843 --> 01:01:22,261
I don't have an account.

877
01:01:22,345 --> 01:01:25,014
What? Why not?
Are you trying to be mysterious?

878
01:01:25,098 --> 01:01:28,017
-You'd get so many Newstagram followers.
-That's right.

879
01:01:29,268 --> 01:01:31,938
I love your lip color.
Which lip tint do you use?

880
01:01:32,730 --> 01:01:33,773
Really?

881
01:01:34,273 --> 01:01:35,650
I use…

882
01:01:44,283 --> 01:01:46,703
She's stunning.

883
01:01:46,786 --> 01:01:48,746
She doesn't even seem
to have any makeup on.

884
01:01:49,372 --> 01:01:50,206
Here.

885
01:01:51,916 --> 01:01:53,000
Thank you.

886
01:01:54,127 --> 01:01:55,712
-Kangsu, you're here.
-Yes.

887
01:01:55,795 --> 01:01:57,213
This is Kang Su-jin, my best friend.

888
01:01:57,296 --> 01:02:00,675
I think she's the goddess of our school,
but now that you're here, maybe not.

889
01:02:01,175 --> 01:02:02,051
Watch out, Kangsu.

890
01:02:02,135 --> 01:02:03,720
Enough with the butt-slapping.

891
01:02:04,679 --> 01:02:07,056
Ju-kyung, was it? Nice to meet you.

892
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:08,266
Nice to meet you too.

893
01:02:08,349 --> 01:02:10,309
By the way, you're really pretty.

894
01:02:10,393 --> 01:02:12,103
Are you a trainee or something?

895
01:02:12,645 --> 01:02:13,980
She talks a lot, doesn't she?

896
01:02:14,063 --> 01:02:16,023
She's like that. Try to be understanding.

897
01:02:16,107 --> 01:02:17,650
No, it's okay.

898
01:02:19,652 --> 01:02:22,822
Granted, it was my fault.
But did he have to throw it to my face?

899
01:02:23,531 --> 01:02:25,825
I'll get it cleaned all right.

900
01:02:27,744 --> 01:02:28,578
What?

901
01:02:29,370 --> 01:02:30,580
But why…

902
01:02:31,164 --> 01:02:32,623
Why is it not coming out?

903
01:02:36,919 --> 01:02:39,422
It's waterproof. What do I do?

904
01:02:40,214 --> 01:02:42,216
This is bad.

905
01:02:47,472 --> 01:02:48,681
I'm sorry.

906
01:02:51,017 --> 01:02:53,936
Hey, I'll get this dry cleaned and--

907
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:56,063
-Throw it away.
-Sorry?

908
01:02:56,147 --> 01:02:57,774
Why would you throw it away?

909
01:02:57,857 --> 01:03:00,234
I'll get it cleaned and return it to you!

910
01:03:01,068 --> 01:03:02,028
Ju-kyung.

911
01:03:02,862 --> 01:03:04,071
What's up with Lee Soo-ho?

912
01:03:04,155 --> 01:03:07,950
I got something on his jacket,
and he wants me to throw it away.

913
01:03:09,368 --> 01:03:11,204
He's throwing a fit over nothing again.

914
01:03:11,287 --> 01:03:12,580
That's just how he is.

915
01:03:12,663 --> 01:03:14,582
He's good-looking, so he's a sociopath.

916
01:03:14,665 --> 01:03:16,250
Is that so?

917
01:03:16,876 --> 01:03:18,795
So he's got a rotten temper.

918
01:03:18,878 --> 01:03:21,672
-Ju-kyung, how about some dumplings--
-Sure, I'll go get them.

919
01:03:21,756 --> 01:03:22,882
That's not what I meant.

920
01:03:22,965 --> 01:03:25,510
I was suggesting
that we go get them together.

921
01:03:26,594 --> 01:03:28,387
-Together?
-Yes.

922
01:03:31,891 --> 01:03:34,310
You're not giving her space
to make new friends.

923
01:03:34,393 --> 01:03:37,271
What's the problem?
She's mine from now on.

924
01:03:37,355 --> 01:03:39,190
You really are outgoing.

925
01:03:39,273 --> 01:03:40,817
I have to hand it to you.

926
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:43,444
By the way, what are you into?

927
01:03:44,612 --> 01:03:47,240
I do like heavy metal and horror comics…

928
01:03:48,241 --> 01:03:50,618
-Reading and listening to music.
-What kind of music?

929
01:03:50,701 --> 01:03:52,078
I'm a huge fan of ATEEN.

930
01:03:52,161 --> 01:03:53,955
And I love spicy food.

931
01:03:54,038 --> 01:03:56,290
I love spicy food too.

932
01:03:56,374 --> 01:03:57,875
Really? That's great!

933
01:03:57,959 --> 01:04:00,753
Then do you want to get
some tteokbokki after school

934
01:04:00,837 --> 01:04:02,088
to celebrate our friendship?

935
01:04:04,173 --> 01:04:05,341
Sounds great,

936
01:04:06,133 --> 01:04:07,093
friend.

937
01:04:07,969 --> 01:04:12,473
-You in, Tu-jin?
-Yes. But I'm not Tu-jin, I'm Su-jin.

938
01:04:12,557 --> 01:04:13,391
Su-jin.

939
01:04:13,474 --> 01:04:16,811
Sure, Ms. Second-brightest-in-our-school.

940
01:04:17,395 --> 01:04:19,564
She's neck and neck in grades with Soo-ho.

941
01:04:19,647 --> 01:04:22,650
She got the looks and the brains.

942
01:04:22,733 --> 01:04:24,944
You're not like that, are you?

943
01:04:25,027 --> 01:04:26,112
I'm not smart.

944
01:04:26,863 --> 01:04:27,780
That's perfect.

945
01:04:27,864 --> 01:04:30,324
Just stick to your good looks, like me.

946
01:04:31,993 --> 01:04:33,953
But I'm not pretty.

947
01:04:34,036 --> 01:04:36,122
Su-ah, you need to study a little.

948
01:04:36,205 --> 01:04:37,748
-Why?
-I'll help you.

949
01:04:37,832 --> 01:04:38,916
-We'll do it together.
-No.

950
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,294
-Pretty girls still need to study.
-Whatever.

951
01:04:41,377 --> 01:04:42,420
Join us, Ju-kyung.

952
01:04:45,965 --> 01:04:48,134
-All right. You can dig in now.
-Okay.

953
01:04:48,217 --> 01:04:49,427
-Let's eat.
-Enjoy.

954
01:04:52,430 --> 01:04:54,098
-How is it?
-It's so good.

955
01:04:54,181 --> 01:04:55,433
-Right? I told you so.
-Yes.

956
01:04:55,516 --> 01:04:56,601
I'm going to eat too.

957
01:04:59,770 --> 01:05:00,771
But it's rather spicy.

958
01:05:02,815 --> 01:05:05,318
Come on, Su-jin. Just this once. Please?

959
01:05:05,401 --> 01:05:07,361
-No, I have a tutor coming over.
-Come on.

960
01:05:07,445 --> 01:05:09,405
Just for ten minutes.

961
01:05:09,488 --> 01:05:12,825
-I'll get scolded by my mom.
-Just five minutes then. Let's go.

962
01:05:12,909 --> 01:05:14,744
I can't even spare five minutes for you.

963
01:05:18,623 --> 01:05:20,458
Ju-kyung, let's try everything in here.

964
01:05:20,541 --> 01:05:21,709
Got it, Su-jin?

965
01:05:24,170 --> 01:05:26,088
A NEWBIE IN LIFE
A MASTER IN GAMES

966
01:05:27,506 --> 01:05:28,925
Did you see? I'm in first.

967
01:05:29,008 --> 01:05:30,217
How come I can't get any?

968
01:05:30,301 --> 01:05:31,385
Hey, it's the shark.

969
01:05:31,469 --> 01:05:32,511
I got it!

970
01:05:32,595 --> 01:05:33,763
You're almost there.

971
01:05:35,514 --> 01:05:36,891
Come on!

972
01:05:39,685 --> 01:05:42,104
You got it! Well done, Ju-kyung!

973
01:05:47,568 --> 01:05:48,402
Goodness.

974
01:05:49,820 --> 01:05:50,905
Try it, Ju-kyung.

975
01:05:50,988 --> 01:05:52,531
-Step right here.
-Here?

976
01:05:52,615 --> 01:05:53,783
-Like this.
-Like this?

977
01:05:53,866 --> 01:05:56,243
-Hit the left panel.
-The left?

978
01:05:57,203 --> 01:05:58,204
You're doing well.

979
01:06:03,292 --> 01:06:05,127
-Should we take one?
-Sure.

980
01:06:05,211 --> 01:06:06,212
You look really cute.

981
01:06:06,295 --> 01:06:07,380
Here we go.

982
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:10,132
-Move over.
-Please look here!

983
01:06:12,385 --> 01:06:14,929
-Is this your first time? Look here.
-I see.

984
01:06:15,012 --> 01:06:16,389
-Smile!
-Yes. Strike a pose.

985
01:06:31,445 --> 01:06:34,240
No matter how badly I wanted it
or how hard I tried,

986
01:06:34,323 --> 01:06:35,950
it had always eluded me.

987
01:06:38,035 --> 01:06:39,120
Having friends.

988
01:06:41,789 --> 01:06:44,667
I finally have friends of my own.

989
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:50,673
Come on.

990
01:07:03,102 --> 01:07:04,061
Get up.

991
01:07:30,588 --> 01:07:33,049
It's been a while for you.
Why push so hard?

992
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:35,342
Just because.

993
01:07:35,426 --> 01:07:36,719
To get better sleep.

994
01:07:36,802 --> 01:07:38,304
Are you having trouble sleeping again?

995
01:07:39,889 --> 01:07:41,223
Seems like it's gotten worse.

996
01:07:45,561 --> 01:07:46,729
Fine, then.

997
01:07:46,812 --> 01:07:48,647
I'll help you sleep like a baby tonight.

998
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:55,237
You need to try harder.

999
01:07:55,946 --> 01:07:56,989
Hey.

1000
01:07:57,073 --> 01:07:58,365
Come on, it hurts.

1001
01:08:16,258 --> 01:08:18,344
MY FRIEND SU-AH INVITED
MY FRIEND SU-JIN AND LIM JU-KYUNG

1002
01:08:18,427 --> 01:08:20,429
MY FRIEND SU-AH:
DID EVERYONE GET HOME SAFE?

1003
01:08:20,513 --> 01:08:22,973
Is this what they call…

1004
01:08:24,725 --> 01:08:26,185
a "group chat"?

1005
01:08:29,355 --> 01:08:31,398
I'm in a group chat now!

1006
01:08:31,482 --> 01:08:33,400
Did everyone get home safe?

1007
01:08:33,984 --> 01:08:36,195
Yes, what about Su-jin?

1008
01:08:36,278 --> 01:08:41,117
-Kangsu doesn't keep up with the messages.
-I see. By the way, I made a Newstagram.

1009
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:42,451
My handle is imzoo00_.

1010
01:08:42,535 --> 01:08:44,203
Awesome. Following you right now.

1011
01:08:44,286 --> 01:08:45,412
I'm with my tutor.

1012
01:08:45,496 --> 01:08:48,499
These are photos from today.
Just keep the ones you like.

1013
01:09:06,058 --> 01:09:07,184
What are you doing?

1014
01:09:07,768 --> 01:09:09,979
You are my sister, but I have to say this.

1015
01:09:10,062 --> 01:09:11,564
You're really ugly.

1016
01:09:12,064 --> 01:09:15,276
-What did you say?
-Everyone's calling you a goddess.

1017
01:09:15,901 --> 01:09:17,486
Maybe I should share this picture.

1018
01:09:18,070 --> 01:09:20,030
Lim Ju-young, delete that picture at once!

1019
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:22,908
Come here! Seriously.

1020
01:09:22,992 --> 01:09:25,077
-Take it if you can.
-Delete it.

1021
01:09:25,161 --> 01:09:27,913
Delete it. I mean it.

1022
01:09:29,123 --> 01:09:30,457
-You punk.
-"You punk."

1023
01:09:30,541 --> 01:09:31,792
-I'll get you.
-"I'll get you."

1024
01:09:31,876 --> 01:09:34,170
What's the matter? It's the real you.

1025
01:09:36,297 --> 01:09:37,840
Do you want this?

1026
01:09:37,923 --> 01:09:39,508
Too slow. Right? Left?

1027
01:09:40,801 --> 01:09:41,969
Let go.

1028
01:09:42,052 --> 01:09:43,345
You're so busted.

1029
01:09:45,848 --> 01:09:47,349
Hey, young lady.

1030
01:09:48,684 --> 01:09:49,852
Where are your manners?

1031
01:10:17,254 --> 01:10:18,339
This is chilling.

1032
01:10:19,757 --> 01:10:22,384
As if a dagger is poised
to pierce my heart.

1033
01:10:23,302 --> 01:10:25,429
But there's no need to worry.

1034
01:10:25,512 --> 01:10:27,556
The hands are faster than the eyes.

1035
01:10:29,308 --> 01:10:32,102
-Come here!
-It hurts! Let go!

1036
01:10:33,687 --> 01:10:35,397
ENTER YOUR PASSCODE

1037
01:10:35,981 --> 01:10:37,775
Do you think I'm stupid?

1038
01:10:45,241 --> 01:10:46,325
What is it you want?

1039
01:10:46,909 --> 01:10:48,327
The latest volume of You Are the Devil.

1040
01:10:48,994 --> 01:10:50,371
Then will you delete it?

1041
01:10:51,163 --> 01:10:52,039
We'll see.

1042
01:10:52,873 --> 01:10:54,541
I could break your wrist off.

1043
01:10:54,625 --> 01:10:56,835
Which one should I upload
to the anonymous forum?

1044
01:10:57,836 --> 01:10:59,004
Don't!

1045
01:11:07,596 --> 01:11:09,932
I'll double your deal.

1046
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:16,438
How about the new volume and cup noodles?

1047
01:11:18,607 --> 01:11:19,441
Deal.

1048
01:11:42,798 --> 01:11:44,091
What a relief.

1049
01:11:57,980 --> 01:12:00,065
I followed you.
You've uploaded some pictures.

1050
01:12:00,149 --> 01:12:02,735
Gosh, you have tons of likes
when you've just started.

1051
01:12:02,818 --> 01:12:04,153
Really?

1052
01:12:04,862 --> 01:12:06,697
-Can we be friends?
-You're a goddess.

1053
01:12:06,780 --> 01:12:08,741
-Please follow me back.
-Surreal. So pretty.

1054
01:12:08,824 --> 01:12:09,825
I have over 100 likes?

1055
01:12:09,908 --> 01:12:11,577
-You're a goddess.
-You're so pretty.

1056
01:12:12,995 --> 01:12:14,204
"Goddess"?

1057
01:12:15,956 --> 01:12:17,041
There's no way.

1058
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:23,589
I could run into people from school.

1059
01:12:29,595 --> 01:12:31,221
PRINCE COMICS

1060
01:12:34,391 --> 01:12:35,851
This place hasn't changed a bit.

1061
01:12:37,144 --> 01:12:39,188
I wonder if the owner is the same.

1062
01:12:47,363 --> 01:12:49,198
It still has the same vibe.

1063
01:12:50,324 --> 01:12:51,450
Welcome.

1064
01:12:52,117 --> 01:12:54,495
Hello, sir. You're still here!

1065
01:12:55,579 --> 01:12:58,665
-Who are…
-Don't you remember me?

1066
01:12:59,291 --> 01:13:00,751
Lim Ju-bal?

1067
01:13:00,834 --> 01:13:01,710
Yes, sir.

1068
01:13:02,544 --> 01:13:06,465
You're back.
I heard Ms. Hong was moving back.

1069
01:13:06,548 --> 01:13:07,966
How long has it been?

1070
01:13:08,550 --> 01:13:09,593
About eight years?

1071
01:13:09,676 --> 01:13:11,303
Gosh, has it been that long?

1072
01:13:11,387 --> 01:13:15,265
That little kid has grown up
and you're still…

1073
01:13:15,349 --> 01:13:16,475
Ugly Ju-bal?

1074
01:13:17,059 --> 01:13:18,477
No, you're as cute as ever.

1075
01:13:27,820 --> 01:13:29,405
That's a good one.

1076
01:13:32,908 --> 01:13:34,076
I love the smell of the comics.

1077
01:13:35,953 --> 01:13:36,787
What?

1078
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:39,873
My scribbles are still here.

1079
01:13:40,666 --> 01:13:44,920
RESERVED FOR LIM JU-KYUNG
SIT HERE AND YOU'LL GROW BUTT HAIR

1080
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:50,884
This is it.

1081
01:13:51,552 --> 01:13:53,679
There's no other place
with this many horror comics.

1082
01:13:58,016 --> 01:14:00,352
Where is it?

1083
01:14:03,564 --> 01:14:04,398
Found it.

1084
01:14:05,816 --> 01:14:06,984
YOU ARE THE DEVIL

1085
01:14:19,872 --> 01:14:21,123
I got here first.

1086
01:14:21,206 --> 01:14:22,499
I picked it out first.

1087
01:14:52,905 --> 01:14:53,822
Lee Soo-ho?

1088
01:14:56,366 --> 01:14:57,451
You're…

1089
01:14:58,452 --> 01:14:59,661
I'm busted.

1090
01:15:14,343 --> 01:15:16,094
THANK YOU TO LEE TAE-RI
FOR HIS SPECIAL APPEARANCE

1091
01:15:16,178 --> 01:15:17,971
AND TO CREATORS YEONDUKONG
AND DAMS BEAUTY FOR THEIR HELP

1092
01:15:42,871 --> 01:15:45,499
I'll make sure he'd never even
dream of my being Lim Ju-kyung.

1093
01:15:48,418 --> 01:15:49,628
What if he knows?

1094
01:15:50,128 --> 01:15:51,296
Do you feel guilty or something?

1095
01:15:51,380 --> 01:15:54,007
He'll take pity on me
and not spread the word.

1096
01:15:54,925 --> 01:15:56,760
Hey. You've seen me before, right?

1097
01:15:56,843 --> 01:15:58,971
What kind of absurd coincidence is this?

1098
01:15:59,054 --> 01:16:00,639
Are you seeing Soo-ho?

1099
01:16:01,390 --> 01:16:02,391
Right now?

1100
01:16:02,474 --> 01:16:04,643
You have something for me. Bring it over.

1101
01:16:04,726 --> 01:16:06,645
Lim Ju-kyung without makeup
or with makeup?

1102
01:16:06,728 --> 01:16:09,856
What on earth does he want me to bring?

1103
01:16:09,940 --> 01:16:14,278
