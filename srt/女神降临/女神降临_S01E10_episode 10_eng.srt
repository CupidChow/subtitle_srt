 Episode 10 

5
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:54,990
Do you want to watch a movie while we eat?

6
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:01,660
- It smells good. 
- What should we watch?

7
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:04,660
I can't say. Do you want to watch a horror movie?

8
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:06,150
How about something else?

9
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:08,800
Why? Can you not watch scary things?

10
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:12,040
Since it rained earlier, there are a lot of good movies like music movies.

11
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:15,640
Heol! You are a total fan of horror comic books, yet you can't watch horror movies?

12
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:19,620
We already read comic books everyday, so we don't have to watch horror movies too.

13
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:22,310
It's okay, it's okay. If it gets scary, I'll cover your eyes.

14
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:23,800
I'm not that bad.

15
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,930
Turn off the lights. You have to watch horror movies in the dark.

16
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:27,270
How about something else that's more fun?

17
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:29,380
 - He's on a date with his girlfriend.
  - I'll choose.

18
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,970
 I'm such a nuisance. 

19
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:39,200
- Here you go. 
 - Okay.

20
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:17,010
 Our Su Ho is a man. 

21
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:26,390
You really haven't watched horror movies, huh?

22
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:29,230
Ghosts don't come out in scenes like this.

23
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:40,040
You said they don't come out!

24
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,940
Dad?

25
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:55,300
You naughty girl!

26
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,860
Going to a single man's house with no fear.

27
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:01,180
I told you, I went to dry my clothes off.

28
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:04,350
I told you to not trust any men in the world other than me.

29
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:09,800
Mom said that she walked down the aisle pregnant with Unni.

30
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:14,100
Exactly! See? Men are all like that.

31
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:18,920
Whatever! It's so embarrassing. How do I face Lee Su Ho again?

32
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,730
I really can't live because of you!

33
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:25,750
By the way, you can't tell Mom that I was mooching off at Su Ho's house.

34
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:30,010
Then you can't tell Mom that I'm dating Lee Su Ho either.

35
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:35,250
You know I'm tight-lipped, right?

36
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,830
You know I take after you, right?

37
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:48,570
- You think Mom's sleeping?
 - She's probably sleeping.

38
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:50,890
She sleeps by this time.

39
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,610
- Mom must be sleeping.
 - Let's go.

40
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:15,190
Long time no see.

41
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:18,640
At ease. Attention.

42
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:23,520
So, did you get Columbus Park?

43
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,220
No...

44
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:29,110
How dare you step your foot here?!

45
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:31,250
- Honey, Honey, just a sec. 
 - Mom! Mom!

46
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:32,830
Honey, just listen for a sec.

47
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:35,180
- Stop right there! 
- Listen to my story.

48
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:36,860
I'm a victim too.

49
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,590
- Honey! 
 - Wait a minute!

50
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:41,160
Huh?

51
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,030
Did you and your dad get in trouble?

52
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:55,190
Dad got into bigger trouble with Mom.

53
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:58,160
Sorry, my dad was a total nuisance, right?

54
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,680
No, I liked it.

55
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,020
- You must be tired. Go to bed.
 - Okay.

56
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:08,300
- Good night. 
 - Good night.

57
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,140
Why aren't you hanging up?

58
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:18,750
You hang up first.

59
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:27,470
Why aren't you hanging up?

60
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,490
I want to see you.

61
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:31,470
Me too.

62
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:38,480
- We're going to be up all night. 
 - That's okay.

63
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:01,050
Really perfect.

64
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:07,900
You seem relaxed. Relaxed.

65
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,580
So frustrating.

66
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:12,490
 Lee Su Ho must've felt like this. 

67
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:14,620
 I should tell the guys soon. 

68
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,500
Im Ju, good morning!

69
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:31,260
Mr. Han, here you go.

70
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,680
Thanks.

71
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,310
 Desired University/Desired Major
Korea Univ. / Makeup Dept.
Seo Yeon Univ. / Beauty Cosmetology
Yeon Li Univ / Cosmetology 

72
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:38,300
- Are you studying makeup?
 - It's still just wishful thinking.

73
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:41,620
It's what I hope, that's what I'm saying.

74
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,370
Good luck.

75
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:45,470
Thank you.

76
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:50,690
Mr. Jun Woo, is that lady from that day really your girlfriend?

77
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:52,150
No.

78
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:54,570
I don't have a girlfriend. I don't know what you're talking about.

79
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:57,090
She said girlfriend.

80
00:07:57,090 --> 00:08:01,120
- That lady who works at Move, Im Hui— 
 - Arg!

81
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:05,270
Eat! Please.

82
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:12,630
I'm sorry. The bread is just so good.

83
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:16,300
Please eat. You may have it.

84
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,160
Thanks.

85
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,780
Is your headache getting better?

86
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:27,070
Fresh air is helping me feel better.

87
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:29,650
The weather is so nice today.

88
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:32,980
I know. The clouds are so pretty.

89
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,260
I...

90
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:43,670
- have something to tell you today.
- Something to tell me?

91
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:47,550
I wanted to tell you before I tell the others.

92
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:52,470
That...

93
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:56,820
- This— 
 - Right, I have somthing to tell you, too.

94
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:59,180
You said before

95
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:02,330
that if the kids found out about your real self, they'd turn from you.

96
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:04,800
So you can't take off that mask.

97
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:08,320
I couldn't tell you back then,

98
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,470
but I'm like that too.

99
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:12,020
What happened?

100
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:14,020
Actually...

101
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,740
my dad hits me when he gets mad sometimes.

102
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,190
What?

103
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:23,010
You didn't know, right?

104
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:26,240
Pretending like it's nothing, pretending like it's okay, pretending like it's all cool.

105
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,790
That's what I'm good at.

106
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:29,920
S-Su Jin.

107
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,700
I thought I hid it well,

108
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,800
but Lee Su Ho knew everything.

109
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,140
Lee Su Ho?

110
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:39,890
When my mask was broken in front of him,

111
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,520
I guess I didn't want to pretend anymore.

112
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:47,030
Pretending I don't like him, pretending we're just friends.

113
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:52,610
I like Lee Su Ho.

114
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:57,190
So I can't treat him like I used to.

115
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:02,380
I'm telling you because I'm frustrated. Since you're my best friend.

116
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:10,570
Why are you so surprised?

117
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:12,330
Let's go in.

118
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:30,300
 You know, Su Jin. Actually ... 

119
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,180
 - I'm dating Lee Su Ho. 
- What? 

120
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:37,230
 I think I have to tell you. 

121
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:40,850
 Are you saying you really are dating Lee Su Ho? 

122
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:43,740
 Then you didn't tell me a word while you guys were flirting? 

123
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:46,430
 I guess I was the only one who thought we're best friends. How can you do this to me? 

124
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:48,580
 If you told me earlier, then I wouldn't have let my feelings grow. 

125
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:51,980
 I didn't mean to deceive you. I'm sorry.  I'm truly sorry. 

126
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:54,040
 If you're sorry, then will you break up with him? 

127
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:58,510
 How could I? Su Jin, can you just understand me this once? Please? 

128
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,530
 Understand? 

129
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,710
 From this moment, we're not friends anymore. 

130
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:11,150
 - Su Jin! 
- Are you the bitch dating Lee Su Ho? 

131
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:12,760
 Bring this bitch to the rooftop. 

132
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,160
 No! No! 

133
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,350
 No! Oh gosh. 

134
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:19,770
 Su Jin! 

135
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:20,950
 Don't cry. 

136
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:22,310
 Are you okay, Su Jin? 

137
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:25,730
 You insisted that you didn't have a boyfriend. How deceptive. 

138
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:28,700
 - Seriously... 
 - That was too much. 

139
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:33,500
 fStop it, everybody. It's my fault that I didn't confess to Lee Su Ho earlier. 

140
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:36,080
 It's not your fault. 

141
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,160
 What are you saying? 

142
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:42,720
 Kang Su Jin, do you like me? 

143
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,740
 Since when? Why didn't you tell me? 

144
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:47,010
 How could I say it? We've been friends for ten years. 

145
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:50,930
 How can I tell you that suddenly I have feelings for you? 

146
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:53,200
 If I knew this, I wouldn't have dated Im Ju Gyeong. 

147
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,490
 So what? You're her boyfriend now. 

148
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,470
 I'll put everything back to where they belong. 

149
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:02,000
 Im Ju Gyeong, let's break up. 

150
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,010
 - Huh? 
 - Oh my god! 

151
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:09,070
No!

152
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,780
- What the heck? 
- Goodness!

153
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:16,270
Okay. Since Ju Gyeong is so against it,

154
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:18,560
I won't extend the range for finals.

155
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,380
- Wow. 
 - Yay!

156
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:22,060
- Ju Gyeong! 
 - Good job!

157
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:33,200
Im Ju Gyeong.

158
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:37,130
- Why are you going by yourself? 
 - Hmm?

159
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:39,130
There is a group study today.

160
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:44,220
So we can go together.

161
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:47,450
Lee Su Ho!

162
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:50,390
Are you going straight to the study?

163
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:54,760
I... will skip it today.

164
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,540
Why? What's wrong?

165
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:00,920
I don't feel so well.

166
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:03,050
Bye.

167
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,440
Bye.

168
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,340
Is she really sick?

169
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:27,280
   
 What do I do? 

170
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:30,700
 I'm dating someone at school secretly, and my BFF says she likes my boyfriend. 

171
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:34,050
 If you were me, would you come clean to your BFF? 

172
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:37,310
  Don't date. Take it to your grave. It's my tip having experienced losing both. 

173
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:39,840
 If she's your real BFF, she'll understand you. 
 You can always get a new boyfriend. 

174
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:43,100
 How can you break up just because of your friend when you really like him? 

175
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,010
What do I do?

176
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,610
 Do you want to meet me at Prince Comics? 

177
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:55,520
 Han Go Woon's not here, so don't worry. 

178
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:04,960
 Prince Comics 

179
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:09,470
Did you take medicine? I didn't know what was wrong, so I bought everything.

180
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:13,470
No, I don't need medicine. I just have to get some rest.

181
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:17,020
Still, you should take some medicine. Then eat some porridge first.

182
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:18,910
Here.

183
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:28,550
What's wrong? Do you feel really sick?

184
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:32,950
No... I just appreciate it.

185
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:37,190
You worked out on top of your part-time job yesterday.

186
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:39,080
You must have pushed yourself too hard.

187
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:42,220
Should I not have asked you to come out?

188
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:45,070
Really... what are you?

189
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:48,670
Why are you so sweet to me?

190
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:52,780
You're even smart on top of being good-looking!

191
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:56,400
Your rude way of talking was the only flaw you had! What are you going to do being this sweet now?!

192
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,520
When you're this perfect, how can anyone see you just as a friend?

193
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:01,500
Ten out of ten, everyone would fall for you!

194
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,230
Who did you fall for?

195
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,980
- What's wrong? 
-  Dad was right.

196
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:23,340
He said if I date a cute guy, I'd suffer because of his good looks.

197
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,690
It's hot.

198
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,200
Blow on it first.

199
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:39,230
Eat the meat. Yeah, that.

200
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:53,760
Oh, are you going to keep being mad at me?

201
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:57,140
You're not talking to me anymore? Jun Woo.

202
00:15:57,140 --> 00:16:01,230
Han Jun Woo. Honey.

203
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,130
I mean...

204
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:11,790
I ...

205
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:16,130
I... I did misunderstand because I went crazy momentarily.

206
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:19,380
But what woman wouldn't get mad when her man is acting like that with someone else?

207
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:23,540
All those teachers teach Ju Gyeong.

208
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:27,230
Did you ever think that it might put me in an awkward position?

209
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:31,180
About that... I'm sorry.

210
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:33,590
If you had told me ahead of time, I wouldn't have misunderstood.

211
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:36,330
You never tell me anything, so why should I?

212
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,760
I know you drink a lot these days.

213
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,730
I can tell clearly something is going on at work, but you don't share anything with me.

214
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:44,360
What's the use in showing you my weak side?

215
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,680
Should I cry?

216
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:53,130
You and I aren't strangers. We're us.

217
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:58,650
From now on when things get hard, let's share the pain together.

218
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,840
What should I do?

219
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:10,390
I want to kiss you right now.

220
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:13,630
You're crazy! You're nuts!

221
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:16,230
I'll tell you everything.

222
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:19,210
Even what I ate for lunch.

223
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,900
 Beautician Makeup - Preparation Book for Test Taking 

224
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,700
 9. For a comparison between cool tone vs. warm tone, please choose the right explanation among the choices below. 

225
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:29,760
 (changed to) love vs. friendship 

226
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,400
- Hey, Im Ju Bal! 
 - I told you to knock!

227
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,170
- Hey.  Do you have any comics to return? 
 - No.

228
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:43,900
- How about anything you want to borrow? 
 - No.

229
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,660
Why not? Why?

230
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:48,860
- You usually borrow ten at a time! 
 - This kid.

231
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:52,820
Hey, why are you acting like you're dying to go to the comic book store?

232
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:56,260
Dying to? Dying to?

233
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:59,770
I don't even want to go near Prince Comics!

234
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:06,940
I'm already feeling bothered as it is. Why is he being like that, too?

235
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,200
 My Friend Su Jin 

236
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:20,910
Yeah, Su Jin.

237
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:34,180
- What? 
 - What do you mean? I came to borrow some comics.

238
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:44,310
 One Night with a Rugged Wolf  
  Oh, why is this one...

239
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:49,320
I get how you feel, but read it three years later.

240
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:53,000
Hey, I just picked the wrong one!

241
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,800
I'm not that kind of a person.

242
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:59,810
I might look this fatally handsome, but my heart is pure.

243
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:02,720
You're annoying me. Get out of my way.

244
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:07,020
I'm not curious, but I'm asking this meaninglessly since I have time to spare.

245
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,060
What's the reason?

246
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:10,680
There you go again.

247
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:14,230
I have a good look, body, and brain.

248
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:16,650
I'm perfect, so why would you reject me?

249
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:18,610
Because I don't like you.

250
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:21,130
That's what I mean. There's no reason to dislike me, but why do you dislike me?

251
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:23,760
Tell me ten reasons why you dislike me. I'll accept it then.

252
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,370
So annoying.

253
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:29,540
One, you're not my type. Two, you're too skinny.

254
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:32,600
Three, your narcism makes me want to throw up. Four, your awful voice.

255
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,230
Five, your personality is bad, too. Six, not fun.

256
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:39,620
Seven... Get lost before I give you a hundred more reasons.

257
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:41,690
Go Woon, Oppa's here.

258
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:43,560
Oppa! What are you doing here?

259
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:47,320
I was passing by. I thought you might be hungry, so I stopped by.

260
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:50,430
Oh, you're the best.

261
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:53,350
Han Seo Jun was her boyfriend?

262
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:02,610
Fine! Now I get it. Why she turned me down.

263
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:11,980
- Who's that idiot? 
 - He's an idiot.

264
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,870
Tell me if he bothers you.

265
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:18,720
I told you not to work part-time because it's hard! You're still young!

266
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,780
You're only a year older. You're acting like an old man.

267
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:23,280
What did you get me?

268
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,850
Oh, I was so hungry!

269
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:28,980
- You're the best. 
 - I know you!

270
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,970
She's really pretty.

271
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:46,730
She is really pretty.

272
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:50,260
Su Jin!

273
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:52,040
Ju Gyeong.

274
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:58,350
- Did you wait long? 
 - No. Let's go.

275
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:03,050
Let's look around.

276
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:04,590
You want to get a hat?

277
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:07,340
Yeah. What would be good?

278
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:11,900
How about this one? It'll look good on you!

279
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:16,040
It's not for me. It's a present for Lee Su Ho.

280
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,240
Lee Su Ho?

281
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:22,670
Out families had dinner together recently,

282
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:25,120
and he rescued me that day.

283
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,900
Oh... What do you mean?

284
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:31,150
I couldn't breathe because of my dad, and suddenly,

285
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:33,400
he said, "We have to go study. Kang Su Jin, let's go."

286
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,040
He got up and took me away.

287
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:39,190
He's so cool.

288
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:42,470
- I see... 
 - How's this? Do you think it'll look good on him?

289
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:47,260
You have a brother, so you must know what boys like.

290
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:49,650
Well... that seems nice.

291
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:52,210
Really? I'll get this one then.

292
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:56,130
- He should like it, right? 
 - Yeah.

293
00:21:56,130 --> 00:22:01,220
But, Ju Gyeong, should I confess when I give this to him?

294
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:05,700
- What? 
 - Will he be really shocked?

295
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,950
Still, we have a ten-year history together.

296
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:10,400
He won't totally reject me, will he?

297
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:18,410
I really don't know whether I should confess or not...

298
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:21,930
Anyway, you'll be rooting for me, right?

299
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:28,680
 ♡Boyfriend♡ 

300
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:34,070
Who is it? Answer it.

301
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:37,120
It's nothing.

302
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,270
 The person you called— 

303
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:42,200
 Girlfriend♡ 

304
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:46,410
 I'm helping Dad with his work, so I can't talk. 

305
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:49,420
Is she doing something where she can't even talk?

306
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:53,020
 Dad was right. 

307
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:56,970
 He said if I date a cute guy, I'd suffer because of his good looks.
 

308
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:04,540
 My girlfriend's dad 

309
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:07,250
 My girlfriend's dad caught us kissing. 

310
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:09,200
 - He'll want to kill you. 
 - See how you would feel when you have a daughter. 

311
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,490
 You can't even hold hands in front of your girlfriend's dad. 

312
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:23,500
 Lee Su Ho, you black-as-coal wolf-like punk! 

313
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:28,710
 I will kill you if you ever touch my daughter! 

314
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:32,770
I'm ruined.

315
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:34,760
Are you on your way to work?

316
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:37,030
Yeah. It's close by.

317
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:39,890
You're working hard. Oh.

318
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:43,490
I also got this when I was getting the hat. I thought it was cute.

319
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:46,990
- What do you think? 
 - It's cute.

320
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:51,120
Look, I got the same one for me!

321
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:55,140
It's really pretty. Thanks.

322
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,880
Hey, I'm the one who's more thankful.

323
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,810
You spent time with me when you're so busy.

324
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:03,610
- You'll be late to work. Go ahead. 
 - Yes.

325
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:07,640
- See you tomorrow. 
 - Okay. Get there safely.

326
00:24:27,810 --> 00:24:31,200
Huh? What are you doing here?

327
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:35,350
Boss asked me to fill in.

328
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:37,990
It's really annoying, but I couldn't do anything else.

329
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:40,310
I see.

330
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:43,010
I'll go get changed and be right out.

331
00:24:55,050 --> 00:24:58,120
Hey! Why are you putting your hair up all of a sudden?

332
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:01,040
Who told you you can do that in front of your friend?

333
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:04,010
I have to, to work. What's wrong with you?

334
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:08,630
Oh... Put it up then.

335
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:17,180
♫  I like you  ♫

336
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,840
Here you go.

337
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,570
Welcome!

338
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:21,680
An Americano and—

339
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,980
One Americano.

340
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:25,570
- And a latte. 
 - One latte.

341
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:28,240
- Here you go. 
 - Thank you.

342
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:32,080
♫  I will become happy at the end  ♫

343
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,810
♫  You will also come to look at me only  ♫

344
00:25:34,810 --> 00:25:37,610
- I can do it. 
 - No, it's okay. I got it.

345
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:42,800
♫  We'll shine and we will be loving  ♫

346
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:46,530
♫  Do you ever feel my love?  ♫

347
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:50,360
♫  We'll come to love each other  ♫

348
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:54,900
♫  Everyone will come to look at me only  ♫

349
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:57,870
♫  At the end, happy ending  ♫

350
00:25:57,870 --> 00:25:59,860
You can just rest.

351
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:05,540
How many times are you wiping this crystal clear window?

352
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:08,420
Did I?

353
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:10,670
What are you thinking about?

354
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:13,500
I'm not thinking about anything.

355
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:16,730
Did you have a fight with Lee Su Ho?

356
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:19,080
What fight?

357
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:22,720
You fought? You did fight.

358
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,700
I said we didn't.

359
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,890
How long has it been to already fight?

360
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:29,050
You should just break up. Break up!

361
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,920
Are you crying?

362
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:40,650
Did you really break up?

363
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,730
I told you no.

364
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:47,470
Just work.

365
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,780
What the heck?

366
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:02,150
Mr. Im.

367
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:05,700
Hello.

368
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:08,840
Su Ho, are you here to meet Ju Gyeong?

369
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:11,310
Oh no, what should we do? Ju Gyeong isn't home.

370
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:12,970
Really?

371
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,870
I thought she was home.

372
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:18,650
Then bye.

373
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:21,850
A moment, please.

374
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:25,840
I wanted to give you this.

375
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:42,800
 9979 - From Saebom Station to Saebom High School ... 

376
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:53,510
Your home isn't in this direction, is it?

377
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:57,380
- I'm going to go home together with Go Woon when her shift is done.  Why? 
 - Ah...

378
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:04,370
You've been sighing all day long.

379
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:11,990
Have you and your close friend ever liked one woman at the same time?

380
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:14,050
What?

381
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:17,810
Did Lee Su Ho say so? What did he say? How much did he tell you?

382
00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:20,640
Why are you suddenly worked up as if this is your story?

383
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,350
- Do you have someone you like? 
 - No!

384
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:25,510
That's not what I meant.

385
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:29,180
I meant, there was a time once when two women liked me at the same time.

386
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:31,800
Because I'm always popular, you know.

387
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,770
Showing off even in this situation.

388
00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:37,950
So, why did you ask me that?

389
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:44,190
Well... This is a story of my friend's friend.

390
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:46,660
My friend's friend has a boyfriend,

391
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:51,240
but my friend's friend's friend suddenly said she likes my friend's friend's boyfriend.

392
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:56,230
But my friend's friend's friend doesn't know yet that my friend's friend is dating that boyfriend.

393
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:58,460
So she said she's worried about it,

394
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:02,780
whether my friend's friend should tell her friend about dating this boyfriend.

395
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:06,650
Ah... What did you say?

396
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:11,260
Gosh...  So if I put it in an easy way,

397
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:14,630
I'm dating Lee Su Ho, and you and I are friends, right?

398
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:17,840
But this is the situation that both Lee Su Ho and you like—

399
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:23,840
- Are you kidding me? 
 - Was the metaphor a bit bad?

400
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,520
Anyway, so what I'm saying is—

401
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,980
So what you're saying is that Lee Su Ho and you are dating,

402
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:30,260
but Kang Su Jin also likes Lee Su Ho.

403
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:32,990
But Kang Su Jin doesn't know that Lee Su Ho and you are dating.

404
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:36,880
- In such a situation like that, right? 
 - Yes!

405
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:41,480
That's right, for example.  For example, I mean.

406
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:45,430
So what?  If you tell Kang Su Jin, you're worried that your friendship with her might get broken.

407
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:47,900
Which should you choose between love and friendship?

408
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:49,550
That's what you're asking, eh?

409
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:54,250
Well, I'm not even sure if this is a matter of choice, either.

410
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:58,000
Anyway, my friend's friend is worried about that.

411
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,950
If this friend is a woman, she should choose friendship.

412
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:02,700
Love doesn't last forever, does it?

413
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:06,880
Just tell her that she should break up with her boyfriend and strengthen her friendship.

414
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,770
Hey, how can she just break up when she likes him?

415
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:13,870
I don't know what kind of guy he is, but making such a situation itself is his fault.

416
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:17,650
She'd better break up with a man who has complicated relationships with girls.

417
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:21,750
- Break up! 
 - He doesn't have any complicated relationships with girls, though!

418
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:27,350
I mean, my friend's friend said so.

419
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,610
Don't worry.

420
00:30:30,610 --> 00:30:34,160
Lee Su Ho isn't someone who would make you worried.

421
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:37,510
I told you, this isn't my story.

422
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:39,710
If not, then never mind.

423
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:50,770
   When are you coming home?  Buy some ramen on your way home. 

424
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,380
Huh? Your shoelaces are loosened.

425
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:58,030
It's okay. Let's just go.

426
00:30:58,030 --> 00:31:00,380
Hey, if you fall down in the wrong way, your face can get a bad abrasion.

427
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:02,450
Tie it up quickly.

428
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:06,300
Why? Are you worried that my handsome face might get an abrasion?

429
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:08,700
Anything I have would look cool, you know?

430
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:13,940
You really have the same mental age as Im Ju Yeong.

431
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:16,650
Lift your foot, gosh...

432
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:19,810
You require so much maintenance.

433
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,210
Done!

434
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:31,190
Hey, Im Ju Gyeong!

435
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:34,390
It's untied again. You should tie it properly.

436
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:36,930
You can tie it again.

437
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:40,570
Is it okay for my face to get an abrasion, then? Huh?  Hey, hey!

438
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:44,020
- Watch out, you might fall.  
 - I'm really terrible at tying shoelaces.

439
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:46,810
- Seriously, tie it up. 
 - How do you tie it?

440
00:31:46,810 --> 00:31:49,840
- You really don't know how to tie it? 
 - I don't know.

441
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,240
 Prince Comics 

442
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:56,260
- Hey, Go Woon isn't here. 
 - Yeah?  Did she go home already?

443
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:58,900
Geez, you should've called her beforehand.

444
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:01,340
I'm going home.  Go home safely.

445
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:04,040
- Bye. 
 - Are you coming home now?

446
00:32:04,610 --> 00:32:07,390
Seo Jun!

447
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:10,870
- Hello.  
 - Oh, long time no see.

448
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:13,590
I guess you and Ju Gyeong have become close now.

449
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:16,060
I'm taking good care of her at school in many ways.

450
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:18,640
When did you ever take care of me?

451
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,470
Did you have dinner?  We're making dumplings at home.

452
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:23,940
Come and eat some before going home, Son.  And take some for Mi Hyang too.

453
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:27,110
Why are you telling him to have dinner with us? You should go home now.  Let's go, Mom.

454
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:30,580
Why? Mother, let's go.

455
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:33,010
Yes, let's go.

456
00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:34,670
- You must like dumplings! 
 - I like them a lot.

457
00:32:34,670 --> 00:32:36,130
Oh my god, what luck!

458
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:38,490
Why dumplings now?

459
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:42,200
Come in.  Our house is a bit shabby.

460
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:47,930
Right! I forgot to mention that our Ho is here.

461
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:54,960
Ju Gyeong's friends are all here now.

462
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,120
Our Ho?

463
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:59,880
W-W-Why are you here?

464
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:03,180
I met our Su Ho in front of our house.

465
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:06,480
I brought him home so that he can have dinner with us.

466
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:09,650
- Why are you two coming together?  
 - Today, at the part-time job—

467
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:12,850
You said your part-time job was a secret from your family!

468
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:14,680
We just hung out today.

469
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:18,050
You said you couldn't get out because of a family matter, but now you're saying you hung out with him?

470
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:20,920
- The thing is... 
 - Are you clamping down on her now?

471
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,960
Even if you two are dating—

472
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,670
My mom doesn't know we're dating!

473
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:27,880
Ah, so is this a secret too?

474
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:31,610
Since we have many hands now, we'll make dumplings quickly!

475
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:34,410
What? You didn't even make them yet?

476
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:36,980
Why do you make them make dumplings, seriously?!

477
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:40,010
Come on, dumplings should be steamed right after they were freshly made.

478
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:42,570
That way they are more delicious.  Don't you agree?

479
00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:44,810
Yes, ma'am.

480
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:50,190
Han Go Woon's boyfriend, Han Seo Jun.

481
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:53,060
I get to meet my rival in love here.

482
00:33:56,570 --> 00:34:01,110
Su Ho, sprinkle more flour, or they will be stuck together.

483
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:03,380
Thank you.

484
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:06,270
Wow, Seo Jun is making dumplings so prettily.

485
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:07,780
I've done it at home too.

486
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:12,250
Mom said that I should be able to make pretty dumplings to get a pretty daughter later.

487
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:13,890
That's why I learned it earnestly.

488
00:34:13,890 --> 00:34:15,850
Mi Hyang must make her dumplings beautifully,

489
00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:17,950
seeing her son is so pretty like you.

490
00:34:17,950 --> 00:34:19,110
Oh, no, I'm not.

491
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:22,140
- You must be popular at school. 
 - A little.

492
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:26,440
Popular?  No way, he can't reach the level of our dear Hyung, Su Ho.

493
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:29,940
Wow, he's glowing all over his body!

494
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:34,630
Wow! Look at the veins on his arm, wow!

495
00:34:35,470 --> 00:34:40,140
Anyway, Mr. Han Seo Jun, where did you go with my sister, setting aside your girlfriend?

496
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:43,100
Me? I don't have a girlfriend.

497
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:45,490
 What a bad man he is! 

498
00:34:45,490 --> 00:34:49,930
Well, you guys are working so hard, so please take a break, drinking water.

499
00:34:49,930 --> 00:34:52,670
Oops! Oh, no, what to do!

500
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:56,060
I almost spilled it on the floor.

501
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:57,470
What's wrong with him again?

502
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:59,720
- You should've been careful.  
 - Thank you.

503
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:04,400
Anyway, how lucky our Ju Gyeong is, having such handsome friends, and two at that!

504
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:08,810
Keep them closely as friends, and later when you go to college, pick one of them!

505
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:11,480
What do you mean, pick one?

506
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:17,360
For me, personally, I'd give my vote to Su Ho.

507
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:22,070
Gosh, why are you voting now?

508
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:25,020
Me too!  My vote to Hyung Su Ho!

509
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:28,250
Hyung, I love you.

510
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:34,150
To be honest, I called dibs on Seo Jun for my Ju Gyeong's future husband before.

511
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:37,030
If you need a ticket for Lee Ju Heon's fan meeting, please tell me any time.

512
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:40,580
Oh my, oh my, oh my! Really?

513
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:43,810
You don't even talk to your dad usually.

514
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:47,620
-  (silently) What, you bastard?   
 - Oh, no, whom should I choose? I can't decide. I really can't.

515
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:49,400
Why are you deciding between them, Mom?

516
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,530
Let's just make dumplings quietly, huh?  Hurry up.

517
00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:54,110
But it's fun, though.

518
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:59,310
I'll give my vote to the person who makes better dumplings between you two!

519
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:41,060
Wow, I can feel the force from these dumplings.

520
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:42,790
- This is like— 
 - It's neck and neck!

521
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:44,880
No, this is a battle between the dragon and the crane.

522
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:48,270
Still, I prefer the one on the right side a bit more...

523
00:38:50,690 --> 00:38:53,340
By the way, how did you make this part?

524
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,920
Dad!

525
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:07,780
Victory to Seo Jun!

526
00:39:07,850 --> 00:39:10,530
Yes!

527
00:39:10,530 --> 00:39:13,260
No, honey, it was all my fault—

528
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,910
Who cares about dumplings?

529
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:33,350
I'm so anxious I could die.

530
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:39,200
Can I come in?

531
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:45,550
O-O-One second!

532
00:39:49,410 --> 00:39:51,040
Sure!

533
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:57,670
Uh, I was just about to leave anyway!

534
00:40:00,990 --> 00:40:03,770
I guess this is what Im Ju Gyeong's room looks like.

535
00:40:03,770 --> 00:40:05,790
Yup, exactly. There's nothing much to see here, just like me.

536
00:40:05,790 --> 00:40:07,940
You saw everything, right? Let's go!

537
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:13,370
But if we leave, I can't talk with you.

538
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:18,350
So what did you do with Han Seo Jun?

539
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:21,540
Do? We worked together.

540
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:24,150
I mentioned that Han Seo Jun introduced me to a part-time job.

541
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:26,410
He was covering someone's shift today.

542
00:40:26,410 --> 00:40:29,240
But since my parents don't know I have a part-time job, we just made up the story.

543
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:30,980
Then you should have said you were working.

544
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:33,830
Why did you lie and say that there was an issue at home?

545
00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:35,290
Ah...

546
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:40,350
Just don't do that next time.

547
00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:45,170
Okay, sorry.

548
00:40:47,330 --> 00:40:52,650
Girls usually show their boyfriends their photo albums when they come over, don't they?

549
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,540
I'm taking those to the grave with me.

550
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:56,180
What's the point of showing you my dark past?

551
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:59,840
But to say so, the photos are too openly right on the top here.

552
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,980
This isn't me!

553
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:08,710
Little Sprouts Kindergarten, Im Ju Gyeong. It's written right here.

554
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:11,640
Ugh, why did this thing have to be here...

555
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:17,080
Huh?

556
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:22,250
Why? Are you shocked by how ugly I am?

557
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:23,820
You...

558
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:26,800
Hm?

559
00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:31,890
Never mind. Can I keep this photo?

560
00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:36,370
- Why would you grab that and take it? Give it back. 
 - Let me just keep one.

561
00:41:36,370 --> 00:41:38,120
- Why are you taking it? 
 - Just one!

562
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:41,300
- Give it back! Why do you want it? 
 - J-Just one picture!

563
00:41:47,790 --> 00:41:52,590
Ju Gyeong, have you seen Su Ho— Oh, you're here.

564
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:01,890
Even with your mom and dad at home, you little brat.

565
00:42:01,890 --> 00:42:05,150
- We just fell over! 
 - I know that you fell over.

566
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:09,320
-   Master Su Ho. Do you remember what I told you? Clear. 
 - Keep a clear mind.

567
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:11,190
- Pure. 
 - And be pure.

568
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:13,400
Don't forget that.

569
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:20,600
I was asked to bring the table downstairs.

570
00:42:23,570 --> 00:42:26,180
Where's the table?

571
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:29,130
It's here.

572
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:31,530
Wow, it's like you live here.

573
00:42:31,530 --> 00:42:34,080
Have you guys even been dating long enough to fight?

574
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:36,850
What are you saying? We didn't fight.

575
00:42:36,850 --> 00:42:41,170
As if. Why else would she be sighing and spacing out all day?

576
00:42:41,170 --> 00:42:44,390
Debating whether to choose love or friendship.

577
00:42:44,390 --> 00:42:48,610
No matter what happens between me and her, know your place.

578
00:42:48,610 --> 00:42:52,260
- It's none of your business. 
 - Since it's none of my business,

579
00:42:52,290 --> 00:42:55,330
don't make her anxious and come to me for relationship advice.

580
00:42:55,330 --> 00:42:58,340
It makes me want to butt in.

581
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:00,890
What kind of bullshit is that?

582
00:43:00,890 --> 00:43:03,140
Did I misspeak?

583
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,690
- Mom, I'm going to go put this away. 
 - Okay.

584
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:20,330
You little punk.

585
00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:23,670
Come here.

586
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:26,890
I'm going to pull out every damn hair on your head!

587
00:43:39,470 --> 00:43:41,060
Here.

588
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:48,160
- Keep them in the freezer and steam them before you eat them. Okay? 
 - Thank you.

589
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:49,940
And don't fight!

590
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:54,500
I don't know what kind of unspoken tension you two have, but try to talk it out.

591
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:57,320
Don't leave it and let it fester.

592
00:43:57,320 --> 00:44:00,430
They'll take care if it on their own. Let's go inside quickly.

593
00:44:00,430 --> 00:44:02,480
Come on, go inside!

594
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:05,710
Geez.

595
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:14,320
 I love you. 

596
00:44:16,810 --> 00:44:19,010
 I love you. 

597
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:28,080
 What are you boys fighting about at this age? 

598
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:32,400
 - I love you. 
 - I mean, this is the perfect age for them to be fighting and stuff. 

599
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:35,640
 - The dumplings smell good. 
 - I love you. 

600
00:44:49,250 --> 00:44:52,990
So I went to this restaurant today, and you know what they served as side dishes?

601
00:44:52,990 --> 00:44:56,080
Sweet and salty soybeans and shishito peppers.

602
00:44:56,080 --> 00:45:00,110
- They had stir-fried squid too. 
 - That's enough.

603
00:45:00,110 --> 00:45:02,350
You don't have to tell me those details too.

604
00:45:02,350 --> 00:45:04,740
I've been good today, keeping in touch, reporting back to you,

605
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:07,630
and even cancelling the team dinner, so why don't you reward me a little?

606
00:45:07,630 --> 00:45:10,570
- A reward? 
 - You know what I mean.

607
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:16,320
- I don't think I do... 
 - Watch it,  I'm not going to hang up until you do it.

608
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:31,560
You told me that you don't have a girlfriend.

609
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:43,280
Hm? What happened?

610
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:45,390
- They picked a great music video. 
 - I know, right?

611
00:45:45,390 --> 00:45:47,870
- They picked a really good one. 
 - It's so catchy.

612
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:51,270
Their debut song was quite gentle, so we were worried that it wouldn't have much impact.

613
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:53,370
But it's nice. Oh, you scared me!

614
00:45:53,370 --> 00:45:55,530
What the hell is this?

615
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:59,440
- Manager Im. 
 - No way, this is the debut song for Black Soul?

616
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:03,790
- This is a song by Leo. 
 - Huh? What are you saying?

617
00:46:03,790 --> 00:46:07,270
The tribute album was overturned, so how can this song be released like this?

618
00:46:07,270 --> 00:46:10,790
Did you buy the rights from Leo? Did you get his approval?

619
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:21,700
 Im Ju Gyeong's spot. 
 Sitting without permission will cause hair to grow on your butt! 

620
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:45,620
 - Hey, crybaby, you're back again? 
 - I'm not a crybaby. 

621
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:50,840
 Aren't you the kid who was crying here last time? Meow meow~ 

622
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:52,970
 I only cried once. 

623
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:57,700
 Oh? I came here to read that book. 

624
00:46:57,700 --> 00:47:00,910
 You can borrow it when I'm finished. Comic books are first come first serve— 

625
00:47:00,910 --> 00:47:05,720
 I know, I know. You're so cheap, seriously. 

626
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:20,740
 Oh, this person was a ghost. 

627
00:47:20,740 --> 00:47:23,610
 Wait, I didn't finish this page yet. 

628
00:47:23,610 --> 00:47:27,330
 - I did. 
 - I told you I'm not done! 

629
00:47:30,770 --> 00:47:32,690
 Mister! This got ripped—! 

630
00:47:32,690 --> 00:47:35,510
 Shush! This is our secret. 

631
00:47:49,690 --> 00:47:52,510
That kid was Im Ju Gyeong?

632
00:48:08,030 --> 00:48:14,840
♫  I just don't have the courage  ♫

633
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:18,600
♫  I'm afraid it will be too much for you  ♫

634
00:48:18,630 --> 00:48:22,690
 It's not right to make fun of someone's insecurities. 

635
00:48:22,690 --> 00:48:26,550
 Sorry. I'm sorry. 

636
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:28,740
 It's okay now. 

637
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:35,240
♫  I am loving you  ♫

638
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:42,420
♫  Fall in you, I just found out  ♫

639
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:49,570
♫  Fall in you, I am waiting for you  ♫

640
00:48:49,570 --> 00:48:54,380
♫  Fall in you, you are my destiny  ♫

641
00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:57,430
 The person I like is you. 

642
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:04,290
♫  The one person who will be my star  ♫

643
00:49:04,290 --> 00:49:10,470
♫  The one person who wants to give me everything  ♫

644
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:31,530
♫  You, you, you  ♫

645
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:37,300
Im Ju, Im Ju, Im Ju!

646
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:38,800
What's wrong, again?

647
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:41,880
How long have you been dating? Why didn't you tell us?

648
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:45,260
Are you guys the second couple from our classroom?

649
00:49:45,260 --> 00:49:51,170
- Ju Gyeong, is it true? 
 - Su Jin, I didn't mean to trick you—

650
00:49:52,150 --> 00:49:56,830
Congratulations!

651
00:49:56,830 --> 00:50:01,240
I heard that you're secretly dating Han Seo Jun! Taking couple photos and stuff!

652
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:03,850
What?

653
00:50:03,850 --> 00:50:06,120
Me and Han Seo Jun?

654
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:10,100
- What are you guys doing here? 
 - Congrats!

655
00:50:19,210 --> 00:50:21,110
Hey, you frustrating fool!

656
00:50:21,110 --> 00:50:24,070
I told you that Im Ju Gyeong got a boyfriend, didn't I?

657
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:25,900
Look at this pose.

658
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:29,300
Wow... They look good together, huh?

659
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:31,940
Should you steal her? But stealing is a bit so-so.

660
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:34,520
What are you going to do?!

661
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:38,240
Tell us! Tell us!

662
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:41,190
Tell us! Tell us!

663
00:50:41,190 --> 00:50:43,770
I will be asking a question from Hyeon Gyu's Patch. 
 (Play on 'Dispatch,' news source that often reveals celebrity relationships) 

664
00:50:43,770 --> 00:50:48,130
Is the man that you were secretly dating at K-Mall Han Seo Jun?

665
00:50:48,130 --> 00:50:50,940
- Are you denying it? 
 - Can't wait to hear more!

666
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:54,290
Okay, everybody!

667
00:50:54,290 --> 00:50:58,230
We are just friends, nothing more or less.

668
00:50:58,230 --> 00:51:02,310
So I ask that you guys do not circulate speculative rumors any more.

669
00:51:02,310 --> 00:51:04,740
Are you doing a news conference or something?

670
00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:08,690
You should say something too. Are you going to leave them misunderstanding?

671
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:16,560
You guys! I won't stay still if you guys spout nonsense in front of me.

672
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:19,320
Is that good enough?

673
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:28,340
Tell us the truth. Did you or not?

674
00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:31,590
Man Sik! I'm getting angry.

675
00:51:31,590 --> 00:51:33,150
You did, you did!

676
00:51:33,150 --> 00:51:36,360
He did, he really did!

677
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:38,250
I'm sorry.

678
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:43,320
Why do these rumors with Han Seo Jun keep coming up?

679
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:45,170
Might as well just date!

680
00:51:45,170 --> 00:51:46,900
How many times has this rumor spread about?

681
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:50,640
If it's this much, you guys are a destined couple.

682
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,160
We're just friends.

683
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:54,090
You could be friends and then like each other later.

684
00:51:54,090 --> 00:51:57,100
The thing about feelings is that it's not the same color forever.

685
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:59,790
Kang Su, then you should date Lee Su Ho.

686
00:51:59,790 --> 00:52:02,910
You guys could be friends and then suddenly like each other. Is that not so?

687
00:52:02,910 --> 00:52:07,020
Im Ju Gyeong ♡  Han Seo Jun. Kang Su Jin ♡  Lee Su Ho.

688
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:10,300
The images are coming out! I just got a feeling.

689
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:11,680
Should I?

690
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:13,650
What? Are you for real?

691
00:52:13,650 --> 00:52:15,890
Nah.

692
00:52:15,890 --> 00:52:18,300
You're suspicious. This won't do.

693
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:20,800
I'm going to have to properly dig around today.

694
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:23,700
Do you have time after school today? Let's hang out as three.

695
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:27,360
I can't. I have a commitment with Lee Su Ho today.

696
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:29,810
- What? 
 - With Lee Su Ho? The two of you? Why?

697
00:52:29,810 --> 00:52:31,850
Just cause. I'll tell you later.

698
00:52:31,850 --> 00:52:33,500
What is it, seriously?

699
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:37,750
Is there really something with you and Lee Su Ho? Tell me!

700
00:52:37,750 --> 00:52:38,720
  Boyfriend: See you at the rooftop. 

701
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:40,510
Who is it?

702
00:52:42,530 --> 00:52:44,300
It's nothing.

703
00:52:54,830 --> 00:52:57,330
Don't you have something to say to me?

704
00:52:57,330 --> 00:52:59,300
What do you mean?

705
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:01,330
What's with the pictures?

706
00:53:01,330 --> 00:53:03,320
That's an angry tone.

707
00:53:05,570 --> 00:53:06,700
I'm angry.

708
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:09,090
We met coincidentally and did a part-time job together.

709
00:53:09,090 --> 00:53:12,250
You met him at the café as a substitute somehow.

710
00:53:12,250 --> 00:53:13,970
- And this is a coincidence? 
 - Yeah.

711
00:53:13,970 --> 00:53:15,490
Then why didn't you tell me?

712
00:53:15,490 --> 00:53:19,380
That day, I was going to tell you right away but because  you ended the call—

713
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:27,990
Then what about you? Do you tell me every time you're meeting someone?

714
00:53:27,990 --> 00:53:31,110
- What? 
- I just took the pictures because he told me I'd get paid.

715
00:53:31,110 --> 00:53:33,330
I don't like it that you and Han Seo Jun keep getting tangled together.

716
00:53:33,330 --> 00:53:34,820
I also don't like these rumors being made.

717
00:53:34,820 --> 00:53:38,440
- You know we're just friends though. 
 - How would you know his feel—

718
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:42,780
How can one be friends in a male-female relationship?

719
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:47,210
Then what about you?

720
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:50,140
Isn't Su Jin a long time friend of yours?

721
00:53:50,140 --> 00:53:52,490
Why did she come up in this conversation?

722
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:14,130
Even if you carry these heavy things and flirt in front of me,

723
00:54:14,130 --> 00:54:16,130
I'm never going to help you.

724
00:54:16,130 --> 00:54:19,830
Why? Because my feelings for you are gone.

725
00:54:19,830 --> 00:54:21,680
What are you saying?

726
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:24,760
This won't do.

727
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:27,470
But I can't stand seeing you struggle.

728
00:54:27,470 --> 00:54:28,900
Give it to me. I'll hold it for you.

729
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:30,260
No need. It's heavy.

730
00:54:30,260 --> 00:54:31,690
That's why I'll carry it.

731
00:54:31,690 --> 00:54:32,970
It's really heavy.

732
00:54:32,970 --> 00:54:36,400
I won't say it three times. I'll carry it.

733
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:55,700
This... I mean, the sound that you heard just now...

734
00:54:58,420 --> 00:54:59,930
You did well.

735
00:54:59,930 --> 00:55:03,570
If you hold in a fart, you'll get sick.

736
00:55:12,930 --> 00:55:18,090
I let you go, but why are you smiling so prettily?

737
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:27,420
Read the conversation of these two students, and in the closed interval  ...

738
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:31,640
The graph of the continuous function y=f(x)...

739
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:33,860
About the y-axis...

740
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:01,500
Mr. Han Seo Jun!

741
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:04,020
Im Ju Gyeong's brother?

742
00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:07,040
Hit me. I'll receive it in advance.

743
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:08,670
What are you saying?

744
00:56:08,670 --> 00:56:12,690
I'm going to steal her from you.

745
00:56:14,130 --> 00:56:15,850
Hello?

746
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:22,710
If you can't do it, then I'll get hit after I steal her from you.

747
00:56:23,870 --> 00:56:26,290
That psycho!

748
00:56:26,290 --> 00:56:27,490
Who did you say you were?

749
00:56:27,490 --> 00:56:31,020
  Move Entertainment's Im Hui Gyeong. We met last time, didn't we? 

750
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:35,180
Then have you really never met with an employee from our company?

751
00:56:35,180 --> 00:56:37,680
I said I haven't!

752
00:56:51,810 --> 00:56:53,440
Director Oh.

753
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:55,230
Oh, I'm a bit busy.

754
00:56:55,230 --> 00:56:57,420
I have something to ask you.

755
00:56:57,420 --> 00:57:00,890
- What is it?
- I heard the debut song for Black Soul got changed in a rush.

756
00:57:00,890 --> 00:57:05,750
Coincidentally, its timing perfectly matches with the time when my transfer and the cancellation on my project were announced.

757
00:57:05,750 --> 00:57:07,820
Why are you saying that to me?

758
00:57:07,820 --> 00:57:09,830
Grabbing a hold of someone busy.

759
00:57:09,830 --> 00:57:13,230
You plagiarized Se Yeon's and Leo's song!

760
00:57:13,230 --> 00:57:15,270
I confirmed it with the producer.

761
00:57:15,270 --> 00:57:17,490
They said it was an order from the CEO's end.

762
00:57:17,490 --> 00:57:18,950
Why are you doing it to this extent?

763
00:57:18,950 --> 00:57:23,280
Is there another reason as to why you don't want Se Yeon's memorial album to be released?

764
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:27,960
Plagiarism, you say.

765
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:30,780
Why are you fussing over a song that isn't even copyrighted?

766
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:36,770
To be blunt, even if Jeong Se Yeon or Leo's side claims its copyright, who would believe it's their song?

767
00:57:36,770 --> 00:57:39,770
- What?
 - If you want to keep working at this company,

768
00:57:39,770 --> 00:57:44,130
close your mouth and quietly do the work you were assigned to.

769
00:57:44,130 --> 00:57:47,020
Don't cause such unnecessary trouble.

770
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:56,770
Wow, what kind of jerk!

771
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:01,070
Yes, Reporter Choi?

772
00:58:01,070 --> 00:58:05,260
Yes, yes. I mailed the promotional materials to you.

773
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:08,510
Wait. I have something to ask.

774
00:58:08,510 --> 00:58:11,250
About the article on Se Yeon's school violence back then...

775
00:58:11,250 --> 00:58:12,870
Yes, yes.

776
00:58:24,460 --> 00:58:26,690
 Should I confess when I give this to him? 

777
00:58:26,690 --> 00:58:29,530
  I have a commitment with Lee Su Ho today. 

778
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:36,790
What is this?

779
00:58:36,790 --> 00:58:39,250
  Gentle Foam
 Cleansing Foam 

780
00:58:41,260 --> 00:58:45,270
  (writing a new text) Ju Gyeong... 

781
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:50,060
Honestly, don't I have the right to be mad?

782
00:59:00,290 --> 00:59:02,220
Who is it?

783
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:05,960
Why are you here so late?

784
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:08,590
Why is it so cold in here? You don't turn on the heater, do you?

785
00:59:08,590 --> 00:59:11,560
I told you to turn on the heater.

786
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:14,060
So heavy.

787
00:59:14,060 --> 00:59:17,260
- What is it? 
 - I told my mom to pack some side dishes.

788
00:59:17,260 --> 00:59:21,060
Your father asked me to take care of you, so I can't pretend to not know.

789
00:59:21,060 --> 00:59:24,160
I'm okay, though. It's not like I eat much at home.

790
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:26,030
After I brought it all the way here.

791
00:59:26,030 --> 00:59:28,260
If there are leftovers, you can throw them away.

792
00:59:29,290 --> 00:59:31,090
Are you not leaving?

793
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:35,940
You heartless man. I haven't been here in such a long time, and you not even going to give me water?

794
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:39,080
Anyway...

795
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:42,980
How is there nothing that has changed here?

796
00:59:44,140 --> 00:59:46,890
That painting is still hung there.

797
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:05,660
 Girlfriend♡ 

798
01:00:05,660 --> 01:00:08,090
- Excuse me. 
 - Hello?

799
01:00:18,260 --> 01:00:20,390
You should quickly drink this and go.

800
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:26,600
Then would I live here?

801
01:00:29,290 --> 01:00:31,030
Here.

802
01:00:31,030 --> 01:00:32,100
What's this?

803
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:34,360
A present. Not sure if you'll like it though.

804
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:35,420
A present all of a sudden? Why?

805
01:00:35,420 --> 01:00:38,200
There are things I'm thankful for. Just receive it.

806
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:41,000
Can't I give you a present?

807
01:00:48,170 --> 01:00:50,990
Have we ever given each other presents because we were thankful?

808
01:00:50,990 --> 01:00:54,320
And must you give me this at this time?

809
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:57,040
I didn't come to just give you this.

810
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:59,720
I came because I wanted to see you. Why?

811
01:01:01,230 --> 01:01:05,730
These days, you've been on my mind.

812
01:01:07,310 --> 01:01:09,300
I can't receive it.

813
01:01:10,270 --> 01:01:11,540
You can use it instead.

814
01:01:11,540 --> 01:01:13,830
Why? Do you not like it? Shall I exchange it?

815
01:01:13,830 --> 01:01:16,230
I have a girlfriend.

816
01:01:17,260 --> 01:01:21,350
And so? What about it?

817
01:01:21,350 --> 01:01:23,150
That...

818
01:01:25,100 --> 01:01:29,060
What's this? Whoever sees this would think I confessed to you.

819
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:30,660
Why are you over-reacting?

820
01:01:30,660 --> 01:01:32,900
But you have a girlfriend? Who is it?

821
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:35,030
I'll tell you later.

822
01:01:35,030 --> 01:01:38,130
It's late. You should go back now.

823
01:02:04,700 --> 01:02:07,800
  kang s.j. uploaded a new photo. 

824
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:29,040
 Incoming call - Boyfriend 

825
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:36,710
Hello?

826
01:02:36,710 --> 01:02:40,330
It's me.

827
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:45,020
 Were you sleeping? 

828
01:02:46,390 --> 01:02:48,130
No.

829
01:02:49,300 --> 01:02:51,560
What did you do?

830
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:56,090
Just... I was at home.

831
01:03:01,340 --> 01:03:05,230
- Earlier at school— 
 - I'm a bit tired, so let's talk tomorrow.

832
01:03:05,230 --> 01:03:07,200
I'm hanging up.

833
01:03:20,120 --> 01:03:25,800
  Girlfriend ♡ 

834
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:27,570
Goodnight.

835
01:03:35,450 --> 01:03:37,680
Here's your coffee.

836
01:03:51,180 --> 01:03:53,200
Im Ju Gyeong.

837
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:55,530
Stop playing around.

838
01:03:55,530 --> 01:03:57,150
Sorry.

839
01:04:01,430 --> 01:04:02,500
I said don't.

840
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:05,060
'I said don't.'

841
01:04:05,060 --> 01:04:08,270
- I told you to stop.
 - 'I told you to stop.'

842
01:04:09,100 --> 01:04:09,960
What's wrong with you today?

843
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:12,300
Smile a little.

844
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:22,020
Why are you here?

845
01:04:22,020 --> 01:04:23,970
Can't I be here?

846
01:04:25,130 --> 01:04:28,680
You said you were covering for someone that day, yet here you are again.

847
01:04:28,680 --> 01:04:31,520
He's here per the owner's request. The part-timer quit.

848
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:33,930
Your boyfriend is scary.

849
01:04:33,930 --> 01:04:35,130
It's not like he's interrogating.

850
01:04:35,130 --> 01:04:36,180
Let's talk.

851
01:04:36,180 --> 01:04:37,650
I'm working.

852
01:04:37,650 --> 01:04:40,150
Then I'll wait.

853
01:04:40,150 --> 01:04:41,860
Whatever that's cold.

854
01:04:41,860 --> 01:04:44,720
Are you going to surveil her? That's obsession.

855
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:47,450
It's between us. Stay out.

856
01:04:47,450 --> 01:04:49,520
I'll just call you when I'm done.

857
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:50,420
Am I a bother?

858
01:04:50,420 --> 01:04:52,460
That's not it.

859
01:04:54,990 --> 01:04:58,370
Okay. I'll wait outside.

860
01:04:58,370 --> 01:05:00,500
Let me know when you're done.

861
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:11,970
You should just go.

862
01:05:11,970 --> 01:05:14,460
What? How can I?

863
01:05:14,460 --> 01:05:17,210
It's slow today. I can handle it.

864
01:05:17,210 --> 01:05:19,650
So go fight or make up.

865
01:05:19,650 --> 01:05:22,430
Don't make me uncomfortable too.

866
01:05:22,430 --> 01:05:24,060
Sorry.

867
01:05:40,920 --> 01:05:42,570
I want to get plastic surgery for double-eyelids.

868
01:05:42,570 --> 01:05:45,430
No, no.Then your sexiness will be gone.

869
01:05:45,430 --> 01:05:46,380
I'm sexy?

870
01:05:46,380 --> 01:05:48,250
It's in there somewhere.

871
01:05:48,250 --> 01:05:51,560
- Should I reduce my cheekbones?
 - No, then your cuteness will be gone.

872
01:05:51,560 --> 01:05:54,680
- Then should I have my eyes extended?
 - Then you'll be gone.

873
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:57,520
Welcome.

874
01:05:57,520 --> 01:06:00,220
- Hi Han Seo Jun.
 - Hello.

875
01:06:02,070 --> 01:06:03,170
Oh, Lee Seong Yong's girlfriend?

876
01:06:03,170 --> 01:06:04,380
It's been a while since we broke up.

877
01:06:04,380 --> 01:06:05,560
- They broke up.
 - They broke up.

878
01:06:05,560 --> 01:06:07,480
- Just order.
 - Something not fattening for me.

879
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:10,190
You should eat avocados.

880
01:06:10,190 --> 01:06:12,670
I came here to give you this.

881
01:06:15,260 --> 01:06:18,030
I thought I lost it.

882
01:06:18,030 --> 01:06:19,760
Why do you have this?

883
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:22,720
Why are you fussing when I found it for you?

884
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:28,920
By the way, that girl who just went out is Im Ju Gyeong of Saebom High, right?

885
01:06:30,100 --> 01:06:32,310
What are you going to do if that's right?

886
01:06:32,310 --> 01:06:35,500
I'm just asking.

887
01:06:35,500 --> 01:06:36,800
Does she work with you?

888
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:38,050
Are you not ordering?

889
01:06:38,050 --> 01:06:40,590
- Affokato.
 - Avocado please.

890
01:06:40,590 --> 01:06:42,360
It's Affogato.

891
01:06:42,360 --> 01:06:45,240
- Affokato.
 - It's avocado.

892
01:06:45,240 --> 01:06:48,300
 (TN. Affogato - a mix of ice cream with expresso coffee) 

893
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:56,240
You're here.

894
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,420
What is it that you have to say?

895
01:06:58,420 --> 01:07:02,870
Let's tell everyone that we're dating.

896
01:07:02,870 --> 01:07:03,950
I'm going to tell.

897
01:07:03,950 --> 01:07:05,190
Why suddenly?

898
01:07:05,190 --> 01:07:06,960
I don't want to hide it anymore.

899
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:09,160
You said it was okay.

900
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:13,230
Why? You don't want to?

901
01:07:13,230 --> 01:07:16,960
It's still a little... weird.

902
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:21,230
It's weird to have rumors with me but okay with Han Seo Jun?

903
01:07:21,230 --> 01:07:22,650
That's not what I mean.

904
01:07:22,650 --> 01:07:26,730
If you have to do it together, quit work too.

905
01:07:26,730 --> 01:07:28,000
Why do I have to?

906
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:32,760
Because I don't like it. I don't like you guys talking and bumping into each other all the time.

907
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:34,960
Why are you venting at me that you guys are not getting along?

908
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:38,570
So why are you always together when you know we don't get along?

909
01:07:38,570 --> 01:07:41,760
If you don't like it, I can't work or meet friends?

910
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:44,320
Then can you not do anything that I don't like?

911
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:46,110
Can you abandon all your friends and things?

912
01:07:46,110 --> 01:07:48,050
What if I can?

913
01:07:48,990 --> 01:07:51,720
Lucky you that it's so easy for you.

914
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:59,290
Then what if I say that it's hard to reveal that we're dating

915
01:07:59,290 --> 01:08:03,360
and I can't quit work?

916
01:08:03,360 --> 01:08:05,090
What?

917
01:08:05,090 --> 01:08:08,140
Then can we not see each other?

918
01:08:08,140 --> 01:08:10,560
What do you mean by that?

919
01:08:14,460 --> 01:08:17,600
Im Ju Gyeong! Im Ju Gyeong!

You know those newbies from Move debuted today.

935
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:52,640
But their title song changed.

936
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:55,020
It's totally different from the teaser they released last time.

937
01:09:55,020 --> 01:09:57,230
Really? What is it?

938

01:10:02,540 --> 01:10:04,660
They're so cool.

941
01:10:04,660 --> 01:10:06,630

♫  In your place where I've stayed up a long night  ♫

944
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:32,690
 The customer is not— 

945
01:10:40,770 --> 01:10:42,900
You look cold and chic. It's good.

946
01:10:42,900 --> 01:10:44,630
Okay. Two.

947
01:10:44,630 --> 01:10:47,100
Good. Three.

948
01:10:47,100 --> 01:10:48,710
Good.

949
01:10:48,710 --> 01:10:50,490
This is good.

950
01:10:50,490 --> 01:10:52,790
Two.

951
01:10:52,790 --> 01:10:53,820
Good.

952
01:10:53,820 --> 01:10:57,600
♫  A sky colored violet  ♫

953
01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:00,200
Seo Jun, that's nice!

954
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:06,900
♫  A night getting colder  in the mournful wind  ♫

955
01:11:07,690 --> 01:11:10,260
What's this?

956
01:11:10,300 --> 01:11:13,420
♫  The familiar memories etched on my heart ♫

957
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:18,450
What is it? Where are you going? Han Seo Jun!

958
01:11:23,930 --> 01:11:26,660
- What is it? 
- The CEO is in, right?

959
01:11:27,950 --> 01:11:28,930
Yes, I understand.

960
01:11:28,930 --> 01:11:31,130
- Chairman.
 - What is it

961
01:11:31,130 --> 01:11:33,360
Did you have to got this far?

962
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:36,800
-  Assistant Manager Im, what are you doing?
 - I'm sure you didn't want it.

963
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:40,640
Se Yeon's name being brought up again.

964
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:45,540
But still, just to cover your embarrassment, you're stealing songs?

965
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:48,660
What is she talking about?

966
01:11:48,660 --> 01:11:50,700
It's nothing.

967
01:11:52,260 --> 01:11:55,030
You think the CEO will care about every newbie?

968
01:11:55,030 --> 01:11:56,520
Come out. Come out and talk with me.

969
01:11:56,520 --> 01:11:59,920
Let go. I said let go!

970
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:15,640
You released Se Yeon's school violence news just to cover up one picture of you and a young actress.

971
01:12:15,640 --> 01:12:20,890
If you felt even a drop of guilt, then you shouldn't have  gone this far.

972
01:12:20,890 --> 01:12:25,560
Even if it's not copyrighted, this is an obvious plagiarism.

973
01:12:26,490 --> 01:12:31,070
How dare you come here and give me bullshit?

974
01:12:31,070 --> 01:12:33,270
Take her out immediately.

975
01:12:33,270 --> 01:12:34,230
Get out!

976
01:12:34,230 --> 01:12:37,590
Se Yeon and Leo are only 18.

977
01:12:37,590 --> 01:12:39,760
You have a son too.

978
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:42,780
If you're even a little bit sorry to the kids like your son,

979
01:12:42,780 --> 01:12:46,170
you should take down the song and fix it.

980
01:12:46,170 --> 01:12:51,630
It'll look better for you to resolve it than me whistleblowing.

981
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:59,650
So are you threatening me?

982
01:12:59,650 --> 01:13:01,970
Think as you wish.

983
01:13:01,970 --> 01:13:04,300
I'm risking my job to tell you this.

984
01:13:04,300 --> 01:13:06,030
Get out. Are you crazy?

985
01:13:06,030 --> 01:13:08,990
I will get out myself.

986
01:13:25,270 --> 01:13:27,220
Su Ho.

987
01:13:30,540 --> 01:13:32,330
Su Ho.

988
01:14:01,070 --> 01:14:02,790
Lee Su Ho!

989
01:14:02,790 --> 01:14:07,090
Did you hear it too? The new song from Move.

990
01:14:07,090 --> 01:14:09,530
That bastard. Hey!

991
01:14:09,530 --> 01:14:11,870
Lee Su Ho!

992
01:14:42,260 --> 01:14:49,290


993

♫  A sky colored violet  ♫

♫  The night filled again with you  ♫

997
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:21,130
 True Beauty 

998
01:15:21,130 --> 01:15:23,850
 Why do I look like this? 

999
01:15:23,850 --> 01:15:26,350
 Why do things keep getting messed up? 

1000
01:15:26,350 --> 01:15:29,250
 Why do I hurt people? 

1001
01:15:30,150 --> 01:15:32,930
 There is a girl named Im Ju Gyeong at your school. 

1002
01:15:32,930 --> 01:15:34,070
 Why did you do that? 

1003
01:15:34,070 --> 01:15:35,370
 Just because of such a mere thing?  

1004
01:15:35,370 --> 01:15:38,050
 - Su Ho! 
 - Do you know how painful and difficult it was for me? 

1005
01:15:38,050 --> 01:15:40,920
 I came to give you a hug. 

1006
01:15:40,920 --> 01:15:44,170
 Why didn't you tell me back then? 

1007
01:15:44,170 --> 01:15:47,390
 Im Ju Gyeong! She transferred from Yongpa High. 

1008
01:15:47,390 --> 01:15:54,260
♫  Because when I close my eyes, you are distinct  ♫
