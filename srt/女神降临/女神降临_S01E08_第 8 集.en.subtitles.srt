1
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:06,024
Excuse me.

2
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,320
BASED ON WEBTOON TRUE BEAUTY
BY YAONGYI

3
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,159
Thank you, sir.

4
00:01:16,826 --> 00:01:17,702
It’s my pleasure.

5
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:25,502
Miss!

6
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:27,921
Where have you been all alone?

7
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:30,507
I've been looking for you everywhere.
Come on, let's go.

8
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:38,556
Young Master!

9
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:41,810
Do you know that woman's name?

10
00:01:42,685 --> 00:01:43,895
Judging from her servant,

11
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:46,147
I believe that's the daughter
of the Lim family.

12
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:48,483
The daughter of the Lim family, you say.

13
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:52,153
Her hands looked soft and smooth as silk.

14
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:54,447
Imagine how lovely her face must be.

15
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:58,952
I must write a love letter.

16
00:01:59,035 --> 00:02:00,453
A love letter?

17
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:14,509
Welcome.

18
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:17,929
I'd like to see the items
from this end to that end.

19
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:19,055
All of them.

20
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,015
All of these?

21
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:22,725
Yes, all of them.

22
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,769
-Looking for a birthday gift?
-No.

23
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:27,981
I have to ask someone out right away.

24
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:32,277
Tell her how I feel.

25
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,238
GOING TO ASK HER OUT RIGHT AWAY

26
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,659
So you're saying

27
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:43,454
those two guys are friends
who fell for the same girl?

28
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:44,581
That's right.

29
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:47,208
But that one liked her first.

30
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:50,003
He told the other one she was his
and not to approach her.

31
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:53,214
What? Then why is he doing all that now?

32
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:55,675
Didn't he approach her for revenge?

33
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:59,429
He supposedly fell in love one day,
and that's why he's being clingy.

34
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:00,555
He's a total jerk.

35
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:04,767
It's not a crime to fall in love, is it?

36
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:07,562
NOT A CRIME TO FALL IN LOVE

37
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:11,608
Whatever.
Take your underwear and go to your room.

38
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:17,530
All right.

39
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,409
This one, and this one…

40
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,371
Stop buying so much makeup!

41
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:26,456
How dare you.

42
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:29,834
You're in trouble now.

43
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:31,836
Your secret will soon be out
on a school trip.

44
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:35,173
I'm going to be the last to fall asleep.

45
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:38,218
I'll shower after everyone's asleep,
then put my makeup back on.

46
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:40,970
What painstaking effort
to hide your bare face.

47
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:45,516
Why were you punching the doll?
Did Soo-ho dump you?

48
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,020
What are you on about?
I didn't get dumped.

49
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:50,939
I thought you liked Soo-ho.

50
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,274
We're just friends.

51
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:54,859
Okay, sure.

52
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:59,322
The girls I was good friends with
always ended up asking me out.

53
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:01,950
Something about developing
deeper feelings and so on.

54
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:05,995
Don't lose both friendship and love, okay?

55
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:20,593
I could have taken the bus here.

56
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:22,387
No, your bags are heavy.

57
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:24,305
Thanks, Hee…

58
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:26,766
-I said, thanks.
-Sure.

59
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:28,518
-I'll be off then.
-Bye.

60
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:31,729
-Listen to your teacher!
-Got it!

61
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,070
Jun-woo.

62
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:42,448
Jun-woo!

63
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:48,663
What are you doing?

64
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:51,040
I have some debt.

65
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:53,543
A debt? How much?

66
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:55,503
Did you borrow from loan sharks?

67
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:59,340
-I took out a student loan…
-A student loan.

68
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:02,844
Wait, how old are you?

69
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:04,929
I was born in 1990.

70
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:06,806
-Early 1990.
-1990.

71
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:18,818
All I've been able to save until now
is this paltry sum.

72
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:29,120
I'm sure you're disappointed.

73
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:32,081
This is why I didn't want to date--

74
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:37,628
All the blood, sweat, and tears you shed
struggling to save money are all in here.

75
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:39,672
It's not paltry, no matter the amount.

76
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:41,507
Hee-kyung.

77
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:45,178
Let me get by you.

78
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:50,224
Jun-woo,

79
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:54,312
please sit here.

80
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:05,198
I bought these on my business trip
because you came to mind.

81
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:07,158
They fit you perfectly.

82
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:09,160
I wanted you to wear these and come to me.

83
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:14,082
I'll be good to you.
Come to me and be my man, Han Jun-woo.

84
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:19,128
Hee-kyung!

85
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:23,341
I forgot my phone.

86
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,260
-Good morning!
-Hi.

87
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:29,639
-What is it?
-I forgot my phone.

88
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:31,682
Jeez. You're so clumsy.

89
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:33,601
Why did you leave it?

90
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:35,061
-Do it properly!
-Mom!

91
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:37,021
-I'm sorry, Mom!
-I'm sorry, Mom!

92
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:38,439
Open the lid. Let's go.

93
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:41,150
-These are just some snacks.
-That's a likely story.

94
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:43,194
Is this how they package
snacks these days?

95
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:44,278
Go!

96
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:47,824
Do you want some?

97
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:50,284
You must be thirsty.
Would you like to down a bottle?

98
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:52,537
I'm sorry.

99
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:55,081
-Isn't it cold?
-What's in your chest?

100
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:56,499
Open it up. Go on!

101
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:59,252
You brats are being ridiculous!

102
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:00,336
Go over there!

103
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:02,672
Are you guys bartenders?

104
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:04,841
-Why do you carry all these drinks?
-Mr. Han.

105
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:07,468
-Hope you have a safe trip.
-Thank you.

106
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:11,264
You look cute.

107
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:13,433
They're so annoying.

108
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:15,226
I should get a girlfriend too.

109
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:18,563
Hey, if that were up to you,
how come you never had a girlfriend?

110
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:20,857
What's with the hat?
Trying to be a vagabond?

111
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,984
That's why you don't have a girlfriend.

112
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:26,446
-Okay, make a heart.
-What the heck? They're also a thing?

113
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:27,530
What's going on?

114
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:29,073
You two have matching outfits.

115
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:31,742
Are you going to surprise us
with news that you're dating?

116
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:34,078
Not at all!

117
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:36,330
Ju-kyung, this looks calculated.

118
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:38,416
Do you want to be my girlfriend that much?

119
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:40,877
-Then how about we start dating?
-What's wrong with you?

120
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,129
-Put on your jacket already.
-It's hot. I don't want to.

121
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:44,422
It's not hot, it's cold.

122
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:45,840
-I'm healthy. I'm fine.
-They're cute.

123
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:48,009
I could draw on some stripes.
It'll be quick.

124
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:49,552
Hey, Soo-ho, you're here.

125
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:02,607
-Sit here.
-What?

126
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,108
Soo-ho, you sat in the front.

127
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:05,151
I'll sit next to you.

128
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,655
Double o seven, bang!

129
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:12,575
Double o seven--

130
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:16,245
-Bang!
-Time out.

131
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:20,666
Are you sitting together
because you two are an item?

132
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,503
-Date!
-Date!

133
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:26,339
-Date!
-Date!

134
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:28,341
There are plenty of seats in the front.

135
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:29,592
I prefer the back seats.

136
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:38,976
SAEBOM HIGH SCHOOL
SCHOOL TRIP

137
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,942
Junior class five, look here.
One, two, three!

138
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:49,654
Get settled in the tents
assigned to your groups.

139
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:51,656
-Okay.
-We'll meet back here in 30 minutes.

140
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:53,241
-Okay!
-Okay!

141
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:58,371
Ju-kyung.

142
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:03,584
-Su-ah!
-One, two, three!

143
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:05,795
One, two, three.

144
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:08,756
One, two, three.

145
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:10,132
One, two, three.

146
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:12,134
One, two, three.

147
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,637
-All right, it came out well.
-Let's go.

148
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:16,973
My bag is so heavy.

149
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:22,603
Gosh, just the youngsters' coming
has changed the air around here.

150
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:24,355
-Hello
-Hello.

151
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:26,691
Welcome.

152
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:29,569
I'm the site manager here.
Let me know if you need anything.

153
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:30,945
Thank you.

154
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:33,030
By the way, your pet bird is so pretty.

155
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:33,948
Sorry?

156
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:36,242
That bird?

157
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:39,870
-What bird?
-That bird.

158
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,125
The…

159
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:45,501
That bird.

160
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:52,508
What's that mic for?

161
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:53,426
This?

162
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:55,386
I brought this to stay up all night long!

163
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:58,472
Dating is a must
Marriage is an option

00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:03,102
-She's in the mood to party.
-Guys, tonight…

166
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:06,188
-nobody is sleeping!
-Nobody is sleeping

167
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:09,275
-Dating is a must!
-Must!

168
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:11,736
This is my first time sleeping in a tent.

169
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:13,154
It's been a while for me too.

170
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:16,032
My last time was with Soo-ho's family
when I was younger.

171
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:20,036
I see you've been really close with him
since you were young.

172
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:22,288
That reminds me.

173
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:27,627
A girl from class six asked Soo-ho out,
but he rejected her for someone else.

174
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:30,588
Are you serious?
Lee Soo-ho has someone else?

175
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:31,505
What?

176
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:34,884
Isn't that person you, Kangsu?

177
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:37,803
You bought that?
It probably was just an excuse.

178
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:40,348
-You're always trying to set people up.
-Come on.

179
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:43,225
There were a ton of rumors about you two
since freshman year.

180
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,061
You two look perfect for each other.

181
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:47,521
How can you two just stay friends
for ten long years?

182
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:49,523
Tell us, Kangsu.

183
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:53,069
You've never thought of him
as more than a friend even for a second?

184
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:59,158
-What are you talking about?
-You never have?

185
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:01,118
Really?

186
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:02,620
Gosh, it tickles!

187
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:07,708
Hey guys, look over here!

188
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,752
Make ugly faces except me.
We'll take turns.

189
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:12,296
-All right.
-One, two, three.

190
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:14,423
One, two…

191
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:15,883
Are you kidding? Don't try me.

192
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:17,218
-Seriously.
-Hey, come on.

193
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:18,969
If you do that again…

194
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:21,347
-Do it right.
-Make faces properly!

195
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:24,350
Guys, let's change the background.

196
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:28,396
-One, two, three!
-Hey, kids!

197
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:30,189
Gather here. I'll take your pictures.

198
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:31,941
-Okay!
-Okay!

199
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:34,318
Please make my legs look longer.

200
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,405
Soo-ho, get in there.

201
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:39,156
-I'm good.
-Okay, then.

202
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,160
You have no social skills whatsoever.

203
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:45,037
Why don't you join them?

204
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:47,123
I'm good. It's a hassle.

205
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:49,250
-Here we go.
-Okay!

206
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:52,086
One, two, three, four.

207
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:55,339
-What was that?
-Come on. What's with the "four"?

208
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:57,007
-I closed my eyes!
-It'll look more natural.

209
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:58,717
-What the heck?
-Sir!

210
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:00,428
Take a picture of this couple here.

211
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:07,852
Hey! Who's dating in school?

212
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:10,354
-It's not like that.
-If I catch you doing anything…

213
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:12,440
-They're dating.
-You're caught in the picture, sir.

214
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:16,402
-Let's make hearts!
-Here we go.

215
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:19,280
-Okay!
-One, two! I took it.

216
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:22,074
-Take a good one!
-Come on!

217
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:24,160
What's going on? Are you really a couple?

218
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,620
You two are dating, right?
These guys are going out!

219
00:12:27,746 --> 00:12:28,706
It's not like that.

220
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:30,416
Hey, take your T-shirt off.

221
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:33,085
Why are you trying to take my clothes off?
Someone's naughty.

222
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:35,379
I meant, change your clothes!

223
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:43,637
A witty star in recreation sessions,
Mr. Wit will be your host today. Welcome!

224
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:46,307
The newspaper game. You know it, right?

225
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,392
-Yes!
-Four people make a team.

226
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:51,896
The important thing is to choose someone
who's good or that you really like.

227
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:53,230
Make groups of four!

228
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:54,815
That's right. Form groups.

229
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:57,109
Someone you are interested in…

230
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:59,361
Ju-kyung! Come here!

231
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,530
If you don't like someone,
kick them out of your group.

232
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,407
That's it. It must be a group of four.

233
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:05,117
Three? No. Five? No way.

234
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:08,746
-Go on.
-If you got five, kick someone out.

235
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:12,082
-Show your determination.
-You're leaving your girlfriend?

236
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,334
Four people per group.

237
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:15,294
Is there a loner? All right.

238
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:16,795
-Come here.
-Everyone in groups of four?

239
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:18,047
-Yes!
-Yes!

240
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,423
Everyone is in groups.

241
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:20,633
-What's that?
-What's he doing?

242
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:23,135
All right, then.

243
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:26,680
What did I say?

244
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:29,183
All right, let me explain
the rules of the game.

245
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:32,353
You will fold the newspaper,
and everyone has to stand on it.

246
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:34,480
You succeed if you can hold
for five seconds.

247
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:37,149
Everyone get on it.
Go stand on the newspaper.

248
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:39,109
First place is ours. Hold on tight.

249
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:41,904
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

250
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:44,490
Are your feet on the newspaper?

251
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:47,076
Your feet cannot be outside the newspaper.

252
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,370
-Hey!
-Do it right!

253
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:51,247
Hey, Su-ah, this isn't right.

254
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,706
Go, team!

255
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,959
Let's begin the countdown. One.

256
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:56,460
Two.

257
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:59,380
-Hey, hold on!
-Three.

258
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:07,221
Give a round of applause
to the last three teams!

259
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:10,349
You're good. So passionate. I love it.

260
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:11,267
What's important…

261
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,560
Okay, focus.

262
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:15,437
Since these teams are way too good,
let's upgrade it.

263
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:16,689
It will be harder.

264
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:20,609
Fold the newspaper into its quarter size.

265
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,653
Three teams. Don't complain and fold it.

266
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:25,781
Let's try our best now. Fold the papers.

267
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:28,450
-What are you doing, Hyun-kyu?
-Look at that!

268
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:32,496
Where are you going?

269
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:40,963
I don't want to lose to them. Get on.

270
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:43,591
One, two, three!

271
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:46,927
That's not right.

272
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:52,099
That student is awesome.

273
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:53,809
He's carrying her.

274
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:04,069
I'm going to start the countdown.

275
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:08,908
Five, four, three, two, one!

276
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:10,743
The team of boys is out!

277
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:12,494
Two teams made it.

278
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:14,788
They both are doing well,
but we need a winner.

279
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:17,625
The first team to fall will lose the game.

280
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:20,002
Are you ready? Guys, lift one leg up.

281
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:22,046
Can we just keep it down? I can't do it.

282
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:23,964
Lift one leg, please. Let's go!

283
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:25,716
I'll count down as soon as you lift.

284
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:28,427
Lift your legs. Five, four, three…

285
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,887
Your hair smells like poop, Hyun-kyu!

286
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:33,182
…two, one! Out!

287
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:35,351
Gosh, that was very odd!

288
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:37,478
Wash your hair!

289
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:39,813
We won!

290
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:42,399
Take your prize!
Congratulations! Good job.

291
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:44,568
-You did great.
-It hurts here.

292
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:46,820
-Where do you mean?
-Right here!

293
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:53,452
You've never thought of him
as more than a friend even for a second?

294
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:58,666
It's a sign for a restricted area.

295
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:01,043
-Hey, isn't it a little creepy here?
-He's talking.

296
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:02,795
You're a chicken for such a big guy.

297
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:05,172
-Not there!
-My goodness.

298
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,177
You can never go this way.

299
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,930
-Why? Is there something in the forest?
-Why is that?

300
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:15,933
I can't lose any more men.

301
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:18,435
-Excuse me?
-What men?

302
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:20,396
Over there…

303
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:23,482
Never mind.

304
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:25,859
Pretend I never mentioned it.

305
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:29,530
Anyway, don't ever go that way. Okay?

306
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:31,407
-Got it?
-Okay.

307
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:34,535
-Yes?
-Yes!

308
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:39,206
What is this place?

309
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:41,333
-Hey…
-I'm so curious.

310
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:42,376
Let's not go there.

311
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:45,170
-No, I'm curious.
-Let's leave.

312
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:48,882
Nobody's buying them.

313
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:51,051
Stop pressuring customers and go home!

314
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:53,554
What about the leftover ones?

315
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:55,514
I could arrange your funeral to use them!

316
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:58,225
Do whatever, or throw them away!

317
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:14,033
PRINCE COMICS

PAY AND HOURS NEGOTIABLE

319
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,553
No scented candle has been this good.

320
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:36,388
Is it perfume or a scented candle?

321
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:39,016
-I'm not buying.
-I'm just giving it to you.

322
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:41,435
Please leave if you're here
to talk about the treasure ship.

323
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:43,520
The proudest moment in my life

324
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:46,982
is not falling for it when you asked me
to invest in the treasure ship.

325
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:50,194
Hey, let's not dwell on the past.

326
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:53,530
Well, actually…

327
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:55,866
Here, well…

328
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:58,243
The weekend part-time position…

329
00:17:58,327 --> 00:17:59,870
Can I please take it?

330
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:00,788
The part-time job?

331
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:02,456
I found someone.

332
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:03,874
Already?

333
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:05,542
All right, then.

334
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:09,755
Is that good?

335
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:13,258
Then give me just one bite.

336
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,471
Gosh, what are you doing now?

337
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:19,848
-Just a bite!
-Seriously.

338
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:25,020
-Hey, do you want this?
-Put more on.

339
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:27,064
It's good.

340
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,608
Hey, Kim Si-hyun.

341
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,236
-What is it?
-What is it?

342
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:34,780
I'm sorry about the smell earlier.

343
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:36,698
I washed my hair after.

344
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:38,117
Enjoy.

345
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,368
He has a conscience.

346
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:40,702
Hey, Hyun-kyu.

347
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:43,288
It wasn't that bad.

348
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:45,791
-Don't lie!
-You said it smelled awful!

349
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:48,210
-Right?
-What's going on with her?

350
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:51,088
What's this smell?

351
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:52,798
Put it here.

352
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:54,341
-Have some mushrooms.
-Thank you!

353
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:56,969
-Let me know if you need anything else.
-Okay. Thank you!

354
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:58,679
-Enjoy your meal!
-Enjoy your meal!

355
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:02,266
It's drenched in his body odor.

356
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:05,936
Come on.

357
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:08,772
It's not as if she's
some precious museum artifact.

358
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:10,774
Is she a gothic celadon or something?

359
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:11,817
It's Goryeo celadon.

360
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:15,821
What I'm saying is,
when are you going to make a move?

361
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:18,157
I'll set the tone,
so tease out how she feels.

362
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,325
-And ask her right---
-Try this.

363
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:27,875
-Make a wrap with a perilla leaf.
-Try this one.

364
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,670
-Super tasty!
-It's good!

365
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:33,297
Are you an animal?

366
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,132
Let it cook before you eat it!

367
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:37,384
Don't eat like a pig
just because you're eating pork.

368
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:40,012
-Eat like a person.
-Sir, I am a person.

369
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:41,471
Are you enjoying your dinner?

370
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:42,848
-Yes!
-Yes!

371
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:44,808
Okay, let me check your fire.

372
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:46,351
It looks good, yes.

373
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:47,436
By the way, sir.

374
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,938
What were you going to tell us earlier?

375
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:51,732
That?

376
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:53,025
That's just some old tale.

377
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:54,818
What is it about? Tell us, please!

378
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:57,362
It's nothing special.
Don't get hung up on it.

379
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:59,865
-Tell us!
-Please!

380
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:02,534
All right then. I guess I'll tell you.

381
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:08,665
Listen up.

382
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:09,666
-All right.
-Yes.

383
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:11,543
A long time ago,

384
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:15,631
there was a well in the forest over there.

385
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:22,429
My wife,

386
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,348
we're now man and wife.

387
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:26,058
Why do you still cover your face?

388
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:28,352
It's because I am embarrassed.

389
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:29,895
What to do with such a shy wife?

390
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:35,776
The rooster will cry
before we consummate our marriage.

391
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:38,862
Please answer this one question then.

392
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:44,409
My husband, would you like an apricot
that looks delicious but is fake?

393
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:46,662
However good it looks,
one cannot eat a fake apricot.

394
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:49,414
It is said that one should not judge
a book by its cover.

395
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:51,750
But why do you ask?

396
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:55,128
Enough about fake apricots.

397
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:56,838
Come here.

398
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:58,340
Don't be shy,

399
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:00,175
and show me your face.

400
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:02,010
Then…

401
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:04,471
don't be alarmed.

402
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:15,691
-Husband!
-Is this why you hid your face?

403
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:18,694
You said you wouldn't judge
a book by its cover.

404
00:21:20,153 --> 00:21:21,989
-Husband!
-Let go of me!

405
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:23,991
-Where are you going?
-Let go!

406
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:26,243
Sun-dol!

407
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:28,328
-Husband!
-Let go! Sun-dol!

408
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:38,171
Being born ugly,

409
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:41,591
I never got to experience the joy
of being loved by my dear husband.

410
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:45,679
My life

411
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:49,725
is worse than that of a fake apricot.

412
00:21:57,399 --> 00:22:02,529
What do you like about me so much
that you follow me everywhere?

413
00:22:02,612 --> 00:22:05,824
I like your broad chest, sir!

414
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:10,037
What are you talking about?
I like your rock-hard calves, sir.

415
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,955
They are fine indeed.
I like everything about you.

416
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:14,333
Goodness, that's lovely to hear!

417
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:18,128
Then, let's have fun tonight
until the sun comes up!

418
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:20,339
-Sounds great!
-Sounds great, sir!

419
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:29,681
The woman who died in resentment

420
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:32,476
became the Ugly Ghost
and wanders around at night.

421
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,102
When she comes across someone,

422
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,813
she steals their face away.

423
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:40,317
So people in this area
never go near there at night.

424
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:43,028
Some people went missing,

425
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:46,615
so we had a shaman perform a service
to soothe the Ugly Ghost by the well.

426
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,913
There's no such thing as a ghost
that steals people's faces.

427
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:54,581
I can't even pretend to be scared.

428
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:56,917
Is that why you warned us
not to go to the forest?

429
00:22:57,501 --> 00:23:00,962
But she only steals the faces
of good-looking people.

430
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:04,883
So use your good judgment
and don't wander around alone.

431
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:06,343
Got it? Yes?

432
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:09,221
It'll be night soon.

433
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:12,015
Don't you worry.

434
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:13,934
You all should be perfectly fine.

435
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:17,395
-But sir!
-Come on.

436
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:21,233
-Except me, you all are…
-Stay together and hold hands, okay?

437
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:23,276
THE LATE JEONG SE-YEON
TRIBUTE ALBUM PROJECT

438
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,945
SE-YEON AND LEO'S LONGING LOVE

439
00:23:35,413 --> 00:23:36,373
Nice to meet you.

440
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,668
I'm Lim Hee-kyung
from Move Entertainment's Planning Team.

441
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:42,754
By the way, have we met somewhere…

442
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:44,047
I don't think so.

443
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:45,006
Right?

444
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:47,050
I must be mistaken.

445
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:48,677
What do you want?

446
00:23:50,428 --> 00:23:51,847
I'll get straight to the point.

447
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:54,266
On the first anniversary
of Jeong Se-yeon's passing,

448
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:57,352
the company plans to release
a tribute album with his unreleased songs.

449
00:23:57,978 --> 00:24:01,022
But most of the songs Mr. Jeong left

450
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:05,402
are collaborative works
with someone called Leo.

451
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:10,240
Do you know how hard we tried to find you?
You are Leo, aren't you, Mr. Han?

452
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:13,285
No, I'm not.

453
00:24:15,078 --> 00:24:16,538
Do you want to keep it a secret?

454
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:19,499
Whether you believe me is up to you.

455
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:22,043
But this is a joke.

456
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:24,379
As soon as the bullying rumors surfaced,

457
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:27,090
you kicked him out
and made him take his own life.

458
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:28,717
And now you want to do this?

459
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:35,015
Move Entertainment won't be releasing
a tribute album for him.

460
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:37,392
I will make sure…

461
00:24:38,476 --> 00:24:40,604
that no such thing happens,
no matter what.

462
00:24:52,532 --> 00:24:54,951
How do I convince him otherwise?

463
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:04,461
Hey.

464
00:25:04,544 --> 00:25:07,297
Hey, I'm home alone.
When are you coming home?

465
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:10,675
Let the game begin.

466
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:14,221
You have 30 minutes.
Order some fried chicken.

467
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:16,723
Whether to eat it or not is up to you.

468
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:19,976
Come on. Cut it out.

469
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:27,025
-Good evening, Mr. Lee.
-I appreciate your hard work at this hour.

470
00:25:27,108 --> 00:25:28,985
Not at all. Did you have dinner yet?

471
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:30,362
No, not yet.

472
00:25:30,445 --> 00:25:32,489
Mr. Oh, how do you feel
about fried chicken?

473
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,824
The choice is up to you.

474
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:36,243
It sounds good to me.

475
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:37,702
You looked so sheepish.

476
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:40,205
-Did our playing along amuse you?
-Thank you, sir.

477
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:43,625
By the way, I met Mr. Han Seo-jun.

478
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:45,210
Is that right?

479
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:48,171
But he denied being Leo
and rejected my proposal on the spot.

480
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:51,383
He was a friend of Se-yeon,
so he'd have animosity toward us.

481
00:25:51,466 --> 00:25:54,302
The thing is,
it's a shame to let this project go.

482
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:57,472
His talent for writing songs
is too good not to be put to use.

483
00:25:57,555 --> 00:26:00,517
-I'll try again to persuade him.
-I admire your passion.

484
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:04,562
Please keep up that mindset
and take good care of our rookies.

485
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:05,647
Of course.

486
00:26:06,147 --> 00:26:08,316
-Take care.
-Yes. Thank you, sir.

487
00:26:10,568 --> 00:26:11,528
Fried chicken!

488
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:15,532
About the tribute album,
were we still working on it?

489
00:26:16,449 --> 00:26:18,285
I thought my not green-lighting it
would kill it.

490
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:20,245
I guess she was working on it by herself.

491
00:26:20,328 --> 00:26:21,955
I'll take care of it.

492
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:23,415
Okay.

493
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:27,377
Hello? Hee-kyung?

494
00:26:28,336 --> 00:26:30,422
No, the other teachers are sleeping.

495
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:32,716
How come you're not asleep?

496
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:35,552
Were you thinking about me?

497
00:26:35,635 --> 00:26:38,096
I actually have trouble sleeping
in unfamiliar places.

498
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:40,724
Shall I sing you a lullaby?

499
00:26:40,807 --> 00:26:42,350
No, I'm good. I'll go to bed now.

500
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:44,894
-Sleep tight.
-I love you

501
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:49,816
I love you, I love you

502
00:26:50,525 --> 00:26:53,361
I love you, I love you

503
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:55,030
-"I love you"?
-"I love you"?

504
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:56,031
"I love you"?

505
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:58,908
Mother, are you at karaoke?

506
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:00,618
You're dating someone, aren't you?

507
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:02,078
No!

508
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:04,581
I'm sorry.

509
00:27:04,664 --> 00:27:07,042
-Good night.
-Good night.

510
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:12,422
I love you!

511
00:27:12,505 --> 00:27:14,674
Gosh, I've lost my appetite.

512
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:21,473
I love you, I love you, I love you

513
00:27:21,556 --> 00:27:23,475
-Everybody, scream!
-Come on, stop!

514
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:27,145
-Hyun-kyu, you've shat your pants before.
-Are you joking? No.

515
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:29,981
-Okay!
-Hold him down!

516
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:31,274
-Hey, Si-hyun,
-So smelly.

517
00:27:31,858 --> 00:27:33,818
you think you're the prettiest
in the whole universe.

518
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:34,903
I do not!

519
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:39,824
Soo-ho, you've had your first kiss.

520
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:43,787
Three, two, one.

521
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:46,164
-You didn't answer!
-You need to answer fast.

522
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:48,166
-Answer the question.
-He's never played before.

523
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:51,461
Love or friendship?

524
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:54,631
Love.

525
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:58,259
You're so smarmy.

526
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:00,136
-Let's hit him for that!
-Get him!

527
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:02,138
-Hey, it's the truth.
-That was too much.

528
00:28:03,306 --> 00:28:04,933
-You think I'm handsome.
-Yes.

529
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:08,770
-Lies!
-Hit her a lot!

530
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:12,023
-Yoo Tae-hoon or ATEEN?
-Obviously my babe, Tae-hoon!

531
00:28:12,732 --> 00:28:13,775
-Truth!
-Su-ah!

532
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:16,361
-Let's hit both of them.
-I can't stand the sight.

533
00:28:16,444 --> 00:28:17,320
Beat them!

534
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:19,531
There's someone you like.

535
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:21,658
There is!

536
00:28:23,743 --> 00:28:25,870
-Lies.
-Are you serious?

537
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:28,873
-Liar!
-It's so childish!

538
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:33,795
You've thought about
breaking up with Su-ah.

539
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:36,548
Never.

540
00:28:41,636 --> 00:28:43,054
Next!

541
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:44,556
-Again.
-What?

542
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:47,726
-You've considered breaking up with me.
-No. I said, no!

543
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:51,563
See? I said, no.

544
00:28:51,646 --> 00:28:53,690
Again!
You've considered breaking up with me.

545
00:28:53,773 --> 00:28:54,607
Never!

546
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:57,110
No?

547
00:28:57,193 --> 00:28:58,903
I don't think so. I think you did.

548
00:28:58,987 --> 00:28:59,863
No.

549
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:02,657
-I see. You've had such thoughts then.
-No--

550
00:29:03,658 --> 00:29:05,493
We're done!

551
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:06,911
-Su-ah!
-Su-ah!

552
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:09,372
-Su-ah!
-Su-ah!

553
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:10,540
Su-ah!

554
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:13,501
I'm a girl.

555
00:29:19,674 --> 00:29:21,092
It works fine.

556
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:26,890
There's someone I like.

557
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:31,770
What?

558
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,897
It worked this time around.

559
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:38,318
Soo-ho.

560
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,487
When did you get here?

561
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:43,364
You could have let me know.

562
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:47,035
Excuse me.

563
00:29:48,536 --> 00:29:49,370
Ju-kyung.

564
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:51,623
What?

565
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:52,540
What is it?

566
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:53,458
I want you…

567
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:55,376
to come with me.

568
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:56,795
What?

569
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:01,216
Sure. Okay.

570
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:06,429
Is he upset about something?

571
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:09,015
What could it be?

572
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:18,566
Why were you avoiding me today?

573
00:30:19,275 --> 00:30:21,194
No, I wasn't avoiding you.

574
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:25,406
-Really?
-Yes, of course not.

575
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:28,827
Want to try the lie detector?

576
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:31,120
Well, I don't think it's reliable.

577
00:30:32,872 --> 00:30:33,957
Never mind, then.

578
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:38,586
Gosh, the forest path
looks even prettier at night.

579
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:44,092
There aren't any benches?

580
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:47,470
Goodness, there are so many stars!

581
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:50,390
Where?

582
00:30:50,473 --> 00:30:52,183
I guess it's pretty cloudy.

583
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:03,403
Well…

584
00:31:03,486 --> 00:31:06,906
You know how zombies jump out
from the bushes in movies, so…

585
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,199
Right.

586
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:13,746
So what were you going to say? Why are we…

587
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:16,124
Well…

588
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:19,335
-That is…
-What?

589
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:20,879
Look at that!

590
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:34,893
It's so pretty.

591
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:37,186
It's just like a picture.

592
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:40,356
Indeed.

593
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:50,241
Should I put some music on?

594
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:02,378
My battery's out.

595
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:03,755
I'll do it.

596
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:21,230
"STARLIGHT"

597
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:35,662
Gosh,

598
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:37,538
he's got a great voice.

599
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:39,290
Who is this?

600
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:41,626
Se-yeon.

601
00:32:46,005 --> 00:32:47,215
It's lovely.

602
00:32:49,008 --> 00:32:51,010
I don't think I've heard this song before.

603
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:54,973
It’s an unreleased song.

604
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:58,601
You're the first to hear it.

605
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:03,106
Really?

606
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:14,826
-I don't want to go!
-Let's go!

607
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:15,827
Where are you going?

608
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:17,954
He's going to go to catch the ghost.

609
00:33:18,037 --> 00:33:20,039
The man said
the ghost hangs out by the well.

610
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:22,125
If we film the paranormal activity
and upload it on NerTube,

611
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:23,793
-we'll get a ton of views, won't we?
-No.

612
00:33:23,876 --> 00:33:25,044
You should come with us.

613
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:27,255
I can't be bothered.

614
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:28,631
You guys go ahead.

615
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:31,217
Seo-jun,

616
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,136
are you scared of ghosts?

617
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:37,098
Where is the well?

618
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:43,021
-Han Seo-jun.
-Push him.

619
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:54,657
Sorry. I forgot you didn't like photos.

620
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:00,621
Why don't you like it though?

621
00:34:03,082 --> 00:34:04,083
When I was young,

622
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:06,669
I had a hard time
because of the paparazzi.

623
00:34:08,796 --> 00:34:10,214
No wonder you don't like it.

624
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:12,133
It must have been tiring.

625
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:15,928
Why didn't you take it?

626
00:34:16,971 --> 00:34:17,805
What?

627
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:31,027
Do you like taking pictures?

628
00:34:33,654 --> 00:34:35,865
I didn't before,

629
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:38,868
but after I started wearing makeup,

630
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:41,871
I grew to like it.

631
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:45,083
-You like it?
-Yes, I like it.

632
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,085
Do you like riding a boat?

633
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:50,505
Yes, I like it.

634
00:34:53,841 --> 00:34:54,801
Then…

635
00:34:55,843 --> 00:34:57,261
do you like listening to music?

636
00:34:57,345 --> 00:34:59,138
Of course, I like it.

637
00:35:08,731 --> 00:35:10,733
Do you want to take a picture with me?

638
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:46,144
Ju-kyung!

639
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:50,857
Hey guys, it's not too late…

640
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:55,194
-Hey, let go of me.
-These chickens.

641
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:57,029
Guys, there's literally nothing here.

642
00:35:57,113 --> 00:35:59,740
-Hey, I think something's there.
-There's no such thing.

643
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:01,159
Let's walk faster. Come on.

644
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:03,411
Hey, Seo-jun, hurry up!

645
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:05,621
What are they going on about?

646
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:08,749
I'm really sorry. It's all because of me.

647
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:13,504
By the way, is my makeup all washed away?

648
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:16,507
Yes.

649
00:36:19,218 --> 00:36:20,595
What do I do?

650
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:22,388
They can't see my face.

651
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:25,349
Do you want me to bring your makeup?

652
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:28,644
I have my underwear
and everything in my bag.

653
00:36:30,062 --> 00:36:32,899
It's okay, I'll just cover my face and go.

654
00:36:36,944 --> 00:36:39,071
-You must be freezing.
-It's all right.

655
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:40,907
I'm not cold at all.

656
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:49,040
You have to keep your body temperature.

657
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:52,335
Stop it, heart.

658
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:56,464
This isn't about romance.
It's about survival right now.

659
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:05,556
Su-jin.

660
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:14,357
Soo-ho?

661
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:19,779
What happened? Why are you soaking wet?

662
00:37:19,862 --> 00:37:22,073
-Did you fall into the water?
-I stumbled on the path.

663
00:37:22,156 --> 00:37:24,742
You should have been careful.
Are you okay?

664
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:25,701
Yes.

665
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:28,871
I heard you left with Ju-kyung…

666
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:30,957
-No, I didn't.
-Really?

667
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:35,628
What's that sound?

668
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:40,258
-Probably a wild boar.
-What?

669
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:42,843
-Let's go.
-Hey.

670
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:55,606
You go ahead.

671
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:58,109
-What about you?
-I need to find something.

672
00:37:58,901 --> 00:38:00,111
Wait, Soo-ho.

673
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:24,760
Everyone, the well is right there.

674
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:26,637
It is eerie, isn't it?

675
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,352
Stop it, dude.

676
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:35,855
Don't do that. It's not funny.

677
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:38,983
What's that?

678
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:41,944
-Stop messing around.
-I knew there was something.

679
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:42,862
Guys.

680
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:44,739
It's nothing.

681
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:48,617
Everyone, I heard a strange noise
coming from over there.

682
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:50,328
I'm going to take a look.

683
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:51,245
No…

684
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:09,972
They didn't recognize me, did they?
What do I do now?

685
00:39:11,307 --> 00:39:12,641
Hey, Cho-rong!

686
00:39:13,934 --> 00:39:14,769
Damn it.

687
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:18,731
Cho-rong. The well is here.

688
00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:21,484
Where did they all go?

689
00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:29,450
Where are they?

690
00:39:32,828 --> 00:39:34,705
Come on, leave already.

691
00:39:47,927 --> 00:39:48,928
Darn it.

692
00:40:00,022 --> 00:40:01,065
That was close.

693
00:40:09,698 --> 00:40:11,659
LEE SOO-HO: WHERE ARE YOU?
MISSED CALL, LEE SOO-HO

694
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:15,579
Why aren't you picking up? Where are you?

695
00:40:30,177 --> 00:40:32,304
Hey, I just got in.

696
00:40:50,906 --> 00:40:52,241
It's all wet.

697
00:41:08,757 --> 00:41:11,886
For a moment,
it was like being in a fairy tale.

698
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:17,183
But my reality is a horror story.

699
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:44,585
Limju, are you up already?

700
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:46,754
Yes. Of course, I'm up.

701
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:50,508
This girl even looks pretty
in the morning.

702
00:42:06,106 --> 00:42:09,610
Why am I being transferred
to the PR team all of a sudden?

703
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:11,403
It's not even that time of the year.

704
00:42:11,487 --> 00:42:12,655
Tell me about it.

705
00:42:12,738 --> 00:42:14,365
I just found out from the notice.

706
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:17,701
Then what about the projects
I've been working on?

707
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:19,370
Ms. Lim,

708
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:23,165
did you get on the wrong side
of the CEO or the upper management?

709
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:27,044
It's so weird that only you're being
transferred out of the blue.

710
00:42:27,127 --> 00:42:29,046
I didn't do anything wrong.

711
00:42:29,129 --> 00:42:30,506
And even if I did,

712
00:42:30,589 --> 00:42:32,967
can they just
throw their weight around like this?

713
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:34,802
Hey, kids.

714
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:36,679
What's the highlight of a school trip?

715
00:42:36,762 --> 00:42:38,514
-No honorifics!
-The food!

716
00:42:38,597 --> 00:42:41,809
-Talent show!
-Bibimbap!

717
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:43,477
The highlight of a school trip

718
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:44,853
is a treasure hunt.

719
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:47,189
-That's no fun.
-That's boring.

720
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:49,650
I hid things around every nook and corner,

721
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:52,111
so look around and find them.

722
00:42:52,194 --> 00:42:54,238
We're not in elementary school anymore!

723
00:42:54,321 --> 00:42:56,365
We're 18, not 8.

724
00:42:56,448 --> 00:42:57,658
-She's right.
-Totally.

725
00:42:57,741 --> 00:43:00,244
-Sir, I'm hungry!
-We might faint from hunger.

726
00:43:00,327 --> 00:43:01,161
All right.

727
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:03,539
The grand prize
is a 50,000 won gift voucher.

728
00:43:03,622 --> 00:43:04,999
-Did he say 50,000 won?
-50,000 won?

729
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:06,292
-We have to find it.
-50,000 won.

730
00:43:06,375 --> 00:43:08,419
Let's go!

731
00:43:13,048 --> 00:43:15,175
Sir, I don't feel so well.

732
00:43:15,801 --> 00:43:18,345
-Hey, let's hurry!
-50,000 won!

733
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:21,015
-I want to find it!
-I'm going to get it!

734
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:32,234
Ju-kyung.

735
00:43:33,736 --> 00:43:34,778
Are you feeling sick?

736
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:43,871
You're feverish.
Why didn't you say something?

737
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:55,341
-I found one!
-Me too!

738
00:43:57,176 --> 00:43:58,344
You call this treasure?

739
00:43:58,427 --> 00:43:59,553
Knowledge is power.

740
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:02,973
-Okay, 50,000 won is mine.
-Hey, that's my card!

741
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:03,891
I found one.

742
00:44:04,516 --> 00:44:05,976
-You found one?
-You found it?

743
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:07,686
Wait, I found one.

744
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:09,271
-You found one?
-Hey, hold on.

745
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:13,525
-You know the depth of love
-You know the depth of love

746
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:15,819
-only in the pain of separation.
-only in the pain of separation.

747
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:18,238
Goodness.

748
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:19,323
It's okay.

749
00:44:19,406 --> 00:44:21,325
-Move!
-Hey, where are you going?

750
00:44:22,534 --> 00:44:24,620
-Hey, wait!
-Hey!

751
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:27,539
I'll let you go over my dead body.

752
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:29,041
How can I possibly let you go?

753
00:44:29,124 --> 00:44:33,170
If you have to go, if you must go,
fix my heart, you dummy.

754
00:44:33,754 --> 00:44:36,173
Why mention your dead body?

755
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:40,344
Raise your hand if you love Choi Su-ah.

756
00:44:44,973 --> 00:44:46,934
Raise your hand
if you can't get over Choi Su-ah.

757
00:44:47,601 --> 00:44:49,812
Raise your hand
if you want Choi Su-ah back!

758
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:51,855
Babe!

759
00:45:03,992 --> 00:45:06,829
Wake up for a second.
I got you some medicine.

760
00:45:07,788 --> 00:45:08,831
Okay.

761
00:45:19,258 --> 00:45:20,843
How did you know?

762
00:45:29,101 --> 00:45:29,935
Take a nap.

763
00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:31,812
Thank you.

764
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:33,772
Don't be sick.

765
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:36,650
I hate it when people get sick.

766
00:45:47,494 --> 00:45:49,037
Soo-ho, did you find anything?

767
00:45:49,121 --> 00:45:51,331
Hey Soo-ho, I found the grand prize.

768
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:52,499
Have you seen Ju-kyung?

769
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:55,419
Ju-kyung?

770
00:46:51,767 --> 00:46:52,726
You'll wake her up.

771
00:46:53,393 --> 00:46:54,603
Let go.

772
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:56,522
What if I say no?

773
00:46:58,607 --> 00:46:59,816
Get out.

774
00:47:31,139 --> 00:47:32,558
What? Are they fighting?

775
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:34,685
You call yourself a human?

776
00:47:34,768 --> 00:47:36,895
Get your eyes checked.
What else do I look like?

777
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:39,773
You knew I liked her!

778
00:47:39,856 --> 00:47:42,276
Is it first come, first served?
So what if you liked her first?

779
00:47:44,069 --> 00:47:45,070
Are they fighting for real?

780
00:47:45,153 --> 00:47:47,281
-Why does it have to be Lim Ju-kyung?
-I have no idea!

781
00:47:47,364 --> 00:47:48,198
Why it has to be her.

782
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:50,909
-Give her up!
-Why should I?

783
00:47:51,493 --> 00:47:52,911
What matters is how she feels.

784
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:00,460
I said, give her up.

785
00:48:02,921 --> 00:48:04,548
That's not something I can control.

786
00:48:14,975 --> 00:48:18,061
Look at my eyebrows!
What are you going to do?

787
00:48:18,145 --> 00:48:20,439
I told you yesterday.

788
00:48:20,522 --> 00:48:23,358
If you go with a darker shade,
they'll look odd for a week.

789
00:48:23,442 --> 00:48:24,776
They will look natural soon.

790
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:27,237
People are saying
I look like a cartoon character!

791
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:29,740
Why should I stand
such comments at my age?

792
00:48:30,407 --> 00:48:31,992
I came all the way out to this ditch,

793
00:48:32,075 --> 00:48:33,910
but I should've just
gotten them done in Gangnam!

794
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:37,247
Give me a refund right away
and fix my eyebrows to how they were!

795
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:40,125
Then get them done in Gangnam
and not cause a scene in this ditch!

796
00:48:40,208 --> 00:48:41,752
How dare you talk to a customer…

797
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:55,349
What are you doing?
We're running a business here.

798
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:57,893
Look what she's done to my brows…

799
00:48:58,435 --> 00:48:59,811
sir.

800
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:03,899
Come visit us again
if they still look odd in one week.

801
00:49:04,691 --> 00:49:07,736
And if you ever mistreat Hyun-sook again,

802
00:49:08,904 --> 00:49:10,280
I won't let it slide.

803
00:49:21,124 --> 00:49:21,958
Are you all right?

804
00:49:24,544 --> 00:49:25,587
What did you say?

805
00:49:26,588 --> 00:49:27,589
Thank you.

806
00:49:29,174 --> 00:49:30,676
Did you say thank you?

807
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:33,387
Yes, that's what I said. So what?

808
00:49:34,971 --> 00:49:37,516
You just said thank you to me, right?

809
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:38,725
Because you're thankful?

810
00:49:49,736 --> 00:49:52,406
Is it first come, first served?
So what if you liked her first?

811
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:54,241
What matters is how she feels.

812
00:50:04,751 --> 00:50:06,128
Hey, how's this?

813
00:50:06,211 --> 00:50:07,087
What are you doing?

814
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:09,047
Did you make up with Su-ah?

815
00:50:09,131 --> 00:50:12,384
Ever heard, "You know the depth of love
only in the pain of separation"?

816
00:50:12,467 --> 00:50:14,010
I never knew my love ran so deep.

817
00:50:14,094 --> 00:50:16,054
Three, no, four stories deep…

818
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,515
You still haven't told her how you feel?

819
00:50:18,598 --> 00:50:19,891
Do it today if you can.

820
00:50:19,975 --> 00:50:22,769
Asking someone out works best
if you do it casually…

821
00:50:23,937 --> 00:50:25,397
in a special setting.

822
00:50:26,815 --> 00:50:27,941
Hey, Ju-kyung!

823
00:50:28,024 --> 00:50:30,861
I heard you were sick
and took medicine earlier. Are you okay?

824
00:50:30,944 --> 00:50:32,362
Don't skip your meals.

825
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:33,780
I feel fine.

826
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:35,240
I'm going to go.

827
00:50:35,323 --> 00:50:36,575
Stay healthy!

828
00:50:38,827 --> 00:50:43,123
Hey, Tae-hoon!
Are you bothering Soo-ho again?

829
00:50:43,206 --> 00:50:47,586
-He hates you. Take a hint, buddy!
-What are you talking about? Say it right.

830
00:50:47,669 --> 00:50:50,172
-What?
-"What?"

831
00:50:50,255 --> 00:50:51,882
-Are you mocking me?
-"Are you mocking me?"

832
00:51:00,056 --> 00:51:01,558
Why did you set all this up here?

833
00:51:01,641 --> 00:51:04,770
It's just that the moon looks beautiful,

834
00:51:04,853 --> 00:51:06,229
Ju-kyung's away,

835
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:08,648
and Hee-kyung and Ju-young
won't be back until late,

836
00:51:09,441 --> 00:51:11,651
so I put things together for us.
Take a seat.

837
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:17,157
Excited about getting complimented
after being scolded for so long, I see.

838
00:51:19,201 --> 00:51:20,660
You made tofu and kimchi?

839
00:51:21,453 --> 00:51:23,038
Remember our first date?

840
00:51:23,955 --> 00:51:25,290
We were in Cheongpyeong

841
00:51:25,373 --> 00:51:27,667
and had rice wine with tofu and kimchi.

842
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:29,711
You remember all the odd details.

843
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:33,882
I should have run for the hills.
What was I thinking, falling for you?

844
00:51:33,965 --> 00:51:35,675
I'm paying the price my whole life.

845
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:38,178
I was wrong to fall for your looks!

846
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:40,764
You're ruining the mood, seriously.

847
00:51:46,436 --> 00:51:50,440
But still, you were so handsome then.

848
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:54,194
You were a great singer on top of that,
so how could I not fall for you?

849
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:56,530
I'm still that person.

850
00:51:58,073 --> 00:52:03,787
You came to me

851
00:52:04,454 --> 00:52:10,126
With a rose between your red lips

852
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:16,341
I imagined, upon seeing your transparency

853
00:52:16,424 --> 00:52:20,971
If I could empty myself

854
00:52:21,054 --> 00:52:22,848
What's with you today?

855
00:52:22,931 --> 00:52:29,563
I imagined if I could ever be…

856
00:52:30,689 --> 00:52:32,399
held in your eyes.

857
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:36,653
I'm home…

858
00:52:41,408 --> 00:52:42,242
Get out.

859
00:52:48,456 --> 00:52:49,541
I can't unsee that.

860
00:52:50,417 --> 00:52:52,294
Black bean sauce instant noodles, please.

861
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:07,517
-Where's the pickled radish?
-Get it yourself.

862
00:53:08,101 --> 00:53:09,394
What? Did you stalk me here?

863
00:53:10,312 --> 00:53:11,396
Whatever.

864
00:53:15,567 --> 00:53:17,485
She even got a part-time job to see me?

865
00:53:18,194 --> 00:53:19,362
I can respect that.

866
00:53:25,535 --> 00:53:27,454
Here, go ahead.

867
00:53:28,663 --> 00:53:32,959
I usually never exchange numbers,
but I'll make this an exception.

868
00:53:36,796 --> 00:53:37,756
Are you crazy?

869
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:39,883
Why would you ask me to take your picture?

870
00:53:44,137 --> 00:53:47,474
-About time you clocked out, right?
-Yes, I'll see you tomorrow.

871
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:51,603
She couldn't possibly have thought
I would ask for her number.

872
00:53:51,686 --> 00:53:52,896
That must be it.

873
00:53:53,939 --> 00:53:57,067
Lim Ju-young, how are you so handsome?

874
00:53:57,859 --> 00:53:59,027
What are you doing?

875
00:54:36,147 --> 00:54:38,024
Let's give a round of applause!

876
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:40,610
Next is a performance of strength
by Team Rainbow!

877
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:42,779
Please welcome them with loud applause!

878
00:54:47,158 --> 00:54:48,994
What is he pulling with his mouth?
What's he doing?

879
00:54:49,077 --> 00:54:50,829
A car? It's a bicycle car!

880
00:54:52,872 --> 00:54:53,957
So strong.

881
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:55,375
Success!

882
00:54:57,627 --> 00:54:59,129
It's a bigger one!

883
00:55:07,762 --> 00:55:09,764
He pops it a little later. What an expert!

884
00:55:22,277 --> 00:55:24,320
Clap for them to the tune.

885
00:55:37,375 --> 00:55:39,753
These girls are really
giving everything they've got.

886
00:55:46,509 --> 00:55:48,970
The ultimate singer of Saebom High School.

887
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:53,349
I hear someone used to train
to become a member of a boy band!

888
00:55:53,433 --> 00:55:54,768
Where is he? Raise your hand.

889
00:55:54,851 --> 00:55:57,395
-Here!
-Many already know about him!

890
00:55:58,104 --> 00:55:59,105
What is this?

891
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:02,358
He looks very handsome
and has an aura about him.

892
00:56:02,442 --> 00:56:03,276
We can't let him be.

893
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:06,488
-How did he know?
-How far did the news spread?

894
00:56:06,571 --> 00:56:09,324
-Don't act up.
-Sit down.

895
00:56:09,407 --> 00:56:10,408
We just can't let him be.

896
00:56:10,492 --> 00:56:12,160
Come up to the stage! Applause!

897
00:56:12,243 --> 00:56:13,203
It was you, wasn't it?

898
00:56:13,286 --> 00:56:15,830
You're a great singer.
Sing us a song, please?

899
00:56:15,914 --> 00:56:17,540
-Just this once.
-I'm not doing it.

900
00:56:17,624 --> 00:56:19,250
Are you really not going to sing?

901
00:56:19,793 --> 00:56:22,337
Let me hear you sing, come on!

902
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:25,131
Han Seo-jun!

903
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:29,928
-Han Seo-jun!
-Han Seo-jun!

904
00:56:30,011 --> 00:56:31,971
-You want to hear me sing?
-Of course.

905
00:56:32,055 --> 00:56:33,306
Is it because you're shy?

906
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:37,227
-Go on. Hurry up!
-Then you owe me a favor.

907
00:56:37,310 --> 00:56:39,729
Seriously, you're just like Lim Ju-young.

908
00:56:40,355 --> 00:56:41,189
All right.

909
00:56:41,272 --> 00:56:43,024
I do you a favor if you sing on stage.

910
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:49,447
You're amazing!

911
00:56:59,499 --> 00:57:01,167
So dreamy.

912
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:05,880
You and I, underneath the starry night

913
00:57:05,964 --> 00:57:11,427
It makes me new and warm

914
00:57:11,511 --> 00:57:15,348
Your eyes, your smile

915
00:57:15,431 --> 00:57:18,560
I'll remember it forever

916
00:57:20,603 --> 00:57:25,108
My heart is full of you
I grow more like you

917
00:57:25,191 --> 00:57:30,738
A present for me
More beautiful than a dream

918
00:57:30,822 --> 00:57:34,451
Let's spend this endless night

919
00:57:34,534 --> 00:57:38,121
In each other's arms

920
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:44,043
I want to give you all my days

921
00:57:44,127 --> 00:57:48,923
I want you to know how I feel

922
00:57:49,007 --> 00:57:53,720
The sleepless blue winds

923
00:57:53,803 --> 00:57:57,974
Brightly illuminate this night

924
00:57:58,057 --> 00:58:03,313
-I wonder if you know
-Where are you going, Limju?

925
00:58:03,396 --> 00:58:08,193
My greatest happiness
Is spending regular days with you

926
00:58:08,276 --> 00:58:13,072
You are a light in my world

927
00:58:13,156 --> 00:58:19,496
Stay by my side, just as you are

928
00:58:28,379 --> 00:58:29,339
Hey, Ju-kyung!

929
00:58:30,298 --> 00:58:31,257
Ju-kyung.

930
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:35,595
Can you give this to Soo-ho for me?

931
00:58:35,678 --> 00:58:37,305
What? Me?

932
00:58:37,388 --> 00:58:38,681
Okay, listen up.

933
00:58:38,765 --> 00:58:41,809
Walk straight southeastward.
He'll be walking along the stream.

934
00:58:42,852 --> 00:58:43,770
My goodness.

935
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:47,607
I need to use the restroom. Sorry.

936
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:49,526
You need to give me his jacket.

937
00:58:49,609 --> 00:58:50,610
That's right.

938
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:03,498
Soo-ho!

939
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:05,542
Go straight southeastward…

940
00:59:05,625 --> 00:59:06,459
No.

941
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:08,294
You go straight to the northwest.

942
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:09,837
Ju-kyung will be by the stream.

943
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:13,007
Wish you luck, buddy.

944
00:59:16,010 --> 00:59:17,220
Don't be too moved.

945
00:59:45,415 --> 00:59:46,249
Hey, Soo-ho.

946
00:59:59,512 --> 01:00:00,346
Hey, Ju-kyung.

947
01:00:01,347 --> 01:00:02,640
What are you doing out here?

948
01:00:02,724 --> 01:00:05,310
-Well…
-Have you seen Soo-ho?

949
01:00:06,144 --> 01:00:06,978
Soo-ho?

950
01:00:07,061 --> 01:00:08,896
You still haven't told her how you feel?

951
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:10,106
Do it today, if you can.

952
01:00:12,567 --> 01:00:14,485
I think I saw him going that way earlier.

953
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:17,280
Wait, isn't that Soo-ho's?

954
01:00:17,363 --> 01:00:18,197
What?

955
01:00:19,365 --> 01:00:21,909
Tae-hoon wanted me to take this to him.

956
01:00:21,993 --> 01:00:24,037
He did? Then I'll give it to him.

957
01:00:29,667 --> 01:00:30,501
Sure.

958
01:00:31,127 --> 01:00:32,587
You should give it to him.

959
01:00:34,088 --> 01:00:35,340
It's the right thing to do.

960
01:00:36,966 --> 01:00:38,217
I heard he's by the stream.

961
01:00:38,301 --> 01:00:39,927
Is he? Head inside and rest.

962
01:00:48,728 --> 01:00:49,562
Ju-kyung.

963
01:00:55,777 --> 01:00:57,862
Don't you forget about doing me a favor.

964
01:01:01,741 --> 01:01:02,617
How was it?

965
01:01:03,826 --> 01:01:05,578
You said you wanted to hear me sing.

966
01:01:08,706 --> 01:01:09,540
Why?

967
01:01:10,041 --> 01:01:11,250
Was it that moving?

968
01:01:11,918 --> 01:01:12,960
I get it.

969
01:01:13,044 --> 01:01:15,046
Many have cried after hearing me sing.

970
01:01:16,172 --> 01:01:17,632
But you don't have to cry too.

971
01:01:23,763 --> 01:01:26,099
Hey, what's wrong?

972
01:01:31,145 --> 01:01:32,355
What is it?

973
01:01:33,147 --> 01:01:34,023
What do you mean?

974
01:01:34,107 --> 01:01:35,775
Ju-kyung asked me to bring this to you.

975
01:01:36,442 --> 01:01:38,236
-She asked you?
-Yes.

976
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:43,116
Hey, you need to take your jacket.

977
01:01:47,954 --> 01:01:50,248
Hey, you dropped this.

978
01:02:10,476 --> 01:02:11,519
What is it?

979
01:02:14,105 --> 01:02:15,481
Are you still feeling sick?

980
01:02:16,816 --> 01:02:17,900
I'm sorry.

981
01:02:19,318 --> 01:02:21,320
I don't know what it is,
but it's all my bad.

982
01:02:22,947 --> 01:02:23,781
Why…

983
01:02:25,158 --> 01:02:27,410
Why doesn't Soo-ho like me?

984
01:02:33,166 --> 01:02:34,834
-I…
-Don't say it.

985
01:02:34,917 --> 01:02:36,002
Actually…

986
01:02:36,085 --> 01:02:37,503
I said, don't say it.

987
01:02:38,171 --> 01:02:39,630
I like Soo-ho.

988
01:02:41,340 --> 01:02:43,217
I told you not to say it.

989
01:02:43,301 --> 01:02:45,344
I thought I'd be okay,

990
01:02:47,263 --> 01:02:48,765
but it hurts a little.

991
01:02:58,024 --> 01:03:01,027
Keep this a secret. Okay?

992
01:03:04,113 --> 01:03:06,407
Then you should have
kept it a secret from me too.

993
01:03:08,326 --> 01:03:09,285
Let me see you.

994
01:03:13,456 --> 01:03:16,083
You look ugly when you cry.

995
01:03:17,335 --> 01:03:18,169
Come on.

996
01:03:40,858 --> 01:03:41,692
Leave it.

997
01:03:41,776 --> 01:03:43,194
You'll erase my makeup.

998
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:13,266
Why did I make a show of myself by crying?

999
01:04:14,433 --> 01:04:16,227
I hope the talent show isn't over yet.

1000
01:04:16,310 --> 01:04:18,312
I should reapply
before the others get back.

1001
01:04:22,525 --> 01:04:24,193
You said you weren't avoiding me.

1002
01:04:26,362 --> 01:04:27,280
Did you cry?

1003
01:04:28,614 --> 01:04:29,448
Why?

1004
01:04:30,199 --> 01:04:31,242
Because of Seo-jun?

1005
01:04:33,536 --> 01:04:35,121
Why are you crying over him?

1006
01:04:36,622 --> 01:04:37,874
Is it because you like him?

1007
01:04:40,418 --> 01:04:42,420
-What?
-Do you like Seo-jun?

1008
01:04:43,004 --> 01:04:44,755
-Why do you care?
-Answer me!

1009
01:04:45,631 --> 01:04:46,757
What's up with you?

1010
01:04:47,758 --> 01:04:50,386
Why is it your business
whether I cried or who I like?

1011
01:04:51,721 --> 01:04:55,057
Why do you keep confusing me
when you like someone else?

1012
01:04:56,559 --> 01:04:57,643
What do you mean?

1013
01:04:57,727 --> 01:04:59,270
You like Su-jin.

1014
01:05:00,646 --> 01:05:03,274
So why would you be nice to me
and make me nervous and…

1015
01:05:08,154 --> 01:05:09,155
Ju-kyung,

1016
01:05:10,114 --> 01:05:12,158
I think there's been a misunderstanding…

1017
01:05:14,452 --> 01:05:16,329
-I did it!
-I know, of course…

1018
01:05:17,038 --> 01:05:18,372
I don't have makeup on.

1019
01:05:18,456 --> 01:05:19,498
Darn it.

1020
01:05:27,715 --> 01:05:29,926
-It's the Ugly Ghost!
-The Ugly Ghost!

1021
01:05:31,010 --> 01:05:33,262
-A ghost!
-You're so busted.

1022
01:05:33,346 --> 01:05:34,555
Get that Ugly Ghost!

1023
01:05:34,639 --> 01:05:35,514
Get it!

1024
01:05:36,182 --> 01:05:38,225
-Get it!
-Wait up!

1025
01:05:45,149 --> 01:05:48,194
-Catch that Ugly Ghost!
-Catch it!

1026
01:05:48,277 --> 01:05:49,570
Go get it!

1027
01:05:56,202 --> 01:05:57,954
Why are they chasing me?

1028
01:05:58,037 --> 01:05:59,121
What do I do?

1029
01:06:21,018 --> 01:06:22,103
Go down!

1030
01:06:23,229 --> 01:06:25,523
-Hey, where is it?
-Let's go down there!

1031
01:06:27,233 --> 01:06:29,694
-Hurry up!
-Let's catch it!

1032
01:06:33,531 --> 01:06:35,157
-It's over there!
-Down there!

1033
01:06:40,413 --> 01:06:41,789
I don't like Su-jin.

1034
01:06:44,542 --> 01:06:45,793
The person I like…

1035
01:06:45,876 --> 01:06:46,961
There it is!

1036
01:06:48,754 --> 01:06:49,714
is you.

1037
01:07:50,733 --> 01:07:53,611
THANK YOU TO WOO HYUN
FOR HIS SPECIAL APPEARANCE

1038
01:08:15,674 --> 01:08:22,681
EPILOGUE

1039
01:08:25,434 --> 01:08:29,230
Here's one who doesn't judge
a book by its cover.

1040
01:08:34,944 --> 01:08:36,695
No one from our school is around, right?

1041
01:08:36,779 --> 01:08:39,532
-Get down.
-Do we really have to do this?

1042
01:08:39,615 --> 01:08:41,283
I just feel a bit shy.

1043
01:08:41,367 --> 01:08:42,868
Why are you getting a part-time job?

1044
01:08:42,952 --> 01:08:45,037
To pay for beauty school.

1045
01:08:45,121 --> 01:08:47,289
I could find a job for you.

1046
01:08:47,373 --> 01:08:49,333
-I'm really bad, aren't I?
-No.

1047
01:08:49,834 --> 01:08:51,127
You're awful beyond imagination.

1048
01:08:51,877 --> 01:08:54,338
I brought you here to show you something.

1049
01:08:56,465 --> 01:08:57,883
I like Lee Soo-ho.

1050
01:09:00,261 --> 01:09:02,263
Lim Ju-kyung, let's end things between us.

1051
01:09:04,306 --> 01:09:09,061
