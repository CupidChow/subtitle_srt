 True Beauty 

4
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:37,480
Hello.

5
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,330
- Is this your second baby? 
 - Yes.

6
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:41,810
He's big and healthy!

7
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:43,930
She's my daughter...

8
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,810
Hee Gyeong was much prettier...

9
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:50,680
How are you so pretty, Hee Gyeong?

10
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,960
Are you going to have her try out for Miss Korea?

11
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:00,370
 I knew from a very young age... 

12
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:02,760
 that I was not beautiful. 

13
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,230
Whoa, Grandpa!

14
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:07,640
Please reverse one move.

15
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,860
Just one, please!

16
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:12,710
Each move is permanent in Janggi!  (Korean Chess) 

17
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:15,570
No, never!

18
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:20,620
Ju Gyeong, how come you take after your mother so much?

19
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:22,930
She should've taken after her father.

20
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:25,230
- She'll need surgery. 
 - Oh, come on.

21
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:29,070
Honey, she must've been born to a different father.

22
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:33,610
- Grandpa! 
 - You’ll hurt her feelings.

23
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:38,060
It'll be fine as long as you study well, okay?

24
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:47,880
 I've dreamed of a cartoon-like moment, 

25
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:51,140
 when an average girl transforms in an instant 

26
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:53,610
 into a beautiful fairy, just like magic, but... 

27
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,480
Ha, ha!

28
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,570
What the heck!

29
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:02,750
She must think she's some kind of fairy.

30
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,560
Look at her princess syndrome.

31
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,440
She transformed into an ugly beast!

32
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09,040
Be gone, beast!

33
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:17,010
Chase her!

34
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,520
  Instead of the main character of a romance comic, 

35
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:52,740
  I was more like the main character of a horror comic with a cursed mask. 

36
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:53,880
  Cursed Mask 

37
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,150
  That's when I realized. 

38
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:07,260

 Through this character of the professor who only worked after losing humanity,

44
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:27,930
this story reports irrational occurrences in modern society.

45
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:31,410
If you look at the problem below, there are various cases given.

46
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:34,590
If you look at number one... Oh, look at where the time's gone.

47
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:37,810
Okay, by tomorrow, do your homework. Today's class ends here.

48
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:41,040
Alright.

49
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,180
- Se Mi! 
 - What is it?

50
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,820
Thank you.

51
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:53,520
- My hair got so flat. 
 - Yeah, way to go, sleeping on your desk.

52
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,520
Sorry, sorry, sorry!

53
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,710
Do you want to read this, too?

54
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:08,930
I'm not sure.

55
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:15,290
Do you want to listen, too?

56
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:17,620
I'm not sure.

57
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,630
Se Mi, I want to put some of this tint on.

58
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:27,770
Wearing tint is not going to help you look remotely as pretty as goddess Se Mi.

59
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:30,910
Was I talking to you?  Stop pissing me off.

60
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:33,280
Hey, look at her.

61
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:38,110
What a show.

62
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:40,230
Hey, Dumpling.

63
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:43,640
- Dumpling! 
 - Dumpling!

64
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:48,740
- Dumpling! 
 - Oh, were you calling for me?

65
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:51,810
Is there any other Dumpling here?

66
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:54,250
What are you doing? Go on already.

67
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,280
Right now? Oh, okay.

68
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,850
There goes our shuttle.

69
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:03,000
 Pro dumping shuttler!   

70
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,970
It's just two meat dumplings and one kimchi one, right?

71
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:20,380
Enjoy your food!

72
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:22,620
Two dumplings, please. Two.

73
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:25,650
- It's my turn. 
 - What the heck?

74
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:29,280
- Hey, enjoy. 
 - Thank you!

75
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,140
- Two  meat and— 
 - One kimchi, right?

76
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:36,060

No. Nothing.

107
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:12,240
- Steal the ball from me. 
 - Hey!

108
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,020
- Where's Dumpling? 
 - Is she actually making dumplings or something?

109
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:19,100
- Oh, look at this! 
 - What?

110
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:22,590
- What is it? What? 
 - What's with him?

111
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:27,160
Wait, isn't that the guy from the cafeteria who hits on you?

112
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:30,900
Oh, I guess they've bonded together on something.

113
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:39,350
- Eat well! 
 - Thank you.

114
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:46,170
- Oppa Hyeon Bin is so cool, right? 
 - I'm not sure.

115
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:50,440
He told me we had similar music taste earlier, and he just smiled at me.

116
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:54,050
Don't you think he likes me?

117
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:56,020
I'm not sure.

118
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:58,420
I'm going to confess tomorrow.

It's a good idea, right?

120

Wow. Hey, if I give you ten million won, will you date her?

123
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:12,660
- I wouldn't do it for one hundred million won. 
 - Me neither.

124
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:15,860
I'm going to eat later.

125
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:20,190

126
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:25,480

00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:46,460

00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:35,220
Do it with more force! Oh, my son! Why'd you come out?

134
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:38,250
- Are you hungry? Do you want fruits? 
 - No.

135
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:44,440
Im Ju Gyeong, what did you do in the kitchen all weekend instead of studying?

136
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,020
I was just making something.

137
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:50,340
Work on your grades, girl! Your grades on the last exam were terrible.

138
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,140
Alright, I'll take care of it myself!

139
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:54,480
Im Ju Gyeong! Where are you going, not listening to me?

140
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,660
She said she'd take care of it herself. Let it go.

141
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:02,010
Who does Im Ju Gyeong take after to be like that?

142
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:08,940
- Hurry up and loosen up my left side. 
 - Alright, alright.

143
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:16,290
  - I'm busy right now, so I'll contact you later. 
 - You're not picking up. When are they salvaging the ship? It better be soon. Can you refund my investment? 

144
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:18,360
Focus better.

145
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,480
Alright, hold on.

146
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,720

162
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:22,410
Oh, what do I do?

163
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:26,880
"Then... Do you want to start dating today?"

164
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:36,250
Im Joo Bal, your music! 
  (Bal means foot) 

165
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:38,750
Gosh, my poor eyes!

166
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,610
What's with her?

167
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:49,390
  You have my whole heart! 
 Valentine 

168
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:51,320
  Se Yeon shone brighter than others. 

169
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,080
  Se Yeon, happy birthday. Hope you're happy in heaven." 

170
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:56,370
Jeong Se Yeon's fans are funny.

171
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:58,360
Didn't they curse him out so much before he died?

172
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:01,130
Hey. They're acting so sad now, huh?

173
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:04,330
Wow, so two-faced.

174
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:06,750
  I'm confessing to my crush today. 

175
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,620
 I'm so nervous. 

176
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,880
 Please support me to give me courage! 

177
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,160
  I'm so nervous. 
   

178
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,530
 Your courage is amazing. Hope it goes well! 

179
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:18,660
  Hope reality doesn't hit you. I hope you guys get together! 

180
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:40,990
Stop pushing!

181
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,600
Oh! It's Se Mi!

182
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,950
- Oh, really?  
 - What, really?

183
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:55,520
- Oh, Se Mi! 
 - Move, move.

184
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,550
Wow! Her visuals are no joke.

185
00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:00,460
This is crazy.

186
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:03,940
- Hey, make a seat for her.  
 - You can sit here.

187
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:10,340
- Wow, this is amazing. 
 - Ow...

188
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:16,980
What the hell?

189
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:19,510
I'm sorry!

190
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:33,630
- Hey! 
 - I'll go buy dumplings!

191
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,120
Hey, what's up with this?

192
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,630
Dumpling Vending Machine?   (T/N: Nickname for Ju Gyeong since she gets them dumplings) 

193
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:43,760
What's this?

194
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,780
Cookies?

195
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:50,600
- So ugly. 
- Tacky! 
 - She made a big effort.

196
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:56,000
"Oppa, you're a fool. You're a fool who doesn't know my feelings. I'm a fool, too."

197
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,800
Gosh, this is so lame.

198
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,590
- Hey! 
 - Huh?

199
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:03,970
- Is Dumpling confessing today? 
 - Ah, about that.

200
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:06,380
She can't even talk properly.

201
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:09,380
Like attracts like.

202
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,390
Oppa Hyeon Bin!

203
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:19,280
Oh, hey! What is it, Se Mi?

204
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,970
Are you busy?

205
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:22,940
Do you have something to tell me?

206
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:28,420
Are you, by chance, dating Im Ju Gyeong?

207
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:30,820
What? Why do you ask?

208
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:33,500
I was so shocked after I heard!

209
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:40,940
If you're #1 level, she's like dirty water.

210
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:43,360
You and Ju Gyeong are on totally different levels.

211
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,540
Ah, of course we're different.

212
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:50,590
Because you're too nice to her, she sees you as an easy target and is trying to go for you.

213
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:53,380
Right? I am a bit nice.

214
00:14:53,380 --> 00:15:01,490
Honestly, after I heard the rumor you were dating Ju Gyeong, I was so upset!

215
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:05,370
Gosh, I will kill the guy who upset our Se Mi. Really, this is—

216
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:07,550
Wang Hyeon Bin, you horrible guy! Horrible!

217
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:09,950
Oh, Oppa! Oppa! Don't do that...

218
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:12,920
It'll mess with your handsome face.

219
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:17,200
Then, I'll see you next time, Oppa!

220
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:21,690
When's next time? Today? I have time right now!

221
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:23,080
Maybe... Soon?

222
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,750
Alright, Se Mi. I'll DM you soon. We'll see each other soon.

223
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,570
Yes, Oppa.

224
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:31,860
- I'll be careful! 
 - Hey, why's he so easy?

225
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:34,000
So naive.

226
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:40,160
 Morning Care 

227
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,490
  Hairdresser License 

228
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,670
All done! It's perfect. Both sides are like "decalcompas." They're the same.  (T/N: she meant "decalcomanie") 

229
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:52,850
I knew Pandora's sharp eyes are like a computer!

230
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:56,390
- I can have a cup of coffee, right? 
 - Yes, of course, guest!

231
00:15:56,390 --> 00:16:00,020
Now! Let's see, let's see, let's see!

232
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:02,950
You did it too lightly last time.

233
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:05,370
Why? It's the trend to make it light so it looks natural.

234
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:07,360
If I spent money, it should be more noticeable.

235
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:12,250
Aigoo, I understand. Just trust me!

236
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:16,770
Why haven't I seen your handsome husband around lately?

237
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:22,860
Oh, I don't know. He's been so focused on other things. He's always calling someone.

238
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:25,090
What if he's... cheating?

239
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,740
Oh, go and tell him to.

240
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:29,610
As long as he doesn't cause a money problem.

241
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:36,330
What? Are you here for eyebrows?

242
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:38,740
Where's Im Jae Pil's wife?

243
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,030
What's this?

244
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:50,080
Concert tickets, and...

245
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:53,440
I made you some cookies and—

246
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,740
And what else?

247
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:58,570
And...

248
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:03,380
It's my feelings!

249
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,360
I like you, Oppa!

250
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:11,090
What? Don't say that you are confessing now.

251
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:17,830
I'm Hyeon Bin! Wang Hyeon Bin!

252
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:19,510
What?

253
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:22,970
Okay...

254
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:26,770
If you confess, what? You think we're going to start dating?

255
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:33,900
In the past, you told me that I was a good kid, and you said we had similar interests.

256
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:39,280
Hey. I was just nice to you because I felt bad that you were treated as an outcast. But what?

257
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,510
Hey, if your face is lacking, you should at least have some sense to make up for it.

258
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:46,030
Can you not even see where you stand?

259
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:55,150
Instead of doing something useless like this, look in the mirror.

260
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:09,820
- Hey, you filmed it all, right? 
 - Oh, what do we do? How pitiful, our Dumpling.

261
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:13,670
That was the confession from our school's Top Bomb!   (T/N: Bomb refers to someone ugly) 

262
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:15,980
A round of applause!

263
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:22,610
Should we listen to her feelings after being rejected?

264
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:25,270
Should we have a listen?

265
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,690
 Wow, awesome! You came out so ugly! 

266
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:30,790
- Hey, say something. Quick! 
 - Stop.

267
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:35,020
- What do you mean? Your face was already shown here. Hurry and talk. 
 - I said stop.

268
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,650
- Oh... 
 - Stop it.

269
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:39,760
Hey. How dare you push her?

270
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,420
Do you want to die?

271
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:03,070
Why do you guys hate me so much?

272
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:12,050
Why do you hate me?

273
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:16,570
I haven't done a single thing wrong to you.

274
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:20,580
So why do you hate me so much?

275
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:27,500
Hey.

276
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:31,010
Should I educate you?

277
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:37,210
Because. You're. Ugly.

278
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:41,490
- You got the dirt on you. 
 - Ah, right!

279
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:44,590
- Don't come here. 
 - I really forgot!

280
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:46,880
- Stop it! 
 - Ha, say it again!

281
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,400
- Stop it! 
 - What did she do when she fell?

282
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,780
"I said stop!"

283
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:55,400
Hey, hey. Where is she going?  Hey, where are you going?!

284
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,650
- "I said stop!" 
 - She's so annoying.

285
00:19:57,650 --> 00:20:00,630
I hate her.

286
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:06,960
  #3315. Live. Our school's Top Bomb's confession scene lol. 

287
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,620
  The guy doesn't look that good, either. Bomb's standards are so low. 

288
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:12,260
  - She's the so-called loser at our school. 
 - She has great confidence for someone so ugly. 

289
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:15,500
  That's so embarrassing. How can she come to school? 

290
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:46,980
  Ground Floor Cloud 9 

291
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:05,950
  Instead of doing something useless like this, look in the mirror. 

292
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:09,230
  Hey, if your face is lacking, you should at least have some sense to make up for it. 

293
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:10,620
 Can you not even see where you stand? 

294
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:14,910
 Because. You're. Ugly. 

295
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:50,800
Oh, here's our star making an entrance!

296
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:57,830
  Bomb, Bomb, Bomb, Bomb, Bomb! 

297
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:12,800
  Bomb, Bomb, Bomb, Bomb, Bomb, Bomb, Bomb! 

298
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:20,230
No one even likes me.

299
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:26,440
How can I go to school tomorrow?

300
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:17,400
 Happy birthday. In loving memory of Jeong Se Yeon. 

301
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,860
 Happy birthday. In loving memory of Jeong Se Yeon. 

302
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:27,010
 Happy birthday. In loving memory of Jeong Se Yeon. 

303
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:34,060
What a shame. At the age of eighteen...

304
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:49,430
I...

305
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:55,410
I won't die.

306
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:02,480
Ah, it's cold!

307
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:43,430
♫   Our time might still   ♫

308
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:49,410
♫   be left, even just a moment   ♫

309
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:51,250
What a relief.

310
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:56,420
♫   At some point,  ♫

311
00:25:56,420 --> 00:26:03,250
♫   the futile expectations became my support  ♫

312
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:09,740
♫  How do you do? How are you doing?  ♫

313
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:17,040
♫  No matter how hard I try, I don’t think I’m okay ♫

314
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:21,230
♫  You’re not here,  ♫

315
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:23,390
What are you doing?

316
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:26,230
My glasses...

317
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:30,250
Where are they?

318
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:34,470
My glasses.

319
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:39,240
Without my glasses I can't see anything.  Where are they?

320
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,730
What were you doing?

321
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:45,030
Were you going to jump off?

322
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:50,020
Are you crazy? Out of your mind?

323
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:54,270
What could be so hard that you want to die?

324
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:56,490
Why would you make such a choice!?  Why?

325
00:26:56,490 --> 00:27:00,900
- I wasn't going to die. 
 - If you want to die, you have to fight just as hard.

326
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,150
Have you not thought about the others around you

327
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:08,790
who would be sad if you die?

328
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:14,300
- I... 
 - Someone would've felt guilty enough about not saving you,

329
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:18,110
and that could make them miserable their whole life.

330
00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:22,020
Got it?

331
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:34,520
Because they can't do anything for the person who died.

332
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:38,110
So don't die.

333
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:42,730
♫   I never knew what love was   ♫

334
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:47,270
♫   I didn't know   ♫

335
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:05,650
What? If I leave, will you jump off?

336
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,650
Ah, no...

337
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:15,190
H-hey! My glasses...

338
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:20,340
Wait!

339
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:22,260
 Elevator being inspected 

340
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:34,100
What is it? Is it broken?

341
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:36,620
Let's go together, sir!

342
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:41,640
Let's go together!

343
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:45,300
Let's go together.

344
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:50,280
I lost my glasses because of you, sir, so I can't see a thing!

345
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:53,910
My vision is minus 8.0.

346
00:28:55,150 --> 00:29:00,740
If I don't have my glasses, I can't differentiate between poop and bean paste!

347
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:23,510
Did you leave?

348
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:29,350
It looks like he really did...

349
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:35,090
Why is my life like this?

350
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:51,160
So you didn't leave?

351
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,220
Take my hand and get up.

352
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:54,860
Alright.

353
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,200
Where are you touching me?

354
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:12,090
I wasn't trying to touch you there.

355
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:17,000
I'd better carry you on my back.

356
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:25,300
Thank you.

357
00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:38,100
I'm a bit heavier than I look, right, sir?

358
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:43,280
You look heavy, too. Who are you calling sir?

359
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,850
Excuse me.

360
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:02,650
I have something to ask you, sir. Why were you—

361
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:06,690
Ma'am, just say it louder.

362
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:10,150
If I talk louder, it'll echo. That's scarier.

363
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:13,820
Why would you call me ma'am? I'm in a school uniform.

364
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:24,930
I was wondering if another person has been on the rooftop like me.

365
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:32,610
I mean, we're strangers, but you saved me and got mad at me.

366
00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:36,170
So I was wondering if you know anyone who's died like that.

367
00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:40,630
If you say another word, I'm going to leave you here.

368
00:31:45,890 --> 00:31:48,590
What do you eat that you are so heavy?

369
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:53,830
- Stay strong! Stay strong!  
 - Ma'am!

370
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:58,410
Oh, I won't say another word. Let's hush, okay? Hush!

371
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:18,900
Sir, was that not broken?

372
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:23,990
Oh, it was just a brief inspection. Did you not hear the announcement?

373
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:30,770
We should've waited a bit.

374
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:47,440
Excuse me, sir!

375
00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:52,930
Again with the "sir."

376
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:55,510
What?

377
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:58,870
Uh...

378
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:03,410
Although it's not my place to say this...

379
00:33:06,370 --> 00:33:08,480
Please stay strong.

380
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:19,180
The dead wouldn't want the people they left to suffer for so long.

381
00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:26,240
So you should be happy. You should!

382
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:32,660
Sir, could you take me to Bukchon?

383
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:50,530
Why would you go up there if you had no courage to die, fool?

384
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:56,250
It hasn't even been long since I got new glasses. Mom will scold me.

385
00:33:58,310 --> 00:34:03,460
 After the beep, you will be connected to voicemail and a fee will be charged. 

386
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:07,560
Mom, I wanted to hear your voice.

387
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:14,260
  No, nevermind. This is better. 

388
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:19,510
  If I heard your voice, I wouldn't be able to die. 

389
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:21,920
  Thank you for giving birth to me 

390
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:26,250
  and raising me for 18 years. 

391
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:30,750
  I'll be born as your daughter again in the next life. 

392
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:39,400
  Let's meet again then. Please make sure that I am born pretty. 

393
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:47,810
What do I do?

394
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:53,880
What if Mom heard it? She can't!

395
00:34:56,920 --> 00:35:00,260
Oh, she's not answering.

396
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:03,080
Sir, please get there fast!

397
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:06,010
Please pick up!

398
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:17,570
Mom, Mom.

399
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:19,480
Hey, hey. Take her into the room.

400
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,670
Let go!

401
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:24,410
You idiot! What's at Ulleungdo's coast, you said? A treasure ship?

402
00:35:24,410 --> 00:35:26,040
Do you believe that?!

403
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:31,570
It's not that hard to believe. Historically, in the 1800s... no, in 1905, the Russo-Japanese War—

404
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:34,030
Never mind the Russo-Japanese War.

405
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:36,310
You idiot, this is the real war now!

406
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:38,310
Oh, no, no!

407
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:40,060
Oh, our Madam Hong! No, no!

408
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:42,340
- Hold her! 
 - Let go!

409
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:45,260
It's historically true that the ship Dmitrii Donskoi sank.

410
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:47,700
Because of you, my life is about to sink!

411
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:52,060
Is 500 million won nothing to you?!

412
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:54,010
So you invested it there?

413
00:35:54,010 --> 00:35:57,420
Why are you still like this at the age of 50!

414
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:00,310
Dad! Hurry and beg for forgiveness! Hurry!

415
00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:01,910
Hurry!

416
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:06,320
Honey, it's my fault. Mrs. Hong Hyeon Suk, I made a mistake.

417
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,880
- Please forgive me once. 
 - Forget forgiveness.

418
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:13,320
I'm going to kill you today and go to jail!

419
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:16,060
Mom! Mom!

420
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:18,840
Mom! Mom!

421
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,810
Stop right there!

422
00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:22,450
Give that here.

423
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:24,390
Come here! Won't you?

424
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:26,850
Please.

425
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:30,150
- Argh! 
 - Look at you.

426
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:33,080
- Argh! 
 - You blocked it?

427
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:10,020
 The dead wouldn't want the people they left to suffer for so long. 

428
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:13,210
 So you should be happy. 

429
00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:41,820
Mom! Mom!

430
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:45,420
I should die.

431
00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:50,370
Mom!

432
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:52,830
Mom, why would you die?

433
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:54,830
You're here?

434
00:38:57,430 --> 00:39:01,060
How could I die and leave you guys behind?

435
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:08,410
Let's die together. Together.

436
00:39:08,410 --> 00:39:10,220
I won't say anything like that ever again!

437
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:11,160
Don't cry!

438
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:14,630
How can I not cry right now?

439
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:18,990
My poor destiny.

440
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:22,040
You should've just given birth to a pretty me!

441
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:24,850
Only Unni and Ju Yeong look like Dad.

442
00:39:24,850 --> 00:39:28,170
That's why I did it.

443
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:28,980
What?

444
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:30,950
What is said is right.

445
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:35,320
I'm ugly because I take after you!

446
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,640
What did you say?

447
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,050
Hey, can't you read the mood?

448
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:40,420
Im Ju Bal, shush.

449
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:43,520
I won't die so just let me have plastic surgery, okay?

450
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,690
- Then that solves it! 
 - This idiot!

451
00:39:45,690 --> 00:39:47,240
Plastic surgery, my butt!

452
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:48,390
Do you want to be kicked out too?!

453
00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:52,130
Do you also think a pretty daughter is better than an ugly one?

454
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:54,150
Don't make any noise and just go.

455
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:56,130
- Go already! 
 - Please, do it for me.

456
00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:58,040
- Get out! 
 - Please do it.

457
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:01,260
Why'd I take after you?!

458
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:03,790
- Please do it! 
 - Get over here!

459
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:18,770
 Hye Min 

460
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:31,460
  Message 

461
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:34,730
 Hye Min! Have you gotten up? 
 Today's the day! (all marked as 'unread') 

462
00:40:34,730 --> 00:40:37,320
 Just thinking about confessing is making me shake. 
 (marked as 'unread') 

463
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:40,800
I guess only I thought of us as friends...

464
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:47,310
I'll really be alone from tomorrow on.

465
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:49,930
I want to drop out.

466
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:52,950
Hey, Im Ju Gyeong!

467
00:40:54,610 --> 00:40:55,970
Are you asleep?

468
00:40:55,970 --> 00:40:58,040
I'm trying to.

469
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:01,670
I'm going to have a drink with Mom, so you should sleep.

470
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:13,760
Why'd I leave that voicemail? It made Mom so upset.

471
00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:25,990
I was so happy after getting a contract for this apartment.

472
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:28,950
I stayed up a few nights because of it.

473
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:32,220
- You're going to sell it?
 - Is there any other way out?

474
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:36,360
We couldn't get any tenants for our old home, so even if we sell that one, it'll barely be anything.

475
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:39,970
We should sell this apartment to pay the debt and move into our old one.

476
00:41:39,970 --> 00:41:43,690
Don't do it. I'll try to get my severance pay in advance,

477
00:41:43,690 --> 00:41:45,360
and if I look into loans—

478
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:48,390
No, forget it. My husband made the mess, so I'll figure it out.

479
00:41:48,390 --> 00:41:51,190
My child did nothing wrong.

480
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:55,430
Tell Dad to come home. Although he did wrong, kicking him out in his underwear in this weather was too much.

481
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:58,770
Whatever. I don't care if he finds somewhere to sleep or not.

482
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:09,150
Honey, I'm sorry!

483
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:22,340
  I'm confessing to my crush today. I'm so nervous. Please support me to give me courage!  

484
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:23,390
  I'm so nervous. 

485
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:25,690
  - Your courage is amazing. 
 - Hope reality doesn't hit you. I hope you guys get together! 

486
00:42:25,690 --> 00:42:26,540
  Let us know the aftermath! 

487
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:28,410
  Did you confess today? Did you start dating? 

488
00:42:28,410 --> 00:42:30,070
  Reply, please! Tell us what happened! 

489
00:42:30,070 --> 00:42:34,580
  Guys, actually, I was rejected. 

490
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:40,000
  He doesn't like me because I'm ugly. 

491
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,860
  Oh, no! Win him over with your smart brain! 

492
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:44,100
  What about a full-body plastic surgery? There are doctors. 

493
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:48,410
I can't study well, and I can't even get plastic surgery.

494
00:42:49,930 --> 00:42:51,410
  Do you know how to do makeup? 

495
00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:54,490
  You can cover enough with makeup. Look at this link. 

496
00:42:54,490 --> 00:42:58,130
  Miraculous makeup, before and after. 
 I hope you guys can get pretty after watching this video~~ 

497
00:42:58,130 --> 00:42:59,810
 Miraculous makeup, before and after. 

498
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:02,400
  Shoot that handsome boy's heart! 

499
00:43:07,370 --> 00:43:09,870
Amazing!

500
00:43:09,870 --> 00:43:11,940
This is it!

501
00:43:16,350 --> 00:43:17,950
Whoa!

502
00:43:21,990 --> 00:43:25,710
 Why are they staring at me? Because of the video? 

503
00:43:25,710 --> 00:43:29,950
No, maybe because I'm pretty?

504
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:47,350
Wow, this is crazy!

505
00:43:47,350 --> 00:43:48,820
Take a picture!

506
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:52,490
Hey! Did you do kom-sa?   (T/N: Referring to her thick eyeliner, which looks as if drawn on by a black computer pen used to circle answers in exams) 

507
00:43:52,490 --> 00:43:53,650
Hey, this is crazy.

508
00:43:53,650 --> 00:43:54,630
Take a picture!

509
00:43:54,630 --> 00:43:57,450
This is it! A save-worthy picture!

510
00:43:57,450 --> 00:43:59,960
Hey, look over here.

511
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:04,150
Hey, did no one say a word when you left the house?

512
00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:06,000
Hey, wow!

513
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:11,650
Hey, smile for us! Smile.

514
00:44:11,650 --> 00:44:14,820
I'm crying too!

515
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:17,460
Yes, I'm selling it quickly.

516
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:20,050
It's a bit urgent.

517
00:44:20,050 --> 00:44:24,170
Please do it quickly. Thank you.

518
00:44:34,770 --> 00:44:36,760
Mom.

519
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:45,220
My goodness, what the heck is wrong with your face?

520
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:47,320
Are you trying to kill me with a heart attack?

521
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:50,560
I did my makeup, but does it look weird?

522
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:53,730
Makeup, my butt. That's ghost makeup!

523
00:44:53,730 --> 00:44:56,120
Did you just come out of filming for "Korean Ghost Stories?"

524
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:58,040
Go and remove it immediately.

525
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:00,240
Gosh, I'm so embarrassed. How will I go to school?

526
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:02,130
Mom, I want to transfer.

527
00:45:02,130 --> 00:45:04,460
Please, let me transfer!

528
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:06,990
As it is, we are moving.

529
00:45:08,090 --> 00:45:11,560
We have to move back to our old home, so you'll have to transfer.

530
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:14,190
Really? Really really?

531
00:45:14,190 --> 00:45:16,520
Yay!

532
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:18,690
You little... Since yesterday, you can't read the mood.

533
00:45:18,690 --> 00:45:21,020
What mood? I'm totally celebrating now.

534
00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:23,680
I'm transferring!

535
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:26,830
You're making fun of me right now, aren't you?

536
00:45:26,830 --> 00:45:29,060
I'm home!

537
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:35,990
Oh my eyes! The instant I saw it,  it's peed-my-pants class.

538
00:45:35,990 --> 00:45:37,890
Im Ju Yeong, do you want to die?

539
00:45:37,890 --> 00:45:40,270
Why would you kill my precious son?

540
00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:42,050
Why?

541
00:45:48,650 --> 00:45:51,110
"Korean Ghost Stories?"

542
00:45:52,570 --> 00:45:55,070
If I go to school like this...

543
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:09,020
  Is my makeup really weird? 

544
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:13,430
  Before I transfer, I want to escape being an outcast. Help me. 

545
00:46:13,430 --> 00:46:14,520
  Please, no. 

546
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:16,400
  - Is that not a ghost? 
 - Fix your eyebrows first. 

547
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:19,070
  Thought it was a pine caterpillar. 

548
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:25,490
I guess it does look like a pine caterpillar.

549
00:46:25,490 --> 00:46:27,560
  Look at the third most popular post right now. It'll help. 

550
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:29,950
Third most popular post?

551
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:34,490
  Hi, beautifuls! I'll show you how to make your eyes twice as big. 

552
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:37,600
 One, two, three. 

553
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:42,000
  Shoot a handsome guy's heart 

554
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,550
Heol. Daebak.

555
00:46:48,250 --> 00:46:51,910
Alright. This is it!

556
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:04,450
Although this was a huge deal to my parents, nearly causing them a divorce,

557
00:47:04,450 --> 00:47:09,360
to me, this was a hopeful light opening up a new life.

581
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:43,750
  The finishing touch of makeup is the lips. 

582
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:46,520
  I'm going to be using this tint. 

583
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:51,970
  How is this, Selebies? Have you been reborn to a new me? 

584
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:54,330
"New Me?"

585
00:48:54,330 --> 00:48:58,650
  Then, from now on, just trust in Selena and follow me! 
   

586
00:49:33,190 --> 00:49:35,280
What do I do?

587
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:38,670
What do I do? No!

588
00:49:38,670 --> 00:49:40,440
I'm going to draw on it, anyway.

589
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:43,930
It's fine. Calm down, calm down.

590
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:47,020
Are you not packing up?

591
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:50,640
What the heck has she been doing for the past few days?

592
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:52,730
Focus!

593
00:50:29,740 --> 00:50:32,230
Amazing!

594
00:50:42,670 --> 00:50:44,790
"You are the Devil."

595
00:50:46,390 --> 00:50:48,470
- "You are the Devil." 
 - What?

596
00:50:48,470 --> 00:50:50,800
- The new volume is out, right? 
 - Oh!

597
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:53,850
It was just placed in the horror section.

598
00:50:53,850 --> 00:50:56,330
It's been a while since you've been here.

599
00:50:56,330 --> 00:50:59,610
It's been ten years, but you're still the same.

600
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:09,050
The first page has been torn.

601
00:51:09,050 --> 00:51:10,480
What?

602
00:51:16,060 --> 00:51:19,110
- I think the first borrower tore this... 
 - Why?

603
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:24,320
That is truly disgusting.

604
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:29,110
But, Student, can't you skip the first page and start with the next?

605
00:51:29,110 --> 00:51:31,970
Even if you skip a page, it shouldn't affect your comprehension.

606
00:51:31,970 --> 00:51:36,940
Mister, when you sing the national anthem, do you skip the first verse and start from the second?

607
00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:40,790
When you watch a soccer game, do you skip the first half and start from the second half?

608
00:51:40,790 --> 00:51:43,060
I guess you can start living earnestly in February instead of January.

609
00:51:43,060 --> 00:51:45,090
Obstinately living on after you get old is not a problem.

610
00:51:45,090 --> 00:51:48,310
Student, you are right. I will place a new order right now.

611
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:55,520
Definitely nothing has changed.

612
00:52:00,250 --> 00:52:03,830
Ju Gyeong? Ju Gyeong, wake up! We're almost there.

613
00:52:03,830 --> 00:52:06,060
Oh, okay.

614
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:40,520
What do I do?

615
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:55,070
I'm sorry...

616
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:14,630
 Put on chocolate brown contact lenses. 

617
00:53:17,140 --> 00:53:21,130
 Shade the eyelids with a light brown eyeshadow to make it look deeper. 

618
00:53:21,130 --> 00:53:23,620
 And wrap it up by tapping eyeshadow along the lower eyelid 

619
00:53:23,620 --> 00:53:27,100
 to give the eyes a widening effect. 

620
00:53:27,110 --> 00:53:29,980
  Student ID Card 
 Im Ju Gyeong 

621
00:53:31,230 --> 00:53:35,070
 The makeup style for a good first impression is complete! 

622
00:53:39,770 --> 00:53:42,950
Gosh, this house. We made so much effort to escape this place.

623
00:53:42,950 --> 00:53:47,540
If you think you're a step ahead, it's an Amitabha vain effort. It's nearly eight years.

624
00:53:47,540 --> 00:53:50,700
It's more like eight years of rejuvenation for our Madam Hong.

625
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:54,000
- What? 
 - She's right, Hyeon Suk. It's nice to be back.

626
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,140
It's romantic when I think back to our newlywed days.

627
00:53:56,140 --> 00:53:58,210
Romance has frozen to death.

628
00:53:58,210 --> 00:54:00,720
Im Ju Gyeong! Eat if you've come down.

629
00:54:08,860 --> 00:54:10,710
I'm not hungry, so I'm not eating.

630
00:54:10,710 --> 00:54:13,250
If you're not hungry then...

631
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:14,770
Who are you?

632
00:54:14,770 --> 00:54:16,100
What?

633
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:18,480
See you later!

634
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:26,200
Who is she? So pretty!

635
00:54:26,230 --> 00:54:29,200
I haven't seen her before.

636
00:54:33,740 --> 00:54:37,450
Wow, so pretty! I'm jealous.

637
00:54:37,450 --> 00:54:41,440
So pretty!

638
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:44,550
 Saebom High School 
 Im Ju Gyeong 

639
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:51,330
- She's so pretty! 
 - She's a goddess!

640
00:54:58,300 --> 00:55:00,250
 Did he say 

641
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:03,590
 I am a goddess? 

642
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:12,980
Yeah, she's really pretty.

643
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:23,400
Where's the teachers' office?

644
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:36,070
Wow, what is this?

645
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:44,340
  Look at you, acting so modest. 

646
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:46,300
  And you're acting like a model student.   

647
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:47,600
 - What, what! 
 - Shut up! 

648
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:51,470
It's not far from where you used to live, but you're still adapting, right?

649
00:55:51,470 --> 00:55:54,120
I lived here until I was ten years old, so it's okay.

650
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:56,360
That's a relief.

651
00:55:56,360 --> 00:56:00,500
Alright, from now on you're a Saebom High School student.

652
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:01,960
Okay.

653
00:56:04,330 --> 00:56:05,480
 Im Ju Gyeong 
 Saebom High School 

654
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:10,090
I heard a top student transferred to our school!

655
00:56:10,090 --> 00:56:14,110
It's this student!

656
00:56:14,110 --> 00:56:16,950
Let me see, let me see.

657
00:56:16,950 --> 00:56:20,020
I can tell you're the type that's good at studying.

658
00:56:20,020 --> 00:56:22,090
 All Cs, below average.   

659
00:56:23,100 --> 00:56:27,980
This is not it. Oh my! You must be the top student!

660
00:56:27,980 --> 00:56:33,000
Let me look at you. You have the face of an A-student!

661
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,480
We will be going now.

662
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:36,910
Okay, okay! Go to class and introduce yourself.

663
00:56:36,910 --> 00:56:40,290
He's the vice principal. Don't pay too much attention to what he said.

664
00:56:40,290 --> 00:56:43,340
- There are more important things in life than grades. 
 - Okay.

665
00:56:43,340 --> 00:56:48,930
Aigoo! The top student from the second year is here. No wonder the room suddenly got brighter.

666
00:56:48,930 --> 00:56:51,410
He's so handsome!

667
00:56:52,770 --> 00:56:57,010
Look at this. Even the way he greets is so charming.

668
00:56:57,010 --> 00:56:59,380
- Here it is, Mr. Han. 
 - Thanks.

669
00:56:59,380 --> 00:57:01,590
 Where have I heard that voice before? 

670
00:57:01,590 --> 00:57:04,440
- Please ask the class president to do this next time.
- Got it.

671
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:07,670
 I have never seen someone born as a face genius like that. 

672
00:57:07,670 --> 00:57:12,400
Su Ho, this is our class' new transfer student.

673
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:14,310
Can you take her to the classroom?

674
00:57:14,310 --> 00:57:17,360
Her? Me?

675
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:21,450
Yes. Her. You.

676
00:57:24,110 --> 00:57:27,530
- Follow him. 
 - Oh, yes.

677
00:57:27,530 --> 00:57:29,710
Wait up!

678
00:57:29,710 --> 00:57:33,310
 Top of the class with that physique. 

679
00:57:33,310 --> 00:57:34,860
 I knew the world was not fair. 

680
00:57:34,860 --> 00:57:37,400
Excuse me. Oppa!

681
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:44,210
 Damn.  The foundation isn't supposed to smudge! 

682
00:57:44,210 --> 00:57:47,670
Are we blood-related?  Why am I your oppa?

683
00:57:47,670 --> 00:57:50,060
Oppa— No, Sunbae, if you have some time—

684
00:57:50,060 --> 00:57:51,040
I don't.

685
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:54,640
It'll be short. I have something to say!

686
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:57,520
- You have three seconds. 
 - What? 
 -  One...

687
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:00,710
- Oppa– No, Sunbae— I've liked you for a long time! 
- Two... three. Time's up.

688
00:58:00,710 --> 00:58:04,080
- I don't like you. 
 - Please take this!

689
00:58:06,110 --> 00:58:07,900
 Lee Su Ho  

690
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:20,460
Excuse me. Wait! Oh my god...

691
00:58:20,460 --> 00:58:24,260
 My face. Isn't my makeup a mess? 

692
00:58:25,620 --> 00:58:27,670
One, two.

693
00:58:30,380 --> 00:58:33,520
- Hi, Su Ho. 
 - Oh, you're here?

694
00:58:34,340 --> 00:58:39,120
Hey, wait, wait! What's that? Is that a fashion trend?

695
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:41,320
That is so hip!

696
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:44,910
What's on Su Ho's back?  Isn't there makeup on it?

697
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:54,190
 Luckily, the eye makeup didn't rub off. 

698
00:59:03,330 --> 00:59:07,720
Hey! Why is he like that?

699
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:14,150
I just bought this too.

700
00:59:15,710 --> 00:59:18,740
This is the new transfer student in our class, Im Ju Gyeong.

701
00:59:18,740 --> 00:59:21,170
Ju Gyeong, can you introduce yourself?

702
00:59:21,170 --> 00:59:22,940
Hi. Nice to meet you...

703
00:59:22,940 --> 00:59:25,800
You're so pretty!

704
00:59:27,930 --> 00:59:30,660
 Things are different now that I'm pretty. 

705
00:59:30,660 --> 00:59:33,700
 Including the way they look at me. 

706
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:37,440
 Except for one person. 

707
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:41,610
Okay! The visual average for our class went up!

708
00:59:41,610 --> 00:59:44,330
Hyeon Gyu. Ahn Hyeon Gyu, don't say things like that.

709
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:47,520
To me, you are all beautiful.

710
00:59:47,530 --> 00:59:50,770
Beautiful from afar. Even more up close.

711
00:59:50,770 --> 00:59:52,500
Mr. Han, that's so cheesy!

712
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:55,810
You all don't know how beautiful you are.

713
00:59:55,810 --> 00:59:59,690
Being at the age of 18 itself is beautiful and thrilling.

714
00:59:59,690 --> 01:00:02,600
So don't forcefully get all dolled up, especially Su Ah.

715
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:03,730
What?

716
01:00:03,730 --> 01:00:07,450
Mr. Han, you are too serious!

717
01:00:09,830 --> 01:00:13,810
Ju Gyeong, you can sit next to Su Ho.

718
01:00:15,410 --> 01:00:17,970
Ah, my eye sight is a bit bad, though.

719
01:00:17,970 --> 01:00:21,320
Oh, really?  Then, although it's the seat of the student on leave,

720
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:23,660
you can sit behind Su Ah.  Is that alright?

721
01:00:23,660 --> 01:00:25,100
Yes.

722
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:32,040
What's period one again? It's my class, right? Open your books.

723
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:34,150
Okay.

724
01:00:35,890 --> 01:00:39,540
Do you remember the Chungrokpa poets  from last class? 
  (Three poets in the 1940's) 

725
01:00:39,540 --> 01:00:40,780
No~

726
01:00:40,780 --> 01:00:44,520
Of course you don't remember. Now, Chungrokpa ...

727
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:47,700
In the quest for human aspirations and values through the subject of nature,

728
01:00:47,700 --> 01:00:50,050
- Here. 
 - Thank you. 
 - these poets had a similar poetic tendencies.

729
01:00:50,050 --> 01:00:57,630
These three poets, Park Doo Jin, Park Mok Wol, and Jo Ji Hoon, made their first book, "The Chungrokpa (Turquoise) Collection."

730
01:00:59,130 --> 01:01:02,620
Good job. Remember to do your homework.

731
01:01:02,620 --> 01:01:04,660
Thank you!

732
01:01:04,670 --> 01:01:06,720
 So awkward... 

733
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:09,490
I saw you at the main entrance this morning.

734
01:01:09,490 --> 01:01:10,640
You did?

735
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:13,120
Hi, transfer student.

736
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:14,300
Hi.

737
01:01:14,300 --> 01:01:16,390
What's your number? Put it in.

738
01:01:16,390 --> 01:01:18,390
Okay.

739
01:01:18,390 --> 01:01:20,410
Are you on social media? What's your ID?

740
01:01:20,410 --> 01:01:22,180
I don't use it though.

741
01:01:22,180 --> 01:01:24,910
Why not? Are you trying to be mysterious?

742
01:01:24,910 --> 01:01:28,850
If you use it, I think you'll have a lot of followers.

743
01:01:28,850 --> 01:01:32,280
Your lip color is so pretty. What tint are you using?

744
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:36,460
Really? I'm using...

745
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:49,080
 So pretty. It doesn't look like she put on makeup either. 

746
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:50,780
Here.

747
01:01:51,740 --> 01:01:53,640
Thank you.

748
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:55,740
Kang Su, you're here?

749
01:01:55,740 --> 01:01:58,760
This is my best friend Kang Su Jin. She is our school's goddess, according to me.

750
01:01:58,770 --> 01:02:01,940
It might change now that Ju Gyeong is here. Be careful, Kang Su.

751
01:02:01,940 --> 01:02:04,500
Stop hitting my butt.

752
01:02:04,510 --> 01:02:07,010
Your name is Ju Gyeong? Nice to meet you.

753
01:02:07,010 --> 01:02:08,230
Nice to meet you too.

754
01:02:08,230 --> 01:02:12,110
You're really pretty. Are you a trainee under a company somewhere?

755
01:02:12,110 --> 01:02:15,840
She talks a lot, right? Please be understanding.

756
01:02:15,860 --> 01:02:18,150
No, it's okay.

757
01:02:19,150 --> 01:02:23,230
How can he just throw it at my face even though it's my fault?

758
01:02:23,270 --> 01:02:26,580
I'll just wash it for you.

759
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:33,020
Oh? Why isn't it coming off?

760
01:02:34,730 --> 01:02:39,810
Oh no! It's waterproof. What to do?

761
01:02:39,810 --> 01:02:42,860
I'm going crazy.

762
01:02:47,380 --> 01:02:49,060
I'm sorry.

763
01:02:50,730 --> 01:02:54,020
About your jacket, I'll take it to a cleaner...

764
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:55,890
Throw it away.

765
01:02:55,890 --> 01:02:57,860
How can you just throw this away?

766
01:02:57,860 --> 01:03:00,840
I'll get it cleaned at a cleaner and return it to you.

767
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:04,000
Ju Gyeong, what's with Lee Su Ho?

768
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:09,320
I accidentally got something on his jacket, but he said to just throw it away.

769
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:11,140
He's being a jerk again.

770
01:03:11,140 --> 01:03:14,690
He's like that. He's super good-looking but is a sociopath.

771
01:03:14,690 --> 01:03:16,570
Really?

772
01:03:16,570 --> 01:03:18,380
 I guess he's a jerk. 

773
01:03:18,380 --> 01:03:21,560
- Ju Gyeong, our dumpling... 
 - Oh, I'll go get it.

774
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:26,380
No, let's go buy it together.

775
01:03:26,380 --> 01:03:29,190
- Together? 
 - Yeah.

776
01:03:31,740 --> 01:03:34,130
Are you latching onto Ju Gyeong so she won't find any friends?

777
01:03:34,130 --> 01:03:37,510
Why not? Ju Gyeong is mine from now on.

778
01:03:37,510 --> 01:03:40,600
Su Ah, your ability to make friends is amazing.

779
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:44,350
By the way, what do you like, Ju Gyeong?

780
01:03:44,350 --> 01:03:48,180
 I like heavy metal and horror comics, but... 

781
01:03:48,180 --> 01:03:49,430
Books and music.

782
01:03:49,430 --> 01:03:51,990
What kind of music? I'm a big Eighteen fan. 
  (TN: There is a K-pop group called Seventeen.) 

783
01:03:51,990 --> 01:03:53,730
I also love spicy food.

784
01:03:53,730 --> 01:03:55,870
I love spicy food too.

785
01:03:55,870 --> 01:03:57,710
Really? Nice!

786
01:03:57,710 --> 01:04:00,670
Do you want to go eat spicy rice cakes after school today?

787
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:02,990
To commemorate the beginning of our friendship.

788
01:04:03,950 --> 01:04:07,700
Sure, that sounds good. Friends.

789
01:04:07,700 --> 01:04:13,770
- Du Jin too? 
 - Sure, but it's Su Jin, not Du Jin.

790
01:04:13,770 --> 01:04:16,910
Alright, alright, Ms. Second-Place.

791
01:04:16,910 --> 01:04:19,760
Lee Su Ho and she are first and second place in school.

792
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:22,340
She should've done only one thing to be pretty, but she's also good at studying.

793
01:04:22,340 --> 01:04:24,760
Are you also good at studying?

794
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:26,580
I'm not good at it.

795
01:04:26,580 --> 01:04:31,710
Perfect. Ju Gyeong can just be pretty like me.

796
01:04:31,710 --> 01:04:33,810
 I'm not pretty though.   

797
01:04:33,810 --> 01:04:36,510
- Su Ah, you need to study too. 
 - Why?

798
01:04:36,510 --> 01:04:37,810
Let me tell you.

799
01:04:37,810 --> 01:04:41,150
No.

800
01:04:41,150 --> 01:04:43,350
Ju Gyeong, let's study together.

801
01:04:45,590 --> 01:04:47,150
Done. We can eat now.

802
01:04:47,150 --> 01:04:48,830
- Okay. 
 - I'll eat well.

803
01:04:52,100 --> 01:04:53,040
How is it?

804
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:56,010
- It's so good. 
 - Right? So delicious!

805
01:04:59,690 --> 01:05:01,780
But it's a bit spicy.

806
01:05:03,250 --> 01:05:05,080
Come on, Su Jin. Just once!

807
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:07,920
I can't. I need to go to my tutoring session.

808
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:09,250
Ten minutes. Just ten minutes!

809
01:05:09,250 --> 01:05:10,860
My mom is going to scold me!

810
01:05:10,860 --> 01:05:12,320
Then just five minutes! Let's go together.

811
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:15,240
I don't even have five minutes!

812
01:05:18,290 --> 01:05:20,270
Ju Gyeong, we're going to do everything here today.

813
01:05:20,270 --> 01:05:22,440
Su Jin, let's go!

814
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:26,950
 Life is level 0 
 Game is level 10000 

815
01:05:26,950 --> 01:05:28,550
You see this? I'm first!

816
01:05:28,550 --> 01:05:29,930
How come I can't even get one?

817
01:05:29,930 --> 01:05:31,540
♫  Ooh, ooh~  ♫

818
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:36,530
♫  I'm in the mood for dancing, romancing  ♫

819
01:05:36,530 --> 01:05:40,600
♫  Ooh, I'm giving it all tonight  ♫

820
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:44,190
♫ I'm in the mood for chancin' ♫

821
01:05:44,190 --> 01:05:46,370

822
01:05:46,370 --> 01:05:49,610

824
01:05:54,390 --> 01:05:57,680
♫  So let the music play.  ♫

825
01:05:57,680 --> 01:06:03,100
♫  Ooh, I'm dancin'. I'm in the groove, Babe  ♫

826
01:06:03,100 --> 01:06:04,650

827
01:06:04,650 --> 01:06:08,650
We're so cute! It's starting.

828
01:06:08,650 --> 01:06:11,850
 Look here 

829
01:06:11,850 --> 01:06:14,200
Is this your first time? You look into here.

830
01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:16,660
Oh, there?

831
01:06:16,660 --> 01:06:18,890
♫ Take me again   ♫

01:06:23,500 --> 01:06:31,000
♫  So dance, yeah, let's dance, come on and dance  ♫

835
01:06:31,040 --> 01:06:36,700
 Back then, what I couldn't have no matter the effort I put in... 

836
01:06:37,720 --> 01:06:40,070
 Friends. 

837
01:06:41,530 --> 01:06:45,150
 I found friends. 

838
01:07:02,620 --> 01:07:04,470
Get up.

839
01:07:30,530 --> 01:07:33,790
Why are you going so hard, even though it's been a while?

840
01:07:33,790 --> 01:07:36,650
I just wanted to sleep soundly tonight.

841
01:07:36,650 --> 01:07:38,530
You can't sleep again?

842
01:07:39,650 --> 01:07:42,310
It seems like it's getting worse these days.

843
01:07:45,180 --> 01:07:49,160
Then I'll make you pass out today.

844
01:07:53,750 --> 01:07:56,560
I won't pass out just from this!

845
01:08:16,320 --> 01:08:18,240
 My friend Su Ah invited My friend Su Jin and Im Ju Gyeong 

846
01:08:18,240 --> 01:08:20,640
 Did you two get back okay? 

847
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:23,760
Is this what I've heard about?

848
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:26,900
Chat room?

849
01:08:28,840 --> 01:08:31,210
I got invited to a chat room!

850
01:08:31,210 --> 01:08:33,540
 Did you two get back okay? 

851
01:08:33,540 --> 01:08:36,080
 Yup! You too, Su Jin? 

852
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:37,960
 Kang Su doesn't check messages often. Don't mind her. 

853
01:08:37,960 --> 01:08:42,380
 Haha. Oh yeah! I got instagram. My ID is  imzoo00_. 

854
01:08:42,380 --> 01:08:44,020
 Awesome! I'll follow you right away. 

855
01:08:44,020 --> 01:08:46,480
 - I'm at tutoring. 
 - Here are today's photos. 

856
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:49,200
 Tell me which ones you don't like. 

857
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:07,710
- Im Ju Yeong, what are you doing? 
 - Wow!

858
01:09:07,710 --> 01:09:11,790
You are my sister, but I can't believe how ugly you are.

859
01:09:11,790 --> 01:09:15,680
- What? 
 - Everyone is calling you a goddess.

860
01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:17,900
Should I pass this photo around?

861
01:09:17,900 --> 01:09:20,580
Im Ju Yeong, delete that right now!

862
01:09:20,580 --> 01:09:23,280
Come here! I swear!

863
01:09:23,280 --> 01:09:25,250
- You want this? 
 - Delete it!

864
01:09:25,250 --> 01:09:28,850
Delete it! Delete it. Seriously!

865
01:09:28,850 --> 01:09:30,560
- You! 
 - "You!"

866
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:31,880
- I'm going to kill you. 
 - "I'm going to kill you."

867
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:34,790
What? It looks just like you.

868
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:37,180
Are you looking for this?

869
01:09:37,180 --> 01:09:40,860
Too slow. Left? Right?

870
01:09:40,860 --> 01:09:41,950
Let go!

871
01:09:41,950 --> 01:09:43,820
Die!

872
01:09:45,690 --> 01:09:50,820
Hey, young one, act like a gentleman.

873
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:19,410
 I got chills. 

874
01:10:19,410 --> 01:10:23,090
 Sharp daggers pierce my heart. 

875
01:10:23,090 --> 01:10:25,300
 But don't worry. 

876
01:10:25,300 --> 01:10:28,630
 Hands are faster than the eyes. 

877
01:10:30,690 --> 01:10:32,630
Let go!

878
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:35,500
 Please enter password. 

879
01:10:35,500 --> 01:10:38,610
Do I look like I'm going to give it to your for nothing?

880
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:46,390
What do you want?

881
01:10:46,390 --> 01:10:48,710
The new volume of "You are the Devil."

882
01:10:48,710 --> 01:10:50,860
Will you delete it then?

883
01:10:50,860 --> 01:10:52,670
We'll see about that.

884
01:10:52,670 --> 01:10:54,100
You want to lose a hand?

885
01:10:54,100 --> 01:10:57,390
Which picture should I upload?

886
01:10:57,390 --> 01:10:59,200
Don't!

887
01:11:07,320 --> 01:11:10,830
I'll double it.

888
01:11:13,330 --> 01:11:17,370
New volume plus ramen, okay?

889
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:20,240
Okay.

890
01:11:27,490 --> 01:11:33,770
♫   Our time might still   ♫

891
01:11:33,770 --> 01:11:40,800
♫   be left, even just a moment   ♫

892
01:11:41,630 --> 01:11:42,700
♫   At some point,  ♫

893
01:11:42,700 --> 01:11:44,970
What a relief.

894
01:11:44,970 --> 01:11:53,590
♫   your expectations became my support  ♫

895
01:11:53,590 --> 01:11:56,940
♫  How do you do?  ♫

896
01:11:57,990 --> 01:12:00,660
 I just followed you. I see you uploaded a picture. 

897
01:12:00,660 --> 01:12:02,580
 Wow, your likes are amazing for just starting. 

898
01:12:02,580 --> 01:12:04,610
 Really? 

899
01:12:04,610 --> 01:12:06,670
 - Let's be insta friends. 
 - Wow, a total goddess! 

900
01:12:06,670 --> 01:12:08,650
 - Please follow me back. 
 - Is this true?  You're so pretty! 

901
01:12:08,650 --> 01:12:10,510
More than 100 likes?

902
01:12:10,510 --> 01:12:12,650
 You're so pretty! 

903
01:12:12,650 --> 01:12:17,610
A goddess. No way.

904
01:12:21,660 --> 01:12:24,240
What if there's someone from school?

905
01:12:29,490 --> 01:12:32,390
 Prince Comics 

906
01:12:34,250 --> 01:12:36,870
This place is the same.

907
01:12:36,870 --> 01:12:39,740
I wonder if the owner is still here.

908
01:12:47,240 --> 01:12:50,060
It feels the same as before.

909
01:12:50,060 --> 01:12:51,950
Welcome.

910
01:12:51,950 --> 01:12:55,420
Mister! You're still here.

911
01:12:55,420 --> 01:12:57,330
Who are you?

912
01:12:57,330 --> 01:12:59,020
Do you remember me?

913
01:12:59,020 --> 01:13:00,530
Im Ju  Bal?

914
01:13:00,530 --> 01:13:02,290
Yes!

915
01:13:02,290 --> 01:13:03,960
You're here!

916
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:08,250
I heard that Pandora's owner  (Ju Gyeong's mom)  would move back. How long has it been?

917
01:13:08,250 --> 01:13:09,920
It's been about eight years.

918
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:12,040
Has it already been that long?

919
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:14,780
When did that little kid grow up!

920
01:13:14,780 --> 01:13:16,680
The ugly Ju Bal.

921
01:13:16,680 --> 01:13:18,920
I'm saying you're cute!

922
01:13:27,850 --> 01:13:30,040
This one is good.

923
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:34,760
The smell of comics.

924
01:13:37,850 --> 01:13:41,120
My doodle is still here!

925
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:45,990
 Im Ju Gyeong's spot. 
Sitting without permission  will cause hair to grow on your butt! 

926
01:13:49,420 --> 01:13:51,250
This is it.

927
01:13:51,250 --> 01:13:54,570
There is no other place with more horror books than here.

928
01:13:57,520 --> 01:14:00,800
Where is it?

929
01:14:02,660 --> 01:14:05,150
Oh! I found it!

930
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:20,890
I got here first.

931
01:14:20,890 --> 01:14:23,520
I grabbed it first.

932
01:14:36,090 --> 01:14:40,370
 You are the Devil 

933
01:14:52,660 --> 01:14:54,740
 Lee Su Ho? 

934
01:14:56,270 --> 01:14:58,190
You...

935
01:14:58,190 --> 01:15:00,370
 I'm screwed. 

936
01:15:09,210 --> 01:15:16,230


937
01:15:16,230 --> 01:15:24,330
♫  Yeah, yeah.  I'm in the mood for dancing, romancin'  ♫

938
01:15:24,330 --> 01:15:27,620
♫  Ooh, I'm giving it up tonight  ♫

939
01:15:27,620 --> 01:15:31,250
♫  I'm in the mood for chancin'  ♫

940
01:15:31,250 --> 01:15:33,540
♫  I feel like dancing,   ♫

941
01:15:33,540 --> 01:15:36,560
♫  Ooh, so come on and hold me tight.  ♫

942
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:39,420
♫  I feel like dancing.  ♫

943
01:15:39,420 --> 01:15:42,610
 True Beauty 

944
01:15:42,610 --> 01:15:48,190
 He must not be able to recognize me. 

945
01:15:48,190 --> 01:15:49,920
 If he recognizes me, 

946
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:51,230
 Did you wrong me in some way? 

947
01:15:51,230 --> 01:15:54,800
 He will not spread any rumors out of pity, won't he?

01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:56,710
 Hey, have we seen each other before? 

949
01:15:56,710 --> 01:15:58,930
 How do these ridiculous coincidences keep happening? 

950
01:15:58,930 --> 01:16:01,240
 Are you dating Lee Su Ho? 

951
01:16:01,240 --> 01:16:04,450
 - Right now?
- You have something for me. Bring it out. 

952
01:16:04,450 --> 01:16:06,460
 Bare-face Im Ju Gyeong? Im Ju Gyeong with makeup? 

953
01:16:06,460 --> 01:16:09,950
 I have no idea what is he saying I should bring.
