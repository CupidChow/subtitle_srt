1
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:05,150
 True Beauty 

2
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:19,960


3
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:32,520
 True Beauty 

4
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm okay. You didn't have to walk me home.

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,330
Because today it's a man to a woman?

6
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:44,090
If you were a friend, I wouldn't have walked you home.

7
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,880
Don't you think you live in an area with too many stations?

8
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,550
What are you saying? It's so far from a bus station.

9
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:56,420
No, it only takes a short time.

10
00:00:56,420 --> 00:01:01,250
We're here. Go back safely.

11
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:05,590
- Im Ju Gyeong. 
 - Hm?

12
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,390
I...

13
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:12,360
I'm going to use my wish.

14
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:11,760
- Seo Jun... I'm sorry. 
 - Even so, we still have one date left.

15
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,490
Go inside.

16
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:57,450
Do you still like Ju Gyeong?

17
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:59,880
Have you even confessed?

18
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:04,450
No. I'm dating Im Ju Gyeong.

19
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:08,140
I know that's not true.

20
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:11,700
What do you know?

21
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:18,910
I told you I met Ju Gyeong yesterday.

22
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:22,960
Yeah, so why was it yesterday? Of all days, why?

23
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:27,040
- Because the first snow came. 
 - What are you saying?

24
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,950
But it's not like that, right?

25
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:32,630
You must be anxious.

26
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:39,300
- I'm not. 
 - This jerk, seriously.

27
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,710
Even so, how could you hug her?

28
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:24,800
 We broke up. I didn't miss you. 

29
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:08,630
- You woke up? 
 - Yeah.

30
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:11,660
Who gave you these flowers? Did you get a boyfriend?

31
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:13,910
No, it's not like that.

32
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:18,290
I noticed it in the room and brought it outside in case it wilts.

33
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:20,900
I forgot.

34
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:28,590
Flowers, when put in a vase like this, are pretty.

35
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:32,700
But if they wilt without anybody looking, it's quite sad and pitiful.

36
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:43,460
 Move Entertainment 

37
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,320
  To Han Seo Jun: Are you really busy? 

38
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,870
 I'm at your company right now. 

39
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:51,730
 After you practice, let's see each other for a bit. 

40
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:54,660
 I'll be waiting in the lobby. 

41
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,390
Han Seo Jun.

42
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:22,090
You should have left if there wasn't a reply.

43
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,720
How many hours have you been waiting?

44
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:27,160
That... You see...

45
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,820
Yeah, I'm here. So what?

46
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:33,280
Have you eaten? Do you want to eat with me?

47
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,770
Did you come here to date? I'm a bit busy today.

48
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:38,850
It's because I have something to say.

49
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:40,960
Save the talk for later.

50
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,430
I'm a bit busy today, so I don't have time for a date.

51
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:46,950
But let's call it even with this.

52
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,800
Seo Jun...

53
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:13,550
- Oh, did you know that Lee Su Ho is taking a night flight back to America today? 
 - What?

54
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:19,360
I think he said something about him coming here for a short time to sort out some stuff after his father woke up.

55
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,120
If you're going to say bye to him, you probably need to hurry and go.

56
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,810
Hey. What are you standing there for?

57
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:29,670
You need to go quickly, so you don't lose him.

58
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:35,850
Go. Hurry and go. Go.

59
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,960
Take care.

60
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:46,210
 What's this? 

61
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:48,700
 Why are you studying that hard when you usually don't? 

62
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:52,640
 Hurry and blow it. I won't sing though. 

63
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,740
 ♫ Happy birthday to you 

64
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,740
 ♫ Happy birthday to you 

65
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:07,090
 I thought you said you weren't going to sing. 

66
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:12,200
 - Hey, Im Ju Gyeong. 
 - Huh? 

67
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,010
 What number are you going to pick when you don't know the answer? 

68
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:17,730
 Uh, number three? 

69
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:22,910
 Then it looks like I'll only be picking numbers other than number three. Wait. 

70
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:25,470
 Here. 

71
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:27,390
Don't be nervous and take it well.

72
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:30,590
 Thank you. Oh yeah. 

73
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:35,750
 Here. Good luck on your exam too. 

74
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,770
 Yeah. 

75
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,480
 Okay, I'm taking the picture. One, two, three! 

76
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,280
 You guys are acting like you're at a funeral. 

77
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:54,400
 Okay, okay. Cutely, cutely! 

78
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:57,170
 - One, two, three! 
 - Good bye, Saebom High! 

79
00:09:57,170 --> 00:10:01,230
 Hey Im Ju Gyeong, why aren't you taking a picture with me? 

80
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:03,050
  Do you not know when you should butt in and when to butt out? 

81
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:06,530
 Okay, okay. I'll take a picture of you two, so stand over here. 

82
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:08,290
 Stand there. 

83
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:10,990
 Smile! Smile. 

84
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:12,610
 - Affectionately. 
 - Affectionately. 

85
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:16,240
 One, two, three! 

86
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:25,440
 Hey! Do it properly. Okay, one, two, three! 

87
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:51,110
 Lee Su Ho is taking a night flight back to America today. 

88
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:05,690
 Bicycle Crossing 

89
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:21,750
Taxi!

90
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:24,130
Taxi!

91
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:43,400
Hey, Lee Su Ho! Su Ho. Lee Su Ho!

92
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,360
Did you perhaps already leave?

93
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:51,780
You jerk. If you were going to leave again like this, why did you come back?

94
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:54,780
Why follow me around?

95
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:02,860
Ju Gyeong...

96
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:09,120
Don't go.

97
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:18,630
I said don't go.

98
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:23,180
I won't let you go, so don't leave.

99
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:29,840
I'm not going... anywhere.

100
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:32,630
You better not leave.

101
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:37,100
So don't cry.

102
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:52,090
- Don't go. 
 - I won't.

103
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:59,750
I was pretending to not, but I felt like I was going crazy because of anxiety.

104
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:03,280
- About what? 
 - That you...

105
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:07,230
- would say that you would never see me. 
 - Lies.

106
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:09,580
I'm for real.

107
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:13,740
- You were going to leave today. 
 - What are you saying?

108
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:16,690
I heard you were going back to America tonight.

109
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:20,120
- Why would I? 
 - What's with that suitcase?

110
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,900
I was organizing my luggage earlier.

111
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:25,740
What are you saying? Han Seo Jun said you were returning...

112
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:29,200
Han Seo Jun said that?

113
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:38,440
- Th-That is ... 
 - So then did you run here because you thought I was returning to the US?

114
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:41,450
- No, that's not—
 - To hold on to me?

115
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:44,160
- That's not it! 
 - Im Ju Gyeong.

116
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,250
Im Ju Gyeong!

117
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,840
- Why are you running away? 
 - What "running away"?

118
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,480
Didn't you come to see me?

119
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,120
I have to go home.

120
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,350
There is something very important to do at home.

121
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:59,470
You're going the wrong way.

122
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:04,750
I'll give you a ride.

123
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,180
Do you hate me?

124
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:13,960
Are you not going to show me your face?

125
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,440
You were going to come back.

126
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,950
If you were going to come back like this,

127
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:23,710
why did you do that back then?

128
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:26,010
Waiting for me...

129
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:29,990
I was afraid it would give you a hard time.

130
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:32,800
This was so much harder for me

131
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:36,170
than waiting for you.

132
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,230
Me too.

133
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:53,530
It was really hard.

134
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:57,620
So I also...

135
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:01,800
Was finding out ways to come back.

136
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,480
Even if Dad didn't wake up,

137
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:08,550
I would have returned to you.

138
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:11,240
What if I forgot about you?

139
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,550
Then I would've followed you around.

140
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:16,610
But if I still said that I didn't like you?

141
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:19,470
Then I'd try begging while crying,

142
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:22,020
and I'd also try seducing you.

143
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,490
Ju Gyeong...

144
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,820
Look at me.

145
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:32,680
For giving you a hard time...

146
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:37,360
I'm sorry.

147
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,350
What are you sorry for?

148
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,780
I understand how you feel.

149
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:48,250
I know it all, but seeing your face...

150
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:51,090
reminded me of all those painful memories only.

151
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:55,000
- I'm also sorry about hurting you. 
 - You must also have been hurting.

152
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,610
How hard it must have been for you in that far place.

153
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:01,760
Without other family members...

154
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:05,140
Alone in the hospital, unable to do anything.

155
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:07,800
You must have been hurting a lot.

156
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,620
I was so worried that I wanted to run to you immediately, but...

157
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:17,840
What kind of money does an eighteen-year-old have?

158
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:28,830
We were too young.

159
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:31,940
- Right? 
 - Yeah.

160
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:34,640
Don't cry.

161
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:37,030
Come here.

162
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:44,180
I was surprised they were dating.

163
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:46,760
- But it's fascinating that they're marrying now. 
 - Yeah.

164
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:51,420
If it weren't someone like Mr. Han, then who could handle my sister?

165
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:02,790
- Why are you looking at me like that? 
 - Hm?

166
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:04,640
Just because...

167
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,430
It seems like you've changed a lot.

168
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:09,530
You even drive.

169
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:18,270
I still have this too.

170
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,400
You didn't throw it away.

171
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,530
It's the same.

172
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:31,150
Nothing has changed between us.

173
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:33,230
Like back then.

174
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:37,720
Exactly when back then?

175
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,720
When you were the crybaby?

176
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,870
Why do you keep calling me a crybaby when I cried only once?

177
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:44,450
But you were a crybaby.

178
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:48,350
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

179
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:50,950
I wouldn't have known if I didn't see the writings.

180
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:53,450
I was going to tell you on a special day,

181
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:55,570
but I couldn't.

182
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:58,100
You should have just told me.

183
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:02,000
Even when I was little, I liked you.

184
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:06,820
I waited in the comics store for you every day.

185
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:10,490
But it looked like it wasn't only me.

186
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:13,010
Since you still remember.

187
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:15,500
It wasn't for me.

188
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,980
I just remember you as the comics store's crybaby.

189
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,100
That's a shame.

190
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,010
Looks like it was a one-sided love.

191
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:28,080
Oh, yeah. How's the pain? Are you okay?

192
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,610
What do you mean?

193
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,320
Was there a time when I was hurting?

194
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,880
You even went to the emergency room. I'm asking if your constipation is okay.

195
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:41,120
- I'm okay. 
 - You need to exercise a lot and eat lots of dietary fiber.

196
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,200
You also need to make sure to take probiotics and drink a lot of water.

197
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,970
Your lifestyle has to also be a routine for your constipation to—

198
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:48,400
Hey! Do you have to talk about that in this atmosphere?

199
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,220
So embarrassing. It's because I'm stressed these days.

200
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:56,110
I'm usually the person who is not lazy with my bowel movement. I'm very diligent!

201
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:00,440
Drop me off. I guess I can walk as exercise.

202
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:04,300
Here, here. You can drop me off here. Drop me off there.

203
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:38,770
♫  I just don't have the courage  ♫

204
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:46,030
♫  I'm afraid it will be too much for you  ♫

205
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:55,230
♫  I'm always anxious  ♫

206
00:19:55,230 --> 00:20:01,780

207
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:05,340
♫  Fall in you  ♫

208
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:08,960
♫  I just found out  ♫

209
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:13,290
♫  Fall in you  ♫

210
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:17,460
- Hm? 
 - Are you going home?

211
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,610
- Yeah, I'm going. 
 - Are you not tired?

212
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:22,000
Not at all.

213
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,790
 Is it a bit so-so to call when you're driving? 

214
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:25,100
Do you want to call me when you're home?

215
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:28,300
No, it's okay.

216
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:32,760
I want to keep hearing your voice.

217
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:38,090
What are you doing tomorrow?

218
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,360
- Why? 
 - So I can go see you.

219
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:45,450
This is like a dream.

220
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:48,120
That I can see you tomorrow.

221
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,860
Same here.

222
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:08,940
 - Here, when we get to the chorus, hit the drums once. 
 - Yeah, you need to do it then. Gives it an explosive vibe. 

223
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:12,200
 Yeah. And then at this part, the guitar... 

224
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:16,720
 Instead of keeping it there from behind, go ahead and just go straight over it. 

225
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:20,110
 Why did you have to come out then of all times and see that? 

226
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:23,080
 Making me look pathetic... 

227
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:27,450
 - What are you talking about? 
 - Ah, I don't know. 

228
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:32,410
 Today was my last. 

229
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:36,200
 The things I couldn't do two years ago — confess and get rejected— 

230
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,900
 those... 

231
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,850
 I'm doing it now. 

232
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:10,030
Why'd you come here?

233
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:17,720
Because I'm not busy today,

234
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:20,050
I'll listen to what you were going to say yesterday.

235
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:24,030
I don't know how and what to tell you.

236
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:26,360
What do you mean?

237
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:29,380
What you want to say is written all over your face.

238
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:32,380
You've always been obvious from your face even from back then.

239
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:34,940
I can only say that I'm thankful to you...

240
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:38,140
and that I'm sorry.

241
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:40,790
Is that something to be sorry about?

242
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:43,340
I already knew everything.

243
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:45,550
That you haven't forgotten Lee Su Ho.

244
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:49,280
So don't be sorry.

245
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,460
There wasn't a gap in your heart for me to pull open and squeeze myself in.

246
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:56,970
- I was just being greedy for a moment.  
 - I'm sorry.

247
00:22:56,970 --> 00:22:59,260
Because I needlessly confessed to you,

248
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:02,050
I'm sorry for making you confused.

249
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:07,240
At least that's what I want to say. But do you think that makes sense?

250
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,660
I also had to try and confess at least once.

251
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:14,080
Back then, your younger brother told me this.

252
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:18,130
It's easier to sort out your feelings once you get rejected.

253
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,960
Don't worry. Because of my debut, things are crazy

254
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,950
and I won't be able to think about you for long.

255
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:26,170
It'll be sorted out quickly.

256
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:29,410
If you keep making that expression,

257
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:31,710
I'm going. I'm getting up.

258
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:34,030
Okay, okay. Let's hurry up and eat.

259
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:36,590
- I bought this. 
 - Okay.

260
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:52,080
Let's go.

261
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:57,400
Are you playing a trick from the first round? 
  (T/N: a quote from movie, 'Tazza') 

262
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,200
Please let go.

263
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:01,500
I'm going to bet my entire collection of aromatic candles on this hand having a dark and dirty mind.

264
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,140
What would you like to bet?

265
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:05,770
What are you two doing?

266
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:08,040
What are you doing while wearing a suit?

267
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,770
I'm worried I'll make a mistake for Hui Gyeong's bride entrance practice tomorrow.

268
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:13,860
What are you saying? She said the bride and groom entrances will be at the same time.

269
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:17,150
- Come and eat! 
 - What? No, why?

270
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:19,120
They do that a lot these days.

271
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,680
- Oh, you came again? 
 - You slept late again?

272
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:25,560
You've been coming to our house for a month. If you're going to be like that,

273
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:29,190
then you should marry~ You should marry~

274
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:30,920
Son, do you not hurt from getting hit?

275
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,730
It's true that it would be nice if we marry her off quickly.

276
00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:35,270
I can't give her to him so easily, though.

277
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:37,600
What time shall I pick you up later?

278
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,540
It's okay. You must be tired, so no need.

279
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,400
I'm okay though.

280
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:45,100
As expected, our Su Ho is tall and handsome. Young and rich.

281
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:47,210
I'm jealous. The rich and unemployed lifestyle.

282
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:49,280
You should work extremely hard on your reapplicant life.

283
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,910
I studied till dawn yesterday!

284
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:53,000
I'm more desperate than anybody. Why are you being like this?

285
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,200
Did Go Woon say she's going to wait till you get into college?

286
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,260
Will you keep saying unlucky things to this unlucky student preparing for the college exam again?

287
00:24:57,260 --> 00:25:00,550
"You"? To your older sister?

288
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:02,800
I somehow keep smelling the smell of a brother-in-law.

289
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:05,430
- Eat. 
 - Okay.

290
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:11,050
 Contest for Rookie Group's Makeup Concept Plan - Move Entertainment 

291
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:15,380
Rookie group's makeup concept?

292
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,960
Chae Ni, the recording got a bit delayed.

293
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:24,340
- Wait here. 
 - Okay.

294
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:32,700
Unni, are you dating Seo Jun?

295
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,820
No.

296
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:37,890
Of course, if Seo Jun had eyes, he would never.

297
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:41,770
Yes, because Seo Jun has eyes, he would never

298
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:43,990
just date anybody.

299
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,400
Mist.

300
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:49,860
Stop!

301
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:53,470
Is this a wet sauna or what? Spray a moderate amount.

302
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:07,750
But why do you keep taking her around?

303
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:10,750
You're only making the car cramped when she doesn't have anything to do.

304
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:12,870
She's an intern, so while I teach her—

305
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:16,190
Yeah, so why are you teaching her next to me?

306
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:19,320
Even if you take professionals with you, there wouldn't be only one or two things I wouldn't like,

307
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:23,400
but taking a beginner like her makes me annoyed. Right?

308
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,980
 How rudely she talks... 

309
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:27,720
Angelic Chae Ni, you should hold it in a bit, okay?

310
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,560
Then, because I'm hungry...

311
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,560
Go and buy me some kimbap.

312
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:36,080
Make it cheese kimbap.

313
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:48,000
I was a dumpling shuttle back in high school, and now I'm a kimbap shuttle.

314
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:55,190
Hey, hurry up!

315
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:57,350
Here you go.

316
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:03,120
What's this? Don't you know I hate cucumbers?

317
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,590
You should've gotten it without cucumbers.

318
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:08,410
I'm sorry. I didn't know you didn't like them.

319
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:09,990
Should I go get a new one?

320
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:14,490
No, just get on and take out the cucumbers. I'm dying of hunger.

321
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,650
What are you doing?

322
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:20,580
Hurry and take out the cucumbers.

323
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:23,280
You take them out.

324
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:26,200
Unni, I'm Chae Ni.

325
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,740
Should I be taking out cucumbers from kimbap?

326
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:30,400
You take them out and eat it.

327
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,920
Don't you have hands or feet?

328
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,320
Do you think I learned makeup just to take out cucumbers from kimbap?

329
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,180
Where do you think you can pull this power trip on me?

330
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:39,040
Hey, are you crazy? Do you want to get fired?

331
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,540
Rather than getting fired by you, I quit.

332
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:43,410
You freaking rude brat with ruined personality!

333
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:45,960
What? Hey! Was that all you had to say?

334
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,790
What is it? What's going on?

335
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:50,660
She is...

336
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:53,970
- There you go again.
 - Hey, what are you?

337
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:55,800
What did you do to Chae Ni?

338
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,060
Stop it, now. Chae Ni, that's enough for you too.

339
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:59,690
You keep putting on a show!

340
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:01,740
Are you nuts?

341
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:03,330
What did you just say?

342
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:05,510
Hey.

343
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:11,150
Are you a gangster? Using violence?

344
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:13,450
Kang Su Jin.

345
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:18,320
Are you okay? Are you hurt anywhere?

346
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:24,310
Have you been well?

347
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:29,170
Yeah, how about you?

348
00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:33,320
I went abroad to my aunt's with my mom when I dropped out.

349
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,180
My mom and dad got divorced.

350
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:37,240
So you're in school now?

351
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:41,090
No, I'm volunteering abroad.

352
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:43,580
I just got back from Haiti.

353
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:46,580
Oh, I see.

354
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:48,780
No wonder.

355
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:52,540
No one knew about you, so I was wondering how you were.

356
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:55,350
It's because I didn't tell anyone.

357
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:58,190
I wanted to apologize to you when I got back to Korea.

358
00:28:58,190 --> 00:29:01,630
So I asked where you worked and found you.

359
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:06,460
Ju Gyeong, I'm sorry.

360
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:09,180
It's late but I apologize.

361
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:14,110
I'm really sorry.

362
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:17,120
- I'm not saying this to be forgiven. 
 - Su Jin.

363
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:20,160
I must've been really bitter back then.

364
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:23,990
It felt like you had something that I didn't have.

365
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:26,120
And it felt like I lost again.

366
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:29,590
If I took it away and messed it up,

367
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:32,940
then I thought it would be like I won.

368
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:36,190
I always had to win against someone.

369
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:39,750
That's what I was taught.

370
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:43,710
But when I got away from my dad, I could see

371
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:47,480
how much pain I gave you.

372
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:51,780
What I had lost.

373
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:53,760
I really regretted it a lot.

374
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:57,680
So I wanted to apologize to you.

375
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:01,280
But it didn't seem like something to be done over the phone.

376
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:05,180
And I thought you'd avoid my calls.

377
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:07,650
You should've just called me.

378
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:11,710
I would've been happy to answer your call.

379
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:16,460
I should have.

380
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:24,750
I'm okay.

381
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:27,570
I really feel fine now.

382
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:34,450
The memories of back then aren't so painful now.

383
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:38,710
Maybe that's why I don't hate you either.

384
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:43,340
Still, I'm happy that I could see you

385
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:46,150
and apologize to you like this.

386
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:48,510
I'm happier for you.

387
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:51,110
That you broke away.

388
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:53,620
Your hands are all better.

389
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:58,530
They are pretty.

390
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,690
Your kicks are still the same.

391
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:09,040
I got mad and vented on him but

392
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:11,050
did I put you in an awkward situation?

393
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:15,380
What could they do but fire me? It's fine.

394
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:21,720
- That song? 
 - Of course, it's my choice.

395
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:24,150
I always liked Leo's song.

396
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:26,340
I think it would be meaningful if Seo Jun sang

397
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:29,210
the song you made with Se Yeon.

398
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:32,250
I would feel too bad for Se Yeon if I left that song as a plagiarized song.

399
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:34,710
And you would feel wronged, too.

400
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:38,800
Why so serious?

401
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,920
I just can't believe it.

402
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:43,280
I never learned it properly.

403
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:45,290
I leaned from Se Yeon while making it.

404
00:31:45,290 --> 00:31:47,530
I heard from Seo Jun before.

405
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:52,670
When looking at all the music equipment in your house, your sincerity showed through.

406
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:58,350
We'll listen to it from our end, and if it's not good, we won't put it in the album, so don't get ahead of yourself.

407
00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:02,700
I'd like to hear Leo's version of "Missing You."

408
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:07,250
Don't feel so pressured and send it to me.

409
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:09,980
That's it for work talk.

410
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:12,380
Can I open your wedding gift?

411
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:14,590
Yes.

412
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:17,730
What's so heavy?

413
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:21,020
Wow.

414
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:30,010
Wow, you're so sensible.

415
00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:31,380
Congratulations on your wedding.

416
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:35,430
Perfect! There were so many things to fix at home.

417
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:48,750
 I'd like to hear Leo's version of "Missing You." 

418
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:52,060
 Authorized. 

419
00:33:22,050 --> 00:33:28,640
♫  A sky colored violet  ♫

420
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:36,140
♫  A night getting colder in the mournful wind  ♫

421
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:41,950
♫  The familiar memories etched on my heart  ♫

422
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:49,070
♫  The night filled again with you  ♫

423
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:58,110
♫  Remain just as grateful memories  ♫

424
00:33:58,110 --> 00:34:03,800
♫  I'm afraid you and I who were made to laugh excitedly together  ♫

425
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:06,760
♫  Again  ♫

426
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,080
 Who's that jerk? What's his name? 

427
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:11,480
Su Jin kicked him for me.

428
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,860
That's nice. But if I were there,

429
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:16,060
- I would've half killed— 
 -  What do you mean half kill?

430
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:18,120
Thankfully I didn't get fired.

431
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:20,690
I am in the process of getting punished, though.

432
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:24,230
I should really get to this. I'll call you later.

433
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:30,840
What are you doing?

434
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:34,180
Oh, I'm washing the brushes and puffs.

435
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:36,990
You're doing this all by yourself?

436
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:39,410
What are you doing?

437
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:43,910
This is a moisture latex. Don't you know they shrink in hot water?

438
00:34:43,910 --> 00:34:46,280
I'm sorry.

439
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:49,150
You should start by separating natural and synthetic bristles for brushes.

440
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:51,930
They have different methods of washing, so don't confuse them.

441
00:34:51,930 --> 00:34:53,680
Yes, ma'am.

442
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:55,100
So you're Im Su Jeong?

443
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:57,130
I'm Im Ju Gyeong.

444
00:34:57,130 --> 00:35:00,480
So you're the one who butted Chae Ni earlier?

445
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,420
I'm really sorry about that, too.

446
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:04,570
Good job on that one.

447
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:07,710
That girl looks down on us too much.

448
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:09,770
I told her to go to a different salon.

449
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:13,600
Um, Director!  The bulletin board.

450
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:18,290
Am I eligible to submit a concept idea for the Move rookie group, too?

451
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:21,490
- Miss Im Gyeong Ja, don't you know how to read? 
 - Pardon?

452
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:26,790
Didn't you see that it says "all employees eligible to apply"?

453
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:30,250
Thank you. I'll try my best.

454
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:34,280
But I'm Im Ju Gyeong.

455
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:50,060
Hey, hey, look at him.

456
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:51,890
- Who is that guy? 
 - Wow he is so handsome. Who is he?

457
00:35:51,890 --> 00:35:54,150
- Is that his girlfriend?
 - No, it looks like they're just friends.

458
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:56,970
Did you wait long?

459
00:35:56,970 --> 00:35:59,530
Baby, what took you so long?

460
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:01,360
I waited so long.

461
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,290
Baby, have you eaten?

462
00:36:03,290 --> 00:36:05,920
Here, say ahhh.

463
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,790
Guys, just do this. She is his girlfriend.

464
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:12,490
♫  When I look at you  ♫

465
00:36:12,490 --> 00:36:14,570
♫  I get butterflies  ♫

466
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:16,340
Were you jealous just now?

467
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:19,980
Baby?

468
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:23,610
Jealous my foot.

469
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:27,130
Don't smile around like that from now on, okay?

470
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:31,070
I think you were jealous of those middle schoolers.

471
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:33,450
Baby?

472
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:35,340
Enough already, Lee Su Ho.

473
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:37,960
Call me Baby, Baby?

474
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:40,220
No way.

475
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:42,890
- Should I try this?
 - What?

476
00:36:42,890 --> 00:36:45,440
Are you going to call me Baby?

477
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:49,860
I haven't tried doing men's makeup, so I can't really get it.

478
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:54,960
- This tickles. 
 - Stay still. Let me do this right.

479
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:59,170
It's different between just imagining and seeing it for real.

480
00:36:59,170 --> 00:37:02,500
Stop.  A model shouldn't be doing this.

481
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,510
- Hey, Lee Su Ho.
 - Okay, fine.

482
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:06,550
Stay still.

483
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:09,310
Hi, hi, hi. This is good. It feels good. One, two.

484
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:11,070
Good. Look here. One, two, three.

485
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:14,100
Good vibes, good models, good emotions.

486
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:17,820
Let's smile. Seo Jun, look here and smile.

487
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:21,320
One, two, three. Two, three. Look here, right.

488
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:24,090
Hi, hi. Good.

489
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:27,390
Oppa, you're so cool!

490
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:29,780
Hey, your girl fans are going crazy.

491
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:31,740
Seriously, you two are really overreacting.

492
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:34,630
You're good, that's why. Let's rule the pop world.

493
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:38,600
That scowl just now looks great. Seo Jun, that's right.

494
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,990
   

495
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:58,330
 'Missing You' Final Version 

496
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:05,750
Whatever.

497
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:11,520
 Your mail has been sent. 

498
00:38:22,890 --> 00:38:25,060
Here you go.

499
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:27,180
 Rookie group makeup concept idea 

500
00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:40,980
Were you okay? Didn't you get mad or  something?

501
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:44,440
Yeah, it was nice seeing her.

502
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:47,280
My Im Ju is just too nice.

503
00:38:48,350 --> 00:38:51,240
I do want to see Su Jin, too.

504
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:53,950
I was wondering how she was.

505
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,390
This is cute. Try this.

506
00:38:57,390 --> 00:38:59,510
Yeah?

507
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:06,620
This is super cute, too. Try this.

508
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:10,800
How much did your unni give you to buy the bag?

509
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,660
What's the limit?

510
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:14,990
I got her credit card.

511
00:39:14,990 --> 00:39:16,980
Hey, buy both. Just get everything.

512
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:19,870
I can't. I also have to get an outfit to wear at the wedding.

513
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:22,190
Could I get this one, please?

514
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:29,830
Which one looks better for my sister's wedding?

515
00:39:29,830 --> 00:39:31,880
This one or this one?

516
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:36,180
I would choose this one. No, this one.

517
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:38,050
No, this one.

518
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:39,230
I like this one.

519
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:42,870
What the heck? You asked me to choose one.

520
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:48,470
By the way, you went on a trip with Lee Su Ho recently, right?

521
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:50,310
Yeah, so what?

522
00:39:50,370 --> 00:39:52,970
- Did nothing happen? 
- What do you mean?

523
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:57,860
You know this and that kind of things.

524
00:39:57,860 --> 00:40:01,330
This and that... Oh, I almost lost my phone there—

525
00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:06,650
No, not those kinds of things! You know, didn't that kind of thing happen?

526
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:10,920
What do you mean? We took an early train and went on a day trip.

527
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:13,690
What? It's not like you guys are Confucianist man and Confucianist woman.

528
00:40:13,690 --> 00:40:16,890
- You guys aren't even in high school anymore! 
- Stop it!

529
00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:21,020
Why are you embarrassed? But why aren't you seeing Lee Su Ho when it's your day off today?

530
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,250
- He said he's meeting Yoo Tae Hoon today.
 - What, Yoo Tae Hoon?

531
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:27,190
- You should've told me earlier! Let's go join them. 
- Just let them have fun by themselves.

532
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:30,110
I want to see Yoo Tae Hoon—

533
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:36,530
I have something to rip off from him, so contact Lee Su Ho.

534
00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:38,220
I got it.

535
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,970
  Boyfriend 

536
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:50,000
- He's not picking up.
- What? Try again.

537
00:40:54,290 --> 00:40:57,450
He's not picking up. They must be busy talking.

538
00:40:57,450 --> 00:41:02,900
These kids are so suspicious. Yoo Tae Hoon was going out everywhere, since he's about to go to the military.

539
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:08,470
 - We are going to place with good water!  
- Heol!

540
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:12,930
- Heol! Where the water is good? 
- What's wrong?

541
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:14,810
  Apgujeong Pub 

542
00:41:14,810 --> 00:41:17,310
These crazy... Isn't this place a hunting pub?

543
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:21,590
What? Hunting pub?

544
00:41:21,590 --> 00:41:24,690
Yoo Tae Hoon, you're dead.

545
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,100
Is he picking up?

546
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:30,820
He's not picking up.

547
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:34,170
 - What?  
 - Hey, where are you? What are you doing right now?

548
00:41:34,170 --> 00:41:36,280
 I'm having a fiery time with Lee Su Ho. Why? 

549
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:38,280
- Fiery? 
 - Fiery?

550
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,630
- Hey, you better—
  - I'm busy, I'm hanging up. 

551
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:43,920
Hey, hey, hello? Hello? Yoo Tae Hoon?

552
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,960
This trash-like bastard!

553
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,700
Did you just call me?

554
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:50,490
Get out of the way!

555
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:09,010
  You were matched with a taxi. 

556
00:42:11,050 --> 00:42:13,880
Yoo Tae Hoon, did you go to a hunting pub with Lee Su Ho?

557
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:17,120
- What are you talking about? 
 - You posted a picture saying you're going to a place with good water!

558
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:19,060
What were you doing to have such a fiery time?

559
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:24,520
- How about Su Ho? Where did he go? 
- Let go of me! We went over there!
 Kiln Sauna Spa Open 24 hours 

560
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:28,230
- Kiln Sauna? 
 - That's right!

561
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:31,670
It's Jju Gyeong!

562
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:33,480
At a place with good water...

563
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:36,200
You guys had a fiery time!

564
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:39,160
Fiery, fiery, it really was, seriously!

565
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:41,890
It was really hot.

566
00:42:41,890 --> 00:42:44,910
Hey, Lee Su Ho! Why is he like this?

567
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:46,640
He's acting weird like seaweed!

568
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:49,580
We went to the spa and I gave him some alcohol, but what should I do with him?

569
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:52,360
Hey, Su Ho, get a grip!

570
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:55,830
- Jju Gyeong! 
 - What did he just call her? Jju Gyeong?

571
00:42:55,830 --> 00:42:59,390
You must be very drunk. I will take you home. Hey, I'm leaving first.

572
00:42:59,390 --> 00:43:00,730
- Okay. 
 - Do that.

573
00:43:00,730 --> 00:43:03,560
Hey, get up!

574
00:43:05,670 --> 00:43:08,470
Go home safely!

575
00:43:08,470 --> 00:43:10,660
Oh, taxi!

576
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:12,730
Taxi!

577
00:43:12,730 --> 00:43:15,430
No, not over there.

578
00:43:15,430 --> 00:43:17,680
Let's go. Hey, we're leaving!

579
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:27,020
- I'm leaving!  
 - Wait a moment! I'm sorry.

580
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:29,650
But why did you come here?

581
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:31,050
What do you mean?

582
00:43:31,050 --> 00:43:33,150
We broke up already, so why do you care

583
00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:39,750
whether I'm having fun at a place with good water and having a fiery time?

584
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:42,440
I never cared!

585
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:44,750
You know you broke up with me seventeen times!

586
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:47,980
Even if I have regrets, I'm never accepting you back this time!

587
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:51,860
- Why are you following me when you said you're not going to accept me? 
- It's late!

588
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:56,540
It's dangerous. How can I let you go alone?

589
00:43:56,540 --> 00:43:59,600
What are you saying, seriously?

590
00:44:02,950 --> 00:44:04,550
I love you!

591
00:44:07,830 --> 00:44:09,750
Come over here.

592
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:14,760
Thank you!

593
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:20,200
Come over here.

594
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:23,850
If you drink like this ever again...

595
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:28,100
Ju Gyeong...

596
00:44:29,610 --> 00:44:34,190
- Where are we? 
- Here? It's your house.

597
00:44:34,190 --> 00:44:38,790
- I'm dizzy. 
 - Be careful. Here, be careful!

598
00:44:42,630 --> 00:44:45,030
Gosh...

599
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:55,690
Oh? This...

600
00:44:55,690 --> 00:44:58,570
 It was really hard to get this, but I'll give it to you specially. 

601
00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:02,940
  I should take care of you since you are a friend whom I even shared my secret with. 

602
00:45:04,570 --> 00:45:07,430
He stuck it over here.

603
00:45:15,930 --> 00:45:19,700
Look at how his eyes crinkle while smiling when he's drunk... This won't do.

604
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:21,450
I told you not to go around smiling like that.

605
00:45:21,450 --> 00:45:26,350
- Huh? But who are you? 
 - What is this?

606
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:31,090
Who are you to come into my house like this?

607
00:45:31,150 --> 00:45:34,880
- I'm Im Ju Gyeong. 
 - Im Ju Gyeong?

608
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:38,020
My girlfriend's name is Im Ju Gyeong too.

609
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:44,160
- But you are pretty too. 
 - Is that so?

610
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:48,680
Then do you want to break up with your girlfriend and date me instead?

611
00:45:48,710 --> 00:45:53,220
Nope! I am Im Ju Gyeong's man!

612
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:55,200
That is a pity.

613
00:45:56,340 --> 00:45:59,860
Then I will leave now.

614
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:02,290
Get some rest.

615
00:46:02,290 --> 00:46:04,240
Wait a moment.

616
00:46:05,470 --> 00:46:07,500
Come here.

617
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:19,570
♫ I like you so much. What should I do? What should I do?

618
00:46:19,570 --> 00:46:22,200
Hey, it's so cheesy. Stop it!

619
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:27,880
♫ I like you so much. What should I do? What should I do?

620
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:31,790
You became a completely different person when you're drunk.

621
00:46:36,010 --> 00:46:40,820
Ju Gyeong, you know...

622
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:46,890
The song that Se Yeon and I made together...

623
00:46:46,890 --> 00:46:50,350
Seo Jun is going to sing it.

624
00:46:50,350 --> 00:46:52,300
Really?

625
00:46:55,520 --> 00:47:00,540
Do you think Se Yeon would like that?

626
00:47:02,070 --> 00:47:05,960
Of course, most definitely.

627
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:10,710
- Really? 
 - Really.

628
00:47:10,710 --> 00:47:14,980
If it were me, I would be very happy.

629
00:47:16,830 --> 00:47:22,020
I really hope that is the case.

630
00:47:57,570 --> 00:48:02,840
Ju Gyeong, wake up.

631
00:48:09,550 --> 00:48:16,170
Ju Gyeong, it's late. You should wake up.

632
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:23,360
I definitely tried to wake you up.

633
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:25,950
You're the one who didn't get up.

634
00:48:29,970 --> 00:48:31,970
I love you.

635
00:48:53,730 --> 00:48:59,100
- Are you okay? 
- Yeah? I was going to leave once you fall asleep, but I fell asleep instead.

636
00:48:59,100 --> 00:49:02,100
I was about to wake you up.

637
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:03,770
  You have three missed calls. 

638
00:49:05,330 --> 00:49:08,990
My mom called me! I didn't tell her I'm going to be late.

639
00:49:08,990 --> 00:49:11,050
 Why didn't you go home? 

640
00:49:11,050 --> 00:49:13,710
 I told your mom that you're sleeping over at my place! 

641
00:49:13,710 --> 00:49:17,600
  Have a good time, friend! 

642
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:21,340
Are you not going to call her?

643
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:27,870
Oh, Su Ah already made an excuse to my mom.

644
00:49:27,870 --> 00:49:29,200
I see.

645
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:34,280
I will drop you off. Where is my car key?

646
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:38,130
- My car key... where did I put it? 
 - But you drank alcohol.

647
00:49:38,130 --> 00:49:43,780
That's right. I can call a substitute driver.

648
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:46,350
I can call a taxi.

649
00:49:48,390 --> 00:49:52,720
It's hard to find one. It must be because it's so late at night.

650
00:49:57,770 --> 00:50:00,390
I'm going to try to get one outside.

651
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:07,340
Can you just not go?

652
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:13,940
Do you have to, when it's so late?

653
00:50:18,550 --> 00:50:21,160
Don't leave.

654
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:27,070
♫  You don't know yet  ♫

655
00:50:28,380 --> 00:50:33,310
♫  How special you are  ♫

656
00:50:33,310 --> 00:50:43,100
♫  To your heart I hope I can reach  ♫

657
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:51,140
♫  I'm missing you, waiting for you   ♫

658
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:58,660
♫  My heart is set for you  ♫

659
00:50:58,660 --> 00:51:06,260
♫  I'm missing you, waiting for you  ♫

660
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:13,550
♫  I'm waiting for you again today  ♫

661
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:26,430
Oh, you are cooking? You're amazing.

662
00:51:26,430 --> 00:51:30,860
Just for doing this? You just have to add bunch of things together and stir fry.

663
00:51:32,820 --> 00:51:34,880
I'm not even good at making ramyun.

664
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:37,450
I guess I need to cook for the rest of our lives.

665
00:51:38,950 --> 00:51:40,710
It looks delicious. Here.

666
00:51:40,710 --> 00:51:44,410
- I'm so hungry! 
- Ta-da!

667
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:49,330
- Eat slowly, slowly! 
 - It's so delicious!

668
00:51:49,330 --> 00:51:52,540
- Did you sprinkle in some magic sauce or what? 
 - Eat this salad too.

669
00:51:52,540 --> 00:51:56,780
I told you, you have to eat something rich in fiber for your constipation.

670
00:52:11,020 --> 00:52:12,800
Wait a moment.

671
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:19,870
Ta-da!

672
00:52:22,610 --> 00:52:28,070
  In my eyes, you are Im Ju Gyeong. 

673
00:52:31,710 --> 00:52:34,390
You still had this with you?

674
00:52:34,390 --> 00:52:35,910
Come here.

675
00:52:38,390 --> 00:52:40,460
You know how to tie hair?

676
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:42,070
I'm going to try.

677
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:47,690
Is it weird?

678
00:52:47,690 --> 00:52:50,030
Why did you keep this instead of throwing it away?

679
00:52:50,070 --> 00:52:52,630
I'm glad I kept it.

680
00:52:52,650 --> 00:52:56,380
After I'm done with work today, do you want to watch a movie at night?

681
00:52:56,380 --> 00:53:00,280
I can't today. I have to do something important.

682
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:02,130
Something important?

683
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:09,650
♫  Because when I close my eyes, you are distinct  ♫

684
00:53:10,670 --> 00:53:17,330
♫  Because I miss you more when you shined  ♫

685
00:53:17,330 --> 00:53:24,450
♫  In the place where you spent a long night  ♫

686
00:53:24,450 --> 00:53:31,470
♫  I am going to rest a while. Stay with me.  ♫

687
00:53:31,470 --> 00:53:37,840
♫  In my tired heart bursting with tears  ♫

688
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:45,470
♫  When my song reaches the sky  ♫

689
00:53:45,470 --> 00:53:47,760
♫  Come slowly  ♫

690
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:51,000
You've worked hard. Wow!

691
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:54,090
You're so cool. Aren't you going to get sued at this rate?

692
00:53:54,090 --> 00:53:56,440
For assaulting the hearts of young fangirls?

693
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:57,790
What's with the silly line?

694
00:53:57,790 --> 00:54:00,400
Our Leo, how was it?

695
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:02,240
It was so-so.

696
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:05,000
It's a bit so-so in the hearts of young fangirls.

697
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,850
- Do you want to die? 
 - No.

698
00:54:07,850 --> 00:54:09,720
You pair of flowers, go ahead and fight.

699
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:12,770
I like things like blood, sweat, and tears.

700
00:54:12,770 --> 00:54:15,060
You're not going to throw up again, are you?

701
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:19,450
Finish up the recording well. Because this body is getting married tomorrow...

702
00:54:19,450 --> 00:54:20,640
I will now be going.

703
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:23,500
Congratulations. You sure got a good groom.

704
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:27,060
Right? I need to make my grapefruit live in luxury.

705
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:30,200
- Bye. 
 - Goodbye.

706
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:31,880
I'm hungry.

707
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:33,790
Do you want to grab a bite?

708
00:54:34,570 --> 00:54:36,260
Will this be enough?

709
00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:38,900
Hey. If I get full, my voice won't come out even more.

710
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:41,810
But... your vocalization isn't as good as it was back then.

711
00:54:41,810 --> 00:54:45,710
Hey! I saw you crying secretly while I was recording earlier.

712
00:54:45,710 --> 00:54:47,660
- When did I? 
 - Wow.

713
00:54:49,850 --> 00:54:53,080
If you get busy after you debut, won't I not be seeing you very often anymore?

714
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:57,230
- I'll be very busy. Hurry and get in line in advance. 
 - Hey.

715
00:54:57,230 --> 00:55:01,650
I'm also busy. I'm going to start studying.

716
00:55:01,650 --> 00:55:03,800
- What studying? 
 - Music.

717
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:06,180
I learned to compose by observing.

718
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:09,140
I want to learn properly from the beginning.

719
00:55:09,140 --> 00:55:12,930
Hey.  So are you taking the CSAT? 
    

720
00:55:12,930 --> 00:55:15,560
Looks like Im Ju Gyeong will have to support an examinee.

721
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:18,150
Even if I take the exam right now, I would get into a decent college.

722
00:55:18,150 --> 00:55:20,200
You jerk, showing off.

723
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:21,850
Do you want to drink Coke?

724
00:55:21,850 --> 00:55:25,350
Carbonated drinks aren't good for your vocal cords. Drink water. Water.

725
00:55:25,390 --> 00:55:26,770
Okay, I got it. I'll drink water.

726
00:55:26,770 --> 00:55:29,630
There's a reason why your vocalization isn't as good as it was back then.

727
00:55:29,630 --> 00:55:31,630
Are you my wife? The amount of nagging...

728
00:55:31,630 --> 00:55:35,170
You're debuting. You should take care of yourself.

729
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:43,760
 Im Hui Gyeong ♡ Han Jun Woo 
 We are getting married 

730
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:45,140
 Bride side 

731
00:55:45,140 --> 00:55:46,280
 Groom side 

732
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:48,810
 We are getting married 

733
00:55:52,710 --> 00:55:56,280
Who is it? Who have you been texting since earlier?

734
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:57,470
An upperclassman from school.

735
00:55:57,470 --> 00:56:00,280
An upperclassman? Female or male?

736
00:56:00,350 --> 00:56:04,050
- Male. 
 - Male?

737
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:09,890
You're smiling? Wow. You need to wait until I get to college next year. What's this?

738
00:56:09,890 --> 00:56:11,960
Right, so who told you to reapply?

739
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:13,470
Did I do it because I wanted to?

740
00:56:13,470 --> 00:56:15,650
What are you saying?

741
00:56:15,650 --> 00:56:17,160
Flirting is fine.

742
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:22,410
I'll let it go. Go and enjoy the college life.

743
00:56:25,350 --> 00:56:28,950
- Im Ju Yeong. 
 - What is it?

744
00:56:28,950 --> 00:56:31,280
I know how much you like me.

745
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:33,920
And I also know that there's no one like you.

746
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:37,970
So you! Don't go and flirt with girls at the re-applicant academy.

747
00:56:37,970 --> 00:56:40,600
I won't stand still!

748
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:44,880
Go Woon~

749
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:52,550
Our Ju Gyeong, your experience from interning while attending college is showing.

750
00:56:52,550 --> 00:56:54,680
What's with that slang coming out of a new bride's mouth?

751
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:56,900
Stay still.

752
00:56:56,900 --> 00:57:00,450
Our Hui Gyeong really is beautiful.

753
00:57:01,270 --> 00:57:05,790
Why am I like this? I can't keep crying like this.

754
00:57:05,790 --> 00:57:07,640
The bride and groom have switched.

755
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:09,850
Cute!

756
00:57:09,850 --> 00:57:11,440
What's this, Dad?

757
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:15,010
He cried all night, so his eyes got swollen in the morning.

758
00:57:16,140 --> 00:57:17,790
It's gotten a lot better now.

759
00:57:17,790 --> 00:57:19,550
Oh my.

760
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:25,610
Why do you keep crying?

761
00:57:25,610 --> 00:57:29,980
You sure did grab a husband exactly like your father.

762
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:32,210
- It's all done. 
 - Really? Wow!

763
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:36,040
Is this really me? Huh?

764
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:37,290
Unni.

765
00:57:37,290 --> 00:57:38,500
- You came? 
 - Hello.

766
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:40,470
You're so pretty. Congratulations.

767
00:57:40,470 --> 00:57:42,720
- What about Seo Jun?  
 - I just came with Go Woon.

768
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:46,470
Our Seo Jun is very busy these days preparing for his debut.

769
00:57:46,470 --> 00:57:48,140
So pretty!

770
00:57:48,140 --> 00:57:49,440
- God Hyeon Gyu. 
 - What, God Tae Hoon?

771
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:53,140
What's with you? Why didn't you come with your girlfriend?

772
00:57:53,140 --> 00:57:55,590
My girlfriend is a bit busy.

773
00:57:55,590 --> 00:57:56,600
You're lying, aren't you?

774
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:59,450
You didn't want to go to the army with me, so you lied saying you got a girlfriend?

775
00:57:59,450 --> 00:58:02,530
This jerk. You sure did bring this weird couple ring from somewhere.

776
00:58:02,530 --> 00:58:04,610
- Is it your father's? 
 - My father's?

777
00:58:04,610 --> 00:58:07,280
This is a platinum 18K ring from Dongdaemun.

778
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:08,930
Do you know that? Do you?

779
00:58:08,930 --> 00:58:12,540
Hoon~ You look so cool wearing a suit.

780
00:58:12,540 --> 00:58:14,740
What's this? Why are you calling him Hoon again?

781
00:58:14,740 --> 00:58:16,980
You call him Hoon when you guys are dating.

782
00:58:16,980 --> 00:58:19,050
No way! Are you guys dating again?

783
00:58:19,050 --> 00:58:22,680
When have I ever said Hoon? You... Go clean out your ears.

784
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:24,790
It's suspicious. You wouldn't call him Hoon for no apparent reason.

785
00:58:24,790 --> 00:58:26,680
What's suspicious?

786
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:27,670
It's been a long time!

787
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:29,780
What's this?

788
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:42,840
Su Ah, your hands got bigger.

789
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:45,720
Hey, what are you doing?

790
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:48,410
- This jerk! How dare you hold hands with someone else's girlfriend! 
 - It's not like that.

791
00:58:48,410 --> 00:58:50,450
Wait. G-Girlfriend?

792
00:58:51,270 --> 00:58:54,640
Hey! You guys used to fight whenever you met. When did you guys start exchanging such feelings?

793
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:57,240
You guys said you'd never date each other. Wow, what a reversal.

794
00:58:57,240 --> 00:59:00,000
I told you to be careful not to get caught, didn't I?

795
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,120
- Honey! 
 - Honey?

796
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:04,980
Honey, are you embarrassed of me?

797
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:06,760
I don't know.

798
00:59:07,570 --> 00:59:09,070
Guys.

799
00:59:09,070 --> 00:59:13,980
- Look at our beautiful love. 
 - No, no. Wait.

800
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:16,300
Hey! Don't do it!

801
00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:18,170
What are you doing right now?

802
00:59:18,170 --> 00:59:19,680
Seriously, what's with you guys?

803
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:22,220
- Hoon, Hoon. Let's go. 
 - I can't look at this anymore.

804
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:23,250
Aren't we dating?

805
00:59:23,250 --> 00:59:25,250
Ju Gyeong.

806
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:27,470
You came?

807
00:59:27,470 --> 00:59:29,460
What about the makeup? Did you finish well?

808
00:59:29,460 --> 00:59:32,820
It's my sister who is marrying, but why do I feel nervous and weird?

809
00:59:32,820 --> 00:59:35,280
Did it get announced? I heard the result of the concept contest is being announced today.

810
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:38,100
Yeah. It sure did. It did.

811
00:59:38,100 --> 00:59:39,480
How did it go?

812
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:41,310
That...

813
00:59:41,310 --> 00:59:44,280
Good or bad?

814
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:46,320
You passed, didn't you?

815
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:48,580
- No, I failed. 
 - You did?

816
00:59:48,580 --> 00:59:51,250
I'm the youngest in the makeup shop. It would be weirder if I passed.

817
00:59:51,250 --> 00:59:54,240
You must feel regretful since you prepared hard for it.

818
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:56,070
But even so, I feel good.

819
00:59:56,070 --> 00:59:58,380
Once the new semester starts, my internship will end.

820
00:59:58,380 --> 01:00:00,910
So I feel like I would have regretted it if I ended it with running errands only.

821
01:00:00,910 --> 01:00:02,710
I learned a lot from preparing the PPT too.

822
01:00:02,710 --> 01:00:04,990
You did well, even so.

823
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:09,110
But no matter how I see it, I think I picked the wrong model.

824
01:00:09,110 --> 01:00:13,250
- Why? 
 - Looking at your picture, they asked me more questions about who the model was rather than about my makeup.

825
01:00:13,250 --> 01:00:16,050
Asking where I recruited him from.

826
01:00:16,050 --> 01:00:18,370
It's because of you I failed.

827
01:00:18,370 --> 01:00:20,580
- Was it because of me? 
 - Yeah.

828
01:00:20,580 --> 01:00:22,370
How should I take responsibility for this?

829
01:00:22,370 --> 01:00:24,720
Not sure.

830
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:27,250
God Su Ho, my best friend~ Woo!

831
01:00:27,250 --> 01:00:30,410
Why are you guys this pretty and cool today? Anybody will say you guys are the ones getting married.

832
01:00:30,410 --> 01:00:32,800
Getting married~

833
01:00:35,010 --> 01:00:36,490
Su Jin!

834
01:00:36,490 --> 01:00:39,340
Wow. Kang Su Jin?

835
01:00:41,820 --> 01:00:44,330
You haven't changed at all.

836
01:00:44,330 --> 01:00:47,370
It's been a long time, Kang Su.

837
01:00:47,370 --> 01:00:50,010
It's been a long time hearing "Kang Su."

838
01:00:50,010 --> 01:00:54,040
It's good you came. Su Ah was also curious about you.

839
01:00:54,910 --> 01:00:56,290
Have you been well?

840
01:00:56,290 --> 01:00:59,410
I heard about Mr. Joo Heon. It's a relief.

841
01:00:59,410 --> 01:01:02,750
Yeah. Thanks.

842
01:01:04,950 --> 01:01:07,500
I've missed you.

843
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:10,170
You should have contacted me.

844
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:13,220
I'm sorry.

845
01:01:13,910 --> 01:01:15,570
So cute.

846
01:01:15,570 --> 01:01:18,010
Hui Gyeong, the ring has arrived.

847
01:01:18,010 --> 01:01:19,700
If it came a little bit later, it would have been a huge problem.

848
01:01:19,700 --> 01:01:22,190
- Try it on to see if the size is right. 
 - Okay?

849
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:25,810
Is it a bit tight?

850
01:01:25,810 --> 01:01:27,490
- Huh? 
 - It won't get out.

851
01:01:27,490 --> 01:01:29,620
What? It's because you drank last night!

852
01:01:29,620 --> 01:01:31,740
How could a new bride drink the night before her wedding?

853
01:01:31,740 --> 01:01:33,620
It really isn't coming off. Try and get it off.

854
01:01:33,650 --> 01:01:37,710
Let me see. Huh? It really won't.

855
01:01:37,710 --> 01:01:40,540
- Then let's just wear it and enter. 
 - No, we can't.

856
01:01:40,540 --> 01:01:43,230
The exchange of rings is really important in the ceremony program.

857
01:01:43,230 --> 01:01:45,250
That's right. Give it here. I'll take it out.

858
01:01:45,250 --> 01:01:46,920
Dad?

859
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:48,810
This kind of thing, your dad will...

860
01:01:50,710 --> 01:01:52,250
My finger will fall off!

861
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:54,390
Gently, honey. Gently.

862
01:01:54,390 --> 01:01:57,880
Dad... Dad will get it off!

863
01:02:02,570 --> 01:02:04,670
It fell off!

864
01:02:07,740 --> 01:02:09,470
Here it is.

865
01:02:14,420 --> 01:02:17,180
Bride. The bride will now be moved to the waiting room.

866
01:02:17,180 --> 01:02:18,840
I got it.

867
01:02:22,050 --> 01:02:24,080
What's this?

868
01:02:25,190 --> 01:02:27,180
- W-Why? 
 - Why?

869
01:02:27,180 --> 01:02:29,250
This darn...

870
01:02:30,550 --> 01:02:32,840
Hui Gyeong, congratulations.

871
01:02:34,850 --> 01:02:36,830
What's this? Is this really the bride's waiting room?

872
01:02:36,830 --> 01:02:38,750
Why is the groom sitting?

873
01:02:38,750 --> 01:02:39,970
Hello.

874
01:02:39,970 --> 01:02:42,310
What is this?

875
01:02:42,310 --> 01:02:44,240
Is there such a thing as a groom's waiting room these days?

876
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:46,740
Bravo! Mr. Jun Woo, you look so cool!

877
01:02:46,740 --> 01:02:48,710
Congratulations!

878
01:02:48,710 --> 01:02:50,480
- Thank you. 
 - I'll take a picture of you all.

879
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:51,740
Go and stand next to the groom.

880
01:02:51,740 --> 01:02:53,740
Okay. Come here.

881
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:56,840
Teacher, sit here.

882
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:58,640
I'll be taking it.

883
01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:01,790
One, two, three!

884
01:03:02,770 --> 01:03:04,650
Teacher?

885
01:03:05,350 --> 01:03:07,210
Are you okay?

886
01:03:08,170 --> 01:03:09,350
What do I do? What do I do?

887
01:03:09,350 --> 01:03:11,070
Groom, please get ready to enter.

888
01:03:11,070 --> 01:03:13,190
Yes? Ah, yes.

889
01:03:15,610 --> 01:03:17,670
I'm the groom!

890
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:21,510
Match the teamwork!

891
01:03:21,510 --> 01:03:23,140
Has your head gotten bigger?

892
01:03:23,140 --> 01:03:25,250
What do we do? Should we call someone?

893
01:03:25,250 --> 01:03:26,380
112? 119?

894
01:03:26,380 --> 01:03:29,490
- 119? 
 - I'm sorry, but she has to enter right now. What should we do?

895
01:03:29,490 --> 01:03:30,350
What?

896
01:03:30,350 --> 01:03:32,650
Finally, today's main characters.

897
01:03:32,650 --> 01:03:35,060
The groom and bride will enter.

898
01:03:35,060 --> 01:03:38,680
The guests should look towards the back for a little while.

899
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:43,880
Now, with warm claps and dolphin voices that are at the level of the seventh octave of 'sol,'

900
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:47,180
Let's greet them!

901
01:03:47,180 --> 01:03:50,550
Groom and bride, please enter.

902
01:03:59,310 --> 01:04:00,980
Out of all the weddings I've seen,

903
01:04:00,980 --> 01:04:04,580
this is the most beautiful image.

904
01:04:04,580 --> 01:04:06,470
Give them a big hand!

905
01:04:10,510 --> 01:04:14,410
Your necklace is beautiful.

906
01:04:19,580 --> 01:04:22,810
Now, the sacred procedure of marriage is finished,

907
01:04:22,810 --> 01:04:26,380
so our respectable officiator will give us his speech.

908
01:04:26,380 --> 01:04:30,050
For the wedding of Groom Han Jun Woo

909
01:04:30,050 --> 01:04:33,210
and Bride Im Hui Gyeong,

910
01:04:33,210 --> 01:04:39,120
I have the honor of being the officiator, so I'm very deeply moved.

911
01:04:39,120 --> 01:04:42,120
To describe Mr. Han Jun Woo, the groom,

912
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:45,810
when he first appeared at the campus of Saebom High,

913
01:04:45,810 --> 01:04:48,670
he was shining with aura. So I thought,

914
01:04:48,670 --> 01:04:51,050
'Ah, this man is the one with the qualification and capability

915
01:04:51,050 --> 01:04:53,840
to create the new history of Saebom High!'

916
01:04:53,840 --> 01:04:55,970
I was able to be so sure of it!

917
01:04:55,970 --> 01:05:00,910
Now, to make sure of the bride's love for her groom, let's go with a cheer recited three times!

918
01:05:00,910 --> 01:05:02,550
Han Jun Woo is my man!

919
01:05:02,550 --> 01:05:04,450
Han Jun Woo is my man!

920
01:05:04,450 --> 01:05:06,060
Han Jun Woo is mine!

921
01:05:06,060 --> 01:05:09,190
So vigorous! Applaud!

922
01:05:13,810 --> 01:05:17,540
Kiss. Kiss. Kiss.

923
01:05:17,540 --> 01:05:20,180
- Kiss. 
 - N-No.

924
01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:23,050
Applaud!

925
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:28,210

I'll go wash the puffs.

957
01:08:37,670 --> 01:08:39,360
Seo Jun.

958
01:08:39,360 --> 01:08:42,330
Hey, you're here, too?

959
01:08:42,330 --> 01:08:44,140
You look cool today.

960
01:08:44,140 --> 01:08:48,400
Am I cool just today? I'm cool 24-7.

961
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:51,230
Seo Jun, are you done?

962
01:08:51,230 --> 01:08:54,040
- Shall we start?
 - Yes.

963
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:12,240
Looks like you made sure to bring your tact today.

964
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:33,240
What color do you think would be good?

965
01:09:33,240 --> 01:09:35,660
Sorry? Are you talking to me?

966
01:09:35,660 --> 01:09:38,460
Is there anyone else other than you?

967
01:09:42,040 --> 01:09:46,710
In my opinion, looking at the colors of the outfit and the hair,

968
01:09:48,260 --> 01:09:52,110
how about something more matte?

969
01:09:52,110 --> 01:09:54,310
Then you try.

970
01:09:54,310 --> 01:09:55,070
Me?

971
01:09:55,070 --> 01:09:57,490
Is there anyone else other than you here?

972
01:09:57,490 --> 01:10:02,990
Here. I heard you two are friends. Finish up well.

973
01:10:10,190 --> 01:10:12,100
That concept idea.

974
01:10:12,100 --> 01:10:15,640
It wasn't too bad coming from a beginner.

975
01:10:15,640 --> 01:10:17,850
Miss Im Ju Gyeong.

976
01:10:21,220 --> 01:10:23,030
What are you doing?

977
01:10:23,030 --> 01:10:25,560
You saw that she complimented me and called my name, right?

978
01:10:25,560 --> 01:10:27,430
This is not a dream, right?

979
01:10:27,430 --> 01:10:29,150
Gosh, so happy.

980
01:10:29,150 --> 01:10:32,810
Do you know the feeling of an accomplished fan?

981
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:36,880
Hurry and finish up.

982
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:38,520
Right.

983
01:10:46,060 --> 01:10:48,040
Do you have a hand tremor?

984
01:10:48,040 --> 01:10:51,950
Actually this is my first time on a real job.

985
01:10:51,950 --> 01:10:53,580
You did fine last time.

986
01:10:53,580 --> 01:10:55,370
It's different from then.

987
01:10:55,370 --> 01:10:58,120
You can't mess up even if you wanted to.

988
01:10:58,120 --> 01:11:00,810
My lips are just too sexy.

989
01:11:02,530 --> 01:11:04,890
Stay still.

990
01:11:20,500 --> 01:11:22,410
I'm done.

991
01:11:23,780 --> 01:11:25,470
Thanks.

992
01:11:25,470 --> 01:11:30,760
I didn't do anything. Good luck on your stage. I'll be sure to watch. Don't be nervous.

993
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:32,990
Good luck to you, too.

994
01:11:32,990 --> 01:11:34,960
Fighting!

995
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:37,280
Hey, your hand is sweating.

996
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:38,950
You must be nervous, right?

997
01:11:38,950 --> 01:11:41,680
No way. I'm strong-hearted.

998
01:11:41,680 --> 01:11:44,210
Do I look like I'd ever get nervous?

999
01:11:58,840 --> 01:12:00,090
Fighting, fighting!

1000
01:12:00,090 --> 01:12:02,050
Let's put our hands together.

1001
01:12:02,050 --> 01:12:05,050
We've been working hard. Let's show them with no regrets.

1002
01:12:05,050 --> 01:12:07,870
- One, two, three.
 - Fighting!

1003
01:12:10,610 --> 01:12:12,230
I'm here.

1004
01:12:12,230 --> 01:12:13,450
- Did you do well?
 - Yeah.

1005
01:12:13,450 --> 01:12:15,920
I did Seo Jun's lips.

1006
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:17,660
How about me?

1007
01:12:18,780 --> 01:12:20,840
It's starting.

1008
01:12:26,190 --> 01:12:30,860
  Garden Stage 

1009
01:12:45,030 --> 01:12:50,010
♫  A sky colored violet  ♫

1010
01:12:51,370 --> 01:12:57,580
♫  A night getting colder in the mournful wind  ♫

1011
01:12:58,310 --> 01:13:04,000
♫  The familiar memories etched on my heart  ♫

1012
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:10,300
♫  The night filled again with you  ♫

1013
01:13:13,220 --> 01:13:18,020
♫  Remain just as grateful memories  ♫

1014
01:13:19,680 --> 01:13:25,090
♫  I'm afraid you and I who were made to laugh excitedly together  ♫

1015
01:13:25,090 --> 01:13:32,170
♫  Will become stars and disappear  ♫

1016
01:13:32,170 --> 01:13:38,380
♫  I will cherish this in the emptiness of my heart  ♫

1017
01:13:40,110 --> 01:13:46,370
♫  Because when I close my eyes, you are distinct  ♫

1018
01:13:47,190 --> 01:13:53,970
♫  Because I miss you more when you shined  ♫

1019
01:13:53,970 --> 01:14:00,910
♫  In the place where you spent a long night  ♫

1020
01:14:00,910 --> 01:14:08,030
♫  I am going to rest a while. Stay with me.  ♫

1021
01:14:08,030 --> 01:14:14,480
♫  In my tired heart bursting with tears  ♫

1022
01:14:15,430 --> 01:14:22,180
♫  When my song reaches the sky  ♫

1023
01:14:22,180 --> 01:14:29,610
♫  Come slowly like an eternal dream  ♫

1024
01:14:29,610 --> 01:14:34,850
♫  Become a star at my side  ♫

1025
01:14:54,170 --> 01:14:57,470
♫  That long time in the dark  ♫

1026
01:14:57,470 --> 01:15:03,370
♫  As if I've seen the light while being lost  ♫

1027
01:15:04,180 --> 01:15:07,800
♫  Everything during that tough time  ♫

1028
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:12,840
♫  melts like the snow  ♫

1029
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:17,840
♫  I could only hold in just for one string called  hope  ♫

1030
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:22,890
♫  Countless tears  ♫

1031
01:15:22,890 --> 01:15:27,840
♫  The one dream that was ambiguous, with my heart  ♫

1032
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:32,550
♫  I jumped in with all  ♫

1033
01:15:32,550 --> 01:15:36,570
♫  It's the start from today  ♫

1034
01:15:36,570 --> 01:15:43,110
♫  As if I was born again, in front of my eyes   ♫

1035
01:15:43,110 --> 01:15:49,780
♫   The unfolded world, I will run anew to it  ♫

1036
01:15:49,780 --> 01:15:52,440
♫  Oh woah  ♫

1037
01:15:52,440 --> 01:15:54,960
♫  The future  ♫

1038
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:56,680
So cool! 
 ♫   That I missed  ♫

1039
01:15:56,680 --> 01:16:02,200
♫   One by one, it is being fulfilled.  ♫

1040
01:16:02,200 --> 01:16:08,090
♫   My dreams that I have been hoping and hoping for   ♫

1041
01:16:08,090 --> 01:16:14,610
♫  My fingertips are slowly about to touch them  ♫

1042
01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:26,150
I'm not done yet.

1043
01:16:29,180 --> 01:16:30,350
Are you done?

1044
01:16:30,350 --> 01:16:31,780
Not yet.

1045
01:16:31,780 --> 01:16:35,680
Aren't you too slow? You said you were a fast reader.

1046
01:16:35,680 --> 01:16:38,930
I'm concentrating on every page.

1047
01:16:38,930 --> 01:16:41,800
Are you just skipping through the pictures?

1048
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:43,470
That's not the right manner toward the horror comics.

1049
01:16:43,470 --> 01:16:46,000
I'm a fast reader.

1050
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,650
Show-off.

1051
01:16:49,420 --> 01:16:51,200
This is so well written.

1052
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:54,090
This is a zombie version of that classic 'Killer of the Dark', right?

1053
01:16:54,090 --> 01:16:55,920
I think they did a good job on making it trendy.

1054
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:58,570
Yeah? I was thinking why change something already good?

1055
01:16:58,570 --> 01:17:03,980
As it was changed to zombie, the charm of the classic that stimulated the horror of a metaphysical being

1056
01:17:03,980 --> 01:17:05,800
seems to be all gone.

1057
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:09,240
Anyway, there are so many classics that are good just as they are.

1058
01:17:09,240 --> 01:17:11,840
But you know the one from Ed Cellar in 1921

1059
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:13,240
- Night of Nightmare!
 - Night of Nightmare!

1060
01:17:13,240 --> 01:17:14,350
You know, too.

1061
01:17:14,350 --> 01:17:16,810
How can I not know? The drawing that doesn't look tacky even now—

1062
01:17:16,810 --> 01:17:18,350
Enough, enough. Let's finish this.

1063
01:17:18,350 --> 01:17:19,380
I'm so curious.

1064
01:17:19,380 --> 01:17:21,460
Next page.

1065
01:17:22,370 --> 01:17:24,840
I'm done. Hurry and flip.

1066
01:17:27,360 --> 01:17:29,280
Seriously.

1067
01:17:31,150 --> 01:17:33,120
What are you guys doing?

1068
01:17:35,090 --> 01:17:37,870
Nothing.

1069
01:17:40,700 --> 01:17:44,760
Sorry. Carry on. I'm going to go eat.

1070
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:47,100
I'm going to have a full course meal.

1071
01:17:51,380 --> 01:17:53,050
Shall we carry on?

1072
01:17:53,540 --> 01:17:55,410
Hey!

1073
01:17:55,410 --> 01:17:57,420
That's okay.

1074
01:18:01,220 --> 01:18:03,180
I found it.

1075
01:18:17,460 --> 01:18:20,620
