1
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:45,438
It was here…

2
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:49,484
From here…

3
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:53,696
Se-yeon…

4
00:01:57,742 --> 00:01:58,618
I know.

5
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:00,286
Se-yeon…

6
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:07,210
I know.

7
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:10,380
I understand.

8
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:51,671
Here.

9
00:02:58,761 --> 00:02:59,637
Are you all right?

10
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:04,684
Why are you asking me?
I should be the one to ask you.

11
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:10,857
I'm all right.

12
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:13,276
You're not all right.

13
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,696
I know you're hurting so much
that you can't even breathe.

14
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,657
I guess you remember.

15
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:21,826
Why didn't you tell me?

16
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:23,870
You could've told me earlier.

17
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:26,873
Right.

18
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:29,250
Why didn't I do that?

19
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:33,796
That day, when I was here…

20
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:37,717
I wasn't going to kill myself.

21
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,265
So there's no need for your pity.

22
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:45,725
I didn't mean it like that--

23
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:46,893
Fire!

24
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:48,853
Fire! Everyone evacuate!

25
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:57,153
Is it a big fire?

26
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,196
There's a fire!

27
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,031
What do we do?

28
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:02,450
I don't want to die here.

29
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:04,744
What do we do? There's a fire!

30
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:12,293
What do we do now?

31
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:17,048
One household was grilling
some dried pollock,

32
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:21,302
and the smoke set off the fire alarm…

33
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:23,554
Why were they grilling
dried pollock at home?

34
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:26,474
They taste best
when grilled over coals, right?

35
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:28,643
Jeez. Get out of my way!

36
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:29,978
-Stop pushing!
-What are you doing?

37
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:31,396
-I'm going first. Move!
-What?

38
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:32,522
Really?

39
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:35,775
What are we doing
in the middle of the night?

40
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:41,531
Don't kid yourself.

41
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:43,783
I was only being nice
because I pitied you.

42
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:49,664
Why did I even come running to him?

43
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:10,226
Does Ju-kyung know?

44
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:12,854
That you killed your friend?

45
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:17,942
Never forget.

46
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:21,112
You killed Se-yeon,

47
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,157
and you don't deserve to smile.

48
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,420
Someone told me

49
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:41,549
that tears cleanse the heart.

50
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:45,470
I'm just saying…

51
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,807
that it's all right to cry sometimes.

52
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:54,228
You don't have to act like
everything is all right.

53
00:05:58,316 --> 00:05:59,692
Bye.

54
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:28,930
But now it's bothersome and annoying.

55
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:30,932
I no longer…

56
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,893
want to care about you anymore, so leave.

57
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:36,395
I never realized,
but you're meddlesome yourself.

58
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:37,772
I never asked you to look after me.

59
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:39,232
I never asked you to care for me.

60
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:41,400
I won't bother you anymore,

61
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:43,569
so you can stop your pity.

62
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:06,759
Are you just getting home?

63
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:15,393
-Why did you come unannounced?
-Dinner?

64
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:16,769
I had it, so you can leave.

65
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:19,147
Turning me away on the spot
when it's been a while?

66
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:23,151
Your homeroom teacher called
about a parent-teacher conference.

67
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:26,571
Look, it's Lee Ju-hun!
I can't believe this!

68
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:29,740
You can't take pictures.

69
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:30,992
I'm sorry.

70
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:32,160
Let's go.

71
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:36,122
Don't worry about
the parent-teacher conference.

72
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:38,082
I'll tell him you're busy.

73
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,542
I already moved things around.

74
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:43,212
What do I have to bring
to a parent-teacher conference?

75
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,174
It's my first time, so I'm nervous.

76
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:48,092
I told you, I don't want people to know.

77
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:51,721
The teachers already know you are my son.

78
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:54,140
What would they think
if I don't visit even once?

79
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:55,558
Just do as you've always done.

80
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:58,561
I need to rest. Please leave for today.

81
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:25,171
I'm home.

82
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:26,881
Hey.

83
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:29,175
-Is Mom asleep?
-Yes.

84
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:32,345
-That looks delicious.
-Make your own!

85
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:34,972
I will, but just one bite. Come on.

86
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:40,561
You call that one bite?

87
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:42,313
This is good. Make another one.

88
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:44,524
You make your own, okay?

89
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:46,734
You are so petty.

90
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:50,613
Are you even my sister?

91
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:53,824
I'm not used to you wearing makeup.

92
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:55,660
Ju-kyung put a lot of effort into it,

93
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:57,245
so I can't bring myself to remove it yet.

94
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:58,371
By the way,

95
00:08:58,454 --> 00:09:00,873
when you said she helped you
when you were in trouble,

96
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:02,542
what did you mean?

97
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:04,835
Some kids were bullying me

98
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:06,796
because they were jealous I got the solo…

99
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:08,714
They were bullying you?

100
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:11,717
-What are their names?
-Why? So you can go after them?

101
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:14,262
Don't you dare! That's embarrassing.

102
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:16,973
And Ju-kyung already kicked their butts.

103
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:19,433
She did?

104
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:21,686
She sure is foolhardy.

105
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:29,318
That was so good.

106
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,070
You're a good cook.

107
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:32,071
It was refreshing.

108
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:33,864
It really tasted great.

109
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:36,075
Seo-jun!

110
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:39,579
This was the last pack
of my favorite instant noodles!

111
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:04,353
Hey, feet, why did you just turn around?
Why won't you stop?

112
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:05,646
What about school?

113
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:07,940
Going somewhere?

114
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:11,360
What? I'm going to school.
Where else would I go?

115
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:19,035
What now? Why?

116
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:22,496
You going to tease me again with,
"I'll only listen to you"?

117
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:25,041
No, that's not it…

118
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:28,169
-"I'll only listen to you"!
-I'll only listen to you.

119
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:29,837
Come on! You said it wasn't that!

120
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:33,466
I'm not going to just take it
if you keep teasing me.

121
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,635
I'll make sure to get you back.

122
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:41,641
-Han Seo-jun!
-Han Seo-jun!

123
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:42,850
Why did you butt in?

124
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:45,186
-"I'll make sure to get you back"!
-"I'll only listen to you"!

125
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:47,605
"I'll only listen to you"!

126
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:49,899
-Kang Su-jin.
-Yes.

127
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:52,109
-My grades are awful.
-Same here.

128
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:53,486
-Kim Si-hyun.
-Yes.

129
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:56,322
-Su-ah.
-Yes.

130
00:10:58,199 --> 00:10:59,742
-Kang-hyun.
-Yes.

131
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:01,035
LEVEL SEVEN

132
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:02,161
What?

133
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:04,622
The score is even lower
than the anticipated results.

134
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:08,501
2ND PLACE OUT OF 25 TOTAL

135
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:11,879
This is bad.

136
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:15,716
"What flower blooms without swaying?"

137
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:18,552
"The beautiful flowers of the world

138
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:20,012
all bloomed while swaying."

139
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:21,889
Likewise,

140
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:24,558
try not to dwell too much
on the results you got today.

141
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:27,853
Come on, sir. Please stop.

142
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:30,064
-Seriously, please.
-Sir.

143
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:32,900
Why do the winds of my life
blow so strongly?

144
00:11:32,983 --> 00:11:35,277
Hyun-kyu, for you,
dwelling might do you some good.

145
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,115
As you all know,
parent-teacher conferences start today.

146
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,658
If any parents coming today

147
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:42,868
need to reschedule,
make sure to let me know.

148
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:44,829
-Yes.
-Yes.

149
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:49,250
I'm almost at school.

150
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:51,419
I'm done for.

151
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:55,589
Yes, ma'am. So if you would look here,

152
00:11:57,341 --> 00:11:59,218
it's a lucky number.

153
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:01,470
Does she think she's
Genghis Khan or Wang Geon?

154
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:04,014
She didn't have to unify her grade
across all subjects.

155
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:06,142
Adjusting after the transfer

156
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:08,519
seems to have left her
less prepared for the exams.

157
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:09,937
Well…

158
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:11,730
She won't be able to go

159
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:14,608
to colleges in Seoul
with these grades, right?

160
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:17,236
Yes. I mean, no.

161
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:18,446
This is so upsetting.

162
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:20,781
But it's not too late.

163
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:24,577
Starting now, she can still
work on her grades…

164
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:30,666
Ma'am!

165
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:36,672
Did you…

166
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:39,091
see that?

167
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:43,304
What was there to see?

168
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,684
It's okay. You can overcome this.

169
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:51,604
It's possible to overcome?

170
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:07,620
"Eyebrows for men and women.
Semi-permanent eyebrow tattoos."

171
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:15,377
TEACHERS' LOUNGE

172
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:21,800
Mom!

173
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:39,485
Oh, my goodness!

174
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:40,444
Is that Lee Ju-hun?

175
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:41,737
-Amazing!
-Isn't that Lee Ju-hun?

176
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,572
That's him. What's he doing here?

177
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,199
Goodness!

178
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:51,789
I was blinded, so I thought
someone had turned on the lights.

179
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:54,208
Turns out it was you.

180
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:56,210
Hello, I'm Soo-ho's homeroom teacher.

181
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:59,588
Nice to meet you. I'm Soo-ho's dad.

182
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:02,841
Mr. Han, it's not right
to make Korea's biggest star

183
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:04,343
come all the way to the school!

184
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:07,263
You should have conducted a home visit!
Apologize to him.

185
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:08,180
Apologize now!

186
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:09,890
I'm sorry for… What?

187
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:10,891
It's all right.

188
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:12,810
I've been curious about my son's school.

189
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:13,936
Mom!

190
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:15,354
Is this the guidance office?

191
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:17,106
Yes. Come this way.

192
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:18,816
"I'll buy you with my money!"

193
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:26,115
I'm a huge fan of Love Maze.

194
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:29,076
Can I get your autograph here?

195
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:33,539
-I love you.
-Can I get one too?

196
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:35,249
-Can I also get…
-Sure.

197
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:36,333
I'm the music teacher here.

198
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:38,002
-Can I get one too?
-But this…

199
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:40,379
-It's a report card.
-Please.

200
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:43,632
-I've been your fan forever.
-Goodness!

201
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:44,633
Take it.

202
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:45,801
My turn.

203
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:48,470
Mom.

204
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:50,890
-You know your movie…
-I teach music here…

205
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,604
Lee Soo-ho, Lee Soo-ho

206
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:59,106
Hey, Soo-ho, hey, Soo-ho

207
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:00,566
What are you doing?

208
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:02,401
Seriously?

209
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:04,612
We were comrades on the basketball court.

210
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:07,239
That was an NBA-level set play.

211
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,247
-You?
-Hey, this is huge!

212
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:16,415
-What?
-Hey, Soo-ho!

213
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:18,584
Your dad is Lee Ju-hun?

214
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:20,002
-What?
-The famous Lee Ju-hun?

215
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:21,545
Yes, Lee Ju-hun the celebrity!

216
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:22,504
What? That's crazy!

217
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,548
Wait, seriously?

218
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:25,925
Lee Ju-hun?

219
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:28,010
People saw him
outside the guidance office.

220
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:30,220
That's crazy, Soo-ho.

221
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:31,680
My mom's a huge fan.

222
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,933
Can I ask for his autograph--

223
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:36,352
-Hey…
-Seriously?

224
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:39,730
The genes do carry, I see.

225
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:41,815
-Be quiet already.
-He said he didn't have a family.

226
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:43,567
Kangsu, did you know?

227
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,196
Soo-ho hates people finding out.

228
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:49,490
So that's why he didn't tell us.

229
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:52,076
Lee Ju-hun is the CEO
of Move Entertainment.

230
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:53,661
Soo-ho's basically an heir to the empire.

231
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:56,330
I always wondered
why he snubbed other people.

232
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:58,666
Turns out he belongs to
a totally different world.

233
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,250
Indeed.

234
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:02,461
He's from a different world.

235
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:04,713
Right. Didn't Lee Ju-hun's wife pass away?

236
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:06,340
-So Soo-ho doesn't have a--
-Hey.

237
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:08,926
Stop with the nonsense,
shut up, and eat your lunch.

238
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:15,432
-Soo-ho is the top of the school.
-Hello.

239
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:17,559
He is a model student, a good sportsman,

240
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:20,145
and a handsome youth,
just like his father.

241
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:22,022
I couldn't find a flaw even if I tried.

242
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:23,691
Is that so?

243
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:25,150
Then I'll see you again.

244
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:27,611
-Of course, thanks for coming.
-Lee Ju-hun's here.

245
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:29,405
-Look. It's Lee Ju-hun.
-Lee Ju-hun?

246
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,281
-It's true.
-You're so good-looking!

247
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:33,200
-You're so handsome!
-He's a celebrity!

248
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:34,910
-Come on, take a picture.
-Hurry.

249
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,954
-Hurry up and take it.
-Wait a second.

250
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:38,414
Take one for me too!

251
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:42,126
-It's true!
-He's so good-looking!

252
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:43,419
You're so handsome!

253
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:46,964
Where did she go?

254
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:52,052
Did you have a good talk?

255
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:53,846
Yes.

256
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,849
-Hey, Soo-ho.
-Why did you come?

257
00:16:56,932 --> 00:16:58,517
Looks like it's lunchtime.

258
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,894
-Did you have lunch?
-I told you not to come here.

259
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:03,355
Don't you think it's brazen of you

260
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:05,691
to do this after all these years?

261
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,819
Mr. Lee!

262
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:12,239
-Mom, why are you still here?
-I met with Ju-young's teacher too.

263
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:13,615
Go on. Get in the car.

264
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:14,908
But Mr. Lee is over there!

265
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:15,951
Mr. Lee!

266
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,077
Mom!

267
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:20,539
-We meet again.
-Yes.

268
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:25,377
This must be your son.

269
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:29,256
You have a handsome son over there.

270
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:32,176
Is that right?

271
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:35,429
You're in the same class as Soo-ho, right?

272
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:38,557
Yes. Hello.

273
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,767
Excuse me.

274
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:48,817
Does he have an attitude in school too?

275
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:50,861
Yes, well…

276
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:51,904
Maybe a little?

277
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:55,157
-Let's go, Mom. Come on.
-Let go of me.

278
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,911
I thought it was a shame
to only get your autograph earlier.

279
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:01,288
Can I get a picture with you, please?

280
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:18,013
Did you have to…

281
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:20,474
abandon Se-yeon like that?

282
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:22,976
Do you think I'm the one to blame?

283
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:23,894
Seo-jun.

284
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:25,896
You're not the only one grieving.

285
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:27,481
He was so helpless!

286
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:31,151
You could have shielded him from it all!

287
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:32,945
Where are your manners?

288
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:37,991
Do I look like a philanthropist
who takes care of helpless kids?

289
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:42,663
How is it a problem
to apply company policy

290
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:44,957
to an artist who raised a scandal?

291
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:54,716
You should have come instead of Mom.

292
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:58,637
Rip up my nationwide exam report card
when Mom gets home, okay?

293
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:01,849
Spicy pork?

294
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,185
Okay. Make sure it's spicy.

295
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:07,396
Sure. I love you, Dad.

296
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:08,772
Bye!

297
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:12,568
Kangsu.

298
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:14,778
Why rip up your report card?

299
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:17,656
My mom got Lee Ju-hun's autograph
on my report card.

300
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:19,867
On the front or the back?

301
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:21,368
The front.

302
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:23,829
That is upsetting.

303
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:28,250
Anyhow, my dad is the only person
who cares about me in my family.

304
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,127
Why? Because he makes you spicy pork?

305
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:35,716
You must be close with him.

306
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:36,633
Lucky you.

307
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:38,802
You think I'm lucky
when my dad's out of a job?

308
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:41,889
You think I'm lucky
when he somehow cost us our home?

309
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,418
Mom, this is embarrassing.

310
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:12,836
You look horrible here.

311
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:14,671
My face hardly matters.

312
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:15,589
What matters

313
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:17,925
is Ju-hun looks good in the picture.

314
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:22,095
But the camera doesn't do him justice.

315
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:24,223
His face was glowing, you know.

316
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:31,063
This back-alley Adonis
and the nation's heartthrob

317
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:32,856
stand on entirely different levels.

318
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:40,155
Still.

319
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:43,825
How could you get an autograph
on your daughter's report card?

320
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:44,910
This is a report card?

321
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:48,121
It needs decent grades to count as one.
How embarrassing.

322
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:49,748
Ju-young,

323
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:53,835
cover Ju-kyung's name so it can't be seen.

324
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:56,546
All sevens.

325
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:57,881
LEVEL SEVEN

326
00:20:57,965 --> 00:20:59,883
LIM JU-KYUNG

327
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:01,593
She sure has bought a lot.

328
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:05,389
You may be her mom,
but you're crossing the line here.

329
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:06,723
Stop right there.

330
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:10,394
Who are you trying to fool?

331
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:16,608
This is the only way
for her to snap out of it.

332
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,115
-I'm home.
-Ju-kyung…

333
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:26,285
Mom.

334
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:28,704
Isn't that my makeup?

335
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:29,621
Yes.

336
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:31,498
I'm throwing it all away.

337
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:32,958
But I haven't used them up.

338
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:35,294
Should I throw you away
even though you're not grown up yet?

339
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:39,298
Please, not the makeup.
These are my lifelines.

340
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:40,841
I'll make sure I rank 20 places…

341
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:43,510
No, 30 places higher this time.
Come on, please?

342
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:46,179
Please tell me something that makes sense.

343
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:48,849
Come on, Mom. Please?

344
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:57,983
Losing is also a bad habit.

345
00:21:58,066 --> 00:21:59,651
And a bad habit must be fixed.

346
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:02,446
I didn't invest in you
to see this kind of report card!

347
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:04,781
If you can't beat
the son of such a lowly family,

348
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:07,367
how do you expect to get into
a medical school in Seoul?

349
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:38,356
You had it rough, my darlings.

350
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:41,193
I'll keep you safe no matter what.

351
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:47,741
Why do I still have this?

352
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:57,542
A friend of Jeong Se-yeon,

353
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:00,045
and the son of Lee Ju-hun.

354
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:02,005
Why does he have so many secrets?

355
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:06,551
Is he not on good terms with his dad?

356
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:08,762
Is that why he said
he didn't have a family?

357
00:23:09,387 --> 00:23:10,388
Whatever.

358
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:13,100
Why should I care
when he all but cut ties with me?

359
00:23:16,436 --> 00:23:17,729
Stop worrying about him.

360
00:23:19,606 --> 00:23:21,024
To prevent blood from clotting,

361
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:23,110
you have to quickly get it onto the glass.

362
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:24,444
-Yes.
-Yes.

363
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:26,154
Make sure to put the cover slip on.

364
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:27,072
-Yes.
-Yes.

365
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:31,243
First, check with your eyes
if the color has changed.

366
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:35,122
Observe the cell's distortion
using a microscope next.

367
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:36,498
-Yes.
-Yes.

368
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:37,791
Ju-kyung, look at this.

369
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:19,875
Let go.

370
00:24:23,753 --> 00:24:24,796
I said, let go.

371
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,716
You can just say it.
You don't have to grab me.

372
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:29,759
I have nothing to say, so let me…

373
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:39,144
What's with you guys? Did you fight?

374
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:02,792
Ju-kyung, are you free after school?

375
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:09,299
I feel so much better
after this rich drink.

376
00:25:09,382 --> 00:25:10,425
Thanks, Go-un.

377
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:13,136
I wanted to treat you to something nicer.

378
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:15,013
This is great. I didn't even do much.

379
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:19,100
"Your language is foul,
so I figured it needed cleaning."

380
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,519
Don't you remember?

381
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:24,856
I'm so grateful for that day
and the day of the festival.

382
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:27,025
I'm so glad to see you happy.

383
00:25:27,108 --> 00:25:30,737
By the way,
did they leave you alone after that?

384
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:33,323
They talk behind my back.

385
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:36,243
They say that I wore a bunch of makeup
to get myself on stage

386
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:39,162
and that I must have a huge ego
not to wear makeup again.

387
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:42,540
Don't those comments hurt you?

388
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:44,918
If I started hating my face
because of their words,

389
00:25:45,001 --> 00:25:48,463
I'd be accepting it as a fact
that I'm ugly.

390
00:25:49,422 --> 00:25:51,591
So I decided to ignore whatever they say

391
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:53,009
and live as myself.

392
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:58,682
You are so awesome.

393
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:05,647
Why does the thought
of living as myself scare me?

394
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:08,525
I'm so lame.

395
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:10,735
Right, Ju-kyung.

396
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:13,571
Can you teach me how to do my makeup?

397
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:15,365
Makeup?

398
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:17,325
Obviously,

399
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:19,619
men look their best when…

400
00:26:27,877 --> 00:26:28,712
Let's get to it.

401
00:26:55,613 --> 00:26:57,073
What? You were home?

402
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:01,202
Please wear some clothes around the house.

403
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:06,499
You're here.

404
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:23,308
Well…

405
00:27:23,391 --> 00:27:25,185
Hey, I didn't see anything!

406
00:27:25,935 --> 00:27:26,770
I mean it!

407
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:33,568
Seriously?

408
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:35,445
Man, seriously?

409
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:41,284
I told him not to. Serves him right.

410
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:44,454
My little brother is the same way at home.

411
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:47,248
He's actually in the same grade as you.

412
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:49,125
Do you know Lim Ju-young by any chance?

413
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:51,002
No. He must be in a different class.

414
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:52,337
You don't need to know him.

415
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:54,339
He's a nobody.

416
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:56,591
Thank you so much for today.

417
00:27:56,674 --> 00:27:57,759
Don't mention it.

418
00:27:57,842 --> 00:27:59,302
No need to see me off. Bye!

419
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:02,263
Take care, Ju-kyung!

420
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:08,144
Is she leaving?

421
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:12,440
Ju-kyung!

422
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:15,068
Ju-kyung.

423
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:18,905
I'm sorry.

424
00:28:18,988 --> 00:28:20,323
You, seriously…

425
00:28:20,907 --> 00:28:23,368
Are you resorting to hair-pulling now?

426
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:24,285
Then…

427
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:26,287
you should've stopped when I called.

428
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:28,665
What do you want?

429
00:28:28,748 --> 00:28:29,582
What?

430
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:31,751
Just because.

431
00:28:32,335 --> 00:28:33,169
Just because?

432
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:36,464
-Let's go. I'll walk you.
-No thanks.

433
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:38,466
It's a short bus ride, so there's no need.

434
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:41,678
I never said I'd walk you to your home.
I meant to the bus stop.

435
00:28:41,761 --> 00:28:44,264
I know where it is. Go home.

436
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:47,225
I'm grateful for your care of Go-un.

437
00:28:47,308 --> 00:28:48,518
I can't just go home.

438
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:50,437
What did you just say?

439
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:52,439
-What?
-You're what?

440
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:54,190
What?

441
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:55,650
You just said you're grateful.

442
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:57,736
Did I?

443
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:00,405
I never expected to hear
those words from you.

444
00:29:00,488 --> 00:29:01,948
Say it clearly, one more time.

445
00:29:02,031 --> 00:29:03,408
I'm not going to say it again.

446
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:04,325
You heard me.

447
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:05,785
I didn't get to hear it right.

448
00:29:10,665 --> 00:29:11,791
I'm sorry.

449
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:13,960
You're sorry?

450
00:29:14,043 --> 00:29:15,378
I'm not going to repeat it.

451
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:20,091
Hey,

452
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:22,135
I'm the one who's sorry.

453
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:25,847
-What for?
-Actually…

454
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:28,099
I saw everything.

455
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:29,559
You saw what?

456
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:32,187
Your boxers.

457
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:35,190
Roar!

458
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:38,401
Hey, you said you didn't see anything!

459
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:46,701
Hey there. I haven't seen you in a while.

460
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:50,705
I haven't seen Ju-bal either.
Are you all taking midterms?

461
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:55,460
Lim Ju-kyung!

462
00:29:55,543 --> 00:29:58,213
I know you're here reading comics
instead of studying!

463
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:00,965
Goodness.

464
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:02,634
Aren't you Soo-ho?

465
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:03,760
What's with your voice?

466
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:17,190
Mom, I'm home.

467
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:19,400
I feel much better now.

468
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:22,737
Dad, I'm hungry. Can you fix me something?

469
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:24,697
You're home, sweetie?

470
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:30,662
Mom.

471
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:32,914
The person next to you…

472
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:35,291
is that Lee Soo-ho?

473
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:37,335
Silly girl.

474
00:30:37,418 --> 00:30:38,711
It's Soo-ho all right.

475
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:40,004
And not a sculpture.

476
00:30:41,464 --> 00:30:42,549
Darn it!

477
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:50,098
Mom, why would you bring him home?

478
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:52,016
I wanted to fix a nice dinner

479
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,060
for a classmate of my daughter.

480
00:30:54,143 --> 00:30:55,937
Mom, do you hate me or something?

481
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,605
Why would you do this to me?

482
00:30:58,857 --> 00:30:59,691
Try it.

483
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:03,027
Gosh, I like Dad's better.

484
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:10,785
Soo-ho,

485
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:14,372
would you say you're a friend of Ju-kyung

486
00:31:14,455 --> 00:31:16,457
or her boyfriend?

487
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:18,084
We're not close at all.

488
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:19,711
I wouldn't say we're friends.

489
00:31:19,794 --> 00:31:21,212
Why would you ask such a thing?

490
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:23,715
Is that right?

491
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:29,178
Then I hope you keep it that way, Soo-ho.

492
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:31,264
Hey, aren't you busy today?

493
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:33,892
I'm not busy at all.

494
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:37,270
What are you talking about?
You have academy today.

495
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:39,272
What? Academy?

496
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:40,857
It's not today.

497
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:43,026
Right?

498
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:45,361
You must be hungry, Soo-ho.

499
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:47,530
Honey, bring out the table with Ju-young.

500
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:50,283
We'll have a big meal
like it's a celebration.

501
00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:51,701
This is not a celebration.

502
00:31:52,827 --> 00:31:54,037
What are you doing?

503
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,497
Sitting there like a wet blanket.

504
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:00,877
What?

505
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:15,391
You are not my older brother,
so I'll call you whatever.

506
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:18,436
Hey, Mr. Lee Soo-ho.

507
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,064
What is it, Mr. Lim Ju-young?

508
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:23,983
Aren't you the guy who knows about
Ju-kyung's no-makeup face?

509
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:26,319
I'd say so.

510
00:32:26,402 --> 00:32:28,029
Now that you've found her out,

511
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:30,156
are you blackmailing her?

512
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:31,449
That's not the case.

513
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:37,497
She seems uncomfortable around you,
so why did you come to her place?

514
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:38,957
Do you like her or something?

515
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:40,792
That one's correct.

516
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:47,048
Interesting.

517
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:49,509
You're a funny guy.

518
00:32:49,592 --> 00:32:50,927
I see you've got jokes.

519
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:57,600
But don't joke like that with her.
She might take it seriously and get hurt.

520
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:01,479
From what I hear,
you're the one who hurts her.

521
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:04,607
You treat her poorly and look down on her.

522
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:05,692
Is that what she said?

523
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:09,779
You must be her actual friend
to share that with you.

524
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:12,407
I admit it. Guilty as charged.

525
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:15,576
Hey, Mr. Lee Soo-ho,

526
00:33:16,452 --> 00:33:17,954
use your strength, won't you?

527
00:33:30,758 --> 00:33:32,135
This…

528
00:33:32,218 --> 00:33:35,179
This is the table I bought
when I married my husband.

529
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:39,642
-I'm so sorry.
-No need to be sorry.

530
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:42,812
I might not get married again,
but I can always get a new table.

531
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:50,278
I'd like to give you a wrap.

532
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:51,654
Here. Open your mouth.

533
00:33:52,488 --> 00:33:53,865
-Thank you.
-Go on.

534
00:33:57,827 --> 00:33:58,703
Is it good?

535
00:34:00,496 --> 00:34:03,666
We could've gotten beef instead of pork
if we weren't broke.

536
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:07,295
Honey, they say that pork
is healthier than beef these days.

537
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:10,339
Of course.

538
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:14,177
Hey, put that down.

539
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:18,514
Ju-kyung's personality needs some work,

540
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:21,225
but now her grades
could also use a lot of work.

541
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:23,227
Mom, you don't have to share everything.

542
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:25,730
I hear you're the top student?

543
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:27,732
Can you please help Ju-kyung out?

544
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:29,901
-You should study with her.
-Yes.

545
00:34:29,984 --> 00:34:30,818
That is,

546
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:33,946
not by yourselves, but as a group.

547
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,698
Why would I study with him?

548
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:38,993
Excuse me.

549
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,079
This is the real deal, right?

550
00:34:41,662 --> 00:34:42,747
Can I try it on?

551
00:34:43,539 --> 00:34:45,708
You know. Just to see how it fits.

552
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:47,251
-That brat.
-Come on.

553
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:50,379
-If you like it, you can have it.
-Soo-ho!

554
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:52,423
I would be forever grateful!

555
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:54,592
-Hey, put it down.
-Seriously.

556
00:34:54,675 --> 00:34:56,594
Why do you keep poking me
with your dirty foot?

557
00:34:56,677 --> 00:34:59,097
-Let go, okay? Come on.
-Stop that.

558
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,640
You little brats!

559
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:11,526
Soo-ho's with us.

560
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:14,487
Can we please enjoy the food in peace?

561
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:16,447
Lim Ju-bal keeps poking me with her foot.

562
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:18,783
-Lim Ju-young, let go.
-Stop poking me!

563
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:21,035
Seriously? You really want to go there?

564
00:35:32,713 --> 00:35:34,799
Ju-kyung. Let's eat.

565
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:42,932
Soo-ho, do you have a little brother?

566
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:45,059
No, I don't.

567
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,270
Then can I be your little brother?

568
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:49,438
-I don't want to be hers anymore.
-Hey.

569
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:51,023
I don't want to give my son away.

570
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:53,734
But if I have to,
I'd give you my daughter.

571
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:56,320
They're not even legal adults yet.

572
00:35:56,863 --> 00:35:58,906
I'm only kidding.
Don't take it so seriously.

573
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:00,700
Anyway, Soo-ho.

574
00:36:00,783 --> 00:36:02,869
We have such deep connections with you.

575
00:36:02,952 --> 00:36:04,120
Excuse me?

576
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:05,872
My eldest daughter
works at Move Entertainment,

577
00:36:05,955 --> 00:36:07,415
your dad's company.

578
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:12,211
-I see.
-Right, let's grill these and clean it up.

579
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:15,631
She used to work for a major company
and went to Move last year.

580
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:17,383
She has always been so clever.

581
00:36:17,466 --> 00:36:21,095
Lee Ju-hun must be happy
to have an employee like her.

582
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:30,646
I'm back.

583
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:35,943
I'm home.

584
00:36:44,076 --> 00:36:45,244
I'm thirsty.

585
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:46,704
Help yourself.

586
00:36:46,787 --> 00:36:47,747
There's no water.

587
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:50,333
-She rarely drinks,
-Water.

588
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:52,335
-but guess she did today.
-Where is it?

589
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:57,173
Goodness, Hee-kyung!

590
00:36:57,256 --> 00:36:58,591
The power's out again.

591
00:36:58,674 --> 00:37:00,468
Gosh, this place is such a dump.

592
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:02,220
We just need to find the circuit breakers.

593
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:03,596
-Circuit what?
-Where's my phone?

594
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:06,849
I'm sorry, Soo-ho.
Can you please step aside?

595
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:08,059
-Sure.
-Thanks.

596
00:37:12,104 --> 00:37:13,689
What's this?

597
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:15,608
-That's my foot.
-I see, your foot.

598
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:18,819
-Why is the couch all the way up here?
-That's my butt, come on.

599
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:20,279
Why are you hitting me?

600
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:23,074
-What?
-My gosh.

601
00:37:23,157 --> 00:37:24,158
-Goodness!
-What is it?

602
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:26,744
-I found it.
-Come on, why would you…

603
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:29,372
Help us!

604
00:37:32,124 --> 00:37:33,209
-It hurts!
-Honey.

605
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:37,004
What is this?

606
00:37:40,174 --> 00:37:41,300
Goodness!

607
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:44,220
-Get off.
-My legs.

608
00:37:44,303 --> 00:37:45,388
I can't get up.

609
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:47,098
I just can't.

610
00:37:47,181 --> 00:37:49,392
-Honey.
-Honey.

611
00:37:52,728 --> 00:37:53,980
Goodness gracious.

612
00:37:54,897 --> 00:37:57,066
I just want to disappear.

613
00:37:57,733 --> 00:37:58,818
Seriously.

614
00:38:00,903 --> 00:38:02,738
-Honey.
-My back.

615
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:11,580
Why did you come with her?

616
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:13,541
You should have just said you were busy.

617
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:14,500
How could I?

618
00:38:15,084 --> 00:38:16,127
You're good at that.

619
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:19,130
Being cold and distant…

620
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:21,257
That's your specialty.

621
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:25,344
Great job putting up with
the bothersome task.

622
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:26,679
Bye.

623
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:34,562
It's embarrassing. Seriously.

624
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:35,855
Why are these here?

625
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:44,071
Hey, Ju-kyung.

626
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:46,699
Get up.

627
00:38:47,616 --> 00:38:48,451
What?

628
00:38:48,534 --> 00:38:49,994
How come you're still sleeping?

629
00:38:50,077 --> 00:38:52,538
I studied until dawn.

630
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:54,373
How did that happen?

631
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:56,667
You must be tired then.
Let's go to the sauna.

632
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:00,046
I need to cleanse myself of alcohol
and clear my hangover.

633
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:01,464
No. I don't feel like it.

634
00:39:01,547 --> 00:39:04,842
Why are you so down lately?
I'll get you something yummy. Come on.

635
00:39:04,925 --> 00:39:06,969
-I don't feel like eating.
-Really?

636
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:10,473
Not even spicy chicken feet?

637
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:11,891
Down.

638
00:39:12,391 --> 00:39:13,309
Down.

639
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:14,977
Hurry up.

640
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:16,604
-Some sweet rice drinks too.
-Sure.

641
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:17,521
And eggs!

642
00:39:19,231 --> 00:39:20,775
Let's go over there.

643
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:25,404
PINEWOOD SAUNA

644
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:31,160
#SPALAND #SAUNA #EATINGSHOW
#SWEATING #HOT #EGGS

645
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:38,459
This feels good.

646
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:43,506
It's so hot.

647
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:44,507
Gosh.

648
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:50,596
Why is it so hot here?

649
00:39:54,016 --> 00:39:56,894
Gosh. Why did he have to turn up here?

650
00:40:07,196 --> 00:40:10,533
Isn't this the hottest place here?
I don't like it when it's too hot.

651
00:40:10,616 --> 00:40:13,494
Can you call yourself a man
when you can't even handle this?

652
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,538
If you can't handle it,

653
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:18,541
go out and get me some ice cream.

654
00:40:18,624 --> 00:40:20,042
What are you talking about?

655
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:21,877
I can handle it. I just don't like it.

656
00:40:23,212 --> 00:40:25,256
-The loser treats the winner to eggs.
-Okay.

657
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:32,096
Gosh, I can't handle this!

658
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:35,766
Eggs and sweet rice drinks, please.

659
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:37,601
-Eggs, and…
-Chicken feet too.

660
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:39,854
Would you like them spicy?

661
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:56,412
You're quite high-maintenance.

662
00:40:57,955 --> 00:40:59,248
I'm sorry.

663
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:02,585
He was cute.

664
00:41:03,669 --> 00:41:06,130
Make it spicy enough
to burn the whole mouth.

665
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:16,056
Please leave.

666
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,017
I'm getting barbecued alive here.

667
00:41:19,059 --> 00:41:20,895
It's Saturday.
You're not meeting your girlfriend?

668
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:21,812
Girlfriend?

669
00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:23,564
What girlfriend?

670
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:26,859
"I'll only listen to you."

671
00:41:26,942 --> 00:41:28,527
You kidding? It's not like that.

672
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:31,238
Why not? Give it a shot.

673
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:32,823
Ju-kyung's really pretty.

674
00:41:33,407 --> 00:41:36,285
-Don't you think so?
-She's pretty? Are you blind?

675
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:38,245
That punk.

676
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:40,539
Open your eyes
and look at her again, okay?

677
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:46,754
Hey. That lady hasn't been moving
since we got here.

678
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:51,050
What if she passed out
because of the heat?

679
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:54,303
Ma'am, are you all right?

680
00:41:54,386 --> 00:41:56,180
I'm not passed out.

681
00:41:56,263 --> 00:41:59,642
I've got aches all over my body,
so I'm just enjoying this sauna session.

682
00:42:00,893 --> 00:42:04,188
-It's so refreshing.
-You're an expert, ma'am.

683
00:42:04,271 --> 00:42:05,814
She really is an expert.

684
00:42:07,316 --> 00:42:08,234
Hey,

685
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:11,320
in the face of an expert,
I think this match is pointless.

686
00:42:11,904 --> 00:42:13,656
I'm just going to get my ice cream.

687
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:19,036
Get me some eggs, Kim Cho-rong!

688
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:21,789
I can't stand it anymore either.

689
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,635
Isn't it too hot?

690
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:38,097
-You'll get something cheap, right?
-What would you like?

691
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:42,601
Eggs.

692
00:42:43,477 --> 00:42:44,353
Hey.

693
00:42:44,436 --> 00:42:46,730
-Come have some chicken feet, Lim Ju--
-No!

694
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:52,945
LEE JU-HUN

695
00:42:53,028 --> 00:42:55,072
-What? You met Lee Ju-hun?
-Yes.

696
00:42:55,948 --> 00:42:57,992
He must've been a feast for the eyes.

697
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:00,327
What's that?

698
00:43:02,037 --> 00:43:03,372
Ju-kyung's report card?

699
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:08,210
I mean,

700
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:11,213
how can all three of your kids
be good students?

701
00:43:12,464 --> 00:43:14,008
If a girl is pretty,

702
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:18,637
I mean, kind, that's enough.

703
00:43:20,806 --> 00:43:22,266
I'll be off then.

704
00:43:28,355 --> 00:43:31,900
Lee Ju-hun's autograph
should be handed down as an heirloom.

705
00:43:31,984 --> 00:43:33,944
Why did I get it on her report card

706
00:43:34,028 --> 00:43:36,030
so that my descendants
will see her grades?

707
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:40,618
Welcome.

708
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:43,746
Hello.

709
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:45,623
Goodness. Mr. Han.

710
00:43:57,009 --> 00:43:59,762
#SPALAND #SAUNA #EATINGSHOW
#SWEATING #HOT #EGGS

711
00:44:00,929 --> 00:44:01,930
She's having fun.

712
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:11,482
Please have a seat here.

713
00:44:11,565 --> 00:44:12,941
-Thank you.
-Sure.

714
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:51,939
JEONG SE-YEON

715
00:44:55,150 --> 00:45:00,114
JEONG SE-YEON

716
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:13,752
-Hey.
-Please answer your phone.

717
00:45:13,836 --> 00:45:15,963
-Where are your manners?
-Turn it off.

718
00:46:00,674 --> 00:46:03,635
Hey, no one would have recognized you
without any makeup.

719
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:05,345
Did you have to run away like that?

720
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:07,473
You never know.

721
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:10,976
This must be how criminals feel
sneaking around.

722
00:46:11,059 --> 00:46:14,271
Thanks to you, I didn't get to enjoy
the sauna or the chicken feet.

723
00:46:14,354 --> 00:46:16,148
Hey. Let's go get some burgers.

724
00:46:16,982 --> 00:46:19,401
-Here's my card, so go get some.
-You go get them.

725
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:22,446
What about the car? Hurry and go.

726
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:26,074
-Then I'll have two.
-Sure.

727
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:33,499
-You're going out wearing that?
-Yes.

728
00:46:36,335 --> 00:46:39,546
#SPALAND #SAUNA #EATINGSHOW
#SWEATING #HOT #EGGS

729
00:46:48,347 --> 00:46:49,473
She's really here.

730
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:57,064
-Enjoy.
-Today is all right. You can eat today.

731
00:46:57,147 --> 00:46:59,900
-What?
-They say Han Seo-jun kicked your ass,

732
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:01,944
and that the Shinhwa High guys
did the same.

733
00:47:02,027 --> 00:47:03,737
What? Who the hell…

734
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:07,783
-I feel shitty.
-What are you going to have?

735
00:47:07,866 --> 00:47:09,660
Just get me whatever and come up.

736
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:11,995
-So, then…
-Don't be like that.

737
00:47:12,621 --> 00:47:15,624
-Get me some french fries.
-Number 82, your order is ready.

738
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:17,834
I'll have a regular burger,

739
00:47:17,918 --> 00:47:20,337
-Thank you.
-a premium, and an original burger for me.

740
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:21,255
Then a premium…

741
00:47:21,338 --> 00:47:24,341
I left because of parking enforcement.
Get a cab home with my card.

742
00:47:27,886 --> 00:47:29,304
Lim Ju-kyung?

743
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:31,473
Hey.

744
00:47:33,725 --> 00:47:35,018
It's been a while, Dumpling.

745
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:36,353
You're still ugly.

746
00:47:36,436 --> 00:47:37,688
Didn't you get uglier?

747
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:40,274
I'll get going.

748
00:47:41,233 --> 00:47:44,319
Hey, I'm not done.
Where do you think you're going?

749
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:47,364
Where'd you transfer to?

750
00:47:49,032 --> 00:47:50,701
I moved to the countryside.

751
00:47:51,368 --> 00:47:53,203
I'm just visiting my relatives today.

752
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:56,373
You know there's a rumor you left
because I bullied you, don't you?

753
00:47:57,916 --> 00:48:00,711
What have you been telling people?

754
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:03,964
Why would you…

755
00:48:04,673 --> 00:48:06,842
make me out to be the bad guy?

756
00:48:07,676 --> 00:48:08,802
I didn't do that.

757
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:13,765
That'll hurt.

758
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:19,187
Hey, give me your number.

759
00:48:32,826 --> 00:48:33,994
My wallet.

760
00:48:36,121 --> 00:48:37,080
My student ID.

761
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:40,917
-What an unconventional design.
-It's our lucky day.

762
00:48:41,001 --> 00:48:42,836
-So luxurious.
-Her taste hasn't changed.

763
00:49:10,822 --> 00:49:11,657
Here.

764
00:49:20,248 --> 00:49:21,291
Are you okay?

765
00:49:22,459 --> 00:49:23,377
Am I okay?

766
00:49:23,877 --> 00:49:24,753
Why?

767
00:49:25,754 --> 00:49:27,798
Did you help me again
because you pitied me?

768
00:49:27,881 --> 00:49:30,550
We're not even close,
so you could've just left.

769
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:33,470
Who are you to get involved and help me?
It's embarrassing!

770
00:49:33,553 --> 00:49:35,347
-Ju-kyung.
-You warned me.

771
00:49:37,891 --> 00:49:39,976
When I got excited
thinking that we were close,

772
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:41,436
you told me not to kid myself.

773
00:49:42,729 --> 00:49:44,815
You said it was bothersome and annoying.

774
00:49:45,941 --> 00:49:46,900
Ju-kyung.

775
00:49:46,983 --> 00:49:48,902
So I gave you your space.

776
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:52,114
You drew a line first,
so why are you doing this?

777
00:49:52,864 --> 00:49:55,075
Why are you confusing me
by going back and forth?

778
00:49:55,867 --> 00:49:56,827
Ju-kyung.

779
00:50:00,205 --> 00:50:01,123
It was them, right?

780
00:50:04,459 --> 00:50:05,627
The ones who bullied you…

781
00:50:08,046 --> 00:50:09,297
before you transferred.

782
00:50:13,885 --> 00:50:15,178
You must've been so shocked.

783
00:50:20,142 --> 00:50:21,184
And scared, too.

784
00:50:44,791 --> 00:50:46,293
I think I just saw Soo-ho.

785
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:47,502
-Soo-ho?
-Yes.

786
00:50:48,795 --> 00:50:49,671
What is it?

787
00:50:51,131 --> 00:50:53,049
-There's Kim Cho-rong.
-What?

788
00:50:55,343 --> 00:50:56,386
Not again.

789
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:59,347
What are you talking about?
Let's go, I'm hungry.

790
00:50:59,431 --> 00:51:00,724
But it was him.

791
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:04,227
Did he leave?

792
00:51:04,978 --> 00:51:05,896
What?

793
00:51:10,609 --> 00:51:11,526
No.

794
00:51:14,613 --> 00:51:15,530
Not yet.

795
00:51:17,115 --> 00:51:18,200
What do I do?

796
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:26,750
It's okay.

797
00:51:29,628 --> 00:51:30,879
You'll be okay now.

798
00:52:00,659 --> 00:52:02,410
Get home safe without getting caught.

799
00:52:22,681 --> 00:52:25,392
-That place makes a great hot pot.
-It's not that place.

800
00:52:25,475 --> 00:52:27,310
-What are you talking about?
-Well.

801
00:52:27,894 --> 00:52:29,271
Take a look at this asshole.

802
00:52:29,354 --> 00:52:30,480
It's Han Seo-jun.

803
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:33,275
Let's get burgers next time.

804
00:52:34,693 --> 00:52:35,527
Let's go.

805
00:52:36,027 --> 00:52:36,945
Hey,

806
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:40,115
why do you run away every time you see me?

807
00:52:40,198 --> 00:52:42,951
Remember we used to hang out together?

808
00:52:43,034 --> 00:52:44,411
And now you're drawing a line?

809
00:52:45,245 --> 00:52:46,329
That hurts my feelings.

810
00:52:46,413 --> 00:52:48,582
Let's not make a scene, okay?

811
00:52:48,665 --> 00:52:51,376
All this pomp is totally intimidating.

812
00:52:53,753 --> 00:52:55,046
I'm sorry.

813
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:56,840
I thought it was a garbage can.

814
00:52:58,925 --> 00:52:59,926
You want to die?

815
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:02,012
Leave if you don't want to die yourself.

816
00:53:02,095 --> 00:53:04,848
I don't want to deal
with thugs like you anymore.

817
00:53:08,518 --> 00:53:11,313
-You little--
-Sung-yong, let's just go.

818
00:53:11,396 --> 00:53:13,690
What? You want to fight right here?

819
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:16,693
When should we do it?

820
00:53:17,277 --> 00:53:18,153
Tell me.

821
00:53:18,945 --> 00:53:19,779
We'll see.

822
00:53:21,197 --> 00:53:22,282
Let's just go.

823
00:53:23,617 --> 00:53:24,451
Come on.

824
00:53:37,255 --> 00:53:39,132
Don't blink, Mr. Han.

825
00:53:44,846 --> 00:53:46,890
We'll leave it like that for 15 minutes.

826
00:53:47,474 --> 00:53:51,186
They might look awkward at first,
but they will look natural soon.

827
00:53:51,269 --> 00:53:55,523
A set of dark eyebrows on your face

828
00:53:55,607 --> 00:53:57,734
will be like the icing on the cake.

829
00:53:58,318 --> 00:53:59,235
Thank you.

830
00:53:59,319 --> 00:54:01,112
It's raining outside, Mom.

831
00:54:01,196 --> 00:54:02,072
What?

832
00:54:06,284 --> 00:54:07,243
Mr. Han Jun-woo?

833
00:54:08,828 --> 00:54:09,704
Ms. Lim Hee-kyung?

834
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:12,832
Mr. Han,

835
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:16,086
are you acquainted
with my eldest daughter?

836
00:54:16,169 --> 00:54:18,004
-Yes, no?
-No?

837
00:54:19,130 --> 00:54:19,965
"Eldest daughter"?

838
00:54:21,007 --> 00:54:22,759
-Ju-kyung's older sister?
-Yes.

839
00:54:25,762 --> 00:54:27,555
My shoes.

840
00:54:27,639 --> 00:54:29,224
Do you need your shoes?

841
00:54:29,307 --> 00:54:30,600
-Hey!
-What?

842
00:54:31,726 --> 00:54:33,353
Why? What's wrong, Jun-woo?

843
00:54:33,436 --> 00:54:34,896
-Goodbye.
-What?

844
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:37,107
Where are you going? Jun-woo!

845
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:40,527
Jun-woo!

846
00:54:45,031 --> 00:54:46,032
Jun-woo!

847
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:56,960
I got you.

848
00:55:01,923 --> 00:55:03,633
You might catch a cold. Take this.

849
00:55:12,017 --> 00:55:14,436
-What are you doing?
-You're getting drenched.

850
00:55:14,519 --> 00:55:15,729
You take it.

851
00:55:15,812 --> 00:55:17,313
I'm all right. Just take it home.

852
00:55:17,397 --> 00:55:19,566
No. You'll get all wet.

853
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:22,318
You're getting wet now. Come here.

854
00:55:35,165 --> 00:55:36,583
I can't take it anymore.

855
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:39,836
I'm going to do something naughty.

856
00:55:42,088 --> 00:55:43,548
Run away if you're scared.

857
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:08,948
Get home safe!

858
00:56:11,242 --> 00:56:13,328
Please answer when I call you!

859
00:56:58,498 --> 00:57:00,083
The passcode has been verified.

860
00:57:20,812 --> 00:57:25,358
JS: WE'LL MAKE IT ONE DAY! LET'S GO!
HAN SEO-JUN

861
00:58:23,708 --> 00:58:24,542
Se-yeon…

862
00:58:26,085 --> 00:58:27,170
What do I do?

863
00:58:37,764 --> 00:58:39,098
Lee Sung-yong, what a psycho.

864
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:41,184
Why is he calling me nonstop
since yesterday?

865
00:58:45,939 --> 00:58:46,773
Lim Ju-kyung?

866
00:58:48,775 --> 00:58:50,944
Wait, I was there too.

867
00:58:55,073 --> 00:58:56,533
Someone's pretending to be cute.

868
00:59:00,703 --> 00:59:04,207
Tarzan is wearing ten-won boxers

869
00:59:06,125 --> 00:59:07,001
Roar!

870
00:59:21,099 --> 00:59:21,975
Roar!

871
00:59:38,074 --> 00:59:42,078
-Please! Come on.
-Turn it.

872
00:59:42,161 --> 00:59:43,204
What's it going to be?

873
00:59:45,331 --> 00:59:47,000
-Hey, I bet on you!
-He's so good.

874
00:59:47,083 --> 00:59:50,211
-Hey, move. How did you…
-You need the right angle.

875
00:59:50,295 --> 00:59:51,129
Hey.

876
00:59:51,629 --> 00:59:54,173
I skipped school for you.
Are you really not coming?

877
00:59:55,091 --> 00:59:57,010
Let me have this game. Just one more.

878
00:59:57,093 --> 00:59:58,678
You just said that earlier.

879
00:59:58,761 --> 01:00:01,431
It'll be over soon.
Just sit down and wait a second, okay?

880
01:00:01,514 --> 01:00:03,182
Is Han Seo-jun still not picking up?

881
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:05,685
He's ignoring me. That arrogant punk.

882
01:00:10,315 --> 01:00:11,274
Hey, look.

883
01:00:12,317 --> 01:00:13,693
-Hey! This is crazy.
-Damn it.

884
01:00:13,776 --> 01:00:15,570
I know who Seo-jun's girlfriend is.

885
01:00:15,653 --> 01:00:16,487
What?

886
01:00:17,864 --> 01:00:19,115
Her name is Lim Ju-kyung.

887
01:00:23,286 --> 01:00:24,120
Lim Ju-kyung?

888
01:00:25,997 --> 01:00:27,415
This girl is also Lim Ju-kyung.

889
01:00:29,334 --> 01:00:30,543
This is ridiculous.

890
01:00:30,627 --> 01:00:32,295
How do she and Dumpling
have the same name…

891
01:00:34,881 --> 01:00:36,716
-They're the same.
-She's really pretty.

892
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:40,053
Hey, this is Han Seo-jun's girlfriend?

893
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:40,970
Really?

894
01:00:45,308 --> 01:00:46,517
That's crazy.

895
01:00:47,143 --> 01:00:49,062
I guess strange coincidences happen.

896
01:00:49,145 --> 01:00:50,229
Lim Ju-kyung?

897
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:51,314
So pretty.

898
01:00:54,901 --> 01:00:56,194
So today…

899
01:01:02,283 --> 01:01:04,744
-Work hard on your classes.
-What?

900
01:01:04,827 --> 01:01:05,870
-Sir?
-Excuse me?

901
01:01:07,664 --> 01:01:09,123
Today's absentee is Soo-ho…

902
01:01:09,207 --> 01:01:11,000
Soo-ho is absent today.

903
01:01:11,084 --> 01:01:12,126
So that's it.

904
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:15,797
-What? Excuse me?
-What was that?

905
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:17,840
No touching quotes today?

906
01:01:17,924 --> 01:01:20,009
Maybe he ran out of those.

907
01:01:20,093 --> 01:01:22,804
-Maybe he needed the bathroom?
-Speaking of, I need to go.

908
01:01:22,887 --> 01:01:24,639
-What are you saying?
-Hey.

909
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:26,599
Did you just…

910
01:01:27,225 --> 01:01:28,851
-What's going on?
-It's not that…

911
01:01:29,435 --> 01:01:30,395
Absent?

912
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:33,189
What is it?

913
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:35,525
What's up with Soo-ho?

914
01:01:40,113 --> 01:01:43,032
What's up, Soo-ho? Did something come up?

915
01:02:09,350 --> 01:02:11,185
How come you didn't come…

916
01:02:15,481 --> 01:02:17,316
You're doing okay, right?

917
01:02:23,322 --> 01:02:24,866
Get me melon ice cream.

918
01:02:25,450 --> 01:02:27,827
This punk keeps sending me on errands!

919
01:02:35,418 --> 01:02:39,213
Last time, your creatinine levels were up,
but they've gone down now.

920
01:02:39,297 --> 01:02:41,090
The other levels seem good too.

921
01:02:41,966 --> 01:02:44,093
I'll reduce the dosage
of your prescription.

922
01:02:44,177 --> 01:02:45,011
Thank you.

923
01:02:45,595 --> 01:02:46,554
What a relief.

924
01:02:47,221 --> 01:02:49,932
-That's great, Mom.
-See? I told you not to worry.

925
01:02:50,933 --> 01:02:51,768
Thank you.

926
01:02:51,851 --> 01:02:53,603
Save your thanks for Professor Kang.

927
01:02:54,312 --> 01:02:56,147
Your son's friend asked him a favor,

928
01:02:56,230 --> 01:02:58,775
so he put all the best staff here
on your case.

929
01:02:59,358 --> 01:03:00,443
My friend?

930
01:03:00,526 --> 01:03:02,612
I just need to see him really quick.

931
01:03:02,695 --> 01:03:04,739
I told you he's in surgery right now.

932
01:03:04,822 --> 01:03:06,199
And you need to schedule an--

933
01:03:06,282 --> 01:03:07,825
-I only need a minute…
-Please…

934
01:03:07,909 --> 01:03:08,785
What's going on?

935
01:03:33,226 --> 01:03:35,436
LIM JU-KYUNG SENT YOU A PICTURE

936
01:03:45,446 --> 01:03:46,739
What a goofball.

937
01:03:50,326 --> 01:03:52,245
I should have checked before hitting send.

938
01:03:53,037 --> 01:03:54,664
It's so embarrassing.

939
01:03:55,581 --> 01:03:56,874
I'm so stupid.

940
01:03:56,958 --> 01:03:58,000
MY FRIEND SU-AH

941
01:03:58,084 --> 01:03:59,877
I'm almost there.

942
01:03:59,961 --> 01:04:01,462
I'll save you a seat.

943
01:04:12,306 --> 01:04:13,599
Hi, Lim Ju-kyung.

944
01:04:14,267 --> 01:04:15,852
How have you been?

945
01:04:17,311 --> 01:04:19,522
Of course, we covered this side too.

946
01:04:19,605 --> 01:04:20,648
Did we startle you?

947
01:04:23,609 --> 01:04:24,944
Hey, where are you going?

948
01:04:30,074 --> 01:04:33,202
It was the first time Soo-ho came
to see me after his mom passed away.

949
01:04:33,286 --> 01:04:37,623
He told me it was his friend's mom
and tearily begged me to save her.

950
01:04:46,257 --> 01:04:47,091
What is it?

951
01:04:47,675 --> 01:04:48,509
You.

952
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:50,887
Do you know Professor Kang?

953
01:04:52,221 --> 01:04:53,389
Who told you?

954
01:04:54,765 --> 01:04:55,808
Why did you do it?

955
01:05:01,856 --> 01:05:05,067
Did you think I'd come crying
to thank you if I found out?

956
01:05:05,151 --> 01:05:07,236
Was that what you were expecting
when you pulled this?

957
01:05:08,446 --> 01:05:09,906
Wouldn't you have done the same?

958
01:05:11,157 --> 01:05:13,367
-What?
-If we'd switched places,

959
01:05:14,785 --> 01:05:17,038
wouldn't you have done
the same for my mom?

960
01:05:18,664 --> 01:05:20,082
You were once my friend.

961
01:05:21,208 --> 01:05:22,251
That's why I did it.

962
01:05:23,502 --> 01:05:25,546
If you are so upset about my helping you,

963
01:05:26,714 --> 01:05:27,924
just forget about it.

964
01:05:28,925 --> 01:05:30,176
Problem solved.

965
01:05:32,011 --> 01:05:33,054
Hey, Soo-ho.

966
01:05:35,514 --> 01:05:36,724
What is it, Lim Ju-kyung?

967
01:05:40,394 --> 01:05:41,395
Hey, Seo-jun.

968
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:44,148
You're quick to pick up
your girlfriend's call.

969
01:05:46,734 --> 01:05:49,362
Seo-jun, I'll be waiting for you.
Hurry up.

970
01:05:50,154 --> 01:05:51,447
I miss you.

971
01:05:52,365 --> 01:05:55,534
-Why are you coming out of there?
-Why are you coming out of there?

972
01:05:55,618 --> 01:05:59,664
-Why are you coming out of there?
-Why are you coming out of there?

973
01:05:59,747 --> 01:06:01,624
-I believed in love
-I believed in love

974
01:06:01,707 --> 01:06:03,668
-But I was betrayed…
-But I was betrayed…

975
01:06:06,420 --> 01:06:07,588
What is it?

976
01:06:08,631 --> 01:06:09,799
Damn it.

977
01:06:10,883 --> 01:06:12,051
I said, what is it?

978
01:06:19,767 --> 01:06:22,061
What's up with Limju?
She said she was almost here.

979
01:06:22,895 --> 01:06:24,480
Obviously, she skipped class.

980
01:06:24,563 --> 01:06:26,607
Hey, Ju-kyung's not the type to do that.

981
01:06:26,691 --> 01:06:28,317
The person you are trying to reach…

982
01:06:28,401 --> 01:06:30,569
She's not even picking up.
Did something happen?

983
01:06:30,653 --> 01:06:32,488
-What are you doing?
-What are you doing?

984
01:06:32,571 --> 01:06:37,702
-What the heck are you doing here…
-What the heck are you doing here…

985
01:06:38,452 --> 01:06:40,997
What do you want to do
until your boyfriend comes?

986
01:06:41,664 --> 01:06:42,665
I…

987
01:06:43,165 --> 01:06:45,084
don't have a boyfriend.

988
01:06:45,668 --> 01:06:47,420
I see. You don't have one.

989
01:06:49,547 --> 01:06:50,881
Let's go, come on.

990
01:06:52,925 --> 01:06:56,595
-Why are you coming out of there?
-Why are you coming out of there?

991
01:06:56,679 --> 01:07:00,182
-Why are you coming out of there?
-Why are you coming out of there?

992
01:07:00,266 --> 01:07:02,727
-I couldn't believe my eyes
-I couldn't believe my eyes

993
01:07:02,810 --> 01:07:04,812
-I did a double take
-I did a double take

994
01:07:05,396 --> 01:07:07,815
-It's you, oh my, it's you
-It's you, oh my, it's you

995
01:07:07,898 --> 01:07:11,193
-Why are you coming out of there?
-Why are you coming out of there?

996
01:07:11,277 --> 01:07:15,072
-Why are you coming out of there?
-Why are you coming out of there?

997
01:07:15,156 --> 01:07:17,408
-I believed in love
-I believed in love

998
01:07:17,491 --> 01:07:20,578
-But I was betrayed…
-But I was betrayed…

999
01:07:26,959 --> 01:07:29,295
What is it, Limju?
Are you in a karaoke room?

1000
01:07:29,378 --> 01:07:30,379
What?

1001
01:07:30,963 --> 01:07:32,715
If you're going to karaoke,
you should have--

1002
01:07:32,798 --> 01:07:33,632
Hey.

1003
01:07:34,133 --> 01:07:35,760
I think they're delinquents.

1004
01:07:37,344 --> 01:07:39,472
What? Are they stealing her money?

1005
01:07:40,056 --> 01:07:41,140
Where is this place?

1006
01:07:42,725 --> 01:07:45,311
Wait, I think I've been there before.

1007
01:07:49,732 --> 01:07:52,068
KARAOKE

1008
01:08:25,351 --> 01:08:27,895
Who's this guy?
You're not who we're waiting for.

1009
01:08:27,978 --> 01:08:29,063
Ju-kyung.

1010
01:08:29,855 --> 01:08:30,731
Soo-ho?

1011
01:08:32,691 --> 01:08:34,443
Right, I remember.

1012
01:08:34,527 --> 01:08:37,196
-It's the punk who followed us last time.
-That's right.

1013
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:38,197
Hey, you.

1014
01:08:40,324 --> 01:08:41,659
Hey, what the heck?

1015
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:44,203
Hurry and get him.

1016
01:08:44,286 --> 01:08:45,579
Hey, hold him!

1017
01:08:50,084 --> 01:08:51,585
-Hey!
-It's Han Seo-jun.

1018
01:08:51,669 --> 01:08:53,212
-Seo-jun's here.
-Go get him.

1019
01:08:53,295 --> 01:08:54,713
-Jeez.
-Get him.

1020
01:08:57,133 --> 01:08:58,384
-Hey, get him!
-Grab him.

1021
01:08:58,467 --> 01:09:00,469
Soo-ho, are you crazy?

1022
01:09:07,226 --> 01:09:08,060
You punk.

1023
01:09:09,478 --> 01:09:10,604
-Hey.
-You come here.

1024
01:09:10,688 --> 01:09:12,022
Hey, what the heck?

1025
01:09:12,106 --> 01:09:13,399
This asshole.

1026
01:09:15,151 --> 01:09:15,985
Hey!

1027
01:09:25,953 --> 01:09:26,912
Over here.

1028
01:09:30,416 --> 01:09:31,792
Are you okay?

1029
01:09:35,838 --> 01:09:37,214
Are you okay? You're not hurt?

1030
01:09:41,802 --> 01:09:44,180
-Who are these people?
-Who are these guys?

1031
01:09:46,307 --> 01:09:47,766
AMOR FATI

1032
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:49,268
-Hey!
-Get up!

1033
01:09:49,351 --> 01:09:51,187
-Is he dead?
-Guys, let's go.

1034
01:09:56,275 --> 01:09:57,401
You stupid punk.

1035
01:10:03,782 --> 01:10:05,451
-Take her.
-Come here!

1036
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:07,036
Su-ah!

1037
01:10:10,039 --> 01:10:11,749
Tae-hoon!

1038
01:10:11,832 --> 01:10:12,833
Hey!

1039
01:10:17,171 --> 01:10:18,547
I like to stick to one target.

1040
01:10:18,631 --> 01:10:20,132
Why does it have to be me?

1041
01:11:27,491 --> 01:11:29,326
It feels like my heart is going to burst.

1042
01:11:30,536 --> 01:11:31,704
What do I do?

1043
01:11:31,787 --> 01:11:33,539
That looks painful.

1044
01:11:34,206 --> 01:11:35,291
How did this happen?

1045
01:11:36,041 --> 01:11:37,376
Thank you.

1046
01:11:39,420 --> 01:11:42,381
-Give me your number.
-Number, number!

1047
01:11:42,464 --> 01:11:44,550
I came in case Ju-kyung would come.

1048
01:11:44,633 --> 01:11:45,467
I was worried.

1049
01:11:46,510 --> 01:11:47,553
Where are you going?

1050
01:11:49,388 --> 01:11:51,390
Do you want to go on a date with me?

1051
01:11:53,142 --> 01:11:58,147
