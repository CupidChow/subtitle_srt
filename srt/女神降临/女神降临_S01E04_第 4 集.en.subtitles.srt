JEONG SE-YEON'S DIRTY LAUNDRY

2
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:51,843
WAS NSIX'S JEONG SE-YEON A BULLY?

3
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:55,764
MANY VICTIMS COME FORWARD

4
00:00:56,681 --> 00:00:58,725
MR. A CLAIMS,
"I WAS BULLIED BY SE-YEON FOR THREE YEARS"

5
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:02,562
LEE SOO-HO

6
00:01:05,106 --> 00:01:06,858
The person you are trying to reach is…

7
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:16,034
-Any words to the victims' families?
-Is it true about your contract?

8
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:19,746
-Any words for your disappointed fans?
-Any response to the rumors?

9
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:22,665
-Please say something!
-A comment, please!

10
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:23,833
Where are you going?

11
00:01:26,127 --> 00:01:27,337
To Soo-ho.

12
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,755
What?

13
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:30,757
Soo-ho will believe me.

14
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,883
And if he believes me,

15
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:35,053
Mr. Lee will hear me out.

16
00:01:35,136 --> 00:01:37,931
-Then let me come with you.
-A word for your victims, please!

17
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:41,017
-Mr. Jeong Se-yeon!
-Say something to your fans!

18
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,728
FUNERAL HOME

19
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:54,614
Se-yeon.

20
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:58,618
Se-yeon.

21
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:10,880
THE LATE JEONG SE-YEON

22
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,995
I'm sorry.

23
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:48,042
Hey, Lee Soo-ho.

24
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,212
You got a friend killed.

25
00:02:52,171 --> 00:02:53,506
Yet you seem to be doing well.

26
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:00,680
BASED ON WEBTOON TRUE BEAUTY
BY YAONGYI

27
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:22,493
Excuse me…

28
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:24,329
Is this about your helmet?

29
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:25,413
Not at all.

30
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:27,916
I'm having lunch with you.

31
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:36,257
Han Seo-jun!

32
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:49,437
Seriously, you punk?

33
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:23,054
Punch me.

34
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:25,556
Go ahead, punch me.

35
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,849
Hey!

36
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:30,478
What are you two doing over there?

37
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:34,190
Break it off!

38
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:48,413
Han Seo-jun,

39
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,164
what are you thinking?

40
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:54,294
After all that hassle,
you quit that boy band.

41
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:56,713
Now, are you trying to become a gangster?

42
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:59,924
What kind of student has a fight
on sacred school property?

43
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:01,092
You're right, sir.

44
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:02,635
I was so shocked.

45
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:05,305
They punched each other
in front of my eyes.

46
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:07,307
I almost snorted rice out of my nostrils.

47
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,225
-Go back to your class, you!
-Yes, sir.

48
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:10,935
See you later.

49
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:14,439
What if we have to hold a hearing?

50
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:16,024
Do you want to get expelled?

51
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:17,567
I started it.

52
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,319
Gosh, Soo-ho.

53
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:22,405
Why would you protect him?

54
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,075
You even took time off
to care for your mother,

55
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,869
but what a sight you are now.

56
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,205
How can a mother not get sick

57
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:34,917
when her son acts out like this?

58
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,211
Sir, please stop.

59
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:39,172
My goodness.

60
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:42,884
Since Soo-ho said
he'll kindly forgive him,

61
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:44,260
let's wrap things up here.

62
00:05:44,343 --> 00:05:48,097
We don't need to raise a ruckus
about school violence, now do we?

63
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:56,272
Soo-ho, you have a Math Olympiad
the day after tomorrow.

64
00:05:56,355 --> 00:05:58,107
You should take care of yourself.

65
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,068
Go ahead. You may leave.

66
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:13,456
What's this?

67
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:16,209
Why are you glaring like that?

68
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:18,461
-This punk--
-Please sir, stop.

69
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:21,214
Aren't you going to say you're sorry?

70
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,719
Are you all right?

71
00:06:27,386 --> 00:06:28,471
You're hurt.

72
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:34,060
Why didn't you get beaten up
and get your arm broken?

73
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:36,562
Then I'd win the Math Olympiad, right?

74
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:38,856
Leave if you're here to ramble.

75
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:43,027
You should have thrown him
to the ground while you were at it.

76
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:46,030
That way, he won't try anything
with you ever again.

77
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:47,990
You really learned jiu-jitsu for nothing.

78
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:51,285
You haven't changed a bit.
You're still a giant pushover.

79
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,622
Seriously, what happened between you two?

80
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:56,916
Is it because of Jeong Se-yeon?

81
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:00,878
Hey,

82
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:02,463
put this on.

83
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:10,680
They say the two towers fought over her.

84
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:12,140
Is it a love triangle?

85
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:13,057
This is huge.

86
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:16,102
-What happened?
-So what was it about?

87
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:18,271
Seriously, what's happening?

88
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:21,482
Ju-kyung, I heard both Lee Soo-ho
and Han Seo-jun like you.

89
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:24,110
Who are you going to pick between the two?

90
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:29,323
There's nothing to choose.

91
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:37,790
Will it be Savior Soo-ho
or Seo-jun Almighty?

92
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:40,293
Who will you pick?

93
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:41,294
-Who's your pick?
-Who's your pick?

94
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:44,172
Hey, why don't you just pick ATEEN
on the music programs?

95
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:45,506
Are you a fan too?

96
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:46,841
It's not like that.

97
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:49,218
There's no way
the two towers would like me.

98
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:51,095
I hear they don't get along. That's why.

99
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:53,014
-No way!
-No!

100
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:54,307
-It can't be.
-No way.

101
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:57,435
By the way,

102
00:07:57,518 --> 00:08:02,648
why did Mr. H sit next to Ms. L?

103
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:04,525
-That's what I like to know--
-Hey.

104
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:07,862
-You need to stop it.
-Let's leave it at that.

105
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:09,447
-Hey!
-That was perfect reasoning.

106
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:11,449
If Ju-kyung says no, then that's it.

107
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:12,492
Go back to your classes.

108
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:14,160
-Return to your seats.
-Agreed!

109
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:15,244
But why?

110
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:16,704
You guys all leave too!

111
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:18,706
-Su-ah says so.
-Hey.

112
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:20,458
-Go.
-What class do we have next?

113
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:23,127
All this trouble
because you're too pretty.

114
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:27,715
If it was an average girl instead of you,
there would be no such rumors.

115
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:29,217
Goodness. It must be tiring.

116
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:33,387
Seriously, what was all that?

117
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:38,100
In this sense, maybe I did have it easy
when I went unnoticed.

118
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:40,102
-Hey, Soo-ho's back.
-Soo-ho is here.

119
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:42,688
-What happened, Soo-ho?
-What's going on?

120
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:51,572
Hey, Soo-ho!

121
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,035
Come see me outside.

122
00:08:58,204 --> 00:08:59,205
Hey, Soo-ho.

123
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:03,000
Who are you
to start something with Seo-jun?

124
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:04,669
What an elegant jerk.

125
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:06,837
-Arrogant.
-Arrogant.

126
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:08,214
-He's right.
-Is it arrogant?

127
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:09,799
Anyway.

128
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:12,760
What will you do
if Seo-jun gets suspended because of you?

129
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:15,263
You grabbed him first,
so wasn't that first defense?

130
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:17,515
-Self-defense.
-He's right.

131
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:18,432
He's correct.

132
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:20,184
Are you pretending to be a gangster?

133
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,187
Where do you think you're going?

134
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:27,692
You're crossing the line.

135
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:33,489
-He's crossing the line.
-Don't hold him back.

136
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:38,828
-What should we do?
-Do you work out?

137
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:40,705
Jump in you guys!

138
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:42,748
-Got it.
-Come on, jump in.

139
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:44,959
Seriously?

140
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:48,713
That's enough.

141
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:55,886
Am I a pig up for the roast?

142
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:00,224
You little punks!

143
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:02,768
Are you acting up again?

144
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:04,770
-It's not what it seems.
-Sorry, sir.

145
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:05,855
Silence!

146
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:08,024
Kim Cho-rong, that meddling idiot.

147
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:13,195
You little punks, hanging out together
and always up to no good!

148
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:16,866
-We were just exercising…
-Exercising? Look at your body!

149
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:19,660
-Gosh.
-Hey.

150
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:21,579
Pass the ball.

151
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:25,166
Hey, Soo-ho.

152
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,668
I was worried you might die by my punch,

153
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:29,170
so I went easy on you. Got it?

154
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:32,840
-I seriously…
-I don't think he can hear you.

155
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:35,134
I'll go and relay the message.

156
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:37,094
-Hey, Soo-ho!
-Hey, Man-sik!

157
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:42,308
My neck is cramping!

158
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:44,477
-My neck is cramping!
-Hurry up, come on.

159
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,896
-Take him to the nurse.
-Call 911.

160
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:49,857
Hello?

161
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:52,652
Seo-jun.

162
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:57,823
What do you want from me?

163
00:10:58,449 --> 00:10:59,325
What do I want?

164
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:02,328
Stay out of my sight.

165
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:05,373
You stay away if you don't want to see me.

166
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:07,958
I have no reason to run from you.

167
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:10,252
You're so shameless.

168
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:12,963
I see.

169
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:15,049
That's your true nature.

170
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,719
That night…

171
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:23,682
when Se-yeon came to see me…

172
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:27,686
What now?

173
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:35,236
Making excuses after all these years?

174
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:38,739
Do you have any idea…

175
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:41,659
what his final words to me were?

176
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:44,245
"Soo-ho…

177
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:46,580
will believe me."

178
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,502
He didn't know
how cold and selfish you really are.

179
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:56,715
He had faith in you, so he ran to you.

180
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:01,554
So don't you ever…

181
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:04,515
mention Se-yeon's name again.

182
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:45,848
Bring Se-yeon back.

183
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:49,185
Bring him back!

184
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:53,272
Bring back Se-yeon, you bastard!

185
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:22,301
PRINCE COMICS

186
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:32,770
RESERVED FOR LIM JU-KYUNG.
SIT HERE AND YOU'LL GROW BUTT HAIR.

187
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:49,662
Are you crying?

188
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:50,829
CURSED MASK

189
00:13:57,127 --> 00:14:00,005
Did the book scare you that much?

190
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:04,051
It's okay. Don't cry.

191
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,554
This isn't scary at…

192
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:08,305
Squirrel.

193
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:10,349
I'm a squirrel.

194
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:13,185
Seriously, you're not going to…

195
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:18,148
Meow.

196
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:21,402
You finally smiled.

197
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:24,363
Squirrel. I'm a squirrel.

198
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:26,615
Did you know?

199
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:29,618
You'll grow butt hair
if you cry and then smile!

200
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:34,498
Squirrel. I'm a squirrel.

201
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:37,751
Soo-ho.

202
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:42,756
I was passing by and saw you were in here.

203
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:46,427
Here, drink this.

204
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:51,265
I saw Seo-jun leave school earlier.

205
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:53,434
Did you clean the gym all by yourself?

206
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:56,395
And you just let him go?

207
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:58,898
Why did you get into a fistfight
like a bunch of kids?

208
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:02,318
Never mind.

209
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,945
I wrestled with my brother
only a few days ago.

210
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:05,905
I'm one to talk.

211
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:08,324
I fight daily too.

212
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:14,997
By the way, when my brother and I fight,

213
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,458
my mom makes us do this one thing
to patch things up.

214
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:21,045
"I love you."

215
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:23,797
We say that repeatedly,

216
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:25,591
and then clip,

217
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:26,967
clip.

218
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:30,930
-We have to trim each other's toenails.
-Toenails?

219
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,390
When we trim each other's toenails,

220
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:36,101
it tickles and stuff,
which naturally eases the mood.

221
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:43,692
Did you just smile?

222
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:47,279
This is my first time seeing you smile.

223
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:49,323
No, I didn't smile.

224
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:54,620
I'm not sure what happened before,

225
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:58,290
but if you feel like talking to someone,
let me know.

226
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:00,292
I can be the secret wall you can talk to.

227
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:05,798
Anything for the Savior Soo-ho.

228
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:07,925
What? "Savior Soo-ho"?

229
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:11,011
They call you the savior of Saebom High.

230
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:14,431
-You didn't know? Savior Soo-ho?
-I'm hardly a savior.

231
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:17,267
Don't call me that.

232
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:20,354
Why not? You are Savior Soo-ho to me too.

233
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:23,691
You're my savior
for keeping my true face a secret.

234
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:38,038
Does it bother you that much?

235
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:40,249
What does?

236
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:42,584
Your face without makeup.

237
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:46,714
Don't all girls look different
with makeup on?

238
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:49,717
You can't ever say that somewhere else.

239
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,970
I look especially different,
like total opposites.

240
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:56,557
Beats me. I can't tell.

241
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:02,646
Are your eyes working?
How can you not tell?

242
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:05,691
I tried so hard to study
and practice makeup.

243
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:07,818
I can even turn this face around.

244
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:13,699
You got your lips hurt?

245
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:16,994
That looks painful.

246
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:30,549
You two shouldn't read adult comics, okay?

247
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:36,638
You should hurry home now.

248
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,974
Do you know what time it is?
Hurry up and go home.

249
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,225
It's not even eight.

250
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:41,769
So hurry home to study.

251
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:44,104
What sort of student visits
a comics shop at this hour?

252
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:45,731
You must have bad grades.
What's your rank?

253
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:46,774
You're wrong!

254
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:49,610
Who comes after King Sejong?
You have three seconds.

255
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:51,403
-One, two, three.
-King Gojong?

256
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:52,863
You've skipped 400 years.

257
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:54,782
You really don't know much, do you?

258
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:56,617
-Hurry up and leave.
-Wait.

259
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,743
Go home and study!

260
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:06,752
What was I even saying?

261
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:19,473
Goodness.

262
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:20,933
Seriously, that's dangerous.

263
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:28,649
Hey, Ju-kyung.

264
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:30,442
Me? What is it?

265
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:31,610
Are you seeing Soo-ho?

266
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:33,362
No, I'm not.

267
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:36,698
-You're not?
-No, never…

268
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:38,700
No, I'm not.

269
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:41,161
I can see that.

270
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:42,287
Right.

271
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:45,624
He can see that? See what?

272
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:50,003
-What is that?
-Hey, look!

273
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:53,215
-Does she have a bloody nose?
-There's blood on her nose.

274
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:57,010
What is this?

275
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:01,140
Lee Soo-ho

276
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:03,559
I got soul, say ho

277
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,894
Why don't you say hey-ho

278
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:15,863
He never gives a high-five
no matter how hard Tae-hoon tries.

279
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,667
This classroom is just like my acne.

280
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:31,920
You never know when it'll blow up.

281
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:48,312
What's taking him so long
to call me for a meal?

282
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:50,147
Is he shy or something?

283
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,028
I'll give him one more day.

284
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:58,405
We have a constant function seven.

285
00:19:58,488 --> 00:20:01,033
If the input x becomes six,
what's the limit here?

286
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:03,410
It's obviously seven,

287
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:06,538
as the constant function's value
will stay at seven.

288
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:10,959
Okay, who wants to come up
and solve the next one?

289
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:15,923
I'm at fault for asking.

290
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:19,635
The math genius couple, Soo-ho and Su-jin.

291
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:21,094
Solve questions one and two.

292
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:22,596
And…

293
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:26,892
The transfer, Lim Ju-kyung,
you try question three.

294
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:27,809
Come on up.

295
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:02,970
Of course not. No way.

296
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:10,936
Hey, Soo-ho.

297
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:12,854
Help me out.

298
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:15,232
Just the formula, please?

299
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:17,234
Savior Soo-ho.

300
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:32,082
As expected.

301
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:35,168
You'll take first place again
this year for sure.

302
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:37,838
The principal has high hopes for you.

303
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:39,339
Do well, okay?

304
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:42,134
Feel the pressure and do your best!

305
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:46,638
It changes the whole mood
of the teachers' meeting. Got it?

306
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:55,022
Right now is the limit of my despair.

307
00:21:58,483 --> 00:21:59,568
Ju-kyung.

308
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:02,362
What's the use of peeking
at a different question?

309
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:05,240
Right.

310
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:12,497
Seo-jun must know how to solve this.

311
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,709
Take Ju-kyung's place.
You come out and solve it.

312
00:22:17,085 --> 00:22:18,628
That's not going to work. Come up.

313
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:30,766
Come on.

314
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:37,564
No college would take me
if I gave up on math, right?

315
00:22:37,647 --> 00:22:39,649
You could make up for it
with other subjects.

316
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:41,860
I don't think I'll be able
to go to college.

317
00:22:41,943 --> 00:22:43,361
Do you want to come to our math academy?

318
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:45,989
All the smart kids,
including Su-jin and Soo-ho, go there.

319
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:47,324
-Should I?
-Yes.

320
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:49,201
My mom asked me to find one anyway.

321
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:51,328
Come join us.
We have a study group afterward,

322
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:52,621
and you can join that too.

323
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:53,830
That'd be great for me.

324
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:56,416
Hey, Soo-ho.
Do you want to join our study group?

325
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,085
We have one last spot open.

326
00:22:58,710 --> 00:22:59,711
No.

327
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:02,589
I need you to join so my mom
will agree to it without nagging.

328
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:04,091
Just tell her I'm in the group.

329
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:07,219
You want me to lie? Just join us.

330
00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:11,306
He's playing hard to get.

331
00:23:12,015 --> 00:23:14,935
I knew he'd be like this.
It's just the three of us and Tae-hoon.

332
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:18,146
All right. We'll study together
as soon as Ju-kyung starts.

333
00:23:18,855 --> 00:23:21,733
I'm kicking you out
if you skip a session for a date.

334
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:22,984
All right.

335
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:27,364
Right, Limju, I gave the guy your number.

336
00:23:27,447 --> 00:23:29,199
-Already?
-Yes.

337
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:30,826
He'll contact you soon.

338
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:32,577
Look. He's super dreamy, right?

339
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:36,623
It's his personality that matters.
Decide things after meeting him.

340
00:23:36,706 --> 00:23:39,042
I don't think I'm ready yet.

341
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:42,921
I'm being dogged by rumors as is.
Should I just meet him?

342
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:44,714
That's a great idea.

343
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:47,008
He's already into you
after seeing your pictures.

344
00:23:56,726 --> 00:23:58,520
Hey, what…

345
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:00,981
Why are you…

346
00:24:01,064 --> 00:24:02,149
Going to Prince Comics.

347
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:05,694
You read quite a lot of comics.

348
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:08,780
How do you still manage to be
at the top of the class?

349
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:15,370
-Good luck with your exam tomorrow.
-I don't like sweets.

350
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:17,914
I see.

351
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:23,753
About that Olympiad tomorrow,

352
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:26,006
the whole country's math geniuses
will be there, right?

353
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:28,633
What do they test you on?
Is it like the nationwide exam?

354
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:31,261
Do they ask about sets?
Like a union or an intersection?

355
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:33,054
That's all you know about math, isn't it?

356
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,349
Come on.

357
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:38,268
We learned about sets in sophomore year.

358
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:39,853
What's the equation of a circle?

359
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:42,981
Math's my weak spot.

360
00:24:43,064 --> 00:24:44,357
Who comes after King Sejong?

361
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:48,153
Hey, if you suddenly
throw a curve ball like that,

362
00:24:48,236 --> 00:24:50,447
it makes it hard
to recall the right answer.

363
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:52,866
-You don't know, do you?
-No.

364
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:56,369
JI WU-HYUN:
HI, IT'S JI WU-HYUN HERE

365
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:57,621
The blind date guy texted me.

366
00:24:58,955 --> 00:25:01,416
Hi, it's Ji Wu-hyun here.
When would you like to meet?

367
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:04,085
You should be studying,
not going on blind dates.

368
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:07,172
I'm learning the ways of life.

369
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:08,423
HI, I'M LIM JU-KYUNG

370
00:25:08,506 --> 00:25:09,549
And who knows?

371
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:12,928
If this went well, my boyfriend
in a prestigious college would tutor me.

372
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:15,513
I'll get both a boyfriend and good grades.

373
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:17,390
Shall we meet tomorrow?
When's good for you?

374
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:18,308
Tomorrow?

375
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:21,519
Do people usually go on dates
in the evening?

376
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:23,480
During daytime. When it's very bright out.

377
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:25,065
I see.

378
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:27,442
I like the daytime.

379
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:32,280
-You're liking this too much.
-No, I'm not.

380
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:35,575
This is all because you
and Seo-jun fought in front of me.

381
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:37,869
It's because of those rumors.

382
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:40,997
If you don't like it,
you don't have to go, do you?

383
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,794
It's not that. I'm just nervous.

384
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:48,255
Actually,

385
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:51,925
this is my first time meeting a guy alone.

386
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:54,678
Aren't you meeting me alone right now?

387
00:26:05,188 --> 00:26:08,900
Hey, how can you just grab my face
like it's a rolling pumpkin?

388
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:11,236
I'm a person with eyes,
a nose, and a mouth.

389
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:13,655
THEN LET'S WATCH A MOVIE

390
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:16,116
I've been really wanting
to see this movie.

391
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:35,051
You said you were going to Prince Comics.

392
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:36,845
What's up with him?

393
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:38,930
Good luck with your exam tomorrow!

394
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:55,405
Mom!

395
00:26:55,488 --> 00:26:58,074
-Seo-jun!
-How was your checkup?

396
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:01,119
Why are you here? You should
have just gone home after school.

397
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:03,872
By the way, you didn't get here
on a motorcycle, right?

398
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:05,332
I said I wouldn't.

399
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:09,127
Mom, what brought on your endless worries?

400
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:11,463
What did the doctor say?

401
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:15,800
No signs of transplant rejection yet.
The numbers are good too.

402
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:18,845
I was just told to take my medicine
and take good care of myself.

403
00:27:18,928 --> 00:27:19,846
That's a relief.

404
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:22,599
Why don't we eat out today?
I can call up Go-un.

405
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:24,976
Maybe next time.
I need to stop by somewhere today.

406
00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:26,853
Where?

407
00:27:26,936 --> 00:27:29,731
Why did you put these out
when the place is cluttered as is?

408
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:32,609
These are the scented candles I made.

409
00:27:32,692 --> 00:27:34,527
Can you hand these out to your regulars?

410
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:36,988
If they're well-received,
I want to try selling them.

411
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:39,949
Please don't try to do anything.

412
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:43,661
Goodness, I do love aromatherapy.

413
00:27:44,245 --> 00:27:45,830
I even only get aromatic massages.

414
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:48,333
What scents do you have, Mr. Lim?

415
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:51,669
This is a ylang-ylang-scented candle.

416
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:55,173
It's known to relieve high blood pressure
and control estrogen effectively.

417
00:27:55,256 --> 00:27:57,175
-Ylang-ylang is especially…
-Leave already.

418
00:27:57,258 --> 00:27:58,718
Leaving already. Okay.

419
00:27:59,552 --> 00:28:01,012
He's so handsome.

420
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:03,515
You must be happy just seeing his face.

421
00:28:04,307 --> 00:28:05,809
Why do you keep criticizing him?

422
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:08,561
If it weren't for his face,
I would have left him already.

423
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:12,232
My goodness.

424
00:28:12,315 --> 00:28:14,484
Now you're back to the Ju-kyung I know.

425
00:28:14,567 --> 00:28:16,653
I had no idea when you had your makeup on.

426
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,363
Are you a magician?

427
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:21,866
It's the Ju-kyung magic.

428
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:25,829
I washed my face.
Do a facial for me, hurry.

429
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:26,788
I already said no.

430
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:28,206
Can't you see that I'm busy?

431
00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:30,583
-Go home and study.
-It doesn't take that long!

432
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:31,709
Hey, Hyun-sook.

433
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:36,256
Oh my, Mi-hyang!

434
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:40,176
What's he doing here?

435
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:42,178
I don't have makeup on.

436
00:28:46,015 --> 00:28:46,891
This is my son.

437
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:48,935
Hello.

438
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:52,063
My goodness…

439
00:28:52,605 --> 00:28:53,815
gracious.

440
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:56,818
What made you turn out this handsome?

441
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:00,989
There's my second child.

442
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:17,422
Have you gone mad?

443
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:18,423
What are you doing?

444
00:29:18,506 --> 00:29:20,008
Get off the floor, Lim Ju-kyung!

445
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:21,760
Lim Ju-kyung?

446
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:31,811
You look better now
than when you were getting dialysis.

447
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:34,647
I met a good doctor,
and the surgery went well.

448
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:35,607
I was lucky.

449
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:37,859
That's so great.

450
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:41,529
-Have you been well?
-Of course, I've been well.

451
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:44,949
This is crazy.

452
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:50,205
Mom,

453
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:51,915
I'm going home.

454
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:55,376
You'll scare the whole town at this hour.
Go wash your face.

455
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:04,761
I have to reapply my makeup at this hour.

456
00:30:55,728 --> 00:30:58,314
You are so pretty, Ju-kyung.
I bet you're very popular.

457
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:03,486
You two must be close
since you are in the same class.

458
00:31:06,072 --> 00:31:08,199
No, not really.

459
00:31:09,617 --> 00:31:11,953
Well, they can get to know
each other better now.

460
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:14,831
You two are what they call
"model children."

461
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:19,711
Now that we've met,
why don't you come over tomorrow?

462
00:31:19,794 --> 00:31:21,504
I'll make a nice dinner for you.

463
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:24,048
Mom, I have a study group tomorrow.

464
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:26,718
I heard she's going on a blind date.

465
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:29,679
You're too young to go on a blind date!

466
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:33,141
That's why you nagged me
to give you a facial.

467
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:36,477
What's wrong with that?
They're at a good age to try out dating.

468
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:39,439
It would be nice for Seo-jun
to get a girlfriend,

469
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:41,232
but all he does is ride his motorcycle.

470
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:44,402
He hasn't lately though.

471
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:46,696
He rides it every day.

472
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:48,072
-He totally--
-Hey!

473
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:52,744
He totally drives too fast.
I almost got hit once.

474
00:31:52,827 --> 00:31:55,288
Is that right? You promised you wouldn't.

475
00:31:55,371 --> 00:31:58,541
I mean, I already own it.
And I'm saving on bus fare.

476
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:00,460
He acts tough all the time,

477
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:02,587
but he's just like Ju-young with his mom.

478
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:04,464
You're not to be trusted, Han Seo-jun.

479
00:32:04,547 --> 00:32:06,799
Ju-kyung, please do me a favor.

480
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:10,511
Make sure he doesn't ride his motorcycle.

481
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:13,890
Let me know if you ever
see him riding it, okay?

482
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:16,643
Mom, why would you ask such a thing?

483
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:18,561
Trying to break your promise again?

484
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:23,691
-You'll do that for me, won't you?
-Of course.

485
00:32:24,525 --> 00:32:25,902
You can count on me.

486
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:32,408
BEAUTY SALON

487
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:35,078
I can't come here
without makeup from now on.

488
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:37,080
I almost got caught.

489
00:32:38,706 --> 00:32:39,540
Hey, you!

490
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:44,963
You'll pay for it
if you say a word to my mom.

491
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:46,130
About…

492
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:47,465
about what?

493
00:32:47,548 --> 00:32:48,549
Your motorcycle?

494
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:53,763
-Well, I made a promise to her so--
-And?

495
00:32:55,598 --> 00:32:57,809
And? What else is there?

496
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:02,188
-How you were getting beaten up by--
-What?

497
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:05,024
If that's not it…

498
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:09,112
what else did you do wrong?

499
00:33:11,614 --> 00:33:13,866
How you almost got into trouble
for hitting Soo-ho?

500
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:20,999
I won't.

501
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:24,293
I'm good at keeping secrets.

502
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:33,803
What a troublemaker.

503
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:41,144
This is still funny to look at.

504
00:33:51,612 --> 00:33:53,031
When you're on a blind date,

505
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:56,534
it's hard to check yourself in the mirror
with a guy in front of you.

506
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:59,203
Some might think,

507
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:01,539
"Should I try on a shade
I don't normally use?"

508
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:04,459
"I should try something unique,"

509
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:07,420
before going on a blind date.

510
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:10,548
Hey, you over there!

511
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:12,550
Don't use that shade!

512
00:34:12,633 --> 00:34:14,177
Please keep your hands away.

513
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:17,221
Hey Seluvies, please remember…

514
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:19,140
I tried on a new eyeshadow.

515
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:21,225
If you try out a new shade or a new style,

516
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:24,395
it might look awkward,
and things can even turn out wrong.

517
00:34:25,104 --> 00:34:27,398
Please stick to
your normal makeup routine.

518
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:30,777
The key points here are
to focus on the details

519
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:34,322
and heighten your loveliness.

520
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:53,841
I heard so many good things
about you, Wu-hyun.

521
00:34:55,301 --> 00:34:57,678
Wu-hyun? Maybe that's too much.

522
00:34:59,138 --> 00:35:00,014
Mr. Ji?

523
00:35:01,557 --> 00:35:02,809
That doesn't sound right.

524
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:04,602
How do I address him?

525
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:52,567
Everything looks the same.

526
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:58,531
Wait, isn't this what Mom ordered for her?

527
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:02,785
I'll get you, you little punk.

528
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:13,421
It even still has the tag.

529
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:21,721
MATH OLYMPIAD

530
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:24,432
What? He's really good-looking.

531
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,601
He's so dreamy!

532
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:28,394
-Really handsome.
-Hey, Soo-ho.

533
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:30,438
Are you prepared?

534
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:32,356
What's there to prepare?

535
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,274
How obnoxious.

536
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:35,860
Don't pretend you haven't studied
when you're going to ace it.

537
00:36:37,236 --> 00:36:39,280
Don't you get tired of
repeating that line?

538
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:43,868
My family's always curious about
your results as much as mine.

539
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:46,078
I'm here. Good luck.

540
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:47,246
Good luck to you too.

541
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:48,164
Hey, wait.

542
00:36:48,956 --> 00:36:51,584
Don't do better than me.
Just do a decent job, okay?

543
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:14,899
I'm over by the windows.

544
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:30,373
Hello.

545
00:37:30,456 --> 00:37:31,582
Nice to meet you.

546
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:33,542
-Please take a seat.
-Thanks.

547
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:38,172
You look prettier in person.
I almost didn't recognize you.

548
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:40,132
I doubt that.

549
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:41,300
I'm serious.

550
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:44,345
Can I drop the honorifics?

551
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:45,638
Of course, please.

552
00:37:45,721 --> 00:37:48,057
What would you like?
This place has nice bubble tea.

553
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:49,475
Yes, I like it.

554
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:52,770
You caught me off guard.
Are you being forward?

555
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:55,523
I meant…

556
00:37:56,023 --> 00:37:58,359
I like bubble tea.

557
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:00,194
I'm kidding.

558
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:20,256
Welcome.

559
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:22,466
-One popcorn and two cokes, please.
-Okay.

560
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:25,052
I'll get these. You paid for the tickets.

561
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:27,763
It's our first date, so I'll get it.

562
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:30,349
That way, I get to ask you out again.

563
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:31,767
Again?

564
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:33,936
Does he want to meet again?

565
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,479
Here's your popcorn.

566
00:38:36,522 --> 00:38:37,815
So sweaty.

567
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,730
That was quick.

568
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:20,483
Maybe you don't have any customers?

569
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:29,033
It's not your fault.

570
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:45,925
That dirty bastard.

571
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:57,895
-What the heck?
-Sir, get out of the way.

572
00:39:57,978 --> 00:40:00,398
Sir, you're blocking the screen.

573
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:01,649
Who the heck are you?

574
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:03,901
Do you know him?

575
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:07,196
No. How could I possibly
know a guy like this?

576
00:40:07,696 --> 00:40:08,531
I'm sorry.

577
00:40:12,326 --> 00:40:15,913
Gosh, I don't have time for this. Ha-ru!

578
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:17,790
Eun Dan-oh.

579
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:19,542
Eun Dan-oh!

580
00:40:28,467 --> 00:40:29,760
What are you doing?

581
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:31,804
Get off me!

582
00:40:32,721 --> 00:40:34,640
Who the heck are you?

583
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:39,979
I'd like to walk you home,

584
00:40:40,062 --> 00:40:42,064
but I have a meeting back on campus.

585
00:40:42,648 --> 00:40:43,482
Sorry.

586
00:40:44,191 --> 00:40:45,943
It's all right. You should get going.

587
00:40:46,026 --> 00:40:46,986
Thanks.

588
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:50,698
-You'll go out with me again, right?
-What?

589
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:55,453
Sure.

590
00:40:56,495 --> 00:40:57,830
Was I being too forward?

591
00:40:58,789 --> 00:40:59,790
I'll text you later.

592
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:02,042
Get home safe.

593
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:06,213
I will.

594
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:08,174
Goodbye.

595
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,856
This is so lame.

596
00:41:25,065 --> 00:41:26,484
What am I doing?

597
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:30,237
Hey, babe. Where are you?

598
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:32,490
I'm already here.

599
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:35,701
Ta-da! Hey, babe.

600
00:41:35,784 --> 00:41:38,078
-When did you get here?
-Were you waiting long?

601
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:40,414
I wanted to see you faster,
so I got here early.

602
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,082
Let's go.

603
00:41:45,961 --> 00:41:46,837
MY FRIEND SU-AH

604
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:48,172
How was it? Is he handsome?

605
00:41:48,255 --> 00:41:50,633
What did you eat?
What's he like? Seeing him again?

606
00:41:50,716 --> 00:41:51,675
So many questions.

607
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:53,177
He asked me on a second date.

608
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:55,888
Is this going somewhere?

609
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:01,393
Did you get home? I miss you already.

610
00:42:07,149 --> 00:42:08,901
Gosh, he texted me. What do I say?

611
00:42:08,984 --> 00:42:11,070
-How should I answer?
-Hey, calm down.

612
00:42:11,153 --> 00:42:13,989
Don't answer right away.
Answer after a long while.

613
00:42:14,073 --> 00:42:16,700
How could I?
Being left on read might offend him.

614
00:42:16,784 --> 00:42:19,537
Don't even look at your phone.
Play hard to get.

615
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:21,330
"Play hard to get"?

616
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:24,041
This doesn't hurt and feels good?

617
00:42:24,124 --> 00:42:25,042
Yes.

618
00:42:26,585 --> 00:42:27,795
Does it feel good?

619
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:29,296
Yes. It feels great.

620
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:31,674
You're still not calling me?

621
00:42:31,757 --> 00:42:33,801
Should I just storm into his school?

622
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:36,053
-I'm home!
-You're back.

623
00:42:36,136 --> 00:42:37,972
That looks yummy!

624
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:41,267
Where have you been, all dolled up?

625
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:42,643
Hey, that dress.

626
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:44,478
This is…

627
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:47,565
Is that new? It's pretty!

628
00:42:49,275 --> 00:42:50,109
Thanks.

629
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:53,070
Are you coming from your blind date?

630
00:42:53,153 --> 00:42:55,656
You naughty girl, already going on dates.

631
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:56,699
A date?

632
00:42:56,782 --> 00:42:59,493
Mom, Su-ah said,

633
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:02,079
"You can postpone studying,
but never falling in love."

634
00:43:02,162 --> 00:43:04,582
That's the most ridiculous thing
I've ever heard.

635
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:06,125
If you study hard and go to college,

636
00:43:06,208 --> 00:43:09,587
I would hook you up
with a nice guy like Seo-jun.

637
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:11,630
-Seo-jun?
-He's a total delinquent.

638
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:14,300
A delinquent?
Ju-kyung, don't meet a guy like that.

639
00:43:14,383 --> 00:43:17,886
What are you talking about?
He's such a good boy.

640
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:21,056
When his mom was on the mend
after her kidney transplant,

641
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:23,100
he took care of her for months.

642
00:43:23,183 --> 00:43:25,561
He worked part-time jobs
to cover his own tuition.

643
00:43:25,644 --> 00:43:28,647
-He even helped with the hospital bills.
-Really?

644
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:31,567
He'd be perfect
if he didn't ride that motorcycle of his.

645
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:34,069
Mi-hyang seemed awfully worried.

646
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:38,490
Her husband actually passed away
in a traffic accident.

647
00:43:41,577 --> 00:43:43,579
Don't mention this to Seo-jun.

648
00:43:43,662 --> 00:43:45,080
-Really?
-Yes.

649
00:43:45,748 --> 00:43:48,083
If he's such a good boy,
why won't he listen to his mom?

650
00:43:54,089 --> 00:43:56,008
-Hello?
-Congratulations!

651
00:43:56,091 --> 00:43:58,886
-Darn it. This isn't the call I wanted.
-You can take out a loan…

652
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:02,139
You voice-phishing scammers,
I'll take out your lives instead!

653
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:05,351
It's infuriating.

654
00:44:05,434 --> 00:44:06,560
Hey, give me that.

655
00:44:07,353 --> 00:44:08,354
Jeez.

656
00:44:18,238 --> 00:44:19,823
I'm losing more and more.

657
00:44:21,742 --> 00:44:22,826
Mona Lisa,

658
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:25,537
I share your pain.

659
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:37,132
If we get another spark,

660
00:44:38,258 --> 00:44:39,301
we'll start dating, okay?

661
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:45,974
LIM HEE-KYUNG

662
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:46,892
Right,

663
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:49,687
she asked me to treat her to dinner.

664
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:11,875
It feels refreshing.

665
00:45:14,837 --> 00:45:16,547
Hey, you got something good going on?

666
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:18,173
Did someone ask you out?

667
00:45:19,091 --> 00:45:20,926
-Actually…
-Yes?

668
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:24,430
I went on a blind date.

669
00:45:25,931 --> 00:45:27,933
I think it went well.

670
00:45:28,016 --> 00:45:30,686
Look at you,
all grown up and going on a date.

671
00:45:30,769 --> 00:45:32,813
All thanks to my makeup skills.

672
00:45:33,689 --> 00:45:34,606
-Hee-kyung.
-Yes?

673
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:36,984
When should I reply
if I'm playing hard to get?

674
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:39,194
Su-ah said to answer after a long while.

675
00:45:39,278 --> 00:45:40,612
It's been 30 minutes now.

676
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:43,907
I don't play games.
I like it straightforward.

677
00:45:44,491 --> 00:45:46,076
Don't keep him waiting. Text him back.

678
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,494
-Right?
-Right.

679
00:45:51,248 --> 00:45:52,958
Forget what I said about missing you.

680
00:45:53,041 --> 00:45:55,210
I actually have a girlfriend.

681
00:45:55,294 --> 00:45:57,546
I'm a bastard for trying to cheat
on her with you.

682
00:45:57,629 --> 00:45:58,630
I sincerely apologize.

683
00:45:58,714 --> 00:45:59,548
What's he saying?

684
00:46:00,757 --> 00:46:03,010
You got dumped. But who does it like this?

685
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:03,927
I…

686
00:46:05,345 --> 00:46:06,263
I got dumped?

687
00:46:06,346 --> 00:46:07,181
I mean,

688
00:46:07,681 --> 00:46:10,559
if he doesn't like you,
he could leave it as "not meant to be."

689
00:46:10,642 --> 00:46:11,643
Not meant to be…

690
00:46:11,727 --> 00:46:13,187
He's a total jerk.

691
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:14,313
I see.

692
00:46:15,397 --> 00:46:17,232
I got dumped.

693
00:46:18,192 --> 00:46:19,401
Of course, I did.

694
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:22,404
How could I get a guy with this face?

695
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:25,699
It's hard to find the one on a blind date.

696
00:46:25,782 --> 00:46:27,326
Forget about it, okay?

697
00:46:31,038 --> 00:46:32,623
There you are.

698
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:36,668
"Hello, you told me to buy you a meal,

699
00:46:36,752 --> 00:46:40,964
but I didn't want to impose on you
and take your valuable time."

700
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:43,217
"I'll wire you a sum for compensation."

701
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:45,302
"Kindly let me know
your bank account info."

702
00:46:45,385 --> 00:46:46,386
What account info?

703
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:47,679
You got dumped.

704
00:46:49,598 --> 00:46:50,557
Dumped?

705
00:46:51,934 --> 00:46:53,060
He dumped me?

706
00:46:55,771 --> 00:46:57,940
No guy has ever treated me this way.

707
00:46:58,857 --> 00:47:00,943
You can still get dumped
with that pretty face?

708
00:47:03,028 --> 00:47:06,365
How much prettier do I have to be, then?

709
00:47:06,448 --> 00:47:07,449
Come on, you two.

710
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:09,493
Why are you fussing
when I'm trying to poop?

711
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,286
Get out!

712
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:19,920
So embarrassing.
How do I tell Su-ah that I got dumped?

713
00:47:23,924 --> 00:47:25,050
Caught in the act.

714
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:31,807
-What do you think you're doing?
-Your mom did ask me to report to her.

715
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:33,392
This is ridiculous.

716
00:47:33,475 --> 00:47:35,769
You should listen to your mother.

717
00:47:35,852 --> 00:47:37,020
Are you my mom's Mafia?

718
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:39,982
"Mafia"? More like her spy.

719
00:47:40,065 --> 00:47:41,275
Same difference!

720
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:42,985
They're both bad guys, aren't they?

721
00:47:47,322 --> 00:47:50,325
You're not the only person with leverage.
I have something too.

722
00:47:53,078 --> 00:47:54,663
Delete it when I ask nicely.

723
00:47:54,746 --> 00:47:56,540
Hey, Han Seo-jun!

724
00:47:56,623 --> 00:47:59,376
-Seo-jun, delete it.
-You delete it first.

725
00:47:59,459 --> 00:48:00,627
I said, delete it!

726
00:48:06,258 --> 00:48:08,260
I've just wasted so much energy.

727
00:48:12,931 --> 00:48:14,600
Trying to face-stamp my jacket again?

728
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:21,231
Don't get off track.

729
00:48:22,024 --> 00:48:22,899
What?

730
00:48:24,443 --> 00:48:25,902
Watch where you're going.

731
00:48:25,986 --> 00:48:28,238
-You should study instead--
-There you go again.

732
00:48:28,322 --> 00:48:29,364
I memorized them all.

733
00:48:29,448 --> 00:48:31,867
Tae, Jeong, Tae, Se, Mun, Dan, Se
Ye, Seong, Yeon, Chung, In, Myeong, Seon

734
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:33,869
Kwang, In, Hyo, Hyeon, Su, Gyeong, Yeong
Jeong, Sun, Heon, Cheol, Go, Sun

735
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:41,793
Let's see.

736
00:48:45,964 --> 00:48:47,758
-Babe.
-Yes?

737
00:48:48,717 --> 00:48:50,385
Aren't you going to edit my face?

738
00:48:50,469 --> 00:48:52,387
Don't stand so close when we take selfies.

739
00:48:52,471 --> 00:48:54,264
It makes it obvious I edited the photo.

740
00:48:56,141 --> 00:48:58,060
It's as if I'm dating two different girls.

741
00:48:58,894 --> 00:49:01,271
The Su-ah in front of me
and the Su-ah on Newstagram.

742
00:49:03,398 --> 00:49:06,652
Then why don't you break up with me
and date her over DM?

743
00:49:06,735 --> 00:49:08,028
That's not what I meant.

744
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:11,281
How could I break up with you
when you're this cute?

745
00:49:16,703 --> 00:49:18,330
Ju-kyung, our girl in love.

746
00:49:18,413 --> 00:49:20,832
It's not like that.

747
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:22,501
Why? You said you'd see him again.

748
00:49:22,584 --> 00:49:23,794
I thought it went well.

749
00:49:25,087 --> 00:49:29,132
-Well, I got a message after we texted.
-Okay.

750
00:49:30,258 --> 00:49:31,259
It turns out…

751
00:49:32,678 --> 00:49:34,388
he's a weird guy.

752
00:49:34,471 --> 00:49:36,348
Why? What did he say? Let me see.

753
00:49:39,518 --> 00:49:40,352
Here.

754
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:46,483
"Forget what I said about missing you.
I actually have a girlfriend."

755
00:49:46,566 --> 00:49:48,819
"I'm a bastard for trying to cheat
on her with you."

756
00:49:49,403 --> 00:49:50,654
"I sincerely apologize."

757
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:53,323
-What's with him?
-Did you get dumped?

758
00:49:54,616 --> 00:49:56,576
-Already?
-How do you get dumped right away?

759
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:58,620
-That was faster than a 5G connection.
-Seriously?

760
00:49:58,704 --> 00:49:59,871
Love isn't easy.

761
00:50:00,914 --> 00:50:02,624
-The heart changes fast.
-It does.

762
00:50:04,543 --> 00:50:05,627
The high schooler?

763
00:50:06,169 --> 00:50:07,003
Well…

764
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:08,880
Her body isn't impressive,

765
00:50:09,548 --> 00:50:10,966
but her face isn't so bad.

766
00:50:11,758 --> 00:50:13,760
And she's kind of naive,

767
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:15,762
so it'll be easy to get her.

768
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:19,433
She's good for a short fling.

769
00:50:20,892 --> 00:50:22,102
Who the heck are you?

770
00:50:22,769 --> 00:50:24,771
-Hold on.
-Take that back.

771
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:26,815
I take it back.

772
00:50:26,898 --> 00:50:28,775
Whatever I said,

773
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:30,110
I take it back, all right?

774
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:31,069
So let me go.

775
00:50:31,653 --> 00:50:32,696
PARK SUNG-NYUNG

776
00:50:33,613 --> 00:50:34,740
THIRD AUNT
DID YOU GET HOME? I MISS YOU ALREADY.

777
00:50:34,823 --> 00:50:36,283
Who do you think you are?

778
00:50:36,366 --> 00:50:37,200
Wait.

779
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:40,704
It hurts.
My arms get habitually dislocated.

780
00:50:40,787 --> 00:50:41,913
Bastard.

781
00:50:47,252 --> 00:50:48,378
Ta-da!

782
00:50:50,422 --> 00:50:51,465
It's amazing.

783
00:50:57,637 --> 00:51:00,098
What's that?
Is he showing them my picture?

784
00:51:01,808 --> 00:51:04,102
-It looks like nose hair.
-Is it really nose hair?

785
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:05,228
-Enlarge it!
-No, wait.

786
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:06,938
-Is it?
-Look right here.

787
00:51:14,112 --> 00:51:15,280
What did I say?

788
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:17,491
-Send this to the group chat.
-Hey!

789
00:51:18,617 --> 00:51:20,786
-Come on.
-What is she doing?

790
00:51:20,869 --> 00:51:22,329
-Hey, Ju-kyung!
-That hurts!

791
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:24,623
Hey, stop!

792
00:51:24,706 --> 00:51:25,791
Ju-kyung!

793
00:51:25,874 --> 00:51:28,001
Bring it back when I say it nicely.
Come here!

794
00:51:28,084 --> 00:51:29,836
I saw it all. Come on. Bring it here!

795
00:51:33,131 --> 00:51:35,091
-Hand it over.
-What do you mean?

796
00:51:36,468 --> 00:51:37,677
I saw everything, okay?

797
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:41,765
Why are you jumping in?

798
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:43,391
What are you doing?

799
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:53,735
You're starting up a fight again, right?

800
00:51:58,824 --> 00:52:00,200
Please don't, okay?

801
00:52:00,283 --> 00:52:02,285
Here, here's your key.
I'll give this back.

802
00:52:02,369 --> 00:52:04,037
Let's part ways. You, go this way.

803
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:07,374
And you, that way. Let's go.
I'm going this way.

804
00:52:16,216 --> 00:52:18,552
Our teacher is really good,
so listen carefully.

805
00:52:18,635 --> 00:52:21,263
Will I be able to not give up on math?

806
00:52:21,346 --> 00:52:23,974
Hey, you can do it too.

807
00:52:24,057 --> 00:52:25,058
Don't give up.

808
00:52:25,141 --> 00:52:26,226
You and me.

809
00:52:27,102 --> 00:52:28,186
All right.

810
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:29,145
Hey, Kangsu.

811
00:52:29,229 --> 00:52:32,232
Can I bring my friend
from Shinhwa Boys' High School?

812
00:52:32,941 --> 00:52:34,651
Shinhwa Boys' High School?

813
00:52:34,734 --> 00:52:35,986
What kind of friend is he?

814
00:52:36,069 --> 00:52:38,989
I have so many questions
I would like to ask.

815
00:52:39,072 --> 00:52:40,490
Why bring a guy we don't know?

816
00:52:40,574 --> 00:52:42,659
You know why. So Ju-kyung can get a guy.

817
00:52:42,742 --> 00:52:45,787
Dating is a must
Marriage is an option

818
00:52:45,871 --> 00:52:47,247
Amor Fati

819
00:52:59,634 --> 00:53:01,511
What? You said you wouldn't join us.

820
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:03,930
I said I didn't want to.
I never said I wouldn't.

821
00:53:06,308 --> 00:53:09,185
Our study group has
the top two students in our school.

822
00:53:10,145 --> 00:53:11,855
We're like the Avengers, right?

823
00:53:23,575 --> 00:53:25,452
How can you not know this basic concept?

824
00:53:27,203 --> 00:53:29,331
I don't know the basics.

825
00:53:33,668 --> 00:53:35,253
When limit n approaches infinity,

826
00:53:35,337 --> 00:53:37,547
n over n squared is reduced,
becoming one over n.

827
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:40,050
The limit is zero. In contrast,

828
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:43,553
n squared over n will be reduced to n.

829
00:53:43,637 --> 00:53:46,056
As such, it will diverge to infinity.

830
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:54,981
What?

831
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:58,234
How does your tiny head
solve such difficult questions?

832
00:53:58,944 --> 00:54:00,779
What's your IQ? Is it over 150?

833
00:54:00,862 --> 00:54:02,697
How can you not focus even for a moment?

834
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:05,075
You have a two-digit IQ, right?

835
00:54:05,158 --> 00:54:07,243
-FYI, dolphins have an IQ of 80.
-They're that smart?

836
00:54:07,327 --> 00:54:08,745
Work harder if you want to beat them.

837
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:13,041
Focus.

838
00:54:17,253 --> 00:54:18,338
So what's the answer?

839
00:54:36,231 --> 00:54:37,399
Lucky her.

840
00:54:39,192 --> 00:54:42,278
By the way, when did you get
so close with Soo-ho?

841
00:54:42,362 --> 00:54:44,781
He's not the type to tutor anyone.

842
00:54:45,448 --> 00:54:46,616
This is being close?

843
00:54:48,159 --> 00:54:48,994
By his standards.

844
00:54:49,577 --> 00:54:50,412
Well…

845
00:54:53,498 --> 00:54:54,958
I'm not really sure.

846
00:54:55,917 --> 00:54:58,837
Maybe he's helping me out
because I'm so hopeless at math.

847
00:55:01,214 --> 00:55:02,799
What a show-off.

848
00:55:07,429 --> 00:55:09,973
Guys, to mark our first study session…

849
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:13,184
-Want to go to coin karaoke?
-Yes!

850
00:55:14,227 --> 00:55:15,311
You had it all planned, right?

851
00:55:17,856 --> 00:55:19,441
You're not coming, are you, Soo-ho?

852
00:55:20,859 --> 00:55:22,402
I can go for a little bit.

853
00:55:25,405 --> 00:55:28,700
-Real, you're so real
-Real, you're so real

854
00:55:28,783 --> 00:55:31,786
-You're the real deal
-You're the real deal

855
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:34,789
-The real deal has arrived
-The real deal has arrived

856
00:55:34,873 --> 00:55:35,790
-Right now
-Right now

857
00:55:38,251 --> 00:55:41,254
-Real, you're so real
-Real, you're so real

858
00:55:41,337 --> 00:55:44,174
-You're the real deal
-You're the real deal

859
00:55:44,799 --> 00:55:48,386
-I'm really going to love you
-I'm really going to love you

860
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:50,972
-Cheer up, baby
-Cheer up, baby

861
00:55:51,056 --> 00:55:53,058
-You can do it
-You can do it

862
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:56,644
-A girl can't give her heart too easily
-A girl can't give her heart too easily

863
00:55:56,728 --> 00:55:58,480
-Then you'll like me more
-Then you'll like me more

864
00:55:58,563 --> 00:56:01,649
No, I'm okay
Don't feel pressured

865
00:56:01,733 --> 00:56:05,320
I don't have a boyfriend anyways

866
00:56:05,403 --> 00:56:08,406
-But why don't you say anything
-Say anything

867
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:11,367
-When I look at you
-When I look at you

868
00:56:11,451 --> 00:56:15,246
-When I look at you again
-When I look at you again

869
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:18,708
-I'm so cold I shiver, naengmyeon
-I'm so cold I shiver, naengmyeon

870
00:56:18,792 --> 00:56:22,629
-So chewy, naengmyeon
-So chewy, naengmyeon

871
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:24,589
-But I still love you
-But I still love you

872
00:56:24,672 --> 00:56:28,051
-Nice!
-Hey, fire, fire, my lady

873
00:56:28,134 --> 00:56:31,721
Hey, hey, warning, warning, no, no

874
00:56:31,805 --> 00:56:33,723
Hey, hey, fire…

875
00:56:39,395 --> 00:56:40,855
Sometimes

876
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:44,734
I live and forget

877
00:56:45,485 --> 00:56:47,445
Pretending I'm fine

878
00:56:48,113 --> 00:56:51,616
I even meet with people…

879
00:56:52,492 --> 00:56:53,743
He sings really well.

880
00:56:54,285 --> 00:56:56,121
He could totally be a singer.

881
00:56:58,248 --> 00:57:00,667
I think I've heard this song before.

882
00:57:02,418 --> 00:57:03,711
Where have I heard this?

883
00:57:09,050 --> 00:57:12,137
How are you doing?

884
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:17,892
I guess I'm not doing well

885
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:24,107
I must have been away too long.

886
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:25,942
I see a lot of new faces.

887
00:57:26,025 --> 00:57:28,862
-You look more handsome in person.
-You look amazing.

888
00:57:28,945 --> 00:57:30,822
To learn the new staff members' faces,

889
00:57:30,905 --> 00:57:32,115
we'll need a staff dinner.

890
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:34,451
Please have a seat.

891
00:57:34,534 --> 00:57:36,661
-Shall we start the meeting?
-Yes.

892
00:57:36,744 --> 00:57:39,581
THE LATE JEONG SE-YEON TRIBUTE PROJECT

893
00:57:39,664 --> 00:57:42,500
As the first anniversary
of Jeong Se-yeon's passing approaches,

894
00:57:42,584 --> 00:57:45,128
I propose a tribute album.
Considering the circumstances,

895
00:57:45,211 --> 00:57:48,423
I think consoling the fans and the members
with a tribute album

896
00:57:48,506 --> 00:57:54,262
takes priority over a grand comeback
of NSIX without Se-yeon.

897
00:57:55,138 --> 00:57:58,641
I found this song
from the files Se-yeon left behind.

898
00:57:58,725 --> 00:58:00,393
Se-yeon wrote the lyrics,

899
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:03,104
and someone called Leo composed it.

900
00:58:04,022 --> 00:58:05,148
I love the song.

901
00:58:06,441 --> 00:58:07,734
Leo, was it?

902
00:58:08,276 --> 00:58:09,235
Yes.

903
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:12,614
We don't know who it is yet,
so we are on the lookout for Leo.

904
00:58:13,198 --> 00:58:14,157
I see.

905
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:26,169
Isn't that Seo-jun's motorcycle?

906
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:30,173
Is he nearby?

907
00:58:34,802 --> 00:58:35,637
It is his.

908
00:58:36,304 --> 00:58:39,307
He's been riding the motorcycle again.

909
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:40,892
Seriously, why ride a motorcycle?

910
00:58:41,976 --> 00:58:43,019
Seo-jun,

911
00:58:43,102 --> 00:58:46,022
I'm going to break this motorcycle.

912
00:58:46,731 --> 00:58:47,649
What are you doing?

913
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:52,237
I'm not doing anything.

914
00:58:53,488 --> 00:58:54,531
Did you do something?

915
00:58:54,614 --> 00:58:55,865
I didn't even touch it.

916
00:58:56,908 --> 00:58:57,825
Come on.

917
00:59:02,664 --> 00:59:05,458
-Come over here for a moment.
-What is it?

918
00:59:11,339 --> 00:59:12,340
What was that for?

919
00:59:12,966 --> 00:59:15,885
Why don't we talk here?

920
00:59:17,303 --> 00:59:18,429
It has to be in secret?

921
00:59:18,513 --> 00:59:19,639
Yes.

922
00:59:20,723 --> 00:59:22,934
Hey, Han Seo-jun!

923
00:59:26,229 --> 00:59:29,440
-Why are you coming from there?
-What do you mean, why?

924
00:59:30,275 --> 00:59:31,651
You crazy punk.

925
00:59:33,736 --> 00:59:34,904
Hey.

926
00:59:34,988 --> 00:59:36,781
Why did he have to show up here?

927
00:59:38,074 --> 00:59:39,033
Who's this?

928
00:59:39,117 --> 00:59:41,452
Why did you bring a girl
to this back alley?

929
00:59:42,453 --> 00:59:43,621
You should take off.

930
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:46,291
What do I do?

931
00:59:50,712 --> 00:59:52,130
Get them.

932
00:59:52,213 --> 00:59:53,965
-Get them!
-Come on!

933
00:59:54,048 --> 00:59:56,759
-Stop!
-Hurry up!

934
01:00:05,643 --> 01:00:07,645
-I said stop!
-Stop right there!

935
01:00:25,079 --> 01:00:26,122
Hurry up.

936
01:00:26,205 --> 01:00:27,248
Are you serious?

937
01:00:30,168 --> 01:00:31,336
-Stop!
-Hey.

938
01:00:31,419 --> 01:00:32,837
I said stop!

939
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:35,006
-How far are they going?
-They're getting away.

940
01:00:47,518 --> 01:00:48,353
Quickly!

941
01:00:49,437 --> 01:00:51,356
-Where did they go?
-Must be over there.

942
01:00:59,447 --> 01:01:01,240
-What's this?
-What the…

943
01:01:07,163 --> 01:01:07,997
Who's this?

944
01:01:08,623 --> 01:01:09,957
This guy is from Saebom High.

945
01:01:24,555 --> 01:01:25,515
They left.

946
01:01:25,598 --> 01:01:26,641
They're gone.

947
01:01:28,101 --> 01:01:30,645
Why would you drag me here
when I told you to take off?

948
01:01:30,728 --> 01:01:32,730
What would they think?

949
01:01:35,566 --> 01:01:36,734
What would they think?

950
01:01:36,818 --> 01:01:39,612
Wouldn't it look suspicious
if I took off like that?

951
01:01:40,613 --> 01:01:42,323
Gosh, you're so dumb.

952
01:01:43,116 --> 01:01:45,201
I just saved you. And what? I'm dumb?

953
01:01:45,284 --> 01:01:47,537
Do you know who comes after King Sejong?

954
01:01:47,620 --> 01:01:50,331
-King Gojong.
-You've skipped 400 years.

955
01:01:50,415 --> 01:01:52,041
-Look who's dumber.
-What?

956
01:01:53,668 --> 01:01:56,045
Who are you? Why did you follow us?

957
01:01:59,215 --> 01:02:01,676
-Where do you think you're going?
-You a friend of Seo-jun's?

958
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:04,220
Or his sidekick?

959
01:02:06,013 --> 01:02:06,848
Get out of my way.

960
01:02:07,432 --> 01:02:10,017
I'll let you go if you bring Seo-jun here.

961
01:02:11,936 --> 01:02:12,770
Why would I?

962
01:02:12,854 --> 01:02:14,272
If a friend gave him a call,

963
01:02:14,355 --> 01:02:16,274
he'd come, wouldn't he?

964
01:02:16,357 --> 01:02:17,608
He wouldn't take my call.

965
01:02:17,692 --> 01:02:18,860
Then let's find out.

966
01:02:19,652 --> 01:02:20,695
Take his phone.

967
01:02:21,362 --> 01:02:23,156
All right, excuse us.

968
01:02:24,824 --> 01:02:26,075
It's right here.

969
01:02:28,244 --> 01:02:29,370
You dare stop me?

970
01:02:30,496 --> 01:02:31,622
Let go.

971
01:02:33,958 --> 01:02:34,959
Seriously?

972
01:02:36,794 --> 01:02:38,755
-What are you doing?
-Get up.

973
01:02:38,838 --> 01:02:39,797
Where are you going?

974
01:02:39,881 --> 01:02:41,466
-Let go.
-Bring him here.

975
01:02:42,884 --> 01:02:43,760
This punk!

976
01:02:46,804 --> 01:02:49,766
-Hold him.
-I got him.

977
01:02:49,849 --> 01:02:51,768
-You go ahead.
-Shoot.

978
01:02:51,851 --> 01:02:52,977
-I'm sorry.
-You guys…

979
01:02:53,060 --> 01:02:53,978
Go high, I'll go low.

980
01:02:54,061 --> 01:02:55,354
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

981
01:02:59,150 --> 01:03:00,777
Let go!

982
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:05,239
Get him.

983
01:03:07,283 --> 01:03:08,743
Hold him tight.

984
01:03:08,826 --> 01:03:10,328
Grab him. Hold still.

985
01:03:14,749 --> 01:03:16,334
How dare you mess with my crew?

986
01:03:18,252 --> 01:03:20,171
-What are you doing over there?
-Shoot.

987
01:03:20,254 --> 01:03:21,798
-Let's take off.
-Let's go.

988
01:03:37,146 --> 01:03:38,272
What?

989
01:03:38,356 --> 01:03:39,982
Can you lend me some money?

990
01:03:40,066 --> 01:03:41,442
Why would I?

991
01:03:41,526 --> 01:03:44,529
My friends went looking for me
and went home with my bag.

992
01:03:44,612 --> 01:03:46,614
My phone and wallet were both in the bag.

993
01:03:47,698 --> 01:03:48,950
Serves you right.

994
01:03:49,575 --> 01:03:51,953
I did save you,
so consider this as payback.

995
01:03:52,036 --> 01:03:54,497
Just lend me my bus fare. That's it.

996
01:03:54,580 --> 01:03:56,207
What payback?

997
01:03:56,290 --> 01:03:57,625
I won't. You can walk home.

998
01:04:00,044 --> 01:04:01,337
You're heartless.

999
01:04:10,847 --> 01:04:11,681
Hey.

1000
01:04:14,225 --> 01:04:16,561
-Get on before I change my mind.
-Really?

1001
01:04:17,687 --> 01:04:18,688
Thank you!

1002
01:04:23,734 --> 01:04:24,944
How do I get on?

1003
01:04:27,071 --> 01:04:28,322
Like this?

1004
01:04:29,198 --> 01:04:30,199
Here we go.

1005
01:04:45,923 --> 01:04:49,844
PRINCE COMICS

1006
01:05:05,610 --> 01:05:06,861
Thank you.

1007
01:05:08,195 --> 01:05:10,197
If you're so thankful, erase the picture.

1008
01:05:12,867 --> 01:05:13,701
Ju-kyung.

1009
01:05:20,207 --> 01:05:24,045
I went through all that to keep you apart.
Were you a couple in your past life?

1010
01:05:25,379 --> 01:05:26,255
Soo-ho, you again?

1011
01:05:26,339 --> 01:05:27,924
Why are you bringing her home?

1012
01:05:28,007 --> 01:05:30,217
Look who's talking.
Why were you waiting for her?

1013
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:36,557
Okay, guys.

1014
01:05:36,641 --> 01:05:38,559
Why don't we all head home?

1015
01:05:38,643 --> 01:05:40,603
It's late. You head that way.

1016
01:05:40,686 --> 01:05:42,730
And you go that way. Go in opposite--

1017
01:05:46,317 --> 01:05:47,151
Hee-kyung!

1018
01:05:49,654 --> 01:05:50,821
What's this?

1019
01:05:52,031 --> 01:05:54,867
Why do we have two beautiful guys here?

1020
01:05:58,955 --> 01:06:00,081
Did I die?

1021
01:06:00,748 --> 01:06:02,083
Am I in heaven?

1022
01:06:04,335 --> 01:06:05,503
Hee-kyung.

1023
01:06:06,045 --> 01:06:06,879
Hee-kyung.

1024
01:06:10,549 --> 01:06:12,093
Come with me.

1025
01:06:12,176 --> 01:06:15,763
-I'll help you make it big!
-Hee-kyung.

1026
01:06:18,432 --> 01:06:19,684
This is crazy.

1027
01:06:19,767 --> 01:06:22,687
Come on. Wake up, okay?

1028
01:06:24,271 --> 01:06:25,731
I'll kill you if you get sick.

1029
01:06:26,857 --> 01:06:28,317
-Let's take her home.
-Hey.

1030
01:06:28,401 --> 01:06:30,152
Why should I?

1031
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:31,988
Why should I…

1032
01:06:32,697 --> 01:06:33,531
Jeez.

1033
01:06:33,614 --> 01:06:36,075
Seriously, Hee-kyung,
when you wake up, I'm going to…

1034
01:06:36,158 --> 01:06:38,119
Let's go.

1035
01:06:38,202 --> 01:06:40,413
Cover her mouth.

1036
01:06:46,794 --> 01:06:48,295
We're here. This is it.

1037
01:06:49,171 --> 01:06:52,008
Thank you so much.
I'll be forever grateful to…

1038
01:06:52,758 --> 01:06:53,676
No!

1039
01:07:19,452 --> 01:07:21,871
I'm so sorry.
I will get it cleaned for you.

1040
01:07:21,954 --> 01:07:24,081
No. I'll burn it and get you a new one.

1041
01:07:24,165 --> 01:07:26,125
I'm really sorry. Good night.

1042
01:07:41,932 --> 01:07:43,100
Hey, Soo-ho.

1043
01:07:51,275 --> 01:07:52,818
Do you like Lim Ju-kyung?

1044
01:07:54,904 --> 01:07:57,031
-What?
-Don't you like her?

1045
01:08:00,951 --> 01:08:01,994
Then what about you?

1046
01:08:02,787 --> 01:08:04,413
Why do you keep hanging around her?

1047
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:08,918
Do you like Lim Ju-kyung?

1048
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:15,382
Should I give it a try?

1049
01:08:56,674 --> 01:08:57,633
EXAMINATION SLIP

1050
01:09:12,022 --> 01:09:14,233
What is it? Where are you going?

1051
01:09:32,168 --> 01:09:33,419
Do you like Lim Ju-kyung?

1052
01:10:11,790 --> 01:10:12,791
Here, take it.

1053
01:10:14,793 --> 01:10:15,669
What?

1054
01:10:15,753 --> 01:10:17,004
You told me not to ride it.

1055
01:10:18,631 --> 01:10:19,715
Are they dating?

1056
01:10:21,884 --> 01:10:23,093
Starting today,

1057
01:10:23,844 --> 01:10:25,054
I'll only listen to you.

1058
01:10:30,142 --> 01:10:32,019
What was that? Was that a confession?

1059
01:10:32,102 --> 01:10:34,146
Does Seo-jun like Ju-kyung?

1060
01:10:34,730 --> 01:10:35,856
That's huge.

1061
01:10:36,857 --> 01:10:38,442
Hey, Seo-jun!

1062
01:10:38,525 --> 01:10:39,401
Don't go.

1063
01:10:43,197 --> 01:10:45,115
-Just a--
-I said, don't go.

1064
01:11:12,268 --> 01:11:14,603
THANK YOU TO KIM HYE-YOON AND LEE JAE-WOOK
FOR THEIR SPECIAL APPEARANCE

1065
01:11:40,212 --> 01:11:41,547
You can sit here if you want.

1066
01:11:41,630 --> 01:11:43,507
You're wearing a goddess mask.

1067
01:11:43,590 --> 01:11:44,758
Bring the pork cutlets.

1068
01:11:44,842 --> 01:11:46,468
Lee Soo-ho and Han Seo-jun?

1069
01:11:46,552 --> 01:11:48,637
-Seriously, watch your mouth.
-What?

1070
01:11:48,721 --> 01:11:51,849
-He only listens to her!
-He only listens to her!

1071
01:11:54,226 --> 01:11:56,145
Don't run away because you're scared.

1072
01:11:56,228 --> 01:11:57,855
What? Hey.

1073
01:11:58,397 --> 01:12:00,482
It's all because of me,
and it's all my fault.

1074
01:12:00,566 --> 01:12:03,152
But don't play Lim Ju-kyung.

1075
01:12:03,861 --> 01:12:05,154
My gosh.

1076
01:12:07,781 --> 01:12:12,786
