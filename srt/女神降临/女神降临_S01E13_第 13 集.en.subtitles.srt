1
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:36,411
Her?

2
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:39,831
Goddess, my foot.

3
00:00:46,254 --> 00:00:47,505
You be the goddess instead.

4
00:00:52,093 --> 00:00:53,720
WELCOME TO THE NEW STUDENT ORIENTATION
FOR SAEBOM HIGH SCHOOL

5
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:56,723
-Hey, it's Ju-kyung!
-She's here.

6
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:02,437
She doesn't look like the photos at all.

7
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,355
-How is that her?
-Does that look like her?

8
00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:07,442
Ju-kyung, is this really you?

9
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:08,943
BASED ON WEBTOON TRUE BEAUTY
BY YAONGYI

10
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:12,655
The truth about Lim Ju-kyung,
Saebom High Goddess.

11
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:15,158
She was known for running dumpling errands
before her transfer.

12
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:16,910
You are all going to be so shocked.

13
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:18,953
She's super ugly. It's all her makeup.

14
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:25,460
-Gosh.
-That's not her.

15
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:28,421
-This is over the line.
-This is wild.

16
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,110
She's a fraud.

17
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:52,237
Shouldn't she see a dermatologist?

18
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:01,496
Ju-kyung.

19
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,506
Ju-kyung.

20
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:17,846
Ju-kyung.

21
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:29,107
Hey, Ju-kyung.

22
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:32,610
You, a goddess?

23
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:34,362
It's ridiculous.

24
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:35,780
Take her.

25
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,493
Let me go!

26
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:42,328
Let me go!

27
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:47,375
Let go!

28
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:49,836
Hey,

29
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:52,046
weren't you dating Han Seo-jun?

30
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,465
-And now Lee Soo-ho?
-She was two-timing.

31
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:56,217
-You played them both.
-She's nuts.

32
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:58,469
How did you get Lee Soo-ho with this face?

33
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:00,555
How can that face turn into this?

34
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:02,765
-Does he know how you actually look?
-She was two-timing.

35
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:06,185
A breakup is inevitable if he didn't.
But if he knew and was dating you…

36
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:07,520
Then what's wrong with him?

37
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,857
Goddess? You've got to be kidding me.

38
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:12,400
Grab her.

39
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:15,778
-What are you doing?
-Don't resist.

40
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:18,156
Why? I just want to
take a look at your bare face.

41
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,867
-Don't!
-Why? We're having fun.

42
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,493
-Stop!
-Grab her.

43
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:24,662
Seriously?

44
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,708
She's that girl?

45
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:30,793
-Don't do this!
-Don't struggle, okay?

46
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,420
Her skin looks different already.

47
00:03:32,503 --> 00:03:33,504
My goodness.

48
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:35,340
-Don't do this!
-"Don't do this!"

49
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:37,008
The post was totally true.

50
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:38,968
-It's crazy.
-Look at her skin.

51
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:42,430
Don't you touch her.

52
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,108
Ju-kyung!

53
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,780
Ju-kyung! Get out of my way!

54
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:00,323
Ju-kyung!

55
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:02,242
Ju-kyung!

56
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:07,538
Where are you going?

57
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:09,958
Are you crying?

58
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,046
Hey, Ju-kyung!

59
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:23,680
-Have you seen Ju-kyung?
-Did you two fight again?

60
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:25,056
Have you seen her?

61
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:26,599
She went that way.

62
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:32,105
Whatever, they can fight all they want.

63
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:33,022
Hey, Seo-jun!

64
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:35,149
Hey, Seo-jun! It's crazy about Ju-kyung.

65
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:38,611
Don't talk to me about her from now on.
I don't want to know about it.

66
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:40,446
But take a look at this.

67
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:41,364
Come on.

68
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:35,001
BOYFRIEND

69
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:38,254
The fact that he's dating you
makes him look lame as well.

70
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:40,006
BOYFRIEND

71
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:41,466
4 MISSED CALLS
BOYFRIEND

72
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:56,856
Did you watch the video?

73
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:59,442
Of course, I saw it. I almost fell for it.

74
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:01,360
Ju-kyung, a goddess? Ridiculous.

75
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:02,737
That's what I'm saying.

76
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,364
-She's ugly for real.
-That's what I'm saying.

77
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:07,909
-What? Say that again.
-What?

78
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:09,202
What did you just say?

79
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:11,079
-What?
-You bastard!

80
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:12,747
What the hell?

81
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:16,584
-Hey!
-What's your problem?

82
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:18,628
-Shouldn't we call the teacher?
-Hey, what's with you?

83
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:19,629
Don't touch me!

84
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:23,424
Say it again, you bastard!

85
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:25,343
-What did you just say?
-Hey!

86
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:28,262
Hey, Ju-young! Stop it!

87
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:32,350
Calm down.

88
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:39,816
Take a seat.

89
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:48,032
Calm down. Don't get worked up.

90
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:54,330
Okay, great job.

91
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:58,501
I'm also upset about
what happened to Ju-kyung,

92
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:01,087
but don't you ever use violence
under any circumstances.

93
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,757
There's a saying,
"Don't hit someone even with flowers."

94
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:08,302
There's nothing you can't resolve
with words. Got it?

95
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:11,848
Give me your hand.

96
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:16,811
Are you a dog?

97
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:19,063
Here.

98
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:20,940
I saw your hand got scraped.

99
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:33,119
Hey, she's unrecognizable, right?

100
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:34,871
Gosh, I was really shocked.

101
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:36,372
-She's ruined now.
-Maybe it's edited.

102
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:37,915
Got something interesting?

103
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:39,292
-Good morning.
-Morning, sir.

104
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,043
-It's this way.
-I know.

105
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:42,587
Let's have the morning assembly.

106
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:51,721
I don't see Ju-kyung and Soo-ho.

107
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,851
They must be on a date or something.

108
00:07:58,102 --> 00:07:59,437
Excuse me, sir.

109
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,898
Ju-kyung probably won't come
to school today.

110
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:04,317
Is she feeling unwell?

111
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,944
Is it because of me?

112
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:08,029
Hee-kyung!

113
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:09,697
Hi.

114
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:10,656
Mr. Han?

115
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,201
-We're dating.
-Why did it have to be my teacher?

116
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:15,328
How can I go to school knowing this?

117
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:19,874
Sir, by the way,
Seo-jun didn't come either.

118
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:21,542
-Seo-jun as well?
-Yes.

119
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:31,177
It's Han Seo-jun! What's he doing here?

120
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,303
He's handsome!

121
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:34,514
-Who is that?
-I don't know, but he's handsome.

122
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:35,473
From Saebom High?

123
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:42,772
Seo-jun! Han Seo-jun!

124
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:44,315
Did you ask for me? Why?

125
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:46,234
I told you you'd pay
if you messed around again.

126
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:48,736
How will you make me pay for it?

127
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:50,738
Take it down when I tell you nicely.

128
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:51,656
Take what down?

129
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:53,616
The video you showed me yesterday!

130
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:56,577
You submitted it to our anonymous forum.

131
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:58,079
What? Anonymous forum?

132
00:08:58,746 --> 00:08:59,956
What are you saying?

133
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:03,668
That got posted on your anonymous forum?

134
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:06,003
What? That's huge.

135
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:07,922
You're here because of that?

136
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:09,882
Too bad. I didn't do it.

137
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:12,051
-It's not you?
-It's not me!

138
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:13,594
Dumpling doesn't even go here anymore.

139
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:16,180
Why would I bother submitting it
to your school's forum?

140
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:20,101
No one would do such a thing
other than you.

141
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,688
You're wrong.

142
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:28,526
How do you think I figured out
Dumpling is Lim Ju-kyung?

143
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:35,950
Will I…

144
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,495
be able to get married?

145
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:02,310
A savior card?

146
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:04,353
Sir, did Ju-kyung drop by here?

147
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:06,731
No.

148
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,665
Goodness, dear Soo-ho is here!

149
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,334
Good morning. Is--

150
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:29,503
Why do you look so thin?

151
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:31,505
-How's your leg?
-Yes, if Ju-kyung…

152
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:32,715
Mr. Lee…

153
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:35,301
I mean, how's your father?

154
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:37,011
He's just…

155
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:41,223
-I shouldn't have said anything.
-Well, if Ju-kyung…

156
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:43,351
What? Ju-kyung?

157
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:46,896
Nothing, I'll get going.

158
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:50,316
-Goodbye.
-Don't skip your meals!

159
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,818
Watch out for cars!
Don't get into an accident again.

160
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:57,740
Wait, shouldn't he be in class?

161
00:10:58,324 --> 00:10:59,700
What was he doing here?

162
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:04,955
Lim Ju-kyung.

163
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:11,921
That brat.
She probably bought more makeup.

164
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:14,382

This brat…

168
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:34,443
Su-ah, you really didn't know?

169
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,070
You're best friends with Ju-kyung.

170
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,656
What best friends?

171
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:39,907
-Jeez.
-Come on.

172
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:41,951
So she modeled pretending to be a goddess?

173
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:44,245
-Right?
-How did she get Soo-ho, though?

174
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:46,580
-I wouldn't date her.
-He couldn't have known about this.

175
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:47,498
Want to bet?

176
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:48,624
Watch your words.

177
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,046
What?

178
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:58,384
Come with me.

179
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:00,594
Why?

180
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:02,138
Do you want to talk here?

181
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:04,390
Class is starting soon.

182
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:09,895
I said, come with me.

183
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:15,234
-What is it?
-Stop him.

184
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:18,154
-Get the class president.
-Shouldn't we stop him?

185
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:19,905
Let go.

186
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:23,617
Were you this trashy?

187
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:28,456
-Delete the video.
-I won't.

188
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:29,707
You won't?

189
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:34,420
It's none of your business.

190
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:37,131
What do you think Soo-ho
will think of you if he finds out?

191
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:40,217
Delete it before I tell him everything!

192
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:43,345
-Go ahead, I'm not scared.
-What?

193
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,723
And I can't delete it even if I wanted to.

194
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:49,643
Will deleting it make a difference?
Didn't everyone already see it?

195
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:53,105
Why are you pushing it this far?

196
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:54,565
Because of Soo-ho?

197
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:56,901
If he finds out,

198
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:58,777
he won't even consider you as a friend.

199
00:12:58,861 --> 00:12:59,695
"A friend"?

200
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:02,990
I have no intention
of foolishly remaining a friend

201
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:05,075
and having a painful
one-sided love like you.

202
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:08,704
Lim Ju-kyung.

203
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:12,583
You think you destroyed her, don't you?

204
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:17,796
It's you who's destroyed.

205
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:35,606
-Hey, Cho-rong!
-Hey, what is it?

206
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:36,565
Come out. Hurry.

207
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:39,235
My small and precious poop
needs to come out

208
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,737
-for me to do that.
-Cut it out and come out!

209
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:49,245
-Come on!
-What the heck? Seriously?

210
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,456
I hear only the forum administrator
can take down the video.

211
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,457
Who is that?

212
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:54,875
How would I know?

213
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,043
Why do you not know?

214
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:58,712
I don't even know when I can poop.
How would I know that?

215
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:00,047
Then find out somehow.

216
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:03,259
How can I find that… Let's see.

217
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:04,969
By the way, Seo-jun.

218
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:08,347
-Why are you suddenly making a fuss?
-About what?

219
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:09,557
Come on.

220
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:12,059
Do you like Lim Ju-kyung?

221
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:13,519
What are you talking about?

222
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:14,728
Just find out who it is.

223
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:17,856
How do you expect me to find that out,
you idiot--

224
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:27,700
Well, what's going on over in class five?

225
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:31,453
How could two kids not come to school
without saying anything…

226
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:34,498
Maybe it's because their teacher
is so preoccupied with love.

227
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:36,208
With love?

228
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,296
Hee-kyung,

229
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:43,215
were we being selfish?

230
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:15,956
Excuse me.

231
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,376
You know this is the last stop, right?

232
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:34,850
Where are you?

233
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,894
Ju-kyung, please tell me where you are.

234
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:38,312
GIRLFRIEND

235
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:48,632
Excuse me.

236
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:50,634
Are you still here?

237
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:52,636
The last bus stopped running.

238
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,555
It's getting late, so you should leave.

239
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:55,639
It's cold, and you're…

240
00:16:56,932 --> 00:16:58,058
Head home soon, okay?

241
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:00,060
Leave soon.

242
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:08,610
BOYFRIEND: PLEASE TELL ME WHERE YOU ARE
4 MISSED CALLS FROM BOYFRIEND

243
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:49,777
Your call will be forwarded to voicemail.

244
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:50,903
Ju-kyung.

245
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:53,030
Where are you?

246
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:57,201
Just tell me where you are, please.

247
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,637
-Hello?
-Has Ju-kyung not come home yet?

248
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,930
No, not yet.

249
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:19,431
Lim Ju-bal…

250
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:21,058
Where is she at this hour?

251
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:22,017
Got it.

252
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:39,201
Ju-kyung!

253
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,167
Ju-kyung.

254
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:38,927
Ju-kyung.

255
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:45,017
Lim Ju-kyung.

Ju-kyung, you're home now?

259
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:06,872
Where have you been with your phone off?

260
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:07,831
The library.

261
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:09,833
-How dare you lie to me?
-Honey…

262
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:13,086
You went to the beauty school, didn't you?

263
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:16,006
I wondered why you were
coming home so late lately.

264
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:17,799
Let's talk later.

265
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:20,469
How on earth did you pay for this class?

266
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,096
I really had a difficult day today.

267
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:25,057
Let's talk tomorrow.

268
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,058
Answer me right now!

269
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:28,685
Where did you get the money
to deceive me and take this class?

270
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:30,270
Ju-kyung, you're home!

271
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:33,982
-I worked part-time.
-What?

272
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:36,568
You worked part-time?

273
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:40,572
I told you to study, but you did what?
A part-time job?

274
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:42,991
Who told you to do this?

275
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:45,369
I said we can talk tomorrow.
Leave me alone!

276
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:46,995
Yes, honey. We can talk tomorrow.

277
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,413
Yes, Mom.

278
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:50,165
What's there to wait until tomorrow?

279
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,334
Promise me you'll drop this makeup stuff.

280
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:53,252
Come on!

281
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:56,546
Why…

282
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:00,092
Why does it have to be cosmetology?

283
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:05,430
Do you want to live the way I do?

284
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:12,562
You go get a refund tomorrow.

285
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:16,024
No, I'm going to get it myself.

286
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,610
I'll kick you out if you do this again!

287
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:19,569
Got it?

288
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:21,029
Why you too?

289
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,615
What if that's what I want to learn?

290
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:26,994
Why is everyone denying me things?

291
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:31,415
I want to do things I like
and meet someone I like!

292
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:34,042
Can't I be happy?

293
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,794
Don't I deserve it?

294
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:39,339
You brat! You come here!

295
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:40,674
Honey.

296
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:41,591
Ju-kyung!

297
00:21:42,592 --> 00:21:43,510
Honey.

298
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:44,761
Let go of me!

299
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:46,972
Speak to her tomorrow.

300
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:04,114
Ju-kyung.

301
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:32,642
How is she dating Lee Soo-ho
with that face?

302
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:34,019
They don't suit each other.

303
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:35,771
Wake up, Lee Soo-ho.

304
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:37,606
Shouldn't we pick a new model
for the school?

305
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:39,441
What if people call us a school of trolls?

306
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:41,193
She's having it easy with makeup.

307
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:42,611
Compared to her, I'm a goddess.

308
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:46,114
Honestly, if a video of me being bullied
were on the web, I'd kill myself.

309
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:49,201
Who submitted this?
Isn't it bullying to submit this video?

310
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:02,672
I'm going to kill everyone
who leaves mean comments below mine.

311
00:23:03,381 --> 00:23:04,674
What's he doing?

312
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:06,468
He looks upset.

313
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:08,887
He's very upset.

314
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:13,475
"I'm going to kill everyone
who leaves mean comments below mine."

315
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:15,602
That's so cringe!

316
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:19,648
"I'm going to kill everyone
who leaves mean comments below mine."

317
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:20,982
Shut up.

318
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,359
"Shut up."

319
00:23:23,026 --> 00:23:24,236
Man, seriously?

320
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:25,153
Hey, Cho-rong.

321
00:23:25,862 --> 00:23:26,905
Cho-rong!

322
00:23:26,988 --> 00:23:28,573
Did you find the administrator?

323
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:30,575
Hold on.

324
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:34,162
If you tell me who the administrator is,

325
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:36,873
I'll get you on a date
with Han Seo-jun. Not lying.

326
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:39,417
What are you going to do
if you find the administrator?

327
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:42,254
Are you her knight in shining armor?

328
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:43,755
Seo-jun likes Lim Ju--

329
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:45,132
Hey, come on.

330
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:46,049
Just eat it.

331
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:48,260
-It's Ju-kyung!
-Where?

332
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:50,929
Hi, I'm Ju-kyung.

333
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:53,807
Hi, Seo-jun. I'm not that easy.

334
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:10,532
The signal will change soon.
Wait for the next signal.

335
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:39,144
Me?

336
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:45,150
Why are you calling?
So you can hear my voice sooner?

337
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:47,736
Please stop.

338
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:50,155
Don't come over.

339
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:52,824
Let's talk like this.

340
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:54,951
I might waver

341
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:56,703
if I see your face.

342
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:58,288
What's going on?

343
00:25:01,249 --> 00:25:02,125
We…

344
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:06,922
should take a break.

345
00:25:08,131 --> 00:25:10,091
Out of nowhere? Why?

346
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:12,177
I don't think this is right.

347
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:14,763
I didn't know Ju-kyung
would take it so hard.

348
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:18,183
I shouldn't have started a relationship

349
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:20,810
knowing you're Ju-kyung's older sister.

350
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:22,812
Hey, you're overreacting.

351
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:24,648
Who breaks up over such things?

352
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:25,565
I…

353
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:27,984
will be transferred next year.

354
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:29,945
Just for one year.

355
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:32,781
One year after today, at this hour.

356
00:25:33,573 --> 00:25:36,076
If we still love each other then,

357
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:39,037
we can see each other again.

358
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,288
What? One year?

359
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:43,416
Stop.

360
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,876
Please stop!

361
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:51,716
Goodbye.

362
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:00,308
Jun-woo!

363
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:02,352
Han Jun-woo!

364
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:06,189
What kind of lousy breakup is this?

365
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:13,947
Hey, Soo-ho!

366
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:19,995
-What brings you by?
-I've known you for so long.

367
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:23,915
I'm sorry for what you went through
over Se-yeon's death.

368
00:26:24,624 --> 00:26:26,001
I thought I should apologize.

369
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:28,920
You should apologize
to Se-yeon and his family.

370
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:29,963
Right.

371
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:33,508
I went to see them
and asked for forgiveness.

372
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:36,594
I'll spend the rest of my life
asking for forgiveness.

373
00:26:37,804 --> 00:26:38,680
Soo-ho,

374
00:26:39,597 --> 00:26:40,432
Mr. Lee truly

375
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:42,267
had no idea.

376
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:46,396
Even so, he took full responsibility.

377
00:26:47,063 --> 00:26:49,274
The issue in the past
is also a misunderstanding.

378
00:26:49,357 --> 00:26:50,942
He never crossed the line.

379
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:53,111
Why are you explaining all this to me?

380
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:54,279
He's clumsy at times,

381
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:56,323
but he really cares about you.

382
00:26:56,823 --> 00:26:58,033
I know that for certain.

383
00:26:58,742 --> 00:26:59,576
So…

384
00:27:00,827 --> 00:27:02,078
resent me all you want.

385
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:05,040
But don't hate your dad.

386
00:27:06,374 --> 00:27:09,085
I heard how you suffered for so long

387
00:27:10,503 --> 00:27:12,464
and thought I should tell you this much.

388
00:27:13,548 --> 00:27:14,382
I'll get going.

389
00:27:28,396 --> 00:27:29,981
Do you have time today?

390
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:34,152
I'm leaving Korea soon
and wanted to see you before I go.

391
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:38,323
-Hey, Soo-ho!
-How's Ju-kyung?

392
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:40,909
She's not going to school today either.

393
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:43,078
Then can you ask her to take my calls?

394
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:45,830
She's not in a condition
to take calls at all.

395
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:49,292
Aren't you going to school?

396
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:51,336
Are you protesting
the decision about beauty school?

397
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,546
Why is she being difficult
all of a sudden?

398
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:57,884
Honey, you should just go to work.
I'll speak to her quietly later, okay?

399
00:27:59,886 --> 00:28:01,763
Then tell her I'll be waiting
at Prince Comics.

400
00:28:03,681 --> 00:28:05,100
I guess you really love her.

401
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:06,976
Still, you can't skip school today too.

402
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:09,312
Let's go to school.

403
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:11,147
When it looks like she's doing better,

404
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:13,400
I'll ask Dad to tell her
to answer your calls.

405
00:28:15,568 --> 00:28:16,569
Let's go.

406
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:22,992
Gosh, Soo-ho,
where did you get those shoes?

407
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:26,121
That was too childish of me.

408
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:27,497
Forget I said that.

409
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:32,836
The school website's forum is blowing up.

410
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:33,837
WAKE UP, LEE SOO-HO

411
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,838
SHE'S HAVING IT EASY WITH MAKEUP

412
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:36,381
There are so many mean comments.

413
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:39,342
We better close the website
for the time being.

414
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:40,719
-Right?
-Yes.

415
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:41,845
This is crazy.

416
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:45,640
Was this the reason
she skipped school yesterday?

417
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:48,059
How should we go about this?

418
00:28:48,643 --> 00:28:50,854
Those kids in the video
aren't even our students,

419
00:28:50,937 --> 00:28:52,731
so we can't penalize them for bullying.

420
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:54,941
And how are we going to find
whoever posted it?

421
00:28:55,024 --> 00:28:55,984
Goodness gracious.

422
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:58,403
What about Ju-kyung?
She didn't come today either?

423
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:02,157
-No.
-A student refusing to come to school…

424
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:05,076
By the looks of it, this is quite serious.

425
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:08,079
Mr. Han, you should meet
with Ju-kyung's parents and talk it out.

426
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:09,956
Yes, I will.

427
00:29:12,208 --> 00:29:15,295
What do I do with this pushover, Jun-woo?

428
00:29:15,378 --> 00:29:16,379
Just for one year.

429
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:19,090
If we still love each other then,

430
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:20,592
we can see each other again.

431
00:29:22,635 --> 00:29:24,512
Ms. Lim, are the meeting materials ready?

432
00:29:27,056 --> 00:29:29,601
One year? Get out of here.

433
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:31,603
Darn it.

434
00:29:31,686 --> 00:29:34,063
Take your time. Please do.

435
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:36,858
HER ACTUAL FACE, MAKEUP MONSTER

436
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:38,151
I'M SCARED TO SEE HER IN MY DREAMS

437
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:46,034
Her face is a mess.

438
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:49,287
-Hey, Soo-ho.
-Good morning.

439
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:51,581
Watch what you say.

440
00:29:55,668 --> 00:29:56,836
UGLY FACE! GROSS SMILE!

441
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,087
Who did this?

442
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,882
Why don't you just rip it off?

443
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:07,305
How is she doing?

444
00:30:11,434 --> 00:30:12,393
The person

445
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:14,646
who posted the video…

446
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:16,815
I know.

447
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:18,942
You do?

448
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:29,327
I like you so much, what do I do?

449
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:32,372
I find you so pretty, what do I do?

450
00:30:32,455 --> 00:30:34,833
Jeez. Not a great way to start the day.

451
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:38,628
I'm not in the mood to smile. Stop it.

452
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:41,798
Won't you smile for me?
What do you think?

453
00:30:41,881 --> 00:30:45,009
Don't say a thing and laugh
Giggle, giggle

454
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:47,345
Seriously, I'm only laughing
thanks to you.

455
00:30:47,428 --> 00:30:48,596
My Tu-ah laughed!

456
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:52,600
-Su-ah, I love you smiling, what do I do?
-It's okay.

457
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:55,270
What do I do? What do I do?

458
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:58,773
I find you so pretty, what do I do?

459
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:04,028
Su-ah, I love you smiling, what do I do?

460
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:07,323
I love it so much, what do I do?

461
00:31:08,157 --> 00:31:10,702
Hey, everyone.
Let's have the morning assembly.

462
00:31:20,753 --> 00:31:23,548
Ju-kyung didn't come
to school today either.

463
00:31:23,631 --> 00:31:26,175
Sir, are we getting a new school model?

464
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:28,553
-Everyone was making a fuss.
-That's right.

465
00:31:28,636 --> 00:31:31,431
Ju-kyung isn't the face of Saebom High.

466
00:31:31,514 --> 00:31:33,349
-Totally.
-Right?

467
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:37,312
Is that why you took her posters
in the hallway down?

468
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:44,861
You all know why she didn't come to school
and how she must feel right now,

469
00:31:44,944 --> 00:31:46,237
don't you?

470
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,699
Yet none of you are worried for her?

471
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:53,995
I'm so disappointed in you.

472
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:56,164
Moreover, you scare me.

473
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:58,708
How can you watch a video
of a classmate being bullied,

474
00:31:58,791 --> 00:32:00,418
then laugh and gossip over it?

475
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:04,172
The pain Ju-kyung had to endure

476
00:32:04,672 --> 00:32:06,257
is nothing but gossip to you?

477
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:15,558
Ju-kyung, did you have lunch?

478
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:16,893
You're not crying, are you?

479
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:18,686
-Hey, it's Lee Soo-ho.
-Do you think it's real?

480
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:19,812
They can't be dating, right?

481
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:21,522
I really am dating Lim Ju-kyung.

482
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:23,942
-Goodness.
-That's huge.

483
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:27,612
Hey, Soo-ho,
don't you have something to say to me?

484
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:29,530
Like what?

485
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:32,617
Why didn't you tell me
you two were dating?

486
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:35,286
You know how hard I tried
to help you two out.

487
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:38,164
My heart broke for you
when I thought you got dumped.

488
00:32:38,247 --> 00:32:39,624
It ached so much

489
00:32:39,707 --> 00:32:42,835
that I even lost sleep
and worried for you.

490
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:44,712
Do you even consider me your friend?

491
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:46,714
Right, I'm sorry.

492
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:48,549
Ju-kyung wanted to keep it a secret.

493
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:50,301
But do you know what upsets me more?

494
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:53,054
Seo-jun seemed to know you were dating.

495
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:54,305
What about it?

496
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:56,724
You're dumping me
because you made up with him.

497
00:32:56,808 --> 00:33:00,645
Hey, if Seo-jun and I were both drowning,
who would you save first?

498
00:33:00,728 --> 00:33:03,064
-You first.
-Me? You'll save me first?

499
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:04,148
Seo-jun's a good swimmer.

500
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:06,234
Anyway,
you said you'd save me first, right?

501
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:08,903
By the way…

502
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:11,489
Yes, you can ask me anything,
my best friend.

503
00:33:11,572 --> 00:33:14,492
How do I cheer my girlfriend up
when she's upset?

504
00:33:14,575 --> 00:33:16,077
I didn't want to say this again but…

505
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,829
What do we do with you?

506
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:22,000
Ju-kyung,

507
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:24,127
aren't you going to eat?

508
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:28,715
I taped up the registration card

509
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:31,175
and it's as good as new.

510
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:34,262
And I will help you convince Mom.

511
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:36,597
So come out and eat something.

512
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:37,640
Ju-kyung.

513
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:40,226
Ju…

514
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:47,608
It smells amazing.

515
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,654
It looks amazing.
Your mouth is watering, right?

516
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:53,990
Live Food Show, Dad edition!

517
00:33:54,073 --> 00:33:57,785
Juicy pork belly grilled by your dad!

518
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:59,120
It looks delicious.

519
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:00,038
Come out!

520
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:02,373
You need to eat
to have the strength to fight Mom!

521
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:04,709
Then you can get her approval
for beauty school.

522
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:07,170
I'm going to try one myself!

523
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:09,505
Come on, Ju-kyung!
Guess how good this tastes?

524
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,842
No pork belly has been this good.

525
00:34:12,925 --> 00:34:15,470
Is this pork belly or ice cream?

526
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:18,890
Pork belly grilled by Dad
melts in your mouth like ice cream.

527
00:34:18,973 --> 00:34:20,391
Try some!

528
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:26,898
Seo-jun!

529
00:34:29,984 --> 00:34:31,319
-A…
-"A"?

530
00:34:32,111 --> 00:34:33,154
"A" what?

531
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,531
Amazing?

532
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:36,783
Angry?

533
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:38,910
Annoying?

534
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:41,579
Anonymous! The anonymous forum.

535
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:44,499
-I found it.
-You found it?

536
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:46,250
You found the administrator?

537
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:47,543
Who is it?

538
00:34:51,547 --> 00:34:53,257
FRESHMAN JIN HEE-JEONG

539
00:34:56,677 --> 00:34:58,387
Hey, Seo-jun…

540
00:34:58,471 --> 00:35:01,349
Hey, wait for me! Hey!

541
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:03,601
-She must be crazy!
-Stop right there!

542
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:06,270
-Let go!
-You let go, you crazy freak!

543
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:07,730
You're the crazy one!

544
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:10,650
Even if it were submitted,
who posts such a thing on the forum?

545
00:35:10,733 --> 00:35:12,568
It's on the person who submitted it!

546
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:14,987
Do I have to review
every single one before posting?

547
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:16,656
-That little…
-Let go!

548
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:19,242
Hey, you told me not to use violence!

549
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:21,160
You told me not to hit anyone,
even with flowers!

550
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:22,411
Who the heck are you?

551
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:23,412
Let go!

552
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:25,915
Take your hands off her!

553
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:29,293
-What?
-It's Han Seo-jun!

554
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:30,711
Seo-jun.

555
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:33,881
Han Seo-jun's here!

556
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:35,383
Han Seo-jun's here!

557
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:37,468
Gosh, why are you stepping in, bro?

558
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:40,221
-"Bro"?
-Did you know she's his sister?

559
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:42,431
What did you just say to my little sister?

560
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:45,309
-Your little sister?
-That's her brother?

561
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:47,061
Han Go-un was Han Seo-jun's sister?

562
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:50,606
What did you say?

563
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:52,066
-I can't believe it.
-My gosh.

564
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:58,322
Hey,

565
00:35:58,948 --> 00:36:00,158
are you the administrator?

566
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:02,326
Yes.

567
00:36:03,911 --> 00:36:05,037
You'll delete it, right?

568
00:36:07,373 --> 00:36:08,207
Jeez.

569
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:10,835
I told you
to keep your distance at school!

570
00:36:10,918 --> 00:36:13,462
What kind of brother would I be
if I sat back and did nothing?

571
00:36:13,963 --> 00:36:15,173
I held back, okay?

572
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:16,674
You should have tried harder.

573
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:19,886
By the way,

574
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:22,763
so what if I'm your brother?
Do I embarrass you?

575
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:24,140
You are clueless.

576
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:27,643
People will now bother me
like they did in middle school.

577
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:30,521
"Introduce me to your brother."
"Why don't you look like him?"

578
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:32,607
Bring them all to me.
I'll take care of them.

579
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:33,691
No, thank you.

580
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:35,484
Don't you dare come to my floor.

581
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:38,196
Go-un.

582
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:40,615
Hey, Fly. Don't follow me around.

583
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:43,951
Why? You worried for me earlier.
What is it now?

584
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:46,204
Hey!

585
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:48,039
What do you want?

586
00:36:48,122 --> 00:36:50,041
Are you still following my sister around?

587
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:52,293
You're asking for it.

588
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:53,211
What?

589
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:55,838
I can't even have a crush on her?

590
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:57,506
Have you never liked anyone before?

591
00:36:58,299 --> 00:37:02,386
Can you just stop loving someone
because someone gives you trouble?

592
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:03,763
It's not something I can control!

593
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:10,895
Goodbye.

594
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:31,123
Sorry.

595
00:37:39,715 --> 00:37:41,259
Did something happen with you two?

596
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:43,886
What? No, why?

597
00:37:45,012 --> 00:37:46,264
Nothing, just asking.

598
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:50,101
I saw Ju-kyung's video
was deleted from the forum.

599
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:52,603
It was? That's good.

600
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:54,188
Let's go.

601
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:11,664
Hey, Soo-ho!

602
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:14,792
You came by again.

603
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:17,670
I told you, I'll let you know
when she's better.

604
00:38:17,753 --> 00:38:20,089
You might as well set up camp out here.

605
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:23,968
-Can you give this to her?
-Thanks for caring,

606
00:38:24,051 --> 00:38:26,095
but she's not even coming out of her room.

607
00:38:26,178 --> 00:38:28,806
Then she must not be eating.
You left her like that?

608
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:30,808
Like I said, thanks for caring.

609
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:33,311
But I'm not your errand boy.

610
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:35,271
Would you like a tip?

611
00:38:43,362 --> 00:38:44,697
Do you want them?

612
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:47,533
Soo-ho, I'd be forever…

613
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:49,660
No.

614
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:51,912
I can't make deals around Ju-kyung.

615
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:54,915
Give it here.
I just need to give it to her, right?

616
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:14,352
Ju-kyung.

617
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:16,354
Ju-kyung.

618
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,610
How can she stay so silent?

619
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:27,448
Wait, Lim Ju-bal.
What if she's thinking of ending it all?

620
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:29,200
Ju-kyung!

621
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:30,951
No!

622
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:32,787
Ju-kyung!

623
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:35,373
Ju-kyung, you can't do that!

624
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:36,749
Ju-kyung, don't think…

625
00:39:36,832 --> 00:39:37,666
What?

626
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:43,506
-What are you doing?
-Ju-kyung, you scared me!

627
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:46,300
Hey, wait.

628
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,220
Soo-ho brought this for you.

629
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:51,972
You should eat something. Okay?

630
00:39:56,977 --> 00:39:59,480
Soo-ho has been waiting outside
since yesterday.

631
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:01,357
Can you at least answer his calls?

632
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:32,930
I was going to come see you anyway,
Mr. Han.

633
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:37,560
Actually, Ju-kyung plans to
study cosmetology or some such…

634
00:40:37,643 --> 00:40:39,937
I can't even tell you how upset I am.

635
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:42,565
She even got a part-time job
and took a course in secret.

636
00:40:42,648 --> 00:40:43,482
I can't even…

637
00:40:44,191 --> 00:40:45,443
Did you know about that?

638
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:48,279
Ma'am, well…

639
00:40:49,071 --> 00:40:51,866
The reason I asked you here
is regarding a different issue.

640
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:54,785
A different issue?

641
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:00,416
This might come as a shock to you,

642
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:03,752
but Ju-kyung is in a difficult situation,

643
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:07,173
and I thought you should be aware of it.

644
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:33,782
Is that…

645
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:36,744
my Ju-kyung?

646
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:44,168
This isn't CG or anything like that?

647
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:48,172
It's really…

648
00:41:49,548 --> 00:41:50,799
my Ju-kyung…

649
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:56,597
Ju-kyung.

650
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:16,200
Lim Ju-kyung?

651
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:24,124
You're here.

652
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:27,336
Did you wait in this cold weather?

653
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:28,837
You could have called.

654
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:31,674
I have something to ask you.

655
00:42:33,842 --> 00:42:34,802
Something to ask me?

656
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:38,013
There's no way you would…

657
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:41,642
But I kept having these scary thoughts.

658
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:45,521
Su-jin,

659
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:49,608
it's not you, is it?

660
00:42:53,153 --> 00:42:54,572
My secret past…

661
00:42:55,948 --> 00:42:58,742
Me dating Soo-ho…

662
00:42:59,702 --> 00:43:01,078
you're the only one who knows.

663
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:05,666
The only person I can think of is you.

664
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,378
But you didn't do it, did you?

665
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:12,339
You didn't submit the video
to the forum, right?

666
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:14,216
If you don't think it's me,
then why are you here?

667
00:43:16,468 --> 00:43:18,470
I want to hear you say
that you didn't do it.

668
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:22,933
It's a shame.

669
00:43:23,726 --> 00:43:25,144
I won't be able to say it.

670
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:27,730
Why…

671
00:43:30,649 --> 00:43:31,900
Why did you do that?

672
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:36,405
Why would you do that to me?

673
00:43:36,488 --> 00:43:38,907
I hate seeing you by his side.

674
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:42,161
What?

675
00:43:42,661 --> 00:43:45,289
Didn't you run to my school
after that incident at Yongpa High?

676
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:47,583
Why don't you run this time too?

677
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:49,335
You're good at that.

678
00:43:50,544 --> 00:43:54,882
Run away as far as you can and hide.

679
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:57,092
I mean it.

680
00:45:09,832 --> 00:45:13,794
RESERVED FOR LIM JU-KYUNG.
SIT HERE AND YOU'LL GROW BUTT HAIR.

681
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:43,365
I've sorted all the books.
Is there anything else?

682
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:46,493
I said, there's no need.
Just sit and read comic books.

683
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:47,911
Time flies when you're busy.

684
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:50,956
That's what I'm saying.
Why are you killing time here?

685
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:53,041
Be honest. Ju-bal dumped you, right?

686
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:54,543
-No.
-Please.

687
00:45:54,626 --> 00:45:57,463
When a guy waits for a girl
in front of her place endlessly,

688
00:45:58,046 --> 00:45:59,381
it's all the same story.

689
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:00,424
It's not like that.

690
00:46:01,717 --> 00:46:02,843
It's frustrating, right?

691
00:46:04,386 --> 00:46:05,304
Pick a card.

692
00:46:05,387 --> 00:46:07,973
I'll read her mind for you.

693
00:46:08,557 --> 00:46:09,433
No thanks.

694
00:46:09,516 --> 00:46:11,894
It's not like
you have better things to do.

695
00:46:11,977 --> 00:46:13,145
Just pick one.

696
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:30,954
It's The Lovers card.

697
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:34,082
What was the reading for it
when upside down?

698
00:46:34,666 --> 00:46:35,501
Hold on.

699
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:49,431
UPSIDE DOWN INTERPRETATION
PARTING

700
00:47:18,293 --> 00:47:19,336
Ju-kyung.

701
00:47:19,419 --> 00:47:20,671
Where have you been?

702
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:22,756
Just around the neighborhood.

703
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:24,174
What about dinner?

704
00:47:24,758 --> 00:47:25,634
I'm skipping it.

705
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:29,555
Why would you skip a meal? You…

706
00:47:36,144 --> 00:47:37,563
My little girl…

707
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:40,065
Mom.

708
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:42,901
Mom went to school.

709
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:48,657
Why didn't you tell me?

710
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:50,951
You should have told me about it.

711
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:53,120
Why did you hold onto that
all by yourself?

712
00:47:54,788 --> 00:47:56,832
I didn't because I knew
you'd react this way.

713
00:47:57,624 --> 00:47:58,750
How could I?

714
00:47:58,834 --> 00:48:01,878
Still, you should have told me.

715
00:48:03,422 --> 00:48:06,550
I had no idea my baby
was being treated like that.

716
00:48:17,102 --> 00:48:18,061
Who are they?

717
00:48:18,145 --> 00:48:20,230
I'm going to find them
and get back at them!

718
00:48:20,314 --> 00:48:22,316
Who are they? Tell me everything. Come on.

719
00:48:22,399 --> 00:48:23,650
Come on, Mom.

720
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:25,360
Mom, stop crying.

721
00:48:26,028 --> 00:48:27,904
You're upsetting Ju-kyung.

722
00:48:29,698 --> 00:48:32,784
It must have been so difficult for you.

723
00:48:40,208 --> 00:48:41,043
Did

724
00:48:42,836 --> 00:48:43,670
they

725
00:48:44,671 --> 00:48:45,631
hit you?

726
00:48:46,506 --> 00:48:48,300
Where did they hit you?

727
00:48:49,635 --> 00:48:51,470
Come on, tell me everything.

728
00:48:52,929 --> 00:48:53,764
No,

729
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:55,891
I wasn't hit.

730
00:48:56,683 --> 00:48:58,852
It's all in the past. I'm all right.

731
00:49:00,354 --> 00:49:01,563
I'm all right.

732
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:09,696
My baby girl.

733
00:49:12,491 --> 00:49:13,867
I'm sorry.

734
00:49:36,515 --> 00:49:40,811
I had no idea
because she's always smiling.

735
00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:46,149
It's all because I was so tough on her.

736
00:49:46,692 --> 00:49:49,695
I scared her so much that
she couldn't even confide in her own mom.

737
00:49:50,487 --> 00:49:51,822
It's all my fault.

738
00:49:51,905 --> 00:49:53,657
How is that your fault?

739
00:49:57,703 --> 00:49:59,204
Right after I had Ju-kyung,

740
00:49:59,913 --> 00:50:02,249
I got pregnant with Ju-young.

741
00:50:02,332 --> 00:50:04,334
I left her with her grandparents
in the countryside

742
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:05,877
and let them do the hard work.

743
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:09,131
That's why she grew up
hearing things like she was adopted.

744
00:50:11,049 --> 00:50:14,428
She's not being loved in the world
because she wasn't loved enough at home.

745
00:50:16,972 --> 00:50:21,768
I didn't raise her like a princess,
nor let her feel pretty and valued.

746
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:24,229
It's all my fault.

747
00:50:24,312 --> 00:50:26,106
Who else's fault is it?

748
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:29,443
It's my fault.

749
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:32,237
I made you work to the bone,

750
00:50:32,988 --> 00:50:35,282
leaving you with no time
to care for the kids.

751
00:50:36,283 --> 00:50:38,243
I gave her such a hard time
over her makeup.

752
00:50:39,619 --> 00:50:42,706
There was a reason she made such a fuss
when I threw her makeup away.

753
00:50:50,756 --> 00:50:52,841
I'm sorry I didn't realize
what you were going through.

754
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:57,888
It's nothing.

755
00:50:58,638 --> 00:51:00,432
Don't pay any attention to those punks.

756
00:51:01,433 --> 00:51:03,769
Only you can decide your own worth.

757
00:51:03,852 --> 00:51:06,271
As long as you're sure of yourself,
no one can touch you.

758
00:51:06,354 --> 00:51:07,189
Understand?

759
00:51:11,818 --> 00:51:13,361
Stop crying and go to sleep.

760
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:22,848
Get out.

761
00:52:23,431 --> 00:52:24,808
-Why?
-Come on, get out.

762
00:52:26,184 --> 00:52:29,521
-Where are we going?
-Enough with the chatter and follow me.

763
00:52:30,272 --> 00:52:31,106
Gosh.

764
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:43,577
Can you take off your glasses?

765
00:52:52,252 --> 00:52:54,754
We might need some extensive surgery.

766
00:52:55,422 --> 00:52:58,967
Whatever it takes to make her
as pretty as a goddess.

767
00:52:59,634 --> 00:53:01,219
-A goddess…
-Mom.

768
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:06,558
Well, she already has double eyelids.

769
00:53:06,641 --> 00:53:08,476
With a non-incisional eye correction,

770
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:10,312
we'll have her eyes pop more.

771
00:53:11,563 --> 00:53:12,981
A slit in the front,

772
00:53:13,481 --> 00:53:14,774
and a slit in the back.

773
00:53:15,442 --> 00:53:16,568
Her eyes will be larger,

774
00:53:16,651 --> 00:53:18,361
just like they've been photoshopped.

775
00:53:19,195 --> 00:53:23,408
As for her nose,
the bridge will be lifted using silicone.

776
00:53:23,491 --> 00:53:26,077
The tip of her nose
will be made more pointy

777
00:53:26,161 --> 00:53:29,164
with the cartilage
collected from her left ear.

778
00:53:29,247 --> 00:53:32,334
But her nose is as cute as a button.

779
00:53:33,126 --> 00:53:34,961
Her nose has been complimented a lot.

780
00:53:36,671 --> 00:53:38,965
From a medical point of view,

781
00:53:39,966 --> 00:53:41,217
it's not pretty at all.

782
00:53:43,803 --> 00:53:46,306
Okay, we can also cut the hairline

783
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:47,599
and give her a face-lift

784
00:53:47,682 --> 00:53:50,101
by pulling up the skin as much as we can.

785
00:53:50,185 --> 00:53:52,354
Then we can take some fat
from her buttocks

786
00:53:52,437 --> 00:53:55,523
and inject it into her forehead,
chin, and cheekbones.

787
00:53:57,943 --> 00:54:00,111
With the fat injection
all around her face,

788
00:54:00,195 --> 00:54:03,615
her rather flat face
will look more three-dimensional.

789
00:54:03,698 --> 00:54:05,450
What's the point? She's not a foreigner.

790
00:54:06,868 --> 00:54:10,121
Double jaw surgery
will shave her jawline off,

791
00:54:10,205 --> 00:54:11,581
making the cheekbones slimmer…

792
00:54:11,665 --> 00:54:14,834
Her face isn't an apple.
What's there to shave off?

793
00:54:14,918 --> 00:54:17,545
That way her jawline
will look slimmer, like a V.

794
00:54:17,629 --> 00:54:20,799
They say a pronounced jaw
brings you luck in your later years.

795
00:54:20,882 --> 00:54:22,676
What would you have me do, then?

796
00:54:23,551 --> 00:54:25,470
To be honest, to make this face pretty,

797
00:54:25,553 --> 00:54:28,139
you need to start from the ground up.

798
00:54:28,223 --> 00:54:31,184
She's not a redevelopment project.
There's no need for groundwork.

799
00:54:31,267 --> 00:54:33,228
Those slits and cuts will make her pretty?

800
00:54:33,311 --> 00:54:36,231
Who set the standard
of beauty and ugliness?

801
00:54:36,314 --> 00:54:38,316
My daughter looks pretty to me.

802
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:41,361
Come on, Mom. Let's just leave, okay?

803
00:54:41,444 --> 00:54:43,405
Goodness, I could give you a simulation.

804
00:54:43,989 --> 00:54:45,949
To make her pretty like so,

805
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:48,994
starting from the ground up
is the only way.

806
00:54:49,077 --> 00:54:50,078
My goodness!

807
00:54:50,161 --> 00:54:52,789
A ton of money
will have her look like this?

808
00:54:52,872 --> 00:54:55,250
She can get that face
just by putting makeup on.

809
00:54:56,042 --> 00:54:57,002
Gosh,

810
00:54:57,085 --> 00:54:59,921
plastic surgery is no better
than her makeup skills.

811
00:55:00,755 --> 00:55:01,631
Let's go.

812
00:55:01,715 --> 00:55:03,675
Why put a knife to a perfectly fine face?

813
00:55:05,552 --> 00:55:06,469
Wait…

814
00:55:10,515 --> 00:55:12,726
What? A goddess?

815
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:32,328
I heard everyone at your school
saw the video.

816
00:55:35,915 --> 00:55:37,125
Don't you worry.

817
00:55:37,208 --> 00:55:39,919
I'll get you transferred
to somewhere no one knows you.

818
00:55:41,546 --> 00:55:42,380
What?

819
00:55:59,481 --> 00:56:01,941
PRINCE COMICS

820
00:56:03,109 --> 00:56:05,278
Why don't you run this time too?

821
00:56:05,862 --> 00:56:07,322
You're good at that.

822
00:56:07,405 --> 00:56:12,035
Run away as far as you can and hide.

823
00:56:12,118 --> 00:56:13,411
I mean it.

824
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:22,837
It's Ju-kyung.

825
00:56:33,765 --> 00:56:34,599
Did you cry?

826
00:56:35,642 --> 00:56:36,559
No.

827
00:56:39,687 --> 00:56:41,397
Then why won't you show me your face?

828
00:56:43,024 --> 00:56:44,734
It's because I feel bad for you.

829
00:56:45,401 --> 00:56:46,277
For what?

830
00:56:46,361 --> 00:56:47,779
I made you the target

831
00:56:48,404 --> 00:56:50,281
of all those mean comments for no reason.

832
00:56:52,742 --> 00:56:54,786
That's why I can't look you in the eye.

833
00:56:54,869 --> 00:56:56,871
But still, show me your face.

834
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:01,835
I kept waiting for…

835
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:04,170
Squirrel.

836
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:08,007
You're not going to…

837
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:10,176
Meow.

838
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:14,347
That's from ages ago.

839
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:17,767
You still don't remember.

840
00:57:18,393 --> 00:57:19,227
What?

841
00:57:24,524 --> 00:57:25,567
I'm so relieved.

842
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:30,155
I missed you so much.

843
00:57:45,962 --> 00:57:46,796
Let's get out.

844
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:49,632
-What?
-You can't hide here forever.

845
00:57:49,716 --> 00:57:50,633
Let's go.

846
00:57:57,807 --> 00:57:59,142
Are you tired already?

847
00:57:59,225 --> 00:58:01,853
Yes. Why don't we just go back?

848
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:05,273
Use your strength.

849
00:58:05,356 --> 00:58:06,441
The thing is…

850
00:58:06,941 --> 00:58:09,068
I haven't eaten anything,

851
00:58:09,152 --> 00:58:10,361
so I have no strength.

852
00:58:11,237 --> 00:58:12,155
This won't do.

853
00:58:12,238 --> 00:58:14,115
Okay, let's just go back.

854
00:58:15,366 --> 00:58:17,410
I said, let's just go back.

855
00:58:18,536 --> 00:58:20,788
-I'm heavy.
-Let's go.

856
00:58:20,872 --> 00:58:22,624
Hey, I'm pretty heavy.

857
00:58:28,254 --> 00:58:30,798
How do you feel?
It's better to be outside, right?

858
00:58:30,882 --> 00:58:33,551
Yes, it's nice.

859
00:58:34,636 --> 00:58:35,470
That day…

860
00:58:36,429 --> 00:58:37,555
Why did you run away?

861
00:58:39,974 --> 00:58:41,601
You have me by your side now.

862
00:58:43,645 --> 00:58:44,854
So what made you run?

863
00:58:47,982 --> 00:58:48,858
You're right.

864
00:58:50,026 --> 00:58:51,402
I ran away again.

865
00:58:53,988 --> 00:58:55,782
I guess I just wanted to hide.

866
00:58:55,865 --> 00:58:58,409
But why would you?
You didn't do anything wrong.

867
00:58:58,493 --> 00:58:59,994
Because I was embarrassed.

868
00:59:01,913 --> 00:59:03,248
People now know

869
00:59:04,082 --> 00:59:06,459
about my true face.

870
00:59:08,711 --> 00:59:10,213
What do I do now?

871
00:59:13,007 --> 00:59:15,176
Then is your face with makeup
not your face?

872
00:59:17,345 --> 00:59:19,472
Whatever you look like,

873
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:21,140
with or without makeup,

874
00:59:22,225 --> 00:59:23,643
you're always you, Ju-kyung.

875
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:28,940
I read this somewhere.

876
00:59:29,899 --> 00:59:33,278
Do you know which country
has the best tomatoes?

877
00:59:35,154 --> 00:59:36,239
It's Spain.

878
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:40,868
-Is it?
-Yes.

879
00:59:40,952 --> 00:59:45,164
Spain is the worst place
for tomatoes to survive,

880
00:59:45,248 --> 00:59:46,416
making them taste better.

881
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:48,084
How?

882
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:50,086
It's the worst place for them.

883
00:59:50,753 --> 00:59:51,629
That's exactly why.

884
00:59:53,214 --> 00:59:55,466
As they struggle to survive,

885
00:59:56,092 --> 00:59:57,218
they become stronger

886
00:59:58,219 --> 00:59:59,971
and grow more fragrant.

887
01:00:01,681 --> 01:00:02,640
I see.

888
01:00:04,767 --> 01:00:06,102
You know,

889
01:00:06,185 --> 01:00:09,480
fruits with bruises and lumps

890
01:00:09,564 --> 01:00:11,232
tend to be more delicious and sweet.

891
01:00:12,859 --> 01:00:14,444
Don't you think it's the same with people?

892
01:00:17,155 --> 01:00:18,990
Are you saying I'm ugly?

893
01:00:19,741 --> 01:00:20,575
Yes.

894
01:00:22,035 --> 01:00:23,119
I'm kidding.

895
01:00:24,037 --> 01:00:25,330
I'm not entirely sure,

896
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:29,542
but you are tougher than you think.

897
01:00:32,545 --> 01:00:33,630
Even more so than I am.

898
01:00:40,762 --> 01:00:44,057
I plan on growing tough
like you from now on.

899
01:01:13,461 --> 01:01:15,088
Why did I come here?

900
01:01:18,257 --> 01:01:19,384
They fit you perfectly.

901
01:01:19,467 --> 01:01:21,469
I wanted you to wear these and come to me.

902
01:01:22,053 --> 01:01:25,515
I'll be good to you.
Come to me and be my man, Han Jun-woo.

903
01:01:30,436 --> 01:01:31,437
My feet…

904
01:01:32,772 --> 01:01:34,565
keep carrying me to you, Hee-kyung.

905
01:01:47,453 --> 01:01:48,621
Oh no.

906
01:01:53,751 --> 01:01:54,794
Hee-kyung!

907
01:01:55,378 --> 01:01:56,212
Hey.

908
01:01:56,963 --> 01:01:58,047
What brings you here?

909
01:01:58,131 --> 01:02:00,049
Your company got a lot of lawsuits filed.

910
01:02:01,050 --> 01:02:03,052
-I see.
-Are you off now?

911
01:02:03,886 --> 01:02:05,596
It's about time for you to be hungry.

912
01:02:06,139 --> 01:02:07,765
Do you want to have dinner with me?

913
01:02:07,849 --> 01:02:10,393
We're not on terms
to have dinner together, are we?

914
01:02:10,476 --> 01:02:12,103
Why not?

915
01:02:12,186 --> 01:02:13,855
It's not like I asked you out again.

916
01:02:13,938 --> 01:02:15,857
I'm just asking you
to have a meal with me.

917
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:17,900
Or have you got a boyfriend now?

918
01:02:17,984 --> 01:02:19,444
A boyfriend?

919
01:02:26,659 --> 01:02:27,660
Of course, I don't.

920
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:31,664
For a year, I do, but I don't.

921
01:02:32,790 --> 01:02:34,751
Let's have dinner then.
Where should we go?

922
01:02:34,834 --> 01:02:36,085
You like spicy food.

923
01:02:36,169 --> 01:02:38,004
-Let's get something spicy.
-Sounds good.

924
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:33,434
LIM JU-KYUNG

925
01:03:33,518 --> 01:03:34,560
Are you all right?

926
01:03:45,071 --> 01:03:46,113
LEE SOO-HO

927
01:03:46,197 --> 01:03:47,490
Is Ju-kyung all right?

928
01:03:50,493 --> 01:03:51,869
The video got deleted.

929
01:04:06,676 --> 01:04:08,594
Are you not going to school
again tomorrow?

930
01:04:09,929 --> 01:04:11,931
Mom said she'll get me transferred.

931
01:04:12,014 --> 01:04:12,849
What?

932
01:04:13,432 --> 01:04:14,892
I'm sure she didn't mean it.

933
01:04:15,643 --> 01:04:18,104
How is that possible?
I doubt we can afford to move.

934
01:04:21,941 --> 01:04:23,568
I don't want to go in.

935
01:04:24,861 --> 01:04:27,238
Seeing my mom upset

936
01:04:27,321 --> 01:04:29,657
breaks my heart and makes me feel sorry.

937
01:04:32,118 --> 01:04:33,703
Will you spend the night out then?

938
01:04:34,787 --> 01:04:35,997
That would work for me.

939
01:04:38,457 --> 01:04:39,584
I'll go in.

940
01:04:41,627 --> 01:04:42,503
Wait.

941
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:48,843
Here.

942
01:04:50,887 --> 01:04:54,849
Make sure she sleeps well tonight
without any worries.

943
01:04:55,558 --> 01:04:56,392
Okay?

944
01:05:06,986 --> 01:05:09,030
-I'll see you tomorrow.
-Okay.

945
01:05:09,989 --> 01:05:11,282
I'm really going in.

946
01:05:40,394 --> 01:05:42,146
BOYFRIEND

947
01:05:54,951 --> 01:05:59,038
I like you so much, what do I do?

948
01:05:59,121 --> 01:06:02,500
I find you so pretty, what do I do?

949
01:06:02,583 --> 01:06:05,044
Won't you smile for me?

950
01:06:05,127 --> 01:06:06,796
What do you think?

951
01:06:06,879 --> 01:06:09,215
Don't say a thing and laugh

952
01:06:09,298 --> 01:06:11,175
READ

953
01:06:19,141 --> 01:06:23,187
I find you so pretty, what do I do?

954
01:06:23,270 --> 01:06:27,358
Su-ah, I love you smiling, what do I do?

955
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:51,549
I like you so much, what do I do?

956
01:06:51,632 --> 01:06:56,178
I find you so pretty, what do I do?

957
01:06:56,262 --> 01:06:57,888
Don't say a thing and laugh

958
01:06:57,972 --> 01:06:59,181
What do you think?

959
01:07:07,523 --> 01:07:11,610
I like you so much, what do I do?

960
01:07:11,694 --> 01:07:15,448
I find you so pretty, what do I do?

961
01:07:15,531 --> 01:07:19,577
Won't you smile for me?
What do you think?

962
01:07:19,660 --> 01:07:23,914
Don't say a thing and laugh
Giggle, giggle

963
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:39,305
I guess he left.

964
01:07:45,102 --> 01:07:46,437
Soo-ho.

965
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:55,362
Why did you come out?

966
01:07:56,822 --> 01:07:57,948
What's this?

967
01:08:00,534 --> 01:08:01,368
I'll be off then.

968
01:08:07,333 --> 01:08:09,877
-Hurry back in. You'll catch a cold.
-Okay.

969
01:08:11,128 --> 01:08:12,004
Good night.

970
01:08:13,839 --> 01:08:15,049
Good night.

971
01:09:05,391 --> 01:09:07,351
I know it can't happen anytime soon,

972
01:09:08,060 --> 01:09:11,105
but I hope you'll speak to him
at least once.

973
01:09:17,278 --> 01:09:21,115
I'm leaving Korea soon
and wanted to see you before I go.

974
01:09:21,824 --> 01:09:24,201
I don't want you to have regrets.

975
01:09:35,504 --> 01:09:36,630
Thank you.

976
01:09:52,897 --> 01:09:53,939
Hi, Soo-ho.

977
01:09:54,023 --> 01:09:55,357
I'm in front of your place.

978
01:09:56,150 --> 01:09:57,026
Are you home?

979
01:09:57,109 --> 01:09:58,110
Home?

980
01:10:00,279 --> 01:10:02,781
-You're in front of my place?
-Yes.

981
01:10:02,865 --> 01:10:05,826
Oh no, I just arrived at the airport.

982
01:10:05,910 --> 01:10:07,953
I'll be in the States for a while.

983
01:10:09,580 --> 01:10:12,166
-There are too many reporters--
-When are you coming back?

984
01:10:12,249 --> 01:10:15,836
I have to wrap something up at work,
so I'll come back in a month.

985
01:10:18,214 --> 01:10:19,048
I see.

986
01:10:19,131 --> 01:10:20,299
Soo-ho…

987
01:10:22,426 --> 01:10:23,344
What do you think

988
01:10:24,011 --> 01:10:26,263
about staying with me in the States?

989
01:10:26,972 --> 01:10:28,182
You can study music there.

990
01:10:28,265 --> 01:10:29,600
I'd rather not.

991
01:10:29,683 --> 01:10:31,477
I'll see you when you're back in Korea.

992
01:10:32,144 --> 01:10:33,020
When you're back…

993
01:10:35,022 --> 01:10:36,565
treat me to a nice meal.

994
01:10:39,235 --> 01:10:40,402
Hanging up now.

995
01:10:40,486 --> 01:10:41,654
Hey, Soo-ho.

996
01:10:43,489 --> 01:10:44,323
Sure.

997
01:10:45,115 --> 01:10:46,867
I'll see you when I'm back in Korea.

998
01:11:00,172 --> 01:11:01,090
-Mr. Kang.
-Yes, sir.

999
01:11:01,173 --> 01:11:03,384
Make a reservation
for the day I return to Korea.

1000
01:11:03,467 --> 01:11:04,301
Yes, sir.

1001
01:11:04,385 --> 01:11:06,136
No, I'll handle that myself.

1002
01:11:06,220 --> 01:11:08,138
Can you find out
what kids like these days?

1003
01:11:08,222 --> 01:11:09,348
Of course, sir.

1004
01:11:09,431 --> 01:11:11,433
-It's Lee Ju-hun.
-That is Lee Ju-hun, right?

1005
01:11:19,692 --> 01:11:21,068
Breakfast is ready!

1006
01:11:21,694 --> 01:11:23,112
Gosh, something smells so good.

1007
01:11:23,696 --> 01:11:25,239
It wafts into your rooms, right?

1008
01:11:25,322 --> 01:11:26,991
Yes. Is it someone's birthday today?

1009
01:11:27,074 --> 01:11:28,993
It's not. I made this for Ju-kyung.

1010
01:11:29,076 --> 01:11:31,203
She hasn't eaten properly for days now.

1011
01:11:33,330 --> 01:11:37,084
I see Ju-kyung's favorite dish, bulgogi!

1012
01:11:38,794 --> 01:11:40,254
Stir-fried glass noodles too!

1013
01:11:40,337 --> 01:11:43,382
I guess Mom made
all of Ju-kyung's favorite dishes!

1014
01:11:49,555 --> 01:11:50,723
Hey, Lim Ju-bal…

1015
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:55,978
Ju-kyung. Come down and have breakfast.

1016
01:11:58,147 --> 01:11:59,106
Ju-kyung?

1017
01:12:00,816 --> 01:12:02,484
Lim Ju-bal, why are you not…

1018
01:12:02,985 --> 01:12:04,028
answering?

1019
01:12:05,696 --> 01:12:06,530
What?

1020
01:12:07,114 --> 01:12:07,990
When did she leave?

1021
01:12:24,214 --> 01:12:25,632
-It's insane.
-What?

1022
01:12:40,981 --> 01:12:42,816
-What?
-Why did she come like that?

1023
01:12:56,413 --> 01:12:58,457
She came here without makeup on?

1024
01:12:58,540 --> 01:12:59,625
She has no makeup on?

1025
01:13:12,137 --> 01:13:13,305
Hey, look.

1026
01:13:18,102 --> 01:13:19,103
She sure is confident.

1027
01:13:20,270 --> 01:13:22,106
-Is that really Ju-kyung?
-It's Ju-kyung.

1028
01:13:31,448 --> 01:13:32,658
-Is that Ju-kyung?
-No way.

1029
01:13:33,367 --> 01:13:35,369
-What?
-It's her. Look.

1030
01:13:49,341 --> 01:13:51,301
-Hi, Ju-kyung.
-Are you all right?

1031
01:13:51,385 --> 01:13:52,803
Yes.

1032
01:13:52,886 --> 01:13:54,930
Ju-kyung, you're seriously so cool.

1033
01:13:55,013 --> 01:13:56,890
You really are a strong woman.

1034
01:14:00,310 --> 01:14:01,520
Hey, Su-ah!

1035
01:14:02,980 --> 01:14:05,107
Su-ah!

1036
01:14:05,190 --> 01:14:06,150
Where are you going?

1037
01:14:06,233 --> 01:14:07,401
Choi Su-ah!

1038
01:14:08,277 --> 01:14:09,570
Su-ah!

1039
01:14:09,653 --> 01:14:12,114
Su-ah!

1040
01:14:19,663 --> 01:14:22,291
Hey, I heard Lim Ju-kyung
came to school without makeup on.

1041
01:14:22,916 --> 01:14:24,084
She's so full of herself.

1042
01:14:24,168 --> 01:14:26,170
Do you really think
she's dating Lee Soo-ho?

1043
01:14:26,253 --> 01:14:28,839
I saw her face earlier
and it was worse than the pictures.

1044
01:14:28,922 --> 01:14:30,924
-Right.
-They would've broken up by now.

1045
01:14:31,008 --> 01:14:33,010
How could he date her
after seeing that face?

1046
01:14:33,093 --> 01:14:34,553
Isn't he also lame lately?

1047
01:14:34,636 --> 01:14:36,013
His dad is a has-been.

1048
01:14:36,096 --> 01:14:38,682
I guess he's just out of his mind
and dating anyone now.

1049
01:14:38,765 --> 01:14:40,601
-Gosh, that was harsh.
-What?

1050
01:14:40,684 --> 01:14:42,478
-Let's go.
-Sure, let's!

1051
01:14:43,770 --> 01:14:46,190
-Hey, what's that?
-Hey.

1052
01:15:00,537 --> 01:15:01,455
Hey, you!

1053
01:15:03,582 --> 01:15:04,750
Take back what you just said.

1054
01:15:05,417 --> 01:15:06,919
-Who is she?
-Who is this?

1055
01:15:07,711 --> 01:15:08,670
Lim Ju-kyung?

1056
01:15:09,254 --> 01:15:12,132
Hey, are you crazy,
going around without makeup on?

1057
01:15:12,216 --> 01:15:13,634
You're not taking it back?

1058
01:15:13,717 --> 01:15:16,094
Yes. I'm dating Lee Soo-ho.

1059
01:15:16,678 --> 01:15:18,514
Lee Soo-ho is my boyfriend!

1060
01:15:19,556 --> 01:15:22,226
Happy? Did that satisfy your curiosity?

1061
01:15:22,309 --> 01:15:24,228
-She must have gone crazy.
-Right?

1062
01:15:25,187 --> 01:15:28,607
He doesn't judge people by their looks,

1063
01:15:28,690 --> 01:15:31,360
and he likes me for who I am,
no matter what I look like.

1064
01:15:31,443 --> 01:15:34,154
He's a way better person
than you mean and awful people.

1065
01:15:34,238 --> 01:15:37,115
So don't talk behind his back
and put him down for dating me.

1066
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:38,992
Say it all straight to my face!

1067
01:15:39,076 --> 01:15:40,702
I'll take you all down. Got it?

1068
01:15:40,786 --> 01:15:42,871
-That was brilliant.
-So courageous!

1069
01:15:43,664 --> 01:15:45,916
And if you have time
to judge others' looks,

1070
01:15:45,999 --> 01:15:47,584
try studying instead!

1071
01:15:47,668 --> 01:15:49,670
Do you know who comes after King Sejong?

1072
01:15:49,753 --> 01:15:51,797
-You don't, do you?
-Is it Shin Saimdang?

1073
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:53,966
So ignorant. Step aside!

1074
01:16:54,943 --> 01:16:56,945
THANK YOU TO LEE HAN-WI
FOR HIS SPECIAL APPEARANCE

1075
01:17:20,344 --> 01:17:21,470
EPILOGUE

1076
01:17:21,553 --> 01:17:23,472
Hey, I'm hungry.

1077
01:17:23,555 --> 01:17:26,350
Hey, then do you want to go
get some tteokbokki?

1078
01:17:26,433 --> 01:17:27,517
-Sure.
-Sounds great.

1079
01:17:28,268 --> 01:17:29,227
Excuse me.

1080
01:17:31,813 --> 01:17:33,523
Can I join you?

1081
01:17:33,607 --> 01:17:36,443
What? You're not our friend.

1082
01:17:37,611 --> 01:17:38,528
What's with her?

1083
01:17:38,612 --> 01:17:39,821
-Right?
-Right?

1084
01:17:39,905 --> 01:17:41,365
Let's go.

1085
01:17:47,913 --> 01:17:53,210
PRINCE COMICS

1086
01:17:53,293 --> 01:17:54,795
Are you crying?

1087
01:17:59,716 --> 01:18:02,761
Did the book scare you that much?

1088
01:18:04,721 --> 01:18:06,598
It's okay. Don't cry.

1089
01:18:07,140 --> 01:18:08,517
This isn't scary at…

1090
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:10,519
Squirrel.

1091
01:18:10,602 --> 01:18:12,312
I'm a squirrel.

1092
01:18:13,438 --> 01:18:14,606
Seriously, you're not going to…

1093
01:18:14,690 --> 01:18:19,778
Meow.

1094
01:18:21,655 --> 01:18:22,698
You finally smiled.

1095
01:18:22,781 --> 01:18:25,659
Squirrel. I'm a squirrel.

1096
01:18:26,243 --> 01:18:27,703
Did you know?

1097
01:18:27,786 --> 01:18:30,872
You'll grow butt hair
if you cry and then smile!

1098
01:18:31,873 --> 01:18:35,585
Squirrel. I'm a squirrel.

1099
01:18:51,017 --> 01:18:53,770
I'm only going to listen
to the people who love me.

1100
01:18:53,854 --> 01:18:56,481
I'm not going to run or hide anymore.

1101
01:18:57,816 --> 01:19:00,193
Ju-kyung, did you get to check
the anonymous forum?

1102
01:19:00,277 --> 01:19:02,821
How is Kang Su-jin going to
show her face at school?

1103
01:19:03,405 --> 01:19:04,614
Can I tell Ju-kyung

1104
01:19:05,282 --> 01:19:06,908
how I feel about her?

1105
01:19:06,992 --> 01:19:07,868
Tell her how you feel?

1106
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:11,121
Lim Ju-kyung!

1107
01:19:11,663 --> 01:19:13,707
Why didn't you answer my calls yesterday?

1108
01:19:14,499 --> 01:19:15,625
Hey, Lee Soo-ho!

1109
01:19:15,709 --> 01:19:16,918
Where are you going?

1110
01:19:17,002 --> 01:19:18,378
Why are you running away?

1111
01:19:18,462 --> 01:19:20,464
We should break up.

1112
01:19:20,964 --> 01:19:25,427
