1
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:05,040
 True Beauty 

2
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:19,990


3
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:32,270
 True Beauty 

4
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:48,340
 I, Im Ju Gyeong, am a goddess. 

5
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:54,950
 But... only before I remove my makeup. 

6
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:09,750
  Facial recognition failed 

7
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,520
Phone? It's me. Can you not tell?

8
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:22,610
  Facial recognition failed 

9
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:27,160
This jerk, Im Ju Yeong, messed with my phone!

10
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:30,800
 Yeah. Living with two faces is extremely exhausting, 

11
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:34,960
  and it's continuously humiliating. 

12
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:40,110
  Facial recognition success 

13
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:57,220
 Episode 2 

14
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,670
This is it.

15
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:02,830
There is no other place with more horror books than here.

16
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:09,220
Where is it?

17
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:13,480
Oh! I found it!

18
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,330
I got here first.

19
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:31,960
I grabbed it first.

20
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:47,320
 You are the Devil 

21
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,800
 Lee Su Ho? 

22
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:57,610
You...

23
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:59,630
Who?

24
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:06,080
I'm sorry.

25
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,640
Excuse me.

26
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:10,510
 Did he recognize me? 

27
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:19,010
That book... I grabbed it first ... Ma'am.

28
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:27,200
Oh. Then, please look at it first.

29
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,160
Here.

30
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,170
Ju Bal, eat some ramen.

31
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:34,130
What? I never ordered it.

32
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,710
It's on me since we've met after such a long time.

33
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:40,060
Next time. I'll eat it next time.

34
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:44,320
I got organic eggs put in here. It was â‚©700 per egg.

35
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,790
I'm going to be sad if you don't eat it.

36
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:48,530
Can't you just eat it yourself?

37
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:50,760
I'm on a diet.

38
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:59,150
Yeah, let's just eat quickly and go.

39
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,540
That's mine.

40
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:20,460
I'm sorry.

41
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:24,490
You must like red ginseng juice. I'll buy you a new one.

42
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:26,320
No need.

43
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,360
You can look over it first.

44
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,660
No. I'm okay.

45
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:34,510
After you flew over my body to snatch it?

46
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:36,490
Quickly look at it.

47
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,780
 You are the Devil 

48
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:14,780
 He really didn't recognize me. 

49
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:22,960
Do you... live around here?

50
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:29,400
I'm not trying to get information about you, but your visuals are very noticeable to the eyes.

51
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,620
I haven't seen you around this neighborhood.

52
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:36,990
If you haven't seen me around even though I have a unique appearance, that probably means I don't live in this neighborhood.

53
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,830
Then why did you have to crawl out all the way here...

54
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:42,870
What do you mean crawl?

55
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:46,010
I've been able to walk upright since I was 11 months old.

56
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:48,990
Oh, I see.

57
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:51,860
- I'm 18. 
 - What?

58
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:55,930
You seem my age. The honorifics are bothering me a bit.

59
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,680
How old are you?

60
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:05,510
I'm 15. Middle school, second year.

61
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:09,610
You don't look younger than me, old lady.

62
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:12,800
It's a joke. I'm 25. A lot older than you, right?

63
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,960
We must be the same age.

64
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,000
 No one would doubt that you're first place at school. 

65
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,990
Wow, I'm full. This is fun. Here you go, have fun reading it.

66
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:31,580
- Already? 
 - I'm a master of speed.

67
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:33,930
I'm talking about this.

68
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:37,990
Especially eating. Bye now.

69
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:49,870
  Prince Comics 

70
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:57,270
I came like this!

71
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:02,020
Why did I meet Lee Su Ho of all people here like this?

72
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,500
How dare you treat your sweet younger brother like this?

73
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:19,800
Hey, what about the comic book?

74
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,900
I don't know! Seriously, because of you, I almost...

75
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:28,630
Why? Did you go to the comic store bare faced and then meet a handsome guy from your class?

76
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:30,490
Well, I mean, this isn't even a drama.

77
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:33,040
How could something so coincidental like that happen?

78
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:40,900
Wow, are you for real? Hey, I don't even have to release the photos for your goddess life to end.

79
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:43,590
It's not like that. He didn't recognize my bare face.

80
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:46,770
Today, he was unsure. But, tomorrow, if he happens to see you...

81
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:48,740
"You're the pimply girl from the comic store!"

82
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:51,610
- He might do that, you never know! 
 - What?

83
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:54,640
W-would he really? What should I do then?

84
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,260
This is why a person should be honest.

85
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:57,960
Noona, that whole goddess thing is a scam.

86
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,830
Just be open about it confidently.

87
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:03,110
How long do you think you'll be able to hide that face?

88
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:08,120
- Hey, Im Ju Yeong. 
 - Yeah?

89
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,800
- You said you were flirting with someone at your academy, right? 
 - Yeah, why?

90
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,390
She's freaking pretty.

91
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:18,140
I'm sure her bare face is the same as mine.

92
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:22,030
Hey, no, it's not!  Even her breath is fragrant!

93
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:48,160
How could we meet here?

94
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:52,890
But why did she ignore me? After going through all of that?

95
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:58,660
She didn't leave a drop of soup. Our Ju Bal eats so well.

96
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:01,900
- Her name is Ju Bal? 
 - You don't know Pandora's daughter, Ju Bal?

97
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:06,360
You've also come here for a long time. Did you never see her back then?

98
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:11,590
Why? Are you interested in her?

99
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:13,320
No, I'm not.

100
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:26,110
 Yesterday, I was lucky. 

101
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:31,950
 But no one knows if that luck will extend to today. 

102
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:36,910
 Only with a perfect disguise will I survive. 

103
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:50,630
I need a bit more paring down.

104
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:17,040
Good thing I saw you! Take me to school.

105
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,100
Hey, you still haven't gone to school yet? You were late again because of makeup, huh?

106
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:23,960
- No! Please, hurry! 
 - I'm taking my kid sister.

107
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,890
Why do you look so happy looking at someone else's husband?

108
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:36,700
If you want him, take him.

109
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:39,100
What a joke.

110
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:43,070
I feel this every time I look at him.

111
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:45,740
He is worth the price of admission.

112
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:49,400
Please, if I had to pay a price, I don't have such a wish.

113
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:53,130
He's just a person. Not worth a damn.

114
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,740
Look at him.

115
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:02,040
Looks like I'll have medicine expenses.

116
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,430
- What's wrong, Dad? 
 - Have a good trip, my daughters.

117
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:08,400
Drive safely!

118
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,050
You! Study hard and don't sleep.

119
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:13,390
- Okay. 
 - Pandora.

120
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:17,740
Besides Hui Gyeong and Ju Gyeong, did you have another daughter who is that pretty?

121
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:21,620
Disguise, success!

122
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:37,700
Nowadays don't you get caught being madeup like that?

123
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:41,230
Back in my day, even if I just put on bb cream, I'd get called out.

124
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:44,800
That "back in my day."  If you use that phrase, you're going to be called a boomer.

125
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,170
What boomer? I'm cool.

126
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:49,180
And I don't like lattes!   (T/N: 'back in my day' sounds like 'latte' in Korean.) 

127
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:51,260
Even if I freeze to death, Iced Americano.

128
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:53,600
I got it. I'm going. Thank you, Unni!

129
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,270
- Work hard! 
 - Okay!

130
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:26,850
Oh... Hi!

131
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:32,300
What a relief. He didn't recognize me.

132
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,960
Su Jin!

133
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,350
- Delete it. 
 - W-What?

134
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:44,720
Delete it before I throw this.

135
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:49,230
I'll delete it. I will, so give it back.

136
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,670
What a scary guy.

137
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:54,790
If you get on his bad side, you're dead that day, right?

138
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:57,700
Didn't they know that he hates getting pictures of him taken?

139
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:01,290
But his temper is really something else.

140
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:03,250
Let's go.

141
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:09,040
Hello, can I get a cup of latteâ€”

142
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,030
No, an iced Americano, please. Even if I freeze to death, iced Americano.

143
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:14,020
Got it.

144
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:26,190
- Why aren't you going? 
 - I don't want to.

145
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:29,880
- All your friends left, but you won't? 
 - No, I want to stay with you, Mom.

146
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,430
You have to go. You shouldn't stay here like this.

147
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:34,670
Tada! Hi!

148
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:42,150
â™«   Through the endless daydreams, I saw you on the way back   â™«

149
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:49,480
â™«   There I walked with you in my arms   â™«

150
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:52,990
â™«   Through the blurry darkness    â™«

151
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:56,740
Come here! 
 â™«   Who's veiling on the twilight   â™«

152
00:13:56,740 --> 00:14:04,090
â™«   We've been far away from my fears   â™«

153
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:11,690
â™«   Somewhere else I'll see you, our days be like a blossom   â™«

154
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:19,020
â™«   Blooming all around you so bright   â™«

155
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:26,390
â™«   By and by I'll miss you and your laugh like a sunshine   â™«

156
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:31,640
â™«   Fading into shadow of tears   â™«

157
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:35,120
Your iced Americano is here!

158
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,320
Would you like a coupon stamp?

159
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:43,240
Yes, please. I think I'll come here often.

160
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:51,180
Can I have the strongest cover-up cushion?

161
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:55,920
- You can look at this first, and I'll get you the strongest cover-up. 
 - Yes, please.

162
00:14:56,830 --> 00:15:00,400
- Look at this. 
 - This looks so pretty.

163
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:32,320
 - It didn't wash off! 
 - So ugly! 

164
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,600
  Oh, what are we to do with your face and all of this?  

165
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,070
  Are you okay?  

166
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:40,760
  Just a joke! A joke.  

167
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:43,600
  - How funny. 
 - It's funny?  

168
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,580
 What are we to do with this nut? 

169
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,930
I'll show you the product.

170
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:48,490
  Safety first 

171
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:52,190
Hey, stop where you are!

172
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:58,300
Han Seo Jun!

173
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,980
Stop right there!

174
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:11,000
Hurry!

175
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:34,510
Excuse me, are you okay?

176
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,220
What should I do?

177
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:40,180
Are you not hurt?

178
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:51,990
Hey! Stop right where you are!

179
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:59,300
- Stop right there! Han Seo Jun! Hey! 
 - Hurry and catch him!

180
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,950
Catch him right now!

181
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:10,630
Hey! Hey! Stop right there!

182
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:22,480
Hey! Han Seo Jun! Stop!

183
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,980
Hurry, hurry.

184
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:32,060
Hey, hurry!

185
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:34,540
Stop right there!

186
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:39,200
Hey! Hey!

187
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,930
Hey! Stop right there!

188
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:54,190
What are you running for?

189
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:58,070
Come here.

190
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,950
Are you okay?

191
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:04,520
Catch him right there!

192
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:17,800
Han Seo Jun. Kim Cho Rong said you went to study abroad.

193
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,490
Did you think we'd believe that?

194
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:22,670
I'm sorry, you bastard.

195
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,710
Oh, this lunatic.

196
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:28,750
Hey, when I think about how, because of you,

197
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,510
I have no money left, I just...

198
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:33,530
Hey.

199
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,250
You didn't come out that day intentionally to backstab us, right?

200
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:41,490
Did you think we wouldn't do anything if you ignored and avoided us?

201
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:43,980
Don't hit the face.

202
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:50,220
Yes, you avoided it.

203
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:52,290
Okay, you're dead today.

204
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:54,340
Hey, the cops are here.

205
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:56,620
Let's go quickly!

206
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,320
We'll meet again, Han Seo Jun.

207
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,750
Let's go.

208
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:17,960
Are they gone?

209
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:27,510
What's with you?

210
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:30,950
Uh, about that...

211
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:35,310
Oh, there!

212
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:37,980
What are you doing?

213
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:03,790
What are you looking at?

214
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:07,400
Run...

215
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:12,760
Oh, oh, bye!

216
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:15,050
Saebom High School?

217
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:21,500
Wait, my helmet! Hey!

218
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:38,990
I almost got entangled with gangsters after trying to avoid Kim Se Mi.

219
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:45,870
What's this? Why did I take this with me?

220
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:47,840
What if he followed me to get it?

221
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,780
It's you! The pimply girl from the comic store!

222
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:54,300
- It's not me.  
 - Hey, Im Ju Bal. Were you scared?

223
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:57,890
Im Ju Yeong, do you want to die?!

224
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:03,610
Hey, come here! You!

225
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:05,880
- It's loud. 
 - It's better you die with me.

226
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:08,000
Be quiet, you guys!

227
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,570
- Ju Heon is on. 
 - Hey, if you hit me with that, it's attempted murder.

228
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:12,120
Ju Heon my ass.

229
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,030
- You little... 
 - You're heavy, you pig!

230
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:16,620
Hey, you! Come here right now!

231
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:20,290
   
 It's been seven years. 

232
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:24,030
Hui Gyeong is so lucky.

233
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:27,430
She's so lucky to work under a handsome boss.

234
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:30,030
Handsome, yeah right.

235
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:34,060
  How does it feel to return to filming a drama after seven years? 

236
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:39,780
 While I was abroad all those years, I couldn't take care of my son very well. 

237
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:43,910
  From now on, I want to spend more time with him. 

238
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:45,990
  I'm not the best dad. 

239
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,990
Son! It's hard to see you just once.

240
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:58,960
This place is the same as always.

241
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,220
When I was body-building,

242
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:03,830
I came here so often as if I lived here.

243
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:05,770
Director Choi is good to you, right?

244
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:07,970
Why are you back all of a sudden?

245
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:14,190
There was a lot to do at work, and I've gotten busier after the companies merged.

246
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:17,550
I thought I'd be forgotten if I only worked overseas.

247
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:20,020
You're very thorough at managing your fans.

248
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:26,020
Su Ho, I was afraid I'd be forgotten by you.

249
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:29,890
You're leaving already?

250
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:34,910
I want to loosen up my muscles. I haven't done it in so long.

251
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,550
You can do that and go.

252
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:45,060
You can't be knocked down so easily!

253
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:04,960
Wow, it looks like you learned properly.

254
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:15,490
Oh no.

255
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:22,190
Wow, you're a real man now.

256
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:25,340
I must've aged now.

257
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:30,400
I'm not a match for you anymore.

258
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:34,690
It's your birthday tomorrow. Do you want to go somewhere fancy to eat?

259
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:36,820
No.

260
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:38,870
Is there anything you want?

261
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:40,870
No.

262
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:46,880
Did you think about moving back in to my house?

263
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,530
I told you I don't want to.

264
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:50,820
When you become a seniorâ€”

265
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:55,550
Wouldn't you feel uncomfortable living with me?

266
00:25:56,650 --> 00:25:58,930
You have to go on dates.

267
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:03,010
Don't just come without notice from now on.

268
00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:06,330
I don't want to be known as Lee Ju Heon's son.

269
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:26,680
No...

270
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:55,190
 Which one is better for my Hoon's 100th day of dating present? 

271
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:56,100
 I like the left one. 

272
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,720
 100 days? You were so excited I thought it was the 100 years anniversary. 

273
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,710
 I was excited for my own 100th day celebration. 

274
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:01,880
  Hang in there, Kang Su. 

275
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:04,400
 Friends, I like you guys so much. 

276
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,280
 I'm happy to have a goddess friend like you. 

277
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,830
 What goddess? 

278
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:09,920
 If I'm a goddess, you're a fairy. 

279
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:13,760
 Im Ju, how can you be so pretty AND so kind? 

280
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,950
What goddess?

281
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:22,320
I'm getting an allergic reaction from makeup. What is this?

282
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,710
This won't do. I've got to do this so I'll have better makeup.

283
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:33,330
Hey, return this. The Prince guy said to do it immediately.

284
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:35,060
When did you rent one?

285
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:36,840
Hey! Why do I have to return it?

286
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:39,380
I haven't deleted your bare face pic.

287
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:41,500
I just want to- Whack!

288
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:44,440
If Lee Su Ho saw it,

289
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:48,090
"Delete it! Delete it before I throw this!"

290
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:51,390
I'm borrowing these. The rest are yours to keep.

291
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:55,340
Present for you.

292
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,230
Sir.

293
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:04,760
Hey, Ju Bal, you're here.

294
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:07,410
- Shh.
 - Was Lee Su Ho here today?

295
00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:08,450
Who?

296
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:12,650
That indifferent, chic, tiny-faced, jumped-out-of-comics guy.

297
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:14,720
Me?

298
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,530
That guy who likes red ginseng juice.

299
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:18,810
Oh him. He doesn't come often on the weekends.

300
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:22,740
Really? That's a relief. This is for return.

301
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:27,020
- Ju Bal.
 - Yes?

302
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:29,190
- Do you have some time?
 - For what?

303
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:34,760
I have a situation, so can you take care of the store?

304
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:37,740
Sir, what if there's a customer?

305
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:40,180
Gosh.

306
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:49,840
That book is still here?

307
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:53,240
 Curse in the Dark 

308
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,870
Wow.

309
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:00,300
I used to collect these when I was little.

310
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:02,500
No one took it.

311
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:05,970
This is for my pay.

312
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:09,780
We meet again.

313
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:17,400
Dang!

314
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:23,350
Why aren't you coming down?

315
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:25,290
I'm looking for a book.

316
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:31,010
Then can you get that book over there?

317
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,410
- This? 
 - Next to that.

318
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:40,290
- This one?
 - Move a little more.

319
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:43,980
- This one? 
 - How much longer are you going to pretend?

320
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:46,690
I know you know me.

321
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,580
Thanks, Ju Bal.

322
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:27,470
You always jump on me every time you see me. It's become a habit.

323
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:29,720
You have to keep your balance when you're up there.

324
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,950
You have zero athletic ability,

325
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:36,750
People with no athletic ability should be forever banned from using step stools.

326
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:38,860
You surprised me by acting like you knew me.

327
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:41,140
My acting is not good enough to keep pretending to not know you.

328
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:46,360
Then did you recognize me when you saw me here last time?

329
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,990
I'm blessed with an exceptional memory.

330
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:51,070
Is being able to recognize a matter of a good memory?

331
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:53,460
Does he have hawk vision or what?

332
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,310
It's obvious it's you. What do you mean?

333
00:30:58,310 --> 00:31:00,250
That face and this face are totally different.

334
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:01,560
Are you finding hidden pictures?

335
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:04,590
I mean it's a different picture.

336
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,770
Oh, eyes are different.

337
00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:15,340
Eyes?

338
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:21,430
Right, the eyes are the most different.

339
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:23,860
Am I wrong to recognize you?

340
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:26,010
No, you aren't.

341
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:29,830
I just can't believe the reality.

342
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,620
Are you going to tell?

343
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:35,320
- Tell what? 
 - That I'm like this.

344
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,560
You're like what?

345
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:41,470
You saw me so you know that I'm messed up.

346
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:45,520
If people know, I won't be able to walk around with my head up.

347
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:48,720
 Is she talking about that time she tried to jump off from the  rooftop? 

348
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,360
Why would you be like that?

349
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:52,420
It's like that for me.

350
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:56,540
Please, can I ask you to ignore it?

351
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:03,960
Please.
  But this is Lee Su Ho, the sociopath. 

352
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,000
Fine.

353
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,040
Yeah, of course you won'tâ€”

354
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:13,970
What? Really? So easily?

355
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:17,390
You think I'm free enough to just walk around talking about you?

356
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:20,020
Not really...

357
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,200
But how can I trust you?

358
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,260
What would you do if you don't trust me?

359
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:33,090
 Confidentiality Agreement 

360
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,010
Do you really have to go this far?

361
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:38,590
That's how desperate I am.

362
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:40,410
Sign here.

363
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:43,110
I don't feel like it.

364
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:46,160
You say you're desperate yet you copied everything from 'The Hell Duty'.

365
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:48,990
I was  rushing it...

366
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:51,220
You know 'The Hell Duty'?

367
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:53,550
That's the classic of classics. Not a lot of people know about it.

368
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:54,710
How could I not know?

369
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:57,500
Pictures that are not tacky even after 30 years,

370
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:01,140
the first in the nation to graft occult horror and sci-fi. It's the best of the 20th century.

371
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:04,440
Wow, it's fascinating to meet someone who knows about it.

372
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,760
But rather than 'The Hell Duty', I like the author's previous piece...

373
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,700
- 'The Cursed Mask!' 
 - 'The Cursed Mask!'

374
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:10,700
- Awesome! 
- You know 'The Cursed Mask'?

375
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:14,580
That's what got me into horror comics. I have a signed copy of the first edition.

376
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:16,190
You have that?

377
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:20,260
Yes. Why?

378
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:25,110
I've been looking for two years to find the first edition of  'The Cursed Mask'

379
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:28,030
and you have one?

380
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:31,500
I've been a long time fan in the horror division.

381
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:32,940
How much would you accept?

382
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:34,710
I don't feel like it.

383
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:39,610
You say you're desperate, yet you're trying to resolve it with money?

384
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:43,920
 Party B: Lee Su Ho 

385
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,630
Good? What more do you want?

386
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:51,810
 He's totally different from school. 

387
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:54,010
 Isn't he unexpectedly a little heodang ( a clumsy and sloppy person )? 

388
00:33:57,170 --> 00:33:59,460
I'm kind of thirsty.

389
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:18,750
I feel a little empty.

390
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:21,800
- So what? 
 - Are you desperate?

391
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:27,250
 I shouldn't have done that back then. 

392
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:39,080
 Im Ju Gyeong's spot. 
 Sitting without permission will cause hair to grow on your butt! 

393
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:42,210
- You wouldn't dare to do this to me at school. 
 - Huh?

394
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:45,630
You said you'd hand over 'The Cursed Mask' with two bowls of ramyun.

395
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:48,740
No, I'll hand it over with one bowl.

396
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:53,180
- This is my bribe to you.
 - A bribe?

397
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:57,060
It's for you to keep the secret well.  Go ahead and eat.

398
00:34:57,750 --> 00:35:02,810
 Eating ramyeon in a comic store with Lee Su Ho. My friends would be so surprised. 

399
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:13,530
I was wondering why there were ramyun soup spots whenever I rented comics.

400
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:18,850
Hey, you know how good ramyun is at a comic store? You'll regret not eating one.

401
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:23,750
Do you not want to see 'The Cursed Mask'?

402
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:35,450
How is it? Isn't it good?

403
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:39,190
It's good considering it's the first meal of my birthday.

404
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:42,980
It's your birthday? Today?

405
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:46,630
Then what are you doing here?

406
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:54,700
Do you like looking at people eat?

407
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:02,700
Hey, don't breathe it in.

408
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:05,340
Don't look.

409
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,040
What do I do?

410
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,240
- Take it out.
 - Take it out?

411
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,500
- No, breathe it in.
 - Ew.

412
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:14,930
My nose hurts.

413
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:25,890
I'll bring 'The Cursed Mask' on Monday for sure.

414
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:27,450
Okay.

415
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:31,780
- Here. 
 - Another  bribe?

416
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:33,970
No, it's a present.

417
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,700
This is a 20-year-old rare item.

418
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:41,130
I found it but will grant it especially to you.

419
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:44,910
You're a friend I shared my secret with.

420
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:47,050
Of course I have to take good care of you.

421
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,770
Happy birthday.

422
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:26,570
  Happy birthday. 

423
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:02,640
It got cleaned up very well.

424
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:07,090
  The Cursed Mask 

425
00:38:07,090 --> 00:38:10,380
  Thanks for keeping my bare face a secret! 

426
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:24,420
This face looks so different from my natural one.

427
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:27,210
How did Lee Su Ho know?

428
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:29,190
So strange.

429
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,910
Please stop, bus driver!

430
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:38,510
Hold on a second!

431
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,000
Thank you!

432
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:53,630
A goddess descended.

433
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:55,770
Wow, for real.

434
00:38:56,830 --> 00:38:59,020
I'm glad I took the bus.

435
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:00,130
Hi.

436
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:01,850
Wow, she's no joke.

437
00:39:01,850 --> 00:39:03,620
Goddess.

438
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:57,050
- Give me the phone. 
 - Who are you?

439
00:39:57,050 --> 00:39:59,560
You pervert, I saw you taking a picture!

440
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:01,180
Ju Gyeong, report him to the police right now.

441
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:02,950
What?

442
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:05,080
Move aside.

443
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,940
That bastard... Hey!

444
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:08,740
Su Jin!

445
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:10,420
Stop where you are!

446
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:13,220
Stop while I'm being nice!

447
00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:21,590
Hey! Are you not going to stop right there?

448
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:37,370
Stop right there, I said!

449
00:40:57,650 --> 00:40:59,250
Take this pervert away.

450
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:02,990
- You'll see it in his phone. 
 - Let go!

451
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:08,000
I scanned my bus card earlier.

452
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,100
You were shocked, right?

453
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:12,930
Yeah. You were so cool.

454
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:16,290
No, I'm asking if you are okay.

455
00:41:16,290 --> 00:41:20,220
Su Jin, I wish I had a boyfriend like you.

456
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:22,410
What are you saying?

457
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:27,320
I'm not even surprised. She even taught middle schoolers who were smoking a lesson last time.

458
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:29,650
She's a total girl crush.

459
00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:31,020
What are you saying?

460
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:34,120
I was so shocked this morning when I couldn't button my skirt this morning.

461
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:37,120
Gosh, why can't they change our skirts to have elastic waistbands?

462
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:39,810
Oh, right, Im Ju. What did your uniform look like before?

463
00:41:39,810 --> 00:41:41,980
I'm curious. Do you have a picture?

464
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:45,560
Oh, that.   I never took a picture.

465
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:47,800
What a lie. Your uniform sucked, huh?

466
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:50,250
Let me see!

467
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:51,890
Well...

468
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:55,500
- Well... 
 - Move.

469
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:58,360
Move, I said.

470
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:03,290
  Thanks to you, I survived just now. 

471
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:05,020
Lee Su Ho, you should talk nicer.

472
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:06,990
- Anyway... 
 - Ddu Ah, Ddu Ah, Ddu Ah.

473
00:42:06,990 --> 00:42:08,520
Honey!

474
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:11,010
A motorcycle! A motorcycle!

475
00:42:18,350 --> 00:42:20,210
What the?

476
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:33,470
He's...

477
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:40,950
He's from our school?

478
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:43,480
  How can there be such an unbelievable coincidence? 

479
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:45,800
- Han Seo Jun is back. 
 - Why is he here?

480
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,620
Why's he here?

481
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:48,940
Han Seo Jun?

482
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:51,750
Like how there are the Bermuda Triangle in the Atlantic and black holes in the universe,

483
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:57,490
there are two charming boys at our school, whom if you fall for once, you can never exit and get out.

484
00:43:05,690 --> 00:43:06,570
What to do?

485
00:43:06,570 --> 00:43:08,460
Oh, what do we do?

486
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:11,600
This is crazy!

487
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:13,860
Oh my god!

488
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:16,150
What do I do?

489
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:36,180
The chic, cold beauty God Lee Su Ho, and the rough, wild horse God Seo Jun.

490
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:39,960
Just like deciding between jjajangmeyon ( black bean noodles ) vs. jjampong ( spicy seafood noodles ) and pizza vs. chicken

491
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:43,770
is so mindblowingly hard, they're the two gods at Saebom High School. The two top ones!

492
00:43:43,770 --> 00:43:45,670
The space and time cringed.

493
00:43:45,670 --> 00:43:47,250
Then, honey, what about me?

494
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:51,080
Our Hoon, you're my top one!

495
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:53,800
Forget the top two nonsense, I hate them both.

496
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,760
I almost barfed.

497
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:06,900
Han Seo Jun returned!

498
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:09,510
They'll get into a fight again.

499
00:44:09,510 --> 00:44:12,920
- It's already so loud. 
 - I love it!

500
00:44:18,590 --> 00:44:21,760
What's with them? They don't get along well?

501
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:24,250
They used to be best friends, but they somehow fell apart.

502
00:44:24,250 --> 00:44:27,820
When they meet, the atmosphere gets so cold.

503
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:33,770
So annoying.

504
00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:41,360
- Hello! 
 - Hello.

505
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:43,230
Hello!

506
00:44:43,230 --> 00:44:45,390
Hello.

507
00:44:45,390 --> 00:44:49,330
- Alright, Seo Jun is back now. Good to see him, right? 
 - Yes.

508
00:44:49,330 --> 00:44:51,980
Let's give him a round of applause.

509
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:56,250
Bravo.

510
00:44:56,250 --> 00:44:59,420
Seo Jun, just sit next to Su Ho.

511
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:01,160
What?

512
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,770
You go.

513
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:16,190
- Me? 
 - This was originally my spot.

514
00:45:16,190 --> 00:45:21,250
Oh, Ju Gyeong has weak eyes, so she's sitting there.

515
00:45:21,250 --> 00:45:24,920
Tae Hoon. Our handsome Tae Hoon, can you switch spots?

516
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:26,540
Me?

517
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:31,030
Really? Yes.

518
00:45:31,030 --> 00:45:33,810
Bros! My friends!

519
00:45:35,490 --> 00:45:38,430
Yes, Tae Hoon, nice one!

520
00:45:38,430 --> 00:45:40,790
Teacher!

521
00:45:42,350 --> 00:45:45,210
- Sorry. 
 - Should we start now?

522
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:47,430
Yes.

523
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:50,900
To have a friend

524
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:53,720
is to have another life.

525
00:45:54,510 --> 00:45:55,370
What is it, Mr. Han?

526
00:45:55,370 --> 00:45:56,690
He started it again.

527
00:45:56,690 --> 00:45:58,010
I want you guys to...

528
00:45:58,010 --> 00:45:59,390
I've seen her before.

529
00:45:59,390 --> 00:46:00,660
have a more prosperous life.

530
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:02,750
Teacher, that's cringey.

531
00:46:02,750 --> 00:46:04,690
Teacher, call 119, please.

532
00:46:04,690 --> 00:46:06,630
My hands and feet won't straighten out from how cringey that was.

533
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:09,390
- Hyeon Gyu, I have medicine. 
 - Medicine?

534
00:46:09,390 --> 00:46:10,990
What kind?

535
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:14,630
They straightened out.

536
00:46:14,630 --> 00:46:16,760
Fighting!

537
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:34,250
Lee Su Ho, what are you thinking about?

538
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:37,770
The English teacher wants you to come to the staff room really quickly. Let's go.

539
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:45,140
Hey, are Su Jin and Lee Su Ho close?

540
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:49,020
Yeah, they're pretty close. Their families have known each other since they were young.

541
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:52,720
The only girl Lee Su Ho has actually talked to is our Su Jin.

542
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:53,740
Oh, really?

543
00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:57,340
  If he's close with Su Jin, then he must be nice. 

544
00:46:57,340 --> 00:47:00,300
The smart kids always hang out together.

545
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:03,890
They're even handsome and beautiful.

546
00:47:03,890 --> 00:47:05,490
They're so inhuman.

547
00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:08,490
Honey, that's why I'm adjusting my grades.

548
00:47:08,490 --> 00:47:10,960
Because I would be too inhuman otherwise.

549
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:16,000
Your smile makes my guts break dance which then gives me a stomach problem.

550
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:21,760
Han Seo Jun.

551
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:24,760
If you returned, you should've shown your face and said hi.

552
00:47:34,530 --> 00:47:38,820
Hey, brother. Today's such great weather for you to die.  (T/N: a famous quote from movie "New World") 

553
00:47:38,820 --> 00:47:41,260
Are you guys a girl group or something?

554
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:43,760
Why are you standing there like that?

555
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,520
Why? Are you going to hit us?

556
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:48,180
Okay, come in. Come here!  (T/N: another famous quote from movie "New World") 

557
00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:50,110
Kim Cho Rong!

558
00:47:52,170 --> 00:47:55,180
Your joke was a bit too much.  (T/N: another famous impersonation of Lee Jung Jae from movie "New World") 

559
00:47:57,490 --> 00:47:59,630
Han Seo Jun!

560
00:47:59,630 --> 00:48:02,080
Hey, great acting for a trainee.

561
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:03,700
This is so childish.

562
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:05,590
How much longer do I have to play around?

563
00:48:05,590 --> 00:48:07,520
Hey, brother!

564
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:10,240
It's honestly fun, you know?

565
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:13,960
- Have you guys been well? 
 - Yeah.

566
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:17,360
Kim Cho Rong, I think you gained more weight.

567
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:19,400
Did you bulk up?

568
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:20,680
I lost 10 kilograms!

569
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:22,030
I see the muscles.

570
00:48:22,030 --> 00:48:24,560
- Is your mother better? 
 - Yeah.

571
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:26,320
She's a lot better.

572
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:29,330
What a relief. I'm sorry I couldn't make a munsang   (T/N: condolence call on a mourner). 

573
00:48:29,330 --> 00:48:32,280
Hey, what do you mean by munsang, you fool?

574
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:34,790
It should be munbyeong   (T/N: visiting a sick person). 

575
00:48:34,790 --> 00:48:37,520
- Hey, hey, hey. 
 - Smart!

576
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:38,990
Then what's munsang?

577
00:48:38,990 --> 00:48:41,190
A gift certificate.

578
00:48:42,330 --> 00:48:44,430
It's refreshing.

579
00:48:44,430 --> 00:48:45,760
It's refreshing.

580
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:50,310
Han Seo Jun is a bit scary.

581
00:48:50,310 --> 00:48:53,800
He's got that bad boy style.

582
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:57,390
There's a terrible rumor that he beat a student

583
00:48:57,390 --> 00:49:00,500
until he was nearly half-alive, so that's why he took a break from school.

584
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:03,160
- Really? 
 - Yeah.

585
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:05,250
  How do I give his helmet back? 

586
00:49:05,250 --> 00:49:07,130
  Gosh, I keep getting myself into terrible situations. 

587
00:49:07,130 --> 00:49:10,060
What are you saying? They say he took a break from school because of things going on at home.

588
00:49:10,060 --> 00:49:12,430
You don't know about that.

589
00:49:15,630 --> 00:49:18,360
- Is that her? The goddess student? 
 - Yeah.

590
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:19,990
She's so pretty, right?

591
00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:21,900
That's amazing. She looks pretty eating, too.

592
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:24,430
Their class is so lucky.

593
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:37,250
Hey, hey, hey. Look at her.

594
00:49:37,250 --> 00:49:39,970
- They say she's the goddess-like transfer student of the second year. 
 - She really is a goddess.

595
00:49:41,730 --> 00:49:44,870
What a scam.

596
00:49:53,340 --> 00:49:56,600
- What's this? 
 - You like this.

597
00:50:00,060 --> 00:50:01,820
Can't believe this.

598
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:12,910
Come to the rooftop.

599
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:20,460
She's crazy.

600
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:34,240
You came?

601
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:38,150
What are you? An attention seeker?

602
00:50:38,150 --> 00:50:41,680
Hey, nobody is here. You can relax.

603
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:44,730
I washed your uniform, and the thing that I told you I'd giveâ€”

604
00:50:44,730 --> 00:50:47,050
- Or do you like me? 
 - No!

605
00:50:47,050 --> 00:50:49,230
Then why are you pretending to be close to me when we've never met?

606
00:50:49,230 --> 00:50:52,890
We... met before. Why are you like this suddenly?

607
00:50:52,890 --> 00:50:55,360
I don't care what you imagine by yourself,

608
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:57,000
but you should properly differentiate what's reality.

609
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,870
Don't make someone who isn't doing anything angry.

610
00:51:03,370 --> 00:51:08,720
Excuse me. Then have you really never seen me outside before?

611
00:51:09,550 --> 00:51:12,570
It seems you want to grab my attention by doing this.

612
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:16,040
But if you ever touch me as you please...

613
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:17,970
I won't stand still.

614
00:51:21,370 --> 00:51:25,580
What? Then at the comic store...

615
00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:28,250
He didn't recognize my bare face?

616
00:51:28,250 --> 00:51:29,600
  The Cursed Mask 

617
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:32,720
  Thanks for keeping my bare face a secret! 

618
00:51:37,460 --> 00:51:40,430
No! No!

619
00:51:47,090 --> 00:51:50,280
 You wouldn't dare to do this to me at school. 

620
00:51:51,050 --> 00:51:54,120
Why did I act up for no reason, seriously!

621
00:51:57,870 --> 00:52:01,570
Excuse me! Wait!

622
00:52:01,570 --> 00:52:03,810
Excuse me. Wait.

623
00:52:04,620 --> 00:52:08,790
This... I brought the wrong thing, so let go.

624
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:13,300
It can't be ripped.

625
00:52:17,730 --> 00:52:19,820
These are sanitary pads.

626
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:26,890
I'll give it to you again tomorrow.

627
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:38,240
But what exactly is the secret Lee Su Ho is saying he'll keep?

628
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:40,580
Has he seen me before?

629
00:52:40,580 --> 00:52:41,990
Oh, I don't know!

630
00:52:41,990 --> 00:52:44,470
Oh, what should I do?

631
00:52:45,010 --> 00:52:47,760
And I acted up so much to him like that.

632
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:50,700
It'll be the end if I get caught, right?

633
00:52:56,410 --> 00:52:59,650
You all researched about the poets we talked about last time, right?

634
00:52:59,650 --> 00:53:00,690
Yes!

635
00:53:00,690 --> 00:53:03,240
It's a group project, so discuss it and make a presentation.

636
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:05,480
Okay!

637
00:53:06,910 --> 00:53:09,030
Hey, Han Seo Jun.

638
00:53:09,030 --> 00:53:10,700
Do you know how to do a PPT?

639
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:12,190
Oh, fitting?

640
00:53:12,190 --> 00:53:14,250
Of course.

641
00:53:15,540 --> 00:53:18,360
I used to be a fitting model, you know.

642
00:53:20,810 --> 00:53:22,350
Okay.

643
00:53:25,770 --> 00:53:29,010
-  I'm screwed.  
 - What are you doing?

644
00:53:34,810 --> 00:53:37,310
- It came. 
 - It came?

645
00:53:38,030 --> 00:53:40,500
How about we research about resistance poets?

646
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:44,320
It's easy to find information, but it feels like other groups will pick that too.

647
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:47,330
- And I don't feel we're smart enough. 
 - Hey, hey, hey!

648
00:53:47,330 --> 00:53:51,470
Did you forget that the school's number one, God Su Ho, is in our group?

649
00:53:52,310 --> 00:53:54,970
Ju Gyeong, what do you think?

650
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:59,470
"Oh, the animal that's saddened by the long neck."

651
00:53:59,470 --> 00:54:01,180
"Always rather gentle."  (T/N: a quote from the poem 'Deer' by No Cheon Myeong)  "

652
00:54:01,180 --> 00:54:03,920
The silent Ju Gyeong, are you sleeping?

653
00:54:06,570 --> 00:54:09,540
- No. 
 - That's a relief.

654
00:54:22,970 --> 00:54:26,480
Let's go, you jerk! Yeah, that's right!

655
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:29,270
Kill him! That's right!

656
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:32,430
Go, go, go!

657
00:54:32,430 --> 00:54:34,910
You're at it again.

658
00:54:38,590 --> 00:54:41,480
You came? Hey, at your school,

659
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:45,950
is there a teacher that is exactly a 7:3 ratio of Jung Woo Sung and Brad Pitt?

660
00:54:45,950 --> 00:54:47,430
No.

661
00:54:47,430 --> 00:54:50,160
Think well. He went inside your school.

662
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:52,630
Even if I think about it well, there's none.

663
00:54:52,630 --> 00:54:54,430
Is he not a teacher then?

664
00:54:54,430 --> 00:54:57,520
Did something happen? You look defeated.

665
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:59,560
Just...

666
00:55:00,070 --> 00:55:03,180
Life is hard.

667
00:55:03,180 --> 00:55:06,740
What even? You 18-year-old.

668
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:09,600
What about being 18?

669
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:11,430
Is 18 years not even a life?

670
00:55:11,430 --> 00:55:14,570
Did you not have 18 years? Is 28 years any better?!

671
00:55:14,570 --> 00:55:17,040
Come here. Come here, you brat!

672
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:19,280
You're not coming, you brat?

673
00:55:34,990 --> 00:55:37,310
Hello?

674
00:55:37,310 --> 00:55:39,130
 It's me. 

675
00:55:39,130 --> 00:55:40,900
Who?

676
00:55:44,450 --> 00:55:46,410
How do you know my phone number?

677
00:55:46,410 --> 00:55:49,320
- I found out. 
 - Why?

678
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:52,800
You said you had something for me. Bring it out to me.

679
00:55:54,190 --> 00:55:57,880
S-something to give to you?

680
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:06,270
What would that be?

681
00:56:06,270 --> 00:56:08,260
Are you joking?

682
00:56:08,260 --> 00:56:11,250
I'll text you the address.

683
00:56:11,250 --> 00:56:12,830
Right now?

684
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,280
I'm not feeling well.

685
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:20,050
Can't I give it to you tomorrow?

686
00:56:20,050 --> 00:56:23,090
Then I'll come over to you, so give me your address.

687
00:56:23,090 --> 00:56:26,520
No! I'll go! I should go.

688
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:28,450
Come by 9 pm.

689
00:56:32,010 --> 00:56:35,090
  Saebeom Park Cafe, 9 pm  

690
00:56:37,630 --> 00:56:40,290
But Lee Su Ho...

691
00:56:40,290 --> 00:56:42,650
Who are you calling?

692
00:56:43,420 --> 00:56:47,050
Bare face Im Ju Gyeong or makeup Im Ju Gyeong?

693
00:56:52,990 --> 00:56:56,820
What is he saying for me to bring?

694
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:05,230
Okay. He said to throw away the uniform, so there's no need for me to bring this out.

695
00:57:05,230 --> 00:57:07,490
It's probably the comic book!

696
00:57:07,490 --> 00:57:11,260
But it would be easier to get my number from the school kids...

697
00:57:12,250 --> 00:57:14,390
Then is it the uniform?

698
00:57:18,170 --> 00:57:20,390
 You were Im Ju Gyeong? 

699
00:57:21,110 --> 00:57:23,020
 You dare to trick me? 

700
00:57:26,130 --> 00:57:28,860
 You were the pimple girl from the comic store? 

701
00:57:30,460 --> 00:57:32,420
 You dare to trick me? 

702
00:57:34,230 --> 00:57:35,940
 You... 

703
00:57:37,690 --> 00:57:39,330
 You...! 

704
00:57:45,460 --> 00:57:48,820
 Why? Do you have a problem? 

705
00:57:48,820 --> 00:57:50,420
 Psycho. 

706
00:57:54,290 --> 00:57:57,390
What is he saying I should do?!

707
00:58:13,250 --> 00:58:16,340
Unni!  Unni!

708
00:58:17,180 --> 00:58:19,300
Where did she go?

709
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:23,720
Hey, Im Ju Yeong.

710
00:58:24,630 --> 00:58:27,290
What's with your face? So freaking funny.

711
00:58:27,290 --> 00:58:30,940
- You're not busy right now, right? Listen to my request. 
 - A favor?

712
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:33,770
If you just do this one favor, I'll be your comic book shuttle forever.

713
00:58:33,770 --> 00:58:37,150
No, I'll be your younger sibling. Please.

714
00:58:37,150 --> 00:58:39,760
Yeah? That's a rather tempting offer.

715
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:42,190
Thank you, Oppa. My request isâ€”

716
00:58:42,190 --> 00:58:45,740
But what should I do? This oppa has an appointment.

717
00:58:45,740 --> 00:58:47,610
I'll listen to your request next time.

718
00:58:47,610 --> 00:58:51,040
Oppa, is an appointment more important than me?

719
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:53,110
You're saying something that's obvious.

720
00:58:53,110 --> 00:58:55,300
Let go. Let go!

721
00:58:55,300 --> 00:58:57,350
I'm not wearing it.

722
00:58:57,350 --> 00:58:59,230
What do I do?

723
00:59:38,730 --> 00:59:41,940
- I'm not late, right? 
 - What's with the helmet?

724
00:59:41,940 --> 00:59:43,560
Doesn't everyone use this when they ride a bike?

725
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:47,690
My face will be all shredded if I fall the wrong way. It's as dangerous as a motorcycle.

726
00:59:47,690 --> 00:59:51,460
You said you weren't well. So why the dangerous bike?

727
00:59:52,650 --> 00:59:54,420
My body isn't well,

728
00:59:54,420 --> 00:59:57,230
but I rode it to quickly give you this so I can rest at home.

729
00:59:58,270 --> 00:59:59,980
Then give it to me quickly.

730
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:04,300
Where is it?

731
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:06,000
I wonder where it is~

732
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:09,020
Is it that hard to find it in there?

733
01:00:11,170 --> 01:00:13,260
- The comic book. 
 - The comic book!

734
01:00:13,260 --> 01:00:15,170
Give it to me.

735
01:00:15,170 --> 01:00:18,510
It was the comic book!

736
01:00:18,510 --> 01:00:21,930
You know this is a very generous offer? You got to know that. Then good bye.

737
01:00:21,930 --> 01:00:25,290
I ordered a warm drink. Drink it before you go.

738
01:00:25,290 --> 01:00:27,250
No, it's okay. I don't have to drink it.

739
01:00:27,250 --> 01:00:29,030
Then should I throw it away?

740
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:33,820
It's really okay, though. I wonder why you did this.

741
01:00:33,820 --> 01:00:36,290
You're going to drink this with that on?

742
01:00:36,820 --> 01:00:40,370
- I can drink it with a straw! 
 - Must you? It looks hot.

743
01:00:40,370 --> 01:00:43,230
It's cold sweat. So I can get better.

744
01:00:44,830 --> 01:00:47,130
Everybody is staring.

745
01:00:47,130 --> 01:00:49,280
Then they can stare!

746
01:00:52,870 --> 01:00:55,080
You're a bit weird today.

747
01:00:57,960 --> 01:01:00,270
I'll go to the restroom to take it off and then come back.

748
01:01:21,870 --> 01:01:23,480
What? What is this?

749
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:25,710
Let's get out. Let's get out!

750
01:01:25,710 --> 01:01:27,790
I'm sorry.

751
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:33,560
What's this suffering?

752
01:01:34,430 --> 01:01:37,370
I'm already upset about being ugly...

753
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:48,050
Isn't he so handsome?

754
01:01:48,050 --> 01:01:50,190
Isn't he a celebrity?

755
01:01:59,700 --> 01:02:02,280
I washed my face because I was sweating.

756
01:02:08,210 --> 01:02:11,050
But how did you know my phone number?

757
01:02:11,050 --> 01:02:13,120
Prince Comics.

758
01:02:15,310 --> 01:02:19,340
You must have really wanted to see that to call me out at this time.

759
01:02:19,340 --> 01:02:20,940
Yeah.

760
01:02:22,010 --> 01:02:26,950
But... the secret of mine that you said you'd keep...

761
01:02:26,950 --> 01:02:28,420
There is.

762
01:02:28,420 --> 01:02:33,160
If I asked you again what that secret was, I'd seem like a psycho, right?

763
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:35,100
Probably.

764
01:02:38,650 --> 01:02:41,890
Should we ask each other something we're curious about?

765
01:02:43,480 --> 01:02:46,670
No, let's not.

766
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:23,170
What a relief.

767
01:03:23,170 --> 01:03:25,340
I didn't get caught.

768
01:03:31,270 --> 01:03:35,100
I need to change my phone number.

769
01:03:35,990 --> 01:03:39,230
Thinking about having to avoid him tomorrow

770
01:03:39,230 --> 01:03:41,960
is making me restless.

771
01:04:06,210 --> 01:04:07,860
Ju Gyeong!

772
01:04:15,110 --> 01:04:18,490
Excuse me. Your uniform.

773
01:04:25,390 --> 01:04:26,900
Are you okay?

774
01:04:26,900 --> 01:04:29,210
I'm okay.

775
01:04:29,210 --> 01:04:31,090
What's with her?

776
01:05:05,020 --> 01:05:07,240
Oh, woah!

777
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:16,110
Yes!

778
01:05:16,110 --> 01:05:19,130
Han Seo Jun, out!

779
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:25,470
Hey!

780
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:39,830
You've seen me before, right?

781
01:05:40,660 --> 01:05:42,250
What are you saying?

782
01:05:42,250 --> 01:05:47,140
You ran off with my helmet. Did you not?

783
01:05:47,140 --> 01:05:48,670
Over there!

784
01:05:48,670 --> 01:05:51,500
I didn't fall for that last time either.

785
01:05:53,650 --> 01:05:55,740
- Damn it! 
 - S-S-Sor...

786
01:05:55,740 --> 01:05:58,420
T-t-t-the class president! It was the class president.

787
01:05:58,420 --> 01:06:01,320
I'm sorry. I'll give it back to you tomorrow.

788
01:06:09,790 --> 01:06:13,060
Gosh, seriously. Im Ju, are you okay?

789
01:06:13,060 --> 01:06:14,840
That jerk.

790
01:06:16,990 --> 01:06:18,260
He should have caught her.

791
01:06:18,260 --> 01:06:22,120
 That's right. Even if I'm bleeding, don't pay me any attention. 

792
01:06:22,120 --> 01:06:25,090
 It's better than getting caught. 

793
01:06:25,090 --> 01:06:27,560
What is your boyfriend doing that he's not eating?

794
01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:30,500
He said he's doing the assignment, so he's just going to grab something from the convenience store.

795
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:32,550
Really? Then should we buy him something?

796
01:06:32,550 --> 01:06:34,660
I don't know. He can starve.

797
01:06:34,660 --> 01:06:36,550
What? Did you guys fight again?

798
01:06:36,550 --> 01:06:38,660
We didn't even have the time to fight.

799
01:06:38,660 --> 01:06:41,670
He kept ignoring my calls cause he wanted to sleep early yesterday.

800
01:06:41,670 --> 01:06:46,460
I don't think he knows it's our 100th day. So annoying.

801
01:06:46,460 --> 01:06:48,820
No way, do you think Tae Hoon really forgot about it?

802
01:06:48,820 --> 01:06:51,860
I don't know. If he really did forget, then we're breaking up today.

803
01:06:51,860 --> 01:06:55,330
He's the only boyfriend I've dated for 100 days.

804
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:02,250
  "Tae Hoon and Su Ah's 100 days" 
I love you, Su Ah. 

805
01:07:04,860 --> 01:07:08,090
Do I really have to make a flower path for your girlfriend?

806
01:07:08,090 --> 01:07:09,390
When my life is a poop path?

807
01:07:09,390 --> 01:07:10,920
Poop path, okay. Okay.

808
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:13,670
- You up for a blind date? 
 - B-blind date?

809
01:07:13,670 --> 01:07:15,290
I'll finish this prettily.

810
01:07:15,290 --> 01:07:16,990
Is Su Ah coming?

811
01:07:16,990 --> 01:07:19,460
She's coming.

812
01:07:26,730 --> 01:07:28,890
Oh my god.

813
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:33,370
  Su Ah, who is prettier than Suzy in my eyes. 

814
01:07:33,370 --> 01:07:36,030
 Even when I'm old and wrinkly 

815
01:07:36,030 --> 01:07:38,200
 I'll love you. 

816
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:42,290
â™«  Just thinking about you makes me feel good.  â™«

817
01:07:43,090 --> 01:07:47,010
â™«  This feeling, only you can make me feel like this  â™«

818
01:07:47,010 --> 01:07:52,410
â™«  I want to feel this way until I die. If you stay by my side, I'll cherish you.  â™«

819
01:07:52,410 --> 01:07:53,990
â™«  I'll cherish you.  â™«

820
01:07:53,990 --> 01:07:58,490
I like you, everything about you.

821
01:07:58,490 --> 01:08:02,370
â™«  From your head to your toes,  â™«

822
01:08:02,370 --> 01:08:05,690
â™«  Every little thing you do.  â™«

823
01:08:05,690 --> 01:08:10,660
Come on, what's this? 
 â™« I like it, I like everything about you â™«

824
01:08:10,660 --> 01:08:13,210
You're so cool!

825
01:08:13,210 --> 01:08:17,420
Su Ah, I'll probably go to hell.

826
01:08:17,420 --> 01:08:19,730
Since I stole you, an angel, from heaven.

827
01:08:19,730 --> 01:08:20,880
Flutter.

828
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:22,370
Flutter, flutter, flutter.

829
01:08:22,370 --> 01:08:25,360
I've embraced you into my heart.

830
01:08:25,360 --> 01:08:28,710
I love you, my angel!

831
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,200
Thank you!

832
01:08:36,710 --> 01:08:39,330
Kiss! Kiss!

833
01:08:39,330 --> 01:08:42,250
Kiss!

834
01:08:42,250 --> 01:08:46,570
It's cringy. Do it in moderation!

835
01:08:57,060 --> 01:08:59,470
Ju Gyeong!

836
01:08:59,470 --> 01:09:01,430
Ju Gyeong.

837
01:09:01,430 --> 01:09:03,480
Oh no! What to do!

838
01:09:03,480 --> 01:09:04,960
I didn't tell you to throw it!

839
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:07,530
You want to die?

840
01:09:07,530 --> 01:09:08,760
What to do? Let's wipe, first.

841
01:09:08,760 --> 01:09:11,220
Will a wet tissue be enough? It looks like you'll need to wash your face.

842
01:09:11,220 --> 01:09:14,130
  If I wash my face, my bare face will be revealed. No. 

843
01:09:14,130 --> 01:09:17,550
Yeah, let's wash your face. Let's go.

844
01:09:17,550 --> 01:09:19,620
Stop!

845
01:09:21,660 --> 01:09:25,840
Nobody touch me.

846
01:09:29,190 --> 01:09:31,320
Ju Gyeong!

847
01:09:51,220 --> 01:09:53,610
Wait.

848
01:10:03,020 --> 01:10:06,120
Move!

849
01:10:14,570 --> 01:10:16,590
What's with her?!

850
01:10:16,590 --> 01:10:19,450
- Im Ju Gyeong? 
 - Ju Gyeong!

851
01:10:26,540 --> 01:10:27,670
Do you have a death wish?

852
01:10:27,670 --> 01:10:29,770
Seriously, what the hell?!

853
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:41,530
You startled me!

854
01:10:41,530 --> 01:10:43,660
I'm sorry!

855
01:10:45,290 --> 01:10:47,860
Ju Gyeong, let's hurry and wipe your face!

856
01:10:50,930 --> 01:10:52,530
Ju Gyeong, are you okay?

857
01:10:52,530 --> 01:10:54,270
She said to not touch her!

858
01:10:54,270 --> 01:10:56,830
Why did you have to throw it?

859
01:10:56,830 --> 01:10:58,590
Gosh.

860
01:10:58,590 --> 01:10:59,780
Sorry, I'm sorry!

861
01:10:59,780 --> 01:11:02,150
Ju Gyeong, let's first wipe your face. I'll wipe for you.

862
01:11:02,150 --> 01:11:03,960
Don't.

863
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:05,560
- Apologize properly. Hurry! 
  - What's going on? 
 - Who is it? 

864
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:06,730
 Isn't she the transfer kid? 

865
01:11:06,730 --> 01:11:08,910
 The one known as the goddess? 

866
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:25,360
 Who? 

867
01:11:26,530 --> 01:11:28,360
 Who are you? 

868
01:11:29,690 --> 01:11:34,500
 Guys, it's me, Ju Gyeong. 

869
01:11:37,810 --> 01:11:40,400
 Im Ju Gyeong, it was you? 

870
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:41,490
 Was it all makeup? 

871
01:11:41,490 --> 01:11:45,590
 Do you not have any shame? You're freaking ugly. 

872
01:11:45,590 --> 01:11:47,020
 What was with the goddess act all this time? 

873
01:11:47,020 --> 01:11:49,760
 Your bare face is freaking ugly. 

874
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:51,960
 What happened to your face? 

875
01:11:51,960 --> 01:11:54,250
 I think I'm going to throw up. 

876
01:12:00,410 --> 01:12:04,400
 - Why are you like this? We're friends. 
 - Friends?! 

877
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:06,920
 If I knew your face looked like this, I wouldn't have befriended you. 

878
01:12:06,920 --> 01:12:08,270
 Can't believe this. 

879
01:12:08,270 --> 01:12:11,230
 Look at those pimples. 

880
01:13:10,990 --> 01:13:13,020
What the?

881
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:22,470
â™«  I'm in the mood for dancing, romancin'  â™«

882
01:13:22,470 --> 01:13:25,810
â™«  Ooh, I'm givin' it all tonight  â™«

883
01:13:25,810 --> 01:13:29,450
â™«  I'm in the mood for chancin'  â™«

884
01:13:29,450 --> 01:13:31,680
â™«  I feel like dancin'  â™«

885
01:13:31,680 --> 01:13:34,750
â™«  Ooh, so come on and hold me tight.  â™«

886
01:13:34,750 --> 01:13:39,060
â™« Ooh, I'm dancin', I'm in the groove, babe  â™«

887
01:13:39,060 --> 01:13:44,080
â™«  So get up and let your body sway.  â™«

888
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:49,940
â™« I'm in the mood for dancin', romancin'  â™«

889
01:13:49,940 --> 01:13:53,230
â™«  You know I shan't ever stop tonight  â™«

890
01:13:53,230 --> 01:13:56,960
â™«  I'm in the mood for chancin'  â™«

891
01:13:56,960 --> 01:13:59,180
â™«  I feel like dancing  â™«

892
01:13:59,180 --> 01:14:02,080
â™«  Ooh from head to my toe  â™«

893
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:03,260
â™«  Take me again.  â™«

894
01:14:03,260 --> 01:14:05,890
 True Beauty 

895
01:14:05,890 --> 01:14:07,420
  Does he really know? 

896
01:14:07,420 --> 01:14:12,670
  There's someone who is similar to you at our school. 

897
01:14:12,670 --> 01:14:14,360
  Why do you keep running away? 

898
01:14:14,360 --> 01:14:15,950
  This is for me to eat? 

899
01:14:15,950 --> 01:14:19,000
  Even though you can postpone studying, dating should not be postponed. 

900
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,140
 Im Ju Gyeong, are you dating Lee Su Ho? 

901
01:14:21,140 --> 01:14:23,790
  Why is he here? 

902
01:14:23,790 --> 01:14:27,760
 - Don't look elsewhere. 
 - You must be happy. 

903
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:31,430
  Our Ju Gyeong is having a hard time because she's pretty. 

904
01:14:31,430 --> 01:14:33,490
  I love you. 

905
01:14:33,490 --> 01:14:38,590
