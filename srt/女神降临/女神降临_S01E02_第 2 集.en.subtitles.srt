1
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:46,504
I'm Lim Ju-kyung.

2
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:48,006
I'm a goddess.

3
00:00:50,633 --> 00:00:51,634
Only until

4
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:54,012
I remove my makeup.

5
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:09,694
AUTHENTICATION FAILED

6
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:12,530
Hey.

7
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:15,241
How come you don't recognize my face?

8
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:21,915
AUTHENTICATION FAILED

9
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:23,291
Damn it.

10
00:01:23,374 --> 00:01:26,252
Ju-young messed with my phone again.

11
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:28,630
It's true.

12
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:30,590
It is tiring and mortifying

13
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:34,344
to live with two different faces.

14
00:01:38,848 --> 00:01:39,682
AUTHENTICATION SUCCESSFUL

15
00:01:58,201 --> 00:01:59,702
This is it.

16
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:02,122
There's no other place
with this many horror comics.

17
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:08,711
Where is it?

18
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:12,799
Found it.

19
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:15,468
YOU ARE THE DEVIL

20
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:29,482
I got here first.

21
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:30,859
I picked it out first.

22
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:54,507
Lee Soo-ho?

23
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:57,135
You're…

24
00:02:57,927 --> 00:02:59,012
Who are…

25
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:05,226
I'm sorry.

26
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:07,186
Hey.

27
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:09,981
Did he recognize me?

28
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:14,110
That book,

29
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:16,154
I grabbed it first.

30
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:18,656
Okay?

31
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:21,492
I see.

32
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:26,205
Then you can go ahead and read it first.

33
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:28,291
Here.

34
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,210
Ju-bal, have some instant noodles.

35
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:32,503
Excuse me?

36
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:34,255
I didn't order one.

37
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:37,175
It's on me to celebrate our reunion.

38
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:39,469
-I'll have it next time.
-Hold on.

39
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:43,181
I put in an organic egg just for you.

40
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:45,767
It's 700 won per egg.
I'd be upset if you didn't eat it.

41
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:48,645
Can't you just have it instead?

42
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:49,938
I'm on a diet.

43
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:56,945
Okay.

44
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:58,905
Let's scarf it down and get out.

45
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:16,965
That's actually mine.

46
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:20,176
I'm sorry.

47
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:24,013
You must like red ginseng juice.
I'll get you a new one.

48
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:25,515
That's all right.

49
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:28,768
Read it if you'd like.

50
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:31,396
No. There's no need for that.

51
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,148
Didn't you just launch yourself
at me to get it?

52
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:36,109
Go on, read it.

53
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:50,540
YOU ARE THE DEVIL

54
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:14,230
I guess he didn't recognize me.

55
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:18,401
Hey.

56
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:22,572
Do you live around here?

57
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:25,908
I mean,

58
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,452
I'm not trying to pry.

59
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:29,746
With your looks,
you're quite the eye-catcher

60
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:32,206
but I don't think
I've seen you around here before.

61
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:35,835
If that's true,
then I must not live around here.

62
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:37,295
Right.

63
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:40,923
Why crawl all the way out here then?

64
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,425
Crawl?

65
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,970
I started walking upright
when I was 11 months old.

66
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:48,181
So you did.

67
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:50,683
I'm 18.

68
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:52,393
Excuse me?

69
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:54,937
You're probably my age.
Your formality irks me.

70
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:58,024
How old are you?

71
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:05,198
I'm 15. I'm an 8th grader.

72
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:08,201
I don't buy that you're younger than me,

73
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:09,619
ma'am.

74
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:13,039
I was just joking.
I'm 25, way older than you.

75
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:14,373
So you're also 18.

76
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:18,503
No wonder he's the top student.

77
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:25,885
Gosh, I'm full.

78
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:27,762
That was interesting.

79
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:29,764
-Here you go. Enjoy.
-So soon?

80
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:32,809
-I read very fast.
-I meant this.

81
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:35,937
It's my specialty.

82
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:37,647
Goodbye then.

83
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,866
PRINCE COMICS

84
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:56,999
What am I wearing?

85
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:01,546
Why did I have to run into him
right then and there?

86
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:14,725
Hey, what's with your attitude?

87
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:19,147
Where's my comic book?

88
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:22,275
I don't know. It's all because of you.

89
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:23,943
What?

90
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:27,864
Did you run into a handsome guy from class
without wearing any makeup?

91
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:32,452
Then again, your life's not a TV show.
I doubt that would happen.

92
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:37,832
Seriously?

93
00:07:37,915 --> 00:07:40,960
Your life as a goddess is over
even if I don't share your picture!

94
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:43,796
That's not it. He didn't recognize me.

95
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,174
He might not today,
but when he sees you tomorrow,

96
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:49,010
"Aren't you that acne girl
from the comics shop?"

97
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:50,720
-That could happen.
-What?

98
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:54,640
Really? Do you think so?
Then what do I do?

99
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:56,392
That's why you have to be honest.

100
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,311
Ju-kyung, you are conning people.

101
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:00,062
Just show them who you are.

102
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:02,523
You can't hide your true face forever.

103
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:05,985
Hey, Lim Ju-young.

104
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:07,820
What?

105
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:11,991
-You know that girl you have a thing with?
-Yes. What about her?

106
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:13,493
She's super pretty.

107
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:16,746
Her face without makeup
won't be too different from mine.

108
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:19,624
No way!

109
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:21,584
Even her breath is fragrant!

110
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:47,777
How did I run into her here?

111
00:08:49,403 --> 00:08:52,198
But how can she ignore me
after all I did for her?

112
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:55,368
Goodness.

113
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:58,412
Ju-bal didn't leave a single drop.

114
00:08:58,955 --> 00:08:59,956
Her name is Ju-bal?

115
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:02,208
You don't know Pandora's daughter Ju-bal?

116
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:05,378
You've been a patron for a while.
You haven't seen her before?

117
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:10,424
Why? Are you interested?

118
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:12,802
No.

119
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:25,606
I was lucky yesterday.

120
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:30,152
But there's no guarantee

121
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:31,445
I'll be lucky today too.

122
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:36,242
A perfect disguise
is my only way to survive.

123
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,505
More contour.

124
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:15,323
Hee-kyung!

125
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:17,283
-What?
-Glad I caught you. Give me a ride.

126
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:20,244
You're still here?
You're late putting makeup on again.

127
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:21,829
That's not it. Please hurry.

128
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:23,122
Where is my little sister?

129
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:26,959
PANDORA SHOP

130
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:35,134
Why are you staring
at my husband like that?

131
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:36,802
You can take him if you want.

132
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:38,387
You've got to be kidding.

133
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:42,642
I think this whenever I see your husband.

134
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,478
He is really good-looking.

135
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:48,898
Please. That doesn't pay the bills.

136
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:52,360
His looks are of no value.

137
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:58,866
Just take a look at that.

138
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:01,243
Now I have to pay for whatever that is.

139
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:05,498
-What's wrong, Dad?
-See you later, girls.

140
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:07,166
Drive safely!

141
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:11,212
And you, study hard.
Don't fall asleep in class.

142
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:12,338
Okay.

143
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:16,175
I didn't know you had another pretty girl
other than Hee-kyung and Ju-kyung.

144
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:17,259
What?

145
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:21,514
My disguise is a success.

146
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:37,780
Don't you get in trouble
for wearing this much makeup?

147
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:41,492
Back in my day,
we couldn't even wear BB cream.

148
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:43,119
"Back in my day."

149
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:46,122
-You'll soon be called a boomer.
-Nonsense.

150
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:47,415
I'm still cool.

151
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:49,417
I drink iced Americanos, not lattes,
even when it's freezing.

152
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,544
That's how cool I am.

153
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:53,754
All right. Thanks, Hee-kyung.

154
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:56,048
-Okay. Have a good day!
-Okay.

155
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:24,660
Well…

156
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:25,995
Hi.

157
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:31,333
Thank goodness. He didn't recognize me.

158
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:32,460
Did you get it?

159
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:35,087
Su-jin!

160
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:41,802
-Delete them.
-What do you mean?

161
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:43,971
Or I'll throw this away.

162
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,223
Okay.

163
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:48,434
I'll delete them, so give it back.

164
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:52,188
He's scary.

165
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:55,274
If he catches anything, it's done.

166
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:57,610
He hates when people take photos of him.

167
00:12:57,693 --> 00:13:01,155
But still, he's truly something else.

168
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:02,865
Let's go.

169
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:08,287
Good morning. Can I please get one latte…

170
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:11,540
Can I please get an iced Americano?

171
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:12,958
-Extra cold.
-Sure.

172
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:25,971
-Why aren't you going?
-I don't want to go.

173
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,098
But all your friends are going.

174
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:30,226
No, I want to be with you, Mom.

175
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:32,853
But you have to. You can't just stay here.

176
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:35,064
Ta-da! Hi!

177
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:54,416
Let's go.

178
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:34,540
Your iced Americano is ready.

179
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:39,461
Would you like a stamp card?

180
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:40,713
Yes, please.

181
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:42,631
It seems like I'll be coming here often.

182
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:51,557
Can I get a foundation
with the highest coverage?

183
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,476
Try this for now.
I'll be back with the highest we have.

184
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,394
Okay.

185
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,771
Hey, look at this.

186
00:14:58,397 --> 00:14:59,815
It's super pretty.

187
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:32,681
-It doesn't wash off.
-The ugliness is still there.

188
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:35,726
What are we going to do about your face?

189
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:37,269
Are you okay?

190
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:39,396
It was just a prank.

191
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:42,900
-That's funny.
-Is it?

192
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:45,694
-What do we do with her?
-I don't know.

193
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:47,154
Seriously.

194
00:15:58,874 --> 00:15:59,917
What was that?

195
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:16,392
Here's the one you were looking for.

196
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:51,218
Stop right there!

197
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,640
Hey, stop!

198
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:59,226
Hey, Han Seo-jun, stop!

199
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,067
Hey!

200
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:09,153
We told you to stop!

201
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:11,739
-Let's move fast.
-He must have gone there.

202
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:33,385
Excuse me, are you okay?

203
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:36,764
Goodness.

204
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:38,432
Are you hurt?

205
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:51,028
-Hey, stop right there!
-Stop!

206
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:54,865
Stop!

207
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:56,450
Han Seo-jun! Hey!

208
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:58,660
-Hurry!
-Get him!

209
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:06,126
Go get him!

210
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,086
-Hey!
-Hurry!

211
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:08,462
-Hey!
-Stop!

212
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:10,172
-Stop right there!
-Hurry!

213
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:20,557
-Hurry!
-Hey, over there!

214
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:21,809
-There!
-Get him!

215
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:22,726
Han Seo-jun!

216
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,103
-Darn it.
-Stop there!

217
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:25,020
Hurry!

218
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:32,903
-Come on!
-Stop right there!

219
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:38,951
-Hey!
-Stop!

220
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:41,578
-Stop!
-Get him!

221
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:42,830
-Hurry up!
-Jeez!

222
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:53,590
Why are you running away?

223
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:57,219
Come over here. Come on.

224
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:00,097
Are you okay?

225
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,890
-Get that punk.
-Get him.

226
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,642
-Get him.
-Hurry!

227
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:13,986
Han Seo-jun.

228
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:16,113
Kim Cho-rong told me
you went to study abroad.

229
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:19,491
You thought we would buy that?

230
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:21,034
I'm sorry, you punk.

231
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:25,497
You crazy punk.

232
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:28,959
I went through so much because of you.

233
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:30,502
I'm still mad thinking about it.

234
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:32,588
Hey.

235
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:36,633
You didn't come out that day
to mess with us, right?

236
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:40,596
You thought we'd leave you alone
if you just avoided us?

237
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:42,973
Not my face.

238
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:49,855
You dodged?

239
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,191
You're dead meat.

240
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:54,443
I think the police are here.

241
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:55,527
Let's go.

242
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:57,654
Let's go.

243
00:19:57,738 --> 00:20:00,157
-Let's go. Come on.
-I'll see you again, Han Seo-jun.

244
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,491
Hey, let's go!

245
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:05,621
Hey, let's go!

246
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,299
Did they leave?

247
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:26,642
Who are you?

248
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:28,727
I…

249
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:30,479
Well…

250
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,399
What is that?

251
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,361
What are you doing?

252
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:39,655
Darn it.

253
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:02,970
What?

254
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:07,057
Thank…

255
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:09,977
you!

256
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:14,231
Saebom High?

257
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:18,986
Wait, my helmet!

258
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:20,779
Hey!

259
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:24,408
Darn it.

260
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:38,714
I almost got involved with the delinquents
trying to avoid Sam-mi.

261
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:42,801
What the…

262
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:45,262
Why did I take this with me?

263
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:47,556
Is he coming after me for this?

264
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:48,890
Hey!

265
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:51,727
-Acne girl from the comics shop?
-No.

266
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,895
Lim Ju-bal, did you get spooked?

267
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:56,148
Ju-young, I'll kill you!

268
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:57,774
Come here!

269
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:00,402
Stop there!

270
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:02,904
-Come here.
-On today's entertainment news…

271
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:06,074
-You're dead meat.
-Hey, kids.

272
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:07,701
Be quiet, you brats.

273
00:22:08,368 --> 00:22:09,494
Ju-hun is on.

274
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:10,871
It's an attempted murder.

275
00:22:10,954 --> 00:22:12,205
Ju-hun, my foot.

276
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:13,999
-You punk.
-You're so heavy, pig!

277
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:15,000
Why you…

278
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:16,293
Come here!

279
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:19,880
It's been seven years
since your last project, Love Maze.

280
00:22:19,963 --> 00:22:22,341
-How have you been?
-Lucky Hee-kyung.

281
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:24,259
After the series and overseas schedule…

282
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:26,762
She gets to work under
a handsome CEO like that.

283
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:29,306
Handsome, my foot.

284
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:33,977
How does it feel to be back
in Korea after seven years?

285
00:22:34,978 --> 00:22:36,897
-I didn't get to see my son much.
-Jeez.

286
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,899
due to being overseas.

287
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:43,320
I plan on spending
more time with my son from now on.

288
00:22:44,237 --> 00:22:46,031
I haven't been a good dad.

289
00:22:50,994 --> 00:22:52,329
Hey, son.

290
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:54,456
It's really hard to catch you.

291
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:59,086
This place is still the same.

292
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:03,131
I basically lived here
back when I was training for a role.

293
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:05,550
Master Choi treats you well, right?

294
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:07,761
Why did you suddenly come back?

295
00:23:07,844 --> 00:23:08,845
Right.

296
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:13,225
I had a lot going on at the company,
especially after the merger.

297
00:23:14,684 --> 00:23:16,603
I'd also lose relevance
if I were away for too long.

298
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:19,064
You care about your fans deeply.

299
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:25,195
It's you that I care about, Soo-ho.

300
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:29,199
You're leaving already?

301
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:34,371
I wanted to do some exercise myself.

302
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:37,791
Go ahead.

303
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,089
That was too easy, don't you think?

304
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:04,484
Someone taught you well.

305
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:18,308
My goodness.

306
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:21,770
You're a grown man now.

307
00:25:22,562 --> 00:25:25,607
Goodness, I must be getting old.

308
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:28,777
I'm not a match for you, am I?

309
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:32,030
It's your birthday tomorrow.

310
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:34,491
Do you want to eat out somewhere nice?

311
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:35,867
No.

312
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:38,620
Is there anything you want?

313
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:40,205
No.

314
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:44,459
Have you thought about…

315
00:25:45,418 --> 00:25:47,254
moving back to my place?

316
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:48,713
I already said no.

317
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:51,216
You'll soon be a senior, and--

318
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:55,220
Wouldn't you also feel uncomfortable
if I lived with you?

319
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:58,181
What about your love life?

320
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:02,143
Don't come by unannounced from now on.

321
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:05,772
I don't want to be known
as Lee Ju-hun's son.

322
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:25,583
No…

323
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:27,252
No…

324
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:55,280
Which one's better
for a 100th-day anniversary gift?

325
00:26:55,363 --> 00:26:56,406
The one on the left.

326
00:26:56,489 --> 00:26:58,992
Only 100 days? You fussed so much
I thought it was 100 years.

327
00:26:59,075 --> 00:27:01,161
I made a huge fuss
when I was 100 days old too.

328
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:02,203
Bear with me, Kangsu.

329
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:04,247
Guys, I'm so glad we're friends.

330
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:06,499
I'm glad to have
a goddess friend like you.

331
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:10,253
I'm not a goddess.
If I'm a goddess, you are a fairy.

332
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:13,340
Limju, how are you both pretty and sweet?

333
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:18,803
Goddess, my foot.

334
00:27:19,387 --> 00:27:21,639
My skin's getting worse because of makeup.

335
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:25,935
I need to do something to calm it down.

336
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:33,818
Hey, return this.
Mr. Prince said he needs it right away.

337
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:35,320
When did he borrow it?

338
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:37,155
Why would I return it?

339
00:27:37,238 --> 00:27:39,032
I still have your pictures.

340
00:27:39,866 --> 00:27:40,700
That punk.

341
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,370
If I were Lee Soo-ho,

342
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:45,830
"Delete them."

343
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:48,375
"Or I'll throw this away."

344
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:50,668
I'm borrowing these. Keep the change.

345
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:54,172
This is for you.

346
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:02,222
Hey.

347
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:04,724
Hey, Ju-bal.

348
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:08,561
-Lee Soo-ho's not here, is he?
-Who?

349
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:12,273
The guy who's aloof and has a tiny face,
like a lead in a romance comic.

350
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:14,818
You mean, me?

351
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:17,028
The guy who likes red ginseng juice.

352
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:19,155
Right. He rarely comes on weekends.

353
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:20,949
Really? Thank goodness.

354
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:22,283
I'm returning this.

355
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:25,745
Ju-bal.

356
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:27,247
Yes?

357
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:29,207
-Do you have a moment?
-Why?

358
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:32,293
My stomach is having a bit of a situation.

359
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:34,254
-Can you take my place for a bit?
-But…

360
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:36,756
What if someone comes?

361
00:28:47,642 --> 00:28:49,269
This series is still here.

362
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:52,605
A CURSE IN DARKNESS

363
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:54,441
Goodness.

364
00:28:58,069 --> 00:28:59,988
I used to collect these.

365
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:01,865
I guess nobody took it.

366
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:05,285
I'll take this for my pay.

367
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:08,788
We meet again.

368
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:17,130
Darn it.

369
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:21,926
Are you not coming down?

370
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:24,554
I'm looking for a book.

371
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:30,143
Then can you get me that book over there?

372
00:29:33,688 --> 00:29:35,690
-This one?
-The one next to it.

373
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:39,068
-This one?
-A bit further.

374
00:29:40,403 --> 00:29:41,571
This one?

375
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:43,156
How long are you going to pretend?

376
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:45,992
You know me.

377
00:30:17,106 --> 00:30:19,067
Thanks, Ju-bal!

378
00:30:24,447 --> 00:30:27,283
You always get in my arms.
It's becoming a habit.

379
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:29,786
You need to learn to keep your balance.

380
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:31,287
It's not that hard.

381
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:36,125
People like you
should be banned from using footstools.

382
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:39,254
What you said caught me off guard.

383
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:41,589
I'm not that good of an actor
to keep pretending.

384
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:42,507
Then…

385
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:46,594
you recognized me right away last time?

386
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:48,221
Fortunately, I have a good memory.

387
00:30:48,304 --> 00:30:50,598
This isn't a matter
of having a good memory.

388
00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:52,642
You must have eagle eyes.

389
00:30:57,355 --> 00:30:58,606
It's you, even at a glance.

390
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,567
My face is totally different.

391
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:04,320
-Are we playing "find the difference"?
-I mean, they are two different faces.

392
00:31:11,786 --> 00:31:13,997
I see. The eyes are different.

393
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:14,914
Eyes?

394
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:20,587
Right. They're the most different.

395
00:31:21,796 --> 00:31:23,631
Am I in the wrong for recognizing you?

396
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:25,675
No, it's not that.

397
00:31:27,343 --> 00:31:29,470
I just can't believe this is happening.

398
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:32,473
Are you going to tell people?

399
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:35,310
-Tell people what?
-That I'm like this?

400
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:36,686
What are you like?

401
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:38,897
You see what I look like right now.

402
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,107
I'm a mess.

403
00:31:41,774 --> 00:31:45,236
If people find out,
I won't be able to show my face.

404
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:48,281
Is she talking about the rooftop incident?

405
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:50,325
Why do you feel that way?

406
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:51,743
I just do.

407
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:56,414
Please, can you just keep it a secret?

408
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:01,002
Please.

409
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:03,796
But it's Lee Soo-ho, the sociopath.

410
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,632
Okay.

411
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:07,133
Okay.

412
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,135
There's no way you'd--

413
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:11,054
What?

414
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:13,723
Really? That easily?

415
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:16,976
Do I seem like the type
to spill the beans on you?

416
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:19,395
No, but…

417
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,944
How do I know you'll keep your word?

418
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,530
So what if you don't?

419
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:33,326
CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT

420
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:35,244
Is this really necessary?

421
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:37,497
This is how desperate I am.

422
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:39,582
Please sign here.

423
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:43,002
I don't think so.

424
00:32:43,586 --> 00:32:46,589
A truly desperate person
wouldn't copy a page from Hell's Pledge.

425
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:47,757
I wrote it in a hurry so--

426
00:32:49,175 --> 00:32:50,385
You know Hell's Pledge?

427
00:32:51,594 --> 00:32:53,513
It's a very old comic.
Not many know of it.

428
00:32:53,596 --> 00:32:55,056
How could I not know?

429
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:57,850
With a modern drawing style
that holds up after 30 years,

430
00:32:57,934 --> 00:33:00,144
it's the first domestic series
to fuse occult horror and SF

431
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:01,562
and the finest of the 20th century.

432
00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:04,774
It feels surreal to finally meet
someone who knows about it.

433
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:07,110
I personally prefer
the author's previous work,

434
00:33:07,193 --> 00:33:08,027
-Cursed Mask.
-Cursed Mask.

435
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:11,114
-Amazing.
-You know Cursed Mask?

436
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:12,949
That's what got me into horror comics.

437
00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:14,742
I even have a signed first edition.

438
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:15,868
You do?

439
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:18,913
Yes.

440
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,415
Why?

441
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:24,335
I've been trying so hard to find
the first edition for two years…

442
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:26,838
and you have it?

443
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:30,842
I've been into horror comics
for a while now.

444
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:32,760
How much?

445
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:34,512
I don't think so.

446
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:39,392
A truly desperate person wouldn't just
throw money at their problems.

447
00:33:42,061 --> 00:33:44,188
LEE SOO-HO

448
00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:48,901
That's done. What else?

449
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:51,195
He's a different person outside of school.

450
00:33:52,238 --> 00:33:53,656
Perhaps a bit gullible too.

451
00:33:57,452 --> 00:33:58,703
I'm parched.

452
00:34:16,512 --> 00:34:18,306
I feel somewhat peckish.

453
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:19,932
So what?

454
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:21,184
Are you desperate?

455
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:26,731
I shouldn't have done that.

456
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:38,826
RESERVED FOR LIM JU-KYUNG.
SIT HERE AND YOU'LL GROW BUTT HAIR.

457
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,328
If you saw me at school,

458
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:42,789
-you wouldn't dare do this to me.
-What?

459
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:45,750
You promised me Cursed Mask
for two bowls of instant noodles.

460
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:48,127
Actually, I'll settle for just one bowl.

461
00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:51,589
This is a bribe from me.

462
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:55,426
-Bribe?
-For keeping my secret.

463
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:57,011
Go ahead, eat.

464
00:34:57,804 --> 00:35:00,640
I'm having instant noodles
with Lee Soo-ho at a comics rental shop.

465
00:35:00,723 --> 00:35:02,683
The whole school would freak out
if they knew.

466
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:13,820
I always wondered why there were
so many splatters on the pages.

467
00:35:13,903 --> 00:35:16,823
Hey, eating instant noodles
at the comic shop is the best.

468
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:18,282
You'll regret it if you don't.

469
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:22,954
Don't you want your Cursed Mask?

470
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:35,716
Isn't it good?

471
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,386
It's good for the first meal
on my birthday.

472
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:42,390
It's your birthday today?

473
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:45,977
Then what are you doing here?

474
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,734
Do you like watching people eat?

475
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:03,161
Hey. Don't sniff it in.

476
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:04,620
Just look away.

477
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:08,875
-What do I do?
-Pull it out.

478
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:10,501
-Pull it?
-No, just sniff it in.

479
00:36:12,795 --> 00:36:14,005
My nose hurts.

480
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:19,802
PRINCE COMICS

481
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:25,683
I'll give you the copy
of Cursed Mask on Monday.

482
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:27,560
-Okay.
-Right.

483
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:32,106
-Here.
-Another bribe?

484
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,441
No, a gift.

485
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:37,904
This is a very rare item
that's 20 years old.

486
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:40,781
I came across it,
but I'm specially giving it to you.

487
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:45,244
You're now my friend
I've shared my secret with,

488
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:46,746
so I should care for you.

489
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:52,251
Happy birthday.

490
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:25,785
Happy birthday.

491
00:37:59,151 --> 00:38:00,278
LEE SOO-HO

492
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:01,821
Spotless.

493
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:06,367
CURSED MASK

494
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:09,954
Thanks for keeping a secret
about my no-makeup face!

495
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:24,093
I look totally different without makeup.

496
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:26,637
How did he recognize me?

497
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:28,931
So strange.

498
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:36,105
Sir, stop the bus!

499
00:38:36,188 --> 00:38:37,732
-Hang on!
-Wait!

500
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:49,410
Thank you.

501
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:53,289
A true beauty is here.

502
00:38:53,372 --> 00:38:55,249
Seriously, what a goddess.

503
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:58,878
-Amazing.
-I'm so glad I stopped the bus.

504
00:38:58,961 --> 00:39:00,212
Hi.

505
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:01,964
She's gorgeous.

506
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:03,257
She looks like a goddess.

507
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:57,311
-Give me your phone.
-What's this?

508
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:59,271
You pervert, I saw you taking pictures!

509
00:39:59,855 --> 00:40:01,816
-Ju-kyung, hurry and call the police.
-What?

510
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:03,526
-Disgusting.
-Damn it.

511
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:06,278
-Get out of my way.
-That punk. Hey!

512
00:40:07,154 --> 00:40:08,280
-Su-jin!
-Hey!

513
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:10,408
Stop right there!

514
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:12,284
Stop or I'll kill you!

515
00:40:18,624 --> 00:40:20,668
Hey, stop!

516
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:36,517
I said, stop!

517
00:40:57,872 --> 00:41:01,041
Arrest this pervert!
You'll find all the evidence on his phone.

518
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:01,959
Okay.

519
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:07,006
I tapped my card earlier.

520
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:09,467
She brought justice!

521
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:10,968
-Were you startled?
-Yes.

522
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:13,137
You were so amazing.

523
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:15,181
I mean, are you okay?

524
00:41:16,765 --> 00:41:19,643
Su-jin, I would love to
have a boyfriend like you.

525
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:21,812
Whatever.

526
00:41:23,522 --> 00:41:25,191
I'm not surprised.

527
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:27,776
She scolded middle schoolers
for smoking last time.

528
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:29,236
She's my girl crush.

529
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,362
Stop it.

530
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:34,533
I was so shocked to see
my skirt not zip up this morning.

531
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:36,952
I'd love a skirt with an elastic band.

532
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,914
Limju, what was your old uniform like?

533
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:41,790
I want to see it. Do you have pictures?

534
00:41:41,874 --> 00:41:42,750
Well…

535
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:45,085
I didn't take any pictures.

536
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:48,047
Don't lie.
Your uniform was ugly, wasn't it?

537
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:49,715
Let me see.

538
00:41:50,257 --> 00:41:51,759
-Well…
-Please?

539
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:54,803
-Well…
-Move.

540
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:57,765
Move.

541
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:03,687
Saved by the bell.

542
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:06,023
-Soo-ho, be nice.
-Typical.

543
00:42:06,106 --> 00:42:07,900
-Hi, Tu-ah.
-Hi, babe!

544
00:42:08,484 --> 00:42:09,735
Watch out. A motorcycle!

545
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:13,072
What the…

546
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:19,787
What was that?

547
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:22,206
-Seriously.
-Goodness.

548
00:42:31,757 --> 00:42:32,633
That guy is…

549
00:42:39,848 --> 00:42:40,891
He's a student here?

550
00:42:41,433 --> 00:42:43,811
What kind of absurd coincidence is this?

551
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:45,187
I guess Han Seo-jun is back.

552
00:42:45,271 --> 00:42:47,147
-Why is he here?
-What's he doing here?

553
00:42:48,148 --> 00:42:49,358
Han Seo-jun?

554
00:42:49,441 --> 00:42:51,777
Like the Bermuda Triangle
or a black hole in space,

555
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:56,532
the charms of these two guys
can suck you right in with no escape.

556
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:08,127
-Goodness!
-Seriously, what do I do?

557
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:11,213
I'll report you for stealing my heart!

558
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:14,091
You're too much for my heart.

559
00:43:14,174 --> 00:43:16,343
-Look!
-Gosh, he's so gorgeous!

560
00:43:20,347 --> 00:43:21,890
-Let's move!
-Hey, we're late!

561
00:43:23,475 --> 00:43:24,435
Seo-jun!

562
00:43:24,518 --> 00:43:25,644
Seo-jun!

563
00:43:33,819 --> 00:43:35,070
Savior Soo-ho, the nonchalant adonis

564
00:43:35,154 --> 00:43:36,488
versus Seo-jun Almighty,
the untamed rebel.

565
00:43:36,572 --> 00:43:38,157
Deciding who's hotter is a conundrum

566
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,451
like donuts versus ice cream
or pizza versus fried chicken.

567
00:43:40,534 --> 00:43:42,620
They're Saebom High's two gods,
the two towers.

568
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:45,789
That was too cringey.

569
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:47,583
Babe, then what about me?

570
00:43:47,666 --> 00:43:50,085
You are the one and only of my heart.

571
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:53,756
I actually don't care for either of them.

572
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:56,050
-I feel sick.
-Want to die?

573
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:06,894
Hey, Han Seo-jun is back.

574
00:44:06,977 --> 00:44:09,271
I guess they're going to fight again.

575
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:10,773
I can sense the ruckus coming.

576
00:44:10,856 --> 00:44:11,940
I don't mind it!

577
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:22,117
By the way, what's going on?
Do they not like each other?

578
00:44:22,201 --> 00:44:24,578
They used to be best friends,
but things went sour.

579
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:26,664
They always go after each other.

580
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:33,420
Not how I want to start my day.

581
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:40,636
Good morning.

582
00:44:40,719 --> 00:44:42,221
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

583
00:44:42,304 --> 00:44:44,306
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

584
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:48,560
So Seo-jun is finally back.
It's nice to see him again, right?

585
00:44:48,644 --> 00:44:49,520
-Yes.
-Yes.

586
00:44:49,603 --> 00:44:51,188
Should we give a warm welcome?

587
00:44:54,566 --> 00:44:56,360
-Welcome back!
-Welcome back!

588
00:44:56,443 --> 00:44:59,488
Seo-jun, you can sit next to Soo-ho.

589
00:44:59,571 --> 00:45:00,406
Excuse me?

590
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:11,041
Hey, you move over there.

591
00:45:13,627 --> 00:45:15,671
-Me?
-This used to be my seat.

592
00:45:16,505 --> 00:45:20,384
She's sitting there
because of her bad eyesight.

593
00:45:20,467 --> 00:45:22,553
Well, Tae-hoon?

594
00:45:22,636 --> 00:45:25,889
-Can you go sit over there, Mr. Handsome?
-Me?

595
00:45:27,433 --> 00:45:28,684
Seriously…

596
00:45:31,437 --> 00:45:33,272
Hey, neighbor!

597
00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:38,235
Yas, Tae-hoon, great job!

598
00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:40,446
-No, please stop.
-Please don't.

599
00:45:42,739 --> 00:45:45,492
-All right, should we start our homeroom?
-Sorry.

600
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:46,743
-Yes!
-Yes!

601
00:45:48,537 --> 00:45:49,705
"To have a friend…

602
00:45:49,788 --> 00:45:51,248
-Not again.
-Come on.

603
00:45:51,331 --> 00:45:53,125
…is like having another life."

604
00:45:53,792 --> 00:45:55,836
-Mr. Han.
-Why do you do this?

605
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:57,004
He's doing it again.

606
00:45:57,087 --> 00:45:59,673
-I want you guys to…
-I know her from somewhere.

607
00:45:59,756 --> 00:46:00,966
have many different lives.

608
00:46:01,049 --> 00:46:02,718
Mr. Han, that's too much.

609
00:46:02,801 --> 00:46:04,970
Please call 911.

610
00:46:05,053 --> 00:46:06,930
My fingers and toes
can't stand how cringey you are.

611
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:08,765
Hyun-kyu, I have a cure for you.

612
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:10,392
A cure? What is it?

613
00:46:12,853 --> 00:46:14,563
Yes, I'm all healed.

614
00:46:14,646 --> 00:46:16,398
-Have a good day, guys!
-Mr. Han!

615
00:46:32,414 --> 00:46:34,333
Soo-ho, what are you thinking about?

616
00:46:34,416 --> 00:46:37,127
The English teacher wants to see you.
Let's go.

617
00:46:42,174 --> 00:46:45,135
Is Su-jin friends with Soo-ho?

618
00:46:45,219 --> 00:46:47,095
Yes, they're pretty close.

619
00:46:47,179 --> 00:46:49,014
They knew each other
since they were little.

620
00:46:49,097 --> 00:46:52,476
Tu-jin might be the only girl
that Soo-ho talks to.

621
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:54,061
I see.

622
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:56,939
He must actually be nice
since he's a friend of Su-jin.

623
00:46:57,731 --> 00:47:00,692
The smart ones
always hang out with each other.

624
00:47:00,776 --> 00:47:02,694
On top of that,
they're super good-looking.

625
00:47:02,778 --> 00:47:03,612
Jeez.

626
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:05,822
So unrelatable.

627
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:08,700
Babe, that's why I keep my grades low.

628
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:10,077
I want to stay relatable.

629
00:47:11,078 --> 00:47:13,580
Your smile is making
all of my organs breakdance.

630
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:15,707
They're making my stomach ache.

631
00:47:19,795 --> 00:47:21,004
Hey, Han Seo-jun.

632
00:47:22,297 --> 00:47:24,508
You should come
pay your respects if you're back.

633
00:47:34,851 --> 00:47:38,230
Hey brother,
it's a perfect day to die, isn't it?

634
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:42,651
Are you all a girl group or something?
Why are you standing like that?

635
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:45,821
What? Are you going to punch me?

636
00:47:45,904 --> 00:47:48,240
All right, come on.

637
00:47:48,323 --> 00:47:49,241
Hey, Kim Cho-rong!

638
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:54,413
This joke has gone too far!

639
00:47:57,457 --> 00:48:00,002
-That was great, Seo-jun!
-A real celebrity!

640
00:48:00,085 --> 00:48:02,087
No wonder you were a trainee.
You're a decent actor.

641
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:03,880
You're so ridiculous.

642
00:48:03,964 --> 00:48:05,882
How long do I have to go along with this?

643
00:48:07,509 --> 00:48:09,928
Honestly, you enjoyed it too, didn't you?

644
00:48:12,306 --> 00:48:13,890
-Have you all been well?
-Yes.

645
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:17,436
Cho-rong, you look
even bigger than before.

646
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:19,396
-Are you trying to get buff?
-Seriously!

647
00:48:19,479 --> 00:48:22,232
-Hey, I've lost 10kg.
-He has muscles.

648
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:24,067
Is your mom doing any better?

649
00:48:24,151 --> 00:48:25,902
Yes, she's doing much better.

650
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:27,404
What a relief.

651
00:48:27,487 --> 00:48:29,031
I offer my condolences.

652
00:48:29,114 --> 00:48:30,198
Seriously?

653
00:48:30,282 --> 00:48:33,285
Condolences are for when someone dies!
You said the wrong word.

654
00:48:33,368 --> 00:48:35,871
-He got you.
-He's smart!

655
00:48:35,954 --> 00:48:37,748
Guys, come on.

656
00:48:37,831 --> 00:48:39,333
Then what was I supposed to say?

657
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:40,417
Consolation.

658
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:43,587
This is refreshing.

659
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:44,755
It's refreshing?

660
00:48:44,838 --> 00:48:45,881
It's refreshing.

661
00:48:45,964 --> 00:48:49,051
By the way, Han Seo-jun seems a bit rough.

662
00:48:49,134 --> 00:48:50,010
Right.

663
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:53,138
He definitely has a bad boy vibe.

664
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:55,265
Rumor has it

665
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:57,434
that it wasn't actually
a leave of absence,

666
00:48:57,517 --> 00:49:00,395
but a disciplinary suspension
for beating a kid to death.

667
00:49:00,937 --> 00:49:02,314
-Seriously?
-Yes.

668
00:49:03,482 --> 00:49:05,442
How do I return his helmet?

669
00:49:05,525 --> 00:49:07,277
This year is really not for me.

670
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:08,612
What are you talking about?

671
00:49:08,695 --> 00:49:10,447
He said he took time off
for family matters.

672
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:11,782
Nobody really knows.

673
00:49:16,161 --> 00:49:18,205
So she's the goddess, the new transfer?

674
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:20,290
-Yes, she's super pretty, right?
-Yes.

675
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:22,209
She looks pretty even when she's eating.

676
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:24,002
Lucky for her classmates.

677
00:49:35,681 --> 00:49:37,391
Hey, look at her.

678
00:49:37,474 --> 00:49:39,518
She's the junior goddess
who transferred here.

679
00:49:39,601 --> 00:49:41,978
-She is a goddess.
-She's pretty.

680
00:49:42,062 --> 00:49:43,814
She's not a goddess. She's a fraud.

681
00:49:51,446 --> 00:49:52,280
RED GINSENG

682
00:49:53,615 --> 00:49:56,076
-What's this?
-I know you like it.

683
00:50:00,288 --> 00:50:01,206
What was that?

684
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:11,800
Meet me on the rooftop.

685
00:50:18,765 --> 00:50:19,975
Has she gone mad?

686
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:33,655
You came.

687
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:38,285
What are you doing?
Are you seeking attention?

688
00:50:38,368 --> 00:50:41,955
Hey, no one's here, so relax.

689
00:50:42,038 --> 00:50:45,208
I got your jacket dry cleaned
and the stuff I promised--

690
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:47,335
-Then do you like me?
-No.

691
00:50:47,419 --> 00:50:49,546
Then why are you acting like we're close?

692
00:50:49,629 --> 00:50:52,883
We saw each other yesterday.
What's wrong with you?

693
00:50:52,966 --> 00:50:55,594
I don't care what's going on in your head,

694
00:50:55,677 --> 00:50:57,220
but see the reality as it is.

695
00:50:57,304 --> 00:50:59,139
You're really getting on my nerves.

696
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:04,644
Wait.

697
00:51:05,604 --> 00:51:08,106
You've never seen me outside of school?

698
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:11,860
Maybe this is your way
of getting my attention,

699
00:51:12,819 --> 00:51:14,738
but if you ever touch me again…

700
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:17,491
I won't let it slide.

701
00:51:21,495 --> 00:51:22,329
What?

702
00:51:22,829 --> 00:51:24,623
So he didn't recognize my face

703
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:27,375
at the comics rental shop?

704
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:32,339
Thanks for keeping a secret
about my no-makeup face!

705
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:38,428
No.

706
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:39,846
No!

707
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:49,564
If you saw me at school,
you wouldn't dare do this to me.

708
00:51:51,316 --> 00:51:53,527
Why did I have to act up?

709
00:51:58,198 --> 00:51:59,282
Hey.

710
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:00,450
Wait!

711
00:52:02,118 --> 00:52:03,161
Hey, wait up.

712
00:52:04,871 --> 00:52:06,832
I brought the wrong thing.

713
00:52:07,332 --> 00:52:08,458
Give it back.

714
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:12,462
I can't let it rip.

715
00:52:17,759 --> 00:52:19,219
There are menstrual pads inside.

716
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:25,892
I'll bring the right one tomorrow.

717
00:52:34,401 --> 00:52:37,612
Wait, then what secret
was he talking about?

718
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:39,990
Has he seen me before?

719
00:52:40,866 --> 00:52:43,785
Whatever. What do I do?

720
00:52:45,245 --> 00:52:47,080
I really messed with him,

721
00:52:48,039 --> 00:52:50,333
so it'll be the end of me
if he actually finds out.

722
00:52:56,506 --> 00:52:59,759
Did you do your research
on the poets from the last class?

723
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:00,927
-Yes.
-Yes.

724
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:03,179
Work on your presentation with your team.

725
00:53:03,263 --> 00:53:04,890
-Yes.
-Yes.

726
00:53:07,183 --> 00:53:08,351
Hey, Han Seo-jun.

727
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:11,730
-Do you know about PPT?
-What, fitting?

728
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:13,607
Of course.

729
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,694
I was a fitting model once.

730
00:53:20,947 --> 00:53:21,781
Sure.

731
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:27,329
I'm done for.

732
00:53:27,412 --> 00:53:28,705
What are you doing?

733
00:53:28,788 --> 00:53:29,623
Hey.

734
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:36,588
-I got it.
-You got it?

735
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:40,926
How about we do our presentation
on resistance poets?

736
00:53:41,009 --> 00:53:43,887
Research would be easy,
but other teams will have the same idea.

737
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:46,306
Plus, do you think
we could actually pull it off?

738
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:47,974
-Hey.
-What?

739
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:51,353
You're forgetting the fact that
we have the top student on our team.

740
00:53:52,687 --> 00:53:54,105
Ju-kyung, what do you think?

741
00:53:56,608 --> 00:53:58,902
"Thou art full of sorrow
with your long neck."

742
00:53:59,778 --> 00:54:01,363
"Always a polite creature,

743
00:54:01,446 --> 00:54:03,823
who seldom speaks."
Are you sleeping, Ju-kyung?

744
00:54:06,826 --> 00:54:09,079
-No.
-I'm glad.

745
00:54:23,301 --> 00:54:25,637
Let's go, punk. That's it.

746
00:54:26,846 --> 00:54:28,723
Take them down! All right.

747
00:54:32,727 --> 00:54:34,437
-She's at it again.
-That little…

748
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:35,981
Hey.

749
00:54:38,858 --> 00:54:39,734
You're home.

750
00:54:39,818 --> 00:54:41,611
Hey, is there a teacher

751
00:54:41,695 --> 00:54:46,116
who looks like a mix of Jung Woo-sung
and Brad Pitt at your school?

752
00:54:46,199 --> 00:54:48,868
-No.
-Come on, think hard.

753
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:50,495
He went into your school building.

754
00:54:50,578 --> 00:54:52,330
I'm thinking, but no.

755
00:54:52,914 --> 00:54:54,082
Maybe he's not a teacher.

756
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:56,668
What's wrong? You're so out of energy.

757
00:54:57,877 --> 00:54:59,004
Just because…

758
00:55:00,505 --> 00:55:02,590
Life is too hard.

759
00:55:03,591 --> 00:55:05,802
You don't know what life is. You're 18.

760
00:55:08,221 --> 00:55:10,974
What about 18?
18-year-olds have lives too.

761
00:55:11,057 --> 00:55:14,561
Weren't you 18 at some point?
Now that you're 28, you know about life?

762
00:55:14,644 --> 00:55:15,729
Come here.

763
00:55:15,812 --> 00:55:17,147
Come here, little brat!

764
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:18,314
I said, come here!

765
00:55:35,331 --> 00:55:36,666
Hello?

766
00:55:37,625 --> 00:55:38,460
It's me.

767
00:55:39,544 --> 00:55:40,503
Who?

768
00:55:44,716 --> 00:55:46,092
How did you get my number?

769
00:55:46,718 --> 00:55:47,719
I have my ways.

770
00:55:48,386 --> 00:55:49,262
What do you want?

771
00:55:49,345 --> 00:55:52,348
You have something for me. Bring it over.

772
00:55:54,392 --> 00:55:55,226
I have…

773
00:55:55,935 --> 00:55:57,395
something for you?

774
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:06,196
What would that be?

775
00:56:06,696 --> 00:56:07,614
Are you kidding me?

776
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:09,783
I'll text you the location.

777
00:56:11,534 --> 00:56:12,535
Right now?

778
00:56:16,247 --> 00:56:17,916
I'm not feeling too well.

779
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:20,043
Can I bring it to you tomorrow?

780
00:56:20,126 --> 00:56:21,961
I'll come to you. What's your address?

781
00:56:23,338 --> 00:56:25,256
No. I'll go there.

782
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:26,424
I should go meet you.

783
00:56:26,508 --> 00:56:27,842
Be there by 9 p.m.

784
00:56:31,971 --> 00:56:34,140
The cafe in front of Saebom Park. 9 p.m.

785
00:56:37,936 --> 00:56:39,562
But Soo-ho,

786
00:56:40,605 --> 00:56:42,023
who did you call just now?

787
00:56:43,691 --> 00:56:45,276
Lim Ju-kyung without makeup

788
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:46,444
or with makeup?

789
00:56:53,284 --> 00:56:56,496
What on earth does he want me to bring?

790
00:57:00,542 --> 00:57:01,376
Right.

791
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:05,296
He told me to throw the jacket away,
so he wouldn't ask me to bring it.

792
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:06,756
It has to be the comic book.

793
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:10,927
But my number would be easier to find
through kids from school.

794
00:57:12,512 --> 00:57:13,763
Is it the jacket?

795
00:57:18,476 --> 00:57:19,769
You're Lim Ju-kyung?

796
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:22,897
How dare you deceive me?

797
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:28,403
You're the acne girl from the comics shop?

798
00:57:30,905 --> 00:57:32,365
How dare you deceive me?

799
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:35,493
You…

800
00:57:38,037 --> 00:57:38,955
You're…

801
00:57:45,795 --> 00:57:47,464
Why? Is there a problem?

802
00:57:49,048 --> 00:57:50,049
You're crazy.

803
00:57:54,596 --> 00:57:57,056
What do you want me to do?

804
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:15,992
Hee-kyung!

805
00:58:17,243 --> 00:58:19,078
Where did she go?

806
00:58:22,373 --> 00:58:23,541
Hey, Lim Ju-young.

807
00:58:24,876 --> 00:58:27,504
What's up with your face? It's ridiculous.

808
00:58:27,587 --> 00:58:29,005
You're not busy, are you?

809
00:58:29,088 --> 00:58:31,090
-Please do me a favor.
-Favor?

810
00:58:31,174 --> 00:58:33,927
Just one favor
and I'll deliver you comics for life.

811
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:35,762
No, I'll be your little sister.

812
00:58:35,845 --> 00:58:36,679
Please?

813
00:58:37,388 --> 00:58:39,724
Really? That's a tempting offer.

814
00:58:39,807 --> 00:58:41,559
Thanks, big brother.

815
00:58:41,643 --> 00:58:42,560
So can you please--

816
00:58:42,644 --> 00:58:45,563
Unfortunately, your big brother
already has plans.

817
00:58:45,647 --> 00:58:47,649
I'll do you a favor some other time.

818
00:58:47,732 --> 00:58:49,025
Big brother.

819
00:58:49,108 --> 00:58:51,361
Is it more important than me?

820
00:58:51,444 --> 00:58:52,737
Are you kidding? Obviously.

821
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:55,365
Let go of me. Jeez.

822
00:58:55,448 --> 00:58:56,824
I don't need it.

823
00:58:57,575 --> 00:58:58,576
What do I do?

824
00:59:39,075 --> 00:59:40,076
I'm not late, am I?

825
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:41,160
What's with the helmet?

826
00:59:42,203 --> 00:59:43,663
We all wear one when riding bicycles.

827
00:59:43,746 --> 00:59:45,331
If you fall, you could faceplant.

828
00:59:45,415 --> 00:59:47,000
It's as risky as a motorcycle.

829
00:59:47,875 --> 00:59:50,587
You said you're not feeling well.
Why did you ride a dangerous bicycle here?

830
00:59:52,964 --> 00:59:54,549
I'm not feeling well,

831
00:59:54,632 --> 00:59:57,176
so I took a bicycle
to make it quick and get some rest.

832
00:59:58,469 --> 00:59:59,887
Then hurry and give it to me.

833
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:02,515
CURSED MASK

834
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:03,516
Where is it?

835
01:00:04,517 --> 01:00:05,977
Where can it be?

836
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:08,146
Is it that hard to find in there?

837
01:00:09,939 --> 01:00:11,482
CURSED MASK

838
01:00:11,566 --> 01:00:13,443
-The comic book.
-The comic book.

839
01:00:13,526 --> 01:00:14,944
Give it to me.

840
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:17,363
Right, it was the comic book then.

841
01:00:18,781 --> 01:00:20,116
You know it's a steal, right?

842
01:00:20,199 --> 01:00:21,993
Keep that in mind, okay? I'm off.

843
01:00:22,076 --> 01:00:23,453
I ordered you something warm.

844
01:00:24,537 --> 01:00:25,538
Have it before you go.

845
01:00:25,622 --> 01:00:27,582
No, I'm all right. I don't need it.

846
01:00:27,665 --> 01:00:28,958
Then should I throw it away?

847
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:32,337
I'm really okay.

848
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:33,713
You really didn't have to.

849
01:00:33,796 --> 01:00:35,298
Are you going to keep that on?

850
01:00:37,216 --> 01:00:39,636
-I can use the straw.
-Why? It looks hot in there.

851
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:42,180
It's cold sweat from getting better.

852
01:00:45,141 --> 01:00:46,142
Everyone's staring.

853
01:00:47,393 --> 01:00:48,728
Let them stare.

854
01:00:53,024 --> 01:00:54,192
You're being weird today.

855
01:00:58,321 --> 01:00:59,947
I'll take it off in the restroom.

856
01:01:23,805 --> 01:01:26,015
-Let's get out.
-Yes, let's go.

857
01:01:26,099 --> 01:01:27,183
I'm sorry.

858
01:01:31,396 --> 01:01:32,980
Why all this trouble?

859
01:01:34,732 --> 01:01:36,818
Isn't being ugly bad enough?

860
01:01:46,369 --> 01:01:47,745
Isn't he so good-looking?

861
01:01:48,538 --> 01:01:49,997
-Maybe he's a celebrity.
-Right?

862
01:02:00,049 --> 01:02:01,718
I washed my face since I was sweaty.

863
01:02:08,516 --> 01:02:10,059
So how did you get my number?

864
01:02:11,310 --> 01:02:12,311
Through Prince Comics.

865
01:02:15,565 --> 01:02:18,609
You must have really wanted that
to ask me to bring it at this hour.

866
01:02:19,527 --> 01:02:20,403
Yes.

867
01:02:22,238 --> 01:02:23,156
By the way,

868
01:02:23,948 --> 01:02:27,034
my secret you promised to keep…

869
01:02:27,118 --> 01:02:28,161
What about it?

870
01:02:28,828 --> 01:02:31,080
If I were to ask you what that was…

871
01:02:31,164 --> 01:02:32,290
that'd mean I'm crazy, right?

872
01:02:33,374 --> 01:02:34,417
Right.

873
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:40,965
Let's take turns
asking each other questions.

874
01:02:43,801 --> 01:02:45,928
No, let's not.

875
01:03:21,589 --> 01:03:24,509
Thank goodness. He didn't figure it out.

876
01:03:31,557 --> 01:03:34,852
Anyway, I have to change my phone number.

877
01:03:36,229 --> 01:03:38,648
I can't fall asleep

878
01:03:39,565 --> 01:03:42,109
thinking about having
to avoid him tomorrow.

879
01:04:06,092 --> 01:04:07,218
Hey, Ju-kyung.

880
01:04:14,433 --> 01:04:17,436
Excuse me, your jacket.

881
01:04:25,194 --> 01:04:27,697
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

882
01:04:29,282 --> 01:04:30,491
What was that?

883
01:04:50,678 --> 01:04:51,554
Gosh!

884
01:04:52,221 --> 01:04:53,222
Su-ah, out!

885
01:04:56,559 --> 01:04:57,894
-Hey!
-What?

886
01:04:57,977 --> 01:05:00,563
-I got it.
-All right!

887
01:05:03,149 --> 01:05:04,734
-What was that?
-Jeez.

888
01:05:15,161 --> 01:05:16,037
Nice!

889
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:18,998
Han Seo-jun, out!

890
01:05:19,665 --> 01:05:21,918
Han Seo-jun, out.

891
01:05:23,544 --> 01:05:24,462
So sneaky.

892
01:05:29,842 --> 01:05:30,676
Hey.

893
01:05:32,970 --> 01:05:34,013
Hey.

894
01:05:35,723 --> 01:05:36,599
Yes?

895
01:05:37,767 --> 01:05:39,101
You've seen me before, right?

896
01:05:40,519 --> 01:05:41,771
I'm not sure what you mean.

897
01:05:42,521 --> 01:05:44,774
You ran off with my helmet.

898
01:05:45,566 --> 01:05:46,609
Didn't you?

899
01:05:47,485 --> 01:05:48,819
Hey, look!

900
01:05:48,903 --> 01:05:51,280
I didn't fall for that last time either.

901
01:05:53,908 --> 01:05:55,952
-What was that?
-I'm sorry.

902
01:05:56,035 --> 01:05:57,870
It was the class president.

903
01:05:58,788 --> 01:06:00,289
Sorry. I'll bring it tomorrow.

904
01:06:10,091 --> 01:06:12,635
Goodness. Limju, are you okay?

905
01:06:12,718 --> 01:06:14,303
That jerk.

906
01:06:17,223 --> 01:06:18,557
He could have helped.

907
01:06:18,641 --> 01:06:19,475
That's it.

908
01:06:19,558 --> 01:06:21,769
Ignore me even if
I'm on the ground bleeding.

909
01:06:21,852 --> 01:06:24,438
-He's such a jerk.
-It's better than my secret getting out.

910
01:06:25,606 --> 01:06:27,316
Why is your boyfriend skipping lunch?

911
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:30,319
He's doing homework,
so he's getting snacks instead.

912
01:06:30,403 --> 01:06:32,738
Really? Should we get him something then?

913
01:06:32,822 --> 01:06:34,865
I don't care if he starves or not.

914
01:06:34,949 --> 01:06:36,826
What is it? Did you two fight again?

915
01:06:36,909 --> 01:06:38,452
We didn't even have time for that.

916
01:06:39,036 --> 01:06:41,914
He's been ignoring my calls and texts
since yesterday evening.

917
01:06:41,998 --> 01:06:44,125
I don't think he knows
it's our 100th-day anniversary.

918
01:06:44,208 --> 01:06:45,876
I'm really annoyed.

919
01:06:46,502 --> 01:06:49,088
I'm sure he wouldn't
have forgotten about it.

920
01:06:49,171 --> 01:06:52,091
If he actually forgot, that's it.
I'm breaking up with him.

921
01:06:52,174 --> 01:06:54,635
He's the only guy I've dated for 100 days.

922
01:06:55,970 --> 01:06:57,054
It's their 100th day.

923
01:06:57,138 --> 01:06:59,098
-Is she on her way?
-What's he doing?

924
01:06:59,181 --> 01:07:01,142
100 DAYS OF TAE-HOON AND SU-AH
I LOVE YOU SU-AH

925
01:07:01,225 --> 01:07:02,893
-Thanks.
-Make sure it looks good.

926
01:07:02,977 --> 01:07:04,895
-All right.
-Hey, fix it here.

927
01:07:04,979 --> 01:07:08,357
Hey, why do I have to make
a flower path for your girlfriend

928
01:07:08,441 --> 01:07:09,734
when mine is full of poop?

929
01:07:09,817 --> 01:07:11,819
I get it. I'll set you up
with someone, okay?

930
01:07:11,902 --> 01:07:12,987
Set me up?

931
01:07:13,904 --> 01:07:15,448
I'll make this path beautiful.

932
01:07:15,531 --> 01:07:16,824
Hey, is Su-ah coming?

933
01:07:17,408 --> 01:07:18,576
Yes, she's coming.

934
01:07:18,659 --> 01:07:20,745
-Hey, get ready.
-Here she comes!

935
01:07:31,213 --> 01:07:33,382
SU-AH, IN MY EYES,
YOU'RE PRETTIER THAN BAE SUZY

936
01:07:33,466 --> 01:07:35,301
EVEN WHEN YOU GET OLD AND WIZENED

937
01:07:37,928 --> 01:07:39,680
I'LL STILL LOVE YOU

938
01:07:54,361 --> 01:07:58,157
I like you
I like everything about you

939
01:08:05,831 --> 01:08:07,333
My goodness.

940
01:08:10,753 --> 01:08:11,962
You're awesome!

941
01:08:13,380 --> 01:08:14,298
Su-ah,

942
01:08:15,508 --> 01:08:17,468
I'll end up in hell

943
01:08:17,551 --> 01:08:19,887
for stealing an angel called Su-ah
from the heavens.

944
01:08:19,970 --> 01:08:21,055
Flutter.

945
01:08:21,138 --> 01:08:22,723
Fluttering.

946
01:08:22,807 --> 01:08:25,559
And keeping you in my heart.

947
01:08:25,643 --> 01:08:27,895
I love you, my angel!

948
01:08:30,523 --> 01:08:31,857
Thank you!

949
01:08:33,943 --> 01:08:36,987
-Kiss!
-Kiss!

950
01:08:37,071 --> 01:08:42,618
-Kiss!
-Kiss!

951
01:08:42,701 --> 01:08:45,663
You guys are too much. Enough is enough!

952
01:08:56,632 --> 01:08:58,008
Goodness, Ju-kyung!

953
01:08:59,176 --> 01:09:00,219
-Oh no, Ju-kyung!
-Oh, no.

954
01:09:00,302 --> 01:09:01,804
Get her some paper towels.

955
01:09:01,887 --> 01:09:03,305
Why did you dodge?

956
01:09:03,389 --> 01:09:06,100
-Why did you throw the cake?
-You punk.

957
01:09:06,183 --> 01:09:07,393
You guys.

958
01:09:07,476 --> 01:09:08,811
Let's wipe some down first.

959
01:09:08,894 --> 01:09:11,230
Wet wipes won't do it.
She'll have to wash her face.

960
01:09:11,313 --> 01:09:13,524
If I wash my face, my true face will show.

961
01:09:13,607 --> 01:09:14,483
No.

962
01:09:14,567 --> 01:09:17,820
-Right. Let's wash your face with water.
-Let's go.

963
01:09:17,903 --> 01:09:19,029
Everyone, stop!

964
01:09:21,991 --> 01:09:25,077
Nobody touch me.

965
01:09:27,121 --> 01:09:28,372
Hey, Ju-kyung.

966
01:09:29,165 --> 01:09:31,083
-Hey.
-Ju-kyung!

967
01:09:32,418 --> 01:09:33,377
It's Han Seo-jun.

968
01:09:51,395 --> 01:09:53,189
Hey, hold on.

969
01:10:03,532 --> 01:10:05,910
Get out of my way!

970
01:10:11,957 --> 01:10:13,334
What the…

971
01:10:14,460 --> 01:10:16,086
What was that?

972
01:10:16,795 --> 01:10:19,632
-Lim Ju-kyung?
-Ju-kyung!

973
01:10:23,636 --> 01:10:24,803
Ju-kyung!

974
01:10:25,304 --> 01:10:27,890
Are you kidding me? Seriously?

975
01:10:27,973 --> 01:10:29,058
What the heck?

976
01:10:36,023 --> 01:10:37,483
You scared me.

977
01:10:39,652 --> 01:10:40,903
Goodness!

978
01:10:42,196 --> 01:10:44,698
-I'm sorry.
-Let's wipe your face.

979
01:10:44,782 --> 01:10:47,493
-Sorry.
-Ju-kyung, let's wipe your face.

980
01:10:51,372 --> 01:10:52,790
Ju-kyung, are you okay?

981
01:10:52,873 --> 01:10:54,291
She's upset because of you.

982
01:10:54,375 --> 01:10:55,626
Why did you throw it?

983
01:10:55,709 --> 01:10:57,169
-Apologize properly.
-Come on.

984
01:10:57,253 --> 01:10:58,504
-What's wrong with you?
-Jeez.

985
01:10:58,587 --> 01:11:00,047
-I'm sorry.
-Why did you do that?

986
01:11:00,130 --> 01:11:01,340
-Let's wipe it a bit.
-I'm sorry.

987
01:11:01,423 --> 01:11:03,300
-I'll wipe it for you.
-No, don't.

988
01:11:03,926 --> 01:11:05,844
-What's happening?
-Who is she?

989
01:11:05,928 --> 01:11:08,430
Isn't she the new girl? The famed goddess?

990
01:11:23,696 --> 01:11:24,530
Who…

991
01:11:26,865 --> 01:11:27,908
Who is that?

992
01:11:29,994 --> 01:11:33,289
Guys, it's me, Ju-kyung.

993
01:11:35,666 --> 01:11:36,792
What is she saying?

994
01:11:37,543 --> 01:11:40,587
-That's ridiculous.
-That's you, Ju-kyung?

995
01:11:40,671 --> 01:11:41,839
It was just all makeup?

996
01:11:41,922 --> 01:11:43,340
You're a con artist.

997
01:11:43,424 --> 01:11:45,050
You're so ugly.

998
01:11:45,718 --> 01:11:47,511
What was that about being a goddess?

999
01:11:47,594 --> 01:11:49,680
You look awful without makeup.

1000
01:11:49,763 --> 01:11:52,224
What exactly happened to your face?

1001
01:11:52,308 --> 01:11:53,559
I'm getting nauseous.

1002
01:11:54,268 --> 01:11:56,020
This is huge news.

1003
01:12:00,858 --> 01:12:03,736
Why are you acting this way?
We're friends.

1004
01:12:03,819 --> 01:12:04,653
-Friends?
-Hey.

1005
01:12:04,737 --> 01:12:07,489
We wouldn't have been friends
if I'd known you looked like this.

1006
01:12:07,573 --> 01:12:08,615
She's ridiculous.

1007
01:12:08,699 --> 01:12:10,492
-What friends?
-You're so ridiculous!

1008
01:13:10,386 --> 01:13:12,221
-What was that?
-What's happening?

1009
01:14:06,358 --> 01:14:07,693
Does he really know?

1010
01:14:07,776 --> 01:14:10,404
At my school,
there's someone who reminds me of you.

1011
01:14:13,115 --> 01:14:14,533
Why do you keep running away from me?

1012
01:14:14,616 --> 01:14:16,034
These are for me?

1013
01:14:16,118 --> 01:14:19,163
"You can postpone studying
but never falling in love."

1014
01:14:19,246 --> 01:14:21,123
Hey, Ju-kyung. Are you seeing Soo-ho?

1015
01:14:21,206 --> 01:14:22,624
What's he doing here?

1016
01:14:24,376 --> 01:14:25,335
Don't get off track.

1017
01:14:25,919 --> 01:14:27,171
Yet you seem to be doing well.

1018
01:14:27,754 --> 01:14:30,799
All this trouble
because you're too pretty.

1019
01:14:31,675 --> 01:14:32,843
I love you.

1020
01:14:33,635 --> 01:14:38,640
