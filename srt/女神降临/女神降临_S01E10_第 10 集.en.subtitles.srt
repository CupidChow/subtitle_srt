1
00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:53,553
Want to watch a movie while we eat?

2
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:54,971
Sure.

3
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:00,268
It smells good.

4
00:01:00,351 --> 00:01:01,311
What should we watch?

5
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:02,729
Well,

6
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:03,980
how about a horror movie?

7
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:06,357
We could watch something else.

8
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:07,942
Why? You can't watch scary stuff?

9
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:09,152
BASED ON WEBTOON TRUE BEAUTY
BY YAONGYI

10
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:12,489
It rained and all, so maybe we can
watch a musical or something.

11
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:15,658
What? You, the horror comic nerd,
can't watch horror movies?

12
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:17,827
I already read them as comics every day,

13
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:19,913
so no need to watch them as movies, right?

14
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:22,582
It'll be okay.
I'll cover your eyes if you get scared.

15
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:24,083
I'm not that much of a wimp, okay?

16
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:26,336
Turn off the lights.
Lights off for horror movies.

17
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:27,712
There are other interesting…

18
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:29,547
I'm being such a nuisance

19
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:31,633
when he's on a date with his girlfriend.

20
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,932
-Here.
-Okay.

21
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,553
Soo-ho is a man, indeed.

22
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:26,437
You really haven't seen horror films,
have you?

23
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:28,690
Ghosts don't come out
in these kinds of scenes.

24
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:39,534
You said they don't come out.

25
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:37,467
Dad?

26
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:52,815
That hurts.

27
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:57,612
Hey, young lady,
how dare you go to a guy's place alone?

28
00:03:58,154 --> 00:04:00,448
I told you I went there to dry off!

29
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:04,619
Didn't I tell you not to trust
any guys except me?

30
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:05,912
Mom told me before

31
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:08,790
that she had a full belly with Hee-kyung
when she got married.

32
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,960
My point exactly.

33
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:13,586
That's how men are, seriously.

34
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,838
Whatever.

35
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:18,675
I'm so embarrassed.
How do I see him after this?

36
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:20,969
You're not helping at all, Dad.

37
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:21,886
By the way,

38
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:23,930
don't tell your mom, okay?

39
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:25,848
That I mooched off of Soo-ho.

40
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,725
Then you keep it a secret from Mom too.

41
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:29,060
That I'm dating Lee Soo-ho.

42
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:34,857
You know I'm good
at keeping secrets, right?

43
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,277
You know I'm just like you, right?

44
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:48,913
-She'll be asleep, right?
-Of course.

45
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:49,831
She usually is.

46
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,179
-It seems your mom's asleep.
-Let's go in.

47
00:05:13,187 --> 00:05:14,147
Long time no see.

48
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:16,733
Parade rest.

49
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,151
Attention.

50
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,111
So,

51
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:22,655
did you catch Columbus Park?

52
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:24,699
Well…

53
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:26,242
No.

54
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:29,370
How dare you try to sneak into my house?

55
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:31,748
-Wait, honey!
-Mom!

56
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:34,083
-Honey, hear me out! Please!
-Hold it right there!

57
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,543
I need to explain myself!

58
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:37,712
-I'm a victim too.
-Mom!

59
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:40,214
-Honey, wait!
-Get out of my way, Ju-kyung!

60
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:50,892
Hi.

61
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,226
Did your dad scold you?

62
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,896
More like he got scolded by my mom.

63
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:56,773
I'm sorry.

64
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,691
My dad totally crashed our date.

65
00:05:58,775 --> 00:05:59,776
Not at all.

66
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:00,777
I had a good time.

67
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:03,237
You must be tired. Sleep tight.

68
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:04,739
Okay.

69
00:06:05,364 --> 00:06:06,199
Good night.

70
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:07,909
Good night.

71
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:15,792
Why aren't you hanging up?

72
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:18,044
You hang up first.

73
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:19,837
Okay.

74
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:26,219
Why aren't you hanging up?

75
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:28,888
I miss you.

76
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:30,890
Me too.

77
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:36,896
We'll stay up all night at this rate.

78
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:37,980
We could do that.

79
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,378
I totally thought that.

80
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:02,421
-Really?
-It's okay.

81
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:08,010
Jeez, you really take your sweet time.

82
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,804
You're killing me.

83
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:12,098
I wonder if Soo-ho felt like this as well.

84
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:14,475
I should tell everyone soon.

85
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:18,688
Good morning, Limju!

86
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,658
Sir, here.

87
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:32,410
Okay.

88
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:35,705
CAREER INTEREST SURVEY
HANKOOK UNIVERSITY COSMETOLOGY

89
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:37,039
Are you studying cosmetology?

90
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:38,458
Not yet.

91
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:41,294
I literally just have
an interest in the field.

92
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:43,212
I'm rooting for you.

93
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:44,964
Thank you, sir.

94
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:50,386
Mr. Han, are you really dating
that person from the other day?

95
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:51,888
No,

96
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:53,639
I'm not dating anyone.

97
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:54,807
Whatever do you mean?

98
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:56,767
She said you two were seeing each other!

99
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:58,102
That person…

100
00:07:58,644 --> 00:07:59,979
She works at Move Entertainment.

101
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:01,063
-Lim Hee--
-Bread!

102
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:04,734
Try this bread, would you?

103
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,700
Sorry about that. It just tastes so good.

104
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:14,744
-What--
-Please have more.

105
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:15,828
Please take it.

106
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:23,294
Thank you.

107
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:25,296
Is your head feeling better now?

108
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:27,298
I feel better getting some fresh air.

109
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:28,966
The weather's very nice today.

110
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:32,720
Right, the clouds are very pretty.

111
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:37,725
I…

112
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:41,896
I have something to tell you today.

113
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:43,564
What is it?

114
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:46,943
I wanted to tell you
before I tell the others.

115
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,031
Well…

116
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:55,409
-This--
-I have something to tell you too.

117
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:58,579
-What?
-It's about what you told me.

118
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:02,542
You said that you couldn't show your face
because you were worried

119
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,126
that people will turn on you.

120
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:07,547
I couldn't tell you then,

121
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:09,966
but I know how that feels.

122
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:12,051
Did something happen?

123
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:13,302
To be honest…

124
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:18,641
my dad hits me sometimes when he's upset.

125
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:20,643
What?

126
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:22,562
It's news to you, right?

127
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:26,440
Pretending that everything's okay
and nothing's wrong…

128
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:27,900
That's what I do best.

129
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:29,902
Su-jin.

130
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:32,071
I thought I hid it pretty well so far,

131
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:34,407
but Soo-ho knew about it all along.

132
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:36,450
Soo-ho did?

133
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:39,412
Now that my mask has shattered before him,

134
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:42,915
I don't want to bother pretending anymore.

135
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:46,168
Hiding my feelings,
pretending we're friends…

136
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:51,757
I like Lee Soo-ho.

137
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,512
So I can't treat him
how I used to anymore.

138
00:09:58,347 --> 00:10:01,684
I'm venting my frustration to you
because you're my best friend.

139
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:09,942
Why do you look so surprised?

140
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:11,694
Let's head back in.

141
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:16,907
Okay.

142
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:28,252
Hey, Su-jin,

143
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:29,795
actually…

144
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,299
I'm dating Lee Soo-ho.

145
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:36,302
-What?
-I thought I should tell you…

146
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:39,972
You're really dating Lee Soo-ho?

147
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:42,975
You two were flirting this whole time,

148
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:44,310
and you never told me about it?

149
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:46,896
I thought we were best friends.
How could you do this to me?

150
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:48,981
Had you told me sooner,
I wouldn't have let my feelings grow.

151
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:51,525
I wasn't trying to fool you.
I'm sorry. I really am.

152
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,028
If you feel that bad, break it off.

153
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:55,154
How can I do that?

154
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:58,532
Su-jin, can't you please
try to understand just this once?

155
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:03,579
Understand?

156
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:07,083
As of now, we're no longer friends.

157
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:08,918
Su-jin!

158
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:11,003
Are you the girl who's dating Lee Soo-ho?

159
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:12,838
Drag her to the rooftop.

160
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:14,507
No!

161
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:17,009
No!

162
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:19,095
Su-jin!

163
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:21,013
-Su-jin…
-Don't cry.

164
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:24,642
-Su-jin, are you okay?
-You swore to me you had no boyfriend.

165
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:25,768
What a two-faced girl!

166
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:26,936
-Two-faced.
-Seriously.

167
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,938
-How could she?
-That was deceitful.

168
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:30,106
That's enough girls.

169
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:32,775
It's my fault for not telling Soo-ho
how I feel sooner.

170
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:35,277
-Come on.
-It's not your fault.

171
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,823
What are you saying?

172
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:41,283
Kang Su-jin,

173
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:42,701
do you have feelings for me?

174
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:46,038
-Since when? Why didn't you tell me?
-How could I?

175
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:47,081
How could I tell you

176
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:49,583
that I developed feelings
after ten years of friendship?

177
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:53,462
If that's the case,
I wouldn't have dated Ju-kyung.

178
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,714
What's the point?
You're already her boyfriend.

179
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,426
I'll make things right.

180
00:11:58,509 --> 00:11:59,385
Lim Ju-kyung,

181
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:01,887
let's end things between us.

182
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:08,602
No!

183
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:11,063
LITERATURE FINAL EXAM RANGE

184
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:12,565
-What the heck?
-That scared me!

185
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:14,066
All right.

186
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,610
Since Ju-kyung feels
that strongly about it,

187
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:19,155
I won't be adding
more chapters to the final exam.

188
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:32,835
Ju-kyung!

189
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:36,505
-What?
-Why are you leaving by yourself?

190
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,507
-What?
-We have a study group today.

191
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,596
So we can walk together.

192
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:46,974
Soo-ho!

193
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:49,602
Heading to the study group?

194
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:52,313
Guys,

195
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,607
I'm going to skip today.

196
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:56,609
Why? Did something come up?

197
00:12:57,985 --> 00:13:00,362
I'm not feeling very well today.

198
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,281
I'll get going then.

199
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:04,950
Bye.

200
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:08,704
I wonder how bad it is.

201
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:26,555
LOVE COUNSELING

202
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:27,473
What do I do?

203
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:29,225
I'm dating this guy in secret,

204
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:31,101
and my best friend likes him too.

205
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:32,019
If you were me,

206
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:34,063
would you tell her what's going on?

207
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:35,814
Never. Keep the secret to the grave.

208
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:37,316
Coming from someone who's lost both.

209
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:38,859
If she's a true friend, yes. She'd get it.

210
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,027
You could always get a new guy.

211
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:42,404
But how could you break things
for a friend when you like him?

212
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:45,991
What do I do?

213
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:52,748
Meet me at Prince Comics?

214
00:13:52,831 --> 00:13:54,708
Han Go-un's not here, so don't worry.

215
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:04,635
PRINCE COMICS

216
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:06,470
Did you take some medicine?

217
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:09,014
I wasn't sure why you were sick
so I bought everything.

218
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:11,850
It's okay, I don't need any medicine.

219
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:13,769
All I need is some rest.

220
00:14:13,852 --> 00:14:16,313
You should still take some.
Have some porridge first.

221
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:18,148
Here.

222
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:25,865
What's wrong?

223
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:28,117
Does it hurt that much?

224
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:29,827
No.

225
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:32,246
I'm just grateful.

226
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:37,543
You even worked out
after being worn out from your shift.

227
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:38,752
That must have done it.

228
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,381
I shouldn't have asked you to come out.

229
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:44,300
What's going on with you?

230
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:47,845
Why are you being so sweet?

231
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:52,850
You have a handsome face and great grades,

232
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:54,810
so your only flaw was your awful temper.

233
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,604
But now you're acting sweet too!

234
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:58,647
How can people see you as a friend
when you're so perfect?

235
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,733
How could anyone
not fall in love with you?

236
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:03,402
Who fell for whom?

237
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:16,624
What is it?

238
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:18,250
My dad was right.

239
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:22,713
Handsome guys bring
a handsome amount of heartache.

240
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:28,260
It's hot.

241
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:31,055
Blow on it first.

242
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:39,104
Have some meat too.

243
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,785
Are you going to stay upset with me?

244
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:55,913
You're not talking to me anymore?

245
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:56,872
Jun-woo.

246
00:15:57,539 --> 00:15:58,958
Han Jun-woo.

247
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,084
Babe!

248
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:09,259
Okay.

249
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:11,553
That was…

250
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:12,930
I…

251
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:15,724
lost it for a moment
and had a misunderstanding.

252
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:19,687
But who wouldn't go crazy seeing her man
with another woman like that?

253
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:20,854
Both of them

254
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:22,940
teach Ju-kyung as well.

255
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:26,443
Didn't you consider
I'd be put in an awkward position?

256
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,154
Well…

257
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:31,782
I'm sorry.

258
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:33,784
If you had told me before,
I wouldn't have…

259
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:36,286
You don't tell me anything,
so why would I?

260
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,997
You've been drinking more lately.

261
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:42,209
Something clearly happened at work,
but you don't tell me about it.

262
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:44,128
What's the point of moaning and whining?

263
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:46,130
Would you rather I cried?

264
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:52,428
You and I aren't strangers.
We're together now.

265
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:55,305
If something comes up in the future,

266
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:56,223
let's…

267
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:57,933
share the burden.

268
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:06,859
What do I do?

269
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:09,570
I want to kiss you right now.

270
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:11,739
What?

271
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:13,699
You're out of your mind!

272
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:16,243
I'll share everything with you.

273
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:18,454
Even what I eat for lunch every day.

274

WRITTEN EXAM QUESTIONS

275
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:27,921
WARM VS. COOL UNDERTONE

276
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:29,381
LOVE VS. FRIENDSHIP

277
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,431
Hey, Lim Ju-bal.

278
00:17:37,514 --> 00:17:38,640
I told you to knock!

279
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:41,560
-Do you have any comic books to return?
-No.

280
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:44,063
-Then how about to borrow?
-None.

281
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:45,898
Why not?

282
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:47,816
You used to borrow ten books daily!

283
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,734
Watch it.

284
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:52,112
Hey, why are you so eager
to go to the comics shop?

285
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:54,490
Eager?

286
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:56,450
Eager? Jeez.

287
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:58,869
I don't want to go
anywhere near Prince Comics.

288
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:01,497
Goodness.

289
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:06,126
Why is he also acting out
when I have enough to worry about?

290
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,131
MY FRIEND SU-JIN

291
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,140
Hey, Su-jin.

292
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:33,112
-What?
-What? I'm here to borrow some comics.

293
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:42,621
EXPLICIT CONTENT
ONE NIGHT STAND WITH THE WILD WOLF

294
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:43,872
I'm not sure why…

295
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:47,668
I understand your needs,
but you need to wait another three years.

296
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:49,586
Darn it.

297
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,588
I grabbed that by accident.

298
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:55,008
I'm not that kind of person.

299
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:57,636
I might have these steaming hot looks,

300
00:18:57,719 --> 00:18:59,179
but my heart is innocent.

301
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:01,682
You're in my way. Move over.

302
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:04,476
Not that I'm curious,

303
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,770
but I'll ask since I have
some time on my hands.

304
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:08,564
What's the reason?

305
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:10,858
Here we go again.

306
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:13,318
I've got the looks, the body,

307
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:14,403
and the brains.

308
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:16,905
Why would you reject
such a perfect guy like me?

309
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,198
I don't like you.

310
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:21,160
But I don't see why you would. So why?

311
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:22,661
Give me ten reasons.

312
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:23,829
I'll back off then.

313
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:25,497
Seriously, you're so annoying.

314
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:28,250
One. You're not my type.

315
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,043
Two. You're too skinny.

316
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:31,670
Three. You're too into yourself.

317
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:32,921
Four. I hate your voice.

318
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,173
Five. A bad personality.

319
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:36,091
-Six. You're not funny. Seven--
-Stop it.

320
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,677
My list can go on to 100, so go home.

321
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:41,722
Go-un, I'm here.

322
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:43,307
What are you doing here, Seo-jun?

323
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:44,683
I was in the neighborhood…

324
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:47,644
and I stopped by in case you were hungry.

325
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:50,439
You're the best.

326
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:52,149
Han Seo-jun is her boyfriend?

327
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:53,400
Do you want some?

328
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:58,197
Okay.

329
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,032
Now I get it.

330
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:02,117
The reason she rejected me.

331
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:09,541
Who's that nutcase?

332
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,293
Just some nutcase.

333
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:14,129
If he gives you trouble, tell me. Got it?

334
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:15,589
I told you before.

335
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:18,008
Why bother with a part-time job?
I told you not to.

336
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:18,926
You're too young.

337
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:21,220
You act like you know better
when you're only a year older.

338
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:23,555
Let's see what you brought.

339
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:25,140
I was super hungry.

340
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:27,809
-Great job.
-I know what you like.

341
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:36,652
What?

342
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,153
She's really pretty.

343
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:46,245
She sure is really pretty.

344
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:49,081
Su-jin!

345
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:51,667
Ju-kyung.

346
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:55,545
Did I keep you waiting?

347
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:57,256
No, not at all. Let's go.

348
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,678
Let's take a look around,

349
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:04,263
Are you buying a hat?

350
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:06,932
Yes. Which one looks good?

351
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:11,436
How about this? It will look good on you.

352
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:15,357
It's not for me.
It's a present for Soo-ho.

353
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,403
-Soo-ho?
-Yes.

354
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:22,781
My family and his family
shared a meal together recently,

355
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:24,449
and Soo-ho saved me that day.

356
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:27,953
How did he save you?

357
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:31,290
My dad was suffocating me,
and suddenly he said,

358
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:33,500
"We have a study session. Let's go."

359
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:35,419
He took off, taking me with him.

360
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:37,379
He was so awesome.

361
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:40,465
I see.

362
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:42,634
How about this? Will it look good on him?

363
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:44,011
You have a younger brother,

364
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:45,971
so you must know what guys are into.

365
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,768
-I think it looks nice.
-You do? Then I'll get this one.

366
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:53,603
I hope he likes it.

367
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:55,647
Sure.

368
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:57,441
By the way, Ju-kyung,

369
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:00,694
should I tell him how I feel
when I give him this?

370
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:03,739
What?

371
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:05,824
Would it catch him off guard?

372
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:08,076
We've been friends
for more than ten years,

373
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,661
so he wouldn't cut me off, right?

374
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:16,084
I'm not really sure.

375
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:18,462
Is it right to tell him how I feel?

376
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:20,839
Either way, you'll support me, right?

377
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:28,680
BOYFRIEND

378
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:32,350
Who is it? Take it.

379
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:36,271
It's all right.

380
00:22:37,355 --> 00:22:39,441
The person you are trying to reach is…

381
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:41,068
GIRLFRIEND

382
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:44,279
I'm helping my dad with chores,

383
00:22:44,362 --> 00:22:45,822
so I can't pick up.

384
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:48,366
She can't even answer the phone?

385
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:52,496
My dad was right.

386
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:56,124
Handsome guys bring
a handsome amount of heartache.

387
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,219
My girlfriend's dad caught us kissing.

388
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:09,346
-I'd kill the guy if I'd been there.
-You'll see when you have a daughter.

389
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:11,598
You can't even hold hands
in front of your girlfriend's dad.

390
00:23:20,857 --> 00:23:22,025
Lee Soo-ho!

391
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:23,693
You dirty animal!

392
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:26,947
I'm going to crush anyone
who touches my daughter!

393
00:23:31,284 --> 00:23:32,119
I'm screwed.

394
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:34,371
Are you heading to work?

395
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:37,374
Yes, it's nearby.

396
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:38,667
Good luck with your shift.

397
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:42,295
It looked cute,
so I bought it with the hat.

398
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:44,756
Do you like it?

399
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,550
It's cute.

400
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:48,176
Wait for it.

401
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,928
I got a matching one.

402
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:53,515
It's really pretty.

403
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:55,392
Thank you.

404
00:23:55,475 --> 00:23:56,977
No, thank you.

405
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:59,980
Thanks for hanging out with me
before work.

406
00:24:00,063 --> 00:24:02,524
-You'll be late, so get going.
-Okay.

407
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:06,027
-See you tomorrow.
-Okay. Take care.

408
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:29,050
What?

409
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:30,886
What are you doing here?

410
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:35,473
The boss asked me to fill in for someone.

411
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:37,809
I didn't want to, but I had no choice.

412
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:39,728
I see.

413
00:24:40,478 --> 00:24:42,397
I'll get changed and join you.

414
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:55,911
Hey!

415
00:24:56,494 --> 00:24:58,455
Why would you tie your hair
all of a sudden?

416
00:24:58,538 --> 00:25:01,249
Who ties their hair like that
in front of a friend?

417
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:02,792
I need to if I want to work.

418
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:04,294
What's wrong?

419
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:07,422
Go ahead.

420
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:18,141
Here you go.

421
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:20,602
Welcome!

422
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:23,230
-One Americano.
-One Americano.

423
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:25,148
-One latte, please.
-One latte.

424
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:27,192
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

425
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,952
-I'll do it.
-It's okay. I'll do it.

426
00:25:58,098 --> 00:25:59,307
Take a break.

427
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:03,561
This glass is spotless.

428
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:05,647
Why would you keep wiping it?

429
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:07,732
Is it already?

430
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:10,235
What are you thinking about?

431
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:12,946
I'm not thinking about anything.

432
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:15,699
Did you fight with Soo-ho?

433
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:18,451
Why would we?

434
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:21,579
You fought, right? You definitely did.

435
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:23,915
No, we didn't.

436
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:26,084
You've already fought
and it's been how long?

437
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:28,086
You two might as well just break up!

438
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:33,550
Hey,

439
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:35,093
are you crying?

440
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:39,764
Did you really break up?

441
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:43,935
I said we didn't.

442
00:26:45,478 --> 00:26:46,813
Get back to work.

443
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,443
What was that?

444
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:01,870
Mr. Lim.

445
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:05,206
How are you?

446
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:06,833
Hello, Soo-ho.

447
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,002
Are you here to see Ju-kyung?

448
00:27:09,085 --> 00:27:11,546
It's a shame.
Ju-kyung's not home right now.

449
00:27:11,629 --> 00:27:12,630
She's not?

450
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:16,301
I thought she was at home.

451
00:27:17,093 --> 00:27:18,053
Goodbye, then.

452
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:21,056
Wait a second.

453
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:24,768
I came to give you this.

454
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:42,702
SAEBOM STATION, SAEBOM HIGH SCHOOL

455
00:27:50,126 --> 00:27:51,002
What?

456
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:52,837
Your place isn't in this part of town.

457
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,882
I thought I'd go home
with Go-un after her shift.

458
00:28:02,138 --> 00:28:03,640
You've been sighing all day.

459
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:07,644
Hey,

460
00:28:07,727 --> 00:28:11,106
have you ever liked the same girl
as your best friend?

461
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:12,899
What?

462
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:16,403
Did Soo-ho say that? What did he say?

463
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:17,904
How much did he tell you?

464
00:28:17,987 --> 00:28:20,448
Why are you getting upset
as if this is about you?

465
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:22,826
-Do you like someone?
-No!

466
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:24,619
It's not like that.

467
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:29,165
Two girls liked me at once.
That's what I was getting at.

468
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:31,042
I'm just very popular like that.

469
00:28:32,168 --> 00:28:33,545
Show off much?

470
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:34,963
Anyway.

471
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:37,006
Why do you ask?

472
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:39,259
Well…

473
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:43,179
This is about a friend of a friend.

474
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:46,808
So my friend's friend got a boyfriend,

475
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:48,601
but a friend of my friend's friend

476
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:50,979
suddenly told her
that she likes her boyfriend.

477
00:28:51,646 --> 00:28:52,981
But that friend

478
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:55,900
doesn't know that my friend's friend
is dating that guy,

479
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,737
so my friend's friend
is wondering what to do.

480
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:02,991
She's debating whether or not
to tell her friend she's dating the guy.

481
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:03,908
Okay.

482
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:05,827
What?

483
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:08,371
Gosh.

484
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:10,790
I'll put it this way.

485
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:13,334
I'm dating Lee Soo-ho.

486
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:14,836
You and I are friends, right?

487
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:17,422
But it turns out
that you also like Soo-ho…

488
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:20,592
Are you kidding me?

489
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:23,428
Was the analogy a bit off?

490
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:25,638
Well, anyway…

491
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:28,016
So what you're saying is
you and Soo-ho are dating,

492
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:30,059
but Su-jin also likes Soo-ho.

493
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:33,229
But she doesn't know
that you two are dating.

494
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:34,647
That's it, right?

495
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:36,107
Yes. No--

496
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:37,984
I guess.

497
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:41,613
Hypothetically, you could say that.
Just as an example.

498
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:45,742
So you're worried that telling Su-jin
might ruin your friendship.

499
00:29:45,825 --> 00:29:49,162
You're saying you have to choose
between love and friendship, right?

500
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:50,663
Well,

501
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:54,000
I'm not sure if it is
a matter of choice or not.

502
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:57,629
Anyway, my friend's friend
is worried about it.

503
00:29:58,296 --> 00:30:00,465
If you're a girl,
you should choose friendship.

504
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:02,675
Love doesn't last forever.

505
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:06,721
Tell her to break things off with her guy
and work on her friendship more.

506
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,973
How can you break up
with someone you like?

507
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:10,558
I don't know who that guy is,

508
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:13,228
but he shouldn't have gotten
himself in such a situation.

509
00:30:14,103 --> 00:30:17,065
You don't want to date a guy
with complicated relationships.

510
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:20,860
-Just break up.
-His relationships aren't complicated.

511
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:24,531
According to my friend's friend,

512
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:26,407
that is.

513
00:30:28,701 --> 00:30:29,786
Don't worry.

514
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:32,956
Lee Soo-ho isn't the type
to make you worry.

515
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:36,709
I told you, it's not about me.

516
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:38,920
Whatever.

517
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:50,181
When are you coming?
Grab some instant noodles on the way home.

518
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:55,895
Hey, your shoelace is undone.

519
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:57,939
Leave it, just keep moving.

520
00:30:58,022 --> 00:31:00,525
You could trip and faceplant.

521
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:01,609
Come on, tie it.

522
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:03,444
Why?

523
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:05,697
Worried that my handsome face
might get crushed?

524
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:08,950
Everything I do is for style, okay?

525
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:10,159
Typical.

526
00:31:10,243 --> 00:31:12,620
You think just like Ju-young.

527
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:15,498
Okay, lift your foot up.

528
00:31:16,165 --> 00:31:19,168
Gosh, you're so high-maintenance.

529
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:24,549
There you go.

530
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:30,054
Hey, Ju-kyung!

531
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:32,599
It's undone again.

532
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:34,142
Tie it right.

533
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:35,935
You do it yourself.

534
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:39,063
What if I faceplant?

535
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:42,150
-Hey!
-Hey, be careful!

536
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:43,776
Well, I'm not good at tying shoes.

537
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,695
I said, do it yourself.

538
00:31:45,778 --> 00:31:46,946
How do I tie it?

539
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:49,240
-You don't know how to tie your shoes?
-No.

540
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:52,452
PRINCE COMICS

541
00:31:52,535 --> 00:31:53,912
Hey, Go-un's not here.

542
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:54,996
Really?

543
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:56,497
Did she already head back?

544
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:59,042
Jeez. You should have called her first.

545
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:01,002
I'm heading home. Get home safe.

546
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:03,087
-Bye.
-Are you just getting back?

547
00:32:04,797 --> 00:32:05,924
Seo-jun!

548
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:08,509
Hello.

549
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:10,929
Long time no see!

550
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:13,348
I see you've gotten close with Ju-kyung.

551
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:15,850
I've been taking care of her at school.

552
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:18,227
When did you ever take care of me?

553
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:19,979
Did you have dinner yet?

554
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:21,648
We're making dumplings at home.

555
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:24,275
Why don't you join us?
And take some home for your mom.

556
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:25,902
Don't ask him to stay for dinner.

557
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:27,362
You go home. Let's go, Mom.

558
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:28,363
Why?

559
00:32:29,572 --> 00:32:32,158
-Ma'am, let's go.
-Okay, let's go.

560
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:34,827
-Do you like dumplings?
-I love them.

561
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:36,245
That's great!

562
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:38,873
-Why are we having dumplings?
-Just shut up and come.

563
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:41,042
Come in, our place is a little shabby.

564
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:44,170
Right.

565
00:32:44,253 --> 00:32:47,215
I forgot to tell you
that dear Soo-ho is here too.

566
00:32:51,886 --> 00:32:54,597
Ju-kyung's friends are all at our place!

567
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:56,265
"Dear Soo-ho"?

568
00:32:58,059 --> 00:32:59,102
What…

569
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:00,103
are you doing here?

570
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:03,272
I just ran into Soo-ho
in front of our place.

571
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:05,858
So I invited him in to stay for dinner.

572
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:09,445
-Why are you two coming in together?
-I had my part-time--

573
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:11,823
You said that was a secret
from your family.

574
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:16,411
-We were hanging out.
-You said you were busy with chores.

575
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:19,038
-You were hanging out?
-Well…

576
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:20,289
Controlling much?

577
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:22,500
Even if you're dating--

578
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:24,877
Hey, my mom doesn't know we date.

579
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:26,254
That's a secret too?

580
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:31,759
We have so many people,
we'll make the dumplings in no time!

581
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:34,345
What? You haven't even made them yet?

582
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:37,348
-Why would you have them make dumplings?
-Here we go.

583
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:40,226
Dumplings taste best
when freshly made and steamed.

584
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:42,353
What's wrong with you? Aren't I right?

585
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:44,105
Of course.

586
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:50,028
Han Go-un's boyfriend, Han Seo-jun.

587
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:52,363
So I meet my rival here.

588
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:57,952
Soo-ho.

589
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:01,122
Sprinkle more flour.
The dough will stick otherwise.

590
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:02,373
Thank you.

591
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:07,545
-Seo-jun makes such pretty dumplings.
-I've tried it at home.

592
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:10,048
Mom told me I have to
make pretty dumplings

593
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:11,758
to have a pretty daughter.

594
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,093
So I tried hard to master it.

595
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:17,930
Mi-hyang must make pretty dumplings
since she has a very handsome son.

596
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:19,015
Not at all.

597
00:34:19,098 --> 00:34:20,558
You must be popular at school.

598
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:21,642
Maybe a little.

599
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:23,436
Popular?

600
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:26,689
I doubt he can compete with Soo-ho.

601
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:30,193
Gosh, your entire body is glowing!

602
00:34:30,818 --> 00:34:32,653
Look at his arms bulging!

603
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:37,241
Anyway, Seo-jun,

604
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:40,078
why were you hanging out with my sister
when you have a girlfriend?

605
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:41,079
Me?

606
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:43,206
I don't have a girlfriend.

607
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:45,374
What a bastard.

608
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:46,501
Here.

609
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:49,504
Have some water to refresh yourselves.

610
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:52,673
My goodness!

611
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:55,927
I almost spilled on the floor.

612
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:57,762
What has gotten into him?

613
00:34:57,845 --> 00:34:59,180
You should have been careful.

614
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:00,139
Thank you.

615
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:01,933
Anyway, Ju-kyung is so lucky.

616
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:04,102
She has two handsome friends like you.

617
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:06,771
Keep hanging out with them
so you can pick one

618
00:35:06,854 --> 00:35:08,606
and date him when you go to college.

619
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:10,358
What's there to pick?

620
00:35:13,694 --> 00:35:16,364
Well, I personally give my vote to Soo-ho.

621
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:22,286
Come on. Why are you voting?

622
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:24,288
My vote goes to Soo-ho as well.

623
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:27,291
I love you, Soo-ho.

624
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:29,752
Actually,

625
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:31,170
I had a mind to make Seo-jun

626
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:34,465
Ju-kyung's boyfriend later.

627
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:37,135
Let me know if you need
a ticket to my dad's fan meeting.

628
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:40,096
My goodness. Do you mean it?

629
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:42,640
You don't even talk to your dad.

630
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:44,892
What are you looking at?

631
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:47,728
I'm not sure who to pick out of the two.

632
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:49,564
Why are you contemplating who to pick?

633
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:51,732
Let's just hurry
and make dumplings in silence.

634
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:53,067
But it's fun.

635
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:58,156
My vote will go to
whoever makes better dumplings.

636
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:08,309
-Stop.
-Stop.

637
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:09,560
-Stop.
-Stop…

638
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:41,986
These dumplings are definitely something.
They're almost like…

639
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:45,156
-Crouching tiger, hidden dragon.
-No. Crouching crane, hidden dragon.

640
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:46,073
But still,

641
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:47,658
I like the one on the right more.

642
00:38:51,203 --> 00:38:53,080
By the way, what did you make this with?

643
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:58,336
Dad.

644
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:06,344
Seo-jun wins!

645
00:39:10,931 --> 00:39:12,725
No, honey. I broke it, so…

646
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:30,534
Who cares about dumplings?

647
00:39:31,118 --> 00:39:32,703
I'm still so worried.

648
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:38,709
Can I come in?

649
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:44,673
Sure. Just a second!

650
00:39:49,595 --> 00:39:50,805
Come in!

651
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:53,808
Well…

652
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,435
I was about to head out.

653
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:57,353
What is it?

654
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:03,359
So this is what your room is like.

655
00:40:04,026 --> 00:40:05,778
Yes. Just as unimpressive as me.

656
00:40:05,861 --> 00:40:07,571
You've seen it now, right? Let's go.

657
00:40:09,615 --> 00:40:10,616
If we go back out,

658
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:12,701
I can't talk to you.

659
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:15,913
So…

660
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:17,998
what did you do with Han Seo-jun?

661
00:40:18,624 --> 00:40:20,292
We didn't hang out. We were working.

662
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:24,338
I told you he helped me
get the part-time job.

663
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:26,507
He came to fill in for someone today.

664
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:29,427
But my parents don't know about my job,
so he said that.

665
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:31,095
Then you should have told me
you were working.

666
00:40:31,178 --> 00:40:33,347
Why did you lie to me
saying you had chores?

667
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:40,187
Don't do that from now on.

668
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:43,107
Okay.

669
00:40:43,649 --> 00:40:44,483
Sorry.

670
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:52,199
Don't people usually show their boyfriends
old photo albums when they come over?

671
00:40:52,908 --> 00:40:54,785
I'm never going to show you.

672
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:56,370
Why share my dark past?

673
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:57,455
And yet,

674
00:40:57,538 --> 00:40:59,165
here it is on display.

675
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:04,253
This isn't me.

676
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:08,257
"Saessak Kindergarten, Lim Ju-kyung."
It's written right here.

677
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:11,010
Jeez. Why did I have to put this here?

678
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:16,724
What?

679
00:41:18,517 --> 00:41:19,643
Why?

680
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:21,395
Are you shocked I looked so ugly?

681
00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:23,564
You…

682
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:26,150
Yes?

683
00:41:29,361 --> 00:41:31,489
Nothing. Can I keep this?

684
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:34,492
Why would you bother taking that?

685
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:36,577
-Hey, give it back.
-Just this one.

686
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,746
-Why would you take it?
-I'll just take one.

687
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:40,247
-Why?
-Just one photo!

688
00:41:48,088 --> 00:41:49,590
Ju-kyung, is Soo-ho…

689
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:52,259
He is here.

690
00:42:00,142 --> 00:42:01,352
We're right downstairs.

691
00:42:02,102 --> 00:42:03,354
I just fell down.

692
00:42:03,437 --> 00:42:04,688
I know you fell down.

693
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:06,023
Soo-ho.

694
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:08,192
Remember what I said?

695
00:42:08,275 --> 00:42:09,652
-W.
-Wholesome.

696
00:42:09,735 --> 00:42:11,028
-I.
-Innocent.

697
00:42:11,111 --> 00:42:12,571
Keep that in mind.

698
00:42:17,117 --> 00:42:18,202
Dad, come on.

699
00:42:18,285 --> 00:42:20,287
She asked me to bring the table out.

700
00:42:24,166 --> 00:42:25,459
Where is the table?

701
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:28,629
It's right here.

702
00:42:29,421 --> 00:42:30,881
It's like this is your place.

703
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:34,260
Hey, how are you two fighting
when you've barely dated?

704
00:42:34,343 --> 00:42:36,762
What are you talking about?
We didn't fight.

705
00:42:36,845 --> 00:42:38,055
If you didn't fight,

706
00:42:38,138 --> 00:42:41,183
then why would she be distracted
and sighing all day?

707
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:43,561
She was weighing love against friendship.

708
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:47,731
Whatever happens between us,
don't you cross the line.

709
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:51,735
-It's none of your business.
-So help me not to butt in.

710
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:55,155
Don't make her worried
that she comes to me for dating advice.

711
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:57,074
It makes me want to get between you two.

712
00:42:58,617 --> 00:43:00,077
What the hell are you talking about?

713
00:43:01,161 --> 00:43:02,788
Did I say something wrong?

714
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:10,379
-Mom, I'll put these in the kitchen.
-Okay.

715
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:23,017
You come here.

716
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,728
Let go. Your head, everything…

717
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,118
Here.

718
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:46,498
Keep these in the freezer
and steam them, okay?

719
00:43:47,374 --> 00:43:48,375
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

720
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:49,543
Don't you two fight.

721
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:52,713
I'm not sure what happened
between you two,

722
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:54,757
but talk things out.

723
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:57,092
It'll get worse if you bottle things up.

724
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,429
I'm sure they'll deal with it.
Let's get back in, okay?

725
00:44:00,512 --> 00:44:02,014
Come on.

726
00:44:12,399 --> 00:44:13,609
I love you.

727
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:18,280
I love you.

728
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:28,415
You two are old enough
to know not to get into a brawl.

729
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:32,044
-I love you.
-It's only natural for boys at that age.

730
00:44:32,795 --> 00:44:34,129
Dumplings smell good, though.

731
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:35,673
I love you.

732
00:44:49,603 --> 00:44:50,687
Well,

733
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:53,232
I went to a Korean restaurant,
and the side dishes were

734
00:44:53,315 --> 00:44:55,275
braised beans, shishito peppers,

735
00:44:56,402 --> 00:44:58,112
and stir-fried squid…

736
00:44:58,195 --> 00:44:59,279
Stop.

737
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:02,699
You don't have to tell me all that.

738
00:45:02,783 --> 00:45:04,660
I've been sending you updates all day.

739
00:45:04,743 --> 00:45:06,954
I even canceled my staff dinner.
I want a reward.

740
00:45:07,996 --> 00:45:08,831
A reward?

741
00:45:08,914 --> 00:45:09,873
You know what I want.

742
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,168
I'm not sure.

743
00:45:13,252 --> 00:45:15,712
Hey, I'm not going to hang up
until you do it.

744
00:45:29,309 --> 00:45:31,019
You don't have a girlfriend? My foot.

745
00:45:41,488 --> 00:45:42,489
What was that?

746
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:46,577
-The music video came out well.
-Right? It's totally awesome.

747
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:48,036
It's catchy.

748
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:51,457
I was worried it would lack impact
as a debut song because it's so mellow.

749
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:52,791
But it turned out well.

750
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:54,710
-Gosh, you scared me.
-What is this song?

751
00:45:55,836 --> 00:45:56,712
Ms. Lim.

752
00:45:57,379 --> 00:45:59,256
Is this Black Soul's debut song?

753
00:45:59,798 --> 00:46:01,258
Isn't this Leo's song?

754
00:46:01,341 --> 00:46:02,176
Sorry?

755
00:46:02,676 --> 00:46:03,927
I don't know what you mean.

756
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:07,556
They canceled the tribute album project.
How is this song being used like this?

757
00:46:07,639 --> 00:46:10,309
Did you buy it from Leo?
Did you get his permission?

758
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:19,693
RESERVED FOR LIM JU-KYUNG.
SIT HERE AND YOU'LL GROW BUTT HAIR.

759
00:46:42,257 --> 00:46:43,091
Hey, crybaby.

760
00:46:43,592 --> 00:46:44,426
You're back.

761
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:45,802
I'm not a crybaby.

762
00:46:45,886 --> 00:46:48,096
Aren't you the kid
who was crying here the last…

763
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:50,015
Meow.

764
00:46:50,891 --> 00:46:52,434
I cried that one time.

765
00:46:55,979 --> 00:46:58,065
I came here to read that one.

766
00:46:58,148 --> 00:46:59,733
You can have it after I'm done.

767
00:46:59,816 --> 00:47:01,235
It's first come, first served--

768
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:02,778
I know how things are.

769
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:05,155
You're petty.

770
00:47:18,126 --> 00:47:19,795
So that guy was a ghost.

771
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:23,131
Wait, I'm not done yet.

772
00:47:23,966 --> 00:47:25,092
I'm done.

773
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:26,677
I said I'm not done!

774
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:32,349
Sir, she just ripped--

775
00:47:33,892 --> 00:47:35,352
Keep this a secret, okay?

776
00:47:49,992 --> 00:47:52,160
I can't believe that girl was Ju-kyung.

777
00:48:19,021 --> 00:48:22,608
You shouldn't make fun of someone's pain.

778
00:48:23,191 --> 00:48:25,068
Sorry. I'm sorry.

779
00:48:26,945 --> 00:48:28,363
You'll be okay now.

780
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,099
The person I like…

781
00:48:56,850 --> 00:48:58,060
is you.

782
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:37,015
Limju!

783
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:38,725
What is it now?

784
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:40,727
-Congratulations!
-Since when did you start going out?

785
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:42,187
Why didn't you tell me?

786
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:44,898
So does that make you two
the second couple of our class?

787
00:49:45,732 --> 00:49:46,608
Ju-kyung, is it true?

788
00:49:47,192 --> 00:49:48,026
Su-jin,

789
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:50,570
I wasn't trying to deceive you…

790
00:49:53,198 --> 00:49:55,575
-Ta-da!
-Ta-da!

791
00:49:57,244 --> 00:49:59,162
I heard you're secretly dating
Han Seo-jun.

792
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:01,039
You took couple photos too, didn't you?

793
00:50:01,123 --> 00:50:02,165
-Didn't you?
-What?

794
00:50:04,376 --> 00:50:05,419
Me and Han Seo-jun?

795
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:07,629
What's this?
Cho-rong, what are you doing here?

796
00:50:07,713 --> 00:50:10,674
-Congratulations!
-Congratulations!

797
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:21,351
Hey, you schmuck!

798
00:50:21,435 --> 00:50:23,019
I told you she got a boyfriend.

799
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:25,272
Look at this pose.

800
00:50:26,231 --> 00:50:28,608
Gosh, they look good together, don't they?

801
00:50:29,609 --> 00:50:32,112
Should we take her from him?
But that's not right.

802
00:50:32,195 --> 00:50:33,613
What are you going to do?

803
00:50:35,949 --> 00:50:40,871
-Tell us!
-Tell us!

804
00:50:40,954 --> 00:50:41,913
-Tell us!
-Come on!

805
00:50:41,997 --> 00:50:44,040
Okay, a question from Channel Hyun-kyu!

806
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:48,712
Your secret date at the K-Mall.
Was that with Mr. Han Seo-jun?

807
00:50:48,795 --> 00:50:51,381
-Did you go on a date?
-When was your first kiss?

808
00:50:52,257 --> 00:50:54,468
Okay, everyone!

809
00:50:54,551 --> 00:50:58,555
We're just good friends,
nothing more and nothing less.

810
00:50:58,638 --> 00:51:01,767
So no more speculative rumors, please.

811
00:51:02,517 --> 00:51:04,227
Are you holding a press conference?

812
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:06,646
You should say something too.

813
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:08,148
You're going to let this slide?

814
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:13,320
-You all!
-Goodness.

815
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:15,697
You're in big trouble
if you say anything stupid.

816
00:51:17,699 --> 00:51:18,575
Happy?

817
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:28,585
-Hey, be honest.
-So did you do it or not?

818
00:51:28,668 --> 00:51:30,545
-Man-sik!
-A peck? A kiss?

819
00:51:30,629 --> 00:51:31,880
I'm going to get upset.

820
00:51:31,963 --> 00:51:35,509
-He did it.
-He totally kissed her.

821
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:37,594
I'm sorry.

822
00:51:40,347 --> 00:51:43,558
Why is the rumor mill
fixated on me and Seo-jun?

823
00:51:43,642 --> 00:51:45,393
Why don't you just date him?

824
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:47,103
How many times has this happened?

825
00:51:47,187 --> 00:51:50,273
It probably means
that you are meant to be.

826
00:51:50,857 --> 00:51:52,317
We're just friends.

827
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,236
You can be friends, then catch feelings.

828
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:56,863
Feelings never stay the same forever.

829
00:51:57,405 --> 00:51:59,783
Kangsu, then why don't you date Soo-ho?

830
00:51:59,866 --> 00:52:03,161
You two could suddenly
catch feelings too, right?

831
00:52:03,245 --> 00:52:05,038
Lim Ju-kyung and Han Seo-jun.

832
00:52:05,121 --> 00:52:06,748
Kang Su-jin and Lee Soo-ho.

833
00:52:07,374 --> 00:52:09,626
I can see it already. It feels right.

834
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:11,294
Should I?

835
00:52:12,045 --> 00:52:13,880
What, Kangsu? Are you serious?

836
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:15,298
Not at all.

837
00:52:16,174 --> 00:52:17,175
That was very fishy.

838
00:52:17,259 --> 00:52:18,635
Well, this won't do.

839
00:52:18,718 --> 00:52:20,303
I need to dig deep today.

840
00:52:20,929 --> 00:52:23,557
Are you free after school?
Let's hang out, the three of us.

841
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:25,141
I can't.

842
00:52:25,225 --> 00:52:26,560
I'm meeting with Soo-ho later.

843
00:52:27,727 --> 00:52:29,980
-What?
-Just you and Soo-ho? Why?

844
00:52:30,063 --> 00:52:31,982
Well, I'll tell you later.

845
00:52:32,065 --> 00:52:35,235
Seriously, what is it?
Are you sure nothing is going on?

846
00:52:35,318 --> 00:52:37,112
Please tell me!

847
00:52:38,154 --> 00:52:39,197
Meet me on the rooftop.

848
00:52:39,281 --> 00:52:40,532
-Who is it?
-What?

849
00:52:41,449 --> 00:52:42,284
Well…

850
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:43,743
It's nothing.

851
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:56,631
Don't you have something to say?

852
00:52:57,632 --> 00:52:58,466
Say what?

853
00:52:59,593 --> 00:53:00,760
What's with the pictures?

854
00:53:01,553 --> 00:53:02,846
You sound upset.

855
00:53:04,222 --> 00:53:05,056
Yes.

856
00:53:05,765 --> 00:53:06,600
I'm upset.

857
00:53:07,183 --> 00:53:09,269
We met by chance and did a gig together.

858
00:53:09,352 --> 00:53:12,105
He somehow came to the cafe
to fill in for someone,

859
00:53:12,188 --> 00:53:14,524
-and the photo shoot was by chance?
-Yes.

860
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:15,692
Why didn't you tell me?

861
00:53:15,775 --> 00:53:19,029
I was going to tell you right away,
but you hung up, so…

862
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:25,827
Then what about you?

863
00:53:25,911 --> 00:53:28,204
Do you report to me
every time you meet someone?

864
00:53:28,288 --> 00:53:29,122
What?

865
00:53:29,205 --> 00:53:31,374
I was getting paid,
so I did as I was told.

866
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:33,710
I hate your constant involvement
with Seo-jun.

867
00:53:33,793 --> 00:53:35,128
I hate all these rumors too.

868
00:53:35,211 --> 00:53:37,672
-You know we're just friends.
-How do you how he…

869
00:53:40,216 --> 00:53:42,010
Men and women can't just be friends.

870
00:53:45,722 --> 00:53:46,681
Then what about you?

871
00:53:48,224 --> 00:53:49,893
Aren't you and Su-jin old friends?

872
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:51,895
Why would you bring her up?

873
00:54:11,164 --> 00:54:14,709
Even if I see you walking around
while carrying heavy objects,

874
00:54:14,793 --> 00:54:16,920
I'm never going to help you. You know why?

875
00:54:17,504 --> 00:54:19,673
I've decided not to care
about you anymore.

876
00:54:20,256 --> 00:54:21,341
Whatever.

877
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:23,760
It won't do.

878
00:54:25,261 --> 00:54:27,222
I still can't bear to see you struggle.

879
00:54:27,889 --> 00:54:29,182
Give it here. I'll carry it.

880
00:54:29,265 --> 00:54:30,684
No thanks. It's heavy.

881
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:31,893
That's why I'm offering.

882
00:54:31,977 --> 00:54:33,061
It's really heavy.

883
00:54:33,144 --> 00:54:34,771
I'm not going to say it again.

884
00:54:34,854 --> 00:54:35,855
I've got this.

885
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:52,706
Well, that was…

886
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:54,874
The sound you just heard is…

887
00:54:58,628 --> 00:54:59,671
Great job.

888
00:55:00,255 --> 00:55:02,716
Holding in a fart isn't healthy.

889
00:55:13,268 --> 00:55:15,145
I've decided to let you go,

890
00:55:15,228 --> 00:55:17,355
so why would you give me
that pretty smile?

891
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:24,237
Read the dialogue
between the two students.

892
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:27,490
With the closed interval minus A, A,

893
00:55:27,574 --> 00:55:31,745
if the graph of the continuous function,
y equals f of x,

894
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:33,747
runs against the y-axis…

895
00:55:44,674 --> 00:55:46,634
-Bye.
-I know.

896
00:55:46,718 --> 00:55:48,178
-Let's go!
-I'm hungry.

897
00:55:48,261 --> 00:55:50,013
-I'm off.
-Okay. See you!

898
00:55:59,355 --> 00:56:00,315
Mr. Han Seo-jun!

899
00:56:01,649 --> 00:56:02,859
Ju-kyung's little brother.

900
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:05,320
Take a swing.

901
00:56:05,403 --> 00:56:06,529
I'll take it beforehand.

902
00:56:07,363 --> 00:56:08,323
What's this nonsense?

903
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:12,202
I'm going to take her away from you.

904
00:56:14,454 --> 00:56:15,330
Hello?

905
00:56:16,915 --> 00:56:17,999
Well…

906
00:56:18,083 --> 00:56:19,292
If you're not up for it,

907
00:56:19,793 --> 00:56:21,795
I'll let you punch me after I'm with her.

908
00:56:23,713 --> 00:56:24,964
That nutcase.

909
00:56:26,633 --> 00:56:27,759
Who are you?

910
00:56:27,842 --> 00:56:30,470
Lim Hee-kyung from Move Entertainment.
We've met before.

911
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:35,475
So you really haven't met
anyone from my company?

912
00:56:35,558 --> 00:56:37,352
I told you I haven't.

913
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:53,076
Director Oh.

914
00:56:54,494 --> 00:56:55,745
I'm in a bit of a rush.

915
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:58,248
-I need to ask you something.
-What is it?

916
00:56:58,331 --> 00:57:01,042
I heard Black Soul's debut song
had been changed urgently.

917
00:57:01,126 --> 00:57:04,754
It coincided perfectly with my transfer
and the termination of my project,

918
00:57:04,838 --> 00:57:05,922
interestingly enough.

919
00:57:06,005 --> 00:57:07,423
Why are you telling me that?

920
00:57:08,007 --> 00:57:09,551
I don't have time for such drivel.

921
00:57:10,176 --> 00:57:12,512
You plagiarized the song
written by Se-yeon and Leo.

922
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:17,684
I checked everything with the producer.
I was told it was on Mr. Lee's orders.

923
00:57:17,767 --> 00:57:19,394
Why are you taking things this far?

924
00:57:19,477 --> 00:57:22,355
Is there a reason why you don't welcome
Se-yeon's tribute album?

925
00:57:26,359 --> 00:57:27,485
Plagiarism?

926
00:57:28,236 --> 00:57:30,864
Why cause a scene over a song
that wasn't even copyrighted?

927
00:57:30,947 --> 00:57:32,115
Let's be honest.

928
00:57:32,198 --> 00:57:34,742
Even if Jeong Se-yeon or Leo
were to make a fuss over it,

929
00:57:34,826 --> 00:57:36,453
who's going to believe them?

930
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:39,539
-Excuse me?
-Unless you want to lose your job,

931
00:57:40,123 --> 00:57:44,544
you better shut your mouth
and quietly do your job, Ms. Lim.

932
00:57:44,627 --> 00:57:46,087
Don't cause unnecessary ruckus.

933
00:57:53,803 --> 00:57:55,972
What? What kind of bastard…

934
00:57:56,055 --> 00:57:57,056
Darn it.

935
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:00,643
Hi, Reporter Choi.

936
00:58:01,394 --> 00:58:04,147
Yes, of course.
I've sent you the publicity materials.

937
00:58:04,731 --> 00:58:05,565
Right.

938
00:58:05,648 --> 00:58:06,608
Wait.

939
00:58:07,108 --> 00:58:08,651
I have something to ask.

940
00:58:08,735 --> 00:58:10,904
It's about Se-yeon's
school bullying article.

941
00:58:11,654 --> 00:58:13,198
Yes. That's it.

942
00:58:24,667 --> 00:58:26,920
Should I tell him how I feel
when I give him this?

943
00:58:27,003 --> 00:58:28,421
I'm meeting with Soo-ho later.

944
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:36,429
What is this?

945
00:58:38,264 --> 00:58:39,098
Darn it.

946
00:58:41,434 --> 00:58:45,480
HEY, JU-KYUNG

947
00:58:47,482 --> 00:58:49,359
Am I in the wrong to be upset?

948
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:01,454
Who is it?

949
00:59:04,457 --> 00:59:05,875
Why are you here at this hour?

950
00:59:05,959 --> 00:59:07,544
Goodness. It's so cold in here.

951
00:59:07,627 --> 00:59:10,755
You don't use your heater, do you?
I told you to use it.

952
00:59:11,923 --> 00:59:13,007
It's so heavy.

953
00:59:13,967 --> 00:59:15,051
What is it?

954
00:59:15,134 --> 00:59:17,512
I asked my mom
and got you some side dishes.

955
00:59:17,595 --> 00:59:21,224
Your dad asked me to take care of you,
so I can't just pretend not to have heard.

956
00:59:21,307 --> 00:59:22,433
You didn't have to.

957
00:59:23,268 --> 00:59:24,477
I rarely eat at home.

958
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:27,480
There's gratitude for you.
Just throw away the leftovers.

959
00:59:29,649 --> 00:59:30,567
Are you not leaving?

960
00:59:31,734 --> 00:59:33,069
Gosh, you're heartless.

961
00:59:33,152 --> 00:59:35,572
It's been a while since I visited
and you don't even offer me water?

962
00:59:37,490 --> 00:59:38,324
Typical.

963
00:59:40,034 --> 00:59:42,370
How has nothing changed here?

964
00:59:44,622 --> 00:59:46,332
That painting's still here?

965
00:59:55,008 --> 00:59:56,843
GIRLFRIEND

966
01:00:05,977 --> 01:00:07,604
-Hey…
-Hello?

967
01:00:18,531 --> 01:00:19,782
Drink this and leave.

968
01:00:24,287 --> 01:00:25,997
Relax, I'm not moving in here.

969
01:00:29,334 --> 01:00:30,335
Here.

970
01:00:31,377 --> 01:00:32,462
What's this?

971
01:00:32,545 --> 01:00:34,589
A gift. I'm not sure if you'll like it.

972
01:00:34,672 --> 01:00:35,798
What is this for?

973
01:00:35,882 --> 01:00:37,342
Well, as a thank you.

974
01:00:37,425 --> 01:00:40,053
Just take it.
Am I not even allowed to get you a gift?

975
01:00:48,561 --> 01:00:50,938
We've never exchanged gifts
to thank each other.

976
01:00:51,022 --> 01:00:52,482
And you came here just for this?

977
01:00:53,107 --> 01:00:53,941
At this hour?

978
01:00:54,692 --> 01:00:56,402
I'm not here just to give you this.

979
01:00:57,236 --> 01:00:58,738
I came here because I missed you.

980
01:01:01,449 --> 01:01:02,617
Lately, I've begun…

981
01:01:03,785 --> 01:01:04,994
to care about you.

982
01:01:07,664 --> 01:01:08,998
I can't accept it then.

983
01:01:10,541 --> 01:01:11,459
You should keep it.

984
01:01:11,542 --> 01:01:14,170
Why? You don't like it?
Should I get it exchanged?

985
01:01:14,253 --> 01:01:15,505
I have a girlfriend.

986
01:01:17,465 --> 01:01:18,383
And?

987
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:20,843
So what?

988
01:01:21,594 --> 01:01:22,470
Well…

989
01:01:25,098 --> 01:01:26,474
Come on.

990
01:01:26,557 --> 01:01:28,851
One might think
I said I have feelings for you.

991
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:30,770
Why are you overreacting?

992
01:01:30,853 --> 01:01:33,022
Anyway, you have a girlfriend? Who is it?

993
01:01:33,106 --> 01:01:34,273
I'll tell you later.

994
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:37,110
It's getting late. Go home now.

995
01:02:05,304 --> 01:02:07,515
KANG.S.J. UPLOADED A NEW PICTURE

996
01:02:25,158 --> 01:02:28,035
BOYFRIEND

997
01:02:35,209 --> 01:02:36,377
Hello?

998
01:02:37,128 --> 01:02:38,045
Hi.

999
01:02:38,796 --> 01:02:39,630
It's me.

1000
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:41,716
Hey.

1001
01:02:43,551 --> 01:02:44,552
Did I wake you?

1002
01:02:46,596 --> 01:02:47,472
No.

1003
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:51,434
What have you been up to?

1004
01:02:51,517 --> 01:02:52,518
Nothing.

1005
01:02:54,228 --> 01:02:55,563
I've just been at home.

1006
01:03:01,694 --> 01:03:02,779
Earlier at school…

1007
01:03:02,862 --> 01:03:04,906
I'm a little tired. Let's talk tomorrow.

1008
01:03:05,573 --> 01:03:06,657
Hanging up now.

1009
01:03:20,463 --> 01:03:25,051
GIRLFRIEND

1010
01:03:26,177 --> 01:03:27,178
Good night.

1011
01:03:35,686 --> 01:03:36,979
Your coffee is ready.

1012
01:03:51,536 --> 01:03:52,662
Ju-kyung.

1013
01:03:53,371 --> 01:03:54,956
Hey, I'm not in the mood.

1014
01:03:55,873 --> 01:03:56,707
I'm sorry.

1015
01:04:01,546 --> 01:04:04,131
-I said, stop.
-"I said, stop."

1016
01:04:05,508 --> 01:04:07,343
-Come on, stop it.
-"Come on, stop it."

1017
01:04:09,178 --> 01:04:11,430
-What's with you today?
-Smile a little.

1018
01:04:21,148 --> 01:04:22,024
Why are you here?

1019
01:04:22,108 --> 01:04:23,442
Am I not allowed here?

1020
01:04:25,611 --> 01:04:27,154
You said he was filling in that day,

1021
01:04:27,238 --> 01:04:28,197
yet here he is again.

1022
01:04:28,990 --> 01:04:31,659
The boss asked him to come.
The other part-timer quit.

1023
01:04:31,742 --> 01:04:33,452
Your boyfriend runs a tight ship.

1024
01:04:34,203 --> 01:04:36,372
-I feel like being interrogated.
-Can we talk?

1025
01:04:36,455 --> 01:04:37,790
I'm working right now.

1026
01:04:37,874 --> 01:04:39,041
Then I'll wait.

1027
01:04:40,334 --> 01:04:41,377
Something cold, please.

1028
01:04:42,086 --> 01:04:43,713
You're going to sit and watch us?

1029
01:04:43,796 --> 01:04:44,881
This is obsessive.

1030
01:04:44,964 --> 01:04:46,966
This is about us. You stay out of it.

1031
01:04:47,758 --> 01:04:49,886
I'll let you know when I'm done.

1032
01:04:49,969 --> 01:04:51,971
-Am I bothering you?
-No, it's not that…

1033
01:04:55,266 --> 01:04:56,100
All right.

1034
01:04:56,642 --> 01:04:57,935
I'll wait outside.

1035
01:04:58,644 --> 01:04:59,979
Let me know when you're done.

1036
01:05:10,364 --> 01:05:11,240
You should just go.

1037
01:05:12,116 --> 01:05:13,034
What?

1038
01:05:13,743 --> 01:05:16,370
-I couldn't do that.
-It's not busy today, so I'll manage.

1039
01:05:17,663 --> 01:05:19,749
So go have a fight or make up with him.

1040
01:05:19,832 --> 01:05:21,709
Don't make me feel uncomfortable as well.

1041
01:05:22,710 --> 01:05:23,711
I'm sorry.

1042
01:05:41,103 --> 01:05:42,855
I want to get my eyes done.

1043
01:05:42,939 --> 01:05:45,566
No. Then your eyes wouldn't look as sexy.

1044
01:05:45,650 --> 01:05:47,443
-My eyes look sexy?
-Yes, they do.

1045
01:05:47,526 --> 01:05:49,028
-Really.
-My cheekbones, then?

1046
01:05:49,111 --> 01:05:51,530
-No. Then you won't look as cute.
-Gosh.

1047
01:05:51,614 --> 01:05:54,367
Then, the back corner of my eyes?
Then what would I lose?

1048
01:05:56,661 --> 01:05:57,620
Welcome.

1049
01:05:57,703 --> 01:05:59,622
-Hi, Han Seo-jun.
-Hi.

1050
01:06:02,083 --> 01:06:04,710
-Lee Sung-yong's girlfriend.
-I broke up with him long ago.

1051
01:06:04,794 --> 01:06:05,878
-They broke up.
-They broke up.

1052
01:06:05,962 --> 01:06:06,796
Just order.

1053
01:06:06,879 --> 01:06:09,090
-I want something light.
-Try the avocado.

1054
01:06:10,466 --> 01:06:12,301
I came to give you this.

1055
01:06:15,429 --> 01:06:16,597
I thought I lost this.

1056
01:06:18,474 --> 01:06:19,600
How did you get this?

1057
01:06:20,184 --> 01:06:22,228
I did you a favor.
What's with the attitude?

1058
01:06:23,062 --> 01:06:23,938
By the way,

1059
01:06:24,563 --> 01:06:25,982
the girl who just walked out.

1060
01:06:26,065 --> 01:06:28,401
She's Lim Ju-kyung
from Saebom High School, right?

1061
01:06:28,484 --> 01:06:29,610
-Lim Ju-kyung?
-Lim Ju-kyung?

1062
01:06:30,403 --> 01:06:31,737
So what if she is?

1063
01:06:32,697 --> 01:06:33,531
Nothing.

1064
01:06:34,031 --> 01:06:35,074
I'm just asking.

1065
01:06:35,992 --> 01:06:37,118
Do you work with her?

1066
01:06:37,201 --> 01:06:38,327
Are you going to order?

1067
01:06:38,411 --> 01:06:39,286
One affocato.

1068
01:06:39,370 --> 01:06:40,788
Give her an avocado, please.

1069
01:06:40,871 --> 01:06:42,581
It's called an "affogato."

1070
01:06:42,665 --> 01:06:44,625
-Affocato.
-It's avocado.

1071
01:06:54,802 --> 01:06:55,720
Hey.

1072
01:06:57,138 --> 01:06:58,597
What did you want to talk about?

1073
01:06:58,681 --> 01:06:59,807
Let's tell people…

1074
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:02,351
that we're dating.

1075
01:07:03,060 --> 01:07:04,103
I'm going to tell them.

1076
01:07:04,186 --> 01:07:05,312
Why all of a sudden?

1077
01:07:05,396 --> 01:07:07,106
I don't want to hide it anymore.

1078
01:07:07,189 --> 01:07:08,649
You said it was okay.

1079
01:07:09,525 --> 01:07:10,359
Why?

1080
01:07:11,444 --> 01:07:12,361
You don't want to?

1081
01:07:13,612 --> 01:07:14,488
I'm still…

1082
01:07:15,740 --> 01:07:17,033
not comfortable with it.

1083
01:07:17,116 --> 01:07:19,827
So you're uncomfortable
with people knowing about us,

1084
01:07:19,910 --> 01:07:21,787
but okay with people thinking
you're with Seo-jun?

1085
01:07:21,871 --> 01:07:22,872
That's not what I meant.

1086
01:07:22,955 --> 01:07:24,832
If you two have to keep working together,

1087
01:07:25,624 --> 01:07:26,876
you should quit your job.

1088
01:07:26,959 --> 01:07:28,335
Why should I do that?

1089
01:07:28,419 --> 01:07:29,462
Because I don't like it.

1090
01:07:29,545 --> 01:07:31,547
I don't like you two talking,

1091
01:07:31,630 --> 01:07:33,132
much less locking eyes.

1092
01:07:33,215 --> 01:07:35,134
That's a problem between you two, not me.

1093
01:07:35,217 --> 01:07:36,218
Exactly.

1094
01:07:36,302 --> 01:07:38,888
You know how things are,
so why do you still hang out with him?

1095
01:07:38,971 --> 01:07:41,640
So I can't have friends or a job
without your approval?

1096
01:07:42,141 --> 01:07:44,435
Then can you drop anything
that I don't approve of?

1097
01:07:44,518 --> 01:07:46,187
Even throw away your friends?

1098
01:07:46,270 --> 01:07:47,229
What if I can?

1099
01:07:49,231 --> 01:07:51,108
Must be nice for it to be so easy.

1100
01:07:55,237 --> 01:07:56,155
Then if I told you…

1101
01:07:56,947 --> 01:07:58,783
I can't tell people we're dating

1102
01:07:59,658 --> 01:08:02,161
and I can't quit my job, what then?

1103
01:08:03,788 --> 01:08:04,830
What?

1104
01:08:05,498 --> 01:08:06,999
Then we can't see each other?

1105
01:08:08,417 --> 01:08:09,919
What is that supposed to mean?

1106
01:08:14,799 --> 01:08:15,800
Ju-kyung.

1107
01:08:15,883 --> 01:08:16,801
Ju-kyung!

1108
01:08:57,842 --> 01:08:59,343
Welcome home, Ju-kyung.

1109
01:09:48,851 --> 01:09:51,395
Hey, those rookies
from Move Entertainment debuted today.

1110
01:09:51,478 --> 01:09:52,938
But they changed the title song.

1111
01:09:53,022 --> 01:09:55,149
It's totally different
from the highlight they released.

1112
01:09:55,232 --> 01:09:57,359
Really? That's crazy. Let me hear it.

1113
01:10:00,654 --> 01:10:01,864
Nice.

1114
01:10:01,947 --> 01:10:02,823
I like this better.

1115
01:10:02,907 --> 01:10:04,200
So cool, right?

1116
01:10:04,825 --> 01:10:06,869
They're good-looking.

1117
01:10:12,958 --> 01:10:16,170
MOVE ENTERTAINMENT'S BLACK SOUL
WITH THEIR DEBUT RELEASE "STARLIGHT"

1118
01:10:30,559 --> 01:10:31,435
The person you are…

1119
01:10:41,278 --> 01:10:43,197
I like the cool and chic vibe. One, two!

1120
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:44,990
Okay, I'll get closer. Two!

1121
01:10:45,074 --> 01:10:46,492
All right, three.

1122
01:10:47,409 --> 01:10:50,287
That's nice. I love it.

1123
01:10:50,371 --> 01:10:52,331
One, two. Shift a bit.

1124
01:10:53,165 --> 01:10:54,375
That's it.

1125
01:10:56,335 --> 01:10:59,421
All right, Seo-jun, that looks nice.

1126
01:11:02,925 --> 01:11:03,926
Okay.

1127
01:11:04,510 --> 01:11:06,011
Yes, more.

1128
01:11:08,097 --> 01:11:09,431
What the heck?

1129
01:11:14,770 --> 01:11:15,980
-Jeez.
-What is it?

1130
01:11:16,063 --> 01:11:17,898
Hey, where are you going? Han Seo-jun!

1131
01:11:24,238 --> 01:11:26,198
-What can I do for…
-Is Mr. Lee in?

1132
01:11:28,033 --> 01:11:29,243
Okay, understood.

1133
01:11:29,326 --> 01:11:30,286
Sir.

1134
01:11:30,369 --> 01:11:33,122
-What is it?
-Did you really have to take it this far?

1135
01:11:33,789 --> 01:11:37,126
-Ms. Lim, what do you think you're doing?
-I get why you wouldn't like it.

1136
01:11:37,209 --> 01:11:39,962
People talking about Se-yeon again.

1137
01:11:40,879 --> 01:11:44,800
But still, you'd steal a song from him
just to hide your own wrongdoing?

1138
01:11:47,636 --> 01:11:48,637
What is she saying?

1139
01:11:48,721 --> 01:11:50,014
It's nothing, sir.

1140
01:11:52,057 --> 01:11:55,311
Do you think he has time to deal
with every new artist?

1141
01:11:55,394 --> 01:11:56,812
Come on. Let's talk outside.

1142
01:11:56,895 --> 01:11:59,231
Let go. I said, let go of me!

1143
01:12:10,284 --> 01:12:12,953
Just to hide a picture of you
taken with a young actress,

1144
01:12:13,037 --> 01:12:14,913
you ran stories about Se-yeon's bullying.

1145
01:12:15,998 --> 01:12:18,917
If you actually felt bad
for Se-yeon's death,

1146
01:12:19,001 --> 01:12:20,502
you shouldn't have done this.

1147
01:12:21,295 --> 01:12:24,423
Even if the copyright isn't registered,
this is clearly plagiarism!

1148
01:12:26,675 --> 01:12:30,304
How dare you come into my office
and speak such nonsense!

1149
01:12:31,347 --> 01:12:32,181
Get her out.

1150
01:12:33,515 --> 01:12:34,350
Get out!

1151
01:12:34,433 --> 01:12:37,811
Se-yeon and Leo are only 18.

1152
01:12:37,895 --> 01:12:40,022
You even have a son yourself.

1153
01:12:40,105 --> 01:12:42,983
If you feel even the slightest guilt
toward kids your son's age,

1154
01:12:43,067 --> 01:12:45,069
take the song down and make things right.

1155
01:12:46,487 --> 01:12:48,614
Rather than having it revealed
by my whistleblowing,

1156
01:12:48,697 --> 01:12:50,783
it would look much better
if you dealt with it yourself.

1157
01:12:55,329 --> 01:12:56,163
So,

1158
01:12:56,997 --> 01:12:58,665
are you blackmailing me?

1159
01:12:59,917 --> 01:13:01,627
Think of it however you want.

1160
01:13:02,252 --> 01:13:04,463
I said what I said, at the risk of my job.

1161
01:13:04,546 --> 01:13:06,507
Get out. Have you gone mad?

1162
01:13:06,590 --> 01:13:08,467
I'll get out myself.

1163
01:13:25,567 --> 01:13:26,402
Soo-ho.

1164
01:13:30,864 --> 01:13:31,865
Soo-ho.

1165
01:14:01,228 --> 01:14:02,396
Hey, Lee Soo-ho!

1166
01:14:03,063 --> 01:14:04,231
Did you hear?

1167
01:14:04,314 --> 01:14:06,066
The new song that came out from Move--

1168
01:14:07,359 --> 01:14:08,402
That punk.

1169
01:14:08,485 --> 01:14:09,319
Hey!

1170
01:14:09,820 --> 01:14:10,946
Lee Soo-ho!

1171
01:15:21,433 --> 01:15:23,894
What's wrong with me?

1172
01:15:23,977 --> 01:15:25,771
Things keep getting messed up,

1173
01:15:26,355 --> 01:15:28,815
and I end up hurting people
for no good reason.

1174
01:15:30,359 --> 01:15:32,528
There's someone called
Lim Ju-kyung at your school.

1175
01:15:33,278 --> 01:15:35,405
Why did you do that? That was nothing!

1176
01:15:35,489 --> 01:15:38,325
-Soo-ho!
-Do you know how much I suffered?

1177
01:15:38,408 --> 01:15:40,160
I came to give you a hug.

1178
01:15:41,245 --> 01:15:43,539
Why didn't you tell me back then?

1179
01:15:44,414 --> 01:15:45,874
Lim Ju-kyung!

1180
01:15:45,958 --> 01:15:47,626
She transferred from Yongpa High School.

1181
01:15:49,586 --> 01:15:54,591
