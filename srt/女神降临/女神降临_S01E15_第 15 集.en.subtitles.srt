1
00:01:05,356 --> 00:01:06,191
I'm here…

2
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:10,320
BASED ON WEBTOON TRUE BEAUTY
BY YAONGYI

3
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:12,280
Dad.

4
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:24,501
I'm sorry.

5
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:28,963
I'm sorry, Soo-ho.

6
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:30,924
I thought

7
00:01:32,091 --> 00:01:33,510
I wouldn't get to…

8
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:37,263
tell you that.

9
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:41,017
It's okay.

10
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:16,052
Dad,

11
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,388
you need to eat.

12
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,558
Here.

13
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:31,818
I promised…

14
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:35,655
to get you a nice meal.

15
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:39,325
We can get something
when you're all better.

16
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,000
Something delicious.

17
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:00,221
ALARM 3:00 AM

18
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:04,100
GIRLFRIEND

19
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:08,605
Were you up?
Isn't it the middle of the night there?

20
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:12,150
I was studying.
I'm going to be a senior soon.

21
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:14,068
-Are you at the airport?
-Not yet.

22
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:16,321
I'll stop at the hospital
to see Dad discharged,

23
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:17,530
then go to the airport.

24
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:19,115
Are you flying in with your dad?

25
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:21,034
No, I'm coming in first.

26
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:25,288
He shouldn't travel far at the moment.
He'll come in once he's fully rested.

27
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:27,457
I see.

28
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:32,086
It's been a month
since we've seen each other.

29
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:33,588
Right.

30
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:36,216
I miss you.

31
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:40,220
-I'll come meet you at the airport.
-It's fine.

32
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:43,056
I'll head to you as soon as I arrive.
Don't come out.

33
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,226
No, I'll see you tomorrow…
I mean, see you later.

34
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:47,143
All right.

35
00:04:17,465 --> 00:04:18,383
Dad!

36
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:20,260
Dad!

37
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:22,345
Dad!

38
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:23,805
Dad!

39
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:03,821
-Hey, Savior Tae-hoon.
-Hey, Hyun-kyu Almighty.

40
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:05,573
-Let's have a good year.
-Yes, let's.

41
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:07,700
You got handsome.

42
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,786
-Ju-kyung, are you in class six too?
-Yes.

43
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,788
-This feels very familiar.
-Right.

44
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,289
Let's all have a good year.

45
00:06:13,372 --> 00:06:15,666
-One, two, three. Let's go!
-Let's go!

46
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,043
Hi, I'm Yoo Tae-hoon.

47
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:18,294
I'm Hyun-kyu Almighty.

48
00:06:18,377 --> 00:06:19,212
Limju!

49
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:25,384
-Hey, you're here.
-Yes.

50
00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:28,930
Right, Ju-kyung,

51
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:30,807
Su-jin dropped out of school
over the break.

52
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:33,267
What? Seriously?

53
00:06:34,393 --> 00:06:35,895
I heard she went to study abroad.

54
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:39,941
By the way, are you doing okay?

55
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:42,360
Did you hear when Soo-ho will be back?

56
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:45,404
No, I haven't heard anything yet.

57
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:55,123
Why is it so cold?

58
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:08,970
How's your dad?

59
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:10,388
He's the same.

60
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:11,848
Did you get some sleep?

61
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:52,930
Ju-kyung, it's time for school--

62
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:54,724
My stomach…

63
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:56,058
Ju-kyung!

64
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:58,352
What's wrong?

65
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:00,188
You're sweating so much! What hurts?

66
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:02,648
-My stomach.
-Your stomach?

67
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:04,525
Goodness, what do I do?

68
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:07,487
What do I do? Gosh.

69
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:08,571
Does it hurt a lot?

70
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:24,712
GIRLFRIEND

71
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,677
BOYFRIEND

72
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:36,182
Hey, Soo-ho.

73
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:37,391
How have you been?

74
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:39,560
All right, how have you been?

75
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:41,020
Well, I'm just…

76
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:43,606
By the way, where's Ju-kyung?

77
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:47,193
We're at the hospital
because Ju-kyung's ill.

78
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:49,153
She's ill? Where?

79
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:52,323
Calm down, it's not serious.
She has an upset stomach.

80
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:54,909
She must have been stressed
with all of her studies this year.

81
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:58,412
Can I speak to her?

82
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:01,249
I'm sorry, but I can't. She's asleep.

83
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:05,253
By the way, how's your dad?

84
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,338
He's not well yet.

85
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:09,507
I see.

86
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:11,759
It must be hard for you
to handle it all alone.

87
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,595
I'll tell her to give you a call
when she's up.

88
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:17,598
Thank you.

89
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,542
Hey, Soo-ho.

90
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:47,628
It feels like we haven't talked
in a long time.

91
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:48,713
Right.

92
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:50,506
Are you doing okay?

93
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,466
Of course, I am…

94
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,051
I'm actually better than okay.

95
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:57,513
I got my national license certification.

96
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:00,600
That's great.

97
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:01,684
Right?

98
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:04,687
Ju-kyung.

99
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:05,688
Yes?

100
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:09,275
We…

101
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:12,361
should break up.

102
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:15,031
What?

103
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,992
Waiting on my dad
without knowing when he'll wake up…

104
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:21,120
must be hard for you too.

105
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:27,585
What are you talking about?

106
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:33,382
It's not hard for me at all.

107
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:37,345
I can wait. It's all right.

108
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:39,722
I feel bad.

109
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:43,309
I can't even be there for you.

110
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,021
I feel so bad.

111
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:49,607
That's why.

112
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,652
Who asked you to feel bad for me?

113
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:55,279
I said I'm fine. Why are you doing this?

114
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:02,578
I don't want to break up.

115
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:04,747
It's okay if you have to
stay there forever.

116
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:07,166
I'll make money to fly back and forth.

117
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,420
I couldn't let you do that.

118
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:13,547
Why not?

119
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:20,429
Do well in school.

120
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:23,641
Don't wait for my calls anymore.

121
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:27,395
Sleep well.

122
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:30,272
Stop it.

123
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:33,776
Don't say it like it's our last time.

124
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:37,947
I didn't hear anything.

125
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:40,991
This call never happened.

126
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:49,351
PRINCE COMICS

127
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:52,938
Hey.

128
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:54,857
What? Hey, Ju-bal.

129
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:56,984
Why are you throwing these out?

130
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:59,862
They're too old,
so I thought I'd get new ones.

131
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:02,490
Come in.

132
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:53,123
Ta-da!

133
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:57,211
I got it with my part-time pay.
It's our first matching item.

134
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:02,883
Aren't they cute?

135
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:30,160
I'm Lee Soo-ho, not a crybaby.

136
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:34,415
When will you remember me?

137
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:40,713
I'm going to go to Namsan
to make a wish upon the first snow

138
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:43,549
that you'll remember me.

139
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:46,051
What?

140
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:51,682
You should have told me.

141
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:54,768
How could I have known?

142
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:24,715
They say

143
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:27,843
that touching the first snow
will make your wish come true.

144
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:31,472
Then anyone who's touched
the first snow should be happy.

145
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:33,599
But why are there so many unhappy people?

146
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,643
My dad is still out of work.

147
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:39,063
-I can't believe you believe that.
-It couldn't have come out of nowhere.

148
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:41,982
I've thought about it

149
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:44,151
and concluded that the wish is granted

150
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:46,570
to the very first person
who touches the first snow.

151
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:48,697
Nonsense.

152
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:51,659
So when it first snows this year,

153
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:54,703
I'm going to the highest place
to touch it first.

154
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,456
The highest place?

155
00:15:57,539 --> 00:15:59,792
-Will you be on a plane or--
-I'm going to Namsan.

156
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,085
What?

157
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:03,128
Namsan is the highest place in Seoul.

158
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:04,838
Whatever you say.

159
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:06,090
You'll see.

160
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:08,926
If my wish comes true, I'm right, okay?

161
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:22,106
I'M LEE SOO-HO, NOT A CRYBABY!

162
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:24,274
WHEN WILL YOU REMEMBER ME?

163
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:27,069
I'M GOING TO GO TO NAMSAN
TO MAKE A WISH UPON THE FIRST SNOW

164
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:29,405
THAT YOU'LL REMEMBER ME

165
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:34,368
How did you remember all those things?

166
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:43,293
FIRST SNOW

167
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:46,839
You're so clever.

2021 COLLEGE SCHOLASTIC ABILITY TEST

169
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:42,895
I…

170
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:45,355
took the CSAT today.

171
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:48,525
If I do well on the practical test,

172
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:51,653
I'll be able to go
to the college of my choice.

173
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:56,408
I guess this is what it feels like
to get closer to one's dream.

174
00:17:58,035 --> 00:17:59,536
It's exciting, and I love it.

175
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:05,125
I wonder if you started
studying music over there.

176
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:07,753
One day,

177
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:10,422
somewhere,

178
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:14,343
if I can hear the music you made,
I'll be so glad.

179
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:22,601
I've been texting you using the stress
from the CSAT as an excuse,

180
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:27,189
but I can't do that anymore
now that the CSAT is over.

181
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:30,609
Soo-ho,

182
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,112
it's snowing here.

183
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:38,617
I hope the place you're in

184
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,078
is not cold but warm.

185
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:49,128
I won't

186
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:51,296
contact you anymore.

187
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:56,510
Bye.

188
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:05,561
Che-ni, please smile.

189
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:08,272
-You look so pretty.
-Gosh, you look great.

190
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:09,731
Che-ni, swish your hair.

191
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:11,859
You look so nice, Che-ni.

192
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:12,818
That's great.

193
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:15,737
-Can you fix her hair?
-Yes!

194
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:22,202
Sit over here.

195
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:24,121
Here you go.

196
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:25,455
-Mouthwash.
-Got it.

197
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:35,007
Face mist.

198
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:39,261
-I'm going to spray now.
-Sure.

199
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:45,267
Right, Ju-kyung.

200
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,853
When are you going
to set me up with Seo-jun?

201
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:53,483
Well, he's still a trainee.

202
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:56,486
He says he's not in a state
to meet anyone.

203
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,822
Don't you see him
more often than I do at work?

204
00:19:58,906 --> 00:19:59,740
I mean,

205
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:01,366
I can try hinting once or twice,

206
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,994
but I can't lower myself to hit on him
every single time.

207
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:05,537
I hear you two are really close.

208
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:07,789
Set the two of us up, okay?

209
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:12,127
Speaking of which,
ask him right now. Please.

210
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,837
-Right now?
-Yes, please?

211
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:15,923
Please? I beg of you. Just once.

212
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:17,716
Just a moment.

213
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:23,555
She nags me every time she sees me.

214
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:26,350
Please just meet with her once.
I'll treat you to a meal.

215
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:27,768
Can't be bothered.

216
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:29,978
Just have one meal with her. Please?

217
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:31,980
Ju-kyung!

218
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:35,651
-What did Seo-jun say?
-Well…

219
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:39,363
He must be busy right now.
He's not texting back.

220
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:48,163
No. I hate her type.

221
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:51,500
-Oh, no!
-What's wrong?

222
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:54,753
-What do I do?
-This is from a luxury brand sponsor!

223
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:57,047
-You should have been careful.
-It's actually…

224
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,423
You should have.

225
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:01,426
I told you not to get
anything on the dress!

226
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:03,929
Seriously, what do we do now?

227
00:21:04,012 --> 00:21:06,306
I'm sorry.

228
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:09,518
Ju-kyung! You can't replace this
even with a year's worth of your pay.

229
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:11,186
What are you going to do?

230
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:14,564
-It's not coming off. What do we do?
-Goodness, what do we do?

231
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:19,528
Ju-kyung, put in a good word
to Seo-jun for me.

232
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:20,654
Got it?

233
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:23,490
It's all right, everyone.

234
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:28,161
I'll have it sorted out with my company.
Just get me out of this. It feels gross.

235
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:29,913
-Thanks.
-You're an angel.

236
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:32,207
-Let's go.
-Don't be too harsh on her.

237
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,918
-It feels so gross!
-Let's go.

238
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:36,753
-I'll be here.
-It's icky.

239
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:41,049
Jeez.

240
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:44,303
-Bottoms up!
-Bottoms up!

241
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:46,138
-Saebom High forever!
-All right!

242
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:49,599
If she likes him that much,
she should get him herself.

243
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:53,020
Why does she have to bother me about him?

244
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:56,023
You said her staff changes every month
due to her horrible personality.

245
00:21:56,106 --> 00:22:00,485
If Seo-jun went on one date with Che-ni,
you'd have a much easier time at work.

246
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:01,820
Why can't he do that for you?

247
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:04,906
I can't force him to meet someone
when he doesn't want to.

248
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:07,492
But it's really wearing me out.

249
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:11,204
Hey, Tae-hoon,
why did you ask to see us all?

250
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:14,207
My Hye-min and I were going to
catch a move.

251
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:16,209
Right, babe?

252
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:18,628
"Right, babe"?

253
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:20,464
Sure, darling.

254
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:21,798
Don't rile us singles up.

255
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:22,758
Why?

256
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:25,135
What happened to that girl you were into?
Rejected again?

257
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:26,386
Rejected?

258
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,263
Why? Are you happy
that I'm not seeing anyone?

259
00:22:28,346 --> 00:22:30,140
Don't get clingy when you dumped me.

260
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:31,641
What are you saying?

261
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:33,060
In your dreams!

262
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:35,979
Hey,

263
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:40,150
I asked you to come here this evening
to make an important announcement.

264
00:22:42,235 --> 00:22:43,278
-What?
-What is it?

265
00:22:43,361 --> 00:22:44,738
-What's up?
-Hey, what is it?

266
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:46,948
-I…
-What the heck?

267
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:50,744
am entering the military service
next month with Hyun-kyu.

268
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:52,370
-What?
-Really?

269
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:54,247
-Military?
-When?

270
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:56,333
Hyun-kyu and I decided to enlist together,

271
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:58,668
so please cheer for us.

272
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:00,003
-Salute.
-Salute.

273
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:01,421
-Salute.
-Salute.

274
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:04,591
Sorry, my friend.

275
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:06,968
-I didn't apply.
-What?

276
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:09,179
I got a girlfriend.

277
00:23:09,262 --> 00:23:10,722
-No way!
-That's crazy!

278
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:15,060
One girl found her way
into my heart recently.

279
00:23:15,143 --> 00:23:17,229
Anyway, I won't be joining the military.

280
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:19,231
This is highly unexpected.

281
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:20,607
-Who's the girl?
-Damn it!

282
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:22,692
But you promised me, you traitor!

283
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:29,074
Hey, how can I make her wait for me
as soon as we started dating?

284
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:31,535
I knew something was up
as soon as I saw your hair.

285
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:32,744
Come here, you!

286
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:35,747
-Hey, get me scissors!
-Stop it, Tae-hoon!

287
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:38,041
-I trusted you with…
-Stop, that's enough!

288
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:41,378
Why would you enlist together
when you bicker like this?

289
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:44,047
Let's all have a drink. Cheers!

290
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:46,049
Whatever!

291
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:49,052
This is all useless.

292
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:52,889
Ju-kyung's out.

293
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:54,850
Hey, Limju, are you asleep?

294
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:55,767
Limju!

295
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:56,935
Hey, is he coming?

296
00:23:57,018 --> 00:23:59,855
He should be here to take care of her.
Where is he?

297
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:03,108
He's here. Hey, over here!

298
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:07,821
Guys,

299
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:10,073
who got her this drunk?

300
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:12,033
-She did it to herself.
-Don't blame us.

301
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:13,743
-It's unfair.
-She drank it herself.

302
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:15,203
Ju-kyung.

303
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:16,371
Ju-kyung!

304
00:24:16,454 --> 00:24:17,289
I'm here.

305
00:24:19,332 --> 00:24:20,667
Wake up.

306
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:27,591
-You're here.
-I am.

307
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:47,652
-Seo-jun.
-Yes.

308
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:51,198
Why?

309
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:52,490
I'm going to kill you.

310
00:24:53,074 --> 00:24:56,036
I'm getting tortured by Che-ni all day
because of you!

311
00:24:57,245 --> 00:24:58,663
Hey, what are you doing?

312
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:00,248
-You could hurt yourself!
-Leave him.

313
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:01,374
Let's all die together!

314
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:03,501
-You're dead.
-Can you pour me some?

315
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:04,461
Pour some.

316
00:25:04,544 --> 00:25:06,171
-Go faster.
-Come on!

317
00:25:06,254 --> 00:25:07,881
-Who is it?
-Who is it?

318
00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:10,508
Be careful! They've gone nuts.

319
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:14,179
Knock, knock. Please let me go home.

320
00:25:14,262 --> 00:25:17,474
-She's drunk!
-You guys are drunk too!

321
00:25:17,557 --> 00:25:18,808
Hey, you.

322
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:20,143
-You…
-Ju-kyung.

323
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:22,229
-You look pretty cute.
-Let's go!

324
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:27,817
Hey, I'll take her to her place.
You all go for another round.

325
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:29,319
-Sure. Bye!
-Yup!

326
00:25:29,402 --> 00:25:30,320
-Bye!
-Take care.

327
00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:33,073
-You have to join later, okay?
-Where should we go next?

328
00:25:33,156 --> 00:25:34,658
Hey, just get on my back, okay?

329
00:25:34,741 --> 00:25:36,034
No, I'm not drunk.

330
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:37,452
-Don't--
-I can walk.

331
00:25:37,535 --> 00:25:38,578
Okay. Come here.

332
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:40,288
Hey. Wait.

333
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:42,958
-I'm moving, right? I am walking.
-Think again.

334
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:45,210
Get on my back, come on.

335
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:47,796
What? A little octopus!

336
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:51,299
-Little octopus, let's go to the ocean!
-Are you crazy?

337
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:52,968
-Let's go to the ocean!
-Hey!

338
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:54,511
I'll get you out!

339
00:25:55,136 --> 00:25:57,347
-What are you doing with food?
-I'm sorry.

340
00:25:57,430 --> 00:26:00,016
Taxi!

341
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:03,270
-Please take me home.
-Where did she go?

342
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:07,232
-Please take me home.
-What are you doing?

343
00:26:07,315 --> 00:26:09,526
I'm so sorry. Let's go, Ju-kyung.

344
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:11,569
Hey, Ju-kyung, let's go.

345
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:13,446
-Let's go home.
-Ju-kyung, come here.

346
00:26:16,157 --> 00:26:17,450
Hey, I feel sick.

347
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:21,496
Are you sobering up?

348
00:26:23,206 --> 00:26:24,082
No.

349
00:26:24,165 --> 00:26:25,917
There's no way
you would've done that sober.

350
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:28,003
Holding up a live octopus…

351
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,301
Why did you run holding me? I feel sick.

352
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:36,303
Then throw up.

353
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:39,848
No, I can't. That's wasteful.
I'm going to digest it all.

354
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:44,019
I'll be fine if I sit for a bit.

355
00:26:44,644 --> 00:26:46,313
I'm all right.

356
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:48,898
Seo-jun.

357
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:54,612
Han Seo-jun.

358
00:26:57,741 --> 00:26:59,159
What is it?

359
00:26:59,242 --> 00:27:01,661
Can't you meet with Che-ni just once?

360
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:03,872
I already said no.

361
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:07,208
You could make my life a whole lot easier.

362
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:09,669
Grab a meal with her. Just once.

363
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:13,173
-Can you see someone you don't like?
-I didn't ask you to date her.

364
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:14,966
Please stop.

365
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:17,093
Just meet with her once.

366
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:19,929
Don't tell me to meet some other girl.

367
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:22,057
It makes me mad.

368
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:25,727
-Why?
-"Why?"

369
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:30,023
Shouldn't you know how I feel by now?

370
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:52,420
My head.

371
00:28:07,602 --> 00:28:09,145
Hey, Ju-young, get me some water.

372
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:11,064
Don't drink so much.

373
00:28:11,147 --> 00:28:13,191
-You're worse than Hee-kyung.
-What?

374
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:15,568
Watch where you're kicking!

375
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:19,614
Hey, punk. You slept at our place?

376
00:28:19,697 --> 00:28:22,033
He was all sweaty
from carrying you home last night.

377
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:23,034
I couldn't send him off.

378
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:24,994
I'm embarrassed to even look at him!

379
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:27,330
Really?

380
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:29,833
I have no recollection at all
since we left the bar.

381
00:28:33,628 --> 00:28:34,963
I must have blacked out.

382
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:36,172
Are you bragging?

383
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:39,300
I hear you'll debut soon.

384
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:42,095
Yes. We have the concept.
Just need to decide on the title track.

385
00:28:42,178 --> 00:28:43,012
That's huge.

386
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:45,014
Give me the clothes back later
without washing them.

387
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:46,516
When you blow up,

388
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:50,478
I'll sell them online at a high price
as "clothes worn by Han Seo-jun."

389
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:52,856
Why you little…

390
00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:57,652
Anyway, if you make it big,
we might not get to see you as often.

391
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:59,362
No, I'll be visiting all the time.

392
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:00,780
To see Ju-kyung?

393
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:06,369
No, to eat meals prepared by you, sir.

394
00:29:08,621 --> 00:29:10,415
It tastes even better than my mom's.

395
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:12,792
I was good at everything but studying.

396
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:14,919
If you like the young radish,
I could pack some up for you.

397
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:15,920
"Some"?

398
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:18,423
How about a lot?

399
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:22,093
All right, eat up.
I'll pack up a lot for you.

400
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,563
Dad gave you this to eat at your dorm.

401
00:29:33,646 --> 00:29:35,774
-Good luck and bye.
-Hey, Ju-kyung.

402
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:41,446
-What?
-About yesterday.

403
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:43,990
Yesterday? What about it?

404
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:46,618
You really have no memory after the bar?

405
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:48,912
No, I don't.

406
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:51,414
Did I do something stupid?

407
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:52,749
You really don't remember?

408
00:29:52,832 --> 00:29:54,876
Of course! Why would I lie to you?

409
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:56,795
Stop pretending like you don't remember!

410
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:59,255
"Pretending"?
I really don't remember a thing.

411
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:00,340
We kissed.

412
00:30:21,402 --> 00:30:22,237
Let's go.

413
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:27,492
Get on my back.

414
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:34,040
Let's go.

415
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:36,167
Let's go home.

416
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,670
My mom's waiting.

417
00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:41,798
Let's go.

418
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:45,844
Hey, we didn't kiss!

419
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:47,971
How would you know if you don't remember?

420
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:49,931
What?

421
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:52,267
You do remember.

422
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:55,770
That's why you walked on eggshells
around me the whole morning.

423
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:57,438
I've known you for years.

424
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:00,149
Then what do you expect me to do?

425
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:01,526
And so what if I remember?

426
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:03,611
It'll just make things awkward.

427
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:05,488
You were confused after a few drinks--

428
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:06,698
I wasn't confused.

429
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:09,617
I wasn't drunk either.

430
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:13,788
Sure, I considered telling you,

431
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:15,790
but I didn't plan on
blurting it out like yesterday.

432
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:18,376
But you kept bringing up Che-ni
and I got annoyed…

433
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:20,712
This won't do any good now.

434
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:22,505
You might as well forget it.

435
00:31:24,507 --> 00:31:25,717
Forget it all and wait.

436
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,635
I'm going to tell you
how I feel the right way.

437
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:53,036
What? Seo-jun likes me?

438
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:56,289
No way.

439
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:58,291
Was it a joke?

440
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:00,209
Is it April Fools' day?

441
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:02,211
It's not.

442
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:08,259
Then why?

443
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:11,012
Since when?

444
00:32:24,692 --> 00:32:26,903
Hey, what do I do?

445
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:30,823
You held back your feelings for two years,

446
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:33,076
then told her in a fit of anger
while holding a bucket of kimchi

447
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:37,747
in front of her house
at 8 a.m. in that get-up?

448
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:39,040
I didn't actually tell her!

449
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:42,043
Technically, I said I would tell her
about my feelings for her.

450
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:43,628
Like a teaser of some sort?

451
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:46,381
-A teaser? Are you kidding me?
-Gosh, it's killing me.

452
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:48,967
Hey. Don't cry.

453
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:51,928
I can't cry with you
since I've lost some muscle.

454
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:55,974
But I think it worked out for the best.

455
00:32:57,016 --> 00:32:58,518
If it hadn't been for your temper, Lee Su…

456
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:02,647
Anyway, you'd have felt guilty
and not said a word.

457
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:04,190
You did well.

458
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:11,197
Now that that's happened, just push ahead.

459
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:16,035
-What would be a cool way to ask her out?
-Don't you watch any TV?

460
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:19,330
The guys in dramas
rent out amusement parks,

461
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:21,332
get a helicopter over the rooftop,

462
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:24,961
or borrow a yacht
and blast the sky with fireworks.

463
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,881
I'm not a trust fund kid.
How would I afford all that?

464
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:30,174
Right?

465
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:31,092
Right.

466
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:33,261
Then,

467
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:35,096
use your handsome looks.

468
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:37,056
Anything will be awesome if you do it.

469
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,850
Watch me.

470
00:33:38,933 --> 00:33:40,560
Make dreamy eyes and say…

471
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:43,229
If you drink this,

472
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:45,440
you're going out with me.

473
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:48,526
Pretty good, right?

474
00:33:48,609 --> 00:33:50,069
-Your turn.
-Jeez.

475
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:54,115
Will you go out with me?

476
00:33:56,951 --> 00:33:57,785
Gosh.

477
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:00,204
The butterflies…

478
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:02,665
My heart fluttered!

479
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:04,709
-Seo-jun, just do it like that.
-Really?

480
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:06,419
She won't be able to turn you down.

481
00:34:09,922 --> 00:34:11,049
Will you go out with me?

482
00:34:12,508 --> 00:34:13,551
Let's go out.

483
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:15,303
Come on, please go out with me.

484
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:18,765
Stop. It's too much for my heart.

485
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:21,309
Don't touch me either.

486
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:23,352
LIM JAE-PIL

487
00:34:25,938 --> 00:34:30,026
Hello, nice to meet you. I'm Lim Jae-soon.

488
00:34:31,694 --> 00:34:34,989
Hello. I'm Wang Ja from Prince Comics.

489
00:34:35,823 --> 00:34:36,699
I love you.

490
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:40,453
That caught me off guard.
You can't just suddenly say that.

491
00:34:40,536 --> 00:34:41,871
Let's change roles.

492
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:45,833
Hello, nice to meet you.

493
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:47,210
Yes, nice to meet you.

494
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:49,003
Wait a second…

495
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:51,297
You shouldn't be here.

496
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:52,381
Then, where should I--

497
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:54,842
A flower belongs in the flower garden.

498
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:57,136
What are you doing?

499
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,722
We're practicing
for his blind date tomorrow.

500
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:00,640
Is that right?

501
00:35:00,723 --> 00:35:04,185
Please do well and get married next year.

502
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:05,436
I need a partner to do that.

503
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,773
I'm sure there's one for you.
She's out there, so be on the lookout.

504
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:10,274
Take a look at Hee-kyung.

505
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:11,734
She said she'd never marry,

506
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:14,070
but she found someone
and will be married soon.

507
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:16,364
One moment.

508
00:35:17,698 --> 00:35:18,533
Jae-pil!

509
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:20,660
What's wrong?

510
00:35:20,743 --> 00:35:24,080
He bursts out like that
whenever I mention Hee-kyung's marriage.

511
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:27,875
I guess he's sad to see her married off.

512
00:35:28,876 --> 00:35:32,171
Right, doesn't Ju-young hear back
about college admissions today?

513
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:35,258
Yes, I'm sure my Ju-young got in.

514
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:36,843
Get smaller!

515
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:40,429
2022 STUDENT ADMISSION RESULTS

516
00:35:42,723 --> 00:35:44,392
-Want to check at the same time?
-No.

517
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:45,601
-Rock, paper, scissors!
-Scissors!

518
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:46,644
-Nice!
-Jeez.

519
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:48,521
You first.

520
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:52,441
Did I get in?

521
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:53,526
Gosh.

522
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:55,444
What? Did I not get in?

523
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:57,321
You're in!

524
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:58,573
Really?

525
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:04,328
Hey, Ju-young, let's go out!

526
00:36:08,082 --> 00:36:09,292
Nice!

527
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:12,795
Okay, now let's check yours.

528
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:16,716
What? You didn't get in?

529
00:36:18,092 --> 00:36:19,635
I take back what I said.

530
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:26,809
What the heck?

531
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:29,312
I thought they were just close friends.
When did they…

532
00:36:30,771 --> 00:36:33,191
Shouldn't you know how I feel by now?

533
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:35,943
Whatever.

534
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:45,244
Let's get dinner tomorrow.

535
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:48,164
Don't think about avoiding me.
Let's just meet.

536
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:50,124
Forget it all and wait.

537
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:51,542
I'm going to tell you
how I feel the right way.

538
00:36:57,089 --> 00:36:57,924
I got it.

539
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:02,595
A detail brush.

540
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:04,555
I'm sorry.

541
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:09,101
-Wait…
-I'll do it.

542
00:37:11,145 --> 00:37:12,188
Can't you stay focused?

543
00:37:13,689 --> 00:37:15,608
I don't need an assistant, so go away.

544
00:37:16,817 --> 00:37:18,069
I'm sorry.

545
00:37:20,696 --> 00:37:22,698
You're bothering me. Go away.

546
00:37:26,994 --> 00:37:28,204
I should have done better.

547
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:33,584
Please sign to donate
to children in Africa.

548
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:34,961
Thank you.

549
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:36,921
Can you sign here, please?

550
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:38,965
Thank you. A signature, please.

551
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:41,050
-See you tomorrow.
-Thank you, get home safe.

552
00:37:43,844 --> 00:37:44,804
Ju-kyung.

553
00:37:48,474 --> 00:37:49,517
Are you all right?

554
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:54,397
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

555
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:07,076
All the weary days and sorrow

556
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:12,290
-Melt away like the snow
-What's with him?

557
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:16,460
-A single thread of hope held off
-What are you doing?

558
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:18,337
-Are you seeing someone?
-He totally is.

559
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:20,339
-He's waiting for a girl to call.
-I'm not.

560
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:21,924
He is waiting for a girl to call.

561
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,719
-Awesome.
-It is about a girl, right?

562
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:25,970
Okay, sure.

563
00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:28,222
LIM JU-KYUNG

564
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:31,934
Then I'll see you
after your work tomorrow.

565
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:41,110
I'll see you tomorrow.

566
00:38:55,207 --> 00:38:59,462
This beautiful goddess will be my wife.

567
00:38:59,545 --> 00:39:00,713
Here we go again.

568
00:39:00,796 --> 00:39:02,340
I don't have to wear this, right?

569
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:05,843
The dress feels too tight.
I'd like a size bigger, please.

570
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:07,094
I think that's it for me.

571
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:10,681
Hee-kyung, you should try more things on.
They said you can try three dresses.

572
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:12,892
How about that bell shape dress
from earlier?

573
00:39:12,975 --> 00:39:14,143
I bet it'd suit you.

574
00:39:14,226 --> 00:39:16,354
What matters is that
we're getting married,

575
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:18,189
not our clothes, right?

576
00:39:19,231 --> 00:39:21,567
You're a very easygoing bride, ma'am.

577
00:39:22,401 --> 00:39:25,154
Then would you like to choose
the groom's tuxedo first?

578
00:39:25,237 --> 00:39:26,072
Sure.

579
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:38,292
Well, Hee-kyung.

580
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:45,466
How do I look?

581
00:39:46,175 --> 00:39:48,344
You look handsome. Let's get that one.

582
00:39:48,427 --> 00:39:49,261
Wait,

583
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:51,222
wasn't the first one better?

584
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:52,264
The first one?

585
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:55,643
They look similar.
Tuxedos are about the same.

586
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:57,269
What do you mean they're the same?

587
00:39:57,353 --> 00:40:00,064
The first one was a notch
lapel jacket with a vest in black.

588
00:40:00,147 --> 00:40:02,149
This one's a short lapel jacket
in deep navy

589
00:40:03,025 --> 00:40:04,318
with a cummerbund.

590
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:06,654
And the shirt earlier
had a straight-edge collar,

591
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:08,656
and see this one here?
It's a round collar.

592
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:09,740
The collar angle

593
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:13,202
can make one's expression
look sharp or soft.

594
00:40:13,285 --> 00:40:15,704
The groom's expression
is important at a wedding.

595
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:17,498
People can be judgmental about the groom--

596
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:20,584
You're so handsome,
they won't even notice your suit.

597
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:22,211
Seriously?

598
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:26,507
All right, try the next one.
I'll give you better feedback.

599
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:27,550
Try the next one.

600
00:40:35,182 --> 00:40:36,183
How do I look?

601
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:38,602
This is so you, right?

602
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:39,979
He's practically glowing!

603
00:40:40,062 --> 00:40:41,147
Really?

604
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:43,190
It's the exact same suit.

605
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:45,276
I didn't change.

606
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:47,319
What? Jeez.

607
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:49,864
You're lying.

608
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:51,198
That's enough for today.

609
00:40:52,366 --> 00:40:54,994
Babe. Wait, Jun-woo.

610
00:40:56,203 --> 00:40:57,288
Babe, Jun-woo.

611
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:02,084
Are you upset?

612
00:41:02,751 --> 00:41:04,670
No. Why would I be?

613
00:41:05,337 --> 00:41:07,089
I guess I'm getting married by myself.

614
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,508
How can you get married by yourself?

615
00:41:10,342 --> 00:41:11,510
You're marrying me.

616
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:15,306
No, it's just I'm the only one
who's excited.

617
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:16,974
Hey, I get it.

618
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:19,727
I'm sorry. Okay?

619
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:21,312
What are you sorry for?

620
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:24,565
Well…

621
00:41:25,357 --> 00:41:26,192
just…

622
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:27,109
everything.

623
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:29,361
When you can come up with a reason,

624
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:30,821
give me a call.

625
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:32,865
Jun-woo.

626
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:34,366
Hey, Jun-woo!

627
00:41:41,707 --> 00:41:44,585
How do I make him feel better?

628
00:42:05,397 --> 00:42:06,232
Face mist.

629
00:42:06,815 --> 00:42:07,650
Right.

630
00:42:08,567 --> 00:42:09,568
Here.

631
00:42:13,614 --> 00:42:15,533
I can't walk because my feet hurt.

632
00:42:15,616 --> 00:42:16,742
One moment.

633
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:28,087
Here.

634
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:32,132
You should go fetch it.

635
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:34,301
Che-ni, that's a bit…

636
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:44,353
Seo-jun.

637
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:47,690
Seo-jun is here! Seo-jun!

638
00:42:49,441 --> 00:42:52,945
How did you know I got first place
in the music show?

639
00:42:53,028 --> 00:42:54,905
You even brought me flowers?

640
00:42:56,657 --> 00:42:57,491
Here.

641
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:05,958
-Hey.
-Yes?

642
00:43:06,041 --> 00:43:07,376
-Don't you have hands?
-Me?

643
00:43:08,043 --> 00:43:09,128
Hands?

644
00:43:09,628 --> 00:43:11,046
Here they are.

645
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:16,343
Go fetch using those hands.

646
00:43:19,054 --> 00:43:20,389
-Hey.
-Yes?

647
00:43:20,472 --> 00:43:21,974
If she's off, so is Ju-kyung, right?

648
00:43:22,057 --> 00:43:23,809
Yes, we'll get things inside
and clock out.

649
00:43:23,892 --> 00:43:26,520
-You can go home, Ju-kyung.
-No, I'll take these and then…

650
00:43:27,521 --> 00:43:29,064
-All right, then. Bye.
-Okay.

651
00:43:29,148 --> 00:43:30,357
-Goodbye.
-Let's go.

652
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:31,483
Well…

653
00:43:31,984 --> 00:43:34,403
-Sorry! Bye! See you tomorrow!
-Jeez!

654
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:40,367
Seriously, what the heck?

655
00:43:54,256 --> 00:43:55,966
-Why are you standing there?
-What?

656
00:43:57,343 --> 00:43:58,427
Nothing.

657
00:44:01,764 --> 00:44:05,142
Can I be in here looking like this?

658
00:44:05,225 --> 00:44:06,268
You look pretty.

659
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:15,444
It's upside down.

660
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:29,958
-How is it?
-What?

661
00:44:33,295 --> 00:44:35,047
It's delicious. Nice ambience too.

662
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:37,675
Are you nervous?

663
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:40,427
No, why would I be nervous?

664
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:44,973
I'm nervous.

665
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:49,436
After blurting out those words yesterday,

666
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:52,606
I've been thinking hard
about romantic ways

667
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:54,358
to tell you how I feel.

668
00:44:56,068 --> 00:44:59,071
I didn't want to make a fuss
like they do on TV or in the movies.

669
00:45:00,072 --> 00:45:03,492
I figured there must be a reason
why people come here.

670
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:07,037
I'll just be honest.

671
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:13,460
I like you, Ju-kyung.

672
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:22,594
Seo-jun.

673
00:45:23,429 --> 00:45:25,305
-But I…
-I've liked you for a long time.

674
00:45:27,933 --> 00:45:29,476
Back then, I knew how you felt,

675
00:45:31,186 --> 00:45:33,397
so I could neither tell you
nor stop liking you.

676
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:35,649
I've hovered around you for three years.

677
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:39,027
But I can't contain myself anymore.

678
00:45:40,362 --> 00:45:42,614
My feelings for you
just burst out like yesterday.

679
00:45:43,657 --> 00:45:44,867
I can't hide them anymore.

680
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:46,910
I can't help it.

681
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:48,912
-Seo-jun.
-I am

682
00:45:49,872 --> 00:45:51,999
begging you to see me as a man

683
00:45:52,624 --> 00:45:53,500
right now.

684
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:57,129
Please be persuaded,

685
00:45:58,005 --> 00:45:58,839
just this once.

686
00:46:01,675 --> 00:46:03,677
I'm not asking for your answer right now.

687
00:46:05,888 --> 00:46:06,722
Just three dates.

688
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:10,184
Go on three dates with me.

689
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:12,394
As a man and a woman.

690
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:26,158
Are you all right?

691
00:46:26,867 --> 00:46:27,951
It's nothing.

692
00:46:29,745 --> 00:46:30,871
Hey, what's wrong?

693
00:46:33,999 --> 00:46:34,875
Are you sick?

694
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:40,672
-Here.
-Thank you.

695
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:43,300
Jeez.

696
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:45,802
I saw it coming seeing you eat so quickly.

697
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:48,555
Do you need some medicine?

698
00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:51,892
No, it was just an upset stomach.

699
00:46:52,726 --> 00:46:54,019
Were you that uncomfortable?

700
00:46:55,312 --> 00:46:56,438
No.

701
00:46:58,065 --> 00:46:58,899
I like it.

702
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:02,819
I hope you feel uncomfortable
every time you see me.

703
00:47:03,529 --> 00:47:06,782
I want you to be nervous
and notice me when I'm with you.

704
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:08,450
Just like I do.

705
00:47:11,203 --> 00:47:12,579
Don't be sick, though.

706
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:38,188
I'm begging you to see me
as a man right now.

707
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:42,609
Please be persuaded,

708
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:45,362
just this once.

709
00:48:45,631 --> 00:48:47,341
Why am I opening this again?

710
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:25,754
Gosh, I shouldn't be doing this right now.

711
00:49:31,093 --> 00:49:31,968
Ju-young,

712
00:49:32,886 --> 00:49:33,970
I really appreciate it.

713
00:49:35,597 --> 00:49:37,683
Buy yourself something tasty,
brother-in-law.

714
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:40,977
Jun-woo, let's make
the end of the candle road

715
00:49:41,061 --> 00:49:42,813
into a heart shape.

716
00:49:42,896 --> 00:49:45,023
Shall we, new brothers, make it together?

717
00:49:50,445 --> 00:49:51,363
Where are you going?

718
00:49:51,446 --> 00:49:53,198
The convenience store.

719
00:49:53,281 --> 00:49:55,200
Hey, we can use some help blowing these.

720
00:49:58,328 --> 00:50:00,122
Gosh, I'm dizzy. I can't do it anymore.

721
00:50:03,917 --> 00:50:04,876
Are you crying again?

722
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:08,004
It's really happening.
Hee-kyung is going to be married soon.

723
00:50:08,088 --> 00:50:09,214
Here we go again.

724
00:50:09,923 --> 00:50:11,842
Hee-kyung's the one that should be crying,

725
00:50:11,925 --> 00:50:13,009
not you.

726
00:50:14,928 --> 00:50:16,012
Speaking of which,

727
00:50:16,096 --> 00:50:17,806
I should give her a heads-up.

728
00:50:17,889 --> 00:50:20,684
It's supposed to be a surprise.
You can't tell her.

729
00:50:21,476 --> 00:50:22,310
Honey…

730
00:50:26,648 --> 00:50:27,566
Yes, Mom?

731
00:50:30,026 --> 00:50:32,320
Hey, Jun-woo is at our place

732
00:50:32,404 --> 00:50:35,657
making a fuss to surprise you
with a proposal.

733
00:50:35,741 --> 00:50:36,825
What? He's proposing?

734
00:50:37,659 --> 00:50:39,703
That's why he acted like
he was upset earlier.

735
00:50:39,786 --> 00:50:42,664
He's super excited to make you emotional,

736
00:50:42,748 --> 00:50:44,499
so when you come in, you should cry.

737
00:50:44,583 --> 00:50:46,376
Give it all you got and shed a tear.

738
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:48,211
I can't cry when I don't feel like it.

739
00:50:48,962 --> 00:50:50,005
Okay.

740
00:50:52,007 --> 00:50:54,259
What cute mischief has he been up to?

741
00:50:55,552 --> 00:50:56,803
But how do I cry?

742
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:02,392
When was the last time I cried?

743
00:51:06,605 --> 00:51:07,564
Here.

744
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:08,940
SOJU, JERKY

745
00:51:10,192 --> 00:51:11,485
It's the first snow already?

746
00:51:11,568 --> 00:51:13,195
I hate when it snows.

747
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:15,864
It's 5,700 won.

748
00:51:25,957 --> 00:51:28,919
I'm going to go to Namsan
to make a wish upon the first snow…

749
00:51:30,086 --> 00:51:31,338
that you'll remember me.

750
00:51:36,468 --> 00:51:38,136
I love this mood.

751
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:42,724
The city is pretty at night.

752
00:52:27,894 --> 00:52:29,354
Soo-ho!

753
00:52:37,279 --> 00:52:38,321
I'm sorry.

754
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:52,502
My girlfriend likes strawberries.

755
00:53:05,307 --> 00:53:06,892
Hey, it's me.

756
00:53:07,601 --> 00:53:10,145
Of course, I'm here.
Bundle up since it's cold.

757
00:53:23,408 --> 00:53:25,785
Should I get new contact lenses?

758
00:53:51,436 --> 00:53:52,854
I just can't calm down.

759
00:53:57,734 --> 00:53:59,235
YOU ARE MY ENTIRE WORLD, MY EVERY MOMENT

760
00:53:59,319 --> 00:54:00,654
DO YOU KNOW WHAT A YELLOW TULIP MEANS?
UNREQUITED LOVE…

761
00:54:01,237 --> 00:54:02,697
I didn't get to say any of that.

762
00:54:03,823 --> 00:54:04,741
The flower meaning!

763
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:08,453
I forgot to tell her about the flowers.

764
00:54:11,164 --> 00:54:11,998
Darn it.

765
00:54:13,208 --> 00:54:15,085
The flower meaning…

766
00:54:20,507 --> 00:54:22,050
It's best to drink alone.

767
00:54:25,512 --> 00:54:26,888
It's snowing a lot.

768
00:54:52,288 --> 00:54:53,123
What time is it?

769
00:55:07,303 --> 00:55:08,555
Can I see your ticket?

770
00:55:10,557 --> 00:55:11,683
Did I drop it somewhere?

771
00:55:12,225 --> 00:55:13,351
One moment, please.

772
00:55:37,208 --> 00:55:38,043
I found it.

773
00:56:07,572 --> 00:56:08,406
Ju-kyung?

774
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:20,543
Ju-kyung.

775
00:56:46,903 --> 00:56:48,822
I rushed over here as soon as I landed,

776
00:56:54,035 --> 00:56:55,120
and here you are.

777
00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:13,179
Your face is cold.

778
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:16,599
You must be freezing.

779
00:57:23,356 --> 00:57:24,566
Why did you come back?

780
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:29,279
Because I missed you.

781
00:57:31,948 --> 00:57:32,866
But we broke up.

782
00:57:36,035 --> 00:57:37,912
Why would you miss me?

783
00:57:37,996 --> 00:57:39,205
But still.

784
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:44,711
I missed you.

785
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:50,091
I missed you to death.

786
00:58:01,311 --> 00:58:02,145
I…

787
00:58:06,524 --> 00:58:08,193
I didn't miss you.

788
00:58:15,575 --> 00:58:16,534
Ju-kyung.

789
00:58:17,202 --> 00:58:18,203
Ju-kyung!

790
00:58:21,164 --> 00:58:22,165
Did you get home safe?

791
00:58:22,248 --> 00:58:23,082
LIM JU-KYUNG

792
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:25,668
You came to practice at this hour?

793
00:58:26,252 --> 00:58:28,588
Yes, I figured I won't be able to
fall asleep today.

794
00:58:28,671 --> 00:58:29,506
Why?

795
00:58:29,589 --> 00:58:31,591
Nervous now that you're actually debuting?

796
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:33,968
Well, keep up the good work.

797
00:58:34,052 --> 00:58:36,930
By the way, Mr. Kang said
Soo-ho came back today.

798
00:58:37,013 --> 00:58:38,473
-You knew, right?
-Excuse me?

799
00:58:38,556 --> 00:58:39,516
You didn't know?

800
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:42,101
Mr. Lee finally woke up last month.

801
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:43,811
The hospital said it was a miracle.

802
00:58:44,395 --> 00:58:45,605
It's great, right?

803
00:58:46,272 --> 00:58:47,357
Yes, that's great.

804
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:49,817
Don't wear yourself out and get some rest.
I'm off.

805
00:58:49,901 --> 00:58:50,735
Bye.

806
00:58:52,779 --> 00:58:54,447
The punk didn't even tell me.

807
00:58:57,909 --> 00:59:00,453
The person you are trying to reach is…

808
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:01,371
What the heck?

809
00:59:01,871 --> 00:59:03,623
Ju-kyung, let's talk.

810
00:59:04,290 --> 00:59:06,376
Let go. I don't want to see you right now.

811
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:10,380
Are you feeling okay, Ju-kyung?

812
00:59:11,130 --> 00:59:12,382
No, just go.

813
00:59:14,425 --> 00:59:15,593
Are you okay?

814
00:59:16,469 --> 00:59:17,637
Let's go to the hospital.

815
00:59:42,412 --> 00:59:43,621
You shouldn't be sick.

816
01:00:17,196 --> 01:00:18,698
Why are you still here?

817
01:00:21,034 --> 01:00:22,201
I told you to leave.

818
01:00:23,328 --> 01:00:24,370
How could I just leave?

819
01:00:24,954 --> 01:00:26,873
-Leave already.
-I'm not leaving.

820
01:00:28,458 --> 01:00:29,792
Then I'm leaving.

821
01:00:32,337 --> 01:00:33,463
How are you feeling now?

822
01:00:33,963 --> 01:00:35,632
I feel fine.

823
01:00:35,715 --> 01:00:37,467
-Do you have the test results?
-Yes.

824
01:00:37,550 --> 01:00:38,551
Is it serious?

825
01:00:39,552 --> 01:00:40,595
It's not, but--

826
01:00:40,678 --> 01:00:42,972
If it's not serious,
why is she hurting so badly?

827
01:00:43,056 --> 01:00:44,140
What's causing it?

828
01:00:44,223 --> 01:00:46,017
It's just constipation.

829
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:47,477
Excuse me?

830
01:00:49,646 --> 01:00:52,940
Is that really bad?
I don't need surgery, right?

831
01:00:53,024 --> 01:00:53,983
You just need to poop.

832
01:00:54,859 --> 01:00:57,820
Constipation seems to have caused
severe temporary abdominal pain.

833
01:00:58,863 --> 01:01:02,241
So these things you see in the picture

834
01:01:02,325 --> 01:01:03,576
are all gas and stools.

835
01:01:05,662 --> 01:01:07,121
When was the last you pooped?

836
01:01:07,664 --> 01:01:10,083
My bowel movements are perfectly fine!

837
01:01:18,383 --> 01:01:20,176
Alcohol doesn't help with constipation.

838
01:01:22,095 --> 01:01:24,097
Ju-kyung!

839
01:01:28,643 --> 01:01:29,811
Darn it.

840
01:01:37,527 --> 01:01:38,403
What do I do?

841
01:01:46,035 --> 01:01:49,163
Ms. Lim Ju-kyung's guardian?
Come this way to make the payment.

842
01:01:49,247 --> 01:01:50,248
Okay.

843
01:02:02,051 --> 01:02:03,970
MY DEAR HEE-KYUNG
WILL YOU MARRY ME?

844
01:02:05,263 --> 01:02:07,140
-I'm putting it on.
-She's here.

845
01:02:11,477 --> 01:02:14,105
The door opens up

846
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:17,191
And you enter

847
01:02:17,275 --> 01:02:19,986
I knew at once

848
01:02:20,486 --> 01:02:24,198
That you were my sister-in-law

849
01:02:24,282 --> 01:02:25,908
-Ju-kyung?
-Was that Ju-kyung?

850
01:02:25,992 --> 01:02:27,034
Yes, that was Ju-kyung.

851
01:02:28,077 --> 01:02:29,787
I should just die.

852
01:02:29,871 --> 01:02:31,706
Why do you go on living, Lim Ju-kyung?

853
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:33,958
What sort of reunion was that?

854
01:02:35,042 --> 01:02:36,043
Jeez.

855
01:02:36,127 --> 01:02:38,671
WARNING
FOR AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

856
01:02:39,547 --> 01:02:42,550
Grapefruit, I'm so moved by this!

857
01:02:44,469 --> 01:02:46,846
I'm so touched.

858
01:02:48,097 --> 01:02:50,475
-No. Let's start over.
-She needs to come in again.

859
01:02:50,558 --> 01:02:52,477
From the top.
Hee-kyung, you should go out.

860
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:53,478
-Come in again.
-Out.

861
01:02:53,561 --> 01:02:55,229
-You need to go out.
-Why?

862
01:02:55,313 --> 01:02:57,774
-We need to do it again.
-Come on.

863
01:02:57,857 --> 01:02:59,776
Why make all the fuss?

864
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:02,987
It's okay. Let's try it again.

865
01:03:03,070 --> 01:03:05,323
Let's calm down.
It's okay, breathe in and out.

866
01:03:06,365 --> 01:03:08,034
It's not easy to get married, is it?

867
01:03:22,381 --> 01:03:23,216
Hello?

868
01:03:23,299 --> 01:03:24,801
I put your luggage at your place.

869
01:03:25,426 --> 01:03:28,054
Where did you go in such a hurry
without stopping at home?

870
01:03:54,997 --> 01:03:55,957
I found it.

871
01:04:06,717 --> 01:04:07,593
Ju-kyung?

872
01:04:17,270 --> 01:04:18,312
It was snowing.

873
01:04:19,772 --> 01:04:21,482
-I heard it was the first snow.
-What?

874
01:04:21,566 --> 01:04:24,694
You can use the car parked in front.
It's your dad's.

875
01:04:24,777 --> 01:04:25,611
Okay.

876
01:04:26,153 --> 01:04:27,238
Thanks for today.

877
01:04:44,005 --> 01:04:46,674
GIRLFRIEND

878
01:05:09,739 --> 01:05:10,865
LEE SOO-HO

879
01:05:22,418 --> 01:05:23,502
Did you get home safe?

880
01:05:32,136 --> 01:05:35,222
MISSED CALL
HAN SEO-JUN

881
01:05:39,852 --> 01:05:41,479
-Seo-jun.
-So you're back.

882
01:05:43,439 --> 01:05:45,858
-How did you know I was here?
-I heard it from work.

883
01:05:46,442 --> 01:05:49,362
That's not how you treat a friend.
How could you not let me know?

884
01:05:49,445 --> 01:05:50,363
I'm sorry.

885
01:05:50,446 --> 01:05:52,907
I came in a hurry
and had a lot to take care of.

886
01:05:53,658 --> 01:05:54,867
Your place looks the same.

887
01:05:57,620 --> 01:05:58,537
I only have water.

888
01:05:58,621 --> 01:05:59,622
No worries.

889
01:06:00,289 --> 01:06:01,332
What about your father?

890
01:06:02,041 --> 01:06:03,000
Is he better now?

891
01:06:03,084 --> 01:06:04,126
Did he get discharged?

892
01:06:04,919 --> 01:06:07,755
He moved to another center
to receive rehabilitation treatment.

893
01:06:08,422 --> 01:06:09,507
That's great news.

894
01:06:09,590 --> 01:06:12,885
Hey, you should have come
straight to me after landing.

895
01:06:13,803 --> 01:06:16,305
How can you not let me know?
I kept calling you.

896
01:06:17,223 --> 01:06:18,224
It was too crazy.

897
01:06:19,850 --> 01:06:20,977
I met Ju-kyung.

898
01:06:25,147 --> 01:06:27,441
You did? You met her today?

899
01:06:27,525 --> 01:06:29,944
Yes, I ran into her.

900
01:06:37,868 --> 01:06:39,036
Are you crying?

901
01:06:41,831 --> 01:06:43,040
It's because it's spicy.

902
01:06:44,583 --> 01:06:46,043
You always handled it so well.

903
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:51,882
Are you crying?

904
01:06:52,550 --> 01:06:54,051
Did you get your college results?

905
01:06:55,261 --> 01:06:57,013
Did you not get in? Is that why?

906
01:06:59,765 --> 01:07:01,267
Then why are you crying?

907
01:07:02,059 --> 01:07:03,352
Did something happen?

908
01:07:03,436 --> 01:07:04,562
I just miss him.

909
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:09,316
I miss him.

910
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:11,152
Gosh, that prick.

911
01:07:14,071 --> 01:07:15,197
Then call him.

912
01:07:15,281 --> 01:07:17,033
Knowing him,
he did that because he felt bad.

913
01:07:17,742 --> 01:07:19,201
I could talk to him for you.

914
01:07:21,704 --> 01:07:22,538
No.

915
01:07:23,205 --> 01:07:24,957
I'm really going to forget about him.

916
01:07:26,584 --> 01:07:28,044
I'm almost all the way over him.

917
01:07:30,629 --> 01:07:32,214
What's gotten into me today?

918
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:35,551
Is it because it's snowing?

919
01:07:45,603 --> 01:07:47,521
-Seo-jun.
-Yes?

920
01:07:47,605 --> 01:07:49,356
Did you eat? Should we order something?

921
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:50,858
Of course, we should.

922
01:07:50,941 --> 01:07:52,860
It's been so long. We need to catch up.

923
01:07:53,444 --> 01:07:54,487
Wait here.

924
01:08:19,845 --> 01:08:21,180
What a coincidence!

925
01:08:22,765 --> 01:08:23,933
We meet here.

926
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:25,434
What's this?

927
01:08:29,355 --> 01:08:31,273
Where are you going?

928
01:08:32,233 --> 01:08:33,317
Don't you follow me.

929
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:35,486
I'm not following you.
I'm going this way too.

930
01:08:35,986 --> 01:08:36,904
Another coincidence.

931
01:08:38,072 --> 01:08:39,115
Did you have breakfast?

932
01:08:40,658 --> 01:08:41,867
Can you please look at me?

933
01:08:44,203 --> 01:08:46,622
The first snow fell yesterday.
Why were you at Namsan?

934
01:08:47,164 --> 01:08:49,208
You remembered me, right?

935
01:08:51,544 --> 01:08:52,711
You were right all along.

936
01:08:52,795 --> 01:08:54,296
My wish really came true.

937
01:08:55,297 --> 01:08:56,465
Ju-kyung!

938
01:08:57,216 --> 01:08:59,301
You'll get a stomachache again, Ju-kyung!

939
01:08:59,385 --> 01:09:01,053
Ju-kyung!

940
01:09:01,554 --> 01:09:03,180
Hey, taxi!

941
01:09:04,473 --> 01:09:05,599
Ju-kyung!

942
01:09:05,683 --> 01:09:08,227
Ju-kyung!

943
01:09:08,310 --> 01:09:09,145
Ju-kyung!

944
01:09:13,607 --> 01:09:16,485
He went radio silent for a year. Why now?

945
01:09:28,831 --> 01:09:29,665
Soo-ho!

946
01:09:33,419 --> 01:09:34,753
How did you know I work here?

947
01:09:34,837 --> 01:09:36,005
What a coincidence.

948
01:09:37,047 --> 01:09:38,424
You work here?

949
01:09:38,507 --> 01:09:40,259
When do you get off from work?

950
01:09:40,342 --> 01:09:43,512
-Who told you? Ju-young? Or Tae-hoon?
-It's really a coincidence.

951
01:09:44,597 --> 01:09:46,515
You just happened to visit a beauty salon?

952
01:09:46,599 --> 01:09:47,933
-You?
-I mean it.

953
01:09:48,517 --> 01:09:49,643
I came to get my hair done.

954
01:09:50,936 --> 01:09:52,563
Sure, get your hair done and leave.

955
01:09:53,939 --> 01:09:54,773
Hey.

956
01:09:57,860 --> 01:09:59,612
Is he an actor?

957
01:10:00,196 --> 01:10:01,947
-I'm not sure, he is good--
-Excuse me.

958
01:10:02,615 --> 01:10:06,327
Can I get something to drink, please?
I'm really thirsty.

959
01:10:07,119 --> 01:10:08,037
What are you doing?

960
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:10,539
-Get him something already.
-Yes, ma'am.

961
01:10:19,965 --> 01:10:22,176
The eye candy deserves
more treats than that.

962
01:10:25,012 --> 01:10:26,931
Soo-ho doesn't even like sweets…

963
01:10:28,432 --> 01:10:30,226
Why do I remember things like this?

964
01:10:30,309 --> 01:10:31,977
Who cares if he likes it or not?

965
01:10:43,030 --> 01:10:44,698
Doesn't she get a break?

966
01:10:44,782 --> 01:10:46,325
It'll be done in ten minutes.

967
01:10:46,408 --> 01:10:47,576
Already?

968
01:10:47,660 --> 01:10:50,246
Then get my hair back to how it was.

969
01:10:50,329 --> 01:10:51,580
I changed my mind.

970
01:10:53,207 --> 01:10:55,167
-Good work, everyone.
-Good work, Ju-kyung.

971
01:10:55,251 --> 01:10:56,919
-Good work, everyone.
-Good work.

972
01:11:01,257 --> 01:11:02,466
He must have left.

973
01:11:12,476 --> 01:11:13,727
Seo-jun?

974
01:11:14,270 --> 01:11:15,604
What? You're off early.

975
01:11:16,188 --> 01:11:18,315
-Why didn't you call ahead?
-Let's hang out today.

976
01:11:18,399 --> 01:11:19,358
What?

977
01:11:20,067 --> 01:11:22,736
You agreed to go on three dates with me.
Remember?

978
01:11:24,613 --> 01:11:25,447
Well,

979
01:11:26,407 --> 01:11:27,241
yesterday I…

980
01:11:27,324 --> 01:11:28,867
You met Soo-ho?

981
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:30,452
Did you hear?

982
01:11:31,036 --> 01:11:33,622
So what? So you can't hang out with me?

983
01:11:35,582 --> 01:11:38,002
Don't think about anything else today.

984
01:11:38,085 --> 01:11:39,086
Just think about me.

985
01:11:41,463 --> 01:11:42,840
That's the polite thing to do.

986
01:11:45,342 --> 01:11:46,510
Okay, got it.

987
01:11:47,094 --> 01:11:49,638
-So what are we doing?
-Just trust me and follow my lead.

988
01:11:51,432 --> 01:11:52,433
Whatever.

989
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:54,310
Where are we going?

990
01:12:12,578 --> 01:12:14,830
Why did you choose ice skating?

991
01:12:14,913 --> 01:12:18,000
Didn't you know guys always
bring their dates here?

992
01:12:18,083 --> 01:12:19,960
If she's about to fall, you can help her.

993
01:12:20,044 --> 01:12:22,171
A few touches here and there.

994
01:12:22,254 --> 01:12:25,049
You can skate and flirt all at once.
It's great, isn't it?

995
01:12:26,717 --> 01:12:28,510
I'm not good at skating.

996
01:12:29,094 --> 01:12:30,012
I'm not good either.

997
01:12:31,096 --> 01:12:32,348
-What?
-What do we do?

998
01:12:35,142 --> 01:12:36,352
Let's see. I'll do it.

999
01:12:37,436 --> 01:12:39,688
Now, how should I tie the laces?

1000
01:12:41,607 --> 01:12:42,983
You tied them well.

1001
01:12:54,036 --> 01:12:56,705
Hey, be careful.

1002
01:13:02,961 --> 01:13:04,630
You said you're not good at skating.

1003
01:13:05,381 --> 01:13:07,633
Ju-kyung, let's make a bet.

1004
01:13:08,217 --> 01:13:11,261
The person who gets
to the pillar over there first wins.

1005
01:13:11,345 --> 01:13:13,347
-Loser grants the winner a wish.
-You always say that.

1006
01:13:13,430 --> 01:13:15,307
Let's just try it. I'll skate backward.

1007
01:13:16,725 --> 01:13:17,559
Ready?

1008
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:20,646
One, two, three, go!

1009
01:13:23,107 --> 01:13:24,316
You're good.

1010
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:25,234
I am good, right?

1011
01:13:25,943 --> 01:13:27,277
-Be careful.
-Okay.

1012
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:32,199
Watch out!

1013
01:13:33,826 --> 01:13:34,743
Ju-kyung!

1014
01:13:36,662 --> 01:13:37,663
Ju-kyung.

1015
01:13:38,330 --> 01:13:39,915
Are you okay? Are you hurt badly?

1016
01:13:39,998 --> 01:13:41,708
I'm all right.

1017
01:13:41,792 --> 01:13:44,586
Let's get you up. One, two, three.

1018
01:13:46,505 --> 01:13:47,798
Is it bad?

1019
01:13:47,881 --> 01:13:49,508
No, I just skinned myself a little.

1020
01:13:50,717 --> 01:13:51,927
Give it to me. I'll do it.

1021
01:13:52,010 --> 01:13:52,845
Let me see.

1022
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:02,396
Sorry.

1023
01:14:05,524 --> 01:14:06,358
I'm sorry.

1024
01:14:10,028 --> 01:14:11,280
I said I'll do it.

1025
01:14:17,202 --> 01:14:18,245
We shouldn't have bet.

1026
01:14:20,038 --> 01:14:21,915
Why do you like making bets so much?

1027
01:14:22,833 --> 01:14:23,709
Throw this out.

1028
01:14:26,503 --> 01:14:27,838
I won the bet, okay?

1029
01:14:57,326 --> 01:14:59,995
-I want to buy some earrings.
-For Go-un?

1030
01:15:00,078 --> 01:15:01,663
No, for myself.

1031
01:15:07,628 --> 01:15:09,213
Which one's better out of the two?

1032
01:15:11,048 --> 01:15:12,299
-This one.
-This one?

1033
01:15:13,717 --> 01:15:14,635
I'll take this one.

1034
01:15:15,219 --> 01:15:17,262
She's going to pay. Thanks.

1035
01:15:17,346 --> 01:15:18,180
What?

1036
01:15:18,764 --> 01:15:19,765
Hey, Seo-jun!

1037
01:15:30,275 --> 01:15:31,318
It changed a lot.

1038
01:15:45,749 --> 01:15:47,668
You wrote all this and broke up with me?

1039
01:15:47,751 --> 01:15:48,585
Bastard.

1040
01:15:48,669 --> 01:15:50,003
Hope you get constipated.

1041
01:16:03,225 --> 01:16:04,393
Where are you?

1042
01:16:04,476 --> 01:16:05,811
GIRLFRIEND

1043
01:16:05,894 --> 01:16:07,104
I'll wait.

1044
01:16:08,897 --> 01:16:11,024
You got me the earring, so this is on me.

1045
01:16:12,109 --> 01:16:14,111
I should've ordered
something more expensive.

1046
01:16:14,194 --> 01:16:15,404
This is expensive.

1047
01:16:16,363 --> 01:16:17,197
It tastes good.

1048
01:16:19,449 --> 01:16:21,743
LEE SOO-HO: I'LL WAIT
MISSED CALL FROM LEE SOO-HO

1049
01:16:31,044 --> 01:16:31,878
It's too rich.

1050
01:16:32,879 --> 01:16:35,048
-Do you want to get ice cream?
-What?

1051
01:16:35,132 --> 01:16:36,383
-Excuse me?
-Yes?

1052
01:16:36,466 --> 01:16:38,677
-Can we get some mint ice cream?
-Okay.

1053
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:40,429
-Make it icy.
-Sure.

1054
01:16:41,221 --> 01:16:43,015
-And minty.
-Okay.

1055
01:16:46,018 --> 01:16:47,102
COMICS RENTAL SHOP

1056
01:16:49,396 --> 01:16:51,607
You didn't have to walk me home.

1057
01:16:51,690 --> 01:16:54,234
Well, it was a proper date after all.

1058
01:16:55,068 --> 01:16:56,486
I wouldn't walk a friend home.

1059
01:17:00,657 --> 01:17:02,284
You live too close to the bus stop.

1060
01:17:03,493 --> 01:17:06,371
What are you talking about?
My house is far from the bus stop.

1061
01:17:06,455 --> 01:17:08,373
No, it's not. It was a very short walk.

1062
01:17:10,125 --> 01:17:11,126
We're here.

1063
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:12,919
Get home safe.

1064
01:17:15,047 --> 01:17:15,922
Ju-kyung.

1065
01:17:17,382 --> 01:17:18,216
Yes?

1066
01:17:20,761 --> 01:17:21,595
I'm…

1067
01:17:23,555 --> 01:17:24,806
going to use my wish.

1068
01:17:43,158 --> 01:17:44,493
PRINCE COMICS

1069
01:18:19,152 --> 01:18:20,987
THANK YOU TO JUNG JOON-HO
FOR HIS SPECIAL APPEARANCE

1070
01:18:21,071 --> 01:18:23,407
THANK YOU TO KIM YOUNG-DAE
FOR HIS SPECIAL APPEARANCE

1071
01:18:41,174 --> 01:18:43,051
I'M LEE SOO-HO, NOT A CRYBABY!
WHEN WILL YOU REMEMBER ME?

1072
01:18:43,135 --> 01:18:44,886
I'M GOING TO GO TO NAMSAN
TO MAKE A WISH UPON THE FIRST SNOW

1073
01:18:44,970 --> 01:18:45,887
THAT YOU'LL REMEMBER ME

1074
01:18:50,267 --> 01:18:54,229
The memories from then
don't pain me as much anymore.

1075
01:18:54,312 --> 01:18:55,355
I'm sorry.

1076
01:18:56,481 --> 01:18:58,316
Do you still have feelings for Ju-kyung?

1077
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:00,944
No. I'm dating her.

1078
01:19:01,778 --> 01:19:03,655
What? It's Ju-kyung.

1079
01:19:03,739 --> 01:19:05,866
He's listless like seaweed!

1080
01:19:05,949 --> 01:19:07,284
I'm going to start studying.

1081
01:19:07,367 --> 01:19:09,995
I want to learn it properly,
starting from the basics.

1082
01:19:10,829 --> 01:19:11,705
Did you know?

1083
01:19:12,748 --> 01:19:14,458
It was my last chance.

1084
01:19:15,751 --> 01:19:16,960
Don't go.

1085
01:19:19,087 --> 01:19:24,009
