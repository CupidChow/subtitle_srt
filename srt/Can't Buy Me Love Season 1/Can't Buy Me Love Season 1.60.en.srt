won't help her.

357
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:46,750
She's right.

358
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:49,503
Plus, you said it yourself.
She needs to understand.

359
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:51,547
If you think you should
explain it to her,

360
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:52,798
then do it now.

361
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:55,592
Don’t wait until all the
employees revolt against her.

362
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:59,555
Papa, I already told her
what she needed to hear.

363
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:04,434
There’s nothing wrong
in repeating what you say.

364
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:07,980
But choose your words
carefully this time.

365
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:10,607
And don’t tell her
that she’s like a robot.

366
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:12,317
Ling is not a robot.

367
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:15,654
She’s just different,
but she’s not a robot.

368
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:19,950
Bingo, friends talk things out

369
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:22,202
so they'll understand
each other better.
