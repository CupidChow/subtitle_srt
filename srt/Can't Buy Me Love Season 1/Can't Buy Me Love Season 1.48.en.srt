Thank you so much for coming here.

- Attorney Gina Ong.

366
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:01,538
Yes, Attorney.

367
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:14,885
Bingo, you mentioned
that you saw Bettina at the bar,

368
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:17,888
around 5:00 p.m. the day Edward died?

369
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:21,975
Yes, ma’am.

370
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:26,814
And how sure are you
that it was Miss Bettina?

371
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:29,608
I’m sure of it, Attorney.

372
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:31,276
What was she wearing that day?

Uh…

376
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:42,538
I think she was wearing
a cream dress, Attorney.

377
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:45,582
How sure are you
that it happened at 5:00 p.m.?

378
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:52,506
Sir, the church bell rings
at exactly 5:00 p.m. for the mass.

380
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:01,265
I’ve asked them
to check the area that day.

381
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:04,726
But the bar’s CCTV camera is broken,

382
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,520
so we don’t have a footage.

383
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:09,022
Now that he’s ready to testify,

384
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:10,607
he is our only eyewitness.

make a big deal out of this,
