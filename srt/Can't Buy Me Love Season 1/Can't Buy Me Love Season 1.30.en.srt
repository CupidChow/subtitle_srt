356
00:19:38,933 --> 00:19:41,467
<i>Shall we give OPIP
the 1 million peso grant?</i>

357
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:43,600
<i> I'll never give up.</i>

358
00:19:43,767 --> 00:19:44,900
<i>If they don't want
my OPIP,</i>

359
00:19:45,067 --> 00:19:47,400
<i>I'll sell it to other
companies who want it.</i>

360
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:50,400
<i>It's a good thing I'll never
see that woman again.</i>

361
00:19:50,567 --> 00:19:52,133
<i>- Grandma.
- [GASPS]</i>

362
00:19:52,267 --> 00:19:54,433
<i>Ling, you finally
dropped by.</i>

363
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,633
<i> Why are you here?</i>

364
00:19:55,767 --> 00:19:57,367
<i>I was just around
the neighborhood.</i>

365
00:19:57,467 --> 00:20:00,033
<i>Tsk, you won't apologize
for what happened earlier?</i>

366
00:20:00,133 --> 00:20:00,900
<i> You're drunk.</i>

367
00:20:01,067 --> 00:20:02,433
<i> My OPIP was disapproved.</i>

368
00:20:02,633 --> 00:20:04,100
<i> We have no money left.</i>

369
00:20:05,867 --> 00:20:07,467
<i>The IP address was
traced back to him.</i>

370
00:20:07,633 --> 00:20:08,567
<i>Maybe he's also
the hacker</i>

371
00:20:08,667 --> 00:20:10,333
<i>since he already
has a record.</i>

372
00:20:10,467 --> 00:20:12,733
<i>Ma? What are you
doing in my office?</i>

373
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:14,933
<i>Three hundred million pesos
for your charity project?</i>

374
00:20:15,033 --> 00:20:17,000
<i>This will benefit kids
who've lost their homes.</i>

375
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:19,333
<i>The Liaos already pledged
this property a long time ago.</i>

376
00:20:19,467 --> 00:20:20,733
<i> If the Liaos approve,</i>

377
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:22,733
<i>we can do something
about that building.</i>

378
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:25,133
<i>Irene! You really asked for
that property from the Liaos</i>

379
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,967
<i>when you perfectly knew I was
about to ask them for it?</i>

380
00:20:28,133 --> 00:20:29,267
<i> You're pathetic.</i>

381
00:20:29,433 --> 00:20:31,467
<i> You have a lot of nerve!</i>

382
00:20:31,633 --> 00:20:33,567
<i>- I hate you!
- Stop it, ma'am!</i>

383
00:20:33,667 --> 00:20:34,600
<i> Enough!</i>
