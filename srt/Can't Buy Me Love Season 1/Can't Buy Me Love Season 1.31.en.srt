Okay.

112

Let's say the average cost
of the items bought online

113
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,900
is 250 pesos,

114

avail of OPIP.

115
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:43,267

claim that their item is lost...

82,400,000 times 5 percent...

That's roughly around
4 million users.

average price of items bought,

119

plus the shipping fee...

Ma'am Ling, not everyone
will avail of OPIP, right?

124
00:06:14,133 --> 00:06:15,900
And the one-peso insurance
premium is just the minimum.

125
00:06:16,033 --> 00:06:18,067
It'll still depend
on the price of the items.

126
00:06:18,167 --> 00:06:20,767
But the one-peso insurance
premium is very enticing,

127
00:06:20,933 --> 00:06:23,567
so I don't see why
people wouldn't avail of it.

128

Five percent is just me being
conservative.

That's why we still need
to study the policy

because the insurance premium
should vary

of the item bought online.
