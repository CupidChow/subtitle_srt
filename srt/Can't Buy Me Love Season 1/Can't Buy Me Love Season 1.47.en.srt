- [MONCHING] She didn't use it?

359
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:43,468
Oh no.

360
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:46,847
She might drop it if it's in her pocket.

361
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:50,976
What if when she drops it,
it ends up in the drain,

362
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:52,644
or gets picked up by someone else?

363
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:54,521
- Then, she gets a headache.

364
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:56,898
She suddenly remembers
the ointment I gave her,

365
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:59,484
only to find out that it's gone.

366
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:03,447
How is she supposed to
relieve her headache now?

367
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:05,240
Plus, it was 150 pesos.

368
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:08,744
- It's pricey. I shouldn't--

00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:17,961
He must be really tired and sleepy.
