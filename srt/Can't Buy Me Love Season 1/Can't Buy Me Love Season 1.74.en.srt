Where do you think you're going?

352
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:08,188
There's a line.
Wait at the back of the line.

353
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:09,857
Why would I line up? I need to see Bingo.

354
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,609
- We're all here to see him.
- Yeah, no cutsies!

355
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:15,571
- She's cutting in line! Hey!
- That's unfair!

356
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:18,115
Hey! Come back!
Wait at the back of the line!

357
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:20,492
- Bierna, handle her!
- How rude!

358
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:23,495
Hey, there! Didn't you see there's a line?

359
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:25,455
You should wait
like all the rest of us here.

360
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:27,583
- Exactly.
- That's unfair.

361
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,376
Why aren't you two in line?

362
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:31,295
Bingo's family and friends
don't need to line up.

363
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:32,504
We have special IDs.

364
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:35,257
- I really need to see Bingo.
- No! Stop!

365
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:38,719
- Wait at the back.
- You can't just cut in line.

366
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:40,304
- That's unfair!
- Hey!

367
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:42,681
- Grandma!
- [NENE] What's going on?

368
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:44,433
Grandma, there's Ling!

369
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,852
- No cutsies.
- Oh, Ling!

370
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:48,061
Come here.

371
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:50,022
- Help her.
- Oh, okay.

372
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:52,399
How come she gets to go first?

373
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:57,487
[INDISTINCT CLAMORING]

374
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:02,826
- This is a lot.
- Get well soon, Bingo.

375
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:06,163
- [SNOOP] Just stay there.
- [NENE] Come in, Ling.

376
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:07,998
- Number 22!
- [CLAMORING]

377
00:20:08,081 --> 00:20:10,250
- [NENE] Ling's here.
- [MONCHING] Oh, Ling.

378
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:12,085
Thank you so much, Ling.

379
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:13,462
Hold on.

380
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:16,715
- [MONCHING] Calm down, guys!
- [WOMAN] This can't be!

381
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:19,468
[MONCHING] Wait for your
number to be called, okay?

382
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:21,887
- Calm down.
- We want to see Bingo!

383
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:24,056
[MONCHING] Everyone will
get a chance, okay?

384
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:25,474
Get your number ready.

385
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:27,142
Get out!

386
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,561
Everyone leave now!

387
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:30,646
- Oh.
- Oh.

388
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:33,190
- You heard her.
- Go home.

389
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:34,983
[MAN] Let's go.

390
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:39,947
<i>If these people really care for you,</i>
<i>they'll allow you to rest.</i>

391
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:40,989
<i>You should go home.</i>

392
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:42,199
<i>You shouldn't be roaming around,</i>

393
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:43,659
<i>especially when I'm not with you.</i>

394
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:46,328
<i>Then get well soon, so you can be with me.</i>

395
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:52,042
<i>If you won't tell me the reason</i>
<i>why you're protecting Liv,</i>

396
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:53,627
<i>it's better to leave everything</i>

397
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:55,629
<i>rather than see you rot in jail.</i>

398
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:58,298
<i>I think it's time you knew the truth.</i>

399
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,260
<i>You have to help me become CEO of GLC.</i>

400
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:04,221
<i>It should be me and not</i>
<i>Charleston at the end of this.</i>

401
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:08,475
<i>Bingo, wake up! You're having chills.</i>

402
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:09,476
<i>Bingo!</i>

403
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:10,852
<i>Oh my God! You're bleeding!</i>

404
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:12,771
<i>You can't die, Bingo. I'm here, okay?</i>
