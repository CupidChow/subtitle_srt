00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,293
Sir Jaime?

368
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,420
- We'll start with him?
- Yes.

369
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:52,214
The one you had a picture with.

370
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:54,716
Yeah, because I attended his seminar.

371
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,136
He was nice when I talked to him.

372
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:59,555
He seemed willing to support O.P.I.P.

Well, great!
