1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:03,520
   

2
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:09,070
   

3
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:11,950
   

4
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:14,840
   

5
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:17,160
   

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,260
 

7
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:33,750
   

8
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:38,160
Did you guys do something wrong?

9
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,410
No? Not me.

10
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:48,660
- Hello. 
 - Sit, sit.

11
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:59,820
You three weren't in your seats when the flowerpot fell, right?

12
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:06,250
The day it fell?

13
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:08,070
Yes.

14
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,430
Whose is this?

15
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:20,810
It's mine.

16
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:22,190
Is that so?

17
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,310
You two, go upstairs.

18
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:37,390
What is it?

19
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:39,330
Gong Ki Joon.

20
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:43,090
You're expelled.

21
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:58,330
Teaching Director, what...

22
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:02,960
This key chain was found on the rooftop where the flowerpot was.

23
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,500
You have nothing to say, right?

24
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,150
Iâ€”

25
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:07,410
Why was that...

26
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:10,180
It's impossible. He never even went to the rooftop that day.

27
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:12,560
She's right. He was with us the whole time.

28
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,060
Both of you go upstairs.

29
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,810
Gong Ki Joon.

30
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:23,000
Tell it to me straight.

31
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,400
Why did you go to the rooftop that day?

32
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:40,850
   

33
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:49,520
What's happening right now?

34
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,700
"Expelled"?

35
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:54,590
How can it be so easy?

36
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:56,490
Why expel him without even investigating?

37
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:58,150
Expelled?

38
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:00,480
- Who is expelled? 
 - What?

39
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:04,250
No, it's nothing.

40
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:08,730
I don't think it's nothing.

41
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:12,660
Mr. Lee really looked ready to expel him.

42
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,200
Nothing will happen, right?

43
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,060
Hey. Of course, nothing will happen.

44
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:19,890
We know it definitely wasn't Gong Ki Joon.

45
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:21,730
Right.

46
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:35,200
 Timing and Subtitles by the ðŸŽ¶ Sing for a dream ðŸŽ¤ Team @ viki 

47
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:44,550
   

48
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:08,050
 Whose is this? 

49
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:17,170
 It's not mine. 

50
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:19,940
 Then the person there earlier was... 

51
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:27,020
Wow, Gong Ki Joon is crazy.

52
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:28,410
I know, right?

53
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:31,510
How can he think of ruining Director Gu's car?

54
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:32,780
So cool!

55
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:35,630
What's so cool? He could be expelled for messing around.

56
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:38,320
- I guess? 
 - Whatâ€”

57
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,560
Wh-What is it?

58
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,030
What did you just say?

59
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:44,210
Gong Ki Joon is what?

60
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:49,960
- Hurry and tell me. 
 - N-No, it's just...

61
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,940
The one who threw the flowerpot and broke Director Gu's carâ€¦

62
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:55,410
I heard it's G-G-Gong Ki Joon.

63
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:57,920
What nonsense is that?

64
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,630
- Are you lying to me? 
 - It's t-true.

65
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:03,250
Mr. L-Lee Han Soo found definitive evidence.

66
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:09,130
The key chain that Gong Ki Joon used to carry around was found where the flowerpot was.

67
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:11,300
"Key chain"?

68
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:22,950
Let's go, let's go.

69
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:40,890
 Bring your parents tomorrow. 

70
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:59,980
Were you waiting for me, by any chance?

71
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:03,580
Is it fun for you?

72
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:06,780
- What is it this time? 
 - I heard you're getting expelled.

73
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:10,150
They said you're the one who threw the flowerpot at Director Gu's car from the rooftop.

74
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:13,330
News travels fast.

75
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:15,820
I thought you didn't care about me.

76
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,570
I did it.

77
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:22,120
I know.

78
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:27,620
Mr. Lee showed me a familiar looking key chain

79
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,560
and told me it was evidence.

80
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:38,760
But I have mine here.

81
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,620
So why did you keep quiet?

82
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:51,730
Doesnâ€™t it end if you show them yours and say the other one isnâ€™t yours?

83
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:57,470
That two people have the same key chainâ€”

84
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:59,890
Just say that one person is dead,

85
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:03,430
and that the other one is in the same class as you!

86
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:06,830
Why did you throw the flowerpot?

87
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,560
Is it related to why you came to this school?

88
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,440
You don't need to know that.

89
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,460
But I have to know.

90
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:21,170
Tell me.

91
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:24,660
Hey.

92
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:27,390
Do you think you're something?

93
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:29,350
Don't meddle.

94
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:32,300
Tomorrow, I will go and tell them it was me.

95
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:37,300
Why did you do it?

96
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,880
What on earth happened after that day?

97
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:48,870
I told you not to meddle.

98
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:51,140
You murderer.

99
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:43,670
 You'll get better in no time. 

100
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:46,640
 I'll keep praying every day. 

101
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,620
 Have strength. Okay? 

102
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,840
 Thank you. 

103
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:57,420
 Why are you telling me that? 

104
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,820
 I feel bad about Cheol Joo, too, 

105
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:04,770
 - but a no is a no. 
 - Don't say that. 

106
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:09,200
 There are only a few days left until the trial. Please put in a good word to the company. 

107
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,880
 You have relations at that company, 

108
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,330
 and Cheol Joo was a student at this school. 

109
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:15,490
 I beg you, Director Gu. 

110
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:19,430
 Ma'am, I realize you're in a dire situation, 

111
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:21,910
 but insisting doesn't solve everything. 

112
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:24,500
 That's what beggars do. 

113
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:26,780
 Excuse me? 

114
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:35,390
 Let's go, Young Joo. 

115
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,390
 What is it this time? 

116
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:55,030
 I told you not to look at me pitifully. 

117
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:57,920
 When did I do that? 

118
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,070
 I was looking at you pathetically. Your room is so messy. 

119
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,460
 Sleep. 

120
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,360
 Tomorrow's schedule. 

121
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,500
 Kang Seo Young: Walk to school together at 7:45 a.m. from the central bookstore. 

122
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,650
 Have lunch in the cafeteria together. 

123
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:37,140
 And also, be my dancesport partner during P.E. (Physical Education). 

124
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:55,800
 Jung Young Joo: I can't do it anymore. I'm quitting school. 

125
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:17,700
I'm home.

126
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:20,440
Wha...

127
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:24,860
Wh-What's going on?

128
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:29,380
Ki Joon, come and eat. Don't just stand there.

129
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:31,510
Come on, hurry.

130
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:45,150
Why are you barging in into someone's home?

131
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:47,470
Grandpa said to, so I did.

132
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:50,360
So why didn't you pick up my call?

133
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,470
My phone is dead.

134
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:03,290
Why is your house like this?

135
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:05,130
What are all these red tags?

136
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:06,840
Never mind them.

137
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:10,240
- Why are you here? 
 - How long has this been going on?

138
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,850
It's a long story.

139
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:14,940
You don't need to know.

140
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:20,400
What's up with that key chain? Is it yours?

141
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,700
It's not mine.

142
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,010
Then whose is it?

143
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:25,990
- Do you know whose it is? 
 - No, I don't.

144
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:27,980
I wouldn't know even if I knew.

145
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,370
Seriously, why are you being like this?

146
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:33,540
Why did you say it was yours?

147
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:36,220
Leave. Stop poking your nose into my business.

148
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:38,490
Go to the office tomorrow morning and tell the truth.

149
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:39,670
Tell them it wasn't you.

150
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:42,300
- Ho Sung and I will go withâ€” 
 - Are you still here?

151
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,420
I'm changing.

152
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:48,020
I'll wait in front of the office until you come.

153
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:22,020
Grandpa, I'm leaving now.

154
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:24,980
Oh, Ji Won. Come here for a second.

155
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,800
Look... Yours...

156
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,420
Do you remember?

157
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:35,180
This is...

158
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:40,550
You were so tiny and so good at planing*. 
  (Woodwork technique) 

159
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:42,800
So this was here.

160
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,860
You were really harsh back then.

161
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:47,540
Even if you fought with Ki Joon,

162
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:50,730
I'm also your friend, not just Ki Joon's.

163
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:52,890
I'm sorry.

164
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:55,170
Come over often.

165
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:59,290
Once we move, you won't be able to visit, even if you want to.

166
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:00,690
Okay.

167
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:05,480
   

168
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:35,370
 Why is your house like this? 

169
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:37,740
 What are all these red tags? 

170
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,370
 Never mind them. 

171
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:42,110
 They're recruiting one more apprentice. 

172
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:43,080
 Me too. 

173
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,430
 Hey, Gong Ki Joon. 

174
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:46,330
 Why does an apprenticeship interest you? 

175
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:47,890
 You don't even know what it is. 

176
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:49,290
 Am I not allowed to be? 

177
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:52,370
 The new part-timer you told me about. Is it him? 

178
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:54,810
 You keep hanging around me. 

179
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:57,180
 Sorry you keep getting involved with me, 

180
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:59,360
 but I don't have the freedom to avoid you these days. 

181
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,780
 I hope you understand. 

182
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:02,330
 Does anyone want to do this with me? 

183
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:04,500
 Carpentry competition? 

184
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,220
 The prize money is 10 million won (~US$8,500). 

185
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:07,860
 I'll do it too. 

186
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:15,760
 So it was it true that you needed money? 

187
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:26,970
- Yes? 
 -  Time for a late night snack. 

188
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:29,130
The menu is spicy tteokbokki and Ji Soo's buying.

189
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:34,330
If you're going to argue with Mom again, don't bother and come only if you'll eat quietly without fighting.

190
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:35,700
Did mom say that?

191
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:38,270
 - No, Ji Soo did.  
 - Fine.

192
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:40,900
Okay.

193
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,940
You always overdo it when you can't even eat spicy food.

194
00:15:58,940 --> 00:15:59,970
What?

195
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:03,370
I like eating it. I just choked on it.

196
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:04,550
Youâ€”

197
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:06,860
Jin Ji Won. Mom.

198
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:08,130
Didn't you hear my warning?

199
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:10,620
I relayed the message.

200
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:16,350
Oh, right...

201
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:20,460
Dad, did something go wrong with Ki Joon's dad's business?

202
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:23,620
Grandpa said they're moving.

203
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:27,640
Oh, you didn't know.

204
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:31,290
Ki Joon's family is going through a rough time.

205
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:34,100
Ki Joon's dad overdid it.

206
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:40,680
I heard the house was going to be auctioned, but I guess it's sold already.

207
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:50,000
   

208
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:01,200
What?

209
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,620
Do you feel guilty every time you see it?

210
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:15,780
Are you going to turn yourself in?

211
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:18,700
Yes.

212
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,420
Whaâ€”

213
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:23,300
Are you really going to confess?

214
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:25,520
Director Gu says she will press charges.

215
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,740
Do you know what that means? Your life will be over!

216
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:30,410
Hey. Hey!

217
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:33,360
I'll just pretend I never sawâ€”

218
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,180
Hey!

219
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,160
Oh, hi.

220
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,090
What's he thinking?

221
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:45,090
- Hello. 
 - Hi.

222
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:52,540
So you threw the flowerpot?

223
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,010
Why would you?

224
00:17:56,180 --> 00:18:00,750
I was just up on the rooftop to rest.

225
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:03,190
And I nudged it by accident.

226
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:05,620
It was a mistake...

227
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:10,610
That heavy thing... by mistake?

228
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:14,930
If it wasn't a mistake, then what?

229
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,370
What is it?

230
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:35,720
Don't do what you're planning to do.

231
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:41,350
Hey. Mind your business and don't cross the line.

232
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:45,230
If you're the culprit, you'll be expelled and go to juvie.

233
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:47,850
But with Lee Jae Hee, it'll be like it didn't happen.

234
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:51,240
- What does that mean? Why would sheâ€” 
 - Watch and find out.

235
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:55,410
You can step forward if it looks like Lee Jae Hee will suffer a disadvantage.

236
00:18:57,850 --> 00:19:02,060
Think of your family. Don't act childish.

237
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:05,530
Why are you doing all this?

238
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:07,970
Is the fake boyfriend act so important to you?

239
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:10,280
It doesn't have to be me.

240
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:13,940
The club.

241
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:17,820
The carpentry club I mentioned. Do that.

242
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:20,070
- What? 
 - Lee Jae Hee's in the club, too.

243
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:24,670
Be a part of it and make it up to Lee Jae Hee, and make it up to me, too.

244
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:31,030
Anyway, come to the carpentry room later, by 3 p.m. Got it?

245
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,950
 The flowerpot. 

246
00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:00,360
 Can you say you knocked it over? 

247
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:02,280
 What? 

248
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:05,620
 You and your twin manipulate the school's competition score, 

249
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:08,480
 and Mr. Lee Han Soo adjusts your student records. 

250
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,510
 I know it all, and I have the evidence. 

251
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:15,160
 If I report it to the Ministry of Education, they won't let it slide. 

252
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:18,120
 And if there was an article about it, it would be a bigger issue. 

253
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,520
 Are you threatening me? 

254
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,370
 What? 

255
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:29,750
 Or... 

256
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,820
 If it's a request, I'll do it. 

257
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:06,230
Jae Hee?

258
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:08,950
Yes, that's what she told me.

259
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:12,700
She said so herself, so there was nothing else I could do.

260
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:22,770
   

261
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,220
- Aigoo. 
 - Let's go.

262
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:32,250
I'm off to class.

263
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:33,200
Have a good one.

264
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,360
I'm heading out.

265
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,110
All right.

266
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,310
Hey, hey, hey.

267
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,900
That. Do you know what happened?

268
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:50,660
There's a girl named Jae Hee in my class.

269
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:53,490
She said she did it by accident.

270
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:57,720
I didn't even know and almost pursued innocent children.

271
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,600
Jae Hee...

272
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,040
Who is she?

273
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,630
 A club? 

274
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:06,610
 Jae Hee and Jae Hyuk would make three. 

275
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:10,650
 I don't want to do it with them. 

276
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:15,230
Oh... the twins.

277
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:18,870
Perhaps... could that child

278
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:21,380
have been threatened by someone

279
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:24,060
or beaten? It can't be, right?

280
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:25,730
What are you talking about?

281
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:28,490
Who would dare threaten Jae Hee?

282
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:37,070
So aren't you expelled?

283
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:38,400
Anyway...

284
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,970
this school threatens anyone without properly looking into things.

285
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:44,070
Seriously, I don't like it.

286
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:50,570
What happened with that key chain?

287
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:52,420
Whose is it then?

288
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,280
Oh! She's here!

289
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:04,760
Who is?

290
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:07,310
Who is here?

291
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:11,370
- Unni! 
 - Hello, Unni.

292
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:13,190
- Hello, Unni. 
 - You're so pretty today.

293
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:15,570
Noona, isn't this a limited-edition watch?

294
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:17,010
- Wow. 
 - Awesome.

295
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:18,680
I heard only celebrities got these.

296
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:22,000
Did your agency get one for you, by any chance?

297
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,840
Yes, I guess so.

298
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,030
- Wow. 
 - It looks so good on you.

299
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:28,450
Oh, right. When is news of your debut going out?

300
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:31,600
- Pardon? 
 - I heard it's pretty soon.

301
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,120
Bulls***.

302
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:36,330
All hail the celebrity.

303
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:38,950
Hey, Go Eun Bi.

304
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:43,850
If you flirt with Ji Gyum oppa again, I'll kill you.

305
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:45,700
Hey.

306
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:49,240
- Tell him not to hit on me. 
 - What?

307
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:52,570
Hey! All right, all right.

308
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:53,770
Don't be so sensitive.

309
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:56,840
They're with the same agency so they're just friendly.

310
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:57,880
Let's go, Eun Bi.

311
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:04,620
I saw your agency's trainees having a rally event the day before.

312
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:06,700
I didn't see you in the photo.

313
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,120
Are you banished?

314
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,760
Hey, come on...

315
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,550
Let's go, Eun Bi. Ignoring haters takes practice.

316
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:14,590
Only listen to the positives.

317
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:15,630
Annoying.

318
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:17,150
Seriously.

319
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:19,630
Only listen to the positives, okay?

320
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,950
Well.

321
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:51,950
You guys are all in the same class, so you don't need an introduction, right?

322
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,310
As you may all know, we will be preparing for Jin Sung University's

323
00:24:58,310 --> 00:25:01,720
carpentry competition next month.

324
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:04,290
This is... wow...

325
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:08,160
This is a competition that only uses hand tools.

326
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:11,500
All right. For now,

327
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:14,600
I will do it because of a certain someone.

328
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:17,820
But this is really not an easy job.

329
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:19,660
Okay. Let's take a look.

330
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:21,110
Firstâ€”

331
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:34,640
Wh-What is it?

332
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,820
Excuse me?

333
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:39,440
Why? Are you here looking for someone?

334
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:47,650
A-Are you possibly here for the club?

335
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:49,160
Y-You aren't, right?

336
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,710
I am.

337
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:55,080
Oh, I see.

338
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,720
Sit.

339
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:06,290
We will start in a minute.

340
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:31,640
   

341
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:54,120
I'm so tired.

342
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,460
We're too old for a place like this.

343
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:59,180
It's not like it's a picnic, right?

344
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:03,460
What? I like coming out here after being in the office every day.

345
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:13,350
Hey, isn't it amazing?

346
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:17,980
I heard Jung Young Joo joined your club to follow his girlfriend.

347
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:21,730
I thought he was scary, but I guess he's a romantic!

348
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:26,580
It's an odd combination, as I see it.

349
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:28,250
Isn't it?

350
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:33,410
It's odd to me.

351
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:35,340
Oh, my God!

352
00:27:39,970 --> 00:27:42,700
I think they're talking s*** about us back there.

353
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:44,740
They must be talking s*** about you.

354
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:46,510
Incredible.

355
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:48,740
Why do you think that?

356
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:51,710
They don't like you.

357
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:55,440
Hey, they're scared of me. You're the one they don't like.

358
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,640
Let's say it's that, then.

359
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,620
Wow.

360
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:11,440
Wow, so a place like this exists?

361
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,800
It's nice.

362
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,070
Sure is.

363
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:15,780
Our students come here every year.

364
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:16,800
I see.

365
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,940
It's an excuse.

366
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:20,660
It's just to let them breathe a little.

367
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:28,670
Those two are always together.

368
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:30,940
Are they close because they're twins?

369
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:32,410
Close?

370
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:34,790
They hate each other.

371
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:36,680
Then why do they hang out together?

372
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:40,320
Who else would they hang out with?

373
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:45,900
Who are they exactly?

374
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,220
You'll find out soon.

375
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:51,340
It's Panda!

376
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:52,720
Panda?

377
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,680
- Where? 
 - Panda, Panda!

378
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,930
P-Panda! Panda!

379
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,770
What's a panda?

380
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:01,710
Come here!

381
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:03,540
- Is someone getting beaten up*? 
 - Who? 
  ("Beaten up" in Korean sounds like "panda") 

382
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:05,180
What?

383
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,840
So cute!

384
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:15,070
Panda!

385
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,460
I guess it's here today.

386
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:36,230
Why? What is it? Is it famous?

387
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:37,600
It's no joke.

388
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:41,200
The panda is so good at dancing. It's the coolest thing in town these days.

389
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,830
I heard that the panda earns double what it used to.

390
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:45,610
I should have practiced my moves.

391
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:04,460
It just sent me a heart!

392
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:06,610
It really is cute.

393
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:10,890
So cute!

394
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:28,150
Thank you!

395
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:30,030
Hurry, hurry!

396
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:31,990
- Shut up! 
 - I want to do it, too!

397
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:34,850
- Your arm is longer! 
 - I'll get one for you later.

398
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:36,070
Take one for me.

399
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:37,140
I don't want to.

400
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:39,550
I'll take one of you later.

401
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:41,970
Hey.

402
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,430
Move.

403
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:46,000
- What? 
 - Move.

404
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,990
I can't see the words.

405
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:51,540
Oh.

406
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,800
You do it.

407
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,470
Really?

408
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:23,250
Oh? Isn't that the panda from earlier?

409
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:24,690
- Did you see its face? 
 - No, I didn't.

410
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:26,450
- I wonder who it is. 
 - Me, too.

411
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:28,300
Why aren't you taking it off?

412
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,710
Aren't you hot?

413
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:32,130
- I'll take it off for you. 
 - No, it's okay.

414
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:33,930
It's okay.

415
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:36,800
What the heck?

416
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,660
Actually...

417
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:40,440
Can I leave early?

418
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,370
What are you talking about?

419
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:43,790
What are we supposed to do?

420
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:47,110
We have to finish as a team to get the money.

421
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:49,510
You can wear this costume.

422
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:52,960
Hey! But I can't dance.

423
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:56,020
I'm going to go crazy.

424
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:58,890
- Look at that panda. It's so cute! 
- Let's ask for a picture later.

425
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:01,190
Seriously so cute, look.

426
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:02,920
I really want one.

427
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,170
Guys, let's take a picture.

428
00:32:04,170 --> 00:32:05,690
Gather around. Come on.

429
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:08,910
Ms. Song says, gather around!

430
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:11,550
Gather around!

431
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:13,730
- Take one with us, Mr. Lee. 
 - No, no.

432
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:15,300
- I'm going to take it! 
 - Okay!

433
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,820
Should we do "fighting" or a "V"?

434
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:18,750
- Let's do that! 
 - Oh!

435
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:20,220
Over there, Panda!

436
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:21,570
Take a photo with us!

437
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:23,370
Come on!

438
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:28,020
Hurry, come on!

439
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:30,470
So cute!

440
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:34,300
Okay! One, two, three!

441
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:42,410
Oh, no!

442
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:44,350
Oh, my God.

443
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:46,260
Isn't that Go Eun Bi?

444
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:48,900
Eun Bi.

445
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:51,240
What's going on?

446
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,520
Eun Bi, Eun Bi, are you okay?

447
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,100
- Oh my God. 
 - Are you okay?

448
00:32:56,650 --> 00:32:57,870
Let's go inside for now.

449
00:32:57,870 --> 00:32:59,600
Eun Bi, come on. Let's go.

450
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,190
Eun Bi, that hurt, right? Let's go.

451
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:06,280
What's going on?

452
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:21,600
Why? So what? Should I upload it to the group chat?

453
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:29,430
Eun Bi!

454
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:42,110
I'm home.

455
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:45,230
Hey, Jin Ji Won. She's from your school, right?

456
00:33:46,050 --> 00:33:47,430
How do you know Eun Bi?

457
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:49,230
I'm subscribed to her channel.

458
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:50,640
Are you a fan of Eun Bi?

459
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:53,390
No. I'm a fan of Han Ji Gyum.

460
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:55,460
It looks like she's close to Han Ji Gyum,

461
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:59,460
so I get notified to dislike her videos every time one uploads.

462
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:01,570
Do you want to know something crazy?

463
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:05,910
You know that panda that pops up everywhere and dances really well?

464
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:07,340
It's her.

465
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:08,760
I see.

466
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,770
There was a post on Ji Gyum's fan cafÃ©.

467
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:12,600
It seems she was fired as a trainee and

468
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,340
makes a fortune in this costume job.

469
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:16,530
Wow. I'm so jealous.

470
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:19,140
- "She was fired"? 
 - Yes.

471
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:21,990
How can you not know anything about your classmate?

472
00:34:21,990 --> 00:34:24,280
You're so inconsiderate.

473
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:27,290
It must be so nice to be you.

474
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:29,250
You have so much consideration.

475
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:37,390
Was that a compliment?

476
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:39,910
Sure.

477
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:01,740
Hey, Kang Seo Young.

478
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:09,370
What is it?

479
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:12,890
It's just a coincidence.

480
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,110
You know...

481
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:22,260
What is it? Just say it.

482
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:29,630
What do I do?

483
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:33,490
I think the news is spreading that I was fired from being a trainee.

484
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:35,680
Do people at school know?

485
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,910
Should I ask the agency to say that I'm the one who quit?

486
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:40,400
Or...

487
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:46,860
Should I just drop out of school?

488
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,120
It's true, isn't it?

489
00:35:55,790 --> 00:35:58,360
It's true that you were fired as a trainee.

490
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,770
Just say it's true and walk your own path.

491
00:36:00,770 --> 00:36:02,650
That's all.

492
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:06,490
- Is that easy? 
 - Won't you do it just because it's hard?

493
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,340
Fine.

494
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:20,240
I don't know what I expected from you.

495
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:34,230
Hey. Here she comes.

496
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:35,780
Here comes the panda.

497
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:37,840
Look at her face.

498
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,440
She looks so depressed.

499
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,740
She looks ready to cry.

500
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,630
Poor thing.

501
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:45,220
After all that showing off.

502
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:46,460
- Poor thing. 
 - Boohoo.

503
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:49,180
She was so proud just a few days ago.

504
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:51,230
Does she think anyone can be in a girl group?

505
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:52,970
Hilarious.

506
00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:55,080
Hi, Panda.

507
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,380
She deserves it.

508
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,200
If she could be an idol, so could I.

509
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,600
They must have picked her randomly.

510
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,030
Well...

511
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,670
I realize everyone has their own preferences,

512
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:09,990
but I think it's a little weird that the bathroom is bigger than the kitchen.

513
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:13,400
- All right, good work. 
 - Okay.

514
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:15,610
Mr. Shin,

515
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:17,500
is personal choice a part of the critique?

516
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:20,040
Aren't we only supposed to look at measurements or something?

517
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:22,770
- The measurements are all off too. 
 - I see.

518
00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:25,420
Then, I accept it.

519
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:27,770
Sit back down.

520
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:31,990
Then, whose shall we look at next?

521
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:35,910
Go Eun Bi to the front.

522
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:38,110
Did you do it?

523
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:48,860
What? Eun Bi, you didn't finish yours.

524
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:51,410
Eun Bi, you've been busy, right?

525
00:37:51,410 --> 00:37:52,640
I'm sorry.

526
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,840
Go Eun Bi has a lot of time.

527
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,410
We still need to do a critique.

528
00:37:58,410 --> 00:38:01,210
So... who will do it?

529
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,390
Seo Young?

530
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:06,530
Okay.

531
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,640
First, she misused the dimension line

532
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:21,610
and the additional dimension line here.

533
00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:24,730
If you look here, the level is off.

534
00:38:24,730 --> 00:38:27,370
She should have started over,

535
00:38:27,370 --> 00:38:30,160
but she tried to get away with it by tricking the eye,

536
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:33,050
and it looks like it ended up being a mess.

537
00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:36,170
Seriously.

538
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:40,490
Oh...

539
00:38:40,490 --> 00:38:43,360
Right, you're right.

540
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:46,050
But it's not really about tricking the eye.

541
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:50,100
It's not as easy as it looks, right?

542
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:54,210
Eun Bi, hand it in again after you finish it.

543
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:55,970
Okay?

544
00:38:55,970 --> 00:38:57,420
All right.

545
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:04,200
Seo Young, shall we see yours since you're out here?

546
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:09,510
Okay.

547
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:13,280
Wow. That house is a mansion.

548
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:16,370
Yes, how many rooms are there?

549
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,280
- Mr. Shin. 
 - Yes?

550
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:27,050
I will do the critique since I'm up here.

551
00:39:27,050 --> 00:39:29,450
Oh, okay.

552
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,520
Can you give that here?

553
00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:43,170
Yes, this is Seo Young's house, but...

554
00:39:43,170 --> 00:39:46,910
I don't think the floor plan is detailed enough.

555
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:49,470
You should have written down the room names.

556
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:52,700
Here is Room Hope.

557
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:54,580
This is Room Love.

558
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:56,330
This is...

559
00:39:56,330 --> 00:39:57,590
Room Grace.

560
00:39:57,590 --> 00:40:01,000
Oh, what room were you in?

561
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:04,190
You were in Room Hope last year.

562
00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:24,380
You're wrong.

563
00:40:29,690 --> 00:40:31,910
This is the director's room.

564
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:35,430
This is my room.

565
00:40:40,370 --> 00:40:44,760
I lived here, here, and here.

566
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:50,180
I lived at this orphanage the longest, other than the director.

567
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:16,880
Isn't she the worst?

568
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,090
I never liked Kang Seo Young either,

569
00:41:19,090 --> 00:41:20,530
but this isn't right.

570
00:41:20,530 --> 00:41:22,930
- Didn't they used to be close? 
 - I guess.

571
00:41:22,930 --> 00:41:25,720
Even if she was driven to a corner,

572
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:28,600
how could she expose her friend like that?

573
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:29,770
I know, right?

574
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:32,090
I don't mind an annoying b*tch,

575
00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:34,420
but I can't take a disloyal b*tch.

576
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:37,480
She must've thought she could cover up her own issue.

577
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:40,050
Gosh, it makes me sick.

578
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:42,810
- What? 
 - What's she doing?

579
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:48,530
- Aigoo. 
 - Eun Bi!

580
00:41:48,530 --> 00:41:50,310
Eun Bi!

581
00:41:50,310 --> 00:41:52,230
Ah, even her leaving asks for attention.

582
00:41:52,230 --> 00:41:53,550
- Seriously. 
 - So annoying.

583
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:56,350
Hate that...

584
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:10,590
Are you okay?

585
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:16,740
The guys will quieten down in a few days.

586
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:18,810
I've experienced it before so I knowâ€”

587
00:42:18,810 --> 00:42:20,390
Hey.

588
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:23,480
Can you leave?

589
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:25,570
What?

590
00:42:25,570 --> 00:42:30,000
I came out here since it's too noisy in there, so if you can't be quiet, just leave.

591
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:32,890
I have to study.

592
00:42:52,410 --> 00:42:54,260
Eun Bi!

593
00:42:55,810 --> 00:42:57,550
Don't follow me!

594
00:42:57,550 --> 00:43:01,960
If you follow me, I'll kill myself!

595
00:43:07,290 --> 00:43:09,040
Eun Bi...

596
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:22,650
Orphanage?

597
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:25,380
Oh my God.

598
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:28,460
I held her in check for no reason.

599
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:30,800
The needy,

600
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:38,340
I guess they have to work hard.

601
00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:44,190
Hey.

602
00:43:44,190 --> 00:43:46,030
Shut up.

603
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:02,820
Aigoo...

604
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,620
   

605
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:17,830
Pick it up.

606
00:44:17,830 --> 00:44:20,710
I have no time. Focus.

607
00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:40,890
So good work today.

608
00:44:40,890 --> 00:44:46,210
I know it can be hard since it's your first timeâ€”

609
00:44:46,210 --> 00:44:47,750
What is she doing?

610
00:44:58,780 --> 00:44:59,860
 Seo Young... 

611
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:02,140
 I heard Eun Bi left school without saying anything. 

612
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:05,330
 I called the agency. They said she has already quit. 

613
00:45:05,330 --> 00:45:08,820
 She's not picking up her phone, and I think it's turned off now. 

614
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:12,200
 Seo Young, what do we do with my Eun Bi? 

615
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:37,470
You're here.

616
00:45:37,470 --> 00:45:39,950
How many rounds has she gone?

617
00:45:39,950 --> 00:45:41,930
I don't know.

618
00:45:41,930 --> 00:45:44,540
Geez, this is why you're going out of business.

619
00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:48,090
Stop it, please.

620
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:58,380
Get off.

621
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:01,170
Why? Leave me alone!

622
00:46:01,170 --> 00:46:03,040
- I said, get off. 
 - Mind your own business!

623
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:06,370
Since when did you care about me?

624
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:31,340
   

625
00:46:55,820 --> 00:46:58,780
 Hey, you're the top of our class, right? 

626
00:46:58,780 --> 00:46:59,770
 Yes. 

627
00:46:59,770 --> 00:47:01,320
 Why do you always get on here? 

628
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:03,170
 Do you live there? 

629
00:47:04,910 --> 00:47:06,410
 I do. 

630
00:47:29,770 --> 00:47:31,680
 What are you listening to? 

631
00:47:55,550 --> 00:47:57,550
 Kang Seo Young! 

632
00:47:57,550 --> 00:47:59,580
 Come on, get off now! 

633
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:02,120
 I thought we were going to eat together. 

634
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:04,180
 Kang Seo Young! 

635
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:06,020
 Seo Young! 

636
00:48:06,020 --> 00:48:07,550
 Kang Seo Young! 

637
00:48:07,550 --> 00:48:09,370
 Can you hear me? 

638
00:48:09,370 --> 00:48:12,550
 Seo Young, let's go! 

639
00:48:12,550 --> 00:48:15,570
 Kang Seo Young! 

640
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:29,420
What are you doing?

641
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:31,590
Your mom keeps calling me.

642
00:48:31,590 --> 00:48:33,840
How did you know I was here?

643
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:37,790
Weren't you riding this and crying, and hoping I would come and see you?

644
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:42,830
B*tch.

645
00:48:42,830 --> 00:48:44,900
You were today's b*tch in anyone's eyes.

646
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:46,200
So?

647
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:47,970
How does it feel to have your secret known?

648
00:48:47,970 --> 00:48:50,390
Do you know how I feel now?

649
00:48:51,430 --> 00:48:52,530
I don't.

650
00:48:52,530 --> 00:48:55,780
You keep thinking you're better than everyone, don't you?

651
00:48:56,930 --> 00:49:00,770
That I lived at an orphanage and that you were fired are all just facts.

652
00:49:00,770 --> 00:49:04,050
I said to shut up about that "facts" talk!

653
00:49:04,050 --> 00:49:06,560
What I'm trying to say isâ€”

654
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:12,460
It's not our fault.

655
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:16,660
My living at an orphanage...

656
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:19,560
Your quitting being a trainee...

657
00:49:22,690 --> 00:49:25,260
They're not our fault.

658
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:31,930
It's just a fact that we were unlucky.

659
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:38,200
I...

660
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:40,500
I am at fault.

661
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:42,460
I didn't work hard. No...

662
00:49:42,460 --> 00:49:44,730
I did work hard...

663
00:49:44,730 --> 00:49:47,390
but I didn't work myself to death, no...

664
00:49:47,390 --> 00:49:50,130
I did work hard clenching my teeth...

665
00:49:50,130 --> 00:49:53,250
but none of it worked out!

666
00:49:59,250 --> 00:50:01,370
Then reflect on what you did wrong,

667
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:05,130
and just try again.

668
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:10,390
Work harder from now on.

669
00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:12,790
Got it?

670
00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:16,410
So you'll make me look like the b*tch out in the open.

671
00:51:17,190 --> 00:51:19,220
It's smart.

672
00:51:19,770 --> 00:51:22,350
I am quite smart, you know,

673
00:51:22,350 --> 00:51:24,550
even though my personality sucks.

674
00:51:25,990 --> 00:51:27,430
So you know.

675
00:51:27,430 --> 00:51:29,360
I thought you didn't know.

676
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:31,200
How could I not?

677
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:44,480
What?

678
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:48,040
They were fighting just yesterday. What are they doing now?

679
00:51:53,450 --> 00:51:57,090
 Every action has a hidden reason. 

680
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:00,000
- You're eating well. 
 - Eat yours.

681
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,790
- It's mine. 
 - So rude...

682
00:52:22,790 --> 00:52:26,930
   

683
00:52:26,930 --> 00:52:29,180
Where is it?

684
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:47,840
What are you doing?

685
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:54,100
Aunt, I thought you bought me a birthday present.

686
00:52:54,100 --> 00:52:55,890
Where did you put it?

687
00:52:56,890 --> 00:52:58,750
The third drawer.

688
00:53:02,370 --> 00:53:03,760
Wow! Awesome!

689
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:04,860
This is a great one.

690
00:53:04,860 --> 00:53:06,220
Do you like it that much?

691
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:08,500
Of course!

692
00:53:15,310 --> 00:53:17,460
Sweetie!

693
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:19,620
I'm late again, sorry.

694
00:53:19,620 --> 00:53:21,930
It's okay. It's not the first time.

695
00:53:21,930 --> 00:53:24,170
Thanks for thinking of it like that.

696
00:53:24,170 --> 00:53:26,670
Oh, yes. Thank you.

697
00:53:26,670 --> 00:53:28,210
Say goodbye to the teacher.

698
00:53:28,210 --> 00:53:29,730
- Goodbye. 
 - Bye.

699
00:53:29,730 --> 00:53:31,410
- Goodbye. 
 - Goodbye.

700
00:53:31,410 --> 00:53:33,380
Thank you.

701
00:53:59,330 --> 00:54:03,320
   

702
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:06,450
This one is for you, right?

703
00:54:07,590 --> 00:54:08,780
Do you want this one?

704
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:10,290
All right, good.

705
00:54:10,290 --> 00:54:11,930
Here you go.

706
00:54:11,930 --> 00:54:13,630
All right, next!

707
00:54:13,630 --> 00:54:15,630
Good, good.

708
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:27,670
Ahjussi, are you strong?

709
00:54:27,670 --> 00:54:30,160
I'm not an ahjussi.

710
00:54:30,970 --> 00:54:32,640
But I'm strong.

711
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:34,030
Aigoo, aigoo.

712
00:54:34,030 --> 00:54:36,760
Lift me up!

713
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:38,160
Do you want to go up?

714
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:39,690
You're so adorable.

715
00:54:39,690 --> 00:54:41,610
Let me lift up the other girls.

716
00:54:41,610 --> 00:54:44,410
- Do you want me to hug you? Let me hug the others. 
 - Lift me up!

717
00:54:44,410 --> 00:54:46,940
Hug me!

718
00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:50,510
Give me a hug!

719
00:54:50,510 --> 00:54:52,070
Let's take a picture.

720
00:54:52,070 --> 00:54:54,090
Guys, look at the camera.

721
00:54:54,090 --> 00:54:57,590
- All right. Smile! 
 - Keep smiling.

722
00:54:57,590 --> 00:55:01,060
Ready, one, two, three!

723
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:05,840
You seem close to Ji Won again.

724
00:55:07,430 --> 00:55:09,090
Do I?

725
00:55:10,780 --> 00:55:12,910
Are you guys going back to your old days?

726
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:15,380
"Old days"?

727
00:55:16,350 --> 00:55:18,520
- What about the old days? 
 - Geez...

728
00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:24,790
I mean, you guys are each other's first love.

729
00:55:24,790 --> 00:55:26,920
What are youâ€”

730
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:28,640
- We are not. 
 - What?

731
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:31,750
You're suspicious. Don't be embarrassed and tell me.

732
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:34,460
You like Ji Won, right?

733
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:44,010
 Are you crazy? 

734
00:55:44,010 --> 00:55:46,920
 Would you date a girl like Jin Ji Won? 

735
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:48,370
 Isn't it true? 

736
00:55:48,370 --> 00:55:52,430
 I saw you two dating yesterday. 

737
00:55:52,430 --> 00:55:54,380
 Why would I date Jin Ji Won? 

738
00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:55,950
 I think you are. 

739
00:55:55,950 --> 00:55:57,770
 I'm really not! 

740
00:55:57,770 --> 00:56:00,550
 Don't say that. It's embarrassing. 

741
00:56:03,750 --> 00:56:05,760
 I saw you! 

742
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:07,520
 I'm not! 

743
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:09,490
 I saw everything. 

744
00:56:09,490 --> 00:56:11,760
 I mean it. I'm not. 

745
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:17,740
 Hey, Gong Ki Joon! 

746
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:31,860
 - Gong Ki Joon is crying. 
 - Are you crying after being punched by a girl? 

747
00:56:31,860 --> 00:56:36,050
 Crybaby! Crybaby! 

748
00:56:36,050 --> 00:56:39,950
 Crybaby! Crybaby! 

749
00:56:39,950 --> 00:56:43,050
 Crybaby! Crybaby! 

750
00:56:43,050 --> 00:56:47,330
 Crybaby! Crybaby! 

751
00:56:47,330 --> 00:56:50,020
 Crybaby! Crybaby! 

752
00:56:50,020 --> 00:56:52,190
 Hey, stop that! 

753
00:56:52,190 --> 00:56:54,870
 Stop that! 

754
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:37,780
 Every action... 

755
00:57:38,370 --> 00:57:41,260
 has a hidden meaning. 

756
00:57:41,260 --> 00:57:42,340
Open it.

757
00:57:42,340 --> 00:57:45,110
 Someone's excessive kindness... 

758
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:48,760
Did you have fun today, Sweetie?

759
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:51,010
Come on, Sweetie.

760
00:57:51,010 --> 00:57:52,150
Are you angry?

761
00:57:52,150 --> 00:57:53,710
 Someone leaving work on time... 

762
00:57:53,710 --> 00:57:55,330
Come on, tell me!

763
00:57:55,330 --> 00:57:57,800
All right, look at the camera, everyone.

764
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:01,600
Ready, one, two, three!

765
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:05,900
 Even someone's odd proposal for a contract-relationship... 

766
00:58:07,970 --> 00:58:12,930
 The true reasons are hidden from others. 

767
00:58:22,290 --> 00:58:24,510
 And... 

768
00:58:24,510 --> 00:58:27,880
 I have a reason, too. 

769
00:59:02,210 --> 00:59:04,440
What are you doing here so late?

770
00:59:05,070 --> 00:59:07,440
Are you busy right now?

771
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:09,470
Why?

772
00:59:09,470 --> 00:59:13,560
Well, I have something I need to do with you.

773
00:59:16,460 --> 00:59:19,220
- Right now? 
 - Yes.

774
00:59:19,220 --> 00:59:21,060
Right now.

775
00:59:30,490 --> 00:59:37,390
 Timing and Subtitles by the ðŸŽ¶ Sing for a dream ðŸŽ¤ Team @ viki 

776
00:59:45,110 --> 00:59:47,370
I...

777
00:59:47,370 --> 00:59:49,840
want to try again.

788
01:00:58,440 --> 01:00:59,710
 Go easy. 

789
01:00:59,710 --> 01:01:01,550
 Don't drain yourself at the beginning. 

790
01:01:01,550 --> 01:01:03,130
 There's no time to relax. 

791

 I have to win, no matter what. 

792
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:09,440
 You're involved with Ji Won a lot these days. 

793
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:12,290
 What were those comments talking about earlier? 

794
01:01:12,290 --> 01:01:14,380
 What do you care? 

795
01:01:14,380 --> 01:01:16,480
 What's this? 

796
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:20,320
 I hear the head judge for the carpentry competition this year is your university sunbae. 

797
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:23,840
 I think you're the one in trouble. 

798
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:26,170
 Why is he still not picking up?
