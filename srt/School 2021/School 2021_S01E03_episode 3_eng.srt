1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,640
   

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,960
   

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,000
   

4
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:14,820
   

5
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,910
   

6
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:21,220
   

7
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:33,630
   

8
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:45,090
 Timing and Subtitles by the ðŸŽ¶ Sing for a dream ðŸŽ¤ Team @ viki 

9
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:09,250
   

10
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:33,460
I'm flattered that you would congratulate me so much.

11
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,100
What is it?

12
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,220
What's going on?

13
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:53,140
What is it?

14
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,070
Isn't that the director's car?

15
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:58,940
What do we do?

16
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:03,540
It's just a flowerpot. That scared me.

17
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,780
Wow, that thing shattered.

18
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:08,460
Hey, isn't that Director Gu's car?

19
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,820
I think someone threw it.

20
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,900
That's crazy. Who would throw it?

21
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,200
It's Min Seo.

22
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,830
   

23
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,150
   

24
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,780
   

25
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:31,170
- That's crazy. 
 - Who would do that?

26
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:32,660
Oh, no.

27
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:34,140
Who is it?

28
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,800
Someone threw it.

29
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,650
Who would do that?

30
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,890
S***.

31
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:56,940
Hey.

32
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:02,660
You should date me.

33
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:32,360
Isn't she picking up?

34
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:43,870
Was that note really written by Min Seo?

35
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:46,100
But she wasn't on the list.

36
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,200
She was from another school.

37
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:51,870
Gosh. Why didn't I think of Min Seo?

38
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:53,330
 What is it? 

39
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:55,090
 Did something happen? 

40
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:56,880
 It's nothing. 

41
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,460
 You look tired. 

42
00:04:58,460 --> 00:04:59,710
 Yes. 

43
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:02,560
Something was off with her that day.

44
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:06,790
It'll be fine.

45
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:08,920
We aren't even sure yet.

46
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,870
Oh, hello. I'm looking for apprentice Jung Min Seoâ€”

47
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,160
She didn't show up for work.

48
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,830
She would never do that.

49
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:25,360
This won't do.

50
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,470
What are you going to do?

51
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:28,230
I have to find her.

52
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:35,560
Hey! Wait for me!

53
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,470
Gong Ki Joon!

54
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:47,290
It's Director Gu's.

55
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:49,640
Someone threw it.

56
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,410
Who saw this fall?

57
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:53,170
We heard it and came out. We didn't see...

58
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:55,850
- Didn't you see anything? 
 - No, we didn't.

59
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:58,600
Wow, what is this?

60
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:02,210
All sorts of things are happening, seriously!

61
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:15,760
I need to see the one who did this.

62
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:21,260
Teachers, find out who did this and bring the person to me.

63
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,820
How about we finish our meeting?

64
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:28,070
Of course. Let's go inside.

65
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:32,950
What are you all doing?

66
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:37,070
Go to the classrooms or the rooftop. Find the culprit!

67
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,570
Hey, all of you, go inside.

68
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,680
Come on, go inside.

69
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,920
Let's go inside.

70
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,680
That's crazy.

71
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:54,050
Geez. How could something like this happen?

72
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:55,910
Guys, go inside, hurry.

73
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:57,190
Go inside.

74
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:58,430
Guys, hurry inside.

75
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:00,860
Come on, hurry.

76
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,320
Go inside.

77
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,520
Aigoo.

78
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,140
All right, quiet.

79
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:27,800
Seriously, guys, it can't be our class, right?

80
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,040
Listen up.

81
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:33,670
A flowerpot fell from the rooftop earlier.

82
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:36,090
It was heavy.

83
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:40,060
Did it fall?

84
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,550
Someone must have thrown it.

85
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:43,780
- How can something that big just fall? 
 - Sit down, everyone.

86
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:45,160
Why?

87
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,420
Whose seats are those empty ones?

88
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:55,970
Ho Sung, Ki Joon, and Ji Won.

89
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:57,500
Where did they go?

90
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:00,830
Well... they were just here.

91
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:02,710
Where did they go?

92
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:06,290
Did anyone go to the rooftop earlier?

93
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:08,860
Ms. Song, was that Director Gu's car?

94
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:11,680
Did someone really throw the flowerpot?

95
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,200
We don't know yet.

96
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:16,830
If anyone in our class made a mistake, come to me.

97
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,980
The faster you apologize, the faster we can wrap up the incident.

98
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:21,040
All right?

99
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,060
Okay.

100
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:30,200
Where is it?

101
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:38,360
Min Seo!

102
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,340
Jung Min Seo!

103
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:44,520
Grandma! Is anyone in there?

104
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,800
She's not here.

105
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,990
Is there anywhere else Min Seo might be?

106
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,770
I think I know where she is.

107
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:08,950
Where?

108
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:11,470
Min Seo might come home so keep watch here.

109
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:14,130
- H-Hey... 
 - H-Hey, Ji Won!

110
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:17,160
Where are you going?

111
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:26,230
Hey, hey, hey! How long should I stay here?

112
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:30,670
- Hello. 
 - Hi.

113
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:33,490
- Mr. Lee. 
 - Let's talk tomorrow.

114
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,990
A resort would have many work opportunities.

115
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:44,850
- Yes. 
 - That's true.

116
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:10,500
As Director Kim mentioned, we opened Sang Rim Resort now

117
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:14,250
so our students won't have time to worry about getting a job.

118
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,800
Teaching Director?

119
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,020
Yes?

120
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:30,730
This is Mr. Lee Kang Hoon, a new teacher in our Architectural Design department.

121
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:33,030
He came from supervising construction.

122
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:35,400
so he has much on-site experience.

123
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,960
He also has good carpentry skills.

124
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:52,110
Our students don't know much about the world.

125
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:57,340
It would be great if you could teach them realistically.

126
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,830
Of course.

127
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:11,490
That Mr. Kim from before had no common sense and almost ruined the children.

128
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:13,280
Mr...

129
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,640
Lee!

130
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,790
He's Lee Kang Hoon.

131
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:20,360
Mr. Lee, I hope you guide them well.

132
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,960
The students have to come to their senses.

133
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,790
I understand.

134
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,300
- What a handsome man. 
 - You'll do well.

135
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,430
Thank you.

136
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:41,920
- I think we have a good teacher. 
 - I think he will do well.

137
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,830
We haven't gathered for a while. Should we go and have the blowfish soup you like?

138
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:30,490
That sounds good.

139
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:33,160
Hello.

140
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,530
Mr. Lee!

141
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:44,260
I waited in case you left work right on time again.

142
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:51,390
Oh, okay.

143
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:53,760
This is what I mentioned before.

144
00:12:55,300 --> 00:13:00,290
If you form a club soon, I will work really hard and definitely win an award.

145
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,210
Oh, this?

146
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:08,230
But if you're the only one, I'm not sure I can form a club.

147
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:12,400
Who are you, again?

148
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,980
Hello, I'm Kang Seo Young from the Architectural Design department.

149
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:19,930
Oh, yes. Seo Young.

150
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:23,190
You're top of the class in 11th grade, yes?

151
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,400
Oh, it's just that she's the only one interested.

152
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:44,850
Oh, yes.

153
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:46,800
A club?

154
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,080
You need at least five people to form a club.

155
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,730
Oh, I see.

156
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:55,670
Jae Hee and Jae Hyuk would make three.

157
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:58,100
You need to get two more.

158
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:01,900
Great. Then I will look forward to it.

159
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:06,770
You really are on top of preparing your requirements.

160
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:11,450
This event is very good for college-bound students.

161
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:13,460
Guide them well.

162
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,260
I called a taxi.

163
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:35,790
About the car, we will call the car-repair service

164
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:38,270
- and have it fixedâ€” 
 - Leave it.

165
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:41,450
The culprit needs to remember it.

166
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:45,060
Leave it until that person admits to it.

167
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:48,910
Certainly.

168
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:26,880
I don't want to do it.

169
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:33,610
Hey, are you playing with me? Why are you flipping back and forthâ€”

170
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:37,250
Hey, shouldn't we do it then?

171
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:41,140
I mean, I don't want to do it with them.

172
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,710
You shouldn't be so picky about people.

173
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,500
You have to get along with friends.

174
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,350
They're not my friends...

175
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:51,050
and this is a tilted field.

176
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:53,360
I was wondering what you meant...

177
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,280
Everything is a little tilted.

178
00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:00,220
Look, even the earth is slightly tilted.

179
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,760
Do you really think that?

180
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:06,410
I just mean you have to work a little harder.

181
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:09,480
I'm already doing my best.

182
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,910
More than you are, at least.

183
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,730
Oh, sorry, sorry.

184
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:21,040
I know I'm really late.

185
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,040
Are you sulking? What are we having, again?

186
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,440
Pardon? Yes, yes.

187
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,940
 Keep that up and I'll sulk, too. 

188
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:27,460
 Of course not. 

189
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:30,530
 I'm the bad one. I'll be right there. 

190
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:34,970
Sorry, I'll be right there. Just wait a little bit.

191
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:37,110
Oh, right, right.

192
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:39,580
Here.

193
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:40,850
What is this?

194
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:44,430
Your students asked me to deliver it. I'm a bit late due to the board meeting.

195
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:48,660
But the content of it seems serious.

196
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:49,680
Really?

197
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,200
But they didn't know who wrote it, either.

198
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:55,020
Anyway, I'm going now.

199
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,710
Who in my class gave you this?

200
00:16:57,710 --> 00:16:59,710
Oh, that... Wh-Who was it?

201
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:02,330
Oh! Jin Ji Won!

202
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:11,500
Yes, Ms. Song.

203
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,930
I think Min Seo wrote it.

204
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:18,210
Yes. We will call right away when we find her.

205
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:19,680
Okay.

206
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:34,360
 Hey, Jung Min Seo! 

207
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:42,400
 Wait for me. 

208
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:45,500
 Gosh, you're so out of shape. 

209
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,890
 Aigoo... 

210
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:48,650
 Aigoo, aigoo... 

211
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,670
 Hey... 

212
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:54,660
 Yesterday, tomorrow, the day after... It will all be the same. 

213
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:57,510
 - Do we have to? 
 - No, it's different every day. Come on. 

214
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:59,980
 - Geez. 
 - Aigoo... 

215
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,770
 It's awesome, right? 

216
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:16,900
 Yes, it is. 

217
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:23,200
 It's amazing! 

218
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,580
Jung Min Seo!

219
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,880
Where are you?

220
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,690
- What is it? 
 - I'll get all of it for you.

221
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:20,020
Wow, they have this too.

222
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:21,930
What is this?

223
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:27,960
- It's right there. 
 - So cute.

224
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,270
Oh, my God.

225
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:31,650
- Here, it's right there. 
 - Over there.

226
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:54,970
 What is it? Give it here. I'll get it to her. 

227
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:57,820
 What is this? 

228
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:59,340
 I think it's a suicide note. 

229
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:01,120
 "A suicide note"? 

230
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,530
 A suicide... 

231
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:07,690
 Was that note really written by Min Seo? 

232
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:28,850
The police haven't called, right?

233
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:37,440
What do we do now?

234
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:41,200
Let's go to the workplace again.

235
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,110
I think something must have happened at work.

236
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:46,190
The manager will still be there.

237
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:52,920
   

238
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,650
   

239
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,140
Hello?

240
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:02,730
Hi. I'm, well... the new guy...

241
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:05,190
I know, Jung Young Joo. What about Min Seo?

242
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:06,600
Are you guys looking for her?

243
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,200
Yes. Do you know where she is?

244
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,840
I think I saw her.

245
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:13,060
About an hour ago, near the sea observatory.

246
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:14,310
 Really? 

247
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:18,190
It was weird. She was walking alone toward the observatory.

248
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:19,980
Young Joo, where are you?

249
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:22,380
Can you go and keep her there?

250
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:12,940
 Don't touch it! 

251
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:15,550
 What am I going to do? S***! 

252
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:17,570
 - I'm sorry. 
 - Sorry? 

253
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:19,490
 Do you have any idea how expensive this is? 

254
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:20,840
 How much is it? 

255
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:24,910
 This orchid is worth over 30 million won (~US$25,000). Do you have any idea? 

256
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:27,000
 What? Is it that expensive? 

257
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,510
 What are you going to do? Look! 

258
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:30,250
 What are you going to do? 

259
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:34,120
 I'm really sorry... It was... It was a mistake. 

260
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:38,260
 Wow, this girl would kill a person and call it a mistake. 

261
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:40,570
 You... Call home right now. 

262
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:45,050
 You have to sell your house or your car, or whatever it takes to pay for this. 

263
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:47,470
 But I... 

264
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:50,730
 I don't have that kind of money. 

265
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:53,570
 You don't? No money? 

266
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:55,630
 You caused it and want to get away with it? 

267
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:57,980
 Stay right there, you. 

268
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:01,520
 Hey, Hyungnim, it's me. 

269
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,140
 You know the orchid that I got at the auction last time, right? 

270
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:05,380
 Geez... 

271
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:08,440
 Some jerk broke it and is trying to get out of it. 

272
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,450
 I can press criminal charges, right? 

273
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:12,290
 Yes. Oh, really? 

274
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:13,760
 Damage to private property? 

275
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,970
 Three years in prison? 

276
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:18,570
 You're dead. 

277
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:27,040
   

278
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,330
   

279
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:41,280
   

280
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:49,220
 Grandma. 

281
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:12,260
   

282
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:18,870
   
   
   

283
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:40,280
   

284
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,810
   

285
00:24:49,810 --> 00:24:54,050
   

286
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:16,800
Yes, Ms. Song.

287
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,150
 Ji Won, did you find Min Seo? 

288
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:21,840
 I'm on my way to the police station. 

289
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,960
We're going to the observatory at the beach right now.

290
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,980
Observatory? Why?

291
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:30,690
Young Joo said he saw Min Seo over there a while ago.

292
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:34,070
Young Joo? The new transfer student in our class?

293
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:35,510
Yes.

294
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:40,510
 Okay, got it. I'll head there now. 

295
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:51,850
Hey!

296
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:02,900
Who are you?

297
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:06,280
Are you here to arrest me?

298
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:10,060
No. I'm...

299
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,480
the new transfer student in your class.

300
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,040
Sorry?

301
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:21,650
I remember now.

302
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:24,520
I saw you back then at the diner.

303
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,810
The scary new kid.

304
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:32,360
Do you want to die?

305
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:37,620
I was going to...

306
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,320
but I can't jump because I'm scared.

307
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,250
Don't die.

308
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,670
Hey.

309
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:50,570
Do you have 30 million won by any chance?

310
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:55,370
No.

311
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:59,810
Still, don't die.

312
00:26:59,810 --> 00:27:01,170
Why not?

313
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,930
A lot of people are worried about you.

314
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,980
Min Seo!

315
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:44,890
Thank you.

316
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:41,130
You two went through a great deal.

317
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,880
I'm sorry.

318
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,650
What are you sorry about?

319
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:51,790
I'm the one who is sorry.

320
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:55,060
All of you shouldn't worry too much.

321
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:57,200
I'll take Min Seo home.

322
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,000
You should both go home. It's late.

323
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,980
Okay. We will.

324
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:03,580
Goodbye.

325
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:04,970
Let's go.

326
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:07,500
Go.

327
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:32,980
Let's go.

328
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:35,150
Okay.

329
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,070
 Are you okay? 

330
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,340
 Min Seo... 

331
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:39,120
Is your wound from earlier okay?

332
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:41,920
I don't know.

333
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:45,430
I thought I knew her well.

334
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:50,010
How tough was it for her that she thought of doing something like that?

335
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:55,780
Not even friends know everything about each other.

336
00:30:58,110 --> 00:31:01,340
Without Young Joo, things could have been much worse.

337
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:03,810
I'm really glad.

338
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,890
True.

339
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:12,450
What is it between you and Jung Young Joo?

340
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:16,700
He comes at you like he's going to eat you up so why are you sympathetic toward him?

341
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:20,900
Am I?

342
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:27,740
So...

343
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:31,200
Are you close with Young Joo now?

344
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,600
Do you guys have each other's numbers?

345
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:38,230
Why? Are you jealous?

346
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:52,190
Thank you for today.

347
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,210
Do you understand what I'm saying?

348
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:26,870
It's definitely resolvable.

349
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:32,120
I will meet with the manager and settle it with the company.

350
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:35,590
So don't be scared. It's not that serious.

351
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:40,010
I'm sorry.

352
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:41,750
Don't worry about it.

353
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:44,860
For now, don't think about anything and get a good sleep.

354
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:46,330
Okay.

355
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,910
Hey, where are you?

356
00:33:03,910 --> 00:33:06,000
 I found Min Seo! 

357
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:11,900
Oh, right. You were still there.

358
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:17,430
Right. You found her...

359
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:21,770
I saw her, and I think Min Seo's okay. She's coming here with our homeroom teacher.

360
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:23,690
Is that you, Ho Sung?

361
00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:29,550
What are you doing here, Ho Sung?

362
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:37,490
Hi, Ms. Song.

363
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:39,140
Hi, Min Seo.

364
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:42,160
Oh, hey... Hi.

365
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:47,140
I know, right? I'm not sure what I was doing here.

366
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,840
I forgot. Sorry.

367
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,410
 Forgot? 

368
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:59,000
How could you forget? How?

369
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,850
I couldn't even go to the bathroom because of you. Okay!

370
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:04,000
I already peed my pants, jerk!

371
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,300
 Where are you? Where? Where? Geez. 

372
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:09,720
Hey, sorry.

373
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:13,580
He should have gone to the bathroom, though.

374
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,750
 Who is it? 

375
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:22,710
It's me.

376
00:34:36,910 --> 00:34:39,750
Ta-da.

377
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:44,030
Jung Young Joo, aren't you eating? It'll get cold.

378
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:47,510
Gosh, I told you to go ahead.

379
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:48,910
It's better if we eat together.

380
00:34:48,910 --> 00:34:50,470
Of course.

381
00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:52,310
Hurry and eat. You'll be late for school.

382
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:53,990
 Next on the news. 

383
00:34:53,990 --> 00:34:57,520
 At the award ceremony hosted by the Ministry of Education 

384
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:00,370
 for 2021 employment evaluation of specialist high schools, 

385
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:03,970
 Director Gu Mi Hee of Nulji Science and Technology High School in Haerang city 

386
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:06,070
 was commended by the Minister of Education. 

387
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:09,110
 Through devoted efforts... 

388
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:14,470
 They considered each specialist high school's employment programs, employment rate, 

389
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:17,690
 and alumni satisfaction rate from all over the country... 

390
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:19,240
Don't mind it.

391
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:21,350
 ...and was awarded the Minister of Education award. 

392
00:35:21,350 --> 00:35:24,960
 Nulji Science and Technology High School, which showed exceptional results, 

393
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,810
 was established in 1991 to focus on cultivating carpentry talent... 

394
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:31,140
Did you meet her at school?

395
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:33,540
 ...they raise exceptional technicians to lead the future... 

396
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:36,740
Don't get distracted. Just do well in school.

397
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:40,120
Learn what you need to learn and get along with other friends.

398
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:42,360
 ...Director Gu Mi Hee of Nulji High... 

399
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:45,280
- I'll do well on my own. 
 - Listen to your hyung.

400
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:50,400
She won't have anything to say after we win the case at the trial.

401
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:54,410
Young Joo, don't pay attention to that and focus on school, okay?

402
00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:58,660
 ...Director Gu Mi Hee stated that specialist high schools play an important role 

403
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:04,730
 in anticipating changes in a fast-paced society and guiding a future-focused education... 

404
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:07,770
 Cheol Joo... 

405
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:18,760
 Cheol Joo... 

406
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,990
 You'll get better in no time. 

407
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:26,900
 I'll keep praying every day. Have strength. Okay? 

408
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:28,360
 Thank you. 

409
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:31,230
 Thank you so much, ma'am. 

410
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:40,420
 ...The Ministry of Education plans to continue to support the specialist high schoolsâ€” 

411
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,990
Young Joo.

412
00:36:58,350 --> 00:37:00,370
It looks terrible. Why don't they clean it up?

413
00:37:00,370 --> 00:37:02,400
This isn't the first time Director Gu's being weird.

414
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,960
- Gosh... 
 - True. Come on.

415
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,120
Hello.

416
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:08,590
Good morning.

417
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:10,820
Hi.

418
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,680
- Hello. 
 - Hi.

419
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:28,960
I wonder who created this piece of art here.

420
00:37:31,370 --> 00:37:35,260
How gutsy. How could they do this to Director Gu's car?

421
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:38,260
You're right.

422
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:40,270
Why did you do it?

423
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:52,150
Are you surprised?

424
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:57,710
I... saw something that day.

425
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:15,330
So?

426
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:35,260
Did you get home okay last night?

427
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:38,020
I did. How about you?

428
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:40,950
I did, too.

429
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:46,710
What about Min Seo? Is she okay?

430
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:51,360
It seems so. I think she'll come back to school after a few days.

431
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:58,910
- You hurt yourself yesterdayâ€” 
 - Jung Young Joo.

432
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:02,570
Thank you so much for yesterday.

433
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,520
There's nothing to thank me for.

434
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:09,400
I'll buy you dinner sometime.

435
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:13,410
Okay. If you want to.

436
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:16,310
Oh, and...

437
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:20,130
Let me know if there's anything I can help you with.

438
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:21,920
Okay?

439
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:25,300
Yes.

440
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,740
Okay.

441
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:37,350
Then that's it for our morning meeting.

442
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:39,850
You must have all heard.

443
00:39:39,850 --> 00:39:43,450
There was almost an unfortunate incident last night.

444
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:47,710
Make sure you keep it quiet so no one gets riled up about it.

445
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:51,320
Oh, and is she here today?

446
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:54,780
I told her to take a few days off until she has calmed down.

447
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:57,540
Aigoo. Children these days are so weak.

448
00:39:57,540 --> 00:40:00,950
Making a fuss about killing themselves over nothing.

449
00:40:00,950 --> 00:40:03,500
It's because they're children.

450
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:07,720
They look like they're all grown up, but they're still children who need protecting.

451
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:10,510
Even if it doesn't seem like a big deal to adults,

452
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:14,490
to these young ones, especially those who have no one to rely on,

453
00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:17,080
it feels like there's no escape for them.

454
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:19,970
She's right.

455
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:21,700
- Director. 
 - Hello.

456
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:23,460
P-Please sit...

457
00:40:29,650 --> 00:40:32,510
I also heard the news.

458
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,640
You have no idea...

459
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:38,210
how shocked and heartbroken I was.

460
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:42,800
Make sure that the student is connected to a therapy center,

461
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:48,220
and please do your best to console the child, Homeroom Teacher.

462
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:52,640
Let's conclude this incident that way.

463
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,150
Yes, of course.

464
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:59,330
But it seems that the on-site company manager for OJT (on the job training)

465
00:40:59,330 --> 00:41:02,630
reprimanded the student too harshly for her mistake,

466
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:06,530
and even threatened her by exaggerating the price.

467
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:10,810
I will make sure to look into that.

468
00:41:10,810 --> 00:41:14,220
Oh, that... wasn't a threat.

469
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:16,880
The student broke an expensive orchid.

470
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,730
Ms. Song Chae Rin, yes?

471
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:21,360
Yes.

472
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:34,630
Please do that.

473
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:36,850
Take responsibility and dig deep.

474
00:41:36,850 --> 00:41:39,240
Make sure you deal with it reasonably so that

475
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:42,200
neither the company nor the student is affected.

476
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:47,530
What a relief.

477
00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:53,450
It seems that there are many reasonable people like Ms. Song Chae Rin at Nulji High.

478
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:56,150
Also, while we are at it,

479
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:59,580
I'll deal with the recent flowerpot terror incident.

480
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:03,500
I will deal with it reasonably.

481
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:09,000
I don't like dragging things out.

482
00:42:09,850 --> 00:42:14,390
So then should we move the car first?

483
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:17,510
If no one steps forward to confess by tomorrow,

484
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:22,310
I will press criminal charges.

485
00:42:22,310 --> 00:42:25,140
It is part of a school's job to teach

486
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:28,270
its students right from wrong.

487
00:42:28,270 --> 00:42:32,880
That is the best for that child's future too.

488
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:46,400
 But it seems that the on-site company manager even threatened her by exaggerating the price. 

489
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,230
 I will make sure to look into that. 

490
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:56,580
She's very good with her words.

491
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:01,580
How despicable.

492
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:04,980
   

493
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:10,710
   

494
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:15,170
 It's me. 

495
00:43:15,170 --> 00:43:18,020
The homeroom teacher of that girl who messed up called.

496
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:19,870
Geez, I'm speechless.

497
00:43:19,870 --> 00:43:22,500
I told you to stay quiet.

498
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:25,500
Noona, it really wasn't my fault this time.

499
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:27,480
Do you know how expensive that orchid was?

500
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:30,550
 I can't let this go. I'll go to school rightâ€” 
 - Quiet. 

501
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:33,020
Don't you understand me when I say live quietly?

502
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:35,740
 If you don't want to lose the manager role you barely hold, 

503
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:39,490
stop embarrassing the family and shut up! Got it?

504
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:53,250
Yes, come in.

505
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:57,220
Ms. Song Chae Rin.

506
00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:07,440
Was that really a suicide note yesterday?

507
00:44:09,610 --> 00:44:11,520
Who? Why?

508
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:15,270
Jung Min Seo from my class.

509
00:44:15,270 --> 00:44:17,460
It's too complicated.

510
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:19,870
Nothing serious happened, right?

511
00:44:19,870 --> 00:44:22,130
In the end, no.

512
00:44:22,130 --> 00:44:24,340
It's a relief.

513
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:28,010
It would have been better if someone passed it on sooner.

514
00:44:28,010 --> 00:44:29,350
I...

515
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:32,530
So about the flowerpot...

516
00:44:32,530 --> 00:44:34,090
Will she really press charges?

517
00:44:34,090 --> 00:44:35,440
Is it juvenile detention if caught?

518
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:38,090
Would they be expelled from school for sure?

519
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,950
Director Gu is only trying to scare the student, right?

520
00:44:43,950 --> 00:44:46,240
Probably not.

521
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:48,850
What a scary person. I'll have to watch myself.

522
00:44:48,850 --> 00:44:52,640
You shouldn't say anything unnecessary and look good for Director Gu.

523
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,730
Say what unnecessarily?

524
00:44:54,730 --> 00:44:58,070
I told you to act like you don't necessarily know me, didn't I?

525
00:45:03,430 --> 00:45:04,680
Waitâ€”

526
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:06,430
Is it really...

527
00:45:06,430 --> 00:45:08,190
possible to press criminal charges?

528
00:45:08,190 --> 00:45:11,330
Yes, but it shouldn't happen.

529
00:45:11,330 --> 00:45:14,980
So if anyone has anything to apologize for, let's hurry.

530
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:17,920
She said she'd wait until tomorrow.

531
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:23,900
   

532
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:52,220
What do you want me to do?

533
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:55,360
Aren't you scared?

534
00:45:58,100 --> 00:46:02,100
If I report you, you'll be expelled for sure

535
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:04,000
and could go to juvie (juvenile detention).

536
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,970
If you go to juvie, your parents will take it hard.

537
00:46:09,190 --> 00:46:11,360
Let's make a deal.

538
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:12,910
The conditions are simple.

539
00:46:12,910 --> 00:46:16,300
Like I said before, just date me.

540
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:20,460
Do you like me?

541
00:46:23,210 --> 00:46:26,390
There are a few annoying guys who keep hanging around me.

542
00:46:26,390 --> 00:46:28,390
I want to get rid of them.

543
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,720
I don't want to.

544
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:34,760
Just walk with me to and from school a few times

545
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:37,920
and let them see us eating lunch together.

546
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:41,460
I don't think it's that hard.

547
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:48,690
Oh, and I'm going to form a carpentry club.

548
00:46:48,690 --> 00:46:50,870
Join that too.

549
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:53,570
I will go to juvie.

550
00:46:54,510 --> 00:46:57,500
Fine. It's just a boyfriend.

551
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:04,720
It's a done deal.

552
00:47:12,050 --> 00:47:15,170
I just want to feel like we made a promise.

553
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:19,950
What, do you prefer this?

554
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:24,720
Okay.

555
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:26,880
Let's take a picture.

556
00:47:29,230 --> 00:47:31,040
Geez...

557
00:47:39,350 --> 00:47:41,110
Jung Min Seo!

558
00:47:41,110 --> 00:47:43,650
Hold on.

559
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:54,110
Ta-da.

560
00:47:54,110 --> 00:47:56,830
It's on me, the convenience-store unni.

561
00:47:56,830 --> 00:47:58,740
Thanks.

562
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:15,380
Sorry.

563
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:18,710
I brought you and Ki Joon into this.

564
00:48:18,710 --> 00:48:21,110
Oh, and Ho Sung, too.

565
00:48:21,110 --> 00:48:24,410
Don't ever do that again.

566
00:48:24,410 --> 00:48:27,170
Or else, I will live with you at your place,

567
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:29,880
and follow you wherever you go, forever.

568
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:31,900
Hey, that's scarier than dying.

569
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:34,990
Hey. Don't say that.

570
00:48:37,580 --> 00:48:39,930
I won't do it again.

571
00:48:39,930 --> 00:48:44,460
I realized I have a severe fear of heights.

572
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:46,190
And...

573
00:48:46,190 --> 00:48:49,020
he told me not to die.

574
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:50,840
Who?

575
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:52,500
The new guy.

576
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:54,940
He seems like a good guy.

577
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:56,910
What's this, Jung Min Seo?

578
00:48:56,910 --> 00:48:59,570
You liked Ki Joon, and now you suddenly switch to Young Joo?

579
00:48:59,570 --> 00:49:01,330
It happens. So what?

580
00:49:01,330 --> 00:49:05,170
Jin Ji Won is by Gong Ki Joon's side anyway.

581
00:49:05,170 --> 00:49:07,220
What are you talking about?

582
00:49:32,530 --> 00:49:35,110
   

583
00:49:55,810 --> 00:49:58,190
Are you running away?

584
00:49:58,190 --> 00:49:59,730
Yes.

585
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:02,970
Really?

586
00:50:05,030 --> 00:50:06,790
I'll see.

587
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:36,310
 The conditions are simple. 

588
00:50:36,310 --> 00:50:39,450
 Like I said before, just date me. 

589
00:50:39,450 --> 00:50:41,740
 Oh, and I'm going to form a carpentry club. 

590
00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:43,390
 Join that too. 

591
00:50:43,390 --> 00:50:45,430
 I will go to juvie. 

592
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:48,880
 Fine. It's just a boyfriend. 

593
00:50:52,140 --> 00:50:54,100
 Okay. 

594
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:00,820
- Isn't that a panda? 
 - It's a panda!

595
00:51:00,820 --> 00:51:02,900
So cute!

596
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:37,640
So good!

597
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:39,510
So cute!

598
00:51:41,810 --> 00:51:43,970
More!

599
00:51:55,270 --> 00:51:57,450
I can't do this anymore.

600
00:51:58,570 --> 00:52:00,000
 So good! 

601
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,890
 So cute, I want to bite it! 

602
00:52:02,890 --> 00:52:05,170
Gosh, so annoying!

603
00:52:09,790 --> 00:52:11,750
What are you doing here?

604
00:52:13,610 --> 00:52:16,450
Why are you following me?

605
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:20,280
Are you working?

606
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:25,400
You used to ignore me. Now you pretend to be interested?

607
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:27,470
I never ignored you.

608
00:52:27,470 --> 00:52:30,030
You said you were busy hanging out with the trainees.

609
00:52:30,030 --> 00:52:31,970
I see...

610
00:52:31,970 --> 00:52:33,510
You're still the same.

611
00:52:33,510 --> 00:52:35,570
You only remember how you want to remember.

612
00:52:35,570 --> 00:52:37,330
Did you quit being a trainee?

613
00:52:37,330 --> 00:52:38,990
Quitâ€”

614
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:41,830
Wh-Who said I quit?

615
00:52:41,830 --> 00:52:44,920
My friend kept begging me so I'm just filling in for the day.

616
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:48,440
Stop using up my break-time and go away.

617
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:51,610
If you're not going to the practice room, at least come to school.

618
00:52:51,610 --> 00:52:53,120
That little...

619
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:56,730
Hey, don't go spreading nonsense everywhere!

620
00:53:05,770 --> 00:53:08,700
   

621
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:15,970
 - Hello. 
 - Hey. 

622
00:53:18,340 --> 00:53:20,790
 Eun Bi. Good work. 

623
00:53:20,790 --> 00:53:24,880
 Well, you worked hard so far, but... 

624
00:53:28,230 --> 00:53:30,420
 Don't be too down. 

625
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:34,230
 We can meet again for better performances. 

626
00:53:34,230 --> 00:53:35,950
 Yes. 

627
00:53:36,940 --> 00:53:38,560
 Thank you for everything. 

628
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:40,310
 All right. 

629
00:53:40,310 --> 00:53:43,220
 Your entrance key. I'll return it for you. 

630
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:51,920
   

631
00:53:57,130 --> 00:53:59,200
 Okay. Good work. 

632
00:54:15,530 --> 00:54:16,980
Yes...

633
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:19,830
So you'll continue with the apprenticeship class

634
00:54:19,830 --> 00:54:22,370
and move to a different company?

635
00:54:22,370 --> 00:54:23,240
Yes.

636
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:26,260
Ms. Song told me to wait and that she'll look into it.

637
00:54:26,260 --> 00:54:27,460
Will you be okay?

638
00:54:27,460 --> 00:54:30,910
Of course, I'll be okay. Don't you believe me?

639
00:54:32,140 --> 00:54:34,270
So proud. So proud.

640
00:54:34,270 --> 00:54:36,350
I'm so proud of you!

641
00:54:36,350 --> 00:54:39,520
- Jin Ji Won! 
 - Hi!

642
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:40,870
What are you doing here, Jung Min Seo?

643
00:54:40,870 --> 00:54:42,480
Aren't you going to work today?

644
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:45,660
Pardon? Oh, I quit.

645
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:49,420
Hey. You're becoming like Jin Ji Won, aren't you?

646
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:53,330
Can you talk behind my back somewhere else?

647
00:54:53,330 --> 00:54:55,650
Hey, that's not the problem. There's big news.

648
00:54:55,650 --> 00:54:57,600
Look at this. Come here.

649
00:54:57,600 --> 00:54:59,610
Wow, did you see this?

650
00:54:59,610 --> 00:55:01,800
- Wow. 
 - That's crazy.

651
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:03,480
- Oh my! 
 - Wow!

652
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:04,630
- What is this? 
 - What are they?

653
00:55:04,630 --> 00:55:07,560
Look at this. They're no joke.

654
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,920
- I saw it as soon as I opened my eyes. 
 - Saw what?

655
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:23,120
How can you see it as soon as you open your eyes?

656
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:24,120
Let's make a bet.

657
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:26,360
- Are they dating or not? 
 - I bet they're not. You?

658
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:28,010
I bet they are.

659
00:55:28,010 --> 00:55:30,350
No way.

660
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:39,100
Is it Seo Young?

661
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:41,510
- Seoâ€” 
 - Or Ji Won?

662
00:55:41,510 --> 00:55:43,980
I don't know where you stand.

663
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:46,080
What are you talking about first thing this morning?

664
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:48,900
If it's the former, you'll be affected.

665
00:55:58,780 --> 00:56:00,570
What's this?

666
00:56:00,570 --> 00:56:03,510
Why are... these two, so...

667
00:56:03,510 --> 00:56:05,230
f-friendly?

668
00:56:05,230 --> 00:56:07,320
So it's the former?

669
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:13,040
But when I saw them...

670
00:56:26,820 --> 00:56:29,150
They look good together.

671
00:56:32,090 --> 00:56:33,090
What...

672
00:56:33,090 --> 00:56:35,670
- What is she doing? 
 - What's that?

673
00:56:36,470 --> 00:56:38,900
Can you look here for a second?

674
00:56:39,710 --> 00:56:43,480
It's a carpentry competition hosted by Jin Sung University's architecture department.

675
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:45,910
Does anyone want to do this with me?

676
00:56:45,910 --> 00:56:46,890
"Carpentry competition"?

677
00:56:46,890 --> 00:56:50,300
Hey, do it with your boyfriend.

678
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:54,900
- Looking good together. 
 - Yes, they can do it together.

679
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:03,300
- The prize money is 10 million won (~US$8,500). 
 - Ten million won?

680
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:05,200
Me, I will do it.

681
00:57:05,890 --> 00:57:08,650
Isn't the club only good for you and the twins?

682
00:57:08,650 --> 00:57:10,800
Everyone else is...

683
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:13,760
just there for show.

684
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:15,630
Yes, Ji Won, just don't do it.

685
00:57:15,630 --> 00:57:17,380
They'll take center stage for sure.

686
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:19,240
Do you think?

687
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:23,370
But still.

688
00:57:23,370 --> 00:57:25,230
I'll do it too.

689
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:32,130
What?

690
00:57:32,130 --> 00:57:34,640
- What's this? 
 - What's with you two?

691
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:36,510
So many couples in our class...

692
00:57:36,510 --> 00:57:38,110
So it was the latter.

693
00:57:38,110 --> 00:57:40,810
What's up with them?

694
00:57:40,810 --> 00:57:42,010
Ten million won...

695
00:57:42,010 --> 00:57:44,660
No, I think it's because of Ji Won.

696
00:57:44,660 --> 00:57:46,940
What's with them?

697
00:57:50,510 --> 00:57:54,420
Will she really call the police to the school or what?

698
00:57:55,510 --> 00:57:58,060
Geez, it's driving me crazy.

699
00:58:05,270 --> 00:58:06,890
What's that?

700
00:58:41,410 --> 00:58:42,840
What?

701
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:44,560
Get lost.

702
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:46,790
Did you rent this place?

703
00:58:49,050 --> 00:58:51,500
Where are you running off to now?

704
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:54,010
This is the quietest place.

705
00:58:54,010 --> 00:58:57,160
Everyone else is talking about you.

706
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:06,180
But is it true?

707
00:59:06,180 --> 00:59:08,710
I can't believe it.

708
00:59:08,710 --> 00:59:11,000
Don't say, "Mind your own business."

709
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,540
Don't say, "Leave me alone," either.

710
00:59:12,540 --> 00:59:14,830
You already said, "Get lost."

711
00:59:14,830 --> 00:59:16,880
So don't say that, either.

712
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:18,860
Don't you have anything new to say?

713
00:59:18,860 --> 00:59:20,370
Shut up.

714
00:59:20,370 --> 00:59:23,020
Seeing you makes me feel like s***.

715
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:26,730
Hey, hey, hey!

716
00:59:26,730 --> 00:59:29,160
You already said that last time too.

717
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:30,920
Okay?

718
00:59:32,270 --> 00:59:35,510
You said that... last time...

719
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:48,680
Yes.

720
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:50,680
 Where are you? 

721
00:59:51,910 --> 00:59:54,620
Jung Young Joo just told me off and I'm crushed.

722
00:59:54,620 --> 00:59:56,280
Why?

723
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:57,620
Did you guys fight again?

724
00:59:57,620 --> 00:59:58,580
 No. 

725
00:59:58,580 --> 00:59:59,960
We didn't fight.

726
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:01,720
I tried a different method.

727
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:03,460
 What does that mean? 

728
01:00:03,460 --> 01:00:06,520
Ms. Song told you to come to the counseling room. Right now.

729
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:08,130
- Me? 
 - Yes. 

730
01:00:08,130 --> 01:00:10,550
Ho Sung and me too.

731
01:00:16,290 --> 01:00:18,570
Did you guys do something wrong?

732
01:00:18,570 --> 01:00:20,970
- No.
- Not me.

733
01:00:26,250 --> 01:00:28,800
- Hello. 
 - Sit, sit.

734
01:00:35,010 --> 01:00:40,320
You three weren't in your seats when the flowerpot fell, right?

735
01:00:43,770 --> 01:00:46,760
The day the it fell?

736
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:48,420
Yes.

737
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,870
Whose is this?

738
01:00:58,870 --> 01:01:01,110
It's mine.

739
01:01:01,110 --> 01:01:02,900
Is that so?

740
01:01:04,630 --> 01:01:07,110
You two, go upstairs.

741
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:17,870
What is it?

742
01:01:17,870 --> 01:01:19,640
Gong Ki Joon.

743
01:01:21,420 --> 01:01:23,530
You're expelled.

744

01:02:31,900 --> 01:02:35,280
 Tell it to me straight. Why did you go to the rooftop that day? 

752
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:36,740
 How can it be so easy? 

753
01:02:36,740 --> 01:02:38,990
 Why expel him without even investigating? 

754
01:02:38,990 --> 01:02:41,600
 - Is it fun for you? 
 - I thought you didn't care about me. 

755
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:42,730
 It's true, isn't it? 

756
01:02:42,730 --> 01:02:45,320
 I don't know what I expected from you. 

757
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:47,340
 Are you still here? I'm changing. 

758
01:02:47,340 --> 01:02:49,340
 I'll wait in front of the office till you come. 

759

 I'll just pretend I never sawâ€”

 Hey! 

761
01:02:52,850 --> 01:02:55,660
 What is he thinking? 

762
01:02:57,150 --> 01:02:59,390
 Don't do what you're planning to do.
