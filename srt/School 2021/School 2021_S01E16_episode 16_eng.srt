1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,690
   

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,140
   

3
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:11,890
   

4
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:14,950
   

5
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:17,080
   

6
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:21,150
   

7
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:33,840
   

8
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,400
I have a question!

9
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:42,650
What do you mean exactly by "close the school"?

10
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:47,650
It's just as I said.

11
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:49,960
Nulji Science and Technology High School

12
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,590
will be shut down.

13
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:54,300
What?

14
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,410
What's he saying?

15
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:00,820
That's nonsense.

16
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:03,690
This is ridiculous.

17
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:06,000
Don't do this.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,560
Let me go!

19
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,390
What are you doing?

20
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,840
 What? 

21
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,690
Getting rid of the school?

22
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:36,550
What does that mean?

23
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:38,740
The Foundation stabbed us in the back.

24
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:41,370
The ultimate boss, who is stronger than Director Gu,

25
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:43,100
appeared and said the school will close.

26
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:46,660
He's sick of everything, so he's just getting rid of it.

27
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:48,190
"The ultimate boss"?

28
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:49,470
Who is it?

29
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:51,380
Shin Cheol Min.

30
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:56,580
You know CEO Shin Eul Seop, the founder of our school,

31
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:58,420
Mr. Shin is his son.

32
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:00,020
What?

33
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,720
He's going to get rid of the school!

34
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:08,060
- Is that even possible? 
 - It's unbelievable.

35
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:10,630
What was the point of everything we did?

36
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:16,250
Mr. Shin.

37
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:19,390
Shutting down the school...

38
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:20,730
This isn't what we agreed on.

39
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:22,130
What isn't?

40
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:24,170
Come on.

41
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:31,100
I thought you were going to announce that there would be a new director.

42
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,320
You can be the director now.

43
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,080
Listen to this guy here...

44
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,130
Are you playing around?

45
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:38,670
The school will be closed.

46
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:42,840
You can still be director until the current students graduate.

47
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:47,780
If you don't want to, you don't have to.

48
00:02:55,300 --> 00:03:01,400
Maybe... we shouldn't have done anything 
    

49
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,240
Then things might've not turned out this way.

50
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:08,620
We only tried to right what was wrong.

51
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:11,570
You don't have to say that.

52
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:17,530
It's not as if our school is so useless

53
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:20,260
that it can just disappear like this.

54
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:25,410
Is what we're learning so useless?

55
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:28,230
We didn't do anything wrong.

56
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:31,300
So let's not blame ourselves.

57
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:37,620
Let's go.

58
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,840
Ki Joon.

59
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:51,990
Mom.

60
00:03:57,330 --> 00:03:59,210
   

61
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:03,250
Gosh. You must have been hungry.

62
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,190
You should have stopped by before work.

63
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:08,300
I wasn't hungry then.

64
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:11,020
You guys must be worried about your school.

65
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:13,270
I didn't think they would go so far.

66
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:15,460
It was a good school.

67
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:17,720
Before Director Gu took over,

68
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,430
it had a good reputation in the area.

69
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:24,590
The school's founder was actually a great person.

70
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:26,490
- The CEO of Sang Rim? 
 - Yes.

71
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:30,210
His children and his family made a mess,

72
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:33,120
but the CEO really cared about the school.

73
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,880
I see.

74
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,220
It really is a love-hate relationship with that school.

75
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:41,430
I have to go now.

76
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:43,080
- What? 
 - See you at school.

77
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,390
So soon?

78
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:47,180
Bye.

79
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:54,230
Should I take you home?

80
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:55,730
What for?

81
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:58,010
The bus station's right there.

82
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,420
- I guess you're right. 
 - I'm going.

83
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:04,270
- Good night. 
 - Bye.

84
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,230
What?

85
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:17,280
What?

86
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:30,700
What are you doing?

87
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:37,430
You should have told me before coming.

88
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:39,350
And if I did,

89
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:42,620
you would have said not to come.

90
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:51,070
You were here by yourself...

91
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:58,060
I am so thankful to Ji Won's family, but...

92
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:00,100
You foolish boy!

93
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:04,210
Why didn't you say something if you're in this situation?

94
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,690
What's the point of telling you?

95
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:12,480
You can just... live over there happily.

96
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:18,720
Has your dad...

97
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:21,950
ever called you?

98
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:27,740
You said there were a few calls from unknown numbers.

99
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:33,240
It's been a while since I lost touch with him.

100
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,090
Even though

101
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:38,800
he's being chased because of his debt,

102
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,880
how could he leave his child alone like this?

103
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:47,060
And he doesn't even know that his own father has passed away.

104
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:52,800
Anyway, I've already reserved the plane tickets.

105
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,010
Let's pack up.

106
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,550
I never said I was going.

107
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:02,950
I told you over the phone.

108
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:05,680
My husband agreed,

109
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,890
and you can get back into doing taekwondo again at Uncle's studio.

110
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:15,980
There's actually more potential for you over there than there is staying here.

111
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,780
Why did give up taekwondo?

112
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:20,010
You were so good at it.

113
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:22,210
I'm not good at taekwondo.

114
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:29,300
And why would I go over there

115
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,340
after all this time?

116
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:35,030
How could I?

117
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:41,690
I thought you and I were separately going to

118
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:43,590
live our lives well.

119
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:46,250
The situation has changed.

120
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:47,860
Grandpa isn't alive anymore.

121
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:50,880
How are you going to live here by yourself?

122
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:56,130
Stop being stubborn.

123
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:58,010
Come on.

124
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:00,790
Ki Joon...

125
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:03,620
I'm sorry.

126
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:07,240
I'm sorry for everything,

127
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:10,040
so please come with me.

128
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,920
It's better for Ki Joon to go.

129
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,490
I felt so relieved when I saw Ki Joon's mom.

130
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:27,050
Of course, he's still a child.

131
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:28,780
What 18-year-old is a child?

132
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:30,690
Of course, he's a child.

133
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:34,380
Thinking about our Ji Won being alone like that...

134
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,270
No, no way.

135
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:37,840
No way.

136
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,700
- No way. 
 - Gosh.

137
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,480
I guess so.

138
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,570
Is this okay with you?

139
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:49,750
It can be a little cold, but it's fast.

140
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,710
It looks like you now wear those often.

141
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:02,270
These days, it feels weird and empty without them.

142
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:07,240
Here.

143
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,890
Put it on.

144
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,990
 Hey. 

145
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:11,870
 You should date me. 

146
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:13,420
 What's this? 

147
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,070
 It's your birthday. 

148
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:17,390
 Why do you only think about yourself? 

149
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:19,280
 Don't you think of those who worry about you? 

150
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:22,660
 I think I actually had fun hanging out with you. 

151
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,410
Are you up?

152
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:02,640
Get washed and come out. You should have breakfast.

153
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:07,400
   

154
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:12,190
You finally finished it. Jin Ji Won's bench.

155
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:16,980
It's nice.

156
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:20,620
Did you talk things over with your mom?

157
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:23,210
You must be really happy she's here.

158
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:25,250
It's awkward.

159
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:26,870
I haven't seen her in so long.

160
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:30,710
I heard she's here to take you back with her.

161
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:34,360
Have you decided?

162
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,650
Not yet.

163
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:43,000
It's good to have Mom here.

164
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,810
You play so badly.

165
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:05,610
I'm going easy on you. Don't test me.

166
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:26,420
Have you decided what to do?

167
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:33,720
Can't you just stay here?

168
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:41,130
Why? So I can play with you?

169
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:51,120
You know, honestly,

170
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:57,390
it's been a little scary going home after Grandpa passed away.

171
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:03,420
Going home alone to a dark house

172
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:07,670
is hard to get used to.

173
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:14,150
Hey.

174
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:17,000
Maybe I should just move into your house.

175
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:19,830
That's the worst.

176
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:28,270
Maybe I should just go there and do taekwondo like Mom says.

177
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:34,270
You've been really enjoying carpentry recently.

178
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:37,510
If you go, won't you do carpentry anymore?

179
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,530
I guess.

180
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:45,240
I was going to work hard on it, but the school is closing now.

181
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:50,000
I don't even know what to make of it.

182
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:54,090
What about Ji Won?

183
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:10,100
 I can't believe we met here! 

184
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,900
 Let's sit over there. 

185
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,340
 Did you hear Nulji High is closing? 

186
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:15,360
 It's for the better. 

187
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,310
I hope they build a specialist high school or a private school after Nulji High closes.

188
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:22,040
Will house prices go up then?

189
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,990
Honestly, school districts are so important.

190
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:27,440
Aigoo, that technical high school nonsense.

191
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,300
I feel better now that it's being shut down.

192
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,330
That's what I'm saying.

193
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:34,350
 Goodness, you're both being too harsh. 

194
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:35,170
Sorry?

195
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:38,320
Have Nulji High students ever caused trouble?

196
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,780
How can you say such a thing?

197
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:43,020
Director, you're so strange today.

198
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:45,130
We're leaving.

199
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:01,640
It's not easy to make a living.

200
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,380
Right?

201
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:10,350
Seo Young, your grade dropped a lot on the mock test that you took last time.

202
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:12,980
Is it because of school?

203
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,590
Well...

204
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:19,660
I'm just not focusing so well lately.

205
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:21,800
Even if the school shuts down,

206
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:25,610
you must push through with your goal. Right?

207
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,100
Right.

208
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,340
 Working woman coming through! 

209
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:42,820
   

210
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:47,230
I got my first paycheck today, so I'm paying.

211
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:49,340
Eat up, all of you.

212
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:52,800
Isn't a galbi restaurant on your first paycheck too much?

213
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,600
Aigoo. It's no pressure on my wallet, even if you eat a lot.

214
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,180
So don't worry and eat up.

215
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:59,310
- Okay. 
 - Thanks for the food.

216
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:02,110
- It looks so good. 
 - Eat up.

217
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:06,390
How is it?

218
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:09,290
Galbi is best when cooked on a charcoal grill.

219
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:10,850
- Right on. 
 - It's so good.

220
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:12,730
Thank you, Min Seo.

221
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:14,940
Is the new apprenticeship site better?

222
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,460
- There's no one like that last manager, right? 
 - Not at all.

223
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:19,830
I should have gone here from the start. It's so nice.

224
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:22,840
The seniors are really nice about teaching me everything.

225
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,810
I envy you.

226
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:26,020
Maybe I should've joined the apprenticeship class, too.

227
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:29,970
You go to school, get paid, and learn on the job.

228
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:32,310
I'm really glad.

229
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:33,830
By the way, are you okay?

230
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:37,410
I was so shocked watching Mr. Lee's and your interview.

231
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:38,700
Didn't you get in trouble at home?

232
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,590
I got in huge trouble.

233
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:42,730
Jae Hyeok said he'll drop out and study abroad.

234
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:44,930
I was almost forced to do the same,

235
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:47,710
but I finally got to school after a hunger strike.

236
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:49,190
Still, thank you.

237
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:52,050
Thanks to you, we stopped the Guidance Committee meeting.

238
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:54,550
And we exposed the corruption at our school.

239
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:59,430
What's the point? The school's about to disappear completely.

240
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,770
   

241
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:23,710
 Your grade dropped a lot on the mock test that you took last time. 

242
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,940
 You must push through with your goal. 

243
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:27,710
 Right? 

244
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:38,970
I haven't had your steamed galbi in so long.

245
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:49,540
I'll make dishes like this every day if you come with me.

246
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:51,720
Mom, as for that...

247
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:54,340
I'll have to think about it.

248
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:59,880
I also heard that your school is shutting down.

249
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,390
Is it true?

250
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:04,200
Is there no hope?

251
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,110
I don't think so.

252
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:10,730
Oh, well.

253
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:14,440
This is your chance to leave construction or carpentry behind you.

254
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,510
It's hot in summer and cold in winter.

255
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:17,960
All that dust and noise.

256
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:21,140
Why would you want to work in such a dangerous field?

257
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:22,740
Listen to your mom.

258
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:26,390
Why stay at a school that's about to close?

259
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:36,470
Ji Won.

260
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:38,310
Hello.

261
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:40,030
Ji Won...

262
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:43,310
May I talk with you for a moment?

263
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:47,500
Cheol Joo gave you this? 
    

264
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,630
Yes.

265
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:51,530
The alumni group collected signatures against closing the school.

266
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:54,370
He also asked current students to sign.

267
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:56,800
Where? Where? Let me see.

268
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,100
Our seniors are the best.

269
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:02,600
"Lee Young Sun." 
    

270
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,670
"Installed the bus stop in front of Haerang Hospital"?

271
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:07,660
Oh! I know that place.

272
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,780
- Really? 
 - Yes.

273
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,010
Let me see.

274
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:13,480
"Ham Oh Young. Graduated from Nulji High Architectural Department."

275
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:16,280
"Did interior work at Taewon district Myoungmun Apartment."

276
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,000
Oh! That's my home.

277
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,470
- Really? 
 - Yes.

278
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:20,690
Let me see.

279
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:23,570
"Kang Ji Hoon. Graduated from the Landscape Gardening Department."

280
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:27,770
"Did repair work on playground and slide at Eulrin Apartment Number Two."

281
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:30,380
Wow, there are so many.

282
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:32,100
Guys.

283
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:35,230
We don't have time for this.

284
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:40,990
   

285
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:42,150
You guys should sign too.

286
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:43,630
Give it to me.

287
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:45,270
Let's do it!

288
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:46,480
Me, me!

289
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,700
Let's do this!

290
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:53,820
♫  My heart keeps thinking of you  ♫

291

309
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:44,460
The students and the alumni came together like this.

310
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:48,140
The faculty and parents participated as well.

311
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:50,890
Won't we be able to do something

312
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:53,150
if we submit this to the Ministry of Education?

313
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:54,740
Principal Oh.

314
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:58,570
I really don't want our school to shut down.

315
00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:01,060
The Foundation people are the ones at fault.

316
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:03,930
I don't understand why the school has to close.

317
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:08,600
Could you please help protect the school?

318
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:21,350
For now, I will try submitting it.

319
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:29,050
I'm ashamed that I don't have any power.

320
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:35,280
   

321
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:53,940
 Ji Won, can you help me convince Ki Joon? 

322
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:56,320
 He says he's all right, 

323
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,650
 but he must be very lonely and struggling 

324
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:01,630
 since his grandpa passed away. 

325
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:03,850
 It's good to have Mom here. 

326
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:15,320
You're here.

327
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,120
Let's go.

328
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:28,130
We haven't gone on a date in so long.

329
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,690
Did you eat before you came out?

330
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:32,900
I did.

331
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:36,760
It's proper Korean food every meal these days.

332
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:40,380
No wonder.

333
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,590
You're chubbier.

334
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:46,270
No, I'm not.

335
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:49,880
I'm just saying you're cute.

336
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:52,460
- Pretty. 
 - Yes.

337
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:56,090
- Pretty. 
 - Pretty.

338
00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:56,940
Look.

339
00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:03,740
♫  I get nervous sometimes because I like you  ♫

340
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:06,700
I want to show you that and take a picture of it.

341
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:10,200
Careful.

342
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:15,180
♫  I want to see the swaying waves  ♫

343
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:26,010
♫  I want to see you more on my way there  ♫

344
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:27,940
- Shall I take one of you? 
 - Let's get one together.

345
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,540
- Together? 
 - Sure.

346
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:33,370
One, two, three.

347
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:38,500
Got it. How do I see it?

348
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:41,960
♫  During that time, my heart  ♫

349
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:45,290
We kind of look alike here.

350
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:54,800
♫  I think about you  ♫

351
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:59,870
♫  And it makes me happy  ♫

352
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:05,420
♫  Then, in the next moment  ♫

353
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:07,660
♫  I ache  ♫

354
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:09,340
It's pretty.

355
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,320
You're here.

356
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,440
What is it so suddenly?

357
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:55,180
I, ah...

358
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:58,400
Shall we get something to drink first?

359
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:22,190
I realized...

360
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:25,870
I have a lot to thank you for.

361
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,450
So I thought the feelings I had

362
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:32,380
were because I felt grateful.

363
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:36,070
But I don't think that's everything.

364
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:40,550
I keep thinking about you,

365
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:43,140
and when I'm with you,

366
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:45,010
it's nice.

367
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,400
I worry about you.

368
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,920
Things like that.

369
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:52,650
And I'm curious...

370
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:55,660
to know how you feel.

371
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:59,290
So I was wondering...

372
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:02,580
- should we— 
 - Wait.

373
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:03,600
Pardon?

374
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,170
Can I speak first?

375
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:10,600
Okay. What is it?

376
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:14,640
I've been thinking.

377
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,400
I think too much has happened to me recently.

378
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,520
I'll be a senior soon.

379
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:24,300
I can't waste time anymore.

380
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:26,590
So I think...

381
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:30,340
I need...

382
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:34,680
to keep some distance from you.

383
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:40,410
Is that so?

384
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,750
I hope you understand.

385
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:50,440
Of course.

386
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,910
D-Don't worry.

387
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:56,010
I can't be a distraction to you.

388
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:10,910
As expected, I always feel at ease when I visit a hanok*. 
  (TN: traditional Korean house) 

389
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:14,200
Things must have been complicated for you,

390
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,690
all this time.

391
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,520
I guess you're right.

392
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:30,940
Ki Joon,

393
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:35,840
I've been thinking.

394
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:40,020
I think it would be better for you

395
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:42,950
to go with your mom.

396
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:46,830
Really?

397
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:49,960
Why?

398
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:55,880
It's more stable to be with your family.

399
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:58,780
You'll have more options there.

400
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:00,760
I thought that...

401
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:04,480
you'd be happier that way.

402
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:09,870
If you're hesitating at all because of me,

403
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:11,210
I'm really okay.

404
00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:14,040
Wherever you are, I can video-chat to you,

405
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,700
and I'll see you every day when you visit Korea.

406
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:18,540
Okay?

407
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:22,510
Don't think about it so seriously.

408
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:24,210
What is it called?

409
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:25,610
"Long-distance."

410
00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:28,300
Just think we're in a long-distance relationship.

411
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:50,970
Eun Bi, didn't you finish memorizing the choreography?

412
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:53,510
No. I did, but...

413
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:55,470
I think I was just nervous.

414
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:58,370
Do you think the others weren't nervous?

415
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:00,610
I'm sorry.

416
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:06,400
   

417
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:09,260
Hey, hey.

418
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:16,100
Eun Bi, something came for you.

419
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,870
Oh, my!

420
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:20,450
Oh my God!

421
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:22,860
Wow. I'm so hungry.

422
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:25,040
Can I have some?

423
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,100
Of course.

424
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,400
What's this?

425
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,380
Do you have it too?

426
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:36,140
What is it?

427
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:41,340
   

428
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:42,860
   

429
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:44,880
   

430
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:51,740
   

431
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:54,030
   

432
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,310
Eun Bi, what's going on?

433
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:37,270
Were you eliminated already?

434
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:39,510
No way. Why would you be eliminated?

435
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:41,000
It's not like that.

436
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,540
I don't have much time, so listen carefully.

437
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:44,850
What?

438
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:47,820
About what?

439
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:52,420
Don't shut me out.

440
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:55,910
Did I ask you to marry me or something?

441
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,560
No.

442
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,770
We can just date.

443
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:01,260
Is a baby daddy* not even allowed to date? 
  (TN: a solo father) 

444
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:03,340
Is it illegal? Will they arrest you?

445
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:05,450
Let's just date for now...

446
00:31:06,410 --> 00:31:07,900
you and me.

447
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:16,800
Why aren't you saying anything?

448
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:19,190
Is it a yes or a no?

449
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,460
Hey, hurry up.

450
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:25,640
I have to go back. I snuck out.

451
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:29,980
Yes!

452
00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:10,090
 I need to keep some distance from you. 

453
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:27,550
   

454
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:32,950
How do you feel?

455
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:35,950
I'm a little weak.

456
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:39,130
But at least, I'm clear-minded.

457
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:42,040
It feels much better.

458
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:44,650
All your vitals look great.

459
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:48,130
Your examination results are all normal.

460
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:52,410
You can return to everyday life as soon as you recover.

461
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:54,850
Thank you.

462
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,480
Shin Eul Seop!

463
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:04,130
   

464
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:08,150
I had no idea the school was in such a state.

465
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:15,130
Still, they are all hoping for Nulji High to remain open.

466
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:21,780
But I don't think we're qualified anymore.

467
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:25,900
There's been so much corruption, and even its closure was declared.

468
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:30,420
How could we shamelessly continue to run the school?

469
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,570
Hey.

470
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:41,870
Have you been to the new noodle place?

471
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:45,710
Don't take this the wrong way.

472
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:48,980
I've just been craving noodles.

473
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:51,400
- Hey. 
 - Hey.

474
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,770
Hey.

475
00:33:52,770 --> 00:33:53,950
Yes?

476
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:55,470
What are you doing this weekend?

477
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:57,300
Weekend...

478
00:33:57,300 --> 00:34:00,530
A movie I've wanted to see is out.

479
00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:01,680
Don't take this the wrong way.

480
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:05,820
I just needed a pick-me-up at the moment.

481
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:17,730
Seo Young.

482
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:25,370
   

483
00:34:27,950 --> 00:34:29,640
Hi.

484
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:13,730
You can keep studying.

485
00:35:15,450 --> 00:35:17,610
I'll stay right about here.

486
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:21,080
I'll stay here.

487
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:38,730
You dare to mess with the school?

488
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:39,910
Get out this instant!

489
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:43,390
Forget about the company and everything else!

490
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:48,260
Aigoo, you're pretty without doing that.

491
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:51,190
Keep your soulless compliments to yourself.

492
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:55,670
Gosh, my skin's losing its suppleness now I'm older.

493
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:58,190
Wow, this is great.

494
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:00,180
- Mom. 
 - Yes?

495
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:02,910
- What's this? 
 - What is it?

496
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:08,450
   

497
00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:14,320
 Ji Won did this? 

498
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:17,780
That girl... 
    

499
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:24,020
 It's pretty sturdy. 

500
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:30,510
Well...

501
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:37,270
Oh my, look at her overreacting.

502
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:39,200
Mom.

503
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:44,700
Seriously. Yes, yes...

504
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:46,790
Goodness.

505
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:52,560
   

506
00:37:14,330 --> 00:37:18,990
You did a great job building them.

507
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:22,200
So grandpa, you...

508
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:24,280
I mean...

509
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:28,640
Sir, are you the founder of our school?

510
00:37:30,270 --> 00:37:35,460
Students, I heard you all worked hard for this school.

511
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:40,310
I was bedridden for too long, and didn't even realize what had happened to the school.

512
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:43,060
I'm ashamed.

513
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:48,250
But still, the students protected this school.

514
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:53,040
To be precise, we didn't end up protecting it.

515
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:56,240
I've worked out some things as a finishing touch

516
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:01,020
to add to what you all have already done.

517
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:06,210
The school is going to remain open.

518
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:07,340
Pardon?

519
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:08,590
Really?

520
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:09,640
Yes.

521
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:13,710
The CEO just came back from visiting the Ministry of Education himself.

522
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:15,730
Sang Rim will step down from running the school

523
00:38:15,730 --> 00:38:20,000
and the Ministry of Education will work to normalize the school.

524
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:27,080
This school is more dear to me than any other company owned by Sang Rim.

525
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,980
I'm sorry that

526
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:32,460
I couldn't protect such a school,

527
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:37,510
and I thank you all for protecting it in my place.

528
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:40,000
We're stepping down from running the school,

529
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,100
but as an apology for all the wrongdoings,

530
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:46,160
we will give you full financial support.

531
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:50,150
So all you have to do is learn everything you want.

532
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:52,950
Thank you.

533
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:55,950
- We did it! 
 - I'm so relieved.

534
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:01,220
We did it!

535
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:16,440
Ki Joon.

536
00:39:24,170 --> 00:39:27,950
Our school will get better, right?

537
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:33,400
I never imagined that the CEO of Sang Rim would step forward.

538
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:37,950
I'm really glad the school isn't going to be shut down.

539
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:39,550
So am I.

540
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:42,950
It was worth all that work.

541
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:46,410
We'll still have to see what happens going forward.

542
00:40:01,050 --> 00:40:02,620
Here.

543
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:04,620
This is for you.

544
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,000
What's this?

545
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,940
A good luck charm.

546
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:14,180
When you go there, carry it with you.

547
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:17,350
Just think I'm watching over you.

548
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:23,150
You've decided to go, right?

549
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:27,590
Yes.

550
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:31,010
How did you know?

551
00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:33,970
You know I'm pretty quick at reading people.

552
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:38,510
Are you okay?

553
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:40,170
Of course.

554
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:42,110
I told you before.

555
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:44,770
I'm really okay.

556
00:40:44,770 --> 00:40:46,400
I'm sorry.

557
00:40:56,270 --> 00:40:59,350
You made the right choice.

558
00:40:59,350 --> 00:41:03,350
I want to visit you there sometime.

559
00:41:03,350 --> 00:41:05,610
Is that okay?

560
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:10,090
Of course.

561
00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:15,300
I would really love it if you visited.

562
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:22,340
Can I open it?

563
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:25,880
It's embarrassing, so look at it later.

564
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,630
When you get there.

565
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:29,940
Open it then.

566
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:32,210
Okay.

567
00:41:33,210 --> 00:41:35,140
Thank you.

568
00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:46,390
I have a gift for you too.

569
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:52,690
Can I open mine?

570
00:41:52,690 --> 00:41:54,970
You can open it.

571
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,510
This is...

572
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:13,150
 It's pretty. 

573
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:26,060
I already know you're going to run around

574
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:29,970
whether it's freezing or not.

575
00:42:30,990 --> 00:42:33,260
You might catch a cold.

576
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:41,280
It looks good on you.

577
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,280
It's warm.

578
00:42:44,950 --> 00:42:46,890
Thank you.

579
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,750
Pretty.

Safe travels.

Be well, Ki Joon.

I will.

583

Thank you so much

for everything.

Thank you so much for taking care of Ki Joon while I was away.

586

Gosh, don't mention it.

587
00:43:26,250 --> 00:43:28,310
Go on ahead. You'll be late.

588

All right.

 Carpentry's fun, isn't it? 

596
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:10,180
 Commit to it. Don't waste your time on anything else. 

597
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:14,590
 Still, it hasn't been long since you started. Your skills have improved a lot. 

598

 Do you know that you're really talented in this field?

 It's more fun than I thought.

00:50:38,030 --> 00:50:39,920
Congratulations, Dear Girls!

674
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:42,850
Congratulations! Please tell us how you feel.

675
00:50:42,850 --> 00:50:43,970
Well...

676
00:50:43,970 --> 00:50:45,950
   

677
00:50:45,950 --> 00:50:48,330
Thank you so much.

678
00:50:48,330 --> 00:50:51,410
Ho Sung, I got first place.

679
00:50:51,410 --> 00:50:54,390
Thank you. I love you!

680
00:50:54,390 --> 00:50:57,820
 Eun Bi eventually became an idol. 

681
00:50:57,820 --> 00:50:59,230
   

682
00:51:01,170 --> 00:51:04,830
 An unprecedented idol, whose boyfriend is a baby daddy. 

683
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:08,100
   

684
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:09,260
   

685
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:14,880
 Ho Sung, I got first place. 

686
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:17,690
 Thank you. I love you! 

687
00:51:17,690 --> 00:51:19,350
   

688
00:51:21,510 --> 00:51:23,340
Yes, Teacher?

689
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:28,310
My Hyun Woo bit his friend again?

690
00:51:28,310 --> 00:51:30,470
 Ho Sung's many dreams 

691
00:51:30,470 --> 00:51:36,110
 narrowed down to being a good dad and Eun Bi's manager. 

692
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:41,060
Guys–

693
00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:44,460
- Our teacher said if we don't decide on our graduation photo theme by today, 
 - No study, man!

694
00:51:44,460 --> 00:51:46,510
- our class will wear school uniform. 
 - Get out.

695
00:51:46,510 --> 00:51:49,200
- Gosh, be quiet. 
 - Please, guys!

696
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:51,720
Let's just wear our uniforms. What's so important about it?

697
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:53,390
No way. We should wear dresses.

698
00:51:53,390 --> 00:51:57,430
Hey! Let's cosplay as characters. That'd be the most entertaining.

699
00:51:57,430 --> 00:52:00,620
Come on, let's agree on something. Our poor Class President.

700
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:02,190
I tell you, this idea's the best.

701
00:52:02,190 --> 00:52:04,360
- Hey, students should wear uniforms. 
 - What will you dress up as?

702
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:06,840
- Well, I... 
 - You want to be Mario, right?

703
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:09,350
I've hated Mario from the moment I was born.

704
00:52:09,350 --> 00:52:11,030
Do you have any idea how important dresses are?

705
00:52:11,030 --> 00:52:13,650
- Mario? Seriously? 
 - I can't hear you...

706
00:52:13,650 --> 00:52:16,980
 Jae Hee made a lot of friends like she wanted, 

707
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:20,040
 but thanks to that, she's suffering as the class president. 

708
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:22,530
 But I heard she likes it better now than before. 

709
00:52:22,530 --> 00:52:24,210
- So what? Television! 
 - So what? Fridge!

710
00:52:24,210 --> 00:52:26,470
- So what? Television, television! 
 - So what? Kimchi fridge!

711
00:52:26,470 --> 00:52:30,500
 My friends are all on their way to finding their dreams. 

712
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:35,950
 Tae Ri said stability was best, so she's preparing for the Civil Service exam. 

713
00:52:36,510 --> 00:52:40,190
 Hyo Joo will start an on-site apprenticeship at an architectural design office. 

714
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:41,390
Try it, try it...

715
00:52:41,390 --> 00:52:46,400
 Min Ki will be working at the interior company established by Nulji High's alumni. 

716
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:47,270
- Stop, enough. 
 - You said you'd do it.

717
00:52:47,270 --> 00:52:51,880
 Min Seo will soon be a full-timer at the company where she did an apprenticeship. 

718
00:52:52,770 --> 00:52:54,320
- Jae Hee! 
 -   Ah! 

719
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:58,780
 Jong Bok plans to officially meet Jae Hee's parents soon. 

720
00:52:58,780 --> 00:53:02,940
 Apparently, he already thinks of himself as part of Sang Rim's family. 

721
00:53:05,410 --> 00:53:10,770
Chief, even students on apprenticeship programs are employees. You can't keep them doing chores...

722
00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:15,480
 The faculty hasn't changed, but there's been some shifts in positions. 

723
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:21,100
Then, I'll visit the site later today.

724
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:23,230
All right.

725
00:53:24,870 --> 00:53:26,800
Are you going to the students' worksites again?

726
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:29,440
I have to. Geez.

727
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:32,350
It's not my style to live so diligently.

728
00:53:32,350 --> 00:53:34,680
I'm not going to be in charge of apprenticeships next year.

729
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:38,920
 Mr. Lee, unfortunately, hasn't yet achieved his dream of work-life-balance. 

730
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:40,270
Good morning.

731
00:53:40,270 --> 00:53:42,410
Hello.

732
00:53:44,010 --> 00:53:45,250
We'll start our meeting now.

733
00:53:45,250 --> 00:53:48,300
 Ms. Song became the head of the Architectural Design department. 

734
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:52,040
Ms. Song. I want to do this project.

735
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:56,750
- What's this? 
 - Baro Furniture's carpentry project for high school students.

736
00:53:56,750 --> 00:53:59,970
I heard that past students did this and were employed there.

737
00:53:59,970 --> 00:54:03,110
Aigoo. Doing that again at that company?

738
00:54:03,110 --> 00:54:06,400
But there are already too many clubs.

739
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:10,030
There isn't a teacher suitable to take it on...

740
00:54:14,730 --> 00:54:17,630
 Mr. Lee Han Soo remained at school. 

741
00:54:17,630 --> 00:54:20,990
 He got a pay cut, and was demoted to a regular teacher, 

742
00:54:20,990 --> 00:54:24,720
 but apparently, he couldn't give up on his pension. 

743
00:54:28,110 --> 00:54:30,880
- Fighting. 
 - Congratulations.

744
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:40,070
 And me... 

745
00:54:42,870 --> 00:54:46,080
 I'm on apprenticeship at Baro Furniture. 

746
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:48,340
Ki Joon, could you come here?

747
00:54:48,340 --> 00:54:49,690
Yes.

748
00:54:49,690 --> 00:54:50,820
This hole here.

749
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:54,340
 I'm still cutting and assembling wood. 

750
00:54:54,340 --> 00:54:58,080
 And it's still hard and awkward to inspect the machines. 

751
00:54:58,700 --> 00:55:04,260
 But working at a place filled with smell of wood, I'm reminded of Grandpa a lot. 

752
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:08,170
 It all means that I'm rather happy. 

753
00:55:08,170 --> 00:55:10,880
Hey, "golden hands number two."

754
00:55:12,870 --> 00:55:14,530
What brings you here?

755
00:55:14,530 --> 00:55:18,450
I'm just taking a walk.

756
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:21,620
And you, is the job suitable?

757
00:55:21,620 --> 00:55:24,950
Well... I'm still finding my way.

758
00:55:26,850 --> 00:55:29,150
So where is "golden hands number one"?

759
00:55:29,150 --> 00:55:32,510
Oh, Young Joo? He was just...

760
00:55:35,890 --> 00:55:37,740
Hello.

761
00:55:38,830 --> 00:55:42,210
Something urgent came up. I have to go.

762
00:55:42,210 --> 00:55:44,490
Hey. Where are you going?

763
00:55:44,490 --> 00:55:45,570
I'm in a hurry.

764
00:55:45,570 --> 00:55:48,950
 - Of course, that guy's with me.  
 - I'll go ahead.

765
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:54,270
 Boy, I'm getting tired of that guy. 

766
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:09,700
Were you waiting long? I wanted to wait for you in front of the test site.

767
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:10,870
Sorry.

768
00:56:10,870 --> 00:56:13,290
It's okay. You were working.

769
00:56:13,290 --> 00:56:16,260
So how does it feel to finish the college entrance exam?

770
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:18,620
I'm not sure.

771
00:56:18,620 --> 00:56:23,160
The first thing is I want to sleep for about 48 hours.

772
00:56:24,540 --> 00:56:28,660
Wow! You really worked hard.

773
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:29,890
I acknowledge it.

774
00:56:29,890 --> 00:56:31,820
Of course.

775
00:56:31,820 --> 00:56:33,780
I couldn't do what I wanted due to study.

776
00:56:33,780 --> 00:56:36,850
I suppressed everything and worked so hard.

777
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:41,150
What did you want to do the most?

778
00:56:41,150 --> 00:56:45,160
Well, just... this and that.

779
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:50,580
Thank you.

780
00:56:50,580 --> 00:56:51,880
Pardon?

781
00:56:52,780 --> 00:56:54,000
For what?

782
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:57,570
For always being by my side.

783
00:57:09,350 --> 00:57:10,840
I...

784
00:57:11,450 --> 00:57:13,170
want to stop it now.

785
00:57:14,890 --> 00:57:17,580
Just being by your side.

786
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:32,450
It's cold.

787
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:55,320
 And Ji Won and I... became a long-distance couple like Ji Won predicted. 

788
00:58:07,870 --> 00:58:10,790
Hey, future son-in-law.

789
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:14,100
Are you thinking about Ji Won?

790
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:17,780
Do you miss her?

791
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:22,630
Me too.

792
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:25,520
Geez.

793
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:29,010
Who knew she would go so far away?

794
00:58:29,010 --> 00:58:31,270
I know.

795
00:58:46,050 --> 00:58:50,110
I don't think I can take this anymore.

796
00:58:56,600 --> 00:59:01,320
 Ji Won went to an apprenticeship at a hanok construction site far away in another province. 

797
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:02,420
Little bits here and there...

798
00:59:02,420 --> 00:59:05,470
 She wanted to work on-site even if it meant starting from the ground up. 

799
00:59:05,470 --> 00:59:07,840
 She's experiencing firsthand how low that ground is. 

800
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:10,810
- Try again. 
 - Okay.

801
00:59:10,810 --> 00:59:14,800
 Still, it's more like Jin Ji Won than ever. 

802
00:59:15,830 --> 00:59:18,680
 I like that Jin-Ji-Won face. 

803
00:59:19,990 --> 00:59:22,050
 And I like those eyes.

- Congratulations! 
 - Congratulations, guys.

819
01:00:53,590 --> 01:00:55,160
- Congratulations! 
 - Are you posting this?

820
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:57,770
Stop that! I don't want to be on it. I hate it!

821
01:00:57,770 --> 01:00:59,610
One, two, three!

822
01:00:59,610 --> 01:01:02,830
Eun Bi, congratulations on getting first place. Who's the flower? 
 - I am!

823
01:01:02,830 --> 01:01:04,760
I know.

824
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:08,350
I'm the flower, I am. Stop acting like that at school.

825
01:01:08,350 --> 01:01:10,210
Gosh, it's all your fault!

826
01:01:10,210 --> 01:01:11,930
- Congratulations on your graduation. 
 - Right on.

827
01:01:11,930 --> 01:01:13,430
There we go!

828
01:01:13,430 --> 01:01:17,000
Gosh, you're the best, man! You know I love you, man!

829
