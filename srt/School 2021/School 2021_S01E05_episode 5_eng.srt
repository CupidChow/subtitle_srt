1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,040


2
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,110
 You seem close with Ji Won again. 

3
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,450
 Do I? 

4
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,300
 Are you guys back to your old days? 

5
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,770
 "Old days"? 

6
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:52,070
 - What about the old days? 
 - Geez. 

7
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,170
 I mean, you guys are each other's first love. 

8
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:00,270
 What are you— 

9
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:02,040
 - We are not. 
 - What? 

10
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:05,080
 You're suspicious. Don't be shy about it and just tell me. 

11
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:07,880
 You like Ji Won, right? 

12
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:33,460
 Hey! 

13
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:37,610
   

14
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,370
 To Ki Joon. 

15
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:50,070
 Hey, it's me, Jin Ji Won. 

16
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:52,470
 I'll be honest with you. 

17
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:56,740
 I like you as much as the mountains and the sky. 

18
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:02,310
 When I see you, I feel like crying because I get excited, and the food tastes better. 

19
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:06,950
 I'm the happiest in the world when I'm with you. 

20
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:08,870
 Do you want to go out with me? 

21
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,900
 From Jin Ji Won. 

22
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:22,560
 Hey, Gong Ki Joon! 

23
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:28,520
 Hey, stop that! 

24
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,870
 Stop that! 

25
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:34,690
  Crybaby! Crybaby! Crybaby!  

26
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:37,230
 I'm not! 

27
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:41,450
   

28
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:54,970
 You're suspicious. 

29
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:57,360
 You like Ji Won, right? 

30
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,240
I...

31
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:20,260
want to try again.

32
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,210
Try what?

33
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,060
Ji Won!

34
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:37,310
Grandpa.

35
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:41,230
What...

36
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,710
You're early.

37
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:46,570
Yes. I even brought my tools.

38
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:47,690
What?

39
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:49,530
Were you two meeting up?

40
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:51,660
I heard that you two are in a competition.

41
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:54,220
I asked Grandpa to teach us carpentry.

42
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:57,470
Let's try learning it properly again like we did when we were young.

43
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:00,240
- All right. Let's go in. 
 - Okay.

44
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,470
What are you doing? Come on.

45
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:05,350
Me, too?

46
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:06,770
Aren't you also competing?

47
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:08,730
You know, I...

48
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:10,430
I have a schedule of my own.

49
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:12,800
Hey. I'm busy, too.

50
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,730
Seriously.

51
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:25,980
   

52
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:31,140
The plane* is hard to use, even after years of practice. 
  (TN: woodworking tool) 

53
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:34,460
The only way to improve is to keep using it.

54
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:37,380
Here. You try, Ji Won.

55
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,510
Give that to me.

56
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:49,720
Okay.

57
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:56,680
There we go.

58
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,910
Now, Ki Joon, you try.

59
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,730
Here.

60
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,450
Hold on, Ki Joon.

61
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:33,970
You...

62
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:38,160
You have to look at the direction of the wood.

63
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:49,170
Well? Can you feel it?

64
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:50,620
Can you feel it?

65
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:51,470
No.

66
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:54,050
Why can't you feel it?

67
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:56,640
Well, then...

68
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:59,700
Try planing five surfaces each.

69
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,960
- Make them smooth. 
 - Got it.

70
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,790
But... You have to show us how to do it.

71
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:06,640
I can't tell what to do.

72
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,610
Just give it a try.

73
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:10,790
You'll understand better the more you try.

74
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:13,810
- Begin! 
 - Begin!

75
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:15,200
All right.

76
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,940
But the plane—

77
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,250
"Feel" what?

78
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,410
She's good.

79
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,920
You're rushing with the saw.

80
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,170
Put this on.

81
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:11,330
You've hurt your hand.

82
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:12,960
When did you get here?

83
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,980
You should have said something.

84
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,210
Thanks.

85
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:25,290
But how did you know?

86
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:26,310
Know what?

87
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:28,970
You said I was rushing the saw.

88
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,650
Because I've seen it a lot.

89
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,180
My dad was a carpenter,

90
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:44,590
and I used to follow him to his workplace when I was young.

91
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,210
What happened to your hand?

92
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:57,250
I was riding a motorcycle for my part-time job.

93
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,880
It's nothing.

94
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:05,040
I think you need the bandages more than I do.

95
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,350
It's fine. Keep it.

96
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:08,900
I have a lot.

97
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:19,890
Ouch!

98
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,290
Hey.

99
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:33,490
You really suck at this.

100
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:36,770
I thought you'd have an advantage since you take after Grandpa.

101
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:39,410
What made you so confident about joining the competition?

102
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:42,880
Just wait. I'll get better soon.

103
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:56,240
You said you want to be a carpenter that builds traditional Korean houses like Grandpa, right?

104
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,100
Yes. Ever since I was little.

105
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,400
I envy you.

106
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,730
What for?

107
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:04,320
Just...

108
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:07,420
You're certain about everything.

109
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:11,100
What you want to do. What you want to be.

110
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:16,100
You will find something you want to do, too.

111
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:23,010
I don't know. It's not that easy to find.

112
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,180
Who knows?

113
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:28,320
You could start liking carpentry while doing this.

114
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,880
Life is unpredictable.

115
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,610
Carpentry...

116
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:37,270
I'm only doing this because it's all I can do right now.

117
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,440
They're quiet.

118
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:01,940
What?

119
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:03,920
The guys who won't leave you alone.

120
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:08,780
Didn't you want me to be your fake boyfriend because you had a lot of those?

121
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,570
There were a lot of them.

122
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:18,170
Is that cut on your hand okay?

123
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:22,050
Yes, it's fine.

124
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:23,540
Go easy.

125
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:26,140
Don't drain yourself at the beginning.

126
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:29,880
The competition task hasn't even been announced yet.

127
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:35,350
There's no time to relax. I have to win, no matter what.

128
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:38,140
So you have to work harder too.

129
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:40,700
So much pressure.

130
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:43,780
What... Is it because of the prize money?

131
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:48,460
I need the money, and I have to go to college.

132
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:52,320
And?

133
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,000
And then...

134
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:58,670
I will live like everyone else...

135
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,140
ordinarily.

136
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:11,560
We're here.

137
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,620
You're free to go.

138
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,270
Okay.

139
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:16,650
Bye.

140
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,140
Grandpa.

141
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:55,010
Are you unwell?

142
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:01,560
No, no.

143
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:05,270
It must be because I haven't planed in a while.

144
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:07,800
I'm sorry.

145
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,400
I shouldn't have begged you to teach us.

146
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,190
No, I...

147
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:14,200
It's all right.

148
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,080
I'll be fine after I rest a bit.

149
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,440
Don't worry.

150
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:26,550
Still, I'm just glad I get to see you often.

151
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:30,120
- I like that, too, but... 
 - Pardon?

152
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,110
Are you really all right?

153
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:33,930
I'm fine.

154
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:36,200
Don't worry about it.

155
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,630
But that Ki Joon...

156
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:42,390
Wouldn't it be nice if he walked you back?

157
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:46,000
That's not it. I told him to tidy up the carpentry room.

158
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,860
- Oh. Is that so? 
 - Yes.

159
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:49,630
Good job.

160
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:51,770
- All right, walk back safely. 
 - I will.

161
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:53,710
You rest well, Grandpa.

162
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:56,550
- I'll see you in. 
 - All right.

163
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:09,130
Are you still here?

164
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,630
What are you doing?

165
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:19,760
You really don't have to walk me back.

166
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,900
What?

167
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,980
I'm going to the convenience store.

168
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:40,830
Why are you following me?

169
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:43,100
We passed the convenience store.

170
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:46,550
I'm going to that other one over there.

171
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:48,980
Why?

172
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:56,240
There's something only they sell.

173
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:00,130
What is it?

174
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:02,320
What's up this early in the morning?

175
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,960
Well...

176
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:08,540
Could I have the keychain back?

177
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:15,050
It's all been resolved.

178
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:17,170
I heard the culprit confessed.

179
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:20,020
It's something important to me.

180
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,930
So please give it back.

181
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:27,550
Aigoo!

182
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:29,490
Good morning.

183
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:31,060
Hi.

184
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:35,630
Aigoo, I was going to tell you, okay?

185
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:37,610
Please take a look.

186
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:41,310
Wow, you’re efficient. I was going to share this around. 
  (TN: carpentry competition design) 

187
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:43,060
I got it.

188
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:44,560
Not yet.

189
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,310
I still think it was you who threw the flowerpot.

190
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:51,800
Why?

191
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:57,340
The confession was suspicious, and the evidence is clear.

192
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:09,880
Hey, Gong Ki Joon.

193
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:22,720
So... What is it?

194
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,690
What were you talking about earlier?

195
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:27,810
It's nothing.

196
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:30,090
You were talking about the flowerpot.

197
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:33,100
I thought it was resolved.

198
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:37,600
Yes, but... there's something left.

199
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:44,050
You know who threw the flowerpot from the rooftop, right?

200
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:50,400
I don't know why you're doing this, but it will open a can of worms.

201
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,380
I mean, don't bring it up anymore.

202
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:55,760
I barely managed to resolve it.

203
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,120
Thank you.

204
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,820
For looking out for Young Joo.

205
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:06,520
Don't say unnecessary things.

206
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:09,610
Do you understand what I'm saying?

207
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:11,840
I do understand.

208
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,170
But Young Joo dropped something on the rooftop.

209
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:22,010
Mr. Lee thinks it's mine.

210
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:25,890
I need to get it back for Young Joo.

211
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:27,070
What is it?

212
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:30,370
It's just a keychain.

213
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:32,150
But

214
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,030
it's important to Young Joo.

215
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:39,560
Why now?

216
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,380
Well, I'm not sure...

217
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:46,900
Maybe it's a good time to return it to him.

218
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,700
"A good time"?

219
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:55,170
All right, so they finally announced the competition task.

220
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:58,600
Well, as expected. A two-person bench.

221
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,950
By using what you've learned in recent weeks,

222
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:03,020
there won't be any issues, right?

223
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:06,410
Additionally, you all have to apply as a two-person group,

224
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:08,980
so we have to form pairs.

225
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:18,410
Well, it looks like you're all already paired up.

226
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:21,450
Take the design and review it in your groups.

227
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:24,050
Plan the detailed work process in advance,

228
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:27,460
and try the simulation multiple times with your partner.

229
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:29,920
This will help reduce mistakes at the competition.

230
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,740
Okay.

231
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:46,800
Hey.

232
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:49,830
You must be sad you weren't teamed up with Kang Seo Young.

233
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:51,430
What are you talking about?

234
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:54,790
I'm heading straight to first place by piggybacking on you.

235
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,520
I'm trusting you.

236
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,870
Five million won (~US$4,300) prize money.

237
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:09,660
So...You're on the same team as Ji Won...

238
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:10,980
Just you two?

239
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:13,010
Why are you asking me like that?

240
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:14,780
You're just saying weird stuff again.

241
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,400
You...

242
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,260
You're involved with Ji Won a lot these days.

243
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:21,830
I think...

244
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:24,790
you're making it look that way.

245
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:27,490
I guess you could tell.

246
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:29,370
You!

247
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:31,930
You're sharp.

248
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:40,960
Grandpa likes these, too.

249
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,960
Should I buy some?

250
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:47,990
Ma'am, 4,000 won (~US$3.50) worth of steamed buns, please.

251
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:58,210
-  The customer is not answering the phone.  
 - That's weird.

252
00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:00,020
Why is he still not picking up?

253
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:02,920
Wow. Amazing.

254
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,490
Thank you.

255
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:07,340
- I have to go. 
 - Okay.

256
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,420
- Bye. 
 - See you.

257
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:16,550
At first, I didn't know what to do,

258
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:18,540
so I was just numb.

259
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:19,910
But now it's okay.

260
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:24,550
I'm working out to show you guys a better me.

261
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:26,180
 Eun Bi, I've been waiting for you... 

262
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:29,100
 I wanted to see you all too. 

263
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,150
 Looking more adorable than usual? 

264
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:35,750
Come on, I always look adorable.

265
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:41,270
   

266
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:43,470
Don't play around.

267
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:46,320
I'll return as a better me.

268
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,410
Promise to wait for me.

269
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:58,500
 Sly b*tch. You borrowed small amounts from many people. 

270
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,660
 Can't pay her debts and can't even debut. 

271
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,240
 Are you doing anything right with your life? 

272
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,850
 You said you'd pay it back once you debuted. 

273
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:06,190
 Did you mean you wouldn't pay it back if you didn't debut? 

274
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:08,260
Did you borrow money?

275
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,250
How did you know I was here?

276
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:16,240
I could tell from the livestream.

277
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,270
Come on. Don't change the subject.

278
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:22,650
What were those comments talking about earlier?

279
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:25,250
What do you care?

280
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:28,630
You're so annoying!

281
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:53,300
Gra-Grandpa, Grandpa...

282
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:55,110
Let's get you up.

283
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:57,540
Grandpa, what's wrong? Are you okay?

284
00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:01,140
What's wrong? Wake up!

285
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:05,690
Wake up. Grandpa!

286
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:26,470
Are you his guardian?

287
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:29,230
Yes.

288
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:32,420
You look like a student. Is there anyone else?

289
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:33,970
No.

290
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:37,290
We need to perform emergency surgery immediately.

291
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:40,750
We will insert a stent into his heart to widen the veins artificially.

292
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:43,350
It will take around two hours.

293
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:44,920
Wait...

294
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,220
Is it dangerous?

295
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:48,670
No.

296
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:52,130
Your grandfather will be okay, so don't worry too much.

297
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:54,900
You can stay in the waiting room.

298
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:35,430
   

299
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:51,550
   

300
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:01,160
   

301
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:19,500
Gong Ki Joon.

302
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:49,930
Is Grandpa okay?

303
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:51,250
Yes, he is.

304
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:55,270
They said it's a simple procedure. It went well,

305
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:58,760
and he fell asleep as soon as he got to the room just a minute ago.

306
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:01,830
I'm glad.

307
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:06,640
You should have come tomorrow rather than run over tonight.

308
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,590
I was scared.

309
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:12,220
No one was home when I got there, and the front gate was open.

310
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:18,240
Still, I thought you'd be crying in a corner somewhere.

311
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:20,530
You're all grown up.

312
00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:25,970
Hey. I grew up long before you did.

313
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:29,280
It's late so you should head home.

314
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:32,890
I think Grandpa has to sleep some more.

315
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:36,290
Yes. I should go.

316
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:38,050
I will come back later.

317
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:39,510
Okay.

318
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,910
Thank you.

319
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,110
What? Didn't you leave?

320
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:39,250
I went home and came back.

321
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:42,610
I packed some things you might need. Goodnight.

322
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:46,840
Hey... Hey...

323
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,490
Jin Ji Won.

324
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:52,520
What?

325
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:57,330
Just... get home safely.

326
00:26:57,330 --> 00:27:01,000
What, that's it? I'm going now.

327
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:03,810
Hey.

328
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,490
What is it now?

329
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:10,840
Thank you.

330
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:17,800
It's nothing.

331
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:20,970
I'm going.

332
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:37,520
   

333
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,730
   

334
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:55,540
Eun Bi.

335
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:02,810
Kim Sung Hwan and Choi Jin Hyuk are on apprenticeship.

336
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:04,420
Gong Ki Joon isn't here today,

337
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:06,980
and Lee Jae Hyeok and Lee Jae Hee are at the nurse's office.

338
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:10,680
Okay. Let's start by stretching before we work out.

339
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:13,780
- Stretch, all of you. 
 - Okay.

340
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,050
Did something happen to Ki Joon?

341
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:22,920
Yes. His Grandpa's sick. They're at the hospital.

342
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:27,140
I see. Is Ki Joon taking care of him?

343
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:30,890
Hey, weren't the twins perfectly fine just a minute ago?

344
00:28:30,890 --> 00:28:32,480
Now they're both suddenly sick?

345
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,560
I hear twins often get sick together.

346
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,040
They have to be faking it.

347
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:38,380
- Are they? 
 - Eun Bi.

348
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:45,160
Hello.

349
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:53,860
I've told the students.

350
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:58,090
I hope you can take care of the matter, Mr. Lee Kang Hoon.

351
00:28:58,090 --> 00:28:59,950
Yes.

352
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:06,100
But what kind of people are Jae Hee and Jae Hyeok's parents?

353
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:08,800
You really are slow.

354
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:13,010
Our school is a private foundation.

355
00:29:13,010 --> 00:29:14,730
Yes.

356
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:22,480
Oh, is it Director Gu?

357
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:26,270
Aigoo. You got the answer to the hardest question.

358
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:30,890
They're Director Gu's niece and nephew.

359
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:36,630
Why do you keep calling me?

360
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:41,180
Eun Bi... tell me honestly.

361
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:44,290
How much did you borrow? For what?

362
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:49,240
How is a trainee supposed to get money?

363
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:51,830
I just bought things like this.

364
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:55,350
Do you want me to be looked down on by the other trainees?

365
00:29:55,350 --> 00:30:00,810
I don't know. I was going to debut and pay everyone back when I got paid.

366
00:30:00,810 --> 00:30:05,490
Geez. So that's why you worked part-time in that costume.

367
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,660
Then you can sell all those and pay people back.

368
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:12,740
Hey. I worked hard to get these.

369
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:15,220
Never mind. I'll work part-time to pay them back.

370
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:18,810
I have a plan for everything, so stay out of it.

371
00:30:18,810 --> 00:30:20,600
What part-time job?

372
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,880
I've already looked into it.

373
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:29,570
You know that I have a good sense of balance.

374
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:31,680
How about cleaning skyscrapers' windows?

375
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:35,900
No, no. That's too dangerous. And they won't let just anyone do it.

376
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:40,220
"Debt collection. Making deposits."

377
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:42,450
"At 150,000 to 300,000 won (~US$130–250) per case."

378
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:45,070
- That's voice phishing*. 
 - How do you know that? 
  (TN: telephone scams) 

379
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:47,640
Well... last year...

380
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,720
I called them to ask about it.

381
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:54,960
"We're like family. Based on skills, 7 million to 20 million won (~US$5,900–17,000) monthly."

382
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,250
"Standby starts at 6 p.m. near a subway station."

383
00:30:57,250 --> 00:30:59,590
"Available for pick up. Singing and dancing preferred."

384
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:02,150
- Eun Bi! 
 - What?

385
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:12,150
   

386
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:16,310
   

387
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:27,830
I can't believe my grandson is treating me like a baby in my old age.

388
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:30,710
Are you all right? You're not in pain, are you?

389
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:34,610
Not at all. I can't even tell I had surgery.

390
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:39,130
I feel like I could leave the hospital right now.

391
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:43,020
No way. The doctor said he has to monitor you for a few more days.

392
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:44,170
All right.

393
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:47,630
Anyhow, what do we do now you can't practice carpentry with me?

394
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:49,610
Does that matter right now, Grandpa?

395
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:52,810
He's right. You must think of your health first.

396
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:55,210
Don't worry about anything else.

397
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:59,760
Ki Joon and I were both so scared.

398
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:04,630
Why be scared? A little thing like this can't take me down.

399
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:08,210
It's only me in hospital.

400
00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:13,690
The workshop is just as I left it so you both practice, okay?

401
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:16,580
All right, we will.

402
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:29,430
Why did you call me here again? It's intimidating.

403
00:32:30,530 --> 00:32:33,120
I heard you borrowed money from people.

404
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:36,530
- Who told you that? 
 - I won't drag this out.

405
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:41,440
Sell everything you bought with the borrowed money. Sell them and repay everyone right away.

406
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,650
Hey, they were tough to get my hands on.

407
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:47,340
I didn't quit, okay?

408
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:50,730
You said to try again. I'm going to get into another entertainment company.

409
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:54,560
- Once I become a trainee again, I can debut— 
 - You...

410
00:32:58,890 --> 00:33:01,090
are radiant enough.

411
00:33:01,090 --> 00:33:02,350
What?

412
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:06,780
You're still radiant enough without luxury goods.

413
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:09,290
Don't lose the radiance you already have.

414
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:15,400
Your words suddenly sound so out of place...

415
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,350
Is it just me?

416
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:19,040
No, it's me, too.

417
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,640
What is it?

418
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:27,550
Ji Ho Sung. He said he couldn't get through to you and asked me to say these words to you.

419
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:32,470
He didn't want his precious star being ruined.

420
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:36,130
"A healthy and radiant star."

421
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:37,830
He said, that's you.

422
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:41,160
Gosh... so cheesy.

423
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:53,800
What? Are you moved by that, right now?

424
00:33:57,690 --> 00:34:00,840
You really have no empathy at all.

425
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:15,730
You...

426
00:34:18,930 --> 00:34:22,650
Eun Bi. Are you furious with me?

427
00:34:22,650 --> 00:34:24,090
You're pretty suave.

428
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:26,860
Sure, I know I was...

429
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:28,460
What?

430
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:30,800
Eun Bi...

431
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,200
I...

432
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:36,430
I'm going to change.

433
00:34:38,170 --> 00:34:42,080
So you mean, these things... Even without things like these,

434
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:46,950
I still... shine, right?

435
00:34:46,950 --> 00:34:49,760
Of course. You're my number one celebrity.

436
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:54,110
Let's sell all of these and begin again.

437
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:57,130
Okay. Good thinking, Eun Bi.

438
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,290
Here.

439
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,990
What? Who's selling them?

440
00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:09,380
Am I?

441
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:21,090
Oh, I see. That's what happened.

442
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:23,480
Yes.

443
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:29,250
I would really appreciate it if you could ask the owner.

444
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:32,030
Yes, yes. Thank you so much.

445
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:34,230
Yes, yes...

446
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,810
- Is it because of the house? 
 - Pardon?

447
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:45,160
We're in trouble.

448
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:49,360
The hospital bill was more than I expected.

449
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:53,140
Should I look for another house—

450
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:55,710
I have to take care of it.

451
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:59,110
Don't worry about these kinds of things and focus on school.

452
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,880
I got it, so rest.

453
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:06,940
They said you can't get stressed.

454
00:36:08,570 --> 00:36:10,480
Aigoo.

455
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:25,250

  (TN: 19th century composer) 

457

Jae Hee and Jae Hyeok aren't here again.

458
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,750
- I heard they went to the nurse's office again. 
 - Really?

459
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:55,190
They're only sick when they want to be.

460
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:58,320
But why are they always sick for Art and PE classes?

461
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,140
I'd be sick for Korean, English, or Math.

462
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:02,470
I know, right?

463
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:05,160
I would, seriously.

464
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:09,600
I need to go to the restroom.

465
00:37:18,890 --> 00:37:20,720
Jae Hyeok...

466
00:37:21,370 --> 00:37:24,180
What are you trying to learn?

467
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:27,090
I'll win first place.

I think you're the one in trouble.

472
00:37:59,850 --> 00:38:04,590
Is this what you meant when you said the earth is tilted?

473
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:07,190
I didn't know you'd show me this example.

474
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:11,290
Don't be so sensitive. They're not on your level.

475
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:16,830
Because they're so bad, I'm just teaching them a little more as their teacher.

476
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:20,940
This is how soft-hearted I am. Gosh, I have to change somehow...

477
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:23,380
Then I really hope you change,

478
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:26,400
or I'll petition the Ministry of Education and the Blue House.

479
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:30,710
Wow, students will post just about anything.

480
00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:37,130
The extra instruction is wasted on those guys. It's no use for them.

481
00:38:37,130 --> 00:38:39,630
Please be clear with me.

482
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:41,900
It sounds like you'll continue doing this.

483
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:45,780
All right. I won't do it.

484
00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:48,200
I won't.

485
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:09,140
Well...

486
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:14,000
I don't think I'll be able to teach Jae Hee and Jae Hyeok outside of classes.

487
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,690
I heard everything from Jae Hyeok.

488
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:20,830
Oh, I see.

489
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:25,110
What will you achieve if you quit simply because one person complains?

490
00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:31,650
More importantly... I hear the head judge for the carpentry competition this year

491
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:33,560
is your university sunbae.

492
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:36,330
Yes, I noticed that.

493
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:39,680
- Go ahead. 
 - Oh, okay.

494
00:39:45,570 --> 00:39:48,220
Why don't you meet him and get a sense of things?

495
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:49,690
Sorry?

496
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:55,440
I haven't seen him in a while.

497
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,300
Good.

498
00:39:57,300 --> 00:40:00,300
You can say you want to catch up after all this time.

499
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:04,810
Ask him for his business card. We want to give him a call.

500
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:09,230
If you need his number, I can give that to you now.

501
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:12,350
You know that's not what I mean.

502
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:17,030
If he knows what we mean, he'll give his response by providing his business card.

503
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:26,980
But that hyung is pretty narrow minded. I'm not sure it'll work out.

504
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:29,160
If it doesn't work, make it work.

505
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:32,370
"If something doesn't work, it's because you didn't try hard enough."

506
00:40:32,370 --> 00:40:37,420
I live by these words. I know you're the same, Mr. Lee.

507
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:44,620
M-Me?

508
00:40:47,870 --> 00:40:53,680
I suppose after playing it big, a small task like this doesn't satisfy you.

509
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:00,400
 But that's a bad thing to do. 

510
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,890
Come on. Not all lies are bad.

511
00:41:03,890 --> 00:41:05,290
There are good lies, too.

512
00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:06,910
"Good lies"?

513
00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:11,900
Listen. If we told Mom you ate a hamburger, she would be upset, right?

514
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:13,420
If Mom is upset,

515
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:15,980
- you'll be upset too, right? 
 - Yes.

516
00:41:17,390 --> 00:41:22,260
So if Mom asks you, "What did you have for dinner?"

517
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:23,960
don't say, "A hamburger."

518
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:26,780
Say, "We ate something yummy." Okay?

519
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:28,480
Okay.

520
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:32,380
Then the hamburger is a secret, okay?

521
00:41:36,090 --> 00:41:38,220
Ah Reum!

522
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:40,040
Mom!

523
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:49,150
What secret?

524
00:41:57,790 --> 00:42:01,100
Where did Ah Reum go?

525
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:02,770
Right here!

526
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:06,360
I got you right in my hands!

527
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:08,030
Ta-da!

528
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:09,790
What do you want to do now, Ah Reum?

529
00:42:09,790 --> 00:42:11,830
Well, I want to do that, Dad.

530
00:42:11,830 --> 00:42:13,580
That one? Okay.

531
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:15,820
Have fun.

532
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:20,630
Geez.

533
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:23,580
How can you let her eat fast food every day?

534
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:27,580
Fine, I'll feed her lots of good food.

535
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:30,710
Is Mother-in-law okay?

536
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:34,550
I think she's getting worse after Dad passed away.

537
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:40,080
Mother-in-law and Father-in-law had a really great relationship.

538
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:43,420
The audacity.

539
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:45,790
You still call her "Mother-in-law"?

540
00:42:45,790 --> 00:42:48,900
What then? Should I call her "ahjumma"?

541
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:53,360
How are the carpentry-class students? Are they doing well?

542
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:56,160
Geez, it's a whole mess.

543
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,910
Kang Seo Young works too hard.

544
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:01,530
And Gong Ki Joon, he's a complete beginner.

545
00:43:01,530 --> 00:43:03,310
And the twins are...

546
00:43:03,310 --> 00:43:06,100
Aigoo, I have a lot to say, but...

547
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:07,500
I won't say them.

548
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:10,280
But Jin Ji Won.

549
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:13,300
Jin Ji Won is pretty good.

550
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:17,230
Ji Won came to our school to become a carpenter in the first place.

551
00:43:17,230 --> 00:43:19,810
What about Young Joo? He should be good.

552
00:43:19,810 --> 00:43:23,510
He won a carpentry-competition award even before coming to our school.

553
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:25,930
I think his dad was a carpenter too.

554
00:43:25,930 --> 00:43:28,430
I see.

555
00:43:28,430 --> 00:43:30,730
No wonder. That's why he is rather good.

556
00:43:30,730 --> 00:43:32,590
Dad!

557
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,020
Hey!

558
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:41,890
So I guess you're somewhat of a teacher.

559
00:43:41,890 --> 00:43:44,030
I thought you would slack off.

560
00:43:44,030 --> 00:43:46,160
You're pretty interested in the students.

561
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:49,520
I'm not interested. Geez, I don't know. I just want it to be over already.

562
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:53,100
I'm suffering big time because of that Kang Seo Young.

563
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:57,110
And why is she so persistent?

564
00:43:57,110 --> 00:43:59,390
I can understand her.

565
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:02,450
You have to help her.

566
00:44:02,450 --> 00:44:04,970
- I heard Seo Young and Young Joo are in the same group. 
 - Yes.

567
00:44:04,970 --> 00:44:07,930
Doesn't that team have a chance of winning?

568
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:14,110
I don't know. We'll have to watch what happens.

569
00:44:20,470 --> 00:44:24,120
Are you coming back to school tomorrow?

570
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:25,860
Yes.

571
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:30,020
If I miss more school, I think Grandpa will get really angry.

572
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:34,170
Besides, I have some things I need to do outside.

573
00:44:34,170 --> 00:44:35,700
What things?

574
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:38,210
Have you ever been to a real estate office?

575
00:44:38,210 --> 00:44:39,910
Of course.

576
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:42,630
Really?

577
00:44:42,630 --> 00:44:44,200
Yes.

578
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:47,520
My dream in September of the 10th grade was to be a realtor.

579
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:51,240
I went to a lot of real estate offices back then.

580
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:53,620
Why real estate all of a sudden?

581
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:58,770
You need to help me.

582
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:03,930
Mom, I'm going to school.

583
00:45:03,930 --> 00:45:08,510
Son! Come home early. I'll have delicious food ready.

584
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:13,270
- Be back soon. 
 - All right. See you!

585
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:18,480
Oh, Seo Young!

586
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:21,080
You have a package.

587
00:45:22,950 --> 00:45:26,920
M-Motorcycle... gloves?

588
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:28,840
Are these yours?

589
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:31,570
No, it's a gift.

590
00:45:31,570 --> 00:45:34,000
Oh, really?

591
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,600
The one in your profile picture?

592
00:45:38,670 --> 00:45:40,220
Yes.

593
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:44,610
 Well, maybe it's a good time to return it to him. 

594
00:45:44,610 --> 00:45:46,550
 "A good time"? 

595
00:45:46,550 --> 00:45:50,080
 It's Young Joo's birthday soon. 

596
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,780
 Didn't you know? 

597
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:54,660
 No. 

598
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:56,920
 I thought you would know. 

599
00:45:58,310 --> 00:46:00,640
 You should do something for him. 

600
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:02,430
 You're his girlfriend. 

601
00:46:07,570 --> 00:46:10,060
It's his birthday today.

602
00:46:10,690 --> 00:46:12,900
Oh, my.

603
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:16,730
You'll give it him just like this, won't you?

604
00:46:16,730 --> 00:46:17,650
How else would I?

605
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:21,190
Aigoo, you're hopeless.

606
00:46:21,190 --> 00:46:23,360
You still have time, right?

607
00:46:23,910 --> 00:46:25,970
Sister Director!

608
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:40,180
Long time no see.

609
00:46:40,910 --> 00:46:42,670
Didn't you miss me?

610
00:46:44,090 --> 00:46:47,320
Life must be pretty good if you're coming up with such nonsense.

611
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:49,810
Why does that sound like you were worried about me?

612
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:52,830
Happy birthday.

613
00:46:53,530 --> 00:46:55,630
I wanted to do something for you,

614
00:46:55,630 --> 00:46:57,950
but I'm kind of frazzled these days.

615
00:46:57,950 --> 00:46:59,360
Sorry.

616
00:47:01,770 --> 00:47:05,320
Don't get distracted by useless things and prepare for the competition.

617
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:09,280
Don't hurt Ji Won's chances.

618
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:21,540
What is this?

619
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:29,090
I scanned everywhere, starting from my neighborhood.

620
00:47:29,090 --> 00:47:30,980
Did you already go to this many places?

621
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:33,000
Try calling this number for now.

622
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,030
Let's take a look after school together.

623
00:47:35,030 --> 00:47:37,220
Oh, okay.

624
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,090
Thank you.

625
00:47:41,930 --> 00:47:43,870
Punk.

626
00:47:43,870 --> 00:47:45,610
Don't mention it.

627
00:48:16,890 --> 00:48:19,840
 I'd like to see the place too, please. 

628
00:48:50,770 --> 00:48:52,850
What are you doing?

629
00:48:56,290 --> 00:48:57,700
Sorry.

630
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:02,640
Will you say sorry after causing an accident too?

631
00:49:03,650 --> 00:49:08,480
Hey, it's okay. He has a lot on his mind lately.

632
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:15,810
If you have your mind on something else, don't use the tool.

633
00:49:27,310 --> 00:49:29,000
What's going on with you?

634
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,340
Did something happen again? Is it because of Grandpa?

635
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:35,480
I can't do this.

636
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:37,280
I'll get going.

637
00:49:56,080 --> 00:50:00,010
This will take some getting used to. You're a teacher?

638
00:50:02,110 --> 00:50:04,110
So anyway...

639
00:50:04,110 --> 00:50:08,120
Will you be bringing your students to our department's carpentry competition?

640
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:09,270
Yes.

641
00:50:09,270 --> 00:50:12,520
Well, that's how it turned out.

642
00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:16,950
Hyung.

643
00:50:16,950 --> 00:50:19,180
So about that...

644
00:50:21,870 --> 00:50:23,680
   

645
00:50:25,050 --> 00:50:28,010
He said he would really like to meet you.

646
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:32,880
He asked for your business card.

647
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:50,490
He will be meeting with him just about now.

648
00:50:50,490 --> 00:50:52,570
He'll get the message across.

649
00:50:52,570 --> 00:50:55,780
I think he has some sense in him.

650
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:10,540
Well then. I'll let them know.

651
00:51:10,540 --> 00:51:13,190
Sure. See you around.

652
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:15,860
Hey.

653
00:51:16,390 --> 00:51:18,090
You know,

654
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:22,540
I'm beginning to get confused about you.

655
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:41,180
   

656
00:51:43,590 --> 00:51:45,140
   

657
00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:47,520
Yes, what?

658
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:49,730
 Earlier, you left abruptly. 

659
00:51:49,730 --> 00:51:51,480
Where are you? The hospital?

660
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:52,400
Yes.

661
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:55,210
 Nothing is wrong, is it? 

662
00:51:55,210 --> 00:51:56,790
No.

663
00:51:56,790 --> 00:51:58,390
Hey...

664
00:52:00,230 --> 00:52:02,740
My heart feels like it's going to explode.

665
00:52:03,990 --> 00:52:05,770
Is Ho Sung with you?

666
00:52:05,770 --> 00:52:08,710
Listen, I'm busy. I'm hanging up.

667
00:52:08,710 --> 00:52:10,260
Hey!

668
00:52:14,550 --> 00:52:16,280
Is it Ji Won?

669
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:18,310
Yes.

670
00:52:18,310 --> 00:52:20,700
Hey, so...

671
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:25,190
Are you sure you want a place this high up with your sick Grandpa?

672
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:29,890
This isn't it.

673
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:39,180
Let's go.

674
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:42,380
Go where...

675
00:52:42,380 --> 00:52:43,860
Where?

676
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:46,890
What's he up to?

677
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:51,260
 I can't do this. I'll get going. 

678
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:08,040
I can't walk you to the bus stop today.

679
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:11,560
I have to get home early.

680
00:53:15,220 --> 00:53:16,630
Oh, okay.

681
00:53:18,350 --> 00:53:20,250
See you tomorrow.

682
00:53:22,190 --> 00:53:23,990
Hey...

683
00:53:27,170 --> 00:53:28,790
What?

684
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:50,430
What's this?

685
00:53:51,050 --> 00:53:53,010
It's your birthday.

686
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:56,250
Oh. My birthday.

687
00:53:56,250 --> 00:53:58,080
How did you know?

688
00:53:58,750 --> 00:54:02,480
I should know that if I'm pretending to be your girlfriend.

689
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:05,680
Oh. I guess so.

690
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:10,280
When's your birthday?

691
00:54:10,940 --> 00:54:13,510
I don't know when it is.

692
00:54:16,590 --> 00:54:20,470
You'll need those so use them well. Post a picture of them, okay?

693
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:26,990
Okay. Anyway, thanks.

694
00:54:41,190 --> 00:54:45,020
 "Where are you? Can I visit Grandpa later?" 

695
00:54:58,160 --> 00:54:59,800
Aigoo.

696
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:08,020
Hello, I go to your diner often.

697
00:55:08,020 --> 00:55:12,150
Of course, I know you. The jjolmyeon lover. You're in Young Joo's class, right

698
00:55:12,150 --> 00:55:15,240
So you know. Yes, that's right.

699
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:21,630
What are you looking for?

700
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:30,010
Can I get you what you need?

701
00:55:30,010 --> 00:55:32,430
Do you have something like a cake?

702
00:55:32,430 --> 00:55:34,260
The bakery is closed.

703
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:37,910
Of course. Convenience stores have everything these days.

704
00:55:37,910 --> 00:55:40,520
Which one? Strawberry or chocolate?

705
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:44,280
- Maybe strawberry? 
 - We have candles too. Would you like them as well?

706
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:48,050
Perfect. Eighteen, please.

707
00:55:48,710 --> 00:55:50,930
Is it Young Joo's birthday?

708
00:55:59,410 --> 00:56:01,170
One second.

709
00:56:07,140 --> 00:56:10,430
Can you get this to him? It's a present from me.

710
00:56:13,050 --> 00:56:15,480
Young Joo will like that.

711
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:33,380
 When's your birthday? 

712
00:56:33,380 --> 00:56:35,660
 I don't know when it is. 

713
00:56:37,250 --> 00:56:40,150
 Jung Young Joo! Hurry and come out! 

714
00:56:40,150 --> 00:56:42,070
All right.

715
00:56:53,860 --> 00:56:57,380
Here, a birthday present, my son.

716
00:56:57,380 --> 00:56:58,750
Thank you.

717
00:56:58,750 --> 00:57:01,700
I ordered mine online. It's coming tomorrow.

718
00:57:01,700 --> 00:57:05,220
Why do you always go out of your way? Thanks.

719
00:57:05,220 --> 00:57:06,940
Oh, right.

720
00:57:07,780 --> 00:57:09,920
Here. This is from your friend.

721
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:11,730
She said it's a birthday present.

722
00:57:11,730 --> 00:57:15,830
And that friend... she's a girl.

723
00:57:15,830 --> 00:57:17,630
A friend who's a girl is...

724
00:57:17,630 --> 00:57:20,300
Oh, a girlfriend?

725
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:22,820
Friend wh-who?

726
00:57:22,820 --> 00:57:24,770
What is her name again?

727
00:57:24,770 --> 00:57:26,150
She's often at our diner.

728
00:57:26,150 --> 00:57:29,790
She works at the convenience store at Joongangro—

729
00:57:31,270 --> 00:57:34,150
Did she say it was for me?

730
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:49,690
- Good night. 
 - Good work today.

731
00:57:50,830 --> 00:57:53,300
   

732
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:57,730
Seriously. What's going on? 
  Where are you? Can I visit Grandpa later? 

733
00:58:03,450 --> 00:58:05,990
-  Hello?  
 - Hey, Ho Sung.

734
00:58:05,990 --> 00:58:08,370
Is something going on with Ki Joon?

735
00:58:22,430 --> 00:58:25,850
 My brother delivered it to me. 

736
00:58:29,650 --> 00:58:32,580
 I'll enjoy them. 

737
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:38,440
 Thank you for the present. 

738
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:50,750
Grandpa, stop being like that and just take a look.

739
00:58:50,750 --> 00:58:52,280
How about this place?

740
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:55,520
It's on a hill, but it's clean inside.

741
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:58,880
And here, it's easy to access, but the bathroom is outside.

742
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:01,280
Ki Joon.

743
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:04,780
I told you to go to school, and this is how you spend your time?

744
00:59:04,780 --> 00:59:08,720
- I did go to school. 
 - I said I'll take care of it.

745
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:10,740
Will you keep distressing me like this?

746
00:59:10,740 --> 00:59:13,480
That's not it, I—

747
00:59:26,380 --> 00:59:28,810
Oh, hello.

748
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:01,630
   

749
01:00:01,630 --> 01:00:03,790
   

750
01:00:15,710 --> 01:00:19,180
 I don't think I should tell you this, but... 

751
01:00:19,180 --> 01:00:23,850
 Ki Joon and his grandpa have to look for a new place again because of the hospital bill. 

752
01:00:23,850 --> 01:00:26,000
 The moving date is set, 

753
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:29,590
 but there's no time. So Ki Joon is looking around for a place. 

754
01:00:29,590 --> 01:00:32,930
 But none of the places seem right. 

755
01:00:32,930 --> 01:00:34,590
I heard what happened.

756
01:00:34,590 --> 01:00:36,780
You're searching for housing, right?

757
01:00:39,490 --> 01:00:41,790
Gosh, that Ji Ho Sung...

758
01:00:41,790 --> 01:00:44,670
Why didn't you tell me?

759
01:00:44,670 --> 01:00:45,980
What could you do?

760
01:00:45,980 --> 01:00:47,510
We could worry together.

761
01:00:47,510 --> 01:00:49,310
Why would you worry about it too?

762
01:00:52,350 --> 01:00:54,260
Don't poke your nose where you shouldn't,

763
01:00:54,260 --> 01:00:55,990
and focus on the competition.

764
01:00:55,990 --> 01:00:59,910
Hey, can't you tell the difference between poking-my-nose-in and worrying?

765
01:01:03,510 --> 01:01:05,720
Enough.

766
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:07,430
It's my problem.

767
01:01:12,190 --> 01:01:14,590
There's a room at my house.

768
01:01:17,490 --> 01:01:19,010
What?

769
01:01:22,250 --> 01:01:24,820
There's a room available at my house.

770
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:31,400
Do you want to move into my house?

771
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:39,330


772
01:01:39,330 --> 01:01:46,670
♫  Dream on, dream on, dream on  ♫

773
01:01:47,790 --> 01:01:55,080
♫  Dream on, dream on, dream on  ♫

774
01:01:55,080 --> 01:02:00,630
♫  My heart keeps thinking of you  ♫

775
01:02:00,630 --> 01:02:04,870
♫  I can't even understand myself  ♫

776
01:02:04,870 --> 01:02:10,520
♫  I'm always curious about you  ♫

777
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:12,710
♫  I dream of meeting you  ♫

778
01:02:12,710 --> 01:02:18,240
♫  Dream on, dream on, dream on  ♫

779
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:21,050
♫  I'm dreaming right now  ♫

780
01:02:21,050 --> 01:02:26,040
♫  Dream on, dream on, dream on  ♫

781
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:31,570
♫  I'll grow closer to you  ♫

782
01:02:31,570 --> 01:02:34,860
   

783
01:02:34,860 --> 01:02:36,870
 When do you start moving on Saturday? 

784
01:02:36,870 --> 01:02:38,750
 Is this the time to worry about your ego? 

785
01:02:38,750 --> 01:02:40,870
 Just think of Grandpa. 

786
01:02:40,870 --> 01:02:44,160
 - Thank you for the gift. 
 - It was nothing. 

787
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:47,010
 Are you using what I gave you? 

788
01:02:47,010 --> 01:02:49,430
 You did relay the message correctly, right? 

789
01:02:49,430 --> 01:02:53,010
 You haven't heard why I quit my job as a supervisor, have you? 

790
01:02:53,010 --> 01:02:55,240
 - It's finally tomorrow. 
 - It's all thanks to you. 

791
01:02:55,240 --> 01:02:57,210
 What in the world? I'm not used to this. 

792
01:02:57,210 --> 01:03:01,300
 The flowerpot incident. Did you really do it? 

793
01:03:01,300 --> 01:03:03,350
 Which university is it? 

794
01:03:03,350 --> 01:03:07,570
♫  My heart keeps thinking of you  ♫
