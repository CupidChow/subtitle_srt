1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,650
   

2
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:09,100
   

3
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:11,990
   

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,960
   

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,100
   

6
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:21,190
   

7
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:33,400
   

8
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:41,980


9
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,640
It's you.

10
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,860
You're the person I feel sincerely about.

11
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:18,100
   

12
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:20,360
Oh...

13
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,810
Oh...

14
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,410
Oh, no.

15
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:30,250
Sorry. I really had no idea.

16
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:33,630
It's really annoying of me to say that I didn't know,

17
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:36,330
but I'm really sorry.

18
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:42,120
I didn't say that to make you feel bad.

19
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:48,570
I think I was too comfortable with you and didn't pick up the hints.

20
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:52,510
Don't be uncomfortable, though.

21
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:55,580
Is that a difficult thing to ask for?

22
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:02,880
Don't feel sorry,

23
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,410
and don't feel uncomfortable either.

24
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:07,660
Please just think about it once.

25
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:11,780
Can you do that?

26
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,070
O-Okay.

27
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,600
I will.

28
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,260
I think your phone is buzzing.

29
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:25,080
Wh-What?

30
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:34,190
 I can't come today. Sorry. 

31
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:38,010
Geez.

32
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:06,850
 Jung Young Joo: Did you get home safe? 

33
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:09,380
 I'm sorry. I didn't mean to pressure you. 

34
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:11,270
 Goodnight. 

35
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,400
Hey.

36
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:48,640
Why didn't you come along earlier?

37
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,280
Mr. Lee said you were coming to help.

38
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:53,890
Why would you need me?

39
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:55,610
I'd only get in the way.

40
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,010
Hey.

41
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:59,320
Still, it's your idea.

42
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:03,930
I worked on it with Young Joo and submitted it.

43
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,700
Good.

44
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,400
I can go now, right?

45
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,080
Pardon?

46
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:15,880
Sure.

47
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:27,200
What's up with him?

48
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:32,220
I'm going crazy.

49
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,040
 It's you. 

50
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:47,880
 You're the person I feel sincerely about. 

51
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:05,220
 She didn't say that she liked him, did she? 

52
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,670
 No way. 

53
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:09,640
 It's only been a few days since she said she likes me. 

54
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,810
 She rejected him, right? 

55
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:14,560
Geez.

56
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,270
Whatever. I'll just not think about it.

57
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,890
What are you doing?

58
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:21,650
- Do you need help? 
 - What?

59
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:25,130
Oh, it's nothing. I'm almost done.

60
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,390
Grandpa.

61
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:39,670
Where did you get this cutting board?

62
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:43,890
Ji Won made it and gave it to me.

63
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:59,750
Good work.

64
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,840
Have this.

65
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,660
Is it already tangerine season?

66
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,080
When did you buy them?

67
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:10,030
Well, Ji Won brought a bag full earlier.

68
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:15,740
Oh, this is also from Ji Won.

69
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,970
Did you lend her some clothes?

70
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,450
Ki Joon,

71
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:24,830
can you pass me that back scratcher over there?

72
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:32,710
Oh, this?

73
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:35,920
Ji Won made this for me too.

74
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:41,730
Ki Joon...

75
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:44,850
They're selecting a new head of security at my apartment complex.

76
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:46,920
Should I apply* ? 
  (TN: "Apply" in Korean is pronounced "ji won") 

77
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,370
Stop.

78
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:50,020
Stop, Grandpa. Stop!

79
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,980
- Stop. 
 - I shouldn't?

80
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:53,750
From now on,

81
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:56,680
I'm banning the word "ji won" in our house.

82
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,980
It's banned.

83
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:00,020
"Ji Won" is banned.

84
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,490
Hey.

85
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:04,630
What's up with you?

86
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:06,680
Shouldn't I apply?

87
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,900
You should "try," Grandpa, not "apply."

88
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:16,730
Good work today.

89
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:19,060
- Bye now. 
 - Where should we go?

90
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:21,020
Let's go.

91
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,510
Good work today.

92
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:24,480
Hyungnim!

93
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,980
Hey.

94
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:32,260
   

95
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:36,550
So aren't you working in this field anymore?

96
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:38,380
Does teaching suit you?

97
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:41,540
Seriously, who cares if it suits me.

98
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,820
I'm just doing it.

99
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:46,840
All right.

100
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:58,300
Hyungnim, by any chance,

101
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:01,910
did Sang Rim reach out to you?

102
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:04,480
- Sang Rim? 
 - Yes.

103
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:09,610
I quit working there

104
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:11,630
not long after you left, Chief Lee.

105
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:13,680
They haven't contacted me since then.

106
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,030
Why?

107
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:19,400
Recently... I met Cheol Joo.

108
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,260
Do you remember him?

109
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:24,010
He was injured when he was an apprentice.

110
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:26,700
Of course, I remember.

111
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:29,810
That accident was why I quit.

112
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:31,470
Was it?

113
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:35,150
That jerk, the on-site manager, put so much pressure on me.

114
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:37,990
The high-altitude maintenance lift that Cheol Joo was on,

115
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:40,940
It wasn't in good shape so no one wanted to get on it.

116
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:43,410
After Cheol Joo fell,

117
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:47,270
they were worried we might testify against them,

118
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:50,250
and they threw a crazy fit.

119
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,010
Geez.

120
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:55,470
I'm not one to lie.

121
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:59,280
And I couldn't really take Cheol Joo's side, so I quit.

122
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:04,940
I was blacklisted then and now I can't do any work with Sang Rim.

123
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:09,500
Sang Rim has the most constructions around here.

124
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,550
Cheol Joo...

125
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,950
is in a wheelchair,

126
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:25,520
and his trial with Sang Rim is still ongoing.

127
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:31,020
So what are you going to do? Step forward?

128
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,170
I don't really know, to be honest.

129
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:38,180
Where I work happens to be a Sang Rim foundation school.

130
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:42,670
Really. Why are things so complicated?

131
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:48,790
There isn't any evidence or anything that can help, is there?

132
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:52,160
I think the company got rid of the report I submitted.

133
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,780
Gosh. Of course, they did.

134
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:05,430
You remember back then,

135
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:09,710
the supervisor was slow and frustrating at his work,

136
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:12,190
so you sent texts to the manager directly.

137
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:17,140
Did you send him anything about the high-altitude work?

138
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,430
I did.

139
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:24,100
I think I did.

140
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,290
They should be on my old phone.

141
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:29,200
Then you can check that.

142
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:33,340
But my old phone...

143
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:41,100
 - Thank you, goodbye. 
 - Bye. 

144
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:48,480
 Go inside. 

145
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:53,090
 It's my wife! 

146
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:54,940
 Honey. 

147
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:56,750
 Look. 

148
00:10:56,750 --> 00:11:01,780
 I've been calling people at my company and on-site all day, 

149
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:06,070
 but no one is picking up. 

150
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:12,220
 Oh, right. I should call Deputy Jo's wife. 

151
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:14,710
 Just stop it. 

152
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,280
 Stop what? 

153
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:27,440
 They're saying I was bribed. 

154
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,480
 But these people... 

155
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:33,480
 they all know that I wasn't. 

156
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,870
 They know, so why— 

157
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:37,000
 That's why I said not to get involved. 

158
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,890
 It's not like I did anything wrong. 

159
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:43,510
 I only did it because those people asked me to help them. So— 

160
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:46,890
 Why am I the one getting fired? 

161
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:48,480
 When did I accept a bribe? 

162
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,610
 Minding other people's business can be a sin. 

163
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:53,160
 It's a sin to pretend to be the hero 

164
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:56,160
 and pretend you have skills when you don't. 

165
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,320
 Is that everything you have to say? 

166
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:15,330
 Please pick up. 

167
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:20,780
 Someone just say something, you— 

168
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:34,570
The old phone?

169
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:38,960
The one you threw and broke?

170
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:43,500
Yes. What did we do after I threw it? Did we just throw it away?

171
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,110
I'm not sure.

172
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:46,910
Why?

173
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:49,140
I caught up with Man Soo,

174
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:52,670
and I remembered sending texts to Manager Gu Byeong Chul.

175
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:54,600
I think I said that the lift Cheol Joo was on

176
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,620
when he had the accident needed to be exchanged.

177
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:00,230
Is this because of Cheol Joo's trial?

178
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:05,990
No, I was just wondering.

179
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:11,510
Do you even know how you got a job at our school?

180
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:14,050
What do you mean?

181
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:16,730
The person who was here before you,

182
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:18,520
Mr. Kim Moo Kyung,

183
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,130
was Cheol Joo's homeroom teacher when he had the accident.

184
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:23,710
He did a lot to take Cheol Joo's side.

185
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:26,240
- Really? 
 - And now you're here,

186
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,110
but he's gone.

187
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:33,260
Do you mean that he was fired?

188
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:35,510
- For taking Cheol Joo's side? 
 - I—

189
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:39,460
I don't want to be a bad person to you again.

190
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:43,430
I hope you can keep the promise you made when we divorced.

191
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,440
You said you'd be happy solely as Ah Reum's dad.

192
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:49,740
Mom!

193
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:25,100
Ji Won.

194
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,380
What?

195
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:28,170
Didn't you bring an umbrella?

196
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:29,630
No.

197
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,360
Thanks.

198
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:39,060
I'll just walk with you to the classroom.

199
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,730
Let's go.

200
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:43,360
Why didn't you bring an umbrella when it's pouring like this?

201
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,080
I know, right?

202
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:48,510
Why is it suddenly raining so much?

203
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:52,990
It has to stop soon, right?

204
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:54,850
Thank you so much.

205
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:12,450
Why do you always only focus on the here and now?

206
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:16,360
What?

207
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:19,860
Check on the weather and pack your umbrella.

208
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,800
Can't you even do things like that?

209
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,940
Why are you picking a fight? It's only morning.

210
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:32,020
What's this?

211
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:34,090
Try to be prepared.

212
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,900
   

213
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:42,250
Don't be a burden to others.

214
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:58,160
 What's he doing? He's confusing me. 

215
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:05,690
Let's go, Eun Bi.

216
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:14,970
I have no appetite.

217
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:18,110
Come on. You still have to eat.

218
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:20,810
Eat well and get your strength. Then we can go somewhere better.

219
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:22,220
Here.

220
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,800
- What are you doing? 
 - You don't eat carrots.

221
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,810
I'll take the peas out too.

222
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,890
What is it?

223
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:57,450
Did you see me grab a piece of meat, too?

224
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:59,010
What?

225
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:04,070
See? You look much prettier when you smile.

226
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:05,560
Eat up.

227
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:11,770
All right, Eun Bi, I took out all the carrots.

228
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:13,860
Enjoy your lunch.

229
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:20,080
Hold on.

230
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,820
Here. This is dessert. 
    

231
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:26,860
What's up with the bubblegum?

232
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:28,580
Thank you.

233
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:31,670
Hey.

234
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:34,780
 And now, today's last story and song request. 

235
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:40,090
 It's been a while since 12th-grader Choi Tae Kang in the Machinery Department sent a story. 

236
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:43,680
 "Seo Young, I want to be your boyfriend."  

237
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:46,310
 "I'm so hungry for your love." 

238
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:49,980
 And he requested "Boy in Luv" by BTS. 

239
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:53,110
 Then with Choi Tae Kang's song request, 

240
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:55,490
 we end the lunch broadcast today. 

241
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:58,070
 I hope you power through the afternoon classes. 

242
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:00,420
 I'm Kwon Hye Mi broadcasting at NJBS, Nulji, 

243
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:03,670
 reaching everyone across the globe. 

244
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:18,890
What are you doing?

245
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:23,670
It's a surprise event.

246
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,140
Seo Young...

247
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:32,010
Please consider me.

248
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:34,250
I heard you broke up with that guy.

249
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,700
Well?

250
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,560
I said, "No."

251
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,840
Seo Young.

252
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,830
What's this?

253
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:48,020
She said "No."

254
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:49,620
What are you to her?

255
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:51,560
I heard things were over between you two.

256
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:54,470
Right, Seo Young? You ended things with him, didn't you?

257
00:18:58,110 --> 00:18:59,620
Move.

258
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:06,540
This is your last warning.

259
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:08,070
Stop it.

260
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:09,630
Got it?

261
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:15,950
Hey!

262
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:17,930
Why do you keep talking down to me?

263
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:19,550
Why?

264
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:21,250
Kang Seo Young!

265
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:26,070
What?

266
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:28,100
Are you okay?

267
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,480
Yes. I'm fine.

268
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:34,270
You don't have to step in from now on.

269
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:36,190
Don't worry about it.

270
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:51,000
Young Joo still seems to care about Seo Young.

271
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,100
I don't think Kang Seo Young cares about him at all, though.

272
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,490
Why does he keep pining for Kang Seo Young?

273
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:57,950
He's a fool.

274
00:19:57,950 --> 00:19:59,390
Poor Young Joo.

275
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:01,750
We should treat him nicely in the club.

276
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:03,210
What?

277
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:05,100
Oh-oh, r-right.

278
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:07,140
Let's do that.

279
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:15,750
All right. Have you all taken a look at the blueprint?

280
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,150
 Yes. 

281
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:18,850
It looks simple.

282
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:20,440
Really?

283
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,450
I'm looking forward to making it.

284
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:27,810
First, we'll drill five differently sized holes here, today,

285
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:31,140
and we'll create a slot for the phone to fit into.

286
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:33,230
We'll use this drill to make the holes.

287
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:36,630
Before then, mark on this wood with a pencil...

288
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:38,820
You can draw more firmly with pencils.

289
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,000
Okay.

290
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,710
♫  The whole world is white  ♫

291
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:46,410
♫  Why do you stand out?  ♫

292
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:51,970
♫  Like a petal in spring tinged yellow  ♫

293
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:56,130
♫  You're so beautiful to my eyes  ♫

294
00:20:56,130 --> 00:21:03,950
♫  When you approach me and whisper carefully again  ♫

295
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:14,610
♫  I think the time I spend with you will be filled with happiness  ♫

296
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:17,860
♫  Where are you?  ♫

297
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:21,350
Hold it.

298
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:25,630
♫  A cold wind blows  ♫

299
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:34,300
♫  Can you notice my cold fingers and embrace me gently?  ♫

300
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:36,770
♫  Where are you going?  ♫

301
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:40,950
♫  The winter flower flutters  ♫

302
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:43,120
♫  I wait for the warm spring  ♫

303
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,280
You...

304
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,830
Since when have you practiced carpentry?

305
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:51,600
The last competition was my first time.

306
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,320
- Really? 
 - Yes.

307
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,800
♫  Oh, my love  ♫

308
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:00,330
♫  Yes  ♫

309
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:13,570
Ah Reum,

310
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:16,110
did you have fun with Mom today?

311
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:19,260
It was ordinary.

312
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:27,490
Thank you as always.

313
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:29,550
You must also be busy taking care of your mom.

314
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:31,610
It's fine.

315
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:34,650
Are the students in the club doing well?

316
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:37,230
They're much better than when they first started.

317
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:39,660
They're passionate too.

318
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:42,110
It looks like you enjoy it, too, now.

319
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,430
"Enjoy"?

320
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:46,590
Geez. Those little rascals.

321
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:47,940
Oh, right.

322
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,940
About Gong Ki Joon.

323
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:52,160
Ki Joon? Why?

324
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,250
Didn't you say he used to do sports?

325
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:58,180
Yes. He recently quit taekwondo.

326
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:02,320
Ki Joon's having trouble keeping up, right?

327
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,090
No.

328
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:06,020
He's a fast learner.

329
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:07,570
I was surprised.

330
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:09,490
Really?

331
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:12,990
Anyway, he's a unique case.

332
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:17,080
   

333
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:23,720
 Seo Young. 

334
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,800
 What's this? 

335
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:58,710
You're Young Joo's girlfriend, right?

336
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:04,930
Hello.

337
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,010
Here.

338
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:17,780
Eat up.

339
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:19,900
You must be hungry.

340
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:22,120
Thank you.

341
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,030
You should come by more often.

342
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:29,100
I got so curious when I heard that my son had a girlfriend.

343
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,650
We broke up.

344
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:36,430
What?

345
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,920
I see.

346
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:45,690
I made a mistake.

347
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:47,470
It's all right.

348
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:51,410
Well, people break up and get back together at your age.

349
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:53,880
That's how things are, right?

350
00:24:55,850 --> 00:24:58,170
Come here.

351
00:24:58,170 --> 00:25:00,410
Come here.

352
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:04,250
- Enjoy. Take your time. 
 - Okay.

353
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:26,550
   

354
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:37,660
   

355
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:43,910
   

356
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:59,060
   

357
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:08,770
   

358
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:22,200
   

359
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:48,210
   

360
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,300
Are you leaving?

361
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:02,690
Yes.

362
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:03,850
I'm home.

363
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:05,900
You're here.

364
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:12,710
When did you get here?

365
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:18,100
You should get home early.

366
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:21,530
Look at the time. Everyone was worried.

367
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:27,030
Goodnight.

368
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:33,380
I wasn't worried.

369
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:35,150
Me, neither.

370
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:38,290
I think he's earlier than usual today.

371
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:53,320
 They asked me to do it. 

372
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:56,510
 I said I wouldn't. 

373
00:27:56,510 --> 00:28:00,280
 The writer asked me just to do two lines. 

374
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:04,730
Here's my little brother with the complicated love life.

375
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:06,370
What are you talking about?

376
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:10,590
What's going on?

377
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:14,690
I thought you liked Ji Won, but your girlfriend is Seo Young.

378
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:17,820
And then you broke up with her not long after.

379
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:23,290
It's complicated, so I'm figuring it out one step at a time.

380
00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:24,370
Okay?

381
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:26,740
Well, well...

382
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,140
I heard you met the lawyer this afternoon.

383
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:33,990
What did he say?

384
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:38,320
Chief Lee keeps going out of his way.

385
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:41,300
Your teacher, Mr. Lee,

386
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:44,390
he visited the lawyer first.

387
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:48,940
I think he's meeting up with the people he used to work with.

388
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:51,030
I see.

389
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:55,040
But I really wish he wouldn't.

390
00:28:56,440 --> 00:29:01,110
My homeroom teacher back in school helped me a lot with the trial until recently,

391
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:05,540
but eventually, he ended things badly with the school.

392
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:09,580
I'm worried the same thing will happen to Chief Lee.

393
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:13,480
Is that what happened?

394
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,890
Yes.

395
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:19,930
So don't pressure Chief Lee.

396
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:23,860
We shouldn't burden others just for our sake.

397
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:41,090
Where did they go?

398
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:46,740
   
   

399
00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:56,520
   

400
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:05,910
 Here is an easy tutorial on how to use the tools. 

401
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:08,150
 I think it would help if you looked it over. 

402
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:34,910
   

403
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:41,500
   

404
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:56,100
 Are you a kleptomaniac? 

405
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:08,450
Why would you take someone else's stuff?

406
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:10,960
I wrote it so it's mine.

407
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:14,320
- What about the one I wrote? 
 - As for that...

408
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,650
you were going to give it to me anyway.

409
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:19,160
Wow.

410
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:21,630
That's impossible logic.

411
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:25,680
So why didn't you give it to me in time so I knew?

412
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:29,830
Whatever. It's all a dark past.

413
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:32,220
I'll deal with it by myself.

414
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:34,520
- I'm going. 
 - Wait—

415
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,970
Well...

416
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:41,890
Everything's good with you, right?

417
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:44,070
What?

418
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:48,240
I just meant... Is everything okay?

419
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:52,130
You always go back and forth around this time of the year.

420
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,520
"This time of the year"?

421
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,920
You say you like me.

422
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,940
Then you hit me.

423
00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:01,930
Then you say it was a joke.

424
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,350
What are you talking about?

425
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:07,980
Why would you bring that up now?

426
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:10,100
What I mean is...

427
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:12,220
you know...

428
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:13,710
like...

429
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:15,410
I was just wondering...

430
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:18,580
if you were suddenly meeting someone, or dating him,

431
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:21,480
- or something like that. 
 - Hey.

432
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:24,280
What's been up with you since this morning?

433
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:26,750
Stop getting on my nerves.

434
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:29,580
Things are already complicated enough for me.

435
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:39,270
They're complicated for me too.

436
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:42,190
Geez.

437
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:53,320
What? Say that again.

438
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:00,190
Who?

439
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:02,260
A teacher at our school?

440
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,890
Lee Kang Hoon?

441
00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:22,030
I'll deal with the teacher.

442
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:26,320
So you just focus on wrapping up the trial.

443
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:31,380
If by any chance we lose... it won't just end with you losing your job.

444
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:35,170
I could be in danger too. Got it?

445
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:51,700
Teaching Director, I need to see you in my office.

446
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,290
Mr. Lee Kang Hoon.

447
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,570
Here you are.

448
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:09,920
What is it?

449
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:13,070
You weren't picking up your phone.

450
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:16,470
Can we talk for a moment?

451
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:17,890
Of course.

452
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,680
Keep working.

453
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:34,160
So that boy, Jung Young Joo, is the team leader of this club?

454
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,000
Yes, is that a problem?

455
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,350
- Are you close to him? 
 - Sorry?

456
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:48,390
It seems you're busy taking care of those brothers.

457
00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:52,130
What do you mean?

458
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:53,990
His older brother,

459
00:34:53,990 --> 00:34:57,420
Jung Cheol Joo. He's a graduate of our school.

460
00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:00,550
I hear you've been meeting with a lot of people

461
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:03,380
for that man's trial.

462
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:05,730
 Hyungnim! 

463
00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:08,170
 Hey. 

464
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:16,410
So are you planning to testify at the trial or something?

465
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:22,490
All right. Listen carefully.

466
00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:26,340
Cheol Joo's accident has already been defined as an industrial accident.

467
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:29,210
He already got it all but for some reason,

468
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:32,850
he's nagging at the company, asking for more money.

469
00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:35,600
Well, he's not nagging. I heard

470
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,530
it's about compensation for damages.

471
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:41,860
That's not all. Jung Young Joo even threw a flowerpot on the director's car

472
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:44,500
because his brother wasn't getting more money.

473
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:49,350
Director Gu knows all that, but she let it slide.

474
00:35:57,850 --> 00:36:00,990
Let's act properly.

475
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:04,540
You should stay longer here as a teacher.

476
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:07,020
I'm sure you can't go back to your old job.

477
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:08,570
Isn't that right?

478
00:36:08,570 --> 00:36:12,680
Who would hire someone who was fired for receiving bribes?

479
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:15,320
Be grateful to the school

480
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:19,620
and don't repay kindness with a load of crap. Understand?

481
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:33,380
That was tough.

482
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:37,680
Still, it's fun to work on it together with friends.

483
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,880
Jae Hee, you only made one today.

484
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:45,380
I'm just a perfectionist. I was just being meticulous.

485
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:46,830
Is that right?

486
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:49,530
Great. How admirable.

487
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:52,400
Hey, Ji Won.

488
00:36:58,930 --> 00:37:01,010
Do you have a second?

489
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,700
Pardon?

490
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:06,980
S-Sure.

491
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:10,360
We need to talk.

492
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:13,980
What's going on? What secret are you guys sharing?

493
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:16,250
My gosh. Never mind.

494
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:18,820
We'll get going first. See you tomorrow.

495
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:45,000
What is it? Did you have something to say to me?

496
00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:49,350
I have a lot to say to you.

497
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:51,840
Did you work some more on the stool?

498
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,450
I don't have work tomorrow.

499
00:37:53,450 --> 00:37:55,970
Should we meet up in the afternoon and work on it together?

500
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:59,220
I haven't even started.

501
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:02,930
I'm so out of it these days.

502
00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:07,380
Have I added to the reasons that you're so out of it?

503
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,560
Ji Won...

504
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:18,950
Have you thought about what I said?

505
00:38:22,850 --> 00:38:25,080
No, I haven't.

506
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:28,250
I see.

507
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,120
Hey.

508
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:39,470
May I be honest with you?

509
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:42,780
It's a bit intimidating.

510
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:47,960
There's someone that I like.

511
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:51,190
I confessed to him recently.

512
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:55,600
I didn't think he cared about me,

513
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,810
so I was going to give up.

514
00:38:58,450 --> 00:39:00,350
But I'm not doing that well with it.

515
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:02,740
So that's why...

516
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:06,830
I haven't had time to think about what you said.

517
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:08,470
I'm sorry.

518
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:13,490
You're in the same situation as I am.

519
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:18,500
So... Do you regret it?

520
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:21,530
Do you wish you hadn't confessed?

521
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:25,790
No.

522
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:29,430
Me, neither.

523
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:35,400
However it turns out, I don't regret telling you how I feel.

524
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:40,100
So you shouldn't regret it either.

525
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:42,340
Just do what your heart wants.

526
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:48,830
Let's go.

527
00:39:48,830 --> 00:39:50,290
Sure.

528
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:20,740
 I think... 

529
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:23,700
 I like you. 

530
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:26,790
 It's you. 

531
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:29,540
 You're the person I feel sincerely about. 

532
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:32,630
 Hey, Ji Won. 

533
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,110
 Do you have a second? 

534
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:39,180
 We need to talk. 

535
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:57,110
What is she doing this late?

536
00:40:58,850 --> 00:41:00,390
Geez.

537
00:41:02,810 --> 00:41:04,470
Hey!

538
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:09,380
You surprised me. What?

539
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:10,970
You...

540
00:41:12,910 --> 00:41:15,670
Don't slam the door.

541
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:18,530
It just slammed.

542
00:41:21,450 --> 00:41:23,360
What was that about?

543
00:41:58,510 --> 00:42:00,240
Oh, Ki Joon.

544
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,510
- Hello. 
 - Are you going to school?

545
00:42:02,510 --> 00:42:05,310
- Yes. 
 - All right.

546
00:42:05,310 --> 00:42:07,360
Ah, Ki Joon.

547
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:11,670
Is something going on with Ji Won at school, by any chance?

548
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:14,530
- Sorry? 
 - She usually sleeps in,

549
00:42:14,530 --> 00:42:18,280
but she keeps going to school early in the morning lately.

550
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:22,550
Well, I'm not sure.

551
00:42:22,550 --> 00:42:24,740
Are you guys...

552
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:28,830
still not being friendly with each other?

553
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:33,220
Get along with each other. You both live under the same roof.

554
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:34,620
Yes, sure.

555
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:36,270
All right.

556
00:42:36,270 --> 00:42:38,430
Have a good day.

557
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:49,640
Come over here!

558
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:51,140
Grab his hair.

559
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:53,130
Hey, hey, hey!

560
00:42:53,130 --> 00:42:54,540
Geez!

561
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:56,800
I woke up an hour earlier for this.

562
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:59,720
I have to look good for Eun Bi.

563
00:43:03,290 --> 00:43:04,980
Hey!

564
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:12,280
Hey, you. Don't sweep your hair back like that.

565
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:13,550
What?

566
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:15,190
Geez.

567
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:19,160
Eun Bi...

568
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:21,110
- Does my hair look weird? 
 - As always.

569
00:43:21,110 --> 00:43:24,200
Geez, I woke up an hour earlier for this.

570
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:27,750
Put some tension in your arm!

571
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,500
Come on, use your strength.

572
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:31,830
Seriously.

573
00:43:31,830 --> 00:43:36,000
Hey. Don't crinkle your eyes like that when you smile.

574
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:40,820
Crinkle?

575
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:42,830
Ho Sung, Ho Sung!

576
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:53,900
- You got nothing on me. 
 - Hey, you!

577
00:43:55,910 --> 00:43:57,510
You...

578
00:43:58,870 --> 00:44:01,060
Don't have broad shoulders.

579
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:03,910
Why are they so broad anyway?

580
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:22,500
Hey!

581
00:44:25,930 --> 00:44:27,700
Don't wash here.

582
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:30,900
Wash your hair at home.

583
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:34,870
Eun Bi...

584
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:39,120
Eun Bi.

585
00:44:41,990 --> 00:44:43,420
Does this look okay to you?

586
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:44,590
Whatever.

587
00:44:44,590 --> 00:44:46,780
I don't like it.

588
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:50,310
Eun Bi...

589
00:44:52,770 --> 00:44:54,830
Seriously, what's going on?

590
00:44:54,830 --> 00:44:56,390
Did I do something wrong?

591
00:44:56,390 --> 00:44:58,560
Eun Bi.

592
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,910
Geez! Hello?

593
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:04,800
Who is this?

594
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:07,130
Right. You won't say anything again, will you?

595
00:45:07,130 --> 00:45:08,680
You won't even breathe, right?

596
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:11,040
Fine. I knew you would do this.

597
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:11,900
Hey!

598
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:15,800
I don't know who you are, but just say what you have to say.

599
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:17,640
If not, don't call again.

600
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:19,810
Be creative with things like this.

601
00:45:19,810 --> 00:45:21,420
It's not fun at all.

602
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:24,190
If you call again, it won't be fun for you.

603
00:45:24,190 --> 00:45:28,310
I'll make sure you share an intimate gaze with a police officer.

604
00:45:28,310 --> 00:45:31,090
Got it? Geez!

605
00:45:31,090 --> 00:45:33,130
- What is it? 
 - What?

606
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:35,660
It's nothing. I keep getting prank calls,

607
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:38,510
so I just gave them a warning.

608
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:42,000
Eun Bi.

609
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,550
Could it be... are you worried about me?

610
00:45:46,310 --> 00:45:48,560
What did you get yourself into

611
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:50,090
to get prank calls like that?

612
00:45:50,090 --> 00:45:54,040
Come on. I didn't do anything.

613
00:45:55,050 --> 00:45:57,320
Eun Bi. Did you just worry about me?

614
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:58,870
I think you did.

615
00:45:58,870 --> 00:46:00,380
Right?

616
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:10,790
   

617
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:15,490
Done.

618
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:18,620
Well done.

619
00:46:18,620 --> 00:46:22,050
Good work, everyone.

620
00:46:22,050 --> 00:46:25,230
Yesterday, did you all share the speakers' delivery location?

621
00:46:25,230 --> 00:46:26,760
 Yes. 

622
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:30,290
I let them know so be there on time.

623
00:46:30,290 --> 00:46:34,400
Get it there safely, test it out, take some pictures—

624
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,620
Come on. Those are basics, Mr. Lee.

625
00:46:36,620 --> 00:46:38,430
Don't worry.

626
00:46:38,430 --> 00:46:39,780
All right.

627
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:43,290
Then, let's move in three teams.

628
00:46:43,290 --> 00:46:45,410
We'll be a team.

629
00:46:46,430 --> 00:46:48,630
 Yay. 

630
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:54,670
We'll be a team.

631
00:47:00,430 --> 00:47:03,430
Oh. Okay.

632
00:47:06,430 --> 00:47:10,020
Then, it's the two of you.

633
00:47:15,470 --> 00:47:16,880
Hello!

634
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:18,610
 Hello... 

635
00:47:18,610 --> 00:47:20,470
Hello.

636
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:25,300
- Hello. 
 - Hi, golden hands.

637
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:28,210
- Mr. Lee Kang Hoon, right? 
 - Yes.

638
00:47:28,210 --> 00:47:30,640
I'm Jo Jae MIn of Baro Furniture. We spoke on the phone.

639
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,270
Oh, hello!

640
00:47:32,270 --> 00:47:34,690
Say hello. He's the vice president of Baro Furniture.

641
00:47:34,690 --> 00:47:37,230
Hello.

642
00:47:37,230 --> 00:47:38,640
He's so young.

643
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:41,540
Yeah. The job was handed to me.

644
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:44,790
Oh, have some snacks.

645
00:47:44,790 --> 00:47:47,400
- Wow, thank you. 
 - Thank you.

646
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:49,860
Thank you.

647
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:51,730
Oh, so it's this.

648
00:47:51,730 --> 00:47:54,230
Wow...

649
00:47:54,230 --> 00:47:58,000
It's not... too pretty.

650
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,590
But it's clean.

651
00:47:59,590 --> 00:48:02,080
The design is practical.

652
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:03,950
Very good.

653
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:08,040
We're going to film you delivering it to local residents.

654
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:10,490
- So let's do a good job. 
 - Sorry?

655
00:48:10,490 --> 00:48:13,610
I wasn't aware of that.

656
00:48:14,180 --> 00:48:16,050
Oh, it's all right.

657
00:48:16,050 --> 00:48:19,110
He'll go with Ki Joon's team.

658
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:24,680
Go on and eat.

659
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:28,190
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you for the snacks.

660
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:36,020
We'll play music for you.

661
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:42,310
What is it?

662
00:48:42,310 --> 00:48:44,580
I can't hear it.

663
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:47,480
One, two, three.

664
00:48:51,070 --> 00:48:53,770
- Oh my! 
 - Fascinating.

665
00:48:53,770 --> 00:48:55,830
That's amazing.

666
00:48:55,830 --> 00:48:57,520
- It's coming from here? 
 - Yes.

667
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:00,810
- It's made of wood? 
 - Yes.

668
00:49:04,530 --> 00:49:07,300
This is fascinating.

669
00:49:14,750 --> 00:49:16,220
Where are you going?

670
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:17,810
You need to dance.

671
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:36,000
This is a speaker?

672
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,030
Where's the plug?

673
00:49:39,030 --> 00:49:41,660
Isn't it just a decoration?

674
00:49:41,660 --> 00:49:44,160
Look, Grandpa.

675
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:47,010
You turn on music or the radio on your phone.

676
00:49:47,010 --> 00:49:51,800
That's no good. It's small. I won't hear the sound.

677
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:54,660
You plug this in here.

678
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:56,610
You can hear it, right?

679
00:49:58,290 --> 00:50:02,270
- Wow. That's incredible. 
 - What is this?

680
00:50:02,270 --> 00:50:06,050
Did you guys make this for us to use at the security office?

681
00:50:06,050 --> 00:50:08,190
Yes. It's for the security office.

682
00:50:08,190 --> 00:50:11,620
We're giving them to senior citizen centers and places for the elderly.

683
00:50:11,620 --> 00:50:12,550
I see.

684
00:50:12,550 --> 00:50:15,380
We have enough, so feel free to hand them around the offices.

685
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:18,180
 All right. 

686
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:22,530
So, when you saw your grandfather listening to music uncomfortably at the security office,

687
00:50:22,530 --> 00:50:24,360
you thought of this?

688
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:26,220
Ah, yes.

689
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:28,980
Sir, may we photograph you with your grandson?

690
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:30,830
Oh, sure.

691
00:50:30,830 --> 00:50:32,880
Am I going to be in the newspaper?

692
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:34,450
You should take the picture.

693
00:50:34,450 --> 00:50:38,650
You became a star, thanks to your grandson.

694
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:42,670
Okay.

695
00:50:44,690 --> 00:50:47,460
Young Joo, what are you doing? Get in here.

696
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:50,930
- Sorry? 
 - We should take it together.

697
00:50:50,930 --> 00:50:51,860
Get over there.

698
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:55,290
This project started because of you, team leader.

699
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,780
All right, here we go.

700
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:05,060
One, two, three!

701
00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:07,750
One more.

702
00:51:07,750 --> 00:51:11,200
One, two, three!

703
00:51:24,650 --> 00:51:26,840
How many are left?

704
00:51:28,990 --> 00:51:30,710
Three.

705
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:34,350
So are we only going to three more places?

706
00:51:34,350 --> 00:51:35,700
Yes.

707
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:40,160
If you're busy, I can do it alone.

708
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:41,670
It's fine.

709
00:51:41,670 --> 00:51:44,150
I'm doing what I need to, so don't mind me.

710
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:49,350
Let's play truth or dare.

711
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:51,840
Are you crazy?

712
00:51:54,630 --> 00:51:56,310
Just ask instead.

713
00:51:56,310 --> 00:51:58,870
Truth or dare is childish.

714
00:52:00,470 --> 00:52:03,080
Actually, let me ask you something.

715
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:04,530
Have you...

716
00:52:05,390 --> 00:52:08,080
sent Gyeong Min's mom a present every year?

717
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:10,130
A scarf?

718
00:52:10,130 --> 00:52:12,060
How did you know?

719
00:52:12,970 --> 00:52:15,680
I ran into her a few days ago.

720
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:19,590
It's my turn now.

721
00:52:24,730 --> 00:52:26,540
I actually...

722
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:29,890
went to the carpentry room that day...

723
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:34,970
when you and Ji Won were there.

724
00:52:41,390 --> 00:52:44,930
But I didn't hear Ji Won's answer.

725
00:52:46,340 --> 00:52:48,070
What did she say?

726
00:52:49,790 --> 00:52:52,790
Why do I have to tell you that?

727
00:52:54,470 --> 00:52:57,280
If you want to know, ask her yourself.

728
00:52:58,140 --> 00:53:01,860
There's a reason why I can't ask her.

729
00:53:01,860 --> 00:53:03,770
I thought you were friends.

730
00:53:06,490 --> 00:53:08,180
Right, well...

731
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:11,560
Who said this was related to that?

732
00:53:15,810 --> 00:53:18,260
I'm serious about Ji Won.

733
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:21,850
So if you're...

734
00:53:22,730 --> 00:53:25,120
sincere about her, then be honest.

735
00:53:27,310 --> 00:53:29,980
If you're tip-toeing around because of me,

736
00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:31,890
you're dead.

737
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:55,880
Mr. Lee.

738
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:59,150
- What are you doing? 
 - Hi there.

739
00:53:59,150 --> 00:54:01,430
Why did you come back?

740
00:54:01,430 --> 00:54:03,610
I wanted to drop off what we had left.

741
00:54:03,610 --> 00:54:06,260
I think we were too greedy.

742
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:09,810
We were planning to go to ten places, but we only got to three.

743
00:54:09,810 --> 00:54:11,800
I knew that would happen.

744
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:13,890
Jin Ji Won, seriously.

745
00:54:13,890 --> 00:54:17,230
It's all because of that passion, passion, passion!

746
00:54:17,230 --> 00:54:20,670
Why? A person should have some passion.

747
00:54:20,670 --> 00:54:24,780
Passion, passion, passion!

748
00:54:26,210 --> 00:54:28,900
So, how did it go today?

749
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:30,910
Did everyone like them?

750
00:54:30,910 --> 00:54:34,530
Yes. They really loved them.

751
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:40,400
Are you still sullen that we didn't go with your idea?

752
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:45,920
I was a little disappointed,

753
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:49,550
but I think I know what you meant.

754
00:54:49,550 --> 00:54:52,640
Well, well. Look who is mature.

755
00:54:53,270 --> 00:54:54,790
What are you working on?

756
00:54:54,790 --> 00:54:57,370
Are you making a speaker?

757
00:54:57,370 --> 00:54:59,060
I am.

758
00:54:59,810 --> 00:55:02,510
I thought of someone to give it to.

759
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:09,450
It's fun. I haven't done this in a while.

760
00:55:15,010 --> 00:55:16,480
Here you go.

761
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:19,060
- One moment, please. 
 - Sure.

762
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:23,840
 I'm serious about Ji Won. 

763
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:25,810
 So if you're... 

764
00:55:26,780 --> 00:55:29,130
 sincere about her, then be honest. 

765
00:55:36,340 --> 00:55:38,530
Is it okay? How about you, honey?

766
00:55:38,530 --> 00:55:40,560
Come on.

767
00:55:54,430 --> 00:55:56,580
You caught that?

768
00:56:08,010 --> 00:56:09,830
When did it start?

769
00:56:10,470 --> 00:56:11,340
When did what start?

770
00:56:11,340 --> 00:56:16,110
Didn't you say you've been close to the manager since high school?

771
00:56:16,110 --> 00:56:17,830
That's right.

772
00:56:17,830 --> 00:56:21,130
So how did you guys start dating?

773
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:26,340
It turns out both he and I liked each other.

774
00:56:28,070 --> 00:56:30,130
So...

775
00:56:30,130 --> 00:56:33,640
How can you suddenly know that?

776
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:35,950
Wow, Gong Ki Joon.

777
00:56:35,950 --> 00:56:38,250
It doesn't seem like you're really curious about us.

778
00:56:38,250 --> 00:56:40,660
There's someone you're thinking of.

779
00:56:40,660 --> 00:56:42,770
It's not like that.

780
00:56:43,940 --> 00:56:46,800
It's really easy. Simple.

781
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:52,340
There's a way to know for sure if you like a person or not in one shot.

782
00:56:52,340 --> 00:56:55,070
Well? Should I tell you?

783
00:56:55,070 --> 00:56:56,880
Geez.

784
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:59,800
Gosh, how can you know that in one shot...

785
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:02,540
You don't want to know? Fine then.

786
00:57:03,370 --> 00:57:04,670
Well...

787
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:08,450
What is it?

788
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:14,340
Close your eyes.

789
00:57:14,340 --> 00:57:16,930
- What? 
 - Hurry.

790
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:20,640
Okay.

791
00:57:21,570 --> 00:57:25,380
First, imagine that person's face.

792
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:33,970
 Right now, that person is somewhere you are familiar with. 

793
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:37,610
 And next to her is a man 

794
00:57:37,610 --> 00:57:39,890
 who is not you. 

795
00:57:39,890 --> 00:57:41,190
 Geez... 

796
00:57:41,190 --> 00:57:44,740
 It would be easier if it's someone you know. 

797
00:57:44,740 --> 00:57:49,900
 And there's a certain... desire between the two. 

798
00:57:51,670 --> 00:57:53,980
 Geez, okay, okay... 

799
00:57:59,310 --> 00:58:03,490
 Their faces are... getting closer to each other. 

800
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:05,930
Closer...

801
00:58:05,930 --> 00:58:07,400
and closer...

802
00:58:08,150 --> 00:58:09,440
and closer...

803
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:11,290
and closer...

804
00:58:12,370 --> 00:58:15,890
- And then finally— 
 - Stop!

805
00:58:19,350 --> 00:58:24,060
Put your hand on your heart right now. That's your proof, you high schooler.

806
00:58:29,310 --> 00:58:33,990
But if... we break up after we get together,

807
00:58:33,990 --> 00:58:36,400
then we can't even be friends.

808
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:40,130
What kind of friendship with that heart of yours?

809
00:58:40,130 --> 00:58:43,820
You guys already aren't friends anymore.

810
00:59:05,540 --> 00:59:08,900
 But if we break up after we get together, 

811
00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:11,030
 then we can't even be friends. 

812
00:59:11,030 --> 00:59:13,750
 What kind of friendship with that heart of yours? 

813
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:17,220
 You guys already aren't friends anymore. 

814
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:51,380
Ki Joon, why are you leaving so early today?

815
00:59:51,380 --> 00:59:53,510
Oh, I can't have breakfast today, Grandpa.

816
00:59:53,510 --> 00:59:55,790
- Sorry. 
 - Wait...

817
01:00:00,940 --> 01:00:02,700
So sleepy.

818
01:00:17,620 --> 01:00:21,130
What are you doing? Why are you here so early?

819
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:29,720
Why do you always come to school so early?

820
01:00:31,540 --> 01:00:34,120
That's because...

821
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:36,150
Are you avoiding me?

822
01:00:36,150 --> 01:00:39,300
No. That's not it.

823
01:00:42,530 --> 01:00:45,600
Starting tomorrow, let's walk together.

824
01:00:47,390 --> 01:00:48,560
What?

825
01:00:49,430 --> 01:00:51,980
Let's eat lunches together

826
01:00:51,980 --> 01:00:55,620
and let's walk home together after work.

827
01:00:57,390 --> 01:01:00,250
What are you saying?

828
01:01:11,020 --> 01:01:13,290
I'm asking you to go out with me.

829
01:01:18,980 --> 01:01:21,270
I like you.

830
01:01:29,910 --> 01:01:38,120
♫  Dream on, dream on, dream on  ♫

831
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:45,390
♫  Dream on, dream on, dream on  ♫

832
01:01:45,390 --> 01:01:51,230
♫  My heart keeps thinking of you  ♫

833
01:01:51,230 --> 01:01:55,310
♫  I can't even understand myself  ♫

834
01:01:55,310 --> 01:02:00,990
♫  I'm always curious about you  ♫

835
01:02:00,990 --> 01:02:03,050
♫  Whenever I run into you  ♫

836
01:02:03,050 --> 01:02:08,670
♫  Dream on, dream on, dream on  ♫

837
01:02:08,670 --> 01:02:11,310
♫  I'm dreaming right now  ♫

838
01:02:11,310 --> 01:02:15,730
♫  Dream on, dream on, dream on  ♫

01:02:15,730 --> 01:02:18,780
   

840
01:02:18,780 --> 01:02:21,490
 Today is our Day One, after all. 

841
01:02:21,490 --> 01:02:22,710
 "Day One." 

842
01:02:22,710 --> 01:02:24,950
 You make me think of something. 

843
01:02:24,950 --> 01:02:26,530
 Me? 

844
01:02:26,530 --> 01:02:28,330
 I'll go crazy for real. 

845
01:02:28,330 --> 01:02:31,440
 Have my eyes become weird from being with him so much? 

846
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:33,050
 Get things in order? 

847
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:36,680
 Why do we have to keep it secret? 

848
01:02:36,700 --> 01:02:39,600
 - Really? 
 - Hey! Be quiet. 

849
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:41,290
 I hear that Jin Sung University is your goal. 

850
01:02:41,290 --> 01:02:42,900
 Why did you ask to see me? 

851
01:02:42,900 --> 01:02:45,960
 I want to give you an opportunity. 

852
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:49,500
 I think we have a chance of overturning the trial. 

853
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:53,100
♫  You're in my heart  ♫
