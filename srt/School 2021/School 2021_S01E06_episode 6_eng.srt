1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,630
   

2
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:09,020
   

3
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:11,990
   

4
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:14,790
   

5
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:17,110
   

6
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:21,110
   

7
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:33,620
   

8
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,600
 I heard what happened. 

9
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,180
 You're searching for housing, right? 

10
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:48,800
 Gosh, that Ji Ho Sung... 

11
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,270
 Why didn't you tell me? 

12
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:52,430
 What could you do? 

13
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:53,870
 We could worry together. 

14
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:55,780
 Why would you worry about it too? 

15
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,830
 Don't poke your nose where you shouldn't, and focus on the competition. 

16
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:05,770
 Hey, can't you tell the difference between poking-my-nose-in and worrying? 

17
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:10,940
 Enough. 

18
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:12,780
 It's my problem. 

19
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:18,280
 There's a room at my house. 

20
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:22,650
 What? 

21
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,210
 There's a room available at my house. 

22
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,000
 Do you want to move into my house? 

23
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,200
 The people on our second floor moved out recently, so it's empty. 

24
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:41,400
 You can stay there with Grandpa for now, until things get better. 

25
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:44,090
 I was wondering what you were talking about. 

26
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:45,510
 It's fine. 

27
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:47,790
 Why would I move into your place? 

28
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:49,310
 Hey. 

29
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:51,240
 Is this the time to worry about your ego? 

30
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,640
 Just think of Grandpa. 

31
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:58,740
 I'll figure it out. 

32
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:11,360
   

33
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:19,230
I think we can make a pool right here.

34
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:21,930
- How does that sound? 
 - Gosh, it sounds great.

35
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:24,040
The yard would look much bigger.

36
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,940
The children will love it.

37
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:30,540
Student, when do you start moving on Saturday?

38
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:33,770
I want to bring the interior designer over that day.

39
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:37,080
Actually, we haven't decided on an exact time yet.

40
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,920
Let me know when it's set.

41
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,400
Okay, I will.

42
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:46,640
This neighborhood is pretty quiet, so it's nice.

43
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,050
You made a great decision.

44
00:02:52,940 --> 00:03:00,010
 Timing and Subtitles by the ðŸŽ¶ Sing for a dream ðŸŽ¤ Team @ viki 

45
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:13,730
 Do you want to move into my house? 

46
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:15,520
 Is this the time to worry about your ego? 

47
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,880
 Just think of Grandpa. 

48
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:36,900
Hey.

49
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,550
Oh... hi.

50
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:42,330
Oh, I saw your text too late last night and couldn't respond. Sorry.

51
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:45,610
No, it's nothing. Don't mind it.

52
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:49,220
Oh, thank you for the gift.

53
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:51,440
It was nothing.

54
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,080
It was yummy, right?

55
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,640
Pardon?

56
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:58,800
Oh, yes.

57
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,730
I'm glad.

58
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,620
Good morning.

59
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:14,040
Good morning.

60
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,520
Hello.

61
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,900
Do you have a minute?

62
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:25,750
So didn't you get his business card?

63
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:29,410
That sunbae is like that. He's narrow-minded.

64
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:32,000
It's unfortunate, isn't it?

65
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:38,100
Then I'll have to think of another way.

66
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,410
You did relay the message correctly, right?

67
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:42,820
Of course.

68
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:46,740
I made sure he understood, but...

69
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:50,420
For now, call him again.

70
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:52,830
He might have declined out of courtesy.

71
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:57,610
You know, some people refuse initially, but they accept eventually.

72
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,460
All right. I'll contact him again.

73
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:02,150
I'll contact him again.

74
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:03,970
All right then.

75
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:17,040
It was suffocating at the hospital, wasn't it?

76
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,620
Yes, it was.

77
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:22,430
It made me restless.

78
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:25,240
Let's not come back here again.

79
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:29,210
But why do you look so distressed?

80
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:31,170
Aren't you happy I'm leaving the hospital?

81
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:33,010
Of course, I'm happy.

82
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,650
It's because of the house situation, right?

83
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,210
No.

84
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:41,580
There's no need to worry about that now.

85
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,410
It's all been resolved.

86
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:44,560
What?

87
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:50,000
Someone I know said we could move in without a deposit and just pay rent.

88
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,490
Really?

89
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:54,040
Don't look so happy.

90
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:57,350
If you smile like that when we're being kicked out,

91
00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:00,210
it makes me sad. All right?

92
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:04,000
I'm so glad.

93
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:13,580
- Geez. 
 - Hey.

94
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:17,080
- Fine, you do it. 
 - Why don't you listen? You do this one.

95
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:28,250
I'm not. I'm just going there.

96
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,890
Isn't your partner coming today?

97
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:36,040
I'm not sure.

98
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,490
He said he would come if possible, even if he's late.

99
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:40,380
Did you say his grandfather was sick?

100
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,040
Yes.

101
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,470
Sorry for being late.

102
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:52,330
Aigoo, speak of the devil.

103
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:53,850
Hurry and join in.

104
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:56,140
She was struggling on her own.

105
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:57,580
Okay.

106
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,720
What about Grandpa?

107
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,940
- Did he leave the hospital okay? 
 - Yes.

108
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:08,690
He's in good condition.

109
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:11,400
I helped him get back home.

110
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,420
I'm glad.

111
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:18,070
Oh... and...

112
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:19,620
We got housing too.

113
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,440
Oh...

114
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,620
Really?

115
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:25,990
So stop your meddling.

116
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:28,100
Let's just focus on the competition.

117
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,760
Okay?

118
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:16,130
What is it?

119
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:17,900
Are you sad?

120
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:23,610
I built this a year after you were born.

121
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,360
I made it as strong as you.

122
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,600
It's unfortunate.

123
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:33,410
They could use it as it is.

124
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:36,740
When I can buy back this house,

125
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:40,070
I'll build you a better workroom.

126
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:42,700
You have to build it yourself. Do you think you can do it?

127
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,410
Of course.

128
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:46,870
My carpentry skills have become much better recently.

129
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:48,660
You little...

130
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,630
We're ready to go.

131
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:06,630
Sir, should we get going?

132
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:07,790
Yes, let's go.

133
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:10,380
Okay.

134
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:21,140
How long does it take?

135
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:24,660
Have you been there before?

136
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:27,570
How do you know this person?

137
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:30,260
Sure, I've been there.

138
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:32,600
I have known them for a long time.

139
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:36,620
It's a right turn at that intersection, isn't it?

140
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:39,510
Oh, yes. That's correct.

141
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:48,190
Wow.

142
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:49,890
What?

143
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:54,690
What's with this ironing?

144
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:57,500
Why does this tracksuit feel like Dad's ironed blazer?

145
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:01,300
What about it? I wear this every day.

146
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:08,760
Don't forget to take this off.

147
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:11,470
Geez.

148
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,850
This neighborhood...

149
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:25,330
All right, we're here.

150
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:26,750
Sorry?

151
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:27,840
Is it here?

152
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,180
- Thank you for driving. 
 - Of course.

153
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:32,990
Wait, Grandpa...

154
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:35,700
Oh, Sir, you're here.

155
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,110
Ki Joon, welcome.

156
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:38,160
Hello.

157
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,320
I suppose you haven't seen Ji Soo in a while.

158
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,810
Aigoo, you grew up to be even prettier.

159
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:45,550
- She grew up a lot, right? 
 - Gosh.

160
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:47,170
 I... 

161
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:48,650
 I just feel bad about it. 

162
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:51,730
 Gosh! There's really no need. 

163
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:55,420
 Compared to how indebted we are to you, 

164
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:58,650
 it's really nothing. 

165
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:01,140
 Thank you, truly. 

166
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:06,150
 Don't tell Ki Joon yet. 

167
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:09,900
 Ji Won asked him, but he said no. 

168
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:12,400
 He's young, so I understand. 

169
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:16,400
 Once Ki Joon gets to our place, I will talk to him about it. 

170
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,400
All right...

171
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,990
We cleaned up a little bit,

172
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:27,900
but I'm not sure if you'll like it.

173
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,890
Gosh. Don't be like that.

174
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:31,440
Shall we see the room then?

175
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,510
Shall we?

176
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:34,370
Let's go inside.

177
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,490
- See you tomorrow. 
 - Good work today.

178
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:51,660
- See you tomorrow. 
 - See you.

179
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,100
Ouch, my eyes are stinging.

180
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,400
Wasn't work today too hard?

181
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,820
Come on, Chief.

182
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:00,660
We have to grab a drink together on a day like today.

183
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:01,930
You people...

184
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:04,030
Let's go. I wondered why no one mentioned it.

185
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:05,490
I expect nothing less, Chief!

186
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,500
But do you know where you're going?

187
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:15,210
 Manager, didn't you overwork yourself when you have a day off tomorrow? 

188
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:16,320
 Good work today. 

189
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,990
 Chief. 

190
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:19,430
 Why are you all still here? 

191
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:20,780
 We were waiting for you, Chief. 

192
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:22,810
 - Why? 
 - We have a day off tomorrow. 

193
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:24,310
 Shall we grab a drink? 

194
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:25,520
 No, no, no... 

195
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,210
 Let's hurry over there. 

196
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:28,540
 Let's go. 

197
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,510
 Are you buying? 

198
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:32,500
 Of course, I am. 

199
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:36,680
 Let's go to the usual place. 

200
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,510
 I suppose after playing it big, 

201
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:42,220
 a small task like this doesn't satisfy you. 

202
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:50,510
Hey, Cheol Joo. Are you there already?

203
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:53,670
I'm almost there, too.

204
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:04,540
Cheol Joo, it's beenâ€”

205
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:22,410
You're surprised, right?

206
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:30,840
Back then, I kept telling them to replace the aerial work-platform.

207
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,330
I'm sorry, Cheol Joo.

208
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:35,740
I didn't know this had happened to you.

209
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:37,210
Don't say that.

210
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:39,720
It happened after you left, Chief.

211
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,160
Why should you be sorry?

212
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,690
So are you preparing for an injury-compensation trial?

213
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:50,180
What did the company say?

214
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,690
So...

215
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,440
It was fine soon after I fell,

216
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:58,020
but it's getting worse with time. It's like an after-effect.

217
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:00,610
It's hard to prove anything.

218
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:05,580
That place is Sang Rim, right?

219
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:10,320
I work as a teacher at that foundation's school.

220
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,580
Do you mean Nulji High?

221
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:14,560
Yes.

222
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,070
I graduated from there.

223
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:19,730
I see...

224
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:22,070
You're right.

225
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:26,630
You were on-site at Sang Rim since you were at Nulji High.

226
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:28,060
Yes.

227
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:34,310
Wow, but you as a teacher...

228
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:36,360
I can't imagine it.

229
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,140
You're right.

230
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,930
I can't believe it, either.

231
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:44,330
My brother goes there.

232
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:45,300
Oh, really?

233
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:48,050
- You're in the Architectural Department, right? 
 - I am.

234
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:50,320
Do you know Jung Young Joo by any chance?

235
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,340
Young Joo? J-Jung Young Joo?

236
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:53,700
Yes.

237
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,070
Oh, is he your brother?

238
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:01,300
- Do you know him? 
 - I do. I know him well.

239
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,760
I'm glad.

240
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:05,640
Chief, please take good care of Young Joo.

241
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,410
No.

242
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:10,130
I hope he can take good care of me.

243
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:21,590
So... you said you had something to tell me in person.

244
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:23,050
What is it?

245
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:26,530
Well...

246
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:31,100
It's about the trial.

247
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:34,820
I was wondering if you could stand as a witness.

248
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:36,080
Me?

249
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:36,950
Yes.

250
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:38,660
Like you said earlier,

251
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:42,610
I wanted to ask you to testify about telling them that

252
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:45,610
they needed to change the aerial work-platform.

253
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,150
I suppose it's a difficult thing to ask of you.

254
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:57,480
I didn't know you worked at Nulji High.

255
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:00,830
No, no, no. It's not because of that.

256
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:05,740
You...

257
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:09,300
You haven't heard why I quit my job as a supervisor, have you?

258
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:15,890
I don't think my testimony will help much.

259
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,050
Excuse me?

260
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:28,210
I know. Ji Soo, you don't remember, do you?

261
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:29,760
Gosh.

262
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:33,340
What a wonderful mood tonight!

263
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:36,580
I like it when it's lively like this.

264
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,500
So...

265
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,400
I'm worried you'll be uncomfortable as the house is old.

266
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,550
- The steps are steep too. 
 - Aigoo.

267
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:45,030
Don't say such things.

268
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:48,590
I'm so indebted to both of you for this.

269
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:52,510
- Gosh, please. 
 - No. You're not indebted. Not at all.

270
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:53,930
Ki Joon...

271
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:56,000
Here's a super welcome.

272
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,630
Thank you.

273
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:02,480
Since you and Ji Won are living under the same roof now,

274
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,640
get along as you did in the past.

275
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,030
Don't fight. Okay?

276
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,400
We're not little children.

277
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,530
What fight?

278
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:14,800
And it's technically not the same roof.

279
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,600
Anyhow...

280
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:21,580
Sir, shouldn't we make a toast on a day like today?

281
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:23,910
All right, is everyone's glass filled?

282
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:27,820
Oh, we're out of perilla leaves. I'll get some more.

283
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:29,310
Dad, don't do it. It's embarrassing.

284
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:32,150
"Youth is in the present."

285
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:37,800
- Yippie! 
 - Yippie!

286
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:52,020
Have some more, Sir.

287
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,260
This is plum tea.

288
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:12,770
Mom said it's for Grandpa.

289
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:17,630
Okay. Tell her "Thank you."

290
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:31,270
You should have told me if you knew.

291
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,440
Sorry.

292
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:38,800
It must have been funny to you.

293
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:42,240
I was really happy that we had found housing.

294
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,890
Hey.

295
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:47,250
Stop being so cynical about it.

296
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:58,000
It's an outstanding view, right?

297
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:02,560
Yes. It looks nice.

298
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:07,110
The adults had already decided on it,

299
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:09,320
so I couldn't speak up.

300
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:12,020
Besides, you wouldn't have refused

301
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:15,120
by saying you were uncomfortable with me.

302
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,990
That's true, I guess.

303
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:23,760
Also, we will be living on different floors and won't mix that much.

304
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,850
So there's no need to be uneasy about it.

305
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:30,040
It's not like you're going to be noisy.

306
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,950
I'm going downstairs.

307
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:42,220
Okay.

308
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,800
Sleep tight.

309
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:52,920
You too.

310
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:08,080
Leave it. I'll do it.

311
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,240
What?

312
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,990
I told you not to overwork yourself.

313
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:13,980
I'm just laying down the bedding.

314
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:23,870
Aren't you going to complain to me?

315
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:26,890
Well, why bother now.

316
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:32,050
I didn't tell you because I thought you'd be bothered by it.

317
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:35,390
It's not like there was a better option.

318
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:37,120
I know.

319
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:42,070
So... Are you still angry with me?

320
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:43,480
No.

321
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,500
Starting tomorrow, I won't be angry.

322
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:07,310
Do you practice like this on your own, every weekend?

323
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:08,970
Yes.

324
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:13,310
Why did you come? I said I could do it alone.

325
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:15,850
I'm here to practice too.

326
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:19,380
I don't want to mess up at the competition and have somebody be angry with me.

327
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,330
I'll go home alone today.

328
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:29,350
No one is watching anyway, and it's late.

329
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:31,870
Isn't it weird?

330
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:34,930
What is?

331
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:38,780
I think people will more likely walk someone home if it's late.

332
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:41,630
Will they?

333
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:43,570
Never mind.

334
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:46,140
I'll just walk with you and go where we always go.

335
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:51,890
Are you using what I gave you?

336
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:53,370
Pardon?

337
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:55,900
Oh, those...

338
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:58,040
No, not yet.

339
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,570
I haven't worn gloves before, so I feel awkward.

340
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:02,810
It's your loss if you get hurt.

341
00:22:02,810 --> 00:22:05,100
Don't regret it if that happens.

342
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:08,820
Hey.

343
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,630
You don't have any friends, do you?

344
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:13,590
Neither do you.

345
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,340
 Anyway, we're friends now, right? 

346
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:20,990
 What? 

347
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:27,110
 Don't get into fights anymore. 

348
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:31,560
I think I do.

349
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:34,990
Really?

350
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:47,900
   

351
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:50,460
What are you doing in my room?

352
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:56,410
I saw a similar case to yours on the news.

353
00:22:57,230 --> 00:22:59,480
I was looking up the verdict.

354
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,960
I keep telling you not to worry and focus on school.

355
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:05,800
Geez. I am going to school too diligently.

356
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,180
Oh, right.

357
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:10,100
There's a teacher named Lee Kang Hoon in your department, right?

358
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,660
How do you know that person?

359
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:17,180
How can you call your teacher "that person"?

360
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:19,490
He's only a teacher if he acts like one.

361
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:21,780
He's a good person.

362
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:22,700
How so?

363
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:25,660
He was there with me when I worked on-site.

364
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:28,210
He was a supervisor back then,

365
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:30,590
and only he cared about us apprentices

366
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:33,770
and told the bosses the machines needed fixing.

367
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:34,690
He is that kind of person.

368
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:37,000
Then isn't he somehow liable for your accident?

369
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:42,430
My accident happened long after he went to another site.

370
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:49,360
If Sang Rim had done as he said at the time,

371
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:53,790
the accident wouldn't have happened.

372
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:57,680
Anyway...

373
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,400
Be nice to Mr. Lee Kang Hoon.

374
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:03,140
I asked him to take special care of you.

375
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:05,120
Forget it.

376
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,100
 Jin Ji Won. 

377
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:13,250
 Take this to Ki Joon's. 

378
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,010
What is it?

379
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:21,530
Mom told me to deliver this.

380
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,810
 I'm going now. 

381
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,740
 Delivery! 

382
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:48,130
- Enjoy. 
 - Thank you.

383
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,570
You surprised me.

384
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:01,000
What's that?

385
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,340
Give that back!

386
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:35,350
It's mine! Mine!

387
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:36,600
Give that back!

388
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,750
- What are you talking about? 
 - It's mine!

389
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:41,480
- Are you crazy? 
 - Yes, I'm crazy.

390
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,390
Unni, Unni, ouch!

391
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:44,820
I faked it.

392
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:47,270
- Come back! 
 - Come and get me!

393
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:25,230
We're getting involved more than we thought we would.

394
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:29,020
Yes, well...

395
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:32,590
Let's both be more careful.

396
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:34,180
Okay.

397
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:39,970
If that's the case, should we go separately from that main street?

398
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:45,600
There's no need to have everyone misunderstand, right?

399
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:50,550
Okay, sure.

400
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:54,090
I-I was going to say that, too.

401
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:29,140
 Jung Young Joo. 

402
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:33,770
So you're Cheol Joo's brother, right?

403
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:37,270
I heard from my brother.

404
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:39,070
Nothing is going to change.

405
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:41,930
You should take after your brother more.

406
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:45,730
If you weren't Cheol Joo's brother, I wouldn't have paid any attention to you.

407
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:50,790
But about throwing the flowerpot at Director Gu's car. Why did you do it?

408
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:53,620
You didn't tell my brother that, did you?

409
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:59,440
I was thinking...

410
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:01,920
It couldn't be about love,

411
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,940
nor about money.

412
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:08,260
Obviously, it's because of a grudge.

413
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:11,310
Think however you want.

414
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:13,350
Then...

415
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:16,480
I should just ask your brother.

416
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,200
Just you try.

417
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:21,560
Look at this. Don't you dare glare at me.

418
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:27,800
Fine, fine. I won't tell him.

419
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:35,290
Your brother worries about you a lot.

420
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:38,240
If there's anything I can help with, let me know.

421
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,170
No way.

422
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,730
I'm going.

423
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:50,920
Gong Ki Joon.

424
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:54,550
Did your move go well?

425
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:55,410
Yes.

426
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:58,370
Come on now. When are you having a housewarming?

427
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:00,990
I won't be.

428
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:03,770
Still, I searched for housing for you.

429
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:05,560
You must be really grateful to me.

430
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,840
Just tell me. When should it be?

431
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,470
J-Just...

432
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:11,780
- I'll buy you lunch. 
 - No way.

433
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:14,100
That won't do.

434
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:17,600
It's Ji Won.

435
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:21,090
Oh. I can come over with Ji Won.

436
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:23,000
Jin Ji Won!

437
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,700
Hey, I'm going inside first.

438
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:33,670
Bonjour. Do want to hear the good news?

439
00:29:33,670 --> 00:29:36,030
- What is it? 
 - Ki Joon found a house.

440
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:37,400
He moved during the weekend.

441
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,950
Oh, wo-wow, okay.

442
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:42,880
- Good for him. 
 - You were really worried for him.

443
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,640
- I was? 
 - What's up with you?

444
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,090
Ki Joon was really stressed,

445
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:49,460
so let's have a housewarming and cheer him up.

446
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:51,590
What? Oh, no, no.

447
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:53,990
I'm not interested.

448
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:55,970
What are you talking about?

449
00:29:55,970 --> 00:29:59,500
You called me and asked what was up with Ki Joon.

450
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,160
Don't you remember doing that?

451
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:04,040
I don't know... No idea. I'm heading inside first.

452
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:09,830
We're in the same class. Why do they keep saying they'll go ahead of me?

453
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:12,490
Wait for me!

454
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:15,200
Oh, my God...

455
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,980
Hey, what's for lunch?

456
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:19,670
Let's go together.

457
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:23,600
I was shocked.

458
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:36,330
 I'm going downstairs. 

459
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:38,250
 Okay. 

460
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:40,050
 Sleep tight. 

461
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,780
Gong Ki Joon!

462
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:30,770
You called me. Why aren't you saying anything?

463
00:31:30,770 --> 00:31:31,960
What?

464
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,580
Why did you call me?

465
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:36,790
Oh... I...

466
00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:40,570
Stop sleeping and come to the club room.

467
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:42,520
What?

468
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,360
I was going to.

469
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,660
This is not bad.

470
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:14,380
Is it good enough?

471
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:15,920
Yes.

472
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,790
Tomorrow at the competition, if there's time,

473
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:20,290
erase these pencil marks

474
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:23,260
and finish off the edges here.

475
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:24,870
Got it.

476
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:41,830
Are you okay?

477
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:48,250
You're not hurt, are you?

478
00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:54,950
So it looks like it will be difficult to guarantee the outcomes.

479
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,960
That's how competitions are.

480
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,940
How can we know the results in advance?

481
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:08,150
Still, the new teacher is very passionate.

482
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:10,080
He just lacks the tenacity to finish things off.

483
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:13,910
Then should I ask him to contact his sunbae again?

484
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:15,850
There's no need.

485
00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:19,140
The teacher in charge taught them well,

486
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:20,910
so I'm sure it will pay off.

487
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:23,570
Oh. Yes.

488
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:29,580
Then I'll be going.

489
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:31,990
Which university is it?

490
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,960
It's finally tomorrow.

491
00:33:57,050 --> 00:33:59,520
Good work so far.

492
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:02,810
If we get good results, it's all thanks to you.

493
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:05,240
What in the world? I'm not used to this.

494
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,020
Just act like you always do.

495
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,330
I was only being honest.

496
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:12,030
As I always have been.

497
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,400
Is that so?

498
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,870
Yes.

499
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:23,410
Let's do well tomorrow. Like we used to.

500
00:34:23,990 --> 00:34:25,430
Bye.

501
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,870
Hey!

502
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:40,440
What are you doing here?

503
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,040
What about you?

504
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,980
By any chance, do you...

505
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:47,970
actually like him?

506
00:34:47,970 --> 00:34:50,780
I already told you it's just an agreement.

507
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:56,310
- Then why did you let your bus pass you by? 
 - What?

508
00:34:56,310 --> 00:35:00,500
Earlier, the bus you're supposed to get on passed by.

509
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:03,500
When did I...

510
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:04,940
The bus...

511
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,390
I didn't see it.

512
00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:10,080
Why are you following people around?

513
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:15,830
Here.

514
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,340
I wish you first place tomorrow.

515
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:20,550
I waited to give it to you.

516
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,910
A big yeot. 
  (TN: Yeot is given to students in the hope they will pass exams) 

517
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:29,380
Yes.

518
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:46,100
The bad students always cram the night before a test.

519
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:47,350
Wow.

520
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:50,140
Hearing you, people would think you're good at studying.

521
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:59,280
What are you doing up here instead of sleeping?

522
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:03,440
Just because. I couldn't fall asleep.

523
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:07,310
It's more nerve-wracking than I expected.

524
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:10,340
It is. So you do want to do well.

525
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:11,860
Of course.

526
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:13,980
The prize money is super big.

527
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:15,750
What are you going to do with the money?

528
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:17,460
What else.

529
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:20,600
I have to earn money and get another place.

530
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:25,470
So stop making a noise and go to bed.

531
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:29,130
The prize money depends on your state.

532
00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:30,520
Seriously.

533
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:33,280
You'll make me do all the work until the end, won't you?

534
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:38,850
Let's do well tomorrow.

535
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,330
What a nice car.

536
00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:09,170
It has all sorts of functions.

537
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,720
I liked the car before.

538
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:16,830
Hey.

539
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:18,940
How can you say that?

540
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:21,740
Who caused Aunt to get a new car?

541
00:37:22,930 --> 00:37:24,810
Oh, right.

542
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:27,160
The flowerpot incident,

543
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,470
did you really do it?

544
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:32,410
I still can't believe it.

545
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:35,430
Why would Iâ€”

546
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:37,510
l-lie...

547
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,390
I'm sorry.

548
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:44,830
Anyway, do well at the competition today.

549
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:46,210
You too.

550
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:48,260
I'm sure it'll go well.

551
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:02,110
   

552
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:08,610
Did you guys fight?

553
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:10,620
Sorry?

554
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:13,480
What's up with the atmosphere? Are you guys nervous?

555
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,080
Oh...

556
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:17,640
These guys are always like that.

557
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,790
And I'm nervous, yes.

558
00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:21,280
Geez.

559
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,410
Just do like you used to.

560
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:28,210
Aigoo, this school has really improved.

561
00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:31,540
When I was here, they didn't even have that building.

562
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:35,320
I really can't believe that you went to this university.

563
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:38,540
Can you cut me down in your head?

564
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:44,140
Jae Hee and Jae Hyeok are on their way. What about Seo Young?

565
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:46,010
She said she'd be inside.

566
00:38:46,010 --> 00:38:48,420
- Then everyone's here. 
 - Yes.

567
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:51,060
Let's go inside. Okay!

568
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,960
   

569
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:19,050
You both have to do well today.

570
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:47,950
Hey, Seo Young.

571
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:51,560
Did you come here with Director Gu?

572
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:53,650
Why do you want to know?

573
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,110
I see.

574
00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:58,090
So was this it?

575
00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:01,550
Wh-What are you going on about again?

576
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:03,430
Hey, Room Grace.

577
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:05,070
Oh, was it Room Love?

578
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:06,910
Stop paying attention to us.

579
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:09,080
It's exhausting.

580
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,550
Let's go.

581
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:22,490
   

582
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:29,810
 Fighting! 

583
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:32,330
 Fighting! 

584
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:35,070
 Fighting! 

585
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:38,600
 Fighting! 

586
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,390
Are you okay?

587
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,710
Yes, I'm fine. Don't worry about me.

588
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,400
The results...

589
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:03,620
All right, please pay attention.

590
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:07,580
Now, we'll begin the first Carpentry Competition,

591
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:09,380
hosted by Jin Sung University's

592
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:13,360
Architectural Department, for the development of future carpenters.

593
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:16,900
As we advised beforehand, you have four hours.

594
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:20,770
You may only use the hand tools on the table to make the two-person bench,

595
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:23,640
as we have announced previously.

596
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:26,360
Now then... Begin!

597
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:29,090
Fighting!

598
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:34,080
Fighting!

599
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:41,240
â™«  Dream on, dream on, dream on  â™«

600
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:43,740
I'll check the top part.

601
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:45,870
You check the bottom part, okay?

602
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:48,000
I'll make all the parts for the bottom.

603
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,690
Yes.

604
00:41:49,690 --> 00:41:55,450
â™«  My heart keeps thinking of you  â™«

605
00:41:55,450 --> 00:41:59,600
â™«  I can't even understand myself  â™«

606
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:05,230
â™«  I'm always curious about you  â™«

607
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:07,230
â™«  Whenever I run into you  â™«

608
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:13,030
â™«  Dream on, dream on, dream on  â™«

609
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:15,570
â™«  I'm dreaming right now  â™«

610
00:42:15,570 --> 00:42:20,780
â™«  Dream on, dream on, dream on  â™«

611
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:24,650
â™«  I'll grow closer to you  â™«

612
00:42:24,650 --> 00:42:26,150
Hey.

613
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:30,010
â™«  Dream on, dream on  â™«

614
00:42:30,010 --> 00:42:32,050
â™«  I'm dreaming of you  â™«

615
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:40,010
â™«  Dream on, dream on, dream on  â™«

616
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:44,270
Hey. Did you hurt yourself?

617
00:42:45,570 --> 00:42:47,410
No, I'm fine.

618
00:42:47,410 --> 00:42:49,860
We don't have time. Let's finish this.

619
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:02,130
Excuse me.

620
00:43:02,130 --> 00:43:03,900
Where is the competition area?

621
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:07,480
I can't tell if I'm at the right place.

622
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:08,840
Just go out that way.

623
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:12,060
- Oh, thank you. 
 - Okay.

624
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:14,240
You're here for the carpentry competition, right?

625
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:15,820
Me too.

626
00:43:17,090 --> 00:43:20,800
Oh, the competition has begun already.

627
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:24,460
Oh, well. That's fine by me.

628
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:26,360
Oh, I see.

629
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:28,440
All right then.

630
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:34,400
We can't verify you, so you can't go in.

631
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:37,730
I tell you, I'm right. Check the list again.

632
00:43:37,730 --> 00:43:40,860
- Check it again. 
 - Yes, Sir.

633
00:43:41,890 --> 00:43:43,060
Yes, Father.

634
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:46,960
I'm at the competition site, but they're saying I'm not on the list.

635
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:49,540
Got it.

636
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:51,760
   

637
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:08,870
All right. Your time is up.

638
00:44:08,870 --> 00:44:11,120
Please leave the completed benches as they are

639
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:14,490
and exit outside the line.

640
00:44:27,610 --> 00:44:30,280
Let's go. Good work.

641
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:33,710
Good work.

642
00:44:33,710 --> 00:44:36,670
- Is your finger okay? 
 - Yes.

643
00:44:36,670 --> 00:44:38,240
It's good.

644
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:39,680
Let's go.

645
00:44:41,850 --> 00:44:43,610
Good work, everyone.

646
00:44:43,610 --> 00:44:46,040
Staff, please check the benches.

647
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:48,070
- Good work. 
 - Thank you.

648
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:51,260
Are you worried?

649
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,610
I think I can expect a high ranking from at least one team.

650
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:16,750
Welcome.

651
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:19,170
What? Isn't that Director Gu?

652
00:45:19,170 --> 00:45:21,150
Why is she here?

653
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:24,060
I don't know.

654
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:25,800
Oh, welcome.

655
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:27,370
Hello.

656
00:45:27,370 --> 00:45:30,000
Have you all been well?

657
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:32,730
Good work out there.

658
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:40,930
- He's a judge. 
 - Oh, he's here to judge.

659
00:45:40,930 --> 00:45:42,920
Good work.

660
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:59,090
   

661
00:46:09,790 --> 00:46:11,340
Wait.

662
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:15,260
- We already checked this one. 
 - Yes.

663
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:17,650
We've already checked it.

664
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:19,960
I think you should look at the other ones.

665
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:21,460
All right.

666
00:46:43,370 --> 00:46:45,210
   

667
00:46:49,550 --> 00:46:51,830
   

668
00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:56,420
I guess the prize money is a lost cause.

669
00:46:57,850 --> 00:47:00,770
We never made this mistake during our practices.

670
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:03,080
My gosh...

671
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:06,450
All right, please pay attention.

672
00:47:06,450 --> 00:47:08,030
The results are in.

673
00:47:08,030 --> 00:47:11,780
Then we shall announce the bronze prize first.

674
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:13,740
Bronze prize...

675
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:18,160
Nulji Science and Technology High School Architectural Design department,

676
00:47:19,650 --> 00:47:22,820
Participant 12, Kang Seo Young and Jung Young Joo!

677
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:24,710
Applause, please!

678
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:38,540
Bronze?

679
00:47:47,830 --> 00:47:49,690
G-Good work.

680
00:47:49,690 --> 00:47:50,780
Okay.

681
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:54,620
Lastly, we'll announce the long-awaited gold prize.

682
00:47:56,270 --> 00:47:57,770
Gold prize . . .

683
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:01,430
Nulji Science and Technology High School Architectural Design department,

684
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:04,530
Participant 10, Lee Jae Hyeok and Lee Jae Hee!

685
00:48:04,530 --> 00:48:06,850
- Congratulations! 
 - Nice!

686
00:48:09,290 --> 00:48:12,830
The two winners... please come up to the podium.

687
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:21,680
Amazing work.

688
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:43,880
   

689
00:48:51,530 --> 00:48:52,850
Does this make any sense?

690
00:48:52,850 --> 00:48:54,570
It's Director Gu.

691
00:48:55,530 --> 00:48:58,200
- What? 
 - Director Gu did it.

692
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:01,030
- You have two winning teams. 
 - Yes.

693
00:49:01,030 --> 00:49:03,570
It's all thanks to you, professors. Thank you.

694
00:49:03,570 --> 00:49:05,430
Thank you.

695
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:17,500
It's fine.

696
00:49:20,010 --> 00:49:21,810
Good work.

697
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:29,720
- Can I talk with you for a second? 
 - Oh, sure.

698
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:31,710
Go ahead.

699
00:49:34,830 --> 00:49:36,450
What happened?

700
00:49:36,450 --> 00:49:38,410
What do you mean?

701
00:49:38,410 --> 00:49:41,280
- I thought you said thenâ€” 
 - Professor Kim?

702
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:42,770
Oh, hello.

703
00:49:43,770 --> 00:49:45,760
Good work.

704
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,260
Good work, Mr. Lee Kang Hoon.

705
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:51,670
Yes.

706
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:54,300
It's all thanks to Kang Hoon.

707
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:57,240
I was introduced to you through Kang Hoon.

708
00:49:57,240 --> 00:50:01,140
We should have dinner sometime with the president of the university.

709
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:03,260
Oh, of course.

710
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:07,760
You should join us, too, Mr. Lee Kang Hoon.

711
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:14,610
How about sometime next week?

712
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:38,340
My brother was wrong.

713
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:43,070
What?

714
00:50:43,070 --> 00:50:46,770
Hyung said you were a good person.

715
00:50:46,770 --> 00:50:48,800
I said, no way.

716
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:52,160
- Hey, what are youâ€” 
 - You nearly fooled me.

717
00:50:54,730 --> 00:50:59,550
You and Director Gu... You're all the same.

718
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:36,270
Hey. Don't you think Lee Jae Hyeok and Lee Jae Hee didn't deserve it?

719
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:40,850
It's all a mess.

720
00:51:40,850 --> 00:51:43,110
What will you do since you didn't win any money?

721
00:51:43,110 --> 00:51:45,040
I don't know.

722
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:48,060
I guess I'll live at your place for the rest of my life.

723
00:51:52,060 --> 00:51:56,270
But if you become a carpenter, do you earn a lot of money?

724
00:51:56,270 --> 00:51:59,080
- Why? 
 - Just...

725
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:01,480
It is more fun than I thought it would be.

726
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:05,000
I don't know for sure,

727
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:08,200
but I don't think you'll earn much if you do what you're doing.

728
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:14,170
Thank you for your kind words.

729
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,210
Wait for me.

730
00:52:20,210 --> 00:52:22,120
- Wait! 
 - I have to go.

731
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:24,360
Seriously!

732
00:52:30,010 --> 00:52:33,990
 The gold prize, Lee Jae Hyeok and Lee Jae Hee! Congratulations! 

733
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:39,480
   

734
00:53:02,390 --> 00:53:03,500
   

735
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:05,110
Again? 
    

736
00:53:05,110 --> 00:53:08,010
How are the twins doing that?

737
00:53:08,010 --> 00:53:10,500
Why bother printing a new announcement poster?

738
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:13,400
Just reuse the last one.

739
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:15,170
Poor Jin Ji Won.

740
00:53:15,170 --> 00:53:17,630
I told her not to join the competition.

741
00:53:17,630 --> 00:53:21,700
I'm sure Ji Won is disappointed, but I think Seo Young will explode this time.

742
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:23,120
I know, right?

743
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:27,800
I heard she found this opportunity because she was sick of losing to the twins.

744
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:30,820
Gosh, that's too bad...

745
00:53:30,820 --> 00:53:33,110
Seo Young. It's Seo Young.

746
00:53:47,050 --> 00:53:48,440
She seems fine.

747
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:50,390
That's weird.

748
00:53:51,140 --> 00:53:54,360
Whatever. She's scary. Let's go. Let's go.

749
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:04,400
Mr. Lee Kang Hoon. You're here.

750
00:54:05,090 --> 00:54:06,860
Oh, yes.

751
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:17,020
Would you like some coffee?

752
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:19,030
Sure.

753
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:25,620
The results were good this time.

754
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:28,420
Good work.

755
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:30,720
Yes...

756
00:54:42,650 --> 00:54:44,460
So...

757
00:54:45,090 --> 00:54:49,490
Did you meet with my sunbae at Jin Sung University?

758
00:54:49,490 --> 00:54:53,770
We did. You helped us meet.

759
00:54:54,380 --> 00:54:55,810
Pardon?

760
00:54:56,640 --> 00:55:00,040
 They want your business card. 

761
00:55:15,030 --> 00:55:16,760
 Okay. 

762
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:19,430
 Sure, we're all in the education field together. 

763
00:55:19,430 --> 00:55:21,970
 It's good to make worthwhile connections. 

764
00:55:22,510 --> 00:55:24,600
 I should meet up with themâ€” 

765
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:26,170
 Wait, Hyung. 

766
00:55:26,910 --> 00:55:29,070
 I'm so sorry! 

767
00:55:29,070 --> 00:55:32,480
 I know you hate things like this, but... 

768
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:37,480
 I have to pretend, at least, if the higher-ups tell me to. Gosh, I just couldn't help it. 

769
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:43,740
 I know you're not the type of person to interfere with the students' competition. 

770
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:45,730
 I'm really sorry. 

771
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:56,330
Anyhow, this event ended successfully, thanks to you.

772
00:55:58,510 --> 00:56:00,000
Yes.

773
00:56:00,770 --> 00:56:02,260
Well then.

774
00:56:02,970 --> 00:56:04,910
Mr. Lee Kang Hoon.

775
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:07,900
Yes?

776
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:12,760
It turns out... what I heard was different from what you told me.

777
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,460
Did I misjudge you?

778
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:20,640
Why did you do that?

779
00:56:21,370 --> 00:56:24,940
Well, I-I-I...

780
00:56:30,710 --> 00:56:36,090
From now on, don't try to play tricks.

781
00:56:36,090 --> 00:56:40,870
Just deliver what you're told to and relay exactly what you hear.

782
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:43,660
I think that should be easy enough.

783
00:56:43,660 --> 00:56:45,090
Right?

784
00:57:10,290 --> 00:57:11,900
   

785
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:29,630
It feels comfortable.

786
00:57:44,090 --> 00:57:47,800
 It was more fun than I thought it would be. 

787
00:57:52,460 --> 00:57:53,980
What are you doing?

788
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:56,330
Pardon?

789
00:57:57,140 --> 00:58:00,040
Why are you here? The club is finished.

790
00:58:00,040 --> 00:58:02,550
I came to pack up the stuff I left here.

791
00:58:02,550 --> 00:58:06,440
They told us to move our personal belongings out of here.

792
00:58:08,170 --> 00:58:11,250
I'm here to say goodbye to my bench.

793
00:58:12,850 --> 00:58:16,060
- Are you throwing it away? 
 - I can't help it.

794
00:58:16,060 --> 00:58:19,250
I could take it apart and recycle it.

795
00:58:21,940 --> 00:58:24,090
What a waste.

796
00:58:25,370 --> 00:58:27,290
Why can't you take it home?

797
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:46,550
I wonder what people think we're doing.

798
00:58:46,550 --> 00:58:48,620
I don't know.

799
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:52,450
That we're thieves stealing a bench?

800
00:58:55,060 --> 00:58:58,470
Your bench is on display because it won an award.

801
00:58:58,470 --> 00:59:00,170
Yes.

802
00:59:02,030 --> 00:59:04,870
I didn't even think about taking it home.

803
00:59:06,510 --> 00:59:09,700
I keep getting new things to be grateful to you for.

804
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:13,700
Repay me later. I'll remember all of them.

805
00:59:15,770 --> 00:59:19,770
Well... Since I'm grateful,

806
00:59:19,770 --> 00:59:23,110
can I add something I feel sorry for?

807
00:59:23,110 --> 00:59:26,520
Hey. Adding what you're sorry for to gratitude is a lot, isn't it?

808
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:29,720
Right? Maybe I shouldn't say it.

809
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:31,500
What is it?

810
00:59:33,830 --> 00:59:36,610
The day you came to our school,

811
00:59:36,610 --> 00:59:39,240
that time when your pants ripped.

812
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:42,210
Yes.

813
00:59:44,230 --> 00:59:46,230
That was me.

814
00:59:46,230 --> 00:59:47,890
I see...

815
00:59:47,890 --> 00:59:49,580
What?

816
00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:53,060
Sorry. It was a mistake.

817
00:59:53,060 --> 00:59:56,360
I planned on making the culprit regret itâ€”

818
00:59:56,360 --> 00:59:59,270
I confessed, so go easy on me. Please?

819
00:59:59,270 --> 01:00:01,520
I'm sorry.

820
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:04,470
- My arms are going to fall off. 
 - Fine.

821
01:00:04,470 --> 01:00:06,330
- Really? 
 - I said, "Fine."

822
01:00:06,330 --> 01:00:07,890
Really.

823
01:00:07,890 --> 01:00:11,290
- Hold onto this. We're going now. 
 - Oh, yes, sir.

824
01:00:11,290 --> 01:00:13,490
Are you really forgiving me?

825
01:00:14,550 --> 01:00:16,480
- I don't know. 
 - Oh, then...

826
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:19,710
I'll take that as a "yes," Sir. Thank you, Sir.

827
01:00:21,780 --> 01:00:26,290
I'm so relieved. I was so scared.

828
01:00:37,540 --> 01:00:39,770
I'll put it in place for you since I'm here.

829
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:44,940
You said you'll put it up on the rooftop. You can't carry it up by yourself.

830
01:00:44,940 --> 01:00:48,330
What? Oh, don't worry!

831
01:00:48,330 --> 01:00:50,640
Well... my dad.

832
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:53,040
I'm sure Dad is home. It's okay.

833
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:55,630
- Really? 
 - Yes.

01:00:55,630 --> 01:00:58,920
Go home, go home. Thank you for today.

835
01:01:01,390 --> 01:01:04,510
I'm going then. See you tomorrow.

836
01:01:08,110 --> 01:01:11,110
Where did it go? Geez.

837
01:01:11,110 --> 01:01:12,860
 Who is it? 

838
01:01:12,860 --> 01:01:15,650
Oh, it's me.

839
01:01:15,650 --> 01:01:18,750
Hurry, hurry, hurry...

840
01:01:18,750 --> 01:01:20,470
Hey.

841
01:01:21,950 --> 01:01:23,570
Ji Won.

842
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:31,160
What? What is it?

843
01:01:33,950 --> 01:01:36,830
Hey, Jin Ji Won, I told you not to walk at nightâ€”

 You want to do this work as well as learn at the after-school academy? 

857
01:02:47,010 --> 01:02:48,410
 Are you preparing for college? 

858
01:02:48,410 --> 01:02:53,110
 It's just that I've never done it. Once I start, I learn fast. 

859
01:02:53,110 --> 01:02:55,200
 You should know when to quit. 

860
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:58,070
 Why do you hold onto what's not right for you and suffer? 

861
01:02:58,070 --> 01:02:59,990
 I did as you asked. 

862
01:02:59,990 --> 01:03:01,920
 Do me a favor too. 

863
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:04,140
 What do you mean? Tell me more. 

864
01:03:04,140 --> 01:03:06,660
 I got an offer from someone. 

865
01:03:06,660 --> 01:03:08,390
 It wasn't Jae Hee? 

866
01:03:08,390 --> 01:03:09,840
 Does the school know? 

867
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:14,190
 I don't want to see a hardworking person get hurt and ruined again.
