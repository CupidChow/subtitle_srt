1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,640
   

2
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:09,140
   

3
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:11,940
   

4
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:14,930
   

5
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:17,100
   

6
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:21,190
   

7
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:33,450
   

8
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,240
What is it? What happened?

9
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,070
Who is this?

10
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:48,390
I don't know.

11
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:50,340
She said...

12
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:51,650
it's my baby.

13
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:53,140
What?

14
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:54,200
What are you talking about?

15
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:58,970
Da Hye suddenly showed up and gave it to me.

16
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:01,690
Your ex-girlfriend?

17
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:06,110
Oh, no.

18
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:08,650
I've never seen a human this small before.

19
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:11,340
Is it sick? It keeps crying.

20
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:12,910
What if something goes wrong?

21
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:14,680
Ji Ho Sung. Get it together.

22
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,710
Shouldn't you call home first?

23
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:19,650
I babysit my nephew a lot. It probably pooped.

24
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:21,460
No, I think it's hungry.

25
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:23,100
What do we do? What do we do?

26
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,560
It needs its mother's milk.

27
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,310
Stupid, we can use baby formula.

28
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:27,880
Where do we buy formula?

29
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,570
Do they sell it at the school canteen?

30
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:31,180
They probably don't.

31
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:34,080
Ho Sung.

32
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:37,820
Ms. Song.

33
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:46,110
Peek-a-boo.

34
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:48,390
Seriously, this is unbelievable.

35
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:50,260
What am I doing?

36
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:52,090
Right?

37
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:59,260
Look at what this school has come to.

38
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,720
But now you're holding him, he has stopped crying.

39
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,620
That's amazing.

40
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:11,850
I heard that you raised three children.

41
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:13,580
Your posture is different for sure.

42
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:15,890
- What did you say? 
 - Food.

43
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:17,510
Food. Food is here.

44
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:19,430
- Let's eat food. 
 - Careful.

45
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,300
- Hold his head first. 
 - Got it.

46
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,830
Aigoo.

47
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:32,040


48
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:37,690
I think he was hungry.

49
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:40,270
Gosh, you eat so well.

50
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:42,690
You need to tilt the bottle up. Tilt it up.

51
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:44,470
Sorry?

52
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:46,840
- A little more. 
 - Like this?

53
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:49,850
That's right.

54
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:54,010
Look at you. You eat so well.

55
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:58,780
   

56
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,300
What are you talking about?

57
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,520
Why is he my baby?

58
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,130
I don't have much time so listen.

59
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:25,850
I was going to raise him regardless of you.

60
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:29,320
My parents agreed to help me raise him while I study abroad,

61
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:34,420
but I found out my mom was trying to send him somewhere without me knowing.

62
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:35,780
I can never let that happen.

63
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:37,700
W-Wait, wait.

64
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,830
Are you telling me to believe this?

65
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:42,840
- What if you don't? 
 - No, I mean...

66
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,760
If you suddenly tell me I'm his dad…

67
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:50,700
Could it be the day I had the chills?

68
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,730
It was just that one time.

69
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:55,710
I told you we shouldn't have done that!

70
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:56,750
Whatever the case…

71
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:59,060
I'm leaving the country today.

72
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:01,270
Please just raise him for three years.

73
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:02,090
What?

74
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:04,250
I'll collect him when I return from studying abroad.

75
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,340
You're also responsible for this

76
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:09,900
so just take responsibility for three years.

77
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,270
I'll take care of everything afterward.

78
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:16,320
Why do you tell me this now?

79
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,070
Why so suddenly?

80
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:20,240
I've been trying to tell you.

81
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,580
Do you think it was easy for me?

82
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:25,280
I couldn’t tell you on the phone so I wanted to see you,

83
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,070
but you were always with your girlfriend.

84
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:30,920
Why are you two never apart?

85
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:34,900
Hey, I have to go now.

86
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,650
W-Wait, no...

87
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:38,790
H-Hold on. Hold on!

88
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:40,990
What do I do if you give me a baby like this?

89
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:43,600
I'm suddenly a dad? How can you do this to me?

90
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,230
I'm begging you, Ho Sung.

91
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:48,110
You're his dad.

92
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:50,740
Will you let your child be sent somewhere unknown?

93
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,690
No.

94
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:54,560
I can't let that happen.

95
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:58,040
Even if my mom or dad phone, don't answer.

96
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,880
And don't...

97
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,470
Don't ever hand the baby over.

98
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,240
Got it?

99
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,400
Noona...

100
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,430
Noona.

101
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:21,970
Noona! Hey, Jung Da Hye! Hey!

102
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,090
What do I do?

103
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:38,640
I talked to your mom.

104
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,840
She's leaving work and coming to the school now.

105
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,560
Okay.

106
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,950
Did you really have no idea?

107
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,630
Ms. Song...

108
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:52,870
What do I do now?

109
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:56,480
Am I expelled from school?

110
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:59,430
No. Why would you be expelled?

111
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:01,250
When your mom gets here,

112
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:05,700
let's talk together about what to do going forward.

113
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,430
It's all right. Okay?

114
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,380
Can you still not reach Ho Sung?

115
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,100
No, I can't.

116
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,130
What is going on? Seriously.

117
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:32,280
I can't believe it.

118
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,860
What happens now?

119
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,640
Can he still attend school?

120
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,500
I don't know.

121
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:42,350
Do you know where Ho Sung lives? Should we visit him together?

122
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:45,500
His parents must be freaking out right now.

123
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,120
I think we should wait.

124
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:51,710
Here...

125
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:54,850
We should eat first and calm our startled hearts.

126
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:59,080
Thank you.

127
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:01,850
Oh, right.

128
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:04,130
Why did Young Joo come by last night?

129
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:05,720
By chance...

130
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,300
It's not because of me, right?

131
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:15,140
It's not.

132
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:19,060
We had something to work out.

133
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:21,160
Are there more things left to work out?

134
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,650
When will everything be worked out?

135
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,770
Just how much is tangled up?

136
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:31,850
I think it all worked out now.

137
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:35,550
You guys really took your time.

138
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:39,800
Still, I'm glad.

139
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:57,590
Calm down.

140
00:07:57,590 --> 00:07:59,880
How long will you keep crying?

141
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:02,790
What a jerk!

142
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:07,710
Is it something to cry over this much?

143
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:09,050
You weren't even dating him.

144
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:11,420
I was going to!

145
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:13,520
Starting today.

146
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,630
Good thing you didn't.

147
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:20,380
But is that really Ji Ho Sung's child?

148
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:21,910
I don't know.

149
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:25,820
I heard his ex-girlfriend stopped seeing him,

150
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,000
but what is this?

151
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,910
I'm ruined.

152
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:33,010
What do you mean, "ruined"?

153
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:35,920
Just get the people around you and your emotions in order.

154
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,340
Of course, I will.

155
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:40,080
I tell that b*stard to enjoy raising his ex-girlfriend's baby.

156
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,240
I'll be fine without him.

157
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:46,440
- That's a little much. 
 - What?

158
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,400
I'm really good at cutting things off.

159
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,060
I'm not like you.

160
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:53,450
Whatever.

161
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:56,460
You can't forget Young Joo even after he dumped you.

162
00:08:56,460 --> 00:09:01,120
- Hey. When did I say I can't— 
 - I'd never do that.

163
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,590
I'm completely fine.

164
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:06,100
Hey, why would I cry?

165
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,960
That's funny.

166
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:11,080
I'm going now.

167
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,970
Hey. Go Eun Bi!

168
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,030
Grandpa!

169
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:58,150
What?

170
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:01,370
Why did you come out here at night?

171
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:02,840
Are you okay?

172
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,380
- Does it hurt? 
 - No.

173
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:05,380
Not at all.

174
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:07,020
I'm fine.

175
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:08,830
Why did you come out here?

176
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:11,910
You haven't taken your medicine again, have you?

177
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:14,360
Why do you keep forgetting?

178
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,540
I put it on the fridge door because you kept forgetting.

179
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:21,500
Oh, I was running late, and I left in a rush.

180
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,920
I'll take them later.

181
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,750
- Right now. 
 - Pardon?

182
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:28,030
Geez, all right.

183
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,730
I'll take the trash.

184
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,340
Water.

185
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:46,590
I'm perfectly fine.

186
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:49,350
You must be tired. Why did you come all the way over here?

187
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:50,670
Hurry and go home.

188
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:52,260
It's cold.

189
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,540
Do you have to do that now?

190
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:55,090
I'm almost done anyway.

191
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:56,970
Go home. Go on.

192
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,620
- Let's do it together. 
 - What?

193
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:01,510
Geez.

194
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:04,050
Let's see.

195
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:07,360
I just have to stack them like this, right?

196
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,050
Hey.

197
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:22,560
What's up with your minion?

198
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,150
A shocking plot twist. Why is his personal life so dirty?

199
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:26,890
He looks innocent,

200
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:29,550
but it turns out he's super racy.

201
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:30,670
The child has a child.

202
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:32,910
Is he a father?

203
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:34,370
Hey.

204
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,520
You're going out with Hong Tae Woong from the Automotive Engineering Department, right?

205
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:44,190
He's cheating on you with Woo San High's Kim Na Young.

206
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:45,810
What nonsense are you spewing?

207
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:49,030
That's what a dirty personal life looks like.

208
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,310
And...

209
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:56,080
he's not my minion.

210
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:59,690
He's my boyfriend.

211
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:01,940
You moron.

212
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:04,190
Watch your mouth.

213
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:10,020
What? "Moron"! Hey!

214
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:12,270
Geez.

215
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:16,490
Why are you laughing? Why didn't you say anything?

216
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:23,890
- Did you finish your talk? 
 - Yes.

217
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:28,260
You delivered all of it this time, right?

218
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,660
Yes.

219
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:32,270
Please tell Director Gu that I'm sorry

220
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:35,400
the amount was a little short last time.

221
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,520
I'm worried she might misunderstand.

222
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:42,990
But must I come here in person to pay in cash

223
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:45,090
in this generation?

224
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:46,810
It can't be helped.

225
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:49,120
She has a lot of suspicions.

226
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,110
No internet.

227
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:54,690
   

228
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:59,820
   

229
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:03,360
Yes, come in.

230
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:16,790
Ms. Yoo makes a good impression.

231
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:18,350
She understands me well, too.

232
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:20,260
I think she'll be a great teacher.

233
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:24,480
Yes, the future of the new Drone Department is very bright.

234
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,020
The teacher for the Animal Care Department that I mentioned last time says

235
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:29,820
he'll also visit you soon.

236
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:32,820
Did Kang Seo Young say anything to you by any chance?

237
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,930
No, not yet.

238
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:37,140
But she's an ambitious person,

239
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:40,480
so I believe she'll take up that kind of offer.

240
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,510
For now, we can't just wait around.

241
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:49,950
I'm only using Kang Seo Young to put pressure on Jung Young Joo's family.

242
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:53,890
Try meeting with his mother.

243
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,440
Should I?

244
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,530
Meet her and...

245
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:01,090
ask whether she wants to continue with the trial

246
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:07,030
if it means sending her younger son to a juvenile detention center.

247
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:08,830
Ask her that.

248
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:11,420
I'm sure she will choose wisely.

249
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:13,500
Yes.

250
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,920
Hey.

251
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,600
Do you practice carpentry at home?

252
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,410
Sorry?

253
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:37,860
You know, you're getting better every day.

254
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:42,530
Mr. Lee, Ki Joon's grandpa was a great carpenter.

255
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:44,730
Really?

256
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:47,380
You must really take after your grandfather.

257
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:49,080
Thank you.

258
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:53,070
Hey, hey, hey. What does this mean?

259
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:54,320
What is it?

260
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,460
Mr. Lee, is our department being shut down?

261
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:00,360
What do you mean?

262
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,840
My cousin's brother-in-law says that our department

263
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:07,840
is not part of the student recruitment plan for next year. He works at the Ministry of Education.

264
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:11,570
- What? 
 - He says there are other departments like Drone and Animal Care

265
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:13,060
instead of our department.

266
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:16,090
Mr. Lee, is this true?

267
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,870
Well, it's…

268
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:24,450
Nothing is for certain yet, but I think it's being discussed.

269
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:26,230
Unbelievable.

270
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:29,100
Then what about us?

271
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:32,020
If the department is closed, then they won't accept new students.

272
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:34,660
You guys will stay on until you graduate.

273
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:36,430
What about the teachers?

274
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:39,620
We'll probably be trained for a new department

275
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:42,960
or go to another school. Something like that.

276
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:47,860
Guys...

277
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:51,060
Whether or not the department or the world disappears,

278
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:54,540
you still have to finish these benches by the end of this week.

279
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:55,980
Come on, come on.

280
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:58,100
Let's get going again. Quickly! Hurry, hurry!

281
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,090
Come on, get moving! Get moving!

282
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:01,920
Okay.

283
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:15,060
What happens...

284
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:17,530
after our department closes?

285
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:20,260
No one will care about us anymore.

286
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:23,890
I already requested a bunch of practice equipment since we're short.

287
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:26,330
I guess that's not happening.

288
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:28,190
That's not all.

289
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:30,630
The apprenticeship class will have fewer opportunities.

290
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:32,060
Geez.

291
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:33,570
I feel bad for the teachers, too.

292
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:36,830
Why on earth would they shut down our department?

293
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:39,610
It's true the Architectural Department is unpopular.

294
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:42,370
There's a belief that the work is rough.

295
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:43,880
I guess so.

296
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:46,750
It's fun, though.

297
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:57,080
   

298
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,620
   

299
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:04,110
- Hello? 
 -  Miss Go Eun Bi? 

300
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:05,500
 This is Mirror Entertainment. 

301
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:08,770
 You left without finishing our conversation last time. 

302
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,160
Hello.

303
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:14,330
 We're want to give you a chance because we see your potential. 

304
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:17,230
 Should we try to work this out again? 

305
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:20,110
I, ah… The thing is…

306
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:24,110
 That manager of yours suddenly got worked up over nothing. 

307
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:26,400
 Your own opinion matters the most. 

308
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,500
 - We should meet just with you.  
 - No.

309
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:36,490
I'll just... call you back another time.

310
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:41,880
 I'm going to be responsible 

311
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:46,450
 and make sure you can train at a better place than this. 

312
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,650
   

313
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,030
Jerk.

314
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:11,100
- Here. 
 - Thank you.

315
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:19,590
I have many things I want to make

316
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:22,010
and a lot more I want to learn.

317
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:25,530
Hearing news about the department closing is really disheartening.

318
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:28,260
I know.

319
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:32,760
I was just beginning to find it fun.

320
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:40,810
Do you really have the blood of a great carpenter in you?

321
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:44,020
You were awkward not that long ago.

322
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:46,630
Why are you so good?

323
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:48,900
I'm going to die of jealousy.

324
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,020
I was originally Grandpa's apprentice.

325
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,430
Come on.

326
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:55,910
I just started.

327
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,840
I should be on my best game.

328
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:01,910
I don't want to fall behind Gong Ki Joon.

329
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:05,150
You're better.

330
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:07,320
I am better for now.

331
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:24,650
Our Gong Ki Joon,

332
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:26,810
you seem to be in a good mood.

333
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:29,380
Yes.

334
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:32,370
And you, Grandpa? Isn't work hard on you?

335
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:35,000
It's the same every day for me.

336
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:38,430
It's the same for any security-guard job.

337
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,650
It must be tiring.

338
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:50,660
Don't overwork yourself. Your surgery wasn't that long ago.

339
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:53,920
And when you have too much work, just tell me.

340
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,690
- I'll come and help you again. 
 - There's no need.

341
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:59,390
You have your part-time job. It must be a lot for you.

342
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:01,340
Still...

343
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:06,080
I'm energized these days because you look so happy.

344
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:11,300
Everything is good these days.

345
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:15,520
I wish every day was like these days.

346
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,090
Great. That feels good.

347
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:21,760
- It does feel good, right? 
 - Yes.

348
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:23,630
Aigoo.

349
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:25,360
It feels nice here as well, right?

350
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,570
Oh, yes. I feel much better.

351
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,670
Wow, that's so cool.

352
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:33,020
How does it look? Is it natural?

353
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:35,400
- Yes. I want to try it too. 
 - Here.

354
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,400
So... are you going on a date with Ki Joon today?

355
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,210
What are you talking about?

356
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:45,910
Besides, we have a date every day.

357
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:48,090
Good for you.

358
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:50,380
Those of us without boyfriends suffer in loneliness.

359
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:51,350
It must be nice.

360
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:54,620
- I know, right? 
 - It must be nice to have a boyfriend.

361
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,620
Hey. Ji Ho Sung, are you okay?

362
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:02,420
Why don't you answer my calls?

363
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,710
I'm sorry.

364
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:05,970
My mom took my phone away.

365
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:07,300
Were you scolded a lot?

366
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:10,600
Mom and Dad said they felt bad for the baby, so they took him in.

367
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:13,750
But they cut me off from the family and told me to leave the house.

368
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,830
I begged and barely survived.

369
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:20,840
Hey.

370
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,870
Why do you look so horrible?

371
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:25,290
How low can your dark circles go?

372
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:26,800
I know.

373
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,550
I didn't sleep a wink because of Hyun Woo.

374
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:32,050
Hyun Woo? Who's that?

375
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:35,980
My son.

376
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:40,230
So, Hyun Woo is his son's name.

377
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:43,250
Still, the name sounds nice.

378
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:47,210
Eun Bi—

379
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:59,570
Aigoo.

380
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:02,330
- Do you want coffee? 
 - I do.

381
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:06,380
Darn. I left my cup in the carpentry room.

382
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:08,050
I wonder if I can use this.

383
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:09,610
   

384
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:16,020
I think it belonged to the teacher who was here before you came. You can use it.

385
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,970
The one who was fired unfairly?

386
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:22,170
"Fired unfairly"?

387
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:26,510
Not at all. There were many reasons, like neglect of duties.

388
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:31,260
Gosh, do you really believe that? Not even the students believe it.

389
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:38,290
I heard the school jumped on him for helping a past student with a trial.

390
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:40,250
I'm not sure about that.

391
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:43,240
Isn't being disloyal to the school that gave him his salary,

392
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:46,230
neglect and dereliction of duties?

393
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:49,070
What?

394
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:51,390
Anyway, I'm heading to class.

395
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:52,990
Have a good day.

396
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:59,610
Noona, what's going to happen with Jung Cheol Joo's trial?

397
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:02,360
You said you could get them to drop it.

398
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:05,790
I told you I'm taking care of it.

399
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:07,550
Why are you here at school?

400
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:12,180
I heard that b*stard is really sensitive about this trial.

401
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:14,600
The CEO hasn't even died yet.

402
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,880
Why is he already acting like he's CEO?

403
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,760
Be quiet!

404
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:21,960
How often do I have to clean up after your messes?

405
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:25,060
Why is this trial happening in the first place? Why?

406
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:29,470
Don't go poking your nose everywhere and just stay put.

407
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:31,360
Do you understand?

408
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:39,250
Supervisor Lee Kang Hoon?

409
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:42,620
Long time no see.

410
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:46,430
And the homeroom teacher of the girl who broke my orchid.

411
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:48,220
Hello.

412
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:54,120
What brings you here to school?

413
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:57,350
I've been meaning to get in touch.

414
00:23:57,350 --> 00:24:00,360
I'm glad I ran into you, Mr. Lee Kang Hoon.

415
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:03,700
I remember you got fired as a supervisor for meddling.

416
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:06,650
Why don't we live in peace? Okay?

417
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:10,510
I'm telling you to stay out of Jung Cheol Joo's trial.

418
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,170
You haven't changed at all, Manager Gu.

419
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:23,430
Looks like you still feel guilty about a lot of things.

420
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:24,580
What did you say?

421
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:26,590
- Look at you— 
 - Stop.

422
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:29,220
What are you doing at school?

423
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:34,130
Geez.

424
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:49,970
Good, you're being detailed.

425
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:55,060
   

426
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:59,140
   

427
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:02,260
Wow, you've become much better.

428
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:08,620
All right. That's enough for today.

429
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:13,520
I talked to the manager of the neighborhood about the six locations for these,

430
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,000
so let's try to finish by tomorrow.

431
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:21,270
And guys, each of you needs to take responsibility for your own bench. Understand?

432
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:23,610
- Yes. 
 - Fine.

433
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:26,200
You wrap up, Team Leader.

434
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,870
- Yes, sir. 
 - See you tomorrow.

435
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:30,840
Goodbye.

436
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,070
Ji Won, aren't you going home?

437
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:37,580
Tae Ri and Hyo Joo keep calling  to say they're waiting for us.

438
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:40,500
Oh, right. We're supposed to meet with them this evening.

439
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,550
Ki Joon, I'm borrowing your girlfriend for today.

440
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:45,940
Okay. Just get her home safely.

441
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:47,410
Hurry! They're calling again.

442
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:49,140
Okay.

443
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:56,570
That should be good enough.

444
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,020
Good work today.

445
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:00,860
Let's go home.

446
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:21,460
Mom, what are you doing?

447
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:25,760
You seem to be in a good mood today.

448
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:43,120
Mom, what's this?

449
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:47,650
Please don't touch it. My husband gave it to me.

450
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:52,580
 Mom, you'll hurt your ears if you keep doing this. 

451
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:54,310
 Why are you doing this to me, ahjumma? 

452
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:56,010
 I can hear it better like this. 

453
00:26:56,010 --> 00:27:00,060
 Seriously, Mom. 

454
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:07,040
 Oh, honey. 

455
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:10,870
 My husband. 

456
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:23,160
 - Have you been well? 
 - I have. And you? 

457
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:26,080
 I'm well. 

458
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,590
   

459
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:03,880
   

460
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:07,240
 I remembered sending texts to Manager Gu Byeong Chul. 

461
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:10,000
 I think I said that the lift Cheol Joo was on 

462
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,700
 when he had the accident needed to be exchanged. 

463
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:15,320
 I remember you got fired as a supervisor for meddling. 

464
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:18,030
 Why don't we live in peace? Okay? 

465
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:21,150
 I'm telling you to stay out of Jung Cheol Joo's trial. 

466
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:22,200
   

467
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:54,760
Yes, hyungnim.

468
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:00,060
This weekend?

469
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:05,300
Do you mean the place I went to last time?

470
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,420
Yes.

471
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:12,070
I will.

472
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,650
What are you doing?

473
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,700
What do you think? I'm waiting for the bus at the bus stop.

474
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,630
What about you?

475
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,280
Me?

476
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:00,150
I'm working.

477
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:18,040
So what's up?

478
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:21,920
What are you doing this weekend?

479
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:27,880
I think I'll be going to your orphanage.

480
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:31,210
My workplace volunteers regularly.

481
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:35,250
The place we're going to this time is your orphanage.

482
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,890
If you're uncomfortable, I don't have to go.

483
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:43,230
Why would I be uncomfortable?

484
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:46,890
The whole school knows I live at an orphanage.

485
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:49,850
I won't be uncomfortable if you come along.

486
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:53,060
Besides, it's not the first time.

487
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,420
Pardon?

488
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:58,210
How did you know?

489
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:03,490
I saw you when you came last spring.

490
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:05,740
Me?

491
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:08,760
That was before I started school here.

492
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:11,050
Why would you remember me?

493
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:17,880
I just saw you. Why do you keep asking?

494
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:22,820
Go. The bus should be coming soon.

495
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,430
I'll go when the bus arrives.

496
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:50,920
Hi, Mr. Lee.

497
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,800
Sorry for calling late.

498
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:57,820
Can I work on something personal in the club room?

499
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:03,510
Ki Joon, did you make this bench? It looks like it will break if I whack it.

500
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:06,320
Hey, spell out my grandpa's name.

501
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,130
Gong Young Soo?

502
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:11,150
- The blood of a great carpenter is running through my veins.
- Nonsense.

503
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:14,910
But as expected of the team leader. Your bench is the neatest.

504
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:19,200
But the nicest looking is mine. So pretty.

505
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,030
It's the ugliest.

506
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:22,890
Jae Hee. 
    

507
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:25,250
Want me to take a picture of you with it?

508
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:26,580
Ji Won.

509
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:28,290
Okay.

510
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:31,620
One, two, three.

511
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:37,720
- Have you all done a final check? 
 - Yes.

512
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:41,280
All right then. Show up on time

513
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:44,510
at the place you'll be setting up your bench.

514
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:46,830
Let's pair up and carry them downstairs.

515
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:49,030
- Come on. 
 - Okay.

516
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:57,570
- One, two, three. 
 - Okay.

517
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:28,370
Try sitting down. You made it.

518
00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:29,890
Okay.

519
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:35,770
You did a good job.

520
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:38,580
It wasn't just a good job.

521
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:40,950
I was actually quite surprised.

522
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:44,940
Do you know that you're really talented in this field?

523
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,590
Am I?

524
00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:52,040
At first, you were the worst in the group.

525
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:55,550
And even now, your skills are not yet perfect,

526
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:58,360
but you are definitely talented.

527
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:02,640
It's really rare for anyone to get used to carpentry so quickly.

528
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:07,860
Do your best. Let's go.

529
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:12,730
Thank you.

530
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:23,430
Did you do a good job setting up your bench?

531
00:34:23,430 --> 00:34:26,670
I did. I set it down and took a picture.

532
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:28,940
- And I ran over here. 
 - Wow.

533
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:30,690
You're faster than the car.

534
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:32,370
Guys.

535
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:36,170
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

536
00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:38,480
Where is your teacher? Is he not here yet?

537
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,840
I think he'll be here soon.

538
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:52,540
I'm ready to take the picture. 
    

539
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:55,800
One, two, three. 
    

540
00:34:57,290 --> 00:35:00,220
Ji Won must be nervous. You can smile.

541
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:03,290
Can we take one more in another pose?

542
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:07,550
Here we go. One, two, three.

543
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:11,410
What's this?

544
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:15,440
Since a lot of pre-school or kindergarten buses stop here,

545
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:20,190
our school club made this, so children and parents can sit here to wait.

546
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:22,590
I see.

547
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:25,590
Young sir, now you can sit here and wait for the bus.

548
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:27,260
Okay.

549
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:29,640
Did you students make this?

550
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,430
- Yes. 
 - It looks nice.

551
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:32,930
- Jin Woo, do you want to try sitting on it? 
 - Yes.

552
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:34,530
Go on.

553
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:38,560
How's that? Isn't it a nice color?

554
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,940
That noona made this.

555
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:44,710
Excuse me, would it be all right

556
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:47,180
if we took a photo of you and your son?

557
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:49,890
- Yes, sure. 
 - Thank you.

558
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:51,280
What is this for?

559
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,660
It's for the newspaper.

560
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:56,020
- You must be proud. 
 - I am. Really proud.

561
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:59,230
- Happy? 
 - One, two, three.

562
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:01,500
Okay, one more.

563
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:02,720
One, two...

564
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:05,230
- What are you doing? No, no. 
 - Wow, it's cool.

565
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:08,010
No, you can't do that. I'm sorry.

566
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:10,300
Come down. We have to sit on it.

567
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:12,810
- He jumps so well. 
 - It's okay.

568
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:17,780
Jin Woo!

569
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:18,990
Are you okay?

570
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:20,290
Are you okay?

571
00:36:20,290 --> 00:36:21,930
He's bleeding.

572
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:24,450
- Stand up. 
 - I'm sorry.

573
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,750
I'm sorry.

574
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:31,120
How did you build this bench

575
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:33,460
so it breaks down a moment after a child sits on it?

576
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:34,980
I'm so sorry.

577
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:36,650
This can't be possible…

578
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:38,860
What bad luck.

579
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:40,440
Nulji High? 
    

580
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,050
This is ridiculous.

581
00:36:42,050 --> 00:36:46,240
How can you do such a sloppy job on something for the public space?

582
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,790
This is a project that our company and Nulji High are working on together.

583
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:50,490
We'll compensate you however we can.

584
00:36:50,490 --> 00:36:52,690
It looks like the child got hurt. You should go to a hospital first.

585
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:54,180
That's fine.

586
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:57,030
Seriously. Let's go.

587
00:36:57,030 --> 00:36:58,110
We apologize.

588
00:36:58,110 --> 00:37:00,560
- I'm sorry. 
 - I'm sorry.

589
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:28,960
You used a short-grain wood, and drilled the screw

590
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,210
directly into the wood. That's why it snapped.

591
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:35,780
You should have used a drill bit to drill a hole for the screw.

592
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:39,050
I think I missed that.

593
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:42,520
I think the tenon* was a little loose too. 
  (TN: a type of wood joint) 

594
00:37:44,770 --> 00:37:48,350
It's okay. Don't worry about it too much.

595
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:51,240
You must have been shocked. Go home and rest.

596
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,870
Don't blame yourself so much.

597
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:15,640
Eun Bi.

598
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:36,470
What are you trying to do here?

599
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:40,410
It's just that Mom left for work.

600
00:38:40,410 --> 00:38:44,350
So are you bringing your son to meet me?

601
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:46,030
I'm sorry.

602
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:49,030
I wanted to see you, but I have to watch him too.

603
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:51,390
I had no choice.

604
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:54,920
The reason I asked to see you is because

605
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:57,710
I get more incredulous the more I think about it.

606
00:38:57,710 --> 00:39:00,840
Explain yourself. What on earth is going on?

607
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:03,410
What were you doing with me?

608
00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:05,720
If you have a child, aren't you basically married?

609
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,560
But...

610
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:09,580
Why did you pretend to like me?

611
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:11,200
No, Eun Bi. It's not like that.

612
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,540
I really had no idea.

613
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:16,560
My ex-girlfriend didn't call me because she didn't want to get involved with me.

614
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:20,030
But... she had her reasons,

615
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:23,970
and she asked me to raise him for three years

616
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:26,770
- while she studies abroad. 
 - What?

617
00:39:26,770 --> 00:39:28,060
Did you agree?

618
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:30,150
What was I supposed to do?

619
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:33,760
I heard my ex's parents tried to send him off somewhere.

620
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,480
I can't let them do that.

621
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:40,900
Then if your ex-girlfriend comes back after three years...

622
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,090
Are you going to marry her?

623
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:43,720
What are you saying?

624
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:46,220
I really ended things with that noona.

625
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:49,090
I don't even like her anymore. We both feel the same way.

626
00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:51,220
I'll live as Hyun Woo's dad,

627
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:54,410
but neither of us has any plans to marry each other.

628
00:39:54,410 --> 00:39:58,120
- We both agreed on that. 
 - Does that make any sense?

629
00:39:59,270 --> 00:40:01,190
Hyun Woo.

630
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:07,430
Why did he wake up?

631
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:10,680
Did you wake up because it was too loud?

632
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:14,590
Ah! He must be hungry.

633
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,560
Eun Bi.

634
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:24,270
I'm really sorry,

635
00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:26,460
but can you get some warm water in here?

636
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:29,440
Up to the 120-milliliter line.

637
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,810
Hey, Ji Ho Sung.

638
00:40:30,810 --> 00:40:32,810
Or...

639
00:40:32,810 --> 00:40:35,930
if you hold him just for a second...

640
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:41,620
Eun Bi.

641
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:43,340
Eun Bi...

642
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:45,180
Hyun Woo.

643
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:47,000
Eun Bi?

644
00:40:48,830 --> 00:40:51,450
Excuse me! 
    

645
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:55,290
Hello—

646
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,690
Teaching Director, why are you...

647
00:41:03,690 --> 00:41:07,310
Mr. Lee Kang Hoon, what are you doing here?

648
00:41:07,310 --> 00:41:10,050
Are you Young Joo's teacher by any chance?

649
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:11,240
Oh, yes.

650
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:14,350
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

651
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:16,960
But what brings you here...

652
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:21,420
I was passing by and wanted to see Cheol Joo.

653
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:24,030
You're that teacher.

654
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:30,930
Anyhow, I trust you understand.

655
00:41:30,930 --> 00:41:33,010
I'll be going now.

656
00:41:46,410 --> 00:41:47,720
That doesn't make any sense.

657
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:49,900
How can you give up on the trial?

658
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:52,160
That teacher earlier

659
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:56,070
said there was a student who saw Young Joo throw the flowerpot.

660
00:41:56,070 --> 00:41:57,890
If that student testifies,

661
00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:01,460
my Young Joo would go to juvenile detention.

662
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:03,950
But if we give up on the trial,

663
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:07,370
they will forget about Young Joo's incident.

664
00:42:07,370 --> 00:42:10,140
I have to keep Young Joo out of detention.

665
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:13,630
To be honest, I resent the school a lot.

666
00:42:13,630 --> 00:42:17,020
I know thoughts like these are useless,

667
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:19,650
but if my Cheol Joo hadn't gone to that school,

668
00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:22,760
he would be doing fine at a good job.

669
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:25,940
I should have stopped Young Joo when he said

670
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:29,120
he was transferring to that school.

671
00:42:34,450 --> 00:42:39,070
Ma'am, you need to brace yourself.

672
00:42:39,070 --> 00:42:41,160
Don't decide on anything yet.

673
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:44,520
I'll look into things a bit more. And...

674
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,730
please don't let Young Joo know.

675
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:50,960
If he hears that his brother's trial will be dropped because of him,

676
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:53,780
he won't be able to take it.

677
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:55,540
All right.

678
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:58,410
Thank you, Mr. Lee.

679
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:07,600
-  Are you okay?  
 -  Yes.

680
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:11,080
Where are you? Are you outside?

681
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:16,180
I felt trapped so I came up to the rooftop for a bit.

682
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:18,080
Hold on. I'll come up.

683
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:22,070
-  No.  
 - I want to be by myself today.

684
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:28,050
Okay then. Don't stay up there too long. It's cold.

685
00:43:28,050 --> 00:43:29,610
Okay.

686
00:43:38,330 --> 00:43:42,610
 How can you do such a sloppy job on something for the public? 

687
00:43:52,330 --> 00:43:54,420
Grandpa.

688
00:43:59,610 --> 00:44:01,830
Why did you come up here? It's cold.

689
00:44:01,830 --> 00:44:06,150
Well... Ki Joon asked me to come up here.

690
00:44:18,710 --> 00:44:21,380
I heard from Ki Joon.

691
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:24,990
Why would he tell you something like that?

692
00:44:24,990 --> 00:44:27,070
You must have been shocked.

693
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:30,050
Yes.

694
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:36,340
Ji Won, it's a weighty responsibility to make something

695
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:40,950
that people sit on and use in a space where they live.

696
00:44:40,950 --> 00:44:43,680
Just one thing out of place,

697
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:46,130
or the moment you miss something,

698
00:44:46,130 --> 00:44:49,490
can bring about catastrophic results.

699
00:44:51,650 --> 00:44:56,320
I'm not comforting you. I'm scolding you...

700
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:58,720
as your mentor.

701
00:45:00,050 --> 00:45:05,900
Still, I'm somewhat proud to see you shocked and scared

702
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:08,880
about what happened.

703
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:10,900
I don't think...

704
00:45:11,830 --> 00:45:17,130
I have any talent... or qualifications.

705
00:45:17,130 --> 00:45:19,900
I think you're qualified enough.

706
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:22,560
You're thinking about it so seriously.

707
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,420
That's enough.

708
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:28,770
Besides, talent isn't important.

709
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:33,860
What matters... is whether you're truly happy doing carpentry.

710
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:36,100
That's important.

711
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:39,770
How is it?

712
00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:42,730
Is it not fun anymore?

713
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:47,890
I don't know.

714
00:45:47,890 --> 00:45:51,270
Look into your heart carefully.

715
00:45:53,490 --> 00:45:57,850
Your life isn't ruined just because you messed up once.

716
00:45:57,850 --> 00:45:59,710
It's okay.

717
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:05,700
Trust me. It's okay.

718
00:46:23,540 --> 00:46:24,960
Here.

719
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:30,180
What's up with you? Did you get out of the wrong side of the bed today?

720
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:31,910
What are you talking about?

721
00:46:34,450 --> 00:46:37,900
Oh, they're here. Let's go, unni.

722
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:49,990
Oh my. Welcome.

723
00:46:49,990 --> 00:46:52,590
- Long time no see. 
 - Thank you.

724
00:46:52,590 --> 00:46:53,650
Hello.

725
00:46:53,650 --> 00:46:55,350
Thank you for all your work.

726
00:46:55,350 --> 00:46:59,180
We're more grateful. Really.

727
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:01,840
- Are the children doing well? 
 - Yes.

728
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,560
- Oh, it's you. 
 - Excuse me?

729
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:14,040
I saw you on Seo Young's profile picture and thought you looked familiar.

730
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:16,230
You came last time too, right?

731
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:18,220
Yes.

732
00:47:18,220 --> 00:47:20,560
- My. 
 - Do you know our youngest?

733
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:23,000
Of course.

734
00:47:23,580 --> 00:47:25,990
He's our Seo Young's boyfriend.

735
00:47:25,990 --> 00:47:27,360
- Wow. 
 - Oh, really?

736
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:30,420
Oh, actually...

737
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:33,500
Wow.

738
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:35,470
Look at him pretending like it's nothing.

739
00:47:35,470 --> 00:47:36,780
Why hide it?

740
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:38,380
Come on...

741
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:39,690
She's pretty.

742
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:41,530
Good for you.

743
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:55,350
You said you wanted to watch a movie. Did you mean at home?

744
00:47:56,950 --> 00:48:01,390
I wanted to show you a funny movie, but there's nothing funny that's out right now.

745
00:48:03,270 --> 00:48:06,430
Let's order spicy tteokbokki later.

746
00:48:06,430 --> 00:48:08,570
That's a familiar-sounding combination.

747
00:48:08,570 --> 00:48:10,470
Do you think I don't know you?

748
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:13,990
When you were little, watching something funny and eating spicy food

749
00:48:13,990 --> 00:48:16,880
always made you feel instantly better.

750
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:18,610
Doesn't it work anymore?

751
00:48:18,610 --> 00:48:20,620
It still works.

752
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:27,830
Are you feeling better?

753
00:48:30,590 --> 00:48:33,320
Yes. I'm okay.

754
00:48:34,410 --> 00:48:39,590
Hey. Why did you tell Grandpa?

755
00:48:39,590 --> 00:48:45,660
I thought my grandpa would be more helpful than me.

756
00:48:46,930 --> 00:48:48,530
Thank you.

757
00:48:51,530 --> 00:48:54,580
For now, let's forget about everything and just have fun.

758
00:48:55,230 --> 00:48:58,170
You came up here carefully so your mom and dad don't know, right?

759
00:48:58,170 --> 00:48:59,440
Of course.

760
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:04,070
I sneaked around perfectly to the second-floor front door.

761
00:49:04,070 --> 00:49:05,880
Good job.

762
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:30,510
This is the one I can't do.

763
00:49:30,510 --> 00:49:32,020
Do you want this one?

764
00:49:32,020 --> 00:49:33,910
Would you like this?

765
00:49:33,910 --> 00:49:40,780
♫  Outside the window the whole world is white  ♫

766
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:43,090
♫  Why do you stand out?  ♫

767
00:49:43,810 --> 00:49:49,220
♫  Like a petal in spring tinged yellow  ♫

768
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:53,570
♫  You're so beautiful to my eyes  ♫

769
00:49:53,570 --> 00:50:01,730
♫  When you approach me and whisper carefully again  ♫

770
00:50:01,730 --> 00:50:03,230
- Ahjussi. 
 - Yes?

771
00:50:03,230 --> 00:50:04,720
Do you like our unni?

772
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:09,640
♫  Do you know how I feel?  ♫

773
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:11,520
Do you need a nail?

774
00:50:13,130 --> 00:50:16,870
♫  Can you notice my cold fingers  ♫

775
00:50:16,870 --> 00:50:21,070
♫  And embrace me gently?  ♫

776
00:50:21,070 --> 00:50:23,760
♫  Oh, my love  ♫

777
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:28,790
You folks at Yudal Trading Company are so good at playing with the children.

778
00:50:28,790 --> 00:50:30,710
They love you so much.

779
00:50:30,710 --> 00:50:32,920
Not at all. We enjoyed playing too.

780
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:35,130
Is that so?

781
00:50:41,610 --> 00:50:44,110
- It's okay. 
 - What?

782
00:50:44,110 --> 00:50:45,750
Why?

783
00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:50,320
Can't you eat the fish if I don't de-bone it for you?

784
00:50:51,030 --> 00:50:53,660
Doesn't our youngest's girlfriend like fish?

785
00:50:53,660 --> 00:50:56,490
No, that's nonsense.

786
00:50:56,490 --> 00:50:58,960
She eats it well when I give her some.

787
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:01,900
She's just bad at removing the bones.

788
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:05,080
Although she's eighteen already,

789
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:08,020
she still can't use her chopsticks properly.

790
00:51:08,020 --> 00:51:11,700
Our youngest had better do a good job taking care of you.

791
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:15,390
Aigoo, and that's not all.

792
00:51:15,390 --> 00:51:18,960
She was always so fussy as a baby

793
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:20,950
and picky about her food.

794
00:51:20,950 --> 00:51:26,150
I practically served her like a princess.

795
00:51:26,150 --> 00:51:29,550
I don't know when she'll grow up.

796
00:51:29,550 --> 00:51:32,560
She can't do anything on her own.

797
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:35,420
She's only sharp with her words.

798
00:51:35,420 --> 00:51:38,130
She's still a baby.

799
00:51:38,130 --> 00:51:39,750
That's unexpected.

800
00:51:40,390 --> 00:51:42,970
Aigoo, our future son-in-law.

801
00:51:42,970 --> 00:51:45,600
I'll give you the biggest piece.

802
00:51:48,820 --> 00:51:51,860
Please look after our Seo Young.

803
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:53,240
Sorry?

804
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:14,960
I haven't told the head nun we've broken up yet.

805
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:16,780
Sorry.

806
00:52:16,780 --> 00:52:18,450
That's okay.

807
00:52:18,450 --> 00:52:21,690
I got another piece of fish. It was pretty good.

808
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:27,020
Oh, right.

809
00:52:30,350 --> 00:52:32,000
Here.

810
00:52:34,250 --> 00:52:36,040
What's this?

811
00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:38,520
Bookmarks.

812
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:40,480
I just made them.

813
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:44,860
I couldn't come to your place empty-handed.

814
00:52:55,430 --> 00:52:56,860
   

815
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:01,210
   
   

816
00:53:02,810 --> 00:53:05,120
Thank you.

817
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:07,480
They'll come in handy.

818
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:19,620
Is your brother's trial going well?

819
00:53:19,620 --> 00:53:21,340
I don't know.

820
00:53:21,340 --> 00:53:24,250
It's not easy.

821
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:28,240
There's someone who can testify,

822
00:53:29,330 --> 00:53:32,510
but he could be in trouble if he does.

823
00:53:32,510 --> 00:53:35,760
Even though we know that, we still asked him.

824
00:53:36,550 --> 00:53:39,270
We're making someone else suffer

825
00:53:39,270 --> 00:53:42,200
so our family can survive.

826
00:53:44,230 --> 00:53:46,480
What would you do if it were you?

827
00:53:52,370 --> 00:53:54,280
I would...

828
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:57,900
put myself first.

829
00:53:58,950 --> 00:54:00,530
That's me.

830
00:54:00,530 --> 00:54:02,270
Really?

831
00:54:02,270 --> 00:54:04,570
Do you think that's okay?

832
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:16,250
Hey, this is nice.

833
00:54:16,270 --> 00:54:19,880
Coming here and talking to you after so long.

834
00:54:26,620 --> 00:54:30,270
I think I actually had fun hanging out with you.

835
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:40,460
I've never heard that I'm fun to be with before.

836
00:54:40,460 --> 00:54:43,590
Why are those robotic expressions and words

837
00:54:43,590 --> 00:54:45,870
funny to me now?

838
00:54:46,690 --> 00:54:48,970
That's ridiculous.

839
00:55:00,550 --> 00:55:03,600
 Ki Joon! Are you home? 

840
00:55:04,470 --> 00:55:05,930
What do we do?

841
00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:08,340
Why is he here?

842
00:55:08,340 --> 00:55:10,920
 Ki Joon! Are you asleep? 

843
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:13,260
Oh, n-no!

844
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:15,180
What is it?

845
00:55:15,180 --> 00:55:20,360
 I think there's a leak in the kitchen. I should take a look at it. 

846
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:22,270
O-Okay! Ah...

847
00:55:22,270 --> 00:55:24,320
One second!

848
00:55:25,310 --> 00:55:27,220
Ouch, that hurts.

849
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:32,380
Hold on, hold on!

850
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:46,310
I just came out of the shower.

851
00:55:46,310 --> 00:55:48,830
- I see.
- I'm just getting dressed.

852
00:55:49,570 --> 00:55:51,740
Were you with a friend?

853
00:55:53,330 --> 00:55:55,440
No, I was alone.

854
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:59,250
I was so hungry that I was eating tteokbokki with both hands.

855
00:55:59,250 --> 00:56:02,330
Really? You were eating tteobokki with both hands

856
00:56:02,330 --> 00:56:05,190
and then did you suddenly go and take a shower?

857
00:56:06,330 --> 00:56:10,850
The tteobbokki was so spicy that I was just sweating like crazy.

858
00:56:10,850 --> 00:56:13,040
Is that so? Is it that spicy?

859
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:14,670
So where's the leak?

860
00:56:14,670 --> 00:56:15,490
Oh, yes.

861
00:56:15,490 --> 00:56:17,240
That's right, the sink.

862
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:22,180
Even when I fix it, it never ends.

863
00:56:22,180 --> 00:56:24,150
Gosh, look at this.

864
00:56:24,150 --> 00:56:26,650
Seriously.

865
00:56:26,650 --> 00:56:29,060
Hey, Ki Joon, can you help me with this?

866
00:56:29,060 --> 00:56:30,790
Okay.

867
00:56:35,870 --> 00:56:39,510
 You're more tender-hearted than I thought, Seo Young. 

868
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:44,140
 Even without your testimony, Jung Young Joo will be punished. 

869
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:49,550
 I simply want to give you an opportunity. 

870
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:56,460
   

871
00:57:00,330 --> 00:57:04,670
   

872
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:13,280
Hey, Ki Joon, don't turn on the water for a while.

873
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:15,290
- Okay. 
 - All right, Ki Joon. Rest up.

874
00:57:15,290 --> 00:57:18,090
- All right, goodbye! 
 -  Okay! 

875
00:57:34,460 --> 00:57:36,480
Ji Won?

876
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:39,160
- Did she jump— 
 - Over here.

877
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:40,760
Here.

878
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:43,470
In here.

879
00:57:48,830 --> 00:57:50,430
What...

880
00:57:50,430 --> 00:57:52,910
Come out. He's gone.

881
00:57:52,910 --> 00:57:54,270
I can't.

882
00:57:54,270 --> 00:57:56,450
What?

883
00:57:57,020 --> 00:57:58,250
I've got cramp.

884
00:57:58,250 --> 00:57:59,780
"Cramp"?

885
00:58:01,010 --> 00:58:02,840
Come on.

886
00:58:05,170 --> 00:58:06,320
Where? Where?

887
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:08,070
- My right leg. 
 - The right one?

888
00:58:08,070 --> 00:58:09,510
- Lie down. 
 - D-Don't.

889
00:58:09,510 --> 00:58:10,880
Don't do it.

890
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:12,490
Extend your leg. It's okay.

891
00:58:12,490 --> 00:58:13,420
- Extend your leg. 
 - Don't do it.

892
00:58:13,420 --> 00:58:16,340
I'm going to do it. Straight knee. One, two, three.

893
00:58:16,340 --> 00:58:19,370
Ouch! That hurts! It hurts!

894
00:58:19,370 --> 00:58:20,920
Hey!

895
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:24,530
Oh, no. Oh, no.

896
00:58:28,540 --> 00:58:30,970
Oh, no.

897
00:58:38,730 --> 00:58:42,220
 When was the last time I laughed like this? 

898
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:46,730
Are you okay?

899
00:58:47,910 --> 00:58:50,260
I'm sorry. 
    

900
00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:52,550
Are you okay?

901
00:58:53,380 --> 00:58:55,690
Seriously...

902
00:58:58,020 --> 00:59:02,430
 I just wanted things to stay as they were in this moment. 

903
00:59:05,850 --> 00:59:09,360
- I got a cramp again! 
 - Again?

904
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:10,820
Meow. 
  (TN: "Cramp" in Korean sounds like "mouse") 

905
00:59:10,820 --> 00:59:12,800
Meow.

906
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:15,630
This is so embarrassing.

907
00:59:21,060 --> 00:59:24,660
 I even thought I was happy. 

908
00:59:39,650 --> 00:59:41,480
Hello?

909
00:59:52,970 --> 00:59:54,420
Sorry?

910
00:59:55,110 --> 00:59:57,850
 That's what I thought. 

911
00:59:58,820 --> 01:00:00,520
 How dare I. 

912
01:00:07,220 --> 01:00:10,220
 The security guard collapsed so suddenly. 

913
01:00:10,220 --> 01:00:11,420
 Oh, no. 

914
01:00:11,420 --> 01:00:13,690
 Are you all right? 

915
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:33,760
Grandpa...

916
01:02:31,860 --> 01:02:34,070
Grandpa...

917
01:02:34,070 --> 01:02:36,530
Grandpa.

918
01:02:51,220 --> 01:02:58,220
