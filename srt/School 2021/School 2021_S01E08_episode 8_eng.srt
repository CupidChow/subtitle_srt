1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:05,210
   

2
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:09,500
   

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:13,840
   

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,230
   

5
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:18,440
   

6
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:22,860
   

7
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:34,720
   

8
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:40,660
Oh, right.

9
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:43,800
I have something to return to you.

10
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,730
This is yours, isn't it?

11
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:02,750
Take it.

12
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:12,300
 Timing and Subtitles by the ðŸŽ¶ Sing for a dream ðŸŽ¤ Team @ viki 

13
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:31,700
The on-site manager is the brother of Nulji High's Director Gu?

14
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,920
Then could we ask Director Gu...

15
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:39,130
The thing is, the on-site manager is controlled by his sister.

16
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:43,510
What do you think it means that things have come to this?

17
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:46,080
 Why are you telling me that? 

18
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,870
 That's what beggars do. 

19
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:04,830
   

20
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:05,740
   

21
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:08,740
So is there no other way?

22
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:10,040
No.

23
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:13,080
I asked an acquaintance who is a policeman.

24
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,810
He says we couldn't even start a criminal investigation.

25
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:20,150
There is no correlation between his belonging being there

26
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:23,090
and the car being damaged.

27
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,300
How frustrating.

28
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,510
I agree.

29
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:30,490
The boy has no fear.

30
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:33,210
What grudge would drive him to do this?

31
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:38,890
Perhaps he came to our school on purpose to avenge his brother.

32
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,890
Expel him.

33
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:43,430
Pardon?

34
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:49,000
But Jae Hee already confessed that she did it, so...

35
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,940
So?

36
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:55,800
Are you saying that we should let this criminal study among our children?

37
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,290
Of course not.

38
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:59,520
That won't do.

39
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,590
I'm sure there are many ways to make it happen.

40
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:08,680
Of course, I understand.

41
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:13,770
Did I send you a message asking you why you threw the flowerpot?

42
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:16,610
Yes. Yesterday evening.

43
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,500
   

44
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,990
I never sent that.

45
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:29,540
 Hey. Did you see my phone? 

46
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:32,830
 I don't know. Didn't you take it to the restroom? 

47
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,640
It's Lee Jae Hyeok.

48
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:40,230
I thought so.

49
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:43,510
And Lee Jae Hyeok told Director Gu.

50
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:49,360
But why did Lee Jae Hyeok and Director Gu point out Young Joo right away?

51
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:53,610
Because he's your boyfriend

52
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:58,200
and Uncle Byeong Chul saw Young Joo at the courthouse.

53
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,200
What?

54
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,810
Who's Uncle Byeong Chul, and what trial?

55
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:06,350
Oh, so...

56
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:16,420
   

57
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:18,450
Look.

58
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:20,640
Gu Mi Hee.

59
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:25,200
 Our aunt. 

60
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:29,590
So she's the wife of our dad's older brother.

61
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:31,680
Aunt has two siblings.

62
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,530
She has an older sister,

63
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:36,210
and a younger brother.

64
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:39,650
 That younger brother is Gu Byeong Chul. 

65
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:41,560
 He's the on-site manager of Sang Rim Housing. 

66
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,640
I think our aunt got him to work there.

67
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,430
Aunt's sister is Gu Mi Jeong.

68
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:51,710
Her husband is Sin Eul Seop, the CEO of the Sang Rim.

69
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:56,940
Our family members are in different positions throughout Sang Rim,

70
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:01,050
and our aunt is the director of Sang Rim Foundation,

71
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:04,000
so she's running our school.

72
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,570
How grand.

73
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:10,420
So this man named Gu Byeong Chul knows Jung Young Joo?

74
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:14,270
There's a trial that's been bugging Sang Rim for years.

75
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:16,060
It regards Jung Cheol Joo's case.

76
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,770
He's a sunbae from our school,

77
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:21,580
and he got injured badly while at an on-site training five years ago.

78
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:25,710
Uncle Byeong Chul was the on-site manager at the time.

79
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:30,320
But it turns out Jung Cheol Joo's brother is Jung Young Joo.

80
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,920
I think Aunt found out recently.

81
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:37,890
She probably won't let this go.

82
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:46,130
Is it okay for you to tell me all this?

83
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:48,130
Of course not.

84
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:51,240
My parents hate me talking about family matters to other people.

85
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,340
Then why?

86
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,790
You asked.

87
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:00,830
Oh, and...

88
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:03,600
the CEO has three children.

89
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,610
- One of them is at our schoolâ€” 
 - Oh, I have to go.

90
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:08,540
Anyway, thank you. See you at school.

91
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:10,900
I'll take this.

92
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:18,040
There's one more person.

93
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:40,890
   

94
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,580
What's going on?

95
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,770
I heard what happened from Lee Jae Hee.

96
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:56,160
What did Director Gu say?

97
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,210
Is she going to do something about it now?

98
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:02,310
Well. Nothing really happened.

99
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:04,530
I just got what I needed back.

100
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:06,620
That keychain?

101
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:12,450
I heard Gong Ki Joon asking for it from Mr. Lee a few days ago.

102
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:14,850
He said he tried to get it back for you.

103
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:17,230
He said it was important to you.

104
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,010
Even if Director Gu knows you threw the flowerpot,

105
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:24,080
she couldn't do anything about it now.

106
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,720
So stay low at school and don't stand out.

107
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,590
Is that why you called me here?

108
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:31,100
What?

109
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,010
Yes.

110
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:40,000
Kang Seo Young, stop getting involved.

111
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,490
I'm saying this because I'm worried about you.

112
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:45,520
I'll take care of myself.

113
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:50,090
I mean it.

114
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:52,220
I'll get going.

115
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:02,660
 I heard Gong Ki Joon asking for it from Mr. Lee a few days ago. 

116
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:04,520
 He said he tried to get it back for you. 

117
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,970
 He said it was important to you. 

118
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:13,580
You're home, Hyung.

119
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:15,330
Hey.

120
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:18,580
Are you coming back from somewhere?

121
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:22,240
I met up with a friend from another school

122
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,090
who did practical training on-site with me.

123
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,280
What did he say?

124
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,580
He said he doesn't really remember.

125
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:39,300
He remembers me getting in an accident but wasn't sure about the aerial work.

126
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:41,990
That's bad news.

127
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:45,120
Didn't we ask everyone we could think of?

128
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,390
You said Mr. Lee Kang Hoon worked with you.

129
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:53,160
- We should stillâ€” 
 - Not Supervisor Lee.

130
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,420
It'll put him in a difficult position.

131
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:00,920
Let's not just think of ourselves, Young Joo.

132
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:08,310
Good morning.

133
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:10,570
Does no one in this class want to do it?

134
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:14,070
No. No one was interested.

135
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:17,140
So are you in charge of them again, Mr. Lee?

136
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,620
I don't think I will.

137
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,490
The students don't want to do it with me.

138
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:23,790
Really?

139
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:25,700
Who?

140
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,340
So...

141
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:30,010
Him.

142
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:40,070
I apologize about the day of the competition.

143
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:42,770
Wow! Seriously.

144
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:45,220
You acted like you were going to destroy me.

145
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:49,100
You get angry, then stop being angry on your own. What is this?

146
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:53,300
I was mistaken.

147
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:56,640
I'm sorry.

148
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,720
All right.

149
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,710
I don't know how you found out,

150
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:08,200
but the truth was meant to come out.

151
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,840
Is that why you're here?

152
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,580
Well...

153
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:20,400
You asked why I threw that flowerpot on Director Gu's car.

154
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:26,710
It was because of my brother's trial.

155
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,160
I guessed as much.

156
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,090
My brother...

157
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:40,580
got into an accident when he was a student here, training on-site.

158
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:46,090
The school not only ignores it,

159
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:48,840
but is actively taking the side of the company.

160
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:54,820
The trial will wrap up soon, but it's not looking good for us.

161
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,030
We're desperate...

162
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:01,190
for a single testimony. For any evidence.

163
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:05,950
Could I ask for your help?

164
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,360
I'll think about it, but...

165
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,960
don't ever do something like throwing flowerpots again.

166
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,270
It doesn't help at all. All right?

167
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:21,770
Okay.

168
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:32,900
Hey, but... there are a lot of cover dance videos.

169
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,760
Will people watch my video?

170
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:39,320
Eun Bi. Your dancing is special. Trust me.

171
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,950
My dream is to become the CEO of an entertainment company.

172
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:43,210
Nonsense.

173
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:46,140
What was it last week? Luxury goods analyst?

174
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,360
You said that was your dream.

175
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,750
Finished!

176
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:52,660
Eun Bi, you just dance while looking at this.

177
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,670
What is this? It's this number again.

178
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:00,250
What is it?

179
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:01,830
I don't know.

180
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:05,200
Hello?

181
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:08,170
What is it? A prank call?

182
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:11,390
I think so. They always hang up when I pick up.

183
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:15,330
Whatever. Let's not think about this and focus on what we need to do.

184
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:16,880
All right.

185
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:21,150
Hold on, hold on.

186
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:23,170
What is it again?

187
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:52,840
Okay, we're really going to start now.

188
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,240
Hey, I can't do it.

189
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,280
What? Why?

190
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,070
I'm nervous.

191
00:12:57,070 --> 00:13:01,040
Come on. It's not like you to be nervous. You did well on even bigger stages.

192
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,770
That's not it... Come here.

193
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:28,820
I think I'm crazy.

194
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,720
I'm leaving.

195
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:35,200
Where are you going? Eun Bi? Eun Bi?

196
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:40,770
Aren't you Young Joo?

197
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:45,170
You are.

198
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:56,440
It's really okay. Thank you.

199
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,860
Did you come out for groceries?

200
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,360
Yes.

201
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,000
I just bought some seaweed and beef. 
  (T/N: seaweed soup is eaten on birthdays) 

202
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,230
You also had your birthday not long ago, right?

203
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:11,960
You had a similar birthday to my Gyeong Min.

204
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:20,840
I hope it's not uncomfortable for you to see me.

205
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:25,090
Not at all. It's good to see you after such a long time.

206
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:29,930
You grew up so well, Young Joo, saying things like that.

207
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:32,310
I'm glad to see you, too.

208
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:39,170
We're moving away soon.

209
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:42,380
I meant to see you before then.

210
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:47,210
Oh, right.

211
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,370
How does it look? Does it suit me?

212
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:54,490
Yes.

213
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:57,710
You've been sending this to me every year, right?

214
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:03,640
You don't have to do it anymore. How could a student like you have the money?

215
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:06,830
I'm grateful just for your thought. Really.

216
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:10,620
   

217
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,110
Welcome, Ki Joon.

218
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:13,770
Hey, Ki Joon.

219
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:15,460
Is Jung Young Joo not here?

220
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:17,620
No. He's on an errand.

221
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,480
It's delicious.

222
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:32,320
Yes, Lawyer Lee.

223
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:37,120
Yes. It can't be helped.

224
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,330
I'll ask around for more people who could make a statement.

225
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:43,680
All right. I'll see you on the day of the trial.

226
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:50,890
- Is something going on? 
 - Yes.

227
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:54,480
- The lawsuit for my injury. 
 - I see.

228
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,680
I think I heard about it long ago. Hasn't it ended?

229
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,830
It's still going. I'm so sick of it.

230
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:07,840
How are things with Young Joo? Did nothing happen in school?

231
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,590
No, just...

232
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:12,630
the usual.

233
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:16,870
Actually, Sang Rim is the site where I got injured.

234
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:19,610
- The same foundation as Nulji High. 
 - I see.

235
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:23,410
The foundation is making the lawsuit difficult,

236
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:26,810
so I think Young Joo is angry at the school because of it.

237
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:28,790
I'm worried.

238
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:32,620
I can't imagine why he chose to go to Nulji High.

239
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:35,890
 Why did you throw the flowerpot? 

240
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,660
 Is it related to why you came to this school? 

241
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,480
 You don't need to know that. 

242
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:46,670
Still, I was relieved to hear that you were in the same class as him.

243
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:51,080
Young Joo doesn't seem to think so.

244
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,910
Be a bit more understanding.

245
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:56,710
Although he may not act like it, Young Joo used to really like you.

246
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:58,680
I know that well.

247
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,250
No way.

248
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:05,790
I wish both of you could laugh freely

249
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:09,900
and play pranks on me like you used to.

250
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:31,120
Aigoo, you surprised me.

251
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,740
You...

252
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:37,290
Good evening.

253
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:39,000
- My, you're late. 
 - Yes.

254
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,410
Alright.

255
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:41,940
I told you to listen on your phone.

256
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:45,980
Aigoo. The volume's too low, so it's no use.

257
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,500
Why did you come here?

258
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:52,140
You should go home and rest. You must be tired from working.

259
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:58,210
I packed up a burger to give you and I realized your shift was just about to end.

260
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:00,000
I'm here to walk home with you.

261
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,280
Which one is it today?

262
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,590
I didn't care for that chicken burger.

263
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:07,810
It's a double cheeseburger today.

264
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:09,780
Nice!

265
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,480
 Young Joo. 

266
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,090
 Don't talk to me, you bastard. 

267
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:22,530
 I don't want to die. 

268
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:25,010
 Say that again. Fun? 

269
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:27,330
 You used to cling to it so pretentiously! 

270
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:30,320
 Young Joo used to really like you. 

271
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,200
 I know that well. 

272
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:37,930
Sigh deeper, why don't you?

273
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:39,570
What is it again?

274
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,400
- Did something happen? 
 - What?

275
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,700
No, it's nothing.

276
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:51,930
Why are you taking that? You should just throw it away.

277
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:53,850
It's too old.

278
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:55,430
How could I do that?

279
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:58,980
This one and I have a history together.

280
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:00,500
Still.

281
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:04,200
It's telling you to let it go. It says it's been tiring all these years.

282
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:08,980
No way. It's begging me to look at it one more time.

283
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:12,060
Then what will you do?

284
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:14,720
I'll take it apart and fix it.

285
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,900
Don't bang on it randomly.

286
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:21,400
Even if it's tough, it's better to open it up, see what went wrong,

287
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:25,400
and fix it to turn on again.

288
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,450
But what if you make it worse?

289
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:31,450
That's then. You have to try first.

290
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:34,820
Why? Do you want to fix something, too?

291
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:55,000
What are you doing?

292
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:11,120
Why did you buy so much of the same flavored milk?

293
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:19,210
A friend of mine who's obsessed with it has a birthday tomorrow.

294
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:21,050
A friend's birthday?

295
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,990
Isn't this too crude for a birthday gift?

296
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:29,010
This is enough for him. He would love it.

297
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:32,550
A true friend of Gong Ki Joon's.

298
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:36,130
What about with Young Joo?

299
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:40,410
Are you going to keep being like that with him? You guys should make up.

300
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:42,850
I was planning on it anyway.

301
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:44,600
Really?

302
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,350
What's this? Did you suddenly grow up?

303
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:50,060
Just...

304
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:53,450
I think I was banging on things randomly.

305
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:57,780
I won't be afraid. I'll open it up properly and fix things.

306
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,200
What does that mean?

307
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:04,420
A child like you doesn't need to know.

308
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:09,460
I'm going.

309
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,300
You have to do it like this.

310
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,860
Hey, isn't that Seo Young?

311
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,470
Seo Young.

312
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:36,650
What is it again?

313
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:38,740
Are you still dating him?

314
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:41,220
Why are you guys together for so long?

315
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:43,180
There's nothing to like about him.

316
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:45,810
He looks kind of boring.

317
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,180
When will you break up with him?

318
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:49,430
I won't break up with him.

319
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:52,240
Come on. Why not?

320
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,960
Geez, Gong Ki Joon, that little...

321
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:04,320
Tae Kang. Didn't he quit taekwondo because he hurt his ankle?

322
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,340
He seems totally fine.

323
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:06,610
Injury my ass.

324
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:08,860
He was kicked out because he had no talent.

325
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,510
His ankle healed a long time ago.

326
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:12,170
Really?

327
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:15,960
What did you just say?

328
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,730
Wh-What?

329
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:19,850
About you being ugly?

330
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:21,800
Did Gong Ki Joon say that?

331
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,110
That he quit because it wasn't fun anymore?

332
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:27,700
He will say anything to sound tough.

333
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:31,350
He dropped out of every competition. Even I felt bad for him.

334
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:37,050
 What's the point of working hard? 

335
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:39,310
 He has no talent. 

336
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:42,630
Like this.

337
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:44,760
 Why did you quit? 

338
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,770
 Just because. 

339
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:47,350
 Are you not going to do it again? 

340
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:49,870
 No. It's not fun anymore. 

341
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:51,280
 Fun my ass. 

342
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,700
 He was kicked out. He probably knows that, too. 

343
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:56,350
Gong Ki Joon.

344
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:03,310
Hey, Jung Young Joo! School hasn't ended yet. Where are you going?

345
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:05,640
Is he allowed to do that?

346
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,840
You're here.

347
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:26,230
Did you came here empty-handed on a friend's birthday?

348
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:27,980
That's harsh.

349
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:33,370
You remember Gyeong Min liked that, right?

350
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:39,140
Why are you here?

351
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:41,250
Probably the same reason as you.

352
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,010
You shameless bastard.

353
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:47,830
Get lost.

354
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,230
I don't want to.

355
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:57,000
I came here because I knew you would come.

356
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,940
You're always avoiding me. You can't run from here.

357
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,460
How dare you come here.

358
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:07,900
I come here every year.

359
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:10,580
You're the one who ran away.

360
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:12,670
From taekwondo,

361
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:14,840
from this town,

362
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:17,110
and from Gyeong Min.

363
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:21,530
Don't you dare speak his name.

364
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:24,840
If it weren't for you, Gyeong Min would still be alive.

365
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:28,500
Fine. Maybe he would be.

366
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:32,080
If I hadn't suggested that bet then,

367
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,980
Gyeong Min might not have died.

368
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:36,270
- What? 
 - And...

369
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:39,860
if I hadn't dragged you out by force,

370
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:43,730
you could have died, too.

371
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:45,850
You bastard!

372
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,110
Just stop it, you bastard!

373
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:56,620
Does it make you feel better to put the blame on me?

374
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:59,720
It doesn't. You're suffering, too!

375
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,440
Shut up!

376
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,140
 Hey, Gyeong Min! 

377
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:16,960
 Cha Gyeong Min! 

378
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,610
 Hey! 

379
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:22,650
 I beat Jung Young Joo. 

380
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:27,690
 Hey, Cha Gyeong Min! I won the gold medal! 

381
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:29,430
 Geez. 

382
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:33,710
 I could have won first place. 

383
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:35,900
 Hey. 

384
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,850
 Thank you. 

385
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:44,060
 Hey. Let's do it one more time. 

386
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:47,540
 That Gong Ki Joon's on a roll again. 

387
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,580
 This time, let's go to the buoy. 

388
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:55,070
 How does that sound? 

389
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:57,700
 - Geez. 
 - Isn't that too far? 

390
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:01,070
 - I'm tired. 
 - It looks dangerous. 

391
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:02,520
 No way. 

392
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:05,270
 What's dangerous about it? Are you scared? 

393
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:07,330
 If you're scared, you can be last place. 

394
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:10,840
 - You can do it, right? 
 - It looks tough. 

395
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:15,280
 I'm going first! 

396
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:18,040
 Why is he like that? Gosh... 

397
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:20,080
 Come on, hurry! 

398
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:23,250
 Hey! Hey! 

399
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:25,870
 You're last place! 

400
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:27,890
 Hey! 

401
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:30,110
 - Wow! 
 - Hey! 

402
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:51,330
 I'm first! 

403
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:53,620
 I'm first. 

404
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:56,150
 Hey, Jung Young Joo. I'm in the first place. 

405
00:26:56,150 --> 00:27:00,170
 - Happy now? 
 - I'm so happy to win first place. 

406
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:03,000
 Ridiculous. You started early. 

407
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,680
 It's all talent. 

408
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,600
 So tired. 

409
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,860
 Where's Gyeong Min? 

410
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:14,360
 Gyeong Min? 

411
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:18,660
 - Hey, Cha Gyeong Min! 
 - Hey, Cha Gyeong Min! 

412
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:20,320
 Don't mess around and come up! 

413
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:24,050
 Hey, Cha Gyeong Min! Hey, Cha Gyeong Min! 

414
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:25,510
 Wait... 

415
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:27,140
 Cha Gyeong Min! 

416
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:28,560
 No, Young Joo. 

417
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,240
 Gyeong Min! 

418
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,270
 - No. 
 - Gyeong Min! 

419
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:34,820
 Let me go! 

420
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,570
 - No! 
 - Gyeong Min! 

421
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:38,140
 Gyeong Min's already gone. 

422
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:41,350
 - Gyeong Min! 
 - You'll be in danger too. 

423
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:44,930
 Gyeong Min! Let me go! 

424
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:46,150
 Don't. 

425
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:49,740
 - No! 
 - Cha Gyeong Min! 

426
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:53,830
 Let me go! 

427
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:58,850
 Cha Gyeong Min. 

428
00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:01,360
 No. 

429
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,330
 No! 

430
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:06,480
 Cha Gyeong Min! 

431
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,490
 No. 

432
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:11,920
 No. No. No! 

433
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:15,980
 Cha Gyeong Min. 

434
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,980
 No. 

435
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:27,290
 Gyeong Min! 

436
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,800
 Gong Ki Joon is here. 

437
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,190
 Did he kill Gyeong Min and still came out to the competition? 

438
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:52,670
 - I know. 
 - How could he? 

439
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:56,250
 - Why is he here? 
 - The audacity. 

440
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:59,040
 - Seriously. 
 - So annoying. 

441
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:02,230
 Let's go! 

442
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:30,360
Why didn't you come to the funeral?

443
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:35,360
I can't forgive you even for that.

444
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:55,050
Thank you.

445
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:07,320
Ki Joon, could you go out first and wait for me?

446
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,580
You grew a lot.

447
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:26,770
I saw you a few times in middle school.

448
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:28,860
Do you remember?

449
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,570
Yes.

450
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:32,010
I'm sorry.

451
00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:33,910
Yes.

452
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:38,050
I'm a selfish grandfather who only cares about his grandson,

453
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:40,700
so I want to take his side.

454
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:43,130
Young Joo.

455
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:46,420
Ki Joon...

456
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:48,970
suffered for a long time, too.

457
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:54,350
After that day, that kid's facial expression changed.

458
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:56,510
I'm sure you were the same.

459
00:30:56,510 --> 00:31:01,470
But you two are the only ones who can understand each other's pain.

460
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:06,600
Ki Joon is naturally foolish, so he only knows how to hold his ground.

461
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,180
So I ask you to take pity on him.

462
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:14,130
What are friends for? You have sympathy and pity for each other.

463
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:16,380
That's what friends do.

464
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:20,510
Still.

465
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:24,370
It's good to see you.

466
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:47,540
How ugly you are.

467
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:55,060
Are you all right?

468
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,640
Yes.

469
00:31:58,430 --> 00:32:00,220
It feels good.

470
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,550
- Here. Right here. 
 - Wait, wait.

471
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:06,110
Come now, just here. Hold still.

472
00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:09,780
Hold still.

473
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:18,380
 Gyeong Min used to gift me 

474
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:21,220
 a scarf like this on my birthdays. 

475
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:23,690
 You know that, don't you? 

476
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:28,980
 The three of you once gathered money together to buy it for me. 

477
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:32,950
 But... even after Gyeong Min left us, 

478
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:36,400
 this was sent to our house every birthday. 

479
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:40,240
 I thought it was you for sure. 

480
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:42,730
 You're the one who ran away. 

481
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:45,700
 From taekwondo, from this town, 

482
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:48,120
 and from Gyeong Min. 

483
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:55,300
 Ki Joon is naturally foolish, so he only knows how to hold his ground. 

484
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:59,300
 So I ask you to take pity on him. 

485
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:22,200
 Really? 

486
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,700
Did she hurt herself badly?

487
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:27,270
I'll have to become my mom's shadow for a while.

488
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:29,370
I can't join the club with you.

489
00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:30,550
I'm really sorry.

490
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:33,390
It's all right. Can't be helped.

491
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:36,840
Then what do we do? Should we just do with five people?

492
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:41,000
Well, that could work too, but it's a waste.

493
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,930
We have fewer people than the other school teams.

494
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:46,020
Ki Joon wanted to do it.

495
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:48,660
Let's talk to Young Joo again.

496
00:33:55,810 --> 00:33:58,510
Hey. You...

497
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:06,190
Did you guys fight again?

498
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:45,460
What a group...

499
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:47,480
Is this going to work?

500
00:34:55,620 --> 00:35:00,400
Aigoo. Every time you guys make a club, it's the same lot.

501
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,790
Sit down.

502
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:03,070
We might grow to be fond of each other.

503
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:04,810
We see each other too often.

504
00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:09,540
I gathered only the best.

505
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:11,350
Is that so?

506
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:12,870
Of course.

507
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:17,140
All right. Anyway, there's not much I can do for you.

508
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:19,880
This time, you guys make a plan on your own.

509
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:22,860
I'll just be helping. So just...

510
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:25,480
think of me as a bridge.

511
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:28,340
Baro Furniture is pretty enthusiastic

512
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:29,960
and it's a good opportunity.

513
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:32,330
However it turns out, let's do our best.

514
00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:36,270
Is this all of you?

515
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:38,630
Didn't you say there are six people?

516
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:48,940
Wow.

517
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:52,230
I should have expected it.

518
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:55,410
What are you doing? Sit.

519
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,610
Let's begin.

520
00:36:09,370 --> 00:36:11,200
I think my lunch isn't digesting.

521
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,250
What's happening?

522
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:16,610
Are you okay?

523
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,410
It's all because of you guys.

524
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:21,180
What?

525
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:24,490
When Ki Joon came to the club room earlier,

526
00:36:24,490 --> 00:36:28,020
I was so nervous you guys would start fighting again.

527
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:29,450
I see.

528
00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:32,890
I already knew you didn't like Ki Joon.

529
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:37,780
When I realized you guys fought this morning, I knew you'd never let him join us.

530
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:43,080
Did you have a change of heart?

531
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:49,240
I just don't care anymore.

532
00:36:50,570 --> 00:36:52,730
Anyway.

533
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:55,420
Thank you for letting Ki Joon in.

534
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,640
You always talk about Gong Ki Joon when you see me.

535
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:04,380
Do I?

536
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:08,230
Are you using the bench that I helped carry last time?

537
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:09,220
Yeah.

538
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:11,190
The view is great from the rooftop of our house.

539
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:12,620
It was already great,

540
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:16,290
but seeing it from the bench I made is really the cherry on top.

541
00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:21,200
It's like I zone out watching the sunset.

542
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:25,100
- Makes me curious. 
 - Really?

543
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,980
If we go now, it'd be perfect timing. Do you want to go?

544
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:58,920
You should probably rest. Aren't I keeping you from resting?

545
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:03,410
No. I took medicine, so it'll go down soon.

546
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:11,910
How is it? To die for, right?

547
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:17,120
It's nice.

548
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:24,510
Does Gong Ki Joon come up here often?

549
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:25,720
Yeah.

550
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,540
He's up here a lot.

551
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:31,060
Ki Joon's grandfather was a really famous carpenter,

552
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:35,910
so he teaches Ki Joon and me carpentry here.

553
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:39,410
Ki Joon's grandfather was the reason why

554
00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:41,860
I decided to become a carpenter at a young age.

555
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:43,800
I see.

556
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:49,420
Why does Gong Ki Joon live here?

557
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:52,400
I remember his family being well off.

558
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,700
Hey.

559
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:58,960
I think you talk more about Gong Ki Joon than I do.

560
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:02,420
Ask him yourself.

561
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:04,750
And stop fighting.

562
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:14,790
Are you still not feeling well?

563
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:16,770
A little.

564
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:21,450
This won't do. Do you have a needle and thread in your house?

565
00:39:21,450 --> 00:39:24,300
Yes. Why?

566
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:30,160
Are you...

567
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:37,700
Don't hesitate.

568
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,640
Just do it in one go.

569
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,210
Okay.

570
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:05,130
I'm doing it.

571
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:09,210
W-Wait.

572
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:17,890
Okay. Do it.

573
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:20,760
I'm really doing it.

574
00:40:42,050 --> 00:40:47,430
â™«  Even though I try to think of something else  â™«

575
00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:54,560
â™«  My brain won't listen to me  â™«

576
00:40:56,250 --> 00:41:03,010
â™«  Your every little thing  â™«

577
00:41:03,010 --> 00:41:08,170
â™«  I like all of them, what can I do?  â™«

578
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:09,560
What is it?

579
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,890
Did it work?

580
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,700
Wait.

581
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:20,350
I just felt like something went down.

582
00:41:20,350 --> 00:41:22,730
Am I imagining things?

583
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:26,600
Oh. Wow, it really did!

584
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:31,030
Hey, you're really good at everything.

585
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:35,060
Wow. The blood is so black.

586
00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:43,860
â™«  What do I do with my heart that keeps liking you?  â™«

587
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:50,950
â™«  What do I do when I can't hide it?  â™«

588
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:56,270
â™«  They say that's how it all begins  â™«

589
00:41:56,270 --> 00:42:01,440
â™«  Hesitating, not knowing what to do  â™«

590
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:04,200
Gosh, I feel so refreshed.

591
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:18,700
So wonderful, Eun Bi!

592
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:21,480
Right? I can't understand why they fired me.

593
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:25,410
It's so fun to hang out with you after such a long time, Eun Bi.

594
00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:29,120
I've been here almost thirty years,

595
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:33,750
but you're the first one who considers the orphanage your friend's home and visits.

596
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:37,210
I asked if I could come, and she said yes, so coolly.

597
00:42:37,210 --> 00:42:39,850
She told me to come over, and she just studies like that.

598
00:42:39,850 --> 00:42:42,160
Gosh, what a crazy nut.

599
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,390
I can hear you.

600
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:51,680
When did I tell you to come? You said you wanted to.

601
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:53,440
Those headphones are for show, aren't they?

602
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,360
You don't even listen to music, right?

603
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:57,300
It's for canceling out noise.

604
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:59,510
It's annoying to have someone talk to me.

605
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:01,570
Gosh. Chills.

606
00:43:01,570 --> 00:43:04,070
I'm doing you a favor by being your friend.

607
00:43:04,070 --> 00:43:08,330
Come now. There's Seo Young's boyfriend.

608
00:43:08,330 --> 00:43:11,400
I know how Seo Young can be,

609
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:16,010
but my goodness, I was so shocked to hear that she had a boyfriend.

610
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:19,830
Oh, did you give him his present?

611
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:24,150
Yes.

612
00:43:24,150 --> 00:43:26,200
- I guess... 
 - Present?

613
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:28,910
She prepared a gift for her boyfriend's birthday

614
00:43:28,910 --> 00:43:32,840
and I wrapped it really nicely.

615
00:43:34,310 --> 00:43:35,970
Is that true?

616
00:43:35,970 --> 00:43:39,360
Did you give a present to another person?

617
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:41,870
Whatever.

618
00:43:43,090 --> 00:43:44,980
Aren't you leaving?

619
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:47,230
Hurry and come out. I'm late.

620
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:53,230
That girl... It must be real.

621
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:02,100
 Wow. The blood is so black. 

622
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:29,790
   

623
00:44:42,250 --> 00:44:46,540
Why do you always go with Mom and Dad on their wedding anniversary?

624
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:50,870
This hotel room may suck, but the breakfast buffet is amazing.

625
00:44:50,870 --> 00:44:52,750
Poor high schooler.

626
00:44:52,750 --> 00:44:54,720
Have fun guarding the house.

627
00:44:55,570 --> 00:44:57,640
I'm sorry, Ji Won.

628
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:59,870
Once you graduate, let's all go together.

629
00:44:59,870 --> 00:45:02,090
Gosh, I'm okay.

630
00:45:02,090 --> 00:45:05,900
Do have a great time, you two.

631
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:07,600
Hey, you have no idea.

632
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:09,350
Mom and Dad get awkward by themselves.

633
00:45:09,350 --> 00:45:12,800
Come on. That's not true.

634
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:15,580
We'll be going.

635
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:18,840
- Call us if anything happens. 
 - Okay.

636
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:28,190
What do you want to know now?

637
00:45:28,190 --> 00:45:31,550
Gosh! It's so convenient that you're so quick witted.

638
00:45:31,550 --> 00:45:34,970
So? What did you get your fake boyfriend?

639
00:45:34,970 --> 00:45:36,450
Motorbike gloves.

640
00:45:36,450 --> 00:45:38,600
What? Why gloves?

641
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:41,470
He hurt his hand riding his motorbike.

642
00:45:41,470 --> 00:45:47,050
Oh, I see... He hurt his hand?

643
00:45:48,190 --> 00:45:50,100
It's Young Joo.

644
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:56,890
I guess not.

645
00:46:00,950 --> 00:46:03,140
How disappointing.

646
00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:06,530
When I talk to you, you don't even look at me.

647
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:18,100
I can't find the key.

648
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:20,290
What do I do?

649
00:46:20,290 --> 00:46:24,200
 This is why I told you not to forget it. 

650
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:27,340
We always had one under the pot for emergencies.

651
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:31,160
 I think your sister used it a few days ago and left it in her room. 

652
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:32,820
Come on now...

653
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:35,420
I keep telling you we should change it to a pin pad.

654
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:38,380
 Why are you taking it out on me when you misplaced it? 

655
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:41,640
 It's late today, so stay over upstairs for the night. 

656
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:44,380
 I spoke to Grandpa already. 

657
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:46,060
How could I do that?

658
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:47,590
 What do you mean, how could you? 

659
00:46:47,590 --> 00:46:48,880
Hey.

660
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:50,670
What are you doing?

661
00:46:50,670 --> 00:46:52,480
Come up.

662
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:54,150
M-Mom?

663
00:46:54,150 --> 00:46:56,850
Mom! Gosh...

664
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:12,530
- Put it on. 
 - Okay.

665
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:15,420
Where's Grandpa?

666
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:17,660
He left a little while ago.

667
00:47:18,990 --> 00:47:21,090
He works the night shift tonight.

668
00:47:21,090 --> 00:47:22,780
I see.

669
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:41,630
Well...

670
00:47:41,630 --> 00:47:43,820
I laid out clean sheets.

671
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:45,370
You can sleep in my room.

672
00:47:45,370 --> 00:47:48,140
I can sleep in the living room.

673
00:47:48,140 --> 00:47:50,070
Oh, okay.

674
00:47:50,070 --> 00:47:51,900
Thanks.

675
00:47:57,150 --> 00:47:59,760
So are you going to sleep now?

676
00:48:01,130 --> 00:48:02,170
Yes.

677
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:05,440
I'm tired from work.

678
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:08,090
Oh. Okay.

679
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:12,730
Hey, did you prepare for the presentation tomorrow?

680
00:48:12,730 --> 00:48:14,460
No.

681
00:48:28,630 --> 00:48:30,270
Wow.

682
00:48:30,270 --> 00:48:33,400
You have better pictures than me.

683
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:35,770
Send me some of the pictures you took.

684
00:48:35,770 --> 00:48:37,360
Why?

685
00:48:39,510 --> 00:48:43,410
You and I have different content for our assignments anyway.

686
00:48:43,410 --> 00:48:47,240
You don't want to? I just want to keep it for documenting purposes.

687
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:50,030
Fine.

688
00:48:50,030 --> 00:48:52,810
I'll send some after I go through them.

689
00:49:02,530 --> 00:49:06,200
But you have nothing ready when tomorrow's the presentation?

690
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:08,940
I was just going to whip up something on the spot.

691
00:49:11,530 --> 00:49:15,460
Even though it was far, I'm glad we went there.

692
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:16,840
What about you?

693
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:19,280
I guess, me too.

694
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:26,370
So I was wondering, why did you follow me that day?

695
00:49:27,410 --> 00:49:29,740
I told you already.

696
00:49:29,740 --> 00:49:32,250
I had nothing better to do.

697
00:49:32,250 --> 00:49:34,310
I went along because I was bored.

698
00:49:34,310 --> 00:49:37,170
- That was really it? 
 - Why?

699
00:49:37,170 --> 00:49:39,090
Am I not allowed?

700
00:50:01,580 --> 00:50:03,380
What are you thinking about on your own again?

701
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:04,500
Oh?

702
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:07,660
What do you mean?

703
00:50:10,060 --> 00:50:11,850
I'm just...

704
00:50:12,620 --> 00:50:16,290
thinking that you and I keep getting involved

705
00:50:16,290 --> 00:50:18,860
as enemies.

706
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:22,310
I didn't think I'd ever see you again after elementary school.

707
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:27,250
Same school, same house.

708
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:33,220
Since you brought it up,

709
00:50:34,590 --> 00:50:38,420
I wanted to ask you this at some point.

710
00:50:40,350 --> 00:50:41,710
Ask what?

711
00:50:41,710 --> 00:50:43,100
Why...

712
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:49,240
Why did you punch me back then?

713
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:55,100
What's the point of asking now?

714
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:58,620
It's just the biggest mystery of my life.

715
00:50:58,620 --> 00:51:00,640
You were definitely...

716
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:03,760
- Up until then, you wereâ€” 
 - Hey. Forget about it.

717
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:07,430
Why talk about snot-nosed childhood we can't even remember?

718
00:51:07,430 --> 00:51:09,290
Just do your homework.

719
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:22,780
   

720
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:44,600
â™«  I want to know your thoughts because I can't read them  â™«

721
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:55,160
â™«  I get nervous sometimes because I like you  â™«

722
00:51:58,090 --> 00:52:05,580
â™«  I want to see the swaying waves  â™«

723
00:52:08,730 --> 00:52:16,410
â™«  I want to see you more on my way there  â™«

724
00:52:19,070 --> 00:52:29,100
â™«  The day passes by again  â™«

725
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:38,380
â™«  During that time, my heart isn't my own  â™«

726
00:52:40,420 --> 00:52:45,460
â™«  I think about you  â™«

727
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:50,620
â™«  And it makes me happy  â™«

728
00:52:50,620 --> 00:52:59,180
â™«  Then, in the next moment, I ache  â™«

729
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:14,910
Sleep inside.

730
00:53:18,940 --> 00:53:20,680
Okay.

731
00:54:05,290 --> 00:54:07,590
Geez.

732
00:54:15,810 --> 00:54:18,860
-  Yes?  
 - You should get up now.

733
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:22,000
Why are you calling me?

734
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:23,480
I'm already at school.

735
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:24,660
What?

736
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:29,610
Already?

737
00:54:29,610 --> 00:54:31,220
- Why? 
 - What?

738
00:54:32,090 --> 00:54:35,470
Well, I just couldn't sleep.

739
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:40,200
Anyway, there's a USB on my desk.

740
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:41,790
 Can you bring that for me? 

741
00:54:41,790 --> 00:54:43,560
 I left it by accident. 

742
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:45,560
I saved the assignment on it last night.

743
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:48,830
Okay. Got it.

744
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:02,370
Where is it?

745
00:55:08,550 --> 00:55:12,780
    
 Geez. I should burn it.

746
00:55:31,490 --> 00:55:33,070
 To Ji Won. 

747
00:55:33,070 --> 00:55:34,780
 I like you too. 

748
00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:36,820
 Gong Ki Joon. 

749
00:55:38,420 --> 00:55:42,450
As I have explained, the Bosung Seowon was originally a shrine for ancestral rites.

750
00:55:42,450 --> 00:55:44,770
But it was changed into a school later on,

751
00:55:44,770 --> 00:55:49,320
so it has characteristics that are different from regular schools.

752
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:54,060
That's the end of my research presentation on Bosung Seowon's architecture.

753
00:56:05,380 --> 00:56:07,080
- Wait. 
 - Is that Ji Won?

754
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:07,970
Jin Ji Won?

755
00:56:07,970 --> 00:56:09,610
What? That's Ji Won.

756
00:56:09,610 --> 00:56:11,290
- Wow. 
 - It's Jin Ji Won.

757
00:56:11,290 --> 00:56:12,910
- You little! 
 - Is that her?

758
00:56:12,910 --> 00:56:14,660
Did they go together?

759
00:56:14,660 --> 00:56:16,140
Did they go on a date?

760
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:18,690
- What's this? Did you go together? 
 - What's with that picture?

761
00:56:18,690 --> 00:56:21,510
Maybe you guys didn't just go on a field trip together.

762
00:56:21,510 --> 00:56:24,040
Oh, my God!

763
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:25,920
Hey, turn it off!

764
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:28,460
- Hurry and turn it off! 
 - Okay.

765
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:29,950
- Wow! 
 - Oh, my God!

766
00:56:29,950 --> 00:56:32,190
So romantic!

767
00:56:33,010 --> 00:56:34,960
Ki Joon.

768
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:37,820
What a way to end your presentation.

769
00:56:37,820 --> 00:56:40,350
I forgot to delete the last slide yesterday.

770
00:56:40,350 --> 00:56:41,580
I f-forgot.

771
00:56:41,580 --> 00:56:43,880
Not at all. It was great.

772
00:56:45,190 --> 00:56:47,000
It was great for me too.

773
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,920
So who is next?

774
00:56:50,860 --> 00:56:53,740
What's up with those two?

775
00:57:18,740 --> 00:57:21,280
Thank you.

776
00:57:34,130 --> 00:57:35,610
 Maybe they went on a date. 

777
00:57:35,610 --> 00:57:38,820
 - What's going on? 
 - Wow... 

778
00:57:39,670 --> 00:57:44,840
â™«  Even though I try to think of something else  â™«

779
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:51,260
â™«  My brain won't listen to me  â™«

780
00:57:53,660 --> 00:58:00,700
â™«  Your every little thing  â™«

781
00:58:00,700 --> 00:58:05,560
â™«  I like all of them, what can I do?  â™«

782
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:15,330
â™«  Because your smiles every day are a little bit different  â™«

783
00:58:15,330 --> 00:58:19,560
â™«  I like every single day  â™«

784
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:28,040
â™«  When I happen to pass by you  â™«

785
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:34,680
â™«  My heart beats loudly  â™«

786
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:41,440
â™«  What do I do with my heart that keeps liking you?  â™«

787
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:48,430
â™«  What do I do when I can't hide it?  â™«

788
00:58:48,430 --> 00:58:53,700
â™«  They say that's how it all begins  â™«

789
00:58:53,700 --> 00:59:02,400
â™«  Hesitating, not knowing what to do  â™«

790
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:09,570
â™«  What do I do with my heart that keeps beating loudly?  â™«

791
00:59:09,570 --> 00:59:16,370
â™«  You probably already know it all, what do I do?  â™«

792
00:59:16,370 --> 00:59:18,300
Yes.

793
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:20,180
Can I see you for a second?

794
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:24,210
I have something to say to you.

795
00:59:25,510 --> 00:59:30,450
â™«  The heart that can't do anything  â™«

796
00:59:32,650 --> 00:59:38,770
â™«  I like you. What can I do?  â™«

797
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:13,370
What is it? Why are you asking to see me at this hour?

798
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:20,110
What is it?

799
01:00:21,030 --> 01:00:22,620
Is something wrong?

800
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:26,330
It's nothing serious.

801
01:00:27,510 --> 01:00:30,140
Did you eat?

802
01:00:30,140 --> 01:00:31,630
Yes.

803
01:00:35,530 --> 01:00:38,050
You worked late today.

804
01:00:38,050 --> 01:00:41,060
Well... I guess a little?

805
01:00:41,830 --> 01:00:44,710
Is that why you called me here?

806
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:51,340
I have something to say to you.

807
01:00:51,340 --> 01:00:53,980
I thought I should say it in person.

808
01:00:53,980 --> 01:00:55,940
What is it?

809
01:00:55,940 --> 01:00:58,320
You could've told me tomorrow morning.

810
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:09,510
Hey.

811
01:01:12,070 --> 01:01:13,880
I think...

812
01:01:15,820 --> 01:01:18,680
I like you.

814
01:01:28,550 --> 01:01:30,170
I think...

815
01:01:31,220 --> 01:01:32,730
we should end this.

01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:13,270
â™«  Dream on, dream on, dream on  â™«

824
01:02:13,270 --> 01:02:19,390
â™«  I'll grow closer to you  â™«

825
01:02:19,390 --> 01:02:25,890
â™«  The afternoon sun shimmers on the windowsill  â™«

826
01:02:27,660 --> 01:02:34,040
â™«  You shine somewhere in the distance  â™«

827
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:36,150
â™«  Tell me what you wanna be  â™«

828
01:02:36,150 --> 01:02:38,190
â™«  You know that I wanna see  â™«

829
01:02:38,190 --> 01:02:42,030
â™«  I guess you don't know me yet  â™«

830
01:02:42,030 --> 01:02:45,010
   

831
01:02:45,580 --> 01:02:47,250
 Do you like him? 

832
01:02:47,250 --> 01:02:50,530
 I don't think I need to hear any other reason. 

833
01:02:50,530 --> 01:02:52,830
 - We're doomed. 
 - Why? 

834
01:02:52,830 --> 01:02:54,700
 Are you really closing the Architectural Department? 

835
01:02:54,700 --> 01:02:56,350
 Do you mean this department could disappear? 

836
01:02:56,350 --> 01:02:59,210
 - You know they're siblings, right? 
 - What? 

837
01:02:59,210 --> 01:03:00,280
 Due today? 

838
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:03,710
 Ji Won knows how to draw a blueprint. Why don't you ask her? 

839
01:03:03,710 --> 01:03:05,580
 Are you guys making something together? 

840
01:03:05,580 --> 01:03:06,820
 Who confessed first? 

841
01:03:06,820 --> 01:03:08,020
 Of course not. 

842
01:03:08,020 --> 01:03:10,700
 What you said on the rooftop last time. 

843
01:03:10,700 --> 01:03:12,530
 Did you mean it? 

844
01:03:12,530 --> 01:03:15,910
â™«  I can't even understand myself  â™«
