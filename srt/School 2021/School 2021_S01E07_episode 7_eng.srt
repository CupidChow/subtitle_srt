1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,790
   

2
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:09,000
   

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,890
   

4
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:14,800
   

5
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,090
   

6
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:21,330
   

7
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:28,250


8
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:33,880
   

9
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,790
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

10
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:39,740
Hurry.

11
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:41,380
Hey.

12
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:45,580
Ji Won.

13
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,240
Oh?

14
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,750
What is it?

15
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:58,690
Hey, Jin Ji Won, I told you not to walk around at night—

16
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:14,710
Oh...

17
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:21,070
Well, I know this might look weird, but...

18
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,350
What's going on?

19
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,330
What are you doing here?

20
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:33,010
Young Joo, there's a reason for this...

21
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:39,230
I had something... to say to you.

22
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:42,140
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

23
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:43,980
I'll get going.

24
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:58,610
What was that?

25
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:00,490
What's going on?

26
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:05,150
Young Joo carried this here for me.

27
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:09,890
Gosh. Why did you have to come out at that moment?

28
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:12,880
If you were going to bring this home, you should have told me.

29
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,010
I don't know.

30
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:18,060
I really don't know what to do.

31
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:22,090
Move.

32
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:23,580
What?

33
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:25,940
Oh, okay.

34
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:34,150
   

35
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:45,790
Gosh.

36
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,640
Oh, no.

37
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,220
Geez.

38
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,120
Oh, no, what do we do? What do we do?

39
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,500
Aigoo.

40
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,220
I got it.

41
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,010
Geez, it's so heavy.

42
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:03,200
How did Jung Young Joo carry this here?

43
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,600
We put it on his motorbike.

44
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:08,880
Right.

45
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,180
It's comfortable and nice.

46
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,070
Sit down. It's yours.

47
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:24,750
Hey.

48
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:28,050
How is this mine? We made it together.

49
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:30,190
Indeed, it's ours...

50
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:33,360
so why would you make a fuss out of carrying it here alone

51
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,100
and cause this mess?

52
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:38,310
How should I explain this to Young Joo?

53
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:41,140
What do you mean how?

54
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:43,800
Just tell him the truth.

55
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:48,130
Is that okay with you?

56
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:54,690
   

57
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:57,550
 Are you from Nulji High? 

58
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:58,420
   

59
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:01,950
Yes, is that a problem?

60
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:05,140
No, not at all.

61
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:08,620
Where you go to school doesn't matter for this part-time job.

62
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:12,910
So do you want to do this work while taking lessons at the after-school academy?

63
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:14,590
Are you preparing for college?

64
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:16,090
Yes.

65
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:17,090
I see.

66
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:20,180
But our classes mostly prepare for the CSAT. 
  (TN: College Scholastic Ability Test) 

67
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:24,550
Since you're from Nulji High, aren't you preparing for a specialized field?

68
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:28,570
Then isn't it better to prioritize your school grades instead?

69
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,590
There's a college I want to go to,

70
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:34,350
but I think it's difficult to get in there with school grades.

71
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:36,090
Is that so?

72
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,760
Nonetheless, how marvelous.

73
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:45,030
In terms of lessons, you can take them whenever you like as long as it doesn’t affect your work,

74
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:47,710
since you'll be assisting the teachers anyway.

75
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:51,950
And the person working at the time can hand over the rest of the work to you.

76
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:55,500
Okay. Thank you. I'll work hard.

77
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:58,530
And...

78
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:01,270
you're coming here straight after school, right?

79
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:02,780
Yes.

80
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:09,340
We don't necessarily have a uniform for the part-time job, but...

81
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:12,320
Oh, I'll come to work in regular clothes.

82
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,690
Could you?

83
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:14,990
I'm sorry.

84
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:16,610
Since you'll be taking lessons with others,

85
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:19,450
there's no need to stir up stories about

86
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:21,810
why a specialized-school student takes lessons.

87
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:24,690
Yes, I understand.

88
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:26,670
It's all right.

89
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:29,350
 Study hard today, okay? 

90
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:30,990
 See you at home. 

91
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:33,970
 You forgot to take your food. 

92
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:36,190
 - See you.
- Bye. 

93
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:38,120
 See you later. 

94
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:49,120
You were shocked yesterday, right?

95
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,940
Yes. A little bit.

96
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:58,510
So the thing is, Ki Joon lives on the second floor of our house.

97
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:00,280
Ki Joon's actually...

98
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:03,250
No. That's okay.

99
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:06,140
As you said, I'm sure there is a reason.

100
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:11,490
There's no need to explain it. I'm not all that curious.

101
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:12,990
Oh!

102
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:15,190
Okay.

103
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:17,200
Then what...

104
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,460
Oh, right. What was it that you wanted to say?

105
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,880
Oh, well...

106
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:28,260
After the carpentry competition, I received an offer from someone.

107
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:30,950
- What? 
 - I'm not that interested,

108
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:33,540
but I wondered if maybe you would be.

109
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:36,530
That was why I went back yesterday, to ask you that.

110
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:38,150
What is it?

111
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,820
 What is it? 

112
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:48,280
 Can we talk for a minute? 

113
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:51,320
 I'm not a bad person, so don't be scared. 

114
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,030
   

115
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:02,860
 See? 

116
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:07,420
 I proved my identity, so what I'm about to say is real. 

117
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:12,920
 We're gathering high school students at our company. 

118
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,560
 To put it grandly, 

119
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,950
 we're fostering future carpenters and contributing to the world. 

120
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:19,840
 That's what we're trying to do. 

121
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,700
 But to put it simply, 

122
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:24,060
 we want to spend less and improve the company’s image. 

123
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,930
 Something like that. 

124
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:30,780
 What does that have to do with me? 

125
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,530
 Well, well... 

126
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:35,820
 You're hasty, just like me. 

127
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:38,080
 All right. 

128
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,020
 Look. 

129
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:45,090
   

130
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:48,340
 It's like a social project using carpentry. 
     

131
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:51,100
 We're gathering ten teams of high-schoolers from across Korea 

132
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:55,250
 who will contribute to their hometown through carpentry. 

133
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,320
 We'll be providing a small payment. 

134
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:00,950
 And depending on the activity’s result, we may award you. 

135
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:03,410
 You'd get a special benefit if you apply to our company. 

136
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:08,350
 Whether students want to work at our company is not important right now. 

137
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:12,780
 Well, so... 

138
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:16,110
 Why are you telling me this? 

139
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:21,700
 I’m bad at running the company, but I'm crazy about carpentry. 

140
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,610
 I noticed earlier that you have a rare talent. 

141
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:29,180
 Let's work together. 

142
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:34,060
 Since I picked you, I'll make sure to support your team. 

143
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,090
 So with that said... 

144
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:41,640
 Your number, please. 

145
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:48,110
So did you give him your number?

146
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,430
No.

147
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:52,030
Come on. Wait a second.

148
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,860
   

149
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,150
Wow!

150
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,760
It's real.

151
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,760
It sounds amazing.

152
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,740
I thought you would say that.

153
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:08,120
If you want to do it, I could do it with you...

154
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,650
Yes! Let's do it, let's do it.

155
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:16,890
But I'm not good at putting a team together.

156
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:21,660
So are you asking me to take the responsibility?

157
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:24,360
Something like that.

158
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,620
That's my main talent.

159
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:29,040
Sounds good.

160
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:34,030
A company-sponsored project?

161
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:36,850
That's good. It sounds like a great opportunity.

162
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:39,810
Are you sure you're not interested?

163
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:43,510
Oh, does this not help you in getting into college?

164
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,570
I started a part-time job at a college prep academy downtown.

165
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:54,520
I'll work there, take lessons and study.

166
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,290
I see.

167
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:58,050
I guess you'll be busy.

168
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:03,290
I'm going to go this way starting today.

169
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:06,430
The academy I work at is this way too.

170
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:08,450
I see.

171
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:10,350
Good.

172
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:12,760
We don't have to go around anymore.

173
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,990
It must've been taxing for you all along.

174
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:17,400
I'm just saying that.

175
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,030
I'm joking. Don't take it seriously.

176
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:27,180
   

177
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:29,890
Bye. See you tomorrow.

178
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:31,380
Where are you going?

179
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:34,680
This is my family's diner.

180
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:38,960
I see.

181
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:42,000
If you're hungry, you can eat here before you go.

182
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:44,850
That's okay. Maybe another time.

183
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:46,130
See you.

184
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:47,340
Okay.

185
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:55,190
   

186
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:59,070
   

187
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:09,100
Baro Furniture?

188
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,030
Isn't that a famous place?

189
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:12,330
Is it?

190
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:14,580
I guess I've heard of it before.

191
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:18,460
Wow, so is my son going to work there now?

192
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:22,270
It's not like that...

193
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:24,330
Maybe it could work out well.

194
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:27,290
Of course, my Young Joo would do well.

195
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:28,890
You got an award at a competition,

196
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:31,310
and you learned a lot from your dad.

197
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:33,120
Mom.

198
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,810
Here we go again with "My son is best."

199
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,910
Oh, right. We had a group order earlier.

200
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,880
A hundred-twenty rows of gimbap on Monday.

201
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,360
Monday?

202
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,130
You should have told them we can't. It's the day of the trial.

203
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:49,100
Why should I?

204
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:52,120
I can go by myself. I'll have the lawyer with me.

205
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,330
But still...

206
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:56,070
I'll go with you.

207
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,940
I'll go.

208
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,520
Don't worry.

209
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:13,290
 From now on, 

210
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:16,430
 just deliver what you're told to 

211
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:18,290
 and relay exactly what you hear. 

212
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:20,580
 I think that should be easy enough. 

213
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:24,430
Why so serious? It's unlike you.

214
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:26,170
What are you looking at?

215
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:27,370
Here.

216
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:28,900
Thank you.

217
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:32,940
I'm just watching the students.

218
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:37,410
They're cute when you see them from far away.

219
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:39,700
They're not so cute up close.

220
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:42,650
They look nasty when you look at them too long.

221
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:46,500
Aigoo.

222
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,210
It isn't easy to manage them, is it?

223
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:52,140
Don't mind it too much, whatever they do.

224
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:54,820
They don't know anything.

225
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:58,390
They seem pretty complicated too.

226
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:04,840
Why... did you recommend me for this school?

227
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:08,590
Well, I didn't really have a reason.

228
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:10,910
A position opened up in the Architectural Design department,

229
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:13,760
and I thought of you. That's all.

230
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,620
When you recommended me, did the school say anything?

231
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:19,460
The school loved it.

232
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:23,140
You were awarded at a competition, and you have a solid resume.

233
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:25,060
Not like that.

234
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:27,700
I told you before.

235
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:31,170
Things didn't end well with my previous job.

236
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:35,030
Does the school know about that?

237
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,430
I'm not sure.

238
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:40,510
They couldn't know that far.

239
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:43,730
There was no reason for me to tell them either.

240
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,540
Aigoo. It's complicated.

241
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:52,920
Being a teacher is hard.

242
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:10,820
It's admirable of you; to get a project like this from outside the school.

243
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,960
I just discussed details with Baro Furniture.

244
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,190
I also submitted an official report to the school.

245
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:18,610
I asked for a teacher to direct the process, so do your best.

246
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:23,030
- We will. Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

247
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:27,680
He's here now.

248
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:32,740
The project is related to carpentry, so I asked Mr. Lee Kang Hoon.

249
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:43,280
Please change the teacher in charge.

250
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,100
Young Joo.

251
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,690
Hey. What are you doing?

252
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:51,070
Sit down for now.

253
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:53,130
I need to know why you're acting like this.

254
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:57,260
I thought a teacher who recognized hard work would be in charge.

255
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:59,940
What does that mean?

256
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,990
Did something happen with Mr. Lee Kang Hoon?

257
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:13,830
It must have been uncomfortable for you.

258
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:14,870
Sorry.

259
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:16,440
What is it?

260
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,620
You saw what happened at the competition last time.

261
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:21,350
If he's in charge, it'll happen again.

262
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:27,380
Do you think there's a connection between the twins winning and the carpentry teacher?

263
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:33,590
I don't want to see him hurting and ruining someone who is trying to do their best again.

264
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:35,400
Hey.

265
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,310
Come on.

266
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:40,220
It might be unrelated to the teacher.

267
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:43,160
We are all his students. There's no way.

268
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,320
Does he even think of us as his students?

269
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:56,680
You should have told me if something like that had happened.

270
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:59,390
What's the point of telling you about it?

271
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:02,320
The result already turned out to be that way.

272
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:07,100
I tried to put myself between them to keep the students from getting hurt.

273
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,300
It didn't work at all.

274
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:12,910
I thought it was weird that Director Gu

275
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:14,990
went to the competition site.

276
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:19,290
My gosh. What is wrong with this d*mn school?

277
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,380
 What is wrong with this damn company? This isn't right. 

278
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:35,250
- I heard that one before. 
 - What?

279
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:42,060
Are you worried about the students?

280
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:45,360
No, I'm busy looking after myself.

281
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:52,230
The school has to be a fence for the students,

282
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:56,440
but it feels like it's driving them to a corner.

283
00:16:57,070 --> 00:16:59,470
It's good to think about them,

284
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:02,020
but you're not getting ahead of yourself again, are you?

285
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:05,010
Never mind me. I'm not interested.

286
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:09,450
Never mind them. I only care about getting my monthly salary

287
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:12,120
and getting off work on time.

288
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:17,060
You should worry about yourself. Don't get on their nerves anymore by saying proper things.

289
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:21,640
I'll talk it over with Young Joo.

290
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:25,030
Do whatever you want.

291
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:28,070
Not being charge of them would be better for me anyway.

292
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:39,010
Hi, Kang Seo Young's boyfriend.

293
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:42,330
Oh. Hey.

294
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:48,110
I'll eat with you since I'm a loner. I can sit here, right?

295
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,870
You're already sitting.

296
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:15,640
Shouldn't you eat with your friend?

297
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,020
Should I sit somewhere else?

298
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:19,890
No, no. I'm really comfortable right now.

299
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:22,260
Don't worry about me.

300
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:27,070
Just eat. Pretend she's not here.

301
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:30,840
Okay.

302
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,710
Are you going to eat with her?

303
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:48,900
She thinks we stole her award.

304
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,540
She'll look down on you if you go there.

305
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,180
We did steal it from her.

306
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:56,540
Are you insane?

307
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,300
Don't you have any friends?

308
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:12,580
Why do you keep following me?

309
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:22,330
That's it for today's lesson.

310
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:26,400
I put up the notice about the Baro Furniture project on the group chat,

311
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,130
so anyone who wants to participate, tell Young Joo.

312
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:30,130
That's it.

313
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:32,780
Thank you.

314
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:47,120
Wow, new guy.

315
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,240
Are you... the team leader?

316
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,650
Yes. The vice president of Baro Furniture asked him himself.

317
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,840
He saw Young Joo's carpentry skills.

318
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,280
- Wow. 
 - Daebak.

319
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,730
So if the team wins,

320
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:03,880
the whole team gets a benefit when applying to their company?

321
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,980
Yes.

322
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,440
Hey. Young Joo's the leader.

323
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,620
Why are you answering for him?

324
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:11,530
I got the offer,

325
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:14,020
but Ji Won will be taking the lead.

326
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:17,250
Whoever leads, I'll take part.

327
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:20,400
Hey. You guys should do it, too. It's a great opportunity.

328
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,250
No. It's hard enough preparing to earn certificates.

329
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:26,550
I have to ask my mom.

330
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:28,260
I'll add my name for now.

331
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,960
Okay. What about you, Min Seo?

332
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,620
Maybe I should do it before I start my apprenticeship again.

333
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:37,630
Sounds good. So, me, Young Joo, Jong Bok, Tae Ri, Min Seo...

334
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:40,630
We're short exactly one person.

335
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:44,020
I'll do it, too.

336
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:50,340
We got everyone.

337
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,680
Gong Ki Joon.

338
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:57,790
We can't accept you.

339
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,530
Why not?

340
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:03,860
It's not like there's a standard.

341
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:08,980
Carpentry is fun, right?

342
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:14,360
But you'll give this up too once it gets boring, no?

343
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:21,900
Young Joo, Gong Ki Joon isn't that bad.

344
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:26,970
Yes, Gong Ki Joon does well once he puts his mind to it.

345
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:30,680
Indeed. Ki Joon does well when he tries.

346
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:33,860
I don't think they know.

347
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:37,440
How shameless and selfish you are.

348
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,170
What?

349
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:41,620
You only care about yourself.

350
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:44,180
Whatever happens to your friend.

351
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:47,990
You do something if it's fun, but give up once it gets boring.

352
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,550
Enough.

353
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:51,910
We can talk about this later.

354
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:54,310
Talk about what later?

355
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:56,650
I don't have anything else to say to you.

356
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:58,990
I won't work with a jerk like you.

357
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:32,660
You have a lot of enemies.

358
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:35,560
What do you have against Gong Ki Joon?

359
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:40,990
It's just that... seeing that jerk's face makes me angry.

360
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:44,380
Gong Ki Joon doesn't seem to feel the same way.

361
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:49,060
You hate him, but he likes you?

362
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:50,820
It's not like that.

363
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:56,720
He's just... not important to me.

364
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:01,040
Insisting won't get you anywhere.

365
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:22,400
So...

366
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,730
Should I pretend I didn't hear that?

367
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:26,560
Hear what?

368
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:30,750
That volume level sounds like you need to eat something right now.

369
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:33,100
What are you talking about? I'm not hungry.

370
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:36,480
Geez. Insisting won't get you anywhere.

371
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:41,330
If you have time, you should eat before you go.

372
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:56,110
- Hyung. 
 - Hey.

373
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:01,540
Oh... It's my brother.

374
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:03,910
Hello.

375
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:07,260
Hi. Are you Young Joo's classmate?

376
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:08,680
Yes.

377
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:12,640
- Where's Mom? 
 - She went upstairs for a bit.

378
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:15,020
What do you want to eat?

379
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,440
I'll have tonkatsu.

380
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:20,760
Wait here a minute.

381
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,760
Hello.

382
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,890
- Hi, Ji Won, you're here. 
 - Yes.

383
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:36,310
A lot of Young Joo's friends are coming by today.

384
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:40,030
Seo Young.

385
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:41,540
Hey.

386
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,160
Why are you here?

387
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:51,280
Oh? I'm just dropping by.

388
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:06,450
Is it really okay if I sit with you?

389
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:10,300
If you guys are on a date, I can sit in the corner.

390
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:13,850
It's not like that. Don't worry about it.

391
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:18,160
Here we are.

392
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:21,920
I took a while with the jjolmyeon, didn't I?

393
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,870
Eat up, Ji Won.

394
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:27,080
Wow! This is way more than usual.

395
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:31,340
It's nothing for Young Joo's girlfriend.

396
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:33,120
- What? 
 - I—

397
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,770
He cared so much for the chocolate that you gave him.

398
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:38,760
I asked him for one, but he refused to give me any.

399
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,900
Mom, seriously.

400
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,680
That's not true.

401
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:47,610
Are you dating in secret?

402
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:50,480
Oh, no. You have your friend here.

403
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,830
Did I say the wrong thing?

404
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:57,530
Ahjumma, it's really not me.

405
00:25:57,530 --> 00:25:59,330
It's...

406
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:01,200
It's me.

407
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:08,130
I'm Young Joo's girlfriend.

408
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:10,190
Really?

409
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,890
Thank you for the food.

410
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:19,330
I'll drop by often with Young Joo.

411
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:23,660
I have to go. I have work.

412
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:25,010
Okay.

413
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:28,140
- Goodbye. 
 - All right.

414
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:32,550
Good... bye.

415
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:42,370
Wow. That's Seo Young for you.

416
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:44,590
She's so straightforward.

417
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:46,210
I guess.

418
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:50,170
I guess you didn't tell your family that you had a girlfriend.

419
00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:51,760
Well...

420
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:55,280
So Seo Young and I...

421
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:59,230
Never mind.

422
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:01,910
What was it that you wanted to say?

423
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:04,650
Oh. It's...

424
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:08,140
It's about Gong Ki Joon.

425
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:15,090
The offer from Baro Furniture, can Ki Joon do it with us?

426
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:17,270
We need one more person anyway,

427
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:22,800
and Ki Joon became pretty serious about his field of study while preparing for the competition last time.

428
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:28,320
Is that it?

429
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:33,540
The thing that you had to come all the way here to say?

430
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:38,030
What? Well, I was just here to eat anyway, so...

431
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:40,410
Sorry, but I can't work with him.

432
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:42,800
You should go.

433
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:47,460
Hey.

434
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:14,540
Did you finish fixing it?

435
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:15,810
Yes.

436
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:19,500
I stopped it from squeaking, but this part.

437
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:22,010
I can't do anything about this gap.

438
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:27,060
The joint isn't properly connected.

439
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:30,820
Still, other than that,

440
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:34,140
everything else is well made.

441
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:37,380
We could have gotten an award if we had only worked on the joint properly.

442
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:41,180
Still, it hasn't been long since you started. Your skills have improved a lot.

443
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:44,090
Of course, I'm your grandson.

444
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:47,350
It's just that I didn't work hard enough, but once I put my mind to it,

445
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:48,650
I learn quickly.

446
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:50,550
Aigoo, aigoo. You're bluffing.

447
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:52,610
Geez.

448
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:55,210
So...

449
00:28:56,370 --> 00:29:00,820
should I get serious about carpentry like Jin Ji Won?

450
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:04,480
Are you talking about me?

451
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:08,630
Ji Won. Teach Ki Joon well.

452
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:10,450
He seems to be enjoying it.

453
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:13,160
Well. Would it really work?

454
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:16,590
How could you catch up to an excellent apprentice

455
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:19,210
who learned under Grandpa since kindergarten years?

456
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:26,230
Talent triumphs over time.

457
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:28,080
Come on.

458
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,350
What?

459
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:31,320
- Are you laughing at me? 
 - Yes.

460
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:34,630
I don't know about talent, but you do have some sense.

461
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:42,390
So about that new project. It starts soon, right?

462
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:45,900
Yes. It would be nice if you could do it with us.

463
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:53,050
I mean, you should do something so your carpentry skill can improve quickly.

464
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:55,510
I meant it would be good for you.

465
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:00,220
That's true.

466
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:03,190
What is it? Are you doing something again?

467
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:05,970
You can do it, too, Ki Joon.

468
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:08,140
Someone's stopping me from doing it.

469
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,580
Can you tell him off for me, Grandpa?

470
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:12,460
What jerk would do such a thing?

471
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:15,620
Bring him here this instant. I'll take his leg and—

472
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:19,870
Like this?

473
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:32,220
So we learned about the elements of traditional Korean architecture.

474
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:34,750
Here's the performance assessment assignment.

475
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:38,150
Quiet.

476
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:43,160
First, visit one of these traditional architectural sites—

477
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,740
Quiet!

478
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:49,830
You youths.

479
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:55,520
Go to one of these sites and take pictures based on what you learned in class.

480
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,770
Write a report and do a presentation on it.

481
00:30:57,770 --> 00:31:01,620
Ms. Kim? Which of them is the closest?

482
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:03,110
They're all similar distances.

483
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:07,080
Location B is a little further away, but you'll have a lot to write about.

484
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:09,990
Why are there two locations for B?

485
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:12,620
You might as well visit both if you're making your way further away.

486
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:15,600
The two buildings have distinctly different styles.

487
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:19,560
It's worth 30 points so don't even think about getting something off of the internet.

488
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,950
- All right.
 - That's it.

489
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:24,150
Goodbye.

490
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:29,720
Hey, guys. Let's do B.

491
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:32,520
I'm bored of hanoks. 
  (TN: a hanok is a traditional Korean house) 

492
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:37,870
Let's just go to nearby A and look around quickly, then hang out at a pretty cafe.

493
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:41,280
There's a seriously good restaurant near C.

494
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:43,650
Wow, seriously? That sounds great.

495
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:46,520
- Can't wait to go. 
 - Hey, Team Leader.

496
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:49,890
- To which one are you going to go to? 
 - What?

497
00:31:49,890 --> 00:31:54,170
You're the team leader for the Baro Furniture project.

498
00:31:54,170 --> 00:31:56,220
Do you want to go to the hanok with us?

499
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:58,190
Hey, what are you doing?

500
00:31:58,190 --> 00:31:59,980
I'm not sure...

501
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:01,330
Come with us.

502
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:05,550
You get to know each other and do homework together if you go with the team.

503
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:08,210
You're supposed to hang out with the team.

504
00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:10,170
To bond, you know?

505
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:11,910
Okay, I'll think about it.

506
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:16,140
Min Seo. Let's go to B.

507
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:17,460
Let's go to B.

508
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:18,850
It's too far.

509
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:20,980
- Please. 
 - It's far.

510
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:24,980
Please.

511
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:28,590
- Please? 
 - It's too far.

512
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:37,360
Did you decide where to go for the performance assessment assignment?

513
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,930
No.

514
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:43,380
It might be better to go where many won't go.

515
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:45,680
Jung Young Joo.

516
00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:01,010
I want to do it, too.

517
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:03,700
The new project club.

518
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:05,810
You?

519
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:13,040
I did as you asked. Do me a favor, too.

520
00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:16,520
This is not up to me.

521
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:22,810
I know I'm indebted to you,

522
00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:28,190
but if you join us, wouldn't the same thing as the last competition happen again?

523
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:33,920
I know Director Gu and the carpentry teacher made you twins first place behind our backs.

524
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:37,590
Mr. Lee Kang Hoon wasn't a part of it.

525
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:41,240
- What? 
 - He actually got on Mr. Lee Han Soo's bad side

526
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,660
because of the last competition.

527
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:46,010
What do you mean? Tell me in detail.

528
00:33:46,010 --> 00:33:50,300
The judge was the carpentry teacher's sunbae

529
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:53,470
so the school ordered him to buy out the judges,

530
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:55,840
but he didn't do as he was told.

531
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:59,610
So that's why Director Gu stepped forward herself.

532
00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:02,410
- Your aunt. 
 - Sorry.

533
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:05,520
 You almost fooled me. 

534
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:10,200
 You and Director Gu. You're all the same. 

535
00:34:14,410 --> 00:34:17,670
Why do you want to join a club again?

536
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:19,950
Director Gu really didn't make you do it?

537
00:34:19,950 --> 00:34:24,060
She didn't. Really. I just volunteered because I really want to.

538
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:26,800
Do you like carpentry that much?

539
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,410
I mean...

540
00:34:28,410 --> 00:34:30,710
I do like carpentry,

541
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:37,280
but more than that, I want to try hanging out with friends.

542
00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:49,020
Look, Eun Bi. She just uploaded a few cover dances on YouTube

543
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:51,120
and got a ton of calls from entertainment companies.

544
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:53,370
I don't know anymore.

545
00:35:02,490 --> 00:35:05,410
Now that the ones who defended me are gone,

546
00:35:05,410 --> 00:35:07,590
I have no energy.

547
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:12,350
I was completely fooled by you and Kang Seo Young's teamwork.

548
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:14,780
Come on, don't be like that.

549
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:18,470
You were moved and told me I was suave.

550
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:21,440
What the heck. I said we should just go.

551
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:24,480
Hey! You're Jung Dae Hye's boyfriend, right?

552
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,450
Sorry? Who are you...

553
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:30,210
He is. You're a funny one.

554
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:32,140
Can you really live well on your own?

555
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:33,850
What— what do you mean?

556
00:35:33,850 --> 00:35:35,010
Never mind.

557
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:38,910
You make a perfectly sane girl drop out of school in 12th grade.

558
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:41,600
You look happy with your new girlfriend.

559
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:44,060
- Drop out? 
 - That's enough. Let's go.

560
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:46,410
It's embarrassing.

561
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:49,670
You. You shouldn't live like that.

562
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:51,550
Let's go.

563
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:58,730
Eun Bi, sorry. One second.

564
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:04,100
H-Hey, excuse me!

565
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:08,710
Did Da Hye noona drop out?

566
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:10,260
Are you saying you didn't know?

567
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:12,730
I really didn't know.

568
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:14,380
I haven't seen her since winter break.

569
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:16,330
You're more shameless than I thought.

570
00:36:16,330 --> 00:36:18,110
Da Hye was even grounded.

571
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:19,630
What?

572
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,420
Wh-Why?

573
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:25,630
How are we supposed to know? Shouldn't you know that?

574
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:29,680
- Wow. He's trash. 
 - Really...

575
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:44,850
Did you have a girlfriend?

576
00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:46,400
Yes.

577
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:49,120
I met her last year.

578
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:51,160
I was dumped over winter break.

579
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,390
Why?

580
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:54,220
I don't know.

581
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:56,790
It was going well,

582
00:36:56,790 --> 00:36:59,870
and then suddenly, she started ignoring my texts.

583
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:03,030
Even to this day.

584
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:04,780
I see...

585
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:07,880
It must have been hard for you.

586
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,760
Yes...

587
00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:15,530
What? No, not at all.

588
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:18,540
It's already in the past. Nothing hard about it.

589
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:21,660
Well, was she your first girlfriend?

590
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:24,360
- Y-Yes. 
 - What about afterward?

591
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,000
I was single.

592
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,480
Then what about now?

593
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,020
What?

594
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:36,660
I'm not sure.

595
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,950
Perhaps it's still a work in progress.

596
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:15,150
Are you already leaving, Ji Won?

597
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:19,080
Yes, It's further away, so I have to leave early.

598
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:24,320
Ki Joon, it's a school project. Aren't you going?

599
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:28,500
I said I would go today, too, but I'm going somewhere close with my friends.

600
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:29,660
Is that so?

601
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:31,690
Ji Won, you should have chosen somewhere closer.

602
00:38:31,690 --> 00:38:34,720
I really wanted to go to this place.

603
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,760
Where is the tape measure?

604
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:48,500
Are you okay?

605
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:50,210
Hey, hey, hey.

606
00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:52,230
Let's see.

607
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:54,640
Aigoo, you should go to the hospital.

608
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,440
- Honey! 
 - Don't tell Mom.

609
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,500
Oh. Okay.

610
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:03,600
Ki Joon, we'll be back. Don't tell her mom.

611
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,650
Let's go.

612
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:08,580
Aigoo. You should have been careful.

613
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:14,120
I know. I'm going.

614
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:17,280
Eat something if you're hungry. Don't tell me.

615
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,010
Seriously.

616
00:39:19,010 --> 00:39:22,450
 What's fine about this? 

617
00:39:22,450 --> 00:39:24,810
 What's nothing? 

618
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:29,730
You went to the ER this morning with your finger sliced open, and it's nothing?

619
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:35,170
We only went to the ER because no other place was open, it's not that serious.

620
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:37,670
It's not serious, but she had five stitches?

621
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:40,050
Sorry, Mom. But I have to go.

622
00:39:40,050 --> 00:39:41,840
Where are you going with your finger like that?

623
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:44,740
I have a performance assessment assignment. I have to go see traditional wooden architecture.

624
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:47,550
Do you still talk about carpentry after being injured because of it?

625
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:49,990
You hurt and cut yourself all the time.

626
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:51,440
I said I'd be careful.

627
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:54,290
How many years has it been since you said that?

628
00:39:54,290 --> 00:39:57,670
If you keep hurting yourself like this, it means your body's not getting used to it.

629
00:39:57,670 --> 00:40:01,090
That means you have no talent.

630
00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:02,410
Mom.

631
00:40:02,410 --> 00:40:04,020
What?

632
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:06,520
You didn't win the competition this time either.

633
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,490
You should know when to quit.

634
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:11,080
Why do you hold onto what's not right for you and suffer?

635
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:14,670
Honey, calm down. You'll get anemia again.

636
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:20,250
You said I could work hard on what I love even if I'm not talented.

637
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:22,510
Why are you going back on your words now?

638
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:24,500
You...

639
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:28,310
- That was so long ago— 
 - And who said I'm not talented?

640
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:30,510
I am talented.

641
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:35,400
Be careful, okay?

642
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:38,330
She's talking back to me.

643
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:15,480
- What is this? 
 - You hurt yourself looking for this, right?

644
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:17,570
You forgot to take it.

645
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:25,700
I can do without measuring tape.

646
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,630
Are you here to bring me this?

647
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:30,220
Yes.

648
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:33,510
We're leaving.

649
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:36,300
What are you doing? Aren't you getting off?

650
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:38,730
I'm going to sleep. Don't wake me up.

651
00:41:56,590 --> 00:41:58,860
Wow, it's big.

652
00:41:58,860 --> 00:41:59,960
Yes.

653
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:02,690
It's much larger than I thought it would be.

654
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:05,580
It says it was an upper-class house.

655
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:07,010
These people were rich.

656
00:42:07,010 --> 00:42:10,350
I'll take over here. You do the Mu Sung School building later.

657
00:42:10,350 --> 00:42:12,130
Whatever works.

658
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:13,980
But when are we eating?

659
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:17,960
I haven't been on a bus in a while, and I'm really tired, hungry—

660
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:20,440
So why did you follow me?

661
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:22,330
I'm regretting it.

662
00:42:22,330 --> 00:42:25,730
I'm proud of you, so I'll buy lunch.

663
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:28,550
As you should.

664
00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:31,160
Of course, you should buy lunch.

665
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:33,240
Fine, come on.

666
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:35,310
I am coming.

667
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,010
What did you do all these years not growing up?

668
00:43:46,010 --> 00:43:48,320
You look like an elementary school student from far away.

669
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:51,100
Hey.

670
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:54,790
I'm of average height.

671
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,360
Unbelievable.

672
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:33,260
Hey, look at this. Looks good, right?

673
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:35,730
Nice.

674
00:44:35,730 --> 00:44:38,000
Let's eat.

675
00:44:42,710 --> 00:44:44,310
Are we going now?

676
00:44:45,270 --> 00:44:47,390
Are we not eating?

677
00:44:51,070 --> 00:44:52,690
Careful.

678
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:55,000
You be careful.

679
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:09,010
Hey.

680
00:45:09,690 --> 00:45:11,910
You said you'd buy lunch.

681
00:45:12,790 --> 00:45:14,730
Is this what you meant?

682
00:45:14,730 --> 00:45:17,860
The weird thing is,

683
00:45:17,860 --> 00:45:21,080
whenever I see something nice or go somewhere nice,

684
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:23,690
I always crave ramen and gimbap.

685
00:45:23,690 --> 00:45:25,840
Do you know that feeling?

686
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:29,420
Wanting to eat the most mundane thing at the most beautiful place.

687
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:32,010
So romantic.

688
00:45:32,010 --> 00:45:33,790
Wow.

689
00:45:33,790 --> 00:45:36,520
That's a grand story, considering it's an excuse

690
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:38,180
just to save money.

691
00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:39,750
It's true.

692
00:45:39,750 --> 00:45:43,020
I'll buy you an expensive dessert at the terminal.

693
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:45,830
You ate it well.

694
00:45:45,830 --> 00:45:47,340
True.

695
00:45:50,310 --> 00:45:52,440
Hey, hey. Hold this.

696
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:53,930
Sorry. Sorry

697
00:45:53,930 --> 00:45:56,470
Sorry, sorry.

698
00:45:56,470 --> 00:45:58,340
Hey, Young Joo.

699
00:45:58,340 --> 00:45:59,650
 Where are you? 

700
00:45:59,650 --> 00:46:01,980
I'm working on the performance assessment assignment.

701
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:05,270
I see. You're already there.

702
00:46:05,270 --> 00:46:07,610
Yes. It's quite nice here. You should visit.

703
00:46:07,610 --> 00:46:08,980
Okay.

704
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:10,480
I will.

705
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:12,650
 Why did you call? 

706
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:16,110
I just thought we could go together.

707
00:46:16,110 --> 00:46:17,980
Did you want to come here, too?

708
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:21,150
You should have said so. It would have been nice to come together.

709
00:46:21,150 --> 00:46:24,030
No, no. It's okay.

710
00:46:24,930 --> 00:46:27,790
It might be dangerous all by yourself, so get on the bus before it gets too late.

711
00:46:27,790 --> 00:46:31,430
It's okay. Ki Joon's here with me.

712
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:35,920
What?

713
00:46:41,610 --> 00:46:44,180
Is it Seo Young or Ji Won?

714
00:46:44,850 --> 00:46:46,420
What are you doing?

715
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:48,370
Were you standing there?

716
00:46:48,370 --> 00:46:53,740
Geez. Whoever it is, you should have mentioned it sooner.

717
00:46:54,730 --> 00:46:57,160
Come out, let's eat.

718
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:07,680
This is a completely different vibe.

719
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:11,080
- I'm glad we went to both, right? 
 - Yes.

720
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:15,480
So is a "seowon" like a school?

721
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:17,650
It's something similar.

722
00:47:17,650 --> 00:47:20,380
Did you come here without even knowing what it is?

723
00:47:24,590 --> 00:47:26,510
This place looks nice.

724
00:47:28,630 --> 00:47:29,650
Are we allowed to go in?

725
00:47:29,650 --> 00:47:34,170
Of course not! He's hilarious.

726
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:37,480
   
  

727
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:51,520
Watch where you're going.

728
00:47:59,650 --> 00:48:04,870
♫  Even though I try to think of something else  ♫

729
00:48:04,870 --> 00:48:11,670
♫  My brain won't listen to me  ♫

730
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:20,540
♫  Your every little thing  ♫

731
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:25,750
♫  I like all of them, what can I do?  ♫

732
00:48:27,790 --> 00:48:35,290
♫  Because your smiles every day are a little bit different  ♫

733
00:48:35,290 --> 00:48:40,250
♫  Every day is a joy  ♫

734
00:48:41,910 --> 00:48:48,010
♫  When I happen to pass by you  ♫

735
00:48:48,010 --> 00:48:54,780
♫  My heart beats loudly  ♫

736
00:48:54,780 --> 00:49:01,270
♫  What do I do with my heart that keeps liking you?  ♫

737
00:49:01,270 --> 00:49:08,330
♫  What do I do when I can't hide it?  ♫

738
00:49:08,330 --> 00:49:13,660
♫  They say that's how it all begins  ♫

739
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:21,350
♫  Hesitating, not knowing what to do  ♫

740
00:49:23,750 --> 00:49:25,490
Goodbye.

741
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:29,090
Goodbye.

742
00:49:29,090 --> 00:49:31,000
 Is she awake? 

743
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,520
 Is he still asleep? 

744
00:49:34,590 --> 00:49:37,020
 Geez, I think we're here. 

745
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:39,380
 Gosh, what do I do? 

746
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:41,150
 Keep calm. 

747
00:49:41,150 --> 00:49:42,440
 And... 

748
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:45,420
 I just have to get up naturally, right? 

749
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:48,140
Hey, aren't you getting off?

750
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:57,100
So Director...

751
00:49:57,100 --> 00:50:00,220
I hope you can get through to my child.

752
00:50:00,220 --> 00:50:03,250
I prepared him to go to a science high school since elementary school,

753
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:05,900
and now he wants to go to a specialized school.

754
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:08,320
Gosh. It's so shocking.

755
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:09,530
I see.

756
00:50:09,530 --> 00:50:13,540
Children are constantly changing their minds at this age.

757
00:50:13,540 --> 00:50:17,400
He will regret not listening to his mother once he does manual labor making a living,

758
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:20,020
while being mistreated

759
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:22,690
and being overworked.

760
00:50:22,690 --> 00:50:25,650
But it's not always like that these days.

761
00:50:25,650 --> 00:50:28,720
Specialized technical jobs earn more money

762
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:31,230
and societal perception has changed now.

763
00:50:31,230 --> 00:50:34,730
And many students go to college from specialized high schools too...

764
00:50:34,730 --> 00:50:36,500
- Director. 
 - Yes?

765
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:39,830
You speak too lightly since it's someone else's business.

766
00:50:39,830 --> 00:50:42,940
Oh, no! That's not what I meant.

767
00:50:42,940 --> 00:50:45,640
Anyway, please convince my child.

768
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:47,780
Of course, I will.

769
00:50:50,070 --> 00:50:52,730
Goodbye.

770
00:50:55,990 --> 00:50:58,640
Gosh, the biases that people have...

771
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:01,140
They don't go away easily.

772
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:08,530
Don't your parents worry about you working over the weekend?

773
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:11,570
No, it's okay.

774
00:51:11,570 --> 00:51:14,540
All right. Don't work too hard.

775
00:51:19,990 --> 00:51:23,010
I'll go downstairs for a moment.

776
00:51:23,010 --> 00:51:24,790
All right.

777
00:52:07,770 --> 00:52:11,740
 You better work hard. Don't inconvenience others this time. 

778
00:52:16,450 --> 00:52:17,990
   

779
00:52:17,990 --> 00:52:20,920
 I said I threw the flowerpot. 

780
00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:48,040
 So why did you throw the flowerpot then? 

781
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:52,350
 What are you talking about out of the blue? 

782
00:52:52,350 --> 00:52:54,200
 I was just curious. 

783
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:56,390
 Why did you throw it? 

784
00:53:00,060 --> 00:53:02,320
 Why are you asking me that? 

785
00:53:05,530 --> 00:53:08,720
 Oh, sorry. It wasn't you. 

786
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:10,850
 Who was it again? 

787
00:53:12,550 --> 00:53:14,850
 What are you trying to do? 

788
00:53:31,570 --> 00:53:35,010
Hey. Did you see my phone?

789
00:53:35,010 --> 00:53:36,280
I don't know.

790
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:38,010
Didn't you take it to the restroom?

791
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:40,420
I didn't.

792
00:53:47,130 --> 00:53:49,270
   

793
00:53:55,490 --> 00:53:57,790
   

794
00:54:05,830 --> 00:54:08,770
Wow. It's tiring, right?

795
00:54:08,770 --> 00:54:09,960
Yes.

796
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:12,480
So tiring.

797
00:54:19,180 --> 00:54:21,350
Oh. So.

798
00:54:21,350 --> 00:54:24,020
Good work today.

799
00:54:24,020 --> 00:54:25,750
Rest up.

800
00:54:25,750 --> 00:54:27,410
Okay.

801
00:54:27,410 --> 00:54:28,860
Go inside.

802
00:54:28,860 --> 00:54:31,520
Okay.

803
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:08,230
Was it not Jae Hee?

804
00:55:11,060 --> 00:55:13,240
So Kang Seo Young told her to say that,

805
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:15,610
but Kang Seo Young didn't throw it?

806
00:55:15,610 --> 00:55:17,540
Indeed.

807
00:55:17,540 --> 00:55:19,570
I could have found out more.

808
00:55:19,570 --> 00:55:22,180
Geez. So close.

809
00:55:25,190 --> 00:55:26,900
But it's obvious.

810
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:32,740
The people that Kang Seo Young would go out of her way to protect.

811
00:55:32,740 --> 00:55:34,500
There are only two.

812
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:36,280
Who are they?

813
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:40,920
First, it's a girl named Go Eun Bi.

814
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:42,550
It can't be her.

815
00:55:42,550 --> 00:55:44,880
She was in the classroom then.

816
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:50,930
 - A flowerpot. 
 - What is it? 

817
00:55:50,930 --> 00:55:54,080
 What's that? Daebak. 

818
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:57,210
 What's going on? What is that? 

819
00:56:01,130 --> 00:56:03,790
So there's only one person left.

820
00:56:05,550 --> 00:56:08,050
Kang Seo Young's boyfriend.

821
00:56:08,050 --> 00:56:09,590
I'm 90 percent sure.

822
00:56:09,590 --> 00:56:12,530
Does Kang Seo Young have a boyfriend?

823
00:56:12,530 --> 00:56:13,880
What is his name?

824
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:17,270
Jung Young Joo. A new guy in my class.

825
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:20,660
Jung Young Joo?

826
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:24,620
The document prepared by the plaintiff

827
00:56:24,620 --> 00:56:28,910
seems to repeat the same content from last time.

828
00:56:28,910 --> 00:56:32,870
What is the reason you wish to push back the date to plead?

829
00:56:32,870 --> 00:56:36,820
Yes, a long time has passed since the date of the incident,

830
00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:40,980
so there are some difficulties gathering evidence.

831
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:43,200
If you could push back the date once more,

832
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:47,640
we shall gather and submit additional evidence

833
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:49,960
that the accused is responsible for the accident.

834
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:53,340
We shall push back the date for additional evidence.

835
00:56:53,340 --> 00:56:57,080
And if you cannot gather evidence until the next date,

836
00:56:57,080 --> 00:57:00,170
we shall conclude the plead.

837
00:57:00,170 --> 00:57:03,170
That will be all.

838
00:57:25,430 --> 00:57:27,260
   

839
00:57:41,990 --> 00:57:44,980
For now, we earned some time.

840
00:57:44,980 --> 00:57:49,920
But we have to gather testimony or evidence as much as we can during that time.

841
00:57:50,860 --> 00:57:58,230
I think you should ask Supervisor Lee Kang Hoon again from last time.

842
00:57:59,750 --> 00:58:01,650
That will be tough.

843
00:58:02,250 --> 00:58:05,040
He's working at a school affiliated with Sang Rim.

844
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:08,830
I couldn't ask that of him.

845
00:58:09,510 --> 00:58:11,830
Then we're at a disadvantage.

846
00:58:11,830 --> 00:58:15,730
Should I contact him myself?

847
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:24,400
It was a Nulji High uniform for sure.

848
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:26,910
What was his name? Did you see his name tag?

849
00:58:26,910 --> 00:58:29,350
Noona, I did well today, right?

850
00:58:29,350 --> 00:58:30,710
His name.

851
00:58:30,710 --> 00:58:33,690
Don't speak nonsense and tell me his name.

852
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:37,690
Jung Young Joo.

853
00:58:37,690 --> 00:58:40,050
Jung Young Joo?

854
00:58:40,050 --> 00:58:43,490
 Jung Young Joo. A new guy in my class. 

855
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:52,510
Yes.

856
00:58:52,510 --> 00:58:54,820
Yes, of course.

857
00:58:54,820 --> 00:58:56,460
All right.

858
00:59:06,290 --> 00:59:07,650
Two, three. Two!

859
00:59:07,650 --> 00:59:09,240
Darn.

860
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:11,010
Oh, Team Leader.

861
00:59:11,010 --> 00:59:12,530
You're super late.

862
00:59:12,530 --> 00:59:14,900
He already told Ms. Song.

863
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:16,960
I heard you might not come. You're early.

864
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:20,000
Yes. It ended faster than I thought.

865
00:59:21,030 --> 00:59:23,590
What was it?

866
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:30,470
Is Jung Young Joo in this class?

867
00:59:56,350 --> 00:59:58,420
Jung Young Joo.

868
00:59:59,140 --> 01:00:01,220
Come sit.

869
01:00:15,050 --> 01:00:17,830
 That's what beggars do. 

870
01:00:34,340 --> 01:00:37,280
I heard you were transferred here.

871
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:39,680
Are you adjusting to school well?

872
01:00:40,270 --> 01:00:41,670
Yes.

873
01:00:42,340 --> 01:00:44,020
I'm glad.

874
01:00:45,170 --> 01:00:47,400
How is our school?

875
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:50,760
The teachers are great. We have great facilities.

876
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:52,620
It's quite nice, right?

877
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:55,780
Yes.

878
01:00:55,780 --> 01:00:58,210
The view from here is great too.

879
01:00:59,900 --> 01:01:04,410
Especially the view from the rooftop.

880
01:01:07,870 --> 01:01:11,170
Have you been to the rooftop?

881
01:01:13,030 --> 01:01:20,030


882
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:26,340
It's already time for class. Go on ahead.

883
01:01:32,740 --> 01:01:34,400
Oh, right.

884
01:01:34,930 --> 01:01:37,580
I have something to give back to you.

885
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:48,080
This is yours, isn't it?

886
01:02:08,980 --> 01:02:17,060
♫  Dream on, dream on, dream on  ♫

887
01:02:17,060 --> 01:02:24,240
♫  Dream on, dream on, dream on  ♫

888
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:30,090
♫  My heart keeps thinking of you  ♫

889
01:02:30,090 --> 01:02:34,290
♫  I can't even understand myself  ♫

890
01:02:34,290 --> 01:02:39,900
♫  I'm always curious about you  ♫

891
01:02:39,900 --> 01:02:41,700
♫  Whenever I run into you  ♫

892
01:02:41,700 --> 01:02:44,560
   

893
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:47,120
 Why did she point out Young Joo right away? 

894
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:48,740
 Expel him. 

895
01:02:48,740 --> 01:02:51,630
 So this person named Gu Byeong Chul knows Jung Young Joo? 

896
01:02:51,630 --> 01:02:53,700
 He won't let it go. 

897
01:02:53,700 --> 01:02:56,970
 Are you keep going to be like that? Let it go. 

898
01:02:56,970 --> 01:02:59,590
 Not Mr. Lee. It'll put him in a difficult position. 

899
01:02:59,590 --> 01:03:02,880
 Could I ask for your help? 

900
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:05,100
 Did you change your mind? 

901
01:03:05,100 --> 01:03:07,710
 He said he tried to get it back for you. 

902
01:03:07,710 --> 01:03:09,490
 I came here because I knew you would come. 

903
01:03:09,490 --> 01:03:11,330
 You're always avoiding me. 

904
01:03:11,330 --> 01:03:14,850
 You can't run from here. 

905
01:03:16,220 --> 01:03:18,780
♫  Tell me what you wanna be  ♫
