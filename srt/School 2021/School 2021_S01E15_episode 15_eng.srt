1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,660
   

2
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:09,180
   

3
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,890
   

4
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,950
   

5
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:17,120
   

6
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:21,190
   

7
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:33,700
   

8
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:41,950
 Timing and Subtitles by the ðŸŽ¶ Sing for a dream ðŸŽ¤ Team @ viki 

9
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:08,460
   

10
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:11,390
Have you figured out what's missing?

11
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:13,800
Find it.

12
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:18,060
Find it right now!

13
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:21,320
Ki Joon!

14
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,500
Is it that student?

15
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,500
I'll talk to him.

16
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:31,510
Ki Joon...

17
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:34,060
Did you by any chance...

18
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,890
come to school last night?

19
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:56,970
I was with him.

20
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,960
I was in the club room with him yesterday.

21
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:06,720
I was at school, too.

22
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,070
M-Me too.

23
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:21,660
If what they say is true, we need to investigate these students.

24
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:25,030
They're trying to protect their friend.

25
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:26,950
Stay put, all of you.

26
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:30,310
The officer needs to check something just with Ki Joon.

27
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:37,110
I said I was with him, Ms. Song.

28
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:39,150
Jung Young Joo.

29
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:45,340
Let's go.

30
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:50,780
Oh, no. What has happened?

31
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,700
Oh, no.

32
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,930
What is he going to do?

33
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:23,230
You came through this door and then went to the director's office, right?

34
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:26,480
Ki Joon,

35
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,490
you need to tell me the truth so I can help you.

36
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:47,030
I'm Director Gu.

37
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:52,200
I looked through everything carefully. Nothing was stolen.

38
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,160
The drawer was only damaged,

39
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:57,280
but our security guard is so dedicated to his job

40
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,400
that he called the police first.

41
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,450
But we should still look into the forced entry.

42
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,580
Yes, of course. Certainly...

43
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:10,230
But what happened at school must be resolved within the school.

44
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:16,330
If the police investigate the school over a damaged drawer,

45
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:26,340
I think my heart would ache too much as an educator.

46
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:29,790
Gosh.

47
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:33,720
- I understand, butâ€” 
 - So...

48
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,600
Officer...

49
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:41,890
Please don't take our student's issues to the station.

50
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:44,490
I beg you.

51
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:07,190
You're Supervisor Lee Kang Hoon, correct?

52
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:11,160
Yes. Who are you?

53
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,570
You mightn't remember me. We met once before.

54
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:16,580
I'm the news reporter from the bribery incident.

55
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:19,550
Ko Byun Ho from KBD.

56
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,250
I heard about some interesting events, so I came by.

57
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:32,180
I never thought we'd meet again like this.

58
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:35,550
So you were fired because of bribery,

59
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:38,360
and now you're an unfairly dismissed teacher.

60
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,360
Wow. That's interesting.

61
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:44,030
I'd really like to report on this.

62
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,270
You should just go.

63
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:02,200
 Really? 

64
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,890
He will just be scolded?

65
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:05,400
Yes.

66
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,360
That's a surprise.

67
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:11,030
That's not like the Director Gu we know.

68
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:15,090
Could she be taking him to her office to punish him in secret?

69
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:17,950
How can anyone punish students these days?

70
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:21,300
"Gong Ki Joon. You must be in shock from this morning."

71
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:25,120
"Would you like some chocolate milk?" That's what she will say.

72
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,660
That gives me the chills.

73
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:32,070
Whatever it is, it's a mistake, right?

74
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:33,980
Ki Joon's okay, right?

75
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:37,460
Of course. It's just a misunderstanding.

76
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:48,050
Hey, Kang Seo Young.

77
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:51,180
Starting tomorrow, I can't come to school.

78
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,010
I'll be at training camp for the auditions.

79
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:55,970
I know. Good luck.

80
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,290
If I make it to the final round,

81
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:08,570
you won't see me for three months.

82
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:10,330
Three months is short.

83
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:12,200
Fighting.

84
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,740
Even if I'm eliminated in the preliminary round,

85
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:18,510
I'm still there for two weeks.

86
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:21,770
Oh...

87
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:25,580
Three months from now is next year.

88
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:28,130
So won't I see you until next year?

89
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:29,820
That's right.

90
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:32,600
Today is the last day we will see each other.

91
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,500
I'm going back to an apprenticeship.

92
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,460
What?

93
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:57,890
- Congratulations! 
 - That's great.

94
00:07:57,890 --> 00:07:59,510
When do you get paid?

95
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:01,300
You'll buy us jjolmyeon, right? And pork katsu?

96
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,650
Of course.

97
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,940
- I'm so happy for her. 
 - Ji Won.

98
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:08,220
I think Ki Joon's issue is resolved.

99
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:09,290
What?

100
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:13,020
Look at you go from zombie to brightening up when hearing Ki Joon's name.

101
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,840
I'm hurt.

102
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,070
That's not it.

103
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:17,990
But what do you mean by resolved? How do you know?

104
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:19,300
I overheard it in the office.

105
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:22,030
I think he's talking to Director Gu now.

106
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:23,380
"Director Gu"?

107
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:28,120
It looks like Director Gu will say a few gentle words and leave it at that.

108
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,920
Oh. Really?

109
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:38,140
Hey, look at this.

110
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,270
It really wasn't me.

111
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:45,080
I never came into this room.

112
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,040
After being caught on the CCTV,

113
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,990
how can you be so shameless?

114
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:51,880
Yes, I was on CCTV,

115
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,330
but I didn't do this.

116
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,740
There's no video of me in here.

117
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:59,430
Then why were you at school in the middle of the night?

118
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:05,400
 Jung Young Joo! 

119
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:14,000
See... you can't answer me.

120
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,750
Bring me the notebook now.

121
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:20,150
I don't know about any "notebook."

122
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:21,730
Why would I take it?

123
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:24,160
Because Lee Kang Hoon made you?

124
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:31,050
Every morning, you make a scene at the gates about returning Mr. Lee to his position.

125
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:34,790
Is blackmailing me the only method that occurred to you?

126
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,540
Did you think this kind of blackmail would work on me?

127
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:40,480
"Blackmail"?

128
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:52,480
You children don't know what's right and wrong.

129
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,900
If teachers seem even a little bit nice, you trust everything they say.

130
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:59,290
I understand.

131
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:01,750
The teacher who uses students is at fault.

132
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:04,970
How could anyone blame innocent students like you?

133
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:06,920
So...

134
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,730
Ki Joon...

135
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:13,630
Will you give back what you took?

136
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:17,040
I really don't know.

137
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,260
Don't you know how to knock?

138
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:27,180
It's not Ki Joon.

139
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:31,740
What are you talking about?

140
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:34,290
How do you know that?

141
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:36,280
Because I was with him.

142
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,490
I'm his witness.

143
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,830
You were with him?

144
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:44,580
Are you an accomplice?

145
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:49,120
You won your brother's trial thanks to Lee Kang Hoon.

146
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,940
Did you want to repay his kindness?

147
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:55,040
We didn't come into this room.

148
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:59,010
I don't want to hear anything more.

149
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:01,150
Choose one of these two options.

150
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:04,080
Either give me back the notebook, or

151
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,210
face a Guidance Committee meeting.

152
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:11,940
Ah... of course... such a meeting means you'll both be expelled.

153
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:15,640
We never did anything to be expelled for.

154
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:19,180
No?

155
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:21,720
Jung Young Joo,

156
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:25,940
you were supposed to be expelled, but I overlooked it.

157
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:30,230
And there's video of your forced entry.

158
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:35,440
Do you think you can take classes at my school after stealing so shamelessly?

159
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,260
"Stealing"?

160
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:39,790
What nonsenseâ€”

161
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,620
We didn't do anything.

162
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,580
Don't get worked up.

163
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:48,900
I'll only wait until lunchtime.

164
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:51,330
Bring me the notebook.

165
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:53,860
That's enough time, isn't it?

166
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:00,730
Come out.

167
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:04,800
Let's go.

168
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,070
Don't expect me to let this slide.

169
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:25,490
When your parents come in,

170
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:29,410
you can state your position in front of the Guidance Committee.

171
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:31,340
Tell your story properly, then.

172
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:33,310
I don't have any parents.

173
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:37,050
You must have some kind of guardian.

174
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,320
There's no one.

175
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:52,130
Then, find proof that you guys didn't do it.

176
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,470
I should have been more careful.

177
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:06,050
If I hadn't been caught by the CCTV,

178
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:08,490
this wouldn't have happened.

179
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:10,580
I'm sorry.

180
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:13,790
I'm the reason you're in this mess.

181
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:18,510
So think before you act.

182
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:22,800
Even in taekwondo, you only knew how to attack. You called it "your tactic."

183
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,400
Sorry.

184
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:28,350
To be fair... honestly...

185
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:31,860
If I found a way to get Mr. Lee back,

186
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,980
I would have done something too.

187
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:39,780
But I wouldn't have done it alone, like you.

188
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:41,990
Don't you have any friends?

189
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:43,810
What were you doing on your own?

190
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:46,930
Hey. What about you?

191
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:48,890
You were talking like you're all alone in this world.

192
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:51,380
What? No adults?

193
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:55,380
My mom would be sad if she heard that.

194
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:00,080
You have Ji Won's parents, too.

195
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,990
Jung Young Joo...

196
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,830
Yes, Ms. Song?

197
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:22,600
Okay.

198
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,590
What happened?

199
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:31,650
I have to go see Ms. Song. I'll tell you after that.

200
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:37,390
Are you also going?

201
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:40,650
Yes.

202
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:43,910
Hey. Why are you going?

203
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:45,520
She only asked for me.

204
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:48,520
The director said I'd be expelled too.

205
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,210
So I'm coming with you.

206
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:58,050
"Expelled"?

207
00:14:58,610 --> 00:14:59,650
What's going on?

208
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:02,200
Expelled for what?

209
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:07,900
What made you go there at night that's got you wrongly accused?

210
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:10,680
Why did you try to get in there?

211
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:13,250
We wanted the board-meetings log.

212
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:16,970
The board's record of meetings? Why would you need that?

213
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:21,600
We heard that the board rejected Mr. Lee's dismissal.

214
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,700
If we could just find the meeting's log,

215
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:28,280
Mr. Lee could come back.

216
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:38,780
Still, it's not right for you to try to get it for yourselves.

217
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:42,680
I'm sorry.

218
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:45,410
What's the notebook that Director Gu is asking for?

219
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:49,030
Is it the log of meetings that you're talking about?

220
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:51,930
We don't know about that.

221
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:54,170
Okay, I see.

222
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:57,270
Go back to class for now.

223
00:15:58,110 --> 00:15:59,570
Okay.

224
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:04,900
This isn't what you said when you had the officer leave.

225
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:11,630
I was trying to be considerate, so the students don't get a criminal record,

226
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,520
but they are lying so shamelessly.

227
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:18,180
There's no proof that they stole it.

228
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:21,630
How can you say that after seeing the CCTV video?

229
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:23,310
As you saw,

230
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:25,880
they weren't seen stealing anything.

231
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:29,890
Threatening to expel them is going too far.

232
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:34,590
"Too far"?

233
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:36,460
Ms. Song Chae Rin,

234
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:39,490
who am I?

235
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:42,020
I think you tend to forget sometimes.

236
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:45,550
I'm the Director of Nulji High.

237
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:51,050
How dare a regular teacher like you argue with me?

238
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:06,020
Director Gu said that we stole the notebook to blackmail her.

239
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:09,140
That means it contains something to blackmail her with.

240
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:10,920
Seeing that she sent the police away

241
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:13,580
and tried to resolve this on her own in secret,

242
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:15,930
doesn't that mean something is seriously illegal?

243
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:18,920
I think that's why she wants the book back as soon as possible.

244
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:22,030
She will call the Guidance Committee if it isn't back by lunchtime.

245
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:24,420
How can you return it when you didn't take it?

246
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:27,010
She's overreacting and being pushy.

247
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:31,420
Could there be a way for us to prove we didn't take it?

248
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:35,430
She said she'll expel you as soon as tomorrow.

249
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:37,320
How could we prove it by then?

250
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:41,530
Geez. I actually wish we had the notebook.

251
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:44,880
She couldn't do anything if we just exposed her.

252
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,680
I know.

253
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:49,840
Then...

254
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:54,160
that's what we should do.

255
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:54,290
Hey!

256
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:56,220
Where are you guys going?

257
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:58,110
Come back here!

258
00:18:58,110 --> 00:18:59,860
Gong Ki Joon!

259
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:02,450
Jung Young Joo!

260
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:11,710
Call their guardians.

261
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:15,040
The Guidance Committee meeting will take place tomorrow at five o'clock.

262
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,320
By tonight, even, I'll forgive them if they act sensibly

263
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:22,640
and show remorse. Tell their guardians to bring them in.

264
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:25,280
But...

265
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:29,080
there will be a problem if the committee meeting is held like this.

266
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:31,630
Who would be so arrogant as to cause an issue?

267
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:33,320
What I mean is...

268
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:36,940
We need to allow time for the committee to carefully consider the disciplinary action

269
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:39,250
as well as for students to explain themselvesâ€”

270
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,990
Are you trying to lecture me?

271
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:44,990
No.

272
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:52,960
So should we expose all of Director Gu's corruption to the public?

273
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,560
Yes.

274
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,810
Even without the notebook,

275
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:59,600
we can expose her with the things we've experienced.

276
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:02,830
I recorded all the times she tampered with students' records.

277
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:06,080
And all the internal school competitions are rigged.

278
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,900
As for Jin Sung University's competition,

279
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:11,700
I'm certain she manipulated it by bribing the university president.

280
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:14,310
But is this possible without definite proof?

281
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:17,250
They are bound to be exposed if they're fully investigated.

282
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:21,170
We can shake Director Gu just by suggesting suspicion.

283
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:24,590
It's a good idea,

284
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,950
but how do we expose her?

285
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:29,150
The Anti-Corruption and Civil Rights Commission of Cheongwadae? 
  (TN: South Korea's presidential residence) 

286
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:31,670
I'm pretty familiar with that bulletin board.

287
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:34,400
We will need 200,000 votes to get a response.

288
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,130
But things like "Corruption in education" and "Our school is weird" posts are so common thatâ€”

289
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:39,670
Bam!

290
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:41,200
It won't get noticed.

291
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,610
How do we get 200,000 votes when the Guidance Committee meets so soon?

292
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:46,920
It's hard. It's practically impossible.

293
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:50,490
My Ji Won knows best about the bulletin boards.

294
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:58,420
What about the news?

295
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:00,130
"News"?

296
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,350
Do you know any reporters?

297
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:06,750
Oh. We could just go to a broadcasting company,

298
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:10,410
grab a reporter who feels right, and ask for an article to be written?

299
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:12,000
I approve.

300
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:16,810
You wouldn't really do that, would you?

301
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:20,700
It's a bit weird, right?

302
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:27,100
The person who wrote your article.

303
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,570
Hey, right.

304
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:31,340
Let's call him right now.

305
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,800
I don't know his number.

306
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,130
Geez.

307
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,910
You're no help.

308
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:43,790
Hey, youâ€”

309
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:46,860
You smile brightly like that yet you say this to me?

310
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:48,860
- Youâ€” 
 - Oh, right!

311
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:51,000
Vice-President Jo Jae Min would know.

312
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,200
Call him right now.

313
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,780
Hold on.

314
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:03,370
Please...

315
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:10,360
 The line is currently busy. After the beep... 

316
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,730
He's not answering.

317
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:16,600
Of course. He's the vice-president, after all.

318
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,210
He's busy. He won't answer if people like usâ€”

319
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:20,650
Hi, Mr. Jo.

320
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:22,830
Yes, hello.

321
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:24,640
- Yes, yes. 
 - He took our call.

322
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,190
- I'm heading out now. 
 - Bye.

323
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:28,680
I'm off.

324
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:40,550
I've told all the Guidance Committee members, so you should call the parents.

325
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:54,470
 I gave him details over the phone. 

326
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:55,990
I said you are great guys.

327
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:58,600
I personally asked him to take good care of it,

328
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,800
so he'll write a great article.

329
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:05,250
Tell him all the unfair things you experienced at school.

330
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:08,630
I told him to make lots of time for it.

331
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,920
I understand.

332
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,990
Thank you, Mr. Jo.

333
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:14,400
Okay.

334
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,360
Are you Nulji High students?

335
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:24,180
It's good to meet you. I'm reporter Choi Hyun Gyu.

336
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:26,720
Hello.

337
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:31,630
I said not to bring those things home.

338
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:33,070
I'm sorry.

339
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:36,100
These needed approvals rather urgently.

340
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,290
Here you go.

341
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:46,240
Here.

342
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:51,450
Being a teacher is a very tiring job.

343
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:55,250
I'm worn out after school ends. I don't even want to move a finger.

344
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:57,220
Oh, I see.

345
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:59,510
Still, I respect you

346
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:02,260
for doing something so worthwhile.

347
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:08,850
Don't respect me and do your job, okay?

348
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:12,640
It feels like I'm the only one in this company.

349
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,460
I apologize.

350
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,700
Hello? What is it?

351
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:33,180
So you want to meet?

352
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,980
Right now?

353
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:40,020
Ah, so that was when you found out who I am!

354
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:49,260
Wow...

355
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:51,310
You even prepared this.

356
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:53,010
Wow!

357
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:56,790
You're more cunning than I realized.

358
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,440
 Yes? 

359
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,890
I'm pretty meticulous.

360
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:20,640
I just don't let it show.

361
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,900
So...

362
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:27,480
Why did you do something so irrational? What if I refused?

363
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:30,870
The fact that Director Gu is the biggest problem at our school,

364
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:33,070
Mr. Shin,

365
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:36,990
you know that better than anyone.

366
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:43,220
And Mr. Shin, I thought Director Gu would be your biggest hindrance.

367
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:45,910
So I made up my mind to help you.

368
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:48,170
That is why I was so irrational...

369
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:49,800
Sir.

370
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:53,530
I suddenly don't know how to address you.

371
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:55,990
Just do as before. Sudden change is awkward.

372
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:58,970
That's right. Aigoo.

373
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,530
But don't get too comfortable.

374
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:05,310
Yes, sir.

375
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,710
So...

376
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:21,670
someone who's been a teacher all his life broke into

377
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:25,300
Director Gu's office in the middle of the night,

378
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:28,690
smashed a drawer open and stole her notebook for this reason?

379
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:34,750
Well, there's no need to describe it in such detail like that.

380
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:36,780
Sure.

381
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:40,620
You've always worked hard at the bottom and were about to suffer more.

382
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:43,720
I can understand why you'd be mad.

383
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:52,070
That's all good.

384
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:55,340
I was also having a hard time because

385
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:58,010
I couldn't do anything to Aunt because of Dad.

386
00:26:58,010 --> 00:27:01,850
Having such perfect evidence makes my life easy.

387
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,410
Well then, our Director.

388
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:10,920
Goodness.

389
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:14,760
What would you like?

390
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:18,560
You're being so blatantâ€”

391
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:22,410
You're very straightforward.

392
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,400
I've actually been thinking...

393
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:33,380
I think I should continue down the path of an educator.

394
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:36,160
So what if I take charge of this school,

395
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:40,220
and do a good job running it for you, Mr. Shin?

396
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:42,470
I see.

397
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:52,380
So do you want to be the director?

398
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:55,530
Well... yes...

399
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:09,640
Then do that.

400
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,730
Sorry?

401
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:14,280
Let's push Aunt to the side, and you can take her place.

402
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:17,510
Do you mean it?

403
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,960
Oh, one thing, though.

404
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,610
You know I hate commotion, right?

405
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:26,300
Of course. Of course!

406
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:30,300
My nickname used to be "library" because I was so quiet.

407
00:28:39,290 --> 00:28:41,790
 Wow. This is amazing. 

408
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:45,440
This is enough to get into the top three items of Haerang News' social pages.

409
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,410
I'll give it my best.

410
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:48,870
Really?

411
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:49,790
Thank you so much.

412
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:54,060
If it becomes an article, will Director Gu be unable to do whatever she wants?

413
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:58,400
Definitely. She will have to be investigated by the Ministry of Education.

414
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:03,500
And once the meeting's record or the notebook is confiscated, everything will be revealed.

415
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,380
What about reinstating

416
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:08,410
the unfairly dismissed teacher?

417
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:10,810
I'm not sure,

418
00:29:10,810 --> 00:29:12,690
but I think it could be possible.

419
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:14,530
There's a high chance.

420
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:25,100
Good job.

421
00:29:25,810 --> 00:29:28,550
Aigoo, they're so simple-minded.

422
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:32,210
Those innocent children think that by having evidence, you can win anything.

423
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:35,950
Those "innocent children" are braver than I am.

424
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:37,230
Why bother, though?

425
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:39,770
They'll be kicked out like...

426
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:43,020
No way.

427
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:45,090
They can't kick students out so easily, right?

428
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:48,650
They didn't have a hard time kicking you and Mr. Kim out.

429
00:29:50,810 --> 00:29:53,860
What are we going to do about those guys?

430
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:00,400
That was so good.

431
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,570
It was.

432
00:30:02,570 --> 00:30:06,860
The ramen tastes better after a fruitful day.

433
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:12,160
What?

434
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,640
Are you laughing?

435
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:17,070
Aren't you going to your academy job today?

436
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:18,410
No, I'm not.

437
00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:21,410
I told the director I was busy here, and she gave me today off.

438
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:22,910
What?

439
00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:24,960
Mom knows we are here?

440
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:25,910
Yes.

441
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:29,160
She asked if you and I were close, and she seemed really happy.

442
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,310
Wow.

443
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:35,210
It's a free-pass when I hang out with a smart friend.

444
00:30:37,610 --> 00:30:39,920
Who is it? Answer it.

445
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:43,680
Yes, Mr. Lee?

446
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:46,300
You guys are so reckless.

447
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:50,000
If you have information like the meeting-log, you should tell me.

448
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,210
Why would you go and look for that?

449
00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:56,980
And I heard you guys left school without permission today.

450
00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:00,850
Geez. What were you thinking, leaving like that?

451
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:03,160
We just worked on some things.

452
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:06,050
You'll be surprised when you find out.

453
00:31:06,050 --> 00:31:07,290
Sorry?

454
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:09,220
No, I'm still at Ki Joon's.

455
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:11,300
Yes, we're all together.

456
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,490
Ah!

457
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:15,740
Mr. Lee wants to talk to you.

458
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:17,450
- Me? 
 - Yes.

459
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:20,270
Yes, Mr. Lee.

460
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:21,510
The signs?

461
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:24,910
Of course, I'm going to make them. I am. I'll make them.

462
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:26,390
Sorry?

463
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:29,720
Okay.

464
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,550
Got it.

465
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:33,330
All right.

466
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,600
What did he say?

467
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,340
He said there are only signs about unfair dismissal,

468
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:41,520
so we should make one to say that it's wrong to expel you two.

469
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,600
Geez.

470
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,570
What in the world!

471
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:47,830
Of course, right? Why should we be expelled?

472
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:49,890
So let's clear this and make signs.

473
00:31:49,890 --> 00:31:52,110
Don't play and you lose. Rock, paper, scissors.

474
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,810
- Rock, paper, scissors. 
 - Rock, paper, scissors.

475
00:31:53,810 --> 00:31:55,740
Oh, you two.

476
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:58,000
- He was late. 
 - Come on, rock, paper...

477
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,540
It's kind of surprising.

478
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:09,790
What? What is?

479
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:10,590
What is?

480
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:12,900
You don't like fighting.

481
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:16,930
But watching you fight for our carpentry teacher,

482
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:19,480
I can feel how sincere you are.

483
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:27,860
Mr. Lee is the one who made me realize I have a talent for carpentry.

484
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:30,670
I thought I wasn't good at anything.

485
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:35,530
I've come to like carpentry more thanks to Mr. Lee.

486
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:38,790
You must really like carpentry now.

487
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:43,820
Wow, Mr. Lee helped Gong Ki Joon learn to like doing something.

488
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:46,090
That's a lot to thank him for.

489
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:49,120
Hey, it's not just Mr. Lee.

490
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:52,420
There's also my grandpa... and you.

491
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,920
That's why I like it.

492
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,540
Really?

493
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:01,800
So can I tell Ji Won what you said?

494
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,890
Just Mr. Lee, grandpa and me?

495
00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:06,260
Don't be childish.

496
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:08,410
That's not what I meant.

497
00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:10,270
Ji Won is, man...

498
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:12,600
She's on a different level.

499
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,540
- "Different" how? 
 - Stop it. Stop it!

500
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:19,310
Is this funny to you?

501
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:29,320
Hurry up and help me find it.

502
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:31,600
   

503
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,340
"Director Gu..."

504
00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:41,350
Hey, Dad.

505
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:42,810
Hot chocolate?

506
00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:44,720
Oh, no. I'll come and get it.

507
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,040
I'm on the top floor. Okay.

508
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:51,210
You're going to trip. Why are you in such a hurry?

509
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:52,540
If my dad comes here,

510
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:55,130
we will be trapped with his dad-jokes for two hours.

511
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:56,860
I'm going downstairs.

512
00:33:56,860 --> 00:34:00,910
   

513
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:13,210
   

514
00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:16,470
Ki Joon...

515
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:17,730
What?

516
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:20,490
You have a call.

517
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:31,940
Hi.

518
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:34,230
Mom.

519
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,970
It's nothing.

520
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:41,000
I ate.

521
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:44,030
I'm good at cooking so don't worry about me.

522
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:51,350
I'm just doing carpentry and working.

523
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,640
Yes.

524
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:00,670
What?

525
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,190
What do you mean so suddenly?

526
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:09,140
Come to you?

527
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,110
Do you mean Canada?

528
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:16,990
Why would you say that...

529
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:36,750
I don't know.

530
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:41,210
I'll think about it.

531
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:12,040
So, Ki Joon's mom is in Canada.

532
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:15,480
Yes. Ki Joon's maternal relatives are all there.

533
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,760
They run a taekwondo studio.

534
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:21,730
I knew she called him every now and then,

535
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:24,730
but it feels a bit different this time.

536
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:29,850
I think she called to tell Ki Joon to join her.

537
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,640
That would make sense.

538
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:45,000
If he went there, he wouldn't have to worry about income.

539
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,730
He wouldn't be lonely, either.

540
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:49,940
I think it's a good thing for Ki Joon.

541
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:56,840
Let's go.

542
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:20,730
I can take the cups downstairs and wash them there.

543
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:22,990
Pardon?

544
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:26,440
I'm just washing them while I'm at it.

545
00:37:50,570 --> 00:37:54,230
Mom told me to join her.

546
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:04,350
She's worried since you're alone.

547
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:07,240
There are a lot of students at Uncle's taekwondo studio,

548
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,260
so I guess taekwondo is really popular there.

549
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:15,250
She said I could help coach and go to college there.

550
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:26,280
It feels weird.

551
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:30,260
In what way?

552
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:36,230
I don't know.

553
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:41,880
It must be because it's so sudden.

554
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,960
After a good night's sleep, tomorrow

555
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:47,970
you might wake up and feel excited and look forward to it.

556
00:38:50,450 --> 00:38:52,450
Do you think so?

557
00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:54,230
I do.

558
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:16,350
â™«  I want to know your thoughts because I can't read them  â™«

559
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:26,780
â™«  I get nervous sometimes because I like you  â™«

560
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:37,120
â™«  I want to see the swaying waves  â™«

561
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:46,430
â™«  I want to see you more on my way there  â™«

562
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:49,780
 Mom told me to join her. 

563
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:55,690
â™«  Another day  â™«

564
00:39:55,690 --> 00:40:00,890
â™«  Passes by again  â™«

565
00:40:00,890 --> 00:40:03,580
â™«  During that time, my heart isn't my own  â™«

566
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:05,250
 Come to you? 

567
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:07,850
 Do you mean Canada? 

568
00:40:07,850 --> 00:40:10,370
 Why would you say that... 

569
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,970
 Once you get a good night's sleep, tomorrow 

570
00:40:14,970 --> 00:40:18,910
 you might feel excited and look forward to it. 

571
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:22,210
â™«  And it makes me happy  â™«

572
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:31,010
â™«  Then, in the next moment, I ache  â™«

573
00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:54,260
Eun Bi, you'll be there as our company's representative,

574
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:55,830
so don't get intimidated

575
00:40:55,830 --> 00:40:58,840
and always stand out in the center. Don't back down.

576
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,130
Got it? 
    

577
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:02,580
And cameras are everywhere there,

578
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:04,070
so don't let your guard down.

579
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:05,730
   

580
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:07,600
   

581
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:21,780
   

582
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:32,000
   

583
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,960
- Mr. Lee! 
 - Hello.

584
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:58,150
You're here.

585
00:41:58,790 --> 00:42:00,270
Wow!

586
00:42:00,270 --> 00:42:04,790
The signs really stand out.

587
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:07,640
But...

588
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:13,340
I was nervous that you'd all get into trouble again for leaving school without permission.

589
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:16,710
But I'm glad you're all here without trouble.

590
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:21,090
I think we did cause trouble.

591
00:42:21,090 --> 00:42:22,740
What? A-Again?

592
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:24,700
Actually,

593
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:32,070
we asked a reporter at Haerang News to expose Director Gu's corruption, but it hasn't been published yet.

594
00:42:32,070 --> 00:42:35,280
What? You met a reporter? You guys?

595
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:40,410
He said the article would posted this morning, so we're still waiting.

596
00:42:40,410 --> 00:42:42,190
But it's not posted yet.

597
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:45,790
Once an article appears, the whole school and all the media will know.

598
00:42:45,790 --> 00:42:47,780
That will cause commotion.

599
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:52,160
Wow, you guys really are brave at problem-solving.

600
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:55,810
The article has to come out soon to stop today's committee meeting.

601
00:42:55,810 --> 00:42:57,880
I think it's too delayed.

602
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:00,800
We have to stop the Guidance Committee meeting.

603
00:43:01,590 --> 00:43:05,190
This is your school. Why would they do this to you?

604
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:07,630
Director Gu called it her school.

605
00:43:07,630 --> 00:43:09,840
"Her school"?

606
00:43:11,110 --> 00:43:14,610
Wow. She's seriously a dangerous person.

607
00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:18,970
Something is not right.

608
00:43:18,970 --> 00:43:20,980
Let's try calling Reporter Choi.

609
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:23,360
Okay.

610
00:43:34,210 --> 00:43:37,830
I was arguing for it all morning,

611
00:43:37,830 --> 00:43:40,380
but I'm afraid it won't be published.

612
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:43,600
I'm in charge of travel and leisure usually,

613
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:45,440
 so I don't have much power. 

614
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,110
 I'm sorry. 

615
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:54,640
Go inside.

616
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:55,960
It's upsetting.

617
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:59,400
Don't stand here. Go to class.

618
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:01,550
We're sorry.

619
00:44:01,550 --> 00:44:04,340
- I'm sorry. 
 - No, don't worry about it.

620
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:06,490
Go on.

621
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:23,690
Mr. Lee, don't you know any reporters?

622
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:28,770
If you hadn't stopped it, Press Director,

623
00:44:28,770 --> 00:44:30,970
I would've been like a sitting duck.

624
00:44:30,970 --> 00:44:33,000
My gosh...

625
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,930
I'm always indebted to you.

626
00:44:34,930 --> 00:44:37,830
I was reviewing the articles submitted this morning,

627
00:44:37,830 --> 00:44:39,710
and something felt off.

628
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:44,560
I looked, and he had written an unbelievably provocative article about you.

629
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:48,080
 Geez, it was so offensive to me. 

630
00:44:48,870 --> 00:44:53,870
I always remember that 50% of my education business is all your doing.

631
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:58,920
Oh, right. Isn't it about time to renew your golf club membership?

632
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:00,830
Right?

633
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:05,750
I'll tell my husband to renew it and send you a new one. Yes, yes.

634
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:10,660
All right, talk to you later.

635
00:45:16,970 --> 00:45:20,370
I overheard at the office that there will be a Guidance Committee meeting today.

636
00:45:20,370 --> 00:45:22,180
Really?

637
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:23,930
Oh, no.

638
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:28,140
We tried to stop it, but it didn't work.

639
00:45:31,990 --> 00:45:35,780
Maybe they should just have a proper police investigation.

640
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:39,000
How can a guidance committee meeting take place so hastily?

641
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,040
Just wait and see.

642
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:45,090
The committee will make the right decision.

643
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:48,430
The students protesting at the gate are right.

644
00:45:48,430 --> 00:45:52,200
This is definitely a private-school foundation tyranny.

645
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:54,330
"Tyranny"?

646
00:45:54,330 --> 00:45:57,990
How can a teacher at a private-school foundation say that?

647
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:18,440
Mom. You can't get too worked up.

648
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:20,160
Don't worry about me.

649
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:23,560
I'm just going to tell her to lay out the truth.

650
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:26,570
How dare she treat our children like thieves?

651
00:46:26,570 --> 00:46:30,110
We know Young Joo and Ki Joon would never do such a thing.

652
00:46:30,110 --> 00:46:33,070
- How dare sheâ€” 
 - No, Mom.

653
00:46:33,070 --> 00:46:37,390
Calm down. We have to fight this calmly.

654
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:43,840
All right.

655
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:46,220
Let's go.

656
00:46:56,490 --> 00:47:00,860
Guidance Committee to that end, please.

657
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:08,430
Now we're just waiting for the principal and the director.

658
00:47:08,430 --> 00:47:10,030
Yes.

659
00:47:29,610 --> 00:47:31,570
You should go in.

660
00:47:46,510 --> 00:47:49,280
Teaching Director, look here.

661
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:55,400
Geez.

662
00:47:55,950 --> 00:47:57,940
What in the...

663
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:08,840
Director Gu.

664
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:11,860
I think you should look at this.

665
00:48:14,020 --> 00:48:17,040
 So you were appointed to the position and then dismissed by Director Gu, 
   

666
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:19,950
 but you were dismissed unfairly? 
   
  

667
00:48:19,950 --> 00:48:20,990
 Yes. 
   

668
00:48:20,990 --> 00:48:23,810
 I heard that the board rejected the dismissal, 
   

669
00:48:23,810 --> 00:48:26,470
 but Director Gu went ahead anyway. 
   

670
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:29,030
 - Right? 
 - Yes, that's right. 

671
00:48:29,030 --> 00:48:32,300
 If firing a teacher is this easy, what about the students? 

672
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:37,140
 She's currently holding a Guidance Committee meeting to expel students without any evidence. 

673
00:48:37,140 --> 00:48:38,910
 That's right. There's no evidence. 

674
00:48:38,910 --> 00:48:40,960
 I see. 

675
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:43,450
Oh, and you're currently attending Nulji High?

676
00:48:43,450 --> 00:48:46,660
Yes. I'm in the 11th grade.

677
00:48:46,660 --> 00:48:48,270
I'm Director Gu's niece.

678
00:48:48,270 --> 00:48:49,900
That's right.

679
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:53,220
Are you okay with saying that?

680
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:55,700
Yes.

681
00:49:11,090 --> 00:49:12,720
Ms. Song Chae Rin.

682
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:15,570
For now, show them out.

683
00:49:16,230 --> 00:49:18,570
Isn't the committee meeting about to start?

684
00:49:18,570 --> 00:49:23,450
For now, I think the meeting is canceled.

685
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:28,130
What do you mean?

686
00:49:28,130 --> 00:49:30,950
Do you mean our boys' charges are lifted?

687
00:49:30,950 --> 00:49:34,000
Well...

688
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:37,190
Director Gu.

689
00:49:37,190 --> 00:49:39,860
Say something.

690
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:48,520
I'm very proud of what we did.

691
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:51,370
Nulji High, fighting!

692
00:49:51,370 --> 00:49:53,440
- Fighting! 
 - Fighting, fighting.

693
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:56,270
- Fighting fighting. 
 - Fighting.

694
00:49:56,270 --> 00:49:59,180
For Mr. Lee's reinstatement!

695
00:49:59,180 --> 00:50:00,890
Cheers!

696
00:50:00,890 --> 00:50:03,490
I thought we just did it once.

697
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:09,660
Why are you copying your dad?

698
00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:13,120
You don't know anything. You have to do these kinds of things.

699
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:16,480
- Is that so? 
 - Yes.

700
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,140
So...

701
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:22,750
Mr. Lee and Lee Jae Hee are a completely unexpected duo.

702
00:50:22,750 --> 00:50:25,830
Yes. Jae Hee's really interesting.

703
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:29,360
Her family must be in a mess right now.

704
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:32,290
I'm worried for Jae Hee.

705
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:37,890
It's out.

706
00:50:50,870 --> 00:50:53,380
Wow. So much!

707
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:55,950
- Looks so good. 
 - Isn't this expensive?

708
00:50:55,950 --> 00:50:59,460
No. Don't worry and eat up.

709
00:51:00,330 --> 00:51:01,930
So...

710
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:08,390
why are you two buying?

711
00:51:13,930 --> 00:51:16,960
You got into trouble because Young Joo went to school at night.

712
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:18,610
I see...

713
00:51:18,610 --> 00:51:19,730
Right.

714
00:51:19,730 --> 00:51:25,410
Yes. I was going to pay for all of it, but Seo Young offered to help.

715
00:51:25,410 --> 00:51:28,060
I see...

716
00:51:28,060 --> 00:51:32,450
So, Seo Young is buying because of Young Joo.

717
00:51:32,450 --> 00:51:34,800
And because of Young Joo, Seo Youngâ€“

718
00:51:36,970 --> 00:51:42,200
Anyway, Seo Young and Young Joo, thanks for the food.

719
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:44,620
It looks amazing. Let's eat.

720
00:51:49,250 --> 00:51:51,320
What?

721
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:53,190
What is it?

722
00:51:55,970 --> 00:51:57,360
Wow!

723
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:01,430
Hey. It's so good!

724
00:52:01,430 --> 00:52:02,960
- It's good? 
 - It is.

725
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:05,650
   

726
00:52:05,650 --> 00:52:12,250
   

727
00:52:33,990 --> 00:52:38,190
   

728
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:46,700
Why aren't you leaving?

729
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:49,480
We have to hurry and clean up here.

730
00:52:50,590 --> 00:52:52,910
This is not fair.

731
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:56,960
Why do they believe Jae Hee's naive words?

732
00:52:57,630 --> 00:53:01,140
And they believe the words of Lee Kang Hoon who was fired?

733
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:12,480
The investigation results haven't come out yet.

734
00:53:16,350 --> 00:53:19,240
This is unfair dismissal.

735
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:24,830
It's unfair dismissal for now. But this would change the story.

736
00:53:27,550 --> 00:53:29,470
Did Gong Ki Joon go to you?

737
00:53:29,470 --> 00:53:31,280
Gong Ki Joon?

738
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:33,370
Oh, the 11th grade...

739
00:53:33,370 --> 00:53:35,180
Why doubt him so recklessly?

740
00:53:35,180 --> 00:53:37,890
You're not fit to be an educator, Aunt.

741
00:53:37,890 --> 00:53:39,910
It wasn't Gong Ki Joon?

742
00:53:39,910 --> 00:53:43,270
Aigoo. You're not fit to be an educator.

743
00:53:43,270 --> 00:53:45,910
You're no good at reading people.

744
00:53:45,910 --> 00:53:49,490
Don't trust the people closest to you.

745
00:53:57,230 --> 00:53:58,870
The teaching directorâ€“

746
00:53:58,870 --> 00:54:00,160
Bingo.

747
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:03,670
You've caused too much commotion, Aunt.

748
00:54:04,420 --> 00:54:06,750
Hurry up and pack.

749
00:54:29,580 --> 00:54:31,990
Ah, those twins.

750
00:54:31,990 --> 00:54:33,890
Now I understand everything.

751
00:54:33,890 --> 00:54:37,450
Hey, no one could win against the director's niece and nephew.

752
00:54:37,450 --> 00:54:38,440
- Right? 
 - I know.

753
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:41,120
But your grade  and rank would stay the same.

754
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:42,560
You little...

755
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:45,280
- Mine stay the same, too. 
 - I know.

756
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:48,930
I hope Jae Hee isn't scolded.

757
00:54:48,930 --> 00:54:53,290
Yes. After all, she did a good thing.

758
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:56,450
Jae Hee's nice, but what's wrong with Lee Jae Hyeok?

759
00:54:56,450 --> 00:54:57,880
Jae Hyeok?

760
00:54:57,880 --> 00:55:01,080
- Jae Hyeok is nice too. 
 - What are you saying?

761
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:02,720
   

762
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:05,180
- The two of them do seem alike. 
 -    

763
00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:07,650
His personality totally sucks.

764
00:55:07,650 --> 00:55:09,790
   

765
00:55:11,050 --> 00:55:15,820
   

766
00:55:15,820 --> 00:55:21,320
So if Director Gu is fired, our school will get better, right?

767
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:23,750
I wonder what kind of person the new director will be.

768
00:55:23,750 --> 00:55:25,680
We'll find out at the public hearing tomorrow.

769
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:27,820
"Public hearing"? What public hearing so suddenly?

770
00:55:27,820 --> 00:55:29,370
Oh, what did they say again?

771
00:55:29,370 --> 00:55:33,740
The head of the Foundation will announce a plan to improve our school or something.

772
00:55:33,740 --> 00:55:37,580
I heard a lot of the school's parent leaders and local residents are coming.

773
00:55:37,580 --> 00:55:39,170
There will be a lot of reporters too.

774
00:55:39,170 --> 00:55:41,140
I'm class president, so I have to attend.

775
00:55:41,140 --> 00:55:45,120
Oh, I see. I hope the head of the Foundation is a good person.

776
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:49,120
I hope he listens to people and changes the school.

777
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:51,370
Even if it doesn't change like that,

778
00:55:51,370 --> 00:55:56,170
I just hope he can stop sending us to bad companies to raise employment rates.

779
00:55:56,170 --> 00:55:57,440
- Yes. 
 - True.

780
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:01,170
I hope he can add pink to our school uniform.

781
00:56:01,170 --> 00:56:05,310
Seriously, I just hope he can make the school pork katsu bigger.

782
00:56:05,310 --> 00:56:09,100
Enough. We're discussing the improvement for our school, guys.

783
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:11,040
Hey, this will be the biggest improvement.

784
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:12,530
- Bigger katsu means improvement. 
 - No.

785
00:56:12,530 --> 00:56:14,740
   

786
00:56:21,060 --> 00:56:23,210
Test, test.

787
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:26,940
I wonder what kind of person the director is.

788
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:30,620
Geez, what fuss is this?

789
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:32,550
The head of the Foundation isn't here yet.

790
00:56:32,550 --> 00:56:33,650
It looks like it.

791
00:56:33,650 --> 00:56:36,430
What the heck? He has everyone gathered here.

792
00:56:36,430 --> 00:56:39,290
So what plan is he going to suggest?

793
00:56:39,290 --> 00:56:41,430
We'll find out soon.

794
00:56:41,430 --> 00:56:44,450
The public hearing will begin shortly.

795
00:56:44,450 --> 00:56:49,110
Everyone, please be seated.

796
00:56:50,420 --> 00:56:52,840
Why isn't the principal here?

797
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:55,910
I didn't invite him since he would just cause a scene.

798
00:56:55,910 --> 00:57:01,800
Now, we shall begin the public hearing for a better future for

799
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:04,260
Nulji Science and Technology High School.

800
00:57:04,260 --> 00:57:08,510
Firstly, I know all of you must be busy.

801
00:57:08,510 --> 00:57:11,900
Thank you so much for coming.

802
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:19,140
Several big and small changes regarding the operation of our school have taken place recently.

803
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:22,300
But as they say, happiness and misfortune are always shifting.

804
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:24,740
I believe this is only a winter-like phase

805
00:57:24,740 --> 00:57:30,500
that we must pass through for beautiful flowers to bloom.

806
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:35,240
I'd like to introduce you to the person guiding us through this time.

807
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:37,450
He is the son of CEO Shin Eul Seop,

808
00:57:37,450 --> 00:57:40,570
the founder of our Nulji Science and Technology High School.

809
00:57:40,570 --> 00:57:44,270
He is temporarily leading the school as the head of the Foundation

810
00:57:44,270 --> 00:57:47,340
until we find a new director.

811
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:52,440
Mr. Shin Cheol Min, please come up to the podium.

812
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:57,040
Mr. Shin?

813
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:59,880
- Oh my. 
 - What's going on?

814
00:58:25,660 --> 00:58:32,450
First, I feel deeply responsible for causing an unfortunate incident.

815
00:58:32,450 --> 00:58:36,660
I realized this was the limit of our Foundation,

816
00:58:36,660 --> 00:58:40,490
and I felt a deep sense of regret.

817
00:58:40,490 --> 00:58:45,550
I made this decision after suffering many sleepless nights.

818
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:55,660
If we cannot provide a proper education, we must close the school.

819
00:58:55,660 --> 00:58:57,350
- What? 
 - Close it?

820
00:58:57,350 --> 00:58:58,880
What does he mean?

821
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:00,600
- What? 
 - Closing the school?

822
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:04,560
I have a question!

823
00:59:05,110 --> 00:59:09,130
What do you mean exactly by "close the school"?

824
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:16,000
- It's just as I said. 
 - What?

825
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:19,960
Getting rid of the school?

826
00:59:21,700 --> 00:59:27,160
Nulji Science and Technology High School will be shut down.

827
00:59:29,140 --> 00:59:32,170
What?

828
00:59:32,170 --> 00:59:34,210
What's he saying?

829
00:59:44,670 --> 00:59:52,810
 Timing and Subtitles by the ðŸŽ¶ Sing for a dream ðŸŽ¤ Team @ viki 

830
00:59:55,040 --> 01:00:03,310
â™«  Dream on, dream on, dream on  â™«

831
01:00:03,310 --> 01:00:10,610
â™«  Dream on, dream on, dream on  â™«

832
01:00:10,610 --> 01:00:19,770
â™«  My heart keeps thinking of you. I can't even understand myself  â™«

833
01:00:19,770 --> 01:00:23,000
   

834
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,020
 The ultimate boss? Who? 

835
01:00:25,020 --> 01:00:26,380
 Are you playing around? 

836
01:00:26,380 --> 01:00:27,870
 The school is closing. What nonsense. 

837
01:00:27,870 --> 01:00:29,540
 Whatever you want. 

838
01:00:29,540 --> 01:00:33,320
 Even if the school shuts down, you must push through with your goal. 

839
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:37,730
 I thought it was because I felt grateful you. 

840
01:00:37,730 --> 01:00:40,290
 Can I speak first? 

841
01:00:40,290 --> 01:00:42,790
 What's going on? Were you eliminated already? 

842
01:00:42,790 --> 01:00:44,350
 Ki Joon! 

843
01:00:44,350 --> 01:00:47,670
 I've reserved your plane ticket already. 

844
01:00:47,670 --> 01:00:49,450
 Have you made your decision? 

845
01:00:49,450 --> 01:00:51,520
 What about Ji Won? 

846
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:53,830
 I thought about it, 

847
01:00:53,830 --> 01:00:59,240
 and I think it would be better if you go with your mom. 

848
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:03,000
â™«  It sparkles again  â™«
