1
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:09,870
   

2
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:28,830
 I quit taekwondo. 

3
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:31,070
 What should I do now? 
   

4
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:35,700
 I've dreamed of becoming a carpenter since elementary school. I have never changed that dream. 

5
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,500
 - Ki Joon and Ji Won... 
 - You are doing this on purpose, right? 
   

6
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,640
 Are they enemies or lovers? 

7
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,360
 I'm sorry you keep getting involved with me, 

8
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,250
 but I don't have the leisure to avoid you these days. 

9
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:45,870
Don't talk to me, you bastard.

10
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:47,950
 I don't want to die. 

11
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:51,150
 It seems as if you don't like something, again. Hey! 
   

12
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:53,280
 What will happen to our class? 
   

13
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,160
What? Do y-you have a complaint? 
    

14
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,730
 He didn't seem like a bad guy, though. 
   

15
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:00,020
 What on earth happened to you in the past? 

16
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:01,880
You should date me.

17
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,410
 He was definitely a child. 
   

18
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:09,260
   

19
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:11,300
   

20
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:12,890
   

21
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:16,880
 Every legend has a beginning. 
   

22
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:21,710
 School, KBS' legendary drama has continued for 22 years. 
   

23
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:23,650
 Shall we review them together? 

24
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:25,450
   

25
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:27,740
   

26
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:33,010
 In 1999 a never before seen drama appeared. 

27
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:35,790
 It was the birth of School. 

28
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:40,240
 With themes like school violence, bullies, outcasts, and physical punishment, 

29
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,050
 the drama marked its beginning with shocking topics. 

30
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,800
Wasn't I the true outcast of our class?

31
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:56,320
 The entry point of countless celebrities, as well as their beginnings. 

32
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,070
Hey. Get in line. 
    

33
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:06,050
Hey, Bitch! Does this kind Senior look like a pushover to you? 
    

34
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:11,930
 The real school drama that showed the unseen sides of school. 

35
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:16,350
 That's how the legend of School began. 

36
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,760
   

37
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,490
 After the explosive popularity of the first season, 

38
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:26,340
 the second season aired in just two months. 

39
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,900
He's becoming worse every day, isn't he?

40
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:34,680
 The students with colorful personalities and their turbulent coming of age stories. 

41
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:39,220
Hey, Lee Han! I looked everywhere for you.

42
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:41,370
Leave it in my seat.

43
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:43,460
   

44
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:45,910
Aren't you going to class?

45
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:50,920
 There were so many hot Sunbaes. 

46
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:55,170
 He rose as the icon of youth with his inescapable charisma. 

47
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,700
Hye Jin! 
    

48
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:05,540
Hye Jin, you make me feel touched these days. 
  You can witness the charming rookie days of Lee Yo Won and Ha Ji Won. 

49
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:09,780
   

50
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,930
 He's finally here. 
   

51
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:19,230
 School 3 is Jo In Sung's debut work. 

52
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:26,480
 He marked himself as an unforgettable existence with his charismatic gaze. 

53
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,470
Pass?

54
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:34,430
Tell me straight.

55
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:38,660
 Despite his usual rugged appearance, he would have cute exchanges with his friends. 

56
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:41,980
   

57
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:47,150
 With his out of this world looks and good acting, 

58
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:49,660
 he became a lead star in a flash. 

59
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:53,240
   

60
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:58,270
 

61
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:02,100
   

62
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,410
   

63
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:07,430
 Wow, I want to listen to this song forever. 

64
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:09,800
♪ You'll never forget me ♪

65
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,130
   

66
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:17,020
   

67
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:21,360
 The School that aired in 2001 was set at an art high school. 

68
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:25,810
 Oh! Their uniform is similar to ours. 
   

69
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:28,940
 I get an unexplainable fever and headache every night. 

70
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:31,560
 Gong Yoo was a music student. 

71
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:35,130
 He was loved for his free-spiritedness. 

72
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:44,750
 Lee Yu Ri was a rebellious fine arts student. 

73
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,940
 What are you going to do studying western painting? 

74
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:49,570
-  Are you going to do fine arts? 
 - Mom! 

75
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:54,150
Forget it! I'll just give up on everything and get tutored to go to a liberal arts college.

76
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:56,220
Happy now?

77
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,830
 Even in confusion, sadness, and pain, 

78
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:05,200
 there was happiness as long as there was an understanding friend. 

79
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,310
 It was a school for all of us. 

80
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,530
   

81
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:13,410
   

82
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:16,380
 We waited twelve years. 

83
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:20,250
   

84
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:24,570
 School 2013 returned again in 2013. 

85
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:28,150
 - I loved watching this. 
 - Me, too. 

86
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:30,660
   

87
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,540
 It was around then that we were old enough to watch School. 

88
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:37,070
 Yes, indeed. 

89
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,760
Give it to me.

90
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,940
- Leave him alone. 
 - Be quiet.

91
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:45,500
I'll give it back to you when you come to the office after class. We need to talk.

92
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,680
I have nothing to say to you.

93
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:53,260
Seriously.

94
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:55,370
Hey! Oh Jung Ho!

95
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:59,370
Hey, someone stop him!

96
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:01,740
Someone stop Oh Jung Ho! 
    

97
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:07,380
 It vividly painted the reality of school where the teachers' authority had disappeared, 

98
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:10,520
 and many could empathize with the story. 

99
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:16,710
Greet them. 
    

100
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,510
The name's Park Heung Soo.

101
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:22,310
 - I love it so much. 
 - Yes. 

102
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:23,740
I look forward to joining your class.

103
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,820
   

104
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:32,840
 The friendship of these two guys got more popular with each episode. 

105
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:37,840
 Lee Jong Suk and Kim Woo Bin remained the symbol of bromance for a long time. 

106
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,020
   

107
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:42,500
 - They're so famous. 
 - I watched all the behind-the-scenes. 

108
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:46,740
   

109
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:54,400
 And in 2015, School reappeared with a different atmosphere. 

110
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:04,740
   

111
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,130
What in the world?

112
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:11,700
 Kim So Hyun took on the role of two twin characters, showing off her acting skills. 

113
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:14,090
You're finally in one place.

114
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:19,950
Since we are introducing ourselves, is it okay if I take our picture?

115
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:21,520
 The two rising stars, 

116
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:25,820
This angle looks better. 
  Yook Sungjae and Nam Joo Hyuk's chemistry is worth watching. 

117
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,380
Look, look.

118
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:35,900
 But actually... 

119
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:39,670
 The two were unfortunately love rivals. 

120
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:41,940
How are you together?

121
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,000
I go to this academy.

122
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:48,160
 Oh, my God. 

123
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,140
 Oh, no... 

124
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:53,320
   

125
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:56,180
I will go alone.

126
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,060
I want to go alone.

127
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:02,170
 The heated rivalry of love. 
   

128
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:04,170
 Who was the winner? 

129
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:09,300
 There is a repeated happening at school... 
   

130
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,560
   

131
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,020
If this happens one more time, the school will do something about it!

132
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:17,270
He's more meticulous and precise than expected.

133
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:22,920
 Mysterious things happened at school when it returned in 2017. 

134
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:25,210
Who on earth could be doing this?

135
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:27,620
The culprit of the incident is...

136
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:31,940
Daebak. 
    

137
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:37,670
 The drama created a new style with a spoonful of mystery. 

138
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:43,860
   

139
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,460
   

140
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:48,760
   

141
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:51,570
   

142
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:56,120
 - And finally... 
 - The eighth School has opened! 

143
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,320
 The school that we plan out in a drawing. 

144
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:01,860
 The school that we build. 

145
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,900
 School 2021. 

146
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:11,660
The sunbaes who appeared in the School series were so great. 
    

147
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:14,140
I'll do my best not to mess it up.

148
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:19,940
I'll work harder and do my best to make a good drama.

149
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:24,560
   

150
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,440
 I fell. 

151
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:32,610
♫  Dream on, dream on, dream on  ♫

152
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:36,260
 I got up, but I lost my way. 

153
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:40,250
♫  Dream on, dream on  ♫

154
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:43,600
 Where am I supposed to go now? 

155
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:49,610
- Wow! 
 - Let's go. 
    

156
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:51,110
   

157
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:57,420
 These teens chose their unique paths at a specialized high school. 

158
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:59,610
Stay strong. Fighting!

159
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:01,420
 Our class atmosphere is a mess. 

160
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:03,220
What? Do you have a problem?

161
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:05,590
 He doesn't seem like a bad guy. 

162
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:08,000
 I have dreamed of becoming a carpenter since elementary school. 

163
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,460
 This dream has never changed.

♫  Dream on, dream on, dream on.  ♫

165
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,150
 The dreams and friendships of eighteen-year-old teens. 

166
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:19,580
 Their exciting coming of age story. 

167
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,820
 Coming to you soon! 

168
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:29,850
   

169
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:33,270
   

170
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:37,750
 The bold eighteen-year-olds chose different paths instead of competing to get into college. 

171
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,710
 Are you curious about who we are? 

172
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:42,190
♫  Dream on  ♫

173
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:45,990
 Nulji High School eleventh grade, class 1, gather around! 

174
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:49,790
 Ki Joon, me, Young Joo, and Seo Young. 

175
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:54,740
 You can tell we are all unique, gathered in one class. 

176
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,360
 Wait, isn't this the attendance for our class? 

177
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,010
 Yes, I think you're right. 

178
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:05,020
   

179
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:09,140
   

180
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:12,110
   

181
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:16,690
 I was really looking forward to the reading because I wanted to see everyone. 

182
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:18,370
   

183
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:22,780
Hello, I'm Kim Yo Han, playing Gong Ki Joon in School 2021. 
    

184
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:23,770
Great to meet you.

185
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:27,240
I quit taekwondo that I did for 11 years since elementary school.

186
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,800
He's a student who ran towards one goal,

187
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,830
but lost his dream in a single moment.

188
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:35,250
I'm doing this for money, not for my dream.

189
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:36,900
He tries not to show it at school.

190
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,110
I told you not to hang around me.

191
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:39,450
I'm a regular here.

192
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:41,510
But he does have a painful secret.

193
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:42,790
You kissed me.

194
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:44,780
When? Am I crazy? That was definitely a mistake.

195
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:46,330
Do you like me?

196
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:47,630
Why are you overreacting?

197
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:49,370
He's actually quite a meddler.

198
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:51,640
I think he's charming in that way.

199
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,730
I actually graduated from a physical education high school.

200
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:57,280
I think I did nothing but work out when I was eighteen.

201
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,290
I didn't even have time to focus on anything else.

202
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:04,330
I was a student, working hard to become a member of the national team.

203
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:05,610
   

204
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:08,670
 What kind of a student is Ki Joon? 

205
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:10,860
   

206
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:14,140
   

207
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:14,840
 Ki Joon is the protagonist who wanted to become 

208
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,790
 Ki Joon is the protagonist who wanted to become 

209
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:21,580
 a taekwondo athlete, but quit his dream due to an injury. 

210
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:26,470
 But there was no time to mope around. 

211
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:28,940
   

212
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,670
 Where am I supposed to go now? 

213
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:42,730
How are you?

214
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:44,240
What do I do now?

215
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,630
   

216
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:49,470
 Please look forward to Ki Joon's brilliant coming-of-age story. 
   

217
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:51,800
No more unreasonable and unfair dismissals!

218
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,320
Me. I get to go on-site, right?

219
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,560
- I'll do it. 
  - It's me. 

220
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:58,420
I'm Jo Yi Hyun, playing the role of Jin Ji Won 
    

221
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:02,240
in KBS' new drama, School 2021. Great to meet you.

222
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,250
Please focus on my skills, not those rumors.

223
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:07,590
I have dreamed of becoming a carpenter since elementary school and it hasn't changed at all.

224
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:10,750
Jin Ji Won is,

225
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:13,080
despite her young age,

226
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:16,670
a high school student who is bold and sensible, and who has a clear dream.

227
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,800
She's a very smart and bright girl.

228
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:23,700
I think those are Ji Won's charms.

229
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:27,790
I want to become a bright person like that through Ji Won

230
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:32,370
so I'm studying and researching those traits.

231
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:36,170
 Yay, it's my turn now! 

232
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:38,370
   

233
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,480
   

234
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:46,440
No more unreasonable and unfair dismissals!

235
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,170
Outrageous!

236
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:53,100
- This is an unreasonable dismissal! 
  - Unreasonable dismissal. 

237
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:57,680
That's about it for the talk with your sunbae.

238
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,570
- If anyone's interested— 
 - Me.

239
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:02,130
I get to go on-site, right? I want to do it.

240
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:04,530
 I have dreamed of becoming a carpenter since elementary school. 

241
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:07,310
It has never changed.

242
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:09,810
I hope they grow well.

243
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:11,740
   

244
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:14,600
- Just stop it! 
 - What? Stop what?

245
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:19,800
Be ordinary and go to college. Barely graduate only to be jobless and burden you and Dad? That kind of ordinary?

246
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,400
I won't live like that.

247
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:27,960
 Will I be able to protect my precious dream? 

248
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,620
   

249
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,210
- Really? 
 - Really.

250
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:32,980
Then try it again.

251
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:34,450
   

252
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,810
   

253
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,980
   

254
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,770
   

255
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:44,280
 I'm curious. What is there between you two? 

256
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,310
 What? 

257
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:47,750
 What do you mean? 

258
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,370
   

259
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:53,590
Did you see the reason for upright Mr. Moo Kyung's dismissal?

260
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:56,240
- I heard it would rain. 
 - Mind your own business.

261
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,410
   

262
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:59,250
 He's really leaving. 

263
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:01,260
Anyone else?

264
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:04,030
 - We are just friends. Friends.  
 - Me, too.

265
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,180
Y-You, too?

266
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:08,150
What are you doing? Well?

267
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:09,320
Hey, Gong Ki Joon.

268
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:12,090
- You're doing this on purpose, right? 
 - What are you talking about?

269
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:15,200
Ki Joon and Ji Won, are they enemies or lovers?

270
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,730
Don't talk to me.

271
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:18,570
   

272
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:19,840
I'm here to eat jjolmyeon.

273
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,130
They don't sell to jerks like you. 
    

274
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:25,000
I'm Chu Yeong Woo, playing Jung Young Joo in School 2021. 
    

275
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,530
You transferred here; don't you have any questions? 
    

276
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:29,230
He's a transfer student with a secret no one knows about.

277
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:31,010
You're really quiet.

278
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:34,590
He has a mysterious air. He's pretty quiet.

279
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:36,650
 I finally arrived. 

280
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:40,120
   

281
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:46,840
 Young Joo is someone with a painful past, trying to find his way. It's sad to see. 

282
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:50,000
 I only wish that period doesn't last long for him. 

283
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,430
- Young Joo. 
 - Don't talk to me, you bastard.

284
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:55,040
I don't want to die.

285
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:59,240
 You don't believe all you see is all there is, do you? 

286
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:03,540
Young Joo appears tough on the outside,

287
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:06,550
and although he's more mature than the others,

288
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:10,930
he has a warm and soft heart. That's what I want to portray.

289
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:16,790
Jung Young Joo.

290
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:18,850
   

291
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:31,360
 By chance, do I like you? 

292
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,680
   

293
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,080
 I don't know. 

294
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:38,100
 Ki Joon and Ji Won are longtime friends. 

295
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,410
 And Young Joo comes in between them. 

296
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:43,740
 How will this love triangle end? 

297
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,970
 Find out when it airs! 

298
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:48,500
I came to this school so I could get into this college.

299
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:51,050
It's the top school I can get in the specialized skill field.

300
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:52,400
Hello.

301
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:56,240
I'm Hwang Boreumbyeol, playing the role of Kang Seo Young in School 2021. 
    

302
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,370
A pleasure to meet you.

303
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:02,200
As you can see from my last year's transcript, I never missed the top rank in my studies.

304
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:06,750
I think she's the one who is the most practical.

305
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:09,360
Continuing to pursue me repeatedly because I don't fall for you,

306
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,490
that's called stalking.

307
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:15,270
I think she's a character who is bold and ambitious.

308
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:18,580
Not many people would believe me,

309
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:26,390
but I was a student who only studied quietly by myself.

310
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:33,460
So I could relate to Seo Young's desperation to study well and get good grades.

311
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:37,400
 Our class' star student, Seo Young. 

312
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,300
   

313
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,210
   

314
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:46,900
What is this?

315
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,040
Are you satisfied? Aren't you embarrassed?

316
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,140
I will get into this college.

317
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:53,380
Why this college and this major?

318
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:56,830
It's the top school I can get in the specialized skill field.

319
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:59,730
 I'm embarrassed to be saying this myself, 

320
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:04,300
 but our cast really is a fully packaged gift set, without flaw. 

321
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:07,500
 You're absolutely right. 

322
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,430
 Now, we will introduce the pride of School 2021, 

323
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:13,650
 the golden line up. 

324
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:17,460
Do you know Nulji High School over there?

325
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:20,060
I'm actor Jeon Seok Ho, playing the role of Lee Kang Hoon. 
    

326
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:22,520
- It's a pleasure to meet you.
 -  Hi, Mr. Lee. 

327
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,880
 Hello. 

328
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:28,520
 The viewers must be curious, too, but he's an adult who is continuing to grow through his students. 

329
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:31,450
 So he works with the students 

330
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:35,680
and learns alongside them at times.

331
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,780
He's almost an adult-like student.

332
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,830
Mr. Lee.

333
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:42,750
You studied architectural design at Jin Sung University, right?

334
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:47,400
As you can see from my last year's transcript, I never missed the top rank in my studies.

335
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,850
Volunteer work, extracurricular clubs, competitions.

336
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:53,750
 - He's a little nervous  
 - Right.

337
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:54,980
 because he has to get off work. 

338
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:57,540
What's your name?

339
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:59,110
Kang Seo Young.

340
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:00,910
Okay, Seo Young.

341
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:02,600
Let's talk tomorrow.

342
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:06,580
   

343
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:12,950
 Our mood maker, Ho Sung is finally here. 

344
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:15,500
Ki Joon, what is your dream?

345
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,940
I have a new dream.

346
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:20,260
I will be a basketball player.

347
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:22,050
- I have a new dream. 
  - I have a new dream. 

348
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:23,720
- I'll be a professional gamer. 
 -  I'll be a professional gamer. 

349
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,250
I have a new dream.

350
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:27,090
- Again? 
 - Eun Bi's husband.

351
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:29,810
   

352
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:31,870
You know, right?

353
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:36,270
 He has about 5,000 dreams. 

354
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:38,290
I'm Kim Kang Min, playing the role of Ji Ho Sung. 
    

355
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:39,470
Great to meet you.

356
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:43,190
First of all, Ho Sung has a lot of dreams.

357
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:47,720
He is a teen who is also very sincere about those dreams.

358
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:51,860
 The character Ho Sung and Kim Kang Min have a lot in common. 

359
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:53,960
I wanted to utilize those points

360
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:59,440
and properly show Ho Sung's charm.

361
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:02,540
I guess you're not happy about something.

362
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:05,330
Eun Bi, your throat will hurt! 
    

363
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:09,160
Let's go. Eun Bi. Eun Bi. It's the juice that you like.

364
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,760
Which one do you want to drink?

365
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,780
- This one. 
 - That's right. Let's go, Eun Bi.

366
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:15,900
Breathe. That's right.

367
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:18,300
 The goddess of Nulji High. It's Eun Bi! 

368
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:21,110
 Hi, Eun Bi! 

369
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:26,420
Hello, I'm actor Seo Hee Sun, playing Go Eun Bi in School 2021. 
    

370
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:28,850
Eun Bi's character

371
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:32,450
is someone who works hard towards her dream of becoming an idol.

372
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:37,690
She is honest and has a bright, bubbly, and cute energy.

373
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:40,260
She can seem unlikable, but you can't hate her.

374
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:44,110
I think she's that kind of character.

375
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:46,540
 She's dancing hard. 

376
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:49,210
 Since she's an idol trainee, 

377
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:51,470
I'm working out a lot,

378
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:55,980
- hoping I might show off some dancing skills. 
 -  She's so lovely. 

379
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:59,870
You really do whatever you want.

380
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:02,070
Show some basic manners, at least.

381
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:05,450
Oh. I don't really know what basic manners are.

382
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:07,540
   

383
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:09,420
This doesn't work as it should.

384
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:11,550
Let's go together.

385
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:14,370
   

386
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:15,910
Maybe he doesn't like me.

387
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:17,380
Yes.

388
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:19,420
You are pretty annoying.

389
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:20,430
Hey, Jin Ji Won!

390
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:25,250
 I think the amazing actor's acting makes the drama more vibrant. 

391
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:26,830
The night is more comfortable. 
    

392
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:29,730
 Are you looking forward to the first episode next week? 

393
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:31,600
 Yes! 

394
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,220
It's a story about students who are gathered in one place

395
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:38,130
focusing on their dreams rather than getting into college.

396
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,120
And the story of their growth.

397
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:43,590
I think that's the strength of our drama.

398
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:46,290
First, we have our own stories to tell

399
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:48,740
but lots of events happen outside of it too.

400
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:51,490
The stories between the teachers.

401
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:54,040
I think viewers can empathize with those stories too.

402
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,450
I think that will be interesting to watch.

403
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:59,370
There are many amazing Sunbaes.

404
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:03,780
I think it'll be fun to focus on the actors as well.

405
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:07,060
It heals you, and it has lessons too.

406
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:09,660
I think we have a lot to show you.

407
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:12,940
We are shooting during the hot summer,

408
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:17,470
but when we see you, I think it'll be fall and almost winter.

409
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:19,300
Dress warmly,

410
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:22,350
and I hope you love School 2021.

411
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:25,250
School 2021, fighting! Bye.

412
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:33,020
   

413
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,800
   

414
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,410
 The top actors representing Korea. 

415
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:40,960
 And "School," the first on their filmography. 

416
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,580
   

417
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:46,020
 - He's amazing.  
 - I love you.

418
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:48,260
   

419
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:51,240
I love you, ahjussi.

420
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:54,120
I love you!

421
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,040
I love you!

422
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,230
I love you!

423
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:00,920
   

424
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,930
 They're all legendary scenes. 

425
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:06,660
And know what your dreams are.

426
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:07,650
   

427
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:10,790
 A glimpse at the young actors' rookie days in School. 

428
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:11,890
   

429
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:17,000
 Shall we take a look at who graduated from our School? 

430
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:22,100
   

431
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,930
   

432
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:27,320
 Countless students gather here at school. 

433
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:31,090
 Even among all these students, one stands out. 

434
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:36,960
 Jang Hyuk, everyone fell in love with him back in the days. 

435
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,890
- I won't act like a thug. 
 - What?

436
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:41,990
   

437
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:46,500
Why did you fight? 
    

438
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:50,360
I can only help you if you tell me why you were fighting.

439
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:53,740
The results are already decided by grade. Good guy, bad guy, isn't it?

440
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:55,870
This bastard won't listen.

441
00:23:55,870 --> 00:24:02,360
 He is the original male protagonist who is a rebellious student character in the School series. 

442
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,980
 His fierce gaze has become his key characteristic. 

443
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,600
 I should study him and practice. 

444
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:08,130
   

445
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:11,270
 The man who captures your eyes just by opening the classroom door. 

446
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:13,370
 Lee Dong Wook. 

447
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,710
 He's always so nice to me. 

448
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:20,470
 This really is a shocking past. 

449
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:23,850
   

450
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:27,070
♫  Our lives  ♫

451
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:28,890
   

452
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:33,900
 He played a character who tried to forget his confused past and find a new dream. 

453
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,430
Whether my sister is sick or not...

454
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:38,420
We saved money to go to school until the end and so 
    

455
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:41,300
she can't even sleep in a warm room.

456
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:43,840
 When I come to school after working all night, 

457
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,990
 I want to give up more than anything. 

458
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:47,520
But I have to go to school.

459
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,070
I have to finish high school.

460
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:51,980
I keep my sleepy eyes open to come to school.

461
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:56,080
   

462
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:59,850
 Do you think there are only tough guys? 
   

463
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:01,610
 There are tough girls, too. 

464
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:05,500
 People are gathered here, and it looks like something will go down. 

465
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,540
You're at the top.

466
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:12,310
   

467
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:20,540
 Kim Min Hee and Ha Ji Won, who played the role of tough unnis perfectly. 

468
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:21,850
Thank you, Hye Won.

469
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:25,850
- I like you very much. 
 - Won't you go home at all?

470
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:27,550
Why are you doing this?

471
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:28,860
Get out!

472
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:32,560
   

473
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:36,370
 I'm a troubled child and a defect. 

474
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:41,170
Most people call me a bad child. 
    

475
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:45,690
 They showed true friendship in the drama, consoling each other's pains. 

476
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:49,000
 I want to portray a "womance" like this at some point. 

477
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,390
 I promise I can do well! 

478
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:53,650
I didn't do it.

479
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:56,440
I really didn't do it!

480
00:25:57,450 --> 00:25:59,770
Why do they keep making me mad?

481
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:03,730
   

482
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:08,910
   

483
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:14,440
 And before that, there was a really tough unni who ruled the classrooms. 

484
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:18,310
   

485
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:23,880
 The world star Bae Doona's debut work was also School. 

486
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:29,200
   

487
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:33,840
What are you looking at?

488
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:40,240
 She played a troubled character who went to clubs often like it was her own house. 

489
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,940
 I'll pretend I didn't see. 

490
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:49,790
   

491
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:53,720
 To Kim So Hyun, who debuted as a child actor and has been acting for over ten years, 

492
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:56,110
 School was a turning point for her. 

493
00:26:56,110 --> 00:27:00,470
 But why is this innocent character among tough unnis? 

494
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:02,750
   

495
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:07,290
   

496
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,420
You.

497
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:15,000
- What did you do to my sister?
 -  A legendary scene. 

498
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:20,520
   

499
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:23,410
Yanking her hair in front of others.

500
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:25,660
 Throwing trash on her. 

501
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:28,340
 Accusing her of stuff she didn't do. 

502
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:32,030
   

503
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:34,930
A person died because of you.

504
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:39,150
You're shameless. You didn't even blink an eye.

505
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:40,900
 The nice girl and the tough unni. 

506
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:45,880
 She portrayed twin sisters with her amazing acting skills. 

507
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:51,390
   

508
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:52,560
   

509
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:55,860
 Their walks stand out even when they're just walking home. 

510
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:57,100
   

511
00:27:57,100 --> 00:28:00,700
 They're my role models, Kim Woo Bin and Lee Jong Suk. 

512
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:03,590
 School must be a special drama for them too. 

513
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:06,460
   

514
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:09,350
It's coming out! It's coming out!

515
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:11,210
He's coming!

516
00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:12,760
You!

517
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,600
What are you doing?

518
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,770
Come here!

519
00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:21,400
 Those in the know are aware that these two were originally models. 

520
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:26,210
   

521
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:32,010
 They perfectly played friends who have a complicated relationship. 

522
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:35,540
 They marked their place as actors transitioning from models. 

523
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,530
Park Heung Soo.

524
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:39,920
   

525
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:42,190
Heung Soo, please.

526
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:45,840
   

527
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,970
   

528
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:52,270
   

529
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:58,570
 Wow. His looks are making PE class look like a photoshoot. 

530
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:02,270
 Jo In Sung, you really are... 

531
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:11,050
 Wow. I would have acted the same way if I were there. 

532
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:15,500
   

533
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:18,280
   

534
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,820
 Do you think there are only rebels at School? 

535
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:23,180
 Of course not. 

536
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:27,870
 There are lovely characters like Gong Yoo too. 

537
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:32,460
 He always had lollipops with him so his nickname was "Candyboy." 

538
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:36,480
   

539
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:41,240
Hey, not that seat. Go to the back.

540
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:44,380
The seat next to you was mine from a thousand years ago.

541
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:49,230
- Do you have a lollipop? 
 - Yes.

542
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:52,440
You're a thief, right?

543
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,680
What?

544
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:58,880
It's weird. It feels like something was just taken from my heart.

545
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:04,370
 His sweet comments came as easily as breathing. 

546
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:09,010
 Doesn't it make you look forward to what he will say next? 

547
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:22,510
- That's amazing. 
 - What are you doing?

548
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:27,540
What shampoo do you use? It smells good.

549
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:32,770
 This kind of comment is only allowed because he's Gong Yoo. 
   

550
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:35,610
   

551
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:39,010
 He can even play the keyboard and sings well. 

552
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:42,880
 He was the lovely protagonist that School created. 

553
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,400
 And the legacy of lovely characters continues. 

554
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:48,200
 Oh, me! Could it be me? 

555
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,960
 What? 
   

556
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,820
 Sorry. 

557
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:55,500
   

558
00:30:56,610 --> 00:31:00,270
   

559
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:05,900
 Yes, it's none other than Kim Sejeong. 

560
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:10,100
♫  My heart beats  ♫

561
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:13,870
 She's struggling to prepare for her first date. 

562
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:16,700
 This is real-life acting. 

563
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,730
 I can empathize a little bit. 

564
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:29,780
   

565
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:34,450
 She succeeded in transitioning from an idol to an actress through School. 

566
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:38,070
I think I have bad eyesight.

567
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,670
   

568
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:51,910
 These sunbaes entered and graduated from School, and became top actors. 

569
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:57,140
 It's incredible that these amazing actors had rookie days like us. 

570
00:31:57,140 --> 00:32:01,390
 We will follow in our sunbaes' footsteps and graduate from School 2021 brilliantly. 

571
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:03,140
 - Fighting! 
 - Let's say fighting! 

572
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:05,680
 One, two, three, fighting! 

573
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:10,540
   

574
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,550
   

575
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:17,310
 Wow, Soo Ae is really beautiful. 

576
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:20,300
 - Chun Jung Myung. 
 - Oh, right! 

577
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:24,900
- Over there. 
 -  I love Shin Hye Sun! 

578
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:27,750
 I don't know her personally, but I'm a big fan. 

579
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:31,100
 - Lee Yi Kyung. 
 - Oh right. 

580
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:37,300
   

581
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:43,620
You're the group Cherry on Top, right? I'm such a big fan!

582
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:45,330
 Oh, it's Rowoon. 

583
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:46,910
Here.

584
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:48,130
This is unnecessary.

585
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:50,740
Give this to Hong. I'm a huge fan. 
    

586
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:55,460
This is for Rahoon. Tell him I love him. Please deliver it to him.

587
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:03,930
   

588
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:08,060
   

589
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,710
- Fighting! 
 - Let's bring up the energy!

590
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:13,810
I'm going to bring it up, all right?

591
00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:16,170
One, two, three!

592
00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:18,550
Yes, good!

593
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:21,450
 They're already showing off great chemistry. 

594
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:25,590
 They are ready to take on any concept. 

595
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:27,700
 Wait, isn't this a moment in history? 

596
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,630
 Yes. 

597
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:32,920
 Ta-da! Presenting our main poster. 

598
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:36,480
We are at the poster shoot for School 2021.

599
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,620
Let's go.

600
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:40,010
Let's go.

601
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:41,990
   

602
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:46,790
   

603
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:49,340
 I remember this. 
   

604
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:52,070
 The amazing world of computer graphics. 

605
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:57,440
 We got it. Now we are getting into the main shoot. 

606
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:01,100
 Of course, there's a secret here. 

607
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:03,020
   

608
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:06,830
 I also helped a little bit. 

609
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:12,790
We're shooting the poster for School 2021.

610
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:16,950
I think it's such a wonderful atmosphere.

611
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:21,570
   

612
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,910
   

613
00:34:24,910 --> 00:34:28,200
 What a tough time for Ki Joon. 

614
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,140
 It's probably not over yet. 

615
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:31,730
Hold on!

616
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:32,650
 That's funny. 

617
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:36,610
   

618
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:38,720
Yes, that's great!

619
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,550
Wait, this isn't fair.

620
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:43,470
 - Do you remember that? 
 - Yes. 

621
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:46,490
 There was a really funny photo. 

622
00:34:46,490 --> 00:34:48,100
 Right. 

623
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:50,400
- Don't look for it. 
 - Why is your expression...

624
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,050
You're looking for it. Don't.

625
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:54,840
   

626
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,430
   

627
00:34:56,430 --> 00:34:59,950
 We got our best shots after a tumultuous process. 

628
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:06,810
I'll work hard to shoot the rest of the photoshoot with the other actors.

629
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:10,910
Now it's Young Joo's turn.

630
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:12,460
Fighting!

631
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:14,320
Fighting.

632
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,080
 Hello! 

633
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:19,580
   

634
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:22,230
 He looked good so I wanted to take a photo. 

635
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:27,700
   

636
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:32,320
Out of everything we did today, one with chromakey on the ceiling and floor

637
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:35,250
 and we were doing slow motion. 

638
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:39,640
 Or being surprised looking into the space. 

639
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:42,830
I'm excited to see what it will look like with CG.

640
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:47,440
We're shooting the poster for School 2021.

641
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:50,200
The photographer takes really good photographs

642
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:54,030
so it's a really enjoyable atmosphere.

643
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:01,430
You're really pretty when you smile, but you keep smiling.

644
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:03,650
Let's try it with a more haughty look.

645
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:04,900
   

646
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:09,690
 The individual profile shoots showed off each person's charms and personalities. 

647
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:12,180
 It was so fun. 

648
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:16,410
And I worked hard shooting handguns.

649
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:20,510
- That's my bullet of love for you all. 
 -  So sweet. 

650
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:22,950
   

651
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:26,280
Now that we are doing the poster shoot,

652
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:30,850
it makes me realize that the airing date is soon.

653
00:36:30,850 --> 00:36:33,550
I'm so excited to see how it will turn out.

654
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:36,890
I hope you all watch our drama.

655
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:39,170
Please look forward to it. Thank you.

656
00:36:39,850 --> 00:36:41,270
   

657
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:42,790
   

658
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:45,870
 The four showed off a perfect synergy. 

659
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,980
   

660
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:51,550
 What are they like off-camera? 

661
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:53,810
   

662
00:36:53,810 --> 00:36:56,610
 Wow, these are our classmates! 

663
00:36:56,610 --> 00:36:58,640
   

664
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:05,170
This is the first shoot with all the classmates.

665
00:37:05,170 --> 00:37:07,030
It definitely feels real now.

666
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:08,940
I think we'll be a fun 11th grade, class 1.

667
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:11,970
I'm looking forward to it.

668
00:37:11,970 --> 00:37:15,610
 We haven't known each other for long, but we grew close right away. 

669
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:17,540
 Let me introduce you to everyone. 

670
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:21,030
These are my classmates. Hello!

671
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,840
 Hi, Hyo Joo and Tae Ri! 

672
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:26,410
- There's Lee Jae Hyeok here, too. 
 - Hi.

673
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:31,410
We were all born in 1999 so we became close very quickly.

674
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:33,840
- We're all close in age. 
 -  We're the same age. 

675
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:38,260
We play around a lot and talk a lot

676
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:41,490
so we're really enjoying filming.

677
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:46,300
- You look like a professor. 
 -  Let me see.

678
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:48,600
 I didn't know they filmed this. 

679
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:51,360
Look behind you.

680
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:54,660
   

681
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:56,700
 There are Jong Bok and Min Ki. 

682
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:59,120
   

683
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:01,360
 Everyone gets along in our class, 

684
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:04,290
 but I hear there are some with exceptional chemistry. 

685
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:05,390
   

686
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:10,070
 First up is Ki Joon and Ji Won. Here's their adorable chemistry. 

687
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:11,650
   

688
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:15,470
   

689
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:22,300
   

690
00:38:24,950 --> 00:38:26,730
 I really can't hold in my laughter with Ki Joon. 

691
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:28,260
 It's just so funny. 

692
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:31,330
 - Seriously. 
 - Ki Joon laughs easily. 

693
00:38:31,330 --> 00:38:34,850
 - Just seeing your face makes me laugh. 
 - Me, too! 

694
00:38:34,850 --> 00:38:39,300
Don't laugh. Seriously. 
    

695
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:41,170
Promise me.

696
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:47,320
We waited so long for this first shoot.

697
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:51,240
I'm so glad we finally got to do it.

698
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:54,180
   

699
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:56,210
 - Why are we doing that? 
 - What's this? 

700
00:38:56,210 --> 00:38:57,480
 I don't know. 

701
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,230
161 cm.

702
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:00,350
160 cm.

703
00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:01,490
One.

704
00:39:01,490 --> 00:39:02,780
160.

705
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:04,690
 So is it 160 or 161? 

706
00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:07,370
 - Of course, 161. 
 - Really? 

707
00:39:07,370 --> 00:39:09,600
   

708
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,070
Is there a bug on me?

709
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:13,080
   

710
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:16,730
 - Is it dance time? 
 - No, there was a really huge bug. 

711
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:18,350
Look back.

712
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:20,630
   

713
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:24,130
   

714
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:25,940
 We had a laughing fit again that time. 

715
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:28,870
And you're trying to go in a different direction.

716
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:30,570
 Where is this? 

717
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:32,050
And you go like this.

718
00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:34,540
 - Jeongeup. 
 - Oh. 

719
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:36,460
   

720
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:37,990
 They banter whenever they see each other. 

721
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:41,740
 Let's see who the next chemistry is after this adorable duo. 

722
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:45,340
No, again! 
    

723
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:46,940
 The second chemistry 

724
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:52,280
 is Seo Young and Young Joo's heartwarming chemistry. 

725
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:54,420
 They look awkward on their first shoot. 

726
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:59,120
 Can the two become close? 

727
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:03,090
 Seo Young and Young Joo's second meeting. 

728
00:40:03,090 --> 00:40:07,260
   

729
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:11,480
   

730
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,070
   

731
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,130
   

732
00:40:16,130 --> 00:40:18,120
 It's quite sweet. 

733
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:20,840
 She made me do it. 

734
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:25,180
I can't do that.

735
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:28,720
 Young Joo has a lot of aegyo. 

736
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,620
Everyone was so energetic.

737
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:35,190
I think my colleagues worked hard to make the atmosphere feel lively.

738
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:35,980
It's good.

739
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:39,010
I had fun...

740
00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:41,560
with Byeol today.

741
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:44,520
Why would you leave your snot here?

742
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:47,120
   

743
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:50,000
 Byeol had snot all over the desk 

744
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,570
 so we're wiping it. 

745
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:54,380
- Why do you keep complaining? 
 - When did I complain about you?

746
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:56,970
 You keep complaining. 

747
00:40:56,970 --> 00:40:59,920
He doesn't listen.

748
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,310
He doesn't listen at all.

749
00:41:01,310 --> 00:41:04,540
It's so hard. It's hard to raise him.

750
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:06,620
- I'm here for an interview. 
 - Oh, you're back.

751
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:09,280
- What did you have for lunch? 
 - Yogurt.

752
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,790
- Then... 
 - I'm here to interview you.

753
00:41:11,790 --> 00:41:13,510
   

754
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:16,340
 You don't want to. 

755
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:17,730
 The camera was rolling. 

756
00:41:17,730 --> 00:41:20,470
   

757
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:22,360
- It's cold. 
 - Are you cold?

758
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,250
Deal with it.

759
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:24,830
 Now we are closer than before. 

760
00:41:24,830 --> 00:41:28,500
 But the one duo we can't keep up with is... 

761
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:30,680
 The third chemistry you've been waiting for. 

762
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:33,090
 Ho Sung and Ki Joon's true friendship. 

763
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:37,980
This scene was just between Ho Sung and me.

764
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:39,990
It's quite...

765
00:41:39,990 --> 00:41:42,750
you'll know when you see it.

766
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:43,890
   

767
00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:45,720
 You guys have really good chemistry. 

768
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:49,050
   

769
00:41:49,050 --> 00:41:50,400
Why would you tickle me?

770
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,890
   

771
00:41:53,890 --> 00:41:56,140
   

772
00:41:57,370 --> 00:42:00,160
You must have peeked at the answer sheet a lot back in the day. It's too natural.

773
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:03,870
   

774
00:42:03,870 --> 00:42:06,370
 I'm getting jealous. 

775
00:42:06,370 --> 00:42:10,130
 Ki Joon and Ho Sung are always together like thread and needle. 

776
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:12,430
 The same posture and same ice cream. 

777
00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:16,490
 True friendship for sure. 

778
00:42:16,490 --> 00:42:18,980
 What are they saying? Is it a secret? 

779
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:19,960
 We don't know. 

780
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:23,910
 If you're curious what Ho Sung's secret is... 

781
00:42:23,910 --> 00:42:27,930
 Watch the drama when it airs on November 24th! 

782
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:36,150
   

783
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:39,880
   

784
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:43,430
   

785
00:42:43,430 --> 00:42:45,390
 The school that we plan out in a drawing. 

786
00:42:45,390 --> 00:42:50,650
   

787
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,610
 The school that we build. 

788
00:42:54,610 --> 00:42:57,050
   

789
00:42:57,050 --> 00:43:00,880
   

790
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:04,670
   

791
00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:06,570
   

792
00:43:06,570 --> 00:43:11,010
   

793
00:43:11,010 --> 00:43:12,720
   

794
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:17,770
 Befitting the title of the drama, the school was a space for the radiant students. 

795
00:43:17,770 --> 00:43:21,350
 The school that we will be attending this time is quite special. 

796
00:43:21,350 --> 00:43:23,840
 For the first time in the School series, 

797
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:26,080
 we will be attending a specialized high school. 

798
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:31,880
   

799
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:35,040
"I'm becoming a professional in my field."

800
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:38,400
That thought made me feel really proud.

801
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:42,780
At the center was the Nulji High School architectural design department and the apprenticeship class.

802
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:47,400
I'm utilizing a lot that I learned at school in the field now.

803
00:43:48,370 --> 00:43:49,770
Yes?

804
00:43:50,530 --> 00:43:53,120
What is an apprenticeship class?

805
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:54,930
 Ki Joon's at it again. 

806
00:43:54,930 --> 00:43:58,640
 Apprenticeship class is a special class for passionate students 

807
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:01,440
 who want to study and work at the same time. 

808
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,870
 Passion, passion, passion! 

809
00:44:03,870 --> 00:44:08,430
So did you become employed full-time right after you took the apprenticeship class and graduated?

810
00:44:08,430 --> 00:44:09,460
Yes.

811
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:13,620
For me, I signed a contract with the company in 11th grade

812
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:17,820
and got hired full-time before graduating, and I'm still working there.

813
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:20,700
Wouldn't it still be better to work after going to college?

814
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:23,280
Rather than going to college without any thought,

815
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:26,060
wouldn't it be more efficient to work at a company

816
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:28,790
and go when you think you need to?

817
00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:30,650
- If anyone's interested— 
 - Me.

818
00:44:30,650 --> 00:44:32,320
I get to go on-site, right?

819
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:34,180
I want to do it.

820
00:44:36,270 --> 00:44:38,570
I have dreamed of becoming a carpenter since elementary school.

821
00:44:38,570 --> 00:44:42,290
It has never changed.

822
00:44:42,290 --> 00:44:45,080
 She's working hard for her dreams, 

823
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:48,110
 but the reality is not so easy. 

824
00:44:48,110 --> 00:44:51,930
Do you know Nulji High School over there?

825
00:44:51,930 --> 00:44:58,200
That's where they gathered students who gave up on studying because this doesn't work well.

826
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:01,010
Did I force you to go to that school?

827
00:45:01,010 --> 00:45:05,560
Why is it that you've been so fussy, ever since you were a child?

828
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:08,540
Can't you just be ordinary?

829
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:10,750
Ordinary how?

830
00:45:11,390 --> 00:45:12,460
I see.

831
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:14,200
Study ordinarily like everyone else,

832
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:16,860
be dumb enough to be average, and not know what I love to do?

833
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:19,800
Go to college because everyone else does and barely graduate only to be jobless

834
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:22,590
and burden you and Dad? That kind of ordinary?

835
00:45:22,590 --> 00:45:26,220
 Where am I supposed to go now? 

836
00:45:26,830 --> 00:45:29,830
 Our story of facing prejudice from the world 

837
00:45:29,830 --> 00:45:32,780
 just because we chose a path that is not college. 

838
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:35,940
   

839
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:39,330
 Witness our stories through School 2021 

840
00:45:39,330 --> 00:45:41,700
 and root for us. 

841
00:45:42,550 --> 00:45:44,380
Let's go.

842
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:49,360
   

843
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:53,850
 Another reason to watch School 2021. 
   

844
00:45:53,850 --> 00:45:54,960
   

845
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:58,450
 We are the reason. 

846
00:45:59,950 --> 00:46:00,770
I miss you.

847
00:46:00,770 --> 00:46:03,880
 Did you know Ki Joon was originally an idol? 

848
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:10,270
   

849
00:46:10,270 --> 00:46:11,690
 Is that Gong Ki Joon? 

850
00:46:11,690 --> 00:46:15,040
 The disparity between the stage and the drama is unreal. 

851
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:16,870
 Wow... 

852
00:46:16,870 --> 00:46:18,700
 - Looks good.  
 - You're handsome.

853
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:19,960
Why would you look at his appearance?

854
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:22,220
You should judge him by his personality or sense of responsibility.

855
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:24,770
So you agree about his looks?

856
00:46:25,470 --> 00:46:29,080
 Okay, I acknowledge his looks. 

857
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:33,460
I'm so tired.

858
00:46:34,830 --> 00:46:36,110
   

859
00:46:36,110 --> 00:46:39,470
 Well, well. Who is this? 

860
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:44,430
 Ji Won's signature look is that smile. 

861
00:46:44,430 --> 00:46:45,920
 Thank you. 

862
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:48,710
 Wow, seeing it like this, you really are short. 

863
00:46:48,710 --> 00:46:50,760
 Hey! 

864
00:46:54,340 --> 00:46:59,180
   

865
00:47:00,690 --> 00:47:04,580
 Wow, he has the body to turn the streets into his runway. 

866
00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:07,130
 - Young Joo! 
 - Oh, stop it. 

867
00:47:07,130 --> 00:47:08,970
 Thank you. 

868
00:47:08,970 --> 00:47:10,530
You don't speak formally anymore.

869
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:13,880
 Chic Young Joo's surprising charm. 

870
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:18,450
So did you study?

871
00:47:18,450 --> 00:47:20,550
I didn't study at all.

872
00:47:20,550 --> 00:47:23,500
Continuing to pursue me repeatedly because I don't fall for you,

873
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:24,600
that's called stalking.

874
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:26,640
You should date me.

875
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:30,550
 Everyone acknowledges that Seo Young is the goddess of Nulji High. 

876
00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:34,400
 Your eyes will be happy watching School 2021. 

877
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,580
 Remember that! 

878
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:42,650
   

879
00:47:42,650 --> 00:47:47,460
   

880
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:49,530
Gong Ki Joon.

881
00:47:55,140 --> 00:47:57,790
 Another reason to look forward to School 2021 

882
00:47:57,790 --> 00:48:01,100
 is, of course, more than anything, 

883
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:04,540
 the exciting story of young and innocent first love. 

884
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:09,810
 The School series is equivalent to teen romance. 

885
00:48:09,810 --> 00:48:13,190
 Can we continue this legacy? 

886
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:23,910
 But before that, 
   

887
00:48:23,910 --> 00:48:28,330
 shall we take a peek at our sunbaes' romance scenes, 

888
00:48:28,330 --> 00:48:30,790
 still acclaimed as a legend today? 

889
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:38,480
Okay. Thank you.

890
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:45,600
Thanks for offering, but it's uncomfortable for me.

891
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:47,830
And I feel bad about it too.

892
00:48:48,490 --> 00:48:50,700
I like you, Ms. Cha.

893
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:52,850
 He said he likes her. 

894
00:48:54,150 --> 00:48:56,040
I've liked you for a while.

895
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:58,320
   

896
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:02,390
- So don't feel bad. 
 -  Don't feel bad. 

897
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:05,550
 Young Joo, fail! 

898
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:08,720
Hey! 
    

899
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,760
Wouldn't it be okay...

900
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:14,040
for there to be one person at least?

901
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:16,730
Someone who can call you by your real name.

902
00:49:20,090 --> 00:49:21,730
Can I...

903
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:28,830
be that person?

904
00:49:28,830 --> 00:49:31,410
 - Wow, my heart's fluttering. 
 - Right? My heart's pounding. 

905
00:49:31,410 --> 00:49:37,880
♫  A sleepless night, a lonely night  ♫

906
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:39,780
 Oh, my God. 

907
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:41,740
Why aren't you answering me?

908
00:49:41,740 --> 00:49:46,230
   

909
00:49:46,230 --> 00:49:50,160
 There were legendary romance scenes like these. 

910
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:58,480
 Then shall we take a look at what kind of romance 

911
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:00,500
 will appear in School 2021? 

912
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:04,370
This isn't romance. It's a big piece of shit.

913
00:50:04,370 --> 00:50:09,590
   

914
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:13,500
Hey, Gong Ki Joon.

915
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:14,910
- Where are you going? 
 - Home.

916
00:50:14,910 --> 00:50:16,310
It looks like you're skipping school.

917
00:50:16,310 --> 00:50:18,340
- You told me to stop. 
 - You're doing this on purpose, right?

918
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:20,710
What are you talking about?

919
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:25,370
Ki Joon and Ji Won, are they enemies or lovers?

920
00:50:25,370 --> 00:50:26,750
It's hard to tell.

921
00:50:26,750 --> 00:50:31,700
He and I are archnemeses.

922
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:36,630
 Ki Joon and I, Ji Won, banter every time we see each other. 

923
00:50:36,630 --> 00:50:38,240
 Will they be okay? 

924
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:40,070
What are you talking about?

925
00:50:40,070 --> 00:50:41,200
You kissed me.

926
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:44,320
When? Am I crazy? That was definitely a mistake. I ran into you.

927
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:47,170
You little shortie.

928
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:51,480
   

929
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:55,180
 Thinking about that day again... It was so cheesy. 

930
00:50:55,180 --> 00:50:58,370
 Will those two's romance be okay like this? 

931
00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:06,830
 I was shy during the reading... 

932
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:16,180
 but we can't help but care about each other. 

933
00:51:16,180 --> 00:51:18,420
 Both me and Ki Joon. 

934
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:23,000
If you're going to stare, shouldn't you at least not make it obvious?

935
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,440
What?

936
00:51:33,510 --> 00:51:35,590
There'll be another chance.

937
00:51:35,590 --> 00:51:38,090
You do well.

938
00:51:38,090 --> 00:51:39,820
What's this?

939
00:51:39,820 --> 00:51:42,110
Acting cheesy all of a sudden.

940
00:51:43,530 --> 00:51:45,190
What?

941
00:51:58,450 --> 00:51:59,690
 Excuse me. 

942
00:51:59,690 --> 00:52:03,820
 Discussing romance without me isn't polite. 

943
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:11,190
   

944
00:52:11,190 --> 00:52:13,060
Hi.

945
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:16,100
You work a lot. I'm Jin Ji Won.

946
00:52:16,850 --> 00:52:17,900
I know.

947
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:19,850
We are regulars here. I guess we will see each other often.

948
00:52:19,850 --> 00:52:21,760
Hey, what are you doing?

949
00:52:25,190 --> 00:52:27,130
 Young Joo isn't interested in his surroundings much. 

950
00:52:27,130 --> 00:52:31,210
 But somehow, he can't stop being aware of Ji Won. 

951
00:52:31,210 --> 00:52:34,530
   

952
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:40,740
 Why do you think that is, Ji Won? 

953
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:42,640
Jung Young Joo.

954
00:52:44,290 --> 00:52:46,010
We're close now, right?

955
00:52:46,010 --> 00:52:50,550
♫  I want to read your heart  ♫

956
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:59,100
♫  I get nervous sometimes because I like you  ♫

957
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:02,130
 Ji Won and I are close, right? 

958
00:53:02,130 --> 00:53:03,830
 I hope so. 

959
00:53:03,830 --> 00:53:09,820
   

960
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:14,650
 Meanwhile, there is another love line that you can't leave out in teen romance. 

961
00:53:14,650 --> 00:53:19,840
Lee Jong Suk and Kim Woo Bin's bromance in School 2013.

962
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:23,430
I was really moved by Kim Woo Bin and Lee Jong Suk.

963
00:53:23,430 --> 00:53:31,330
Kim Woo Bin and Lee Jong Suk's bromance was really memorable.

964
00:53:31,330 --> 00:53:34,880
 The best chemistry in all of School's history, voted by us at Nulji High. 

965
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:40,010
 The prime example of bromance is Lee Jong Suk and Kim Woo Bin. 

966
00:53:40,010 --> 00:53:44,150
I ruined your leg and your future!

967
00:53:45,250 --> 00:53:47,190
When I wanted to die...

968
00:53:47,190 --> 00:53:50,840
You should have been with me, you jerk! 
  I really love this scene. 

969
00:53:52,570 --> 00:53:55,780
Didn't you miss me, man?

970
00:53:57,250 --> 00:53:59,380
 I did. 

971
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:05,610
 They even enjoyed little street food dates like this. 

972
00:54:05,610 --> 00:54:07,070
Hey.

973
00:54:07,070 --> 00:54:10,800
- We need to take a photo. 
 - Oh, right.

974
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:12,520
All right.

975
00:54:13,780 --> 00:54:14,900
Pick up the ramen.

976
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:17,100
   

977
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:18,570
 Knock, knock, knock. 

978
00:54:18,570 --> 00:54:22,040
 Is there anyone who will make a new record for the best duo? 

979
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:29,080
   

980
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:32,370
- Young Joo. 
 - Don't talk to me, you bastard.

981
00:54:33,450 --> 00:54:35,860
I don't want to die.

982
00:54:40,690 --> 00:54:42,790
What?

983
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:46,450
 Their acting is so aggressive. 

984
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:49,710
 Is a bromance possible? 

985
00:54:49,710 --> 00:54:51,300
What's going on with them?

986
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:53,050
Stop, stop it!

987
00:54:53,050 --> 00:54:54,400
Let go!

988
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:56,010
Get out!

989
00:54:56,010 --> 00:54:57,680
Can you look at each other?

990
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:59,010
 Of course, it is. 

991
00:54:59,010 --> 00:55:01,170
 We're different off-camera. 

992
00:55:01,170 --> 00:55:04,960
   

993
00:55:06,590 --> 00:55:10,300
Young Woo, aren't you looking at me too much?

994
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:11,530
So cute.

995
00:55:11,530 --> 00:55:14,270
So cute, so cute.

996
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:23,850
 I don't think Ji Won is the only one that Young Joo gazes at. 

997
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:31,140
 Ki Joon and I. 

998
00:55:31,140 --> 00:55:34,830
 Will we be able to create a bromance that will surpass the previous works? 

999
00:55:34,830 --> 00:55:38,960
 Find out in School 2021. 

1000
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:41,100
 I'm so curious. 

1001
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:43,540
 I'm going to watch it right when it airs. 

1002
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:50,680
   

1003
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:57,350
School 2021 is where teens

1004
00:55:57,350 --> 00:56:00,860
who are at a specialized high school head toward their dreams.

1005
00:56:00,860 --> 00:56:05,690
The episodes related to school are very fun.

1006
00:56:05,690 --> 00:56:09,110
I hope many of you will watch it.

1007
00:56:09,110 --> 00:56:12,330
Please look forward to School 2021.

1008
00:56:12,330 --> 00:56:15,280
I hope you take an interest in Young Joo.

1009
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:18,300
I'll do my best so I hope you will enjoy it.

1010
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:19,420
Thank you.

1011
00:56:19,420 --> 00:56:24,000
School 2021 is so fun.

1012
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,660
It heals you, and it has lessons too.

1013
00:56:26,660 --> 00:56:29,540
There is a lot we have in store for you

1014
00:56:29,540 --> 00:56:32,500
so I hope many of you will watch it.

1015
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:37,020
I'll do my best and work hard to make a good drama for you all.

1016
00:56:37,020 --> 00:56:40,270
So please watch it. Thank you.

1017
00:56:40,270 --> 00:56:42,680
School 2021, 
   
School 2021. 

1018
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:46,730
has so many charming actors, a great director, and our amazing staff.

1019
00:56:46,730 --> 00:56:48,900
We're all working hard on it.

1020
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:49,830
So please look forward to it.

1021
00:56:49,830 --> 00:56:51,840
Make sure you watch the first episode when it airs.

1022
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:53,520
Thank you.

1023
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:58,490
Having a dream at a young age is...

1024
00:56:58,490 --> 00:57:00,250
Wait, I'll do it again.

1025
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:01,850
   

1026
00:57:01,850 --> 00:57:05,650
Of course, I will work hard.

1027
00:57:05,650 --> 00:57:11,730
And I hope we can finish filming safely and healthily.

1028
00:57:11,730 --> 00:57:13,110
I'll do my best.

1029
00:57:13,110 --> 00:57:15,900
School 2021, fighting!

1030
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:19,010
School 2021, fighting! Go Eun Bi, fighting!

1031
00:57:19,010 --> 00:57:22,040
Seo Hee Sun, fighting!

1032
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:25,110
School 2021, fighting!

1033
00:57:25,110 --> 00:57:27,210
Bye!

1034
00:57:27,210 --> 00:57:28,620
Hak*. 
  (TN: First syllable of "school" in Korean) 

1035
00:57:28,620 --> 00:57:34,650
Hope many of you will watch School 2021.

1036
00:57:34,650 --> 00:57:37,700
- Gyo*. 
 - Great. Great. 
  (TN: Second syllable of "school" in Korean) 

1037
00:57:41,450 --> 00:57:43,500
 I quit taekwondo. 

1038
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:46,400
 What do I do now? 

1039
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:48,800
 I have dreamed of becoming a carpenter since elementary school. 

1040
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:50,920
 It has never changed at all. 

1041
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:52,440
 Ki Joon and Ji Won. 

1042
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:53,890
You're doing this on purpose, right?

1043
00:57:53,890 --> 00:57:55,000
Are they enemies or lovers?

1044
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,570
 Sorry you keep getting involved with me. 

1045
00:57:57,570 --> 00:57:59,430
 But I don't have the leisure to avoid you these days. 

1046
00:57:59,430 --> 00:58:03,200
Don't talk to me, you bastard. I don't want to die.

1047
00:58:03,220 --> 00:58:05,140
I guess you're not happy about something.

1048
00:58:05,140 --> 00:58:06,390
Hey!

1049
00:58:06,390 --> 00:58:08,620
 Our class atmosphere is so intense. 

1050
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:10,430
What, you have a problem?

1051
00:58:10,430 --> 00:58:12,990
 He doesn't seem like a bad guy. 

1052
00:58:12,990 --> 00:58:15,460
 What on earth happened to you in the past? 

1053
00:58:15,460 --> 00:58:17,060
You should date me.

1054
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:19,170
 He used to be a little brat. 

1055
00:58:19,170 --> 00:58:21,370
♫  If I meet you  ♫

1056
00:58:21,370 --> 00:58:25,310
♫  Dream on, dream on  ♫

1057
00:58:25,310 --> 00:58:27,040
♫  Dream on  ♫

1058
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:29,600
♫  I'm dreaming in this moment  ♫

1059
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:34,720
♫  Dream on, dream on, dream on  ♫

1060
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:40,950
♫  I'll get closer to you  ♫
