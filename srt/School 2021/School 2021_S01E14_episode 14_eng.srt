1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,600
   

2
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:09,110
   

3
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:12,000
   

4
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:14,960
   

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,160
   

6
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:21,210
   

7
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:33,730
   

8
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:41,980
 Timing and Subtitles by the 🎶 Sing for a dream 🎤 Team @ viki 

9
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:46,360
Well...

10
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:49,570
- Director Gu? 
 - Mr. Lee Kang Hoon,

11
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:52,050
I'm glad I ran into you.

12
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:55,870
- Sorry? 
 - You...

13
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:59,450
You're fired.

14
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,180
Clear out your desk today.

15
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:15,500
What do you mean by doing this so suddenly?

16
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:18,520
I thought you were prepared for it.

17
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,290
When you ask me so innocently, I don't know what to say.

18
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,860
What did he do wrong?

19
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,180
How dare you interrupt adults talking.

20
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:34,000
Jung Young Joo, you're next.

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,400
Just wait.

22
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,890
- What? 
 - Jung Young Joo.

23
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,470
Enough.

24
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,080
We should talk inside.

25
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:13,300
There aren't many teaching days left this year anyway.

26
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:17,270
The other teachers will divide up the rest of your classes.

27
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:20,550
We'll take care of the administration.

28
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:23,270
So don't get on Director Gu's nerves anymore,

29
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:24,920
and gather your things.

30
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,280
But—

31
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,670
But how can you ask me to suddenly leave?

32
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:30,180
It's too unreasonable.

33
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,270
The board agreed to it.

34
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:33,780
On what grounds?

35
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:37,750
It says on the notice, "Neglect of Duties."

36
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:41,350
So why did you have to leave work without a valid reason?

37
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,590
You have your head in the sand.

38
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:49,320
Leave quietly so that the students

39
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,300
aren't angered.

40
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,790
Gosh, you scared me! 
    

41
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:09,330
It's time for me to step up again.

42
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:11,990
Yes. Of course.

43
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:15,200
Hey. Are you guys going to let Mr. Lee leave like this?

44
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,730
What will you do?

45
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:18,680
Protest like last time?

46
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,460
Will anything change?

47
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:23,660
Director Gu will never go back on her words.

48
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,080
We have to do something.

49
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,260
We have to make an effort, at least.

50
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:31,930
Anyone who wants to stand with me, meet me after school.

51
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:34,470
Okay, but where should we meet?

52
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:36,250
Should we gather at school?

53
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,910
You're right.

54
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:41,620
It'll take time to make signs,

55
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:44,250
and it doesn't feel right to prepare those at school.

56
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:46,420
Where do we meet?

57
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:48,100
Let's use my place.

58
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:51,240
Can we?

59
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:54,150
I want to do something too.

60
00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:01,110
I have to go to work, so you guys should start without me.

61
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:03,070
You know where my house key is, right?

62
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:05,980
Oh, my God. Do you even know that?

63
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:10,200
W-We live together anyway.

64
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:14,730
You what?

65
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:16,870
- Wh-Why? 
 - Did I hear that wrongly?

66
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:20,390
- They live together? 
 - J-Jin Ji Won?

67
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:31,580
It's all my fault.

68
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,170
I'm sure we can change it.

69
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:37,820
This is definitely using an unfair dismissal for retaliation.

70
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:42,490
Let's find a way.

71
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:53,220
The school did all we could.

72
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:56,460
I didn't know there would be evidence coming out of nowhere.

73
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:59,850
So? How much is the settlement amount?

74
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:03,450
You don't need to worry about your position over that amount, honey.

75
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:06,240
Fine, let's talk at home.

76
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,680
Gosh.

77
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:11,720
Is it Uncle?

78
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:14,520
Yes.

79
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:19,130
Jae Hee, Jae Hyeok, what is it?

80
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:27,000
Aunt,

81
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:30,780
please cancel Mr. Lee's dismissal.

82
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:35,510
He did nothing wrong.

83
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:37,460
- Why would you fire him? 
 - Hey.

84
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:40,130
That guy caused our company a lot of damage.

85
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:43,830
Aunt, just expel Jung Young Joo too.

86
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:45,750
Go ahead and try.

87
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:49,620
There was a valid reason for doing that.

88
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:53,400
It's not something for you to get involved with, Jae Hee.

89
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:58,270
I finally became close with Mr. Lee and my friends.

90
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,650
You ruined everything, Aunt!

91
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:06,090
Lee Jae Hee, I've always told you that

92
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:07,960
I don't have any sons or daughters,

93
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:11,080
and both of you are like my children.

94
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:15,000
If you just stay put, I'll help you walk down an easy path.

95
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,130
- So— 
 - I don't need anything.

96
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:21,200
I'm not your child!

97
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,150
What's up with her?

98
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:34,670
Jae Hee, we'll wait for you outside.

99
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:35,760
- Bye. 
 - See you.

100
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,060
Hey, Min Ki, Min Ki!

101
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:40,550
Class is over. You need to go home.

102
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:42,020
What?

103
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:45,490
Where are you going?

104
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:47,110
Wait for me.

105
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:49,440
Hey!

106
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:54,170
Why do you keep running away and avoiding me?

107
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:55,350
You ignore all my texts.

108
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:57,460
I... Eun Bi...

109
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:58,600
I have to rush home.

110
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,390
I asked if you wanted to have dinner together.

111
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:03,060
Bring Hyun Woo too.

112
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:06,840
If we're taking Hyun Woo, we should go somewhere with stroller access, right?

113
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,930
I don't have time.

114
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:10,080
Really?

115
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,050
- Tomorrow? 
 - No. Not tomorrow, not ever.

116
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:16,110
I have to look after Hyun Woo, and I'll start a part-time job soon.

117
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:19,880
My parents said they can't support a baby financially, so I'm on my own.

118
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,260
Sorry, Eun Bi. I have to go.

119
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:28,890
Are you doing this because of those posted comments?

120
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:35,170
It's not even true so why do you care?

121
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:38,410
That's not it.

122
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:40,000
I have a lot on, Eun Bi.

123
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,730
I'm not the person I used to be.

124
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,340
I hope you understand.

125
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,700
He's so cute.

126
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,620
The school and us...

127
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,160
I thought...

128
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:10,350
I thought I was more helpful to Eun Bi than anyone else.

129
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:14,400
I ruined her future.

130
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,080
Come on.

131
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,040
The people are mistaken.

132
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,070
Even if they are,

133
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:23,830
once her image is ruined, it's over for her.

134
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:25,980
Because of me, false rumors are

135
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:28,620
happening before she even has a proper start.

136
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,420
It's okay. It will be fine.

137
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:34,300
Don't cry. You're a man.

138
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,820
Why are you crying so much?

139
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,520
But...

140
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:44,890
when did you and Ji Won start living in the same house?

141
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:48,240
Why didn't you tell me? Geez...

142
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:54,140
I was going to. I was just all over the place.

143
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:57,660
That's true.

144
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:03,500
So I ruined Eun Bi's future.

145
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,820
All this talk about ruined futures.

146
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:13,430
- Hey. 
 - Hey.

147
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:18,240
What's up with this atmosphere?

148
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,860
Just get used to it.

149
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:23,970
Aigoo. Ho Sung has been repeating the same thing for three hours.

150
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:26,370
We gave up trying to console him.

151
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:29,850
Ki Joon just returned from work, so he's getting the update.

152
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:32,160
Starting tomorrow, we're protesting with signs.

153
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,450
- Are you with us? 
 - Yes.

154
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:36,840
I'll do whatever I can.

155
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,460
So why is he crying?

156
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,650
Young Joo, the thing is...

157
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:46,660
Young Joo...

158
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:48,410
Listen to me.

159
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:55,150
I thought I was more helpful to Eun Bi than anyone else.

160
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:59,100
- Yes... 
 - I'm ruining Eun Bi's future...

161
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,510
   

162
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,990
It's been a while since you last visited.

163
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:08,820
I'll contact you the moment there are any updates.

164
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,000
You look really comfortable, Dad.

165
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:34,670
I feel like my headache is killing me.

166
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:40,760
How long is this going to go on?

167
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:54,770
So wake up,

168
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:58,190
and stop leaving me in uncertainty,

169
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:04,050
or just hurry up and go.

170
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:12,080
   

171
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:18,100
What is it?

172
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,190
Will this be enough?

173
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:30,520
We can only do as much as we can.

174
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,980
It's all my fault.

175
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:35,440
I shouldn't have

176
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,620
asked him to testify.

177
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:48,700
Why are there so many unjust things, and I have no power?

178
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,130
There will be a way.

179
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,980
Ji Won is an expert in this field,

180
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:59,810
so let's trust her and go with it.

181
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:22,490
   

182
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,540
Did you wait long?

183
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:58,340
My sister caught me leaving, so I had to make an excuse.

184
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:00,900
Not at all. I just got here.

185
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,100
Let's go.

186
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,590
Let's hurry.

187
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:36,840
Are you going to keep staring at me with that gentle and kind look?

188
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:40,240
It's because you're so precious.

189
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:47,380
How are you feeling these days?

190
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,880
I'm busy

191
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:54,350
because of you, Jung Young Joo, and everyone else.

192
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:57,920
I have no time to think about anything.

193
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:04,740
Thank you...

194
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:09,280
to you and Young Joo both.

195
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:16,650
I'm sure you miss Grandpa a lot.

196
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:21,330
I do.

197
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:24,560
I can't believe it.

198
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:30,280
I still feel like he's going to greet me when I come home.

199
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,110
In the morning,

200
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:38,320
I feel like he'll nag me to eat before going to school.

201
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:43,700
Maybe I shouldn't have brought it up.

202
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,570
No.

203
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:48,650
I'm going to talk about him every day

204
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:50,660
and miss him a lot.

205
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,980
And then...

206
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,420
if I want to cry, I will.

207
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:58,260
That's how it's going to be.

208
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:01,550
You told me to do that.

209
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:07,290
Sorry.

210
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,800
I should be comforting you.

211
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:21,250
No.

212
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:25,130
Without you, I wouldn't have been able to handle it.

213
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:28,480
Thank you.

214
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:42,580
No more crying.

215
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,120
Finish your food.

216
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:51,360
Don't get home and say you should have finished the food or whatever.

217
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,090
Eat up.

218
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:56,320
Okay.

219
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,570
Go on.

220
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,120
Is it good?

221
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,800
Are you happy?

222
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:44,490
Weren't you sleeping?

223
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:23,420
Dad, aren't you going to school?

224
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:27,720
No.

225
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,230
I'm not going to go for a while.

226
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:31,100
Why not?

227
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,770
Well...

228
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:37,210
It's just tiring, so I'm going to rest for a bit.

229
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:45,420
- Lucky you. 
 - What?

230
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:48,820
I go to preschool even if I don't want to.

231
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,790
Oh, I see.

232
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:54,220
Is going to preschool tiring for you?

233
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:56,440
What else can I do?

234
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,370
I have to do what I have to do.

235
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:06,680
 Everyone! 

236
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:11,580
Mr. Lee Kang Hoon of the Architectural Department has been dismissed unfairly.

237
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:15,780
He was fired for testifying against the foundation

238
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:20,500
regarding an on-site apprentice from our school who was injured five years ago.

239
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:24,070
We must protect our teacher.

240
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,180
Unfair dismissal.

241
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:27,930
Withdraw, withdraw, withdraw.

242
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:31,230
We want to keep learning from Mr. Lee Kang Hoon.

243
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:32,200
Unfair dismissal.

244
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,860
Withdraw, withdraw, withdraw.

245
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,380
Everyone.

246
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:40,630
Mr. Lee Kang Hoon of the Architectural Department has been dismissed unfairly.

247
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:41,940
Mr. Shin.

248
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:43,550
- Good morning. 
 - Hi.

249
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:46,250
Will you read through this? It's about Mr. Lee.

250
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:49,820
- For an on-site apprentice... 
 - Oh, I see.

251
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:51,990
You guys are going through a lot.

252
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:56,130
Do you think any of the teachers would stand with us?

253
00:18:56,130 --> 00:19:00,110
I'm sure all teachers know Mr. Lee's dismissal was unjust.

254
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:01,420
I don't know about that.

255
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:05,100
The lives of adults aren't that simple.

256
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,040
Sorry?

257
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,860
Anyway, keep it up.

258
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:13,710
Everyone, Mr. Lee Kang Hoon of the Architectural Department has been dismissed unfairly.

259
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:15,150
Ms. Song.

260
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:17,840
 Ms. Song. 

261
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,700
You guys...

262
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,390
Don't do this, guys.

263
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:24,300
I know how you feel, but this is a problem for the teachers.

264
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:27,500
- This is adults' business— 
 - It's about our teacher.

265
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:30,610
So it's our problem too.

266
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:32,020
Don't worry about us.

267
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:34,680
We'll make sure it doesn't affect our classes.

268
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:50,170
 Get those kids out of there! 

269
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:34,130
What business does Mr. Shin Cheol Min have with you, Director?

270
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:36,590
What is it?

271
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:38,860
Oh, yes.

272
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:44,320
About the new Animal Care and Drone departments,

273
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:48,030
that's the list of teachers who signed up for training over the holiday break.

274
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:52,840
Only half of the current teachers signed up.

275
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:57,360
It must be because they have no common grounds with these departments.

276
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,520
I suppose it would be better to hire new teachers, yes?

277
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,340
Aren't you doing it?

278
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:04,010
Pardon?

279
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:07,270
You're in the Architectural Department too.

280
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:11,510
It's too soon for you to retire. Are you planning to relocate to another school?

281
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:15,090
Pardon? I don't follow what you mean...

282
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:18,900
I'm Sang Rim's... I mean...

283
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:22,890
Wasn't this already worked out with Director Oh?

284
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,040
That was a long time ago.

285
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:30,270
Look at the mess we're in now.

286
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:38,610
What time is the Animal Care Department teacher arriving?

287
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:42,680
You told him the correct amount, right?

288
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,890
Yes. He arrives at two o'clock.

289
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:48,330
I'm sure he'll bring the correct donation money.

290
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,060
You can go.

291
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,360
All right.

292
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:56,910
Ah!

293
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:01,220
And get those noisy kids out of there.

294
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:03,550
All right.

295
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:19,110
I keep telling you to get into blue-chip stocks, not politically-themed stocks.

296
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:22,860
I'm suffering a serious loss. Have you any recommendations?

297
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:26,190
It's really serious. Give me some recommendations.

298
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:29,200
Avoid politically-themed stocks. Stick with blue-chip.

299
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,420
But this is the only way for me to make up for my loss.

300
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:34,740
Seriously, don't get into it.

301
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:37,480
Just get into blue-chip stocks and...

302
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:46,160
I heard rumors about that.

303
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,650
Did you?

304
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:52,350
- You want some recommendations? 
 - Yes.

305
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:57,980
    
   

306
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:01,770
   

307
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:09,470
Oh, well. Let's get ready for class.

308
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:13,560
   

309
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,980
Ah Reum, is it good?

310
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:23,730
Yes, it's really good.

311
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:27,780
Why suddenly have grilled ribs?

312
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:30,130
Ah Reum likes it.

313
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:33,470
I knew you would be feeling down.

314
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:37,060
Don't worry about it and eat as much as you want.

315
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:45,000
Delicious.

316
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:53,520
Ah Reum, the sweet-and-salty taste is great, right?

317
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,300
Yes, it's so yummy.

318
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,000
What did you do all day?

319
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:07,920
I'm busy.

320
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:10,370
I clean the house.

321
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:12,570
I think about what to do going forward,

322
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:16,900
and then it's already time for Ah Reum to come home.

323
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:19,290
That's how it is.

324
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:23,070
You finally got a job, and now you're jobless again.

325
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:25,430
What are you planning to do?

326
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:30,050
If you're so worried about me losing my job, why did you send me that phone?

327
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:32,760
If I hadn't, wouldn't you have lost your job?

328
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:35,620
You were going to do it so you might as well win.

329
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:38,550
You're right.

330
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:43,560
I'm glad about that one thing, at least. I'm glad Cheol Joo won.

331
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,970
Don't you regret it?

332
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:52,110
You lost your job again after stepping forward on behalf of someone.

333
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:58,830
It tastes bitter. It's so bitter it hurts.

334
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:02,170
It's not like I'm the guardian of righteousness.

335
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:05,920
Why does it feel like a repetitive cycle?

336
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,970
Is it my fate?

337
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:24,230
 ...regarding an on-site apprentice from our school who was injured five years ago. 

338
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:28,010
-  We must protect our teacher.  
 - It's not the same as last time.

339
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:29,090
 Unfair dismissal. 

340
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:31,620
 Withdraw, withdraw, withdraw. 

341
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:34,930
 We want to keep learning from Mr. Lee Kang Hoon. 

342
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:36,020
 Unfair dismissal. 

343
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:39,600
 Withdraw, withdraw, withdraw. 

344
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:46,300
Although everyone turned their backs on you back then,

345
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:48,480
it's not like that this time.

346
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:55,270
Are you crying? This is ridiculous.

347
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:57,500
Geez.

348
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:03,120
Why are these kids overreacting? Seriously.

349
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,300
Gosh.

350
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:24,090
Seo Young. Thank you for doing this with us.

351
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:27,360
I'm just standing here for a while in the morning.

352
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:32,090
But the school could blacklist you if you do this.

353
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:35,210
Isn't this bad for you if you want to go to college?

354
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:39,570
I'm already higher up on the blacklist than you.

355
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:51,080
You guys! What are you doing every morning?

356
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:55,170
There's a limit to letting things slide.

357
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:57,560
Stop ruining the school atmosphere and get going.

358
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:01,060
Please withdraw Mr. Lee's dismissal. Then we'll break it up.

359
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:04,390
This isn't something you can achieve by insisting.

360
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:07,380
When are you guys going to grow up?

361
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:12,080
This is an unfair dismissal. We all know it.

362
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,520
If you don't break it up right now,

363
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:19,930
I'm going to call all your parents.

364
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:24,060
We'll open up a guidance committee meeting if you still don't break it up.

365
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:25,930
Do you understand?

366
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:32,030
On what grounds would the guidance committee meeting take place?

367
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:33,710
What?

368
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:37,120
Isn't protesting one of the fundamental rights?

369
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:41,720
From what I know, our right to protest freely can't be suppressed just because we're at school.

370
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:45,570
Is that what you were suggesting?

371
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:47,650
What did you say?

372
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:50,940
Kang Seo Young,

373
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:55,030
don't you care about anything anymore?

374
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:02,130
Mr. Lee!

375
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,690
Oh, Mr. Lee Kang Hoon.

376
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:07,840
Right on time.

377
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,430
As the person in question, tell them.

378
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:14,730
Should students be allowed to do this at an honorable school?

379
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:21,270
Go ahead and tell them.

380
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:25,930
You're not trying to do anything messy by using them as a shield, are you?

381
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,990
What are you guys doing here?

382
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:38,250
Where are the rest of you?

383
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:39,920
Where are the Carpentry Club guys?

384
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:44,330
Let's see. Where's Jung Young Joo? You guys...

385
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:46,640
Mr. Lee...

386
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:48,850
What are you trying to do right now?

387
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:52,320
Stop threatening students with ridiculous reasoning.

388
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:56,320
I'm regretting stepping down so easily.

389
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,910
Are you getting these students riled up?

390
00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:00,760
Is that right as a teacher?

391
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:05,020
I'll show them by taking this all the way and prove what's right and wrong.

392
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:08,110
That is what I must do as a teacher.

393
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:10,090
Don't be intimidated!

394
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:15,450
Stop telling my students what to do!

395
00:29:18,530 --> 00:29:22,110
How can a teacher threaten students?

396
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:32,540
♫  Dream on, dream on, dream on  ♫

397
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:37,110
What are students supposed to learn?

398
00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:43,440
Wow!. That was so cool.

399
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,190
I was so scared.

400
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:48,070
Could you tell that I memorized my lines?

401
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:49,720
A little?

402
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:54,460
Fewer students are here as we decided to split into groups.

403
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:57,500
They'll be here tomorrow, so don't be discouraged.

404
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:00,570
Not at all. I just said that to look tough before.

405
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:03,990
And starting tomorrow, don't gather like this.

406
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:05,640
I'll guard this post.

407
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:09,610
Not at all. We're going to take your classes again no matter what.

408
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:11,390
Let's do this together.

409
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:17,450
Gosh. That's enough. I'll get my position back myself.

410
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:21,270
If you really want to help, get me some sausage bread from the school store.

411
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:24,450
That's what I miss the most about school.

412
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:25,680
That's ridiculous.

413
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:28,220
I'm joking.

414
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:31,690
All right, classes are about to start. Get inside.

415
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:33,880
Got it!

416
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:37,290
   

417
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,990
All right, Carpentry Avengers, assemble.

418
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:42,680
The results of the Baro Furniture project are here.

419
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,860
I'm clicking.

420
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:59,120
   

421
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:04,660
We're not on it.

422
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:08,250
Geez, we were in second place in the first round.

423
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:11,560
But we're ninth in the second round.

424
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:14,580
It's my fault.

425
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:19,150
I made a huge mistake.

426
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:22,460
I'm sorry, guys.

427
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:23,970
Come on.

428
00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:27,770
That's not true. We still had fun, and it was worthwhile.

429
00:31:27,770 --> 00:31:28,850
That's right.

430
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:32,500
It was the best memory of my life.

431
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:36,950
- It...  It was that good? 
 - Yes.

432
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:38,340
The best.

433
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:40,580
That's a shame.

434
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:42,900
Oh, well.

435
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,960
   

436
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:52,280
Ah, yes. Yes.

437
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,700
Got it. I'll tell him to leave.

438
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:58,630
I'll tell him straight. Got it. Yes, yes.

439
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:03,460
Geez, seriously. I'm telling you. The guests of the school will arrive soon.

440
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:05,700
- So go home for today. 
 - But—

441
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:08,420
All right. Then do it somewhere else far from here.

442
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:11,840
What's the point of doing this where no one sees me?

443
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,480
Come on, go, go.

444
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,460
Mr. Kim, you know better. Come on now.

445
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:17,500
Come on, Mr. Kim—

446
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:22,000
Mr. Lee!

447
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:29,890
Jung Young Joo.

448
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:45,190
What about your classes?

449
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:51,110
Didn't you ever skip classes when you were in school?

450
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:53,590
I was an exemplary student.

451
00:32:56,370 --> 00:33:01,140
Geez, there's nothing to say to you. This is so awkward. Go inside.

452
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,760
You were glad to see me earlier.

453
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:07,930
M-Me? When? What?

454
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,960
Don't worry about it.

455
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:14,780
Go inside and pay attention in your classes.

456
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:21,330
I want to help somehow.

457
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:26,000
You kept my secret during the flowerpot incident,

458
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,350
and you even got fired because of testifying for my brother.

459
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,930
And every time, I misunderstood you.

460
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:36,530
I have no words.

461
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,020
Gosh. Chills.

462
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:45,290
This is so unlike you.

463
00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:49,500
Listen to me...

464
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:53,630
and don't worry your family anymore.

465
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:57,460
I'll manage that myself.

466
00:33:57,460 --> 00:34:02,790
Seriously, you're all talk. You really won't listen to me, will you?

467
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:19,410
   

468
00:34:19,410 --> 00:34:22,860
Another day. Another school day is over.

469
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:24,140
Who wants jjolmyeon*? 
    

470
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:25,360
I do!

471
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:29,070
Hello?

472
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,550
Sorry?

473
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:35,570
Oh, really?

474
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:40,300
Yes, yes. Oh, okay.

475
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:44,280
Yes. Thank you. I'll think about it.

476
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:54,290
Hey.

477
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:57,050
I need to talk to you.

478
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,700
You...

479
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:07,290
You're my manager, right?

480
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:12,310
I got a call from a place called Proud Entertainment.

481
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:13,910
They want to meet with me.

482
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:15,990
They have an audition program early next year

483
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:19,290
and they asked if I wanted to appear on it as their company representative.

484
00:35:19,290 --> 00:35:22,800
I'm going to meet them tomorrow.

485
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,620
By chance...

486
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:29,490
Can you come with me?

487
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:34,530
- No. 
 - What?

488
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:38,340
I told you last time. I'm busy now, and I can't be your manager anymore.

489
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:42,340
Are you seriously going to be like this? How can you do this to me?

490
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:45,190
I'm sorry, Eun Bi.

491
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,050
 Pr... Proud... 

492
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:01,450
   

493
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:03,640
Gosh.

494
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:06,850
A big entertainment company. That's a relief.

495
00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:15,640
 Right. I'll end the live stream here for today. Dream of me! 

496
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:18,650
 I found out why Go Eun Bi was fired from Tower Entertainment. Pregnancy. 

497
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:21,140
 Careful. I'll report you for false rumors. 

498
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:24,000
 I heard a baby crying on the live stream. 

499
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:28,590
Right. I can't get in Eun Bi's way.

500
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:31,560
Right, Hyun Woo?

501
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:48,620
You must be so tired.

502
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:52,940
You wake up early every day to protest because of me.

503
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:56,650
Don't do that. You should take turns, too.

504
00:36:57,130 --> 00:37:01,390
Come on. A needle and thread go together.

505
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:05,070
Besides, it's not because of you.

506
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:07,510
- Really? 
 - Yes.

507
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:12,040
I find Mr. Lee's incident so enraging and unfair too.

508
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:18,330
I'm never going to let those I care about get away from me so easily.

509
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:23,070
I have to make an effort like Jin Ji Won.

510
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,300
What is it?

511
00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:36,540
You know...

512
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:39,920
you've always been cool,

513
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:43,440
but you just seem much cooler now.

514
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:48,160
Geez.

515
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,810
This is just the beginning.

516
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:52,320
What are we going to do?

517
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:55,030
What are you going to do? Are you going to flip?

518
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:56,630
I don't know.

519
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:04,220
That's the bench that you made, right? Want to sit there for a bit?

520
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:05,660
Okay.

521
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:13,460
   

522
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,500
It's really well made.

523
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:23,490
How did you get so good so fast? It's amazing.

524
00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:28,200
I don't know about my skills, but it was fun.

525
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:31,030
Do you really like carpentry now?

526
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:35,610
I just... like the smell of wood.

527
00:38:35,610 --> 00:38:40,340
It makes me think of Grandpa and makes me feel at ease.

528
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,490
What about you?

529
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:51,290
The workspace on the rooftop is getting dusty.

530
00:38:52,050 --> 00:38:54,490
It's not like you. What's going on?

531
00:38:56,350 --> 00:39:00,350
I don't know anymore, honestly.

532
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:04,760
Maybe this isn't for me, and I'm just forcing my way through it.

533
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:07,080
I keep being scared.

534
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:12,290
Maybe my mom is right, and I'm not talented enough.

535
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:17,610
You do like it, though, right?

536
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:21,690
I don't know about that anymore either.

537
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:35,760
   

538
00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:41,260
Mr. Lee.

539
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:43,290
It's me, Gong Ki Joon.

540
00:39:43,290 --> 00:39:45,850
What's up with you so late?

541
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:47,530
 Is it about Ji Won? 

542
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:49,020
Yes.

543
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:53,130
I'd like to ask a favor of you, please.

544
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,420
So that's what it's come to.

545
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:02,040
It was like that with Mr. Kim and now Supervisor Lee.

546
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:06,890
Oh, no. All because of us. I feel horrible.

547
00:40:06,890 --> 00:40:11,270
Is there something we can do for him?

548
00:40:11,270 --> 00:40:14,460
I'll call Mr. Lee.

549
00:40:15,110 --> 00:40:18,930
I'll ask around, so don't worry so much.

550
00:40:21,490 --> 00:40:23,740
 Director Gu's says she will press charges. 

551
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:26,920
 Do you know what that means? Your life will be over! 

552
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,710
 Hey. Hey! 

553
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:30,900
 I'll just pretend I never saw— 

554
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:34,390
 Your brother really worries about you a lot. 

555
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:37,390
 If there's anything I can help with, let me know. 

556
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:41,030
 If the trial moves forward, your family's chance to win will improve. 

557
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:44,090
 I'll testify. 

558
00:40:54,350 --> 00:40:57,520
So you were called to the director's office?

559
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,430
What did she say?

560
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:03,350
She told me not to hang out with you guys.

561
00:41:03,350 --> 00:41:05,330
She said you guys would influence me.

562
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:10,990
I don't think you're the type to be influenced by anyone.

563
00:41:10,990 --> 00:41:12,550
I guess not.

564
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:15,450
You didn't have to protest with us.

565
00:41:15,450 --> 00:41:19,610
I want Mr. Lee to come back too.

566
00:41:20,950 --> 00:41:25,740
Do you think he can return if we keep doing this?

567
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:27,830
It won't be easy.

568
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:31,830
It's only our impression that it was an unfair dismissal.

569
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:37,680
But my mom says

570
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:41,690
that the board never agreed to it.

571
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:42,720
What?

572
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:45,300
My mom is the head of the foundation.

573
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:49,130
So all faculty dismissals have to go through the board.

574
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:52,970
But more than half disagreed with the dismissal, so it fell through.

575
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:57,340
I checked the board meeting log on our school website last time.

576
00:41:57,340 --> 00:42:01,050
It said that the board agreed to dismiss Mr. Lee.

577
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:04,380
There's a real-meeting record

578
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:06,470
as opposed to the public version.

579
00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:09,060
Aunt is meticulous about keeping records,

580
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:11,980
so she makes sure all meetings have minutes,

581
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:16,480
and then she just doesn't reveal the adverse parts.

582
00:42:18,090 --> 00:42:21,060
- That's not right. 
 - It's not.

583
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:24,880
But if the board disagreed,

584
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:28,450
doesn't that mean Mr. Lee's dismissal was unfair?

585
00:42:28,450 --> 00:42:30,190
Where's the real-meeting log?

586
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:33,680
If we get hold of it, I think it might be worth continuing the fight.

587
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:39,160
My mom said the log should be in the director's office.

588
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:41,420
But how can we get it?

589
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:44,400
I can't ask Aunt to just give it to me.

590
00:42:58,270 --> 00:43:00,740
I don't think I can do it.

591
00:43:02,350 --> 00:43:05,390
Why? What did Mr. Lee say?

592
00:43:05,390 --> 00:43:08,570
He said we submitted the proposal for six benches

593
00:43:08,570 --> 00:43:11,180
and we received all the funds,

594
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:15,120
so we have to build all six and install them.

595
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:18,520
He didn't say that when the bench broke.

596
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:20,700
Why is he suddenly...

597
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:29,370
He's right. You were supposed to build it,

598
00:43:29,370 --> 00:43:31,220
so you should take responsibility.

599
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:32,560
What?

600
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:35,760
You're saying the same thing as Mr. Lee.

601
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:41,690
Anyway, let's do it together.

602
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:47,690
Come on.

603
00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:22,700
   

604
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:33,780
   

605
00:45:10,990 --> 00:45:12,090
   

606
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:14,980
   

607
00:46:04,190 --> 00:46:05,410
Hey, guys.

608
00:46:05,410 --> 00:46:07,560
Wrap it up now.

609
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:09,140
Okay.

610
00:46:15,070 --> 00:46:17,850
Where did the time go?

611
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:31,960
How does it feel to be woodworking again?

612
00:46:32,650 --> 00:46:34,320
You know...

613
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:37,570
I'm just doing it because I have to.

614
00:46:37,570 --> 00:46:40,170
You didn't look like you were being forced to do it.

615
00:46:40,170 --> 00:46:42,130
It was that Jin Ji Won look.

616
00:46:42,130 --> 00:46:44,500
You didn't even realize how late it was.

617
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:48,020
If it's fun, just do it.

618
00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:50,860
Don't think too deeply about it.

619
00:46:53,390 --> 00:46:58,010
I wanted to be the best carpenter at building houses in our country.

620
00:46:58,010 --> 00:47:01,310
It looks like that won't be me.

621
00:47:04,190 --> 00:47:06,110
Ji Won...

622
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:09,860
Do you have to be the best?

623
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:14,700
Can't you just be about 285th?

624
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:18,230
Wouldn't it be enough just to be that good?

625
00:47:18,230 --> 00:47:19,710
What?

626
00:47:19,710 --> 00:47:21,120
You know,

627
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:27,500
wasn't your goal to have people live happily in the house that you built?

628
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:31,200
You once said that this would make you happy.

629
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:34,610
Even if you're not the best at it,

630
00:47:34,610 --> 00:47:37,240
isn't that enough?

631
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:40,000
 Talent isn't important. 

632
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:45,240
 What's matters... is whether you're truly happy doing carpentry. 

633
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:47,280
 That's important. 

634
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,330
 How is it? 

635
00:47:49,330 --> 00:47:51,620
 Is it not fun anymore? 

636
00:47:51,620 --> 00:47:56,550
 Look into your heart carefully. 

637
00:47:58,020 --> 00:48:00,030
What are you thinking about?

638
00:48:03,270 --> 00:48:07,390
That you're a lot like your grandfather.

639
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:11,500
Of course.

640
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:13,700
Of course, I'm a lot like him.

641
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:30,470
Get inside. I'm going.

642
00:48:30,470 --> 00:48:33,580
Okay. I'll text you later.

643
00:49:32,730 --> 00:49:35,180
   

644
00:49:40,670 --> 00:49:42,550
 Hey. 

645
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:46,970
 The meeting log you mentioned earlier. 

646
00:49:46,970 --> 00:49:51,390
 The one with the board opposing Mr. Lee's dismissal. 

647
00:49:52,070 --> 00:49:54,600
 Where is it in the director's office? 

648
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:56,200
 I'm not sure. 

649
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:57,820
 I don't know exactly where, 

650
00:49:57,820 --> 00:50:02,800
 but Aunt always keeps the important stuff in the first drawer of her desk. 

651
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,850
 But why? 

652
00:50:04,850 --> 00:50:06,400
 Pardon? 

653
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:08,950
 It's nothing. 

654
00:50:14,230 --> 00:50:18,430
   

655
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:41,960
Jung Young Joo!

656
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:56,190
 Young Joo? 

657
00:50:56,190 --> 00:50:59,880
 Yes. I guess he comes over often. 

658
00:51:00,850 --> 00:51:03,590
 He's not here today. Why? 

659
00:51:03,590 --> 00:51:07,510
 Do you have the phone number of his mom or brother? 

660
00:51:07,510 --> 00:51:09,830
 Call them and ask if he's home. 

661
00:51:09,830 --> 00:51:11,450
 What's going on? 

662
00:51:11,450 --> 00:51:13,820
 He hasn't been answering my calls. 

663
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:16,460
 I'm nervous about something. 

664
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:21,580
 You know how he has  been struggling and blaming himself for Mr. Lee's dismissal? 

665
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:25,370
 Earlier today, he learned that the board's record of opposing the dismissal 

666
00:51:25,370 --> 00:51:27,160
 is in the director's office. 

667
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:30,600
 That's when he got this weird look in his eyes. 

668
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:32,550
 Maybe I'm overreacting, 

669
00:51:32,550 --> 00:51:35,250
 but I get more nervous as I think about it. 

670
00:51:38,790 --> 00:51:40,670
 Ki Joon. 

671
00:51:42,590 --> 00:51:46,130
 Where are you going? Mom said to put this in your fridge. 

672
00:51:46,130 --> 00:51:49,100
 Can you put it in the fridge? I'm in a hurry. 

673
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:51,350
 Where are you going? Is something going on? 

674
00:51:51,350 --> 00:51:54,250
 I have to get to school right now. 

675
00:51:54,250 --> 00:51:56,560
 Keep a watch in case Young Joo comes by. 

676
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:59,410
 - Okay? 
 - Okay. 

677
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:08,230
How did you get in here?

678
00:52:08,230 --> 00:52:10,600
What are you doing right now?

679
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:14,140
Don't you know that the when you smash it, security is notified?

680
00:52:15,010 --> 00:52:16,920
I know that,

681
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:19,170
but I don't care.

682
00:52:22,050 --> 00:52:24,770
Seo Young told me what happened.

683
00:52:24,770 --> 00:52:28,070
I know why you're doing this,

684
00:52:28,070 --> 00:52:29,510
but it isn't right.

685
00:52:29,510 --> 00:52:32,800
I should have been punished for throwing that flowerpot anyway.

686
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:35,640
I'll just think of this as punishment for that.

687
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:37,160
Don't stop me.

688
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:40,110
I've thought about it and made my choice.

689
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:45,180
Stop acting like an idiot!

690
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:47,290
This all happened because of me.

691
00:52:47,290 --> 00:52:49,320
I have to resolve it.

692
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:50,890
"Because of me"?

693
00:52:51,650 --> 00:52:54,930
How do you think Mr. Lee would feel if you did this?

694
00:52:54,930 --> 00:52:59,610
"I'm glad. I'm happy I have my job back, thanks to Young Joo."

695
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:02,490
Do you think he'd say that?

696
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:07,180
You're doing this to make yourself feel better.

697
00:53:07,180 --> 00:53:10,060
- Shut up. 
 - Mr. Lee...

698
00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:13,070
made his choice to do the right thing

699
00:53:13,070 --> 00:53:16,290
even if he got fired from the school.

700
00:53:16,290 --> 00:53:18,330
What right do you have?

701
00:53:19,090 --> 00:53:21,870
Who are you to trample all over that?

702
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:25,630
If you act like this,

703
00:53:25,630 --> 00:53:29,540
you're spitting on Mr. Lee's decision.

704
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:31,760
Do you really not know that?

705
00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:40,250
And besides,

706
00:53:43,530 --> 00:53:46,190
don't I even matter to you?

707
00:53:47,730 --> 00:53:48,790
What?

708
00:53:48,790 --> 00:53:51,970
I have to get back at you

709
00:53:51,970 --> 00:53:54,100
for disliking me so much.

710
00:53:54,710 --> 00:53:58,900
So... you have to stay by my side,

711
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:02,440
so I can pay you back.

712
00:54:03,310 --> 00:54:04,730
Okay?

713
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:12,720
 Is anyone there? 

714
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:18,710
Sh*t.

715
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:14,930
Hey, hey.

716
00:55:14,930 --> 00:55:16,690
There's a surveillance camera here.

717
00:55:16,690 --> 00:55:18,190
Let's go that way.

718
00:55:28,310 --> 00:55:30,340
Geez.

719
00:55:30,340 --> 00:55:32,110
Hey!

720
00:55:35,660 --> 00:55:39,010
Jung Young Joo... you... seriously!

721
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:43,980
Hey.

722
00:55:45,810 --> 00:55:48,300
I scolded him for the first round,

723
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:51,860
but I'm not sure I managed to get through to him.

724
00:55:51,860 --> 00:55:57,180
You should get... what do you call it... straighten out the facts for him as the second round.

725
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:02,180
Get rid of that hammer.

726
00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:04,290
You're scaring me to death.

727
00:56:04,290 --> 00:56:05,740
Hey...

728
00:56:05,740 --> 00:56:08,250
Hey, where are you going?

729
00:56:17,710 --> 00:56:19,860
Why did you come all the way here?

730
00:56:19,860 --> 00:56:22,940
Why did you tell Ki Joon?

731
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:30,510
- Are you angry? 
 - Yes.

732
00:56:31,210 --> 00:56:32,730
Why?

733
00:56:33,820 --> 00:56:35,830
"Why"?

734
00:56:35,830 --> 00:56:38,480
I couldn't focus on anything during work.

735
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:42,010
I was worried you'd do something and drive yourself into a corner again.

736
00:56:42,010 --> 00:56:43,590
You only thought of yourself.

737
00:56:43,590 --> 00:56:46,220
Don't you think of those who worry about you?

738
00:56:55,610 --> 00:56:57,490
I'm sorry.

739
00:56:58,970 --> 00:57:01,530
Nothing happened, so it's fine.

740
00:57:01,530 --> 00:57:04,740
There has to be another way to resolve Mr. Lee's case.

741
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:19,400
Oh!

742
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:20,990
Ki Joon!

743
00:57:24,220 --> 00:57:26,150
Are you okay?

744
00:57:27,220 --> 00:57:29,850
What about Young Joo? Did you find him?

745
00:57:30,770 --> 00:57:32,710
I barely talked him out of it.

746
00:57:32,710 --> 00:57:34,950
Nothing happened.

747
00:57:34,950 --> 00:57:37,730
That's such a relief.

748
00:57:37,730 --> 00:57:39,830
Why are you out here? It's cold.

749
00:57:39,830 --> 00:57:43,040
What else could I do when you left like that?

750
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:45,100
I wanted to chase after you,

751
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:47,390
but you asked me to watch for Young Joo,

752
00:57:47,390 --> 00:57:48,700
so I couldn't leave here.

753
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:52,620
I was really worried something had happened, and—

754
00:57:55,710 --> 00:57:57,590
Hey.

755
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:00,900
I'm glad.

756
00:58:02,010 --> 00:58:04,570
What is it? Are you okay?

757
00:58:05,330 --> 00:58:07,090
Yes. I am.

758
00:58:07,090 --> 00:58:08,920
I'm happy.

759
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:18,240
I'm so happy that you're by my side.

760
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:51,480
Geez.

761
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:53,130
So...

762
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:56,510
You saw her get on the bus,

763
00:58:57,190 --> 00:58:59,150
waved at her and then left?

764
00:58:59,150 --> 00:59:00,740
Yes.

765
00:59:00,740 --> 00:59:04,530
At that hour, it was the last bus running.

766
00:59:04,530 --> 00:59:06,390
What a relief.

767
00:59:06,390 --> 00:59:09,020
"A relief"? Yes...

768
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:14,020
What?

769
00:59:14,020 --> 00:59:15,650
What is it?

770
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:19,450
You...

771
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:22,140
What?

772
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:24,640
Seriously...

773
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:27,440
"What a relief," did you say?

774
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:29,140
That hurts... that hurts.

775
00:59:29,140 --> 00:59:31,610
That hurts!

776
00:59:32,570 --> 00:59:34,260
What?

777
00:59:36,110 --> 00:59:37,870
 You only thought of yourself. 

778
00:59:37,870 --> 00:59:40,550
 Don't you think of those who worry about you? 

779
00:59:43,060 --> 00:59:45,540
   

780
00:59:49,740 --> 00:59:51,520
What's that?

781
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:01,700
Why police cars here?

782
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:03,020
Did something happen?

783
01:00:03,020 --> 01:00:06,080
I don't know. What's going on?

784
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:09,970
I've got a bad feeling about this.

785
01:00:13,350 --> 01:00:14,560
Hey.

786
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:18,380
You guys should hurry and get inside today.

787
01:00:31,290 --> 01:00:33,380
We should use a stronger phrase.

788
01:00:33,380 --> 01:00:35,840
Let's make another one.

789
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:37,550
Oh, no. Oh, no!

790
01:00:37,550 --> 01:00:39,220
Guys. It's a mess.

791
01:00:39,220 --> 01:00:40,430
What's wrong now?

792
01:00:40,430 --> 01:00:42,670
There was a burglary at school last night

793
01:00:42,670 --> 01:00:44,740
and Director Gu's office was robbed.

794
01:00:44,740 --> 01:00:46,370
- What? 
 - The director's office?

795
01:00:46,370 --> 01:00:48,520
Is that even possible?

796
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:51,100
The director's office?

797
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:13,390
What is the meaning of this?

798
01:01:13,390 --> 01:01:15,600
What is all this?

799
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:17,310
Well...

800
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:20,060
It looks like there was a burglar.

801
01:01:20,060 --> 01:01:23,780
But I don't know why they would rob the director's office...

802
01:01:27,220 --> 01:01:30,600
Have you figured out what's missing?

803
01:01:32,100 --> 01:01:33,860
Find it.

804
01:01:34,930 --> 01:01:38,120
Find it right now!

805
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:55,780
- Who could it be? 
 - The director's office?

806
01:01:56,590 --> 01:01:58,640
What's going on?

807
01:01:59,340 --> 01:02:01,500
Why would the director's office—

808
01:02:03,860 --> 01:02:06,250
There's no way.

809
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:10,040
Ki Joon!

810
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:12,170
Is it that student?

811
01:02:12,170 --> 01:02:14,200
I'll talk to him.

812
01:02:18,140 --> 01:02:20,240
Ki Joon...

813
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:22,700
Did you by any chance...

814
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:26,560
come to school last night?

815
