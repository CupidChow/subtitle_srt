1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:03,590
   

2
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:09,000
   

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,990
   

4
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:14,880
   

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,850
   

6
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:21,170
   

7
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:33,810
   

8
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:44,740
Then try it again.

9
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:58,610
You little...

10
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:00,830
Quit trying to be a tough guy. You little...

11
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:02,660
Unbelievable.

12
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:04,890
Geez...

13
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:09,150
I'm going easy on you because you're so tiny.

14
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:11,500
- What? 
 - What?

15
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:16,520
 Gong Ki Joon! Can you watch over the burgers? 

16
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,470
Okay!

17
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:21,720
You... geez...

18
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,220
You...

19
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,650
I'm letting this one go.

20
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:32,140
 What was that? 

21
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:34,350
 Why is he acting like that? 

22
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:40,830
   

23
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:42,970
You have a lot of umbrellas.

24
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:46,800
What's it to you? I'm collecting them. So what?

25
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,710
Are they heavy?

26
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:50,410
Do you want me to carry them?

27
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,990
It's fine.

28
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:56,120
They're not that heavy.

29
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,920
Really?

30
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,120
Okay.

31
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,740
Bye.

32
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,360
The security key.

33
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,680
She told me to take yours.

34
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,840
Oh, I see.

35
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:49,700
Thank you.

36
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:54,620
You work tomorrow, right?

37
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:56,010
Yes.

38
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:57,700
Good luck.

39
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,460
 Then try it again. 

40
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,030
   

41
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,840
   

42
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:26,910
- Ouch. 
 - Aigoo.

43
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,220
Aigoo.

44
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,560
Are you all right?

45
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,090
Yes.

46
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:33,310
There's—

47
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:35,150
There are two months left.

48
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:37,250
I said we should pack it all at once later.

49
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:39,790
It's easier to do it little by little.

50
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:44,270
Living in one place for a long time makes it hard to move,

51
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:48,400
but why have you been coming home so late recently?

52
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,840
Did you eat?

53
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,860
I got a part-time job.

54
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:54,070
I ate a hamburger for dinner.

55
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:57,120
I told you not to worry about finding a place to live.

56
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,550
I have some money.

57
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:01,260
I...

58
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:03,800
I want to have some money, too.

59
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:08,720
Are you working night shifts this week?

60
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,860
You'll be tired.

61
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,310
Not at all.

62
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:12,800
Nights are easier.

63
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,210
It's quiet.

64
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:17,520
Go inside. Change and wash up.

65
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,460
Okay.

66
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:24,170
Ouch...

67
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,890
 New Message 

68
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,470
 Can I buy from you early in the morning? 

69
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:38,190
   

70
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,720
   

71
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:53,520
   

72
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:12,530
Where is it?

73
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:14,470
The watch?

74
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:18,430
Yes.

75
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:22,290
Oh, one second.

76
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,270
Okay, here.

77
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,480
It's real, right?

78
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,450
It's not fake, right?

79
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,910
Go Eun Bi?

80
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:56,880
Why are you selling this?

81
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,180
Why are you buying it?

82
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:01,150
And what is this place?

83
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:03,400
It took me forever to find this place.

84
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:07,410
The agency said not to go into luxury stores.

85
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:10,550
If the fans start hating me before I debut...

86
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:15,580
Let's just pretend we don't know each other.

87
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:17,150
Okay.

88
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:24,120
Since we're in the same class, can I get a discount?

89
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,640
A classmate discount.

90
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,410
No.

91
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:33,370
Heartless.

92
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:36,750
Bye. Enjoy it.

93
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:40,540
- Hey, don't tell anyone! 
 - I won't!

94
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,430
Ahem.

95
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:20,230
Oh—

96
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:23,910
Let's go.

97
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:35,400
Good morning.

98
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,750
- Good morning. 
 - Good morning.

99
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:49,380
Gosh, how far are we going?

100
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,670
You don't pick up my calls. You ignore my texts.

101
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:56,250
Do you think you can get away with avoiding me?

102
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:57,720
No, I...

103
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,500
It's my first time teaching. I'm all over the place.

104
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,040
What were you thinking, coming to my school?

105
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,810
I didn't know you were here.

106
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:08,580
Cheol Min pleaded with me, saying I was the only one, so I came and...

107
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,410
it was here.

108
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:13,280
I mean it.

109
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,560
You never said you knew Mr. Shin Cheol Min.

110
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:20,010
I didn't know you knew him, either. Besides...

111
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:23,640
we were not close enough to tell each other about our friends.

112
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,510
Fine.

113
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:28,460
Why do you suddenly want to teach?

114
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:32,200
A teacher...

115
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:35,570
has a good work-life balance.

116
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:38,690
Indeed, people don't change.

117
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:41,690
You just make a mess and let things happen.

118
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:44,330
You don't seem to find this uncomfortable.

119
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,100
Ms. Chae Rin!

120
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,700
The teaching director is looking for you.

121
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,580
Oh, okay!

122
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:54,890
Anyway, don't act as if you know me at school.

123
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:57,710
We're acting like we know each other right now.

124
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:04,070
Wow. I was great.

125
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:05,970
I miss Ji Won.

126
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:07,460
Look at Jin Ji Won.

127
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:09,530
Her profile pic is so funny.

128
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:11,530
What is this? Why is she doing this?

129
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:13,600
I know, right?

130
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:33,890
I got you.

131
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:35,130
No, that's not it.

132
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:36,530
   

133
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,680
Hey, Gong Ki Joon.

134
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:43,520
You're lonely without Ji Won, right?

135
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,940
It's nice and quiet.

136
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:48,650
But...

137
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:52,050
I'm not sure if it's quiet where she is.

138
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:00,850
   

139
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:04,650
   

140
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,530
 August 30, 

141
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:18,530
 I watered the orchid in the manager's office. 

142
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,240
 August 31, 

143
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:28,570
 I shredded documents. 

144
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:30,610
 September 1, 

145
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:35,550
 I set up snacks at the training field. 

146
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,030
 September 2, 

147
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:41,450
 I cleaned the dust on the AC fan. 

148
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,440
 September 3rd. 

149
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,910
It has to go down lower.

150
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:48,910
I understand.

151
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:51,110
No, lower.

152
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:52,370
All right.

153
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:54,650
No, this way, this way!

154
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:57,470
What do you learn at school?

155
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,540
I'm sorry.

156
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:05,550
 I typed in the manager's Excel sheet. F***... 

157
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:14,450
Ji Won, two cups of coffee!

158
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:24,330
- Wow, you grew it so well. 
 - Watch out.

159
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:25,870
I'm going to auction this.

160
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:27,180
If you touch it, you'll lower the price.

161
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:31,000
Aigoo, so stingy for a big guy like you.

162
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,750
Aigoo.

163
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,520
She's a little girl.

164
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,070
It sure must be nice.

165
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:41,870
Wow, blossoming youngsters like her, serving you coffee every day.

166
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:43,370
It must be nice.

167
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:46,180
It's all work experience.

168
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,670
You look so pretty.

169
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:53,960
How old are you?

170
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:58,770
S***, seriously.

171
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:04,510
Eighteen*. 
  (TN: "Eighteen" in Korean sounds like a swear word) 

172
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:11,330
Enjoy.

173
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:13,540
Oh, oh.

174
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:15,970
That surprised me. I thought she was swearing.

175
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:17,350
Thank you.

176
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:29,560
Ji Won, what's wrong?

177
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,970
I can't take it anymore.

178
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:33,140
What are you going to do?

179
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,600
You said you couldn't go out on-site during the six months.

180
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,890
Are you just going to take it?

181
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,060
Hey!

182
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:44,240
What are you doing, you brat?

183
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,790
Please let us go on-site.

184
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:48,980
You hired us to teach us how to build a house.

185
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:51,050
I am teaching you.

186
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:53,200
You should be ready to learn from the start.

187
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,740
Teaching what?

188
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:57,150
How to wipe the orchid and serve coffee?

189
00:14:57,150 --> 00:15:00,790
I learned all about labor relations and employment laws in the apprenticeship class,

190
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:05,670
but what I'm doing now is completely different from our employment contract.

191
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:07,380
You little...

192
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:11,800
Whatever I do from the start, I will do it out there on-site.

193
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,950
What can you do with your puny skills?

194
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:20,660
What?

195
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:22,760
"Puny"?

196
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:26,310
Yes.

197
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:30,110
I will show you what real skill is, starting now.

198
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:38,040
Geez, seriously.

199
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:01,590
   

200
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,270
   

201
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:07,070
   

202
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:09,540
   

203
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:15,030
   

204
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:16,830
   

205
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:18,900
   

206
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:20,930
   

207
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:22,270
   

208
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,740
Yes, of course. It will never happen again.

209
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:30,560
Hello, this is Nulji...

210
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,090
I apologize.

211
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:33,560
No, that is not it.

212
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:39,550
We will call you back after we have a better sense of what is happening.

213
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:41,900
That student is quite sensitive.

214
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,950
All right, I will tell him to call you right back.

215
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:48,600
Yes, I understand.

216
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,950
Hello, Nulji—

217
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:50,950
Oh, yes.

218
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:54,430
Just how much trouble did this student cause?

219
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:58,960
I think there are a lot of issues with Sang Rim.

220
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:01,600
How can they be so harsh just because the same foundation owns us?

221
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,720
What do you mean by "harsh"?

222
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:07,890
Are all companies related to the school's foundation bad?

223
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:09,930
What kind of logic is that?

224
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:14,540
I think we do need to check on the matter.

225
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:16,160
Of course.

226
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,020
Call in Jin Ji Won.

227
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:21,000
No, I mean check with Sang Rim.

228
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:23,840
Yes, that's right.

229
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,150
Listen.

230
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:30,250
Do we have to make all this fuss because of an impatient student's post?

231
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:33,540
Ji Won is hardworking, and I'm not saying we should make a fuss.

232
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:36,180
I'm only saying we should solve the problem.

233
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,420
All right. Well said.

234
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:43,650
We have to resolve this problem by the end of the day.

235
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:47,090
You know Director Gu went to receive the Minister's Award, right?

236
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:50,950
How uneasy would it be for her if she heard this news when receiving the award?

237
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:53,540
We shouldn't keep quiet just to make Director Gu happy.

238
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:55,600
Keeping what quiet?

239
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,730
She made a big deal out of nothing.

240
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:02,030
Anyway, we must correct it today.

241
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:03,830
Understood?

242
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:10,520
Good morning!

243
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:13,300
What's going on? Why are you here?

244
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,210
Aren't you going to work?

245
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,780
That's how it is.

246
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:19,390
Why, why? Why are you here?

247
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:20,710
You didn't quit, did you?

248
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:24,710
I wonder who the brave queen messed with this time.

249
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:26,250
I'll take questions later.

250
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:28,500
I'll pass out the numbered tickets, okay?

251
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,550
Yes, Ms. Song.

252
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:39,070
Okay...

253
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,130
Okay.

254
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:49,150
I have to go to the office.

255
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:53,130
"Office"?

256
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:55,350
What's going on?

257
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:16,270
Take down all the posts.

258
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,730
No.

259
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:22,830
You're pretty brazen.

260
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:25,240
You should have discussed it with me first.

261
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,510
I'm sorry.

262
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:28,180
I was so angry.

263
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:30,570
Even if you were angry—

264
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:35,520
You know, there are procedures to things.

265
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,040
You first have to tell the company on-site educator—

266
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,650
I did. I did, and he didn't listen.

267
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:44,860
How can you write all this online and humiliate the school just because he didn't listen?

268
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:48,040
If you do this, the school's reputation will be ruined.

269
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:51,820
You're ruining all the future alumni's job connections!

270
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:55,220
The company has to rectify its wrongdoings too.

271
00:19:58,330 --> 00:19:59,970
Fine.

272
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:01,930
What is it that you want?

273
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:04,410
I want to learn on-site skills.

274
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:12,220
- Are you finished? 
 - Yes.

275
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:23,060
What...

276
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:28,360
Mark X where you're cutting.

277
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,530
You won't be confused that way.

278
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:33,860
Oh, thank you.

279
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:45,090
You could go somewhere better.

280
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,800
The apprenticeship...

281
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,780
You could go somewhere else instead of Sang Rim.

282
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:00,950
There will be another chance.

283
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:02,810
You'll do well.

284
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:09,390
What's this?

285
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:11,770
Being cheesy out of nowhere.

286
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,620
What?

287
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:21,020
What's the point of saying nice things?

288
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,560
Hey!

289
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:32,200
- I want to eat tteokbokki*, too. 
 - Me, too. 
  (TN: spicy rice cakes) 

290
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,150
- Hello! 
 - You're here.

291
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:36,600
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

292
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,760
Let's go, let's go.

293
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,060
So what happened?

294
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:43,420
Oh, it's Min Seo.

295
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:45,710
Min Seo!

296
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:47,490
Hi!

297
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:51,610
That manager is still bad mouthing me, isn't he?

298
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:54,850
What? Yes, I guess.

299
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:01,400
What is it? Did something happen?

300
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:03,450
It's nothing.

301
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:05,950
- You look tired. 
 - Yes.

302
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,040
Min Seo.

303
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:10,020
Tell me if anything happens to you.

304
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:11,960
I'll take your side no matter what.

305
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,180
Okay.

306
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:19,510
Hey, hey. Min Seo is tired. We should talk about something fun.

307
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:22,730
Oh! The new guy in our class.

308
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:25,850
I heard he got out of a youth detention center.

309
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:28,440
Hey, I don't think he's that kind of guy.

310
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,270
No more fake news.

311
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,850
Jong Bok told me

312
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:35,050
that if it's for murder, they can't get out that fast.

313
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:38,440
But even this country's police can't handle him.

314
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,690
Did he check his facts?

315
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:43,020
Still, seventy percent of Jong Bok's information were facts.

316
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:44,530
Our school is crazy.

317
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:46,470
Why would they accept a student like that?

318
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:50,150
- I'm so scared. 
 - Your jjolmyeons* are served. 
  (TN: wheat noodles in a spicy sauce) 

319
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,240
Hi.

320
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:01,150
- Be quiet. 
 - What's with you? Are you crazy?

321
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:04,220
You have a lot of jobs. I'm Jin Ji Won.

322
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:06,430
I know.

323
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:08,330
You're not speaking formally anymore.

324
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:10,190
- We are sorry. 
 - Sorry.

325
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:13,030
We're regulars here. We'll see each other often.

326
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:14,560
- What are you talking about? 
 - No, no.

327
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,480
- No. 
 - Stop.

328
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:21,040
Thanks for the food.

329
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,250
Hello.

330
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:23,410
What? Why?

331
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:25,720
Eat up, eat up. Enjoy.

332
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:56,730
Didn't you hear me?

333
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:58,570
I told you not to hang around me.

334
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:01,200
I come here often.

335
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,890
I'm here to eat jjolmyeon.

336
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:05,110
I don't sell to b*stards like you.

337
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:07,790
Get lost.

338
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:15,740
Ki Joon!

339
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:18,080
Your jjolmyeon is ready.

340
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,450
Okay.

341
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:25,680
It's not good if it gets mushy.

342
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:31,200
   

343
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:41,420
Jung Young Joo,

344
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:45,040
Ki Joon is a customer right now.

345
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,700
That's enough.

346
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:11,970
It looks like Ki Joon still does taekwondo.

347
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:16,720
He was obsessed with taekwondo.

348
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,340
He'll probably go to university with taekwondo.

349
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:25,970
Leave it. I'll do it.

350
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:27,670
I heard you guys were in the same class.

351
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:31,860
It'd be nice to go back to how it was with Ki Joon.

352
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:39,350
Is it still because of what happened back then?

353
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,740
That was—

354
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:44,660
I'm done eating. Thank you.

355
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:48,880
You haven't finished your food, Young Joo.

356
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:54,010
Don't worry.

357
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:56,530
He's just soft-hearted.

358
00:25:57,150 --> 00:25:58,790
Aigoo.

359
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:24,530
 Hey. I'm going to wear this and win the gold medal. 

360
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:28,480
 Gold medal! Cha Gyeong Min! 

361
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:31,850
 - I'm going to win one, too. 
 - Really? 

362
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:35,290
 Gold medal! Gong Ki Joon! 

363
00:26:35,290 --> 00:26:37,720
 Gold medal! 

364
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,330
 So childish. 

365
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:42,430
 - What's with this snob? 
 - Seriously. 

366
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,800
 Fine. 

367
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:47,150
 I'll get one too then. 

368
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:49,780
 Jung Young Joo! 

369
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:52,190
 Gold medal! 

370
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:55,260
 Hey, do you think it's just handed to you? 

371
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:56,810
 You have to try hard. 

372
00:26:56,810 --> 00:26:57,900
 Right. 

373
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:00,300
 I see how it is. Do you want to have a go at it? 

374
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:01,650
 Hey, hey, hey. 

375
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:05,180
 Then we all have to win gold medals, okay? 

376
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:06,950
 But actually... 

377
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:10,650
 I feel like it's just you who has to do well. 

378
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:12,110
 Yes. 

379
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:13,770
 Do I? 

380
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:19,250
 Psyche! You little... 

381
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:21,450
 - All right, I'm sorry. 
 - We get it. 

382
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:23,510
 I'm letting this one go. 

383
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:25,280
 Fine. 

384
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:28,820
 - Lift him! 
 - Hey, hey, hey! 

385
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:30,850
 Fine, sorry, sorry! 

386
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:32,400
 Ow, ow, ow! 

387
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,730
 - Ow. 
 - What? 

388
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:35,560
 - It hurts a lot. 
 - You're faking it again. 

389
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,280
 My back seriously hurts a lot. 

390
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,020
 Are you okay? 

391
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:39,920
 Gyeong Min— 

392
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,340
 Hey! 

393
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,580
 Wait for me! 

394
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:19,870
- One! 
 - Two!

395
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:22,650
- Nulji! 
 - Nulji!

396
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:23,960
- Fighting! 
 - Fighting!

397
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,420
- One! 
 - Two!

398
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:26,840
- One! 
 - Two!

399
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,060
- Nulji! 
 - Nulji!

400
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:29,680
- Fighting! 
 - Fighting!

401
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:32,510
- Nulji! 
 - Nulji!

402
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:33,940
- Fighting! 
 - Fighting!

403
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:35,330
- Fighting! 
 - Fighting!

404
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:37,470
- Nulji! 
 - Nulji!

405
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:43,360
Min Ki, over here.

406
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,660
What are you doing? You're ruining it.

407
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:56,050
Rock, paper, scissors.

408
00:28:56,050 --> 00:28:57,830
Gong Ki Joon.

409
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,200
Empty your locker.

410
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,910
The new club members can't use it.

411
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:13,100
Okay.

412
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:25,770
The taekwondo uniform looked good on you.

413
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:28,240
Why did you quit?

414
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:33,450
- Just because. 
 - Won't you do it again?

415
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:36,900
No, I won't.

416
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,870
It's not fun anymore.

417
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:43,480
What?

418
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:47,690
- Oh, my God! 
 - Oh, no!

419
00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:49,360
Call the teacher.

420
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:52,330
Hey, hey, hey!

421
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:53,740
What's up with these two?

422
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:55,190
Hey, stop it!

423
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:57,850
Say that again. "Fun"?

424
00:29:57,850 --> 00:30:01,020
You used to cling to it so pretentiously!

425
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:03,850
- Stop it. 
 - Let me go!

426
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:05,500
Stop it! Enough!

427
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,120
Get out!

428
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,010
Get out, I said!

429
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:14,690
   

430
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:08,180
Are you okay?

431
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:12,470
It doesn't even hurt.

432
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:15,960
I heard you and Jung Young Joo went to the same middle school.

433
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,730
What does he have against you?

434
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:24,390
He must hate me.

435
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:25,850
Yes...

436
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:27,690
I suppose you are pretty unlikable,

437
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:30,480
but he didn't have to hit you for that.

438
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,380
Don't.

439
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:39,040
Don't throw stuff like that.

440
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,990
The sea creatures haven't done anything wrong.

441
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:43,610
Microplastics are all sorts of garbage.

442
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:48,520
Right.

443
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,190
My gosh.

444
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,080
Let's go.

445
00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:14,180
All right.

446
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,780
 Mom: Are you working again? 

447
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:26,850
 I thought you quit working and the apprenticeship. What's the matter with you? 

448
00:32:26,850 --> 00:32:28,830
 What's the matter with you? 

449
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:33,270
Welcome.

450
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:40,300
Goodbye.

451
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:44,220
 Why aren't you picking up my calls? 

452
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:50,380
 I'm busy. 

453
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:12,710
Jung Young Joo.

454
00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:18,460
So you take care of this place too.

455
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:22,340
Have some. It's on me.

456
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:23,610
Oh. Thanks.

457
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:25,140
Thanks.

458
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:27,210
But did you eat dinner?

459
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:31,960
No.

460
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:38,370
I thought you were only working there, but I was shocked when he said you were his brother.

461
00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:40,540
You and Cheol Joo have a very different vibe.

462
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:43,490
The other customers don't know you two are brothers, right?

463
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:48,280
Anyway, you're lucky you can eat jjolmyeon every day.

464
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,250
You know what?

465
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:55,070
You're really quiet.

466
00:33:57,420 --> 00:34:00,420
- Am I? 
 - Yes, seriously.

467
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:04,520
Do you have anything you want to know as the new guy?

468
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,870
Want to know...

469
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:10,370
Why did you...

470
00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:11,650
quit the apprenticeship?

471
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:12,770
Sang Rim?

472
00:34:12,770 --> 00:34:14,920
Are you curious about that?

473
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:21,900
There's no passion.

474
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:24,490
There's no passion for teaching the technicians

475
00:34:24,490 --> 00:34:26,330
so I quit.

476
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:31,820
I want to ask you something, too.

477
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:40,430
Why do you hate Gong Ki Joon?

478
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:49,400
You don't want to tell me.

479
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,940
Sorry.

480
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:55,680
Anyway, we are friends now, right?

481
00:34:56,570 --> 00:34:59,690
Okay, then.

482
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:17,470
Don't hit people from now on.

483
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:24,130
I have a lot to ask you,

484
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:26,190
but I'm holding back.

485
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:28,740
You don't seem like a bad guy.

486
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,940
I have to go inside.

487
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:35,290
Bye. I'll see you at school.

488
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:37,700
Leave those. I'll clean up.

489
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:41,540
Welcome.

490
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:09,150
"Complete beginners"?

491
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:21,050
Bae... baedu...

492
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:33,490
Don't sleep here.

493
00:36:39,010 --> 00:36:43,120
Seo Young can't study because of your snoring.

494
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:48,940
Aigoo.

495
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:54,940
Hey, don't drag your chair.

496
00:36:57,230 --> 00:37:00,190
Turn the page quietly.

497
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:13,550
Seo Young.

498
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:15,590
Seo Young.

499
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:18,810
Did you finish studying?

500
00:37:18,810 --> 00:37:20,680
I couldn't get anything done

501
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:22,680
because of you.

502
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,380
Seo Young.

503
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:30,650
What is this?

504
00:37:32,930 --> 00:37:34,970
Go ahead.

505
00:37:38,370 --> 00:37:40,690
Are you doing this to help me?

506
00:37:40,690 --> 00:37:42,300
What?

507
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:44,840
Well-I...

508
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:48,320
That was kind of my intention.

509
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:51,390
Move.

510
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:56,440
Continuing to pursue me repeatedly because I don't fall for you,

511
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,640
that's called stalking.

512
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:01,250
Stalking is a crime.

513
00:38:05,290 --> 00:38:09,350
Wow. As expected from Kang Seo Young.

514
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,770
Hey.

515
00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:14,400
You still haven't emptied your locker.

516
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,060
Why are you putting it off?

517
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:18,130
Are you still attached to taekwondo?

518
00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:20,780
Empty it.

519
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:22,960
Okay.

520
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,090
Empty it today!

521
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:51,760
How come you still don't know how to use a plane?

522
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,750
Guess you went to school for nothing.

523
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:57,740
- Give that to me. 
 - Okay.

524
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:59,220
Aigoo.

525
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:01,160
Look. You didn't even check it.

526
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:03,140
You need to do all the basic steps.

527
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:07,910
This may seem like nothing, but you have to start correctly.

528
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:11,050
Gosh, I say you have to learn the basics.

529
00:39:11,050 --> 00:39:14,400
If you keep this up, you're in big trouble.

530
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,790
 Taekwon! Taekwon! 

531
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,250
Ki Joon.

532
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,110
What is your dream?

533
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:50,660
I have a new dream.

534
00:39:51,290 --> 00:39:52,850
I will be a basketball player.

535
00:39:52,850 --> 00:39:55,250
Isn't it too late?

536
00:39:56,610 --> 00:40:00,720
Better late than never.

537
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:04,020
Aren't you going home?

538
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:06,830
- It's late. 
 - Go head.

539
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:08,920
Fine.

540
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:13,750
You've become really pretentious lately.

541
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:16,380
I'm off.

542
00:40:24,330 --> 00:40:26,850
So tough.

543
00:40:26,850 --> 00:40:28,460
Seriously.

544
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:30,400
What are we going to eat?

545
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,560
- Geez. 
 - Should we run?

546
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:36,840
   

547
00:41:47,370 --> 00:41:51,660
"I ate pasta today"?

548
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,920
   

549
00:42:04,010 --> 00:42:06,380
 There's no exit. 

550
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:11,210
 This is the only emergency exit that I made when I was driven to a corner. 

551
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:19,410
 But I kept regretting not telling you what I'd wanted to. 

552
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:22,590
 I was able to laugh thanks to you. 

553
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:25,120
 Thank you... 

554
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:27,000
 and I'm sorry. 

555
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,820
"Goodbye."

556
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:30,710
Chills.

557
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:32,280
What do you think?

558
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:34,770
It's serious. Seriously serious.

559
00:42:34,770 --> 00:42:38,090
Right? It's insane.

560
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:41,710
Especially the line about the pasta.

561
00:42:42,650 --> 00:42:44,550
Pasta, why?

562
00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:49,280
This was a foreign poem that trended on social media a while ago.

563
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:52,490
The title of the poem is... Here.

564
00:42:52,490 --> 00:42:54,850
"Don't Kill Yourself Today."

565
00:42:54,850 --> 00:42:56,450
It's from this poem.

566
00:42:56,450 --> 00:43:00,890
I heard young people post on social media with terrible thoughts like these are their last words.

567
00:43:00,890 --> 00:43:03,520
Saying, "I ate pasta today."

568
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:06,000
Like the first line in the letter here.

569
00:43:06,590 --> 00:43:08,510
Wow...

570
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,670
This is clearly a girl's handwriting.

571
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:14,170
These drawings too.

572
00:43:14,170 --> 00:43:16,600
One second.

573
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:19,690
Aigoo.

574
00:43:19,690 --> 00:43:21,910
   

575
00:43:29,150 --> 00:43:30,920
Where are you going?

576
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:48,890
   

577
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:53,730
 This was a foreign poem that trended on social media a while ago. 

578
00:43:53,730 --> 00:43:58,160
 I heard young people post on social media with terrible thoughts like these are their last words. 

579
00:43:58,160 --> 00:43:59,870
 I have to go to the office. 

580
00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:04,650
 It's from this poem. Saying, "I ate pasta today." 

581
00:44:04,650 --> 00:44:08,870
 "I ate pasta today"? 

582
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:13,700
 The title of the poem is "Don't Kill Yourself Today." 

583
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:14,730
   

584
00:44:14,730 --> 00:44:16,320
   

585
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:21,850
   

586
00:44:37,810 --> 00:44:40,670
 - Gold medal! 
 - I got the gold medal! 

587
00:44:40,670 --> 00:44:44,350
 This time, we'll go to that buoy over there. 

588
00:44:44,350 --> 00:44:47,070
 Then we all have to get gold medals, okay? 

589
00:44:47,070 --> 00:44:48,960
 Let's go one more time. 

590
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,440
 Isn't it kind of dangerous? 

591
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:53,910
 What's dangerous? Are you scared? If you're scared, you'll be last. 

592
00:44:53,910 --> 00:44:56,460
 Don't talk to me, you bastard. 

593
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:58,570
 I don't want to die. 

594
00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:02,180
 - You can't! 
 - Cha Gyeong Min! 

595
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:07,850
 No! 

596
00:45:07,850 --> 00:45:10,210
 Gyeong Min! 

597
00:45:11,450 --> 00:45:12,700
♫  Nil ni ri, mambo  ♫

598
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:14,650
- Ahjussi! 
 - Oh, my God.

599
00:45:14,650 --> 00:45:15,810
Open the door, please.

600
00:45:15,810 --> 00:45:18,240
Is that you, Ki Joon?

601
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:21,560
- Hello. 
 - Oh?

602
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:22,750
What are you doing here?

603
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:26,880
Ji Won isn't picking up her phone.

604
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:29,260
She's not reading my texts, either.

605
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:31,000
Ji Won?

606
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,040
Hey, Jin Ji Won!

607
00:45:33,670 --> 00:45:35,750
She should be up on the rooftop.

608
00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:37,450
The rooftop?

609
00:46:12,790 --> 00:46:14,960
What's with you?

610
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:16,890
You startled me.

611
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:19,190
Hey.

612
00:46:19,190 --> 00:46:22,910
- It hurts. What are you doing? 
 - Why won't you...!

613
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:26,540
Why won't you pick up the phone?

614
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:30,850
Did you call me?

615
00:46:30,850 --> 00:46:33,550
- Why? 
 - You're insane, right?

616
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:36,950
Why would you write this?

617
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:46,760
What is this?

618
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:50,600
What?

619
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:56,750
   

620
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:08,820
   

621
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:10,480
   

622
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:12,340
   

623
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:15,380
Are you saying I drew this on my letter?

624
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:16,680
What?

625
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,540
Yes.

626
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:24,040
That's why I thought this was you.

627
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:25,500
Me?

628
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:31,820
Gosh, who sent it? Seriously...

629
00:47:34,610 --> 00:47:36,560
I remember this shape.

630
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:39,700
But I wasn't the only one who used it. It was popular during elementary school.

631
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:41,230
Really?

632
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:46,350
Then it could be someone you know.

633
00:47:46,350 --> 00:47:49,260
It's one of the children from our elementary school for sure.

634
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:54,130
Since they left it in my locker, it must be one of the girls who had a crush on me.

635
00:47:54,130 --> 00:47:56,980
It's just a matter of who...

636
00:47:56,980 --> 00:48:00,320
Ha! What's he saying?

637
00:48:04,210 --> 00:48:05,990
Did you perhaps

638
00:48:05,990 --> 00:48:09,650
get a feeling that someone had a crush on you recently?

639
00:48:18,790 --> 00:48:20,290
Why are you looking at me?

640
00:48:20,290 --> 00:48:21,560
What?

641
00:48:22,350 --> 00:48:26,140
I just... I'm just thinking.

642
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:28,900
What?

643
00:48:32,550 --> 00:48:34,750
I think there are too many.

644
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:38,470
Could it be Seo Young...

645
00:48:38,470 --> 00:48:40,280
You're crazy.

646
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:43,960
- Hey. 
 - Aigoo.

647
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:45,870
You're the only one who's cold toward me.

648
00:48:45,870 --> 00:48:47,640
- All the other girls— 
 - Sure.

649
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:49,820
I understand.

650
00:48:49,820 --> 00:48:51,690
Aigoo.

651
00:48:51,690 --> 00:48:53,140
Geez.

652
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:56,140
You just don't know. You don't get it.

653
00:48:57,050 --> 00:49:01,550
For now, let's discuss it after we tell our homeroom teacher tomorrow.

654
00:49:05,010 --> 00:49:06,530
All right.

655
00:49:09,350 --> 00:49:10,860
Hey.

656
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:16,440
Why do you still have my letter?

657
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:19,620
I want that memory gone from this world.

658
00:49:19,620 --> 00:49:22,490
- Throw it away. 
 - I agree.

659
00:49:22,490 --> 00:49:23,980
I'm leaving.

660
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:35,500
   

661
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:40,310
It almost created another dark chapter in my life.

662
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:02,040
   

663
00:50:06,730 --> 00:50:09,650
   

664
00:50:13,190 --> 00:50:15,150
 Why won't you...! 

665
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:18,420
 Why won't you pick up the phone? 

666
00:50:25,410 --> 00:50:27,430
 Geez. 

667
00:50:27,430 --> 00:50:30,670
How many times do I have to ask for you?

668
00:50:30,670 --> 00:50:32,420
It was twice.

669
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:40,570
Fine.

670
00:50:40,570 --> 00:50:42,960
All right, fine. Anyway.

671
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:44,960
We had a rough start,

672
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:49,120
but we still met as teacher and student.

673
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:50,900
- She's not here. 
 - In the classroom—

674
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:51,980
What do we do?

675
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:54,200
Should we just leave it here?

676
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:55,640
We can't.

677
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:57,460
Then what do we do?

678
00:50:57,460 --> 00:51:00,220
Geez, who am I talking to...

679
00:51:00,220 --> 00:51:02,300
Hey. What is it?

680
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:06,250
Where is our homeroom teacher?

681
00:51:10,930 --> 00:51:12,790
Excuse me.

682
00:51:12,790 --> 00:51:14,770
Where did Ms. Song Chae Rin go?

683
00:51:14,770 --> 00:51:17,290
Ms. Song is busy preparing for the board meeting.

684
00:51:17,290 --> 00:51:18,910
Oh, okay.

685
00:51:19,770 --> 00:51:22,530
We have to give it to her now.

686
00:51:22,530 --> 00:51:24,590
I'm going crazy...

687
00:51:27,110 --> 00:51:29,660
What is it? Give it here. I'll get it to her.

688
00:51:31,940 --> 00:51:33,950
Give it to me.

689
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:50,700
What is this?

690
00:51:51,770 --> 00:51:53,820
I think it's a suicide note.

691
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:00,960
A suicide note?

692
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:04,170
Isn't this a prank? Where did you get it?

693
00:52:04,170 --> 00:52:07,880
We don't know who it is, either. It was in his locker.

694
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:12,860
Can you give it to Ms. Song as soon as she gets here?

695
00:52:12,860 --> 00:52:14,490
- Oh, Mr. Lee. 
 - Yes?

696
00:52:14,490 --> 00:52:17,380
You haven't forgotten to meet Director Gu after the board meeting, right?

697
00:52:17,380 --> 00:52:19,310
Oh, yes, yes.

698
00:52:19,310 --> 00:52:20,810
All right.

699
00:52:23,010 --> 00:52:24,070
I'll deal with you later.

700
00:52:24,070 --> 00:52:27,120
All right, get going. I'll let her know.

701
00:52:29,770 --> 00:52:31,480
Teaching Director, Sir?

702
00:52:32,390 --> 00:52:35,170
What is Director Gu like?

703
00:52:38,650 --> 00:52:42,990
What do we do if something happens? Don't we have to look into it ourselves?

704
00:52:45,020 --> 00:52:47,890
Eun Bi, Seo Young, Jae Hee, Yoo Min, Han Sol, Ah Young, Ji Hoo,

705
00:52:47,890 --> 00:52:49,870
Hyo Jin, Jin Hee, Song Ah, right?

706
00:52:49,870 --> 00:52:51,050
Yes.

707
00:52:51,050 --> 00:52:53,010
Guys!

708
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:04,750
It's better than just us two. He'll be helpful somehow.

709
00:53:12,010 --> 00:53:13,330
So...

710
00:53:13,330 --> 00:53:16,880
you need my help so desperately?

711
00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:21,580
Let's see.

712
00:53:21,580 --> 00:53:26,050
First off, my Eun Bi is going to debut soon.

713
00:53:26,050 --> 00:53:29,160
She has no reason to have dark thoughts.

714
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:31,340
And Kang Seo Young...

715
00:53:31,340 --> 00:53:33,900
 Kang Seo Young! Kang Seo Young! 

716
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:36,350
 Kang Seo Young! 

717
00:53:36,350 --> 00:53:39,660
 Kang Seo Young! Kang Seo Young! 

718
00:53:41,710 --> 00:53:43,350
Wow.

719
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:49,350
 - Kang Seo Young!  
 - It can't be her.

720
00:53:49,350 --> 00:53:52,030
She could kill someone, but she would never kill herself.

721
00:53:52,030 --> 00:53:54,830
 Kang Seo Young! Kang Seo Young! 

722
00:53:54,830 --> 00:53:57,510
 Kang Seo Young! Kang Seo Young! 

723
00:53:57,510 --> 00:54:00,680
 Kang Seo Young! Kang Seo Young! 

724
00:54:10,190 --> 00:54:11,470
   

725
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:20,640
Well.

726
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:23,670
My dear teachers, you're all working so hard.

727
00:54:24,350 --> 00:54:27,590
Why are you all out here?

728
00:54:27,590 --> 00:54:30,290
Congratulations on your award, Director Gu.

729
00:54:30,290 --> 00:54:32,400
I hope the event went well.

730
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:35,950
I received an award and a warning at the same time.

731
00:54:35,950 --> 00:54:38,710
It was a great experience.

732
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:44,860
Well, that student is always trouble.

733
00:54:44,860 --> 00:54:49,900
She filed a civil complaint to the Ministry of Education and Ministry of Employment and Labor—

734
00:54:51,770 --> 00:54:53,490
It must've been uncomfortable to receive the award.

735
00:54:53,490 --> 00:54:56,730
We are late on taking measures, but we are making sure it doesn't spread.

736
00:54:56,730 --> 00:55:01,620
More than that, isn't that more heartbreaking

737
00:55:01,620 --> 00:55:04,520
that a student would file such a complaint?

738
00:55:08,250 --> 00:55:11,310
Oh, yes. Of course.

739
00:55:15,820 --> 00:55:17,520
Come inside.

740
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:26,490
So are these ten all at school right now?

741
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:29,030
I think we have to make sure of that first.

742
00:55:29,030 --> 00:55:31,390
Right. Then let's divide it up like this and investigate.

743
00:55:31,390 --> 00:55:35,460
Investigating isn't enough to solve the problem.

744
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:36,700
Then what do we do?

745
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:39,260
We can't ask them outright.

746
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:44,730
There's something else we could do.

747
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:55,100
Well, by chance...

748
00:55:55,100 --> 00:55:58,020
do you like me?

749
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:02,390
No.

750
00:56:02,390 --> 00:56:04,510
Why do you think that?

751
00:56:04,510 --> 00:56:07,570
You smiled at me that one time.

752
00:56:07,570 --> 00:56:09,220
Yesterday...

753
00:56:09,220 --> 00:56:12,780
And during PE, when I did the high jump, you smiled.

754
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:15,440
You smiled because of me...

755
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:22,640
 What are you doing? 

756
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:30,430
I was... laughing at you.

757
00:56:37,470 --> 00:56:39,690
Lee Jae Hee isn't it.

758
00:56:41,130 --> 00:56:43,030
Cheer up, Ki Joon.

759
00:56:48,250 --> 00:56:51,550
But I don't think this is the right way.

760
00:56:51,550 --> 00:56:53,620
Hey, it's only a couple of people.

761
00:56:53,620 --> 00:56:56,050
Do you have a better idea?

762
00:56:59,670 --> 00:57:01,180
Ji Won is right.

763
00:57:01,180 --> 00:57:03,650
Let's cheer up. Fighting!

764
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:07,640
I can't cheer up...

765
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:09,840
because of you.

766
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:13,450
You little...

767
00:57:13,450 --> 00:57:16,340
   

768
00:57:18,710 --> 00:57:20,180
What?

769
00:57:20,180 --> 00:57:23,000
He's asking me if I like him.

770
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,030
He must be crazy.

771
00:57:31,390 --> 00:57:32,830
Do you know Gong Ki Joon by any chance?

772
00:57:32,830 --> 00:57:34,630
- Do you know Gong Ki Joon? 
 - What?

773
00:57:34,630 --> 00:57:36,190
Yes.

774
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:38,090
What?

775
00:57:38,090 --> 00:57:39,380
Do you like Gong Ki Joon?

776
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:41,840
- No. 
 - No!

777
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:43,560
Okay, keep doing what you're doing.

778
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:45,950
I have a boyfriend.

779
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:52,780
Hey, you.

780
00:57:52,780 --> 00:57:54,950
Excuse me. Excuse me.

781
00:57:54,950 --> 00:57:55,980
Do you like me?

782
00:57:55,980 --> 00:57:57,260
You don't like me, do you?

783
00:57:57,260 --> 00:57:59,940
Do you like me? Do you like me?

784
00:58:06,110 --> 00:58:09,400
Do you perhaps like me?

785
00:58:16,190 --> 00:58:18,370
I guess it doesn't count.

786
00:58:23,710 --> 00:58:28,620
The tile techniques class students won first place in the competition again.

787
00:58:28,620 --> 00:58:30,300
And also,

788
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:33,190
four major corporations, including Na Cheol Constructions,

789
00:58:33,190 --> 00:58:39,630
contacted us saying they want to hire our students for an apprenticeship...

790
00:58:44,030 --> 00:58:47,870
What class and year is that Jin Ji Won student in?

791
00:58:47,870 --> 00:58:49,440
Oh, yes.

792
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:52,330
She's in 11th grade, class 1.

793
00:58:52,330 --> 00:58:54,350
Can I see her records?

794
00:58:54,350 --> 00:58:55,920
Yes.

795
00:59:16,090 --> 00:59:18,460
Eleventh grade, class 1.

796
00:59:27,210 --> 00:59:29,620
Geez, you startled me.

797
00:59:29,620 --> 00:59:32,450
What? Do you have something to say?

798
00:59:32,450 --> 00:59:35,880
Oh, that's not it...

799
00:59:37,910 --> 00:59:40,110
- Gong Ki Joon says he likes you. 
 - What?

800
00:59:40,110 --> 00:59:42,060
- What? 
 - What?

801
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:45,190
Why Gong Ki Joon?

802
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:48,990
Tell him I'm not interested.

803
00:59:50,460 --> 00:59:52,910
Actually...

804
00:59:52,910 --> 00:59:55,210
do you remember this?

805
00:59:55,210 --> 00:59:57,610
It was really popular at our elementary school.

806
00:59:57,610 --> 00:59:59,600
You used it a lot, so other children copied you.

807
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:01,450
Yes, I remember.

808
01:00:01,450 --> 01:00:03,420
I haven't seen this in a while,

809
01:00:03,420 --> 01:00:06,020
but it wasn't just the children at our school who used it.

810
01:00:06,020 --> 01:00:08,520
The one who came up with it was from another school.

811
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:10,340
Really? Who was it?

812
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:12,480
She's in our class.

813
01:00:13,270 --> 01:00:15,710
You know, that girl who doesn't talk a lot.

814
01:00:15,710 --> 01:00:17,160
What's her name again?

815
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:20,070
We went to an art academy together in elementary school.

816
01:00:20,070 --> 01:00:22,530
She's close to you, too.

817
01:00:23,790 --> 01:00:25,980
Oh, right, Min Seo!

818
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:28,710
What?

819
01:00:30,650 --> 01:00:33,450
- Min Seo? 
 - Yes.

820
01:00:46,820 --> 01:00:51,390
Goodness, you're having so much fun with it.

821
01:00:53,380 --> 01:00:54,520
Let's sit.

822
01:00:59,220 --> 01:01:02,170
All of them said no.

823
01:02:02,790 --> 01:02:06,140
   

824
01:02:08,030 --> 01:02:09,820
 Ji Won, what's wrong? 

825
01:02:09,820 --> 01:02:12,060
 I can't take it anymore. 

826
01:02:13,380 --> 01:02:16,080
 What is it? Did something happen? 

827
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:18,040
 It's nothing. 

828
01:02:19,150 --> 01:02:22,950
 Min Seo looks tired. 

829
01:02:22,950 --> 01:02:26,940
 Tell me if anything happens to you. I'll take your side no matter what. 

830
01:02:26,940 --> 01:02:28,520
 Okay. 

831
01:02:31,310 --> 01:02:33,290
No.

832
01:03:23,390 --> 01:03:30,470


833
01:03:30,470 --> 01:03:34,780
♫  Dream on, dream on  ♫

834
01:03:34,780 --> 01:03:37,490
♫  Dream on  ♫

835
01:03:38,810 --> 01:03:43,020
♫  Dream on, dream on  ♫

836
01:03:43,020 --> 01:03:46,070
♫  Dream on  ♫

837
01:03:46,070 --> 01:03:51,850
♫  My heart keeps thinking of you  ♫

838
01:03:51,850 --> 01:03:55,060
   

839
01:03:55,060 --> 01:03:56,910
 I thought I knew her well. 

840
01:03:56,910 --> 01:03:58,900
 Not even friends know everything about each other. 

841
01:03:58,900 --> 01:04:01,580
 Jung Min Seo! 

842
01:04:03,180 --> 01:04:05,590
 Even if it doesn't seem like a big deal to adults, 

843
01:04:05,590 --> 01:04:07,760
 it feels like there's no escape for them. 

844
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:09,990
 I will press criminal charges. 

845
01:04:09,990 --> 01:04:11,770
 Did you meet him at school? 

846
01:04:11,770 --> 01:04:13,990
 Don't you understand me when I say live quietly? 

847
01:04:13,990 --> 01:04:16,190
 - What do you want me to do? 
 - Let's make a deal. 

848
01:04:16,190 --> 01:04:18,390
 - Are you running away? 
 - I'll see. 

849
01:04:18,390 --> 01:04:20,670
 But is it true? 

850
01:04:20,670 --> 01:04:23,260
 I can't believe it. 

851
01:04:23,260 --> 01:04:27,310
♫  The afternoon sun shimmers on the windowsill  ♫
