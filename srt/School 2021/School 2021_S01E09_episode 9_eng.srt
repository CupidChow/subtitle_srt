2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,150
   

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,950
   

4
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,830
   

5
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:17,060
   

6
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:21,180
   

7
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:33,760

 Timing and Subtitles by the ðŸŽ¶ Sing for a dream ðŸŽ¤ Team @ viki 

9
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,570
 Why did you want to see me? 

10
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:48,940
 Hey. What's up with you? 

11
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:51,270
 I thought you were fake-dating Seo Young. 

12
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:53,460
 Is it really fake? 

13
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,000
 Yes. 

14
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:59,300
 We have our reasons, so we decided to keep it this way for a while. 

15
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,590
 What reasons? 

16
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:02,740
 How long will it go on for? 

17
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:04,720
 Why do you need to know? 

18
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,360
 Feelings shouldn't be taken lightly. 

19
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,180
 Isn't it cowardly to hide behind things like 

20
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:12,980
 agreements and friendships? 

21
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:17,700
 If you're going to commit, do it properly. 

22
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:22,840
 If anyone toys with Seo Young's heart, 

23
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,580
 I'll chase them to the end of the world to get my revenge. 

24
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:33,420
 I will. 

25
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,370
 Do you promise? I'll trust you. 

26
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:40,900
 Hey, you're really good at everything! 

27
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:57,450
Hey.

28
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,630
Can I see you for a second?

29
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,570
I have something to say to you.

30
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,480
Is something going on?

31
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,890
   

32
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:36,390
Hey.

33
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:43,100
I think...

34
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,550
I like you.

35
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:55,500
I think...

36
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,310
we should end this.

37
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:15,080
What?

38
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:24,330
 Why isn't he saying anything? 

39
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:28,750
Well...

40
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:31,010
I...

41
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:32,990
I don't really...

42
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:38,390
 "I don't really"? 

43
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:42,560
Ji Won! Are you on the rooftop? I'm in a rush!

44
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,900
What is it?

45
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,450
Buy me some eggs!

46
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:47,700
Okay!

47
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,950
Dad told me to go buy some eggs.

48
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:52,380
Hey, but...

49
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:53,890
Let's talk later.

50
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:56,030
I'm going downstairs.

51
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:09,390
I couldn't breathe.

52
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:11,410
"End this"?

53
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:14,590
- End what? 
 - Our fake dating.

54
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,230
Okay.

55
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:22,740
Let's do that.

56
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:26,210
The competition has ended anyway,

57
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:29,770
and Director Gu found out that you threw the flowerpot, right?

58
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:32,480
There's no reason to continue the deal.

59
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:36,190
- It's not thatâ€” 
 - It's fine.

60
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:41,890
I don't think I have to hear any other reason.

61
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:46,230
Okay.

62
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,850
You can tell everyone that you dumped me.

63
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:52,240
What does it matter?

64
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,490
Let them think whatever they want.

65
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:59,220
If you've said what you had to say, I'll go.

66
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,510
By the way...

67
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:07,790
Stop by for dinner on your way to work.

68
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:10,930
That's weird.

69
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:14,180
Why does it feel like you're consoling me?

70
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,550
No, I'm not.

71
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,330
I'm leaving.

72
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:43,940
 I think I like you. 

73
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,360
 Well... 

74
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,960
 I... 

75
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,280
 I don't really... 

76
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:53,380
 Isn't it more natural to start with "I also"? 

77
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:55,880
 What does he mean by "I don't really"? 

78
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:59,640
 "I don't really"... I like you? 

79
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:02,560
 That's a weird sentence. 

80
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,010
 "I don't really"... 

81
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,750
 "I don't really"? 

82
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:16,080
 I don't really... 

83
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:19,980
 like you like that. 

84
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,750
 Didn't you know? 

85
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:24,720
 Why are you suddenly confessing? 

86
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,350
 Goodness. 

87
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:28,250
 Your mom is going to scold you. 

88
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:42,490
 I was rejected. 

89
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:45,850
 I was definitely rejected. 

90
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:48,510
 Geez! This is so embarrassing! 

91
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:59,860
Be sure to tell your grandfather the topping doesn't look nice as I didn't have eggs.

92
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,180
Okay.

93
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:06,210
Is Ji Won getting the eggs from a chicken? Where is she?

94
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:07,990
Good morning!

95
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:09,520
You seem to be in a good mood.

96
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,270
I wonder if something good happened.

97
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:14,090
Nothing happened.

98
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:15,720
Really?

99
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,390
Why are you walking to school alone today? What about Young Joo?

100
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:23,880
Did Young Joo say anything?

101
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:27,080
"Forget about the deal. I want to date you for real!"

102
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,020
Something like that?

103
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:30,410
What are you talking about?

104
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:32,530
I gave him a piece of my mind.

105
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:35,480
I told him not to hide behind a fake relationship like a coward,

106
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,180
and that if you're going to commit, just do it.

107
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:40,160
I told him bluntly.

108
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:43,470
- How concise of you. 
 - Right?

109
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:45,420
- What did he say? 
 - He said we should end it.

110
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:46,830
What?

111
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,250
We broke up.

112
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:59,770
   

113
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:01,360
So it's real.

114
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,480
I told you. I heard they walked here separately this morning.

115
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,060
Really?

116
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,050
Hey, hey.

117
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:13,860
I wonder who dumped whom.

118
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:17,200
Guys, it's Seo Young.

119
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:21,560
- The female lead is here. 
 - Okay.

120
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:25,190
Hey. It's obvious. It's Kang Seo Young.

121
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:27,620
Honestly, would Jung Young Joo dump anyone?

122
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:29,080
That's true.

123
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,640
She didn't even blink when the class president of Haesung High

124
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:35,330
or an idol trainee asked her out.

125
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:37,990
Oh, there's the taekwondo club leader, too.

126
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:40,260
Why are you adding him to the list?

127
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,800
Young Joo's a pretty good guy, right?

128
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,020
That's what I'm saying.

129
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:47,870
She dated him for a while because he seemed all right, then she dumped him.

130
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,430
Poor him.

131
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:54,930
I suddenly feel so bad for Jung Young Joo.

132
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:58,280
The male lead is here.

133
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:01,980
He looks down.

134
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:04,070
It's fine. It's fine. It all passes.

135
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:06,740
Time heals everything.

136
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,460
He doesn't look good.

137
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:12,570
Why did she come so early if all she was going to do is sleep?

138
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:16,930
Hey, Jin Ji Won. Stop sleeping.

139
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:22,580
What? Is it time for class?

140
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,560
First period has ended already.

141
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,110
Really?

142
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:31,050
Gosh. I got here too early and I'm so out of it.

143
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:36,350
This won't work. I'm going to go splash water on my face.

144
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:38,350
See you.

145
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,860
Hey.

146
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,390
What? What is it?

147
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:39,730
You had this stuck on you.

148
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:06,680
Hey.

149
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:09,880
I heard you dumped Seo Young.

150
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,160
You told me to commit.

151
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,730
That's not what I meant.

152
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:15,250
Then what?

153
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:17,400
I...

154
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,220
I meant that you should commit to the relationship.

155
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,690
What are you talking about?

156
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:26,470
Seo Young and I don't like each other. We just pretended to date.

157
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:28,540
I thought you knew.

158
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:31,360
Don't make me laugh.

159
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,720
You're always coming and going with Seo Young.

160
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,950
You eat with her. Joined the same club as her.

161
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:38,500
Is that  all just a part of the deal?

162
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,640
It was.

163
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,510
I see.

164
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:46,900
Why doesn't it look that way to me?

165
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:53,700
Think carefully about how you felt when you spent time with Seo Young.

166
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:57,770
You probably didn't see it, but I saw the look in both of your eyes.

167
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,350
Mark my words

168
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:04,890
and don't regret it later.

169
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:16,790
   

170
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:20,040
Kang Seo Young...

171
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,680
It looks like the shock weighs heavy on her.

172
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,740
Everyone feels bad for Young Joo.

173
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:30,650
We think Seo Young dumped him in cold blood.

174
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:32,200
Don't discuss what you don't know.

175
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,910
Look.

176
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:40,010
Seo Young's ponytail is tilted to the left about three centimeters, right?

177
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:41,410
What?

178
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:46,110
That means her inner wounds are pretty big.

179
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:08,130
 Look. See how Seo Young's chewing really slowly? 

180
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:11,040
 It means she's completely disheveled. 

181
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,500
 I'm not sure. I can't tell. 

182
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:23,260
Look at her.

183
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,400
We're doomed. It's a blue pen.

184
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,500
Why?

185
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:51,260
Only using a blue pen means she's been shaken to her roots.

186
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:53,420
All right, Eun Bi.

187
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:56,780
I think you're wrong. Really wrong. Definitely wrong.

188
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:58,870
She looks fine.

189
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:12,820
â™«  I don't know where I'm headed to again  â™«

190
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:20,250
â™«  The bus is full of people  â™«

191
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:30,480
â™«  When I walk past the familiar street and arrive at my house  â™«

192
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:36,560
â™«  I see you turning around like you're hiding from me  â™«

193
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:43,780
â™«  Spaced out crouched in your room alone  â™«

194
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:50,630
â™«  Staring into the phone screen  â™«

195
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:57,490
â™«  The fact we liked each other just yesterday  â™«

196
00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:07,310
â™«  Suddenly makes me sad and tears well in my eyes  â™«

197
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,310
Aigoo.

198
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:18,750
I was surprised that you reached out to me first.

199
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:21,050
I've been meaning to give you a call.

200
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:22,190
I see.

201
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:26,140
But Cheol Joo kept telling me not to.

202
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:28,450
It's just that...

203
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:33,010
I think I should just know how things are going.

204
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:35,800
Sure. I bet you know the general story,

205
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:39,700
but as of now, we're in the middle of the second-lawsuit trial against Sang Rim Housing.

206
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:43,420
The main point is that the maintenance lift carrying Cheol Joo was unstable,

207
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:48,260
and we need to prove that this is the reason for Cheol Joo's accident.

208
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:51,440
But there is almost zero relevant evidence.

209
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,490
Before I quit,

210
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:56,310
I definitely passed on all the information to my successor.

211
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:58,010
I told him there was a problem with the maintenance lift.

212
00:16:58,010 --> 00:17:02,290
It looks like Sang Rim has already pulled some strings.

213
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:05,280
There isn't much time until the final hearing.

214
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,110
We are at a significant disadvantage.

215
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:10,070
If I...

216
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:13,460
happen to stand as a witness, even though

217
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:16,720
I wasn't the managing supervisor then,

218
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,940
would it help the trial's outcome?

219
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:21,900
Of course. It would be a tremendous help.

220
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:25,240
It would be even better if you had evidence to support our argument.

221
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:30,900
But Cheol Joo's concern is valid.

222
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:36,960
It will become difficult for you to work at your school going forward.

223
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,430
You know that your school's director and the on-site manager of Sang Rim Housing

224
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:44,970
are siblings, right?

225
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:46,630
What?

226
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:50,150
 It's not just the on-site manager Gu Byeong Chul. 

227
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:55,150
 It turns out they have a lot of relatives throughout Sang Rim. 

228
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:59,020
 And the CEO of Sang Rim, Sin Eul Seop, is sick and bedridden. 

229
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:02,730
 As of now, his son holds the authority, 

230
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:07,300
 but I hear this man hates disturbances under his management. 

231
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:11,460
 So Director Gu wants to win this trial no matter what 

232
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:16,110
 and  keep her brother and her husband in their positions. 

233
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:23,140
Dad, why are you sighing?

234
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:26,020
- Do you have a worry? 
 - Oh?

235
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:27,990
It's nothing.

236
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:35,780
Ah Reum. Do you like that I'm a teacher?

237
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:37,440
- Yes! 
 - Why?

238
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,850
When I tell the other children that my mom and dad are both teachers,

239
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:44,690
they say, "Wow!"

240
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,700
What a great job.

241
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:23,160
 I... I don't really... 

242
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:19,010
Are you being like this because of the noise from upstairs?

243
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,500
- What? 
 - Wow, you really are impossible.

244
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,890
Even if you are on bad terms with Ki Joon,

245
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,850
I can't believe you'd complain about this.

246
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:28,870
How can you be so heartless?

247
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:31,510
It's not like that.

248
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:32,970
What is going on with you?

249
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:35,040
I think I'm too stressed.

250
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,290
My shoulder is super tense.

251
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:38,900
That feels good.

252
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,510
Want to try? It will reduce the swelling in your face.

253
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:45,300
What are you talking about? I'm not puffy.

254
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:47,050
Give that here.

255
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:49,350
Gosh.

256
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:58,460
Unni, you know what?

257
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,160
It's about my friend.

258
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,430
Okay, whatever you say.

259
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:03,390
I mean it.

260
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:08,110
Anyway... apparently, she suddenly confessed

261
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:10,370
to a guy who is her friend,

262
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:13,980
but she thinks she was rejected.

263
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,960
She said it sounded like a rejection.

264
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,630
- So? 
 - So...

265
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:25,350
My friend has two different ideas on how to treat him from now on.

266
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:27,870
- Aigoo. 
 - The first option.

267
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:31,710
She'll just stay friends with him as if nothing happened.

268
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:32,890
The second option...

269
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:34,190
"Am I not good enough for you?"

270
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:36,010
"I know you had feelings for me, too."

271
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:38,940
"Why are you backing down now like a coward?"

272
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:42,160
She will tell him frankly like that.

273
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:47,120
The first method is a terrible idea.

274
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:50,400
The second one is...

275
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:53,150
the worst idea ever.

276
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:55,280
What is that supposed to mean?

277
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,010
Aigoo. You've been single all your life.

278
00:21:58,010 --> 00:22:00,810
You were rejected after confessing and didn't plan ahead.

279
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:01,950
That's not it!

280
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:03,400
You're wrong.

281
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,180
Seriously. You're no help.

282
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,900
Gosh. She denies it too fiercely.

283
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:35,600
Oh, gosh!

284
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:40,400
What? Did you see something you shouldn't have?

285
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,770
Why do you keep avoiding me?

286
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:46,150
When did I?

287
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:49,990
I go to school early since I began waking up early. So what?

288
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:52,080
We need to talk.

289
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,750
About what?

290
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:57,320
What you said on the rooftop last time.

291
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,360
Did you mean it?

292
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,880
Pardon?

293
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,670
I... well...

294
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:06,930
Wh-What did I say again?

295
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:10,920
Oh. Oh! That thing?

296
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:14,270
Hey. Were you thinking about that all this time?

297
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:16,820
What in the world! I was joking. Joking.

298
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:18,120
It was complete nonsense.

299
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,820
You know I've been a prankster since I was young.

300
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:22,970
This is hilarious!

301
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:26,420
You?

302
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:30,840
- What are you talking about? 
 - Just say that I amâ€”

303
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:35,040
Anyway. You needn't worry about that. Got it?

304
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,290
Oh, look, we're going to be late for school.

305
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:40,380
- I'm going first. 
 - You... don't have a watch.

306
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,850
It's okay, that wasn't awkward. Good, good.

307
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:52,650
What does she mean by "late"?

308
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:11,540
With you two, who confessed first?

309
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:13,620
- Neither of us. 
 - What?

310
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,230
Are you guys just friends?

311
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:18,490
Of course not.

312
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:22,150
Eun Bi is not simply a classmate just because we didn't confess to each other.

313
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,100
Can you differentiate between the two?

314
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,120
Of course!

315
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:29,680
Eun Bi is completely different.

316
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:34,110
If you're lying on your back, your side, sitting, standing,

317
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:36,780
and you think about her, whatever you're doing,

318
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,550
then that's for real.

319
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:44,680
Oh, Eun Bi!

320
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,010
Really?

321
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:48,080
Hey. I'm leaving.

322
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,470
Eun Bi, that's great!

323
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:52,450
See, I told you! I told you your dance was unique.

324
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:54,800
 I knew something good would happen... 

325
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:01,920
Are you sure Mirror Entertainment contacted you?

326
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:04,540
They don't seem to have a website. Is it a small company?

327
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:06,480
We will find out when we get there.

328
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,700
See?

329
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,680
I said you would get a call.

330
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:12,040
It's all thanks to you. I admit it.

331
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:16,680
If it weren't for you, I wouldn't even have thought to upload a dance cover video.

332
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:20,120
My goodness! You're so precious.

333
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:24,320
From now on, I'll take care of my skin and go to bed early.

334
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,830
I'm really going to do well this time.

335
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:28,700
I'll help you all that I can.

336
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,650
- Just trust your manager. 
 - Okay.

337
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:32,570
- Okay. 
 - Okay.

338
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:47,110
Are you really closing the Architectural Department?

339
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:50,320
Don't focus on the closure.

340
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,720
We must focus on building a new department.

341
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:56,410
CEO Sin Eul Seop was a carpenter in the first place.

342
00:25:56,410 --> 00:26:00,230
He built our Nulji High for the purpose of fostering young carpenters.

343
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:05,780
The Architectural Department is the basis of our foundation and the reason for its existence.

344
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:07,330
Principal Oh,

345
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:11,730
I know well what you mean.

346
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:14,360
It also pains me,

347
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:18,030
but we must think of the children first.

348
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:23,610
To enable our children to grow more competitively and to fit with the changing times,

349
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:25,870
I am ready to do worse.

350
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:31,100
Still, you can take your time to think about closing a department

351
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:33,810
while building a new department.

352
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:37,090
Funds from the Ministry of Education are limited.

353
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:39,180
That would be impossible.

354
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:45,120
And you know well that the Architectural Department has the lowest number of new students.

355
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:51,210
This proposal is to submit to the Ministry of Education for department reformation.

356
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:54,600
Please look it over. And when the time comes,

357
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:57,640
please approve it as soon as possible.

358
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:02,860
Why so suddenly?

359
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:05,580
I heard it when having lunch with Hyun Mi from Administration.

360
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:09,850
They're creating Drone and Animal Care departments next year.

361
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:12,730
This is so unexpected.

362
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:17,200
A few days ago, my friend's sunbae said that he was appointed as our school's new drone teacher

363
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,660
and I laughed at him.

364
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:22,040
I said, "We don't even have a Drone Department. What nonsense."

365
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,720
Now it looks like I was the one spouting nonsense.

366
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,390
Have they already appointed a teacher before establishing a department?

367
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:29,920
It's not just that.

368
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:33,370
They said that unpopular departments would be closed or integrated.

369
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,490
Excuse me.

370
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:37,670
Do you mean this department could disappear?

371
00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:38,820
Yes.

372
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:42,390
You know the number of new students in our department decreases each year, right?

373
00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:44,780
No, I didn't know.

374
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:47,020
Reformation of a department isn't child's play.

375
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:48,450
How can it be so easy?

376
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:51,090
Is anything hard for Director Gu?

377
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:52,080
That's true.

378
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,900
There are things she started then abandoned, but there's nothing she can't accomplish.

379
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:57,640
It's scary.

380
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:06,430
Then in the end, she will claim it was all for the students.

381
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:17,460
I'm flabbergasted.

382
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:20,440
What about the teachers and students?

383
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,660
Seriously.

384
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:24,230
I'm sure they'll let the current students graduate.

385
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:26,440
But there won't be any more support of any kind.

386
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:29,570
Why would they care about a department that's going to be discarded?

387
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:33,610
This school always does whatever it wants, past and present.

388
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:35,480
Past?

389
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,490
Do you know...

390
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:41,600
Cheol Joo? He's a graduate of this school.

391
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,630
How do you know Cheol Joo?

392
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:47,770
I saw him a few times as an apprentice when I was on-site at Sang Rim.

393
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:50,330
But after I moved locations, he got into an accident.

394
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:54,100
He reached out to me, so I met him. He is in a wheelchair.

395
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:57,910
That was the first accident we had after I came to this school.

396
00:28:57,910 --> 00:28:59,840
He wasn't in my class,

397
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,460
but I knew that it had happened.

398
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:04,890
Then...

399
00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:08,050
Did you know that Young Joo, in your class, is Cheol Joo's younger brother?

400
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:09,380
Young Joo?

401
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:11,110
I guess you didn't know.

402
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:12,460
Then did you know this?

403
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:15,430
The on-site manager at Sang Rim Housing, where Cheol Joo had his accident,

404
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:17,690
is the brother of our school's Director Gu.

405
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:20,440
By chance, are you talking about Gu Byeong Chul?

406
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,460
Did you know this?

407
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:24,430
I didn't know.

408
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:26,630
Recently, my class had a suicide-note incident,

409
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:28,230
- Min Seo. 
 - I know.

410
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:31,690
That incident was also because of Gu Byeong Chul.

411
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:33,400
Really?

412
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:38,350
This is really absurd.

413
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:40,700
There is a lot that I don't know.

414
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:47,620
How do you know so much about the students?

415
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:48,970
Pardon?

416
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:53,420
I don't know that much...

417
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:55,790
I just heard some things.

418
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:01,220
My students are waiting. I'm going to be late. I have to go.

419
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:14,740
   

420
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:19,830
Okay. The most important part of a project is the intention.

421
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:24,540
What I mean by that is the reason that Baro Furniture is doing this project.

422
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:32,580
Contribution to the local community and

423
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:36,850
done by high school students.

424
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:40,050
So it has to be a work that is simple enough.

425
00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:41,840
But...

426
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,940
this... this...

427
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:48,770
this... this...

428
00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:52,450
They are a bit over the top, don't you think?

429
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:54,720
He erased all three of mine.

430
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,320
He erased my mini bathtub too.

431
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,600
That's right. Let's think better.

432
00:31:00,810 --> 00:31:02,580
Next, Jin Ji Won?

433
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:04,250
Okay.

434
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:06,060
Fighting.

435
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:22,830
Wow. She's amazing.

436
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:29,640
So I call my item "the transforming stool."

437
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:32,940
If you fold it here, it becomes a stool.

438
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:35,180
And when you need to reach a higher place,

439
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:38,140
it becomes a ladder once you expand it.

440
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:39,850
A question...

441
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:43,220
Who is it for?

442
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:47,310
- Sorry? 
 - Like I said earlier,

443
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:49,590
"contribution to the local community."

444
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:52,240
Who is it for, and why do they need it?

445
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,290
The storytelling aspect is the key to this project.

446
00:31:57,610 --> 00:31:59,150
I'm not sure.

447
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:04,520
Well, wouldn't it be nice for anyone to have it?

448
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:10,150
All right.

449
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:12,220
That's good for now.

450
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:15,810
Lastly, Gong Ki Joon.

451
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:17,960
What?

452
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,670
Come up here.

453
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:33,590
I haven't really prepared anything.

454
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,820
How about this?

455
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:46,810
Well...

456
00:32:46,810 --> 00:32:49,980
It could look roughly like this.

457
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:55,240
When you put your phone here, the sound gets amplified. It's like a no-energy speaker*. 
  (TN: A resonating chamber) 

458
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:58,530
Well it wouldn't be difficult to make.

459
00:32:58,530 --> 00:33:01,430
My grandfather is a security guard at an apartment complex.

460
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:03,250
When he gets tired at work,

461
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:07,740
he watches trot videos on his phone and listens to the radio.

462
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:10,090
But when his phone is far away from him,

463
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:15,000
he hunches over to get closer because he can't hear well.

464
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,160
I wanted to help him hear better and

465
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:22,200
watch videos with a more comfortable posture.

466
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:25,650
Yes. This is what I'm talking about.

467
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:27,120
It sounds great to me.

468
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:30,580
But isn't it too simple?

469
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:34,380
There are teams from other schools, and this is a competition, after all.

470
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:38,430
Isn't it better to choose something that displays our carpentry skills?

471
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:45,310
I think the project is more about storytelling than skills.

472
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:47,750
What does everyone else think?

473
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:50,490
It doesn't sound bad.

474
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:54,850
Okay.

475
00:33:54,850 --> 00:34:00,720
Fine. Then you should all look for references about this type of amplifier.

476
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:04,460
We can work on the blueprint and submit the proposal.

477
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:07,260
Okay.

478
00:34:10,410 --> 00:34:12,880
Aren't you upset your idea wasn't selected?

479
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,730
You worked hard on that.

480
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:16,600
Well, a little bit?

481
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:19,180
I liked your idea.

482
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:22,100
I wanted to try making it. It's a shame.

483
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,180
Really?

484
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:25,080
Do you want to make it? Let's do it.

485
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:29,220
Let's make it and present it as a sample for the next idea.

486
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:32,710
- Make it together? 
 - Yes. You said you wanted to make it too.

487
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:34,340
Okay.

488
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:38,070
Let's go right now. There's a ton of wood at my house.

489
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:41,520
- Are we making it at your house? 
 - Sure.

490
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,780
Ji Won's rooftop is almost a workshop.

491
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:44,730
Haven't you been there?

492
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:47,330
- Well... 
 - Young Joo's been there.

493
00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:49,700
Itâ€™ll look weird if they all make speakers at school,

494
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:52,460
and we make a stool on our own.

495
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:55,310
Choose a piece of wood you like best from our house.

496
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:57,380
- Min Seo, are you coming with us? 
 - Me too?

497
00:34:57,380 --> 00:35:00,200
Sorry. I don't think I have time.

498
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,910
I took on more shifts with my part-time job.

499
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:03,530
Darn it.

500
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:05,640
Then you want to work on it by ourselves?

501
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:08,710
- Okay. 
 - Nice. Let's go.

502
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:11,110
That's a shame.

503
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:14,200
- The three of us would be perfect. 
 - For sure...

504
00:35:30,010 --> 00:35:32,140
We'll have to use different types of wood

505
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:35,680
for each of the four legs of the stool.

506
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:41,620
I didn't know we only had scraps left.

507
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:45,430
I must have made a lot of stuff recently. Sorry.

508
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:47,550
You must really like woodwork.

509
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:51,060
I do. I really love it so much.

510
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:53,040
I'll keep loving it.

511
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,450
Don't you like it, too?

512
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,710
I think it's a habit for me.

513
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:04,040
Since I was young, I grew up smelling wood on my dad.

514
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:07,910
But you... You're the real one.

515
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:10,070
What's this?

516
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:13,420
You sound like a brother babying his little sister.

517
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:18,450
- A brother? 
 - What are you doing?

518
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:25,380
Aren't you at work?

519
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:28,990
I had some time left so I came home.

520
00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:31,920
Are you guys making something together?

521
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:36,380
Young Joo said he wanted to build the item I came up with.

522
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:38,740
So we're going to work on it together.

523
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:41,580
Here?

524
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:45,190
Yes. There's nowhere else for us to work.

525
00:36:54,490 --> 00:36:57,330
Why not say "Hi" since you're here?

526
00:36:57,330 --> 00:37:00,640
She's not the only one who lives here. I also live here.

527
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:04,310
Why would I say hello out of the blue?

528
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:14,620
Good luck then.

529
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:16,300
I'm leaving.

530
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:37,280
 Are you guys making something together? 

531
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,520
 Here? 

532
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,980
 There's nowhere else for us to work. 

533
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:42,440
 Good luck then. 

534
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,140
 I'm leaving. 

535
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:55,810
 Was he offended that I was alone with Young Joo? 

536
00:37:56,790 --> 00:37:58,720
 No. 

537
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:01,910
 Why would he be offended? We're all friends. 

538
00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:08,500
 But he looked a little off. 

539
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:18,220
 Why did I confess to him? 

540
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:20,030
 Jin Ji Won! 

541
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:22,040
What?

542
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:25,760
Take this to Ki Joon's.

543
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,680
- What? 
 - It's kimchi.

544
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,810
I don't want to. Never!

545
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:37,600
Is she going through puberty again? What's up with her?

546
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:44,340
Gong Ki Joon.

547
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:57,690
What's up? You want to talk to me first for once.

548
00:38:58,430 --> 00:39:01,380
I need to clear up something.

549
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:02,980
What is it?

550
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:08,160
What's between you and Ji Won?

551
00:39:09,370 --> 00:39:10,900
What?

552
00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:17,710
Well. This was unexpected.

553
00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:20,600
Why are you asking?

554
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:27,570
Do I have to tell you things like that?

555
00:39:27,570 --> 00:39:30,450
We're friends. Just friends.

556
00:39:30,450 --> 00:39:32,270
Is that all?

557
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:35,690
What if it isn't?

558
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:39,870
So you guys aren't dating?

559
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,680
 What in the world! 

560
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:46,460
 I was joking. Joking. It was complete nonsense. 

561
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:50,050
No. We're not.

562
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,530
I got it.

563
00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:54,520
I'm going.

564
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:39,030
This drawing...

565
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:42,950
What are you doing? You must be tired after work.

566
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:45,150
Are you doing homework?

567
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:49,390
We're doing a new project at the carpentry club.

568
00:40:49,970 --> 00:40:51,980
We decided to work on an idea that I suggested.

569
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:56,980
Oh, really? This makes me very proud of my grandson.

570
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:59,160
It's nothing big.

571
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:02,300
But it feels pretty good.

572
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:05,360
Carpentry's fun, isn't it?

573
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:11,950
If you're going to do it, commit to it. Don't waste your time on anything else.

574
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:16,240
Don't take a part-time job until you graduate from 12th Grade.

575
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:19,790
Just focus on schoolwork.

576
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:22,370
I have plenty of time now I don't do taekwondo.

577
00:41:22,370 --> 00:41:25,970
You have to catch up on all the work you missed while doing taekwondo.

578
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:30,510
We don't have to worry too much about the rent here,

579
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:32,090
so I can manage on my own.

580
00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:35,570
Once you settle down with a good job after graduating,

581
00:41:35,570 --> 00:41:39,120
I'm not going to work. I'll just relax.

582
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,680
You're not well, Grandpa.

583
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:42,370
I'm all better now!

584
00:41:42,370 --> 00:41:46,840
The surgery went well. The doctor would be disappointed to hear you say that.

585
00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:49,330
Really.

586
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:52,680
That's good.

587
00:41:57,250 --> 00:42:00,600
What's up with my skin today? This is an important day.

588
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:03,030
I even left my makeup pouch at home.

589
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:04,880
You look pretty to me.

590
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,760
This won't do.

591
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:14,260
I have to do what I must even if I'm busy.

592
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:17,790
Eun Bi!

593
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:25,760
- How does it look? 
 - Looks pretty.

594
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:29,360
Let's get this one. I'll buy it for you as a present.

595
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:31,880
Why? I have it at home.

596
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:37,100
It'd be nice to reapply it just before you go into the audition.

597
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:42,160
I'm looking after you as your manager. Okay?

598
00:42:43,470 --> 00:42:45,570
Wow!

599
00:42:50,850 --> 00:42:53,110
Wow!

600
00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:55,960
Wow, really.

601
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:59,380
You really don't have a talent for drawing.

602
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:05,140
Still, I can see how much you thought about it.

603
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:06,970
I'm proud of you.

604
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:12,170
Yes, I think this would do.

605
00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:13,730
Oh, really?

606
00:43:13,730 --> 00:43:16,630
Yes. How about we add some details?

607
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:21,700
- Add this here... 
 - Oh!

608
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:26,730
If we layer it rather than completely open it up, the sound will spread out...

609
00:43:27,630 --> 00:43:29,310
That's good.

610
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:34,730
This is better. This is how it's done.

611
00:43:34,730 --> 00:43:36,960
Where are you going?

612
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:39,230
The bathroom. Just three minutes.

613
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:42,390
Hey. I can't be late for the first day.

614
00:43:42,390 --> 00:43:44,300
Okay. Then two minutes.

615
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:46,930
Just two minutes, okay, Eun Bi? I'll be right back.

616
00:43:46,930 --> 00:43:49,410
Hey, just two, okay?

617
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:53,820
Seriously, Ji Ho Sung.

618
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:58,120
When is he coming out? I think it's over three minutes now.

619
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:01,520
Eun Bi!

620
00:44:25,410 --> 00:44:27,100
You...

621
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:33,280
I'm going as your manager. It'd be ridiculous to go in my uniform.

622
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:39,350
Shall we, Miss Go?

623
00:44:43,370 --> 00:44:45,890
Have you sent the reformation proposal to the Ministry of Education?

624
00:44:45,890 --> 00:44:50,260
The thing is, the principal still hasn't signed off on it.

625
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:55,270
I'll ask him once more about it today.

626
00:44:55,270 --> 00:44:57,640
Fine, do that.

627
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:02,500
Make sure the teachers and the students don't get agitated.

628
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:07,320
I think the rumor has already spread somewhat among the teachers.

629
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:10,520
Well. That doesn't matter.

630
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:12,370
Oh, another thing...

631
00:45:13,430 --> 00:45:16,750
The drone teacher who visited this morning.

632
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:18,900
Oh, yes.

633
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:21,510
I take it you received it?

634
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,510
The money was less than I thought.

635
00:45:26,510 --> 00:45:27,850
Sorry?

636
00:45:28,830 --> 00:45:30,540
Is that so?

637
00:45:31,730 --> 00:45:33,880
That couldn't be possible.

638
00:45:38,850 --> 00:45:40,670
Teaching Director,

639
00:45:40,670 --> 00:45:43,170
please make sure you check up on it.

640
00:45:44,070 --> 00:45:45,470
Of course.

641
00:45:47,770 --> 00:45:50,650
My husband asked to meet with you.

642
00:45:50,650 --> 00:45:54,340
How's this weekend? Do you have time?

643
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:57,950
Of course. I shall make the time.

644
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:08,700
Gosh, the company is a bit small.

645
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:13,320
It must be because they're new. There are plenty of small agencies like this.

646
00:46:18,230 --> 00:46:20,950
But... I'm very nervous.

647
00:46:20,950 --> 00:46:23,340
Really? Hold on.

648
00:46:23,950 --> 00:46:27,890
Here. Go Eun Bi's special relaxant.

649
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:41,940
Eun Bi. Let's go!

650
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:50,900
Are you her manager? We use our own manager.

651
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:52,560
He's my personal manager.

652
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:55,090
I'll provide the security fee on my own.

653
00:46:55,090 --> 00:46:56,880
You'll have to earn a lot then.

654
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:59,850
Yes, I'm confident.

655
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:02,380
   

656
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:05,680
Five years as a trainee at Tower Entertainment...

657
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:07,100
That's a long time.

658
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:11,320
I expect your singing, dancing, and acting to be all at an acceptable level.

659
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:14,140
Shall we see your dance, then?

660
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:15,590
Of course.

661
00:47:59,060 --> 00:48:00,880
That's enough.

662
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,410
That's good.

663
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:07,060
I think we've seen enough.

664
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:10,060
I prepared a lot. Should I show you something else?

665
00:48:10,060 --> 00:48:11,520
No, that's not necessary.

666
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:15,550
There's a lot we need to touch up on. You'll need a lot of lessons.

667
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:18,180
Lessons?

668
00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:20,990
You know the lesson fee is divided equally between us, right?

669
00:48:20,990 --> 00:48:23,610
This is a big risk for us.

670
00:48:23,610 --> 00:48:26,620
But there are a few promising elements,

671
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:29,290
so I'll try to have you take some lessons.

672
00:48:29,290 --> 00:48:31,020
Please take a look again.

673
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:34,240
I was a trainee in a debut group at Tower Entertainment.

674
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:37,050
Then why didn't you debut there?

675
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:39,690
That little...

676
00:48:39,690 --> 00:48:41,360
What will it be?

677
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:44,070
We have other business we need to attend to.

678
00:48:47,350 --> 00:48:49,120
I'll...

679
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:51,690
take the lessons.

680
00:48:53,410 --> 00:48:55,340
The lesson fees are paid upfront.

681
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:58,910
I'll let you know the amount when the lessons are scheduled.

682
00:48:58,910 --> 00:49:00,950
We'll invest about six months.

683
00:49:00,950 --> 00:49:04,490
If you show potential to change, we'll sign a contract.

684
00:49:04,490 --> 00:49:06,700
- Okay. 
 - Oh, one more thing.

685
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:11,710
We're going to do some work on your eyes, lips, and forehead.

686
00:49:11,710 --> 00:49:14,740
So visit the hospital we connect you toâ€”

687
00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:16,550
Let's go.

688
00:49:16,550 --> 00:49:19,300
- What? 
 - There's no need to listen any further.

689
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:21,290
Let's go.

690
00:49:21,290 --> 00:49:23,640
- What are you doing? 
 - Iâ€”

691
00:49:25,690 --> 00:49:27,620
Come on!

692
00:49:27,620 --> 00:49:29,970
They said they wanted to sign me.

693
00:49:29,970 --> 00:49:34,680
Sign? That means you should get paid. Why are you paying them?

694
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:38,070
This is obviously a scam. You know that better than I do.

695
00:49:38,070 --> 00:49:40,190
There are lots of places like this.

696
00:49:40,190 --> 00:49:43,280
Good trainees receive a huge payment at big companies

697
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:47,020
and train while getting all sorts of support.

698
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:49,920
But I'm not like that.

699
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:53,450
I couldn't be that, so I was kicked out. Right?

700
00:49:53,450 --> 00:49:57,890
That's why I'm better off at places like this. I have to cling to places like this!

701
00:49:57,890 --> 00:50:01,360
- Stop it. 
 - What's it to you? What do you know?

702
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:04,210
Who are you to tell meâ€”

703
00:50:15,810 --> 00:50:17,960
I know...

704
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:22,040
better than anyone that you'll do well.

705
00:50:23,170 --> 00:50:25,750
I'm going to be responsible

706
00:50:25,750 --> 00:50:29,720
and make sure you can train at a better place than this.

707
00:50:47,610 --> 00:50:49,270
I'm home.

708
00:50:49,270 --> 00:50:52,100
Hi, Ji Won. Do you know where Ji Soo is?

709
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:54,790
She said she was going to a concert with her friend.

710
00:50:54,790 --> 00:50:57,670
Says the person who's supposed to study for a civil servant exam.

711
00:50:57,670 --> 00:50:58,860
Why?

712
00:50:58,860 --> 00:51:02,920
Mom forgot to take her anemia pills with her. I don't think she took her morning pills either.

713
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:07,030
I have to go into the office because of an emergency. What do we do?

714
00:51:07,030 --> 00:51:08,750
I'll take them to her.

715
00:51:08,750 --> 00:51:12,720
Will you? Then, don't fight with Mom.

716
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:15,250
I'm not a child. Why would I fight with her?

717
00:51:15,250 --> 00:51:18,190
Hey, Ji Won...

718
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:20,780
Why don't you get changed...

719
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:23,790
I'm going to go.

720
00:51:25,550 --> 00:51:27,770
Don't fight!

721
00:51:27,770 --> 00:51:29,780
   

722
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:37,800
   

723
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:40,670
- Mom. 
 - Oh, my God!

724
00:51:41,340 --> 00:51:43,730
What are you doing here?

725
00:51:43,730 --> 00:51:46,490
Why are you so surprised? Did you see a ghost?

726
00:51:46,490 --> 00:51:48,800
You little...

727
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:51,820
Here. You forgot your pills.

728
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:55,020
You should call if you're going toâ€”

729
00:52:04,190 --> 00:52:09,720
Goodbye. The Nulji High uniform that's scarier than a ghost is going now.

730
00:52:16,430 --> 00:52:18,390
Seo Young?

731
00:52:25,460 --> 00:52:29,980
Are you working at this hour? You're working late.

732
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:34,820
- Is the director your mom? 
 - Yes.

733
00:52:35,380 --> 00:52:37,390
Mom doesn't talk about me, right?

734
00:52:37,390 --> 00:52:39,590
Even when you spoke about Nulji High,

735
00:52:39,590 --> 00:52:43,320
and the Architectural Department, I bet she never said I went there.

736
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:45,650
Is that right?

737
00:52:45,650 --> 00:52:48,620
Yes. She didn't say anything.

738
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:54,530
This is my life. I can't call my mom, Mom.

739
00:52:54,530 --> 00:52:57,310
It's not like I'm Hong Gil Dong.

740
00:52:57,310 --> 00:52:59,870
Is it a sin to go to a specialty school?

741
00:52:59,870 --> 00:53:02,340
I can't understand why she's so worked up about it.

742
00:53:03,940 --> 00:53:05,920
I think I can understand her.

743
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:09,370
A college preparatory academy director's daughter goes to a specialty school...

744
00:53:09,370 --> 00:53:13,150
It's a perfect topic for people who like to gossip.

745
00:53:13,150 --> 00:53:16,410
It could discourage students from coming here.

746
00:53:16,410 --> 00:53:19,020
Oh, yes, I see.

747
00:53:19,990 --> 00:53:25,410
Did you ever think about going to a regular high school and college like your mom wanted?

748
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:30,020
Well... no.

749
00:53:30,020 --> 00:53:33,180
My dream is to be a carpenter. So instead of wasting time in college,

750
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:35,720
it's better to learn the right skills and get on-site quickly.

751
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:41,170
I have no intention of going to college just because that's what everyone else is doing.

752
00:53:41,830 --> 00:53:43,490
That's amazing.

753
00:53:43,490 --> 00:53:47,700
- What about you? Are you preparing for the College Scholastic Ability Test? 
 - Yes.

754
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:52,380
I'm definitely going to go to college like everyone else.

755
00:53:52,940 --> 00:53:55,730
I'll live more mundanely than anyone else.

756
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:03,150
Anyway, if the director pushes you around, just let me know.

757
00:54:03,150 --> 00:54:05,670
I'll avenge you at home.

758
00:54:09,950 --> 00:54:11,230
 - Due today? 

759
00:54:11,230 --> 00:54:14,550
Yes. It's sudden.

760
00:54:14,550 --> 00:54:15,890
Aigoo.

761
00:54:15,890 --> 00:54:19,300
The person in charge needs to present it at the meeting tomorrow morning

762
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:22,770
and she asked me to email the proposal by this evening.

763
00:54:22,770 --> 00:54:28,200
It was so sudden that no one else has time.

764
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:32,280
But... I have to go to work too...

765
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:35,860
I'm not good with CAD. Don't we have to submit a blueprint?

766
00:54:35,860 --> 00:54:39,340
Hey. Then am I supposed to do it?

767
00:54:40,450 --> 00:54:44,280
Jung Young Joo, you're the team leader. Make it work.

768
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:49,530
Ji Won knows how to draw a blueprint. Why don't you ask her?

769
00:54:49,530 --> 00:54:53,480
- Okay. 
 - You shared Ki Joon's sketches, right?

770
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:57,340
You can make one based on those.

771
00:54:57,340 --> 00:55:00,550
And Gong Ki Joon. It was your idea.

772
00:55:00,550 --> 00:55:04,300
So get off work early and join them.

773
00:55:05,150 --> 00:55:06,670
Okay.

774
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:17,280
Really? Oh, thank you.

775
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:19,480
Something came up with our school club.

776
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:22,780
I'll switch shifts with you if something comes up for you.

777
00:55:22,780 --> 00:55:24,610
Okay. Thank you.

778
00:55:24,610 --> 00:55:27,060
Hey, she said yes. Let's do it together.

779
00:55:27,060 --> 00:55:30,350
That's a relief. Should we work in the club room later today?

780
00:55:30,350 --> 00:55:31,880
Okay, sounds good.

781
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:34,520
But I'm really bad at CAD*. 
  (TN: Computer Aided Design software) 

782
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:37,030
- I'm trusting you. 
 - Okay.

783
00:55:47,610 --> 00:55:49,130
Well...

784
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:52,600
- Ji Won. 
 - Yes?

785
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:55,300
Can you help me with this?

786
00:55:55,300 --> 00:55:57,970
It's harder than I thought.

787
00:55:57,970 --> 00:55:59,990
One second.

788
00:55:59,990 --> 00:56:05,080
â™«  Like a petal in spring tinged yellow  â™«

789
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:06,360
Here.

790
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:09,720
â™«  You're so beautiful  â™«

791
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:17,700
â™«  When you approach me and whisper carefully again  â™«

792
00:56:19,210 --> 00:56:28,070
â™«  I think the time I spend with you will be filled with happiness  â™«

793
00:56:28,070 --> 00:56:34,820
â™«  Where are you? Do you know how I feel?  â™«

794
00:56:34,820 --> 00:56:40,490
â™«  A cold wind blows  â™«

795
00:56:40,490 --> 00:56:42,800
You did well.

796
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:47,690
â™«  Will you embrace me gently?  â™«

797
00:56:47,690 --> 00:56:54,220
â™«  Like it was just yesterday  â™«

798
00:56:54,220 --> 00:56:57,520
- Does it look good? 
 - It does.

799
00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:02,300
Oh, but I think it'd be better if you added an explanation here.

800
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:07,360
Okay.

801
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:10,600
- Here? 
 - Yes.

802
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:16,500
â™«  Looking at the end, hug me carefully, will you?  â™«

803
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:19,700
â™«  Oh, my love  â™«

804
00:57:27,350 --> 00:57:28,920
Hey.

805
00:57:31,170 --> 00:57:33,140
Let's take a break.

806
00:57:34,210 --> 00:57:35,980
Should we?

807
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:40,010
I was so focused.

808
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:47,740
- Thank you. 
 - It's all right.

809
00:57:47,740 --> 00:57:49,900
Aigoo.

810
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:56,450
It's the first time being here this late. Right?

811
00:57:57,630 --> 00:58:01,340
I stayed late sometimes.

812
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:06,840
- When I was preparing for the last competition. 
 - Oh, to wait for Seo Young?

813
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:11,160
That's right. Seo Young always stayed behind to work.

814
00:58:16,470 --> 00:58:20,790
- Did I say something I shouldn't have? 
 - What?

815
00:58:22,660 --> 00:58:26,680
No, you're right. You can talk about it.

816
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:35,290
Are you going okay? Have things been tough lately?

817
00:58:36,670 --> 00:58:37,960
What things?

818
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:41,440
You broke up with Seo Young only a few days ago.

819
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:44,320
Hey. Seo Young seems completely fine,

820
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:48,030
so don't take it too hard.

821
00:58:49,830 --> 00:58:52,290
Of course, she's fine.

822
00:58:52,290 --> 00:58:57,060
Seo Young and I weren't in that kind of relationship.

823
00:58:57,060 --> 00:58:59,050
"That kind of relationship"?

824
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:04,430
We weren't dating like you think.

825
00:59:04,430 --> 00:59:08,650
What do you mean? You guys were our school's official couple.

826
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:13,180
The thing is...

827
00:59:15,910 --> 00:59:17,920
Actually...

828
00:59:19,540 --> 00:59:22,730
- We only pretended to date. 
 - What?

829
00:59:22,730 --> 00:59:23,920
But why?

830
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:28,160
We just had our own reasons.

831
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:31,260
Wow. So crazy.

832
00:59:31,260 --> 00:59:34,450
Was it a contract romance like in the movies?

833
00:59:34,450 --> 00:59:39,230
I mean... I wouldn't compare it to movies or anything.

834
00:59:39,230 --> 00:59:41,360
Just something like that.

835
00:59:42,570 --> 00:59:44,700
Then why did it end?

836
00:59:44,700 --> 00:59:47,670
Did you have a contract period?

837
00:59:47,670 --> 00:59:50,860
It wasn't like that.

838
00:59:54,140 --> 00:59:56,590
I thought I should...

839
00:59:57,480 --> 01:00:00,140
quit with fake dating.

840
01:00:00,140 --> 01:00:01,610
Why?

841
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:06,680
Because...

842
01:00:11,150 --> 01:00:13,120
there's someone

843
01:00:14,150 --> 01:00:16,200
that I really,

844
01:00:17,270 --> 01:00:20,070
sincerely want to date.

845
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:25,330
Really?

846
01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:29,370
Wow. Gosh. That's so romantic.

847
01:00:29,370 --> 01:00:32,910
Who is it? Is she in our class? Do I know her?

848
01:00:34,730 --> 01:00:38,250
Hey. I'm really good at keeping secrets.

849
01:00:38,250 --> 01:00:40,750
Who knows? Maybe I'll help you guys get together.

850
01:00:40,750 --> 01:00:43,670
Can't you just tell me? Okay?

851
01:00:48,550 --> 01:00:51,780
I was actually going to tell you.

852
01:00:51,780 --> 01:00:54,220
Really? Who is it?

853
01:00:57,670 --> 01:00:59,080
You.

854
01:01:02,290 --> 01:01:03,730
Pardon?

855
01:01:09,660 --> 01:01:11,370
It's you.

856
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:15,100
You're the person I feel sincerely about.

857
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:25,400

 Do you have a second? 

871
01:02:34,610 --> 01:02:37,400
 It's only been a few days since she said she likes me. 

872
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:41,040
 Make sure you take this with you. Don't be a burden to others. 

873
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:43,370
 I don't think Kang Seo Young cares about him at all. 

874
01:02:43,370 --> 01:02:46,390
 You're Young Joo's girlfriend, right? 

875
01:02:46,390 --> 01:02:49,340
 - You remember back then... 
 - They should be on the old phone. 

876
01:02:49,340 --> 01:02:52,670
 Do you even know how you got a job at our school? 

877
01:02:52,670 --> 01:02:55,350
 Hello? Who is this? 

878
01:02:55,350 --> 01:02:58,380
 I actually went to the woodwork room that day. 

879
01:02:58,380 --> 01:03:01,180
