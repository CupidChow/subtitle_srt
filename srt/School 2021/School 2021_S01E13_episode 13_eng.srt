00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:11,960
   

4
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:15,030
   

5
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:17,100
   

6
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:21,230
   

7
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:34,610
   

8
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,980
 I'm home! 

9
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:42,800
 - Hey... my Ki Joon, you're home. 
 - Grandpa! 

10
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,200
 Aigoo, you precious thing.

12
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:09,670
   

13
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,510
 Let's go. 

14
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,470
â™ª Let's walk, walking down the road â™ª

15
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:32,380
â™ª Walking... â™ª

16
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:53,110
 Ki Joon... 

17
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:55,970
 Gong Ki Joon. 

18
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:09,360
 Ki Joon... 

19
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,270
 You should sleep in your bed. 

20
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:22,570
 Ki Joon. 

21
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,340
 Gong Ki Joon. 

22
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:31,260
 Gong Ki Joon. 

23
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:59,370
   

24
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:33,400
What about Ki Joon's dad?

25
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,830
Can't you reach him?

26
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:39,450
How do you contact a person who hides from debt collectors?

27
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:48,600
I asked Ki Joon earlier. It seems he can't reach him either.

28
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,780
The dad can't even come to his own father's funeral.

29
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:55,730
When he finds out, his whole world will collapse.

30
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:01,800
Ki Joon's mom probably can't come either.

31
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:04,810
Isn't she overseas?

32
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:09,460
She started a new life on the other side of the planet.

33
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:12,690
I'm sure she can't come right away.

34
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:18,370
We should take good care of him.

35
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:19,940
Yes.

36
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,170
Eat a little bit, at least.

37
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:41,830
You need to have energy to see your grandfather off.

38
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,990
Okay.

39
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:46,830
Thank you.

40
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,530
Go.

41
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:26,930
You have school tomorrow.

42
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,210
I can go straight from here.

43
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:36,260
There's nothing to do anyway.

44
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,980
I'm going to sleep.

45
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:33,730
 That teacher earlier said there was a student who saw Young Joo throw the flowerpot. 

46
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:38,660
 If that student testifies, my Young Joo would go to juvenile detention. 

47
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:44,250
 But if we give up on trial, they will forget about Young Joo's incident. 

48
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,580
Hello.

49
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,290
What's up with you?

50
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:00,480
Why do you look so worn out?

51
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:05,220
Ki Joon's grandfather passed away.

52
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,720
I was at the funeral home overnight.

53
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,150
Yes, I heard about that.

54
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:13,820
I need to go over later today.

55
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:16,340
Is Ki Joon doing okay?

56
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:19,970
Yes.

57
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,360
Mr. Lee...

58
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:34,340
Why are you talking so gently? It's not like you.

59
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:37,520
About my brother's trial,

60
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:41,670
you don't have to do it.

61
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:43,880
Why?

62
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:49,550
I heard my brother's homeroom teacher got fired after trying to help with the trial.

63
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,030
I know.

64
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:56,430
That's how I got this position.

65
00:07:56,430 --> 00:08:00,950
You shouldn't get fired, Mr. Lee.

66
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:07,650
Aigoo, you're worried about my livelihood.

67
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:09,440
That's too much concern.

68
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,820
You don't need to worry.

69
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,030
I heard that you told Young Joo's mother

70
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:25,370
he would be sent to detention if she doesn't give up the trial.

71
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:31,760
When you talk directly like that, it makes me sound like the bad guy.

72
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:36,690
This is all for both of the brothers in that household.

73
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:43,930
Teaching Director, what is your dream?

74
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:45,130
What?

75
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:49,780
You must be doing all this because you have a goal, right?

76
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,580
Careful, you're treading on thin ice.

77
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,570
Don't cross the line.

78
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,570
"Line"?

79
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:11,880
I'm trying not to cross it.

80
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:16,210
But as for you and this school,

81
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:19,190
is there even a line that can't be crossed?

82
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:29,510
Do you think you'll be safe with this attitude?

83
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:38,250
Even if I'm not,

84
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:42,890
I suppose there's nothing I can do about it.

85
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:08,080
   

86
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:25,370
- Poor guy. It must be so hard. 
 - We should go.

87
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:26,750
We should go, right?

88
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,910
Should we go after school?

89
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:41,870
I heard Ki Joon's grandfather passed away.

90
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:46,150
Yes.

91
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:49,910
You were also close to his grandpa, right?

92
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,650
Are you okay?

93
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:56,520
Well, I...

94
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:00,920
Ki Joon is having a harder time.

95
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,940
I'm...

96
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:12,320
Hey...

97
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:30,080
Didn't you say Ki Joon lived alone with his grandfather?

98
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,770
Yes. He did.

99
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:35,130
I'm worried that the funeral home will be too empty.

100
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,930
I know.

101
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:43,830
By the way, did you visit my mom?

102
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,680
I did.

103
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,870
I wanted to see her since it's been a while.

104
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:50,920
She likes it.

105
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,640
The speaker.

106
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,900
It's nothing much.

107
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:57,940
Still, you should call me before you visit her.

108
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:02,590
Okay. Sorry.

109
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:11,210
Did something happen between you and Teaching Director this morning?

110
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:15,440
Was it because of Cheol Joo's trial?

111
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:20,610
Yes.

112
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:23,680
What are you going to do?

113
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:26,840
I think...

114
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:32,190
that once again, I'll have to choose the direction you won't like.

115
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:35,340
"The direction I won't like"?

116
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:37,110
I'm sorry.

117
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:44,350
And now, once again, I become a selfish teacher who only cares about

118
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:49,060
my ex-husband and daughter, regardless of what happens to my student.

119
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,040
That's not what I mean.

120
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:56,040
I'm glad we're divorced.

121
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:16,750
Thank you for coming.

122
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:46,130
   

123
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:42,270
Wait.

124
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,480
Grandpa's not here yet.

125
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,950
Ki Joon...

126
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:31,510
 Do you hear that? 

127
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:33,310
 Wow. 

128
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:36,780
 Wow. That's so amazing. 

129
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,300
   

130
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:08,810
   

131
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:24,620
 When I can buy back this house, 

132
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:27,150
 I'll build you a better workroom. 

133
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:37,030
   

134
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,570
 I don't care if you do taekwondo or carpentry. 

135
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:49,270
 I'm happy with whatever you're happy with. 

136
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:53,710
 Of course. I'm your grandson. 

137
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,020
   

138
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:02,090
 Grandpa, you're being more sentimental than usual. 

139
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:05,570
 Of course. I'm feeling great today. 

140
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:10,010
   

141
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:35,890
 I guess Ki Joon isn't coming today either. 

142
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,900
Ki Joon, that punk.

143
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,490
I'm really worried about him.

144
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:43,040
Is he alone at home? He doesn't answer my calls.

145
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:46,280
You were absent not too long ago, and now...

146
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,520
I miss Gong Ki Joon.

147
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,480
Have you seen him?

148
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,630
Is he okay?

149
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:55,910
I think...

150
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:59,180
he's just resting at home.

151
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,220
He will be okay.

152
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:09,450
I have to go to the restroom.

153
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:14,290
Gosh.

154
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:27,150
Ji Won.

155
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:37,760
How is Ki Joon?

156
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:43,120
You live in the same house.

157
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:58,990
Actually...

158
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:04,190
I'm so worried about him.

159
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:09,160
I'm worried to death,

160
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:14,890
but there's nothing I can do.

161
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:31,420
- Eu-Eun Bi. 
 - What?

162
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:34,640
I was editing the video we shot last time,

163
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,900
and I realized the latter part didn't record.

164
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:40,530
I think we just have to record a little bit of the ending section.

165
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:45,010
If you're okay with it, can we film during lunch?

166
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:48,030
Or I have about one hour after school.

167
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:50,530
What?

168
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:52,910
Which part is the problem?

169
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:55,750
Eun Bi, look. It stopped recording at this latter part,

170
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:57,640
- but the beginning... 
 - What's up with them?

171
00:23:57,650 --> 00:23:59,520
It seems he's not in good condition.

172
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,100
Shouldn't Ji Ho marry his ex?

173
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,510
They even have a child.

174
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:05,030
What about Go Eun Bi?

175
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:09,230
Oh, my God. Am I seeing an affair unfold in our classroom?

176
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:11,020
Should he do that?

177
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:13,790
Of course not. That's why it's an affair.

178
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:17,320
Ah... They deserve each other.

179
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:25,130
Geez.

180
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:33,750
We got it. You look pretty.

181
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:37,240
It's so annoying.

182
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,660
Why?

183
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:41,280
Is it because of me?

184
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,630
Of course!

185
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:44,940
Because of you, I've beenâ€”

186
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:49,550
But Eun Bi, I didn't have a chance to ask because it's been so crazy for me.

187
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:53,640
So... What were you going to say

188
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:56,550
when you reached 10k subscribers?

189
00:24:56,550 --> 00:24:58,380
You don't need to know.

190
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:00,560
What is it?

191
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,680
Can you tell me, please?

192
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,950
Stop that.

193
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:06,950
You're a baby's daddy. You shouldn't act cute.

194
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,720
Eun Bi...

195
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:12,550
Go Eun Bi. Eun Bi, Eun-Eun-Eun Bi.

196
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:14,760
Go away, you.

197
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:23,860
So you're really good at "cutting things off", are you?

198
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,750
   

199
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:38,260
So...

200
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:41,190
Director Gu said she would get you into Jin Sung University

201
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:43,750
if you say that Young Joo threw the flowerpot?

202
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:46,970
She guaranteed you a scholarship and dormitory housing, right?

203
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:48,590
Yes.

204
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:51,930
Wow. She's really something else.

205
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:54,930
How can she involve you like this?

206
00:25:55,880 --> 00:26:01,560
But why is Director Gu so desperate to expel Young Joo?

207
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,390
I thought she was past the flowerpot incident.

208
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:07,640
It's not because of Young Joo.

209
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:11,240
Did you know that Young Joo's brother and Sang Rim are in a trial?

210
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,800
I know a bit about it.

211
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:15,190
She's threatening Young Joo's family

212
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:19,030
so they'll give up the trial with Sang Rim.

213
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:28,010
So... May I ask whose side you'll stand on?

214
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:35,710
I like him.

215
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:37,690
But still...

216
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:39,680
I don't know.

217
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:43,860
This is a really desperate matter for me.

218
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:46,550
I understand.

219
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:54,960
I've never been on anyone's side.

220
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:57,770
I'm only on my side.

221
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:19,510
Ki Joon.

222
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:21,610
 Gong Ki Joon. 

223
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:25,490
 Ki Joon, are you sleeping? 

224
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:30,180
 Gong Ki Joon. 

225
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:38,280
What do you mean?

226
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,200
Why are we giving up the trial?

227
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,470
It's already been decided.

228
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:44,040
Don't talk about it anymore.

229
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:46,050
That's ridiculous.

230
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:48,660
What did that man say?

231
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:52,270
After all this time, why?

232
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:58,240
It's Director Gu, isn't it?

233
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,580
Director Gu came and threatened us again, right?

234
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:02,220
Young Joo.

235
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:04,070
This is for the best.

236
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:06,210
I'm fine. Okay?

237
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:08,170
It doesn't make any sense.

238
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:11,040
Young Joo.

239
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:34,430
   

240
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:36,890
Hi.

241
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:38,490
What is it at this hour?

242
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:41,920
What did Mr. Lee say at our diner?

243
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:45,700
I see. So you heard.

244
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:49,420
What did that man say to my mom

245
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,890
that is making her give up the trial?

246
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:55,300
Where are you right now?

247
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:58,270
I'm not going to let this go.

248
00:28:58,270 --> 00:28:59,810
 Hey. 

249
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:02,690
Don't cause any problems and calm down.

250
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:06,580
 Come here. We need to talk in person. 

251
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:12,990
If Seo Young testifies, you might be punished.

252
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:14,260
Is that okay with you?

253
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:16,150
I don't care.

254
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:19,750
Of course, you don't, but your mom and Cheol Joo do.

255
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:23,190
If we give up on my brother's trial like this,

256
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:25,260
I'm going to drop out of school anyway.

257
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:29,120
I don't think I can stand it any longer at that school.

258
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,330
I was wrong throwing the flowerpot.

259
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:34,300
I don't care if I'm punished for it. But...

260
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:38,310
if that causes my brother's trial to go wrong,

261
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:43,350
I really couldn't stand it.

262
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:45,600
Right.

263
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,530
That's what I think, too.

264
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:53,050
I'll meet your mom and Cheol Joo and convince them.

265
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:55,550
For now, wait. And...

266
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,750
if the trial moves forward,

267
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:03,220
your family's chance to win will improve.

268
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,560
How?

269
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:13,080
I'll testify.

270
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:20,940
Gosh. I know.

271
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:23,470
I know I'm cool.

272
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:26,920
But it's too much, so don't look so touched.

273
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:30,430
I'm sorry.

274
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:32,280
It's fine.

275
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,520
Go home. I'm going to freeze to death.

276
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:38,800
Trust me, and wait quietly.

277
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,550
Got it?

278
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:22,580
What's going on?

279
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:28,390
What?

280
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:29,750
What is it?

281
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:32,100
Are you disappointed that I'm not your girlfriend?

282
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,720
Yes.

283
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,300
Geez.

284
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,420
Why are you here this late?

285
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:44,050
I ran away from home.

286
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:45,330
What?

287
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:47,190
Let me sleep over.

288
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:55,640
Stop overreacting.

289
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:58,520
I'm fine. Go and sleep at your home.

290
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:02,840
Fine. I'll go.

291
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:06,260
After a few days.

292
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:15,110
Seriously.

293
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:18,310
Wow.

294
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:23,520
Want some?

295
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:31,080
You seriously don't want some?

296
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:35,040
Aren't you hungry? I am.

297
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,000
Stop that and leave.

298
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,700
I'm really fine.

299
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:41,380
I know you are.

300
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:43,410
I'm not.

301
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:51,150
This is so uncomfortable.

302
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,720
Hey.

303
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,310
Let me borrow some clothes.

304
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:17,000
Are you asleep?

305
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:19,040
Yes.

306
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,280
Okay.

307
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:29,450
Are you going to sleep?

308
00:33:30,690 --> 00:33:32,450
What do you want?

309
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:40,320
- There's a Tottenham match today. Are you going to watch it? 
 - No, I'm not.

310
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:43,760
Okay, goodnight.

311
00:33:46,210 --> 00:33:49,480
I'm kind of hungry. Can I order fried chickenâ€”

312
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,900
That's enough, you b*stard.

313
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:19,790
Are you going to skip school again tomorrow?

314
00:34:21,850 --> 00:34:24,750
If you keep missing school like this,

315
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:28,650
your grandpa would have scolded you.

316
00:34:52,370 --> 00:34:55,120
Yes, I'll stay here a few more days.

317
00:34:56,910 --> 00:34:58,470
Cheol Joo...

318
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:01,890
Mr. Lee thinks the same as I do.

319
00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:05,170
We should keep on with the trial.

320
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:07,410
We can never back down.

321
00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:09,200
Okay?

322
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:12,360
Okay.

323
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:21,040
What are you doing this early?

324
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,810
You're up?

325
00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:31,670
You should have breakfast.

326
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:34,500
Hey.

327
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,560
If we ate all day, we won't finish that.

328
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:40,490
Geez. Just have some before you speak.

329
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:43,380
Don't eat it all up by yourself because it's so good.

330
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,960
What about your brother's trial?

331
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,980
How is it going?

332
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:56,220
I think it'll go well.

333
00:35:56,220 --> 00:36:00,070
Mr. Lee said he would help.

334
00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:07,200
Stop worrying and have some of this.

335
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:12,020
Eat up and let's go to school.

336
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:28,730
Ki Joon.

337
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:34,850
What happened to you guys? Why are you coming out of there together?

338
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:38,690
He ran away from home.

339
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:40,340
What?

340
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,990
I'll leave Gong Ki Joon to you.

341
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:45,270
I'll go ahead.

342
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:06,500
Did you have something to eat this morning?

343
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,490
Yes.

344
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:13,170
Young Joo made some toast.

345
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:15,910
He said it was his first time making it.

346
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:18,080
It tasted really bad.

347
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:22,190
How can toast taste bad?

348
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:24,730
That's why it was shocking.

349
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:31,890
Are you okay?

350
00:37:35,890 --> 00:37:38,170
I don't really know.

351
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:41,440
Sometimes it doesn't feel real.

352
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:44,590
Then sometimes, it feels too real.

353
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,300
You must have had a hard time too.

354
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:55,720
Yes.

355
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:06,930
Still, let's get through this together.

356
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:12,730
I'll cry with you and laugh with you. All of it.

357
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:16,400
There's nothing to feel embarrassed about,

358
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,260
and we have nothing to hide.

359
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:20,700
Right?

360
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:28,500
Let's cry our eyes out whenever we want to,

361
00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:32,310
and miss him as much as we want to.

362
00:38:33,350 --> 00:38:35,150
How does that sound?

363
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:39,540
It sounds good.

364
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:52,630
Gong Ki Joon, isn't he coming today either?

365
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:55,010
I miss Ki Joon.

366
00:38:55,870 --> 00:38:57,530
Gong Ki Joon!

367
00:38:57,530 --> 00:38:59,200
Are you okay?

368
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,860
Are you doing okay?

369
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:02,800
Sit down first.

370
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:06,570
Aigoo. He's grown so thin.

371
00:39:06,570 --> 00:39:08,770
The funeral must have been hard for you.

372
00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:10,370
Gong Ki Joon,

373
00:39:10,370 --> 00:39:12,280
I'll buy you some good food later.

374
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,680
Definitely...

375
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,810
That's what friends are for.

376
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:17,690
Thanks.

377
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:19,510
Gong Ki Joon, were you alone at home?

378
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:22,460
Why didn't you answer my calls?

379
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:28,900
We need to talk.

380
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:37,070
If you have to testify that you saw me throw the flowerpot, do it.

381
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:40,210
You have definite proof too.

382
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:42,970
Hand that in.

383
00:39:42,970 --> 00:39:47,180
You'll only be telling the truth.

384
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:52,940
Don't worry about what to do.

385
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:55,540
If it's an important opportunity for you,

386
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:57,400
don't let it go.

387
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,260
Do you mean that?

388
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:03,240
I do.

389
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:05,510
I was wrong for throwing it.

390
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:08,110
If I have to be punished, I'll accept it.

391
00:40:08,930 --> 00:40:11,360
The trial will go on regardless.

392
00:40:12,450 --> 00:40:14,930
You should just think about yourself.

393
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,910
I really mean it.

394
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:31,430
So... have you decided?

395
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:37,240
My meeting date with the president of Jin Sung University is approaching.

396
00:40:43,830 --> 00:40:45,970
I'll testify.

397
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:49,430
If the police ask,

398
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:52,530
I'll tell them that I saw Jung Young Joo throw the flowerpot.

399
00:40:52,530 --> 00:40:55,090
I'll tell them exactly what I saw.

400
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:58,060
That's the fact.

401
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,080
What a good choice.

402
00:41:01,770 --> 00:41:05,720
I knew I could get through to you.

403
00:41:07,330 --> 00:41:09,280
And additionally,

404
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:12,250
I'm planning to tell them everything I know

405
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:16,560
about this school, just as it is.

406
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,280
About how I was highly talented,

407
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:20,900
but I was always pushed back on competitions

408
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:25,830
and about the connection between you and the twins.

409
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:28,420
Well... things like that.

410
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:29,850
What?

411
00:41:29,850 --> 00:41:32,630
Facts. Right?

412
00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:36,470
What game are you playing with me?

413
00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:42,950
If you're planning on presenting another witness other than me,

414
00:41:42,950 --> 00:41:45,360
you probably shouldn't do that.

415
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:48,020
I was on the roof.

416
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:49,680
So...

417
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:53,380
no one else other than I saw what happened.

418
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:55,670
That's also a fact.

419
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:59,230
Sit down!

420
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:08,040
You don't have to tell the president of Jin Sung University about me.

421
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:11,970
If someone who grants dirty favors like that runs the school,

422
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:14,770
I don't want to go there.

423
00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:29,420
I noticed you requested to leave work early on Wednesday.

424
00:42:31,130 --> 00:42:32,650
Yes.

425
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:34,760
Where are you going?

426
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:39,200
So do you really mean to go?

427
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:41,930
Do you?

428
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:46,810
This trial concerns the foundation that the school is a part of.

429
00:42:46,810 --> 00:42:48,590
Are you thinking straight?

430
00:42:48,590 --> 00:42:51,380
What are you going to say to them? What?

431
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:54,910
Just the truth. Just as it is.

432
00:42:56,370 --> 00:42:59,380
Wow. You seriously don't get it.

433
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:02,960
 I keep telling you that you're just hurting yourself! 

434
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:06,300
 It goes around and around and damages the school. 

435
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:07,890
 Do you really not know that? 

436
00:43:07,890 --> 00:43:10,640
 - Don't you think this would hurt you too?  
 - So noisy.

437
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:15,120
 Okay? Do you think you'll be carefree and continue to work at this school? 

438
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:17,400
 If you're going to go, write your resignation letter! 

439
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:19,860
 Write it before you go! 

440
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:33,870
Mr. Shin Cheol Min. What is it?

441
00:43:34,470 --> 00:43:36,290
Aunt...

442
00:43:39,390 --> 00:43:43,050
 And the CEO has three children. 

443
00:43:43,050 --> 00:43:44,510
 One is at our school... 

444
00:43:44,510 --> 00:43:46,290
 The department could disappear? 

445
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:48,440
 Reformation of a department isn't child's play. 

446
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:49,560
 How can that be so easy? 

447
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:52,370
 What is this? Gosh, this is ridiculous. 

448
00:43:52,370 --> 00:43:54,150
 Don't bother with what students say. 

449
00:43:54,150 --> 00:43:56,360
 - They don't know what they're talking about.  
  - I'm not sure about that. 

450
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:59,380
 Isn't being disloyal to the school that gave him his salary, 

451
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:02,430
 neglect and dereliction of duties? 

452
00:44:16,890 --> 00:44:19,200
Let's get it together.

453
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:21,810
What do you mean?

454
00:44:21,810 --> 00:44:24,210
Jung Cheol Joo.

455
00:44:24,210 --> 00:44:28,270
You were so confident you could make him give up.

456
00:44:28,270 --> 00:44:29,710
I guess you were all talk.

457
00:44:29,710 --> 00:44:31,950
Thatâ€”

458
00:44:31,950 --> 00:44:34,130
I almost got them to drop the case.

459
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:36,570
But then a student suddenly changed her mindâ€”

460
00:44:36,570 --> 00:44:40,540
That's fine. Why ramble on with your excuses.

461
00:44:41,270 --> 00:44:46,780
Even this school's teacher is saying he'll testify against the company.

462
00:44:47,790 --> 00:44:49,590
Geez.

463
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:55,660
You brought Lee Kang Hoon here.

464
00:44:56,710 --> 00:45:01,130
We were being so cautious.

465
00:45:02,550 --> 00:45:04,500
You're right.

466
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:07,480
I thought he'd be obedient since he has a shady past.

467
00:45:08,130 --> 00:45:10,320
Just fire him.

468
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:12,740
Why are you walking on eggshells? It's frustrating.

469
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:16,370
There's that incident with Mr. Kim Moo Kyung too.

470
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:19,820
If we fire him, we need to make up a reasonâ€”

471
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:23,840
What reason in this tiny countryside school?

472
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:26,880
Just do as you always do, Aunt.

473
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:38,720
So are you going to Cheol Joo's trial?

474
00:45:39,430 --> 00:45:42,740
- Yes. 
 - I don't think that your testimony alone will be enough.

475
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:44,230
You said there's no proof.

476
00:45:44,230 --> 00:45:48,400
You could lose the trial and be at a disadvantage with the school.

477
00:45:49,670 --> 00:45:53,670
Pray for me that that doesn't happen.

478
00:45:53,670 --> 00:45:56,000
I have to go.

479
00:46:03,910 --> 00:46:07,640
As I announced, I uploaded a dance-cover video of a new song,

480
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:09,130
so watch it a lot,

481
00:46:09,130 --> 00:46:11,650
and please leave a comment, like, and subscribe.

482
00:46:11,650 --> 00:46:15,200
And please turn on the notification!

483
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:22,810
Right. I'll end the live stream here for today.

484
00:46:22,810 --> 00:46:24,760
Dream of me!

485
00:46:28,610 --> 00:46:32,040
Hyun Woo. Aigoo.

486
00:46:32,870 --> 00:46:34,750
There, there.

487
00:46:37,170 --> 00:46:39,410
I said I could do it by myself.

488
00:46:39,410 --> 00:46:41,520
The baby must be cold.

489
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:44,800
I came out just for a little while since it's time for his milk and sleep.

490
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:54,930
I guess he's kind of cute.

491
00:46:54,930 --> 00:46:58,710
Do you want to hold him?  A baby smells so good.

492
00:46:58,710 --> 00:47:00,360
Okay.

493
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:03,870
Here... brace my Hyun Woo's neck.

494
00:47:03,870 --> 00:47:06,180
Careful, careful...

495
00:47:10,670 --> 00:47:12,230
How is my Hyun Woo?

496
00:47:12,230 --> 00:47:13,950
- Cute, right? 
 - Yes.

497
00:47:35,190 --> 00:47:37,890
 I found out why Tower Entertainment fired Go Eun Bi. 

498
00:47:37,890 --> 00:47:40,820
 - Pregnancy. 
 - Careful. I'll report you for false rumors. 

499
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:42,800
 I heard a baby crying on the live stream. 

500
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:44,420
 - Me too. 
 - No way. 

501
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:46,450
 It's around when she got fired as a trainee. 

502
00:47:46,450 --> 00:47:48,370
 My God. 

503
00:47:59,110 --> 00:48:01,050
Thank you so much, Mr. Lee.

504
00:48:01,050 --> 00:48:02,970
We feel so shameless.

505
00:48:02,970 --> 00:48:04,260
Don't mention it.

506
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:07,170
I apologize for not making up my mind sooner.

507
00:48:07,170 --> 00:48:11,550
No matter what the trial results are, I'll make it up to you.

508
00:48:29,350 --> 00:48:32,410
It'll go well. Let's go inside.

509
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:17,430
Ms. Song Chae Rin.

510
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:23,420
Are you going somewhere?

511
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:26,800
I have an emergency.

512
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:30,450
You suddenly asked other teachers to take your classes.

513
00:49:30,450 --> 00:49:32,720
Mr. Lee Kang Hoon isn't here either.

514
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:36,790
We can't have you also leave,

515
00:49:36,790 --> 00:49:38,680
today of all days.

516
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:41,280
 I don't think only your testimony alone will be enough. 

517
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:43,770
 You said there's no proof. 

518
00:49:49,370 --> 00:49:50,690
Go inside.

519
00:49:50,690 --> 00:49:53,340
A teacher shouldn't abandon her students

520
00:49:53,340 --> 00:49:55,510
and act like this.

521
00:49:55,510 --> 00:49:58,660
Especially when I haven't approved it as the teaching director.

522
00:50:13,350 --> 00:50:16,310
At the time, I told the on-site manager, Gu Byeong Chul,

523
00:50:16,310 --> 00:50:20,550
multiple times that the high-altitude maintenance lift had problems.

524
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:23,590
I told him verbally and wrote it down in the reports.

525
00:50:23,590 --> 00:50:26,970
It's a mystery why those reports are no longer available,

526
00:50:26,970 --> 00:50:31,400
but I definitely checked the unstable maintenance lift with my own eyes,

527
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:33,890
and I documented the situation.

528
00:50:37,330 --> 00:50:39,450
That is all.

529
00:50:40,940 --> 00:50:44,600
Defendant, proceed with the cross-examination.

530
00:50:47,970 --> 00:50:53,050
Were you working on-site when the plaintiff was injured?

531
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:54,990
I was not.

532
00:50:54,990 --> 00:50:57,950
It happened after I was relocated to another site.

533
00:50:57,950 --> 00:50:58,990
I see.

534
00:50:58,990 --> 00:51:02,830
Then what was the last site you worked at?

535
00:51:05,970 --> 00:51:08,740
It was at a Chung Tan Constructions construction site.

536
00:51:08,740 --> 00:51:12,370
But before the construction ended,

537
00:51:12,370 --> 00:51:15,460
you suddenly quit while working at the site.

538
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:17,740
What is the reason?

539
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:20,050
Based on our findings,

540
00:51:20,050 --> 00:51:23,750
there was suspicion of bribery.

541
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:32,350
That was not the case. It is not the truth.

542
00:51:32,350 --> 00:51:34,770
Are you saying that you were falsely accused?

543
00:51:34,770 --> 00:51:38,290
If so, why did you not bring up the matter then,

544
00:51:38,290 --> 00:51:40,950
and accept your release from the post?

545
00:51:40,950 --> 00:51:42,000
Objection.

546
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,220
The defendant's cross-examination is not related to this trial.

547
00:51:45,220 --> 00:51:46,500
No, it is.

548
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:50,930
We must verify the validity of the testimony.

549
00:51:50,930 --> 00:51:54,580
Witness, speak.

550
00:51:59,590 --> 00:52:01,660
That's...

551
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:04,630
 Oh, it was 4-8-9-6. 

552
00:52:04,630 --> 00:52:06,180
 Isn't that Chief Seo? 

553
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:10,120
 Why would you tell Chief Seo your bank account password? 

554
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:12,980
 Why do you think? He's stealing money. 

555
00:52:12,980 --> 00:52:16,640
 Every time we get our daily pay, he snatches it away like that. 

556
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:19,150
 My goodness. It'll be the death of me. 

557
00:52:19,150 --> 00:52:22,840
 I would let it go, but he's taking thirty percent. 

558
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:25,070
 That's highway robbery. 

559
00:52:25,070 --> 00:52:27,650
 "Thirty percent"? 

560
00:52:27,650 --> 00:52:29,160
 That's ridiculous. 

561
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:32,620
 Supervisor Lee, won't you do something about it? 

562
00:52:32,620 --> 00:52:34,020
 Money is one thing, 

563
00:52:34,020 --> 00:52:37,750
 but because the higher-ups take too much, the young ones keep quitting. 

564
00:52:37,750 --> 00:52:40,370
 This is a never-ending, vicious cycle. 

565
00:52:40,370 --> 00:52:43,220
 Yeah. Supervisor Lee, we're begging you. 

566
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:44,590
 Help us. 

567
00:52:44,590 --> 00:52:47,000
 Please, Supervisor Lee. 

568
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,810
 If you submit this, Internal Investigation will look into it. 

569
00:52:49,810 --> 00:52:53,770
 Then you just have to tell them exactly what happened. 

570
00:52:53,770 --> 00:52:57,970
 Supervisor Lee, thank you so much. 

571
00:52:57,970 --> 00:52:59,770
 Supervisor Lee, we won't forget this. 

572
00:52:59,770 --> 00:53:03,980
 Aigoo, you can just repay me with drinks. 

573
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:06,370
 - Supervisor Lee? 
 - Yes? 

574
00:53:06,370 --> 00:53:09,540
 We're the internal investigation team of Chung Tan Constructions. 

575
00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:12,260
 Is this about the worker's wage-embezzlement issue? 

576
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:15,890
 What embezzlement are you talking about? Are you crazy? 

577
00:53:15,890 --> 00:53:19,430
 We looked into it, and it looks like you switched the materials illegally 

578
00:53:19,430 --> 00:53:21,460
 and intentionally postponed construction. 

579
00:53:21,460 --> 00:53:24,590
 And you requested a bribe from the manager for it. 

580
00:53:24,590 --> 00:53:25,850
 What? 

581
00:53:25,850 --> 00:53:28,650
 Wh-Who? Me? 

582
00:53:28,650 --> 00:53:30,490
 I think you've got it wrong. 

583
00:53:30,490 --> 00:53:32,450
 The person you need to investigate isn't me. 

584
00:53:32,450 --> 00:53:35,560
 It's this manager and Chief Seo in the construction team. 

585
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:38,990
 They embezzled these people's wages 

586
00:53:38,990 --> 00:53:42,100
 so I submitted a complaint to Internal Investigation. 

587
00:53:43,230 --> 00:53:46,160
   - Is that true? 
 - Sorry? 

588
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:52,110
 N-No, we received the amount indicated 

589
00:53:52,110 --> 00:53:54,390
 on the employment contract. 

590
00:53:54,390 --> 00:53:56,310
 Chief... 

591
00:53:56,310 --> 00:53:58,690
 You asked me to do it. 

592
00:53:58,690 --> 00:54:01,860
 You begged me to help you because you were suffering. 

593
00:54:01,860 --> 00:54:04,180
 Speak up, my friend. 

594
00:54:04,180 --> 00:54:06,070
 What do you mean, Supervisor Lee? 

595
00:54:06,070 --> 00:54:10,340
 We're doing fine and getting paid what we work for. 

596
00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:12,630
 That was... 

597
00:54:12,630 --> 00:54:16,440
because of the disappointment and betrayal from others.

598
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:20,710
So I gave up in despair and the company suggested that I resign

599
00:54:20,710 --> 00:54:23,900
instead of being dishonorably sacked.

600
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:26,260
That was what happened.

601
00:54:26,260 --> 00:54:28,450
Since then,

602
00:54:28,450 --> 00:54:32,730
I promised myself that I would never care about anyone else.

603
00:54:33,850 --> 00:54:37,650
But I found out that the company and school were forcefully pressuring

604
00:54:37,650 --> 00:54:41,940
a poor on-site apprentice who was injured while doing his job.

605
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:45,020
I couldn't just sit by and watch.

606
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:48,460
So I came here today to testify.

607
00:54:48,460 --> 00:54:51,820
We weren't asking for such a sentimental answer.

608
00:54:51,820 --> 00:54:56,450
Despite it all, the witness wasn't present at the time of the plaintiff's injury,

609
00:54:56,450 --> 00:54:59,670
and he cannot prove the circumstances surrounding the plaintiff's accident.

610
00:54:59,670 --> 00:55:04,380
And afterward, he caused unrest on-site with illicit behavior,

611
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:09,990
and we must question the validity of the witness' testimony.

612
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:19,400
Ms. Song, I heard you were looking for us in a hurry.

613
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:21,190
Guys.

614
00:55:21,990 --> 00:55:24,470
I need your help with something.

615
00:55:24,470 --> 00:55:25,850
Excuse me?

616
00:55:25,850 --> 00:55:27,090
What do you need?

617
00:55:27,090 --> 00:55:30,470
You know that today is Young Joo's brother's trial, right?

618
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:36,720
Please check the texts here.

619
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:39,570
   

620
00:55:39,570 --> 00:55:40,890
Why are you guys here?

621
00:55:40,890 --> 00:55:43,330
We'll tell you later.

622
00:55:51,060 --> 00:55:53,640
I think we can prove it.

623
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:56,780
Plaintiff, do you have a reason for a re-examination?

624
00:55:56,780 --> 00:55:58,420
Yes, Your Honor.

625
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:01,190
Witness.

626
00:56:01,190 --> 00:56:06,290
Is this the phone that you used to use?

627
00:56:06,290 --> 00:56:08,250
Yes.

628
00:56:09,150 --> 00:56:13,850
On May 13th, 2016, the witness sent a text to on-site manager Gu Byeong Chul.

629
00:56:13,850 --> 00:56:15,660
"The high-altitude maintenance lift is dangerous."

630
00:56:15,660 --> 00:56:19,420
"Will you change it only after someone gets hurt?"

631
00:56:19,420 --> 00:56:21,450
He received a reply saying,

632
00:56:21,450 --> 00:56:25,410
"We have it under control. Don't worry about it."

633
00:56:25,410 --> 00:56:28,360
And on May 23rd, 2016...

634
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:32,850
"Manager, I almost got injured because the maintenance lift tilted today."

635
00:56:32,850 --> 00:56:35,980
"If you don't change it soon, I'll put a hold on all construction."

636
00:56:35,980 --> 00:56:38,350
That was another text.

637
00:56:38,350 --> 00:56:40,270
And Manager Gu said,

638
00:56:40,270 --> 00:56:44,820
"I said, I got it." You received a text from him.

639
00:56:45,910 --> 00:56:47,670
Yes.

640
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:54,250
Your Honor, I will submit the screenshot of this text as evidence.

641
00:57:05,690 --> 00:57:07,750
Quiet in the courtroom.

642
00:57:07,750 --> 00:57:08,590
Quiet!

643
00:57:08,590 --> 00:57:14,360
â™«  Dream on, dream on, dream on  â™«

644
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:19,280
So, Ms. Song Chae Rin asked you guys to deliver that phone to me?

645
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:23,090
Yes. Ms. Song was going to come herself, but she got caught by Mr. Lee Han Soo.

646
00:57:23,090 --> 00:57:27,040
â™«  Dream on, dream on  â™«

647
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:29,410
Thank you so much.

648
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:35,320
Oh, they're here.

649
00:57:39,310 --> 00:57:40,440
We won.

650
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:42,460
Well, they said we would win.

651
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:44,860
Gu Byeong Chul acknowledges the texts.

652
00:57:44,860 --> 00:57:46,920
So Sang Rim won't be able to get out of it.

653
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:49,840
They said they'll agree on the settlement soon.

654
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:51,820
Thank you so much, Mr. Lee.

655
00:57:51,820 --> 00:57:54,380
Thank you, Lawyer Lee.

656
00:57:54,380 --> 00:57:56,040
Thank you.

657
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:58,240
Thank you, Mr. Lee.

658
00:57:58,770 --> 00:58:01,100
I'm so happy for you.

659
00:58:01,590 --> 00:58:04,460
I'm so glad.

660
00:58:18,850 --> 00:58:20,500
   

661
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:30,040
   

662
00:58:31,540 --> 00:58:33,690
Hi.

663
00:58:33,690 --> 00:58:36,170
The trial went well.

664
00:58:36,950 --> 00:58:39,370
How did it go?

665
00:58:40,950 --> 00:58:44,060
- We won. 
 - Really?

666
00:58:48,350 --> 00:58:50,360
It's all thanks to you.

667
00:58:51,930 --> 00:58:54,120
Thank you, seriously.

668
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,340
I didn't do anything.

669
00:58:57,340 --> 00:59:00,200
Okay. I'll see you at school.

670
00:59:09,580 --> 00:59:11,730
Won't this cause a problem?

671
00:59:11,730 --> 00:59:13,680
We need the decision from the board,

672
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:17,940
and I don't think you should post it so publicly.

673
00:59:18,570 --> 00:59:20,720
"Problem"?

674
00:59:22,580 --> 00:59:25,010
What "problem"?

675
00:59:25,740 --> 00:59:29,700
I'm posting it at my own school. What is the problem?

676
00:59:36,890 --> 00:59:38,810
Kang Seo Young.

677
00:59:45,100 --> 00:59:47,140
Do you have work today?

678
00:59:47,140 --> 00:59:50,250
No. Why?

679
00:59:50,250 --> 00:59:52,800
Do you want to go eat something nice?

680
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:54,780
It's my treat.

681
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:57,690
Why?

682
00:59:57,690 --> 00:59:59,470
You're always asking why.

683
00:59:59,470 --> 01:00:02,680
The trial ended well,

684
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:05,280
and I have a lot to thank you for.

685
01:00:06,890 --> 01:00:09,040
If you want.

686
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:13,950
Aigoo, aigoo, aigoo.

687
01:00:15,250 --> 01:00:17,490
Did you get a good rest?

688
01:00:17,490 --> 01:00:20,960
Aigoo, another sickening couple here.

689
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:22,480
It gives me the chills.

690
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:26,410
Sorry? What are you talking about?

691
01:00:26,410 --> 01:00:29,110
You guys really don't look good together.

692
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:39,010
Mr. Lee, it's not like that...

693
01:01:02,150 --> 01:01:04,840
 That's crazy. 

694
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:06,150
 Oh, my God. 

695
01:01:06,150 --> 01:01:08,210
 What is that? 

696
01:01:12,220 --> 01:01:15,550
 What did Mr. Lee Kang Hoon do? 

697
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:30,660
Well... Director Gu?

698
01:01:30,660 --> 01:01:32,730
Mr. Lee Kang Hoon,

699
01:01:32,730 --> 01:01:35,760
I'm glad I ran into you.

700
01:01:36,550 --> 01:01:39,550
- Sorry? 
 - You...

701
01:01:40,820 --> 01:01:42,890
You're fired.

702
01:01:44,110 --> 01:01:46,260
   

703
01:02:14,730 --> 01:02:20,800

 You're next. Just wait. 

709
01:02:48,260 --> 01:02:50,970
 For what reason? 

710
01:02:51,890 --> 01:02:54,380
 It's time for me to step up again. 

711
01:02:54,380 --> 01:02:57,790
 Get rid of those rowdy kids at the gate. 

712
01:02:57,790 --> 01:02:59,400
 I thought... 

713
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:04,460
 I thought I was more helpful to Eun Bi than anyone else. 

714
01:03:04,460 --> 01:03:07,640
 - I don't know if I can do it. 
 - Let's do it together. 

715
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:11,360
 So many unjust things, 

716
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:13,310
 and I have no power. 

717
01:03:13,310 --> 01:03:15,820
 There has to be a way.
