1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,610
   

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,080
   

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:11,950
   

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,990
   

5
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:16,970
   

6
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:21,220
   

7
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:33,680
   

8
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,170
Starting tomorrow, let's walk together.

9
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:40,700
What?

10
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,240
Let's eat lunch together,

11
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:49,550
and let's walk home together after work.

12
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,300
What are you saying?

13
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,740
I'm asking you to go out with me.

14
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:01,800
I like you.

15
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:12,090


16
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:23,470
No one's here yet. 
    

17
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:25,500
Yes.

18
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:32,700
So... are we dating now?

19
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,100
It's nice, but it doesn't feel real.

20
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,920
I agree.

21
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:51,410
Then what are we supposed to do now?

22
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:54,460
I told you earlier.

23
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:58,330
We'll walk to school together and eat lunches together.

24
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:03,200
That's what Young Joo and Seo Young did.

25
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,430
Are you crazy?

26
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:06,850
How can we make it so obvious like that?

27
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:08,520
Maybe you're right.

28
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:11,380
 Come in, come in, hurry. 

29
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:14,720
Hey. For now, let's not make it obvious at school.

30
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,680
Will you be a Regulation Department member?

31
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,890
Wh-What are you two doing?

32
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:26,500
You're both here way too early.

33
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,990
Yes.

34
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:31,270
It's like you walked here together at dawn.

35
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:36,520
No, of course not. We didn't walk here together.

36
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,640
I'll believe that for now.

37
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:49,140
- Hey, I'll do that for you. 
 - No.

38
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,490
It's just a photo!

39
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:57,410
It's my middle school graduation photo.

40
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:59,880
I ran into the Regulations Teacher walking upstairs.

41
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:03,300
- Like it's going to pierce the sky, right? 
 - I think it's too much.

42
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,480
No, never mind.

43
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,770
It's driving me crazy.

44
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:11,260
Geez.

45
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:13,170
One is enough.

46
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:16,280
- I'm not doing it. 
 - Come on.

47
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,040
 I'm asking you to go out with me. 

48
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,660
 I like you. 

49
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,040
Fine, fine.

50
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,940
- No way. 
 - Just take the picture.

51
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:27,000
No way, I'm not doing it.

52
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,500
Jin Ji Won.

53
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,040
Jin Ji Won!

54
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:34,730
Sorry? What?

55
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:36,450
Ji Won, is something going on?

56
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:38,410
Why aren't you concentrating?

57
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:39,590
Yes.

58
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:43,020
You look like someone who has pretended to be

59
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:44,810
a guy's friend since childhood

60
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:47,300
and then finally got together with him.

61
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:50,610
Hey! That's complete nonsense!

62
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:52,050
It's so, it's so, so...

63
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:54,320
It's so ridiculous!

64
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,000
What's she talking about?

65
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,730
Was Ji Won confessed to?

66
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:02,840
No.

67
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,200
I was talking about last night's web novel.

68
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,410
What's up with her?

69
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:08,190
She suddenly made herself angry.

70
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:10,510
- Seriously. 
 - Which web novel was it?

71
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,710
Hey, hey.

72
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,720
Ki Joon!

73
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,400
Hey! Gong Ki Joon, are you okay? Are you hurt?

74
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,150
Oh, no!

75
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:29,180
What's going on?

76
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:32,450
You surprised me.

77
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:34,260
What? Should I call an ambulance?

78
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:37,410
Geez, I fell, too.

79
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:41,820
Jin Ji Won! Why are you discriminating between friends?

80
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,900
I-I, oh... Ho Sung.

81
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:47,170
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

82
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,550
- What's going on? 
 - Was he hurt badly?

83
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:53,720
I don't know.

84
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,080
- You don't know? 
 - Then why run over there?

85
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:03,520
I'm seriously going crazy.

86
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,830
Gosh.

87
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:07,640
Have my eyes become weird from being with him so much?

88
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,670
Did I get attached to him?

89
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:13,220
Ji Ho Sung, seriously!

90
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:15,420
He has seeped into my brain. What do I do?

91
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:17,680
Do something about what? Do what you want.

92
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,030
Seriously.

93
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:22,550
She doesn't even care about her best friend's love life because she was dumped.

94
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:24,860
I don't know what you're talking about.

95
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:27,740
What about you? Have you recovered?

96
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:31,380
Are you just letting Young Joo go like this?

97
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:34,430
How many times do I have to tell you it wasn't like that?

98
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,820
What's the point of telling you? You'll just think whatever you want.

99
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,640
Don't make me laugh.

100
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,360
Why don't you try fooling a ghost?

101
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:53,060
   

102
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:00,200
Okay. I'll do what my heart tells me.

103
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,970
I'm leaving.

104
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,570
Hey, where are you?

105
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,150
Geez, why isn't the brake working?

106
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:25,090
It's no good.

107
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:28,060
What are you doing?

108
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:30,150
What?

109
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:34,400
I'm just... you know...

110
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:37,320
Were you waiting for me?

111
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:40,110
What? Do you have something else to say to me?

112
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:43,890
I don't have anything to say.

113
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:46,260
I'm just...

114
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:47,340
I was going home... Wait...

115
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:50,840
I was going to go home, but I had some time.

116
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,660
So I was trying to decide if I should go home

117
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:57,680
and then go to work or go straight to work. So I was just sitting here, thinking.

118
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,110
I was thinking about what to do. What do you think?

119
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,000
What are you talking about?

120
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,660
I'm leaving.

121
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:14,260
Geez.

122
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:16,160
When is she coming?

123
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,380
Why did it have to be Jung Young Joo?

124
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:19,850
Gosh.

125
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:23,170
Seriously. I'm going crazy here.

126
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:25,100
Hey, sorry.

127
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:27,200
Why are you so late?

128
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,320
I had to make up an excuse to escape my friends.

129
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:32,210
You didn't get caught, right? You didn't do anything suspicious?

130
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,820
N-No, I don't think so.

131
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:39,790
What do you mean, "N-No, I don't think so"?

132
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:41,350
You made it obvious, right?

133
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:43,740
I told you not to.

134
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,550
Seriously. Come on.

135
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:47,670
Is it so hard?

136
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,510
Let's just stop talking about it.

137
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:53,280
Let's hurry and go.

138
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,500
No one's watching, right?

139
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,850
Let's go.

140
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,490
Is this a famous place?

141
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:06,780
That's what I heard.

142
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:10,220
I was searching the whole day at school.

143
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:12,770
Today's our Day One, after all.

144
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:15,060
I wanted us to go somewhere nice.

145
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,670
"Day One."

146
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:23,190
It looks good. Let's eat.

147
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:24,590
Okay.

148
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:58,180
Are you okay?

149
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:02,650
What a...

150
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:05,800
sweet place.

151
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,300
Yes. It's good.

152
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:11,110
- Eat up. 
 - Okay.

153
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:21,770
You can finish it.

154
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:24,440
No, I've eaten a lot.

155
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,060
Why aren't you finishing it?

156
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:28,630
I don't usually like things like this.

157
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:30,330
What are you talking about?

158
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:32,330
When we were children, I clearly remember

159
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:36,180
you ate an entire cake before someone could take it away.

160
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:39,080
Your memory is too good.

161
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,410
Still...

162
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:43,220
You eat it. I know you like these.

163
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:52,120
It does taste good.

164
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,610
I'm so full.

165
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,990
- This is it! 
 - Yes, this is it.

166
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:20,660
Let's just act how we used to.

167
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:23,790
But we actually...

168
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,430
ate a lot.

169
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:34,450
Hey.

170
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:38,040
Now that we're on the rooftop,

171
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:41,840
you make me think of something.

172
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,500
What?

173
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:51,130
What's with this atmosphere?

174
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:54,480
You...

175
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,370
Didn't you reject me that day on the rooftop?

176
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:58,340
Did I?

177
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:00,660
Back then, you definitely said...

178
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,940
 Oh... 

179
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:05,280
 I... I don't really... 

180
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,660
"I don't really"...

181
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,210
That's what you said.

182
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:12,720
If that wasn't a rejection, what were you going to say next?

183
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,820
That was...

184
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,800
"I don't really"...

185
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,800
but I like you.

186
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,830
That doesn't make any sense.

187
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:25,980
"I don't really"...

188
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:31,540
know what you think of me... something like that.

189
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:34,780
It definitely wasn't a rejection.

190
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:37,790
It was just so sudden.

191
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:39,690
I was just a beat late.

192
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:43,940
You should learn your rhythm now.

193
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,840
Then can you tell me now?

194
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,700
Tell you what?

195
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,510
When we were young, why did you punch me?

196
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,570
Oh...

197
00:11:57,290 --> 00:11:58,900
That...

198
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:01,960
 Why would I date Jin Ji Won? 

199
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,480
 I think you are. 

200
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,330
 I'm really not! 

201
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:08,200
 Don't say that. It's embarrassing. 

202
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:12,840
 I saw you! 

203
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,520
I heard you.

204
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:20,510
I heard you telling Ho Sung you were embarrassed about our dating rumor.

205
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:22,940
Did I?

206
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,410
There's no way...

207
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:27,320
You saw it, too.

208
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,480
I wrote down my response to your letter.

209
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,210
How would I have known that?

210
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:33,620
Thinking about it now,

211
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:36,660
you were probably embarrassed because you were little.

212
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,260
Anyway, that was how you acted.

213
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:39,590
Wow, I was...

214
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:41,280
Did I really do that?

215
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:43,700
Gosh.

216
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:48,000
That double nosebleed after you punched me in front of everyone was traumatic for me.

217
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:51,440
I probably forgot all about what I said.

218
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:56,910
I deserved it.

219
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,310
Sorry.

220
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:05,670
Now that I think about it, a lot has happened since childhood.

221
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:08,230
It feels so unreal.

222
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:11,860
Are we really dating?

223
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:14,100
Are you saying you like it or don't like it?

224
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,600
You're being timid.

225
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,110
Of course, I like it.

226
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:21,250
I like it.

227
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,740
I really like it,

228
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,100
but what's different?

229
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:32,220
Neither of us will suddenly change personalities and become cheesy.

230
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:35,660
We've already been to places together, but on our own,

231
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:38,490
and we even live together.

232
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:42,350
Of course, it's really great that

233
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:45,050
we know how we both feel now.

234
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:47,210
But what changes?

235
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:50,990
Hey.

236
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:53,660
Are you listening to me?

237
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:04,780
Isn't this a bit different?

238
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:32,480
"Unni's dance moves are the best as usual."

239
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,610
"Go Eun Bi is mine."

240
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:34,490
What?

241
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:35,660
Geez.

242
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:38,830
"Eun Bi, why don't you upload videos anymore?"

243
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:40,340
"We're waiting for you, Eun Bi."

244
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:41,320
Look, Eun Bi.

245
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:44,340
They're all desperately waiting for you.

246
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:47,940
 How do I confess to him? 

247
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:51,320
Eun Bi.

248
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,950
Are you listening to me?

249
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:55,470
Pardon? What did you say?

250
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:57,280
Eun Bi...

251
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:00,020
Is it because of what happened at Mirror Entertainment?

252
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:03,760
You'll have even more challenges after your debut.

253
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,600
Will you give up over something like this?

254
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,150
Who said anything about giving up?

255
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:09,340
I'm still going to do it.

256
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:11,240
Did you hear Jay-L's new song?

257
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,260
I think people like it.

258
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:15,180
We should practice a cover dance video and upload it.

259
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,830
Okay.

260
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:20,500
Wow.

261
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:24,430
In any case, you'll reach 10k subscribers soon.

262
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:29,040
Eun Bi, look forward to my extravagant event this time around.

263
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,880
All right?

264
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,760
Hey.

265
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,880
Don't do an event this time.

266
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,740
What? Why?

267
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:40,470
I have a plan.

268
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,860
Eun Bi.

269
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:51,320
Are you still angry at me by any chance?

270
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,960
You know,

271
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,030
I still don't understand why.

272
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:59,310
Why are you suddenly hating everything I do?

273
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:04,160
I'll tell you when I reach 10,000 subscribers.

274
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,580
Let's get things in order then.

275
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:08,060
"Get things in order"?

276
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:10,770
Geez.

277
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:13,710
Can't you just tell me now?

278
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:14,900
No.

279
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,520
Not now.

280
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:19,520
It's a very important message.

281
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,610
A 10,000-subscribers event...

282
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:30,390
Sounds perfect.

283
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,440
 Isn't this a bit different? 

284
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:33,090
What did Mr. Lee Kang Hoon say?

285
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:37,070
Is he really going to testify at Jung Cheol Joo's trial?

286
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:39,680
I don't think he could do it so easily.

287
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:42,050
He has many weaknesses.

288
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,750
Sang Rim is very concerned about this trial.

289
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:54,510
You're saying it's still unclear whether or not Mr. Lee Kang Hoon will testify, right?

290
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,950
Do you have anything more concrete?

291
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:03,170
I'll pressure Mr. Lee Kang Hoon more,

292
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:05,550
and try to get a clear answer

293
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:07,800
that he won't testify.

294
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,460
Yes, Jae Hyeok, what is it?

295
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,760
You can go.

296
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,150
All right.

297
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,820
What about Jae Hee?

298
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,510
Is she eating in the dining hall?

299
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:32,860
Yes.

300
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:34,920
She's probably eating with Kang Seo Young.

301
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,340
She's really acting funny these days.

302
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:40,240
Since when was she close to them?

303
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:46,230
Wasn't Kang Seo Young dating that boy, Jung Young Joo?

304
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:49,670
Is Jae Hee...

305
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:52,090
their third wheel?

306
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:53,670
No, no.

307
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:55,970
They already broke up.

308
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:58,900
I heard Kang Seo Young dumped Jung Young Joo.

309
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:02,900
I thought those poor things would get along well together.

310
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:13,380
Is that so?

311
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:19,580
What are you doing?

312
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:23,610
We got twenty more just now.

313
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:25,740
Hey, Ki Joon.

314
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:27,990
Eun Bi said she'd say something important to me

315
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:30,000
when she reaches 10k subscribers.

316
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,480
What could it be?

317
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:34,080
Could it be...

318
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,420
Yes?

319
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,410
Would she want you in the video with her?

320
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:39,600
Hey!

321
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,330
Why would she tell me that then?

322
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:42,660
Geez.

323
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:45,080
She said she wanted to get things in order.

324
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,230
"Get things in order"?

325
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:50,710
Could she be getting rid of me?

326
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:54,010
Did you do something she's not happy with?

327
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:55,530
I don't know.

328
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:58,280
She nitpicks at everything I do, even the tiniest things.

329
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,790
You probably did something but didn't take a hint.

330
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,360
Maybe.

331
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:09,390
Liking someone and all that

332
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:11,510
isn't easy.

333
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:13,810
You should do better.

334
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:15,100
All right?

335
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,450
Ho Sung.

336
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:21,300
What's this strange atmosphere?

337
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:25,240
   

338
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:29,230
 But it's obvious. 

339
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:34,160
 The person that Kang Seo Young would go out of her way to protect. 

340
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:37,090
 Jung Young Joo. A new kid in my class. 

341
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:39,730
 I heard Kang Seo Young dumped Jung Young Joo. 

342
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:46,110
 Kang Seo Young knows Jung Young Joo threw the flowerpot. 

343
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:47,810
 She either saw him, 

344
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:51,860
 or at least heard it from Jung Young Joo. 

345
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:53,560
 But... 

346
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:57,070
 those two dated 

347
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:58,920
 and broke up? 

348
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:09,130
Yes, come in.

349
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:19,420
Hello.

350
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:32,860
I hear that Jin Sung University is your goal.

351
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:35,350
Yes.

352
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:40,560
You'll be a senior soon. Are your college-entrance preparations going well?

353
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:43,360
Yes.

354
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:46,440
Why did you ask to see me?

355
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,010
Oh, yes.

356
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:54,740
I'm planning to meet privately with Jin Sung University's president.

357
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:59,900
I'm considering telling him about you.

358
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:02,970
There's admission, to begin with,

359
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:06,200
housing in a dormitory for four years,

360
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,930
and a full scholarship.

361
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:10,670
How do those sound?

362
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:15,810
Why me, all of a sudden?

363
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:23,220
I heard... you saw Young Joo throw the flowerpot.

364
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:34,150
I want you to testify about Young Joo's criminal behavior.

365
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:38,850
Don't take it the wrong way.

366
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:43,090
Even without your testimony, Jung Young Joo will be punished.

367
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:44,810
We have evidence,

368
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:48,850
and I'm sure we can find a witness somewhere.

369
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:53,260
In other words, nothing changes even if you don't testify.

370
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:58,790
I simply want to give you an opportunity.

371
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,700
You're more tender-hearted than I thought, Seo Young.

372
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:09,510
There's no need to feel bad for a friend.

373
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:11,580
You're doing the right thing

374
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:17,690
and admission to Jin Sung University is like a reward for your hard work all these years.

375
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:22,000
Think about it.

376
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:27,910
There isn't much time, so don't think about it for too long.

377
00:23:58,110 --> 00:23:59,470
   

378
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:07,620
Kang Seo Young.

379
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,420
Is something going on?

380
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,160
I saw you leaving Director Gu's office.

381
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,480
What is it?

382
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,500
What did Director Gu say?

383
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:26,610
It's nothing.

384
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:31,170
You look pale. Are you sure it's nothing?

385
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:38,150
I think I told you already.

386
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:42,160
You don't have to care about me anymore. Our deal is off.

387
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:46,630
Or did you always mind other people's business?

388
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:49,010
Why do you say it like that?

389
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:50,840
Can’t we be friends without the deal?

390
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:53,740
I never said I wanted to be friends with you.

391
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:10,790
Using Kang Seo Young to expel Jung Young Joo...

392
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:12,800
That's a great plan.

393
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:17,500
Why would I inconvenience Jin Sung University's president

394
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:21,290
just to expel Jung Young Joo?

395
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,210
That's not what's important.

396
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,200
Then...

397
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:31,160
If our victory is definite,

398
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:36,800
I think we have a chance of overturning the trial.

399
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:39,940
Jung Cheol Joo's trial, that is.

400
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,130
Have a good night.

401
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:01,220
Good work today. Bye.

402
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:14,370
Did you get off work just now?

403
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:15,470
Pardon?

404
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:17,100
Oh... yes...

405
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:20,630
Ah... Are you restocking dolls today?

406
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:22,030
Yes.

407
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,410
Don't come.

408
00:26:54,850 --> 00:26:57,070
 Don't come. Don't come yet! 

409
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,770
I saw someone else restocking them last time.

410
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:04,430
I wondered if you weren't doing it anymore.

411
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:10,700
Our assigned areas change periodically.

412
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:14,240
Oh... I see.

413
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:18,610
This is my last stop today.

414
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:21,600
If you're free, do you want to grab something to eat?

415
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,220
Pardon? Oh... Oh...

416
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:27,870
Mom called earlier and said  to get home quickly.

417
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:29,290
Too bad.

418
00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:32,360
Then should I take you home?

419
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:35,270
What? Oh... no, it's okay.

420
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:37,190
I'll get home quickly.

421
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:39,980
Okay then.

422
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:41,740
Get home safe.

423
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,320
See you tomorrow.

424
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:27,550
 How am I supposed to tell Young Joo? 

425
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:30,710
 What if Young Joo hates Ki Joon again because of me, 

426
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:33,210
 and they grow further apart? 

427
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:36,200
 No way... 

428
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,250
 No. 

429
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:38,450
 Still... 

430
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:39,810
Hey.

431
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:42,250
What are you thinking about?

432
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,230
It's nothing.

433
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,880
It's cold.

434
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,510
Let's hurry and go home.

435
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:01,150
Wow, so pretty.

436
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:13,460
We almost got caught.

437
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:20,280
We don't know them anyway.

438
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,920
Still.

439
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:31,650
So... Why do we have to keep it a secret?

440
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:35,230
It's not like we're doing anything wrong.

441
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:38,880
I don't know.

442
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,820
It just feels like we have to.

443
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:47,400
I think I know.

444
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,770
What?

445
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:51,830
Just wait.

446
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:53,700
I'll take care of it.

447
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:08,890
Ki Joon.

448
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,280
What's up this late at night?

449
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:23,390
I have something to say to you.

450
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:27,140
You can tell me tomorrow at school.

451
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:29,320
It's not something that's easy to say.

452
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,420
It will only get harder if I put it off.

453
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:40,600
Ji Won and I aren't just friends anymore.

454
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,960
We're dating now.

455
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:52,830
It's not that surprising.

456
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:54,340
Isn't it?

457
00:30:55,450 --> 00:30:58,060
I can't really congratulate you, though.

458
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:02,610
Did you run here in the middle of the night to say that?

459
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:05,100
That is...

460
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:08,100
I thought you should be the first to know.

461
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,860
Don't be so dramatic.

462
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:16,040
I'll be good to her.

463
00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:18,180
Whatever.

464
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:19,950
Now get lost.

465
00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:22,440
Hey—

466
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:33,130
Yes.

467
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,380
Here. The book you wanted to read.

468
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:41,120
Okay.

469
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,370
What are you doing still awake?

470
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:46,210
Nothing much.

471
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:50,390
Why was Ki Joon here earlier?

472
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:52,730
Is something going on between you two again?

473
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:55,000
"Something"?

474
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:59,200
Something is going on, I guess.

475
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:02,880
It can't be serious if you're smiling.

476
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:08,390
Why are you staring at the chocolates Ji Won gave you?

477
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:10,100
What do you get by only looking at them?

478
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:14,200
If you like her, just confess to her properly.

479
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:22,690
Do you want them?

480
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:25,270
What? Why?

481
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:28,000
You wouldn't even let me touch them before.

482
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:38,800
Eat them. I'm going to wash up.

483
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:02,240
 I want you to testify about Young Joo's criminal behavior. 

484
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,070
 There's admission, to begin with, 

485
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:08,450
 and a full scholarship. How do those sound? 

486
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:12,280
 You look pale. Are you sure it's nothing? 

487
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:38,600
Oh, yes! It's now 9,912 subscribers!

488
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:42,380
Not even 100 people left to go.

489
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:45,050
It feels like the day of judgment is approaching.

490
00:33:45,050 --> 00:33:47,850
Ki Joon, could you unsubscribe from Eun Bi's channel?

491
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:49,730
Hey. Don't you dare.

492
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:51,400
Please. Ki Joon.

493
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:55,120
Oh. I didn't subscribe.

494
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,560
What?

495
00:33:57,930 --> 00:34:00,160
- I'll do it. 
 - Don't do it, Gong Ki Joon!

496
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,560
Don't do it. You're my friend.

497
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,160
Is it me or Go Eun Bi? Don't do it.

498
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:05,450
Hey, Jin Ji Won.

499
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:08,780
We got you, Jin Ji Won.

500
00:34:09,890 --> 00:34:12,780
What did I do? Who said so?

501
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:14,600
The president of the Machinery Department's Class Two.

502
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:17,720
She saw you walking home holding someone's hand.

503
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:20,710
He was wearing our school uniform.

504
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:22,870
How would she know me?

505
00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:25,880
Think of all the days you protested at the school gate.

506
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:28,650
It would be weird if people didn't know your face.

507
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:33,590
Am I that famous? I didn't know.

508
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:36,580
Who is it, seriously? I'm disappointed, Jin Ji Won.

509
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:39,270
She must be mistaken. Why would I hold someone's hand?

510
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:40,840
It's nothing.

511
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,060
I don't think so.

512
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:44,970
You ditched us when we went to eat your favorite jjolmyeon.

513
00:34:44,970 --> 00:34:46,390
You're suspicious.

514
00:34:46,390 --> 00:34:48,800
Who is it? Spill it, now.

515
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,000
- Speak up. 
 - Hurry.

516
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,790
- If you don't, you're betraying us. 
 - There are no secrets between us.

517
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:55,520
- Hurry. Tell us. 
 - So disappointing.

518
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,390
That's enough.

519
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:07,700
Gong Ki Joon, what are you doing?

520
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:10,070
We're talking about something important, so stay out of it.

521
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:12,040
Why do you guys keep...

522
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:14,380
bothering my Ji Won?

523
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:16,930
- "My"? 
 - "Ji Won"?

524
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:21,120
- What? 
 - N-No way...

525
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:27,540
Am I not allowed?

526
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:29,070
We're dating.

527
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:30,430
Hey!

528
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:32,870
- "Dating"? 
 - They're dating?

529
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:34,790
- Really? 
 - They're dating.

530
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:38,320
- What? 
 - Dating?

531
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,270
So...

532
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:44,490
stop messing with my girlfriend.

533
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:46,910
- Girl... 
 - "Girlfriend"!

534
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:49,210
Oh, my God!

535
00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:50,720
- You should've told us! 
 - Oh, my God!

536
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,690
- Seriously. 
 - You fooled us.

537
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:54,120
Really?

538
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:57,090
- Are you guys dating? 
 - Since when?

539
00:35:57,090 --> 00:35:59,390
Is it true?

540
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:01,080
Hey. Did you know about this?

541
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,150
No.

542
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:03,370
Hey, Gong Ki Joon.

543
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:05,270
Hey, Gong Ki Joon. Jin Ji Won, tell me.

544
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:06,930
No, Gong Ki Joon, you tell me.

545
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:08,210
You said you were best friends.

546
00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:10,200
For real?

547
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,630
- My God! 
 - Really?

548
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:14,970
Ki Joon's a man.

549
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:18,250
- Oh, my God!

550
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:21,390
Young Joo—

551
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:28,280
So...

552
00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:31,590
Congratulations.

553
00:36:36,010 --> 00:36:37,830
Thank you.

554
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:40,440
I'm sorry.

555
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,650
There's nothing to be sorry about between friends.

556
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:44,880
I'm glad you look happy.

557
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:48,570
Although I don't like Gong Ki Joon.

558
00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:54,750
Let's be just like before and not awkward with each other.

559
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:56,580
Is that okay?

560
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,570
It's okay now, right?

561
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:26,170
Doesn't it feel better now that we told everyone?

562
00:37:26,170 --> 00:37:27,660
It does.

563
00:37:29,570 --> 00:37:33,110
So what's that thing you said you were going to take care of?

564
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:36,050
Oh... Young Joo.

565
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:37,460
What?

566
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:41,030
I knew that Young Joo confessed to you.

567
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:47,530
So I felt like you and I were both uncomfortable because of him.

568
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:49,690
Did you know?

569
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:52,870
What did you tell Young Joo? Did you tell him nicely?

570
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:55,930
Did Young Joo get mad at you?

571
00:37:55,930 --> 00:37:59,270
Gosh. Young Joo must be so hurt.

572
00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:03,790
I didn't break up your friendship, did I?

573
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:08,490
I don't think it was that bad.

574
00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:11,270
He's just pretending to be okay on the outside.

575
00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:13,830
So why did it have to be me?

576
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:16,820
What is there to like about me?

577
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:23,010
Anyway, I talked to him nicely, so don't worry.

578
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:25,030
All right.

579
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:27,370
Gosh.

580
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,280
What is it? Do you know her?

581
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:45,250
Yes, she's our neighbor.

582
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:47,980
Grandma!

583
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:50,570
Hi, Ji Won.

584
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:55,240
What are you doing here? It's dangerous for you to be sitting here.

585
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:59,340
It's about time for my grandson's preschool bus to arrive,

586
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:01,760
but it's unusually late.

587
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:05,300
It's hard for me to stay standing because my knees hurt.

588
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:06,640
My goodness.

589
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,960
Why do my legs hurt more than usual?

590
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:16,010
They ache a lot.

591
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:24,090
   

592
00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:25,750
   

593
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:31,440
Wow. You guys even got on the news.

594
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:35,370
You look much better in the picture.

595
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:38,790
Doesn't he look better in person?

596
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:47,350
Wh-What? What is it?

597
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:48,830
Come on!

598
00:39:48,830 --> 00:39:49,870
Love, seriously...

599
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:52,390
Okay, okay. Back to your seats.

600
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,000
Okay.

601
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:58,800
You all did well.

602
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:03,350
Baro Furniture seems to be pleased with the first project.

603
00:40:03,350 --> 00:40:06,540
We should wrap it up well. What should we do for the second project?

604
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:08,240
Have you guys thought about it at all?

605
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,740
Yes.

606
00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:14,230
As expected, Jin Ji Won.

607
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:17,940
What fancy idea do you have this time?

608
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:20,190
It's not like that.

609
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:26,150
This time, it really fits our project.

610
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:27,620
What is it?

611
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:31,770
Well, you know those places where preschool or academy buses stop?

612
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:35,020
We could install benches there so people can sit and wait.

613
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:37,600
Children could also sit there and wait for the bus,

614
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:41,070
and the elders caring for their grandchildren could use them too.

615
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:45,840
Lastly, we're experienced at making benches from the competition,

616
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:48,140
so we're catching two birds with one stone.

617
00:40:56,630 --> 00:40:58,600
H-How does that sound?

618
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:05,470
- Excellent. 
 - Really?

619
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:07,520
Definitely.

620
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,290
As expected, Jin Ji Won.

621
00:41:09,290 --> 00:41:11,710
- Great. 
 - That's right.

622
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:14,760
So we'll use Ji Won's idea for the second project.

623
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:17,360
No more questions, right?

624
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:19,400
All right, that's it for today.

625
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,980
Mr. Lee.

626
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:24,250
Can you tell us about your first love?

627
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:26,500
So suddenly?

628
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:31,590
I'm in a bit of a shock because of a certain disgusting couple these days.

629
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:35,320
I might as well wake up the dead romantic side of me.

630
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:38,450
What are you talking about? What disgusting couple?

631
00:41:38,450 --> 00:41:41,810
Yes, Mr. Lee. We have time since we ended early. Tell us.

632
00:41:41,810 --> 00:41:44,450
Geez. You guys...

633
00:41:44,450 --> 00:41:47,950
Hey, is my first love for your amusement?

634
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:51,140
Nonsense.

635
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:53,000
D-Day.

636
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,510
But my girlfriend, strangely enough,

637
00:41:56,510 --> 00:41:58,800
liked blue roses.

638
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:03,580
So I got a hundred blue roses this big

639
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:07,060
and went to the event location.

640
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:10,800
And the thing is, the event went just like the name of the café.

641
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:16,860
My girlfriend had an unimaginable accident there.

642
00:42:17,650 --> 00:42:20,950
She had the bouquet in her arms.

643
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:22,780
Then, a bee...

644
00:42:23,730 --> 00:42:25,090
stung her.

645
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:28,630
She got stung by a bee. Forget about the event.

646
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:31,010
I took her straight to the hospital.

647
00:42:31,010 --> 00:42:34,250
Gosh, seriously. How could...

648
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:37,610
my girlfriend be stung by a bee on the day I was going to confess...

649
00:42:37,610 --> 00:42:40,990
Her lips were swollen.

650
00:42:42,650 --> 00:42:45,830
What was the name of the café?

651
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:48,590
Tom Sawyer's Adventures.* 
  (TN: "Tom Sawyer" sounds like "sting" in Korean) 

652
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:50,450
Wasn't it?

653
00:42:50,450 --> 00:42:51,610
H-How did you...

654
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:56,290
Ms. Song Chae Rin told us last year.

655
00:42:57,790 --> 00:42:59,810
Exactly the same.

656
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:10,010
How could you tell the students that story?

657
00:43:10,010 --> 00:43:12,200
You told them, too.

658
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:17,180
Th-That was before you came here.

659
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:19,140
Geez.

660
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:21,620
How are we going to deal with this now?

661
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:24,120
Don't worry about it. They said they'd keep it a secret.

662
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:26,350
- Really? 
 - Hey! Be quiet.

663
00:43:26,350 --> 00:43:28,850
Why?

664
00:43:28,850 --> 00:43:31,630
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

665
00:43:31,630 --> 00:43:33,290
It'll be there if you look for it.

666
00:43:33,290 --> 00:43:35,990
I looked, and it wasn't.

667
00:43:35,990 --> 00:43:39,830
What about this one? I didn't see it anywhere.

668
00:43:39,830 --> 00:43:41,730
What are you doing?

669
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:44,080
What?

670
00:43:45,850 --> 00:43:47,100
Seriously?

671
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:50,050
Aren't they both married?

672
00:43:50,050 --> 00:43:53,390
That's why this isn't clear.

673
00:43:53,390 --> 00:43:57,350
Wow. What are the chances of meeting your first love again at school?

674
00:43:57,350 --> 00:43:59,780
Could it be... they're still...

675
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:02,390
Hey. No way.

676
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:04,870
Mr. Lee.

677
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:06,980
Gosh!

678
00:44:09,670 --> 00:44:11,220
You guys...

679
00:44:12,630 --> 00:44:14,740
Mom!

680
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:20,750
Mr. Lee, I didn't think...

681
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:30,920
Are you two dating?

682
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:32,590
I had no idea.

683
00:44:32,590 --> 00:44:36,290
I thought you guys were on bad terms.

684
00:44:36,290 --> 00:44:41,070
Ms. Song, sorry for misjudging things, even for a little while.

685
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:46,670
What, an affair? You guys...

686
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:49,700
It's true we are divorced,

687
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:54,210
but we don't hate each other or anything, and we have a child.

688
00:44:54,210 --> 00:44:58,280
So even if we work at the same school, it doesn't...

689
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:04,740
Why am I explaining this to you?

690
00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:08,230
Don't worry. I understand everything.

691
00:45:08,230 --> 00:45:11,070
My parents are divorced too.

692
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:18,120
Hey, when you say it so happily like that, I don't know how to react.

693
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:21,590
Anyway, good luck.

694
00:45:23,310 --> 00:45:26,920
Sure. I'll do my best.

695
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:32,330
So... it's only you guys who know what I said in the club room, right?

696
00:45:32,330 --> 00:45:35,930
And can you not tell anyone about meeting us here today?

697
00:45:35,930 --> 00:45:36,940
Okay?

698
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:39,480
Well, that's...

699
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:43,490
Geez, I'm so shocked.

700
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:45,680
What is the meaning of this, you two?

701
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:50,190
If you had such a relationship, you should have told me in advance.

702
00:45:50,190 --> 00:45:51,260
My apologies.

703
00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:53,820
All the students and their parents know about it.

704
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:57,740
The office had complaint calls asking if it's an affair.

705
00:45:57,740 --> 00:46:01,610
Affairs be-bet-between teachers... Geez!

706
00:46:01,610 --> 00:46:04,760
Seriously, it's too embarrassing to say it out loud.

707
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:08,420
Jung Young Joo.

708
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:15,150
Where are you going?

709
00:46:15,150 --> 00:46:17,730
We have a club meeting today.

710
00:46:18,670 --> 00:46:20,910
I've spoken to Mr. Lee.

711
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:23,280
Is it your part-time job?

712
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:24,870
No.

713
00:46:24,870 --> 00:46:29,030
Then do you have something going on at home?

714
00:46:30,690 --> 00:46:32,230
I have to go.

715
00:46:40,870 --> 00:46:42,160
Sorry, Mr. Lee.

716
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:44,980
I only told my friend who is really good at keeping secrets.

717
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:46,920
That's weird.

718
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:49,550
I also told only Rex.

719
00:46:49,550 --> 00:46:51,210
Who's that?

720
00:46:51,210 --> 00:46:53,250
My cat.

721
00:46:54,740 --> 00:46:56,610
It's all fine.

722
00:46:56,610 --> 00:47:00,770
I was going to tell you all at some point. But...

723
00:47:00,770 --> 00:47:03,120
it did get out quite chaotically.

724
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:05,290
Nothing can be done about it.

725
00:47:05,290 --> 00:47:07,400
Everyone saw Ji Won's bench blueprint, right?

726
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:08,700
Yes.

727
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:11,030
You're all going to make one each.

728
00:47:11,030 --> 00:47:13,600
We'll set up a total of six benches at six locations.

729
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:16,900
Go to your seats, and let's start by cutting wood.

730
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:18,080
Okay.

731
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:19,660
Let's go.

732
00:47:20,950 --> 00:47:23,260
   

733
00:47:23,260 --> 00:47:28,000
I didn't mean to make you work. I only called you to say goodbye.

734
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,670
Not at all. I didn't even do much.

735
00:47:31,670 --> 00:47:33,340
Fine.

736
00:47:34,030 --> 00:47:37,700
Still, I'm glad I could see you again before I leave.

737
00:47:38,410 --> 00:47:42,420
Thank you. Stay healthy and...

738
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:47,090
be strong and be well, just like you're doing now.

739
00:47:47,090 --> 00:47:50,260
I hope you also stay healthy.

740
00:47:53,630 --> 00:47:56,430
Oh, I almost forgot.

741
00:47:56,430 --> 00:47:58,390
Here.

742
00:47:58,390 --> 00:48:00,370
What's this?

743
00:48:00,370 --> 00:48:04,610
By any chance, do you stay in touch with Ki Joon?

744
00:48:07,030 --> 00:48:08,880
Yes.

745
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:11,200
It's Ki Joon's.

746
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:14,050
Can you get it to him?

747
00:48:30,910 --> 00:48:32,720
 Ki Joon? 

748
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:37,490
 He came to the funeral later that day. 

749
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:42,550
 Why don't you come inside? 

750
00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:12,690
 It's what I promised Gyeong Min. 

751
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:19,010
 I tried my best. 

752
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:23,200
 I wanted to get the gold medal. 

753
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:25,570
 I did my best, 

754
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:29,750
 but I only got a bronze medal. 

755
00:49:35,870 --> 00:49:37,510
 It's okay. 

756
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:40,440
 I'm so sorry. 

757
00:49:48,070 --> 00:49:50,230
 He couldn't bring himself to come inside. 

758
00:49:50,230 --> 00:49:54,630
 He was just crying outside for a long time, and he left. 

759
00:49:56,200 --> 00:50:02,040
Can you visit me with Ki Joon sometime?

760
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:05,500
Okay.

761
00:50:14,060 --> 00:50:16,060
 When you see Ki Joon, 

762
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:20,230
 tell him thank you for coming to the funeral. 

763
00:50:37,170 --> 00:50:39,810
 Gold medal! 

764
00:50:39,810 --> 00:50:41,180
 Hey, hey, hey. 

765
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:44,990
 Then we all have to win gold medals, okay? 

766
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:55,780
   

767
00:51:05,630 --> 00:51:07,830
I'm sorry.

768
00:51:07,830 --> 00:51:09,240
- Do you need it? 
 - Yes.

769
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:10,890
It's okay.

770
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:25,930
What is it?

771
00:51:29,390 --> 00:51:30,380
We need to talk.

772
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:33,910
Young Joo, were you waiting here all this time?

773
00:51:35,770 --> 00:51:40,410
By chance... You aren't going to fight again, are you?

774
00:51:42,790 --> 00:51:44,330
It's not that.

775
00:51:44,330 --> 00:51:47,220
Go ahead. See you tomorrow.

776
00:51:57,850 --> 00:51:59,310
Go inside.

777
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:07,550
What is it?

778
00:52:08,370 --> 00:52:11,080
Gyeong Min's family moved away today.

779
00:52:13,580 --> 00:52:16,270
Ahjumma asked me to give this to you.

780
00:52:29,530 --> 00:52:31,850
Why didn't you tell me?

781
00:52:34,620 --> 00:52:37,720
She said you were there at Gyeong Min's funeral.

782
00:52:45,330 --> 00:52:47,190
I didn't...

783
00:52:47,980 --> 00:52:53,270
sleep a wink for the two nights I was at the funeral home.

784
00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:55,940
Do you know what I thought about the most then?

785
00:52:58,470 --> 00:53:00,630
"When is he coming?"

786
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:03,710
"Why isn't he coming?"

787
00:53:03,710 --> 00:53:05,680
"He'll come."

788
00:53:06,740 --> 00:53:08,740
"No way."

789
00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:10,830
"Is he not coming?"

790
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:14,990
I kept thinking thoughts like that.

791
00:53:18,670 --> 00:53:20,860
I was waiting.

792
00:53:25,210 --> 00:53:26,960
I'm sorry.

793
00:53:28,190 --> 00:53:30,520
B*stard.

794
00:54:38,710 --> 00:54:39,920
Ji Ho Sung!

795
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:42,300
Eun Bi!

796
00:54:46,350 --> 00:54:48,670
What are you doing?

797
00:55:01,970 --> 00:55:03,670
Okay.

798
00:55:04,510 --> 00:55:06,340
- You got it? 
 - Of course.

799
00:55:06,340 --> 00:55:07,480
It's cold, isn't it?

800
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:08,950
Good work, Eun Bi.

801
00:55:08,950 --> 00:55:10,080
Just you wait!

802
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:12,640
I'll do an amazing job editing it before I upload it.

803
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:13,870
What's the point?

804
00:55:13,870 --> 00:55:17,400
My so-called manager asks people to unsubscribe from my channel.

805
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:19,200
Oh, right!

806
00:55:20,330 --> 00:55:22,130
   
 (TN: "Goeunbi" sounds like "gentle rainfall" in Korean) 

807
00:55:22,130 --> 00:55:24,120
It's 9,997.

808
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:26,150
Oh, no. I'm ruined.

809
00:55:26,150 --> 00:55:29,430
Wow, tomorrow will be D-Day.

810
00:55:29,430 --> 00:55:31,450
Wear something nice tomorrow.

811
00:55:31,450 --> 00:55:32,960
Nice?

812
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:34,740
But why?

813
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:36,390
Eun Bi.

814
00:55:36,390 --> 00:55:38,800
I'm scared.

815
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:41,780
Gosh, you can't even take a hint.

816
00:55:41,780 --> 00:55:43,050
Gosh.

817
00:55:43,050 --> 00:55:44,610
I'm also nervous for some reason.

818
00:55:44,610 --> 00:55:45,580
You're nervous?

819
00:55:45,580 --> 00:55:47,950
When you're nervous...

820
00:55:47,950 --> 00:55:51,230
Here. Go Eun Bi's special calming remedy.

821
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:55,480
That's nice.

822
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:57,020
My goodness...

823
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:59,500
I should take one, too.

824
00:56:05,980 --> 00:56:08,110
You two almost look like brothers.

825
00:56:08,110 --> 00:56:10,060
It looks nice.

826
00:56:10,060 --> 00:56:12,480
There's no need to frame it.

827
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:14,510
Why not?

828
00:56:14,510 --> 00:56:19,010
What's grander than my grandson being in the newspaper?

829
00:56:19,670 --> 00:56:22,340
I wanted to get lots of gold medals for taekwondo

830
00:56:22,340 --> 00:56:25,840
and be in newspapers and on news channels.

831
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:28,050
   

832
00:56:28,050 --> 00:56:31,340
I can't believe I'm in the newspaper for something so unexpected.

833
00:56:31,340 --> 00:56:35,610
I don't care if you do taekwondo or carpentry.

834
00:56:35,610 --> 00:56:39,240
I'm happy with whatever you're happy with.

835
00:56:40,750 --> 00:56:43,750
Grandpa, you're being more sentimental than usual.

836
00:56:43,750 --> 00:56:44,870
Of course.

837
00:56:44,870 --> 00:56:47,520
I'm feeling great today.

838
00:56:52,430 --> 00:56:55,010
Go, go, go!

839
00:56:55,010 --> 00:56:56,970
- That way! 
 - No, that way!

840
00:56:56,970 --> 00:56:59,080
Over there!

841
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:00,490
Okay!

842
00:57:00,490 --> 00:57:02,410
Ki Joon!

843
00:57:04,350 --> 00:57:07,390
Pass, pass!

844
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:12,670
Is it today?

845
00:57:12,670 --> 00:57:13,980
Yes, it is.

846
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:16,960
Ji Ho Sung will love it, right?

847
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:21,290
Poor Seo Young, you'll be bored once I start dating. What do we do?

848
00:57:22,110 --> 00:57:23,290
It's just what I wanted.

849
00:57:23,290 --> 00:57:25,040
Please let me be bored.

850
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:26,900
Geez.

851
00:57:27,980 --> 00:57:30,150
Go, go!

852
00:57:30,150 --> 00:57:32,370
- Young Joon! 
 - Kick, kick, kick!

853
00:57:32,370 --> 00:57:34,640
Ho Sung!

854
00:57:42,570 --> 00:57:45,200
Hey, Eun Bi!

855
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:47,470
Go Eun Bi!

856
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:50,090
Go Eun Bi!

857
00:57:50,090 --> 00:57:51,640
   

858
00:57:52,630 --> 00:57:54,110
What in the world?

859
00:57:54,110 --> 00:57:56,300
Look! 
    

860
00:57:56,300 --> 00:57:58,720
Me! 
    

861
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:00,030
   

862
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:05,930
Wait.

863
00:58:05,930 --> 00:58:07,830
Ji Ho Sung, that...

864
00:58:07,830 --> 00:58:11,690
I told him to dress nicely, but he's sweating.

865
00:58:27,250 --> 00:58:29,120
Eun Bi.

866
00:58:30,970 --> 00:58:35,450
Look forward to my next ceremony.

867
00:58:35,450 --> 00:58:37,470
Your hair is a mess.

868
00:58:37,470 --> 00:58:38,920
Geez.

869
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:44,360
That's because Class Two was provoking me.

870
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:48,180
You have to win class competitions, you know?

871
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:50,560
Whatever.

872
00:58:52,730 --> 00:58:54,340
I have 10,002.

873
00:58:54,340 --> 00:58:56,080
Really?

874
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:58,380
Dress up nicely after soccer.

875
00:58:58,380 --> 00:59:01,460
I'm going to tell you in the classroom.

876
00:59:01,460 --> 00:59:03,020
I think I'll go home.

877
00:59:03,020 --> 00:59:05,690
Geez, seriously.

878
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:12,970
It's driving me crazy.

879
00:59:12,970 --> 00:59:14,590
Again! It's that number again.

880
00:59:14,590 --> 00:59:17,050
- Again? 
 - Wait, wait.

881
00:59:17,050 --> 00:59:18,980
Geez.

882
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:23,150
Hello? Hello!

883
00:59:23,150 --> 00:59:26,350
You seriously have trouble understanding me.

884
00:59:26,350 --> 00:59:27,640
Okay.

885
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:30,930
I'm going to block your number and report you. Okay?

886
00:59:30,930 --> 00:59:32,210
Geez.

887
00:59:32,210 --> 00:59:35,720
Just block it. Why would you report it? What a hassle?

888
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:40,210
No. People like this should know what's coming to them.

889
00:59:41,430 --> 00:59:44,790
Okay, okay. Let's go, guys. Two, three!

890
00:59:44,790 --> 00:59:47,580
Passion, passion, passion!

891
00:59:47,580 --> 00:59:49,940
Let's go, let's go!

892
00:59:49,940 --> 00:59:51,320
Let's go!

893
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:53,220
Fighting!

894
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:55,210
Eun Bi.

895
00:59:55,210 --> 00:59:58,330
I have to go and warm up.

896
00:59:58,330 --> 00:59:59,930
- Cheer for me. 
 - Sure.

897
00:59:59,930 --> 01:00:02,220
- Wreck them! 
 - Wreck them!

898
01:00:02,220 --> 01:00:04,040
I'll be back.

899
01:00:05,420 --> 01:00:07,580
I got us drinks!

900
01:00:07,580 --> 01:00:09,630
Nice!

901
01:00:09,630 --> 01:00:11,160
- It's leaking. 
 - Thanks!

902
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:12,600
Okay, okay.

903
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:14,900
Me too.

904
01:00:15,740 --> 01:00:17,360
Oh, right. Ho Sung.

905
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:18,850
Someone was looking for you outside.

906
01:00:18,850 --> 01:00:20,880
- Me? 
 - Yes.

907
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:22,730
- Who? 
 - I don't know.

908
01:00:22,730 --> 01:00:25,050
- O-Okay. 
 - Go.

909
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:28,540
Let's go. Go, go, go.

910
01:00:28,540 --> 01:00:31,760
- You know, I thought of a bunch of events. 
 - Yes. That sounds nice.

911
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:33,510
Come on, listen to me.

912
01:00:33,510 --> 01:00:35,510
I said it sounds nice.

913
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:44,280
Ho Sung, how about me as a present?

914
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:45,590
How powerful.

915
01:00:45,590 --> 01:00:47,180
Right?

916
01:00:48,090 --> 01:00:49,810
Ki Joon.

917
01:00:49,810 --> 01:00:50,900
Jong Bok.

918
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:52,640
Team leader—

919
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:56,320
- What are you doing? 
 - What's going on?

920
01:01:17,300 --> 01:01:19,180
So cute.

921
01:01:35,950 --> 01:01:37,760
Eun Bi.

922
01:01:45,130 --> 01:01:52,110


923
01:02:08,860 --> 01:02:17,240
♫  Dream on, dream on, dream on  ♫

924
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:24,480
♫  Dream on, dream on, dream on  ♫

925
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:30,170
♫  My heart keeps thinking of you  ♫

926
01:02:30,170 --> 01:02:34,340
♫  I can't even understand myself  ♫

927
01:02:34,340 --> 01:02:36,040
♫  I'm always curious about you  ♫

928
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:39,220
   

929
01:02:39,220 --> 01:02:41,300
 - Who is this? 
 - It's my baby. 

930
01:02:41,300 --> 01:02:43,060
 Ho Sung. 

931
01:02:43,060 --> 01:02:44,990
 What do I do now? 

932
01:02:44,990 --> 01:02:47,420
 I'm really good at cutting things off. 

933
01:02:47,420 --> 01:02:48,740
 I'm not like you. 

934
01:02:48,740 --> 01:02:50,580
 You're getting better every day. 

935
01:02:50,580 --> 01:02:53,320
 Do you really have the blood of a great carpenter in you? 

936
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:55,710
 Try meeting with his mother. 

937
01:02:55,710 --> 01:02:58,050
 Ask if she wants him to go to a juvenile detention center. 

938
01:02:58,050 --> 01:02:59,730
 I'll put myself first. 

939
01:02:59,730 --> 01:03:01,530
 That's me. 

940
01:03:01,530 --> 01:03:04,110
 I wish every day was like these days. 

941
01:03:04,110 --> 01:03:06,520
 I want to be by myself today.
