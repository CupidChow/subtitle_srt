Do you think I'm doing this

00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,150
because I'm dying?

13
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,070
My mom left me

an inheritance when she died.

15
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,190
Some of it was what she got

16

when she got divorced and left the He family.

Why didn't you say so?

22

00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,990
to prove to you

191
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,590
that any difficulty can be solved.

192
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:52,670
I am serious.

193
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,340
Hao, if you want to learn to dragon boat,

194
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,030
you have come to the right person.

195
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,350
The dragon boat lessons here are detailed,

196
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,630
easy to understand,

197
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,670
informative,

198
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,870
and useful.

199
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,590
Look at all those trophies.

200
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,790
Those

201
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,750
were all won by me.

202
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,830
Of course,

203
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,070
your brother deserves a little credit too.

204
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,990
Look at the biggest one.

205
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,030
Best coxswain in the province.

206
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,870
I definitely deserved it.

207
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,460
So it was very wise for you

208
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,990
to pick me as your coach,

209
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,270
wasn't it?

210
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,590
You've had this trophy for ten years,

211
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,700
so you clean it every day?

212
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,470
It looks so new.

213
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,070
Anyway, you were right to pick me as your coach.

214
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,990
You're not dressed right.

215
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,030
Look at what they're wearing.

216
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,310
Are you dressed like that

217
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,030
for a date or a beauty pageant?

218
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,470
You're wearing perfume too.

219
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,870
No, I didn't.

220
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,150
Probably hair wax.

221
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,390
I'm just trying

222
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,230
to make myself look more sincere.

223
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,790
Please.

224
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,790
Hurry up and change.

225
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,590
You'll make people think this is a hair salon

226
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,860
hiring waitresses.

227
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:24,430
Come on.

228
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,150
What size are you?

229
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,950
My shoe size is 44.

230
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:31,990
Clothes?

231
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,670
Maybe an L.

232
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,430
Okay. Give me a minute.

233
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,190
Hao.

234
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:54,950
Wear this.

235
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:55,990
Your brother's spare clothes.

236
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,150
It should be about the same size as yours.

237
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,590
Thanks.

238
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,030
Hurry up.

239
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:01,710
I'll wait for you downstairs.

240
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,550
This is from Long.

241
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,070
My son.

242
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,470
You finally answered the phone.

243
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:05,950
I heard you're in Xiqiao.

244
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,710
Don't think I can't find you

245
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,910
if you're hiding from me.

246
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:20,590
Our dragon boat lessons

247
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:24,190
are usually small groups of five to six people,

248
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,830
but we also have one-on-one lessons

249
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:27,550
tailored to our clients' needs.

250
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,030
A typical class hour is one hour.

251
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,870
You can pay monthly, quarterly, or annually.

252
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,430
Right now, we are having a promotion.

253
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,950
Personally, I suggest

254
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,190
you buy a one-year one-on-one lesson first.

255
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,870
I'll give you a 10% discount and one month of extra lessons.

256
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:43,590
What a bargain.

257
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:50,990
Hao.

258
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,430
Our classes

259
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,630
may be slightly more expensive

260
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,510
than other places,

261
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,990
but our martial arts school is very professional.

262
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,060
You see. This place has continued for 100 years

263
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,790
and through generations.

264
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,190
It's definitely worth every penny.

265
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:10,580
In fact,

266
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,070
beginners like you

267
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,950
can also buy a month's classes first.

268
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,470
Based on our friendship,

269
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,350
I'll give you a discount.

270
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:20,880
I...

271
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,790
I want one-on-one lessons.

272
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,270
One year.

273
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,550
Great. Enterprising.

274
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,190
For your sincerity,

275
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,270
I guarantee this martial arts school

276
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,990
will never close down before the Spring Festival.

277
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,470
I'm kidding.

278
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,460
Since you're so sincere,

279
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,990
I promise to train you

280
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,950
to be the best rower in Xiqiao...

281
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,270
In the whole province.

282
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,270
You'll be just like your brother.

283
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,110
Let's get a couple of trophies back

284
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,150
and show them to everyone.

285
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,750
No need for that.

286
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,550
You just need to dare me to row.

287
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,150
Don't be so modest.

288
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,390
With me, what are you afraid of?

289
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,990
Let's finish paying first.

290
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,150
Mr. He, your card.

291
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:08,990
Thanks.

292
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,990
Let's start with a simple questionnaire.

293
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,230
How many sit-ups can you do?

294
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,590
Ten.

295
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:20,900
Ten?

296
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,670
OK. How about push-ups?

297
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,470
Fifty? Not bad.

298
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,270
Five.

299
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,950
How long does it usually take you to run a kilometer?

300
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,270
I've never finished it.

301
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,230
Come on.

302
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,150
Long, how about this?

303
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:53,780
Six.

304
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,390
Go on.

305
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,440
Come on.

306
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:00,380
Seven.

307
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,390
Come on. Don't stop.

308
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:05,780
Come on.

309
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:07,180
Eight.

310
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,270
Didn't you say you could give me ten?

311
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,310
I thought

312
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:17,990
that counted as two.

313
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,750
Harder.

314
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,670
You said you were only 65 kilograms.

315
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:39,990
Yes.

316
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,190
You're a liar.

317
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,470
That's enough. You've been running for half an hour.

318
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,470
That's enough.

319
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,660
Take a break.

320
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:54,870
Drink some water.

321
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,110
We'll continue after a 15-minute break.

322
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:05,990
Okay, Long.

323
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,950
If you care about him, be direct.

324
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,470
Why are you sneaking around like this?

325
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:20,870
Okay.

326
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,070
I'm the one who cares about him, okay?

327
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,950
It's really a drudgery.

328
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,230
He's as weak as a hothouse flower.

329
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,270
How can I teach him?

330
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,070
He's over 180 cm,

331
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,070
but what does he usually eat?

332
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,030
His arms and legs

333
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:34,870
are long and thin.

334
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,790
He has neither strength

335
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,790
nor endurance.

336
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,470
He's not even as fit as my dad.

337
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,710
Best rower?

338
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,950
He's lucky if he can just row.

339
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,390
That's your student.

340
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,030
You have to put up with it.

341
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,190
I'll keep you posted on your brother.

342
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,830
Duplicitous.

343
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,390
Just hide it.

344
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,340
Your takeout.

345
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:05,470
I'm coming.

346
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,510
Your takeout.

347
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,630
Thank you.

348
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,990
Why so many?

349
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,430
Can we eat it all?

350
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,140
Come and eat!

351
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,070
Come on. Give them a share of these three.

352
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,190
Okay.

353
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,830
Come on. Time to eat.

354
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,430
So much?

355
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,630
Come on, Hao.

356
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,430
Join us.

357
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:25,180
Come on.

358
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:26,630
Sit here.

359
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:31,910
Smells good.

360
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,150
Sit here.

361
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:51,950
Enjoy your meal.

362
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:57,280
Come on.

363
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,220
That's a lot of chicken. Come on.

364
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,390
Long.

365
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,750
What's wrong with you today?

366
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,670
White cut chicken.

367
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:10,030
Roasted bacon. Braised pork.

368
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,190
Are you rich?

369
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,230
I'm afraid the food here is not likable

370
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,990
and will aggravate others,

371
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,510
so I ordered some takeout to make it up to you.

372
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,070
Thanks, Long.

373
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:18,790
Come on.

374
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,430
Thanks, Long.

375
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,590
They look delicious.

376
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,470
Have some more.

377
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,270
Thanks, Long.

378
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,590
Jiashu, you love chicken thighs. You eat it.

379
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,070
