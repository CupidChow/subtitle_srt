[Episode 10]

3
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,950
You're not "Number One"

4
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:25,910
or "Top Student."

5
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:29,720
You're simply He Jiahao.

6
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,630
Thank you all for sharing.

7
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:12,950
Next, we'll tell you

8
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:14,760
more about the school's priorities

9
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,230
for the semester.

10
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:18,040
Please open it.

11
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:18,910
Why are you here?

12
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,510
Where's the money?

13
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:22,590
This way.

14
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,040
I'm working on it.

15
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,040
Wait a little longer.

16
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,800
Kid.

17
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:38,590
Are you fooling me?

18
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:40,910
If you can't decide,

19
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,440
I'll go to He Jiashu.

20
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:44,230
Don't.

21
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,630
Let's talk outside.

22
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:46,680
Not here.

23
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:49,590
You're afraid people will know

24
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:51,040
about my relationship with your cousin,

25
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:54,360
but I'm his real father,

26
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,270
so why couldn't they know?

27
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,190
Stop it.

28
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:02,120
Don't worry.

29
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,120
I came here to ask for money

30
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:06,160
not to cause trouble.

31
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,270
I'll leave

32
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:09,830
as soon as I get the money.

33
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,120
I don't have that much money.

34
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:13,630
Now,

35
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:15,720
I'll ask my mom for lucky money.

36
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:17,630
How can lucky money be enough?

37
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:20,080
100,000.

38
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,720
Give me 100,000 now.

39
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,360
I don't have that much money. How can I give it to you?

40
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,360
But your parents have.

41
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,310
Go back and steal some.

42
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:31,720
What are you talking about?

43
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:33,760
It's okay if you don't want to.

44
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:36,230
I'm going to my son!

45
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:39,720
My son is gone!

46
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:40,630
Stop.

47
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:41,550
My son!

48
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:42,000
I'll do something.

49
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,190
- My son, where are you? - I'll do something.

50
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:43,800
I'll do something,

51
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,270
OK?

52
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,590
Guys!

53
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:48,680
Why is that guy yelling?

54
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,440
- I can't find my son! - What happened?

55
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,230
Let's go check it out.

56
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:52,000
My son!

57
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,120
Let's go check it out.

58
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:53,510
Let's go.

59
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:55,080
My son is gone.

60
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:56,760
My son!

61
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,230
I'll do something.

62
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:58,400
- Son, where are you? - I'll do something.

63
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,000
I'll do something,

64
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,630
OK?

65
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,400
I'll do something.

66
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:01,910
Right now.

67
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,160
Call your mom

68
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,040
and tell her to give me the money.

69
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,040
My mom won't approve.

70
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,680
She...

71
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:11,870
Hey.

72
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,080
Hey...

73
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:17,800
Everybody.

74
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:20,510
Listen to me!

75
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,120
I...

76
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,360
I...

77
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:28,360
I am He Jiashu's real father.

78
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,440
Stop.

79
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:30,480
And

80
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,440
- He Jiahao's uncle. - The only one?

81
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:33,440
Why is he here?

82
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:33,910
Right?

83
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:35,040
Do they know each other?

84
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,550
Since He Jiahao has that cousin,

85
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:41,160
he also has this uncle, me.

86
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:44,590
I'm in a bit of a bind

87
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:46,870
and want to borrow some money from the He family

88
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,630
for working capital,

89
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:49,590
but the He family

90
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:51,040
won't agree.

91
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:52,310
Stop!

92
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:54,830
Have you ever seen

93
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:56,950
such a cruel family?

94
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:02,870
And that guy in there, He Jiashu,

95
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,630
the one who was in the classroom

96
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:06,950
for He Jiahao's

97
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,870
parent-teacher conference.

98
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,160
He Jiashu!

99
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,830
Can you stand to see your father

100
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:16,270
go bankrupt and ignore me?

101
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:17,480
Stop the nonsense!

102
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:19,270
Nonsense?

103
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,550
Kids.

104
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:25,510
Everyone.

105
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:28,160
Go back

106
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,830
and ask your parents.

107
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:31,760
Eight years ago,

108
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:33,590
everyone knew

109
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:35,720
that He Jiashu's mom

110
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,720
cuckolded his dad.

111
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,000
That's not true.

112
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41,270
Cuckolded?

113
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,440
He Jiashu is not even the kid

114
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:47,400
of the He family's eldest son.

115
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:50,510
He is my,

116
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:53,480
Lin Junrong's,

117
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:55,230
biological son.

118
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,870
He's watching his father

119
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:00,590
die now.

120
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,550
I heard it from my mom.

121
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,550
His cousin He Jiashu

122
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,080
is really his mom's son with another man.

123
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,590
The man just doesn't seem like a good person.

124
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:12,950
Is he really that kind of guy?

125
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,480
His dad is angered by him to death.

126
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:24,310
Stop pretending to be sick.

127
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,590
He Jiahao, listen.

128
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,440
Either ask your cousin to come out

129
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:33,270
or ask your dad

130
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:34,800
to give me the money.

131
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:52,120
- He Jiahao. -The only one.

132
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:13,000
Stop pretending.

133
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,040
Jiashu.

134
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:35,950
Stop it, Jiashu.

135
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,040
Jiashu!

136
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:46,870
Brat...

137
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:26,040
Stop it.

138
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:27,360
Stop it...

139
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:35,870
What?

140
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:38,510
Do you think

141
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:39,440
I won't dare to hit you?

142
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:41,310
He Jiashu.

143
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,310
Lin Junrong.

144
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,800
Sir.

145
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,680
My head hurts.

146
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:51,830
I can't straighten my back either.

147
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,800
Didn't you reach an agreement on compensation?

148
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:54,870
Have you gone back on your word?

149
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:58,160
This brat

150
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,230
beat me

151
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:02,040
but is only paying me this little.

152
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,950
That's unreasonable.

153
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:05,400
Okay.

154
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:06,870
Go get your injuries evaluated.

155
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,800
Come back here after that

156
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:09,720
and continue the negotiation.

157
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:13,910
No.

158
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,160
I didn't mean that.

159
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:17,830
We had a deal.

160
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,400
We had a deal.

161
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:20,760
Had a deal?

162
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,950
Yes.

163
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:24,310
Okay.

164
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,040
No more fighting.

165
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,000
If you do it again,

166
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:28,190
it won't be that easy.

167
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:29,590
I won't.

168
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:30,510
I won't.

169
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:31,550
I'll

170
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:33,510
obey the law

171
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,680
and won't give you any more trouble.

172
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,080
Here's the settlement agreement.

173
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:40,080
Take a look.

174
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:41,590
Sign it if it's okay.

175
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:46,000
Sir.

176
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:49,630
Are you Lin Junrong?

177
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,310
Yes,

178
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:52,360
I am.

179
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,590
You came to Xiqiao from Chaozhou?

180
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,550
Yes.

181
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:58,190
Someone called the police

182
00:09:58,190 --> 00:09:59,550
to report you for extortion.

183
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,310
Stay and be investigated.

184
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,440
Sir,

185
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:09,040
please.

186
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:10,680
I was wrongly accused.

187
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,160
There's no such thing.

188
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,190
We'll know

189
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:14,720
if you've been wrongly accused after we investigate.

190
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:16,060
He Jiashu.

191
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,180
Someone is coming to pick you up.

192
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:18,760
Get your things and go.

193
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:20,870
Jiashu.

194
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:21,720
- What are you doing? - Jiashu!

195
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:22,230
Sit down.

196
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:22,680
Don't move.

197
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,230
Jiashu!

198
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:23,910
Sit down.

199
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:25,400
Don't move!

200
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:26,400
Don't move!

201
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:26,800
Even...

202
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:28,830
Even after beating me up, you're still angry?

203
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:29,630
Sit still.

204
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,190
Brat!

205
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,310
I'm your real father!

206
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,630
Explain it to them.

207
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:36,230
Don't move!

208
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,270
Where are you, Long?

209
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:50,870
I don't see you.

210
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,950
I'm at the martial arts school. I can't go there.

211
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:53,870
Come back alone.

212
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:25,270
What did you

213
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:27,400
come back for this time?

214
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,510
Uncle.

215
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,950
I remember when I was little,

216
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,080
you loved to bring us here for morning tea.

217
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,160
Dad.

218
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:06,870
Dad.

219
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:11,680
Dad.

220
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:14,830
My uncle took us for morning tea again.

221
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,510
We have your favorite shrimp dumplings.

222
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:20,310
Did your uncle

223
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:23,270
take you to eat again?

224
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:30,870
Dad.

225
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,720
Are you feeling better today?

226
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,510
Yes.

227
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,440
Hongxiao.

228
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:39,680
Don't worry.

229
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,760
I can take care of them.

230
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,120
Get well.

231
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:44,680
OK.

232
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:47,870
Dad.

233
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:48,870
Are you okay?

234
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:50,870
Hongxiao.

235
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:51,230
Dad.

236
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:55,040
I'll call the doctor.

237
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:56,510
Doctor.

238
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,360
Doctor.

239
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,360
Uncle.

240
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,510
Why is my sister-in-law like this?

241
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:10,040
She always stays in her hometown and ignores him.

242
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:11,800
Stop.

243
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:14,630
Jiashu.

244
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:15,550
Come on.

245
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,590
Eat the shrimp.

246
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:17,590
It's nutritious.

247
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:18,000
Come on.

248
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:19,630
Give me this.

249
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:21,120
Have some more.

250
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:24,510
Jiashu.

251
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,590
Shrimp.

252
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:37,100
[Jiashu]

253
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:43,800
Sorry, guys.

254
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,870
I won again.

255
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,120
I have to stop.

256
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,360
I've had terrible luck and keep losing.

257
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:49,910
How many rounds is this?

258
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,510
Your luck will come soon.

259
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:53,720
I'm going to visit Jiashu's father in the hospital.

260
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,160
I'm going to stop. Enjoy.

261
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,400
Is he hospitalized again?

262
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,480
Why is his health so bad?

263
00:14:59,000 --> 00:14:59,630
You guys carry on.

264
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:00,310
I'm leaving.

265
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:02,230
I'm coming.

266
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:05,160
I just got here,

267
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,160
but are you leaving?

268
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,230
I don't see you every day,

269
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:09,590
so who knows where you've been slutting around?

270
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:11,310
Pretty girl.

271
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:12,160
You missed me, didn't you?

272
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,190
Not at all.

273
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:16,000
Rong just came, but you're leaving.

274
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,800
Now sit down and play a few more rounds.

275
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:19,400
Look at that.

276
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:21,230
Being in the southeast

277
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,120
and with a mountain behind you.

278
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,360
The feng shui is good.

279
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:25,190
You'll be lucky.

280
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:27,120
Stay

281
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,550
and play a few more rounds with me.

282
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,120
I'll give you the tiles you want.

283
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:32,480
Let's cooperate.

284
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,160
I guarantee you'll turn the tables.

285
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,120
Don't go back on your word.

286
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:49,800
Jiashu.

287
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:51,680
Jiashu.

288
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:53,590
Jiashu.

289
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,400
Why are you here?

290
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:00,680
Your mom went to play mahjong and ignored you again, didn't she?

291
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:05,230
Have you eaten yet?

292
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:08,160
Let's go.

293
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,400
Get your stuff.

294
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:11,230
I'll take you to eat something delicious.

295
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,400
Thanks, Uncle.

296
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:24,040
Why did you do so poorly this time?

297
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:26,270
Tell me.

298
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,120
Are you in love

299
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:35,360
or did you go to an internet cafe behind my back?

300
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,000
I didn't.

301
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:38,270
You didn't?

302
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,800
Then what's going on here?

303
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,590
He Jiashu.

304
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:44,400
Do you still want to go to North China University?

305
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,230
I've never thought about North China University.

306
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,680
That's all in your head.

307
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:50,000
Okay.

308
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:52,270
I'm afraid I can't sign

309
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:53,190
for you

310
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,480
if you have that attitude.

311
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,000
So what?

312
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:57,590
Anyway, you're not my dad.

313
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:58,510
You're in no position to control me.

314
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:00,230
Stop right there.

315
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:02,950
Where are you going?

316
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:04,440
Kneeling in the ancestral hall.

317
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:05,870
You'll only give me this punishment, won't you?

318
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,590
You don't need to say that.

319
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:09,000
I'll go alone.

320
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:10,000
Come back.

321
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:13,830
Come back.

[Final paper. He Hongguang]

323
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,120
I don't know

324
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,680
why you're always so reluctant to compromise.

325
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:48,630
You'd save yourself a lot of trouble

326
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:49,950
if you'd just compromise,

327
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:51,310
you know?

328
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:52,590
Got it.

329
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,870
Thanks for signing for me.

330
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:58,440
You're just

331
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:00,040
too stubborn.

332
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,040
I always thought you were like someone.

333
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:03,800
Who could I be like?

334
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:04,760
It's got to be you.

335
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:05,550
You...

336
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:06,510
What did you say?

337
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:06,910
Uncle.

338
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:07,950
I'm going back to study.

339
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:09,080
I'm going to join him.

340
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:17,190
Like me?

341
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:17,870
Uncle.

342
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:19,950
To be honest,

343
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,230
at that time, I even secretly thought

344
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:24,000
that it would be great if you were my father,

345
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,310
but I didn't realize

346
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:32,550
that I

347
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,510
couldn't even be the son of the He family.

348
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:42,190
Uncle.

349
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,040
I know you hate me,

350
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,160
but I have no reason to hate you.

351
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:56,040
Why did you

352
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,950
come back this time?

353
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:02,440
My mom died,

354
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:03,550
so I have to cancel her account.

355
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,480
Apart from that,

356
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,550
there's another reason.

357
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:13,950
It has to do with Jiahao.

358
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:15,720
Jiahao has nothing to do with you,

359
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:19,400
and neither does the He family.

360
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:23,870
I know,

361
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:28,000
but Jiahao is related to you,

362
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:30,720
so I need to tell you.

363
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:34,040
Jiahao

364
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:37,550
has persistent symptoms of depression,

365
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:41,550
and the doctor has prescribed medication for him.

366
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,310
These days,

367
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,550
I took him to do some exercise

368
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,480
and training

369
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,870
to help him recover and heal,

370
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,080
but that alone was not enough.

371
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,720
What Hao needs

372
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:53,680
is the support and understanding of his family.

373
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:55,950
Uncle.

374
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:00,720
Too many people in this family are already unhappy,

375
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,590
so I don't want Hao to be either.

376
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,160
You said I hated you,

377
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,400
but you were wrong.

378
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,400
I don't hate you

379
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:24,870
because, to me,

380
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:27,590
you're just a stranger.

381
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,360
I don't want a stranger

382
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,000
to interfere with my son's life.

383
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:38,120
I know

384
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:39,190
Hao is depressed,

385
