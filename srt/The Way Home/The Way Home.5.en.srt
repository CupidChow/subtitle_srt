[Episode 5]

3
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,080
Hello. Are you okay?

4
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:41,960
Let me help you out.

5
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:43,900
Come and help.

6
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:45,100
Someone's fainted.

7
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:48,570
Be careful.

8
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:51,860
Jiahao.

9
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:52,600
Are you okay?

10
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,710
Take him to the infirmary, now.

11
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,290
Two years ago,

12
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:10,590
Hao ran away from home one day.

13
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,810
His family searched for him for a day and a night,

14
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:15,070
but couldn't find him.

15
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:18,670
When Hao came back,

16
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:19,740
he wouldn't say

17
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,480
where he'd been

18
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:22,720
or what he'd done.

19
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:40,910
Dad.

20
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:45,560
I'm going to college.

21
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:49,230
I'll report my arrival tomorrow. Don't worry.

22
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,110
Jiashu.

23
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:54,600
Answer the phone for me.

24
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:06,730
Hello?

25
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:09,100
Hello, is this Zhang Huiling?

26
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:09,670
Yes, it is.

27
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:12,010
We are the tenants of your old house.

28
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:15,000
I've given the agent the things you left behind

29
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,610
when you moved,

30
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:18,150
so you can ask him for them then.

31
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,080
Okay, thanks.

32
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:20,290
And,

33
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:21,500
by the way,

34
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:24,050
is there a He Jiashu in your family?

35
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:25,700
That's me.

36
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:26,700
A boy came to me earlier

37
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,890
to see you.

38
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:30,320
I thought of it, so I wanted to tell you.

39
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:33,550
What did he look like?

40
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:36,510
Fair-skinned and quite thin.

41
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:37,940
About fourteen or fifteen years old.

42
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:44,890
He Jiashu.

43
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:46,800
You finally answered the phone. That's great.

44
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,010
The teacher told me

45
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,480
he couldn't get through to you,

46
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:50,360
so he asked me, the monitor,

47
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,300
to talk to you on his behalf.

48
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,600
You've got a guaranteed place in the master's program now,

49
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,320
so wouldn't it be a pity for you to give it up?

50
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:59,080
We know that something has happened to your family,

51
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:00,380
but what the teacher means is

52
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,720
that if you have any difficulties,

53
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:02,730
I can talk to him for you,

54
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,420
and the teacher and your classmates will do their best to help you.

55
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:06,650
He Jiashu.

56
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:08,100
He Jiashu?

57
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:10,010
To Chaozhou South Railway Station.

58
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,710
Sorry. I'm late.

59
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:32,740
He Jiashu.

60
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:38,500
You don't look like you used to.

61
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,860
I wasn't even sure it was you.

62
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,240
Have a seat.

63
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:45,890
I didn't mean anything by it.

64
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:48,270
I'm just saying you've matured a lot.

65
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:52,690
By the way,

66
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:54,560
look at this.

67
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,850
The second from the back is Hao.

68
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:16,480
He's grown up.

69
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,770
Yes, even taller than you.

70
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,250
How's he doing?

71
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:35,290
Doesn't look good.

72
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:37,960
He always dozes off in class

73
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:38,700
and doesn't talk

74
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,350
to his classmates after class.

75
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,380
He's depressed,

76
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,990
but don't worry too much.

77
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,740
I think we may have been too pessimistic.

78
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:50,970
Now that you're back,

79
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,080
I think Hao will be fine.

80
00:05:57,970 --> 00:05:59,420
Actually, Hao has been contacting me.

81
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:01,950
He sends me messages

82
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:03,440
on QQ every once in a while.

83
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:05,000
The last time he messaged me

84
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:08,660
was about a year ago.

85
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:10,510
He's been messaging me less

86
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:11,830
and less frequently,

87
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,250
so I'm worried that something's happened to him,

88
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:18,200
but luckily I have you as an old classmate,

89
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:20,210
or I don't know who to turn to for help.

90
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:24,130
I'm his trainee teacher,

91
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:25,940
so caring about my students is what I should do.

92
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:30,500
He Jiashu, does the rest

93
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:32,800
of the He family know you are back?

94
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,300
I see.

95
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,670
I'll keep your secret.

96
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,660
I didn't think you'd come back for Hao.

97
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:46,990
Hao would be very happy

98
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,270
if he knew.

​I've seen plenty of students like you before.

146
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,500
Relying on your cleverness

147
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,440
and not studying hard.

148
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,130
​In the beginning, you were able to do well.

149
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:29,490
But let me tell you.

150
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:30,890
It doesn't take long before you realize you're not clever enough.

151
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:33,410
At that point, you will see your grades drop.

152
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,700
You're too young. Don't be so arrogant.

153
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,730
You play with these things all day long

154
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:40,450
and never do anything serious.

155
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:43,420
Your brother can row a dragon boat and win glory for the family,

156
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,450
but what have you done?

157
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:45,990
Why are you still pretending to be strong?

158
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:47,250
Do you know

159
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,350
that If anything happens to you,

160
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:50,100
the whole martial arts school will go down because of you?

161
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:50,660
You're hurting others and yourself.

162
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,220
Did you know that?

163
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:53,230
You haven't changed a bit

164
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,200
after all these years.

165
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:57,970
You are always self-righteous

166
00:09:57,970 --> 00:09:59,100
and end up implicating others.

167
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,960
The more you try to prove that past mistakes can be undone,

168
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:03,470
the more you prove

169
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,550
that they can't be.

170
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:06,650
Jiahao.

171
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:09,790
Jiahao.

172
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:11,810
Jiahao.

173
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:20,430
Jiahao, you're awake.

174
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,730
How are you feeling?

175
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,140
Don't worry.

176
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:37,580
Chen Afu, who locked you in the toilet,

177
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:39,550
has been criticized by Mr. Zhang.

178
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:41,710
The teachers will protect you.

179
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,100
Ma'am, I'm fine.

180
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:56,270
I'm going back to class.

181
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:56,990
Wait a minute.

182
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,450
The doctor will check you again.

183
00:10:58,970 --> 00:10:59,670
Dr. Chen.

184
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:06,080
Jiahao.

185
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,090
We'll have to do another checkup.

186
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:09,110
Unbutton it.

187
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,610
Jiahao, how do you feel?

188
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,150
Do you feel sick?

I'm fine.

190
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:32,710
Maybe I didn't sleep well last night

191
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:35,260
and was a bit anxious just now.

192
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:40,560
There's probably nothing wrong

193
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,860
with your health,

194
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:45,470

[Mental Health Self-Test]

196
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,060
What's wrong with him today?

197
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:35,510
Why did he suddenly faint?

198
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:37,870
Should he go to the hospital?

199
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:40,610
I just gave him a preliminary checkup.

200
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:43,500
There is no major problem with his body,

201
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,230
so I think

202
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:48,150
fainting due to convulsions

203
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:49,460
is more of a psychological problem.

204
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:50,850
That's why

205
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:53,340
I gave him a simple psychological test.

206

This morning, Jiahao was late for a whole class

207
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,440

No, nothing. Everything's fine,

but no problem is a problem.

215
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,200
The kid just woke up unusually calm.

216

about Jiahao at home lately.

265
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:17,230
Is it because he didn't do well in his last exam

266
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:18,380
and was criticized by me?

267
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:19,790

that for so many kids, the more stress they have,

273
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:35,560
the worse they play.

00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:47,630
I'm talking to you.

377
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:48,960
Why are you ignoring me?

378
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:51,160
What have you got there?

379
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:52,200
Show me.

380
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:52,990
Don't touch it.

381
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:54,700
Get your dirty hands off it.

382
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:56,380
What's wrong with me touching it?

383
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,040
Why are you so angry?

384
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:06,500
I thought it was some kind of treasure,

385
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:08,010
but it was just a lantern.

386
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:09,920
Did you make it?

387
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,350
It's kind of ugly.

388
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:13,990
In the shape of a rabbit.

389
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:15,190
But it's true.

390
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:17,300
That's the kind of garish stuff you like.

391
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,270
Give it back!

392
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:19,230
You want it?

393
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:20,480
Then I won't give it to you.

394
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,180
Give it back!

395
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:27,620
Everyone, take a look!

396
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:29,420
This is the lantern made by the He family's only child.

397
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:31,420
Take a look!

398
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:32,220
Afu.

399
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:33,700
Give it back to him.

400
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:34,570
It's time for class.

401
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,680
It's really not that unusual,

402
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:39,950
but

403
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:43,990
I just don't want to give it back.

404
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,010
You're hitting me just for a stupid lantern?

405
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:08,180
Hello, ma'am.

406
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:09,330
Ms. Qiu.

407
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,780
Jiahao is going to be a senior in high school soon,

408
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:13,770
but we, as parents, can't help him at all

409
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:16,100
when it comes to his studies,

410
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,570
so we need to ask you

411
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:18,580
to be more attentive to him.

412
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:22,970
This is the most critical moment in his life,

413
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:24,700
so he can't afford to slack off.

414
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:26,190
Mr. He, don't worry.

415
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:27,690
Our school never slacks

416
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:28,610
on teaching.

417
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:29,180
Understood.

418
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:32,020
Teachers will be devoted to their students,

419
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:33,630
but I'm still concerned

420
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:35,810
about his emotional problems.

421
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:36,920
I know.

422
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,340
A balance between study and rest, right?

423
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:41,500
Physical health is the foundation of everything.

424
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,170
Don't worry. Starting today,

425
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,940
I'll make sure he goes to bed early every night.

426
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:48,640
Actually, that's not what I meant.

427
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,790
What I mean is...

428
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:53,210
Stop it.

429
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:54,260
Stop it.

430
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:55,690
Stop it.

431
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:57,400
Stop it.

432
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,950
He Jiahao, stop!

433
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,350
Stop it!

434
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:01,420
Stop it.

435
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:03,650
He Jiahao, stop.

436
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:04,250
Stop it!

437
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:04,970
He Jiahao.

438
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:06,340
He Jiahao. Chen Afu.

439
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:08,020
Stop it!

440
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:08,590
Stop it!

441
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,150
Stop it!

442
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:11,230
You guys, stop!

443
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,140
He Jiahao!

444
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:14,760
He Jiahao!

445
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:16,200
Get up!

446
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:19,350
Dad?

447
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,740
He Jiahao.

448
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:23,620
You even dare fight at school, huh?

449
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:25,180
Good.

450
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:29,200
Ms. Qiu, I'm going to take a leave of absence for Jiahao.

451
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,850
I'll take him back and give him a lesson.

452
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:31,820
Wait, Mr. He.

453
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:32,250
Come with me.

454
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:32,720
Dad.

455
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,700
Mr. He, you...

456
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:34,840
Mr. He, calm down.

457
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:35,460
Let's go.

458
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:53,700
Get in the car.

459
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:22,200
Hello?

460
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:23,400
It's me.

461
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:25,640
What's going on today?

462
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:27,340
He doesn't seem

463
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:30,720
to look right.

464
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,240
Don't worry about it. It's nothing serious.

465
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:35,540
He just had a fight with a classmate,

466
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:37,470
and his dad took him back.

467
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:41,940
Didn't I tell you to throw it away?

468
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Why are you still playing with these things

469
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,400
that interfere with your studies?

470
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:50,760
You've really grown up

471
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,510
and gotten tough.

472
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:56,430
You're even getting into fights.

473
00:26:57,210 --> 00:26:59,170
You're getting bold.

474
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:03,380
I haven't let you play with this stuff since you were a kid.

475
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:05,660
How many times have I said that?

476
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:09,250
How many years have I been saying that?

477
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:10,930
Why don't you change yourself?

478
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:14,540
Have you ignored everything I've said?

479
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:19,350
Just for this thing,

480
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:23,020
you lie, fight,

481
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:25,680
and even ignore what I say.

482
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:28,470
This thing is a scourge.

483
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,130
I can't keep it.

484
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:31,410
Do you have any more in your room?

485
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,320
I'm getting rid of them all today.

486
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,860
No, Dad.

487
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:35,810
Dad, it's my fault.

488
00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:36,800
You can throw away all those things in there,

489
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:37,710
but not this.

490
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:39,050
This is for Jiashu. You can't.

491
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:39,770
Dad, it's my fault.

492
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:40,370
His things?

493
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:41,130
No, Dad.

494
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:42,690
If it's his stuff, we can't keep it!

495
00:27:44,770 --> 00:27:45,570
Dad!

496
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:56,640
Do you have any more of his things in your room?

497
00:27:57,450 --> 00:27:58,350
Take them all out.

498
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,900
I have to get rid of them all today.

499
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:04,330
Didn't you say

500
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:05,540
that my brother had done the family honor

501
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:06,890
and was the glory of the family?

502
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:11,970
Now,

503
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,930
you can't even stand a lantern?

504
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:24,180
It wasn't his fault

505
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:25,170
back then.

506
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:26,680
He was innocent.

507
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,000
It wasn't his fault?

508
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,500
Say that to your uncle's tablet.

509
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,410
Say that to the He family's ancestors.

510
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:37,480
Ask them if the He family

511
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,770
can stand this illegitimate child.

512
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:43,480
You want to speak for this illegitimate child,

513
00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:46,820
but who speaks for your uncle?

514
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:36,860
Hello?

515
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:38,700
Qiu, I have to tell you

516
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:39,640
there's still a problem

517
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,900
with that student's mental health self-test

518
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:41,930
you brought in today.

519
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,630
He Jiahao?

520
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:44,110
Yes.

521
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:45,850
Didn't you say he was fine?

522
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:47,200
I asked a classmate of mine

523
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,160
who's a psychiatrist at the hospital.

524
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:52,040
He said there's a group of kids who are very smart

525
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:54,200
and will deliberately hide their condition.

526
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:57,600
It's often more complicated and dangerous.

527
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:59,590
If they're not treated in time,

528
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,170
their condition can worsen.

529
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,410
Okay. Thank you.

530
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:04,820
I'll contact the parents right away.

531
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:05,570
Okay.

532
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:31,110
Hello, Ms. Qiu.

533
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,390
Yes.

534
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:34,390
He was criticized by his dad

535
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:36,160
as soon as he came back.

536
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,330
Now he's in his room reflecting.

537
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:43,430
He has mental problems?

538
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:45,760
Really?

539
00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:48,800
He's been criticized by his dad since he was a kid.

540
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,620
There were many harsher criticisms than that,

541
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:51,750
but he was always fine.

542
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,730
I think

543
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:55,650
he's just psychologically stressed out.

544
00:30:55,650 --> 00:30:56,460
Keep your voice down.

545
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:57,560
He's not sleeping well.

546
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,080
He's studying.

547
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,580
Words and phrases

548
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:08,260
can be used to form sentences,

549
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:09,600
but the problem is...

550
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:11,530
Ms. Qiu.

551
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:13,010
Jiahao is fine.

552
00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:14,560
He is studying in his room.

553
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:18,820
He and his dad do this all the time.

554
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:21,190
Actually, his dad wasn't really mad at him today.

555
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:21,790
After he was criticized,

556
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:23,050
it was over.

557
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:25,080
Just now, he was concerned about Jiahao's studies.

558
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,150
Have you been to his room?

559
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:29,040
Are you sure he's okay?

560
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:32,290
Yes. I'm at the door of his room now.

561
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:34,360
He's really fine. Thank you.

562
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,640
Okay. That's good.

563
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:38,890
And, ma'am,

564
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,060
could you give him the phone

565
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:42,920
and let me talk to him alone?

566
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:46,490
He's studying now.

567
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:48,200
I can't disturb him.

568
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,310
Don't worry. He's really fine.

569
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,670
If there's anything,

570
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:54,160
you can talk to him tomorrow after he goes to school,

571
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,050
okay?

572
00:31:56,170 --> 00:31:57,100
I have to cook.

573
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:58,250
I'm hanging up now.

574
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:00,700
I'm...

575
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:02,700
I was on the phone,

576
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:03,600
but why did you keep talking?

577
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,640
Go away.

578
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,280
Don't panic.

579
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,090
If you can understand the types of phrases

580
00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:13,540
and know what function each of them serves,

581
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:25,140
you'll be able to analyze sentences

582
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:27,360
as clearly as you just did,

583
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,800
[Ms. Qiu]
so we're going to learn about the types

584
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,490
and uses of phrases in this lesson.

585
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:34,520
The number you have dialed is temporarily unavailable.

586
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:44,870
Chen Long'an.

587
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:46,360
Qiu Qiu, the study commissary.

588
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,100
Where is He Jiashu? I'm looking for him urgently.

589
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,570
How do you know Jiashu lives here?

590
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,150
Qiu Qiu.

591
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,330
Something may have happened to Jiahao.
