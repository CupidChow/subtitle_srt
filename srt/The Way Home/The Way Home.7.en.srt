00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:12,930
I can see

192
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,050
you're pretty fond of her yourself.

193
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,290
So,

194
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,610
why not just go for it?

195
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,050
Don't smear my name.

196
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,530
I'm not married yet.

197
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:21,370
Hey.

198
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:22,530
I'm trying to help you here.

199
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:23,740
Don't be ungrateful.

200
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:28,490
You're the type to end up alone.

201
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:46,730
Ma'am.

202
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,330
What's the matter, Junli?

203
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,410
I think He Jiahao

204
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:52,690
is being pestered by someone.

205
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:53,650
Something feels off.

206
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:56,250
Have you seen the person?

207
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:58,370
A middle-aged man

208
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,570
came by the school a few days ago looking for him.

209
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,490
He claimed to be a friend of He Jiahao's father.

210
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:03,730
But I checked

211
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,290
and there's no such person in the He family.

212
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:07,690
Also, there's something else...

213
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,170
Ruonan?

214
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:45,210
I'm so sorry...

215
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:47,090
I didn't know it was you. I'm sorry.

216
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:48,490
It's okay.

217
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:50,530
I'm sorry.

218
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:52,330
I'll be fine after a little rest.

219
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:52,930
Are you all right?

220
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:01,370
Use this.

221
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:02,370
It should help.

222
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:03,690
Thank you.

223
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:06,570
Sorry.

224
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:07,730
I didn't know it was you.

225
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,650
I thought it was some kind of creep.

226
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:12,090
That was a bit much, you know.

227
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:15,890
I'm not disfigured, am I?

228
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:18,130
You are not.

229
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:20,010
That's a relief.

230
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,890
I just can't shake the feeling

231
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,010
that someone's been watching me

232
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:26,530
and stalking me recently.

233
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:29,570
I didn't do it.

234
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:30,410
It's not me.

235
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:32,850
I know.

236
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:37,410
By the way,

237
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:39,130
why are you following me?

238
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:43,010
I...

239
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:45,850
I'm on my way home.

240
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:46,970
It's in the same direction.

241
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:53,330
Isn't your home in that direction?

242
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,490
I just want to take a walk by the river

243
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:01,810
and clear my mind. Anything wrong with that?

244
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:04,170
Nothing.

245
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:06,690
What are you doing by the river then?

246
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:12,530
I...

247
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:14,650
Are you here to unwind?

248
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:17,250
Yes.

249
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:19,170
Really?

250
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,530
You're not here to meet someone, are you?

251
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:24,810
No.

252
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:25,770
I'm by myself.

253
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:33,210
Let's leave now.

254
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:35,530
Wait. My backpack.

255
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:36,770
Hurry. Let's go.

256
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:39,290
What are you doing?

257
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:41,210
Keep it down.

258
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:42,170
Ms. Qiu Qiu is over there.

259
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,290
You claim you're just here to unwind,

260
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:01,570
but you're obviously up to something

261
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,050
and scared the teacher will find out.

262
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:06,850
I only hid because you dragged me.

263
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,690
It's just a conditioned response, isn't it?

264
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:10,810
When I see the teacher, I just want to hide.

265
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:15,330
Sorry.

266
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:16,130
I'm late.

267
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,650
No worries. I just got here myself.

268
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:18,930
Let's go.

269
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:27,170
Look at that guy next to Ms. Qiu Qiu.

270
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,210
Could he be her boyfriend?

271
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:36,890
Do you come here often?

272
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:38,570
It's not crowded here.

273
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:40,980
Jiashu.

274
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:44,330
Your cousin?

275
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:49,050
Jiahao.

276
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:51,010
Ruonan?

277
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,330
Ma'am, I admit it.

278
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:08,930
I did take time off before

279
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:10,130
to train,

280
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:11,890
but I did it alone.

281
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,050
It had nothing to do with my cousin.

282
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:16,010
So, could you please

283
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:17,610
not tell my dad?

284
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:19,610
I know.

285
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,130
You know?

286
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:28,290
Do you really think

287
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:30,890
that without Ms. Qiu,

288
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:32,450
you could hide it from your dad

289
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:33,450
and train every day?

290
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:37,850
You two...

291
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:39,090
Let me introduce her to you properly.

292
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,370
This is my middle school classmate,

293
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:42,130
Qiu Qiu.

294
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:46,850
- Qiu... - Qiu...

295
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:50,250
- Classmate? - Classmate?

296
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:55,130
So Jiashu's back,

297
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:57,450
and all those early mornings and late nights

298
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,290
are because you're learning dragon boating from him?

299
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:02,650
I didn't mean to hide it from you before,

300
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:03,050
I just...

301
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:05,090
So you rush to leave every day after school,

302
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:07,250
holding your phone,

303
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,100
distracted all the time,

304
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:13,050
is it also because of Jiashu?

305
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:18,970
I knew it.

306
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:20,290
A reserved person like you

307
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:21,090
couldn't possibly be dating early.

308
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:30,250
Don't worry.

309
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:31,690
Your secret regarding Jiashu

310
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:32,810
is safe with me.

311
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:35,570
Thank you.

312
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:37,850
It's no big deal,

313
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:39,930
but you need to watch out.

314
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:41,170
That annoying Chen Junli

315
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:43,770
practically wants to keep tabs on you all the time.

316
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:46,450
I'm sure I'm not the only one

317
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:47,730
who's noticed your strange behavior lately.

318
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:51,970
By the way,

319
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:53,690
do you really want to join

320
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,210
this year's dragon boat race?

321
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:03,850
All right.

322
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:05,570
I'll help you

323
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:07,290
all the way through.

324
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:08,730
You'll help me?

325
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:09,650
That's right.

326
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,690
When you're training,

327
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:12,980
someone has to bring water and time you.

328
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:14,970
Given your level of skills,

329
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:17,210
it's tough enough for Jiashu to train you.

330
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:19,570
There has to be someone taking care of the chores, right?

331
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,370
But we...

332
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,490
Apart from me, who else in this town

333
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,610
would be willing to help you?

334
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:31,450
Okay.

335
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:33,610
It's a deal then.

336
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:39,370
By the way,

337
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:43,820
you mentioned a middle-aged man

338
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:44,890
came to the school to see Jiahao.

339
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:49,210
Maybe it was a mistake

340
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,610
or a misunderstanding.

341
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:51,570
It wasn't a misunderstanding.

342
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:53,530
Do you know him?

343
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:58,570
Thanks a lot

344
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:01,690
for looking after Jiahao recently.

345
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:03,650
Well,

346
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,090
I'm his teacher,

347
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:06,730
so it's only natural for me to help him.

348
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,450
Also, I contacted you

349
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:11,090
because I think you might be able

350
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,010
to help Jiahao.

351
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,210
I... I didn't mean to bring up Jiahao's situation

352
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:17,220
to start a conversation with you.

353
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,730
I... I wasn't trying to approach you on purpose.

354
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:19,970
Study monitor,

355
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:21,970
you've become more talkative lately.

356
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:26,220
Jiahao,

357
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:29,530
it's time to train.

358
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:31,130
Got it!

359
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:32,730
I'm going as well.

360
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:43,570
Why don't you

361
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:45,130
go back first?

362
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:47,170
It's not necessary to trouble you just yet.

363
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:48,810
It's no trouble.

364
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:51,530
I don't want to go home after school anyway,

365
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,730
so I might as well find something to do here.

366
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:56,500
What would you like to drink?

367
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:58,810
I...

368
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:00,450
I'll decide for you.

369
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:06,930
That girl from the Chen family

370
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:08,690
seems to care a lot about you, huh?

371
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,530
We

372
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:13,490
are also classmates.

373
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:16,970
The friendship between classmates, huh?

374
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:18,970
That's nice.

375
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:23,130
By the way,

376
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:24,490
your teacher, Qiu,

377
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,730
is joining us

378
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,010
for training today.

379
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:29,730
You're already here, so might as well.

380
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:32,130
Then I'll time you.

381
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:33,370
You've got this, Jiahao.

382
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:36,930
Let's go then.

383
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:39,170
Time to train!

384
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:42,970
Jiashu, it hurts.

385
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:43,650
Bear with it.

386
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:45,170
It hurts.

387
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:52,010
Wait.

388
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:52,450
My bone's broken.

389
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:56,380
Is it broken?

390
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:58,850
I'm messing with you.

391
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:04,290
Ouch!

392
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:05,370
You!

393
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,170
Ouch!

394
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:08,570
You do the other side yourself.

395
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:15,940
Ready?

396
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:17,050
Let's do this.

397
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:18,570
- Bring it on. - Run along the path.

398
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:27,890
Faster!

399
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,050
Are you taking a stroll or something?

400
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:32,770
You've got this!

401
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:35,290
Speed up.

402
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:42,570
He Jiahao,

403
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:44,890
keep going!

404
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:53,290
Speed up!

405
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:57,340
Three,

406
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:58,260
two,

407
00:23:58,820 --> 00:23:59,620
one.

408
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,090
How did I do?

409
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:02,210
Not too bad.

410
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:03,220
Let me have a look.

411
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:03,940
Let me check.

412
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:06,020
Yes! I'm getting better!

413
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:06,850
Tired?

414
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:07,740
No.

415
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:08,420
Feel good?

416
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:08,860
Yes.

417
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,050
Time for frog jumps.

418
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:10,490
Let's continue.

419
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:10,890
Let's go.

420
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:15,250
I remember Jiashu and Jiahao

421
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:16,650
were always this happy when they were little,

422
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:17,290
right?

423
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:22,130
When I was little,

424
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:24,690
our house was close to the He family's.

425
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:28,290
Back then, I was a loner

426
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,250
with no playmates.

427
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:32,170
I would always sit in the alley behind our house.

428
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:35,850
The alley faced the He family's ancestral hall.

429
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:39,650
I would often see Jiashu and Jiahao

430
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:41,290
running around in the yard.

431
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:45,810
Every time I heard their laughter,

432
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:47,850
I couldn't help but feel envious.

433
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:50,410
Yes.

434
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,210
Back then, He Jiashu

435
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:53,490
wasn't like he is now.

436
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:57,940
No wonder.

437
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:00,210
No wonder what?

438
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:03,330
Young love

439
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:04,170
is the most unforgettable.

440
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:07,090
Chen Ruonan,

441
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:09,010
you are still a kid, don't speak out of turn.

442
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:10,450
Ma'am,

443
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:13,050
you were even younger than I am

444
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:14,210
when you had a secret crush on Jiashu.

445
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:21,450
But

446
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:24,210
it's been a while since I saw Jiahao smile like that.

447
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:30,490
27.

448
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:31,690
28.

449
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:32,730
29.

450
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:33,890
30!

451
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:35,330
Well done.

452
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:36,010
I can't go on, Jiashu.

453
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:37,730
Here's some water.

454
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:39,210
Thanks.

455
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:42,290
Listen, don't push yourself too hard.

456
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:44,410
You can't become an expert overnight.

457
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:45,930
If he doesn't give it his all, how's he going to make it?

458
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:46,890
With his skills,

459
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:47,890
the boat will sink before it even starts moving.

460
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,410
Didn't you know about that?

461
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:55,540
What about my water?

462
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:58,970
I don't have enough money,

463
00:25:58,980 --> 00:25:59,850
so I can only buy one bottle.

464
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:03,530
Is it that you don't have enough money,

465
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:04,890
or you just don't want to buy it?

466
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:06,690
Isn't there still one more bottle?

467
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:08,810
This is for Ms. Qiu Qiu.

468
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:09,890
You didn't run.

469
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:10,570
So why are you asking for water?

470
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,290
If you need more, I'll get you another bottle.

471
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:16,210
Thanks.

472
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:24,250
Take a seat.

473
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:36,370
What kind of service do you need?

474
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:37,610
I'm here to apply for a residence certificate.

475
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:38,490
I'm the property owner,

476
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,210
[ID Card Application]
and he's the tenant.

477
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:40,090
Okay.

478
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:41,050
Please wait a moment.

479
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:41,930
Okay, thank you.

480
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:43,650
Once it is ready,

481
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:45,210
you can come collect it yourself next time.

482
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:46,410
All right. Thank you.

483
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:47,210
You are welcome.

484
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:48,980
Juan.

485
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:52,770
Fang.

486
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:54,100
[Xiqiao Police Station]

487
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:55,180
Fang,

488
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:56,890
how come you got transferred here?

489
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:57,570
Yes.

490
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:59,490
I've been here for a while now.

491
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,770
I meant to greet you,

492
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:01,930
but didn't expect to run into you here.

493
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:02,570
What a coincidence!

494
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:03,810
I know, right?

495
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:05,050
We haven't seen each other in so long.

496
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:06,970
When you have some time off, come over to my place for a meal.

497
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:07,970
Definitely.

498
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:09,690
I also want to pay a visit to Uncle He.

499
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:10,490
Great.

500
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:12,460
By the way,

501
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:14,530
your sister-in-law passed away.

502
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:15,890
Your nephew came over a few days ago

503
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:16,730
to handle the household registration cancellation.

504
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:17,690
Did you hear about it?

505
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:19,370
What are you talking about?

506
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:20,570
My sister-in-law is perfectly fine at home.

507
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:21,330
Don't make up nonsense.

508
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:22,730
No.

509
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,290
I wasn't referring to your second sister-in-law.

510
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:26,690
I meant your eldest sister-in-law and your eldest nephew.

511
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:28,130
Jiashu?

512
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:47,730
Your nephew

513
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,410
seems to have come back alone this time.

514
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,250
He looks a lot more mature

515
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:52,970
than he did eight years ago.

516
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:55,650
This kid has really had a rough time.

517
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,250
He lost his father when he was little,

518
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:59,930
and now, he's lost his mother at such a young age.

519
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:02,010
I heard

520
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:03,730
his grandparents from Chaozhou

521
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:04,450
have also passed away.

522
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:07,570
Now, he's the only one left in the household registration.

523
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:09,250
This child

524
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:11,410
is truly unfortunate.

525
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:19,010
What are you waiting here for?

526
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:19,770
Go inside.

527
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:20,850
Go have some food.

528
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:22,930
Nothing.

529
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:25,170
Where are you going?

530
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:28,130
There's a problem at the factory again.

531
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:29,330
I have to go deal with it.

533
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:36,330
What's wrong?

534
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:37,970
Do you need to talk to me about something?

535
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:41,250
Not really.

536
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:42,770
Drive safe.

537
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:44,450
Don't worry.

538
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:50,570
Hello.

539
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:52,010
Bro,

540
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:53,930
I know.

541
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:57,410
Dad,

542
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:58,970
I added a lot of ingredients

543
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:00,330
to this congee.

544
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:01,690
Let me serve you some more.

545
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:06,490
Where's Hao?

546
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:08,050
Why hasn't he come down yet?

547
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:09,970
He's gone for extra lessons.

548
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:11,930
Has he been taking extra lessons recently?

549
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:12,970
It's probably because he's in his second year

550
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:13,650
of high school now,

551
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:15,130
so he has to push harder.

552
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:16,210
Honestly,

553
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:18,010
he's been attending so many extra classes lately.

554
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:19,890
It's hard work being a student.

555
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:23,740
Go ahead and eat.

556
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:26,010
Have some fish.

557
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:27,930
This fish gets cold easily,

558
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:28,890
and it won't taste good once it's cold.

559
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:29,850
Exactly.

560
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:30,610
Thanks, Dad.

561
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:40,170
Dad.

562
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:41,930
Time to take your medicine.

563
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:42,850
Okay.

564
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:54,690
All right,

565
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:55,970
go back to bed.

566
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:07,010
You've been so hesitant

567
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:08,330
