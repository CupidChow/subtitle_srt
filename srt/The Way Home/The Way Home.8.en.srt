00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:21,300
[Episode 8]

3
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:24,080
I was pretty lucky earlier.

4
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,240
It was the last one,

5
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,430
and an older man had taken it,

6
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:27,470
but he was kind enough to give it to me.

7
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:28,950
Lucky you indeed.

8
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:32,680
I have to say,

9
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,950
the man earlier was kind of handsome.

10
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,790
He was wearing a floral shirt,

11
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:38,310
but he had too much oil in his hair,

12
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,360
which made it look a bit greasy.

13
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,310
Excuse me, sir,

14
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:50,590
can the food be served a bit faster, please?

15
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,240
What's wrong, Jiashu?

16
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,240
I want to go to the bathroom.

17
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,470
Excuse me.

18
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,430
Are our dishes ready?

19
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:08,520
Shu.

20
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,110
You must help me.

21
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,200
Just once.

22
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:12,470
One last time.

23
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,040
When my nightclub opens,

24
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:15,840
I'll pay you back when I make money.

25
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,520
I told you

26
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,310
I had no money.

27
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,200
I already paid the deposit.

28
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,750
If I can't pay the balance,

29
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,150
I can't take the deposit back.

30
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,720
And I'll go broke.

31
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,360
Get out of here.

32
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:28,630
Get out!

33
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:33,630
That was your cousin, right?

34
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:36,270
If you don't have any money, I'll ask him.

35
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,310
The He family is rich.

36
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:39,880
They can't be without money.

37
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:48,590
Stay away from him.

38
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,840
Do you hear me?

39
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:50,790
Do you hear me?

40
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,750
Jiashu, stop!

41
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:52,560
Jiashu.

42
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:57,790
Are you okay?

43
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,520
I heard you.

44
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,150
You're looking for Jiashu

45
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:10,270
for money.

46
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,310
Tell me.

47
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,150
How much money do you need

48
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,880
to disown him?

49
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,240
Okay, I'll give it to you.

50
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,000
Count the money. It's exactly 500 yuan.

51
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,720
Kid.

52
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,360
What do you mean?

53
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,310
Am I a beggar?

54
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:36,360
I'm talking about half a million.

55
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:45,520
Fifty thousand.

56
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:48,080
Disown Jiashu.

57
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,880
We'll get a lawyer and go through the legal process.

58
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:52,310
If you disagree,

59
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,630
I won't give you this fifty thousand.

60
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:58,630
Jiashu.

61
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,630
You wanted me to sign

62
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:02,270
the property transfer agreement, right?

63
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:03,880
I'll sign it.

64
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:09,560
All right.

65
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:11,000
Fifty thousand. That's a deal.

66
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:15,110
Okay.

67
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,590
However,

68
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:18,880
I need some time.

69
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:21,470
I'll call you when the money is ready.

70
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:23,790
Let's go, Jiashu.

71
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,310
Come on.

72
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:33,910
Jiashu.

73
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:35,520
Don't worry.

74
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,590
I will protect you.

75
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,630
I'll think of something.

76
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,520
It's useless.

77
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,680
He's a bottomless pit.

78
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,790
Money won't solve the problem.

79
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:47,840
Don't worry about it.

80
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,880
Tell me the truth.

81
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:55,000
How long has he been pestering you?

82
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,200
Don't lie to me. I can tell.

83
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:01,680
It was not the first time he came to you.

84
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,950
He came to us ever

85
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:14,000
since my mom and I left the He family

86
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:17,680
and came to Chaozhou.

87
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,790
It's me, Huiling.

88
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:24,430
What are you doing here?

89
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:25,430
I told you

90
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:26,150
not to come to my place.

91
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:27,000
Get out of here.

92
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,680
You wouldn't give me the money.

93
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:32,110
What can I do?

94
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:33,880
Where's the money?

95
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:35,680
Where did you put the money?

96
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:37,270
I can give you the money.

97
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,310
Get out of here first.

98
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:40,680
All right.

99
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,470
I'll leave as soon as I get the money.

100
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:51,270
Every time I ask you for money,

101
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:52,400
it's troublesome.

102
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:55,630
I can only come

103
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:57,080
to your house to look for money.

104
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:58,680
You've got the money now.

105
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,840
Get out of here.

106
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,590
Jiashu will be home from school soon.

107
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,310
That's great.

108
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,790
It's time for us,

109
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:09,630
father and son, to meet.

110
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:12,240
Pour me some tea.

111
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:14,240
Lin Junrong.

112
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,720
You told me you would leave when you got the money,

113
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,000
and you won't go after Jiashu.

114
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:18,240
What's wrong?

115
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,360
Is Jiashu ashamed of me

116
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,430
as a father?

117
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,310
Or is he ashamed

118
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:26,430
because he is an illegitimate child?

119
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,080
Shut up!

120
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:32,430
I'm telling you.

121
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,630
If you don't want to get Jiashu in trouble,

122
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,950
be good and give me money.

123
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:42,040
Otherwise,

124
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,470
I'll go to his school

125
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:45,360
and tell his classmates

126
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,630
about his origins.

127
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,560
Is there any money in there?

128
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:53,360
Get out of here.

129
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,270
Get out.

130
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:55,240
You're annoying.

131
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,720
Do you know who I am?

132
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,430
I'm your father.

133
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:17,790
I'm your real father!

134
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:18,430
How dare you hit me?

135
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:19,400
My father died a long time ago.

136
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:21,630
Get out of here!

137
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:22,110
Jiashu.

138
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:24,470
All right.

139
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:25,360
All right.

140
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,790
I already got the money.

141
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,240
I

142
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:31,000
won't dispute with you today.

143
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:34,240
See you next time.

144
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,110
Sorry, Shu.

145
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:48,470
I'm sorry.

146
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:24,910
Hello.

147
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,430
Hello, Huiling.

148
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,560
I'm short of money these days.

149
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,080
Transfer me some money.

150
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,750
I just transferred the money to you.

151
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,950
You only gave me 5000 last week.

152
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:36,750
That's very little money.

153
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:38,680
Give me more.

154
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,790
I'm begging you.

155
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:40,520
Leave me alone.

156
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,110
You're a bottomless pit.

157
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,150
Drop the act.

158
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,720
Aren't you keeping the He family's money?

159
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,680
Don't even think about it.

160
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,270
I left that money for Shu.

161
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,680
Dear teachers and students.

162
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,270
Welcome to the Voice of Youth

163
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:56,470
on the campus radio station at Chaozhou University.

164
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,270
We spread the news of the campus

165
00:08:58,270 --> 00:08:59,750
and follow the current affairs of the campus.

166
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:01,200
Lin Junrong, where are you?

167
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,590
What do you think?

168
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,040
I'm where I can see my son.

169
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:07,360
I've told you many times.

170
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:08,750
Come at me.

171
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:09,880
Don't come at Shu.

172
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,470
Wait for me at school.

173
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:11,950
Don't go anywhere.

174
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:12,790
I'll see you there.

175
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:13,790
Okay.

176
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:17,790
Jiashu!

177
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:21,950
Here!

178
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:36,560
Huiling.

179
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,110
Huiling!

180
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,750
Huiling, are you okay?

181
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:42,790
Huiling!

182
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:50,720
Mom.

183
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,750
Hello, are you the owner's son?

184
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:53,430
Yes.

185
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:55,360
Your mom was in a car accident on the Outer Ring Road.

186
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,150
Come here now.

187
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:06,910
Lin Junrong.

188
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:08,880
Were you talking to my mom?

189
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,270
What did you tell her?

190
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,910
What did you tell her?

191
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:13,910
What did you say?

192

00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:16,070
You can also say what you think.

385
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,500
Well.

386
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:20,940
Each family

387
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:22,300
has a maximum

388
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:25,620
of two places.

389
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:28,550
Each family

390
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:29,390
goes back

391
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:30,870
and picks out

392
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:33,430
its best

393
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:34,430
two rowers.

394
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:36,300
How about it?

395
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:40,620
Chief.

396
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:43,030
Some families

397
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,910
don't have good rowers.

398
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:46,660
Should they

399
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:47,820
give up their places?

400
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:48,500
Yes.

401
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:50,230
Mr. He.

402
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:52,940
After Jiashu left,

403
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:54,390
no one in your family could row.

404
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,550
Why don't you give up your places

405
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:57,820
to my family?

406
00:22:58,550 --> 00:22:59,710
Junli

407
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:01,140
is a good rower.

408
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:05,870
I also have several nephews.

409
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:07,140
They are also good rowers.

410
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,500
They will

411
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,110
bring glory to our village.

412
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:10,940
Good.

413
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:11,710
Chen.

414
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:15,140
Who says my family doesn't have rowers?

415
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:17,590
We have Jiahao.

416
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:19,710
Jiahao.

417
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:22,390
Can his body handle it?

418
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:25,300
He's not in good health.

419
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:27,430
Don't let him take part in this dangerous sport.

420
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:29,430
If he gets hurt,

421
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:31,780
it's not worth it. Right?

422
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:32,910
Right...

423
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:34,110
What do you mean?

424
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:35,940
What?

425
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:38,140
I heard

426
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:40,140
Jiahao collapsed at school the other day.

427
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:42,870
He's not in good health. Don't let him play.

428
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:43,980
Why bother?

429
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:45,940
If something happens to him,

430
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:47,140
what should we do?

431
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:48,390
Chief, am I right?

432
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,430
Chen.

433
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:52,340
Who says Jiahao is in poor health?

434
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:54,750
You cursed my son, didn't you?

435
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:56,070
Come on.

436
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:57,620
I'm telling the truth.

437
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:59,030
I'm telling you.

438
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:01,140
There's something I've wanted to say for a long time.

439
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:02,270
Now that I have the chance,

440
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:04,430
I will speak frankly.

441
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:06,300
Your He family

442
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:07,660
has been sitting

443
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:09,940
on the manger

444
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:11,140
for years.

445
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:13,140
Yeah.

446
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:14,940
Our Chen family

447
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:16,660
moved here from out of town.

448
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:17,590
Right?

449
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:19,340
But over the years,

450
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:20,980
our Chen family

451
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,140
has donated a lot of money

452
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:25,460
to the village.

453
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:27,140
Your He family

454
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:29,180
is a century-old family.

455
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:31,030
You're a respectable family.

456
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:32,940
So what?

457
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:35,620
Your family

458
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:36,820
doesn't have many descendants

459
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:38,620
and has no successor.

460
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:40,500
Chen.

461
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:41,750
Nonsense!

462
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:42,820
What's wrong?

463
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:43,940
Am I wrong?

464
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,070
Let's ask everyone.

465
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:46,430
Did I say anything wrong?

466
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,390
Don't talk nonsense!

467
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:49,070
I'm telling you!

468
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:50,180
I'm not done with you!

469
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:51,180
You must make it clear!

470
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:52,230
Stop!

471
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:53,070
I'm not done with you.

472
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:54,230
Stop!

473
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,710
One boat, one heart.

474
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:57,070
Stop arguing!

475
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:59,390
I won't fight with him.

476
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:20,940
What's wrong with you?

477
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:23,430
Why are you pulling a long face at dinner?

478
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:25,070
You're putting us out of the mood for dinner.

479
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:26,180
Yeah.

480
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:27,030
Come on.

481
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:27,710
Dad.

482
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:29,340
I can't

483
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:30,980
stand today.

484
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:31,980
What's wrong?

485
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:34,820
You didn't see what Chan did.

486
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,030
He insulted

487
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:38,710
our He family.

488
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:40,340
"Your He family"

489
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:41,620
"doesn't have many descendants."

490
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:43,070
What did he mean?

491
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:44,870
He made it very clear.

492
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:47,270
He wanted an extra place.

493
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:48,660
Just give it to them.

494
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:50,070
He was right.

495
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:51,750
Our He family doesn't have a rower.

496
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:53,070
What's wrong with you?

497
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:54,780
Don't say it if you don't know what to say.

498
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:56,780
What are you talking about?

499
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:58,590
We have Jiahao.

500
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:00,300
Hongguang.

501
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,870
Why are you yelling at Juan?

502
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:05,820
With Jiahao's current physical condition,

503
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:07,140
he can't row.

504
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:10,870
After that incident eight years ago,

505
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:12,430
he was reluctant to go near the water,

506
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:13,940
let alone row a boat.

507
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:17,390
What?

508
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:19,460
Are you going to follow him

509
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:20,910
with a rod

510
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:22,180
and make him row?

511
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,460
I'm telling you.

512
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:26,340
You can't put any more pressure on Jiahao

513
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:27,750
with his current physical condition.

514
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:35,980
If this was before...

515
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:36,460
I...

516
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:39,780
Eat.

517
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:40,870
Just eat.

518
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:41,300
All right.

519
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:42,910
Let's not talk about the past.

520
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:43,910
Let's eat.

521
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:44,980
Come on.

522
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:45,780
Eat.

523
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:48,940
Dad.

524
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:51,870
I can row.

525
00:26:58,270 --> 00:26:59,230
What do you mean?

526
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:00,590
I mean,

527
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:02,390
I can represent our family

528
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,300
in the dragon boat racing.

529
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:06,710
Jiahao.

530
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:08,590
Jiahao.

531
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:10,110
You don't have to be so proud.

532
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:12,230
Your dad's words don't matter.

533
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,870
The most important thing now

534
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:15,230
is your body.

535
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:17,270
I'm all right.

536
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:18,390
I can do it.

537
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,030
Hao.

538
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:22,030
Aren't you afraid of water anymore?

539
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:24,460
That's great.

540
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:26,780
He overcame the psychological barrier.

541
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:27,980
As his elders,

542
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:28,910
we should encourage him.

543
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:29,430
Right?

544
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:30,660
That's right.

545
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:31,300
See?

546
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:33,300
He's the heir of our He family.

547
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:36,430
Hao.

548
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:38,550
Are you sure you can do it?

549
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:43,270
Good.

550
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:46,030
You're my good son.

551
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:47,910
Hao.

552
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:50,140
You don't have to be very good.

553
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:51,620
Dragon boat racing

554
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:53,980
is all about momentum.

555
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:55,340
Do you understand?

556
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:56,710
Come here.

557
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:57,460
Sit down.

558
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:58,300
Sit down and eat.

559
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:00,340
Sit down.

560
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:00,980
Sit.

561
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:02,660
Give it to me.

562
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:07,070
Come on, son.

563
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:07,910
Eat more.

564
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:08,620
Thanks, Dad.

565
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:09,550
Come on.

566
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:10,270
Thank you, Grandpa.

567
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:12,910
Eat.

568
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:15,620
Don't let this delay your studies.

569
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:17,300
You have to work on both.

570
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:18,870
Got it.

571
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:21,660
Hao.

572
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:22,780
Do you need a coach

573
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:24,070
to teach you how to row a dragon boat?

574
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:25,180
No.

575
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:26,590
I have a coach.

576
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:28,910
Who is your coach?

577
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:33,430
Long's martial arts school

578
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:34,270
held a training camp for the race.

579
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:35,820
I'm already signed up.

580
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,550
The Chen family's son.

581
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:40,300
He's okay.

582
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:42,140
But

583
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:43,460
you can only go there after school.

584
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:44,390
Understand?

585
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:46,140
Yes, Dad.

586
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:47,750
Come on.

587
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:49,110
Let Jiahao eat.

588
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:49,660
Yeah.

589
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:50,270
Come on.

590
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:50,940
Come.

591
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:51,940
Eat.

592
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:52,550
Thanks, Auntie.

593
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:03,070
And this.

594
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:03,430
Okay.

595
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:04,390
Thank you.

596
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:04,780
You're welcome.

597
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:08,870
Coming.

598
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:09,460
Come.

599
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:13,660
How about it?

600
00:29:13,910 --> 00:29:14,750
Have you figured it out?

601
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:16,340
Are you really going to take part in the dragon boat race?

602
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:19,140
It's different this time.

603
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:21,180
I really want to play with everyone.

604
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:26,980
Okay.

605
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:28,710
I won't be here

606
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:30,300
for the training.

607
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,230
Long will be busy.

608
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:32,620
He may not be able to take care of you.

609
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:33,980
Don't train too hard.

610
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:35,070
Don't hurt yourself.

611
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:40,180
Jiashu.

612
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:42,980
I told my dad about the dragon boat race.

613
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:43,940
He was very supportive.

614
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:44,980
Really?

615
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:50,390
Jiashu.

616
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:51,590
People change.

617
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:53,300
Maybe one day

618
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:54,910
he'll accept you.

619
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:00,030
Things may not be

620
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:01,300
as bad as we think.

621
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:06,660
Let's eat.

622
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:07,430
It's going to be cold.

623
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,140
He Jiahao.

624
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:24,140
Did you have breakfast?

625
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:24,980
I brought you breakfast.

626
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:26,270
I've had breakfast. Thank you.

627
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:27,140
-The only one. -It's all right.

628
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:28,660
What are you doing here?

629
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:30,340
Did you come to the wrong place?

630
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:31,940
This is

631
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:33,270
where we train for dragon boating.

632
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:35,750
This is not the place for you to brag.

633
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:36,710
What?

634
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:38,390
Did your family host the race?

635
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:39,460
Is anyone not allowed to come?

636
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:42,070
Do you also want to row?

637
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:45,590
The only son.

638
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:46,980
Can you do it?

639
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:49,230
Don't drag us down.

640
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:51,180
Mind your own business.

641
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:53,750
I'm not talking to you.

642
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:54,820
Why are you angry?

643
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:55,550
What?

644
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:58,070
Are you He Jiahao's spokesperson?

645
00:30:58,270 --> 00:30:58,870
By the way,

646
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:00,300
what are you doing here?

647
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:02,030
We're here to play a game.

648
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:04,140
We're not playing house.

649
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:05,980
Fatty, you can participate in the race.

650
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:07,340
Why can't I?

651
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:09,110
Why are you telling me this?

652
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:11,180
Don't you know your weight?

653
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:12,140
Am I fat now?

654
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:12,460
Yes.

655
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:13,070
I managed to lose the weight.

656
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:13,660
Fatty.

657
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:14,550
You're fat!

658
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:15,660
Don't you know

659
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:16,590
how fat you were when you were a kid?

660
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:17,870
You're fat!

661
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:18,590
What?

662
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:19,180
Be quiet.

663
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:20,340
Be quiet, everybody.

664
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:27,620
Listen to me.

665
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:29,140
I am

666
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:31,180
the heir to the host of this training camp,

667
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:33,820
Junyilong Sports Club.

668
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:36,300
And I'm the head coach of the training camp.

669
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:38,030
I'm Chen Long'an.

670
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:44,300
Give me a hand.

671
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:58,030
If you want to row a dragon boat,

672
00:31:58,230 --> 00:31:59,340
first of all,

673
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:00,780
make sure that you are sitting

674
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:01,750
in the correct position.

675
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:02,750
Like this.

676
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,500
Keep your body steady.

677
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:06,110
Then, keep your feet firmly

678
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:08,550
on the pedals.

679
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:10,230
Then,

680
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:11,980
grab the paddle with both hands.

681
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:12,940
How to grab it?

682
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:14,460
Hold the top

683
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:16,030
with your thumb and forefinger with one hand.

684
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:18,140
The bottom hand

685
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:19,780
stays one punch away

686
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,070
from the bottom of it.

687
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:22,940
Like this.

688
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:25,460
When your lower hand goes back,

689
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:26,870
