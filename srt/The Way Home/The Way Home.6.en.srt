When you start training, your muscles will be sore.

380
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:37,960
You'll be fine after a few more days of training.

381
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,320
Will you be able to sleep tonight?

382
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,240
I'll try.

383
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:50,760
Don't worry.

384
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,640
Just relax.

385
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,160
Remember to come to me tomorrow after school.

386
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:57,800
Don't forget.

387
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,760
I'm going back.

388
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,480
Brat.

389
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:16,840
You're

390
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:17,720
seventeen, right?

391
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,680
In a year, you'll be an adult.

392
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,480
The He family

393
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:35,160
has always been about honor and legacy.

394
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:40,080
That ancestral hall weighs on every member

395
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:43,040
of the He family like a mountain.

396
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,320
When I was there,

397
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,920
I could share the burden with you,

398
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,040
but now,

399
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,760
they can only put

400
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,200
all their hopes on you,

401
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:01,960
so your burden will be heavier in the future,

402
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,720
and the road ahead will be more difficult,

403
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:12,240
but if one day, you can't hold on

404
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,440
or don't want to carry the burden,

405
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,200
just give up,

406
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,720
do what you want to do,

407
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,000
live the life you want to live,

408
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,200
and stick to your hobbies.

409
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:27,780
Hao.

410
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,440
Remember.

411
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,800
No one

412
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,840
can live your life instead of you.

413
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:37,800
You can be the backbone

414
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,400
that carries your family

415
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,680
or just your own backbone,

416
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:44,800
you know?

417
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:54,760
Go back.

418
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,040
I'm going back too.

419
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:21,640
Go now.

420
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,160
Dad, Mom. I'm back.

421
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,880
What happened to your leg?

422
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:43,960
Are you hurt?

423
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,320
No, I'm not.

424
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:50,000
I ran in gym class, so my muscles are a little sore.

425
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,200
It scared me.

426
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,200
You're so tired, but why are you so happy?

427
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,600
What's the occasion?

428
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,320
I solved a puzzle today,

429
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,200
and the teacher praised me.

430
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,200
Look at that.

431
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,920
That's our son.

432
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,200
He's so smart.

433
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:09,080
Son, listen.

434
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,920
Solving one puzzle

435
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,400
is nothing.

436
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,400
What's valuable is that you solve every puzzle.

437
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,480
Back then, I...

438
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,240
Back then,

439
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,640
your father couldn't even solve the easiest one.

440
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,280
That's your dad.

441
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,920
By the way, I've warmed up some milk for you.

442
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,520
Let me go get it for you.

443
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,920
No, Mom. I'll go.

444
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,600
You?

445
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,000
Just sit and watch TV. I'll go.

446
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:33,720
Be careful.

447
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:45,280
You're asking too much of him.

448
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,480
We only have one child.

449
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,320
If I ease up on him now,

450
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,360
how will he support such a big family in the future?

451
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,880
It's good to have some pressure at this age.

452
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,200
Pressure is motivation.

453
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,280
I don't care.

454
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,280
If you hurt him

455
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,960
because of this,

456
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,680
I won't let you go.

457
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,920
Talking about this

458
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,120
makes me angry.

459
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:16,400
If that hadn't happened back then,

460
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,360
Hao wouldn't be carrying

461
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,200
all the burden now.

462
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,440
You're talking nonsense.

463
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,520
Nonsense?

464
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,920
If that hadn't happened,

465
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,320
wouldn't Shu still be here?

466
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,400
Shu is smart

467
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,120
and capable.

468
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,120
If he were here,

469
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,800
how could my son become like this?

470
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,760
Shut up.

471
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,520
There is only Jiahao in this generation of our family.

472
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,560
Even if Jiahao doesn't inherit the family business,

473
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,080
that brat doesn't stand a chance.

474
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,120
That's enough.

475
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,480
I will stop.

476
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,280
You're out of control when it comes to this.

477
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,720
Why are you going crazy in the middle of the night?

478
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,720
Listen.

479
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,520
From now on, at home, don't mention him to me.

480
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,520
OK.

481
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:03,920
I'll stop.

482
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:05,880
Your father needs his medicine.

483
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:06,680
I'll get it for him.

484
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,060

for this after all these years.

505
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,120
After all these years,

506
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,240
you've grown up,

507
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,040
but you still like kids' snacks.

508
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,440
The thermal cup.

509
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:29,900
Brat.

510
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,440
Are you still making lanterns?

511
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,040
You've got bruises all over your hands.

512
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,540
Does your dad allow that?

513
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:47,640
Of course not, so I have to do it in secret.

514
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:51,300
It's good.

515
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:55,660
Jiashu.

516
00:31:56,520 --> 00:32:00,040
Do you still row after you leave Xiqiao?

517
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,860
I...

518
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,320
Aren't I teaching you?

519
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:12,060
Let's go.

520
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:13,680
I'll take you back.

521
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,400
Jiashu, do you want to see

522
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,680
the lanterns I'm making now?

523
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,600
I make different lanterns now than I used to.

524
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,640
There were no tutorials before,

525
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,040
so I had to figure it out on my own,

526
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,200
but not anymore.

527
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,600
Now there are many lantern masters

528
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,240
who upload their lantern-making videos

529
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,240
online.

530
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,400
I've learned a lot.

531
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,840
Lotus,

532
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,440
butterfly, tiger,

533
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,040
and dragon.

534
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,160
Don't you especially like dragon lanterns?

535
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,040
I made one.

536
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,320
Do you want to take a look?

537
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,600
Maybe next time.

538
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:45,000
When's next time?

539
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,880
You know what? The dragon lantern I made is especially big.

540
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,400
About this big. You'll love it.

541
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,100
Then it's a deal.

542
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,620
After training, we'll go together.

543
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,280
Who made a deal with you?

544
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,520
You just acquiesced.

545
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,200
Why do you always go back on your word?

546
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,760
You're bold.

547
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:05,660
You cheated first.

548
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:07,920
No.

549
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:08,640
Stand still.

550
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:10,560
Are you going or not?

551
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:10,840
Come here.

552
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:11,680
Are you going or not?

553
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,120
Come here.

554
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,080
Tell me.

555
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:14,840
Come here.

556
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:15,640
Are you going or not?

557
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,120
Where are we going to eat?

558
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,360
Later.

559
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:23,780
All right.

560
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,400
Aren't you going to do your homework?

561
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:26,780
Homework?

562
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:27,560
What can I do?

563
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,720
What kind of person does homework?

564
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,240
Who does homework?

565
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:37,840
That's right.

566
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:42,860
The only one.

567
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:52,240
The only one.

568
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,880
Weren't you cramming?

569
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,200
Why are you hanging around here?

570
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,300
I didn't.

571
00:33:58,380 --> 00:33:59,200
Didn't?

572
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,200
Then why did you change your clothes

573
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,520
and sneak around here?

574
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:03,920
Did you fall in love?

575
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,320
Who would fall in love with someone like him?

576
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,600
You're always the first

577
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,520
to leave school these days.

578
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,440
You really didn't go to cram school?

579
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:16,640
No, I didn't.

580
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,220
It's no use cramming.

581
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:19,360
I'll still do better than you.

582
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,040
That's enough. Let's go.

583
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,120
See you, the only one.

584
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,440
It's better not to let your family know

585
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,700
I'm back.

586
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:06,100
I know.

587
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:08,220
They didn't see you.

588
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:14,780
Let's go.

589
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:20,900
Jiashu.

590
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:24,900
Do you miss home

591
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:25,940
