00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:39,950
Let's go.

195
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,580
Alright.

196
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,950
He Jiashu, are you serious?

197
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,350
Still fighting?

198
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,030
Come on!

199
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,070
Fight me!

200
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,590
Throw a punch!

201
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,430
Didn't you want to fight me?

202
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,310
Why are you dodging?

203
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,350
Think it'll help?

204
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,950
You think getting hit is an apology?

205
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,710
He Jiahao,

206
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,950
throw a punch!

207
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:08,950
Hit me back!

208
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,030
Hao, what are you doing?

209
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,030
You clearly don't know how to row.

210
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,710
If you can't do it,

211
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:21,980
don't force yourself.

212
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:07,940
Hao,

213
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:09,580
come.

214
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:20,830
It's okay.

215
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,550
You don't know how to fight, but still insisted on trying.

216
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,990
Why were you so eager to get beaten up?

217
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,830
Your brother, that blockhead,

218
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,710
doesn't know how to handle a beginner.

219
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,550
Don't blame him.

220
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,100
It's my fault.

221
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,470
Do you know what you did wrong?

222
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,390
You're too stubborn.

223
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,780
So, take my advice,

224
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,430
don't be too hard on yourself.

225
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,430
Take your time

226
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,150
with him.

227
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,340
Alright, don't bother him today.

228
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:16,310
Or you'll both feel worse.

229
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,830
Dad wants you to steer the Chen family dragon boat team.

230
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,550
Are you going or not?

231
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,830
I'm talking to you.

232
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:33,590
Did you hear me?

233
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,300
I'm not going.

234
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,550
The dragon boat race is a matter of family honor.

235
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,190
Dad has always taken it seriously.

236
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,340
Even I have to make time for it before my exams.

237
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:43,390
Why aren't you going?

238
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,190
Didn't they say before that women can't row?

239
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,430
Now that you're short on people, you think of me?

240
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,190
This is an official competition.

241
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,910
There's no such rule.

242
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:52,870
Well, I'm still not going.

243
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,190
Madam.

244
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,270
Ruonan.

245
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:02,830
I'm here for a hair dye.

246
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,230
Take a seat and wait for a bit.

247
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,030
I'll have some lemon water then.

248
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:07,830
Sure.

249
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,870
Don't dye your hair too much.

250
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,150
I've looked into it,

251
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,230
hair dye contains PPD,

252
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,390
a Group 2 carcinogen.

253
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,830
You've always been weak,

254
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,470
so take care to avoid getting sick.

255
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,710
Do you believe

256
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,830
I'll send you to the hospital right now?

257
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,110
Get up!

258
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:04,590
Madam,

259
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,190
running such a big salon on your own,

260
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,790
can you handle it?

261
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,750
Why not hire someone

262
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,510
to help you out?

263
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,150
If you wear yourself out,

264
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,390
I'll feel bad.

265
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,830
You're just good with sweet talk.

266
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,950
I'm just being honest.

267
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,310
I always speak the truth.

268
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,870
I just like women

269
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,150
who are both pretty and capable.

270
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,150
So, how about a hair treatment?

271
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,310
Are you doing it for me?

272
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,430
Then, of course!

273
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,910
That way, I can spend more time

274
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,830
with you.

275
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,430
Alright, wait for me then.

276
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,670
Madam,

277
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:58,310
is there a He family in your village?

278
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,590
They seem pretty well-off.

279
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,990
You must mean the He family from the north village.

280
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,590
They're a well-known

281
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,670
and respected family around here.

282
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,510
They even led

283
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,430
the Dragon Boat Blessing Ceremony yesterday.

284
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,510
Do you know them?

285
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,670
Not exactly.

286
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,030
We just had dealings years ago.

287
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,430
Since I'm here in Xiqiao,

288
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,310
I'd like to visit some old acquaintances.

289
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,670
By the way,

290
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,190
do you know their address?

291
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,100
Alright, take a break, everyone!

292
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,430
Lunch is here. Come get your meal boxes!

293
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,270
Hold on, hold on.

294
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,350
There's plenty left, grab what you like.

295
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,670
Rice rolls, rice noodles, and fried noodles.

296
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:17,830
Share them over there.

297
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,910
Hao, I got you one.

298
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,270
Thanks, Long.

299
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,340
Long,

300
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,630
what about my brother's?

301
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:32,540
Your brother

302
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:33,900
is fired up right now.

303
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,620
No idea why he's so moody today.

304
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:37,390
Just eat your food.

305
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,230
Don't worry about him.

306
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,710
Jiashu, you've been at it for so long.

307
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,820
Eat something first.

308
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:50,420
No need.

309
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,340
He Jiashu!

310
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,590
Why did you spill the lunch box?

311
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,470
If you don't want it, give it to someone else.

312
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,830
I paid for it.

313
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,030
I'll pay you back.

314
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:12,380
[Junyilong Sports Club]

315
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,670
Long, we're leaving. Bye.

316
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,470
- Bye. - Bye.

317
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,510
Look at him,

318
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,870
sitting there all day without eating.

319
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,670
Hao is...

320
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:20,750
Yeah.

321
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,220
I'm about to close up.

322
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,030
What about Hao?

323
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,110
Not my problem.

324
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,390
You brought him here,

325
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,190
so figure it out yourself.

326
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,430
You've been following me all day.

327
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:52,830
What do you want?

328
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,630
I... I want...

329
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:58,180
I want...

330
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:58,830
He Jiahao,

331
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,750
some things have already happened.

332
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,910
Nothing you do can change that.

333
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:04,790
Do you understand?

334
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:12,870
Come with me.

335
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:29,630
Get on.

336
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,070
Jiashu, I...

337
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,430
Didn't you say you could do anything?

338
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,030
Then get on the boat and show me you can row.

339
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:41,910
No, Jiashu,

340
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:42,340
you know

341
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:43,470
I had an accident rowing when I was a kid.

342
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:43,990
I can't...

343
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:44,790
Exactly.

344
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,110
Some things can't just be left in the past.

345
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:49,900
If you can't get over it,

346
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,230
it'll never be over.

347
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,470
I can.

348
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,780
He Jiashu, what are you trying to do?

349
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,620
Your brother had an accident before.

350
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,070
You know he's afraid of water, and you're still pushing him?

351
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,190
What if something happens again?

352
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:06,950
I'm not forcing him.

353
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,470
He can leave if he wants.

354
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,430
I'll go.

355
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,790
Now you see.

356
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:38,830
Some things

357
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,510
can't just be brushed off with words.

358
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,590
What's done is done,

359
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,070
just as the capsized boat.

360
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,150
What you should do

361
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,430
is let go of this boat

362
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,710
and move on with your life.

363
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:56,870
He Jiashu.

364
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,910
Hao, get up first.

365
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,590
Ruonan, I'm here.

366
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,230
Aunt Zhang, I've been waiting for you forever.

367
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,550
Why are you so dressed up today?

368
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,150
Hey, stop being nosy!

369
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,310
Are you dating someone?

370
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,550
What does a little kid like you know?

371
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,620
What are you here for?

372
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:37,790
To dye my hair.

373
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,350
What color?

374
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,030
Black, of course.

375
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,710
Didn't I tell you the school doesn't allow students to dye their hair?

376
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,630
You never listen.

377
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,470
Well, I just want to be as pretty as you

378
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,190
so I can date a handsome guy.

379
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,590
You little sweet talker.

380
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,180
