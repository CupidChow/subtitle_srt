00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:21,020
Episode 4

3
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,830
He Jiashu, what exactly do you want?

4
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:31,860
He's just a child, and he's sincerely apologized to you.

5
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:32,910
You refused it. That's fine.

6
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:34,270
Why did you talk to him like that?

7
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,560
Adolescent children

8
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:38,590
are most prone to overthinking.

9
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:39,460
As his elder brother,

10
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,700
you don't seem to know how to talk to him properly.

11
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:44,510
Don't say anything you'll regret.

12
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:46,650
Where is Hao?

13
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:48,500
Is he still over there?

14
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,260
Maybe.

15
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,270
I'll go to him, okay?

16
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:17,460
Hello,

17
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:19,260
I may need another favor

18
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:21,180
from you.

19
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:31,670
He Jiahao,

20
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,680
Why are you still pretending to be strong?

21
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:37,580
Do you know

22
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:38,700
that If anything happens to you,

23
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,400
the whole martial arts school will go down because of you?

24
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:40,950
You're hurting others and yourself.

25
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:42,320
Did you know that?

26
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:45,660
You haven't changed a bit

27
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,570
after all these years.

28
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,320
Jiahao, are you good at dragon boat rowing?

29
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,510
Join us together later.

30
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:07,510
I don't know how to do that.

31
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:10,460
Didn't Jiashu teach you?

32
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:12,200
Didn't your family let him learn that?

33
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,470
He is different from me.

34
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,150
Unlike me,

35
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:16,800
he has been quiet since childhood.

36
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:18,420
Besides,

37
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:19,990
not everyone has to be able to row a boat, right?

38
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:24,790
Hao, what are you doing?

39
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:25,590
You clearly can't row a boat.

40
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,380
There's no need to force yourself

41
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:28,420
to do what you can't do.

42
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:32,410
I see.

43
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:38,980
Xiqiao Village won the championship again this year.

44
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:41,540
Jiashu!

45
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:42,900
Jiashu!

46
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,230
Jiashu!

47
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,320
Jiashu!

48
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:55,300
Everyone, look at the camera. Let's take a photo.

49
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:56,430
Good!

50
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:58,660
Say cheese!

51
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,210
Cheese!

52
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:01,520
Alright. OK.

53
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:05,010
Hold on. Help our family take a photo.

54
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:05,600
Okay.

55
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:08,800
Ready, one, two, and three.

56
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,950
Smile.

57
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:13,310
Dad, where is my mom?

58
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:19,440
Shu,

59
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:22,360
your mother has something else to do today.

60
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,520
She will come back tonight to celebrate with you.

61
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,570
Hongxiao, your son is so amazing.

62
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:31,750
​No one in the town could match him.

63
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:32,790
Exactly.

64
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,070
He won the dragon boat racing.

65
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:35,680
He is also the best student in the whole town.

66
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:36,640
How did you raise

67
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:37,790
such an excellent son?

68
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:40,150
Dragon boat racing is

69
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:42,000
a group activity.

70
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,620
The credit cannot be given

71
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:44,100
to him alone.

72
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:46,260
You're too modest.

73
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,510
Jiashu is the best helmsman​.

74
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:49,110
He is the soul of the team.

75
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:51,110
He alone took half the credit.

76
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:52,160
That's right.

77
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,330
It was up to him to win this time.

78
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:54,780
All of us are proud of him.

79
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:55,310
Is that so?

80
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:56,010
Sure.

81
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,100
You're praising him too much.

82
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,250
Jiashu, don't be proud.

83
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,210
Mr. He.

84
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,290
Mr. He.

85
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:14,900
I was just on my way to your house.

86
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,210
I have something for Hao.

87
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,000
Coincidentally, I met you.

88
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,070
I'll give it to you directly.

89
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,830
Hao is quite smart.

90
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:23,590
He could learn everything

91
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:25,040
quickly.

92
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,500
His grades have always been good.

93
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,500
But no matter how smart he is,

94
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,300
he has to listen in class.

95
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:33,460
I noticed him making a lantern

96
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:34,440
during class.

97
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,080
I confiscated this from him.

98
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,170
I'm sorry, Madam.

99
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:42,120
I didn't expect him to do lanterns in class.

100
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:44,800
​I will certainly scold him when I get home.

101
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,000
It's not that serious.

102
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:47,400
Give it back to him,

103
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,160
and just ask him not to do so in class again.

104
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:55,300
Jiashu won the racing again.

105
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,300
Your elder brother's son is quite impressive.

106
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:01,070
It's great for children to have their own hobbies

107
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:01,910
outside of class.

108
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:04,380
Well, I'll get out of your hair.

109
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,310
I'm leaving.

110
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:06,300
Take care.

111
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:06,900
Okay.

112
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:27,270
Why are you back now?

113
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,700
What happened?

114
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:37,700
What are you doing?

115
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:43,730
You spend your time making lanterns

116
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:45,700
instead of studying.

117
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:47,700
What's worse, you slack off in class.

118
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,220
Today, I'll throw away

119
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,530
all your useless stuff.

120
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:52,820
Don't make them anymore.

121
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,280
You waste all your time on them,

122
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,090
and do nothing of value.

123
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,030
Didn't you tell me

124
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:02,860
that you will learn from Jiashu?

125
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:04,520
What did you learn?

126
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:07,440
Jiashu won honor for our family by rowing a dragon boat.

127
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:08,770
What about you?

128
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,700
I'd be very happy

129
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:13,010
if you had a little of his good qualities.

130
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:15,780
Give that to me.

131
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:18,380
Give that to me.

132
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,330
You!

133
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:21,700
Let go! Let go!

134
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:25,470
All you need to do is study hard.

135
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,790
♪I hid in the darkness♪

136
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:09,820
♪At that moment♪

♪Covet the occasional Milky Way...♪

138
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:16,860
Jiashu, I don't want to make lanterns anymore.

139
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:18,800
I want to learn dragon boat rowing from you.

140
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,280
However,

141
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:23,800
​do you really enjoy rowing a dragon boat?

142
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:27,000
My dad said

143
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:28,560
it was a waste of time to make lanterns.

144
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:30,890
He asked me to learn from you to row a dragon boat

145
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,050
and to win honor for the family.

146
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:34,000
Actually,

147
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:36,800
making lanterns is no different from rowing a dragon boat.

148
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,170
Be brave

149
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,060
to do what you love.

150
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:42,770
This is what a man should be like.

151
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:44,580
Cheer up.

152
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,080
Isn't there still a lantern here?

153
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:47,700
​But

154
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:49,820
it's a birthday gift for you.

155
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,500
I'll lend it to you to play first.

156
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:54,440
​Look, here's a little tree.

157
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:55,760
I noticed it.

158
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,500

159
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:03,400
♪No need to pursue...♪

160
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,340
Let's continue in fifteen minutes.

161
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,630
I'm exhausted.

162
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:08,950
Jiashu, come over.

163
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:14,800
Take a drink of water.

164
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:15,460
How is it?

165
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:16,450
Not bad.

166
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:18,080
I feel better than before.

167
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:19,740
Good boy.

168
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:39,950
Second Uncle,

169
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:42,440
Jiahao is a good child.

170
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,160
Don't be angry with him anymore.

171
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:46,780
Speaking of him,

172
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:49,290
​both of you are children of the He family.

173
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:50,560
He is far inferior to you.

174
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:54,640
It would be great

175
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:55,750
if you were my son.

176
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:03,630
A boat has collided!

177
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:05,710
A boat has collided! Hurry up!

178
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,330
A lot of blood!

179
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:10,690
Hao? Hao? Hao?

180
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:11,520
Hao, are you all right?

181
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,160
Hao, what happened?

182
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:12,850
Hao! Go!

183
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:14,880
Hao!

184
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:15,760
The patient has suffered excessive blood loss.

185
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:16,640
Call the emergency department!

186
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:17,580
All family members move away!

187
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:18,490
Wake up, Hao!

188
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:18,910
Hao!

189
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,330
How is Hao?

190
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:30,280

00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:22,000
simply be emotional ones.

It's all because she cares for the students.

364
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,190
We all need to respect her.

365
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:05,740
You'd better not talk to her like that anymore.

00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:07,350

But you need to take a good method.

00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,480

overnight.

377
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,090
Do you understand?

378
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:33,270
Okay, I'll leave you to work.

379
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:34,830
Thank you, Mr. Zhang.

380
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:35,700
It's fine.

381
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,390
Shu, you are grown up.

382
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,790
You start to help me with the work.

383
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,010
You take care of the rest.

384
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:02,760
I'm tired.

385
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,870
How can you give up halfway?

386
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:07,800
What? Can't I take a break?

387
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:08,640
What?

388
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:10,670
As provincial champion, this is how you treat me?

389
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:11,490
There is no need to wait.

390
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:13,450
It's Monday, and Hao won't come.

391
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,320
If you really want him to come,

392
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:18,760
be nice to him.

393
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:21,300
Hao is sensitive.

394
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,790
Don't be so harsh to him anymore.

395
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:23,640
If he does not come,

396
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,620
you will regret it.

397
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:30,390
That's not the way to exercise biceps.

398
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:32,180
Long,

399
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:35,240
how has he been

400
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:37,160
since I left?

401
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:42,470
It's been so many years since you left.

402
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:45,160
Nor have I had much contact with the He family.

403
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:47,970
Only once,

404
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:50,080
and that was because something happened.

405
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:53,670
What do you mean?

406
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:55,450
Two years ago,

407
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:56,870
Hao ran away from home one day.

408
00:20:57,670 --> 00:20:59,610
His family searched for him for a day and a night.

409
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:05,390
Looks yummy.

410
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:10,110
Hao?

411
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,290
Mr. and Mrs. He, have you eaten yet?

412
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:14,990
Long, have you seen Hao?

413
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:15,850
No.

414
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:17,510
Hao is missing!

415
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:18,540
Hao is missing?

416
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,010
I thought he went to school.

417
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:22,470
But his teacher called me

418
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:23,750
and said he didn't go to school.

419
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:27,200
We looked everywhere, but we couldn't find him.

420
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,550
Would he meet a bad guy?

421
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:31,280
It's all in your imagination.

422
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:33,320
We are all acquaintances around here.

423
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,670
There are no bad guys.

424
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:36,290
Then where can he go?

425
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:37,800
Yes, what Mr. He said is right.

426
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:38,460
Don't worry too much.

427
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:39,680
Hao will come home safely.

428
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:41,900
Did you look for him in town?

429
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:42,580
No.

430
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:43,310
I'll go with you.

431
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:43,980
Let's go.

432
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:44,750
Thank you so much.

433
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:45,730
Don't mention that.

434
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,830
Mr. and Mrs. He, don't worry.

435
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:55,010
Police have started examining the surveillance footage.

436
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:56,580
We will know where Hao is soon.

437
00:21:57,570 --> 00:22:00,300
Long, I really appreciate you for your help today.

438
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,390
It's so late at night.

439
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:03,610
You can also go back first.

440
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:06,690
Hao?

441
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,160
Hao!

442
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:14,050
Hao, where have you been?

443
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:15,820
I thought you were in danger.

444
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:18,020
Where have you been?

445
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:20,760
Do you know how much trouble you've caused?

446
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,760
​Did you try to make us angry on purpose?

447
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:25,350
He finally came back.

448
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:26,860
Don't scold him anymore.

449
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,390
I have to teach him a lesson.

450
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:32,140
He began to skip school and run away from home now.

451
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:34,280
When he grows up, he may fall into a wrong path.

452
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:36,840
Get in the house.

453
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:38,650
You have to be punished today.

454
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:39,410
Go!

455
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:40,980
Go!

456
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,840
Let's go inside and talk.

457
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:46,450
Don't scold him too badly.

458
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:57,410
I heard

459
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:59,090
that Hao kept silent about why he went away from home

460
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:00,250
after coming back.

461
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:01,960
He didn't say where he went either.

462
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:04,860
You also know his personality.

463
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:07,900
​After that, he said even less.

464
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:09,910
10% off!

465
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:11,490
10% off? 10% off!

466
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:12,580
I will give you another discount

467
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:13,730
if you bring a friend with you.

468
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:15,700
Really?

469
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:16,930
Let's go together.

470
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:17,630
Take a look.

471
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,420
Hao,

472
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:20,930
we are going to practice boxing. Do you want to come together?

473
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,300
I won't charge you any money.

474
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:29,090
Long, leave him alone.

475
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:30,620
He is the only child of the He family. No one wants to play with him.

476
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:31,960
What did you say?

477
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,410
Well, he is the only child of the He family. No one wants to play with him.

478
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:35,190
That's right.

479
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:37,420
Long,

480
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:41,070
you were so cool just now.

481
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:42,290
Long, can you teach me?

482
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:42,970
I also want to learn that.

483
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:43,790
10% off! 10% off!

484
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:47,710
He is now the only child of the He family, as you know.

485
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,860
Everyone said so.

486
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:51,490
​So no one dares to play with him.

487
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:53,150
If he is injured,

488
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:54,770
his family may come and cause trouble.

489
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,690
I have seen Hao several times in town.

490
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:00,740
He is always alone.

491
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,300
He is over 1.8 meters tall,

492
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:05,410
but he always keeps his head down.

493
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,290
No one knows what he is thinking.

494
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:12,420
In my opinion,

495
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:13,700
Hao must have been

496
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:16,310
under too much pressure.

497
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:18,400
You also know what the elders

498
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:22,120
of the He family are like.

499
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,740
He is quite pitiful.

500
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,700
If you care for him,

501
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,140
why don't you go see him in person?

502
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:33,130
He didn't look well when he left that day.

503
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:40,290
Stand up.

504
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:44,660
Hello, ma'am.

505
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:46,180
Hello, classmates. Sit down.

506
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,820
Where are Chen Afu and He Jiahao?

507
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:53,940
Chen Afu must be late again.

508
00:24:55,770 --> 00:24:56,900
Where is He Jiahao?

509
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:59,360
​He did not come to the morning study.

510
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,070
Don't you know that?

511
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:02,530
I thought he was on leave.

512
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:06,040
Does anyone know where He Jiahao went?

513
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:07,300
Ms. Qiu,

514
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,620
​He Jiahao has basically no contact with anyone.

515
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:11,460
How can we know where he went?

516
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:12,930
He hasn't appeared even now.

517
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:14,110
He might have skipped class.

518
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:16,400
​He has been nodding off in class lately.

519
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,800
Maybe he got up late.

520
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:22,000
I see. Let's start the class.

521
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:29,170
Chen Afu, it's you again.

522
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,610
How many times have you been late this month?

523
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:32,710
Do you have any idea?

524
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,270
Stop grinning cheekily.

525
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:36,610
Button up your collar.

526
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,300
You are always late

527
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,490
and have caused our class to lose a lot of points

528
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:40,450
and fall behind other classes.

529
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,240
Mr. Zhang,

530
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:45,060
I know I was wrong.

531
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:47,750
Please let me in.

532
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:48,900
The class has already started.

533
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,120
Do you care about that?

534
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,550
I thought you didn't want to take any classes.

535
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:54,230
Look at yourself.

536
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:56,430
Is this how you admit you're wrong?

537
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:57,210
What are you laughing at?

538
00:25:57,910 --> 00:25:59,370
Do you think it's honorable to be late?

539
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:01,280
Do you think it's funny to be punished by standing?

540
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:03,290
I really should have your parents come over

541
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:05,070
and see how you are doing at school.

542
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:06,630
Mr. Zhang,

543
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:09,490
I'm sorry. I won't be like this anymore.

544
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:11,850
I promise I won't be late again.

545
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:12,960
Stand properly.

546
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:13,920
Stand properly!

547
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:17,140
Which class are you in?

548
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:18,170
Class 1, Grade 3.

549
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:18,920
​You are in your senior year of high school. How could you be late?

550
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,300
Do you still want to take the college entrance examination?

551
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,100
Stand properly.

552
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:22,310
Don't laugh.

553
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,400
What's your name?

554
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,760
Zhang Xiaocui.

555
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,320
What's your name?

556
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:30,180
He Jiahao.

557
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:32,670
He Jia... He Jiahao?

558
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:34,750
He Jiahao?

559
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,310
Aren't you a good student?

560
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:38,500
Chen Afu, return to the original position.

561
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:41,490
Jiahao,

562
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:43,110
how do you come to be so late?

563
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:44,310
Are you feeling unwell?

564
00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:47,590
Sorry, I got up late.

565
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:50,340
Learning requires methods.

566
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:51,530
Good rest is also vital.

567
00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:53,480
​You study late at night and fail to sleep well.

568
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,570
So you're definitely not feeling well.

569
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:55,790
Your face looks pale.

570
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:57,380
Do you need to go to the school clinic?

571
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:58,770
No need. I'm fine.

572
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:00,630
Alright, go in quickly.

573
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:01,560
Go to class quickly.

574
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,280
Hurry up.

575
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:04,100
Thank you.

576
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:08,250
No... Mr. Zhang.

577
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:10,360
He is late as well.

578
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,010
Why doesn't he need to be punished by standing?

579
00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:14,210
Can you remain silent for a while, Chen Afu?

580
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:15,110
You want to know why?

581
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:16,330
He was late because of studying late at night.

582
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:17,540
What about you?

583
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:18,380
Stand properly!

584
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,700
Don't you know why?

585
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:21,420
Stand properly!

586
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:41,880
He Jiahao.

587
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,310
He Jiahao!

588
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,900
Why are you late today?

589
00:27:47,050 --> 00:27:48,280
I slept late.

590
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,050
Hurry up and go to class.

591
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:51,190
Hurry up!

592
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:01,500
Alright,

593
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,770
in today's class,

594
00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:04,200
we need to first review

595
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,050
what we learned yesterday.

596
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:08,920
Everyone, concentrate and pay attention

597
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:09,570
to the class.

598
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:11,060
I will ask several questions later.

599
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:12,260
He Jiahao,

600
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:14,620
There are two main factors...

601
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:16,270
Why are you still pretending to be strong?

602
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:18,120
that affect the progress of chemical reactions.

603
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:21,780
First, the composition of the substances involved in the reaction.

604
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:24,700
Do you know that If anything happens to you,

605
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:26,340
the whole martial arts school will go down because of you?

606
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:28,320
You're hurting others and yourself. Do you know that?

607
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,450
You haven't changed a bit

608
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:32,190
after all these years.

609
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,650
You are always self-righteous

610
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:42,500
and end up implicating others.

611
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:45,870
He Jiahao.

612
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:50,400
The more you try to prove that past mistakes can be undone,

613
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:52,790
the more you prove

614
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,700
that they can't be.

615
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:14,320
You finally hear me.

616
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:17,120
If you can get good grades

617
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,010
without listening in class,

618
00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:19,910
I won't scold you at all.

619
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:20,560
However, think about

620
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:23,050
how badly you did in the last test.

621
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,730
​How can you slack off in class?

622
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:28,100
​I've seen plenty of students like you before.

623
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,570
Relying on your cleverness

624
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:30,660
and not studying hard.

625
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,910
​In the beginning, you were able to do well.

626
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:34,310
But let me tell you.

627
00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:35,410
It doesn't take long

628
00:29:35,410 --> 00:29:37,100
before you realize you're not clever enough.

629
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,220
At that point, you will see your grades drop.

630
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:40,510
The college entrance examination is about to start.

631
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:42,740
Only doing well in the college entrance examination can prove yourself.

632
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,450
You're too young. Don't be so arrogant.

633
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,470
He Jiahao,

634
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:50,660
what's the matter with you? He Jiahao?

635
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:46,100
Is anyone there?

636
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:48,750
Is anyone there?

637
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,110
Is anyone there?

638
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:52,960
Is anyone there?
