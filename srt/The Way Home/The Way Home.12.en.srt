00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:40,510
Dad, why haven't you rested?

00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:41,720
Can you stand it?

5
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,910
Don't mind me. Tell me.

00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:44,310
Did you find him?

7
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,480
Let him go.

00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,310
Let's pretend we don't have him.

00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:51,040
What are you talking about?

10
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,760
This is the child you've raised for over ten years,

11
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,080
but you're going to abandon him at will?

12
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:58,000
Dad, he's the one who wanted to leave home.

13
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
He doesn't want this family

14
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,950
or me, his dad.

15
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,360
Let him be.

00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:05,080
He left home?

17
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,590
I think you drove him away.

18
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:10,310
How could he leave if you didn't beat him,

19
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:11,720
lock him up, or yell at him?

20
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:14,440
I'm over 80 years old

and only have these two grandchildren.

22
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:19,080
Eight years ago, you drove Jiashu away,

23
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,310
and now, you're going to drive Hao away too?

Don't worry.

45
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,510
The patient is old,

46
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:08,160
so he didn't pass the pre-op evaluation,

00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,160
but fortunately, he's stable now.

48
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:13,400

He didn't reach out to you

169
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,440

to help with your father's illness,

177
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,630
That's why your second uncle couldn't accept

When I wasn't even born yet,

182
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,830
your grandparents

183
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,040
were often away on business,

184
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:37,510
so there were no adults at home.

185
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,440
It was your dad

186

who raised your second uncle little by little.

187

The eldest brother is like a father.

188
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,590
Your dad occupied a very important place

00:12:58,550 --> 00:12:59,760
that your dad was gone.

193
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,080
That's why all his anger

194
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,440
ended up directed at you.

195
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:04,910
It was wrong of him,

196
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:09,510
and it was wrong of the He family.

197
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,440
Jiashu,

198
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,720
if you're willing,

199
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:24,680
you can come back home.

200
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:34,760
Auntie, don't worry.

201
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,910
I won't be leaving Xiqiao for the time being.

202
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,080
I'll stay here until Grandpa wakes up.

203
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:35,040
This time, I won't leave no matter what.

204
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,230
Wherever you go,

205
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:38,360
I'll follow.

206
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,190
Let's go.

207
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,760
You just came back from the factory. Get some rest.

208
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:43,040
I've been waiting for so many days.

209
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:43,800
That's right.

210
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,760
What time is this? Why hasn't the quota been added yet?

211
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:47,870
It's not time.

212
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:48,440
We've been waiting every day,

213
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,590
but they haven't increased the number of places.

214
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,910
Patients from all over the country are here,

215
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:54,230
so there's no point in rushing.

216
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:55,550
Buddy.

217
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:56,680
Do you have a lighter? Can I borrow it?

218
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:03,000
Now, or we'll miss it again.

219
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:03,590
Hurry up.

220
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:11,440
There you go. Thank you.

221
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,510
My wife has lung cancer.

222
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:20,310
I dare not smoke,

223
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:21,510
but now I need a boost.

224
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,440
God is so unfair.

225
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:27,160
I've smoked all my life,

226
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,040
but it's my wife who's got it,

227
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:29,870
so...

228
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:30,630
I don't know what to do.

229
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,360
Seems to me

230
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,510
it only makes sense that I get this disease,

231
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:35,120
doesn't it?

232
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:36,870
Yes, it does.

233
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:39,510
Sometimes we wish

234
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:41,000
it was us.

235
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:43,310
Dude.

236
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:44,870
Are you checking in for your wife, too?

237
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:47,590
Your kids?

238
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:50,190
Your mom and dad?

239
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:53,950
My brother.

240
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:55,310
Your brother? You...

241
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:57,000
You're amazing.

242
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,400
Some people can't even care that much about their parents,

243
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,800
but you, as a brother...

244
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,510
You're amazing.

245
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,480
Dude, you're so benevolent.

246
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,160
Virtuous.

247
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,160
Amazing.

248
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:04,720
Really.

249
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:26,760
Hongxiao.

250
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:27,760
Hongxiao.

251
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,000
I got an appointment with an expert today.

252
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,440
Did you spend a lot of money?

253
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:37,190
I didn't.

254
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:38,480
By the way, Hongxiao,

255
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,800
they say

256
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,950
this specialist is a special doctor

257
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:44,800
who receives a State Council stipend.

258
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:45,720
That specialist said

259
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,550
that your illness was,

260
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:48,120
in his opinion,

261
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,630
in Beijing terms,

262
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,720
a piece of cake.

263
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,720
Hongxiao, don't worry.

264
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:55,550
You'll be fine.

265
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:57,510
Come on, let's go.

266
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:38,760
Hongguang.

267
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,160
The road is so jammed,

268
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,950
so we won't get there

269
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,160
by twelve.

270
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,190
Let's just go back.

271
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,190
Hongxiao.

272
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:55,440
Don't think too much.

273
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,310
It's not far.

274
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:58,120
We'll be there in no time.

275
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,040
Are you tired?

276
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,160
Close your eyes and rest for a while.

277
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:02,800
Hongxiao.

278
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,510
We'll be right there.

279
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:21,270
For your brother's illness,

280
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:23,720
the local hospitals have used all the medicines

281
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,400
and treatments they have.

282
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,480
Chaozhou Cancer Hospital is one

283
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,190
of the top specialized hospitals in the country in this area,

284
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:33,360
but based on the patient's current physical condition,

285
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:35,190
we don't recommend that the patient

286
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:37,080
go through another round of radiotherapy,

287
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,870
so

288
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:40,310
as a family member of the patient,

289
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:41,510
do you want to reconsider?

290
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,160
Hongxiao.

291
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,160
Tell me.

292
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,720
Did I do something wrong or not?

293
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,040
Hao, eat more.

294
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:21,950
Eat to your heart's content.

295
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,000
This cost me quite a bit of money,

296
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:23,870
so don't waste any.

297
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:25,760
Dig in.

298
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,230
Jiashu,

299
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,480
I've decided to stay here for a while

300
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:39,160
and not go back.

301
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,160
Don't worry,

302
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:43,630
I'll call my mom every day to let her know I'm okay

303
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,950
so they won't worry.

304
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,190
I see.

305
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:55,120
After all, Long's got the food and shelter covered.

306
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,080
Right, Long?

307
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:06,870
You've been quiet for a while, so this is what you're up to, huh?

308
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:07,760
Alright, fine.

309
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,310
Cheers!

310
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,190
Hao, make yourself at home.

311
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:24,510
Just let me know if you need anything.

312
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,040
Thank you, Long.
