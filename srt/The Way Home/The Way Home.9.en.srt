[The Way Home]

00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:21,420
[Episode 9]

3
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:15,820
Great-aunt,

4
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:16,540
you're losing track.

5
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:17,380
It's all over the place.

6
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:19,180
Great-aunt,

7
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:20,220
everyone here

8
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,780
follows your rhythm,

9
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:22,900
so you need to be steady.

10
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,220
You've been making the same mistake every time.

11
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:26,620
I'm sorry.

12
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:27,100
Let's do it again.

13
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,060
No.

14
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:28,620
How about this?

15
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:29,500
Let them rest for a bit first,

16
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,460
then we'll try again. Is that okay?

17
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:32,100
Okay.

18
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,300
All right, guys.

19
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:34,860
Let's take a 10-minute break

20
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:35,740
and grab some water.

21
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:36,340
Sound good?

22
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:37,620
- Sure. - Sure.

23
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:38,500
Great effort, everyone.

24
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,260
That was good.

25
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:44,140
Three,

26
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:46,580
two,

27
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:47,380
one.

28
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:49,940
Three,

29
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:51,260
two,

30
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:52,380
three,

31
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:53,420
four.

32
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:55,420
One,

33
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:56,420
two.

34
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:58,380
Take a break.

35
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:01,780
I'm quite dumb, aren't I?

36
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,460
I can't even get something as simple as drumming right.

37
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,060
Looks like I'm not just bad at studying.

38
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:08,580
I'm useless at everything.

39
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:09,860
Of course not.

40
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,380
This is your first time practicing,

41
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:14,420
and no one masters it on the first try.

42
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:16,540
Really?

43
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,740
The entry requirement for this training

44
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,180
is way too easy.

45
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:24,740
Literally, anyone can sign up.

46
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:26,620
Who are you talking about?

47
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:28,380
It should be obvious.

48
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:30,580
Ruonan,

49
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,540
it's fine if you're pursuing someone,

50
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:34,900
but isn't it a bit inappropriate

51
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,380
to let it affect our competition?

52
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:38,340
You're asking for trouble, aren't you?

53
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,020
Afu,

54
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:40,140
stop it.

55
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,220
It goes without saying

56
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,700
that once that woman gets on the boat,

57
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,820
she'll drag me down.

58
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,380
I dare you to say that again.

59
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:48,180
Sure, I'll say it.

60
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:49,820
My dad said

61
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:50,980
that in the past,

62
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,860
women weren't even allowed on the dragon boat.

63
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,980
If we lose after you get on,

64
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:55,660
can you take the blame?

65
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,460
This is a serious competition.

66
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,020
Who says women can't participate?

67
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:01,420
Besides, if a woman joins and the boat sinks,

68
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:02,220
and you guys are this useless,

69
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:02,940
it might as well just sink.

70
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:04,500
Chen Ruonan,

71
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:06,300
you should stop talking as well.

72
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:07,340
What?

73
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,180
Are you mad because I'm embarrassing you in front of others?

74
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:10,940
Don't lecture me about what's right.

75
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,420
Since we were kids,

76
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,820
I've always let you have the good things at home first,

77
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,460
and I've always let you pick the best things first.

78
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,340
You know full well why.

79
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,540
And today, I'm telling you,

80
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:21,540
I'm boarding this boat

81
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:22,700
for sure!

82
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:27,380
Actually,

83
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,260
this is Ruonan's first training session.

84
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,500
It's already impressive that she can keep up with most of it.

85
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:33,940
She just needs more time.

86
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:35,140
Also,

87
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,620
we're training together,

88
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:37,620
so we should be supportive of one another.

89
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:38,700
Supportive?

90
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:39,740
What do you mean by that?

91
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:42,060
You two are in perfect sync,

92
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,140
always looking out for each other.

93
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,500
When are you coming to propose to the Chen family,

94
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,020
the only one?

95
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:51,580
What nonsense are you talking about?

96
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:52,980
I swear I'll rip your mouth off today!

97
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:54,340
- Was I wrong in what I said? - Ruonan.

98
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:55,300
Didn't you say something wrong?

99
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,580
Say it again if you've got the nerve!

100
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,100
- Wait. - I dare you to say it again!

101
00:04:59,060 --> 00:04:59,820
- Enough! - Jiahao.

102
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:03,180
What are you all doing?

103
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,300
Who are you?

104
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:10,860
Stand straight.

105
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:13,100
I forgot to introduce him to you all.

106
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:14,380
This

107
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:16,140
is the martial arts school's specially appointed coach,

108
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,100
who'll be overseeing your training camp.

109
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:25,420
You always make things difficult for me.

110
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:26,940
Didn't I tell you to stay in the office?

111
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:27,980
What are you doing out here?

112
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:30,580
Who

113
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,060
was causing a scene out there just now?

114
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:39,580
Sorry.

115
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:41,660
We shouldn't have fought

116
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:42,980
just now.

117
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:44,700
Let me tell you,

118
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,020
dragon boat racing

119
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:47,660
is all about teamwork.

120
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:49,860
Only by working together

121
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:51,300
can you reach the finish line.

122
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,580
And here you are, already fighting among yourselves.

123
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:56,180
It seems

124
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,500
that this boat will capsize before it even sets off!

125
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:06,420
Everyone, go downstairs

126
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:07,740
and run ten kilometers as punishment.

127
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:09,100
Ten kilometers?

128
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,020
Got a problem?

129
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:11,900
No.

130
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,900
Downstairs! Now!

131
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,220
Specially appointed coach, huh?

132
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,460
You really know how to cause me trouble.

133
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:35,300
I can't even make a complaint?

134
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,940
I'm here cleaning up your mess every day.

135
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,220
Maybe I should stop calling it the Chen family martial arts school

136
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:45,780
and just take the surname "He." Happy now?

137
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:56,380
Jiahao.

138
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:57,980
Thanks, Dad.

139
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,260
How was the training today?

140
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:03,140
Still keeping up okay?

141
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:04,620
It went well,

142
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,340
though my legs are a bit sore.

143
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:09,740
Have some more food.

144
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:12,620
But

145
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,740
the coach said I've improved.

146
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:16,820
Good,

147
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:18,260
but

148
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:20,340
finish your homework right after dinner.

149
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,540
No slacking off on your studies.

150
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:22,540
Got it.

151
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:23,820
Come on.

152
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:26,300
The kid knows what he's doing.

153
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:30,140
How come I'm allowed to drink today?

154
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,220
It's because we're in a good mood.

155
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,220
You can only have one can,

156
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,180
so go easy on it.

157
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,580
You're telling me to take it easy with just one can of beer?

158
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,700
You're something else.

159
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,540
Let's drink.

160
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,540
Drink slowly, all right?

161
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:47,580
Dad, take it easy. Here you are.

162
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,180
Dig in.

163
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:50,980
Have some more.

164
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:52,340
Eat some veggies.

165
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:52,820
Thanks, Mom.

166
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:05,300
Dad,

167
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:07,860
who says that after that illegitimate kid leaves,

168
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,260
the He family will be left with no heirs?

169
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:10,660
I think Jiahao

170
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:11,940
is much better than him.

171
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:15,020
That's Jiashu,

172
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:16,900
your nephew.

173
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:19,020
How can you call him that?

174
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:20,860
He's not my nephew.

175
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:22,900
I have nothing to do with him.

176
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,140
Listen.

177
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:32,100
I'm getting older,

178
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:33,780
and I've come to terms

179
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,620
with a lot of things.

180
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:37,580
Even though

181
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:39,300
he's not from our bloodline,

182
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:40,860
he's still

183
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:43,260
a part of the He family.

184
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,660
After all these years,

185
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:47,860
it's time

186
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,300
to let go of that grudge.

187
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:53,500
Why not

188
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:56,660
bring Jiashu back to the family?

189
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:58,700
What do you think?

190
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:03,660
Dad,

191
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:05,860
you should get some rest.

192
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:07,380
I'll head out now.

193
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:15,780
Jiahao.

194
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:19,820
Auntie told me to bring medicine to Grandpa.

195
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:20,820
All right.

196
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:21,820
Go ahead.

197
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:24,340
Dad.

198
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:28,620
Why?

199
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:31,380
What do you mean, why?

200
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:34,020
Why can't you accept my cousin?

201
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:36,580
He didn't do anything wrong.

202
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:40,820
How many times have I told you?

203
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,220
You don't have a cousin.

204
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:06,780
Try this.

205
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:13,460
Rong.

206
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,620
Why are you only having alcohol and no food?

207
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:17,780
Is it not to your liking?

208
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:24,460
Hello, who is this?

209
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:25,500
Lin Junrong,

210
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,700
when will you pay the outstanding amount?

211
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:29,220
If you don't have the money,

212
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,420
I'll give it to someone else.

213
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,020
Bro,

214
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,660
just give me two more days, please.

215
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:37,220
No more time for you,

216
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:38,460
today's the deadline.

217
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:39,740
If you don't have the money,

218
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,420
the deal's off,

219
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,340
and I'll look for a new buyer.

220
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:44,180
Fine.

221
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:45,780
Then refund my deposit.

222
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:47,740
What deposit?

223
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,700
You're the one breaching the contract.

224
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:52,220
It's clearly stated in the agreement

225
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,380
that the deposit is non-refundable.

226
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:54,700
What do you mean?

227
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,540
Are you trying to cheat me out of my money?

228
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:58,660
Listen.

229
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:00,180
Return the deposit to me,

230
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:01,300
or

231
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,900
I'll sue you.

232
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,820
Sue me if you like,

233
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:05,980
but the deposit won't be returned.

234
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:07,110
Hello?

235
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,380
What's wrong, Rong?

236
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:21,180
Why are you so worked up?

237
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:24,540
It's nothing.

238
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,620
Just some minor business issues.

239
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,260
The nightclub?

240
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:30,380
What's going on?

241
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:34,140
As I mentioned earlier,

242
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:36,300
I invested in a project,

243
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,380
and I'm just a little short of funds.

244
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:45,300
Xiqiao is so nice,

245
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,780
with gorgeous scenery and lovely people.

246
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,740
I really want to stay,

247
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,940
but if I can't find the money,

248
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:59,220
I'll have to go back home

249
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:02,460
and wrap up the business.

250
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,220
How much do you need to keep things going?

251
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:07,660
One million.

252
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:14,060
Fifty thousand is also fine.

253
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:23,300
You know I'm running a small business,

254
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:25,820
so I can't come up with the money.

255
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:28,220
But don't worry,

256
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,780
while you're staying here with me,

257
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,260
food and drink are all taken care of.

258
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,220
There's still one more dish.

259
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:34,100
I'll bring it out.

260
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,740
Penny-pinching.

261
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:42,740
Rong,

262
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:44,300
the shrimp today is really fresh.

263
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,180
Eat up,

264
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,340
then you'll be able to sleep.

265
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:06,180
Thank you, Jiashu.

266
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:11,940
It's so tasty.

267
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,700
Would you like another bowl then?

268
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,100
One bowl is enough for me.

269
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:30,460
Jiashu,

270
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,500
I was in such a rush when I came out,

271
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:34,060
I forgot my wallet.

272
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:37,250
I asked you to come out.

273
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,900
Do you think I'd let you pay?

274
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,410
Stop being silly.

275
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:42,180
Just eat.

276
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:49,540
Jiashu,

277
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:51,580
why do you think

278
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,660
everyone enjoys sweet food?

279
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:55,780
Is it because we all

280
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:57,420
feel a bit unhappy sometimes?

281
00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:59,140
I guess.

282
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:02,140
Why do people get unhappy?

283
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,100
It's because

284
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:05,780
they think too much.

285
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,460
But you can't just not think at all, can you?

286
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:10,860
That would make you a fool.

287
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,380
What's wrong with being a fool?

288
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:13,500
Just look at Long.

289
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,020
Isn't he doing just fine?

290
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:19,100
Is he aware

291
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,140
of what you're saying about him?

292
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,140
If he is aware,

293
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:24,180
then he won't be a fool, would he?

294
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,460
That actually makes sense.

295
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:30,940
Go ahead and eat.

296
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:33,700
Jiashu,

297
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:36,380
I'd like another bowl of what you've got.

298
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:50,580
I think

299
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:52,820
I forgot to bring money as well.

300
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:54,700
You didn't bring any money either?

301
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:56,860
Then...

302
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:00,700
Then what are we going to do?

303
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:04,020
Sir.

304
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:04,940
Excuse me,

305
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:05,940
two more bowls, please.

306
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:07,100
Sure.

307
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,180
Dig in. My treat.

308
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:24,120
You're back.

309
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,200
Perfect timing. Come over for dinner.

310
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,600
I'm not eating.

311
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:28,840
Don't mind her.

312
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,720
Junli, come over and eat.

313
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,640
Junli.

314
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,120
How did the training go?

315
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:35,640
It went well.

316
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:36,700
By the way,

317
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,000
He Jiahao also went to train.

318
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,000
Is that so?

319
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:43,000
I was wondering why He Hongguang has been so confident lately.

320
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,080
Turns out this is the reason.

321
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,320
I've never heard of He Jiahao knowing how to row,

322
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,120
and He Jiashu never taught him.

323
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,880
What is the He family thinking?

324
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,000
They've put a rookie on the team

325
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,320
just to save face.

326
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,280
This is lowering the level of our village.

327
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,440
Dad.

328
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,240
Come here and sit down.

329
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,640
What exactly happened to the He family?

330
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,800
Why did He Jiashu leave?

331
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,240
You don't understand.

332
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,160
You were just a kid at the time.

333
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,360
Their family was a mess.

334
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,760
Why was it a mess?

335
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,080
Why was it a mess?

336
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,640
He Hongxiao was cuckolded by his wife,

337
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:17,960
and that child

338
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,720
isn't even his.

339
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,000
He Jiashu

340
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,480
really isn't a member of the He family?

341
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,920
What's so surprising?

342
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:27,000
He Hongxiao was so sick.

343
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,600
It's no wonder his wife ran off with someone.

344
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,520
As for the details,

345
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,920
I don't really know

346
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:35,880
or understand,

347
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,840
but there are all kinds of rumors.

348
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,560
Some say she ran off with someone,

349
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,760
others say she took the money and left.

350
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,640
Either way, it's not good.

351
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,440
Listen to me, Junli,

352
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,400
their family's cursed,

353
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:47,840
so don't get involved with them.

354
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,400
Why say such things in front of the child?

355
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,640
What?

356
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,880
They have the cheek to do it, but I'm not allowed to talk about it?

357
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,520
He Hongxiao

358
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,320
was always sick,

359
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,600
yet his wife didn't even care

360
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:01,880
and she went out all the time.

361
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,480
I said back then

362
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,880
that something was bound to happen.

363
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,440
But I never expected it

364
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:07,760
to blow up like this.

365
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,200
Isn't this ruining the reputation

366
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,280
of our Xiqiao village?

367
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,560
If I were He Hongxiao,

368
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,560
I'd be furious too.

[Xiqiao No.1 High School]

370
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,520
[Parent-teacher meeting on Friday]
The parent-teacher meeting

371
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,400
should have been held after the last midterm exam,

372
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,240
but

373
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,840
the school kept having events that got in the way.

374
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:29,720
This week,

375
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,960
we will definitely hold the meeting.

376
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,520
Don't forget to inform your parents

377
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,920
after school on Friday evening.

378
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:36,760

Jiashu,

385
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,280
can you attend the parent-teacher meeting for me?

386
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,040
Our school is having one this week,

387
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,360
and my grades have dropped quite a bit.

388
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,760
I'm afraid if my dad goes,

389
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,360
he'll get upset and lose face.

390
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,480
If he gets angry, he might stop me from rowing.

391
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:32,840
So, Jiashu,

392
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,680
can you attend it for me?

393
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:40,960

394
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,720
you don't want too many people to see you.

It's okay.

396
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,680
Don't feel pressured.

I

398

in many students' performances,

435
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:54,940
with some experiencing major drops in their scores.

436
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:56,620
Of course,

437
00:20:56,620 --> 00:21:00,020
this is partly due to the increased difficulty

438

and intensity of the curriculum this semester.

439
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,460
Therefore, we encourage

the people I respect most

are those who are well-educated.

464
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:10,540
Back then, we didn't have the resources to go to school,

465
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,660
so it wasn't an option.

466
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,220

Isn't that right?

487
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,860
Do you have anything else to add?

488
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:18,540
Well,

489
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:21,380
I didn't see He Jiahao's father today.

490
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:23,340
I mean

491
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:26,900
Jiahao has always been the top scorer,

492
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,740
but he seems to have slipped this time.

00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,180
About studying,

494
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:32,260
I believe

495
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:35,940
we shouldn't only share our successes,

496
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:38,860
but also our failures.

497
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:39,980
Don't you think?

498
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:41,860
So,

499
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:44,580
is Mr. He not here today?

500
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:48,820
He Jiahao's cousin is here.

501
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,500
His father is sick.

502
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:51,740
He's sick?

503
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:53,140
Such bad timing.

504
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:55,220
I've never seen him fall ill

505
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:56,540
when his son was top of the class.

506
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,260
I've never seen him fall ill, you know.

507
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:02,020
Anyway,

508
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:04,180
since his cousin is here,

509
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,900
let's have him

510
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:07,900
share some experience with us.

511
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:28,340
Let's give him a round of applause!

512
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:42,740
It's true

513
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:44,780
that Jiahao didn't do that well this time,

514
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:49,020
but it's not that bad.

515
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:50,980
Look.

516
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:53,420
He's ranked 10th in the class,

517
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:56,660

behind him.

519
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:07,140
Besides,

520
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:09,780
no one stays at the top forever,

521
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,500
and no one is always at the bottom.

522
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:13,980
After all,

523
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:16,500
anything is possible.

524
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:17,980
Exactly.

525
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:20,460
My son Afu's performance isn't too bad either.

526
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:21,140
Right?

527
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:29,020
From the moment we're born,

528
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:33,820
the whole world starts scoring us:

00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:36,580
doctors,

530
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:38,460
parents,

531
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:40,820
teachers, classmates, and even partners.

532
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,820
They all want us

533
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,500
to be flawless and live up to their ideals.

534
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:53,020
Gradually,

535
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:56,740
we start holding ourselves to the same expectations.

536
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:00,700
But

537
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:05,940
we are only human,

538
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,420
not omnipotent.

539
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:10,580
We can't please everyone.

540
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:15,660
So,

541
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:19,660
when I saw your exam results,

542
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:21,660
to be honest,

543
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:24,700
I was happy.

544
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:32,620
