She even asked me to go there tomorrow too.

You're old enough to take care of yourself.

If you can,

118
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:18,120
make tea yourself from now on.

119
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:22,720
Wait, I...

120
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:28,440
It's all your fault.

121

Geez.

It's only morning,

123
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,000
but not even food can stop you from talking.

124
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:35,590
I'm just being honest.

125
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:37,830
How can I be as stubborn and duplicitous as you are?

126
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:39,870
You deserve it.

That's right.

129

No need. There's a bunch of stuff here.

135
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:09,480
Just tidy it up.

136
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,440

I called you all here today to talk,

164

In Xiqiao,

167
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,680
for a hundred years,

168
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,950
if there's a problem, we've all talked it out together.

169
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:12,680
There's nothing that can't be solved by all of us together.

170
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,000
Are two simple things like that

171
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,040
worth all this bickering?

172
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,950
I'll ask again.

173
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,830
Do you agree with the revision of the genealogy?

174
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:22,830
Yes, we do.

175
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,190
We do agree,

176
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:27,160
but the money...

177
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,270
We'll put our money together.

178
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:31,760
Those who have money will pay,

179
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:33,190
and those who don't will contribute labor.

180
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:34,000
Right.

181
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:35,400
No problem.

182
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,190

00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,080
This time, the whole town is participating in the race,

194
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:03,680
but the venue is still Xiqiao Village,

195
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:07,480
and we're in charge of everything.

196
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,950
This makes here the home field.

197
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:13,480
Since we have such a great advantage,

198
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,510
we should find a way to unite,

199
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:17,160
make a hit,

200
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,680
and show it to the villagers of the neighboring villages.

201
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,190
- Right. - Yes.

202
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,400
Show them.

203
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,080
That makes sense.

204
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,120
So,

205
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,360
I propose that, as per the old rules,

206
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,270
you take charge of whatever

207
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:30,760
you were in charge of in previous years.

208
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:32,190
That way, nothing goes wrong.

209
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:34,830
Chief.

210
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,230
You're saying

211
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,830
that in past years, the He family has organized the race,

212
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,630
so this year it's also them?

213
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,000
That's right. Hasn't it always been like that?

214
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,230
The He family has lasted for over 100 years,

215
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,160
and Mr. He Senior is highly respected.

216
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,680
In the old days,

217
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,360
I wouldn't have had any objection

218
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,720
to the He family hosting it,

219
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:54,910
but we all know

220
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,270
that the He family

221
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:57,360
is in a bad way.

222
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,120
Mr. He Senior is in a coma.

223
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,270
There is no one to run the family.

224
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:04,000
And eight years ago,

225
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,950
the scandal of the He family

226
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:08,080
was known in and outside the village.

227
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,080
Now, speaking of the He family,

228
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,120
one will think

229
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,680
of "illegitimate children" and so on.

230
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,830
It would be a shame

231
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:18,910
for Xiqiao Village

232
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:19,950
if everyone in the other villages

233
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:22,080
heard these rumors.

234
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:23,440
Everyone, right?

235
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:24,310
Yes.

236
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:28,080
Chief, I don't want to think too much.

237
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,360
It's been years,

238
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:32,830
but

239
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,270
that idiot,

240
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:35,400
Lin Junrong,

241
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,230
went to the school and made trouble.

242
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:38,830
Really?

243
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,800
Absolutely true.

244
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,590
How bad could it be

245
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:43,360
if the word got out?

246
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,270
Yes, that's right.

247
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,680
Their family is not moral.

248
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,270
Isn't that right?

249
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,830
Everyone, right?

250
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:50,630
Yes, it is.

251
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,800
Chief, He Hongguang

252
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,950
seems like a decent guy,

253
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,400
but to me, he's only what he seems,

254
00:13:59,190 --> 00:13:59,760
right?

255
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,270
Right.

256
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,270
Chief.

257
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:04,120
I'll be the first one to object

258
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:06,230
if the He family organizes the race.

259
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:07,760
Right. I don't agree.

260
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:08,760
I don't agree.

261
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:10,160
Such a guy is just not moral.

262
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,760
What do you want then?

263
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,270
Mr. He.

264
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:16,270
What a coincidence.

265
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:17,230
There you are.

266
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:19,510
I have something to discuss with you.

267
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:21,000
Right, Chief?

268
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:23,870
Chen Decai.

269
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,550
I'm here.

270
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,830
Just talk to me if there's anything.

271
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,830
Why bother Chief?

272
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:34,630
That's right.

273
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:38,950
It's not a big deal.

274
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,480
It's about the dragon boat race.

275
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,360
We don't think the He family

276
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:46,760
is worthy of hosting the race

277
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,360
and would like you to transfer the hosting rights

278
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:52,590
so that we can have a fair competition.

279
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,510
It's for the honor of the village.

280
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:04,590
Fine.

281
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,360
If that's what you all think,

282
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:10,950
I agree.

283
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:17,630
He.

284
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:19,950
He.

285
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:22,480
Do you really agree?

286
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,040
Are you sure you don't want the hosting rights?

287
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,160
Chief.

288
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,160
They have a point.

289
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:31,830
My father

290
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:33,120
is still in bed,

291
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,510
and the younger members

292
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,630
are not doing well,

293
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:39,440
so I don't really have the heart

294
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,630
to do anything for the village now.

295
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:46,400
Let those who want to do it do it.

296
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,950
A lot has happened to the He family over the years.

297
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:55,230
It wasn't easy

298
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:56,720
for him to take it on.

299
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,230
His father is still in a coma,

300
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,440
so are we

301
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:02,360
taking advantage of the situation?

302
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,590
Mr. He.

303
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,270
Mr. He.

304
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:14,830
Actually,

305
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:18,270
what happened to your family can definitely pass.

306
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:21,270
I think your dad

307
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:22,510
was blessed.

308
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:24,830
It won't be long before he wakes up.

309
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:26,400
Don't worry.

310
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,310
We're all folks

311
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,630
and seeing each other every day.

312
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,510
If you need my help,

313
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:32,590
just let me know.

314
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:35,040
I'm sure I can help.

315
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,360
No need.

316
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:41,950
Just don't take advantage of the situation.

317
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,760
Do it right.

318
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:45,080
What the...

319
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:45,950
Are you looking down on me?

320
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:47,800
I'm not well educated,

321
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,800
but I know how to be moral.

322
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,400
Don't be so narrow-minded about my generosity.

323
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,000
Listen to me.

324
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:53,760
If you...

325
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,230
That's enough.

326
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:54,950
need help, don't come to me.

327
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:55,310
Enough!

328
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:57,950
He's given up his hosting rights,

329
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,360
so stop complaining.

330
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:00,440
Chief.

331
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:01,950
He's so narrow-minded.

332
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:02,760
So selfish.

333
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:03,190
That's enough.

334
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:04,760
I don't like this kind of feisty person.

335
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,870
Go back...

336
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,630
So selfish.

337
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:12,400
When you get back,

338
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,950
go over this question again.

339
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:15,950
That's all for today.

340
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:16,630
Class dismissed.

341
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:17,800
Stand up.

342
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,950
See you,

343
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,160
ma'am.

344
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:35,310
He Jiahao.

345
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:37,440
What?

346
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,510
Is your dad okay?

347
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,510
My dad?

348
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,760
What happened to my dad?

349
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:44,720
I heard that your dad was so angry with you

350
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,080
and your cousin that he even gave us the right

351
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,160
to host the dragon boat race.

352
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,630
I didn't realize

353
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:50,040
you were so powerful.

354
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:52,550
Really?

355
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:53,040
He

356
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,120
gave it away?

357
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:54,760
Voluntarily?

358
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,440
I don't know.

359
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:01,270
He even gave away the hosting rights he's always valued,

360
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:03,000
so it seems like

361
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:04,590
he's really pissed off this time.

362
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,400
Chen Junli.

363
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,040
Don't be alarmist.

364
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,040
What Uncle He said was

365
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,080
that he gave it away because he didn't have the heart

366
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:13,950
to work on it due to Jiahao's grandfather's poor health,

367
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:16,480
but why are you adding fuel to the fire here?

368
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:17,950
Good advice is harsh.

369
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,080
I always tell you to read more,

370
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:20,630
but you don't listen to me.

371
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:22,510
Would it kill you not to talk?

372
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:23,310
Yes.

373
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:24,830
Jiahao.

374
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,310
There's a new oyster store in front of the school.

375
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:28,590
You know what? It's really good.

376
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,310
Let's go together.

377
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:30,040
Afu.

378
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,040
Why do you eat all the time?

379
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,910
Why do you lecture people all the time?

380
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:36,120
Can you take the blame for him if he's overweight in the unified exam?

381
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:38,830
Like an old man.

382

Jiashu.

411

my grandpa is sick,

413
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:01,950
so I'm not going to leave for a while

414
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,510
and will continue to coach you.

415
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:05,630
Friday night, if you're free,

416
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:06,720
come to my house for dinner

417
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:07,590
and to talk

418
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:08,590
about the game.

419
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:09,800
All of you.

00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:10,950
We'll discuss it together.

421
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,760
I'll be there early

422
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,040
to help you.

423
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,360
Remember. All of you.

424
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:21,910
But I...

425
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:24,360
We'll be there.

426
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:26,440
It's a deal.

427
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,310
Ask Long about the location.

428
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,120
He knows.

429
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,160

Hao, you're not in a hurry to get back to your homework today, are you?

434
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:45,910
- Maybe not. -Okay.

435
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:47,310
Let's go shopping.

Jiahao.

441
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,360
This is...?

442
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:00,590
Uncle Liu.

443
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:01,720
This is my cousin, Jiashu.

444
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:02,950
Jiashu?

445
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,120
You've grown up.

446
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:09,720
How's your wife these days?

447
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:11,950
She's been fine for a few years.

448
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:13,590
Thanks for thinking of her.

449
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,630
Okay, Uncle Liu.

450
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,950

Wait for me.

455
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,000
Uncle Liu.

00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,120
Give me more strawberries.

457
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:24,310
No problem.

458
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:25,120
Thank you, Uncle Liu.

459
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,000
Mrs. Wang, long time no see.

460
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:30,950
You're younger.

461
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:31,910
You are...?

462
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:33,160
Isn't this Jiahao?

It's been a long time.

467
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,270
What kind of food do you want to buy?

468
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:41,400
I'll give you a discount.

469
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,720

Jiashu.

490
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:26,680
Aren't you being a little high-profile?

491
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:28,630
What?

492
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,190
Nothing.

493
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:31,230
Let's go home.

494
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:32,360
No rush.
