[Episode 15]

3
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:23,910
Where should we meet tomorrow?

4
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,230
Tomorrow,

5
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,550
I'll take you guys

6
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:32,040
to my secret hideout.

7
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:47,270
Afu,

8
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:48,510
stop fooling around.

9
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:55,120
We need to finish

10
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,190
all the lanterns in the next few days,

11
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:59,040
so it's a tight schedule with heavy tasks.

12
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,080
I hope everyone can help.

13
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:03,360
Now, I'll teach you how to make the lanterns.

14
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:05,720
First, the frame.

15
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,510
The lighter the frame, the better.

16
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:10,910
Ruonan.

17
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:16,120
Use lightweight materials if you can.

18
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,040
Usually,

19
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,120
large lanterns are fixed with iron wire,

20
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:19,680
and smaller ones

21
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,550
are fine with bamboo strips.

22
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,230
Feel free to give it a try.

23
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:33,160
Next comes the shaping,

24
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,800
which is the hardest and most important step.

25
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:38,550
If you're not sure about the shape,

26
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,870
you can first sketch it on paper

27
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,950
and use that as a guide.

28
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:42,550
Do it like this,

29
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,480
and then just follow the sketch.

30
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:45,680
I'll give it a shot.

31
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:49,160
Here.

32
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:57,590
Jiahao, how do I do this?

33
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,120
Why does mine look so bad?

34
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:03,760
Don't use too much force at first.

35
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,910
Use a delicate touch.

36
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:07,360
You need to create a curve on the draft paper

37
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:08,510
like this.

38
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:14,190
Look at the paper, not at me.

39
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:17,950
This is how it's done.

40
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:21,000
Like this.

41
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:24,510
Thanks.

42
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:24,910
No worries.

43
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:30,680
The next step is to install the lights.

44
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,910
Be sure not to install them after the papering.

45
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:35,270
When setting up the lights,

46
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:37,160
leave a small gap between them and the fabric

47
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:37,950
to ensure there are no dim corners.

48
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:39,510
Like this.

49
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:48,550
The final step is papering and decoration.

50
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:51,830
We'll glue the paper

51
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:53,040
or fabric together,

52
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,230
and then you can color it,

53
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:56,910
draw, or add cutouts based on your preferences.

54
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:58,120
Try it out, guys.

55
00:03:58,510 --> 00:03:59,080
- Okay. - Okay.

56
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:01,000
So, Hao,

57
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:01,440
can I

58
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,160
use all these colors?

59
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:03,910
Of course.

60
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:04,550
So,

61
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,040
I can do it however I like?

62
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:06,760
Yes.

63
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:29,120
You need to press it down firmly before you can glue it.

64
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,910
I'm not done yet.

65
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,550
Chen Junli,

66
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:36,480
I never thought there would be something you couldn't do well.

67
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:38,160
I'm just inexperienced.

68
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:40,800
You've been working on this all morning and still haven't nailed it?

69
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:44,590
All right,

70
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:46,870
I'll be generous and show you how it's done today.

71
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:48,910
Take this one. It's better.

72
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:52,590
First, loosen the bamboo strip a little.

73
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:55,230
Like this. Then,

74
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,040
shape it into a circle.

75
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,400
Once you've got that,

76
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,120
hold it down with your right hand.

77
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:04,360
That's right. Next,

78
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,720
grab a piece of tape

79
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,000
and start wrapping it tightly from the right side.

80
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:12,510
Make sure it's tight.

81
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:13,950
Don't do it like you just did.

82
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,510
Wrap it like this.

83
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:19,760
Go around two or three times.

84
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:22,400
The excess strip...

85
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,760
If you don't have any, then don't worry about it.

86
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:28,270
Just bend the excess strip upward like this.

87
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,950
Okay. Then bend it alternately to the left and right.

88
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:34,870
Good.

89
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:36,630
Now, tweak the circle a bit.

90
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,120
Loop, press,

91
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,480
and there you go, it's round.

92
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:42,760
That looks great.

93
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,400
Junli,

94
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,830
still haven't got the hang of it yet?

95
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:47,400
Check out my big bow. Pretty, isn't it?

96
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:49,720
What is this thing you've made?

97
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:51,160
It's a bow.

98
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,080
What do you think?

99
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,270
Does it look good?

100
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,230
Am I the first one to finish?

101
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:00,590
What's wrong with you, Chen Long'an?

102
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:02,160
What's the problem?

103
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,950
Artists are supposed to be like this.

104
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:06,120
Aren't the figures in the Gourd Palace

105
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:06,950
all like this?

106
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,120
I think it looks good.

107
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:12,760
No, Long. This piece might not make it out there.

108
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,800
Well, hanging it in the house should be fine, right?

109
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:20,040
Sure.

110
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,190
Ms. Qiu Qiu, what are you drawing?

111
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:35,950
Wait a minute.

112
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:41,120
Isn't this Jiashu?

113
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:45,120
- Check this out. - Chen Ruonan!

114
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:47,310
- Ms. Qiu's drawing of Jiashu. - Give it back.

115
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:48,440
- Look. - Chen Ruonan.

116
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,080
- Ms. Qiu Qiu was drawing Jiashu. - Give it back.

117
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,120
Give it back.

118
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:52,830
Jiashu,

119
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,080
check out Ms. Qiu's drawing of you.

120
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:56,120
It's pretty spot-on.

121
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,630
Got nothing to do? All finished?

122
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,480
I just had a new idea.

123
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,510
I'm going to have some water.

124
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,040
It does look like you.

125
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:19,800

I'll treat you to a meal

let's get back to work.

162
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,510
- Sure. - Come on.

163
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:03,710
- We've got this. - We've got this.

164
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:15,860
Do you not want to sleep a bit more?

165
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:19,900
I can't sleep now.

166
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:26,660
I used to think making rabbit lanterns was hard,

167
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:28,790
and it turns out

168
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,790
I still can't get the hang of it.

169
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:35,300
It's okay.

170
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:37,190
I'll guide you through it

171
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:38,540

00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:47,260
Hao,

173
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:49,660
thank you.

174
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:51,220
Why are you thanking me?

175
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:53,030
Teaching you

176
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,190
is also helping me.

177
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,300
That's not what I'm talking about.

178
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,070
Before, I thought

179
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:05,110
that as long as I forgot everything from the past,

180
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:07,430
I could start over.

181
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:08,620
But

182
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:16,220
after coming back and seeing you,

183
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,120
Grandpa, Auntie,

184
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:25,310
and Uncle,

185
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:27,510
I realized

186
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,160
I don't want to forget.

187
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:35,910
I want to go home.

188
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:02,910
