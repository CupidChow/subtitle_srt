00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:21,300
[Episode 14]

3
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:24,080
Okay.

4
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:25,550
Jiashu.

5
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,190
Aren't you being a little high-profile?

6
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,160
What?

7
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,720
Nothing.

8
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:32,760
Let's go home.

9
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:33,760
No rush.

10
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:35,510
We'll go somewhere else.

11
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:38,080
Where is it?

12
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:54,720
Chief.

13
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:56,080
Who is it?

14
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,800
Why come to me until after work?

15
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:01,000
Chief.

16
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,190
You're still in good spirits.

17
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:05,870
Hello, Chief.

18
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:09,910
Long time no see.

19
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:10,800
Did you miss me?

20
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,000
You...

21
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,400
You're Shu.

22
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,080
I told you our chief

23
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,590
had good eyesight and memory.

24
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:26,760
I lost.

25
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:33,310
Jiashu, you've grown so much.

26
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:34,630
You've grown so much.

27
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:38,230
Where have you been all these years since you left Xiqiao?

28
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:40,950
Chaozhou.

29
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:43,550
Chaozhou is good,

30
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:45,910
much better than a small place like Xiqiao.

31
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,510
It's not bad.

32
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:49,910
Have you told your family

33
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:51,190
since you've been back?

34
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:55,270
Yes.

35
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:56,720
My uncle was pretty pissed off at me.

36
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,510
By the way, Chief,

37
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:04,830
I have something serious to tell you.

38
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:07,680
What is it?

39
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:10,590
There's going to be a dragon boat race in the village,

40
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,680
and Xiqiao Village is going to compete with other villages,

41
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:15,360
so we can't afford to be dishonorable.

42
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,950
Do you want to compete on behalf of the He family?

43
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:24,760
Sort of.

44
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,000
Jiashu.

45
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,590
And, Chief,

46
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,230
I'd like to donate some money

47
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:34,630
to our village on behalf of the He family.

48
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,230
It's time to renovate the ancestral shrine,

49
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,270
and it costs money to organize the competition.

50
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:57,040
By the way, Jiashu,

51
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,590
I still don't understand

52
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:02,310
what you mean by donating money.

53
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:05,160
I told you that the money belongs to the He family.

54
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,270
Since you don't want it,

55
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:07,400
I'll donate it to the village

56
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,400
in the name of the He family.

57
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,720
Isn't that good?

58
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:11,950
So

59
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,000
you still don't consider yourself a member of the He family?

60
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,760
I do.

61
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:16,360
My family name is He,

62
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:17,720
so of course, I'm one of the He family.

63
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,400
And I specifically asked Chief to make sure

64
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,720
my name was added to the new genealogy,

65
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,910
bolded and darkened,

66
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:24,190
in case your dad overlooked it.

67
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,590
I said

68
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:29,480
money talks.

69
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,590
In the future, if someone offers you money,

70
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:31,720
you must take it.

71
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,680
Don't be like a fool.

72
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,400
What are you doing?

73
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:44,720
Nothing.

74
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,270
Do you need butter for frying chicken breast?

75
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,800
I only added a little bit.

76
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,630
Is this a little bit?

77
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,480
It's a big piece.

78
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,440
No. I really only added a little bit.

79
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,630
I haven't eaten it in ages.

80
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:54,270
It's not for you today.

81
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,040
Go out and run a few laps.

82
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:55,910
Wait, Jiashu.

83
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:09,360
One, two.

84
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:11,510
Move it forward a little more as you go forward.

85
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:12,270
Right.

86
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,080
Move your body up.

87
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:15,630
Junli, well done.

88
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:17,590
Afu, good. Look at them both.

89
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,590
Right. Move your body up.

90
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:20,830
Right.

91
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,160
Hold it, you two.

92
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:24,510
Very good.

93
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:29,230
Hold on. Very good.

94
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,510
Come on.

95
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:25,400
Good.

96
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,270
You're improving fast.

97
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,160
Ma'am, how much?

98
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:35,720
You know what?

99
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,760
He Jiashu is back.

100
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,800
Which He Jiashu?

101
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:41,120
The illegitimate child of the He family.

102
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:43,800
Why has he come back?

103
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
He must have come back to fight for the family property.

104
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:48,400
Wasn't he kicked out?

105
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,630
He recently returned to Xiqiao.

106
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,440
Liu saw him with his own eyes.

107
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:54,360
The He family really isn't at peace.

108
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,230
Of course, they are always like this.

109
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:57,230
What else is going on?

110
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,720
The eldest grandson of the He family came back.

111
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,160
He Hongguang is so angry with that.

112
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:03,160
Mr. He Senior was so angry that he was hospitalized.

113
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,590
He's alive or dead.

114
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:06,360
I've heard

115
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,080
- and seen it with my own eyes. - Really?

116
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,190
The He family's second grandson

117
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:12,400
and the illegitimate child are like brothers.

118
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:13,510
Yes, they are.

119
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,480
I heard He Hongguang dared not go out these days.

120
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,440
Play a card.

121
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:16,830
Play a card.

122
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,760
I heard that Jiashu was back.

123
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,080
Yes.

124
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:22,190
I told you.

125
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:23,160
That was him.

126
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,000
I couldn't be wrong.

127
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:27,680
The boy's gotten so tall

128
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,000
that I couldn't even be sure it was him.

129
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,590
Yeah. It's been eight years.

130
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:31,800
He's very tall now.

131
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:32,910
So, your brother

132
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:34,550
can't stand Jiashu?

133
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,800
They've been a family for so many years,

134
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:39,720
so how can they not see each other for so long?

135
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,000
Jiashu even donated money to the village

136
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,160
on behalf of the He family.

137
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:44,760
I heard

138
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,190
that he also contributed money

139
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:47,550
to the village's new genealogy.

140
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:49,000
What did you say?

141
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:58,040
Hongguang, forget it.

142
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:58,830
Let's go back.

143
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:00,160
Forget what?

144
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,120
I have to ask him to give me an explanation today.

145
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:03,080
He Jiashu.

146
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:04,950
He Jiashu.

147
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,040
He Jiashu.

148
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,590
He Jiashu!

149
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:14,830
He Jiashu!

150
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:15,910
Come out!

151
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,160
He Jiashu.

152
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:24,040
He Jiashu!

153
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,590
Uncle.

154
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:27,630
You're here.

155
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,400
He Jiashu.

156
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:35,270
What are you doing?

157
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:44,950
Hang in there.

158
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,480
Persistence is key to victory.

159
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:48,400
Long,

160
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,480
didn't you say it wasn't far?

161
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:51,800
How much longer will it take?

162
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,080
It's right ahead, just a little further.

163
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,400
If you cut back on junk food,

164
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,270
- it won't feel so far. - I'll carry that for you.

165
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:55,720
No, I'm fine.

166
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:56,550
Just let me carry it for you.

167
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:57,080
I can handle it.

168
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:57,760
Let me help you carry one.

169
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,360
See how solid I am? These muscles aren't just decorations.

170
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:01,720
I'll help you with that.

171
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,000
Thank you, Ms. Qiu.

172
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:07,310
I told you to buy less,

173
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:09,310
but you're practically moving everything we have over to He Jiahao.

174
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:10,680
Didn't you say you weren't coming?

175
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,630
So why are you here?

176
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:12,440
You tagalong.

177
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:14,040
I was just trying to help since you went overboard

178
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:14,950
with your shopping.

179
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:16,680
Instead of gratitude, all I get is this attitude?

180
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,950
I never asked you to help.

181
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,190
Quit acting like a hero.

182
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,510
What?

183
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:21,510
Keep arguing, you two.

184
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,120
Your squabbling is making me feel alive again.

185
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:25,400
- Go away. - Go away.

186
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,510
Why are you being so mean?

187
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:30,360
This is Shu's place.

188
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,160
How can you be so low on energy at your age?

189
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:36,000
Tell you what,

190
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,400
sign up for the fitness classes at my martial arts school,

191
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:39,360
and I'll give you

192
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:41,910
a ten percent discount.

193
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,310
Honestly, I wouldn't do this

194
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:47,230
for anyone else,

195
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:49,440
but I'll make an exception for my great-aunt.

196
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:51,190
What do you think you're doing?

197
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:53,510
Donating money to the villagers' committee

198
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,680
in the He family's name?

199
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,310
Haven't you embarrassed the family enough?

200
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:01,590
Do you really need the whole town to know about it?

201
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:02,870
Uncle,

202
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:04,510
I have the same last name, He.

203
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:06,440
Is there a problem with me donating money

204
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,630
on behalf of the He family?

205
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:08,590
What?

206
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,870
Do you think

207
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,480
your family is the only He family out there?

208
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:17,550
Say what you will,

209
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,510
but if you're so eager to donate money

210
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,080
and show kindness,

211
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,270
go somewhere else.

212
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Represent anyone you want,

213
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:26,590
but not in Xiqiao.

214
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,510
I'm warning you,

215
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,870
take this back now

216
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,590
before we all become a joke to everyone.

217
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,160
I have been a joke

218
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,120
my whole life.

219
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:38,310
Why would I care what others think?

220
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:39,910
Uncle,

221
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,270
you can either pretend

222
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:42,310
this has nothing to do

223
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:44,310
with your He family,

224
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:45,120
or

225
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,230
just accept it gracefully.

226
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,760
The money's already donated.

227
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,720
There's no such thing as taking back a donation.

228
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:52,950
Exactly, Hongguang,

229
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:54,800
what's done is done.

230
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,040
Let's not fuss over it anymore.

231
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,000
Shu's already put the word out.

232
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,270
How can he take it back now?

233
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:01,190
That would only make our He family an even bigger joke.

234
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:02,000
Am I right?

235
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:03,590
Do you think I don't know

236
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:04,830
what he's thinking?

237
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,480
He Jiashu,

238
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,160
you want to be accepted into the He family?

239
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:11,630
Let me make it clear.

240
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,000
Not a chance.

241
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,000
Uncle,

242
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,720
I used to take it to heart

243
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,760
when you said things like this,

244
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,000
but after everything I've been through,

245
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,800
I've grown past that.

246
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,910
Times have changed.

247
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:30,080
The He family isn't yours alone.

248
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Even if you don't acknowledge me,

249
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:33,550
I'm still Grandpa's grandson,

250
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,400
Auntie's nephew,

251
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:40,310
and Jiahao's cousin.

252
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:41,400
As long as I'm here,

253
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,680
I'll look out for them.

254
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,310
Yes,

255
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:55,310
he'll always be my cousin.

256
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:58,400
You brat.

257
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:00,680
After just a few days apart, you've forgotten your manners, huh?

258
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:03,480
You think I can't handle you anymore?

259
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,360
I'm going to set you straight today.

260
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,080
- Wait, Uncle. - Dad.

261
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,440
If you have an issue, come at me.

262
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,800
What's the point of hitting Hao?

263
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:11,830
You think I won't hit you?

264
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,270
Today, I'm going to deal with both of you.

265
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:15,230
Just you wait.

266
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,230
Dad.

267
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,400
Dad, calm down.

268
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,510
Don't.

269
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,400
-They're not kids anymore, don't hit them. - Stay where you are.

270
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,160
- Stop right there. - Don't hit them.

271
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:23,270
He's really going to hit them.

272
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:24,080
Uncle.

273
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,270
- Uncle. - Uncle.

274
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:27,360
Calm down, Uncle. Let's talk this through.

275
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,400
Are you okay?

276
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:30,830
Are you all right?

277
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:31,480
Uncle.

278
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,870
We can sort this out peacefully.

279
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:34,590
Uncle!

280
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:37,480
Don't just stand there and watch.

281
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,550
Come over and help.

282
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:39,040
Hurry!

283
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:39,800
Let me go.

284
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,910
- Calm down, Uncle.- Hurry up.

285
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:41,510
Don't.

286
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:42,270
Don't stop me.

287
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:43,310
Don't stop me!

288
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:44,160
Why are you stopping me?

289
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:44,910
Jiahao, are you okay?

290
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:46,190
Wait.

291
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:47,190
What are you all doing?

292
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:49,310
Let's go. One, two, three, up!

293
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,720
Don't lift me up.

294
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,160
- I'm afraid of heights. - Dad.

295
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,950
He Jiashu, I'll be back.

296
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:57,190
I'm afraid of heights. Let me down.

297
00:13:58,270 --> 00:13:59,440
Don't worry, it's fine.

298
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:00,140
I'll go take a look.

299
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:15,190
How come you two are back together?

300
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,190
Why are you ignoring me?

301
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,360
You and your bad temper.

302
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:21,910
What happened?

303
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,310
Is Chen Decai stirring up trouble again?

304
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,480
No.

305
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:27,950
Come closer now.

306
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,080
I'll explain it to you.

307
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:29,870
What happened?

308
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,720
He went to see Jiashu earlier,

309
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:33,000
but we didn't expect Jiashu

310
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
to have him carried out like a dragon boat.

311
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,830
They say everything has its vanquisher.

312
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:38,830
If we can't handle him,

313
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:40,080
someone else will.

314
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:41,720
Just look at how Jiashu

315
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,830
got him so worked up.

316
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:46,510
Only Jiashu could manage him.

317
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,910
That makes sense now.

318
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,910
To be honest,

319
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:56,190
at first,

320
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,400
I wasn't too happy with Jiashu.

321
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:01,160
But looking at it now,

322
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,910
I can see how kind he is to Jiahao,

323
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,310
even taking him for treatment,

324
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,400
so I've come to terms

325
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,270
with it now.

326
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:14,720
Actually, Jiashu

327
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,480
is a loyal and caring kid.

328
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:19,120
Honestly, what wrong

329
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,000
did Jiashu do back then?

330
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,800
I just don't know when that stubborn person

331
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,360
in the family will understand.

332
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:32,720
Hold on.

333
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,630
Where are you going?

334
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,230
Going to the factory.

335
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,360
This family doesn't have a place for me anymore anyway.

336
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:42,040
You...

337
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:43,400
It's fine.

338
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,910
There's food at the factory.

339
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:46,270
Let him calm down by himself,

340
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:48,270
or he'll have a hard time saving face.

341
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,760
I've stewed a chicken.

342
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:53,720
It's really tasty.

343
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:55,040
Let me go get you a bowl.

344
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:56,480
I'm coming with you.

345
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:21,940
[He Jiashu]

346
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:48,480
Hello.

347
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:49,720
Hongguang.

348
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:50,680
Hongguang.

349
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,720
Chen Decai,

350
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:53,630
what's your game this time?

351
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:56,800
Hongguang, you've got to save me this time.

352
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,480
You've got to help me out.

353
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,000
You've got to help me out, Hongguang.

354
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,000
This tastes really good.

355
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:05,720
This one.

356
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:07,270
This is really good.

357
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,270
Folks,

358
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,680
since today's a good day, I'll say a few more words.

359
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:15,760
What are you doing?

360
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,120
He Jiashu,

361
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,720
we all know how tough these years

362
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,510
have been for you,

363
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:24,720
but

364
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:27,680
from now on,

365
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:29,630
as long as I'm around,

366
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,630
I won't let anyone bully you again.

367
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,230
Are you sure you can protect me?

368
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,400
That's not something you should be saying.

369
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:45,590
All right.

370
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,910
It's not just me.

371
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,190
There's also

372
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,720
your old classmate,

373
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:53,760
Ms. Qiu Qiu,

374
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:55,720
and

375
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:58,510
my excellent student,

376
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,440
He Jiahao,

377
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:03,120
and the rest of us.

378
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,720
We won't let anyone bully you.

379
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,950
Right, everyone?

380
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,230
- Yes. - Yes.

381
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:11,680
- Yes. - Yes.

382
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,310
How old do you think you are?

383
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:18,230
You think you can trick me into giving you alcohol?

384
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:19,830
No, Jiashu.

385
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:21,000
This is iced tea.

386
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:22,230
Iced tea?

387
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:23,950
Your iced tea smells like alcohol.

388
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,310
Here, drink this.

389
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:28,360
I...

390
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:32,040
All right.

391
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,550
Come on, Hao.

392
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:38,870
Here, have some shrimp.

393
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:40,910
The alcohol

394
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,040
can wait.

395
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:43,310
Have this instead.

396
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:50,630
Um,

397
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:54,800
you can have another chicken drumstick.

398
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,040
Little Afro,

399
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,220
if you're going to apologize, do it properly.

400
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:01,140
What's this supposed to mean?

401
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:04,910
I'm sorry.

402
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:06,550
Is that enough?

403
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:09,760
Sorry for what?

404
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:13,510
I promise

405
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:15,440
I won't pick on you again.

406
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:22,160
Chen Afu,

407
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,630
did you ever pick on me?

408
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,120
I don't remember.

409
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:42,040
Afu,

410
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:44,000
maybe

411
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,830
Jiahao just doesn't want to deal with you.

412
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,000
All right. I was joking.

413
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,310
We're even now.

414
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:56,440
Hao,

415
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:59,000
you've learned a few bad things from Jiashu recently.

416
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,040
Nonsense, I never taught him that.

417
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:02,950
It was he who taught me.

418
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:03,630
See.

419
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:06,120
So, considering how you usually are,

420
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,510
do you really not want to interact with us?

421
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:08,710
Of course.

422
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:09,940
Who's got the spare time

423
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:10,790
to deal with you?

424
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:12,030
All right.

425
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:12,980
Stop arguing.

426
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:15,340
After the college entrance exams, you might all go your separate ways

427
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:16,260
and never see each other again.

428
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:17,660
Don't worry.

429
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:20,510
I'll make sure to choose a uni that's far away from him.

430
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:24,620
Don't worry. I'll definitely be the one choosing the uni.

431
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:26,300
I'll be sure to cling to you.

432
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,190
Shameless.

433
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:28,620
- Stop it now. - Who would want you around?

434
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,430
I'll cling to you anyway.

435
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:30,620
Come on. Cheers.

436
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:31,980
Like I'd ever want to drink that.

437
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:33,980
Later I'll...

438
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:35,860
When I finish my exam, you won't...

439
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:36,390
Hey, Auntie.

440
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:37,620
I don't want it. You can eat it yourself.

441
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,070
Ease up on the drink.

442
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:40,860
What's with that attitude?

443
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:42,150
Great-aunt,

444
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:43,980
don't just eat the veggies. There's meat as well.

445
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:46,260
Hello, Auntie.

446
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:47,260
Hao,

447
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:49,980
the lanterns the village prepared for the dragon boat race got soaked,

448
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:52,750
and they want you to help make a new batch to replace them.

449
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:53,660
Auntie,

450
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:54,940
this is a big deal.

451
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:56,150
I'm worried I might mess it up.

452
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:56,940
Is it possible to...?

453
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:59,260
Why the lack of confidence?

454
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:00,660
I have faith in you.

455
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:01,620
It's settled then.

456
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:02,430
I'll wait for your update.

457
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:03,980
Auntie, I...

458
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:20,030
What's the matter?

459
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:23,900
Auntie told me

460
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:26,390
that the lanterns prepared for the dragon boat race in the village

461
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:27,150
got soaked

462
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:28,830
and asked me to hurry up

463
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:29,580
and make replacements.

464
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:31,830
This is a good opportunity.

465
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:34,030
Didn't you want the lanterns to be seen by everyone?

466
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:36,510
But I fear I might mess it up

467
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:38,660
and let everyone down.

468
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:40,980
Let me ask you this.

469
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:42,430
Does making lanterns

470
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:44,430
make you happy?

471
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:45,510
Absolutely.

472
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:48,900
So, do you think

473
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,260
it's more pressure

474
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,620
or more motivation for you?

475
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:55,750
If you feel it's too much pressure,

476
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:57,710
then don't force yourself.

477
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:00,110
After all, the world doesn't revolve around us.

478
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:01,830
If you don't do it, someone else will.

479
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:03,390
The doctor said

480
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:05,660
we should accept all our emotions.

481
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,580
But I don't feel like giving up.

482
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:11,660
I fear disappointing everyone,

483
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:12,900
but I also worry

484
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:14,860
that if I miss this chance,

485
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:16,070
I'll regret it afterward.

486
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:16,790
Then do it.

487
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:18,300
Give it your all.

488
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:20,220
I'll help you.

489
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:24,580
I'll help you too.

490
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:25,510
Count me in as well.

491
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:29,830
Well,

492
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:30,900
um,

493
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:31,940
I'll join you too.

494
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:36,110
My father also told me

495
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:38,390
that whatever you ask for,

496
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:39,580
we

497
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:41,030
will comply.

498
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:44,260
Jiahao,

499
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:46,620
I've seen the lanterns you made before,

500
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:47,710
and they were amazing.

501
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,540
I believe you can do it.

502
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:51,540
Look.

503
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:53,710
So many people are helping you.

504
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:54,860
Even if it doesn't work out,

505
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:56,470
it's not solely on you.

506
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:57,300
Yes,

507
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:59,110
we'll face it together.

508
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:02,390
That won't happen.

509
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:03,940
We'll definitely pull it off.

510
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:04,900
Come on.

511
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:05,390
We've got this.

512
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:06,070
- Cheers. - Cheers.

513
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:12,190
Dig in.

514
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:15,750
It's just making some lanterns,

515
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:17,710
how hard can it be?

516
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:19,980
Two flimsy sticks,

517
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:22,540
a little poking around, and they should come together.

518
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:23,540
What do you know?

519
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:25,620
Those with less strength can't even bend them.

520
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:29,580
Lacking strength? Join the fitness classes at my martial arts school then.

521
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:30,340
This time,

522
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:31,510
I'll definitely give you

523
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:32,470
a fifty percent discount.

524
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:34,940
Where should we meet tomorrow?

525
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:38,220
Tomorrow,

526
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:40,580
I'll take you guys

527
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:43,030
to my secret hideout.
