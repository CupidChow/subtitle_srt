while others have left.

190
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:01,180
What else do you want?

191
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,030
What else do you want?

192
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:03,180
- Dad. - Dad.

193
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,780
I've lived to this age,

194
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:09,430
and in my final years, all I wanted was for the family

195
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:10,950
to be together and enjoy each other's company.

196
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:13,390
But now, my grandson's gone,

197
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:15,310
and you won't even go look for him.

198
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:17,710
With how this family has turned out,

199
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:19,630
how can I not be angry?

200
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:21,110
Dad.

201
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:22,860
Are you going or not?

202
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:24,860
Dad, please don't be angry.

203
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:26,260
I'll go.

204
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:27,460
I'll go, all right?

205
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:28,260
Go!

206
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:29,860
Go now.

207
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:30,820
Go!

208
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:32,750
Go!

209
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:36,390
Take a seat.

210
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,950
Dad, you stay here and rest.

211
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,710
I'll also go look for him.

212
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:46,220
I'll help look for him too.

213
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:48,110
Okay, go ahead. Go.

214
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:05,900
Jiashu,

215
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:07,350
where did you go to university?

216
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:08,460
Where do you want to go in the future?

217
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,630
Then,

218
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:15,950
can I go to your university?

219
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:18,180
I've made up my mind.

220
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:19,350
I want to get into your uni

221
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:21,180
and visit you. Is that okay?

222
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:24,220
Sure.

223
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:36,750
Hao.

224
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:39,460
- Hao. - Hao.

225
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:41,390
Jiahao.

226
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:43,460
Let's check over there.

227
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:44,900
Hao.

228
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:47,500
Jiahao.

229
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:50,310
- Hao. - Jiahao.

230
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,950
Mr. and Mrs. He.

231
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:56,180
Ms. Qiu, any updates on Jiahao?

232
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,710
I asked around the class,

233
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:59,990
but nobody knew where Jiahao went.

234
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:00,710
After all,

235
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:03,180
he doesn't really hang out with anyone much

236
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:04,860
and doesn't have any close friends.

237
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:09,310
Actually, I think we could ask Jiashu.

238
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:11,580
Sure.

239
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:15,710
This is urgent.

240
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:16,860
Exactly, Hongguang.

241
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,670
If you're not going to call him, I will.

242
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:21,110
I'm part of the He family too.

243
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:22,030
Ms. Qiu,

244
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,780
could you please give me Jiashu's number?

245
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:29,580
Thanks.

246
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:43,860
[Auntie]

247
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:50,500
[Auntie]

248
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,140
Hello, Jiashu.

249
00:15:58,710 --> 00:15:59,500
Auntie.

250
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:03,140
- I just fell asleep. - Long.

251
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:04,220
- Coming. - Long.

252
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:07,180
Long, open the door.

253
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:09,860
Long, did Hao come by?

254
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,030
What happened to Hao?

255
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:13,860
Hao has gone missing.

256
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,030
- Hao! - Hao!

257
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:24,820
Hao!

258
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:26,390
Hao!

259
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:33,750
- Hao. - Hao.

260
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:35,460
Hao.

261
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:44,140
Hao.

262
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,900
Long, any updates?

263
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:48,540
No.

264
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,780
Jia... Jiashu.

265
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:58,350
Jiashu.

266
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:06,710
You...

267
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:27,710
Let's go.

268
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:51,820
Our priority is to find Hao. Let's go.

269
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:01,220
Sir, it's already past midnight.

270
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:03,860
It's too late, don't wait any longer.

271
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:05,670
Let me help you to your room to get some rest.

272
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:07,220
It's already so late,

273
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,860
yet Hongguang and the others still haven't found Hao?

274
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:09,750
Not yet.

275
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:12,220
This won't do. I'll go find him myself.

276
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:13,820
Please sit down.

277
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:14,750
Calm down.

278
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:17,180
I only have two grandsons.

279
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:19,500
One's gone, and now the other's missing.

280
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,780
How can I possibly sleep?

281
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:23,750
But getting anxious won't help either.

282
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:33,710
Long, you head that way. I'll go this way.

283
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,030
Jiahao!

284
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:39,580
Jiahao!

285
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:43,670
Jiahao!

286
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:49,950
Jiahao!

287
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,350
Jiahao!

288
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:57,780
Jiahao!

289
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:03,780
Jiahao!

290
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:05,350
Jiahao!

291
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,540
- Jiahao! - Hao!

292
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:15,310
- Jiahao! - Hao!

293
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:19,390
Jiahao!

294
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,070
Hao.

295
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:22,900
Jiahao.

296
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:24,750
Hao.

297
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:25,580
Hao.

298
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:32,140
These are...?

299
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:35,310
Are these all made by Hao?

300
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:37,220
Yes.

301
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:39,110
This is the place where Hao hid from his dad

302
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:40,350
to make the lanterns.

303
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,540
Hao is so talented.

304
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:46,950
These lanterns are truly exquisite.

305
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:49,350
There are so many lanterns.

306
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:52,140
It looks like he's serious about this.

307
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:54,350
That's just how this kid is.

308
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,260
He doesn't say much,

309
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,310
but he's very stubborn.

310
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:01,070
Once he decides on something,

311
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:03,310
it's hard for him to give up.

312
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:15,460
He said

313
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:18,990
making lanterns makes him happy.

314
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:27,220
Don't worry, we'll find him.

315
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:32,110
Let's go.

316
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,220
We should search elsewhere.

317
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:42,860
[Xiqiao Arcade]

318
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:43,660
Hongguang.

319
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:45,860
What's the update?

320
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,260
Did you find him?

321
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,620
No.

322
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:50,150
Where could he possibly go?

323
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:54,540
Let's check over there.

324
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:23,790
I failed again.

325
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:25,830
Why is this level so hard?

326
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:29,710
Do you like playing games?

327
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:36,750
How long are you planning to stay here?

328
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:37,830
I had to be cheeky

329
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:39,430
to borrow this arcade from my big brother.

330
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:41,220
I didn't do it so you could run away from home.

331
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:45,750
You haven't gone back either.

332
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:47,070
Are you also planning

333
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:47,940
to run away from home?

334
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:50,750
I often stay up late playing games here.

335
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,260
Whether I go back or not doesn't matter,

336
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:53,750
as long as they have my brother.

337
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:55,710
But you are different.

338
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:58,510
They're probably freaking out looking for you.

339
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:00,150
You are the only heir of the He family.

340
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:01,860
Your parents must be worried sick now that you are missing.

341
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:11,580
Fine.

342
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,710
You can stay as long as you want here.

343
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:19,220
Thanks.

344
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:21,860
No need for thanks between us.

345
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:24,710
Would you like to play a few rounds?

346
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,470
I'm good. I don't know how to play it.

347
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:30,030
Come on, I'll teach you.

348
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:37,830
First, this.

349
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:40,260
Then what?

350
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:42,620
Choose this character

351
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:43,830
and press this button.

352
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,110
Press it again.

353
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,110
You smashed it so hard.

354
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:01,030
Will this machine still work tomorrow?

355
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:04,900
It's not like I'm actually telling you to fight.

356
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:08,860
Sorry, I didn't control the force properly.

357
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,300
Never mind.

358
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:13,030
You've been letting off steam for a while.

359
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:14,900
Have you figured things out?

360
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:19,110
I...

361
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:21,070
I still can't figure out

362
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:23,300
why the He family

363
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:25,770
ended up like this.

364
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,970
It used to be so wonderful.

365
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:30,970
When I was little,

366
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:33,980
we always went for dim sum together.

367
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:37,340
I still remember the time

368
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:40,340
our family won the dragon boat race trophy

369
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:42,420
for the village.

370
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:47,380
But to me,

371
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:49,660
none of that glory

372
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:52,460
mattered as much

373
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:54,930
as having the whole family together.

374
00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:58,060
I just want to help the He family move past this.

375
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:01,060
I know my grandpa and aunt want the same thing.

376
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:03,720
But my dad

377
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,570
has never been the same since that incident,

378
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,160
and everything has changed because of it.

379
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:14,160
Maybe your dad

380
00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:16,340
has his own emotional baggage he can't let go of.

381
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:18,480
You just need to give him some time.

382
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,170
Who knows? He might come to terms with it soon.

383
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:23,400
Really?

384
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:24,570
Of course.

385
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:27,220
As a family,

386
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,240
there's nothing you can't get through together.

387
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:32,370
Sometimes, those who care about you the most

388
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:34,960
are the ones quietly supporting you where you can't see.

389
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:46,360
That said,

390
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,260
I'm not sure

391
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:49,260
if there's anything I can do to help you.

392
00:24:58,850 --> 00:24:59,440
I'm not sure.

393
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:05,050
But I'll keep trying.

394
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:07,930
I just

395
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:09,810
don't want to give up.
