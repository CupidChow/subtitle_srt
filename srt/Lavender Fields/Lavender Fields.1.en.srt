[LILY] Hey!

550
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:15,947
Seriously?

551
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:18,783
Why are you gossiping about our friend?

552
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:20,034
Could you please not?

553
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:23,496
Oh, Lance. Tyrone's been wanting
to end his marriage with Iris.

554
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:25,414
He wants an annulment.

555

Dad.

556

I don't know how to fix
our relationship anymore.

What kind of answer is that?

I've been trying for two years.

Find a way.

563
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:11,294
Because whenever my daughter gets hurt,

564
00:36:11,752 --> 00:36:13,254
I feel it threefold.

565
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:16,424
And I don't like that.

Besides…

567

You don't want to see me angry.
