1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:08,010

2
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:39,390
  Awaken

3
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:54,490
  Episode 10

4
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:06,420
  Kim Hae Suk, 103 years old/Female

5
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:12,500
  Yu Kwon, 92 years old/Male

6
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:36,540
Another failure.

7
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:48,410
Is it a failure again?

8
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:52,310
How can we apply this to humans at this rate?

9
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,860
How is the formula coming along?

10
00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:00,250
We are working on it.

11
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:27,440
We may need additional subjects.

12
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:54,510
  Adopted

13
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,620
  Please be quiet

14
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:13,090
He must have left the window open.

15
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:15,660
The Director, really...

16
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:46,090
Have you lost your mind? Running away on your own?

17
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:53,710
Now forget about that loser bastard, Moon Jae Wung.

18
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,150
You, you...

19
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:58,770
I made sure you only appear when somebody needs to be killed...

20
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:04,140
I will just kill them all. You don't need a frustrating bastard like  Moon Jae Wung anymore.

21
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:16,620
Do you remember when you said that Jae Wung seems to have made a friend?

22
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:21,920
Jamie Leighton. She was number 112 in White Night Village.

23
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,580
She left the village on the night of the disaster.

24
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:26,430
What did you say?

25
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,170
 Don't go!

26
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:38,410
 Don't leave me alone!

27
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:41,010
 Don't go!

28
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:54,690
  Serial killer Do Jeong Wu, nowhere to be found

29
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:57,300
And number 113, Do Jeong Wu.

30
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,700
Did he finally meet them?

31
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:03,950
The bad guys who left me behind.

32
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:07,520
Open it.

33
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,200
I got it.

34
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:20,460
Here you go.

35
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,290
We need to hurry.

36
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:31,460
I'm going to personally find the rest of the White Night Foundation guys.

37
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,410
And afterward...

38
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:40,220
  Serial killer Do Jeong Wu, nowhere to be found

39
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:46,760
  Awaken

40
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,150
Found it.

41
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:54,030
What?

42
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,180
A recognition device.

43
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:02,170
I thought there would be a common key shared by

44
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:04,420
all the victims who went into the counseling room in the Jangi-dong building,

45
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:07,490
Here, the smartwatch.

46
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:08,470
As if! There's no way we wouldn't know they all had the same watch!

47
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:10,540
How can we not know that they all had the same watch?

48
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:12,390
- It's not here. 
 - What?

49
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,900
- The watch isn't on the evidence list. 
 - It's not here.

50
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:19,790
It's not here, that's why you weren't aware.

51
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:23,120
Someone was afraid some evidence might come from the watch,

52
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,760
and might have hacked the internal police network to delete it.

53
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,770
That person won't have been able to steal it during the process.

54
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:30,400
So let's go to the evidence room first.

55
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,810
Why isn't he picking up?

56
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:39,610
Who?

57
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,900
Hyeon Su! You know that drug dealer.

58
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:45,190
It's time for him to get the drugs, but he is neither coming nor answering his phone.

59
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,900
He must've won the lottery.

60
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:50,260
That bastard's mouth seriously...

61
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,600
It's true. I gave him money.

62
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,100
I told him to stop selling drugs and study.

63
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:08,570
Why?

64
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:10,060
No, nothing.

65
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:13,320
This bastard should've come and said thank you profusely.

66
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,410
How can he just ignore you?

67
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:18,390
He doesn't have to thank me.  That's not mine but Son Min Ho's money.

68
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:20,080
Money collected doing bad deeds.

69
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,340
Does money have a name tag on it?

70
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:25,100
If you gave it to him, he should thank you.

71
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:26,660
What are you working on anyway?

72
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:31,690
This is the information I copied from a computer in the director's office at the Seoul Han River Welfare Agency yesterday.

73
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:36,100
It seems like he is continually moving the kids somewhere...Where could that be?

74
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:39,030
Wouldn't it be a secret laboratory?

75
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:43,920
To continue the experiment with the kids, they need a place.

76
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:47,060
So you did find it!

77
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,560
Shouldn't we be able to locate it if we secretly follow the kids?

78
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,500
If you follow them taking the kids somewhere, can't you find that secret laboratory?

79
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,480
If it were that easy, I wouldn't even be here.

80
00:08:54,480 --> 00:09:00,830
I doubt they are only supplying children from the Seoul Han River Welfare Agency.

81
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:09,440
  Awaken

82
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:32,290
Dad, what on earth was happening?

83
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:33,600
Nothing much.

84
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,880
I probably overworked myself a bit.

85
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,720
I was dizzy and went to the hospital.

86
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,660
Dad!

87
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,080
Let's talk about it later.

88
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,400
I'm a bit tired right now.

89
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:54,750
 Evidence Storeroom

90
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,800
Found it!

91
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,600
Well done!

92
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,760
Very nice! Good work!

93
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,220
Someone wasn't able to get rid of it, so they just gathered everything.

94
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,910
You did good work.

95
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:26,870
Let's  have a look.

96
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:33,460
What is this pattern?

97
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:41,580
Good question. All have the same pattern.

98
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:45,360
Except for Kim Yeong Jun's watch.

99
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:50,000
What could it mean? Maybe a group membership?

100
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,790
  Do you think the foundation will leave me alone if I tell you that?

101
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:56,350
Could it be the foundation Son Min Ho was referring to?

102
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:58,280
You might be correct.

103
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:01,290
They may have been trying to prevent their existence from becoming public

104
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:05,110
and deleted the watch from the evidence list.

105
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:07,510
Because they are scared of something...

106
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:15,250
  White Night Biotech Celebrates 20th Anniversary

107
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:19,120
Oh, this person seems like the director of Han River Hospital, Lee Byeong Seon.

108
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,950
You're right. What event was this?

109
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:24,090
Please wait for a moment.

110
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:28,320
White Night Baegya Biotech...
   White Night Baegya Biotech 20th Anniversary

111
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,770
It seems to be their 20th-anniversary event.

112
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:34,450
White Night...Baegya Biotech?

113
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:38,300
Can you see what kind of company that is?

114
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:44,420
The strange thing is... except for these pictures,

115
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:47,400
the rest of the information is either blocked or hidden.

116
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:51,690
What  research or production does this company do which is not revealed at all?

117
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:56,410
Usually, if you do research on a company, you find the purpose, chracteristics, goals,

118
00:11:56,410 --> 00:12:00,680
and you can easily find its focus and publications.

119
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:03,030
I don't know what kind of company it was,

120
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:06,260
but judging from this picture,

121
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:10,240
it seems to involve both  Son Min Ho and the deceased director Lee Byeong Seon.

122
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:13,690
But who's this guy?

123
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:14,660
- Who? 
 - This guy.

124
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:17,150
This person.

125
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:19,250
Who is he?

126
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,420
Ah! Right! He was at the party the day the first victim Baek Seung Jae died.

127
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:27,260
During the investigation, he claimed to be his close friend.

128
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:32,550
Also, he said he and Gong were talking about something... Ah, what was it?

129
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:38,290
Of course you don't know where the party organizer is do you?

130
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:40,320
Found him! Right there.

131
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,520
 Why is he swimming? He hates water so much, he doesn't even drink it.

132
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,660
- Is that so? 
 - Yes.

133
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,110
Yes.

134
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,740
This part here. Zoom in, please.

135
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:54,440
Oh? This!

136
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:58,960
Is it the same smartwatch?

137
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,240
Oh...you're right.

138
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:05,400
I thought this was just the entrance key to the counseling room in Jangi- dong building

139
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,290
but there could be a deeper meaning behind it.

140
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:11,750
I need to meet this person, Lee Tae Su.

141
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:18,020
Dr. Jamie, Deputy Commissioner General wants to see you.

142
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,070
Thank you for all your hard work so far.

143
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:27,920
Han Seon.

144
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,910
 Cashier's Check, 10 million KRW

145
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:36,920
The fact that my contract length was until the case of the forewarned murders was solved...

146
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,590
should be stated in the contract.

147
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:40,970
Staff Captain Do isn't caught yet.

148
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:42,750
Staff Captain Do...

149
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:45,710
Do Jeong Wu will be caught by the Korean police force.

150
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:50,030
Our superiors have ordered that from now on outsiders should be excluded from the investigation.

151
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:51,000
Please understand.

152
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,680
There are many inconveniences if there is someone from the outside.

153
00:13:54,680 --> 00:14:00,110
Especially if they are trying to close an investigation that isn't finished.

154
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:04,830
We will take care of the remaining tasks on our own.

155
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:08,480
Isn't it the American way not to interefere unless it's your business?

156
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,580
Thanks for your work all this time, Doctor Jamie.

157
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:17,110
Sorry, I don't think I can do that.

158
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:20,630
I am an American, and I always follow my contract.

159
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:24,130
That's American style.

160
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:28,080
When this case is over, I will leave without further ado.

161
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:30,150
Please take this back.

162
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,290
  We're getting closer to the core of this case.

163
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:53,900
  But someone is trying to send me away.

164
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,600
I can enjoy until the moment  I die, seriously.

165
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:59,870
Ah, CEO. How have you been?

166
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:02,950
Yes, director. It's been a while.

167
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:05,150
Have you been well?

168
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:23,120
Ah, right. Didn't you want to ask your father something?

169
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,800
No.

170
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,970
You definitely said something and stopped in the middle of it.

171
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:30,820
Ah...

172
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:33,390
I heard there was an issue at work.

173
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:36,830
Because I thought the team would be disbanded, I'm on standby for reassignment.

174
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:38,870
Think about what I said.

175
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:42,080
What is it? Why am I being left out?

176
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:47,540
It seems like you don't have to try so hard to be a policewoman.

177
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:53,120
You could study more. If there's something you want to do, I can help out.

178
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,290
But you should still work.

179
00:16:55,290 --> 00:17:00,830
But it is also true that I'm against your being a police officer because it is dangerous.

180
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:03,650
For once, there's no inconsistency between your dad and me.

181
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:07,630
A person must leave home with the rising sun and come back home with the setting sun.

182
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:09,730
Ah, right, what was I thinking?

183
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:11,610
I suddenly remember an appointment.

184
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:14,300
I'll get up first. Sorry.

185
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:20,370
What's wrong with her?

186
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,290
What on earth am I doing?

187
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:30,880
I seriously don't understand.

188
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:36,490
How can you stay sober? No change in expression whatsoever.

189
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:40,190
Because I don't drink, I'm sober.

190
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:57,030
Where is this punk, Do Jeong Wu? What is he up to?

191
00:19:57,030 --> 00:20:02,020
I told you before that I have two college going kids.

192
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:11,480
They were both on a road to success after getting affiliated with the right people.

193
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:19,790
What's up with the Blue House? What are the higher-ups guilty of doing that they keep pestering us? Why?

194
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:25,120
Because of that punk, Do Jeong Wu... because of that bastard!

195
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:34,480
Even if you're a bastard, it's better to be a complete bastard than a partial one.

196
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,830
What did you just say, punk?

197
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:42,220
Because you were determined to be greedy and act bad, you feel guilty,

198
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:45,770
but the world isn't that easy to live being nice all the time.

199
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:48,540
That's why being a partial bastard is hard.

200
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:54,370
I'm leaving now. Don't drink too much.

201
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:32,530
What are you doing? What's that?

202
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:35,050
Open it.

203
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:36,380
What are you up to?

204
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:39,020
Let's talk after you open it.

205
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,930
What money is this?

206
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:01,020
I'm making a deal.

207
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:03,830
I guess you forgot what a mess you're in.

208
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:06,500
A man on the wanted list wants to make a deal with the police?

209
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:12,010
Do you remember the serial bank robbery murder case where the truck flipped?

210
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:24,600
That's that money.

211
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:29,930
What? Are you the one who came up with the plan?!

212
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:31,450
 Then it's empty.

213
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:33,340
 We haven't caught the one who planned it.

214
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:36,050
 It's very hard to rob a bank with petty criminals.

215
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:37,860
 And he managed to do it 17 times.

216
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:41,030
 They emptied the storage, and a vast amount of money disappeared.

217
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:42,480
 What did they do with all that money?

218
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,990
No one knows how that money disappeared,

219
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:52,180
so I wanted to ask you to keep an eye on it.

220
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:58,090
It's dirty money that belongs to Son Min Ho, so you don't need to feel burdened. Also, you like money.

221
00:22:58,090 --> 00:23:02,000
Aren't you the person who acts only if the action is thoroughly beneficial to you?

222
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,330
- You're— 
 - A complete bastard.

223
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:20,880
But instead of going to President Hwang who adores you, why come to me?

224
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:35,960
 Nice to meet you.

225
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:39,000
 Have a drink.

226
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:59,300
 Director, you're asking me to withdraw every officer?

227
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:02,320
 Everyone come to the first floor.

228
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:29,950
Bastard. You should have been a complete bastard.

229
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:39,150
Why did you have to be a partial bastard, you bastard?

230
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:05,510
I've received a tip-off that kids are going missing from the welfare center registers.

231
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:09,250
Welfare centers?  Are you doing charity work now?

232
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:13,840
You don't need to know the details. Let's just say it's related to the White Night Village case.

233
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:16,820
Just deploy some officers

234
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:19,900
and keep your eye on what's going on.

235
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:23,690
When it's over, I'll pay you another good sum.

236
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,750
Why would you deploy officers to the welfare centers? Then, will they not take the kids away because of the officers?

237
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:42,630
Yes, probably.

238
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:47,550
There are more than 15 welfare centers affiliated with Hangang Hospital. How do we know when and where they'll take the kids?

239
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:51,380
That's why we're deploying officers.

240
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:55,080
So... what does that mean?

241
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:57,580
Except for one place.

242
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:01,790
They'll have to take the kids only from the place I've decided on.

243
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:02,520
Where?

244
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,890
Seoul Hangang Welfare Center.

245
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:33,110
Sir!

246
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:35,450
Oh, it's been so long!

247
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:37,910
I missed you.

248
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:44,140
Oh, you're finally here, sir!

249
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:47,200
Please be careful. Have you been well?

250
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,160
Are you better now?

251
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:52,100
Oh, I acknowledge it. I really do.

252
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:57,660
That lucid dream seems real, too, and mom's happy that I'm not causing trouble.

253
00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:03,340
Also... it's hormone, not drugs, so it doesn't show up on tests!

254
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:05,350
That's a relief.

255
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:10,830
But I'm a little disappointed.

256
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:14,970
I always wake up when I'm saying to myself, "just a little more, a little more, just a little more!"

257
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:20,820
So never mind psychotherapy or whatever. I need something more stimulating.

258
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:24,880
How much do you think this building's worth?

259
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,990
I guess he has a lot of money since his father is Director Lee Byeong Seon of Hangang Hospital.

260
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:29,660
He owns a building and has an office, too.

261
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:31,760
He's a CEO of an investment consulting firm.

262
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,530
I don't know what he does, though.

263
00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:36,670
He'd be a jobless bum if he does nothing, so I guess he probably did it to show off his business card.

264
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:40,190
When we meet Lee Tae Su, we'll find out about that watch.

265
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:43,840
Since Baek Seung Jae was also wearing it when he died.

266
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:52,390
Do you need something more stimulating?

267
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:54,250
Yes, that's right.

268
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:56,710
When the bastard Baek Seung Jae was alive,

269
00:27:56,710 --> 00:28:00,040
we met up to do some crazy stuff and had fun.

270
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:04,440
After he died, nothing is fun anymore.

271
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,180
There's no pleasure in life.

272
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:08,650
Even dreaming must not be fun anymore.

273
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:12,200
Dreaming is nice, but something stronger.

274
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:16,290
Isn't there something more real?

275
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:19,700
Then I won't want to ever wake up.

276
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:36,260
Try this.

277
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:41,410
The color's a little different than the one before.

278
00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:44,190
You said you never want to wake up.

279
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:50,070
It'll help you dream something more real than what you had before.

280
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,350
 You won't even know you're dreaming.

281
00:28:56,350 --> 00:29:00,050
 Since it'll be reality, not a dream.

282
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:04,210
You do know how to differentiate between a dream and reality, right?

283
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:05,830
Of course, I do!

284
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:08,720
If the day and night shown on this watch are different, it's a dream.

285
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,680
If I want to wake up from that dream, I just do what scares me the most.

286
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:15,890
Then have a nice dream.

287
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:23,710
 You won't need to wake up this time since you'll die before then.

288
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:33,450
But you don't have an appointment.

289
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:36,540
You can't go without a warrant even if you're the police.

290
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:42,320
We know Mr. Lee Tae Su is upstairs! Check and see!

291
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,220
So frustrating!

292
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:32,440
Falling from here will be faster than a sports car, right?

293
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,790
Bring a warrant!

294
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:13,200
Jamie Leighton, number 112, we'll meet soon.

295
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:24,810
- What? 
 - I knocked.

296
00:33:24,810 --> 00:33:27,200
Hyung.

297
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:31,250
What? You wouldn't even pick up when I called.

298
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:33,650
Please leave us alone.

299
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:37,950
Oh, okay. Have a nice conversation.

300
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:45,590
Why are you here all of a sudden and setting a mood?

301
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,590
Take a look at this.

302
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:12,190
 Seoul Hangang Welfare Center

303
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:43,140
It's been a long time.

304
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:47,470
After hearing about Director Lee Byeong Seon's illness on the news,

305
00:34:47,470 --> 00:34:50,130
I was already concerned, but now your son, too...

306
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:53,020
Let's not talk about that.

307
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:57,230
There are a lot of issues lately, so please act with caution.

308
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:59,970
I just came to tell you that.

309
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:19,370
Kyeong Min did?

310
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:21,300
Still?

311
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,230
Fine, bye.

312
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:27,270
I'm going straight home when I'm done.

313
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:28,900
Yes, sir.

314
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:48,870
Has the foundation ever been so incompetent?

315
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:55,120
The director, and now even my son... but you don't know the culprit?

316
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:58,520
Executive Director Park Gyu Tae, Director Baek Seung Jae, and Professor Choi Yong Seok,

317
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:01,970
and my husband were all board members of the foundation.

318
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:05,270
Now even my son...

319
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:11,450
And Professor Son Min Ho and Attorney Nam Wu Cheon...

320
00:37:11,450 --> 00:37:13,900
That means someone is out to harm the foundation!

321
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:16,630
What have you been doing about it exactly?!

322
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:21,960
Expressing anger like that  will only make matters more complicated.

323
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:26,770
If you can't be objective, maybe you should step away from the foundation.

324
00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:28,610
What did you say?

325
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:30,530
We started the foundation!

326
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:33,590
Not a weasel like you who became a board member

327
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:35,920
thanks to your father-in-law!

328
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:40,840
Then instead of getting agitated,

329
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:43,090
help the foundation in doing well.

330
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:51,690
Just prepare a smooth supply and demand for the kids' material.

331
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:07,490
 What was Staff Captain Do Jeong Wu curious about?

332
00:38:07,490 --> 00:38:11,390
 Who... told you that?

333
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:14,180
 Professor Son, I see.

334
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:31,230
It won't end like this, Do Jeong Wu.

335
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:35,280
 You're ready for discharge.

336
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:46,190
 The forewarned serial murders that caused a stir all over the country not long ago,

337
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:51,390
 Staff Captain Do Jeong Wu who was arrested as the culprit doesn't know when the cerebral artery dissection will happen—

338
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:54,200
Your picture is plastered on the news.

339
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:57,050
Should you be going around in broad daylight that way?

340
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:00,480
Don't get stabbed somewhere again and come bothering me.

341
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:02,730
What about the welfare center?

342
00:39:02,730 --> 00:39:05,610
I'm certain it's Seoul Hangang Welfare Center.

343
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:11,620
Director Lee Byeong Seon's wife showed up there. Guess who came out to meet her.

344
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:15,080
- Who? 
 - The Blue House Chief of Staff, Oh Jeong Hwan.

345
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:22,580
I guess something really is going on in that welfare center.

346
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:24,980
Right. Was it Lee Tae Su?

347
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:28,120
The guy who jumped off from the top of his building a few days ago.

348
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:31,380
I heard that's Director Lee Byeong Seon's son.

349
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:34,110
Have you found the 34-year-old man?

350
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:36,950
Again, talking only about things you want to!

351
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:42,100
With just the age and no last name or face, how am I supposed to find him?

352
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:43,680
You've asked me to do so many things for you!

353
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,880
All you do is order me around with that mouth of yours.

354
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:49,100
That mouth should be shut down for life.

355
00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:53,740
But exactly why are you looking for that 34-year-old man?

356
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:56,080
He's the culprit.

357
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,700
What do you mean?

358
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:59,590
The culprit who made Lee Tae Su jump.

359
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:00,820
What?

360
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:06,030
The lost property of White Night Village that started off the serial forwarned murders.

361
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:10,580
So the notebook that you thought was just a clue to the serial murder was

362
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:13,660
unlocked with your fingerprint,

363
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:16,740
and inside was the material related to the White Night Village?

364
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:21,900
Also, your father, Professor Go Il Do's records were found?

365
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:25,480
It seems like someone wanted me to see it.

366
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:28,460
That's probably why my fingerprint was made to be the key.

367
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:29,150
Do Jeong Wu.

368
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:31,240
It could be.

369
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:34,180
At first, when I thought Team Leader was the culprit,

370
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:39,140
I thought other victims were purely a way to get close to Son Min Ho.

371
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:42,010
But that could not be the case.

372
00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:43,450
I'm not sure,

373
00:40:43,450 --> 00:40:48,520
but the victims of the forewarned murders might be related to White Night Village, too.

374
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:55,840
Have you seen this? 
  Lee Tae Su, Lee Byeong Seon's son commits suicide

375
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:58,980
Oh, I saw him at the party where Baek Seong Jae died.

376
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:00,310
He died, too?

377
00:41:00,310 --> 00:41:04,280
Yeah. This time, there was no forewarning or a final video,

378
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:07,990
but I'm certain the murders are happening in the same way.

379
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:09,460
If we're to believe Dr. Jamie,

380
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:14,830
the other person who survived White Night Village other than her and Do Jeong Wu is the prime suspect.

381
00:41:14,830 --> 00:41:18,670
What is the connection between the victims?

382
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:21,750
We have to find out.

383
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:43,880
Oh, don't come close.

384
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:46,250
Don't come close! Don't come!

385
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:50,120
Don't come! Don't come! Don't come close!

386
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:52,310
Don't come close!

387
00:41:55,350 --> 00:41:58,040
You can't even look after one kid?

388
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:17,100
What are you scared of?

389
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:18,910
Dad. Dad, please help me.

390
00:42:18,910 --> 00:42:21,850
Of course, I will.

391
00:42:23,310 --> 00:42:27,880
Since you're my son, I'll resolve it for you. Don't worry.

392
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:32,950
I keep seeing that bastard! I keep seeing him!

393
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:42,390
Here. Around the time Lee Tae Su died,

394
00:43:42,390 --> 00:43:46,200
some suspicious people visited his office.

395
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:47,930
Suspicious people?

396
00:43:47,930 --> 00:43:49,630
Come and see.

397
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:03,120
But there's only one CCTV in the hallway,

398
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:05,870
so we can't see them closely. The direction isn't good either.

399
00:44:05,870 --> 00:44:08,900
Why are there so many suspicious things going on?

400
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:36,840
 How did I not know?

401
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:47,870
 Since I first met him, he felt familiar.

402
00:44:52,310 --> 00:44:55,650
 Weren't you trying to get this?

403
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:05,730
 I had a strange feeling here.

404
00:45:05,730 --> 00:45:09,630
 We met too many times to call it coincidence.

405
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:22,410
 Excuse me, are you okay?

406
00:45:22,410 --> 00:45:25,760
 Someone who took an interest in me like it was natural.

407
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:28,970
 You were there when the fire happened, right?

408
00:45:28,970 --> 00:45:35,240
 I... think I can help you.

409
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:39,620
 Height, 166 cm, weight, 51 kg.

410
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:44,400
 A perfectly... unfamiliar person...

411
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:51,960
 Now that I think about it, Do Jeong Wu asked me to track down one woman and a man.

412
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,870
 The woman is Dr. Jamie,

413
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:58,700
 but I don't know who the man is other than he's 34-years-old.

414
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:04,800
 Staff Captain Do Jeong Wu was looking for the culprit of the forewarned murders from the very beginning.

415
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:06,830
  The third child was...

416
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:10,810
was already there.

417
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:29,600
I have to go to the White Night Village.

418
00:47:39,970 --> 00:47:42,170
What am I doing here for days?

419
00:47:42,170 --> 00:47:45,630
Dad only goes from lab to home and back.

420
00:47:56,950 --> 00:48:00,320
That's not the bus going home.

421
00:48:24,090 --> 00:48:26,920
 The place where I am...

422
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:35,960
 Where is the person?

423
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:40,450
 I want to play, too!

424
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:42,700
 Okay, try and write it down here.

425
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:44,870
 - Here? 
 - Yeah.

426
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:46,700
 Hyung 113!

427
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:48,700
 Let's go.

428
00:49:42,170 --> 00:49:45,190
Be careful.

429
00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:47,520
Seo Wu, get in!

430
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:48,880
I don't want to.

431
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:51,090
Why not?

432
00:49:51,090 --> 00:49:52,240
Let's go.

433
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:54,320
Come on, Seo Wu.

434
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:55,580
I don't want to.

435
00:49:55,580 --> 00:49:57,620
Good job!

436
00:49:57,620 --> 00:49:59,930
Se Bin, have fun!

437
00:49:59,930 --> 00:50:02,050
Bye, Seo Wu!

438
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:08,560
 Do you know where the secret lab is located?

439
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:09,950
 I don't know that either.

440
00:51:09,950 --> 00:51:12,990
 Since I have no reason to go there.

441
00:51:57,260 --> 00:51:59,110
Why did he get out here?

442
00:51:59,110 --> 00:52:03,270
This isn't the way home. It's in the opposite direction.

443
00:54:41,510 --> 00:54:45,820
Am I finally seeing the end of this?

444
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:46,040
The first shot is a warning.

445
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:48,210
You know what comes next, right?

446
00:57:15,110 --> 00:57:17,000
The first shot is a warning.

447
00:57:19,630 --> 00:57:22,390
After that, I can't promise anything.

448
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:40,750

449
00:58:19,950 --> 00:58:22,690
 Awaken

450
00:58:22,690 --> 00:58:23,860
 Take me with you.

451
00:58:23,860 --> 00:58:27,970
 A mouse that went missing 28 years ago, not realizing his place...

452
00:58:27,970 --> 00:58:32,290
 It's unfair. Shouldn't living and dying be fair?

453
00:58:32,290 --> 00:58:34,660
 I can't help sacrificing for the sake of research.

454
00:58:34,660 --> 00:58:35,940
 Dad!

455
00:58:35,940 --> 00:58:37,190
 Throw it!

456
00:58:37,190 --> 00:58:38,460
 Use Jamie.

457
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:39,940
 She'll be Do Jeong Wu's weakness.

458
00:58:39,940 --> 00:58:41,690
 Do Jeong Wu, I have to catch him.

459
00:58:41,690 --> 00:58:43,370
 Everything starts there.

460
00:58:43,370 --> 00:58:47,840
 How long do you think you can stay blind and ignore everything for?

461
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:50,750
 Someone has to stop him.
