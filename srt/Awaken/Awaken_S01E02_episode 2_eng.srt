00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:07,990

2
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:39,340
 Awaken

3
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:48,190
Come out!

4
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:56,180
Today, today is the most fun ever.

5
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:01,940
- Thank you.
 - That guy is crazy.

6
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,150
 KORail

7
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:12,810
- This is my style! 
 - Get out of the way!

8
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:18,070
- Come out, I said.
 - Now, everything will disappear.

9
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:24,080
- Out of the way!
 - Team Leader!

10
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:45,020
 Stop

11
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,600
 Stop

12
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:49,390
 There are times like this. Nothing really happened

13
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:52,660
 and you don't know anything, but you feel apprehensive.

14
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:58,350
 Awaken

15
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:02,790
 Episode 2

16
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:05,790
So I had a thought, it was like a fantasy.

17
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:10,670
A person who had done something bad commits suicide because he feels guilty.  Like Choi Yong Seok this time.

18
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:14,410
At that level it is more like a fairy tale, not just a fantasy.

19
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:16,370
Ah. Isn't it?

20
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:18,680
Although that might be true for others,

21
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:23,960
but Choi Yong Seok raped women in the middle of the day. It doesn't make sense for him to suddenly feel guilt.

22
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:28,060
I meant that the suicide felt like a fairy tale, not the guilt.

23
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:33,540
Are you alright? You don't seem very hurt, how regrettable.

24
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:36,300
This guy, really.

25
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:40,840
We are working. You are unlawfully interfering with a public official in the exercise of his duty.

26
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:44,620
Oh, gosh. Aigoo.

27
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:49,470
I wish you'd make such claims after doing your job properly,

28
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:52,090
Staff Captain Do Jeong Wu.

29
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:57,790
- This guy...
 - Don't waste your energy on useless things.

30
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:01,270
He purposely bumped into you. Why is it useless?

31
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:04,630
Lee Ji Wuk is out to mess with cops and I am a cop.

32
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:07,330
But he also messes with prosecutors.

33
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:12,390
If I punch people in the head as they pass by, and punch you in the head, too, wouldn't you be angry?

34
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:16,180
People say, if someone hates you for no reason, they create a good reason.

35
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:20,270
So I'm going to give him a really good reason soon.

36
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:37,960
I had a feeling when Baek Seung Jae died, but it was further confirmed when Choi Yong Seok died.

37
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:43,030
There is something strange. Although it's hard to describe specifically,

38
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:45,620
but there's something like a sense of incompatibility.

39
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:48,210
Yes, those people are lacking something everyone must have.

40
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:50,870
Something everyone must have?

41
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:54,310
Could you hold this for a bit?

42
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:04,160
My hair!

43
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,680
- My hair! Hair! Hair!
 - Do you want to die?

44
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,630
I must have held on because I didn't want to die. I thought all my hair was going to pulled out.

45
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:17,620
Oh... anyway, this is what I mean.

46
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:21,490
The people who died in our cases do not have this kind of reaction.

47
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:23,840
So it must be suicide. They must have wanted to die.

48
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:28,070
My hands grabbed instinctively. Before I had a chance to think, my body had already moved.

49
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:32,570
This is instinct. Perhaps I should say reflex?

50
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:35,830
Oh, my head hurts.

51
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:44,310
People cannot completely control their own bodies.

52
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:49,240
Even someone who tried to drown himself, once he can't breathe anymore, he's bound to struggle.

53
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:55,840
But a guy who drowned in a shallow pool committed suicide?

54
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:01,110
That means you could stick your nose in a bowl of water and drown yourself.

55
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:04,700
- Can't you die that way? 
  - No, you can't. Try it.

56
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:14,300
So what about running into an oncoming train?

57
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:23,030
I'm not more dangerous than a train.

58
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:26,710
But even you closed your eyes. So why didn't Choi Yong Seok close his eyes?

59
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:30,980
Y-y-es, that's right.

60
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,140
I already looked in there.

61
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:40,850
I'm just confirming it again, to be thorough.

62
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:55,450
Maybe he was on drugs?

63
00:06:55,450 --> 00:07:02,610
No. For someone to run into an oncoming train like this, he would have had to pour Mescaline into his system. But there was none.

64
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:05,880
The drug you brought isn't even a sedative. It's a sleep inducer.

65
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:10,910
You can buy it without a prescription, and its effect is not strong.

66
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:16,020
These days, rather than police video cameras, regular people's cell phones are more scary.

67
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:21,470
Wow, isn't that amazing? If I didn't perform the autopsy on him, I would think that he was 100% hallucinating.

68
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:23,320
- You're sure that it wasn't drugs?
 - Yes.

69
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:26,680
Look at his face, it looks sober. You said you were there when it happened.

70
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:32,020
People who are hallucinating, you can tell even with your eyes closed.

71
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:37,130
It's even truer of addicts. Their pupils look completely different.

72
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:43,110
Their emotional ups and downs are severe. They have depression, anxiety, and they are easily distracted

73
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:47,080
and over-sensitive. You can't miss them.

74
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:51,590
 I will remember you forever!

75
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:53,950
That will be 1,100 won. ($1)

76
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:03,580
What's with him? So many psychos around here.

77
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:06,760
A professor of a national university

78
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:12,700
tried to rape a woman in broad daylight, then was chased by police and died after being hit by a train.

79
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,390
But you are telling me that this is murder?

80
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,940
Looks like the criminal is the police, then.

81
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:21,580
Lee Ji Wuk is the only one claiming that this is murder.

82
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:26,140
But people are dying according to a forewarning notice. So it's neither a suicide nor an accident, is it?

83
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:31,220
But is it a real forewarning? Why is this crazy guy using a code, anyway?

84
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:34,360
Well, it wasn't that difficult to crack.

85
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:37,790
He used the "Celestial Stems" and "Earthly Branches" system for the date, and the binary numeral system for the time.

86
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:41,850
And the location was provided by the area code.

87
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:43,860
This is already too difficult.

88
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:46,400
- Be quiet.
 - Okay.

89
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,600
 Analysis of the Forewarning Notice

90
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:54,290
The "Celestial Stems" and "Earthly Branches" systems of ordinals originated in China. It is most often used by fortune readers.

91
00:08:54,290 --> 00:09:00,060
There are 10 Celestial Stems, with Five Elements: wood, fire, earth, metal and water.

92
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:03,820
They are also divided into five colors, blue, red, yellow, white and black.

93
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:09,140
The "Earthly Stems" can also be expressed by the 12 animals in the zodiac.

94
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:14,320
Dates can be expressed by pairing up the "Celestial Stems" and "Earthly Branches."

95
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:20,290
For example, a child born on September 4, 2020

96
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:24,050
The year of Gyeong-Ja, month of Eul-Yu, date of Il-Saeng.

97
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:29,610
So the child was born on the year of the the white rat, the month of the blue chicken, and the day of the white dog.

98
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:34,010
So when it said the blue chicken climbs above the red sheep—

99
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:36,810
Blue chicken is September and the red sheep is the 1st.

100
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:40,340
 2020 (year of the white rat); September (month of the blue chicken); 1 (red sheep day)

101
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:42,010
"When the blue chicken climbs above the red sheep
 0 the sex-crazed man in the street will encounter what he cannot overcome in the street."

102
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:46,450
The next part is easier. When you substitute these jewel symbols with 0s and 1s—

103
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:50,230
How can you do that? They all look the same.

104
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:52,010
They're different.

105
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:05,340
Wow, indeed. How did our Team Leader solve this?

106
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:08,050
He's definitely not normal either.

107
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:13,290
Daebak. You are really crazy. How can you tell those apart?

108
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:17,920
It's the binary numeral system. No numbers begin with a zero so 1 has to be the first number.

109
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:22,400
The binary numeral system only uses 0s and 1s.

110
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:29,060
A binary numeral system converter program is easy to find so if we substitute the numbers,

111
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:33,820
1530. So we know it's 3:30 p.m.

112
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:42,050
Lastly, we should pay attention to how the message begins with "0."

113
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:46,930
In a digital world like today, it's strange that they cut out each letter by hand, one by one. And the spacing between the letters are incorrect.

114
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:51,030
But if you count the spaces and the syllables carefully,

115
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:57,380
02458

116
00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:04,000
02 is the area code for Seoul, and 458 is the prefix for Jangeui-dong.

117
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,300
- So we cracked the code.
 - Well, I cracked the code.

118
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:13,720
Right. You cracked the code, which means that the police cracked the code.

119
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:18,010
Wow, we are good, huh? Alert the public relations officer.

120
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:21,600
Tell him that the police cracked the code and can block the next incident.

121
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,730
But how did the informant in the Baek Seung Jae case know it was at the hotel?

122
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:31,320
We cracked the code, but all we can know is the region.

123
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:37,880
Just because we cracked the code, it doesn't mean we caught the criminal.

124
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,780
So we should let this case remain internally among the police for now.

125
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:44,290
Why can't we catch the criminal? We have all this information.

126
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:48,610
Whoever the criminal is, it doesn't look like he was at the scenes of the crimes.

127
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:52,700
And since the public focus is on the fact that these are forewarned murders

128
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:57,040
it would be best to prevent any commonalities among the victims becoming known.

129
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:01,430
If the public becomes paranoid that the police have been providing cover to the wealthy—

130
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:03,140
Hold on.

131
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:12,110
Yes? What? Hey, turn on the TV.

132
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,610
- Which channel number? 
 - How would I know which number?

133
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:19,220
Channel XVN.

134
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:21,180
 The fourth victim of the forewarned numbers

135
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:25,620
 was a college professor who was teaching students.

136
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:28,930
 Who would do this, and why

137
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:31,760
 would someone commit such crimes?

138
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,810
 We reporters wanted to know.

139
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:38,770
 And we discovered a surprising fact.

140
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:42,360
 Murder is a crime that should not be condoned.

141
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,830
 But what if the subject of the murder was not human?

142
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:49,310
 What if the thing that died was an animal?

143
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,730
 He suddenly attacked me.

144
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:55,240
 He was completely unreasonable. What did he say?

145
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:59,140
 That he was going out of his mind. He was terribly agitated.

146
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:01,070
 It was really horrible.

147
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:06,750
 It turned out that Choi Yong Seok was reported many times for suspicion of rape and sexual assault.

148
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:09,820
 And last year, one of his pupils who reported him

149
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:13,730
 was accused of being a 'gold digger,' and committed suicide.

150
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:16,960
 And that's not all, recently in his office at the university,

151
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,480
 another falling death occurred and the reason is unknown.

152
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:25,600
 So Choi Yong Seok was worse than an animal to his pupils.

153
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,850
 So what about the other victims?

154
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:33,800
 Is the common element between them really just the forewarning notices?

155
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,570
 We will continue our close coverage of this case.

156
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:41,620
 Taking one step closer to current events, this has been Lee Ji Wuk of "Current Events Zoom-In."

157
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:58,770
Reporter Lee Ji Wuk already warned everyone several times.

158
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:02,650
Is it correct that there are more victims because the police failed to act?

159
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:05,840
We've heard that the victims are criminals who were not indicted by the police.

160
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:08,150
Can you provide us an explanation regarding that?

161
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:11,600
We will do whatever we can to collaborate with the public

162
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,210
and solve this case without delay following a thorough investigation.

163
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:18,990
In addition, actions that create community panic by spreading groundless rumors,

164
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:22,580
I ardently request that you refrain from such actions.

165
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,390
It won't go that far, Attorney.

166
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:57,280
 Will you take responsibility?

167
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:00,270
 - If this becomes such a hot issue that the foundation is harmed—  
 - I will take responsibility.

168
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:01,400
Will that be enough?

169
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,370
If no one talks about these incidents and

170
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:06,210
 the foundation in the same breath, just like you did now,

171
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:07,980
then no one would make that connection.

172
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,730
Please!

173
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:14,630
Just remove the internet search term and make it "blind."

174
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:17,630
If I do that, than anyone would think that is strange.

175
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:20,110
  If the information they were just looking at disappears

176
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:23,620
 then they will fixate on that information.

177
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:28,230
And the current internet communities that are active are all being managed by us.

178
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:32,360
It's important for them to think that what they see is all there is.

179
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,550
I'll remove just enough search terms to not attract notice

180
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:39,320
and once they fade from current consciousness, I will make them unsearchable.

181
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:43,700
"Blind." Without doing something so obvious,

182
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:46,860
making them turn their gaze to something else is a piece of cake.

183
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:49,920
You know that we will do a good job.

184
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,410
I'll be hanging up now.

185
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:58,990
Now that it's crashing into him, he's scared.

186
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:03,100
Yes, this should be all it takes for this story to disappear.
  10 People Arrested for Drug Smuggling

187
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:06,390
So they can watch what is fun.

188
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:12,260
What they see decides what facts are.

189
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:17,540
So all we have to do is to decide what to show them.

190
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:56,060
So was it suicide?

191
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:01,130
Of course, I'm curious.

192
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:03,440
My husband was someone who would never commit suicide

193
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,790
as long as there were women in this world he could sleep with.

194
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:10,810
What? I don't seem like the typical widow?

195
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:17,160
But this much mourning is actually overdoing it.

196
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:21,060
He had the character of a piece of dog trash

197
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:23,300
but he was very good at hiding it.

198
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:26,530
I heard that he was trying to rape a woman in the street.

199
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:30,580
More importantly, he ran towards an oncoming train?

200
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:34,660
He hated to even cross streets saying it was dangerous, so that's unexpected.

201
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:37,200
There were no drugs detected in his system.

202
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,510
Oh, did I ever say he took any drugs?

203
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:44,570
Aside from his perversions, he had no other problems at all.

204
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:47,800
He did receive psychological counseling, but I didn't hear much of it after that—

205
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,790
Psychological counseling? That was not in his medical records.

206
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:54,830
Of course not. It could cause problems for his job as a university professor.

207
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:58,790
Perhaps his therapist was pretty? He was quite excited and happy.

208
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:05,420
Yes, hello.

209
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:15,470
Hyeong, will this really be alright?

210
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:19,400
I saw the materials you sent me. They scared me so much.

211
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,590
Never mind Park Gyu Tae of Manhae Construction.

212
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:25,380
But you know who Kim Yeong Jun's father is, don't you? He's the CEO of DS Law Firm.

213
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:27,360
Ah, really.

214
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,770
Is it okay for us to mess with this case?

215
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:32,310
And Choi Yeong Seok's wife's brother is a strong candidate for president, the Mayor of Seoul.

216
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:36,290
But he died, so who cares about his brother-in-law? What are our viewer ratings?

217
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:37,860
I wrote my Last Will and Testament.

218
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:42,110
If our ratings exceed 20%, then I will just die right then, of a heart attack.

219
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:45,020
- We even have ads scheduled for our reruns.
 - What about the internet search terms?

220
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:48,980
We were dominating, but it looks like someone is messing with it.

221
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:53,430
So we just have to recover the momentum. Let's do this.

222
00:18:56,670 --> 00:19:00,330
I'm not particularly interested in making sure the criminal is caught and punished.

223
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:04,270
But I must know what exactly happened.

224
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:07,160
Is it so important for you to know whether it was suicide or homicide?

225
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:12,100
It's not as if your husband will come back to life if you know that.

226
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:18,110
Let's just say that I can't endure not knowing what I am curious about.

227
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:21,410
Of course, if you were an ordinary wife,

228
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:25,810
rather than the fact that your husband died, whether it was suicide or homicide

229
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:27,920
would be much more important.

230
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,800
- Yes?
 - Where are you?

231
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,710
It's total chaos.

232
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:14,330
- FBI is coming?
 - FBI is coming?

233
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:17,060
To be more specific, he worked in the FBI.

234
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:22,470
He is currently a criminal psychology consultant for various countries.

235
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:23,900
Is that all?

236
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:27,290
I thought Lee Ji Wuk broke a really big story or something.

237
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:30,960
- Lee Ji Wuk did break a big story.
  - While we are learning about Professor Choi Yong Seok's sex crimes

238
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,640
 we have also begun to learn about the crimes of the other victims.

239
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:36,200
Aish, it's all because of that guy.

240
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,670
He keeps stirring things up, so the higher-ups won't trust us, so they hire the FBI or whatever.

241
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:42,060
Whoever he is, if he comes quickly and solves this case, who cares?

242
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:43,180
Don't you have any pride?

243
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:45,040
We were solving this case. We're going to solve it.

244
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:50,090
Hey, what Team Leader is saying is that whether the FBI comes, or the CIA comes,

245
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:53,440
we will solve this case quickly, so there won't be any problems.

246
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,610
No.

247
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:59,840
Aish... I can't clean up after a Yankee. I won't.

248
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,630
Right. He will be a foreigner.

249
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:04,760
Aish, what are we going to do now?

250
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,240
I've always disliked people with big noses.

251
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:11,260
Why? A man must have a big nose in order to—

252
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:13,750
What are you doing? Go see what's happening.

253
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:17,950
Don't touch me.

254
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:19,530
Look here.

255
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,520
- Are you all right? 
 - How dare you touch a random woman?

256
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,690
Actually, I'm the one who touched him.

257
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:34,720
And he was the one who shouted to not touch him. But rather than touch—

258
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:26,290
 I am alone in a street with no one around.

259
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:28,550
 The sun is shining whitely

260
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:33,190
 The clock which is never wrong indicates it is midnight.

261
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:35,100
 I wonder now

262
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,710
 whether it is daytime

263
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:39,740
 or night?

264
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,570
Hey! Hey!

265
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:08,370
Excuse me, can I see your ID?

266
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:11,540
I'm sorry, I don't speak Korean, I'm an American.

267
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:12,840
English?

268
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:16,950
I think you understood me. Can I see your passport?

269
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:21,180
Okay.

270
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:24,420
Please let me speak to the U.S. Embassy.

271
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:27,560
I'm a U.S. Citizen.

272
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:33,350
So you arrived in Korea on August 20th?

273
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:35,630
What do you do? What business do you have here?

274
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:38,360
Could you please call the U.S. Embassy now?

275
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:41,280
You are involved in a crime in Korea so you need

276
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:44,810
to go through our investigation before you talk to anyone else.

277
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:50,720
Well, as I said, I'm not saying a word until I talk to someone from the Embassy.

278
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:55,800
You can talk to me now or I can have you arrested and we can go down to the station.

279
00:23:55,800 --> 00:24:02,250
Then you'd be wrongfully detaining a U.S. Citizen which is in fact illegal, is it not?

280
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:06,050
Are you in charge here?

281
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:08,920
What did she say?

282
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:12,320
In Korea, this is what a real cop looks like.

283
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,990
We dress this way in Korea.

284
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:22,820
She used to work here.

285
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,520
Go Ji Yeong (17)

286
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,890
Looks like she's dead.

287
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:35,680
Anyway, I was just trying to stop him from stealing this picture.

288
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,090
I didn't mean to touch him, okay?

289
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:38,010
So it was sexual harassment.

290
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:40,090
I sexually—

291
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:47,190
You touched someone and it was unwelcome, so of course that is sexual harassment.

292
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:49,660
For sexual harassment, we require testimony from the victim.

293
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:52,970
So if that victim who ran away reports that you sexually harassed him, then we will summon you

294
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:59,140
so make an appearance with your representative at the U.S. Embassy.

295
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:01,330
You speak Korean well.

296
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:51,780
Where did he go?

297
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:19,380
 Innocence LP

298
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:22,990
 Sunjeong LP

299
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:24,650
Hello.

300
00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:59,670
I was counting down the hours wondering when someone would beat you up.

301
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:02,090
So that day was today.

302
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:05,460
But seeing you, they weren't all that scary.

303
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:07,910
No, they were super scary.

304
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:10,490
They didn't pull one of your eyeballs out.

305
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,600
And they did not remove any internal organs.

306
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,990
So they're softies, obviously.

307
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:20,500
Actually, they said they would pull out one of my eyeballs next time.

308
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:23,330
Give me the drugs.

309
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:26,360
The ones who say they will pull your eyeball out are not scary.

310
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:30,480
The ones who would really do it do not give you any warning—

311
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,830
This bastard, why is 50,000 won ($50) missing?

312
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:38,680
Oh right. I took a bill before to buy some antiseptic.

313
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:45,070
Hurry and give it to me.

314
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:48,010
Stop acting so cheap.

315
00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:51,000
People who reach your age should train the upcoming generation.

316
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,660
Stop talking nonsense.

317
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:57,210
I raised a child before, so I know. "One should not take in other people's children (because they will betray you.)"

318
00:27:57,210 --> 00:28:01,900
Yes, I Baek Hyeon Su, a cold man of the city without enemies.

319
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:05,660
If it's to my advantage, I will use anyone.

320
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:10,630
You're talking sh*t.

321
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:13,160
So it's true that you had a child?

322
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:17,060
I heard that you had a son you kept hidden. So that's true? What did he do? What does he do now?

323
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:21,270
What do you mean? If he's a decent human being, he would be working at this hour.

324
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:38,990
Why walk around holding a toothbrush in your mouth? That is dangerous.

325
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:44,090
Who knew something like this could be so lethal?

326
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:47,670
Shall I show you how lethal I can be?

327
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:50,470
Why do you keep sleeping in the holding cell, anyway?

328
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:51,770
How did you know about that?

329
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:55,690
Is there any policeman in Seoul who doesn't know that you sleep in the holding cell instead of at home?

330
00:28:55,690 --> 00:28:58,630
The other officers are in an uproar, because you are inconveniencing them.

331
00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:01,590
And the inmates find it even more uncomfortable.

332
00:29:08,770 --> 00:29:11,160
Are you alright?

333
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:14,510
Your sense of balance is great. That makes you even more annoying.

334
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:20,430
Look at you, you look like a beggar. You are damaging the dignity of the police force.

335
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:23,520
Why do you walk around like this, huh?

336
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:27,170
And look at that, what is that?

337
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:32,000
Even if someone told me to buy someone weird like you, I could never find anyone else.

338
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:35,310
You are aware that it's chaos outside, don't you?

339
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:37,700
I don't use the internet or watch TV, so I don't really know.

340
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:41,250
You should watch them. It's a mess out there.

341
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:44,890
Please save me already. I have two kids who aren't in college yet.

342
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:47,810
I'm afraid to turn my cell phone on.

343
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:51,970
I heard about that Ph.D. or something, from the FBI.

344
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:53,660
It's fine. I'll work with him.

345
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:57,440
It's fine... ? You really do not understand what is going on.

346
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:02,180
Hey, the higher-ups cannot trust you, so they  hired someone external.

347
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:04,460
Is it important if you are fine with it or not?

348
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:06,020
But it is strange.

349
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:10,920
We've had such weird cases in the past, but this never happened before, right?

350
00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:17,990
You take that without water? What kind of medication is that, anyway?

351
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:21,410
Stop taking drugs. It will decrease your immunity—

352
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:23,530
Take the next one.

353
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:33,610
Wait, are they trying to wrap this case up quickly

354
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:36,590
because some powerful people don't want this case to become known?

355
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:39,730
Reporter Lee Ji Wuk seems to be thinking that.

356
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:45,050
But after all, we are the police. We won't bow down to power that easily.

357
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:48,230
The spot below your eyes is trembling.

358
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:50,360
Why make that facial expression?

359
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:53,070
As if Lee Ji Wuk is correct or something? Hmm?

360
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,490
Anyway, he is a skilled professional.

361
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:01,160
Whatever the higher-ups say, to catch the criminal quickly

362
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:04,290
and closing this case is your job.

363
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:16,450
Be strong.

364
00:31:21,770 --> 00:31:23,770
He's a licensed lawyer.

365
00:31:23,770 --> 00:31:27,430
And he was the team leader of behavioral analysis in the FBI, with a Ph.D. in psychology.

366
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:29,790
If he can't speak Korean, I will not stand for it.

367
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:33,060
How old is he that he's a lawyer and a doctor of psychology,

368
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:36,430
and even a team leader of behavioral analysis at the FBI? Hey.

369
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:37,570
Do you think he's older than 50 years old?

370
00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:41,630
You know, he's a profiler or whatever, and he's going to make us work so hard?

371
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:44,120
If he can't run 100 meters in 13 seconds, I won't stand for it.

372
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:47,120
If he's American, he won't understand Korean social hierarchy, right?

373
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:50,100
What if he acts up, thinking he is above our Team Leader?

374
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:54,720
If he doesn't bow 90 degrees every time he sees Team Leader, I won't stand for it.

375
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,520
Yes?

376
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,620
What brings you here? Huh?

377
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:06,300
Yesterday... no one made a report about that, so we won't need your testimony.

378
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,860
 Is that guy crazy?

379
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:10,950
 No!

380
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:12,120
 Actually, I'm the one who touched him.

381
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:16,470
 And he was the one who shouted to not touch him. But rather than touch—

382
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:39,600
Hello. I'm Jamie Leighton, I will begin working here starting today.

383
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,420
I came from the Criminal Psychology Lab.

384
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:44,840
I was a member of the FBI.

385
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:50,020
I do speak Korean well and I can run 100 meters within 13 seconds.

386
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:24,220
Sorry, I was enjoying the breeze.

387
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:28,330
You are so careful.

388
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:34,550
Next time I visit you, Reporter Lee Ji Wuk, I will wrap everything up and not even breathe.

389
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:37,530
- But never mind that. How did you know?
 - Know what?

390
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:41,830
Choi Yong Seok. It would be strange if you knew that he would cause that crazy mess.

391
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:44,310
But if you didn't, you would not have told me to chase him around.

392
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:46,470
You're beating around the bush.

393
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:52,950
So you knew that he would die?

394
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:55,280
Perhaps.

395
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:57,450
Aigoo, so scary.

396
00:33:57,450 --> 00:34:00,280
You will be struck by lightning. ( Divine punishment)

397
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:03,790
- That makes you laugh?
 - If I get hit with a lightning bolt of money, I would welcome it.

398
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:07,190
- What is this?
 - That building I told you about.

399
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:11,240
I examined the CCTV video nearby and quite famous people go in and out of that building.

400
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:13,690
So who knows what else we will find?

401
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:17,930
Park Gyu Tae.

402
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:21,010
Baek Seung Jae.

403
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:24,040
Choi Yong Seok.

404
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,370
But no Kim Yeong Jun?

405
00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:27,280
The video of him was probably deleted because it was too old.

406
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,240
There is a significant time interval.

407
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:43,680
On April 19th, XVN reporter Lee Ji Wuk receives a video of the incident site.

408
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:47,900
That was the Kim Yeong Jun incident which happened on February 27th.

409
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:50,610
That was thought to be a simple case of suicide.

410
00:34:50,610 --> 00:34:54,640
And some time had passed since the previous incident, so no one paid any attention at the time.

411
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:57,210
But then, a forewarning notice arrives.

412
00:34:57,210 --> 00:35:00,200
Park Gyu Tae's death. June 30th.

413
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:05,440
He received a video from the incident site and Reporter Lee tried to make a big issue out of it.

414
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:08,110
But everyone accused him of being an attention-seeker.

415
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:11,510
Anyone could see that both cases were suicides,

416
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:13,980
so forewarning notices or videos of the sites, it seemed all made up—

417
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:15,750
Was that the official position of the police?

418
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:18,360
You must not know this, but Lee Ji Wuk is definitely an attention-seeker.

419
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:21,230
So the reporter's broadcast about the incidents

420
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:24,520
were interpreted by the police only as attempts to seek attention.

421
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,590
The police first intervened on August 18th.

422
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:32,800
It was after receiving a tip from an informant that Bae Seung Jae's hotel was where the third incident will occur.

423
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:37,200
Someone cracked the code and informed the police.

424
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,220
 - Is that guy crazy?
 - No!

425
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:51,430
The death happened right in front of the police, but they failed to prevent it.

426
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:55,190
After this incident, the police officially began investigating this case.

427
00:35:55,190 --> 00:36:00,360
Then they cracked the code of the next forewarning notice and went to the site of the next incident based on their conjecture.

428
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:02,690
That is where they met Choi Yong Seok.

429
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:07,560
I've got a question. Why were you in Jangeui-dong at that time?

430
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:12,990
Right. The convenience store was not the first time we met her. She was at the train tracks.

431
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,890
Since you brought that up, let's hear your response to my question from back then.

432
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:21,880
Did you really enter Korea on August 20th?

433
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:24,770
Why did you come?

434
00:36:24,770 --> 00:36:28,250
You should trust the immigration officials of your country.

435
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:34,750
Of course I entered Korea on August 20th due to a request from the Korean police agency regarding these cases.

436
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:40,080
And I went to Jangeui-dong because I cracked the code of the forewarning notice.

437
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:42,200
It wasn't such a hard code to crack, after all.

438
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,140
That is true.

439
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:45,670
Like I said.

440
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:47,670
You're smart.

441
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:55,330
Your hands are pretty, too.

442
00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:07,480
You know, when people get to know each other, they compliment each other and gauge reactions and such.

443
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,760
Yes, that's right.

444
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:21,790
That piggy on that band-aid is very pretty.

445
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:23,390
But it's a rabbit.

446
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:26,010
Yes, it's a rabbit, but compliment accepted.

447
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:30,570
It seems you have a precise grasp of our case, so from today on, let's move together.

448
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:33,140
You guys look into the victims of Park Gyu Tae and Baek Seung Jae.

449
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:34,770
- The two of you?
 - Yes.

450
00:37:34,770 --> 00:37:38,980
This foreigner... I mean, this American, we must take care of her.

451
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:41,220
You two have to move together so you can take care of her?

452
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:43,670
Is there a problem with that?

453
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:45,450
Well, I'm worrying about you, Doctor.

454
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:47,200
Me?

455
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:50,900
But why... ?

456
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:59,910
Then I'll go out with Jang Ji Wan. Let's go.

457
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:01,690
Huh?

458
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:11,560
Wow, she said she won't stand for it if I didn't bow down 90 degrees to greet you.

459
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:14,420
But she didn't properly greet me.

460
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:19,600
I heard that Koreans are very territorial. But I guess that isn't true.

461
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:22,450
Only just our team, actually.

462
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:25,210
I have a very 'free' style, you see.

463
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:28,850
Wow, you really are 'free.'

464
00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:33,150
Are you really tasking me to drive, when I'm no different than a foreigner?

465
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:35,840
I told you, it's my style to be free.

466
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:38,890
That's fine, free Staff Captain Do.

467
00:38:38,890 --> 00:38:40,280
So where are we going now?

468
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:44,740
Try to guess.

469
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:48,550
Fine.

470
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:52,480
Seeing the address, it looks like the victim of Kim Yeong Jun.

471
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:57,250
But I do not believe that these killings are related to the crimes committed by the victims.

472
00:38:57,270 --> 00:39:04,030
But despite that, it is the fate of the Korean police. We cannot avoid procedure.

473
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:06,230
And the Kim Yeong Jun case is a bit strange.

474
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:08,830
What is strange?

475
00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:11,650
- It doesn't make sense.
 - So what doesn't make sense?

476
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:16,130
- Floccinaucinihilipilification.
 - What?

477
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:18,510
I mean that it doesn't make sense, just like what I just said.

478
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:20,320
I said that it doesn't make sense because it does not.

479
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:23,790
But if you ask me how it doesn't make sense, how am I supposed to respond?

480
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:26,050
Floccinaucinihilipilification.

481
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:30,860
The action or habit of estimating something as worthless. And by doing so,

482
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:35,010
it renders a thing worthless. It's an English word with that definition.

483
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:40,140
To say that something doesn't make sense, that means you discovered some sort of rule, but the thing violates that rule.

484
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:44,970
So what I am asking you is what rule did you discover, Staff Captain Do?

485
00:39:44,970 --> 00:39:46,490
And how did the Kim Yeong Jun incident violates that rule?

486
00:39:46,490 --> 00:39:50,230
- Right turn, you have to make a right turn.
 - Now turn right?

487
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:56,930
 You have gone off course. I will recalculate your course.

488
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,590
I guess not.

489
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:19,610
Should I look for it, me who is just like a foreigner?

490
00:40:19,610 --> 00:40:22,430
How strange. But this is the right place.

491
00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:24,650
You said it would be faster to come this way.

492
00:40:24,650 --> 00:40:28,710
We should just follow what the navigation is telling us.

493
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:12,630
- Ah!
 - What? Why do you say, "Ah?"

494
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:16,380
Ah, this isn't the right place. We have to go that way.

495
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:19,890
- What?
 - I thought it looked very unfamiliar.

496
00:41:19,890 --> 00:41:22,150
Let's follow the navigation.

497
00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:34,680
- Where do we go now?
 - Let's move according to the plan.

498
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:42,750
Yes, Doctor?

499
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:45,390
How did you know it was me?

500
00:41:45,390 --> 00:41:49,350
I thought you'd realize about now what catastrophe you've gotten yourself into.

501
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:53,340
I'm sorry, I misunderstood.

502
00:41:53,910 --> 00:41:59,080
It seems we will only have enough time to deal with the victim of Kim Yeong Jun.

503
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:02,340
I am  very  sorry.

504
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:08,930
Get in the car.

505
00:42:08,930 --> 00:42:11,180
Yeah, this isn't the right place.

506
00:42:17,570 --> 00:42:20,960
What kind of nuisance is this? They must have had plans, too.

507
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,670
What are you saying?

508
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:27,290
Lieutenant Gong was already determined to check even Choi Yong Seok's victims.

509
00:42:28,110 --> 00:42:30,830
Not Lieutenant Jang Ji Wan?

510
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:32,760
No, just Lieutenant Gong.

511
00:42:38,650 --> 00:42:41,520
How do you know what will happen, like this?

512
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:45,920
Why do you still assume that Team Leader will take care of these things?

513
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:49,250
- Special hire. 
 - I told you that I am not.

514
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:53,020
He asked me to come, telling me that I needed consultation on sexual relations.

515
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:55,000
Do you remember when that was?

516
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:59,010
It was late at night, after classes were over.

517
00:42:59,010 --> 00:43:03,850
Get out! How dare you come here?

518
00:43:03,850 --> 00:43:06,520
Oh, so unlucky!

519
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:12,180
My husband Park Gyu Tae beat me so severely

520
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:17,030
that I was laid up in the hospital. And then he died like that.

521
00:43:25,370 --> 00:43:30,150
How can you be so bad at finding your way?

522
00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:36,080
Are you doing this on purpose to torture me or something?

523
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:50,160
Did you see the security video of Park Gyu Tae around the time of Baek Seung Jae's incident?

524
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:53,440
Yes, I did.

525
00:43:54,650 --> 00:43:58,060
And Lieutenant Yoon is looking at the other videos.

526
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:02,380
And there is no CCTV video of Kim Yeong Jun.

527
00:44:13,210 --> 00:44:15,340
I saw them, too.

528
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:19,530
And, floccinaucinihilipilification.

529
00:44:19,530 --> 00:44:21,760
- That's what I found.
 - Oh.

530
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,240
So what is it?

531
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:27,670
All the victims have committed anti-social crimes in the past.

532
00:44:27,670 --> 00:44:30,830
And they were not able to feel guilt regarding their immoral conduct.

533
00:44:30,830 --> 00:44:34,770
- And all of them, right before their deaths— 
 - They were sleeping, right?

534
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:39,180
We don't have CCTV of Kim Yeong Jun, but we have testimony from an eye witness.

535
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:42,490
That he was sleeping, then suddenly woke up and jumped off the building.

536
00:44:42,490 --> 00:44:45,320
And Park Gyu Tae, there's a high possibility that he was sleeping based on the time.

537
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:48,610
And Baek Seung Jae, when I saw him briefly,

538
00:44:48,610 --> 00:44:53,630
he seemed like he had just taken sedatives or was very drunk, whatever made him sleepy.

539
00:44:53,630 --> 00:44:57,140
And Choi Yong Seok had just completed sleep treatment and was coming out of the therapist's office

540
00:44:57,140 --> 00:45:00,640
so it's like he just woke up, too.

541
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:06,720
But let me ask you something that I'm curious about.

542
00:45:08,890 --> 00:45:11,450
What is your real reason for coming to Korea?

543
00:45:11,450 --> 00:45:16,660
You were very successful in the U.S. Former FBI and the head of a criminal psychology lab.

544
00:45:16,660 --> 00:45:20,520
And once people start dying in the U.S., they die by the dozens, I hear.

545
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:25,860
So why come to such a small country to focus on such a small case?

546
00:45:27,490 --> 00:45:31,710
You and I have seen each other before.

547
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:41,180
I'm prone to misunderstandings. So you're not confessing your affection for me, are you?

548
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:46,430
That you feel like you've seen me before, so you are drawn to me? That's not it, is it?

549
00:45:47,450 --> 00:45:50,380
But we have seen each other before. That convenience store.

550
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:53,320
- When you were almost arrested for sexual harassment— 
 - Not that.

551
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:57,280
And not by the train tracks.

552
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:03,590
But didn't you say you were in the U.S. all this time? So how could we have seen each other?

553
00:46:03,590 --> 00:46:09,050
Then why are you acting like you're trying feel out someone you know— ?

554
00:46:09,050 --> 00:46:11,110
What are you doing?

555
00:46:12,390 --> 00:46:14,660
So when

556
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:19,060
and where could we have seen each other?

557
00:46:19,060 --> 00:46:23,970
If you need time to think about it, then how about thinking about it after stepping back?

558
00:46:23,970 --> 00:46:30,040
This feels very dangerous and menacing right now.

559
00:46:39,050 --> 00:46:42,070
Such a good vocabulary for a U.S. citizen.

560
00:46:45,270 --> 00:46:48,880
Found the house.

561
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:05,970
This is all I have.

562
00:47:05,970 --> 00:47:08,690
Yes, it's alright.

563
00:47:50,830 --> 00:47:55,260
You didn't know that the deceased part-time worker at the convenience store was Kim Yeong Jun's victim?

564
00:47:55,260 --> 00:47:59,260
If you're trying to pick on me for not having reviewed the case file properly

565
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:03,860
I admit that I didn't review the information about the victims.

566
00:48:03,860 --> 00:48:07,550
Because from the beginning, I did not think this was about revenge.

567
00:48:07,550 --> 00:48:13,190
These cases are due to a very specific goal.

568
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:15,420
What goal would that be?

569
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:17,120
That ...

570
00:48:18,810 --> 00:48:20,190
I don't know yet.

571
00:48:20,190 --> 00:48:22,220
You're not so great.

572
00:48:23,950 --> 00:48:24,890
What did you say?

573
00:48:24,890 --> 00:48:27,610
Am I some kind of mind reader?

574
00:48:27,610 --> 00:48:29,810
Am I supposed to know everything after just one look?

575
00:48:29,810 --> 00:48:31,910
After I have more time and more information—

576
00:48:31,910 --> 00:48:37,280
So if you had more time and more information, then will you know when and where we've met before?

577
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:41,220
See? You really aren't so great.

578
00:48:43,870 --> 00:48:48,640
Oh, there is something I found from the security videos of the deaths of Park Gyu Tae and Baek Seung Jae.

579
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:53,510
I didn't see it before, but after watching them repeatedly, I found a common element.

580
00:49:05,990 --> 00:49:10,530
And since I saw Choi Yong Seok's death firsthand, there's no need to say more.

581
00:49:15,690 --> 00:49:17,730
What is this?

582
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:22,530
All three

583
00:49:23,450 --> 00:49:25,650
were smiling.

584
00:49:25,650 --> 00:49:28,080
Very happily.

585
00:49:42,570 --> 00:49:44,230
 That building I told you about.

586
00:49:44,230 --> 00:49:48,670
 I examined the CCTV video nearby and quite famous people go in and out of that building.

587
00:49:48,670 --> 00:49:51,180
 So who knows what else we will find?

588
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:13,430
 It's at the very end of the third floor. The door is locked.

589
00:51:14,170 --> 00:51:16,340
The last room on the third floor.

590
00:52:07,390 --> 00:52:09,530
What is this?

591
00:52:20,620 --> 00:52:23,560
 Additional Materials

592
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:34,110
 Additional Materials

593
00:52:49,910 --> 00:52:52,420
 Team Leader Do Jeong Wu

594
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:54,160
I'm almost done organizing the file.

595
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:56,100
So those victims are not connected to our case, is it?

596
00:52:56,100 --> 00:52:57,970
No, it doesn't appear to be revenge.

597
00:52:57,970 --> 00:53:01,640
But after examining the victims of the murder victims, I almost want to give a prize to the guy who killed them.

598
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:05,260
Be careful what you say. Anyway, I'll let her know that they are not related.

599
00:53:05,260 --> 00:53:07,000
Hello—

600
00:53:09,090 --> 00:53:11,190
He doesn't care as long as they are not related to our case?

601
00:53:11,190 --> 00:53:13,450
Maybe he's a psychopath?

602
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:39,780
Oh, you startled me. You're here?

603
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:41,450
I told you to clean up around here.

604
00:53:41,450 --> 00:53:45,190
I am your PD, not your servant, Hyeong.

605
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:49,370
But I cleaned. I cleaned for you because I know you suffer from mysophobia,

606
00:53:49,370 --> 00:53:51,610
so I cleaned.
  (mysophobia - extreme or irrational fear of dirt or contamination)

607
00:53:51,610 --> 00:53:52,890
Sit down.

608
00:53:52,890 --> 00:53:54,320
Shut everything down. I have to look for something.

609
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:57,850
Sit down, I'm looking into the son of an Assemblyman doing drugs—

610
00:53:57,850 --> 00:53:59,520
Put that in.

611
00:54:03,460 --> 00:54:05,160
What are you looking for?

612
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:06,230
I don't know.

613
00:54:06,230 --> 00:54:08,690
If you don't know, who will?

614
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:13,930
PD No. Not the guy who sent those forewarning notices,

615
00:54:13,930 --> 00:54:17,600
but someone else cracked the code and gave me a tip.

616
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:20,890
That he will tell me the next victim, so I should alert the police.

617
00:54:20,890 --> 00:54:23,570
And that victim was Choi Yong Seok.

618
00:54:23,570 --> 00:54:25,020
Choi Yong Seok?

619
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:26,460
So do you know what I did?

620
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:29,620
I didn't report it to the police, I had him followed.

621
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:32,600
But Hyeong, that means you could have saved his life.

622
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:35,150
Why would I save that piece of trash?

623
00:54:36,510 --> 00:54:38,550
Just look at the video.

624
00:54:38,550 --> 00:54:42,770
We've got a week. If we find something in this,

625
00:54:42,770 --> 00:54:44,750
it will be an exclusive scoop.

626
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:10,590
Dad, why are you home at this hour?

627
00:55:10,590 --> 00:55:13,140
- What a good husband you are.
 - Of course.

628
00:55:13,140 --> 00:55:15,770
I might barely see his face once every ten days.

629
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:18,220
No one has a husband like this, do they?

630
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:22,050
It tastes good.

631
00:55:22,050 --> 00:55:24,330
Hye Won, why are you home at this hour?

632
00:55:24,330 --> 00:55:28,400
You should quit your job, and pick out a good husband among Dad's employees

633
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:31,370
and raise a cute bunny-like baby and live a sweet life.

634
00:55:31,370 --> 00:55:35,320
What will you do? Will you let her continue to live such a rough life?

635
00:55:37,940 --> 00:55:39,320
Oh, really.

636
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:41,520
I cannot understand you people with the surname Gong.

637
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:44,630
You people are really strange.

638
00:55:44,630 --> 00:55:47,140
Oh, look at you two. Hey,

639
00:55:47,140 --> 00:55:50,830
do that with your boyfriend, not my husband.

640
00:55:50,830 --> 00:55:54,540
Oh right, you said your Team Leader was really smart

641
00:55:54,540 --> 00:55:58,640
and worthy of respect and handsome, didn't you?

642
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:01,590
I think you also said he had a nice voice?

643
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:05,300
Mom, what are you saying? He's not really that great.

644
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:08,750
There's something weird about him. He's not great at all.

645
00:56:08,750 --> 00:56:11,020
I'll be going in now.

646
00:56:11,020 --> 00:56:15,780
You used to talk about his intense gaze and that you found it distracting.

647
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:17,280
If that's not that great,

648
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:21,400
you were never that great to me, Honey.

649
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:24,610
You were always the best for me, all of my life.

650
00:56:24,610 --> 00:56:26,460
You are always all talk.

651
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:29,980
How can a father and daughter both be such workaholics?

652
00:56:29,980 --> 00:56:32,780
Only after our home's happiness is destroyed,

653
00:56:32,780 --> 00:56:37,610
you'll finally say, "Ah, no place like home." Wow, it turns out that home is my home.

654
00:56:37,610 --> 00:56:38,890
I love you.

655
00:56:38,890 --> 00:56:42,240
Both of you, you're only great at talking.

656
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:44,620
No one can out-talk you.

657
00:57:48,110 --> 00:57:49,920
 You're not so great.

658
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:55,210
 So if you had more time and more information, then will you know when and where we've met before?

659
00:57:56,430 --> 00:58:01,380
So he means that we have met before.

660
00:58:03,950 --> 00:58:09,080
But I'm sure this is the first time I saw him.

661
00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:20,620
 I am alone in a street with no one around.

662
00:58:20,620 --> 00:58:22,960
 The sun is shining whitely

663
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:28,400
 The clock which is never wrong indicates it is midnight.

664
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:30,220
 So I become curious.

665
00:58:30,220 --> 00:58:34,930
 Is this daytime or night?

666
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:54,030
 And Choi Yong Seok had just completed sleep treatment and was coming out of the therapist's office

667
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:57,800
 so it's like he just woke up, too.

668
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:35,760
 They were sleeping, right?

669
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:39,890
 For Kim Yeong Jun, we have testimony from an eye witness. That he was sleeping, then suddenly woke up and jumped off the building.

670
00:59:39,890 --> 00:59:42,820
 And Park Gyu Tae, there's a high possibility that he was sleeping based on the time.

671
00:59:42,820 --> 00:59:47,740
 And Baek Seung Jae, he seemed like he had just taken sedatives or was very drunk, whatever made him sleepy.

672
00:59:47,740 --> 00:59:52,010
 And Choi Yong Seok had just completed sleep treatment and was coming out of the therapist's office

673
00:59:52,010 --> 00:59:55,260
 so it's like he just woke up, too.

674
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:16,850
 Incident Report

675
01:00:16,850 --> 01:00:19,490
 Additional Materials

676
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:31,540
 Forewarned murder

677
01:00:31,540 --> 01:00:35,010
 4th Forewarned Murder! A death after collision with a train in Jangeui-dong.

678
01:00:39,070 --> 01:00:41,940
 Shock after it was revealed 4th victim of forewarned murder was a professor who was a sexual predator

679
01:00:47,710 --> 01:00:50,190
How did he know?

680
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:11,050
 We have testimony from his wife that he received counselling, but it was not confirmed.

681
01:01:33,180 --> 01:01:35,430
Stay still.

682
01:01:36,740 --> 01:01:38,820
My arm hurts.

683
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:53,670
MODU

684
01:01:53,670 --> 01:01:57,090
 It didn't look like any psychologist's office would be around there.

685
01:01:57,090 --> 01:01:59,760
 Then how... ?

686
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:04,210
 And Choi Yong Seok had just completed sleep treatment and was coming out of the therapist's office

687
01:02:04,210 --> 01:02:07,090
 so it's like he just woke up, too.

688
01:02:07,090 --> 01:02:12,900
How did he know that that guy came out just after completing sleep treatment?

689
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:56,210
Hold on!

690
01:02:56,210 --> 01:02:58,160
Hold on. Just right now, over there.

691
01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:00,230
Someone passed by at that window, right?

692
01:03:00,230 --> 01:03:01,580
Which window?

693
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:04,400
- Third floor. 
 - Third floor?

694
01:03:05,100 --> 01:03:07,830
- Have you gone senile?
 - Hurry and look.

695
01:03:07,830 --> 01:03:10,130
Nothing passed by. What are you talking about?

696
01:03:10,130 --> 01:03:12,530
Wait, someone did pass by. They did.

697
01:03:12,530 --> 01:03:16,150
- Here.
 - Can you make that clearer?

698
01:03:16,150 --> 01:03:18,100
Hold on.

699
01:03:19,390 --> 01:03:20,220
 Baek Seung Jae/ Choi Yong Seok

700
01:03:20,220 --> 01:03:26,810
The only person who can be certain that Choi Yong Seok had just received sleep treatment,

701
01:03:30,250 --> 01:03:36,520
based on the current situation, he can only be the criminal...

702
01:03:37,620 --> 01:03:39,400
I got it.

703
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:46,320
Was that what you were looking for?

704
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:50,870
No. It's more than that.

705
01:03:52,840 --> 01:03:55,320
We caught the criminal.

706
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:30,290
 And a foreboding premonition is never wrong.

707
01:05:03,570 --> 01:05:10,510

708
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:20,570
 Awaken Preview

709
01:05:20,570 --> 01:05:22,570
 How accurate is this information?

710
01:05:22,570 --> 01:05:24,130
 Lee Ji Wuk did get this right.

711
01:05:24,130 --> 01:05:26,090
 Well, he found it correctly.

712
01:05:26,090 --> 01:05:28,600
 Using the police to catch the police.

713
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:30,550
 Are you suspecting the Team Leader?

714
01:05:30,550 --> 01:05:33,540
 You don't seem to be in danger to me, Staff Captain Do.

715
01:05:33,540 --> 01:05:34,580
 You look dangerous, actually.

716
01:05:34,580 --> 01:05:36,280
 Hurry and come back to me.

717
01:05:40,550 --> 01:05:44,720
 What are you hiding? So you knew something, didn't you, Staff Captain Jo?

718
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:48,600
 Looks like I'm the criminal, then.
