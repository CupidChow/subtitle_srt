1
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:12,030

2
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:38,170
 Awaken

3
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:52,030
 Two Years ago 
  Episode 3

4
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:07,860
 You're in violation of the signal—

5
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:16,300
 A female police officer is obviously physically deficient when it comes to dealing with violent crimes, so they are best suited for the department of human resources—

6
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,260
 Lieutenant Gong Hye Won.

7
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:21,730
 You can run 100 meters in 12.3 seconds, and 1,000 meters

8
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:25,840
 in 229 seconds. You can do 62 sit-ups and 63 push-ups per minute.

9
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,660
 Your left-right grip made an impression as if it were 62 degrees. For men, the best they can do is 61 degrees.

10
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:32,640
 I don't think you either lack physical strength or you particularly like this assignment

11
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,540
 that is best suited for female officers.

12
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:44,380
 Hurry up and join me quickly. If you keep wasting your time in giving out tickets, I'll go bust.

13
00:01:55,870 --> 00:02:00,280
 I liked him from the start.

14
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:04,460
 Based on a special request by Captain Do Jeong Wu. Finally,

15
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:08,020
 Gong Hye Won, Jang Ji Wan, Yoon Seok Pil,

16
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:12,870
 I've decided to assign all three of you to the Special Case Handling Unit.

17
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:15,920
 - Any questions? 
 - No, sir!

18
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:21,470
 Come to the Special Case Handling Unit office on December 10 after a week's vacation.

19
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:26,620
 - That's all for now. 
 - Attention! Salute! Loyalty!

20
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,360
 Loyalty.

21
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:44,400
 What in the world... So they formed a team then?

22
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,530
 That's right. Staff Captain Do is the illegitimate son of the Agency Director, so he got special permission.

23
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:50,780
 He gets special treatment because he's the illegitimate son?

24
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:53,340
 I heard that the director got caught doing something corrupt.

25
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:57,550
 Something was found during an investigation, but he concealed it...

26
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:20,490
 Since we're talking about it, I think our team leader

27
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:23,720
 becoming an officer right when he passed the bar exam is really cool.

28
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,940
 It's a secret, but he is my role model.

29
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,390
  Was that a secret? Then how did I know about that?

30
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:31,400
  He gets happy even when he sees Captain Do outside, standing 1 km away.

31
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,990
 - It's obvious? 
 - Totally obvious.

32
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:44,070
 I get it. He's smart and good at his job.

33
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:47,390
 I think there are reasons to respect him.

34
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:53,880
  In this crappy Korean society, even being sure of what you want to do is admirable enough—

35
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,730
  Aigoo, is that all?

36
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:59,260
 He's handsome, skillful and is a gentleman. Just the type that women like—

37
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:00,990
 Who are you?

38
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:04,880
 Isn't he a homeless person?

39
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,590
 - Lieutenant Yoon. 
 - Yes?

40
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:09,350
 Yes, I'm Staff Captain Do.

41
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:12,370
 - Loyalty! I'm Lieutenant Yoon Seok Pil. 
 - Good.  Okay.

42
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:17,630
 - Nice to meet you. 
 - I'm Lieutenant Yoon Seok Pil.

43
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:23,130
 So we start today, right? Alright, take good care of me.

44
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:28,500
 Nice to meet you all. Aigoo, how nice, now we're a team, huh?

45
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:32,960
 No matter what, I just couldn't dislike him.

46
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,860
 Awaken

47
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:41,500
 The Present.

48
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:46,790
 Episode 3

49
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:58,120
- Lieutenant Gong.
 - Yes?

50
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:01,380
You said Choi Yong Seok received therapy, right?

51
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:05,520
- Are there any records of him receiving therapy on the day of his death? 
 - I don't think so.

52
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:11,540
His wife only knows that he received counseling, but she doesn't know where, when and what kind of therapy.

53
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:17,010
Then how did he know?

54
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:21,560
 Choi Yong Seok had just completed sleep therapy and was coming out

55
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,720
 so it's like he just woke up, too.

56
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,520
Maybe it's a side effect of his treatment?

57
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:30,230
Baek Seung Jae was being treated for alcoholism and although we haven't confirmed Park Gyu Tae and Kim Yeong Jun—

58
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:34,310
For Kim Yeong Jun, if they kept the crime he committed concealed because he was a minor,

59
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:36,870
there is a high possibility that he received psychological treatment.

60
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:40,670
All those guys were smiling like fools, as if they were hypnotized. You all saw it.

61
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:43,140
Can psychological counseling do that to people?

62
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:46,850
Doesn't it make more sense that drugs made them go temporarily insane?

63
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:50,760
- But no drugs were detected in their bodies.
 - Maybe they developed something new. Hey, Gong.

64
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:55,020
- Doesn't today's technology make that possible?
 - Of course. In dramas.

65
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,920
My vote is hypnosis. That makes the most sense.

66
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:00,360
But that is also only true in dramas.

67
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,880
Realistically, there is a problem of time and space.

68
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:08,360
To make someone go crazy enough to attempt suicide, you will need more than the usual time for them to be socially isolated.

69
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,390
So if these people weren't locked up somewhere

70
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:14,150
- or abducted, then set free— 
 - Exactly.

71
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:17,460
High school student, executive of a large company,

72
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,470
a celebrity CEO, a college professor.

73
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:24,010
They had respectable lives, but they were suddenly made to commit suicide?

74
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:28,370
That is not easy. People have self-preservation instincts.

75
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:33,990
This. The people who died in our cases did not have this kind of reaction.

76
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:38,240
But what if they did not realize that their actions were hurting them?

77
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,700
Let's focus on their actions.

78
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:52,940
Kim Yeong Jun, all he did was jump.

79
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:56,990
But anyone who graduated from kindergarten would know that if you jumped from that height, you will die.

80
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:59,280
All Park Gyu Tae did was to go into a dog cage.

81
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:04,520
But why would a seasoned hunter not know that it's dangerous to enter a cage full of hunting dogs that tasted blood before?

82
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,360
All Baek Seung Jae did was to swim.

83
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,740
But until he died?

84
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:12,100
All Choi Yong Seok did was to release "jang pung" (wind) from his palms.
 (T/N: martial arts technique)

85
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,010
Maybe they all thought they could do what they did?

86
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:16,340
And maybe that's why their self-preservation instinct didn't appear?

87
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:18,850
But how can they think that?

88
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:22,770
What are the people who enjoy extreme sports like?

89
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:25,580
They even jump off a cliff that's over 100 feet high.

90
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:30,010
Or they rely on a single oxygen tank to go deep into the ocean.

91
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:31,680
What makes that possible...

92
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,700
... is repetitive practice.

93
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:38,810
They repeat the same action many times to see how far they can go.

94
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,820
What? How dare you come here.

95
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:53,820
Citizens of Korea

96
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:57,890
can go anywhere they like.

97
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:00,350
Reporter Lee Ji Wuk, what brings you here?

98
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:04,450
Even if you didn't come on your own, you would probably receive a summons to be a witness soon.

99
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:07,320
I'm more into offense instead of defense, you see.

100
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:12,100
Gosh, this place looks bleak.

101
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,400
Here.

102
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,570
If I give you some information, what will you give me in return?

103
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:21,970
It's a clue that you police could have never dreamed of. Even if you summoned a witness, they would never tell you about this.

104
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:24,990
So I'm giving this only to you, especially.

105
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:27,740
- You're scaring me.
 - Hey.

106
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:31,200
In any case, why were you in Jangeui-dong? Did you crack the code?

107
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,060
We cannot tell you—

108
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:35,700
It was a coincidence.

109
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:38,790
We found out by coincidence.

110
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:41,800
He said you can't tell me. So you did crack the code, huh?

111
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:45,840
How can we break that code, it's so difficult. So how did we know that information?

112
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,330
Maybe we pick it up from the street? I don't remember.

113
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:49,700
Do you call yourselves police officers?

114
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:53,080
Let's at least hear your price for the information.

115
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,690
First, you will not summon me to be a witness.

116
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:58,390
And exclusive reporting rights.

117
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:01,130
Then, immunity from prosecution.

118
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:04,540
Why immunity?

119
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,720
So, illegal tailing, and also breaking and entering?

120
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,370
I just wanted to be certain.

121
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:16,010
If I reported it first, I would be called some attention-seeker making stuff up, then that makes me sad.

122
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:20,630
You did well. If we looked down on you as an attention-seeker making stuff up, then a crime happens,

123
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:22,120
then we're the ones who are sad.

124
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:27,890
I would love it if there were only people like you in this world, who investigate stuff on their own and just report it to us. I mean that.

125
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:31,950
So how certain is this information you have?

126
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:36,370
At the very least, I'm sure that it is information that the police would never, ever find on their own.

127
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:39,950
Aside from the fact that all the dead guys are all rich sons of b**ches

128
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:42,890
have you found that they all have something else in common?

129
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:44,540
Something else in common?

130
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,900
So let's take a look.

131
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,170
Why? Not going to give it to us?

132
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:18,500
I am a reporter. When to release what information is the secret of my success.

133
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:22,040
Hold on. Whatever that is, what if it helps our investigation—

134
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,080
You will regret this.

135
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:26,120
- I will make you regret it— 
 - But you won't, really.

136
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:29,190
What is this?

137
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:32,220
What can this be? I can't know just by looking at this.

138
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:36,350
Maybe you can explain it to me more nicely?

139
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:44,980
- Please, Reporter Lee Ji Wuk?
 - Yes, that's how you should talk to me.

140
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:47,540
If you are incompetent, you should give up having self-respect, too.

141
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:50,250
If you fight it, things don't turn out well.

142
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,640
Here.

143
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,500
All of them

144
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,420
have gone in and out of this building.

145
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:10,900
So all the people here have gone in and out of this building.

146
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,900
So that is why your fingerprints will be found here.

147
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:16,780
And the fingerprints say, "please take a look."

148
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:23,220
Reporter Lee. Reporter Lee?

149
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:28,670
If you tailed Choi Yong Seok, that would mean that you know who the next victim would be, why didn't you report it to the police?

150
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:31,460
How can I trust the police?

151
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:44,990
Or maybe you thought it would be a bigger scoop if he died?

152
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:46,570
What?

153
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:49,760
I'm sure that's not true.

154
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,140
Well, look at you.

155
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:17,630
A real siren. Do they want us catch the culprit or let him go?

156
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,930
  Along the Olympic Highway toward the Banpo Bridge the traffic is backed up.

157
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:41,410
-That's a fine. 
 - Go ahead and report me.

158
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,770
Are you insane?

159
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:49,010
It's not that you don't have self-respect, do you also want to die?

160
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:50,560
I just wanted to see you laugh.

161
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,430
If you had to do something funny, why do something which would kill you?

162
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:56,640
I'm afraid I can't drive.

163
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:59,090
And I don't expect to be able to in the future.

164
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:02,330
Lee Ji Wuk wants to get attention no matter what by creating issues.

165
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:03,930
Why do you go along with him?

166
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:07,630
As a result, we got information.  Isn't that good?

167
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:10,920
As long as the results are good, can the procedure be sloppy? The police—

168
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:15,110
When a police officer is driving, she should keep her eyes forward.

169
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:19,140
I don't understand why you have changed so much.

170
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:21,460
- You weren't like this in the past. 
  - I used to be like this.

171
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:24,970
- When you asked me to join your team— 
 -  Then?

172
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:30,760
At that time, I did what I needed to do then. Now I'm doing what I need to do now.

173
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:34,820
I thought you were someone I could respect.

174
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,600
Why are you laughing?

175
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,410
Because that is such a preposterous idea.

176
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,230
Look forward.

177
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:11,550
Hyung, should we just have dropped the bomb?  If we did, the ratings would have been amazing.

178
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:14,330
And, we would have been sued.

179
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:17,180
True. Yes, we should not be the ones releasing this.

180
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:20,700
If we want to make it really big, we need to be patient.

181
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:25,110
When will I show my hidden card.  That's what is important.

182
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:05,190
 Creating total suspicion is better than just saying it's suspicious.

183
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:10,170
 MODU

184
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:40,620
 Using the police to catch the police.

185
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:06,750
 Until they devour each other.

186
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:10,580
 That will make for a more stimulating image.

187
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:29,320
- Team Leader.
 - Yes?

188
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,260
I think you'll have to come see this.

189
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,840
What is that?
  Park Gyu Tae

190
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:52,140
 Baek Seung Jae

191
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:02,080
- Lee Ji Wuk did find the right place.
 - Yeah.

192
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:05,300
So he did find it.

193
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:12,900
 And that is the exclusive scoop.

194
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,880
Can't you make some noise when you come?

195
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:37,540
Should I sing loudly while coming to buy illegal drugs?

196
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:48,410
- Don't you have any bigger ones?
 - What if someone takes it and dies?

197
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:52,460
An idiot who takes drugs for stupid grades, who knows what he might do?

198
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:56,290
Stupid grades? Would I really do something that will ruin my life like that?

199
00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:59,380
- It's not as if I've given up on my life like you.
 - What did you say?

200
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:04,150
You're like some guy buried in sh*t who breathed some fresh air and mocks it.

201
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:08,470
If you have a lot to protect, then grades are not stupid.

202
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:12,330
- Did you finish talking?
 - No. Why?

203
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:21,420
You're done getting drugs from me.

204
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:23,540
Look at you, acting like a bigshot.

205
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,300
Do you know that you act as if you're mentally ill?

206
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:31,510
Acting proud like you've become important when you're being used.

207
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:36,170
When someone has nothing, I heard that he needs to at least have his head on straight.

208
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:50,840
 Park Gyu Tae

209
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:03,830
 Choi Yong Seok

210
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:16,400
- It's a new person.
  Son Min Ho

211
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,430
Is he the next victim?

212
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:24,070
 Son Min Ho

213
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:27,380
Look, it's fingerprint recognition.

214
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:31,110
It looks like I'll have to crack the password to look further.

215
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:33,660
- Is that so?
 - Will there be additional information?

216
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:37,540
Seeing how there are videos that weren't there when I connected to the counselling office in that building in Jangeui-dong,

217
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:40,590
it seems there is some kind of timed programming.

218
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:43,500
So I feel like I have to totally break this computer open to see what is in here.

219
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:47,030
Then let me bring it to the Cyber Investigation team.

220
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:48,760
Before you do that,

221
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:52,850
let us try it once. At worst, we're back to square one.

222
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:58,920
The probability of two people having the same fingerprints is one in 64 billion.

223
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:02,600
But due to the limitations of technology, analysis by a machine concludes that

224
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:06,530
two different fingerprints are the same.

225
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:09,250
As expected, that didn't work.

226
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:14,450
- Want to try it?
 - Yes. If I happen to match them, that will be totally awesome.

227
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:16,410
Staff Captain Do.

228
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:45,390
 NO MATCHING

229
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:54,990
 NO MATCHING

230
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:11,020
 NO MATCHING

231
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,070
- Of course, there's no way it would work.
 - Then Gong should try it this time.

232
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:19,940
I will take it to the Cyber Investigation team.

233
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:25,150
But still Gong ... hasn't tried it.

234
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:26,920
Staff Captain Do.

235
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:36,400
She's asking me to go with her.

236
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:43,930
There is a weird vibe between them, isn't there?

237
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:46,940
- Team Leader and Doctor— 
 - Is it weird in a good way or a bad way?

238
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:49,890
- Good? Bad— 
 - It would be weird in a good way.

239
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:53,910
Hold on. Does no one see me?

240
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,080
What are you hiding?

241
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:16,260
It seems as if no one has noticed,

242
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:19,150
but among the victim images in the video, Kim Yeong Jun isn't present.

243
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:22,360
 Baek Seung Jae

244
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:25,890
 And the Kim Yeong Jun case is kind of weird.

245
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:28,900
 He did find it.

246
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:33,420
You knew something.  Before you found the laptop.

247
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:37,490
You shouldn't suspect me just because I'm smart.

248
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:41,210
If you are smart, do you know that Kim Yeong Jun is different from the other victims?

249
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:45,270
How? And did you accidentally blurt it out what you knew?

250
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:48,680
You were pretending you didn't know, but said it by mistake?

251
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:53,380
By mistake?  I don't make mistakes or stuff like that.

252
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:58,080
If I know something and talk about it, there should be a good reason. For example,

253
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:02,760
sounding out an American citizen who suddenly fell from the sky.

254
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:05,900
Me?  Why?

255
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:10,260
Are you afraid I'll dig out what you're hiding?

256
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:17,910
What would I be hiding? Are you projecting because you're the one hiding something?

257
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:22,260
When the next victim video appeared, why were you surprised?

258
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:30,620
There's no record anywhere

259
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:33,760
that on the day Choi Yong Seok died he received sleep therapy.

260
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,090
Why do you think that happened?

261
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:41,540
That is, well, just.  I made an accidental bull's eye.

262
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:43,520
I think so too.

263
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:48,520
A new victim video emerged so it's natural to be surprised.

264
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,840
Accidentally.

265
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:55,110
In fact, the counseling office without a sign was within walking distance of the murder site.

266
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:58,680
No.  That's not possible.

267
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,470
You knew.

268
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:04,270
That day. Choi Yong Seok was on his way out from his sleep therapy session.

269
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:06,940
You knew something was going to happen.

270
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:18,440
Then, maybe I am the culprit.

271
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:34,970
But, do you really think that?

272
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:38,260
I told you not to let down your guard like this.

273
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:43,230
Me, I don't know.  Wh-What's the matter?

274
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:47,100
How could that be?

275
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:58,710
No.  Really.  How did this get into my pocket?

276
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:04,200
I mean I don't remember trying to do something bad.

277
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:08,800
Take off your clothing.

278
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:22,400
 Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency

279
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,910
Breaking into that laptop should take a while, right?

280
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:27,570
I suppose. I heard they'll be doing it manually.

281
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:31,060
At least it's possible in our country because we have all that fingerprint data.

282
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:37,040
I've smelled this somewhere.

283
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,930
What?

284
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,740
- What's the smell here? 
 - You're here?

285
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:48,090
Why does this investigation room smell like an autopsy room?

286
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:53,190
That's me.  That's me.  When I work, the smell of the corpse getting into my clothing and hair is no joke.

287
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:54,450
I was too busy to shower.

288
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:57,450
The smell of a c-corpse?

289
00:27:57,450 --> 00:28:01,050
The only women's shower is in the main building.

290
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:05,030
Employee well-being is a mess in your country.  Do I smell really bad?

291
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:10,480
But why did you feel the need to come all this way to honor us with a personal visit?

292
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,570
It was interesting.

293
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:16,340
The fingerprints of Kim Yeong Jun, Park Gyu Tae,  Baek Seung Jae and Choi Yong Seok came out beautifully.

294
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:20,310
Excuse me.  Did you say  Kim Yeong Jun's fingerprints came out?

295
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:23,190
Why?  Shouldn't they have come out?

296
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:30,220
No.  Please continue.

297
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:34,790
Anyway, that's not important.  I'm sure even the Deputy Chief received it by now.

298
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:47,020
- Another set of fingerprints came out and that person is—  
 - Son Min Ho?

299
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:48,820
- How did you know? 
 - How did you know?

300
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:50,180
How do you not know?

301
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:53,520
There is a laptop among the evidence and there is a picture of Son Min Ho in it.

302
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,880
Do you know him?

303
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,220
You should know him.

304
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:59,710
Didn't you go to high school? You didn't learn it in school?

305
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:22,580
 Analysis Report

306
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:25,100
 Kim  Yeong Jun 
 Park Gyu Tae

307
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:37,290
Son Min Ho

308
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:44,140
What do you want me to do if his fingerprints come out?

309
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:53,000
If we dig further into this, the higher-ups won't like it.

310
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,010
So how high does this go?

311
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:03,330
Really... probably somewhere the likes of us wouldn't know.

312
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:18,060
Is my smell strong?

313
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:19,870
No.

314
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:26,120
This is not official, but there is one more.

315
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:31,920
There were no prints and no DNA but when I computed the height, weight, and tendencies,

316
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:35,090
In a category not found elsewhere, there was one more genotype.

317
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:39,460
A man with a slight, well proportioned body.

318
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:44,030
Yes, he would be exactly your size and height.

319
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:46,730
Wearing worker boots, shoe size is 270.

320
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:50,260
Yes, I will keep that in mind.

321
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:52,670
- Bye. 
 - Yes.

322
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:09,820
European size 42.  It matches 270 mm, right?

323
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:12,690
If you keep bothering me, you will get hurt.

324
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:15,000
I'll do my briefing now.

325
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,900
Let's go.

326
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,380
 Son Min Ho Briefing.

327
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:33,170
Son Min Ho is a key figure in the disaster of White Night Village which shook Korea 28 years ago.

328
00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:37,610
White Night Village.  Did I learn about that in contemporary history?

329
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:39,860
I remembered.

330
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:44,590
It was part of the Children's Welfare Act of 1981.

331
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:49,780
The White Night Village was the first project devoted to communal parenting.

332
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:55,080
Following economic growth, in order to satisfy the material and psychological needs of orphans,

333
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:58,460
they created an entire village to become a family to raise the children together.

334
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:00,470
What made this possible was

335
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:04,940
the leadership of Son Min Ho, who was 24 years old at the time.
  Who is Mr. Son, the teacher of everyone in White Night Village?

336
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:08,880
Son Min Ho, who majored in education, appeared to be a born teacher.

337
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,720
But ultimately his business acumen got even better.

338
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:17,380
He completely changed the charity paradigm, which at the time only used ARS (Advanced Remarketing System) sponsors for funding.

339
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:21,180
 Hello.  How are you?

340
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:25,380
They sold nutritional supplements developed by a local doctor, who was then a resident of the town,

341
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:29,520
using the name Good Company, and sold it using the image of a social welfare enterprise.

342
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:32,770
The medicine seemed to be effective so you could think

343
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:37,850
you were doing good while buying a good product.

344
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:45,910
 How are you? Good job.

345
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:47,980
 Please take a seat.

346
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,140
 I'll take a picture.

347
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:55,620
  One, two, three.

348
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:58,700
It was a miraculous coincidence

349
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:04,730
that in that little town, there was someone who was both a genius doctor and a genius scientist. 
  Jo Hyeon Hui

350
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:13,900
In a village created by the government's policy of gathering children and raising them together,

351
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:17,450
a  miracle drug was invented and it hit the jackpot.

352
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:21,850
Oh, that's my grandfather's medicine.

353
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:26,800
We can say there is almost no one who had not taken it, since at the time it was considered a miracle drug.

354
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:31,260
The profits from the development and commercialization of this drug for the White Night Village

355
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:34,630
- at current value is about 900 billion won. 
 - 900 billion? ($832 million)

356
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:38,520
If we include the drugs that were distributed illegally, it would be about seven trillion won. ($6.4 billion)

357
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:47,960
It's not certain whether the drug was effective or it displayed the placebo effect,

358
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,700
but we can be sure who made a ton of money.

359
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:56,010
Few survived the day of disaster.

360
00:33:56,010 --> 00:33:58,010
Day of disaster?

361
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:04,450
As rapidly as the village was erected, actually, in just one day, it was completely demolished.

362
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:09,020
When the policed arrived on the island, a total of 7 people were survivors.

363
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:13,280
And all of them were minors, at that.

364
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,340
That means ...

365
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:19,660
among all of the people in that island village, all the adults died.

366
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:22,960
I heard it was a mass suicide but who is responsible?

367
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:27,340
No one. The project disappeared into thin air. Obviously there was something to hide.

368
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:31,000
Why wasn't anyone liable? Shouldn't Son Min Ho be held liable?

369
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,080
There was insufficient evidence to indict.

370
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:36,750
At the time of the disaster, a few of the researchers were away from the village

371
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:39,870
and Son Min Ho was among them.

372
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:44,920
Since then, that huge amount of money just disappeared.

373
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:47,570
At least it is not accounted for in the police records.

374
00:34:47,570 --> 00:34:49,660
Son Min Ho must have intercepted it.

375
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:52,300
He's a total scammer.

376
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:58,670
In conclusion, it means that by becoming one of our victims in our case

377
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:01,980
Son Min Ho is a very bad guy.

378
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:07,540
So our job is now to reach Son Min Ho.

379
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:37,830
Must you go so far?

380
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:43,770
 The victims, even after committing crimes,

381
00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:45,880
 took advantage of their privileges

382
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,770
Who knows when will it happen,

383
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:50,080
but if I am put on the death list tomorrow, 
   Directors of White Night Foundation

384
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:52,770
Yeah, that's it! We must go to this extent.

385
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:55,100
We have tracked down each of the children who survived the day of disaster,

386
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:58,920
retrieved them or otherwise disposed of them.

387
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:02,990
Are you sure the children on the list are everyone who survived?

388
00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:05,050
They were 8 or 9 years old.

389
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:08,780
The probability of the survivors avoiding the Foundation's hunt up to now,

390
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:11,150
is smaller than my suddenly becoming  insane and lighting a fire.

391
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:12,950
Me, I would bet that there are other children who survived,

392
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:16,980
avoided the foundation's pursuit, and are attacking.

393
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:20,940
 We are done now.

394
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:24,750
 White Night Village's Tenth Ceremony for the Hope Fund Donation

395
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:32,040
 Are you all right?

396
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:48,530
Fire is something that can be set as many times as anyone wants, isn't it?

397
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:52,060
 A new murder has been forewarned.

398
00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:57,310
 On the day a blue chicken embraces a white monkey

399
00:36:57,310 --> 00:36:59,840
 and an insect with its eyes closed

400
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:03,120
 will shake hands with an hot envoy.

401
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:09,310
 I hope the police can save a precious life this time.

402
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:14,810
 Taking one step closer to current events, this has been Lee Ji Wuk of Current Events Zoom-In

403
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:24,210
Okay, very good.  Good, good.

404
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:26,350
I can hear the viewer ratings going up.

405
00:37:26,350 --> 00:37:28,560
- Hyung, Hyung. 
  - What is it?

406
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:33,090
- How is the serial killer investigation going? 
 - What about it?

407
00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:37,550
You said they promised you an exclusive coverage?

408
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:40,080
Hey, do you believe what they say?

409
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:44,630
I believe the gambler saying he will quit gambling more than I believe the cops.

410
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,910
So it's not happening?

411
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:49,160
Good job.

412
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:51,120
They aren't?

413
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:55,460
I was looking forward to that.

414
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:58,460
- Good job. 
 - Good job.

415
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:01,290
- Thanks for your hard work. 
 - Have a safe trip home.

416
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:11,010
By the way, how come you promised Lee Ji Wuk exclusive coverage of the story?

417
00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:14,770
- Well, I didn't promise to tell him everything we know.  
 - What?

418
00:38:14,770 --> 00:38:17,230
It just has to be an exclusive, doesn't it?

419
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:21,630
Of course.  We don't have to tell him everything.

420
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:46,200
 Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency
Cyber Crime Investigation Unit

421
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,210
No, it's not done.

422
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:51,520
I know it's difficult but this is an urgent police case.

423
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:54,040
Is there any case that is not urgent?

424
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:57,520
Right. If you can at least let me know when it will be done—

425
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:00,650
If I knew that, I would have bought lottery tickets.

426
00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:05,480
People who don't understand why they don't get the results when they need them,

427
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:08,130
you know, instead of catering to people like that—

428
00:39:11,130 --> 00:39:12,200
I'm angry.

429
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,790
Speaking of your team leader,

430
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:17,420
isn't his condition too serious?

431
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:20,890
What kind of man is so lacking in principle and self-respect?

432
00:39:20,890 --> 00:39:22,370
Doesn't he have decent clothes?

433
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:27,370
Visiting another department, he dresses too casually, and lacks courtesy. I thought he was homeless.

434
00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:30,450
I can't deal with him matching wits with a 'rolling stone.'

435
00:39:30,450 --> 00:39:34,740
Really. He's the type I don't want to get close to.

436
00:39:35,610 --> 00:39:38,640
You are right, I hate your kind of style.

437
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,850
Hey. What does it matter what someone else wears or not?

438
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:46,220
Let go.

439
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:48,630
Just shut your eyes if you don't want to see it.

440
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:50,420
Don't stop me.

441
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:52,920
Do you know you're so great, huh?

442
00:39:57,650 --> 00:40:01,170
Blue chicken.  White monkey.

443
00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:05,610
1-1-0-0-1-0-0

444
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:45,740
 What the four victims have in common.

445
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:48,620
 Each has committed crimes for which there has been no punishment.

446
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:50,770
 Privileged class.

447
00:40:52,410 --> 00:40:54,050
 And

448
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:58,510
 the extraordinary swindler Son Min Ho.

449
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:09,320
 But why do I feel so icky?

450
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:13,290
 I'm especially giving it to you.

451
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,140
 That scares me.

452
00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:22,420
 So he did find it.

453
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,200
 What am I hiding?

454
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,780
 You're the one saying that it's me but I'm not doubting you.

455
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:39,830
 There's no record that Choi Yong Seok received therapy

456
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:43,010
 on the day he died, Choi Yong Seok had a therapy session.

457
00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:44,830
 So why did you think that?

458
00:41:44,830 --> 00:41:49,350
 Well, it was just an accidental bull's eye, but I was right.

459
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:13,330
Do you have something to say?

460
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:17,830
I've been concerned that you have been watching for quite a long time,

461
00:42:17,830 --> 00:42:20,390
but always turning away.

462
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,450
In the Department of  Information Management, I am —

463
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:29,100
I know you are the manager. And your name too.

464
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:34,580
Once I am introduced, I never forget.

465
00:42:35,610 --> 00:42:40,450
But why can't I recall that staff captain?

466
00:42:40,450 --> 00:42:43,410
If I really met him before...

467
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:53,110
Do you possibly think I deserve to see the personnel data on Captain Do?

468
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:03,310
Dr. Jamie, do you know usually you would not have access to the police personnel database.

469
00:43:03,310 --> 00:43:07,020
Yes. Consider me as very grateful.

470
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:11,950
It's kind of odd to say this is a trade, but can you do me a favor?

471
00:43:11,950 --> 00:43:16,100
I'll grant you any request that I can.

472
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:21,480
I heard the next victim is Teacher Son Min Ho and he is under investigation.

473
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:24,200
Yes, that's right.

474
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:28,710
I would like you to approach him very carefully.

475
00:43:28,710 --> 00:43:32,990
His situation is more complicated than anyone would imagine

476
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:38,650
and creating needless problems would not be good for anyone.

477
00:43:39,810 --> 00:43:44,020
Am I included in that anyone?

478
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:49,410
That isn't a threat, is it?

479
00:43:49,410 --> 00:43:51,350
I almost misunderstood.

480
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:57,340
Those who summoned you to work here in Korea, Mr. Son was one of them.

481
00:43:57,340 --> 00:43:59,630
I hope you are aware of that.

482
00:43:59,630 --> 00:44:01,770
I thought the police summoned me.

483
00:44:01,770 --> 00:44:05,370
Who is Mr. Son that he could summon me?

484
00:44:05,370 --> 00:44:08,490
If there's anything I don't know, would you please let me know.

485
00:44:08,490 --> 00:44:09,770
You don't need to know that.

486
00:44:09,770 --> 00:44:12,800
If you won't respond, I must deny your request.

487
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:15,560
This isn't a request.

488
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:44,060
Son Min Ho is

489
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:48,820
one of them who want this incident to be resolved.

490
00:45:07,910 --> 00:45:13,820
 Among the high-ranking officials that want this incident to be resolved, Son Min Ho is one of them.

491
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:16,630
 And the police intervention.

492
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,390
 You knew, right?

493
00:45:20,390 --> 00:45:25,800
 Choi Yong Seok was on his way out from his  sleep therapy session. You knew something was going to happen.

494
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:30,320
 Then, maybe I am the culprit.

495
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:36,030
 If it really wasn't speculation and he knew about it,/i&gt;

496
00:45:36,030 --> 00:45:38,720
  then Staff Captain Do is the culprit.

497
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:22,470
Come in.

498
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:27,490
Can we talk?

499
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,700
I'll enjoy the drink.

500
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:48,260
Why did you ask to talk to me?

501
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:53,280
Can I ask what you and Team Leader talked about last night?

502
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,740
Yesterday?

503
00:46:55,740 --> 00:46:57,420
We didn't talk about much.

504
00:46:57,420 --> 00:47:02,550
It seemed like Staff Captain Do knew that Choi Yong Seok received sleep therapy on the day of the incident,

505
00:47:02,550 --> 00:47:03,820
so I asked him about that.

506
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:06,620
How would Team Leader know about that?

507
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:12,000
It's weird, right? There's no way for him to know, but he knew.

508
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,960
 But what exactly are we looking for?

509
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:15,750
 If we don't know who it is, then that isn't part of the code.

510
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:17,960
 We found the victim.

511
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:20,560
How did he know it was the victim?

512
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:22,270
What?

513
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,980
No, so you're suspicious of Team Leader right now?

514
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:29,690
- When you investigate, sometimes you can guess correctly—

515
00:47:29,690 --> 00:47:34,100
-- He's a guy who guesses unusually well. 
 - He's not someone with things to hide.

516
00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:39,060
Lieutenant Gong, do you like Staff Captain Do?

517
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:44,510
If he wanted to hide something, he's someone who can hide anything.

518
00:47:44,510 --> 00:47:46,810
You two have the best chemistry.

519
00:47:46,810 --> 00:47:49,530
Having good chemistry is a different matter.

520
00:47:49,530 --> 00:47:53,230
Is saying there is an unresolved issue a reason not to share information?

521
00:47:53,230 --> 00:47:57,330
I mean, being out of sync is no reason at all.

522
00:47:57,330 --> 00:48:01,390
Being bothered by that means that you're unable to separate your personal life from work.

523
00:48:01,390 --> 00:48:04,320
They usually call that getting your feelings involved.

524
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:07,100
Feelings. It's not that.

525
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:09,120
Being suspicious of Team Leader or disparaging him,

526
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:12,920
becomes a problem for our whole team, so isn't it obvious that I'll oppose?

527
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:14,920
Even if Team Leader is a little unpredictable—

528
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:16,620
You do like him.

529
00:48:17,510 --> 00:48:21,600
- Why do you keep saying that? 
 - Because you like him.

530
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:27,360
Staff Captain Do does not appear to be in danger to me. Rather, he looks dangerous.

531
00:48:34,390 --> 00:48:36,230
Hey, you punk!

532
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:40,060
Hey, this punk.

533
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:51,340
What are you so busy doing?

534
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:53,940
Why did you show up all of a sudden?

535
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:56,690
Why am I the only one who fell?

536
00:48:56,690 --> 00:49:00,910
Stop saying useless things and give me the drugs. I'm the one who is really busy.

537
00:49:03,490 --> 00:49:05,920
This guy is a policeman.

538
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:14,620
Mister, f you're a policeman, then he's a hair designer.

539
00:49:14,620 --> 00:49:17,870
Should I cut your hair for you?

540
00:49:17,870 --> 00:49:20,460
Are you judging a book by it's cover?

541
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:24,530
Well, what you see is my appearance, so I can understand. I dressed a bit like a beggar today.

542
00:49:24,530 --> 00:49:26,060
Do you not have any ID?

543
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:28,500
I do.

544
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:30,470
Where is it?

545
00:49:34,250 --> 00:49:37,050
- I'll kill you right now.
 - I found it.

546
00:49:37,050 --> 00:49:40,750
Here, you see?

547
00:49:40,750 --> 00:49:42,820
The police are taking him in.

548
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:47,430
Also you, red hair. What did you say just now? Kill me?

549
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:02,490
You should go around looking like a policeman so that it's obvious even from 100  meters away.

550
00:50:02,490 --> 00:50:05,860
Instead, how about going around without getting chased?

551
00:50:05,860 --> 00:50:09,080
Well, does life ever turn out the way you want?

552
00:50:15,630 --> 00:50:17,290
What?

553
00:50:22,750 --> 00:50:24,270
What are you doing here?

554
00:50:24,270 --> 00:50:27,440
- Who is this? 
 - We were just going our way.

555
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:32,330
Your condition isn't good today.

556
00:50:32,330 --> 00:50:36,780
You two look kind of similar.

557
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:38,400
Are you also unable to sleep?

558
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:44,740
What? You've seen many people who need drugs but this noona's eyes look especially pitch black?

559
00:50:56,060 --> 00:51:00,520
Yes, my mysophobia and OCD gets worse when I'm stressed.

560
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:04,930
So what? I'll be fine really soon, why do you keep provoking me?

561
00:51:04,930 --> 00:51:08,750
Stress? What stress?

562
00:51:10,210 --> 00:51:11,260
Why do you want to know?

563
00:51:11,260 --> 00:51:15,300
I'm going to either increase or decrease you stress.

564
00:51:16,090 --> 00:51:18,060
I'm leaving.

565
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:28,100
Goodbye.

566
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:44,770
What do you think?

567
00:51:44,770 --> 00:51:46,970
- What?
- Pitch darkness.

568
00:51:46,970 --> 00:51:50,690
Is there pitch darkness in her eyes too?

569
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:58,420
 Stress? What stress?

570
00:51:59,650 --> 00:52:03,440
He said he would hurt me if I kept bothering him. Why is he concerned for me now?

571
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:08,500
No, he said he could give me more stress, too.

572
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:10,990
Which is it, anyway?

573
00:52:45,390 --> 00:52:48,730
Were you not trying to take this out?

574
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:10,920
What, you and Old Man know each other?

575
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:14,110
Wow, you're a totally corrupt policeman.

576
00:53:14,110 --> 00:53:16,900
Then buy your own drugs from now on.

577
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:18,660
Why do you keep calling me to buy your drugs?

578
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:21,220
I don't want to. I want to buy it from you.

579
00:53:21,220 --> 00:53:24,280
Do you have a lot of money? Do you not know that it's a lot cheaper to make a direct deal?

580
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:29,280
I do have a lot of money, so make money off me, and when you have enough for your grandmother's medical bills, then quit.

581
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:36,870
What are you talking about?  I'm doing this to buy a supercar.

582
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:41,800
I got it. Just go and make some instant noodles.

583
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:44,490
Okay.

584
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:12,890
I'm sorry for touching you like that last time.

585
00:54:12,890 --> 00:54:15,490
It wasn't sexual harassment.

586
00:54:15,490 --> 00:54:19,850
I'm a police officer and I mistook you for a thief.

587

 Kim Yeong Jun (19); Park Gyu Tae (54); Baek Seung Jae (32) 
 Choi Yong Seok (45) Son Min Ho (62)

September 14th, 2am.

589
00:54:59,010 --> 00:55:01,000
Area code 031 is Gyeonggi Province.

590
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,890
538 is a phone dialing code

591
00:55:13,130 --> 00:55:17,180
Anyhow, my personal information is available to everyone.

592
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:20,690
But I am a cop and I can't see a criminal's personal information.

593
00:55:20,690 --> 00:55:22,570
 Confidential

 1991 "White Day and Night" Published

596
00:55:40,130 --> 00:55:43,720
Old Man, help me find someone.

597
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:46,830
When you were looking for that woman, you asked someone else. Why are you asking me this time?

598
00:55:46,830 --> 00:55:50,500
I knew how the girl looked like but I don't know how this man looks like.

599
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:53,840
You're the best person for the job.

600
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:56,140
That's true.

601
00:55:56,140 --> 00:56:00,340
But why should I help you?

602
00:56:00,340 --> 00:56:03,290
I told you not to come here.

603
00:56:03,290 --> 00:56:05,050
Man, 34 years old.

604
00:56:05,050 --> 00:56:08,120
I don't know. I don't like men. Especially 34 year old men.

605
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:10,120
There's a high possibility that he doesn't have a resident registration number.

606
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:13,690
Even if he has one, it might not be his own.

607
00:56:13,690 --> 00:56:17,770
He could be with a man in his 40s, but that's not definite.

608
00:56:17,770 --> 00:56:21,430
Around 180cm tall, with fair skin.

609
00:56:21,430 --> 00:56:24,820
He has thick eyebrows and he has long eyes.

610
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:27,500
He has pretty prominent cheekbones, but his jawline is not as defined.

611
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:32,830
He probably has emotional disorders like mysophobia, OCD, paranoia.

612
00:56:32,830 --> 00:56:35,350
I really don't like this guy.

613
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:39,880
Excuse me!

614
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:45,790
The picture from last time... what relationship do you have with her?

615
00:56:45,790 --> 00:56:48,540
Well, it's not that I'm trying to create trouble at this stage,

616
00:56:48,540 --> 00:56:51,820
but it's related to the case I'm currently investigating.

617
00:56:51,820 --> 00:56:54,700
I wondered if she was someone you knew well.

618
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:56,260
She's just...

619
00:56:57,230 --> 00:57:00,190
someone I saw here.

620
00:57:00,190 --> 00:57:05,030
One day, she disappeared, and I saw her picture, so...

621
00:57:05,030 --> 00:57:07,590
I didn't intend to steal it.

622
00:57:08,650 --> 00:57:10,560
That person...

623
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:13,600
died.

624
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:15,420
Did you know that?

625
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:19,250
 I'll help you checkout.

626
00:57:19,250 --> 00:57:21,510
 Good-bye!

627
00:57:25,110 --> 00:57:27,630
 I'll help you checkout.

628
00:57:27,630 --> 00:57:29,380
 It's 1,200 won.

629
00:57:29,380 --> 00:57:31,810
 I received 2,000 won.

630
00:57:48,820 --> 00:57:51,420
Hold on. Wait a minute.

631
00:57:52,650 --> 00:57:57,080
If you happen to remember anything about that part-timer

632
00:57:57,080 --> 00:58:00,670
or if there's anything I can help with, contact me.

633
00:58:07,330 --> 00:58:12,370
For example, if you were physically assaulted.

634
00:58:12,370 --> 00:58:15,090
Anyway, whatever it is.

635
00:58:17,930 --> 00:58:22,050
Gosh!  I touched you again, sorry!

636
00:58:25,220 --> 00:58:28,260
I keep feeling concerned about him.

637
00:58:30,210 --> 00:58:32,510
Is he my type?

638
00:58:37,270 --> 00:58:43,030
I really... dislike being touched, too...

639
00:58:44,150 --> 00:58:46,660
but I didn't dislike it just now.

640
00:59:12,430 --> 00:59:16,170
010 635 2258

641
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:52,530
I found it!

642
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:05,590
Why pray when you don't do a single thing that God would like?

643
01:00:05,590 --> 01:00:08,780
Why would I pray if I was going to do something that God would like?

644
01:00:08,780 --> 01:00:12,750
I'm kissing butt since I'm going to do something God will not like.

645
01:00:12,750 --> 01:00:16,070

01:00:20,430 --> 01:00:24,720
It's a common belief that greatness begins with goodwill.

647
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:28,990
But in human history, great progress and benefits

648
01:00:28,990 --> 01:00:32,000
originated mostly from ill will.

649
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:35,060
If a good deed is achieved due to ill will,

650
01:00:35,060 --> 01:00:39,100
then wouldn't the original ill will become good?

651
01:00:39,100 --> 01:00:43,300
What is good? What is bad?

652
01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:44,550
Does God exist?

653
01:00:44,550 --> 01:00:47,260
I don't know, but there is something I do know.

654
01:00:47,260 --> 01:00:52,460
That if a religion lasted over two thousand years, there is a reason for that.

655
01:00:52,460 --> 01:00:56,090
You were nearly dying, and of all people, you collapsed in front of me.

656
01:00:56,090 --> 01:01:00,640
Someone who could make a new ID for you and help you live a new life. There's a reason for that, too.

657
01:01:01,630 --> 01:01:05,430
That's true, there is a reason for everything.

659
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:21,070
 Sunjeong LP

660
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:41,900
 Boy, are you alright?

661
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:44,040
 Oh dear, are you alright?

662
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:46,420
 Boy, come to your senses.

663
01:01:46,420 --> 01:01:47,830
 - Boy?
 - Hey.

664
01:01:47,830 --> 01:01:49,360
 Hey, hey.

665
01:01:49,360 --> 01:01:52,320
 Hey. What's wrong with him?

666
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:55,160
 Do you know him?

667
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:58,190
 - Boy?
 - Hey.

668
01:01:58,190 --> 01:02:00,150
 Who are you, huh?

669
01:02:01,220 --> 01:02:02,560
 This is driving me nuts.

670
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:04,080
 Wake up, Boy.

671
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:06,790
 Hey, hey, hey!

672
01:02:06,790 --> 01:02:09,320
 Hey, hey!

673
01:02:10,700 --> 01:02:13,660
 A street with no one around.

674
01:02:13,660 --> 01:02:17,300
If the clock which is never wrong indicates it is midnight,

675
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:21,160
then is it daytime or night?

676
01:02:23,420 --> 01:02:28,520
Should we confirm it once?

677
01:03:06,730 --> 01:03:12,250
You are following me right now, aren't you?

678
01:03:12,250 --> 01:03:14,040
Why?

679
01:03:38,570 --> 01:03:40,160
- Yes, why?
 - Team Leader.

680
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:43,700
I'm reading a book right now that Son Min Ho wrote 29 years ago.

681
01:03:43,700 --> 01:03:46,210
This book just happened to be in my home.

682
01:03:46,210 --> 01:03:48,120
I wonder how I remembered that.

683
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:49,390
Keep it short.

684
01:03:49,390 --> 01:03:51,360
- Are you busy?
 - Yeah.

685
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:54,100
- At this hour?
 - You're not keeping this short.

686
01:03:55,160 --> 01:03:57,060
I feel like this is an important key, somehow.

687
01:03:57,060 --> 01:03:59,890
But I can't quite grasp it precisely.

688
01:03:59,890 --> 01:04:03,590
Then let's meet in 30 minutes. I am at...

689
01:04:04,970 --> 01:04:06,990
Hello? Team Leader?

690
01:04:06,990 --> 01:04:09,840
Hello? Hello?

691
01:04:38,710 --> 01:04:40,160
Doctor, are you alright?

692
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:42,160
It's me, it's me.

693
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:43,580
Staff Captain Do.

694
01:04:43,580 --> 01:04:47,360
- Is it you?
 - Where are you touching me? Are you a habitual sex offender? Are you alright now?

695
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:50,540
I just couldn't see.

696
01:04:50,540 --> 01:04:54,060
She threw dirt in my face, so cowardly.

697
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:11,100
Why do you look at someone's family photo so intently?

698
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:21,090
Well, I have a lot of interest in you, Doctor.

699
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:26,200
Don't change the subject.

700
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:30,160
What are you trying to find out while pretending to be interested in me?

701
01:05:34,530 --> 01:05:39,460
Right now, is it daytime

702
01:05:39,460 --> 01:05:41,620
or night?

703
01:05:41,620 --> 01:05:43,290
 I become curious.

704
01:05:43,300 --> 01:05:47,400
 Right now, is it daytime or night?

705
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:52,920
What did you just say?

706
01:05:54,990 --> 01:05:57,830
How do you know that?

707
01:05:57,830 --> 01:05:59,700
Are you curious?

708
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:05,530
I am from White Night Village.

709
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:41,660

710
01:06:44,990 --> 01:06:48,120
 Awaken

711
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:53,000
 Three people associated with White Night Village are involved in this case. So you expect me to stop being suspicious?

712
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:54,360
 Are you suspecting me again?

713
01:06:54,360 --> 01:06:57,450
 I think that solution lies with you, Staff Captain Do.

714
01:06:57,450 --> 01:06:58,390
 Search everything.

715
01:06:58,390 --> 01:06:59,910
 I have to prepare for tonight.

716
01:06:59,910 --> 01:07:01,890
 Give me the information that involves Team Leader.

717
01:07:01,890 --> 01:07:04,180
 There are 12 minutes left.

718
01:07:04,180 --> 01:07:09,240
 A child who survived couldn't overcome the urge to kill and began causing these incidents?

719
01:07:09,240 --> 01:07:11,430
 Is that child me or you?

720
01:07:11,430 --> 01:07:15,490
 I'm just wondering if right now it is daytime or night, that is all.
