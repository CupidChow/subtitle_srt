1
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:15,960

2
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:38,100
 Awaken

3
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,460
I'm Lieutenant Gong Hye Won from the special team.

4
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:54,090
The cell phone number 0103121396 is turned off. Please see if you can detect its last signal.

5
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:55,630
Whose number is it?

6
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:57,540
Our Team Leader, Staff Captain Do Jeong Wu.

7
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:59,770
Please hurry.

8
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:03,600
The last location is Changwol-dong.

9
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,930
No one has reported a case like this in this area.

10
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:10,170
Could you check it once more?

11
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,000
How many times do I have to say it, there wasn't any?

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,290
We're all very occupied right now.

13
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:17,170
Sir, Sir.

14
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:19,900
Please calm down, please.

15
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:29,850
I'm sure he's fine. He often turns his phone off.

16
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:33,320
 Staff Captain Do does not appear to be in danger to me.

17
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,090
 Rather, he looks dangerous.

18
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:41,730
If he appears to be in danger to me, does that mean that I worry about him unnecessarily?

19
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:45,020
Tailing? Why would anyone tail you?

20
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:47,620
Exactly.

21
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:50,780
Who and why would someone be tailing me?

22
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:52,130
 Episode 4

23
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:55,120
A criminal who is scared because I correctly suspected her?

24
00:01:55,120 --> 00:02:01,030
Or maybe a Team Leader who is on guard because someone who is smarter than him joined the team?

25
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:05,130
Are you suspecting me again?

26
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:08,310
Correct. Let's say that I was suspicious of you.

27
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:11,660
But I think the person who tailed me was a woman.

28
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:16,160
She's probably hurt. I felt her muscle rupture when I threw her down.

29
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,760
She will probably need treatment at a hospital.

30
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:26,990
Don't pay attention. It's just a habit of mine.

31
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,050
What?

32
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:37,140
If you are sensitive enough to feel her muscles, then I think I made a mistake previously.

33
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:40,680
I couldn't put any force into it because it was too sudden. Give it to me again.

34
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,530
Here, my arm is tense.

35
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,570
Yes, it's me.

36
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:11,870
See if there is any woman who went to a hospital emergency room with a muscle injury or fracture.

37
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:16,560
About 170 cm tall, and dressed in black, top and bottom.

38
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,470
Thanks.

39
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:35,020
Why do you look at someone's family photo so intently?

40
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:45,080
Well, I have a lot of interest in you, Doctor.

41
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:50,140
Don't avoid the subject with something irrelevant.

42
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:53,390
What are you trying to find out while pretending to be interested in me?

43
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:55,720
Trying to distract me with your good looks?

44
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,070
It's not that I haven't heard such things before, but I admit that is rather bold.

45
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:01,590
So if you think I'm exploiting my good looks, that obviously means you think I amâ€”

46
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:04,440
Kidding.

47
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:07,540
But why do you suspect me so much?

48
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:12,080
Because I assumed that Choi Yong Seok was just coming from a sleep therapy session?

49
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,440
There are people who can never commit crimes, even if they died.

50
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,510
And even among criminals, there are levels.

51
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,720
There are those who can only commit petty crimes.

52
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,470
Theft, fraud, robbery, murder.

53
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:28,170
But with you, Staff Captain Do,

54
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:30,650
I can't see what level you are.

55
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:33,340
That's because I'm at the highest level.

56
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:36,130
So you are capable of anything

57
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:37,990
or able to not do anything.

58
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:40,640
Why do you think that?

59
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:47,810
Because I am the same way.

60
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:59,870
I keep thinking that you and I are similar.

61
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:01,990
Why would that be?

62
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:09,020
Right now, is it daytime

63
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:11,100
or night?

64
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,860
 I wonder.

65
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:17,010
 whether right now is it daytime or night?

66
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:22,380
What did you just say?

67
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:27,340
How do you know that?

68
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:29,510
Are you curious?

69
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:32,120
That is the same as my dream.

70
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,960
No, not a dream...

71
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,360
... collapsed, unable to move...

72
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:41,820
How do you know about that?

73
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,500
You said we are similar.

74
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,840
I am from White Night Village.

75
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:04,750
 Awaken

76
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:11,720
I have a memory that I don't know.

77
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,810
 In June 1992, in front of the U.S. Army base,

78
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:20,690
 having received a command to transfer and planning to leave Korea in one month

79
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:24,640
 Colonel Anthony Leighton of the U.S. Army found me.

80
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:36,410
 Little girl, are you okay?

81
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:39,930
 Please help me.

82
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:48,840
 I did not have any memories.

83
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,590
 Alright, let's go sweetie.

84
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:54,910
 They searched the nearby areas, but no one was looking for me.

85
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:59,570
 So Father decided to adopt me and take me to the U.S.

86
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:07,380
 A lot of time and money was spent, but my memories never returned.

87
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:11,350
 Based on what little memory I did recover,

88
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:17,250
 and the doctor's opinion that there was a high possibility that I was suffering from PTSD, we stopped treatment.

89
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:21,720
 You'll be fine.

90
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:26,910
 I was young and I could begin a new life.

91
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:30,780
 So there was no need to remember bad memories.

92
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:42,440
 But I couldn't escape from it completely.

93
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:05,230
 Thanks for coming.

94
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:46,050
 The Day of Disaster, the Brutality of White Night Village

95
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:52,460
 You asked me why I came to Korea, right?

96
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:59,330
Because I knew that I saw a monster.

97
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:03,680
What saved my life was the monster.

98
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:33,840
 Because I knew that I saw a monster.

99
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:38,180
 What saved my life was the monster.

100
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:26,540
Sorry. I slipped.

101
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:31,210
Oh, really.

102
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:34,250
Don't you know that a broken mirror means seven years of bad luck?

103
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:36,650
But I got hurt, too.

104
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,860
If I have bad luck for the next seven years, it's all your fault.

105
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:48,600
I didn't know you believed in superstitions.

106
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:49,650
Superstitions?

107
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:53,540
The faith that helps you believe it is unscientific.

108
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:55,690
But the problem here is,

109
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:59,020
where is the boundary between what is scientific and unscientific?

110
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:02,460
In 1814, Laplace, a mathematician, said this,

111
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:06,680
"An intellect which at a certain moment would know all forces that set nature in motion, and all positions of all items of which nature is composed...

112
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:09,640
... for such an intellect nothing would be uncertain

113
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:13,200
and the future just like the past would be present before its eyes."

114
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,350
So what people believe to be the realm of the unscientific,

115
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:20,150
for whoever knows all, it is the realm of the scientific.

116
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:24,620
So now I'll try to approach this scientifically.

117
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:28,150
Now, I've shown you all my cards.

118
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:29,890
So what happened?

119
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:32,140
How you spent your childhood?

120
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:35,250
Or why you came to Korea?

121
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:36,840
Or how you said you saw a monster?

122
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:40,160
I dreamt a lot of monster dreams when I was little, too.

123
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,550
You are the criminal of this crime.

124
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:44,750
Do you really think I am that kind of person?

125
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:45,930
Answer me properly.

126
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:50,220
I'm just curious to know if it is daytime or night right now.

127
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:58,010
 Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency

128
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,760
Don't you have anything to say to me?

129
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,350
No.

130
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,420
You don't?

131
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:09,190
You asked to see me and suddenly hung up. Then you should contact me, don't you know that?

132
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:10,530
Didn't you graduate from kindergarten?

133
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:12,580
How did you know? I did not.

134
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,270
You really must not have.

135
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:19,850
If you did, then you must have learned that you shouldn't ignore and walk away from someone when they're talking to you.

136
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:22,190
What is that now?

137
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:24,800
I was going to make you need a bandage, but you've already got one.

138
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,380
His injury isn't serious.

139
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,630
Oh, thank you.

140
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:32,960
Ah, Lieutenant Gong, good morning.

141
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:37,180
Are you two coming to work together now?

142
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,350
Ah, this is relieving my fatigue.

143
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:41,170
That is how things turned out.

144
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:42,950
I'll tell you about it later.

145
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:47,250
Why talk about your private life with others?

146
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:50,190
Let us forget what happened last night.

147
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:51,300
What happened last night?

148
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,480
I acknowledge that it is our private lives.

149
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:56,090
- But I cannot forget it.
 - You acknowledge it?

150
00:12:56,090 --> 00:13:00,250
Just think of it as one night's dream. You should return to reality now.

151
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:02,960
Come on now.

152
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,950
One night?

153
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:09,820
- Say that we can disregard your rank.
 - Why?

154
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:11,470
- Just for three seconds.
 - I don't want to.

155
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:14,770
Just disregard your rank for just three seconds. Please. Now!

156
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:16,580
Okay.

157
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:26,250
Are you alright?

158
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:31,120
Is my nose bleeding? Aish.

159
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,230
 Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency 
 Cyber Crimes Investigations

160
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:35,460
It's my job to confirm.

161
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:39,860
As I spoke to you yesterday, it is urgentâ€”

162
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:44,900
On TV, someone brings the evidence right to you, saying, "do a good job investigating."

163
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:48,650
And lab results come out and someone cracks the passwords. So you think that will happen in reality, right?

164
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:52,820
Really, investigation teams are so ignorant.

165
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:56,350
They think that we pound on the keyboard a few times and everything gets solved, indeedâ€”

166
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:02,340
Anyway, that is what people say. Don't pay attention.

167
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:05,070
- It's not finished yet?
 - Huh?

168
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:08,570
It's not something

169
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:11,550
that I can do, however...

170
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:16,230
I guess I'll pound on that laptop for a bit.

171
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,930
What are you doing?

172
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:24,030
Let me apologize to you.

173
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:27,040
Judging someone by their outward appearance? That is good.

174
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:31,070
To look at people's insides? That's an illusion. You can't see that, people are what you see.

175
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:34,900
Yes, that's true. What you see is all there is.

176
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:38,900
Please continue to look down on others based on what they look like to you.

177
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:41,650
Because I plan to do the same starting today.

178
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,100
If you crack the laptop, then let us know right away.

179
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,640
Yes.

180
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:00,100
Yes, yes.

181
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,310
Yes, hold on.

182
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:07,700
Yes, I am Hwang Byeong Cheol, Deputy Chief of the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency.

183
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:24,770
I'm similar. I've lost parts of my memories, although I think I remember a little more than you do.

184
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:30,270
What is certain is that something horrible happened there.

185
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,740
I just wanted to confirm it.

186
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:36,370
I found you suspicious from the first time I saw you, too.

187
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:38,330
Me? Why?

188
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:41,210
You appeared suddenly and you were right about everything.

189
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:43,790
As if you knew everything from the start.

190
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:48,850
No, it just means that I am a little quicker than others because I am smart.

191
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:52,690
But I'm like that, too.

192
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:56,950
Being curious about whether it is day or night.

193
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:58,880
What is that?

194
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,330
I keep thinking about it. So I am curious.

195
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,330
Me too.

196
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:07,460
I feel like it's related to my lost memories.

197
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:12,110
The truth is, I became a police officer hoping I could find out more.

198
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:14,310
- But...
 - But?

199
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:17,030
I couldn't find anything.

200
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:20,870
I guess they're really high up that people like us can't touch them.

201
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:26,690
And maybe it's best to just not know.

202
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:27,850
What does that mean?

203
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:29,940
It means, stop suspecting me.

204
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:33,430
Three people associated with White Night Village are involved in this case.

205
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:34,820
So you expect me to stop being suspicious?

206
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:37,750
What is worse, I was told that Son Min Ho summoned me here.

207
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:40,210
Someone who suddenly appeared

208
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:43,710
claims to have been summoned here by the person designated as the next victim.

209
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:46,080
Isn't that the most suspicious part?

210
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:50,900
Let's suppose that someone did kill some people for some reason.

211
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:53,010
And that person, using her status,

212
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:57,350
for example, that she was a consultant to the FBI, and using that to get closer to the case.

213
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:00,440
Pretending that she is innocent and naive, and really trying to solve this case.

214
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:03,850
But then she suspects the police force that has jurisdiction and ruins everything.

215
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:06,120
That seems much more likely.

216
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:12,020
 He's not wrong about anything.

217
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:16,840
 I suspected Staff Captain Do because he approached the case so quickly.

218
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:22,490
 And Staff Captain Do suspected me because I approached the case so quickly.

219
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:30,330
 Conclusively, White Night Village is not the critical issue in this case.

220
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,520
 The victims that are involved...

221
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:36,650
 No, the prospective victim is Son Min Ho.

222
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:40,710
 But why does it feel like this isn't all of it?

223
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:45,880
 Why does White Night Village feel like it's this entire case?

224
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:49,560
Loyalty.

225
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:58,510
This is the new forewarning notice.

226
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,680
Using the "Celestial Stems" and "Earthly Branches" systems

227
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:06,080
if we analyze "blue chicken is embracing the white monkey,"

228
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:10,110
blue chicken is September, and white monkey is 14th.

229
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:13,400
And if we use the binary system to analyze the jewel symbols, it's 2 a.m.

230
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:17,200
If we look at the area code, it's Yangwu City, Samwonho-dong.

231
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:20,350
So in summary, on September 14th, at 2 a.m.,

232
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:24,340
the incident is expected to happen in Yangwu City, Samwonho-dong.

233
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:29,010
And Son Min Ho lives in Yangwu City, Samwonho-dong, in Unit 41.

234
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:31,850
The home is in Nam Wu Cheon's name, but he is Son Min Ho's personal lawyer.

235
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:34,000
So it seems certain that Son Min Ho is the next victim.

236
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,940
We can guess that there might be a fire, based on the note saying, "hot envoy."

237
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:40,810
In that case, we must watch the villa's surroundings.

238
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:42,550
I will request cooperation from the fire department.

239
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:44,680
If possible, maybe we can restrict that area at that timeâ€”

240
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:47,650
We don't need cooperation from the fire department.

241
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:51,670
- That is actually more dangerous.
 - Then maybe the criminal is the fire department.

242
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:55,810
What's wrong with your hand?

243
00:18:55,810 --> 00:19:00,130
I knew you would get hurt going around acting like a smart Alec.

244
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:02,800
Samsonho-dong, Unit 41 is a private property.

245
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:05,650
It doesn't appear that all the incidents happened on public land.

246
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:07,890
So that's a strange thing to say.

247
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:11,150
What is more strange is that they entrusted this case to the police

248
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,960
but not even a few days have passed,

249
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,260
and they bring in a consultant from abroad.

250
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:20,740
But here you are, Dr. Jamie. Yes, our country is kind of a mess, like that.

251
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,100
How chilly.

252
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:29,090
In any case, we cannot enter this private property.

253
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:33,250
The private land is very big, but we cannot enter.

254
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:35,280
Then should we just stand by and do nothing?

255
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:40,460
We get paid from taxes but even if people die, we just claim that it's never our fault...

256
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:44,110
... of course, we will not do that, will we?

257
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:45,530
Oh, really.

258
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:50,070
Watch quietly from nearby.

259
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:54,260
I am warning you, just in case, make sure to not let this become a bigger issue.

260
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:56,770
It's only for prevention's sake, so just stand by and watch.

261
00:19:56,770 --> 00:20:00,940
It wasn't easy getting permission even to do this much.

262
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:03,320
Wow, we should thank Reporter Lee Ji Wuk, then.

263
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:08,900
So if this didn't become a big story, then we wouldn't have gotten permission at all, right?

264
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:12,700
Just do what you are told.

265
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,890
I understand.

266
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:18,430
Eat all of this too.

267
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,660
What the bank robbers took wasn't found yet?

268
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:52,830
I will interrogate them further.

269
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:55,510
Every time they "eat," they scatter.

270
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:57,990
No one can be trusted.

271
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:01,350
And what about MODU or whatever? That guy who does the internet?

272
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:06,110
I'm still trying to persuade him, but he's tough.

273
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:08,130
Please don't worry.

274
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:12,260
Nothing is going my way

275
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:14,710
so how can I not worry?

276
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:33,330
Is there any point in watching this from such a long distance?

277
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:36,010
We can't even use crime prevention cameras.

278
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:39,640
What were you doing when Chief was speaking seriously? We should be grateful with what we got.

279
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:43,910
And for crime prevention cameras, we shouldn't rely on others.

280
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:48,530
There is some time left before the forewarned time, so please visit the Psychology Research Facility.

281
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:51,500
And if you return to the U.S., it would be better.

282
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,790
So you're telling me that it's over?

283
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:57,890
Yes, I'm done with my business with you after that one night.

284
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:02,470
Hey, I can't even get these crime prevention cameras connected.

285
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:05,830
Inflaming my competitive instincts as a man like this, huh?

286
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:07,370
- Lieutenant Yun?
 - Yes?

287
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:08,160
Where are you going?

288
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:12,160
Well, it feels like I shouldn't be here right now.

289
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:15,260
No, of course, this is the place I must be. Yes.

290
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:18,860
Well, it would be good if you visited the restroom.

291
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:20,940
Yes, I will go.

292
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:26,800
Oh, Lieutenant Jang, we're fine, get out, get out, get out.

293
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:37,430
How can you consider leaving my side to visit the Psychology Research Facility?

294
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:40,570
Please give me a straight answer, and don't avoid it.

295
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:42,450
The incidents that are happening,

296
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:47,390
are they really not related to the fact that we are both from White Night Village?

297
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:51,570
Wouldn't only the criminal know the answer to that?

298
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:55,650
If I leave you alone, I feel like you're only going to keep trying to feel me out.

299
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:59,710
So to be honest, I found you suspicious.

300
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:02,210
So I'm suspicious of the rolling stone.

301
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:04,450
And I just did nothing, as I'm a stone that's been stuck here.

302
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:06,790
But the stuck stone is hiding something.

303
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:09,840
- Hiding what?
 - Everything.

304
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:14,290
You are so strange that I don't even know where to begin with.

305
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:17,000
If you are that suspicious of me, and you really think that I am the criminal,

306
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,470
then bring the evidence and report me to the police agency.

307
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:22,000
You have at least that much authority, since you were summoned from the U.S.

308
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,440
Why do you keep hovering next to me and giving me a hard time?

309
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,680
I think that the solution lies with you, Staff Captain Do.

310
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:35,050
 Do Jeong Wu, this bastard.

311
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:39,150
I am suspicious, but aside from the CCTV, there is no clear evidence.

312
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:45,820
And I can't find anything about him, no matter how much I dig in.

313
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:54,740
 Gong Hye Won, Age 29, Lieutenant

314
00:23:56,950 --> 00:24:00,180
 - Are you alright?
 - This guy, really...

315
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:01,200
 You will regret this.

316
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,930
  - I will make you regret thisâ€”  
 - But you won't, really.

317
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:07,620
 What is this now?

318
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:14,640
 Lieutenant Gong Hye Won

319
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:19,320
Should I really make them devour each other?

320
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:22,490
- I can't hear them.
 - You can't?

321
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:25,260
They're bickering. They're fighting right now.

322
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,780
What are you doing, not going inside?

323
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:29,850
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

324
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:32,060
What?

325
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:35,790
- Right now, inside, Team Leader and Dr. Leightonâ€” 
 - Lover's quarrel.

326
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:39,290
I told you the way she's been looking at him lately was not normal.

327
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:41,150
Ah, really.

328
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:44,370
Did you know about this? I'm the only one who didn't?

329
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:50,400
Wow, Team Leader. Even like this, your charms...

330
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:58,230
Hello... hold on.

331
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:04,660
What is it?

332
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:09,720
The day of disaster was horrible enough that a child who experienced it

333
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:12,670
could have grown into a psychopath.

334
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:19,090
And this could be possible as well.

335
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:23,430
A child who survived couldn't overcome the urge to kill

336
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:26,420
and began causing these incidents?

337
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:30,480
Is that child me or you?

338
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:35,570
Do I seem like that type to you?

339
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:41,710
I don't think of you as that type, actually.

340
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:45,330
Amnesia.

341
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:50,220
That means there is a problem in the head, so if one of us is a psychopathâ€”

342
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:11,550
I'll visit the Psychology Research Facility.

343
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,500
We are not finished yet.

344
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:36,090
Hey, open the door.

345
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:48,700
How is the connection of the crime prevention cameras coming along?

346
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:50,990
I don't think it will be easy like this.

347
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:52,420
I will take my leave.

348
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:58,130
 There is a way to directly connect to a computer that's on the inside and accessing the firewall code.

349
00:26:58,130 --> 00:27:00,930
That way, we can access any CCTV, no matter how strong the security is.

350
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:05,860
The problem is that there is only one computer that ever leaves and reenters this house.

351
00:27:09,050 --> 00:27:14,000
It's Son Min Ho's attorney's laptop that travels back and forth from this house to the company.

352
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:19,880
Nam Wu Cheon, age 48. His schedule is almost like a robot.

353
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:22,480
He goes to work at 8 a.m. to Son Min Ho's home.

354
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:28,300
After that, he works at his company until 9 p.m. and returns immediately to his home to rest.

355
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:31,060
He doesn't smoke or drink, and we don't know anything about his hobbies.

356
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:33,620
He only works on cases that makes him money.

357
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:36,880
And if it will make him money, he will do any kind of work.

358
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:45,540
 C.E.O.: Nam Wu Cheon

359
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:51,140
Do Jeong Wu, why did you go to that building in Jangeui-dong, anyway?

360
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:52,700
Huh, Jeong Wu?

361
00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:57,220
Reporter Lee Ji Wuk, you have mail.

362
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:03,010
 To: Reporter Lee Ji Wuk

363
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:08,280
 Blue chicken embraces a white monkey. 
 Above a fire a bug with eyes closed will shake hands with a hot envoy.

364
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:12,210
 September 14th, 2 a.m., Gyeonggi Province, Yangwu City, Samwonho-dong, Unit 41

365
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:28,380
Everyone has been to this building.

366
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,950
What is this?

367
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,430
Hold on.

368
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:58,180
What if

369
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:01,930
Do Jeong Wu is not the culprit... ?

370
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:04,780
 Gong Hye Won, Age 29, Lieutenant

371
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:07,670
 Jang Ji Wan, Age 29, Lieutenant

372
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:18,180
 Jamie, Age 36, Former FBI, Special Assignment

373
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:38,560
 Lee Ji Wuk

374
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,810
What do you want?

375
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:41,050
Search everything.

376
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:43,070
Where she was born, where and how she lived, and how she grew up.

377
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:43,780
Who is this woman?

378
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:45,290
Whatever you find, send it to my phone.

379
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:49,060
I have to prepare for tonight.

380
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:51,580
 Attorney Nam Wu Cheon

381
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,260
Mr. Park Gi Bong is here.

382
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:09,700
Ask him to come in.

383
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,680
About that...

384
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:56,820
 Oh, you've come, Attorney?

385
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:59,650
 I have slight claustrophobia (fear of confined sapce)

386
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:01,250
 so I asked to see you in this conference room.

387
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:03,630
What's with his speech?

388
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:07,050
I think he formed the character incorrectly.

389
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:11,250
Have a seat.

390
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:26,000
I told your office manager already.

391
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,330
I need an attorney to help me with investments.

392
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:31,380
About 20 billion won. ($18 million)

393
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:34,930
That's just the first round.

394
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:49,560
You don't have money.  What are you doing here?

395
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:58,310
First, you're not from Jeolla Province.

396
00:31:58,310 --> 00:32:00,240
Your wristwatch is also a knock-off.

397
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:05,060
Your shoes are expensive, but you walked here.

398
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:10,520
I am incredible at sniffing out money.

399
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:13,670
But your smell

400
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:17,440
is of desperation to look as if you have money.

401
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:20,550
Who are you? Why did you come here?

402
00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:30,950
You will work here for two months, and after a meeting with the partners,

403
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:33,850
junior attorneys who will work with Attorney Nam Wu Cheon

404
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:37,100
will be selected in the end.

405
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:55,670
I'm sorry, but I lost my name tag.

406
00:32:55,670 --> 00:32:57,510
Can't you help me, just this once?

407
00:32:57,510 --> 00:32:59,640
Hold on.

408
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:07,690
Hey, excuse me?

409
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:10,180
Oh, I had dropped it here.

410
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:11,320
I can go in now, right?

411
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,310
Yes.

412
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:20,220
 Attorney Nam Wu Cheon

413
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:29,950
There is a passcode.

414
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:32,280
Let's talk at the police station.

415
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:34,050
You, you can't do it now.

416
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,790
I wanted to meet you.

417
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:40,520
You wanted to meet me? Why?

418
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:45,090
Nam Wu Cheon's birthday is March 4th, 1973.

419
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:46,010
Didn't work.

420
00:33:46,050 --> 00:33:49,050
 His student ID is 95240018.

421
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:52,110
That didn't work either.

422
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:55,520
His military ID is 9471 020101.

423
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,660
 - Nope.  
 - His wedding anniversary is

424
00:33:57,750 --> 00:33:59,950
November 30th, 1999.

425
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:03,050
Nope.

426
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:08,550
October 10th, 2002. That's his divorce anniversary.

427
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:11,830
No.

428
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:18,100
Wait, hold on!

429
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:20,570
What are you doing right now?

430
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:24,910
This is a workplace.

431
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:28,470
This is foul play.

432
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:33,120
Yes, you are my type.

433
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:35,210
Do you need spending money?

434
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:37,630
You're looking for a sponsor, right?

435
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:42,420
This guy, really...

436
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:43,800
Hurry.

437
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:46,460
Hold on for a bit.

438
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:50,850
Didn't we see each other at that bar?

439
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:55,640
No, you are my role model, Attorney,

440
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:58,340
and I respect you... and...

441
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:04,540
If I misunderstood you, I apologize.

442
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:08,030
I would prefer that you forget about my sexual orientation.

443
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:09,810
 Ji Wan, you can't let him go yet.

444
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:11,850
Hold on.

445
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:28,850
I don't think I can.

446
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:35,610
Yes, I know that it's hard to acknowledge it at first.

447
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:39,740
When you've accepted it, come see me then.

448
00:35:56,300 --> 00:36:00,810
When is Son Min Ho's birthday? Find out.

449
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:05,750
December 14th, 1959.

450
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:10,230
That worked.

451
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:14,730
It worked!

452
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:38,140
It worked, it worked.

453
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,880
Attorney.

454
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:02,200
Assemblyman Im has been waiting since a while ago.

455
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,060
Alright.

456
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:21,190
We are presuming that the office where search and seizure was done is where the therapy occurred.

457
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:23,070
What do you think of it?

458
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:25,250
It definitely seems like a therapist's office.

459
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:30,530
But as you know, using hypnosis to induce suicide

460
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:32,050
is near impossible.

461
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:38,050
Is this lucid dream treatment?

462
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:39,230
Lucid dream?

463
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:40,910
There are trends, even in psychology.

464
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:45,350
These days, dreams still occupy the throne in the brain.

465
00:37:46,450 --> 00:37:48,160
Dreams.

466
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:56,800
If you read this dissertation, it will help you understand.

467
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,700
The human body is capable of doing more than people's imagination.

468
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:04,160
With enough stimulation, the expected result is certain to happen.

469
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:09,150
For example, regular people have their first dream one and a half hour after they've fallen asleep.

470
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:17,070
But those who are suffering from depression, they begin dreaming even before half of that time passes.

471
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:20,340
If you can modify that cycle, the depression can be significantly improved.

472
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:22,140
I think I've seen that in a dissertation.

473
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:26,120
Lucid dream is a treatment that is one step ahead of that.

474
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:28,550
Threat, manifestation, hypothesis.

475
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:33,490
For example, causing an exam student to continue to dream about taking the exam.

476
00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:36,250
That will decrease his anxiety on the day of the actual exam.

477
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:40,750
To put it simply, developing immunity by causing someone to dream the same dream repeatedly.

478
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:43,180
Repeatedly...

479
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:46,140
 How are people who enjoy extreme sports?

480
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:49,100
 They even jump off cliffs that are more than 100 meters high.

481
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:53,500
 Or they use just one oxygen tank to dive deep into the ocean.

482
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:54,530
 To make that possibleâ€”

483
00:38:54,530 --> 00:38:56,570
 Requires repeated practice.

484
00:38:56,570 --> 00:38:59,080
 Repeating the same action many times

485
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:01,670
 to know how far they can go.

486
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:08,280
But lucid dream treatment isn't always effective.

487
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:13,500
If you believe that you were having a lucid dream, however if that moment wasn't a dream but reality,

488
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:15,250
then that will be a big problem.

489
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:19,840
It sounds like a sci-fi movie, but if there really is someone who can blur the boundary

490
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:22,940
between dream and reality,

491
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:26,450
I'd love to meet that person. He is sure to be amazing.

492
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:35,900
Where are you going?

493
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:38,000
I'll go meet Lee Ji Wuk and return right away.

494
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,610
I have something I have to know,

495
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:41,750
and he's given us useful information before.

496
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:43,750
He won't be able to ignore me.

497
00:39:43,850 --> 00:39:45,450
So I'll be back soon.

498
00:39:52,850 --> 00:39:55,170
We should go, too.

499
00:39:55,170 --> 00:39:57,910
Let's all keep our guards up until the time of the incident.

500
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:10,050
You've come?

501
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:14,360
I can order expensive food, right?

502
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:17,200
Sounds good, since you are paying.

503
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,650
If I buy food for a civil service worker, it becomes a bribe.

504
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,370
You drink well, right?

505
00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:23,600
I'm on duty, so I don't drink.

506
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:26,920
What? You're speaking casually to me, too.

507
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:29,740
You can drop the formalities. But you do drink, right?

508
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:32,160
I can even cuss.

509
00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:36,950
Indeed, you are better than your Team Leader.

510
00:40:38,450 --> 00:40:42,950
I'm going to tell you something important about him, so if you are not curious, you can get lost now.

511
00:40:49,850 --> 00:40:52,150
There, there, finally,

512
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:56,440
we can look into Son Min Ho's home.

513
00:40:56,450 --> 00:40:57,550
Ta-da.

514
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:07,080
There is about 5 hours left until the incident time, so let's each prepare to endure.

515
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:09,600
Not a great time, it's time we'd feel sleepy.

516
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,780
Then you should sleep.

517
00:41:11,410 --> 00:41:13,160
Dozing off then would be the worst.

518
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:14,950
Actually, I should sleep in that case.

519
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:18,490
I've confirmed with my own eyes that you can go without sleeping one night.

520
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:20,250
You were quite strong, so why?

521
00:41:28,290 --> 00:41:30,440
I'm tired now.

522
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:34,600
I better call home to tell them I'll be out all night.

523
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,480
Are your parents visiting?

524
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,730
You live alone.

525
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:42,840
Did I?

526
00:41:56,170 --> 00:41:58,410
What is with this mood?

527
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:01,210
Since no one feels like sleeping,

528
00:42:01,210 --> 00:42:02,920
maybe we should eat something.

529
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:05,240
I'll go get the food.

530
00:42:32,470 --> 00:42:35,270
 010 635 2258

531
00:42:38,070 --> 00:42:40,610
Missing something...

532
00:42:40,610 --> 00:42:43,150
I'm missing something.

533
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:46,650
What am I missing?

534
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:08,180
Misdirection?

535
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:10,680
He sure eats a lot of lollipops.

536
00:43:13,950 --> 00:43:16,380
Is this that good?

537
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,140
Oh my gosh, what?

538
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:34,140
Please look at the your screens.

539
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:41,480
Hey. We already hacked into his home.

540
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:43,510
So instead of all of us just standing by and watching

541
00:43:43,510 --> 00:43:47,190
how about we separate into two teams and one team tries to invade the private property?

542
00:43:47,190 --> 00:43:49,640
Guarding from nearby doesn't seem like a bad idea.

543
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:51,310
We should ask Team Leader when he returnsâ€”

544
00:43:51,310 --> 00:43:53,850
I just want to be with Team Leader alone, just us two.

545
00:43:53,850 --> 00:43:55,550
Indeed, you are American Styleâ€”

546
00:44:42,450 --> 00:44:44,750
They didn't say it would rain today.

547
00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:47,080
Excuse me, do you have umbrellas?

548
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:03,980
Welcome.

549
00:45:07,910 --> 00:45:10,890
When things are chaotic inside and outside, like these days,

550
00:45:10,950 --> 00:45:14,150
we must hold onto our "mental," as today's kids say.

551
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:18,310
Is Mr. Son so scared that he can't even join us here?

552
00:45:18,310 --> 00:45:21,170
He is a very careful man, after all.

553
00:45:21,170 --> 00:45:22,770
"Too much is as bad as too little."

554
00:45:22,770 --> 00:45:27,410
He could get caught due to his excessive caution.

555
00:45:27,410 --> 00:45:31,860
The public opinion isn't great these days, and Mr. Son should inform us properly of the progress.

556
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:34,870
- Before, at the villageâ€” 
 - Shhh.

557
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:41,110
CEO Jang, you will help us with the public opinion.

558
00:45:41,110 --> 00:45:43,060
Well, I'm not the only one with a portal site company.

559
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:48,210
If they say there is no one who doesn't look at MODU's page at least once per day, that is more than power.

560
00:45:48,210 --> 00:45:50,550
You're really giving us a lot of help.

561
00:45:50,550 --> 00:45:54,220
Who knew that this thing called 'internet' would become such a wicked thing one day?

562
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:55,990
Who imagined that?

563
00:45:55,990 --> 00:45:59,020
If anyone said that the whole world was inside a computer, that guy would be called crazy.

564
00:45:59,050 --> 00:46:02,450
Not the internet, we discovered that the finger is the wicked thing.

565
00:46:07,470 --> 00:46:09,620
This thing, right here.

566
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:15,280
- Right.
 - The problem is what you are pointing at.

567
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:19,160
Indeed, nothing is better than the internet at instigating thoughtless people.

568
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:22,990
At first, they will look at where the finger is pointing,

569
00:46:22,990 --> 00:46:26,840
but once they realize that nothing is there, don't they turn their gaze away soon?

570
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:29,280
No, there could be nothing.

571
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:32,380
Usually, they don't even think to take their eyes off it.

572
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:36,170
Even if nothing was there, "maybe something is there..."

573
00:46:36,170 --> 00:46:38,210
"maybe I'm the only one who doesn't see it..."

574
00:46:38,250 --> 00:46:41,250
and feeling it out, that is what humans do.

575
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:48,300
These days, whenever anything happens, the kids first look at the comments.

576
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:52,380
What are other people thinking? Then they believe that those thoughts are their own.

577
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:54,470
Ah, you startled me.

578
00:46:54,470 --> 00:46:56,200
So this is what we say in our industry.

579
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:59,590
The first few comments determine everything.

580
00:46:59,590 --> 00:47:03,420
There are people who don't behave that way, but there are much fewer of them.

581
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:05,980
Variables that you can't calculate, perhaps?

582
00:47:36,550 --> 00:47:39,150
- Just letting you knowâ€” 
 - Yes, I am drunk.

583
00:47:39,150 --> 00:47:42,170
I don't know what you're about to tell me about Team Leader that I can't hear when I'm sober.

584
00:47:42,170 --> 00:47:45,520
But it's not as if I don't know that he's strange and weird.

585
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:48,130
If you tell me what I already know, you will not get away with it.

586
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:54,250
They don't have the beer that I like.

587
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:58,450
- Because I made things this way.
 - Because

588
00:48:58,450 --> 00:49:01,280
I made things this way.

589
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:13,350
 I am alone in a street with no one around.

590
00:49:13,350 --> 00:49:15,700
 The sun is shining whitely

591
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:20,400
 The clock which is never wrong indicates it is midnight.

592
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:26,650
 I wonder now whether it is daytime or night?

593
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:37,490
What's wrong? Are you alright, Dr. Leighton?

594
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:47,840
Because I made things this way...

595
00:50:03,410 --> 00:50:04,530
It doesn't work.

596
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:06,960
Again, he is not wrong.

597
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:11,570
 So someone who drowned in a shallow pool, he committed suicide?

598
00:50:11,570 --> 00:50:16,810
 That means you can drown yourself in a bowl of water.

599
00:50:16,810 --> 00:50:17,980
 Can't you?

600
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:20,270
 No, try it.

601
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:24,170
I tried it, and it didn't work. He really does know everything.

602
00:50:35,140 --> 00:50:36,880
I'm starting to get annoyed

603
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:39,380
so if you have something to give me, give it to me and get lost.

604
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:42,960
Five, four,

605
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:44,220
three,

606
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:46,070
two...

607
00:50:47,190 --> 00:50:47,980
You told me to get lost.

608
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:50,130
I came here during an investigation.

609
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:52,530
Important information related to this case,

610
00:50:52,530 --> 00:50:56,390
that also involved Team Leader, give it to me now.

611
00:50:58,950 --> 00:51:00,850
I like you.

612
00:51:00,850 --> 00:51:02,540
I don't like you.

613
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:04,230
Give me the information.

614
00:51:04,230 --> 00:51:05,860
Next time.

615
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:11,770
But I think what I will

616
00:51:11,770 --> 00:51:14,600
give you will be fun.

617
00:51:18,490 --> 00:51:21,640
 Team Leader Do Jeong Wu

618
00:51:51,370 --> 00:51:52,310
I'm on my way now.

619
00:51:52,310 --> 00:51:55,020
You said you were very drunk a while ago.

620
00:51:55,020 --> 00:51:56,340
Do you drink during work these days?

621
00:51:56,340 --> 00:51:59,400
I acted drunk because he said he wouldn't give me information unless I was, that's all.

622
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:00,690
 Your acting has improved.

623
00:52:00,690 --> 00:52:03,470
Didn't I look totally alert and sober?

624
00:52:03,470 --> 00:52:06,090
That's what Lee Ji Wuk said.

625
00:52:06,090 --> 00:52:07,370
So where are you now?

626
00:52:07,370 --> 00:52:08,930
I'm returning, I told you.

627
00:52:08,950 --> 00:52:10,150
Alright, that's fine.

628
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:15,220
That's fine? What is fine?

629
00:52:15,220 --> 00:52:17,670
I just have to return, that's all?

630
00:52:17,750 --> 00:52:20,750
Whether I got the information or not, he doesn't care at all.

631
00:52:38,490 --> 00:52:40,670
Are you awake now?

632
00:52:42,390 --> 00:52:44,420
The rain stopped.

633
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:46,350
You should eat something.

634
00:52:46,350 --> 00:52:48,780
People should eat well and sleep well, otherwise they have bad dreams.

635
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:50,820
You've been working hard.

636
00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:52,650
Why look so intently?

637
00:52:52,650 --> 00:52:55,700
After all, we can't go in there.

638
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:58,590
Well, nothing bad about being thorough.

639
00:53:00,550 --> 00:53:01,560
Won't you ask me anything?

640
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:05,850
You should have let Lieutenants Yoon and Jang eat something, they must be very hungry.

641
00:53:05,850 --> 00:53:08,370
That isn't a question.

642
00:53:12,750 --> 00:53:15,660
Has that ever happened in the U.S.?

643
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:18,530
No.

644
00:53:18,530 --> 00:53:21,050
Once in a while, there were times when my memories overflowed,

645
00:53:21,890 --> 00:53:23,810
but this got worse once I returned to Korea.

646
00:53:23,850 --> 00:53:24,750
Why?

647
00:53:26,050 --> 00:53:27,850
I think it's because of you.

648
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:34,480
You keep antagonizing me

649
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:36,060
and making me tense up.

650
00:53:36,060 --> 00:53:38,840
When you know that I have OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder).

651
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:46,810
And no matter how much I think about it, you are hiding something.

652
00:53:49,290 --> 00:53:52,310
The painful monster that you managed to barely forget,

653
00:53:52,310 --> 00:53:53,420
is there

654
00:53:54,490 --> 00:53:57,150
a reason to recall it?

655
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:34,130
Can I go to the restroom?

656
00:54:34,130 --> 00:54:38,200
It should take about three minutes.

657
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:49,410
Team Leader, I caught you.

658
00:54:49,410 --> 00:54:50,800
Caught for what?

659
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:52,370
You like me, right?

660
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:58,980
I was with Lee Ji Wuk

661
00:54:58,980 --> 00:55:01,970
and you called because you were concerned that I was drunk.

662
00:55:19,380 --> 00:55:22,640
There are only 12 minutes left until the incident time.

663
00:55:38,030 --> 00:55:41,000
That took three minutes and three seconds.

664
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:08,590
So how are things at the villa?

665
00:56:08,590 --> 00:56:10,590
It's quiet.

666
00:56:10,590 --> 00:56:11,950
It doesn't seem as if anything is happening.

667
00:56:11,950 --> 00:56:13,060
Should we go in?

668
00:56:13,060 --> 00:56:15,230
 No, not yet.

669
00:56:19,530 --> 00:56:21,720
I'll be going to the site, too.

670
00:56:31,410 --> 00:56:32,950
There is no way the time will be exact.

671
00:56:32,950 --> 00:56:36,870
Let's give or take 10 seconds.

672
00:57:01,290 --> 00:57:02,310
 Incident time: 3 minutes left

673
00:57:38,860 --> 00:57:40,900
 Incident time: 00:00:00

674
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:43,400
 Past incident time

675
00:58:07,940 --> 00:58:11,050
We don't see anything particularâ€”

676
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:14,040
What is that?

677
00:58:42,630 --> 00:58:45,720
 Lieutenant Gong

678
00:59:26,950 --> 00:59:27,840
 Biographical Information: Jamie Leighton

679
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:30,430
Hurry, hurry...

680
00:59:30,430 --> 00:59:32,050
Put the camera here.

681
00:59:32,050 --> 00:59:33,910
Hurry, hurry.

682
00:59:33,910 --> 00:59:37,470
Hurry and install that, there.

683
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:43,380
You must move it carefully.

684
00:59:43,380 --> 00:59:47,600
- Hurry and call 119 and also call the local police station.
 - Yes.

685
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:49,810
Exclusive news from XVN.

686
00:59:49,810 --> 00:59:53,940
There is a fire at Gyeonggi Province, Yangwu City, Samwonho-dong, Unit 41.

687
00:59:53,940 --> 00:59:58,820
 The resident is Mr. Son Min Ho, a man in his 60s. In the early 1990s, he is the key figure of

688
00:59:58,820 --> 01:00:01,310
 the news that shook up all of Korea, the White Night Village incident.

689
01:00:01,310 --> 01:00:04,440
 The White Night Village project which was a public support project by the government

690
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:08,170
 Seonrinsu and Seorinndan were called cure-all medicines

691
01:00:08,170 --> 01:00:12,140
 and they were sold endlessly for a time, as if they had wings.

692
01:00:12,140 --> 01:00:15,330
 But everything collapsed in one day, causing great shock.

693
01:00:15,330 --> 01:00:16,170
 From this processâ€”

694
01:00:16,170 --> 01:00:20,430
How did he find those photos so quickly? Huh?

695
01:00:20,430 --> 01:00:23,880
 ... what is important is that no one was ever found responsible for this incident.

696
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:26,360
 And Son Min Ho is the key figure.

697
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:31,290
The reason that we journalists were able to be here beforehand is due to having received a forewarning notice.

698
01:00:31,290 --> 01:00:33,810
Mr. Son Min Ho who suffered no legal penalties 28 years ago,

699
01:00:33,810 --> 01:00:37,580
 we were able to confirm that he was the next target of these serial killings.

700
01:00:37,580 --> 01:00:39,650
 Did the police think the same?

701
01:00:39,650 --> 01:00:43,320
 Now is the moment we look forward to the actions of the police.

702
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:53,640
Hyeong, fire trucks, ambulances, and police cars,

703
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:57,430
they are blocked by cars that are parked down there, and they cannot come up here.

704
01:00:57,430 --> 01:00:58,990
Please go in now, go in now.

705
01:00:58,990 --> 01:01:00,290
Please go in now, please go in now.

706
01:01:00,290 --> 01:01:01,450
Call that car owner and tell him to move his car.

707
01:01:01,450 --> 01:01:04,670
Oh, I'm really going crazy. Seriously.

708
01:01:05,730 --> 01:01:08,850
You can't mess with the power of the public.

709
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:11,450
Strap on a camera and go down.

710
01:01:11,450 --> 01:01:13,810
Go film the civil service workers being incompetent.

711
01:01:13,810 --> 01:01:15,000
How will you be alone here without meâ€”

712
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,880
Go! I will take care of things here.

713
01:01:33,390 --> 01:01:36,280
- He came.
 - Find Lieutenant Gong, Lieutenant Gong.

714
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:38,160
Lieutenant Gong...

715
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:39,980
But the fire trucks...

716
01:01:39,980 --> 01:01:42,330
The fire trucks can't come up here, so find Lieutenant Gong.

717
01:01:42,330 --> 01:01:44,850
There is someone upstairs, over there.

718
01:01:44,850 --> 01:01:45,800
What do we do?

719
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:48,050
Over there, over there.

720
01:02:10,530 --> 01:02:12,350
Chairman.

721
01:02:12,350 --> 01:02:15,940
Chairman! Chairman!

722
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:19,210
Chairman! Chairman!

723
01:02:26,410 --> 01:02:28,210
Chairman...

724
01:02:31,310 --> 01:02:32,470
 Your network is unstable. Try again in a short while.

725
01:02:32,470 --> 01:02:34,470
Chairman!

726
01:02:34,470 --> 01:02:40,280
Chairman! What do we do? Come to your senses, please.

727
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:56,000
Why isn't the fire truck coming?

728
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:02,770
Doctor? Doctor,, Lieutenant Gong.

729
01:03:02,770 --> 01:03:04,270
I am going to find her.

730
01:03:04,270 --> 01:03:06,170
Are you crazy?

731
01:03:06,170 --> 01:03:08,480
Camera. Turn on the camera.

732
01:03:11,240 --> 01:03:15,230
Lieutenant Gong?  Find Lieutenant Gong.

733
01:03:17,380 --> 01:03:21,500
Yes, someone just ran inside into that fire burning so hot right now.

734
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:25,600
 It happened so quickly that no one could stop him.

735
01:05:16,820 --> 01:05:18,670
 Phone

736
01:05:18,670 --> 01:05:22,070
 Team Leader Do Jeong Wu

737
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:34,330
Why isn't the fire truck coming?

738
01:05:37,050 --> 01:05:39,640
Why isn't it coming?

739
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:42,050
What will those people in there do?

740
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:46,580
What do I do?

741
01:05:46,580 --> 01:05:50,350
The fire is spreading so rapidly that it's not possible to estimate the size of the damage right now.

742
01:05:50,350 --> 01:05:53,190
This is when quick response is required

743
01:05:53,190 --> 01:05:55,920
but the fire truck hasn't come yetâ€”

744
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:57,670
 What is going on?

745
01:05:57,670 --> 01:06:01,090
Why isn't the police car coming? What about the fire truck?

746
01:06:01,850 --> 01:06:04,010
Maybe what you need first is the ambulance?

747
01:06:04,010 --> 01:06:06,800
Team Leader? Where is Team Leader?

748
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:10,080
Do Jeong Wu? He just went in there.

749
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:12,020
Alone.

750
01:06:45,210 --> 01:06:48,000
 Before I realized what had happened

751
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,590
 my heart stopped.

752
01:06:55,800 --> 01:07:02,830

753
01:07:04,210 --> 01:07:09,080
â™«  I wished it was a dream  â™«

754
01:07:16,710 --> 01:07:19,550
 Awaken

755
01:07:19,550 --> 01:07:23,250
 No matter what a psycho Do Jeong Wu is, he's not someone who will run into a fire without any reason.

756
01:07:23,250 --> 01:07:25,080
 The police suspect that this incident is arson.

757
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:26,940
 What is the victim's specific information?

758
01:07:26,940 --> 01:07:28,530
 He says he doesn't have self-preservation instincts.

759
01:07:28,530 --> 01:07:30,060
 He committed arson instead of suicide.

760
01:07:30,060 --> 01:07:32,440
 The person who planned all these incidents for revenge.

761
01:07:32,440 --> 01:07:34,050
 Dissociative Identity Disorder.

762
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:36,210
 Dissociative Identity Disorder? That is multiple personality disorder.

763
01:07:36,210 --> 01:07:40,310
 Can someone I thought I knew well actually be a completely different person?

764
01:07:40,310 --> 01:07:41,520
 You trust Do Jeong Wu that much?

765
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:43,880
 A person can never truly know another person.

766
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:46,460
 Staff Captain Do Jeong Wu knew everything all along.
