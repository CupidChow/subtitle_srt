1
00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:08,990

2
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:38,090
 Awaken

3
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:50,590
You shouldn't treat him like an object after using him as your hands and feet all of his life.

4
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:54,520
I am not treating him like an object. Just retrieving my test subject.

5
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,610
That's very nice and all,

6
00:00:57,610 --> 00:01:02,050
but what is such a high-ranking person doing in such a dark and remote place? And just you two?

7
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:04,410
What if something happens to you?

8
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:06,270
Are you worrying for my sake now?

9
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:09,660
I'm not worrying. It was just tough to come all this way.

10
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:14,530
And I already worked so hard looking for His Excellency. So I was annoyed.

11
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:18,670
So, after all that work, did you find His Excellency?

12
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:20,690
I did.

13
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:26,830
You are right in front of me, Your Excellency.

14
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:34,080
- So who is the owner of White Night Foundation?
 - His Excellency.

15
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,460
Ji Won Geun? He is still alive?

16
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:41,990
I have heard that there is a secret laboratory.

17
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:45,540
Even Son Min Ho didn't seem to have personally met His Excellency.

18
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,850
Ji Won Geun has officially retired, but no trace of him can be found anywhere.

19
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:54,340
Someone who exerts his influence everywhere, but does not actually exist.

20
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:57,550
 I definitely saw people who succeeded in this experiment.

21
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:00,330
He definitely said "people."

22
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:04,350
So that means there isn't just one person for whom the experiment was successful.

23
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,500
I saw Dr. Jo Hyeon Hui with my own eyes.

24
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:14,410
So if there was another, that would be you.

25
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:17,520
Isn't that too much of a logical leap?

26
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,500
Why is it that among those many White Night Foundation members who actually wielded power

27
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:26,720
I have no record of you preceding the White Night Village disaster?

28
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,630
Why would that be?

29
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:37,290
If Ji Won Geun is living as Oh Jeong Hwan

30
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:40,110
then all that would make sense, wouldn't it?

31
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,550
You've surrounded your home with armed guards.

32
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:49,200
But why would you have driven yourself all this way to such a dangerous place? You must have so much to hide.

33
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,930
The Chief of Staff of the Blue House...

34
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:56,300
ah, wait, that's not right, is it?

35
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,870
I mean, His Excellency, Ji Won Geun?

36
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,090
What are you doing? Why won't you grab him?

37
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:19,430
How dare you do this to me?

38
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,360
- Please take out the medicine for me.
 - What medicine?

39
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,000
A sedative.

40
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,200
It's in my inside pocket.

41
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,060
Endure it.

42
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:06,270
What are you doing right now?

43
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:08,640
I found the formula.

44
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,240
What are you saying?

45
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,480
Look here.

46
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:26,630
- How... where...?
 - I made a deal with Do Jeong Wu.

47
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:29,040
A deal?

48
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:34,230
If this formula is real, does it matter if he knows where the secret laboratory is?

49
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:46,690
You had talent that I did not expect.

50
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:02,880
So you gave the injection to Son Min Ho.

51
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:16,090
- What are you doing?
 - I am giving you the injection of the medicine that all have  wanted for so long.

52
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:21,150
If this is successful, you can enjoy eternal life.

53
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:24,100
You're using me now as an experimental subject? Won't you untie me right now?

54
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,840
Untie this, untie this.

55
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,830
How many mLs did you administer?

56
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:30,210
- 5 mL.
 - Give him 3 mL more.

57
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:34,050
Hey, Gong Il Do. Gong Il Do, you bastard!

58
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:38,740
I helped you so much. You ungrateful bastard.

59
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,500
No, no, don't do it. Don't do it.

60
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,510
No, no, don't do it, Gong Il Do.

61
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:48,710
Gong Il Do... Gong Il Do... Gong Il Do...

62
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,920
Do Jeong Wu's formula was fake.

63
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:18,590
No. The formula is probably real.

64
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,320
Isn't he Oh Jeong Hwan, the Chief of Staff of the President?

65
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:39,690
Yes. But he is also Ji Won Geun, and His Excellency.

66
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:42,870
- Old Man, you stay out of this.
 - Yes, yes.

67
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,820
Okay, I got it.

68
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,510
Looks like I found your entry pass.

69
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:13,060
What is this medicine? The sedative you spoke about before?

70
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,410
If you misspeak, never mind eternal life.

71
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:25,800
You could die right here, right now.

72
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:35,250
Son Min Ho died.

73
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:39,310
What? So the formula is fake?

74
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:42,050
The formula is real.

75
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:47,550
What I need is the blood of my son, Do Jeong Wu.

76
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,210
His Excellency?

77
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:59,970
Alright, Dr. Jo. I'm dealing with something urgent right now, so let's talk later.

78
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:04,880
What is going on?

79
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,840
I think something happened to His Excellency.

80
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:14,830
She said she needs my blood. I have to know where the secret laboratory is.

81
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:17,300
So how about telling me now?

82
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,710
Alright, then.

83
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:28,090
Medicine!

84
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,660
Give me the medicine.

85
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:34,520
This?

86
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,950
Is this some important medicine?

87
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:46,630
Right, you took this medicine before, that time.

88
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:49,660
I don't think it's a sedative. So what is it?

89
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:51,630
So what medicine is this?

90
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:09,060
Side effects. It's a medicine that stops side effects.

91
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:13,560
The formula wasn't perfect, so of course, there would be side effects.

92
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,500
- When do you need this medicine?
 - Every six hours.

93
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,500
That is more frequent than I thought. And if you don't take it?

94
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,000
I guess I'll get old and die.

95
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:29,920
You sacrificed all those many children to make this medicine?

96
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:35,690
So you can try to live forever?

97
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:55,010
Look here, I have claustrophobia.

98
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:58,700
I will suffer breathing difficulties like this. Please open a window at least.

99
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:11,720
How are you feeling?

100
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,660
Actually, I think I'm cured.

101
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:21,710
It's a medicine for reducing the side effects of the experiments, so there shouldn't be any big problems.

102
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:28,720
Oh, you've woken up?

103
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:34,550
Who... ?

104
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:38,990
Oh, greet him. He's from White Night Village, too.

105
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:42,640
I'm Number 157.

106
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,600
I'm Number 99.

107
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:49,190
I'm Number 113.

108
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:27,430
Mom.

109
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:30,340
Yes, it's Mom.

110
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:33,620
You grew up well, my daughter.

111
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:39,050
How... do you look the same?

112
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:47,450
Yes, I must look the same as I do in your memories from when you were young.

113
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:51,330
What on earth are you planning?

114
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:57,060
After so many were sacrificed in White Night Village, why haven't you yet abandoned this dream?

115
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:02,950
You've been very curious, weren't you?

116
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:11,560
A dream is meant to be realized.

117
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:41,320
Six hours passed so quickly.

118
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,080
It's almost time for your medicine.

119
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:55,880
 Text message

120
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:20,680
- My son?
 - Where is Dr. Jamie?

121
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:24,320
Are you worried that I hurt my own daughter?

122
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,380
You're still calling us your son and daughter? You sure speak nonsense well.

123
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:31,080
No matter what, you should mind your manners with your mom.

124
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:34,750
Stop saying useless things and return Dr. Jamie immediately. If you don't—

125
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:38,640
If I don't? Then what?

126
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:40,540
His Excellency is here, and he won't be safe.

127
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:47,880
His Excellency should know well what is needed.

128
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:59,390
Did you hear that? I think it's really time for us to go to the secret laboratory.

129
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:14,290
How about using Dr. Jamie's blood for the experiment. They are twins.

130
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,760
Fraternal twins are useless.

131
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:21,530
It has to be Do Jeong Wu's blood.

132
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:30,930
From the beginning, I think he made the formula based on giving his own blood.

133
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:34,000
He made it so that if his own blood is not used,

134
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,440
the experiment will fail.

135
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:43,990
Do Jeong Wu is a part of the formula, after all.

136
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:53,000
This is the place.

137
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:59,500
 Eight Provinces Employment Agency

138
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:02,920
- I'm here.
 - Oh, you're here?

139
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,870
Oh, that Ahjussi from Yeonsi-dong.

140
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:08,330
- Ah, hello.
 - It's been a while.

141
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:10,020
Yes.

142
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:13,560
You had a guest.

143
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:22,260
- The third...
 - Oh, it's the third child.

144
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:26,670
It's alright. He's not the same guy anymore. Where is Staff Captain?

145
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:31,760
Staff Captain.

146
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,500
It's been a while. Nice to see you.

147
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,110
Yes, loyalty.

148
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:41,680
This vibe is awkward, huh?

149
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:45,630
She wouldn't do anything to Dr. Jamie, would she? She is her daughter, after all.

150
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:49,620
She isn't someone who acts like a mom. But until she gets my blood, she probably won't do anything.

151
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:52,900
- What will you do now?
 - We have to go to the secret laboratory.

152
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:57,240
But even if Chief of Staff Oh Jeong Hwan is Ji Won Geun,

153
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:02,150
- isn't this illegal abduction and imprisonment? 
 - Hey!

154
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:05,150
At times like this, you are really smart, Lieutenant Jang Ji Wan.

155
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:07,340
How did you know? Yes, this is illegal.

156
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,230
So the police should stay out of it now.

157
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:11,850
What are you saying, after all this time?

158
00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:16,280
These guys will not stop for anything to achieve their goals. They are too dangerous.

159
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:20,510
And by helping me, a wanted criminal, you may have to resign from the force, so—

160
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:22,620
You don't mean that.

161
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:26,700
We will help you. Dr. Jamie is our team member, too, we should rescue her.

162
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,540
Yes, let's do this together.

163
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:30,810
I can't deal with you acting cool by doing it alone.

164
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:32,860
Was I cool?

165
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:37,790
It's all ready now.

166
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:43,700
But is this the right way? What if it goes wrong?

167
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:48,420
Well, if things go wrong, for me who doesn't even know his birth date, at least you will know my death date.

168
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:52,060
Oh, stop saying such unlucky things.

169
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,830
Let's do it together.

170
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,380
You, too? You don't have to.

171
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:03,820
It involves me, too.

172
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:07,770
And it involves me, too.

173
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:10,090
Yes, it involves us, too.

174
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:19,650
You said we're going to get a scoop that broadcast stations couldn't even dream of. So when?

175
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:22,520
We keep digging and we get nothing. Anyway—

176
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,300
What did you say?

177
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:28,420
That I want an Iced Americano.

178
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:34,990
- Who is it?
 - A delivery.

179
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:39,090
- Wait, is this another forewarning murder notice?
 - Give it to me.

180
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:49,460
What is this?

181
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:53,050
 I thought there would be something Reporter Lee Ji Wuk is best at doing.

182
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:55,400
  108 21 Road, Wonsa Street, Siwon City, Gyeonggi Province

183
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:57,490
Do Jeong Wu.

184
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:59,090
Is this the place?

185
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:44,700
Even Dr. Jamie is being held hostage at that secret laboratory or whatever?

186
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:51,490
Yes. So Staff Captain Do and the other members of the special team just went to the secret laboratory.

187
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:54,690
These bastards! Without even reporting to me?

188
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:03,030
Oh, what do we do now?

189
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,760
What do you mean, what do we do?

190
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,750
Right?

191
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,030
Let's go.

192
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:20,570
Pack your equipment and prepare for dispatch. Prepare the SWAT team, too.

193
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:22,970
Listen well. We are police officers of the Republic of Korea.

194
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:25,980
Let's properly show them what justice is.

195
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:28,450
- Move!
 - Yes, sir.

196
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:48,870
 Entry Pass

197
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:13,340
Hye Won. How did you get here?

198
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:15,260
Dad.

199
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,160
My son, you did well.

200
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:24,590
You found your way here.

201
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:31,230
So this is the secret laboratory? Where is Dr. Jamie?

202
00:22:58,370 --> 00:23:03,790
I think you will want to give me your blood now.

203
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:07,250
So you just have to go this far, don't you?

204
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:12,310
If you just give me your blood, everything will be resolved.

205
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:16,280
- What about the children?
 - I just have to finish making this medicine.

206
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,830
I am not interested in anything else.

207
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:27,770
Don't worry about me.

208
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:44,200
Commissioner of the National Police Agency Kim Chang Gu and Mayor of Seoul Im Jin Gwon are all members of the White Night Foundation?

209
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:47,190
They've really invaded all the major leaders of society, into every corner.

210
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:50,700
I didn't know it was this bad.

211
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,920
Siwon City, Wonsa Street.

212
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:55,560
- Where are you going?
 - You use this material to prepare for broadcast.

213
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:58,430
I'll call you when I get there.

214
00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:00,040
What the heck is going on?

215
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,680
This is the exclusive scoop.

216
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:09,620
How long will it take for the medicine to be completed?

217
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:11,550
We have to extract the serum from the blood

218
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:15,780
and wait for it to react with the medicine we've already prepared.

219
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:18,890
So it shouldn't take too long.

220
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:22,670
I've lived for 38 years waiting for this day.

221
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,600
- There is no time, so hurry.
 - Yes, you will need to hurry.

222
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,740
Our Excellency doesn't have much medicine left.

223
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:40,590
- Where is my medicine?
 - Medicine?

224
00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:43,550
Ah, here... here...

225
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:48,940
- I left it in the car.
 - You crazy bastard.

226
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:52,650
No. You must not. Please.

227
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:13,320
 When we get into the secret laboratory, look for a chance and put this in the computer.

228
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:18,060
 After that, these two will know what to do.

229
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,860
 SERVER CONNECTING

230
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:24,480
We're in.

231
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:32,660
 You must have noticed this, but I'm sure there is more than one secret laboratory.

232
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:37,100
 There is no way that they would store all the data they've gathered for decades in one location.

233
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:38,860
 Network?

234
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:42,960
 Yes, network. There is a high possibility that it's being shared over a network.

235
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,620
 To erase such a large amount of data

236
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:48,620
 you would have to hack into the server and pull it out by the roots.

237
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:52,170
 It's the thing I am best at doing.

238
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:55,390
 Me too. I'll help him.

239
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:59,660
 Once you delete all the data in the server, you can activate the timer.

240
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:02,360
 Since it will be done remotely from another location, it cannot be stopped.

241
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:08,250
 The time we have is five minutes. We have to get out within five minutes, no matter what.

242
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:22,170
Ah, sorry. This is as far as my memory goes, what can I do?

243
00:26:42,290 --> 00:26:46,450
- Is this the place?
 - Yes, this is the location that Chief of Staff Oh Jeong Hwan spoke of.

244
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:51,860
Hey!  Hey! This is a crime site! What is this bastard doing?

245
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:54,820
It would be sad if I was left out of this. Please wait and see.

246
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:57,820
They say even dog poop can be used as medicine.

247
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:03,370
That bastard. How did he know to come here?

248
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:07,220
- Did you leak it to him?
 - No.

249
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:12,240
Everyone standby until we find out what the situation is.

250
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:23,650
 PROCESSING CODE
 DECIPHERING CODE

251
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:29,100
 NETWORK CONNECTING

252
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,450
I did it.

253
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:35,020
Okay. Now the only thing we have left to do is to erase all the data.

254
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:38,440
 DELETE ALL DATA?

255
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:43,580
 ENTER

256
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:59,460
It's done.

257
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:03,460
At last. We waited for this for so long.

258
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:06,460
Hurry up. We don't have time.

259
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:13,330
But is that medicine real?

260
00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:16,620
What?

261
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:20,260
Is it really the medicine that will give you eternal life?

262
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:25,520
I am asking because I am really curious, too.

263
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:31,640
Will that medicine made from my blood with my formula really give you eternal youth and immortality?

264
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:34,410
Or maybe it's a poison that will kill you?

265
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:38,640
I really don't know which of the two.

266
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:43,900
The formula in those glasses is definitely

267
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:46,680
the same formula that was written on the playground of White Night Village.
 - Yeah.

268
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:49,920
I remember that formula, too. I am the one who made it.

269
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:53,360
But what use is a formula that hasn't been proven?

270
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:59,470
Me. I haven't aged at all in 30 years,

271
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:03,920
I am the proof.

272
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:12,470
 DELETE ALL DATA?

273
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:21,670
 DELETE ALL DATA?
 70%...

274
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:27,380
There is only a difference in speed, but everyone will age and die someday.

275
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:31,430
But you are trying to violate this law of nature. Hasn't that ever occurred to you?

276
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:33,900
Stop talking bulls**t.

277
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:38,770
I'm just saying, I heard that Son Min Ho died, too.

278
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:42,590
What is going on? Was there ever a true formula?

279
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:45,620
That wasn't Do Jeong Wu's blood.

280
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:47,750
Please bring me the blood from the test subjects.

281
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:51,370
I will show it to you directly, Your Excellency.

282
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:04,860
It seems it's almost time for you to take your medicine. But I guess you're not in a rush?

283
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:12,080
That's right, the completed medicine.

284
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:16,170
This is a good chance to confirm it.

285
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:28,600
You can achieve eternal life.

286
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:35,970
Trust in me, Your Excellency.

287
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:57,980
I cannot trust you. I cannot be the test subject.

288
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:59,230
I should at least take my medicine.

289
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:01,800
Your Excellency! Your...

290
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:14,040
It's Oh Jeong Hwan.

291
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:16,860
Oh Jeong Hwan! Don't move!

292
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:18,750
Get out of the car! Oh Jeong Hwan!

293
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:21,720
Where is it? Where is it?

294
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,970
His actions are a bit strange.

295
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:40,460
Do Jeong Wu...

296
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,500
Deputy Chief.

297
00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:11,920
What is going on?

298
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:39,560
 DELETE ALL DATA?
 89%...

299
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:44,260
 DELETE ALL DATA?
 99%...

300
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:45,670
 DELETE ALL DATA?
 100%

301
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:46,540
 DELETE COMPLETE

302
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:48,700
Everything has been erased.

303
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:04,890
I think it's finally time to see this tragedy end.

304
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:31,350
Set the timer for the explosives.

305
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:38,450
 ENTER

306
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:47,120
Alright, everyone calm down now.

307
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:55,170
This miraculous moment we've been waiting for.

308
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:56,940
Let's watch it happen together.

309
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:58,920
Don't do it.

310
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:03,200
Don't do it!

311
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,230
Don't do it.

312
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:11,750
Don't do it...

313
00:36:14,530 --> 00:36:17,330
Have you really, never even once,

314
00:36:17,330 --> 00:36:21,110
felt regret for the things you've done?

315
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,650
Regret?

316
00:36:25,610 --> 00:36:30,070
Why... must... I regret anything?

317
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:33,680
I did my work purely, only for the purpose of completing my experiment.

318
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:42,960
Even if that experiment's subjects were your own daughter and son?

319
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:48,500
Yeah. Right.

320
00:36:55,910 --> 00:37:02,220
I still remember seeing your expression for the first time, in the moment I was born.

321
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,250
At first you were worried,

322
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:09,760
then that thrilled look on your face the moment our eyes met.

323
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,880
Because I was able to confirm your abilities.

324
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:18,760
Most newborns do not meet eyes with their mother from the very beginning.

325
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:22,590
It wasn't the expression of joy about the birth of a new life.

326
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:27,050
It was the expression of satisfaction after succeeding in your experiment.

327
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:35,080
You were born for this purpose.

328
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:39,640
My... monster.

329
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,860
Monster.

330
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:46,000
No...

331
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,460
So I am a monster.

332
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:51,100
 A monster... a monster!

333
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:53,650
 You're a monster!

334
00:37:54,590 --> 00:38:00,920
Rather than being this way, it would have been better to have never been born.

335
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:11,130
Staff Captain Do.

336
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:26,110
Intracranial pressure due to the side effects of the experiments, right?

337
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:33,330
No... that is not it.

338
00:38:38,890 --> 00:38:40,120
Staff Captain!

339
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:42,450
Don't come near me.

340
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:46,690
My son... so you have emotions.

341
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:51,020
It wouldn't have been easy for a monster to comprehend human emotions.

342
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:57,010
I am so proud of you.

343
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:03,420
No!

344
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:09,820
Don't come near me... go far away...

345
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:11,730
Please..

346
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:22,600
I told you, please escape this place!

347
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:39,120
I want to leave, but this Do Jeong Wu, he resists until the end.

348
00:40:44,530 --> 00:40:53,150
Alright, so everyone involved with White Night Village have all gathered here, huh?

349
00:40:53,150 --> 00:41:00,120
I whispered to Do Jeong Wu so many times that we must never let anyone know that you are alive, but he does not listen.

350
00:41:01,830 --> 00:41:07,320
So if I just kill everyone, that will work.

351
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:14,290
Monster. It's the monster.

352
00:41:14,290 --> 00:41:17,060
That monster.

353
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:31,550
Dissociative identity disorder.

354
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:35,130
I wasn't the only one suffering from it.

355
00:41:37,850 --> 00:41:39,930
Staff Captain!

356
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:44,930
What are you doing? Shoot him!

357
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:55,970
I am alone in a street with no one around.

358
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:08,730
The sun is shining whitely... no, you shouldn't.

359
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:15,850
If Do Jeong Wu comes back out, that will be very annoying to me.

360
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:25,890
The sun is shining whitely.

361
00:42:25,890 --> 00:42:31,090
The clock which is never wrong indicates it is midnight.

362
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:41,010
I wonder now

363
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:45,750
whether

364
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:51,290
it is daytime

365
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:56,190
or night?

366
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:03,230
No, Staff Captain. Please.

367
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:20,390
Oppa.

368
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:24,640
Oppa!

369
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,980
You must not.

370
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:33,100
Don't do it.

371
00:43:36,370 --> 00:43:41,060
Please. Stop.

372
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:49,650
Please stop now.

373
00:43:52,410 --> 00:43:54,490
Please.

374
00:44:21,810 --> 00:44:24,350
Hye Won.  Hye Won.

375
00:44:36,650 --> 00:44:39,060
Farewell!

376
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:42,720
What is going on?

377
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,840
No!

378
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:07,370
Hye Won, are you alright?

379
00:45:07,370 --> 00:45:09,650
We have to leave this place now.

380
00:45:11,170 --> 00:45:14,260
Okay. Find your father.

381
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:17,530
The kids. The kids!

382
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:24,930
Dad? Dad, come to your senses.

383
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:27,330
We have to leave now, Dad.

384
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:39,660
Why aren't they coming out?

385
00:45:46,390 --> 00:45:50,020
Alright, we have to leave quickly.

386
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:56,280
Ji Hui.

387
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:03,690
I hope that you become happy and no longer suffer.

388
00:46:13,820 --> 00:46:16,540
No.

389
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:18,500
Oppa.

390
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:22,160
Let's go together.

391
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:26,100
Oppa? Oppa?

392
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:28,020
Oppa!

393
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:30,060
Staff Captain.

394
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:33,300
Staff Captain, what are you doing? Staff Captain?

395
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:35,100
Oppa.

396
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:37,450
♫  That moon which shines dimly  ♫

397
00:46:37,450 --> 00:46:39,710

Oppa.

399
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:41,960

♫  the night that comes without fail  ♫

401

We have to go. We have to go right now.

402
00:46:47,230 --> 00:46:48,890
No.

403
00:46:48,890 --> 00:46:50,890
Staff Captain!

404
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:53,570
Staff Captain...

405
00:46:53,570 --> 00:46:55,090

Where is Do Jeong Wu, I asked you!

415

My son.

426

This is the last chance to escape this place.

427

Your last chance to apologize to the world.

Mother.

429
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:26,100
I, as a scientist,

must stay and observe this experiment being completed.

458
00:51:16,330 --> 00:51:20,560
 Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency

459
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:36,030
How are you feeling?

460
00:51:36,870 --> 00:51:41,910
If you acknowledge your crimes, the courts will consider extenuating circumstances.

461
00:51:47,490 --> 00:51:50,910
So please confess and accept punishment.

462
00:51:50,910 --> 00:51:56,720
Hye Won, I have not committed any crimes.

463
00:52:38,890 --> 00:52:42,810
Are you alright in there?

464
00:52:42,810 --> 00:52:47,330
I am alright. They give me meals on time, too.

465
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:51,110
I do miss having cup ramyeon, though.

466
00:52:52,260 --> 00:52:57,320
- If you accepted the insanity defense, you would have been sent to the hospital.
 - I know that.

467
00:52:57,320 --> 00:53:01,940
If you know, then why didn't you?

468
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:05,460
Because I committed crimes.

469
00:53:14,990 --> 00:53:18,850
I will return to the U.S. now.

470
00:53:20,750 --> 00:53:22,470
Then

471
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:26,200
I guess this is the last time we meet.

472
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:28,890
I will return here, though.

473
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:33,650
At that time, I will visit you again.

474
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:03,130
Lieutenant Gong.

475
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:07,850
You've worked hard. When will you return to work?

476
00:54:07,850 --> 00:54:11,760
But I submitted my resignation.

477
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:14,540
Stop saying useless things.

478
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:16,590
 Letter of Resignation

479
00:54:16,590 --> 00:54:21,380
Do you know how much it costs to properly train a police officer?

480
00:54:23,170 --> 00:54:26,310
Take some rest to recover and return to work.

481
00:54:29,630 --> 00:54:34,690
The weather is cold, and it's making me miss that boy again.

What brings you here?

485
00:55:28,540 --> 00:55:31,070
Did you think I would let you go without even saying goodbye?

486
00:55:31,070 --> 00:55:33,950
But I haven't done much, so it's embarrassing.

487
00:55:33,950 --> 00:55:37,350
You've worked hard.

488
00:55:37,350 --> 00:55:39,330
It wasn't hard work.

489
00:55:39,330 --> 00:55:42,670
I even recovered my memories.

490
00:55:43,510 --> 00:55:47,320
So many things have happened during a short period of time, haven't they?

491
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:51,350
Was Oppa's body found?

492
00:55:51,350 --> 00:55:52,830
No.

493
00:55:52,830 --> 00:55:57,900
Both Staff Captain and Jo Hyeon Hui disappeared without a trace.

494
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:02,530
Yes, that probably happened.

495
00:56:03,710 --> 00:56:08,360
Please have a safe trip. And please call me when you return to Korea.

496
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:14,820
And please contact me whenever you need help with anything, Lieutenant Gong.

497
00:56:15,660 --> 00:56:17,680
Be well.

498
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:52,530
Ahjussi.

499
00:56:53,620 --> 00:56:55,060
What's up?

500
00:56:55,060 --> 00:56:56,470
Nothing has happened, has it?

501
00:56:56,470 --> 00:56:59,060
Yes, I'm doing well because nothing has happened.

502
00:56:59,060 --> 00:57:02,890
But since nothing is going on my heart does feel a bit empty.

503
00:57:05,180 --> 00:57:07,740
But what's with this ambulance?

504
00:57:07,740 --> 00:57:09,830
- Is it yours?
 - Yes.

505
00:57:09,830 --> 00:57:12,550
I bought a used one to ride in when I get old and collapse.

506
00:57:12,550 --> 00:57:14,190
But who will drive it?

507
00:57:14,190 --> 00:57:19,690
Who knows? If that rotten guy was around, I could make him drive it.

508
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:23,420
But I better go somewhere right now.

509
00:57:23,420 --> 00:57:25,500
Yes, me too. I visited you briefly because I had some business around here.

510
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:26,930
Alright? Let me give you a ride, then.

511
00:57:26,930 --> 00:57:29,340
Get in.

512
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:35,520
Ahjussi, you knew that Staff Captain would do this, didn't you?

513
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:40,330
How can ever I know what he is up to? He is so unpredictable.

514
00:57:40,330 --> 00:57:42,250
That is true.

515
00:57:42,250 --> 00:57:46,840
But do you think Staff Captain really died?

516
00:57:50,310 --> 00:57:54,110
It was a big explosion, but there was no trace left of him.

517
00:57:54,110 --> 00:57:56,440
I'm sure he went to a good place.

00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:42,690
I found it.

Where are you going, Gong? Gong?

529
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:08,270
Why are you summoning me, when I am so busy?

530
00:59:10,830 --> 00:59:13,440
I thought I'd give you an exclusive scoop.

531
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:18,880
No need. Receiving this year's Journalist Award is enough for me.

532
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:20,640
Then never mind.

533
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:24,180
No. Let's hear it first.

534
00:59:31,850 --> 00:59:33,990
The day the secret lab exploded,

535
00:59:33,990 --> 00:59:40,120
late that night, an ambulance urgently leaving the scene was filmed by CCTV.

536
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:44,290
- But that ambulance belonged to Jang Seung Gu. 
  31 Ta 1389

537
00:59:44,290 --> 00:59:48,290
And I found a toll gate receipt in that car by chance.

538
00:59:48,290 --> 00:59:52,920
And it showed that he went through the Yeosu toll gate that very night.

539
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:57,650
Do Jeong Wu, are you really alive?

What brings you here?

544
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:44,040
Did you have breakfast? Hey, I brought you side dishes.

545
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:45,760
You should eat something before you go.

546
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:49,600
It's my first day of work after my promotion. I can't be late.

547
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:51,720
I'll be back.

01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:59,610
Team Leader Gong.

549
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:05,050
I heard you got promoted. Congratulations.

550
01:01:05,050 --> 01:01:07,040
Thank you.

551
01:01:07,970 --> 01:01:10,230
Looks like your hairstyle has changed a bit.

552
01:01:10,230 --> 01:01:12,200
Preening a little because you were promoted?

553
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:17,690
- Is it weird?
 - No, it suits a Team Leader.

554
01:01:18,470 --> 01:01:22,450
But have you found anything?

555
01:01:22,450 --> 01:01:26,410
I've confirmed that the CCTV filmed the ambulance going through the toll gate.

556
01:01:26,410 --> 01:01:28,560
And I've also confirmed that the ambulance got on a ferry headed to an island.

557
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:31,520
Did you confirm that Staff Captain was there?

558
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:34,790
Jang Seung Gu was the only one who got out of the car.

559
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:42,260
But there is someone who said they saw Do Jeong Wu on that island.

560
01:01:42,970 --> 01:01:47,230
He's the village leader there. And he said that someone came to visit him in the middle of the night.

561
01:01:47,230 --> 01:01:51,740
- He said that he will give him any amount of money if he will find him a house he can live in.
 - Oh, that man?

562
01:01:51,740 --> 01:01:55,920
And there happened to be an empty house, so he told him about it.

563
01:01:56,740 --> 01:02:03,020
And on that man's back was a woman who could not use her limbs, and bandaged from head to toe.

564
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:09,070
So he asked why a young bride couldn't use her limbs anymore. And he replied that she was not his bride.

565
01:02:09,070 --> 01:02:12,420
So he asked, who is that woman on your back?

566
01:02:12,420 --> 01:02:14,570
He replied that she was his mom.

567
01:02:14,570 --> 01:02:19,420
So I thought, what kind of guy tells such an awful joke?

568
01:02:19,420 --> 01:02:23,930
And then I had some business near that house, so I paid them a visit.

569
01:02:23,930 --> 01:02:25,830
The man wasn't there

570
01:02:25,830 --> 01:02:30,360
and that woman was lying there. So I just turned back.

571
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:32,080
But then that woman called out to me.

572
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:36,130
So I asked her if she was uncomfortable.

573
01:02:36,130 --> 01:02:37,860
And then?

574
01:02:37,860 --> 01:02:40,230
She asked me if I had any pesticide.

575
01:02:40,230 --> 01:02:47,010
Then with a very chilling expression on her face, she said, "Please kill me."

576
01:02:47,010 --> 01:02:51,200
So I immediately climbed back down that mountain.

577
01:04:01,830 --> 01:04:07,860
Could that really be Do Jeong Wu? If so, why did he make that choice?

578
01:04:07,860 --> 01:04:12,190
Rather than dying, living forever while suffering.

579
01:04:12,190 --> 01:04:16,330
Perhaps he thought that was the punishment that Jo Hyeon Hui deserved?

580
01:04:16,330 --> 01:04:18,190
After all, she was still his mom.

581
01:04:18,190 --> 01:04:23,900
He probably thought that taking care of her for the rest of his life was the punishment that he deserved.

582
01:04:25,810 --> 01:04:30,630
He was always that kind of person.

583
01:04:34,830 --> 01:04:36,530
It's finished.

 - Thank you.

585
01:04:39,730 --> 01:04:42,790
Why call us all the way here, just to put tinting on your car windows?

586
01:04:42,790 --> 01:04:45,690
This isn't ordinary tinting.

587
01:04:45,690 --> 01:04:47,030
It's bulletproof.

588
01:04:47,030 --> 01:04:50,740
Really? What use is that in Korea? No one can shoot guns in our country.

589
01:04:50,740 --> 01:04:52,900
- Newbie. Attention.
 - Yes.

590
01:04:52,900 --> 01:04:54,790
- Isn't that true?
 - Yes, you are right.

591
01:04:54,790 --> 01:04:57,350
Really? How is he right?

592
01:04:57,350 --> 01:04:58,930
Huh?

593
01:04:58,930 --> 01:05:03,560
Hey, Newbie. You know that detectives should have strong observation skills.

594
01:05:03,560 --> 01:05:05,030
Yes, I know that.

595
01:05:05,030 --> 01:05:10,170
Great, then I will now test your observation skills.

Stop right there.

599
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:35,660
What?

600
01:05:36,550 --> 01:05:38,690
- Wow, it really didn't break.
 - It's really bulletproof.

601
01:05:38,690 --> 01:05:40,490
- I know, right?
 - Wow.

602
01:05:40,490 --> 01:05:43,460
The car is bulletproof, but people...

603
01:05:50,730 --> 01:05:52,890
- What is that?
 - What?

604
01:05:53,970 --> 01:05:56,830
What are you doing? Chase him!

605
01:05:56,830 --> 01:05:59,000
Run! Run!

606
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,600
Hey! Stop!

607
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:03,180
Stop, you bastard!

608
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:08,920
I don't have any energy so why don't you come here?

609
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:10,890
Put down your knife.

610
01:06:18,620 --> 01:06:20,830
Put it down, you bastard!

611
01:06:23,640 --> 01:06:26,030
I will kill her.

- Lieutenant Jang.

01:06:41,130 --> 01:06:43,880
- Haven't we seen this before?
 - Yes.
