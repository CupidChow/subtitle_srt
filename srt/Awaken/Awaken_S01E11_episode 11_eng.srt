1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:07,930

2
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:39,050
  Awaken

3
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:15,330
Am I finally seeing the end of this?

4
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:17,960
The first shot is a warning. You know what comes next, right?

5
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:34,850
The first shot is a warning.

6
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:39,750
I can't guarantee what the next shot will be either.

7
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,320
Don't move!

8
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,220
Back up.

9
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:26,680
Team Leader! Team Leader! Wake up!

10
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,610
Please wake up!

11
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:41,210
Yeah.

12
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:44,390
It's okay. Go ahead.

13
00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:01,360
 Awaken

14
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,580
 Episode 11

15
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:46,110
Team Leader, wake up for a second.

16
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:48,750
Team Leader! Wake up!

17
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:52,230
Team Leader! I said wake up!

18
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:54,370
Team Leader!

19
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,400
Is anyone here?

20
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,720
Hello.

21
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:19,010
What would you like?

22
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:23,180
I'll take one kimchi stew.

23
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:37,070
- You scared me. 
 - Doctor.

24
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:39,720
What? What's wrong?

25
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:52,110
Staff Captain Do!

26
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,170
- What happened? 
 - Something was injected in his neck.

27
00:06:57,170 --> 00:07:00,190
But I'm not sure what it was.

28
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:31,220
What are these other wounds? These scratches too.

29
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:34,150
A truck hit his car.

30
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:37,030
Staff Captain Do.

31
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:39,660
Staff Captain Do! Can you hear me?

32
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:40,770
Did he hit his head?

33
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:42,040
I'm not sure.

34
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:45,750
But he was fine until he was injected.

35
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:53,880
His injuries seem minor. We'll need to do further testing to be certain.

36
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:57,320
As of now, it seems they injected some sort of anesthesia.

37
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:04,430
Excuse me.

38
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,600
Hello.

39
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,330
Alright.

40
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:25,710
What should I eat—

41
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,620
Don't worry. The test results didn't show anything abnormal.

42
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:57,050
And the injuries don't seem too bad. Once he wakes up, he should be fine.

43
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:09,390
You should rest up, too. I'm going to go up, get some supplies, and will be back.

44
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,470
We ran into a bit of an issue.

45
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:39,340
I think Do Jeong Wu followed me.

46
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:41,220
I heard.

47
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:47,410
Rather, it was a good chance to capture Do Jeong Wu. Idiot.

48
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:53,140
It's fortunate you were so alert.

49
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:55,530
I heard your daughter took him.

50
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:58,360
What? How did she?

51
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:01,040
I guess even she was following you.

52
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,210
It comes down to this, I guess.

53
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:08,670
A rat fink who was lost 28 years ago doesn't even know his place.

54
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:13,640
Since it's come down to this, we should probably tighten up our security, right?

55
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:17,670
For now, we should be able to continue the experiments.

56
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:20,580
We should. Since we don't know when Do Jeong Wu will come again.

57
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:23,800
I don't think we can take care of it as we did in the past.

58
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:28,100
Yes. Think about another solution and give me a call.

59
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:41,080
What are the chances that we would meet all the way down here, too?

60
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,710
Do you want a drink?

61
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:45,420
Why are we drinking in the daylight?

62
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:49,420
Don't you know drinking is more important than eating?

63
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:52,010
How did you know about this place?

64
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,160
Lieutenant Gong came to me.

65
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,490
You know that laptop that was found in the Jangi-dong building?

66
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:01,200
She brought the information on that laptop to me.

67
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,210
That laptop had to open with a fingerprint. How did she—

68
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:08,140
I heard it got unlocked by her fingerprint.

69
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,540
Isn't that interesting?

70
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:11,720
Do you know what's even more interesting?

71
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:16,410
Lieutenant Gong's father was involved in the White Night Village case.

72
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:18,910
Lieutenant Gong's father?

73
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,100
It's Do Jeong Wu.

74
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:26,810
It's probably not a coincidence that Lieutenant Gong became a member of the Special Team.

75
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:28,990
Possibly.

76
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:34,730
Don't you have work?

77
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:37,300
I'm about to.

78
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:41,550
Auntie! Have you been living here for a while?

79
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:44,660
What good is knowing that?

80
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,960
I'm actually a reporter.

81
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:51,940
I'm trying to write a killer article to make some money! That's why I came all the way here to the countryside.

82
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:54,460
Have a seat.

83
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:56,190
What kind of amazing thing do you think there is in this small village?

84
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:58,520
Why would you think there's not?

85
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,870
Even though it was like 30 years ago,

86
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:04,930
I heard there was a time where a bunch of people in the village died.

87
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:11,120
Even so, how can you bring him to our house?

88
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,080
I thought they were just kids that left home.

89
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:19,590
They said we did something wrong and went into the lye.

90
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:25,220
I don't know where they went after that.

91
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:27,200
Once I regained consciousness,

92
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,000
I heard they had already disappeared somewhere.

93
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:40,680
I can't believe, of all things, the one person I asked was a victim of that case.

94
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:44,230
So interesting. I came to the right place.

95
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:49,140
It's probably the third kid. It's a lot more serious than I thought.

96
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:53,540
Regardless, this village is twisted so let's look around a little more.

97
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:05,160
 Graduation Certificate

98
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:20,410
 I'll let every one of you that left me, feel pain like I felt.

99
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:22,270
 Don't leave!

100
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:24,490
 Don't just leave me alone!

101
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:27,000
 Don't leave!

102
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,510
He might kill me, too.

103
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:46,870
For some reason he's contacted all the scum who lost all means of livelihood.

104
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:49,050
I know the true criminal of this case.

105
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:51,850
Isn't that Do Jeong Wu?

106
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:53,260
No.

107
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:58,420
It's the third kid that came out of the White Night Village with Do Jeong Wu and Jamie Leighton.

108
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:01,170
It's Moon Jae Wung.

109
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:03,280
What? Why didn't you say so earlier?

110
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:06,160
Then are you saying you knew before when all the foundation directors

111
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,220
- starting with Nam Wu Cheon were dying?
 - I couldn't do anything about it.

112
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:12,390
If I didn't do as he told me to, he would have killed me.

113
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:16,690
You know that those kids are not like others.

114
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:19,820
So why are you telling me this?

115
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:24,880
Because it's going to affect you too.

116
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,620
I'll see what his next moves are and let you know.

117
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,330
What do you want?

118
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:32,830
Please ensure my life.

119
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:40,280
Did you tell this to anyone aside from me?

120
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,980
No.

121
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:46,400
Then let's keep it a secret between us two.

122
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,600
I'll give you a call.

123
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:15,260
I'm going to see if you guys are healthy.

124
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:19,380
Is this a hospital?

125
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:40,830
Why? Are you scared?

126
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:42,510
Should I do the other kids first?

127
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:48,280
No. I can do it first.

128
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:13,480
What is that? Does it hurt?

129
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,300
No, it doesn't hurt.

130
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:19,260
This makes sure your brain is working.

131
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:25,300
No, I don't want to! I don't want to!

132
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,410
It's okay.

133
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:44,400
 Jo Hyeon Hui

134
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:03,990
You don't have to be scared.

135
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,040
It's okay. It's okay.

136
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,490
Don't be scared.

137
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:43,940
Did you wake up? Are you okay?

138
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:46,810
What about you?

139
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:49,090
I'm okay.

140
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:57,460
You're awake.

141
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,230
It's Zoletil.

142
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:08,650
It's normally used to put animals to sleep but if you use it too much, it can be dangerous.

143
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:10,180
It seems like you're alright, though.

144
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:12,560
Yes, I slept soundly so I feel better.

145
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,560
If I rest a little more, I think I can move.

146
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,320
You should rest a little more.

147
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,890
I'll buy some food.

148
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:22,310
Yeah, the medication is still in you so lay down a little longer.

149
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:49,670
Alright, thank you, Deputy General Manager.

150
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:59,900
Don't come, don't come!

151
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:03,900
D-Don't come. Don't come. Don't come.

152
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:07,620
Don't come!

153
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:12,140
Dad, Dad, he's staring at me.

154
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:16,720
He's staring at me.

155
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:28,810
Um, someone is here.

156
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:44,550
As you know, only three children survived the White Night Village disaster.

157
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:49,330
Do Jeong Wu is one of them. There is one whom I don't know.

158
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:56,350
Jamie Leighton, the last one, happens to be the person summoned to find

159
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:58,770
the killer in the forewarned murders cases.

160
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,930
Teacher,  she told me she is a surviving child from the White Night Village.

161
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:08,270
I also found out. Jamie Leighton, who said it herself,

162
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:12,550
who thinks she was just a child in the White Night Village,

163
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:19,600
is Do Jeong Wu's weakness.

164
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:22,810
In any case, we need to be wary of them.

165
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:25,420
Sooner or later, they will pose a threat to the foundation.

166
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:28,850
Is this how someone who is so knowledgeable handles things?

167
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:31,760
You handed over information to Do Jeong Woo too easily.

168
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:35,210
You should have kept your mouth shut forever.

169
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,560
Does His Excellency know the truth about Do?

170
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:43,920
Do's target is His Excellency.

171
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:49,660
I'll take care of that.  You can leave now.

172
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:54,890
What will you do if I capture the surviving children?

173
00:21:56,340 --> 00:22:00,650
We will welcome that anytime if you can do just that.

174
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:06,250
After the White Night Village disaster, I've lived and coped with being completely ignored by the foundation.

175
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:09,270
I have always been holding my breath in the fear

176
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:12,090
that someone might come to kill me.

177
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:16,970
When I capture the children, have me appointed as a director of the foundation.

178
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:21,350
If you can accomplish only that, is there anything you're not capable of?

179
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:25,060
Don't come near me!

180
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:31,090
Is something happening to your son?

181
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:36,880
White Night Village was on an isolated island according to the references.

182
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,090
It was deliberately placed there so what was being done there

183
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:42,510
wouldn't be exposed to the outside world.

184
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:45,980
It's an island in the middle of a sea.

185
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:49,660
The kids being experimented on would never have thought of escaping.

186
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:56,590
How did the three kids, including me, escape on the day of the disaster?

187
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:58,860
I can't say.

188
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:01,340
You're one of them.

189
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:06,310
When you get into the village, you shouldn't think about what it was.

190
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,650
Can CEO Jang Yong Shik on the MODU portal site.

191
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:22,040
The foundation people who complained of suffering

192
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:24,640
from similar mental distress received a lot of help also.

193
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:35,790
Hello, Chief Secretary.

194
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:40,100
Hello, Chairman. There's something I need to discuss with you.

195
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:42,340
Have you got some time tomorrow?

196
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:44,020
I'll give you the details when we meet.

197
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,370
All right.

198
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:48,170
Yes, I'll call you.

199
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:56,330
Is there something to discuss with me?

200
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,440
I have something to do so I'll go out for a while.

201
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,610
Take a break.

202
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,800
Good job.

203
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:27,290
What?  What did I do?

204
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:31,020
It's about time he arrived, right?

205
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:35,250
You called Deputy Department Head Hwang, didn't you?

206
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:36,460
No, I—

207
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:41,570
It's okay.  I understand. I would have done the same.

208
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:45,600
Even if you turned yourself in, you would never escape like this sometime.

209
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,820
What should we do, Team Leader? Shouldn't we be going out right now?

210
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:52,820
No, wait.  The police aren't coming.

211
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:10,350
What's up? What the hell are you all doing here?

212
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:47,110
Just stay put until the cops arrive.

213
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:50,350
Staff Captain Do, I'm sorry.

214
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:51,990
Yes.

215
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:04,460
Okay, bye.

216
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:49,250
I'm sorry. We missed it.

217
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:51,120
I heard that.

218
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,690
- In any case, I am expecting your continued cooperation in the future. 
 - Yes.

219
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:55,520
Of course.

220
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,880
How much longer will you be a deputy chief?

221
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:01,620
We'll give you as good a position as the extent of your cooperation.

222
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:05,360
Look, then why isn't a government authority committed to the task?

223
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:09,840
You don't have to be concerned about such things.

224
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,030
I understand.

225
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:22,610
How long will you make him miss it?

226
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:27,040
I'm sorry.

227
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:30,470
Dr. Gong Il Do will be contacting you. Do whatever he tells you to do.

228
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:32,000
Yes, sir.

229
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:00,360
Are you feeling better?

230
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:03,800
If I got just a little more drugs, I think it will be okay.

231
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,420
I don't think you would do that.

232
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:10,990
You're a civil servant. You need to think of your own livelihood.

233
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:19,830
If I hadn't reported it, I would have been in trouble.

234
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,370
There's another civil servant who wants to get into trouble here.

235
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:31,420
You said you wanted to go to find your childhood memories.

236
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:35,140
It's already too dark today, so come back tomorrow morning.

237
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:36,710
Thank you, boss.

238
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:39,680
Thanks. We'll see you tomorrow then.

239
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:46,920
Still, it's a relief to know at least one person is willing to do it.

240
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:50,850
We should find a place to stay for tonight.

241
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:52,640
Well...

242
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:56,200
I'm not sure this country village will have an adequate place to stay for our Jamie.

243
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:59,780
Even though I look like this, I am from the FBI.

244
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:11,420
Laptop...it was you, right?

245
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:15,690
You registered my fingerprints in the laptop, didn't you?

246
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:22,250
White Night Village...my dad...

247
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:26,760
and you. What horrific events took place there?

248
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:29,960
Won't the truth be revealed eventually?

249
00:29:35,410 --> 00:29:37,850
Take me with you.

250
00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:46,220
Do you know what you are saying?

251
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:47,230
I know.

252
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:50,990
It will be more difficult than you can imagine.

253
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:54,340
And it's not something that needs to be done by you.

254
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:57,190
It's something I need to do.

255
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:12,350
I think the best thing you can do is forget about all this.

256
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:18,620
However..."I still want to do this"...

257
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:25,500
If that's what you come to think,

258
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:34,380
come find me then.

259
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,530
What are you doing, FBI?

260
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:03,630
What's that?

261
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:06,500
Why do you want to know?

262
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:14,960
You really can't fall asleep if it's not your own house?

263
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:18,900
Yes. I can't. Unless it's my own bed.

264
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:23,840
Sounds tough. To have that thing called mysophobia.

265
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,270
That's why it's classified as a disorder.

266
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:33,760
But are you sure you were part of the human experimentation?

267
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:38,190
Obsessive-compulsive disorder, mysophobia, paranoia, and a messed up head.

268
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:40,680
What else would be the reason for that?

269
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:45,580
Well...that's not quite what I meant...

270
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:50,740
I just feel like you're like us.

271
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:55,210
But Do Jeong Wu was always different.

272
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:47,260
 Chat Messages

273
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:50,520
 Sending number blocked 
 Truck License Number:  Seoul 88 Ba 8624

274
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:53,360
 Seoul 88 Ba 8624

275
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:03,810
It was a pleasure seeing you today.

276
00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:05,800
- Same here. 
 - Take care on your way home.

277
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:09,200
- See you next time. 
 - Goodbye.

278
00:34:09,930 --> 00:34:12,360
Let's see her off.

279
00:34:17,830 --> 00:34:19,860
Head home.

280
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:37,160
Who are you?

281
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:40,320
It's no use.

282
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:44,190
This car has a child safety lock installed.

283
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:47,780
Yet I hear you took the children away from safety.

284
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:51,550
- Did you kill my son? 
 - Lee Tae Su?

285
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:54,570
Nope. But is your son the only child that matters?

286
00:34:54,570 --> 00:34:57,810
Where did you take the other children from the Hangang Welfare Center?

287
00:34:57,810 --> 00:34:58,940
I don't know either where they are.

288
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:00,340
Really?

289
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:03,130
Well then.

290
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:09,370
What are you doing?!

291
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:14,280
Stop the car!

292
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:19,140
Oh Jeong Hwan!

293
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:22,830
The Blue House's secretary Oh Jeong Hwan planned everything!

294
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:26,830
I also only sent the kids as I was ordered to.

295
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:32,050
I don't know where they were taken or what they are doing with them!

296
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:33,790
This is a victim.

297
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:36,450
If you continue to push through appropriately as you have been doing,

298
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:41,560
my share will increase because my safety is most important.

299
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:27,710
There's too much rain today, so we can't leave the shore.

300
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:30,060
Come back tomorrow.

301
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:32,910
What should we do now?

302
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:34,670
No helping it.

303
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:37,490
Let's just stay for tonight and see how it turns out tomorrow.

304
00:36:38,350 --> 00:36:43,230
The weather is so crummy. Is the sky upset that we're digging into something from 28 years ago?

305
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:50,270
 We can't just go by ourselves.

306
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:52,310
 We can't take the other kids, though.

307
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:54,020
 Then we're all going to die!

308
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:56,790
 But we can't just leave them!

309
00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:01,280
 You're a monster.

310
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:05,830
 You're a monster. A monster!

311
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:23,200
- Are you okay? 
 - Monster...

312
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:35,210
How are you feeling?

313
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:36,880
I'm alright.

314
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:40,600
Old man, if there are any supplements you take, give me some. Let's eat it together.

315
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:44,550
That mouth of yours... Where are you coming from?

316
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:48,390
I just saw Lee Byeong Seon's wife.

317
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:49,120
What did she say?

318
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:54,810
Do you know that secretary Oh Jeong Hwan? I think he has some ulterior motive.

319
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:05,200
What?!

320
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:10,070
Okay.

321
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:11,730
What? Did something happen?

322
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:14,030
Drug dealer Hyeon Su...

323
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:17,960
He died.

324
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:31,370
It's him.

325
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:53,540
It's Hyeon Su.

326
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:56,940
They think he was hit in the head by someone and died.

327
00:38:56,940 --> 00:39:01,740
Poor dude. He was all talk about getting a super car.

328
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:05,470
He was saving his money to help his grandma get surgery.

329
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:09,610
He probably could've gotten her the surgery with the money you gave him but then this happened...

330
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:17,030
The world is so unfair.

331
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:21,020
Shouldn't it be fair to everyone when it comes to living or dying?

332
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:24,090
I told him to be careful.

333
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,990
He only had a cellphone to leave behind.

334
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:37,600
 Recent Calls

335

 Customer 1818 (Oh Kyeong Min) (3) 
 Customer 1818 (Oh Kyeong Min) (2)

336
00:39:50,570 --> 00:39:52,140
You've worked hard.

337
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:54,550
If public opinion were not for everyone on the portal site,

338
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:58,370
what a mess this country would be in.

339
00:39:58,370 --> 00:40:01,610
This is all thanks to you helping me.

340
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:04,370
What is the reason you wanted to see me today?

341
00:40:04,370 --> 00:40:10,240
I heard you helped relieve a lot of stress from the people in the foundation.

342
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:13,870
That's right.

343
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:16,940
I also received a lot of stress running the company.

344
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:21,660
And I came across a person that did psychotherapy on me and it helped me a lot.

345
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:24,510
So I introduced the people in the foundation to him.

346
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:30,280
You receive a lot of stress because of managing government affairs too, right?

347
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:32,670
Not for me.

348
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:35,690
I'm embarrassed to say it but it's for my son.

349
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:41,270
I would like for my son to get psychotherapy done.

350
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:45,460
It seems like things are working out easily.

351
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:46,490
What things?

352
00:40:46,490 --> 00:40:51,480
Moon Jae Wung sent the result video to the reporter Lee Ji Wuk but not the preview video?

353
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:55,980
Yeah. Why would I do something you didn't tell me to?

354
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:59,890
Then who sent the preview video?

355
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:01,510
 Serial killer Do Jeong Wu, whereabouts unknown

356
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:04,350
It's him. Do Jeong Wu.

357
00:41:05,870 --> 00:41:08,770
Shall we start fishing then?

358
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:09,950
Fishing for what?

359
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:13,100
We have to catch Do Jeong Wu.

360
00:41:38,890 --> 00:41:42,590
We don't know whom he is affiliated with.

361
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:54,770
Are you sure you don't have to go to the hospital?

362
00:41:54,770 --> 00:41:58,600
There are times where my memory randomly comes back.

363
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:02,930
After that, I get super dizzy like I'm depressed or something.

364
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:05,400
Is it some kind of trauma?

365
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:09,460
What kind of memory did you get earlier that made you so out of it?

366
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:11,190
And what was that "monster" talk about?

367
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:15,780
A memory that has been bothering me since I was a child.

368
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:21,170
The day of the disaster.  The day I ran away from the monster.

369
00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:26,920
That curiosity has brought me all the way here.

370
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:29,740
So do you remember who that monster is?

371
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:34,380
It became a little more clear.

372
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:37,780
 You're a monster. A monster!

373
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:50,730
It must be hard for you. I understand what they mean when they say it's a mess in their head.

374
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:58,030
At first, I thought this case was a show put together by a brilliant meticulous psychopath.

375
00:42:58,030 --> 00:43:02,110
I thought "since the world is going crazy, the people in it are going crazy with it."

376
00:43:02,110 --> 00:43:07,420
What kind of crazy person would put out a preview that they're going to kill someone and tell the whole world about it?

377
00:43:08,590 --> 00:43:12,110
Since it's something that we're already dabbling in, let's see how it goes.

378
00:43:12,110 --> 00:43:14,830
If we're lucky, we'll get our names known.

379
00:43:14,830 --> 00:43:16,810
How simple.

380
00:43:16,810 --> 00:43:21,690
But now, I'm super curious about who the criminal is.

381
00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:27,100
That serial killer who doesn't have a single drop of blood on his hands and doesn't even show up at the crime scenes.

382
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:31,490
If it's the third kid, one of the survivors from the White Night Village...

383
00:43:31,490 --> 00:43:36,920
So if he's doing this to get revenge on the White Night Foundation...

384
00:43:40,090 --> 00:43:41,520
Wouldn't that be like an episode of a drama?

385
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:47,260
I was wondering why Do Kyeong Jeong sent you the previews but now I'm starting to understand.

386
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:49,180
Do Jeong Wu.

387
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:56,820
Do Jeong Wu or that other kid... They're both something else.

388
00:43:56,820 --> 00:44:00,050
Anyway, since I've come this far, I have to see the end of it.

389
00:44:00,050 --> 00:44:04,820
I'm starting to get curious about the end as well.

390
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:23,460
Mom, what did you like about Dad?

391
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:24,450
What is this about?

392
00:44:24,450 --> 00:44:26,620
He only knows about research.

393
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:28,620
Isn't he just mediocre as a man or a father?

394
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:31,400
I didn't think about any of that when I was younger.

395
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:37,370
I just thought that it'd be nice to have someone like him

396
00:44:37,370 --> 00:44:39,590
around.

397
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:44,690
Why? Is something going on with you and Dad?

398
00:44:44,690 --> 00:44:47,190
Are you upset because Dad told you to quit being a police officer?

399
00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:50,120
No, it's not that.

400
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:52,050
Do what you want.

401
00:44:52,050 --> 00:44:58,150
Who cares what I think? A mom will have her opinions. But you are your own person.

402
00:44:58,150 --> 00:45:01,020
I don't like you being a police officer either.

403
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:05,910
It's the best for a human to live quietly as though you don't exist.

404
00:45:05,910 --> 00:45:10,010
But if you want to do it, it's your life. What are we going to do about it?

405
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:14,150
I raised you well enough for you to make those decisions yourself.

406
00:45:14,150 --> 00:45:15,500
Do as you want.

407
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:17,360
Really?

408
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:28,120
 Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency

409
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:30,310
Gong, don't make such rash decisions.

410
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:32,930
Let's think about it together. We're all miserable!

411
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:36,170
Lieutenant Gong, why are you doing this?

412
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:41,530
Are you doing this because of Team Leader?

413
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:43,060
I'm trying to do something, if anything.

414
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:50,330
So you, and you too, Lieutenant Yun, do what you have to do here.

415
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:53,330
If I need help, I'll give you a call.

416
00:45:58,550 --> 00:46:01,090
Do me a favor and please send this to my house.

417
00:46:01,090 --> 00:46:03,050
Hey Gong...

418
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:10,240
We'll meet again soon.

419
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:17,000
What are you doing right now?

420
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,970
I'm sorry. I will be responsible for my decisions.

421
00:46:20,970 --> 00:46:24,930
Are you doing this to go to Do Jeong Wu?

422
00:46:24,930 --> 00:46:29,570
You feel like you're bringing a lot of justice, right? But you'll see soon.

423
00:46:29,570 --> 00:46:31,880
- Reality...
 - I'm doing this because I know what the reality is.

424
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:34,080
Confidence in government authority has been compromised.

425
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:39,270
I'm not proud of being a police officer anymore.

426
00:46:39,270 --> 00:46:41,950
Thank you for everything.

427
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:56,940
What are you going to do?

428
00:47:02,590 --> 00:47:05,310
 Letter of Resignation

429
00:47:05,310 --> 00:47:07,350
I'm not sure.

430
00:47:26,230 --> 00:47:28,310
It's raining so much.

431
00:47:28,310 --> 00:47:29,890
Can the boat not leave today either?

432
00:47:29,890 --> 00:47:31,990
The captain can't do it.  What's the big hurry?

433
00:47:31,990 --> 00:47:34,570
Let's wait one more day.

434
00:47:34,570 --> 00:47:38,740
 Bed and Breakfast

435
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:18,120
Who is that?

436
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:34,760
Nice to meet you. I've heard a lot about you.

437
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:36,600
Nice to meet you.

438
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:39,330
Where is your son?

439
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:48,650
Please treat him well.

440
00:48:48,650 --> 00:48:51,450
Yes, I will.

441
00:49:09,450 --> 00:49:13,130
I heard about your problem. I'll help you.

442
00:49:16,650 --> 00:49:18,350
Your hand?

443
00:49:24,630 --> 00:49:28,930
You can't take this watch off from here on out.

444
00:49:28,930 --> 00:49:31,860
Everything will start from there.

445
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:40,700
Now you can do anything you want.

446
00:50:28,350 --> 00:50:29,990
I've been seeing you often.

447
00:50:29,990 --> 00:50:32,120
Thanks to you, I got some good rest.

448
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:34,490
What do you know?

449
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:47,910
Dad, I'm at your lab.  Can I see you briefly?

450
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:02,190
What brought you all the way here?

451
00:51:02,190 --> 00:51:08,590
Dad... What did you do at the White Night Village?

452
00:51:14,570 --> 00:51:15,760
What do you mean?

453
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:18,660
The things you did 28 years ago.

454
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:22,150
And the things you're possibly doing now.

455
00:51:22,150 --> 00:51:25,980
If there's anything you need to come clean about, come clean about it and get the punishment you deserve.

456
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:28,840
You're young.

457
00:51:29,650 --> 00:51:32,960
I didn't do anything that deserves punishment.

458
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:36,040
I know you experimented on kids.

459
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:39,130
There were over 500 kids from the White Night Village.

460
00:51:39,130 --> 00:51:42,160
There were only 38 by the end.

461
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:45,460
What happened to over 400 of those kids?

462
00:51:45,460 --> 00:51:47,280
Is there still no problem?

463
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:49,900
I didn't do anything that was wrong.

464
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:52,130
Dad!

465
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:57,760
You're still too young. If you don't understand, we can't do anything about it.

466
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:00,300
Dad, please.

467
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:07,760
How many times do I have to tell you? You don't know anything.

468
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:11,380
My work goes on with trial and error.

469
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:13,790
No. There's nothing that's like that naturally.

470
00:52:13,790 --> 00:52:16,220
We have to cut our losses when it comes down to succeeding.

471
00:52:16,220 --> 00:52:19,090
What about the people that we lose? What about those kids?

472
00:52:19,090 --> 00:52:21,580
How can we do anything with no losses?

473
00:52:21,580 --> 00:52:22,670
Dad.

474
00:52:22,670 --> 00:52:25,820
This is why Do Jeong Wu kept you around.

475
00:52:25,820 --> 00:52:28,470
He made it so you would find out about everything.

476
00:52:28,470 --> 00:52:31,590
You don't know what's really important.

477
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:37,810
I'm not talking about the Team Leader right now.

478
00:52:37,810 --> 00:52:43,240
You... You're not this kind of person, Dad.

479
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:46,440
Whatever you saw, you're being manipulated.

480
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:48,730
Get it together.

481
00:53:21,390 --> 00:53:24,670
 We have to cut our losses when it comes down to succeeding.

482
00:53:24,670 --> 00:53:27,960
 I didn't do anything wrong.

483
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:31,750
 How can we do anything with no losses?

484
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:49,860
Those kids were test subjects?

485
00:53:51,190 --> 00:53:54,760
Not even those kids from back then. They're still testing on kids today.

486
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:57,740
Like the things they did in the White Night Village?

487
00:53:57,740 --> 00:54:00,520
Do you remember those kids that fainted after having a nose bleed?

488
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:03,800
Those that came out alive have some issues in the head.

489
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:08,460
We have to stop them from making innocent kids die.

490
00:54:08,460 --> 00:54:13,290
That day you saw me, I was following the truck that had the test subject kids in it.

491
00:54:13,290 --> 00:54:17,150
Thanks to you, I lost them.

492
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:24,060
Do you know where the secret testing lab is?

493
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:25,860
No.

494
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:31,390
I didn't even know the research was still going on. I was just doing as I was told.

495
00:54:37,410 --> 00:54:42,770
How long do you think you can just close your eyes and ears and let things go as they are now?

496
00:54:42,770 --> 00:54:45,290
Someone has to stop them.

497
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:02,160
 If you're here, can't you make some noise?

498
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:05,590
 Do you want me to sing aloud that I have arrived?

499
00:55:07,030 --> 00:55:11,220
 What? What are you looking at?

500
00:55:12,410 --> 00:55:16,850
 It was my mistake to think of you as a human.

501
00:55:16,850 --> 00:55:18,860
 I didn't kill them on accident.

502
00:55:18,860 --> 00:55:21,820
 I killed them because I could.

503
00:55:25,790 --> 00:55:27,430
 Die!

504
00:55:49,170 --> 00:55:51,240
Are you okay?

505
00:55:56,700 --> 00:55:59,490
Do you know the place where you're dreaming?

506
00:55:59,490 --> 00:56:00,930
Yes.

507
00:56:00,930 --> 00:56:03,760
It's the roof of the building in Yeonsi-dong.

508
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:09,250
The dream occurs at a place you have a connection with. Something happened there, right?

509
00:56:09,250 --> 00:56:11,080
No.

510
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:19,800
But...

511
00:56:22,010 --> 00:56:25,360
Do I really have to hang myself at the end?

512
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:26,830
I'm scared.

513
00:56:26,830 --> 00:56:30,760
It's not scary once you keep doing it. It's stimulating the brain.

514
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:35,360
If you don't do something sudden like that, the brain won't respond.

515
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:41,360
Oh Jung Hwan's house security is too tight.  It won't be easy to approach.

516
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:46,290
The secretary of the Blue House is not an ordinary person. Of course, their security is top notch.

517
00:56:46,290 --> 00:56:51,770
And their military ranks are high. Even if it's someone important, isn't it weird that all his guards have high military ranks?

518
00:56:51,770 --> 00:56:52,660
That's true...

519
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:55,730
I have to find a different solution.

520
00:57:02,250 --> 00:57:03,890
What is this?

521
00:57:03,890 --> 00:57:05,870
What's this?

522
00:57:05,870 --> 00:57:09,530
There's no sender. Is this a report?

523
00:57:18,890 --> 00:57:21,000
What is this?

524
00:57:33,460 --> 00:57:35,310
- What's up? 
 - Hyung, where are you right now?

525
00:57:35,310 --> 00:57:37,020
I'm getting information for a scoop.

526
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:40,430
Hyung, this is crazy. Do you know what just came?

527
00:57:40,430 --> 00:57:42,380
What came? Hurry up and spit it out.

528
00:57:42,380 --> 00:57:44,960
It's a new murder forewarning.

529
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:49,570
A murder forewarning? Are you sure?

530
00:57:49,570 --> 00:57:53,530
Soon Jeong LP.

531
00:57:53,530 --> 00:57:54,220
What is this?

532
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:56,710
 Hello everyone, this is Reporter Lee Ji Wuk.

533
00:57:56,710 --> 00:58:01,390
 Right now, I'm here in order to enter the White Night Village.

534
00:58:01,390 --> 00:58:04,030
Do you remember about the murder warning?

535
00:58:04,030 --> 00:58:08,440
 After the case of Son Min Ho, formerly head of the White Night Village, the last victim,

536
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:12,330
 the police department's news embargo prevented us from following up.

537
00:58:12,330 --> 00:58:15,650
A new murder forewarning has arrived after a month.

538
00:58:15,650 --> 00:58:16,670
A new murder forewarning?

539
00:58:16,670 --> 00:58:20,170
 The day the red dog rode the white dragon.

540
00:58:20,170 --> 00:58:25,670
 The arrogant coward will be the Tarot's last star.

541
00:58:25,670 --> 00:58:27,530
Another murder warning?

542
00:58:27,530 --> 00:58:29,950
How many have they had so far?

543
00:58:30,710 --> 00:58:33,890
 The lead officer for the case Do Jeong Wu has been the prime suspect.

544
00:58:33,890 --> 00:58:36,790
 He has yet to be caught.

545
00:58:36,790 --> 00:58:39,820
Your Team Leader still hasn't been caught?

546
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:43,620
 This time what will the method be and what person will be sacrificed?

547
00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:48,070
 It's time for the police to respond promptly.

548
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:58,080
 The day the red dog rode the white dragon.

549
00:58:58,080 --> 00:59:00,900
 The arrogant coward will be the Tarot's last star.

550
00:59:08,630 --> 00:59:15,730

551
00:59:22,770 --> 00:59:26,430
♫  Splitting in half, where is my day and night  ♫

552
00:59:26,430 --> 00:59:30,070
♫  Neither one is mine  ♫

553

 Preview

556
00:59:40,010 --> 00:59:43,020
 Do Jeong Wu was searching for you and this lab.

557
00:59:43,020 --> 00:59:44,220
 Do Jeong Wu...

558
00:59:44,220 --> 00:59:46,010
 It's not the name I gave him.

559
00:59:46,010 --> 00:59:48,260
 Do you know the Team Leader well?

560
00:59:48,260 --> 00:59:52,570
 - I think there's a way to approach Oh Jeong Hwan. 
 - I have to find them soon.

561
00:59:52,570 --> 00:59:55,190
 I'm thinking of using Oh Kyeong Min to trap Do Jeong Wu.

562
00:59:55,190 --> 00:59:56,160
 Bye.

563
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:58,530
 You're setting up the board for me.

564
00:59:58,530 --> 01:00:01,660
 You voluntarily came to the place you wanted to leave so badly .

565
01:00:01,660 --> 01:00:03,830
 Is your memory coming back?

566
01:00:03,830 --> 01:00:05,590
 The third kid...

567
01:00:05,590 --> 01:00:06,920
 It's been a while.
