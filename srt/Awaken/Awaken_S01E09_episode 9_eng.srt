00:00:02,030 --> 00:00:09,030

2
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:39,010
 Awaken

3
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:49,400
You still haven't gotten it together?

4
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,990
Did you forget what happens if you speak with others?

5
00:00:56,950 --> 00:01:01,920
Seems you need another beating. The convenience store girl died because of you.

6
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,520
Because you're annoying!

7
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,510
It's because you're annoying.

8
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:09,270
Annoying. Annoying. Annoying. Annoying.

9
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:11,920
- It's Go Ji Yeong!
 - What?

10
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,650
She is not that girl from the convenience store. Her name is Go Ji Yeong.

11
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:18,360
 I will help you check out.

12
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,140
 Goodbye.

13
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:23,910
She's a good person who smiled at me.

14
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:27,930
I've never seen such a novel bastard. Of course she would smile at the customer, not cuss him out!

15
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:31,820
That girl would naturally smile at anyone!

16
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:38,580
No, smiling at me...

17
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:43,180
So she smiled at you, and that's why you left her to die?

18
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:48,610
You knew that she was going to die, right?

19
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,310
- No! 
 - You knew!

20
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,220
No!

21
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:55,260
You are always the one who knows but only tries to save himself!

22
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:57,410
I am not!

23
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:59,860
This bastard!

24
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:48,190
What's with that guy?

25
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:27,830
  28 years ago

26
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:35,030
Because of the disaster yesterday, the seas are a mess.

27
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:37,590
After stirring up the sea like that, how are we supposed to catch fish?

28
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:42,560
We should definitely file a complaint this time, and find out what is going on.

29
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:48,250
Huh? What's with these kids?

30
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:50,260
What is it?

31
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:54,580
Who are these thieves?

32
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:58,930
Wait a second. That's not it! Didn't you just say something happened on the other island?

33
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:03,870
- The naval forces were called, and there were helicopters in the air, too.
 - Over there?

34
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:07,800
How can these little kids come here from that far?

35
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:12,360
So tell us. Are you from that island?

36
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:17,300
What should we do?

37
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:20,560
No! My dad will come get me soon.

38
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,610
He told me to wait here.

39
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:32,290
How could you bring them to our home?!

40
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:36,000
Well, Mister Park said he will take them to the police station.

41
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,650
What's the point of sending these kids to the police if their father is coming?

42
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:42,230
How do we know he even has a father?

43
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:46,450
He even had blood on his face.

44
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:49,090
What do we do now? Go to the police?

45
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:53,290
No.  Do you not know who got us into this predicament?

46
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:58,730
No one will come to save us. Since you are stupid, you can just follow me.

47
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:30,390
 Rather than trembling with fear because I might be killed, isn't it better to kill first?

48
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:45,230
 Bastards who don't keep their promises, bad people who only care about themselves.

49
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:50,130
 Those two also left me behind. I will kill them all.

50
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,430
 Awaken

51
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:05,090
 Gong Il Do

52
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:39,880
 Gong Il Do

53
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:44,650
You've grown a lot. If we ran into each other elsewhere, I would not have recognized you.

54
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:49,560
What's with the polite greeting? I don't think we have that kind of relationship.

55
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,950
 Daughter

56
00:07:56,130 --> 00:08:00,150
- Hello? 
- Dad, I came to the research center. You are in the office, right?

57
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:02,770
 - I will be there soon.  
- I can't see you right now.

58
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:05,540
  What do you mean you can't? I'm almost here.

59
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:08,780
  There are some things Mom told me to deliver. I'll just drop them off and leave.

60
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:11,770
- And say some personal things. 
- We can talk about it tomorrow at home.

61
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:14,030
I'm nearly here.

62
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,690
I have a delivery!

63
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:34,930
You really don't listen to me.

64
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:41,970
Who threw away the candy wrapper here instead of the trash can? How rude.

65
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:48,490
I'm really serious right now. I desperately need to talk.

66
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:51,790
What is it? Did something happen?

67
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:53,910
You really don't have interest in me?

68
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:57,450
Your daughter is at risk of being fired from her job right now.

69
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:01,920
- I'm fine if you quit your job at the police agency. 
 - What?

70
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,780
I didn't like it from the beginning when you said you wanted to be a police officer.

71
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:06,960
You never said that before.

72
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:11,850
I assumed you could do it because it wasn't so dangerous,  but now it's different.

73
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:13,600
What do you mean?

74
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:20,300
Is it because of Team Leader?

75
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,520
 No. 1989

 No. 1952

 No. 1954

00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,900
 No. 1960

79
00:10:54,900 --> 00:11:00,700

80
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:11,420
Dad, I am not certain yet, but there is more than meets the eye in Team Leader's case.

81
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:14,710
- So I intend to look into itâ€” 
 - What is the point of that?

82
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:17,730
There are so many things in this world that are more than meets the eye.

83
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:20,800
Are you going to butt into everything in this world?

84
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:27,090
Is the man you said you like that Team Leader?

85
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:30,820
- That is not related to this issue.
 - I told you to forget him completely, didn't I?

86
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:34,400
If he rejects you, accepting it is proper manners.

87
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,300
This is really not about that.

88
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,700
There is something really appalling behind this case.

89
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:42,220
That is all the more reason for you to stop.

90
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:29,160
 If the true culprit behind this case is not Do Jeong Wu, but the third child...

91
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:34,510
 ... the site of the incident. Things got mixed up  here.

92
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:03,470
 Indeed, it wasn't just a padlock.

93
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:07,040
 A recognition device that only allows entry for selected people.

94
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:17,130
 When we invaded this place, it wasn't there.

95
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:20,260
 If it was Staff Captain Do who removed this

96
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:26,160
the one who installed it is the culprit.

97
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:31,370
But something could be wrong. If improper things are happening, it should be set right.

98
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:34,070
Do you have the power to do something like that?

99
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:37,490
At times like these, it's best to just sit still.

100
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:41,920
Hye Won, this isn't something that you can change.

101
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,330
Dad.

102
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:50,660
I'm sorry, I think I'm being too sensitive.

103
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:52,120
It's fine.

104
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:57,000
I was being selfish, when you must have so much on your mind.

105
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,390
I'll go now.

106
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:01,070
Be safe on your way home.

107
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:03,420
Dad, you should rest, too.

108
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:22,100
It appears that you put Hye Won on your team because of me.

109
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,860
So was there really a reason for you to hide from her?

110
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:30,500
Let's not waste time. If you love your daughter, let's get to the point.

111
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,750
What is it that you want?

112
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:36,900
The secret lab where the research has been continuing, and the location of the support fund.

113
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:39,910
My method was used for His Excellency, I heard?

114
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:42,540
So he's over 100 years old, but still very healthy.

115
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:47,890
But I cannot seem to find out where this guy is and what's he up to.

116
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:49,000
What do you plan to do?

117
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,470
If improper things are happening I should set it right. I have the power to do that.

118
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:58,600
Do Jeong Wu, what you did is a miracle.

119
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:04,730
The solution that everyone was looking for and struggling with, an eight-year-old child found it.

120
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:08,890
You discovered the method by which a human can live forever.

121
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:17,120
Why did you erase the completed method, when it could have made everyone happy?

122
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,170
If your head only full of that method?

123
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:22,980
You don't feel things like guilt?

124
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,990
Young children who don't yet know anything about the world,

125
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:30,700
their brains exploded and they died painful deaths because of your experiments.

126
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:33,870
Didn't you feel pain as you stood by and watched that happen?

127
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:39,190
Someone who feels pain at seeing lab rats die does not have the right to call himself a scientist.

128
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:45,100
That's fair.

129
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:52,320
Because the lab rat probably doesn't feel pain

130
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,260
at the pain that the scientist would feel.

131
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:11,060
Oh, my car key.

132
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,720
If you kill me, do you think Hye Won will ever forgive you?

133
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,050
I don't want forgiveness.

134
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:21,780
How will your daughter feel if I killed you?

135
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:24,730
She's the one who suffers, and that's why I kept her next to me.

136
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:28,760
Why are you doing this anyway? What meaning does any of this have for you?

137
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:31,610
In this world which is so full of unfairness

138
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:35,650
the only thing that was fair was that everyone lives, then dies.

139
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:40,970
But it turns out, I almost changed that.

140
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:42,820
Think about it.

141
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:47,170
Think about it. If only the powerful people could live forever, what will become of this world?

142
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:49,750
Isn't it appalling just to think about?

143
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:52,660
So tell me. Secret laboratory.

144
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:55,410
And where is the support fund?

145
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,260
Are you alright?

146
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:23,390
I am fine.

147
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:26,550
Find him right now.

148
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,700
Go that way.

149
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:06,010
I left my car key...

150
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:12,130
Where did he go?

151
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:31,350
 Daughter

152
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:33,940
He even left his cell phone behind.

 White Night Biotech Founding 20th Anniversary Celebration

155
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,930
Why is Son Min Ho here?

156
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,750
It feels much better to be the chaser.

157
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:14,560
I was chased for such a long time.

158
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,800
After hearing you speak, I remembered.

159
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:24,220
You were excessively selfish and cliquish. You're Number 113, aren't you?

160
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:26,090
You remember me?

161
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:31,000
Then you must also know what happened there, and everything else. So what are you doing here?

162
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:35,510
Didn't you hear me? What are you doing here?

163
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:37,330
I just chose to stand on the winning side.

164
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:40,680
There's a problem with my brain, too, they said.

165
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:45,060
But they said they they will treat me. And thanks to the medicine you made

166
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:47,160
the headache that I suffered from my entire life disappeared.

167
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,260
So you decided to become their loyal dog, huh?

168
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:51,920
I told you, I just chose to stand on the winning side.

169
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,460
This is always the problem.

170
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:57,610
It's easier if you just convince yourself that the losing side is better.

171
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:34,990
If you want to live your life as a dog, go ahead.

172
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:39,300
Don't speak carelessly. It's not like that.

173
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:53,070
Someone who gave up on the concept of right and wrong. Who could respect him?

174
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:11,120
So that not just anyone can enter the consulting office,

175
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,550
they installed a recognition device.

176
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:17,080
Then there should be a commonality among the dead...

177
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,630
...something like a key.

178
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:29,640
Excuse me?

179
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,200
Look. Are you alright?

180
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,640
Are you alright?

181
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,280
Wake up!

182
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:43,910
Can you hear me? Are you alright?

183
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,020
  Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency

184
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:54,820
 List of Evidence

185
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:04,890
You've come?

186
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:06,210
You're early.

187
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:08,920
Yes, good morning to you too.

188
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:14,430
You look drained already. Well done.

189
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:15,390
Sorry.

190
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:19,580
We were told to stand by while they get rid of the Special Team.

191
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:21,060
What are you doing?

192
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:24,870
Looking for the key, a commonality among the dead.

193
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:30,370
Like a card key or some sort of tag, some sort of digital device.

194
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:37,400
Who is that?!

195
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,040
Someone I know.

196
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:42,710
He's no one to be alarmed about, so let him rest.

197
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:58,050
Didn't I tell  you to bring him at all cost?

198
00:22:58,050 --> 00:23:02,850
If I released the other guys in that situation, I judged that it created the possibility of attracting notice.

199
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,300
- I am sorry. 
 - Judgment?

200
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:11,300
Why would you make a judgment call? It's your job to do whatever you're ordered.

201
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,980
Can't you get that in your head?

202
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:16,520
Don't forget that the foundation is the only thing that can save your life.

203
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,250
Yes.

204
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:23,040
Bring Do Jeong Wu to me. Prove your worth.

205
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,130
Understood.

206
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,900
 Tell me. Secret laboratory.

207
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:52,650
 And where is the support fund?

208
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:57,010
You're eating a lot of candy these days.

209
00:23:57,010 --> 00:24:00,910
If you continue like this, you'll get diabetes and cavities.

210
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:06,110
Cavities and diabetes are preferable to my brain bursting.

211
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:10,520
Always so foolish. So what do you plan to do now?

212
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,900
I have to find the secret laboratory.

213
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:16,610
So where is it?

214
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:18,200
No clue.

215
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:22,120
Isn't that chief researcher or whatever the only person who can tell you?

216
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:24,930
What are you going to do about it?

217
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:28,070
I'll take care of it, so Old Man, just do what I tell you.

218
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:29,780
Did you find the 34-year-old man?

219
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:33,400
This boy, really. It's only been two days since I cut your belly open for surgery.

220
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:36,760
Do I have two bodies? There is only one of me.

221
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,500
But what do we do?

222
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:42,500
You got another task.

223
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,170
What is it this time?

224
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:50,020
A village devoted to human experiments.

225
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:53,310
Children from that village.

226
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:58,540
28 years later, a bunch of cases.

227
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:05,980
And among all those who deserved to die, the one who survived.

228
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:10,030
Former investigator who suffered from dissociative identity disorder.

229
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:15,140
And the guy who sent those forewarning notices.

230
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:23,380
I feel like there's still a piece missing from this puzzle.

231
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:56,370
 Phone

232
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:23,720
Dad? I was worried because I couldn't get in touch.

233
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,010
Ah, I went outside for a bit.

234
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:27,160
Did something happen?

235
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:30,180
Let's talk about it at home.

236
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:56,970
 White Night
 Day and Night

237
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:40,230
 White Night Biotech Founding 20th Anniversary Celebration

238
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:45,220
Son Min Ho isn't in this photo.

239
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,200
 Oh, a new person.

240
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,960
 Look at that, a fingerprint.

241
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,110
 Do you think there may be additional evidence?

242
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,900
Notebook computer.

243
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:23,230
  Shared Love Bazaar

244
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:33,040
This boy only gives me tasks that do not make me look cool.

245
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,100
What brings you here?

246
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:44,270
Ah, hello.

247
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:47,440
I am a new social worker.

248
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:51,360
I came to find out about any jobs as a social worker.

249
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,990
Ah...right this way.

250
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:56,370
Thank you.

251
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:15,000
Eat something before you go.

252
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,250
Mom.

253
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:20,900
- What?
 - In the past, Dadâ€”

254
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:29,440
What about him? Why don't you finish talking?

255
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:33,130
No, nevermind. I'll ask him directly later, don't worry about it.

256
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:35,380
I'm going to work.

257
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:42,850
Why is she doing that? Making me nervous.

258
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:47,230
- Why didn't you answer your phone?! 
 - How did you know about this place?

259
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:48,870
You think this place is a secret?

260
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:52,210
If a freelancer doesn't answer the phone, it means they're not interested in working, don't you know that?

261
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:54,410
You seem to be living well, what?

262
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,970
I have something I need you to look into.

263
00:29:57,970 --> 00:30:02,750
How Dr. Jamie Leighton escaped White Night Village.

264
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:14,930
What is this?

265
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,430
I guess they didn't open the notebook computer yet.

266
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:36,460
Maybe there was no fingerprint match?

267
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:41,070
I feel sure that something in here is related to White Night Village.

268
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:47,640
 The chance of unrelated people having the same fingerprint is one out of 64 billion.

269
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:51,270
 But for machines, due to the limitations of technology, one out of 300,000 times

270
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:54,750
 the machine determines that two different fingerprints are the same.

271
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:01,000
No way.

272
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,020
 Matching Complete

273
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:07,350
That worked?

274
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:33,150
We've agreed to withdraw all the police officers.

275
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:36,040
You're going to pull out all the police officers guarding Son Min Ho?

276
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:40,010
Yes. Well, it doesn't seem like Do Jeong Wu will appear again.

277
00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:45,130
And to commit law enforcement to protect someone like Son Min Ho on a long-term basis,

278
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:47,190
I realize that it appears inappropriate.

279
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,690
Where is this boy and what is up to now?

280
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:54,500
If the Blue House is involved as we suspect,
  (Blue House - Presidential residence)

281
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:58,060
it is better that we don't know, no matter what he is doing.

282
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:08,760
I finally know how many people work in the National Intelligence Service.

283
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:12,040
You always give me tasks that do not make me look cool.

284
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:15,380
So did you find it or not?

285
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:18,100
Oh, all you do is talk while you watch me go to prison.

286
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:22,070
There is no documentation of White Night Foundation being involved in any foster homes.

287
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:24,420
- Of course, that's expected.
 - Is it?

288
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:26,890
I'm disappointed in you, Old Man.

289
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:29,370
But who am I? You know me.

290
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:33,890
Quite a few foster homes are involved with Seoul Hangang Hospital,

291
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:36,740
for which White Night Foundation member Lee Byeong Seon was the director.

292
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:41,190
Wow, there are a lot. You've worked hard.

293
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:44,400
You did well.

294
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:50,570
And Old Man, let me borrow your beat-up car.

295
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:52,430
Thanks.

296
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:42,220
 Attention-Seeker Lee Ji Wuk

297
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:22,420
You're up? How do you feel.

298
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:27,130
It's me.

299
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:30,490
Do you remember last night?

300
00:34:30,490 --> 00:34:34,830
You didn't appear to be physically injured, so I brought you here.

301
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:41,720
This is the police station.

302
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:46,850
And those people are my colleagues.

303
00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:50,710
Lieutenant Yun and Lieutenant Jang.

304
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:52,600
It's alright.

305
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:55,360
Lieutenant Gong Hye Won, where are you?

306
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,360
Who is that guy?

307
00:34:59,010 --> 00:35:00,220
Why are you looking for Lieutenant Gong?

308
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:03,030
Do Jeong Wu, this bastard... !

309
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:07,100
He played with me like a toy.

310
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:13,690
So Reporter Lee Ji Wuk, your informant was actually Staff Captain Do Jeong Wu.

311
00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:15,660
That is not all.

312
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:18,470
Dr. Jamie, Do Jeong Wu had already been looking for you.

313
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,800
You didn't know that, did you?

314
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,630
Look here.

315
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,510
Isn't that amazing?

316
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:34,060
 Female. 36 years old in Korean age.

317
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:36,830
 You said you parted with her 28 years ago and haven't seen her since.

318
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:38,220
 So what value does this drawing have?

319
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:41,990
 From age 8 to 36, she's a completely different person.

320
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:43,950
 No, she's the same.

321
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:53,030
This is a picture he drew only from memory, before he met you.

322
00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:58,740
So now, don't we have some things to talk about?

323
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,150
Go see something.

324
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,690
Hey kids, time to eat.

325
00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:01,550
- Yes.
 - Yes.

326
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:16,590

327
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:19,010
Oh, my head hurts.

328
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:33,190
 Drug Dealer

329
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:35,390
 Customer 1818 (Oh Gyeong Min)

330
00:38:36,410 --> 00:38:39,310
Hyeon Su, I'm saying this because I'm really worried.

331
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:42,560
Instead of buying us these things, hurry and save money for the surgery.

332
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:46,090
If there is more delay, your grandmother can really become much more ill.

333
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:47,800
Yes.

334
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:28,460
 Use this to buy the super car and stop selling drugs.

335
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:30,910
 Continue to study, too.

336
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:48,350
Corrupt policeman.

337
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,840
Oh, what is that?

338
00:39:58,850 --> 00:40:00,350
It's nothing, Granny.

339
00:40:00,350 --> 00:40:04,180
Granny, let's do the operation. We can do it.

340
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:06,820
We don't have the money.

341
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:09,720
Don't worry about the money.

342
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:12,010
Let's hurry and get the operation.

343
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:19,260
 Customer 1818 (Oh Gyeong Min)

344
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:28,950
How much fuel would you like?

345
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,500
- 50,000 won worth, please.
 - Yes, please open the gas tank cover.

346
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:32,600
Yes.

347
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:20,070
 Wanted: murder suspect, Do Jeong Wu, former Staff Captain of the Police

348
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:31,990
Here is your receipt.

349
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:39,380
- Yes, thanks.
 - Yes.

350
00:41:56,610 --> 00:41:59,770
 Tiramisu Latte

351
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:14,640
You can rest here for a bit longer.

352
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:17,790
When I'm done, I'll take you home.

353
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:26,030
Ah, sorry.

354
00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:32,390
As you know, two cases require our attention.

355
00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:34,980
The White Night Village incident from 28 years ago.

356
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:39,770
And including Lee Byeong Seon who was not reported in the press, there are six victims

357
00:42:39,770 --> 00:42:42,770
in the serial killings that appear to be suicides.

358
00:42:42,770 --> 00:42:46,680
According to Son Min Ho, the methods of these two incidents are very similar.

359
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:51,850
So the White Night Village disaster 28 years ago is a result of what someone did, just like the serial killings?

360
00:42:51,850 --> 00:42:54,600
Since the same method was used,

361
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:57,390
wouldn't it likely be that both cases are connected to the same person?

362
00:42:57,390 --> 00:42:58,540
Hold on.

363
00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:04,250
No matter what, that a sixth case exists means that Team Leader can't be the culprit.

364
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:06,870
Let's not conclude that he is the sixth person killed.

365
00:43:06,870 --> 00:43:09,440
Director Lee Byeong Seon's death was not reported to the police

366
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:13,030
so legally, Director Lee Byeong Seon is still alive, in a special room at the Seoul Hangang Hospital.

367
00:43:13,030 --> 00:43:16,500
- So that means he could really still be alive.
 - What?

368
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:19,290
How did you even get on this special team?

369
00:43:19,290 --> 00:43:23,910
Let's organize our findings so far.

370
00:43:23,910 --> 00:43:28,750
First, seeing how the methods of these two incidents are similar according to Son Min Ho

371
00:43:28,750 --> 00:43:31,380
these killings are related to the White Night Village disaster.

372
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:37,800
So the conclusion is that the culprit of these killings is one of the people from White Night Village.

373
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:42,680
And the person who sent the forewarning notices and the person who sent the death videos are not the same person.

374
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:48,170
So that would mean that there is a high possibility that the person who sent the death videos is the culprit.

375
00:43:48,170 --> 00:43:51,090
Seeing how the forewarning notices stopped after Staff Captain Do was arrested

376
00:43:51,090 --> 00:43:55,450
that apparently means that Staff Captain Do sent the notices.

377
00:43:55,450 --> 00:43:59,620
I knew it wasn't our team leader.

378
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:01,440
But that doesn't make him innocent.

379
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:04,400
If he just told people about the killings, he could have saved them.

380
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:07,800
So why did he bother sending those notices?

381
00:44:08,330 --> 00:44:12,410
Anyway, if neither I nor Do Jeong Wu are the criminal,

382
00:44:12,410 --> 00:44:16,930
that means the third child is the culprit we're looking for.

383
00:44:16,930 --> 00:44:20,170
That reminds me, Do Jeong Wu told my source...

384
00:44:20,170 --> 00:44:25,460
No, I mean he told his source to find a girl and a boy.

385
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:27,210
The girl turned out to be Jamie Leighton,

386
00:44:27,210 --> 00:44:31,690
but don't know who that boy is, only that he is now 34 years old.

387
00:44:31,690 --> 00:44:35,630
When I look back, I'm certain he suspected me in the beginning.

388
00:44:35,630 --> 00:44:38,160
  What's the real reason you came to Korea?

389
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:43,170
 You were successful in the U.S. The chief of the criminal psychology lab.

390
00:44:43,170 --> 00:44:46,730
 I heard that when people start to get killed in the U.S., it's usually more than 10.

391
00:44:46,730 --> 00:44:50,500
 So why did you come all the way to such a small country like Korea to pay attention to such an insignificant case?

392
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:54,760
 Why were you surprised when the video of the next victim was released?

393
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:58,280
 To be honest, I did find you suspicious.

394
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:00,220
From the very start, Staff Captain Do

395
00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:03,970
was looking for the culprit of these serial killers.

396
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:10,540
We need to find this man.

397
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:13,330
We have to know something in order to find him.

398
00:45:13,330 --> 00:45:16,690
This third child from White Night Village

399
00:45:16,690 --> 00:45:19,790
probably has some damage to his brain.

400
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:23,200
Just like Staff Captain Do Jeong Wu and me.

401
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:29,980
And he'll have a special power.

402
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:36,630
She found out only now?

403
00:45:54,090 --> 00:45:56,960
So there is some damage to my brain?

 Seoul Hangang Foster Home

405
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:48,870
What are you doing, kids?

406
00:46:48,870 --> 00:46:50,420
Who are you, mister?

407
00:46:50,420 --> 00:46:52,910
Me? Just someone passing by.

408
00:46:52,910 --> 00:46:56,210
Then go on your merry way!

409
00:46:57,010 --> 00:47:00,470
The way kids play is the same as it was 30 years ago.

410
00:47:00,470 --> 00:47:04,800
But don't kids these days play computer games or smartphone games?

411
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:07,610
We can only play those when Teacher permits us to.

412
00:47:07,610 --> 00:47:10,770
And there aren't that many computers, so we can't play a lot.

413
00:47:10,770 --> 00:47:12,570
I see.

414
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:17,650
What's wrong? You look angry about something.

415
00:47:17,650 --> 00:47:22,560
His best friend left yesterday with his new family.

416
00:47:23,570 --> 00:47:24,600
Family?

417
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:27,970
There are a lot who find a new family.

418
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:30,930
Sometimes two or three leave at once.

419
00:47:30,930 --> 00:47:35,200
No! They don't go to a new family; they go to the hospital!

420
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:39,410
If they tell me that they're taking me to a hospital, I won't go, I am too scared.

421
00:47:39,410 --> 00:47:43,830
The teachers are lying, stupid!

422
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:51,850
Mister!

423
00:47:51,850 --> 00:47:54,130
You look really sad, mister.

424
00:47:54,130 --> 00:47:56,370
I have a pitch-black look in my eyes, you mean?

425
00:47:56,370 --> 00:47:59,940
What?  What is 'pitch-black?'

426
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:02,040
There is such a thing.

427
00:50:00,070 --> 00:50:02,090
Dad?

428
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:14,230
 White Night Biotech Founding 20th Anniversary Celebration

429
00:51:02,340 --> 00:51:03,700
If you've come, can't you make some noise or something?

430
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:06,960
Should I sing loudly while coming here to sell illegal drugs?

431
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:10,640
 Can't you make some noise as you come?

432
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:14,050
 Should I sing loudly while coming here to buy illegal drugs?

433
00:51:14,050 --> 00:51:16,040
Why are you so petty?

434
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:18,370
Ah, forget it. Just hand me the drugs.

435
00:51:18,370 --> 00:51:20,110
Because I'm petty, I won't give you any.

436
00:51:20,110 --> 00:51:21,020
What? Just give it to me!

437
00:51:21,020 --> 00:51:22,740
Hurry and give me the drugs, you bastard.

438
00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:26,020
I don't sell drugs anymore. I'm going to buy a super car.

439
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:29,150
I never wanted to sell drugs to losers like you in the first place.

440
00:51:29,150 --> 00:51:32,980
But when people have nothing, they have to at least have such mental victories.

441
00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:36,220
 You are acting so arrogant while being used?

442
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:40,370
When people have nothing, I hear they have to have those mental victories at least, to survive.

443
00:51:40,370 --> 00:51:42,330
Goodbye.

444
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:50,120
And for your health, stop taking drugs.

445
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:59,200
You sh*tbag beggar!

446
00:52:10,610 --> 00:52:13,290
 Dad, please help me.

447
00:52:45,090 --> 00:52:48,960
 Dad

448
00:53:41,340 --> 00:53:43,740
Just what is going on?

449
00:54:04,250 --> 00:54:08,140
 In order to draw the attention of people, you are good at drawing out someone's wrongdoing

450
00:54:08,140 --> 00:54:13,830
 and instigating people in a stimulating way. But I think that you, Reporter Lee Ji Wuk,

451
00:54:13,830 --> 00:54:16,480
 are good at something else, too.

452
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:22,900
Isn't it about time for you to drop out?

453
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:26,170
You're not a Korean police officer. And there's nothing you want.

454
00:54:26,170 --> 00:54:30,240
Who said that there's nothing I want?

455
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:33,710
 You said the person who saved you was a monster?

456
00:54:35,390 --> 00:54:38,480
 That monster is me.

457
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:43,980
I need to find out my relationship with the monster.

458
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:02,450
Already gone...

00:59:08,970 --> 00:59:11,930
 Did you find that 34 year old man? He is the culprit.

476
00:59:11,930 --> 00:59:15,340
 - Let's just kill them all. 
 - Number 112, Jamie Leighton.

477
00:59:15,340 --> 00:59:16,840
 Now I will go directly to find it.

478
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:19,430
 The third child was by my side already.

479
00:59:19,430 --> 00:59:21,670
 I think it might be related to the White Night Village.

480
00:59:21,670 --> 00:59:24,480
 I better visit the White Night Village.

481
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:28,710
 Do you finally see the end?
