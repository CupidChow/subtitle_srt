1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:08,930

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,020
 Awaken

3
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:06,590
How did he know I live here?

4
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,250
- What brings you here at this hour?
 - I have something to show you.

5
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:14,640
It's about White Night Village.

6
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,130
Where is Oh Gyeong Min right now?

7
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:21,450
Tell me where the secret laboratory is.

8
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:27,860
Hye Won. Sometimes, it's better to just not know anything.

9
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:32,290
Oh Jeong Hwan is a much more dangerous person than you realize.

10
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:36,230
So hurry and return his son. I am requesting you, as your father.

11
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:39,180
- Don't do such dangerous work.
 - Dad.

12
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,690
I told you so many times, Do Jeong Wu is trying to use you.

13
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:44,800
This has nothing to do with Team Leader.

14
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,020
It's not too late, Dad.

15
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:52,380
Even now, please correct what is wrong.

16
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,310
Looks like we don't have anything more to talk about.

17
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:19,600
Here, take a look.

18
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:23,560
For the founding of the White Night Village project,

19
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,180
he was the miliary officer most deeply involved,  Lieutenant General Yu Gwon.

20
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:29,450
I remember reading about him before during my research.

21
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:33,010
He is one of those who disappeared after the day of disaster.

22
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:35,730
- And there are no records of his death.
 - Right.

23
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:37,600
And this,

24
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:42,480
The predecessor of White Night Biotech, White Night Biotechnology Research Lab.

25
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,600
That's a photo from the opening ceremony. Lieutenant General Yu Gwon is in that photo.

26
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,180
 White Night Biotechnology Research Lab Opening Ceremony

27
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:53,640
Yes, he is. So what about him?

28
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,820
Do you know who Lieutenant General Yu Gwon's son-in-law is?

29
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,600
President's Chief of Staff, Oh Jeong Hwan.

30
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:07,060
The strange thing is that no matter how I try, it is impossible to get any information about Chief of Staff Oh Jeong Hwan's past.

31
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:09,820
His profile released to the media is all of it.

32
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:14,770
If he's the Chief of Staff of the President, can't anyone access it using the Freedom of Information Act?

33
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:18,320
Exactly. It means he has something to hide.

34
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:31,110
In that case, it's not strange that his son became the target of a forewarned murder.

35
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:40,680
Was that forewarning notice mailed to you, by any chance?

36
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,330
It came by registered mail. Why?

37
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,860
Lieutenant Gong.

38
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,670
- We meet again.
 - What's going on?

39
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,530
 Awaken

40
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:18,850
 Episode 14

41
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:54,260
What do you think you're doing?

42
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:58,160
Did you really think I would tell you the location of the secret laboratory so easily?

43
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,440
You're not going to take your son?

44
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,600
I can't turn over in one moment something that I've protected my entire life.

45
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,830
Team Leader!

46
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,110
Were you surprised?

47
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:46,100
Seeing you surprised, it appears that you two do have a special relationship.

48
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,650
So send my son to me now.

49
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:08,420
Does Dr. Gong Il Do know that you've kidnapped his daughter?

50
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:11,520
Stop talking and give me my son!

51
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:15,380
Give me Lieutenant Gong first.

52
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:20,140
Oh, didn't Oh Gyeong Min recently receive psychological treatment?

53
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:24,510
That psychologist is a serial killer.

54
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:30,110
You didn't know? But Mr. Son, you already knew that.

55
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:32,560
Why didn't you tell him?

56
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:38,410
Hurry and let Oh Gyeong Min go this way.

57
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:44,530
I will.

58
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,270
Let Lieutenant Gong go at the same time.

59
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,790
Get them!

60
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,930
They're hunting guns.

61
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:28,870
It's been so long since they were used. But thankfully, the shooting skills have not gotten rusty.

62
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:32,990
Do you think I came all this way without at least that much preparation?

63
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:36,830
I don't know where they are shooting from.

64
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:39,030
So if you can avoid them, move immediately.

65
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:41,720
What are you doing? Hurry and get them!

66
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:51,260
I earned a reward vacation of five days and four nights in the military due to my excellent shooting skills.

67
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:55,100
Look at me doing all sorts of things because of this boy.

68
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:58,220
Why can't I see them?

69
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:43,140
I'm sorry. I should have been more careful.

70
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:47,120
- You're not hurt anywhere?
 - I'm fine.

71
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,110
That's good enough, then.

72
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:55,590
 Corner 24 Convenience Store

73
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:09,000
 We ran into each other often at this convenience store.

74
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,400
 That means he definitely lives nearby.

75
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:17,400
 But it's surrounded by residential areas, so it won't be easy to find exactly where.

76
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:41,940
What happened to the Special Team's offices?

77
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:45,260
Ah, you startled me. How about knocking, Doctor?

78
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:46,980
Isn't this basic manners in the U.S.?

79
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,380
I apologize.

80
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,840
I went to the Special Team offices but they were empty.

81
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,780
Didn't they disband the Special Team?

82
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:56,980
The Superior Office gave the orders to clear the offices, too.

83
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:59,710
The forewarned murders case is not over.

84
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:02,290
And to suddenly clear everything out without even telling me

85
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:04,490
"Command and discipline."

86
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:08,890
If the higher authority commands, you must obey. Isn't that how police organizations work?

87
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:12,240
Hasn't it been enough time for you to adjust to Korean society by now?

88
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,390
Where are Lieutenants Yun and Jang right now?

89
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:19,450
 Communal Life Department

90
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:25,510
- Dr. Jamie.
 - Doctor.

91
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:26,760
What happened?

92
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,670
We came in the morning, and they already moved out everything.

93
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,270
We are still on standby.

94
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:33,330
There wasn't any time for us to do anything about it. If I knew this would happen, I would have at least taken pictures.

95
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:37,320
It seems someone higher up is quite anxious.

96
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:41,770
Although our offices are gone, we still have to catch the culprit, don't we?

97
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:44,360
Ah, yes.

98
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:54,570
- Team Leader.
 - Yes, what?

99
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:58,910
You brought me to the Special Team because of my dad, didn't you?

100
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:03,690
I saw the glasses.

101
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:11,180
That was true at first. But many things have changed since then.

102
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:14,080
I never imagined that Jang Ji Wan would be involved, too.

103
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,520
I don't think it's necessary for us to inform Lieutenant Jang

104
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:19,940
about Director Lee Byeong Seon's death, for now

105
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:24,930
What do you plan to do now?

106
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,080
You know the area that we searched the other day?

107
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:31,490
There is a spot that is definitely suspiciousâ€”

108
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,450
Team Leader? Team Leader?

109
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,930
- Team Leader, are you alright?
 - What?

110
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:46,020
Jeong Wu! Do Jeong Wu!

111
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:49,050
- Team Leader.
 - What's wrong? Hey!

112
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:54,330
- Old Man.
 - Yes, talk.

113
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:00,120
Back there, I was scared that you would shoot me, Old Man. I'm fine.

114
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:03,630
Oh, this boy, really...

115
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:14,660
Are you alright?

116
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,710
Yes, I'm fine.

117
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:21,160
We don't have much time. We have to find it soon.

118
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:24,520
You remember the convenience store where we all first met, don't you?

119
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:28,470
It's the same convenience store where I met the third child often. Right here.

120
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:32,030
Seeing the way he was dressed, and how he was wearing slippers,

121
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:33,990
I think that he probably lives nearby.

122
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:37,960
But there are too many residences for us to figure out exactly where he lives.

123
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:41,550
The forewarning sent to Reporter Lee Ji Wuk was sent by registered mail.

124
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:45,570
So if you examine this barcode, the post office, date and time,

125
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:47,570
we can at least figure out that much.

126
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:49,480
And you can get CCTV videos in this area, can't you?

127
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,420
I understand.

128
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:09,460
What is this? Who are they?

129
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,180
What do we do?

130
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,370
Alright. Come on out.

131
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:38,310
It's not good for us to breathe this much. Hurry and get out.

132
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,230
Hey! Jeong Wu!

133
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:52,280
Let's go together.

134
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,710
They're not chasing us.

135
00:14:56,990 --> 00:15:00,810
I lost my consciousness when they abducted me. I think that's when they put that in.

136
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:04,520
Oh Jeong Hwan used his brain a bit.

137
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:07,700
And he must have felt quite desperate to mobilize the military as well.

138
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:10,380
Why is he going this far to capture you?

139
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:14,200
Maybe because I know a secret that no one else knows?

140
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,280
Are you alright, Old Man?

141
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,760
But you've lost your home. What to do?

142
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:21,050
Since the day you rolled in here

143
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:23,650
I had a feeling that something like this would happen someday.

144
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:25,600
I've endured here longer than I thought.

145
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,910
So what will you do now?

146
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:29,140
Do you not know how I've survived until now?

147
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:33,530
Don't worry and stay away from me. I'll contact you.

148
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:35,330
Old Man.

149
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:38,910
Be careful.

150
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,340
We don't know when they might invade again.

151
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:48,820
We will need a place to hide.

152
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:54,430
I know the safest place. And I have a request to make, too.

153
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:56,130
Let's go.

154
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:01,960
I understand.

155
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:07,770
I am speechless.

156
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:10,460
Just be grateful that my son is safe.

157
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:12,000
If he was not,

158
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,480
I would be looking at your corpse right now.

159
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:21,680
I just thought that we could catch both Do Jeong Wu and the third child.

160
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:27,200
I think it would be best for you to catch even just one of them as soon as possible.

161
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:49,000
- Ask Son Min Ho to meet.
 - Me?

162
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,110
For now, just ask him to come to the company. I will do the rest.

163
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:54,960
Alright.

164
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:20,420
 Jang Yong Sik

165
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,760
What is the matter?

166
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:30,190
Moon Jae Wung told me to ask you to come to the company at 9 p.m. tomorrow night.

167
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:32,750
- So is it my turn now?
 - I don't know.

168
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:35,440
He said that he will do the rest.

169
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,260
I understand.

170
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:44,520
Am I really being used as bait?

171
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:49,780
To catch a monster, that's a good way to do it.

172
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:00,470
I am so relieved.

173
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:04,320
Nothing must happen to you.

174
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,800
Because you are my future.

175
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:44,360
It's becoming progressively worse.

176
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:59,700
This was the Director's home?

177
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,520
Do Jeong Wu, you!

178
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,890
Director, have you been well?

179
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:07,000
What a nice home.

180
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:12,050
A 1440 sq. feet sized home in the middle of Gangnam District.

181
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:14,740
And you live alone.

182
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:17,570
This is the life, indeed.

183
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:20,510
What are you doing here?

184
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:22,940
The home of the high-ranking executive member

185
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,110
of the Police Agency who hates me the most, is there any place safer?

186
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:29,800
Even White Night Foundation probably wouldn't look for me here.

187
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:33,570
What did you two do with Oh Gyeong Min?

188
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:37,950
Wow, you sure are concerned about a lot of things.

189
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:41,850
He returned safely to his parents. Although not in the way that I wanted.

190
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:43,990
What is your plan from now on?

191
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:46,010
My plan...

192
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:55,450
Here is the rest of Son Min Ho's slush fund.

193
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:58,120
You can collect it, or

194
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,740
you can put it in your personal pocket, like this.

195
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:06,040
Do what you want with that.

196
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:09,550
Son Min Ho's slush fund?

197
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:11,140
Then...

198
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:13,100
 - He's the problem.
 Architect

199
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:16,020
 Ah, we have to get the one at the top.

200
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:20,180
So the Architect of the serial bank robberies that you guys at the Special Team were looking so hard for

201
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:22,100
was Do Jeong Wu.

202
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,230
And you knew that?

203
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:26,030
I only found out recently.

204
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:28,490
But why is this so important?

205
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:32,800
Let's make a deal. It's not a bad deal. Let us hide here for a while.

206
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:39,070
Is that the only reason you came to see me?

207
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:43,700
No.

208
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,100
Since you made a deal with Son Min Ho

209
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:51,600
you should know enough about what happened in White Night Village.

210
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,600
Those experiments have continued.

211
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:57,720
The experiments in which children are sacrificed.

212
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:58,840
What are you talking about?

213
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:02,580
I'm sure you already had an idea, but the police

214
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:06,620
and a large number of the leadership of Korea are connected to this matter.

215
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:08,900
Kim Chang Gu, Commissioner of the National Police Agency is involved, too.

216
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:13,020
And the President's Chief of Staff Oh Jeong Hwan is a key member.

217
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:17,040
And what I requested last time, regarding the monitoring of the welfare centers, the truth is that

218
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:22,330
it was for the purpose of cutting off the supply of children used for these experiments.

219
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:27,000
Experiments in which children are sacrificed for the purpose of prolonging their lives.

220
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,320
Shouldn't we stop that? Director?

221
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:42,370
So what do you want me to do?

222
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,500
You've come?

223
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:53,770
I think we should hurry and get rid of the failed experiment subjects.

224
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:56,240
I understand. I will have it done soon.

225
00:22:56,330 --> 00:23:01,110
I don't know when these two children will fail.

226
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:07,430
My aging is accelerating.

227
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:11,280
My aging begins even before it's time for me to take the medicine.

228
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:15,580
Not to mention, there isn't much medicine left.

229
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:19,040
We need more test subjects with explosive power.

230
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:23,590
In that case, we need more serum from children who are younger than 14 years old.

231
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:27,410
If we cannot get that, secondary to the experiments,

232
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:31,190
we can no longer produce the medicine that you are currently taking.

233
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:34,830
And if you do not take the medicine every six hours

234
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:38,320
your aging will increase exponentially.

235
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:42,670
So we must obtain more test subjects even risking the danger.

236
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:49,740
What is that?

237
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:53,330
Perhaps the serum of the children who were experimented on at White Night Village

238
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:56,510
can be used.

239
00:23:56,510 --> 00:24:00,230
If we can minimize the side effects that appeared back then

240
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:04,790
we can use the serum from those children for the time being.

241
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,950
Oh, you've come?

242
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:19,030
Yes.

243
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:22,710
I tried very hard to persuade my daughter

244
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:25,690
but I couldn't get through to her. I am sorry.

245
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:28,790
- I found my son.
 - Oh, that is a relief. How?

246
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:34,690
As we expected, Do Jeong Wu tried to use my son to find this place.

247
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:40,610
So I brought your daughter and exchanged her for my son.

248
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:45,300
What do you mean you brought her there? Did you abduct her?

249
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:48,980
Are you saying that It's okay for your daughter to abduct my son

250
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:52,700
but I cannot abduct your daughter?

251
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:55,390
Your daughter took my son

252
00:24:55,390 --> 00:25:00,240
so she should be responsible for this matter, shouldn't she?

253
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:08,310
Where is my daughter?

254
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:11,530
I'm sure Do Jeong Wu is taking good care of her.

255
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:37,740
Anxious?

256
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:38,830
Huh?

257
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:41,990
Eating something sweet is the best thing when you are anxious.

258
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:44,300
Want my candy?

259
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,450
Then don't have any.

260
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:51,870
What's with you?

261
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,700
You're worried about your dad, huh?

262
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:03,690
I thought we'd both agreed to do the right thing, but it's not easy.

263
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:07,040
If it's so easy, would that be family?

264
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:11,190
What's with that look on your face?

265
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:14,480
I feel like you're thinking, "What do you know? You don't even have a family."

266
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,160
But you do have family.

267
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:27,150
You keep this.

268
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:31,600
Why are you giving this to me?

269
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,100
You know, since we're gotten on the same boat, a commemoration ...

270
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:37,300
no, I mean, just a gift. Just keep it.

271
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:12,460
 Those experiments have continued. The experiments in which children are sacrificed.

272
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:16,260
 I'm sure you already had an idea, but the police

273
00:27:16,290 --> 00:27:19,450
 and a large number of the leadership of Korea are connected to this matter.

274
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,880
 Kim Chang Gu, Commissioner of the National Police Agency is involved, too.

275
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:25,800
 And the President's Chief of Staff Oh Jeong Hwan is a key member.

276
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:33,960
What is it?

277
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:35,860
I'll get to the point.

278
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:37,080
Please tell me.

279
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:41,550
Tonight at 9 p.m. the forewarned murders culprit will appear at MODU headquarters.

280
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:43,430
The real culprit of the forewarned murders?

281
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:45,920
He will probably try to kill me.

282
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:50,940
So you can just not go there, can't you?

283
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,790
I am making myself the bait.

284
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:56,690
And you reason for telling me is?

285
00:27:57,970 --> 00:28:02,030
An innocent citizen is saying that he is receiving threats of murder.

286
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:05,070
The police wouldn't just stand by and watch, would they?

287
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:13,840
Son Min Ho called.

288
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,190
Tonight at 9 p.m. at MODU headquarters

289
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:18,570
the real culprit of the forewarned murders will appear.

290
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:20,390
To kill him.

291
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:22,620
Ah, is that so?

292
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:26,160
Wow, that was worth the money. Thanks.

293
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,760
I will go there, too.

294
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:31,050
Yes, I understand. See you there.

295
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:37,060
Lock the door properly behind you.

296
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,290
 Based on the materials we've gathered so far

297
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:44,660
 White Night Village project appears to be

298
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:48,630
 an enormous project involving the government.

299
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:54,050
 White Night Village, a utopia where children were communally raised and a cure-all medication was produced.

300
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:58,220
 But communally raising children was only a nice slogan for the public.

301
00:28:58,290 --> 00:29:03,490
 But what if they were really doing experiments with a different purpose?

302
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:09,510
 And what if those experiments were human experiments in which children were used?

303
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:13,000
 Even just imagining it is appalling.

304
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:18,260
 The exact truth has yet to be discovered, but what is the hidden conspiracy of White Night Village

305
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:25,560
 and who is at its center? I will search until the end and tell you the whole truth.

306
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:29,950
 Taking one step closer to current events, this has been Lee Ji Wuk of Current Events Zoom-In

307
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:16,910
Will the third child really kill Son Min Ho?

308
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:19,530
Isn't this a trap to try and get you?

309
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:23,760
He failed at killing Oh Gyeong Min and Dr. Jamie and I defeated him, too.

310
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:27,760
So this time, he is sure to go after the White Night Foundation people.

311
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:31,900
- But I still can't believe it.
 - Believe what?

312
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:36,750
That you were the Architect of the serial bank robberies that we were searching so hard for.

313
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:40,580
By the way, do you need money? I have lots of money hidden away, do you want some?

314
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:42,020
No thanks.

315
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:45,970
I'm just shocked because I never even imagined it.

316
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,290
You are being chased by a serial killer. Why would you be shocked by that?

317
00:30:50,290 --> 00:30:52,200
Director Lee wouldn't report us, will she?

318
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:55,740
She is someone who is very dedicated to acting in her own self-interest, isn't she?

319
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:59,410
So in a case like this, as long as we deliver our end of the bargain,

320
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:02,620
she could be the most trustworthy person for us.

321
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:06,640
Where do we go now?

322
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,300
To the Old Man.

323
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:09,890
The LP shop was blown up.

324
00:31:09,890 --> 00:31:13,760
Old Man is no ordinary old man. Do you still not know that?

325
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:26,200
What is all this? Where did everyone go?

326
00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:30,440
- Hyeong, our program was shut down.
 - What?

327
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:34,500
I just heard that they said to immediately cancel our program during a meeting of the executives.

328
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,050
What are you talking about?

329
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:39,320
Looks like there was pressure from some higher-ups who were bothered by us.

330
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:42,850
I still have so much of my housing deposit loan left to pay.

331
00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:45,790
Are we all getting fired now, Hyeong?

332
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:49,760
So this is how they're going to play it? It's inflaming my competitive streak.

333
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,400
Thank you.

334
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:55,310
Yes, Doctor, we got the CCTV videos.

335
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:58,740
Sounds good. I'll be going to the police station now.

336
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:14,860
I think this is the place.

337
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:18,920
Let's go.

338
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:21,540
 Eight Provinces Employment Agency

339
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:24,150
I'm here to get a job.

340
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:28,120
You found me.

341
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:30,010
Where is this place? Are you sure it's safe?

342
00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:32,120
People will be coming in and out.

343
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:35,100
Appearing as an ordinary place is the truth disguise.

344
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:37,650
Did you get the thing I asked you for?

345
00:32:37,650 --> 00:32:39,430
Of course.

346
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:43,710
That confidence of yours.

347
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:53,530
This is one of those places where the emergency generator was activated.

348
00:32:53,530 --> 00:32:55,310
Didn't you say that there wasn't much to that?

349
00:32:55,310 --> 00:33:00,820
Why would an industrial-sized emergency generator be installed where only dead people allegedly are?

350
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:02,280
It is more suspicious, the more I think about it.

351
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:05,640
Aside from bringing dead people back to life, what else would be their purpose?

352
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,910
You're right.

353
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:10,720
If the secret laboratory was here, where would it be hidden?

354
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,030
Someone where they wouldn't be easily seen.

355
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:15,920
Somewhere they wouldn't be seen.

356
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:19,550
There is only one stairway that leads to the underground so that means

357
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:21,220
the secret laboratory must be under here somewhere.

358
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:22,540
You should go to MODU first.

359
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:25,480
The police will be staking the place out, so assess the situation and contact me.

360
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:28,200
- What about you, Team Leader?
 - Me?

361
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:32,560
I better go visit this memorial park.

362
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:35,700
If the third child is targeting Son Min Ho tonight at MODU

363
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:39,890
everyone from White Night Foundation including Oh Jeong Hwan will be occupied with that situation.

364
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:44,990
I must use that time

365
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:47,310
to find the secret laboratory.

366
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:07,800
Why is he going in there?

367
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:08,780
What is it?

368
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:10,970
Please look at this.

369
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:17,670
Why is he going into the MODU building so late at night?

370
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:21,330
I know. It doesn't seem like he's going to work there.

371
00:34:21,330 --> 00:34:24,350
We better go there now.

372
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,130
What about Son Min Ho?

373
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:34,850
He's coming at the time you told him to.

374
00:39:36,770 --> 00:39:39,660
What are you going to do? Are you really going to kill him?

375
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:43,520
Why? Are you scared now?

376
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,800
It's not that.

377
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,890
It isn't my first time killing someone.

378
00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:52,210
Drink some of your favorite liquor and loosen up.

379
00:39:53,010 --> 00:39:55,400
I'll take care of everything myself.

380
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:23,690
He's going in now so keep watch on him.

381
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:21,320
In the end, you came this far.

382
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:27,140
Did you know this was the secret laboratory?

383
00:41:28,210 --> 00:41:31,870
I found out just now that this was a laboratory.

384
00:41:31,870 --> 00:41:36,030
Before, I came a few times to the memorial park with Chief of Staff Oh Jeong Hwan.

385
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:38,090
But I always waited in the parking garage.

386
00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:41,840
He always went inside alone.

387
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:45,430
Then do you know where they moved the secret laboratory from here?

388
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:47,490
I don't know yet.

389
00:41:47,490 --> 00:41:52,320
Because they left here in a rush, it seems to be taking time to set up the new laboratory.

390
00:41:57,740 --> 00:42:01,860
By the way, why did you

391
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:06,310
come all this way?

392
00:42:53,430 --> 00:42:55,480
Doctor!

393
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:57,580
Lieutenant Gong.

394
00:42:57,580 --> 00:42:59,440
Why are you here?

395
00:43:00,410 --> 00:43:04,440
At 9pm, the third child is supposedly going to kill Son Min Ho here.

396
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:05,200
What did you say?

397
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:08,200
Then it wasn't a coincidence that the third child entered this building.

398
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:09,550
What do you plan to do?

399
00:43:09,550 --> 00:43:11,930
Let's go up quickly first.

400
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:45,300
It's almost 9 pm.

401
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:47,340
You're right.

402
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:55,110
What's wrong?

403
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:01,070
The reaction should slowly be kicking in by now.

404
00:44:01,070 --> 00:44:03,080
What reaction?

405
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:20,130
Have you forgotten why I've been trying to kill Do Jeong Wu and Jamie this whole time?

406
00:44:20,130 --> 00:44:23,680
They're people who abandoned me to save themselves.

407
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:26,940
Did you really think I didn't know that you were in communication with Son Min Ho?

408
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:29,360
I just wanted to live.

409
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:32,210
I made this company for you.

410
00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:36,330
I gave you plenty of wealth and power that you would be envious of no one.

411
00:44:36,330 --> 00:44:40,420
Was it not enough? And you claim that you just want to live?

412
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:46,530
Since I ran away from White Night Village, my existence was not living.

413
00:44:46,530 --> 00:44:50,300
I didn't know when you would kill me.

414
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:52,920
Okay. I'll let you go now.

415
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:54,850
Farewell.

416
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:02,410
What are you guys?

417
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:59,770
Team 3, follow all the cars leaving the building this instant.

418
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:12,280
- What is this?
 - What brings you all here at this hour?

419
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:14,640
Did anything happen?

420
00:47:15,450 --> 00:47:17,880
Supposedly the third child was going to kill you.

421
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:19,230
Word spreads fast.

422
00:47:19,230 --> 00:47:25,210
Yes, I heard that he was targeting me, so I came here to become the bait.

423
00:47:25,210 --> 00:47:28,240
How rude of him to not show up at the appointment time.

424
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:29,880
Who did you hear that from?

425
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:35,790
Jang Yong Sik, the CEO of MODU who lived with the third child,

426
00:47:35,790 --> 00:47:38,670
said I would be the next target.

427
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:44,450
Director.

428
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:48,070
Is everything alright?

429
00:47:49,570 --> 00:47:53,640
How did you guys find out about this?

430
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:58,870
I didn't know so many people would be interested if I died. I'm grateful.

431
00:47:58,870 --> 00:48:00,700
I don't think you'll die anytime soon.

432
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:02,690
Just a while ago, a few cars left in a hurry.

433
00:48:02,690 --> 00:48:05,110
- To where?
 - We lost them.

434
00:48:05,110 --> 00:48:06,850
Keep searching.

435
00:48:06,850 --> 00:48:09,560
- Don't miss anything, search thoroughly.
 - Yes.

436
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:13,680
This person... Jang Yong Sik.

437
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:23,240
These are the people who escaped with us on the day of the disaster at White Night Village.

438
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:25,830
Just imagine, he was living with the third child.

439
00:48:25,830 --> 00:48:28,900
CEO Jang Yong Sik is also a survivor of White Night Village?

440
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:33,550
He was not involved in the experiments. He just did various chores.

441
00:48:33,550 --> 00:48:35,610
Then...

442
00:48:35,610 --> 00:48:41,670
The third child's living quarters is definitely inside this building.

443
00:48:50,570 --> 00:48:54,020
 Restricted Zone

444
00:49:19,170 --> 00:49:21,990
Go, go!

445
00:49:31,170 --> 00:49:33,000
He's dead.

446
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:42,730
It looks like they've been staying here this whole time.

447
00:49:42,730 --> 00:49:45,640
Seems like someone drugged his alcohol.

448
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:50,470
Was it fun messing around with my son?

449
00:50:50,470 --> 00:50:52,250
So your child is precious to you, huh?

450
00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:56,780
Moon Jae Wung. The third child survivor from the White Night Village.

451
00:50:56,780 --> 00:51:01,290
You've never had a job. There is no record of any credit card use.

452
00:51:01,290 --> 00:51:03,510
Your Citizen ID is fake.

453
00:51:03,510 --> 00:51:07,200
I've only seen one other person with the same record as you.

454
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:09,390
Probably Do Jeong Wu.

455
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:12,930
What was your reason for killing so many Directors of the Foundation?

456
00:51:12,930 --> 00:51:17,240
I'm sure you'll know if you think about the things you've done in the White Night Village.

457
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:19,960
So was it for revenge?

458
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:22,030
Revenge?

459
00:51:24,150 --> 00:51:27,610
My life was ruined from the very start because of you guys.

460
00:51:27,610 --> 00:51:31,430
We fed you, gave you a place to sleep, and even taught you.

461
00:51:31,430 --> 00:51:34,860
Has it ever occurred to you that you received more than you deserved given your circumstance?

462
00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:39,730
I didn't even expect parental love, which all young children are entitled to.

463
00:51:39,730 --> 00:51:42,320
The life that I could have had,

464
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:46,120
laughing and playing like other normal kids,

465
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:49,070
was made like this by you.

466
00:51:55,690 --> 00:52:00,840
It was interesting how you killed the Directors of the Foundation using those forewarnings.

467
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:07,170
To kill others without lifting a finger. Very fresh and original.

468
00:52:07,170 --> 00:52:10,250
I should have ended your son's life that way, too.

469
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:17,470
Where is CEO Jang Yong Sik?

470
00:52:21,370 --> 00:52:24,250
Did you kill him? What a shame.

471
00:52:24,250 --> 00:52:28,000
He wanted to escape from you so much.

472
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:33,800
 The third child from White Night Village is the real culprit of those forewarned murders.

473
00:52:35,020 --> 00:52:38,130
 So he is also the one who tried to kill my son.

474
00:52:38,130 --> 00:52:40,360
 His living quarters are in the basement of the MODU building.

475
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:42,810
 Basement of the MODU building.

476
00:52:44,020 --> 00:52:46,110
 I never imagined he would be living there.

477
00:52:46,110 --> 00:52:51,270
 He will kill Son Min Ho in the CEO office of the MODU building.

478
00:52:51,270 --> 00:52:53,810
 You should get to him before then.

479
00:52:54,770 --> 00:52:57,110
 What is your reason for telling me this?

480
00:52:57,110 --> 00:52:59,920
 I want to finally escape from him.

481
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:04,640
So he secretly communicated with you, too. He struggled to find a way to survive somehow.

482
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:08,620
You should become the subject of the experiment earlier.

483
00:53:08,620 --> 00:53:11,110
You've lived too long.

484
00:53:18,370 --> 00:53:23,190
 Perhaps we can use the serum of the children who were experimented on at White Night Village.

485
00:53:23,190 --> 00:53:26,670
 If we can minimize the side effects that appeared back then

486
00:53:26,670 --> 00:53:31,380
 we can use the serum from those children for the time being.

487
00:54:36,090 --> 00:54:38,640
What is this? Turn on the lights.

488
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:41,540
You're spending your wages paid by the government rather uselessly.

489
00:54:41,540 --> 00:54:44,230
How many people did you drag here, just to catch one person?

490
00:54:44,230 --> 00:54:45,160
Do Jeong Wu?

491
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:49,970
Why is the Chief of Staff of the Blue House at a place like this? You should be focusing on doing your job serving the President.

492
00:54:49,970 --> 00:54:52,980
This bastard, how did you know I was here?

493
00:54:55,010 --> 00:54:58,650
Tonight at 9 p.m. Oh Jeong Hwan will catch the third child.

494
00:54:58,650 --> 00:55:02,430
He's going to catch the third child? How?

495
00:55:02,430 --> 00:55:04,550
CEO of MODU, Jang Yong Sik and Oh Jeong Hwan met.

496
00:55:04,550 --> 00:55:07,590
The third child is trying to kill Song Min Ho.

497
00:55:07,590 --> 00:55:09,530
And he said where the third child was hiding.

498
00:55:09,530 --> 00:55:14,660
After he captures the third child, he's going to take him to the basement of the Daejin building.

499
00:55:14,660 --> 00:55:18,130
What? Weren't you looking for me?

500
00:55:23,060 --> 00:55:25,790
Could you catch me like that?

501
00:55:28,370 --> 00:55:30,620
Hurry and shoot!

502
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:45,030
It's been a long time, my son.

503
00:57:20,970 --> 00:57:26,510
Just when you think it's all over, that's when it begins.

504
00:57:30,310 --> 00:57:34,840
There isn't anything we can change.

505
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:10,100

506
00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:20,880
 Awaken

507
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:23,110
You raised me to be a hell of a guinea pig. Thank you, Mother.

508
00:58:23,110 --> 00:58:27,030
Madness.  I only clearly remember the madness in her eyes.

509
00:58:27,030 --> 00:58:28,060
Did you have a nightmare again?

510
00:58:28,060 --> 00:58:29,780
I had a terrible nightmare.

511
00:58:29,780 --> 00:58:31,410
I'm sorry for causing you to live like this.

512
00:58:31,410 --> 00:58:34,880
I saved the guinea pig.  Now only the fourth child is left.

513
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:37,570
So I'm trying to put things back where they were.

514
00:58:37,570 --> 00:58:39,390
So is the mathematical formula all you need?

515
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:41,450
That's it. The key to saving lives.

516
00:58:41,450 --> 00:58:43,070
Give me the perfect drug.

517
00:58:43,070 --> 00:58:44,510
It has been completed.

518
00:58:44,510 --> 00:58:48,820
Just when you think it's all over, that's when it begins, didn't you say?
