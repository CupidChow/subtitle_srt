You were alive!

5
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:36,310
They are crazy.  They are stabbing themselves and jumping around.

6
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:40,340
What's the matter with everyone?

7
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,510
Why is this happening?

8
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,890
Let's get out of here.

9
00:03:56,890 --> 00:04:00,190
What's wrong with everybody?

10
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,070
It's because this is how I made it.

11
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:06,880
I am alone on an empty street with no one there.

12
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,260
The sun is shining whitely.

13
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:13,670
The clock which is never wrong indicates it is midnight.

14
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:21,500
I wonder now whether it is daytime or night?

 The Present

 Episode 1

19
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:26,120
 Report. Report. It's currently crossing the Seogang Bridge.

20
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:31,480
 I'm checking, so keep trailing it. Ji Wan report the situation in real time.

21
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,600
Can we stop it on the bridge?

22
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,430
I don't think it's going to be easy to arrest him here. He's about to enter Sunhwan Road (Ring Road).

23
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:42,680
I was dumb to expect that from you.

24
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:57,700
 The red light is shining on a public disgrace.

25
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:02,070
 The killer sent us a preview. He's already killed two.

26
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:05,400
 When we don't know how many more there may be in the future,

27
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,420
 what are the police doing?

28
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:26,180
- He will soon be heading towards Unjeong-dong. 
 - Hey, Mr. Special!

29
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:30,410
We're still okay here. It may be 20 minutes.

 Advertising Library

00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:36,460
 Truck Team, head towards Unjeong-dong.

32
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:40,370
 Our team is on standby. Can't anyone get there sooner?

33
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:47,290
Speed up.  Get on his ass.

36
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:18,260
- Damn bastards. 
 - Let's stick together.

37
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:29,790
What the hell is he doing now?

38
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,400
Hurry! Hurry. Chase it.

39
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:58,480
We missed it. It's entering Unjeong now.

40
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,510
Hey, Dummy!

41
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:03,670
 Meanwhile, another preview.

42
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:06,840
 What other tragedy will occur this time?

43
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:11,770
 We looking forward  to see  whether the police will be sitting on their hands this time again.

44
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:17,140
 Taking one step closer to current events, this has been Lee Ji Wuk of Current Events Zoom..

45
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:22,760
So what are they doing? They still haven't apprehended the bank robber.

46
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:26,920
How long has it been since it was said that we just have to get the Architect and secure a warehouse.

47
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,140
He's coming back soon.

48
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:36,740
No.  It's in the middle of nowhere.  At this rate, there will be an ordinary accident.

49
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:41,300
If we miss this time, we're really not going to catch him. If he's trapped at the cargo warehouse and goes underwater...

50
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:57,480
 I don't want you to do anything which is too dangerous.

51
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:10,050
What! What are you, bastard?

52
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,680
She's doing it. Hi.

53
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:39,940
Put your knife down right now.

54
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:44,040
Hey, don't come near me. Don't come near me, you bastard.

55
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,980
Please don't come near. Please let me live.

56
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:50,470
- No!
 - Put your gun down, I will kill him.

57
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:53,170
If you do, then you will also be charged for murder.

58
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,380
- Going to fire real bullets now.
 - Fine, then I'll just die, you bastard.

59
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:58,840
Team Leader, please stop.

60
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:03,780
- Drop the gun! I will really kill him.
 - Please stop.

61
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:08,750
- It's fine, I'll accurately shoot him... in his hand.
 - Please stop, please stop, I beg you!

62
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:12,990
- I can hit his hand. Just trust me.
 - No, Team Leader, not his hand.

63
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:16,350
- Stop!
 - I'm going to kill him!
 - No!

64
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:28,400
 Eunjung Road

65
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,600
- I hit my target.
 - Ah, sh*t.

66
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:45,300
Sorry I'm late.

67
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:58,950
You will take care of this cleanly? By shooting a gun in the middle of the street while everyone is looking?

68
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:01,230
Of course, your team has been issued permits for gun use.

69
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:05,890
But that only applies to the kids. You can't shoot a gun, Do Jeong Wu! What do you believe in, that you would do that?

70
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:09,230
You're lucky the street sign fell onto the criminal head. What if the hostage was hurt?

71
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:12,400
I would have died from extreme stress and you'd be giving me 300,000 won ($300) at my funeral!

72
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,520
- 300,000 won seems like it's too much.
 - Ugh.

73
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:17,420
I oughta kick you.

74
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:24,380
Did we create a special team to solve a headache case?

75
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:27,260
Or did a headache case happen because we made a special team?

76
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:31,510
Why does it have to be these guys? Why? Why? Why?

77
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:40,300
This is classified information.

78
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:43,100
 This is information about the forewarned murders that Reporter Lee Ji Wuk is putting on his shows.

79
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:47,280
 Based on the secret code, the location of the next incident is Mawon Jungang-ro, 24 Road 7.

80
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:50,620
 Solden Marian Hotel. Tonight at about 11 p.m.

81
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:55,640
 Informant, please provide your name and address. Based on the law, we will find your location—

82
00:13:57,290 --> 00:14:01,460
It's an internet call from abroad, with the use of a voice-changing device. However we are trying to track it.

83
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:06,140
So serial murders in which the police are not yet involved

84
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:10,820
are happening after giving forewarning notices. That is what Lee Ji Wuk is going around babbling.

85
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:14,600
- But now we've even received notice from an informant.
 - That that Reporter Lee Ji Wuk, he's a bit—

86
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,250
Of course, there is a chance that he's just making stuff up. I know that.

87
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:22,310
But if we just stand by again and something really happens, will you handle the fallout?

88
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:25,670
- Go, then. 
 - Well, she and I have to deal with the gunshot report—

89
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:28,710
Going to shoot a gun again? Just go. Please just go!

90
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:30,470
Go and catch something!

91
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:33,860
If not, do I have to hear mocking from the likes of Lee Jin Wuk, that we're not doing anything?

92
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:36,730
- That bastard who says such nonsense?
 - No.

93
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:46,360
But it's a good thing that my gun has all its bullets intact.

94
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:49,840
- Is that really a good thing?
 - It's better than not having bullets.

95
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,760
We've worked like a dog on this case for over 6 months.

96
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:56,800
But we've been sent on another case even before the paperwork is done? Is this fitting for the Great Nation of South Korea in the 21st Century?

97
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,910
And for a forewarned murder or whatever? Such dream-like nonsense.

98
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:03,610
What a waste of time this is. Sh*t.

99
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:33,820
What brings you here?

100
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:36,080
We are the police.

101
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:41,650
Someone could die here and no one would notice. How do we find the informant?

102
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:44,490
Let's first find the host of this party.

103
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:46,660
- No call from Lieutenant Yoon yet?
 - Not yet.

104
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:50,000
Since the information wasn't about the host dying,  let's look around for now.

105
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,220
Seeing how there seems to be a lot of drugs here, I'm sure we'll find something.

106
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:59,100
Ah, excuse me. Where is the host of this party?

107
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:05,390
You should first ask if I know who the host is.

108
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:13,000
Could I be a fish? But I hate water. ( TN. When a woman has several boyfriends, it's called keeping an

109
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,710
  TN:  When a woman has several boyfriends, it's called keeping an aquarium.

110
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:22,160
This place is strange. Let's go.

111
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:51,530
- Okay, you try over there.
 - Yes.

112
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:03,130
Excuse me, enjoy yourselves.

113
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:34,490
What is this now?

114
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:49,530
Are you the informant, by any chance?

115
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:56,340
Shin-goja? (informant) Well, I'm definitely not a goja. (eunuch)

116
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:03,030
- I'm Officer Gong Hye Won, from Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency special team.
 - Detective?

117
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:05,740
I'm not a detective. But I came after receiving a report of an incident.

118
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:09,460
Here? An incident?

119
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:14,710
- I do know about an accident.
 - There was an accident?

120
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:19,290
Yes, the accident and you and I are about to have.

121
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:27,350
We were told someone will die here tonight. Or may have already.

122
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,910
Everyone! Oh darn.

123
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:38,940
Okay, everyone! Today. Here.

124
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:42,190
Someone will die!

125
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:45,190
Let's all die! Let's all just die!

126
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:54,220
Looks like no one died yet. If someone did, everyone would be more excited.

127
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:57,800
Looks like you do not know who the host of this party is.

128
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,050
I will find the host.

129
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:26,460
Why is he swimming? He hates water so much, he doesn't even drink it.

130
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:34,290
Why? Is he your type, Detective? You can't take your eyes off him.

131
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:38,000
I'm looking because it is absurd. He has a lot of money, but no clothes?

132
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,410
Why is he undressed?

133
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:55,310
That guy we first met is the host, he said. This looks like a false report.

134
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:57,870
Oh, that guy...

135
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:02,350
What are you looking at? You'll sully your eyes.

136
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,540
What is he doing?

137
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:27,900
What's going on?

138
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:46,980
Go!

139
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:26,270
It's 119, right? Someone drowned and he's no longer breathing.

140
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:14,800
 Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency

141
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,700
- Isn't it suicide? 
 - It wasn't.

142
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:20,620
Why couldn't you prevent it? Why did you even form this special team?

143
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:23,100
I'm sorry.

144
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:28,080
So is this that forewarned murder or whatever?

145
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,910
What Lee Ji Wuk is shouting about?

146
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:32,180
Well, we'll have to look into it.

147
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:35,380
The driver we caught says he's not 'the Architect.'

148
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:38,490
So, first, we have to find out who the architect of the serial bank robberies is.

149
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:41,830
- Then find the cargo company owner and return it to him.
 - Never mind.

150
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:46,160
For now, the forewarned murders or whatever? That is the bigger headache.

151
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,360
What are you looking at?

152
00:22:56,290 --> 00:23:01,740
Hey, when forming a special team or whatever, that means you want to spend money.

153
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:05,190
And to spend money, that means you have to do what I tell you.

154
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:08,750
Didn't you know that, when you were asking me to form the special team?

155
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:11,990
I didn't know. I'll be taking my leave.

156
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:17,170
Keep your kids' mouths shut.

157
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:18,440
You mean the gold bars?

158
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,540
Hey, you...

159
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:24,990
I was going to find the cargo company owner to return them to him, but they weren't on the evidence list.

160
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:27,240
Let's just say what we found in the warehouse is what it is.

161
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:31,170
But on a five ton truck, 4000 gold bullion bars weighing 1 kg each.

162
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:33,900
So if they are worth about 70 million won each, that's about 280 million won.

163
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:36,970
And there were three trucks, so that's 840 billion won. ($758 million)

164
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:39,650
Isn't it an amount that's not easy to miss and forget?

165
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:42,350
Fine, you are good at math.

166
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:45,720
Why won't you figure out what was never found, huh?

167
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:51,120
Won't you stand still? Aigoo, darn.

168
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,780
- That is your favorite plant.
 - Get lost!

169
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:05,380
Darn! Oh, no.

170
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:10,880
Why, of all things, did it have to be you, Ning Ning?

171
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:17,650
"Architect"

172
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:19,740
He's the problem.

173
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:22,010
Ah, I have to beat my head.

174
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:26,400
Don't we get a reward for catching the bank robber?

175
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,300
The warehouse was so fancy, our eyes were blinded.

176
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,030
But we didn't find the Architect.

177
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:32,690
It's so difficult to rob banks using petty criminals.

178
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:34,970
But he accomplished it 17 times.

179
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:38,410
So we searched the warehouse, but he already ran off with an enormous amount of money.

180
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:41,930
That is the most fascinating part for me. What did he do with all that money?

181
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,300
Why are you always so negative? You only see our failures.

182
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:49,360
Is that all? Someone died right in front of us.

183
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:03,000
We couldn't find the Architect and we lost the money and someone died, so I was scolded.

184
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,860
You heard that, didn't you?

185
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,900
The serial bank robbery case is finished today.

186
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:12,740
Everyone return home. We will begin to dig into the serial murder case starting tomorrow.

187
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:14,950
- We don't file the paperwork?
 - No, we don't.

188
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:18,770
I argued that the special team shouldn't have to do lowly paper work.

189
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:22,180
I looked so cool and strong and caused some chaos. Didn't I do good?

190
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:26,080
Indeed. So do we go out for dinner together?

191
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,800
What about the Architect?

192
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,900
Are they turning it over to the National Police Agency again?

193
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:32,800
We caught the others, so if we question them, we can find out soon.

194
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,530
If we almost find the criminal, the National Police Agency catches him.

195
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:37,340
And if we do catch the criminal, the National Police Agency does the rest. If this keeps happening—

196
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:41,730
Yes, even if that keeps happening, for tonight, just go home.

197
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:43,990
I'm tired, too.

198
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:24,670
We received the item well

199
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:26,470
but there are some things missing.

200
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:30,920
 Yes, we haven't yet caught the Architect.

201
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:34,500
He could be caught during the corroborative investigation, so please wait a little longer.

202
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:37,370
Rather than an expert at slush funds

203
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:41,170
wrapping this up as a simple bank robbery case isn't easy for us, either.

204
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:43,330
Slush fund, huh?

205
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:46,460
You're straightforward. We haven't forgotten.

206
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:49,010
Since you've done us a favor, of course, we must do one for you.

207
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:52,720
Please look at your account tomorrow afternoon. You won't be disappointed.

208
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:02,570
Come in.

209
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:16,340
- Is a lot missing? 
 - I'm sure he'll find his way here. We've fed him something.

210
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:21,100
It's easy to feed, but making him do the work worthy of the food is difficult.

211
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:29,420
We don't know what may happen if we neglect this.

212
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:30,890
Yes.

213
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:36,120
If we're not careful,

214
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,890
you could see me bleeding, haven't you already learned that?

215

 Name: Kim Yeong Jun
 Age: 19

Female. Age 36 in Korean age.

224
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:05,000
 Give me a photo, not a drawing. If possible, a recent photo.

225
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:11,050
 Don't have one.

226
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:18,530
 You haven't seen her once in 28 years. What use is a drawing?

227
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:20,510
She looks the same.

228
00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:25,800
 Fine. You're the one blowing your money, not me. What about the man?

229
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:39,460
I don't know what he looks like.

230
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,290
You parted from both of them 28 years ago, but why don't you know what the man looks like?

231
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:23,150
Would you please open the window shades? ( In English )

232
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,800
Excuse me ma'am, could you please open the window shades?

233
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:30,390
- Oh, sure. 
 - Thank you.

234
00:31:57,780 --> 00:32:00,120
So, then...

235
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:06,170
that means at least one of the two have returned to Korea.

 Age 32
 CEO of Nine Asset Management 
 Baek Seung Jae

240
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:26,490
Why isn't there any preview of the Kim Yeong Jun incident?

241
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:30,360
They said none was received. Maybe he didn't know back then, that he would kill so many people?

242
00:32:30,370 --> 00:32:31,910
Why wouldn't he know? He's the one who killed them.

243
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:35,150
How could I know what a serial killer feels?

244
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:37,150
Then why do we classify this case as the same as the others?

245
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:39,640
Reporter Lee Ji Wuk received a video of the incident.

246
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:42,950
He received a video of Kim Yeong Jun's murder site.

247
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:46,650
Then he got a preview about Park Gyu Tae, then a video of Park Gyu Tae's murder site.

248
00:32:46,650 --> 00:32:51,230
Kim Yeong Jun, Age 19. He kidnapped a hoobae  (junior)  and raped and tortured her, then killed her.

249
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:56,490
But he was ruled as having suffered mental impairment due to extreme stress about his studies and received probation.

250
00:32:56,490 --> 00:32:58,820
 Welcome.

251
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:01,190
 That will be 3,000 won. ($3)

252
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:09,360
 Thank you, goodbye. Please come again.

253
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:13,700
 Why are you doing this, Seonbae? Why?

254
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:17,280
 - Just stay still.
 - Please don't do this!

255
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:20,370
 Stay still already!

256
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:22,510
 No!

257
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:27,850
 No... No... No! No! No!

258
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:31,570
 No! This is wrong! No!

259
00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:36,610
 No! No! No! No! No!

260
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:38,420
 No!

261
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:47,700
While hanging out with his friends, he jumped from an abandoned building and died.

262
00:33:54,330 --> 00:33:57,070
Park Gyu Tae, Age 54. Executive Director of Maewae Group.

263
00:33:57,070 --> 00:34:01,510
Before people understood the concept of psychopaths, he was already famous for his abominable cruelty.

264
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:06,320
After Chairman Park Dong Wuk died, everyone expected the brothers to get into a power struggle.

265
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:10,690
But unexpectedly, Park Gyu Tae became the company's head quite smoothly.
  Withdrawal from Labor Union

266
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:14,490
And Park Gyu Tae seemed satisfied living while doing what he enjoyed.

267
00:34:14,490 --> 00:34:16,050
What he enjoyed?

268
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:20,560
The kind of work where he rips flesh and blood splatters?

269
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,280
He died after jumping in naked into a cage full of wild dogs,

270
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,720
while at a hunting ground that he visited monthly without fail.

271
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:40,100
 He was torn apart by animals who were fed with blood and knew its taste.

272
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:45,090
To a current reporter, a notice forewarning murder is sent, then video of the murder site is sent.

273
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:47,790
And if that reporter is Lee Ji Wuk, then I think we should suspect him.

274
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:49,000
That guy is hungry for attention.

275
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,370
Yes, he is capable of making stuff up, even after someone commits suicide.

276
00:34:52,370 --> 00:34:56,320
That's right. But the informant who said he cracked the code,

277
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:00,890
at the time and place he told us, that's where Baek Seung Jae died.

278
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:03,030
Baek Seung Jae, Age 32.

279
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:05,460
His father died when he was young, and he's a celebrity

280
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:08,340
who invests in various drinking and nighttime establishments.

281
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,450
At parties he has hosted, eight people have died.

282
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:17,580
And 38 victims who have been reported.

283
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:19,310
If you add the people who've gotten hurt at his parties,

284
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:23,390
it's a total of 67, as I expected he's never been indicted.

285
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:25,970
What was the cause of death at these parties?

286
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:29,120
They probably did drugs or something

287
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:32,810
and although there are no official records, you can imagine other reasons.

288
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:35,100
So the dead guys Kim Yeong Jun and Park Gyu Tae, too,

289
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:37,150
are all criminals.

290
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:40,520
But they escaped legal consequences because they are sons of wealthy families.

291
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:44,410
Your analysis ability is good. I don't think Lee Jin Wuk has come to that conclusion yet.

292
00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:46,320
Well, it does kind of fit together.

293
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:50,420
But conclusively, we saw Baek Seung Jae die, and it was suicide.

294
00:35:53,570 --> 00:35:55,710
Not at all.

295
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:01,950
That wasn't suicide?
  The drugged fish will have oxygen stolen from him

296
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:10,280
Turn on the TV. Channel XNV.

297
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:14,680
 Yet another forewarned murder has occurred.

298
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:18,530
 I've received these several times, and have warned the police each time.

299
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:21,550
 But incompetent law enforcement has ruled all of them

300
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:24,780
  as suicides after only cursory investigations.

301
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:27,680
 These cases have now become cases of serial murder.

302
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,490
 Were they truly unpreventable?

303
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:31,150
Isn't he the criminal?

304
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:34,230
He commits the crimes and he reports on them.

305
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:36,080
That's how it is in novels.

306
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:40,470
 No one can deny now that the irresponsible behavior of bureaucrats treating all of this as a novel

307
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:46,010
 is contributing to the damage.

308
00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:50,080
Causing community panic based on something that hasn't even been proven is even worse.

309
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:54,380
 I just hope that we can do more than

310
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:58,210
 the bureaucrat's wishing in the scheme of things there won't be community panic.

311
00:36:58,210 --> 00:36:59,850
Quiet.

312
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:02,080
Now he will tell us about the next forewarning notice.

313
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:07,070
 This is the next murder notice that the police must prevent.

314
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:12,920
 The day the blue chicken climbs above the red sheep

315
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:19,220
 the sex-crazed person in the street will face what he cannot overcome.

316
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:24,900
Taking one step closer to current events, this has been Lee Ji Wuk of "Current Events Zoom-In."

317
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:47,700
Sex-crazed person... sex-crazed person...

318
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:52,320
I understand that it's sexual desire that can't be controlled.

319
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:55,020
But what is it that he cannot overcome?

320
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:58,870
- Can I say something racy?
 - Oh...

321
00:37:58,870 --> 00:38:03,750
We're talking about a sex-crazed person, how can I not be racy? Report on the witness.

322
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:08,860
Age 18, Oh Gyeong Min. He was one of the kids in the abandoned building when Kim Yeong Jun died.

323
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:10,720
His testimony was the most useful.

324
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:14,740
The other kids spoke gibberish, or claimed that they didn't see what happened.

325
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:15,890
Oh Gyeong Min.

326
00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:19,630
He already testified once, so he should cooperate.

327
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:28,800
I don't think so.

328
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:36,490
 Drop the gun! I will really kill him!

329
00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:37,870
 Please stop.

330
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:41,340
 It's fine, I'll accurately shoot him... in his hand..

331
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:42,820
 No, don't do it! Don't do it, I said!

332
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,460
 I can shoot his hand, trust me.

333
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:45,930
 No, Team Leader, not his hand!

334
00:38:45,930 --> 00:38:47,270
 Please stop!

335
00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:51,070
 - I will kill him!
 - No! No!

336
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:52,610
Oh?

337
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,550
Let's laugh about it.

338
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,240
Well, that situation was a bit...

339
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:06,630
 Yes.

340
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:09,950
 Hey.

341
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,620
 The situation is a bit... you know.

342
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:23,670
 A high school student reeks of cigarettes.

343
00:39:26,010 --> 00:39:29,730
 You've lost the opportunity to write affidavits for the rest of your life. An opportunity is a chance.

344
00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:31,360
 - Your name?
 - Oh Gyeong Min.

345
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:34,180
 Yes, that's what he says.

346
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:39,390
 - Smoking while a minor.
 - What?

347
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:43,040
 Contact his school so they can enlighten him, and also confirm whether he smoked in a no smoking zone.

348
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,800
 - Hey.
 - It's a lesson.

349
00:39:47,850 --> 00:39:52,890
 If it's something bad, you shouldn't start at all. Once things get twisted, there is no end to it.

350
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:57,000
Being treated to something like this and talking to you...

351
00:39:57,970 --> 00:40:02,680
And someone recently told me that opportunity is a chance.

352
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:06,210
That if something gets twisted, there is no end to it.

353
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:12,890
Wow, what kind of kid is he?

354
00:40:14,970 --> 00:40:16,740
- What do we do?
 - Let's bribe him with something.

355
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:19,380
But you don't carry your wallet.

356
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:21,370
So let's bribe him.

357
00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:22,850
Even if I had money, I would not give it to him.

358
00:40:22,850 --> 00:40:24,680
"I would not give it to him."

359
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,400
Hey, Student.

360
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:28,600
- Do you have 10,000 won? ($10)
 - What?

361
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,840
These days, everyone carries at least that much.

362
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,130
If it's 50,000 won, it would be better.

363
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:33,640
Why are you doing this?

364
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:37,800
Go on, Student, sorry. Team Leader... I mean, this ahjussi, he's a little ill.

365
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:40,550
He was desperate to pay for his medication. That's all, you can go.

366
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:42,710
Don't you even have 5,000 won? ($5)

367
00:40:43,810 --> 00:40:45,780
3,000 won?

368
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:50,350
You don't have any cash.

369
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:53,070
Then let's just try talking to him.

370
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:55,870
Oh, this is so embarrassing.

371
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:09,130
I would like a more capitalistic tone to our conversations.

372
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:11,720
How about some soda?

373
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:26,140
I will stop usage on this credit card after three hours. Until then, you can use this however you want.

374
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:28,290
But not too much, of course.

375
00:41:28,290 --> 00:41:30,630
Now we're talking.

376
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,660
- So that guy, Kim Yeong Jun.
 - Yes?

377
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:47,990
He did jump on his own.

378
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,340
No one liked him.

379
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:03,450
No one knew about him raping and killing some high school girl a year ago.

380
00:42:03,450 --> 00:42:06,640
But since he transferred to our school, he seemed like a psycho loser.

381
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:10,240
His dad is the CEO of DS Law Firm, so we let him hang out with us.

382
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,940
I thought there was something creepy about his gaze.

383
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,700
Among us, we suspected that he was on drugs or something.

384
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:28,220
He bothered me the most when he was seeking attention.

385
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:32,710
And that day, Jae Hun was preparing for an audition, so we were all excited.

386
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:36,470
But this crazy guy, he can't stand it when he's not the center of attention.

387
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:38,490
 Hey, Kim Yeong Jun.

388
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:45,480
He even said he had a fear of heights. So we were really annoyed.

389
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:06,450
Oh, right. You lost your credit card. You should stop usage.

390
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:09,620
My credit card? My credit card is lost?

391
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:12,270
Yes, not now, but 2 hours from now.

392
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:24,790
Oh, but the victim's animal, fish. Is that really the code?

393
00:43:24,790 --> 00:43:27,440
"If you put it on your nose, it's a nose ring, and your ear, then it's an earring."   (It can be whatever you choose.)

394
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:30,170
If you know a fortune teller who can be that accurate, you could build a building here.

395
00:43:30,170 --> 00:43:31,940
But the informant is suspicious.

396
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:34,920
Who he is, and how he cracked the code, he won't explain.

397
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:38,560
That hotel was the murder site, based on what evidence? It's so strange.

398
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:43,290
If you remove all the strange elements, he walked to the pool on his own and jumped in.

399
00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:45,460
How can that not be suicide?

400
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:48,070
It's an unquestionable fact.

401
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,110
Fact.

402
00:43:52,110 --> 00:43:55,210
What can people accept as fact?

403
00:43:55,210 --> 00:43:57,590
What is truth?

404
00:43:57,590 --> 00:43:59,750
There is a story I like.

405
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:01,970
The sun is shining whitely.

406
00:44:01,970 --> 00:44:05,520
I am alone on an empty street with no one there.

407
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:09,800
The clock which is never wrong indicates it is midnight.

408
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:16,200
I wonder now whether it is daytime or night?

409
00:44:17,290 --> 00:44:21,050
And information is what provides the answer to that question.

410
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:27,190
If you see someone sleeping, then that moment becomes night.

411
00:44:27,190 --> 00:44:31,120
But if you saw an office with busy workers, you'd believe that it was day.

412
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:34,230
Fact is determined by what you see.

413
00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:39,950
So all we have to do is to decide what we will show.

414
00:44:39,950 --> 00:44:43,030
 Drowning in Hotel Pool

415
00:44:43,030 --> 00:44:46,400
 Forewarned Murder becomes Serial Murder
 Was it avoidable?

416
00:44:54,450 --> 00:45:00,120
So what becomes a problem depends on what was seen.

417
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:07,010
So something no one knows about becomes something that never happened.

418
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:19,060
Eun Hye!

419
00:45:20,810 --> 00:45:22,710
Open the door!

420
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:40,580
Oh, you are so cute. How can you go into my room, of all places?

421
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:42,250
The key is right here, right here.

422
00:45:42,250 --> 00:45:45,010
And I have your bag, too.

423
00:45:45,010 --> 00:45:48,120
You can't avoid me!

424
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:53,820
Aigoo, sorry.

425
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:56,160
My personality is a bit weird, huh?

426
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:59,590
I'm sorry, open it, I won't do it anymore.

427
00:46:01,130 --> 00:46:03,190
Open this door.

428
00:46:09,370 --> 00:46:12,090
Boom, boom... huh?

429
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:17,720
The person who lost her bag.

430
00:46:22,590 --> 00:46:24,970
Oh, you are like a rabbit. Oh oh.

431
00:46:26,410 --> 00:46:30,220
Wouldn't it be better to just do it once, instead of dying?

432
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:32,760
Whatever happens, no one will ever know.

433
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:35,970
Hey, come here, come here.

434
00:46:35,970 --> 00:46:39,290
Come here, I'll show you a good time.

435
00:46:39,290 --> 00:46:41,480
Where are you going? I'll make things fun for you.

436
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:44,870
Eun Hye, trust in me. Trust Oppa and come here.

437
00:46:44,870 --> 00:46:47,610
Oh, I should have longer legs.

438
00:46:47,610 --> 00:46:49,390
Come here, come on.

439
00:46:49,390 --> 00:46:52,520
Oh really, come here right now!

440
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:55,900
I'm sorry, sorry. Ah, sorry.

441
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:57,820
Hurry and come, come here, come on.

442
00:46:57,820 --> 00:47:00,060
I told you, come to me, huh?

443
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:02,430
Give me your hand, I'll pull you in.

444
00:47:02,430 --> 00:47:04,130
It's alright, it's alright. Oh, oh?

445
00:47:04,130 --> 00:47:06,290
Oh, oh?

446
00:47:12,730 --> 00:47:15,030
You can't sleep well?

447
00:47:16,050 --> 00:47:18,480
If you commit crimes, your dreams are bad.

448
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:23,390
I see darkness in your eyes. Deep darkness.

449
00:47:23,390 --> 00:47:26,350
I've seen so many people who need drugs.

450
00:47:26,350 --> 00:47:28,890
And among them, you, Hyeong, really...

451
00:47:28,890 --> 00:47:31,140
This bastard. You anchovy like bastard.

452
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:33,840
- Anchovy?
 - Are you selling drugs in here?

453
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:35,290
Are you running your business in here?

454
00:47:35,290 --> 00:47:37,310
Hey, what do you mean? Business?

455
00:47:37,310 --> 00:47:40,160
I just want to help this Hyeong-nim.

456
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:44,720
I see pitch darkness in your eyes, Hyeong-nim.

457
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:48,750
- Staff Captain Do, please give us a break for today.
 - Yes.

458
00:47:48,750 --> 00:47:51,430
We are full today.

459
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:57,650
So he's a policeman, what's with the "Staff Captain"?

460
00:47:59,070 --> 00:48:02,790
Must you display your ignorance?

461
00:48:04,510 --> 00:48:05,920
Patrol Officer, Senior Patrol Officer,

462
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:09,330
Sergeant (Assistant Inspector), Lieutenant (Inspector), Captain (Senior Inspector), then Staff Captain (Superintendent).

463
00:48:09,330 --> 00:48:12,950
It means he's a very highly-ranked police officer.

464
00:48:12,950 --> 00:48:15,690
Is that so? Then why is he in a holding cell?

465
00:48:15,690 --> 00:48:18,840
How would I know what a police officer is thinking?

466
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:22,760
But I heard that he always sleeps in the holding cell every night.

467
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:26,140
- He didn't commit a crime?
 - What crime would a police officer have committed?

468
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:34,090
So if I need drugs, what should I do?

469
00:48:34,930 --> 00:48:38,220
You should get some medication

470
00:48:40,410 --> 00:48:41,610
that will help you sleep.

471
00:48:41,610 --> 00:48:44,900
From a hospital. Officially.

472
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:48,760
After getting a prescription. Very legally.

473
00:49:10,070 --> 00:49:12,200
Something is strange

474
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:15,720
but I don't know what is strange about it.

475
00:49:16,570 --> 00:49:17,660
What is it?

476
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:18,910
It's nothing, nothing at all.

477
00:49:18,910 --> 00:49:19,960
Oh, what is it?

478
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:22,150
Oh, Lieutenant Jang, you wouldn't know if you saw it. Go away.

479
00:49:22,150 --> 00:49:22,990
But I have to see it to know.

480
00:49:22,990 --> 00:49:25,760
Oh, stop it. Let me concentrate.

481
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:28,240
Okay, so never mind the sex-crazed person and what he can't overcome in the street.

482
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:31,020
But what is this strange jewelry symbol about?

483
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:36,560
Park Gyu Tae had nine. Baek Seung Jae had 12. So why 11?

484
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:38,790
Oh, please just go.

485
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:41,130
Please stop.

486
00:49:41,130 --> 00:49:44,500
They never found the guy who cracked the code for Baek Seung Jae's notice?

487
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:47,990
Can the police track an internet call from a foreign server?

488
00:49:47,990 --> 00:49:50,430
I guess we can't find him. So that is what is strange.

489
00:49:50,430 --> 00:49:53,870
Why would they provide information in a way that the police could never track?

490
00:49:53,870 --> 00:49:56,530
Maybe he's in a situation where he can't say who he is?

491
00:49:56,530 --> 00:49:59,210
- What would that be?
 - He wants to stop the crime

492
00:49:59,210 --> 00:50:03,220
but he doesn't want to reveal himself. Something like that?

493
00:50:06,630 --> 00:50:08,980
Oh, you are bothersome. Go away already.

494
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:12,520
Oh, really. You are looking down on me, Lieutenant Yun. I have great vision, 1.0 in both eyes.

495
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:14,650
This is not about your vision.

496
00:50:14,650 --> 00:50:18,720
CCTV scan is about getting information from a video full of movement. You can't do this.

497
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:22,940
If I'm to find information that I need, I should at least be able to look at it first.

498
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:25,320
- Vision.
 - Ugh.

499
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:27,190
Why?

500
00:50:29,070 --> 00:50:32,260
- Ah, okay. Want to test your powers of observation?
 - What is it?

501
00:50:32,260 --> 00:50:33,930
In a deck of cards that's been shuffled

502
00:50:33,930 --> 00:50:36,990
you're going to pick out your card the fastest that you can. Want to try?

503
00:50:36,990 --> 00:50:39,860
Jeez.  Do you think I'm an idiot or something?

504
00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:42,250
Why couldn't I find it quickly?

505
00:50:42,250 --> 00:50:45,460
Alright, pick your card, pick your card.

506
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:48,730
Pick any that you want.

507
00:50:48,730 --> 00:50:51,640
Look at Lieutenant Jang, rolling his eyes.

508
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:53,960
Alright.

509
00:50:55,820 --> 00:50:57,950
Well, it's like this.

510
00:50:57,950 --> 00:50:59,800
Laughing?

511
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:01,640
There.

512
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:06,030
So pick one.

513
00:51:08,370 --> 00:51:09,790
This one.

514
00:51:09,790 --> 00:51:13,530
This is the card that Lieutenant Jang picked.

515
00:51:13,530 --> 00:51:18,160
Yes, look carefully. See how quickly I find my card again.

516
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:21,460
There.

517
00:51:25,190 --> 00:51:26,960
Find it.

518
00:51:28,670 --> 00:51:30,420
- This.
 - Oh-ho-ho.

519
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:34,830
- It was this, right?
 - Yes, correct.

520
00:51:34,830 --> 00:51:36,830
- This was the one.
 - Oh, wow.

521
00:51:42,330 --> 00:51:44,420
Yes, you are useful.

522
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:48,390
- Did you see that?
 - You're good.

523
00:51:48,390 --> 00:51:51,030
Very quick.

524
00:51:51,030 --> 00:51:52,970
Get ready, you'll be looking for it again.

525
00:51:52,970 --> 00:51:56,210
However many times we do this, my vision will not change.

526
00:51:56,210 --> 00:51:57,870
Of course not.

527
00:51:59,820 --> 00:52:01,790
Find it.

528
00:52:03,590 --> 00:52:05,160
This.

529
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:08,030
I'm quick, huh?

530
00:52:11,070 --> 00:52:13,200
Very quick.

531
00:52:19,050 --> 00:52:21,830
I'm the idiot for betting on you.

532
00:52:21,830 --> 00:52:22,620
Thank you.

533
00:52:22,620 --> 00:52:27,010
This test of observation wasn't about the cards, you idiot.

534
00:52:27,010 --> 00:52:29,060
- Then?
 - It's about misdirection.

535
00:52:29,060 --> 00:52:32,120
If you make someone look this way

536
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:37,760
they can't see what they should see.

537
00:52:55,590 --> 00:53:00,620
No way. The color of the tablecloth changed, but I didn't notice?

538
00:53:10,570 --> 00:53:12,530
Correct.

539
00:53:12,530 --> 00:53:14,350
You're good.

540
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:20,520
Wow, her clothes really changed.

541
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:23,800
Repeat after me. Campus, campus, campus, campus.

542
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:25,520
Campus, campus, campus, campus.

543
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:27,890
- A tool for measuring angles?
 - Compass.

544
00:53:27,890 --> 00:53:31,490
No, it's a protractor. Compass is for drawing circles.

545
00:53:31,490 --> 00:53:32,960
You really are a special hire.

546
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,160
Aren't you a special hire, too?

547
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:35,550
But I am not him.

548
00:53:35,550 --> 00:53:38,980
It's alright, people are all like that. The official term is "change blindness."

549
00:53:38,980 --> 00:53:44,500
Unless they are determined to see, they don't notice, and it just passes them by.

550
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:46,570
But you didn't notice even once?

551
00:53:46,570 --> 00:53:52,140
That's not great. Next time, don't get distracted by misdirection and don't miss anything.

552
00:53:52,140 --> 00:53:54,380
Keep your eyes on things.

553
00:53:54,380 --> 00:53:57,980
"Don't get distracted by misdirection and don't miss anything."

554
00:53:57,980 --> 00:54:01,040
But after thinking about it, isn't the informant who cracked the code the culprit?

555
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:04,150
With horses and dragons, how can he crack the code?

556
00:54:04,150 --> 00:54:06,150
A drugged fish will lose oxygen...

557
00:54:06,150 --> 00:54:09,290
 A drugged fish will have oxygen stolen from him.

558
00:54:09,290 --> 00:54:12,080
But why is there a "O" in between the "0" and the "gi"?

559
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:14,390
- What did you just say?
 - Huh?

560
00:54:14,390 --> 00:54:16,760
What did I say?

561
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:21,480
All the messages began with a zero, right?

562
00:54:23,380 --> 00:54:25,660
Misdirection.

563
00:54:30,670 --> 00:54:33,340
These are all the previews that were aired on Lee Ji Wuk's broadcasts, right?

564
00:54:33,340 --> 00:54:35,620
Yes, that is correct.

565
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:40,480
Something I should have noticed,

566
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:42,140
I failed to notice.

567
00:54:43,730 --> 00:54:46,270
What is it?

568
00:54:46,270 --> 00:54:47,640
What could it be?

569
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:15,450
 0 The sex-crazed person in the street will face something he cannot overcome.

570
00:55:15,450 --> 00:55:17,950
The next incident will happen one hour from now.

571
00:55:17,950 --> 00:55:20,060
And the site of the incident...

572
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:23,420
Jangeui-dong.

573
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:25,140
Let's go.

574
00:55:29,150 --> 00:55:33,720
 0 The sex-crazed person in the street will face something he cannot overcome.

575
00:56:41,510 --> 00:56:43,950
Please save me!

576
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:53,350
This is fun.

577
00:56:53,350 --> 00:56:55,970
Please help!

578
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,180
Ajumma, come out. Ajumma, come out.

579
00:57:12,420 --> 00:57:15,100
Ajumma!

580
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:17,630
You're not my style.

581
00:57:17,630 --> 00:57:21,210
Where did my puppy go?

582
00:57:21,210 --> 00:57:23,200
Just stay still or you'll get hurt.

583
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:24,970
My arm, arm, arm.

584
00:57:24,970 --> 00:57:26,060
Miss, my arm.

585
00:57:26,060 --> 00:57:29,620
Please report this, someone.

586
00:57:29,620 --> 00:57:32,020
Wow, already?

587
00:57:38,310 --> 00:57:41,290
What? Not coming here.

588
00:57:56,660 --> 00:57:59,690
Lieutenant Yoon, please confirm the CCTV's here.

589
00:57:59,690 --> 00:58:03,800
And... what do we look for? What would I know?

590
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:05,020
Let's all just do our jobs and give this a try.

591
00:58:05,020 --> 00:58:07,550
Okay. CCTV.

592
00:58:09,340 --> 00:58:11,320
Team Leader cracked the code, right?

593
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:13,150
But what are we looking for?

594
00:58:13,150 --> 00:58:15,190
He must have cracked the code, and that's why we came here, right?

595
00:58:15,190 --> 00:58:18,410
But if he doesn't know who we're looking for, it's not part of the code. Can't you understand?

596
00:58:18,410 --> 00:58:20,160
- Special hire.
 - So what do we look for?

597
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:22,770
- Whatever.
 - So what?

598
00:58:22,770 --> 00:58:25,210
Thinking back to Baek Seung Jae,

599
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:28,960
someone who's lost his mind a bit?

600
00:58:49,820 --> 00:58:51,180
I don't like this type of woman.

601
00:58:51,180 --> 00:58:53,970
Annoying!

602
00:59:02,780 --> 00:59:04,170
I found a victim.

603
00:59:04,170 --> 00:59:06,300
He's currently on the run in the direction of Janghyeon.

604
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:08,620
Yes, we'll be on our way.

605
00:59:14,430 --> 00:59:17,670
Hello. I'm the police. We're chasing a criminal right now.

606
00:59:17,670 --> 00:59:19,130
Can I briefly borrow your car?

607
00:59:19,130 --> 00:59:22,370
I'm sorry. I'll just borrow it briefly.

608
00:59:24,390 --> 00:59:26,280
I'm sorry.

609
01:00:24,390 --> 01:00:26,600
Out of my way!

610
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:33,000
Ugh, really.

611
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:20,930
Ahjussi, come out of there.

612
01:01:20,930 --> 01:01:22,910
No!

613
01:01:23,820 --> 01:01:25,320
Ahjussi, come here.

614
01:01:26,300 --> 01:01:27,840
Come out of there, it's dangerous.

615
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:29,940
No.

616
01:01:31,030 --> 01:01:34,100
It's all over now. Come out.

617
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:37,960
Ah, I told you, you are not my style.

618
01:01:47,060 --> 01:01:47,960
Come out.

619
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:50,280
Come out, it's dangerous.

620
01:01:57,450 --> 01:01:58,200
What is he doing?

621
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:00,360
Come out.

622
01:02:04,850 --> 01:02:08,790
Today, today is the most fun ever.

623
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:12,450
Thank you.

624
01:02:12,450 --> 01:02:14,990
That guy is crazy.

625
01:02:21,970 --> 01:02:24,290
This is my style!

626
01:02:24,290 --> 01:02:25,420
Out of the way.

627
01:02:25,420 --> 01:02:27,240
- Team Leader.
 - Come out.

628
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:31,180
Now, everything will disappear.

629
01:02:34,390 --> 01:02:37,270
Out of the way!

630
01:02:59,890 --> 01:03:02,440
 And that was how the end of everything began.

631
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:04,600
 began.

632
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:31,550

633
01:03:33,180 --> 01:03:35,950
 Awaken Preview

634
01:03:35,950 --> 01:03:38,130
 Have we met before?

635
01:03:38,130 --> 01:03:41,130
 When and where did we meet?

636
01:03:41,130 --> 01:03:43,690
 It's only Lee Ji Wuk's theory that these are murder cases.

637
01:03:43,690 --> 01:03:47,360
 But since people are dying based on a forewarning, they are not suicides or accidents.

638
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:51,050
 Those who have died in these incidents don't have these reactions.

639
01:03:51,050 --> 01:03:53,480
 So I guess it was suicide. I guess they wanted to die.

640
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:56,310
 Do you think their only commonality is a forewarned murder?

641
01:03:56,310 --> 01:03:58,810
 They're smiling. Very happily.

642
01:03:58,810 --> 01:03:59,890
 What is this?

643
01:03:59,890 --> 01:04:04,020
 In the current situation, they're just criminals.
