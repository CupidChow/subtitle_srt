1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:09,050

2
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:38,920
 Awaken

3
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Yes, vividly recall the heinous memories of that day.

4
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,680
You should recall your forgotten memories before you die.

5
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,730
 Why is everyone like this? Mommy!

6
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:14,680
 Because I made it this way.

7
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:30,260
The pain you gave me, I'll return it just the same.

8
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:56,580
I believe I told you to wait that day.

9
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:08,490
 Don't move an inch and wait here. I'll be right back.

10
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,670
So it was you.

11
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:22,550
I finally found you.

12
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:26,900
I missed you.

13
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:46,920
Thanks to you beginning all this, it made things easier for me.

14
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:51,120
 After Kim Yeong Jun's killing, I realized that someone

15
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,300
 committed murder using the method I used on the day of the disaster.

16
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:01,000
 And that was when I found the consultation room in Jangeui-dong.

17
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,770
 Park Gyu Tae

18
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:04,120
 Baek Seung Jae

19
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,180
 Choi Yong Seok

20
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:09,780
 And that was when I learned that there will be revenge against the White Night Foundation.

21
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:17,860
 Is that why you began to send those forewarning notices to Reporter Lee Ji Wuk?

22
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:23,880
 Thanks to you, I was able to approach Son Min Ho.

23
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:27,350
  Nam Wu Cheon

24
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:31,950
  Son Min Ho

25
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:45,000
 Baek Seung Jae

26
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,850
 Choi Yong Seok

27
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:25,210
But was there really no other way?

28
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:29,220
I just did what you taught me. Don't you like it?

29
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:34,610
This time, I pretended to be you. How about it? Was I similar?

30
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:39,380
It was similar. A bit.

31
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:42,630
I was almost fooled.

32
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:46,800
Until I figured out that the target was Oh Gyeong Min instead of Oh Jeong Hwan.

33
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:53,000
As expected of the smartest kid of White Night Village, boy number 113.

34
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:55,960
What did you do to Dr. Jamie?

35
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:00,680
She didn't seem to recall the past completely, so I wanted to help.

36
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,010
Those memories are not worth remembering.

37
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:07,200
That day, I was abandoned alone in the dark.

38
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,600
The fear of having been left alone in the world.

39
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:15,670
How scary and cruel that is, you two should find out!

40
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:46,580
I was only trying find my little sister because she tried to return to the village.

41
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,300
Yes, blood is thicker than water.

42
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:53,250
So...our lives didn't matter?

43
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:31,170
Indeed, the best test subject of White Night Village is special.

44
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:35,530
But what will you do about your little sister?

45
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:02,380
  Awaken

46
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:06,860
  Episode 13

47
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:16,490
This car...isn't it too quiet?

48
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:20,680
It's a hybrid, so it's quiet and nice. Problem?

49
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,280
No, but how did you know to come?

50
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:29,230
You're the one who kindly filed a report saying that you were at White Night Village.

51
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:31,530
I knew from that report.

52
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:34,210
Is Dr. Jamie alright?

53
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:36,180
Yes, she'll be fine.

54
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,260
That's a relief.

55
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:43,570
Lee Ji Wuk, do you actually believe that I'm not the culprit?

56
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:51,390
And I'm sure you also know what you must do aside from just provocatively inflaming the public

57
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:55,280
I got it, I got it, so let's just go quietly, yes?

58
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:59,820
I'll be quiet.

59
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:25,700
I will just think about what the right thing to do is.

60
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,470
Reporter Lee.

61
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:47,210
Yes, well...that...

62
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:50,560
thanks...take good care of Dr. Jamie, will you?

63
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,650
Sure, see you soon. And don't forget what I said.

64
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:55,520
See you.

65
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:15,620
Did things go well? Where were you?

66
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:19,180
White Night Village.

67
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:22,150
White Night Village...why were you there?

68
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:26,160
Because that woman Jamie Leighton was there.

69
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:30,630
I could have finished everything

70
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:33,420
if Do Jeong Wu hadn't shown up.

71
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:13,260
Are you feeling better?

72
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:16,230
My head feels like it will explode.

73
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:18,750
That guy gave you drugs.

74
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:21,050
How did you find me?

75
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:24,040
Standing here next to you reminds me of the past.

76
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:28,410
That office in the observatory when we were looking into Son Min Ho's villa, I mean.

77
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:31,680
Don't spout nonsense.

78
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,970
I remember everything now.

79
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:39,680
28 years ago, that day of disaster in the White Night Village,

80
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:42,680
I remember what we did.

81
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:54,140
To escape from the village 28 years ago as children,

82
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:57,610
there was no other way but to use the adults.

83
00:10:57,610 --> 00:11:01,520
Someone who thought the things that were going on were a problem,

84
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:06,900
we believed someone like that must exist.

85
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:11,360
In real life, we couldn't imagine it because of the pressures of power

86
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:17,040
but if we cause someone to become deluded that that reality was a dream

87
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,960
then maybe that would arouse good will in someone and help us.

88
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:24,510
I remember thinking that.

89
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,770
Good will.

90
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:34,150
But I thought wrong.

91
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:38,370
What I kept in my heart wasn't kindness or goodwill,

92
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:43,180
it was evil, hatred and loathing.

93
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:49,770
For them, they were more important than the children.

94
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:53,190
No, they had no consideration for the children at all.

95
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:56,100
They hated and loathed each other.

96
00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:00,660
The grudges against each other that they'd hidden deep in their hearts

97
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:03,280
began to inflame like fire.

98
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:06,160
Then they fall into delusion that they are dreaming.

99
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:11,890
And that is how they come to smile, as they die and kill.

100
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:17,190
I thought you were making the adults do those things on purpose.

101
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:20,490
Is that why you called me a monster?

102
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:35,520
I did not want to acknowledge that that horrendous monster tried to save my life.

103
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:41,640
Even though I forgot everything else, as time went on, the monster became more vivid in my memory.

104
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:47,520
Because the monster in my memory had such a sad look on his face.

105
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:53,090
The monster that saved me.

106
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:04,530
Why didn't you tell me?

107
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:07,490
That you were my twin brother?

108
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:14,040
I feel like too much time has passed for a family reunion.

109
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:20,780
You should return to America. There's nothing but danger for you here.

110
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:23,070
What is it that you are trying to do?

111
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:31,730
Dr. Jamie.

112
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:36,930
Return to your true family.

113
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:45,370
This is no place for you to be. The happiness you found after so much difficulty,

114
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:47,750
don't lose it again.

115
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:51,510
Staff Captain Do. No...

116
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:53,770
No?

117
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:55,290
No, what?

118
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:58,030
My true family includes you.

119
00:13:58,030 --> 00:14:02,400
You promised to protect me.

120
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:14,210
 I'll protect you.

121
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:19,010
If you thought you could protect me by excluding me from this matter

122
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:21,480
then you are wrong.

123
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,780
I'll stay right here.

124
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:39,760
Do you know how much money it took to to sponsor the foundation all this time?

125
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:43,740
Despite that, it appears the foundation is unable to control the situation at all.

126
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:48,520
There shouldn't be any further threats. And Hospital Director Lee Byeong Seon's position will be filled soon.

127
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:53,830
This is no light matter, considering how much we spent already.

128
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:57,140
Why don't you remember how you made that money?

129
00:14:57,140 --> 00:15:01,180
Mr. Chief of Staff, I'm not sure why you are so protective of the Foundation.

130
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:02,880
Aren't we all in the same position?

131
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:07,780
Mr. Chief of Staff, even you haven't met with His Excellency for a long time, have you?

132
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:11,920
Perhaps he already passed away?

133
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,710
Please watch what you say.

134
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:15,770
But you didn't see him yourself, did you?

135
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:19,110
This is an experiment for which an astronomical amount of money was spent.

136
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:24,240
Isn't it about time we see results?

137
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:49,990
Now there are two children left.

138
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:56,950
The test subject supply has become more difficult to obtain, so this is worrisome.

139
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,840
I don't think the problem is the supply of test subjects.

140
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:05,280
The problem is our experiment which is showing no progress.

141
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:10,990
We don't have a lot of time.

142
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,400
The members of the Foundation will no longer just standby and watch us.

143
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,100
So is Do Jeong Wu the answer, after all?

144
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:24,680
Do Jeong Wu doesn't have much time left either, due to the brain injuries he sustained during the experiments.

145
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,880
We must find the formula before it is too late.

146
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,290
No matter what.

147
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:40,290
Old Man.

148
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,380
What about Lieutenant Gong? When I woke up, she was gone.

149
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:50,750
If this one guy wakes up, I can handle him.

150
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:53,920
Is that supposed to impress me?

151
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:57,780
Is he still dreaming?

152
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:01,970
He was like this since you brought him, and he seems not interested in waking up.

153
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:03,740
Are you hurt anywhere?

154
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:08,660
Since when did you care about my well-being? Thanks though.

155
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:12,270
This guy, always talking back.

156
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:15,920
So how are you going to find the secret laboratory now?

157
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:18,310
The secret lab?

158
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:26,650
There is a way.

159
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:29,700
Don't you have to keep monitoring those social welfare facilities?

160
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:33,490
As long as they know that we've followed them, they won't be taking children away for a while.

161
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:36,680
They'll probably stay in deep hiding.

162
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:43,390
When they conducted research for decades without progress, there is a high possibility those children will be sacrificed.

163
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:45,780
So we have to find it quickly.

164
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:50,870
Hold on a second. Hold on

165
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:53,260
Hold on.

166
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,980
- Where was the accident? 
 - The accident?

167
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,500
Here.

168
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:03,010
It in the outskirts of the city.

169
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:05,550
So the accident happened along this road.

170
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:08,410
And the car taking the children continued on this road.

171
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:08,970
Right.

172
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:14,020
If you look at this road, it travels on the outskirts of the city and within 30 minutes, it meets another city's center.

173
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:18,560
They probably didn't build a secret laboratory at the center of a city, where they would be observed by others.

174
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:24,960
If they took children from the social welfare center and went along the outskirts, before they came to another city center,

175
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,770
it makes me think that the secret laboratory would be in this area.

176
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,250
Thank you.

177
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:41,600
You still haven't found Gyeong Min?

178
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,130
No, not yet.

179
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:48,340
What exactly are you capable of doing?

180
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:53,550
I saved you when you couldn't find your own way. You ungrateful boy.

181
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:56,220
I apologize. I'll find him soon.

182
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:58,890
- Did you check the CCTV at home? 
 - Yes.

183
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:00,710
He was in his room the entire time.

184
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:04,750
After his psychologist visited him, he left his room after a long while.

185
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:14,290
 Drug Dealer

186
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:20,530
- Hello? 
 - I thought you might be looking for me.

187
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,660
Do Jeong Wu?

188
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:26,720
Have you been well?

189
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:31,840
I want to visit you, but there is so much military all over, the security is so awe-inspiring.

190
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,530
In any case, Oh Gyeong Min is doing fine.

191
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:35,530
Are you sure about that?

192
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:38,660
What an attentive father, caring about his drug-addict son.

193
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:41,480
He's been sleeping for several days, so don't worry too much.

194
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,730
What is it that you want?

195
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:47,000
I told you already last time.

196
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,320
Where is the secret laboratory and the support fund?

197
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:55,770
If you want to find your son, three days from now at 3 p.m., come to the vacant lot on Street 3 off of Hanjo.

198
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:58,450
If you escort me to the secret laboratory, I will return your son to you.

199
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:01,050
Do you think I will give you that information so easily?

200
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:06,150
I'm not trying to force you. I'm just saying you should do that if you want to find your son.

201
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:21,650
But Old Man, is this really the right place?

202
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:24,310
I told you that it is.

203
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:27,090
The scope is too large.

204
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:31,710
It may be the outskirts, but there are dozens of factories, farms, and storage facilities.

205
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:34,990
How can we find the secret laboratory here?

206
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:37,390
Maybe you're underestimating me?

207
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:41,610
A laboratory will definitely have an emergency power generator.

208
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:46,760
For a hospital or a laboratory, losing electricity for even one second could be fatal.

209
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:50,120
So they usually have pretty big emergency power generators built in.

210
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,960
Especially if they are performing human experiments.

211
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:57,800
So the secret laboratory would be where such an emergency generator is installed?

212
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:00,700
You are smart.

213
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,170
Very smart.

214
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:11,380
What? What now?

215
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:15,690
So all the records of all emergency power generators that were sold and installed in this area, and their current status. Okay?

216
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:20,280
I knew you'd ask for that. Don't worry.

217
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,600
Yes, I trust only you.

218
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,390
That's right, trust me.

219
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:16,290
Moon Jae Wung has returned.

220
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:18,490
Is that so? Where has he been?

221
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:20,040
He said he visited the White Night Village.

222
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:23,290
White Night Village? Why there?

223
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:25,770
Did he also go because of Jamie Leighton—

224
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:30,050
Yes. And he said that Do Jeong Wu was there as well.

225
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:32,900
What? Do Jeong Wu?

226
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,070
Yes.

227
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:37,700
 He said that he failed to kill Jamie Leighton because Do Jeong Wu interfered.

228
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,730
Look at this bastard.

229
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:44,190
 Was Oh Gyeong Min the bait to catch Do Jeong Wu from the start?

230
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:46,450
What do you intend to do now?

231
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,430
Is Dr. Jamie okay now?

232
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:24,560
Yes, she's fine.

233
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:28,300
She wasn't poisoned by the drugs. She probably just had some headaches.

234
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,980
That's a relief.

235
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:32,800
But how did Son Min Ho come to the forewarned murder site?

236
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,820
It seems that there was an information leak.

237
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:38,700
He came because he thought that I would be there.

238
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:44,410
Aside from the fact that it's related to White Night Village, I don't know anything.

239
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:48,470
Do you think you can handle it?

240
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:55,280
Yes, please tell me.

241
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:59,270
White Night Foundation.

242
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:00,920
White Night Foundation?

243
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:05,520
Cartel. Trust. Foundation. It doesn't matter what you call it.

244
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:10,100
A group of vested interests trying to maintain their power in our country, shall we say?

245
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:14,490
And if they began human experiments?

246
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:18,370
What are they trying to gain from the human experiments?

247
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:24,150
Imagine that you've gotten all the power and money in your hands.

248
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:27,000
Then what will you want next?

249
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,160
Eternal life.

250
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:42,200
So what my dad was researching was life without death?

251
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,000
No way.

252
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:51,360
To possess awesome power and strength and to live forever,

253
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,300
that is what White Night Foundation wants.

254
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:02,290
Have you decided?

255
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:04,500
I will help you, too.

256
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:11,420
 Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency

257
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:13,510
So there are no victims.

258
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:16,520
This is making me apprehensive.

259
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:19,290
Why can't I get in contact with her?

260
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:22,010
Hey, Jang Ji Wan. Is this the time for that?

261
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:24,040
- Won't you come to your senses?
 - Sorry.

262
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,470
Doctor.

263
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:32,150
Did you have a good visit at White Night Village?

264
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:34,910
Sure, it was a good trip.

265
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:36,820
Did you find out anything?

266
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:38,100
I found out a lot.

267
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:41,320
Enough that I am grateful to be alive right now.

268
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,660
Has something happened?

269
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:49,830
- Hey, Gong!
 - Hey.

270
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:51,950
Why won't you answer your phone?

271
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:54,670
I was occupied. Sorry.

272
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,500
I am relieved to see you safe, Doctor.

273
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:58,540
You already knew, Lieutenant Gong.

274
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:01,660
What? Knew what? What did she know?

275
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,500
Oh, right, Gong. What about Oh Gyeong Min?

276
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:06,680
He's fine. He's with Team Leader.

277
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:10,480
What happened between them?

278
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:18,820
Is this where you wanted to go?

279
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:20,810
You should eat spicy food when you feel stress.

280
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:22,710
I don't eat stimulating foods well.

281
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:24,700
Let's go in.

282
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:42,700
Are you going to put in everything that is here?

283
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:45,570
Just trust me and follow.

284
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:54,530
Owner, please give us more cheese balls.

285
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:57,650
Lieutenant Gong, you sure are energetic.

286
00:26:57,650 --> 00:26:58,850
Eating spicy rice cakes at a time like this.

287
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:02,080
We should eat well at times like this.

288
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:15,020
Thank you.

289
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:31,160
It tastes good, doesn't it?

290
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:34,340
Yes.

291
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:36,610
Here are the cheese balls you ordered.

292
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:38,650
- Thank you.
 - Enjoy.

293
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:41,940
Excuse me, are you from the U.S.?

294
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,580
How did you know that?

295
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:47,620
I can read faces. You can't eat spicy foods well, can you?

296
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:50,620
This is on the house. Americans can't eat spicy food.

297
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:51,890
Thank you.

298
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:54,680
"Spicy foods are totally annoying."

299
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:06,350
So that's why the third child was at the White Night Village.

300
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:08,210
It's a good thing that Team Leader went.

301
00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:13,660
If Staff Captain Do didn't come to rescue me, I would be buried in that ruined village right now.

302
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:17,480
I recovered my memories and my life was saved.

303
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:20,840
Perhaps I should be grateful to that third child and Staff Captain Do Jeong Wu.

304
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:23,530
How can you say that?

305
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:33,730
He is my twin brother.

306
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:37,280
Huh? Who is?

307
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,710
Staff Captain Do Jeong Wu.

308
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:45,930
My memory isn't totally clear, but we were always together.

309
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:48,800
I think we were very close.

310
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:17,510
Yes, Mr. Chief of Staff, how are you?

311
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:19,840
What happened to Do Jeong Wu?

312
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:23,140
I'm sorry. I am afraid I don't have anything to tell you.

313
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:26,750
 I will do my best so that I can give you good news.

314
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:30,020
But may I ask why—

315
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:33,270
It appears that Do Jeong Wu kidnapped my son.

316
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:36,020
What? Do Jeong Wu?

317
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:40,810
What? What is it?

318
00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:42,900
I got a call from Son Min Ho.

319
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:43,990
What does he want now?

320
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:48,170
He said that Gong Hye Won and the other members of the special team took Chief of Staff Oh Jeong Hwan's son.

321
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:52,190
What are you saying? I just got a call from Chief of Staff Oh Jeong Hwan.

322
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:54,260
He said Do Jeong Wu took his son.

323
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:57,370
What? Not Gong Hye Won?

324
00:29:57,370 --> 00:29:58,790
What are you saying?

325
00:29:58,790 --> 00:30:04,130
So did Gong Hye Won take him? Or Do Jeong Wu?

326
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:06,630
Oh, this special team.

327
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,150
- I got five. 
 - Where?

328
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:11,700
There are five. One, two, three, four, five.

329
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:20,110
These bastards. What are you guys going around and going? Huh?

330
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:23,640
Where is the son of the President's Chief of Staff?

331
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:27,360
I'm not sure what you mean.

332
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:30,100
You told us to be on standby, so we were watching the office.

333
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:32,560
These guys, seriously.

334
00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:44,670
If Do Jeong Wu or Gong Hye Won calls, report to me immediately. Got it?

335
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:46,600
Yes.

336
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:49,920
I won't live my full life span because of you guys.

337
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,800
My anger is boiling.

338
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,550
Keep doing that.

339
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:58,430
Keep it up.

340
00:31:06,410 --> 00:31:09,250
I thought I would die from my heart trembling so much.

341
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:12,740
How did you become a police officer if you are so timid?

342
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:17,310
- Keep it up, she said. So let's keep going.
 - Yes.

343
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:20,420
Why is this boy not waking up?

344
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:23,170
He's alive, right?

345
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:25,500
It's like hypnosis.

346
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:29,480
If he wakes up, it will be bothersome. So just let him sleep.

347
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:33,540
Old Man, did you look into those emergency generators?

348
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:35,870
Yes.

349
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:39,890
I looked into current status of the emergency generators that were sold and being operated in that area.

350
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:41,710
But there were too many.

351
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:47,880
I couldn't find the exact time periods, and most building are required to install one these days.

352
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:59,210
What now? You were so confident before.

353
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:04,440
Then you better do something else that's bothersome.

354
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:12,070
What is he going to ask me to do now?

355
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:15,920
This is really terrifying.

356
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:18,970
How can this be happening in our country?

357
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:22,220
It may seem like a movie, but everything recorded in there really happened.

358
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:25,200
Actually, before we met the third child in White Night Village,

359
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,950
someone locked us up.

360
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:29,050
Do you know how scary that was?

361
00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:35,220
It must be on orders from someone who doesn't want White Night Village to be exposed to the world.

362
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:39,300
So that would mean that those people involved with White Night Village still have some power.

363
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:42,740
They're still holding onto power after decades have passed?

364
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:45,300
That is only further proof that this is not an individual.

365
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:48,980
That means a powerful organization exists.

366
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:52,900
And they must all be afraid of the truth.

367
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:05,230
Seeing the materials that Lieutenant Gong Hye Won gave me,

368
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:08,770
a lot of military personnel were involved in the White Night Village project.

369
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:14,020
Of course, in those days, the military regime was nearing its end.

370
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:16,450
But based on the size of the village and the style of their work,

371
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:22,450
there is a high possibility that this was a project planned by the government.

372
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:28,490
If you think about the influence of the military in Korean history, that could be true.

373
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:32,950
The project failed, but they continued to pursue their goals.

374
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:38,860
So they must be hiding somewhere, maintaining their power.

375
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:44,700
Just how are you taking care of things?

376
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:50,790
The three children won't back down, and now Do Jeong Wu has my son.

377
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:54,190
Do Jeong Wu has your son? Not Gong Hye Won?

378
00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:56,360
What were you thinking?

379
00:33:56,360 --> 00:34:00,820
The third child tried to trap Do Jeong Wu

380
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:04,110
so he sent a forewarning notice of murder with your son as the target.

381
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:07,400
But they both failed to show up at the site.

382
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:17,070
Mr. Son, so you knew that my son was the target?

383
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,180
No.

384
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:25,410
I only found out he was your son when I arrived there.

385
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,020
I'm sure this isn't true,

386
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:34,930
but if you are hiding something from me that I do not know,

387
00:34:34,930 --> 00:34:38,020
and if something happens to my son,

388
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:41,740
you should look for your grave instead of a director's position in the foundation.

389
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:46,700
I will do whatever it takes to find your son.

390
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,680
Where are you going?

391
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:22,380
I am going to do something bothersome.

392
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:26,880
We have to go find the secret laboratory.

393
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,500
Let's go together.

394
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:33,410
He won't be waking up due to the hypnosis, but please watch over him.

395
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:36,640
I told you that I would help you.

396
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,680
Let's go together.

397
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:03,340
We can't find it using documents, so we have to confirm it ourselves.

398
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:04,970
Confirm it ourselves?

399
00:36:04,970 --> 00:36:10,280
Yes, Old Man will send an electric signal to a substation.

400
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:16,180
Then the substation will interpret it as an overload, block the control panel, and cause it to cut off electricity.

401
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:20,470
So buildings like hospitals or laboratories that have industrial sized emergency generators

402
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:24,190
are set to begin working within 10 seconds of the power failure.

403
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:29,070
If we can find that light in the darkness, we can narrow down the spot we're looking for.

404
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:32,070
Yes, Old Man, I'm ready.

405
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:35,390
Alright, I'm sending the signal now.

406
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:02,170
One, two,

407
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:05,420
three, four.

408
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:15,120
Is he alright?

409
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:18,500
Eight, nine,

410
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:20,440
ten.

411
00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:26,980
I think he will be fine.

412
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:29,320
The power did go out briefly.

413
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:34,170
But the emergency generator began working right away, so they should be okay.

414
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:47,650
It seems all the lights have returned.

415
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:49,070
You recorded it, didn't you?

416
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:50,680
Yes.

417
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:56,410
Alright, Old Man. We're done. Withdraw.

418
00:37:58,060 --> 00:38:00,810
This is the first time this has happened.

419
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:16,710
Hello.

420
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:19,150
Is there a lot of reasons for the emergency generator to run around here?

421
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:23,490
We run it once in a while for the animal feed. But not often.

422
00:39:23,490 --> 00:39:25,750
Thank you.

423
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:29,880
Is everything alright?

424
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:35,200
I tried rapidly increasing the medication and the adverse reaction is severe.

425
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:39,240
If we fail with these two children, it will make research more difficult for the time being.

426
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:42,720
But it's temporary, so there is no need for worry.

427
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:46,340
We must somehow find a way for new supply of test subjects.

428
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:48,570
Yes.

429
00:40:48,570 --> 00:40:51,110
I heard there was a power failure last night.

430
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:54,210
It was brief, but it was the first time it's happened.

431
00:40:54,210 --> 00:40:56,050
But the emergency generator began working right away

432
00:40:56,050 --> 00:40:59,180
so there wasn't any problems maintaining their lives.

433
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:01,760
That is a relief.

434
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:07,170
But I heard that your daughter took my son away.

435
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:09,180
Did you know about that?

436
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:11,090
What did you say?

437
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:32,480
 National Central Memorial Park

438
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:38,400
I expect that she took him to Do Jeong Wu.

439
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,540
Yes, it appears so.

440
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:43,870
In fact, I received a call from Do Jeong Wu.

441
00:41:43,870 --> 00:41:49,930
Does your daughter know about White Night Village, by any chance?

442
00:41:52,870 --> 00:41:55,600
- Yes.
 - How much does she know?

443
00:41:57,940 --> 00:42:04,840
And when they followed us last time, your daughter took Do Jeong Wu. Do they have a special relationship?

444
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:08,080
Yes, it appears so.

445
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:10,170
I see.

446
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:14,610
I will do whatever it takes to persuade her.

447
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:28,040
It appears that we have a guest.

448
00:43:31,490 --> 00:43:34,980
So he came here on his own two feet.

449
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:37,420
- You must not.
 - What are you doing right now?

450
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:40,200
On the off-chance that Do Jeong Wu escapes,

451
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:46,240
it's the same as telling the world ourselves about this secret laboratory that's been hidden for decades.

452
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:51,440
We wanted him so much, but now is not the time.

453
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,450
It appears that the power failure last night wasn't a coincidence.

454
00:44:48,330 --> 00:44:49,450
Did you find something out?

455
00:44:49,450 --> 00:44:53,760
Well, I didn't find anything in particular.

456
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:58,740
And the places I visited here mid-sized factories or animal barns.

457
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:01,120
I met with the people and didn't see anything unusual.

458
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:05,050
I'm sure they wouldn't have bothered making that place at all if it was so easy to find.

459
00:45:05,050 --> 00:45:07,890
They had successfully stayed hidden for decades, continuing their secret experiments.

460
00:45:07,890 --> 00:45:11,060
I'm sure it's very well hidden.

461
00:45:11,870 --> 00:45:16,000
I am sure that it's definitely in this area.

462
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,920
Where can it be, secret laboratory?

463
00:45:21,350 --> 00:45:23,370
Um, Team Leader?

464
00:45:23,370 --> 00:45:25,370
Yes, what?

465
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:34,580
 Mom

466
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:37,050
You don't have to visit home?

467
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:43,110
You should visit home. You said your mother is home alone.

468
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:47,110
Then I'll visit briefly and return here.

469
00:45:50,730 --> 00:45:53,300
And by the way,

470
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:58,090
there is still a chance for you to leave this work. You don't have to return.

471
00:45:58,830 --> 00:46:02,110
If something is wrong, I must set it right.

472
00:46:02,110 --> 00:46:04,250
I'll be back.

473
00:46:17,930 --> 00:46:22,270
Please don't come back. Please don't come back.

474
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:32,050
Why? What are you looking at?

475
00:46:32,050 --> 00:46:33,880
Very strange.

476
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:36,020
Why won't you tell her? You are meeting with Oh Jeong Hwan.

477
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:39,940
Well, the two of us are more than enough to handle something at this level.

478
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:42,800
Do we really need help from a woman?

479
00:46:43,670 --> 00:46:46,520
Is that so?

480
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:50,310
But can we take that guy, when he is like this?

481
00:46:59,730 --> 00:47:01,000
What are you going to do?

482
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:06,840
To completely wake someone while in 'lucid dream' state, just make sure that

483
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:09,560
the day and night that his own eyes can perceive

484
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:13,090
and the day and night his brain can recognize match.

485
00:47:13,090 --> 00:47:15,490
That is why I brought him to this rooftop.

486
00:47:15,490 --> 00:47:19,580
It's difficult to recognize day and night in the basement.

487
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:26,250
This watch made him confused about the day and night in reality and in his dream.

488
00:47:31,830 --> 00:47:35,080
First, this medication will take effect

489
00:47:36,630 --> 00:47:39,390
and he will regain consciousness.

490
00:48:03,450 --> 00:48:05,330
But he's sleeping again.

491
00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:09,630
Oh Gyeong Min, wake up.

492
00:48:20,790 --> 00:48:22,860
Are you waking up now?

493
00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:25,520
The situation is not great, is it?

494
00:48:42,090 --> 00:48:45,050
What do you plan to do now?

495
00:48:45,050 --> 00:48:48,530
Not sure. What should I do?

496
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:54,600
What is this?

497
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:57,780
 Search term comparison among portal sites

498
00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:02,900
 Immediately after we reported about a new forewarning of murder a few days ago

499
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:08,630
 Director Lee Byeong Seon of Hangang Hospital and his son Lee Tae Su died.

500
00:49:08,630 --> 00:49:14,190
 Director Lee Byeong Seon stabbed his own stomach with a weapon for unknown reasons.

501
00:49:14,190 --> 00:49:20,050
 And his son Lee Tae Su jumped off the rooftop of his building and ended his life.

502
00:49:20,050 --> 00:49:23,940
 Of course, more research is needed for these cases.

503
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:28,660
 But based on what we know so far, except for Kim Yeong Jun, the first victim of the forewarned murders,

504
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:34,500
 the remaining victims are all related to White Night Village.

505
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:37,400
 Please look at the next screen.

506
00:49:37,430 --> 00:49:39,840
 These are the only two people who trespassed into his office

507
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:42,690
 before Lee Tae Su jumped from the building.

508
00:49:42,690 --> 00:49:48,280
 We believe that one of these people is the most likely suspect of these forewarned serial killings

509
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:54,380
 as well as one of the children who survived the White Night Village.

510
00:49:54,380 --> 00:49:59,460
 Perhaps this person is carrying out revenge regarding the events of White Night Village?

511
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:05,380
 Who is he? And how is he related to Do Jeong Wu who was previously accused as the culprit?

512
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:10,230
 And what is the real truth behind what happened in White Night Village?

513
00:50:10,230 --> 00:50:15,880
 In the future we will bring in-depth news coverage to all the viewers to let you know the truth.

514
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:20,500
 Taking one step closer to current events, this has been Lee Ji Wuk of Current Events Zoom-In.

515
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:24,180
I should have killed that bastard, Lee Ji Wuk.

516
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:26,870
What do we do now?

517
00:50:26,870 --> 00:50:32,200
I have to speed up the revenge against White Night Foundation.

518
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:34,270
So who's next?

519
00:50:35,750 --> 00:50:37,770
Who do you think?

520
00:50:37,770 --> 00:50:40,330
 Caused a commotion at Guyeong Middle School for being gifted, turned out to be a survivor of White Night Village

521
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:47,000
 Caused a commotion at Guyeong Middle School for being gifted, turned out to be a survivor of White Night Village

522
00:50:55,810 --> 00:50:57,930
I'm home.

523
00:50:57,930 --> 00:51:00,610
How many days has it been?

524
00:51:00,610 --> 00:51:02,680
Have you heard from Hye Won?

525
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:06,380
She takes after you. Once she's immersed in her work, she doesn't think about anything else.

526
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:08,550
Have you aged? You never asked about her before.

527
00:51:08,550 --> 00:51:10,450
Just asking.

528
00:51:10,450 --> 00:51:13,540
You two Gongs had a fight, didn't you?

529
00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:18,920
Hye Won also looked like she was holding her tongue, and you're asking questions you never used to.

530
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:21,710
You should be the first to give in.

531
00:51:21,710 --> 00:51:26,140
They say you can't assume you can control your child these days.

532
00:51:26,140 --> 00:51:27,120
Who says so?

533
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:29,100
I watch TV.

534
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:32,360
That is the mood these days.

535
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:34,810
I'm home.

536
00:51:34,810 --> 00:51:38,850
Our daughter is home. Speak of the devil.

537
00:51:46,470 --> 00:51:51,070
Hye Won, how about quitting your job now?

538
00:51:51,070 --> 00:51:56,210
If you quit your job, I'll quit mine.

539
00:51:56,210 --> 00:52:01,350
I know it's difficult for you to understand, but my work is my entire life.

540
00:52:01,350 --> 00:52:05,480
That may be true, but what you are doing is definitely wrong.

541
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:09,230
If I succeed at this, it will be a turning point in human history.

542
00:52:09,230 --> 00:52:13,460
No matter what, you cannot justify the sacrifice of children.

543
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:22,040
I thought you'd understand my work a little bit.

544
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:27,210
Where is Oh Gyeong Min right now?

545
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:32,040
You really do know a lot.

546
00:52:33,020 --> 00:52:36,720
Tell me where the secret laboratory is.

547
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:43,010
Hye Won. Sometimes, it's better to just not know anything.

548
00:52:43,010 --> 00:52:47,470
Oh Jeong Hwan is a much more dangerous person than you realize.

549
00:52:47,470 --> 00:52:51,420
So hurry and return his son. I am requesting you, as your father.

550
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:54,300
- Don't do such dangerous work.
 - Dad.

551
00:52:54,330 --> 00:52:56,960
I told you so many times, Do Jeong Wu is trying to use you.

552
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:00,740
This has nothing to do with Team Leader.

553
00:53:00,740 --> 00:53:03,320
It's not too late, Dad.

554
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:07,810
Even now, please correct what is wrong.

555
00:53:11,260 --> 00:53:14,020
Looks like we don't have anything more to talk about.

556
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:41,370
Let's go.

557
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:55,500
Where are we going?

558
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:57,880
Where do you think we are going?

559
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:03,330
We have to go see Dad. Your dad.

560
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:07,560
Oh Jeong Hwan.

561
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:48,650
Hello?

562
00:54:48,650 --> 00:54:49,800
It's me, I'm here.

563
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:51,730
How did you know my phone number?

564
00:54:51,730 --> 00:54:53,690
I just knew it.

565
00:54:53,690 --> 00:54:56,620
Confirm that my son is fine.

566
00:54:57,490 --> 00:54:58,870
Dad!

567
00:54:58,870 --> 00:55:01,840
Oh, Gyeong Min, it's Dad. Be calm.

568
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:03,940
And don't worry.

569
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:10,270
Shall we begin our deal now? Lead me to the secret laboratory.

570
00:55:10,270 --> 00:55:12,090
Follow me.

571
00:55:35,820 --> 00:55:39,630
See if there are any other cars following us, except for Do Jeong Wu's.

572
00:55:39,630 --> 00:55:41,730
Yes, I understand.

573
00:56:47,450 --> 00:56:48,990
What do you think you're doing?

574
00:56:48,990 --> 00:56:52,880
Did you really think I would tell you the location of the secret laboratory so easily?

575
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:56,150
You're not going to take your son?

576
00:56:56,250 --> 00:57:00,450
I can't turn over in one moment something that I've protected my entire life.

577
00:57:54,870 --> 00:58:01,920

578
00:58:03,060 --> 00:58:09,690
♫  Set me free, I see you at the end of this road  ♫

579
00:58:09,690 --> 00:58:16,960
♫  Let me see, I am not afraid  ♫

580
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:23,520
♫  If you can come just a little bit closer  ♫

581
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:29,720
♫  At the end of truth  ♫

582
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:33,120
♫  Set me free  ♫

583
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:36,090
 Awaken

584
00:58:36,090 --> 00:58:37,200
 Where is my daughter?

585
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:40,190
 You brought me to the Special Team because of Dad, didn't you?

586
00:58:40,190 --> 00:58:42,800
 There isn't anything we can change.

587
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:47,860
 Perhaps we can use the serum of the children who were experimented on at White Night Village.

588
00:58:47,860 --> 00:58:50,420
 Why did you come all this way?

589
00:58:50,420 --> 00:58:54,450
 You should become the subject of the experiment earlier. You've lived for too long.

590
00:58:54,450 --> 00:58:57,190
 He struggled to survive, in whatever way he could.

591
00:58:57,190 --> 00:59:00,190
 It's been a long time, my son.

592
00:59:00,190 --> 00:59:05,240
 There isn't much time. I have to find it quickly.
