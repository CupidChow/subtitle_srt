1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:09,050

2
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:38,970
 Awaken

3
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:51,000
 Episode 6

4
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,420
 No Connection

5
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:10,220
 No Network Available

6
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,050
What? Why is the internet not working?

7
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:23,740
Is it just the internet? The phone doesn't work, either.

8
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:27,340
Is it a safe house if you can contact the outside world as per your wish?

9
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,870
Ta-da.

10
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:34,120
Mine works.

11
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,140
Acting like a careless fool, is that really you or is it acting?

12
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:37,260
Acting.

13
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:40,110
While attending Police Academy, I passed the bar exam and the Administrative Exam

14
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:41,560
with the highest scores. You didn't know that, did you?

15
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,720
I'm smart.

16
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,830
I got good grades.

17
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,950
Why do you act, then?

18
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:58,020
You are good at diverting the attention of the people by drawing out someone's wrongdoing,

19
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,020
and instigating people by stimulating them.

20
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:03,650
But I feel like there is something else that

21
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:06,410
you are also good at.

22
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:08,700
Gosh, you...

23
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:11,390
And I, too, believe that just running away from a violent crime

24
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:15,950
saying that it's not the police's responsibility, assures me that you are good at something else, too.

25
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:36,360
That eccentric weirdo. Ugh.

26
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:02,030
Oh, my head.

27
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,090
What is going on?

28
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,770
When did I fall asleep?

29
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:17,870
At least you didn't drink the water.

30
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,430
What are you doing right now?

31
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:21,830
You see,

32
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:24,790
while trying to become famous, I over-stressed myself.

33
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:28,040
I collected as much information as I could.

34
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:34,120
And even acted like a scumbag.

35
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,220
A scumbag?

36
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:38,270
Suggesting publishing a serial to defend someone like you. Doesn't that make me a scumbag?

37
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:41,600
Reporter, watch what you say. There are limits to what I will let you get away with.

38
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:44,980
In any case, I thought that I had to stay near you.

39
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,900
Because no matter how much I follow him around, that bastard Do Jeong Wu is not letting the cat out of the bag.

40
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:51,000
So I thought that I could try sticking to you to see if I can get something. But—

41
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:53,690
What is it that you want to say?

42
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:56,560
That I found a prime location this time.

43
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,790
This location

44
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:02,150
is where you will die.

45
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:04,410
You've always been protected by intense security.

46
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:08,070
You never permit anyone to reach you since you're always apprehensive someone might hurt you anytime.

47
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:12,590
But now you've been designated as the next victim of a serial killing that's captured the nation's attention.

48
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:14,770
And due to that fire, you've dipped your foot in the River Styx and returned alive.

49
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:16,370
So you've become even more apprehensive.

50
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:19,560
In the end, you requested protection from the police.

51
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:23,880
And who would be the most trustworthy police officer among them?

52
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:40,000
 These cases are not a coincidence. Someone is after me

53
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,220
 I need a safe house where it's difficult for anyone to reach me.

54
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:45,280
 And my protectors must be the most trustworthy.

55
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:50,120
 Yes.  Assign that policeman who saved my life.

56
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:57,680
So it would have to be Staff Captain Do Jeong Wu who saved your life.

57
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,050
What kind of dog crap are you saying? Team leader?

58
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:13,400
He killed five people so he can kill Son Min Ho?

59
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,200
He made Son Min Ho the next victim so that he can reach him?

60
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:19,500
I don't know. I really do not know.All I know as of now

61
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,640
is that the person who is closest to Son Min Ho right now is Team Leader.

62
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:25,570
I can't even call him. This is so annoying.

63
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:34,220
It's not easy to get close to a tycoon like that who is so cautious.

64
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:36,330
So you have to make him want to get close to you.

65
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:41,430
The designated next victim of a series of strange killings that have captured the nation's attention, and a fire victim to boot.

66
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:44,550
Under such extreme circumstances, people's judgments become less discerning.

67
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:46,880
Then why did he rescue Son Min Ho during the accident?

68
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,890
I'm not sure.

69
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:51,560
Maybe because so much attention was being paid to that situation.

70
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:55,090
I concluded that Staff Captain Do Jeong Wu is the culprit after looking only at the results.

71
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:59,400
Because Staff Captain Do Jeong Wu is the only one in a position to kill Son Min Ho right now.

72
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:03,800
 I am from White Night Village.

73
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:16,300
This won't do.

74
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:19,200
First, let's leave this place quickly.

75
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:06,630
Gosh, you found a place like this so well.

76
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:08,370
Are you alright?

77
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:11,250
I've gotten old.

78
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,840
Right.

79
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,440
One bad decision which is enough to blot out

80
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,450
your life of extreme caution,

81
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:19,640
your precious life is hanging on that one moment.

82
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,850
What is certain

83
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:23,280
is that I can no longer judge who I can trust and who I cannot—

84
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,160
But by your nature you don't trust people.

85
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:48,540
Go to the first floor.

86
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:03,910
They're not here.

87
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:06,950
Seeing the car is still here, they must have left on foot.

88
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:08,880
We will go down that way.

89
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,360
We will go to the foot of the mountain.

90
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,830
Yes.

91
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:19,590
If someone is stupid or shallow, they can be useful in their own way.

92
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:22,320
But if stupid and shallow people are too greedy,

93
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,610
sometimes they jump into the trap, without realizing that they are rabbits being hunted.

94
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:27,710
Why are you doing this?

95
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:42,600
In an empty street,

96
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:46,930
I am standing alone.

97
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,320
 Indeed.

98
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:53,090
 We're done now.

99
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:02,210
 Are you alright?

100
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:26,600
Why are you doing this now? A long time has passed.

101
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,890
A long time has passed.

102
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:31,160
Why the White Night Village? Wasn't it enough for you to have ruined everything there?

103
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,260
Even back then, you kids—

104
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:34,750
The sun is shining whitely

105
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:37,320
and the clock which is never wrong

106
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,020
indicates that it is midnight.

107
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,320
I wonder now

108
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:08,330
whether it is daytime

109
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:15,410
or night?

110
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:28,170
Right. I thought you were good with knives.

111
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,940
Who is the owner of the White Night Foundation?

112
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:46,270
It doesn't matter if you don't say it. The situation has already become this big

113
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:49,260
so I wonder if he will just appear on his own.

114
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:51,420
Your Excellency.

115
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:55,260
Ji Won Geun? Ji Won Geun is still alive?

116
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:58,820
If he's alive, wouldn't he be more than 100 years old now?

117
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:03,210
Looks like the official rules I've left behind have had their effects.

118
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:07,050
Of course, it wouldn't be perfect.

119
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:49,830
So it's still being researched, right?

120
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:51,560
I wouldn't know.

121
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:58,500
I've heard there is a secret laboratory.

122
00:12:58,530 --> 00:12:59,330
Where is it?

123
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:01,670
I don't know that either.

124
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,350
Then who would know?

125
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:06,700
Oh Jeong Hwan.  Chief Secretary at the Blue House (Korean presidential residence).

126
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:07,980
That guy

127
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,300
He is the key person at the foundation.

128
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:13,130
After the disaster happened

129
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:16,100
I was expelled from the foundation.

130
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:21,780
Your situation wasn't as great as it seemed.

131
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:39,340
Get off him right now!

132
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:45,820
Please stop.

133
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:47,760
Please...

134
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:20,780
It's fine, I'll do it.

135
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:40,640
So you remember?

136
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,440
Yes.

137
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:48,030
The first step is fear.

138
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:02,380
 Awaken

139
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:19,040
I am reporting on the serial killings that have happened over the past nine months.

140
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:24,680
Staff Captain Do Jeong Wu was arrested without a warrant at the safe house for suspicion of attempted murder.

141
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:28,640
Following this, Staff Captain Do Jeong Wu was removed from his position—

142
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,110
Just a moment ago, you said he was a hero among police officers.

143
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:33,460
Trying to raise this bastard as a hero,

144
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:36,430
do you know how much money we spent on publicity campaigns?

145
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:42,080
The culprit himself acknowledges it

146
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,240
but the crime M.O. hasn't been specified yet

147
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,360
- so the matter is currently under investigation. 
 - His motive?

148
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,100
His motive?

149
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:49,110
According to Dr. Jamie, it's related to White Night Village.

150
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:51,230
We are preparing a detailed report about this.

151
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:52,690
White Night Village?

152
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:56,520
How is this related to something that happened 28 years ago?

153
00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:00,860
The link  is Son Min Ho, who was in charge of White Night Village.

154
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:04,370
Wasn't White Night Village the key project of that foundation? 
  Chief Secretary of the President 
 Oh Jeong Hwan

155
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:07,930
 How can an experiment subject that went missing back then become a police officer?

156
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:10,650
 Does that mean that we do not have enough control over the police?

157
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:14,070
 In official documents, he is simply recorded as having come from an orphanage.

158
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:16,470
 We are looking into the reason why the other records are missing.

159
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:18,730
 We must find out who is responsible for this.

160
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:21,990
 Rather than blame the police, Mr. Son—

161
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:25,190
 Of course, this began from the police, so it is the fault of the police.

162
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:28,870
 If the foundation is harmed by this incident, the police must accept full responsibility—

163
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:32,320
There, there, let's save the fault-finding for after we solve the problem.

164
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,690
More importantly, did we take care of the reporter who was there when it happened?

165
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:40,430
 Lee Ji Wuk is all over the internet, and no one knows where he's going to bounce next.

166
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:42,860
 As it is, the public opinion about the police hasn't been good already—

167
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:46,230
While fearing your feet being cut off, you will get your waist cut instead.

168
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:49,720
If you cannot judge whether the foundation or the police is important

169
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:53,320
then maybe the foundation should judge you, Commissioner of the National Police Agency.

170
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:03,640
It's the police. Please get up and take your hands off.

171
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,620
Yes, I'm standing.

172
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:07,810
Yes, stand—

173
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:11,070
Your warrant? Is there a  warrant?

174
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:13,890
There is.

175
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:16,230
Take everything.

176
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:23,700
How scary. Let's be gentle.

177
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:26,100
Hold on.

178
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,990
Please give me your cell phone.

179
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:34,570
I lost it.

180
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:38,100
I was about to report the theft. Want to go together?

181
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,300
Please excuse us.

182
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:44,100
What are you doing? What are you doing right now?

183
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,270
Let's begin.

184
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:22,190
Deputy Chief was summoned by the Commissioner, so he went to the National Police Agency.

185
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,760
Affiliation, Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency.

186
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,460
Rank, Staff Captain.

187
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:34,020
Mr. Do Jeong Wu.

188
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:38,570
Regarding the murder of Kim Yeong Jun, Park Gyu Tae, Baek Seung Jae, Choi Yong Seok, and the attempted murder of Son Min Ho,

189
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:40,870
we request your testimony.

190
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:43,400
Your motive?

191
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,660
There is no God.

192
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:50,560
I was born in White Night Village.

193
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,360
 Hyeong, let's do it together. 
 - Okay.

194
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:07,530
 Wait a minute.  Can you draw a person's face here?

195
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:17,110
 What part of a person is this?

196
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:24,320
 Everyone, let's go eat.

197
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,060
 I'm excited.

198
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:28,630
 Let's go eat.

199
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:30,090
 Let's go.

200
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:49,750
 The village appeared to be a charity facility but in reality, it was a large experimental lab.

201
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:53,120
 The entire island itself was a laboratory.

202
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,430
 You are correct, it was human experimentation.

203
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:12,380
 That is what Son Min Ho did at that place.

204
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,920
 Hey, what's wrong?

205
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,150
 Hey, are you alright?

206
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:22,360
 Come to your senses. Hey.

207
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:24,590
 Are you alright?

208
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:28,110
 At first, I didn't know why my friends were getting sick.

209
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:30,020
 Or why

210
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:52,090
 some of them suddenly disappeared.

211
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,930
 Curiosity...

212
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:02,530
 ... killed the cat, they say.

213
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,850
 There is no God.

214
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:23,890
 Because if God existed, the people He would never forgive were living so well.

215
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:33,550
And I am one of the children who was experimented on.

216
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:46,200
But still, killing innocent people—

217
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,520
Innocent?

218
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:51,590
That's not true. They aren't the ones who are innocent.

219
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:56,350
The children who didn't know anything and became lab rats and died are innocent.

220
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:06,800
I think that should establish a motive. No?

221
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:10,590
The modus operandi of your crime?

222
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:17,810
Perhaps I should say that I realized how different I was from others as a result of those agonizing experiments?

223
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:20,880
Well, it wasn't very difficult.

224
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,230
I make them dream

225
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:25,020
without even knowing that they are dreaming.

226
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:30,800
They are led to believe that they can do whatever they want to because it's happening in their dream.

227
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,610
If they want to wake from their dream

228
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:35,880
they just have to do what they promised to do.

229
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:39,100
If they do that, then they can wake from their dream.

230
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:42,500
For example, the act that they most fear.

231
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:44,050
He said he had a fear of heights.

232
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:46,140
He really annoyed us.

233
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:51,620
He hated water, even for drinking.

234
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:55,390
He even avoided crosswalks, saying they were dangerous.

235
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:59,030
Indeed, he used the 'lucid dream' method.

236
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:05,530
I clearly provided them with a choice.

237
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:07,580
I gave them a chance to live.

238
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:11,270
They are the ones who refused that chance.

239
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:19,060
Because that was real and not a dream.

240
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:23,850
Just because they committed crimes, it doesn't mean that you can kill them.

241
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:27,500
They have committed crimes, but one cannot kill them.

242
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:30,900
Then why did you rescue Son Min Ho?

243
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:34,430
Do you really believe that if they are a criminal, you can kill them?

244
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:50,340
Something happened at White Night Village, didn't it?

245
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,400
Why did everyone there die? Did Son Min Ho kill them?

246
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,740
Is that why you're doing all this right now?

247
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:58,720
What is that kid asking, anyway?

248
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,650
- What are you doing?
 - We are prosecutors.

249
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:04,400
Mr. Do Jeong Wu, let's go.

250
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:10,110
If you receive a proposition, it will be best to just accept it and not try to dig in more.

251
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:12,720
Because you just heard something you shouldn't hear.

252
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:15,200
Curiosity

253
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:17,350
- killed the cat.
 - killed the cat.

254
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:19,220
Let's go.

255
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:38,630
- Please keep in touch.
 - Yes.

256
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:48,570
The prosecutors will take over the case?

257
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:49,730
Ah, that makes no sense.

258
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:52,130
It makes less sense for you guys to be involved.

259
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:54,890
Anyway, that's what the higher-ups have decided, so accept it.

260
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:56,580
But Director—

261
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:58,070
Commissioner's orders.

262
00:24:58,070 --> 00:24:59,700
Even so—

263
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,740
What?

264
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:07,260
I understand how all of you feel.

265
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:08,990
So this is why we're giving you vacation

266
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:12,140
and even giving you bonuses.

267
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:13,280
Be grateful.

268
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,520
What is a 'geum-il-bong?' (financial bonus)

269
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,390
It's the money which you can use during your time off work.

270
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:23,260
He remembers each of you by name.

271
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:28,450
Sounds like a threat.

272
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:31,530
What's with you?

273
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,810
You always act like a thug, but you're so docile at times like these.

274
00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:35,800
Because I'm not an idiot like you.

275
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,500
I admit that I am confused about what is going on.

276
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:42,510
But at least I realize that that the last thing Team Leader said in the interrogation room was for us to hear.

277
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:44,730
But you don't even know that.

278
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:47,140
When did you start listening to Team Leader so well?

279
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:50,800
I've never received a financial bonus before, so I don't know,

280
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:53,770
but the amount...

281
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:55,980
It's 10 million won. ($92,000)

282
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:09,240
The price of silence, huh?

283
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,670
Amazing.

284
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:18,900
 Towards Morality

285
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:23,400
Because a police officer is in prison, there are a lot of uncomfortable factors.

286
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:27,400
Staff Captain, some people you've  arrested will be her.

287
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:29,390
What a problem.

288
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:37,480
I would like it if that was the only problem.

289
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,160
Huh?

290
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:46,020
It's impossible to know what surgery was performed just by looking at this.

291
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:48,590
But seeing what vestiges I can see,

292
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:50,850
it involves brain lesions.

293
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:53,700
But it appears that it was successfully removed during surgery.

294
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,400
Continuous progress would have to be monitored.

295
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:58,500
Can I take a look?

296
00:27:03,410 --> 00:27:05,210
Brain lesions.

297
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:07,800
So there was a problem in my brain?

298
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,360
But it was eliminated by surgery?

299
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:15,890
Neither I felt any pain nor is there any sign of surgery. So is that possible?

300
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:18,750
If cutting-edge technology like 'cyberknife' was used

301
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:21,350
an incision would not have been necessary at the surgical site.

302
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:23,390
And it would be possible to return to daily life immediately afterward.

303
00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:26,400
Do you not feel any change?

304
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:35,830
 The memories that used to confuse me

305
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:38,470
 have definitely become more vivid.

306
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:43,710
Deputy Chief, will you really let Team Leader turned over to prosecutors?

307
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:46,880
We cannot just sit still, can we?

308
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:54,220
Deputy Chief.

309
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:08,290
 I was born in White Night Village.

310
00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:12,410
 And I am one of the children who was experimented on.

311
00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:16,300
 If you receive a proposition, it will be best to just accept it and not try to find out more.

312
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:19,670
 Because you just heard something you shouldn't hear.

313
00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:27,820
There is something more, for sure.

314
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,030
 I make them dream

315
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:43,460
 without even knowing that they are dreaming.

316
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:45,810
 They are led to believe that they can do whatever they want to,

317
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:48,090
 because it's happening in their dream.

318
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:50,360
 I clearly provided them with a choice.

319
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:52,490
 Because that was real and not a dream.

320
00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:56,320
 Curiosity killed the cat.

321
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:08,470
 Everyone is crazy.

322
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:10,810
 They are stabbing themselves and jumping from high places.

323
00:29:10,810 --> 00:29:12,620
 They all die smiling.

324
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:14,760
 What do I do?

325
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:18,070
 What is going on here?

326
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:21,230
 Because I made all of them that way.

327
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,000
"Because I

328
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:34,800
made all of them that way."

329
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,570
Congratulations, Doctor.

330
00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:56,600
You finally caught the culprit.

331
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:59,830
After you told me that you were from White Night Village,

332
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:01,350
I investigated.

333
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:03,830
There were seven children who survived.

334
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:06,900
But among them, none of them appeared to be me or you.

335
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:08,120
Get straight to the point.

336
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:10,460
Is there a reason I shouldn't?

337
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:12,640
Right, well, yes,

338
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,150
how is your head? You had headaches and you felt dizzy.

339
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:18,890
Is it better? And what about those bad dreams?

340
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:26,060
So it was you.

341
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:32,250
How did you know I had lesions in my brain?

342
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:34,910
And why did you made me undergo surgery?

343
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:38,460
Those symptoms disappeared so it's not important.

344
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:44,120
Let's go back to the White Night Village.

345
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:48,060
Me and you, we were both there, at that place.

346
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:50,670
But there is no record of us. So what happened?

347
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:55,100
I like this about you, Doctor. You never waver.

348
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:00,860
To be honest, that is also the scariest thing.

349
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:04,390
That I would cause people to be disturbed when they are the ones I want to least disturb.

350
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:07,300
What are you talking about right now?

351
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:08,600
I guess those records disappeared.

352
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:12,600
Record keeping system from 28 years ago would not be similar to what it is today.

353
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:17,600
So what exactly happened that day? Why did everyone die?

354
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:20,190
The records say that everyone committed suicide.

355
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:23,470
Although some of them appeared to have killed each other.

356
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:27,370
By any chance,

357
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,550
did I do that?

358
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:32,960
You, Doctor?

359
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:36,840
How could you?

360
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:39,090
I have no idea.

361
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:41,860
But in my dream,

362
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:43,960
and in one of the dreams which is becoming increasingly vivid,

363
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,070
in that dream,

364
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:49,790
I caused that to happen.

365
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,190
Doctor,

366
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:58,400
Doctor, you caught the criminal.

367
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:03,240
Game over.

368
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:07,690
Now you should return to the U.S. That is where your family is.

369
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:15,920
I don't feel like it's over.

370
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:27,700
So why are there no records of the two of us?

371
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:29,340
The memory that remains in me,

372
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:31,530
and what is that thing you won't tell me?

373
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:33,350
Why did you have me get surgery?

374
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:36,190
I wanted you to live.

375
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,830
You said that a monster rescued you.

376
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:53,820
I am that monster.

377
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:59,060
And that monster saved you again, so that's enough.

378
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:16,460
It's easy to pulverize someone's mental state.

379
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:18,220
I no longer have a mental state.

380
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:19,390
I don't have a mental state.

381
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:22,940
What is this? They even took my pastry?

382
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,600
Why would they take that? Why would they?

383
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:31,050
Isn't this a suppression of the freedom of the press?

384
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:32,960
What is the broadcast station doing about this?

385
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,710
This terrible situation, huh?

386
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:37,980
Right, they're about to fire me, huh?

387
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:40,350
What are you talking to yourself about?

388
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:43,430
Didn't I told you to clean up this place?

389
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:46,210
I'm about to sweep away my own life.

390
00:33:46,210 --> 00:33:49,050
But if you complain that I didn't sweep this place, I'm about to sweep you away, Hyeong.

391
00:33:49,050 --> 00:33:50,620
I can't stand to see you, either.

392
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:52,790
Be quiet, be quiet.

393
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:53,910
What is this?

394
00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:56,560
What is this? Omo, a monitor?

395
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,710
Computer?

396
00:33:57,710 --> 00:33:59,320
Computer? What is all this, Hyeong?

397
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:01,810
Be quiet, just set it up quickly.

398
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:04,210
Good.

399
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:06,620
Starting now, there is something you should work on.

400
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:08,510
Hyeong, this is such a nice keyboard.

401
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:12,320
Typing on it feels great. My fingers are drawn to it.

402
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,220
I think I can do a good job.

403
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:17,730
You can find out about how a survivor of White Night Village is doing, right?

404
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:20,190
White Night Village?

405
00:34:21,330 --> 00:34:24,560
Hyeong, wasn't your phone confiscated?

406
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:43,610
 Lieutenant Gong Hye Won

407
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:48,970
Hate me or love me,

408
00:34:48,970 --> 00:34:51,710
when you're desperate, you think of me, don't you?

409
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:57,250
You know about the White Night Village, don't you?

410
00:34:57,250 --> 00:34:58,480
Are you interrogating me right now?

411
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:01,870
Isn't that something the police should know?

412
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:04,390
Of course, you probably can't find much.

413
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:07,660
It must have been difficult for you to even distinguish those who died from those who are missing.

414
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:09,740
Why couldn't they be distinguished?

415
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:12,330
It's not as if forensic technology was like today.

416
00:35:12,330 --> 00:35:14,970
How could they know the limbs that were cut off belonged to which body?

417
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:19,200
You don't know, so you just called it 'mass suicide.'

418
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,520
- A few kids did survive— 
 - I know about that.

419
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,290
I know about that.

420
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:24,770
But do you know that almost all of them died later?

421
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:26,390
What?

422
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:29,450
So I've told you this much.

423
00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:30,950
I treated you well without getting anything in return, right?

424
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:32,770
So be very grateful to me, and goodbye.

425
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:35,000
Let us cooperate.

426
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:38,720
If you give me information about White Night Village

427
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,620
I'll give you the information you want.

428
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:41,550
Cooperate?

429
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:43,140
Cooperate? Maybe you watched too many movies?

430
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:45,050
Why would I cooperate with you?

431
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:48,140
That would only be if we both want the same thing.

432
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:50,250
Do you know why Team Leader sent you those forewarning notices?

433
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:51,650
Is that all he sent me?

434
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:53,150
He even sent me videos of the incident sites.

435
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:55,730
He used you, Reporter Lee Ji Wuk.

436
00:35:55,730 --> 00:35:59,730
He used you to manipulate public opinion so that he can get close to Son Min Ho.

437
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:01,560
 So let's hear what you want in exchange for the information.

438
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,560
 Exclusive scoop.

439
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:06,540
 I would love if everyone would just investigate and let us know the results, just like you do.

440
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:09,430
 Maybe you thought it would be a better scoop if he just died?

441
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:11,000
 What?

442
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:12,950
 I'm sure that isn't true.

443
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:16,340
 I've decided to serialize my story to clear up any misunderstandings.

444
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,820
 Like those serials in the newspapers in the past.

445
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:21,660
 You are good at diverting the attention of the people by drawing out someone's wrongdoing,

446
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:27,360
 and instigating people by stimulating them. But I feel like there is something else that

447
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,200
 you are also good at.

448
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,560
So now I know. Thanks.

449
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,760
Don't drop your honorifics when speaking to me.

450
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:37,870
Prosecutors have suddenly gotten involved in this case.

451
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,300
Prosecutors have gotten involved?

452
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,530
Team Leader spoke about the White Night Village.

453
00:36:44,530 --> 00:36:47,220
Then the prosecutors suddenly barged in. Isn't it strange?

454
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:48,290
Isn't it strange?

455
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:53,060
No matter how smart you are, can you find out things faster than me even if I am at the scene?

456
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:56,590
There is definitely something more to this case.

457
00:36:57,350 --> 00:37:03,270
Mongolians can have vision up to 13.0.

458
00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:06,470
On average, it's from 3.0 to 4.0.

459
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:11,390
This difference can make a big difference.

460
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:14,470
Someone who can see 10 meters ahead of them

461
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:19,190
and someone who can see 100 meters ahead of them, what they can see will be very different.

462
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:24,530
Go outside.

463
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:26,550
Yes, sir.

464
00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:44,690
He believes that the Foundation will rescue him without a doubt.

465
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:46,520
He will be loyal to his master.

466
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:50,100
He's from White Night Village, so you should be careful.

467
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:53,800
This. You're the one who can fix this.

468
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:58,060
Also, he'll be okay as long as he thinks it's the Foundation.

469
00:37:58,060 --> 00:37:59,720
Anyway...

470
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:03,120
So, what are you trying to tell me?

471
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,700
So he's at a higher level of development.

472
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:06,660
How great is that difference?

473
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:09,160
It's above being great.

474
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:13,160
Anything that was made in the lab of White Night Village.

475
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:33,400
 You said that a monster rescued you.

476
00:38:34,370 --> 00:38:37,360
 I am that monster.

477
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:40,990
 And this time, too, that monster saved you, so that's good enough.

478
00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:43,560
 The monster is him?

479
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:46,320
 And it's good enough since he saved me again this time?

480
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,860
 What does he mean?

481
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:53,800
Is he saying that the monster that saved me on that awful day is him?

482
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,590
It's been a long time.

483
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:06,000
Are you going to the convenience store? To eat ramyeon?

484
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,160
I'm sorry.

485
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:09,460
I won't go near you.

486
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:13,340
I'm just so happy to see you.

487
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:23,580
You were there when the fire broke, right?

488
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:27,370
How do you know about that?

489
00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:30,400
Oh right, I was on TV.

490
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,080
That isn't all that's happened.

491
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:36,000
I was abducted and returned.

492
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:39,570
Aren't you curious about that?

493
00:39:39,570 --> 00:39:46,080
 Their body and mentality are definitely different than ordinary people.

494
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:51,470
 The way they speak, the way they express emotions, their thought methods,

495
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:53,450
 the way they solve problems,

496
00:39:53,450 --> 00:39:55,270
 all of that—

497
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:58,200
I regained consciousness only after the surgery was complete.

498
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,330
But there is no wound on my head at all.

499
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:02,640
I did feel dizzy and nauseous

500
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:05,680
but considering I just received brain surgery, I felt really great.

501
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,460
I needed to know where I was

502
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:10,170
but there wasn't even a hospital logo or name...

503
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:18,460
Sorry, I only talked about myself so suddenly,

504
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:20,220
didn't I?

505
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:23,370
But it's true.

506
00:40:23,370 --> 00:40:26,470
Look at this. And here, too.

507
00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:31,000
It's possible that there could be some mark left on my head.

508
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,160
Could you look at my head for me?

509
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,220
Right here, it felt a little strange.

510
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:35,700
Can you look there for me? Is there something there?

511
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:36,920
Is there something there?

512
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:42,590
Maybe your body was experimented on by aliens?

513
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:47,680
Space is so enormous.

514
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:51,630
Would there only be life on this small planet, earth?

515
00:40:52,890 --> 00:40:54,870
That could be true.

516
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:59,800
I know who abducted me and made me get the surgery.

517
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:06,690
I don't know much else about him, but he is definitely a human being.

518
00:41:06,690 --> 00:41:09,450
So you know who did this to you?

519
00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:10,390
I do.

520
00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:12,040
Why...

521
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:17,260
maybe because you were sick...

522
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:19,700
and that's why he made you undergo surgery?

523
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:23,920
I think that's the case, although I am not aware.

524
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:28,330
Then isn't he a good person?

525
00:41:28,330 --> 00:41:29,700
About that...

526
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:32,520
it doesn't make sense.

527
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:34,890
He killed at least five people.

528
00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:38,290
But he saved my life?

529
00:41:38,290 --> 00:41:41,460
It would be best if he explained why he did that.

530
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:42,980
But I don't think he ever would.

531
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:45,690
If I at least find which hospital I received surgery at

532
00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:47,400
then I might find something out.

533
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,150
I can

534
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:54,930
help you with that, I think.

535
00:41:54,930 --> 00:41:57,120
You will help me?

536
00:41:58,870 --> 00:42:00,830
Excuse me...

537
00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:06,070
I will bring my computer.

538
00:42:06,070 --> 00:42:09,780
I think I can at least find out which hospital you received surgery at.

539
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:22,930
I am not sure I can say that this is human. 
  White Night BioTech

540
00:42:22,930 --> 00:42:24,300
A new kind of human?

541
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:26,870
Maybe a new species?

542
00:42:26,870 --> 00:42:31,430
I think we need to call this something else that isn't human.

543
00:42:31,430 --> 00:42:36,960
Because we can't know what they see and what they feel and how they make decisions.

544
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:01,460
The laws of physics

545
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:05,470
probably don't have meaning for those children.

546
00:43:06,970 --> 00:43:10,820
Their bodies and brain are at a different level,

547
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:14,700
so something like the difference in strength can be ignored.

548
00:43:26,250 --> 00:43:28,150
Humans are actually weak.

549
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:30,540
So when facing what they do not understand,

550
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:34,500
they feel fear or a sense of awe.

551
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:41,420
At some point in time, those beings were called gods.

552
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:43,560
What a tremendous story, to think of them as gods.

553
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:45,250
Is there much to the gods?

554
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:47,900
Those many people who were called geniuses

555
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:50,430
often ended up living a below-average standard of life as they matured.

556
00:43:50,430 --> 00:43:52,790
It's not that they are geniuses.

557
00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:54,990
They are more like mutants.

558
00:43:54,990 --> 00:43:57,260
The dormant abilities of humans

559
00:43:57,260 --> 00:44:00,880
have been developed to their limits in them. They are a new kind of being.

560
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:37,070
 So they seem like miracles to us.

561
00:44:41,070 --> 00:44:42,600
I'm not interested in miracles.

562
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:46,790
If what you want is a miracle, then you should be interested in miracles.

563
00:44:48,490 --> 00:44:51,560
You must somehow get that police officer under your control.

564
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:54,860
If that police officer is that child from that time,

565
00:45:14,990 --> 00:45:17,660
Then he will have the solution to

566
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:21,060
what our Foundation has desperately wanted for so long,

567
00:45:29,210 --> 00:45:32,420
The address where you were found.

568
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,580
Your height is 166 cm and your weight is 51 kg.

569
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:43,530
The height is correct, but the weight is incorrect.

570
00:45:43,530 --> 00:45:46,620
- I'm a bit on the muscular side. 54 kg. 
 - No.

571
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:48,350
No.

572
00:45:48,450 --> 00:45:50,500
- This is correct.
 - No.

573
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:52,810
It's my body weight, who are you to say it's incorrect?

574
00:45:52,810 --> 00:45:55,830
- 54 kg is correct.
 - No.

575
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:07,700
What?

576
00:46:08,230 --> 00:46:10,150
What in the world?

577
00:46:16,710 --> 00:46:17,720
It's alright.

578
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:22,420
Girls can't perceive their weight objectively.

579
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:24,810
So how did you know?

580
00:46:24,810 --> 00:46:29,340
You have a good amount of muscles and you probably run well

581
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:33,330
but the anesthesia probably hasn't fully worn off.

582
00:46:33,330 --> 00:46:35,280
The time you were discovered on the road,

583
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:37,940
do you know when that was?

584
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:06,890
9:44 p.m.

585
00:47:06,890 --> 00:47:08,580
Where did you begin to ride on the dump truck?

586
00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:11,270
I don't know where, but

587
00:47:12,990 --> 00:47:14,670
 Seoul

588
00:47:14,670 --> 00:47:16,850
it was headed to Seoul.

589
00:47:16,850 --> 00:47:18,570
So then, you arrived at

590
00:47:18,570 --> 00:47:20,850
the Samyuk Police Station near Cheongdo?

591
00:47:20,850 --> 00:47:22,870
That's correct.

592
00:47:22,870 --> 00:47:25,130
Using that location as the center,

593
00:47:25,130 --> 00:47:28,230
and calculating the ability of your body to move,

594
00:47:28,230 --> 00:47:30,220
and if we widen the area,

595
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:36,090
and then looking for hospitals which may have MRI or 'cyberknife' equipment...

596
00:47:36,090 --> 00:47:38,320
hospitals of that size...

597
00:47:44,850 --> 00:47:48,460
You said that you are a police officer?

598
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:49,730
Why? Have you committed a crime?

599
00:47:49,730 --> 00:47:51,610
No.

600
00:47:54,290 --> 00:47:56,800
How rude of you to say that.

601
00:47:58,290 --> 00:48:02,060
Well, the children who survived the disaster,

602
00:48:02,060 --> 00:48:03,460
I think they're all insane.

603
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:05,120
Why do you say that?

604
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:08,380
Two cases of hit-and-run traffic accidents.

605
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:10,300
One guy who jumped off a building.

606
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:12,120
One child jumped into a lake.

607
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:13,660
One guy took drugs.

608
00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:18,210
And the final one died by cutting his own throat in a mental hospital.

609
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:24,770
He suffered from the paranoia of being chased.

610
00:48:24,770 --> 00:48:27,460
He suffered severe headaches due to unknown causes.

611
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:30,070
Brain tumor, malformation of veins in the brain.

612
00:48:30,070 --> 00:48:31,680
Meningitis.

613
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:33,250
Cerebral aneurysm.

614
00:48:33,250 --> 00:48:35,400
They were all suffering from brain diseases

615
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:36,670
that were unrelated to their causes of death.

616
00:48:36,670 --> 00:48:39,020
So six of them died.

617
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:41,240
Now look at this.

618
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:44,300
A male child is missing.

619
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:49,400
- He was 14 years old at that time. 
 - 14 years?  No way.

620
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:50,620
Why can't that be true?

621
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:54,180
That means if he's alive, he would be 42 years old now.

622
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:56,460
 I was born in White Night Village.

623
00:48:56,500 --> 00:49:00,800
Team Leader is 36 years old. So that can't be him.

624
00:49:02,590 --> 00:49:04,870
You're home?

625
00:49:04,870 --> 00:49:07,020
Yes, where is Hye Won?

626
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:11,290
You came home at a normal hour, and you even sound like a father.

627
00:49:11,290 --> 00:49:12,420
I don't know.

628
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:13,770
I don't think her work is going well.

629
00:49:13,770 --> 00:49:17,380
If she's coming home too late, you should check up on her.

630
00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:19,590
Suddenly?

631
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:25,150
 Scientific Names

632
00:49:25,150 --> 00:49:27,200
Did someone touch this book?

633
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:28,870
I wouldn't know.

634
00:49:28,870 --> 00:49:31,770
I wouldn't know. Hye Won sometimes reads your books.

635
00:49:39,690 --> 00:49:43,710
 White Night BioTech Founding 20th Anniversary Celebration

636
00:50:09,170 --> 00:50:13,020
If the criminal is caught, then it's over, right?

637
00:50:13,770 --> 00:50:16,460
Well, officially, yes.

638
00:50:16,460 --> 00:50:20,460
But there are still so many unanswered questions.

639
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:25,010
Do you think dreams are meaningful?

640
00:50:25,010 --> 00:50:28,620
What if it's a dream that keeps repeating itself?

641
00:50:28,620 --> 00:50:31,910
You spend 1/3 of your life sleeping.

642
00:50:31,910 --> 00:50:36,220
So if you keep dreaming the same dream, wouldn't it be meaningful?

643
00:50:36,220 --> 00:50:41,720
Then what if I say that someone caused someone else to dream.

644
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:43,930
And those people, in their dream,

645
00:50:43,930 --> 00:50:45,920
committed as many crimes as they wanted because it was a dream.

646
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:48,330
But suddenly, that dream became reality

647
00:50:48,330 --> 00:50:51,690
and what if they ended up dying because of their actions that they thought they did in dreams?

648
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:57,300
Then could we say the person who caused them to dream those dreams was the killer?

649
00:50:57,300 --> 00:50:59,400
Causing them to dream 'lucid dreams'

650
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:03,770
and suddenly made them confuse the dream with reality?

651
00:51:03,770 --> 00:51:06,550
You know about 'lucid dreams?'

652
00:51:06,550 --> 00:51:12,130
It's when you dream, you know that you are dreaming.

653
00:51:12,130 --> 00:51:14,840
I know how to dream such dreams.

654
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:18,430
You know how to dream a 'lucid dream?'

655
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:22,350
How do I know that?

656
00:51:22,350 --> 00:51:25,760
I think that I just know, somehow.

657
00:51:26,590 --> 00:51:27,730
 I make them dream

658
00:51:27,730 --> 00:51:30,170
 without even knowing that they are dreaming.

659
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:31,590
 Because it's happening in their dream,

660
00:51:31,590 --> 00:51:35,200
 they are led to believe that they can do whatever they want to.

661
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:38,410
 Because that was real and not a dream.

662
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:57,690
What is so important for us to talk about?

663
00:51:57,690 --> 00:52:01,860
You should know that even I was in the midst of a very important conversation.

664
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:04,990
I should have gotten his contact information. Ah, really.

665
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:08,800
Looks like you were having a date, at a time like this?

666
00:52:08,820 --> 00:52:12,460
No, it's not easy to meet this guy.

667
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:15,920
- And he seems to be in a bit of danger.
 - You like him.

668
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:16,900
What are you saying?

669
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:19,360
That's what you said before, Doctor.

670
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:23,300
- Team Leader seems to be in a bit of danger— 
 - You like him.

671
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:32,190
So, what is it that you have to tell me?

672
00:52:35,090 --> 00:52:38,310
Team Leader said he was from White Night Village.

673
00:52:38,310 --> 00:52:39,330
Yes, that's correct.

674
00:52:39,330 --> 00:52:42,340
I investigated the survivors of White Night Village.

675
00:52:42,340 --> 00:52:44,040
But they all died except for one boy.

676
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:45,650
Except for one boy.

677
00:52:45,650 --> 00:52:47,630
If he's alive, then he would be 42 years old.

678
00:52:47,630 --> 00:52:49,090
But Team Leader is 36 years old.

679
00:52:49,090 --> 00:52:51,620
There will be a survivor who was omitted from the records.

680
00:52:51,620 --> 00:52:53,050
So that is meaningless.

681
00:52:53,050 --> 00:52:55,990
He said himself that he was a survivor of White Night Village.

682
00:52:55,990 --> 00:52:57,320
And the time doesn't fit, either.

683
00:52:57,320 --> 00:52:59,170
Let's say that he is guilty in the Son Min Ho case.

684
00:52:59,170 --> 00:53:02,460
But he was always with us when the other incidents happened.

685
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:05,650
Kim Yeong Jun, June 27th. Park Gyu Tae, June 30th.

686
00:53:05,650 --> 00:53:07,030
You don't want to believe it, do you?

687
00:53:07,030 --> 00:53:10,110
So even after you saw it with your eyes and heard it with your ears

688
00:53:10,110 --> 00:53:12,030
you keep looking for reasons for it to not be true.

689
00:53:12,030 --> 00:53:17,260
Staff Captain Do is not the person you thought you knew.

690
00:53:30,690 --> 00:53:33,190
Even I don't know him well.

691
00:53:34,010 --> 00:53:38,080
And perhaps he may not know himself.

692
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:53,800
Do Jeong Wu, what is your true identity?

693
00:53:58,130 --> 00:54:01,200
But realistically, he had no time at all to plan something like this.

694
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:04,510
Before you joined us, we were trying to catch that bank robber.

695
00:54:04,510 --> 00:54:06,380
So we practically spent 24 hours together for nine months.

696
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:08,420
That created time for him.

697
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:10,960
He is capable of doing that.

698
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:13,140
Do you want to drink something?

699
00:54:15,370 --> 00:54:17,920
Staff Captain said it was a 'lucid dream.'

700
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:18,740
What is that?

701
00:54:18,740 --> 00:54:22,930
He makes the victims believe that they are dreaming

702
00:54:22,930 --> 00:54:25,490
and makes them create their own deaths.

703
00:54:25,490 --> 00:54:30,390
So Staff Captain Do does not need to be there.

704
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:37,720
To be honest, I don't understand it well.

705
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:41,430
One thing that is certain is that he did not directly kill them.

706
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:45,600
He created a mechanism. So that he won't have to do it himself.

707
00:54:45,630 --> 00:54:49,570
Yes, that is very much like him.

708
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:54,390
Doctor, why do you act like you know Team Leader, when you don't?

709
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:55,400
Huh?

710
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:58,430
Did I do that?

711
00:54:58,430 --> 00:55:00,130
You've bothered me from the start.

712
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:03,400
You don't know anything about him, but you say, "Yes, he is capable of doing that. That is like him."

713
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:07,300
How long have you known Team Leader? I've known him for longer.

714
00:55:07,330 --> 00:55:10,570
He may be a mess, but he would not kill someone.

715
00:55:10,570 --> 00:55:12,500
But you saw it for yourself at the scene.

716
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:14,260
And you heard it directly from Staff Captain Do himself.

717
00:55:14,260 --> 00:55:15,600
But you still can't believe it?

718
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:18,620
I'm not denying everything.

719
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:20,760
I just feel like the forewarned murders are not all there is.

720
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:22,100
I feel like there is something more.

721
00:55:22,130 --> 00:55:25,790
There are so many things that don't make sense. Why are you ignoring them all?

722
00:55:26,630 --> 00:55:28,380
 To be honest, that is also the scariest thing.

723
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:32,270
 That I would cause people to be disturbed, when they are the ones I want to least disturb.

724
00:55:34,350 --> 00:55:36,570
Maybe this is what he meant?

725
00:55:39,380 --> 00:55:42,840
Let's stop now. I understand.

726
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:15,690
Get in.

727
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:44,980
 You must somehow get that police officer under your control.

728
00:56:44,980 --> 00:56:47,100
 If that police officer is that child from that time,

729
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:50,300
 then he will have the solution to what

730
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:53,940
  our Foundation has desperately wanted for so long,.

731
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:12,770
What is he doing?

732
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:19,020
Bring the police.

733
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:20,620
Yes.

734
00:57:24,950 --> 00:57:27,530
It happens frequently when police officers are imprisoned.

735
00:57:27,530 --> 00:57:30,130
A police officer was attacked in the detention center.

736
00:57:30,130 --> 00:57:31,440
By four guys!

737
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:33,440
Wasn't that with an intention to kill?

738
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:35,590
How dare they mess with a police officer?

739
00:57:35,590 --> 00:57:37,410
Darn criminals.

740
00:57:37,410 --> 00:57:38,970
He didn't die.

741
00:57:38,970 --> 00:57:41,700
He is a criminal, so we can't give him special treatment because he is a police officer.

742
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:45,700
That he was isolated in his own cell is more than enough consideration.

743
00:57:46,590 --> 00:57:51,480
 The serial killer that shook Korea has been revealed to be a police officer.

744
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:56,060
 And it is no one but Staff Captain Do Jeong Wu who was hailed as a hero.

745
00:57:56,060 --> 00:57:59,330
 Such a tremendous police officer turned out to be a tremendous criminal as well.

746
00:57:59,330 --> 00:58:02,140
 We have an exclusive video of the crime site.

747
00:58:02,140 --> 00:58:04,460
 I want to clarify that this video is not a reenactment—

748
00:58:04,460 --> 00:58:05,420
Oh, that bastard.

749
00:58:05,420 --> 00:58:08,950
Didn't we confiscate his phone that he took that video with?

750
00:58:11,750 --> 00:58:13,620
Let's forget about the Do Jeong Wu case now.

751
00:58:13,620 --> 00:58:15,400
It's been turned over to the prosecutors already.

752
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:18,150
Once he's taken to the investigation room, he won't be out for several days.

753
00:58:18,150 --> 00:58:20,820
That is all the more reason—

754
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:24,180
Look here.

755
00:58:24,180 --> 00:58:27,440
How can we know what will happen at the prosecutors' office, where we have no influence?

756
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:30,310
Do you want to be accused of protecting a criminal because he is a police officer?

757
00:58:30,310 --> 00:58:32,580
It's not as if people are not already saying that.

758
00:58:32,580 --> 00:58:34,700
But at least we can avoid some damage.

759
00:58:34,700 --> 00:58:37,250
If we're lucky, the attention will be focused on the prosecutors.

760
00:58:37,250 --> 00:58:39,770
And Do Jeong Wu will become a serial killer, not a police officer.

761
00:58:39,770 --> 00:58:42,760
Someone who killed five people for his own vengeance,

762
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:45,300
a violent criminal and that will be the end of that.

763
00:59:00,570 --> 00:59:02,790
It's been a long time.

764
00:59:07,700 --> 00:59:13,300
Did you send someone to the detention center to kill Do Jeong Wu, Mr. Son?

765
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:19,000
I thought you were someone who understood that the Foundation does not appreciate such independent action.

766
00:59:36,340 --> 00:59:38,990
We already know that he is one of those children.

767
00:59:38,990 --> 00:59:43,280
Dr. Gong said that is why he is valuable.

768
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:45,070
That...

769
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:48,840
That isn't it.

770
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:51,580
He knows that the Foundation still exists and operates.

771
00:59:51,580 --> 00:59:55,330
He also knows that the experiments are continuing.

772
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:04,400
So who told him that?

773
01:00:04,430 --> 01:00:07,190
It was you, wasn't it, Mr. Son?

774
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:10,530
What else did you tell him?

775
01:00:10,530 --> 01:00:14,030
I'm sure you told him my name.

776
01:00:14,030 --> 01:00:16,500
Did you also tell him about His Excellency?

777
01:00:25,730 --> 01:00:27,830
 Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office

778
01:00:27,830 --> 01:00:29,850
 This is going to be an exclusive.

779
01:00:46,220 --> 01:00:48,700
What are you doing?

780
01:00:48,700 --> 01:00:50,790
What about you, what are you doing here?

781
01:00:52,870 --> 01:00:54,990
The van is coming.

782
01:01:06,330 --> 01:01:08,070
Do you feel that you have realized justice?

783
01:01:08,070 --> 01:01:09,800
That people who deserved to die did?

784
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:12,660
You are now a criminal, can you tell us about that?

785
01:01:12,660 --> 01:01:14,480
Did you really kill those victims?

786
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:15,480
Didn't they commit suicide?

787
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:17,730
How did you do it? Please tell us.

788
01:01:17,730 --> 01:01:18,700
Why did you do it?

789
01:01:18,700 --> 01:01:22,750
Your motive wasn't revealed yet, can you tell us now?

790
01:01:34,590 --> 01:01:37,570
If you're going to tell us about the news, you can go, we already know.

791
01:01:37,570 --> 01:01:40,500
Staff Captain Do Jeong Wu submitted a document.

792
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:42,220
What?

793
01:02:28,830 --> 01:02:29,840
Excuse me.

794
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:30,770
Team Leader?

795
01:02:30,770 --> 01:02:32,900
I'm a police officer.

796
01:02:35,350 --> 01:02:38,950
Call 119. Hurry!

797
01:02:40,570 --> 01:02:41,620
He is terminally ill.

798
01:02:41,620 --> 01:02:44,890
Cerebral artery dissection can affect him at any time

799
01:02:44,890 --> 01:02:49,870
and once it begins, there is no treatment and even emergency surgery would be

800
01:02:49,870 --> 01:02:52,190
impossible, it says.

801
01:02:55,050 --> 01:02:58,490
 Do you take that without water? What kind of medication is that, anyway?

802
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:02,470
He's requesting suspension of confinement.

803
01:03:03,810 --> 01:03:07,420
Why? Isn't this just like him?

804
01:03:07,420 --> 01:03:09,990
I guess he'll be going to the hospital now.

805
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:34,990
Move him here, please.

806
01:03:35,990 --> 01:03:38,050
- I will begin with vital checks.
 - Yes, I understand.

807
01:03:38,050 --> 01:03:39,780
Please bring the equipment quickly.

808
01:03:49,100 --> 01:03:50,500
What will happen to Team Leader?

809
01:03:50,590 --> 01:03:52,990
Come on Gong, say something, Gong!

810
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:35,760
 White Night Foundation

811
01:05:52,260 --> 01:05:56,470
 I enjoyed riddles since I was young.

812
01:05:56,500 --> 01:06:01,700
 But now merely solving the puzzle isn't enough to satisfy me.

813
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:07,400
 Because nothing is finished yet.

814
01:06:26,350 --> 01:06:33,330

815
01:06:35,170 --> 01:06:38,160
 Awaken

816
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:39,630
 Are you really going to die?

817
01:06:39,630 --> 01:06:41,950
 I guess I'm someone who shouldn't live.

818
01:06:41,950 --> 01:06:43,360
 Find it, no matter what.

819
01:06:43,360 --> 01:06:45,430
 Everyone at the station, mobilize now!

820
01:06:45,430 --> 01:06:47,490
 How many people did you receive from the Foundation?

821
01:06:47,490 --> 01:06:49,430
 They are everywhere, and not anywhere.

822
01:06:49,430 --> 01:06:51,430
 So someone came to kill Team Leader?

823
01:06:51,430 --> 01:06:54,420
 Why couldn't he cure his own disease and chose to live the life of a terminally ill patient?

824
01:06:54,420 --> 01:06:57,600
 Do you really want to know who you are?

825
01:06:57,600 --> 01:07:02,650
 I will tell you the whole truth of what happened at White Night Village 28 years ago.

826
01:07:02,650 --> 01:07:05,750
 What? It's not over yet.
