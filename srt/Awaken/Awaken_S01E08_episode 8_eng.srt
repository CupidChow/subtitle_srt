1
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:09,020

2
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:37,920
 Awaken

3
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:50,120
 Episode 8

4
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:09,920
- What do you think? Can you solve it? 
 - Yeah.

5
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:16,890
- This is correct, isn't it? 
 - Yeah.

6
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,710
Hyung, I want to do it too!

7
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:37,350
Okay, write it here.

8
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:39,850
- Here? 
 - Yeah!

9
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:43,930
Can't you even get the pass?

10
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:46,080
Stay out if you're going to do it that way.

11
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,850
I'm sorry... I just...

12
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:50,520
I was just...

13
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,980
I think he made a mistake while trying to make a goal.

14
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:59,190
- Aren't you being too much? 
 - Stay out of it.

15
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:01,150
This little—

16
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:08,630
The test results show rapid intelligence development among a few of the children.

17
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:11,850
According to the standardized IQ test, seven children have an average IQ of 180,

18
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:14,380
four are around 240,

19
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:16,770
and among them, the one with the highest score is...

20
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:20,200
The goal of our research isn't intelligence improvement.

21
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,120
It's to make them unafraid of death.

22
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,530
Those are just...

23
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:27,260
side effects.

24
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:30,180
That's not true when looking at the abnormalities in cell growth.

25
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:33,140
The development of intelligence is due to the proliferation of abnormal brain cells,

26
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:37,020
and if we can multiply the telomere (compound structure at the end of a chromosome) across the entire body,

27
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:41,290
we can perhaps overcome aging and even death.

28
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:48,970
What's wrong with this kid?!

29
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:53,660
Hey, are you okay?

30
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:59,500
Can you unbutton his shirt for me?

31
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:02,800
No, don't.

32
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,390
No, no, he's breathing. We have to raise his head.

33
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:09,500
- But he's in shock. 
 - His brain pressure is increasing.

34
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,490
Get the doctor.

35
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,210
Is he okay?

36
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:22,720
It is causing abnormal cell proliferation throughout the body.

37
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:32,260
It would be good if we can control that speed, right?

38
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:36,680
If we're not careful, wouldn't the body be unable to withstand the pressure and explode?

39
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,140
Like how the brain explodes?

40
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,800
 Cultivation Laboratory
 No Trespassing, Authorized Personnel Only

41
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:01,280
 Expired

42
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:22,780
Failed again...

43
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:09,270
If you drink milk, you'll be able to sleep well.

44
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:14,320
Tryptophan induces serotonin and melatonin secretion.

45
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:31,100
- You couldn't sleep, huh?
 - Yes.

46
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:34,770
This worked out well. There's something I wanted to ask you.

47
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:37,210
Earlier, you did really well.

48
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:40,640
Were you close with that kid?

49
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:43,270
I see.

50
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:47,070
Who taught you first aid?

51
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:49,300
Nobody taught me anything.

52
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:52,910
But when #179 fell earlier,

53
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:56,180
how did you take action as if you knew what to do?

54
00:08:57,830 --> 00:08:59,880
Was it a coincidence?

55
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:04,410
Well, it was a little bit strange.

56
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:08,670
When a person falls, the legs are usually raised to prevent shock.

57
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:11,310
 - Don't do that! 
 - But you didn't allow him to do it.

58
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:13,950
Why did you do that?

59
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:17,170
And you didn't try to stop his nosebleed.

60
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:25,160
As if you knew it was intracranial pressure.

61
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:38,900
You're really special, yeah?

62
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,430
You know that, too, don't you?

63
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:50,790
That you're the most special among the kids?

64
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:55,550
That's right...

65
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:57,850
Of course, you should be.

66
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:01,380
My son.

67
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:29,890
- Oppa, where were you? 
 - In the bathroom.

68
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:34,030
Why did it take so long? Were you pooping?

69
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:36,480
Sorry, I had a stomach ache.

70
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,460
Were you scared?

71
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:40,890
Let's go back to sleep.

72
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:51,600
♬ Sleep, sleep, go to sleep

73
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:57,950
- Don't be scared. 
 - I'm not scared.

74
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:08,160
I will... protect you.

75
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,380
 Awaken

76
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:43,170
You're awake now?

77
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:46,500
Do you know how much trouble I had because I couldn't control the hemorrhaging areas?

78
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:50,030
You're so annoying and troublesome!

79
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:53,250
Stay lying down.

80
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:28,110
- Hyung. 
 - Drink this.

81
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:33,850
But... drinking this makes me feel nauseous.

82
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:38,090
Okay.

83
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:54,230
 I seem to know how to make someone dream a lucid dream.

84
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:05,780
 Oh really. What are you trying to find?!

85
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:07,760
Reporter, you can't do this!

86
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,410
What's going on?

87
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:12,510
Please stop Reporter Lee. How can I do my job if he does this?

88
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:15,530
Hyung, what are you doing? What do you think is stored here?

89
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:17,550
It's here! I'm certain!

90
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:20,200
What is here?

91
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,530
What the hell is going on?

92
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:31,390
He's the director of Seoul Hangang Hospital.

93
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:42,060
Huh? What just happened?

94
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:45,400
He stabbed his own stomach...

95
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,870
Isn't this a fake video?

96
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:49,930
But Do Jeong Wu was arrested at the time.

97
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:53,050
It's not possible for him to be the culprit looking at the time of the incident

98
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:55,940
From the start, it's not the type of a crime where the culprit carries it out at the scene.

99
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:58,520
It's not important whether Do Jeong Wu is in custody or not.

100
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,930
The video could have been sent through anyone.

101
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:01,590
Then?

102
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:04,500
There was no forewarning.

103
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,880
Why is that an issue?

104
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,680
With Kim Yeong Joon, let's say that's the case since it was the first killing.

105
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:12,110
But for the rest of them, that punk sent the forewarning notices to me.

106
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:15,400
As if he wanted his crime to go public.

107
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,650
Then whenever there was a victim, he even sent me the videos of the final moment.

108
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:22,130
A forewarning and a video of the final moment. This pattern was broken.

109
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:25,870
And of all times, right after Do Jeong Wu was arrested.

110
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:30,110
What could be the reason?

111
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:54,010
Why did you call me?

112
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:56,880
I have something to tell you.

113
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,590
Tell me.

114
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:08,280
Well... J- Jae Wung was talking about the lucid dream.

115
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,290
That he knows how to make someone dream the lucid dream.

116
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:14,550
Why is that punk interested in lucid dreams when he does not have any interest about anyone in this world?

117
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:17,560
I think... he made a friend.

118
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:20,640
- Friend? Who? 
 - I don't know either.

119
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:23,910
Just keep Jae Wung doing what you tell him to.

120
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:27,040
If he starts knowing about things like the lucid dreams, it'll become cumbersome.

121
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,690
- Make sure he doesn't know anything. 
 - Okay.

122
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:34,800
His friend... get rid of him.

123
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,820
Then... Jae Wung will act out.

124
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,890
I need to give him an explanation or something.

125
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:51,570
Explain what?

126
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:56,160
You can just beat him up so much that he'll forget he had a friend.

127
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:04,850
In the end, you live alone in this world.

128
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:06,330
Okay.

129
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:09,580
Make him forget he had a friend once.

130
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:11,050
Okay.

131
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:14,000
 Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency

132
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,710
So you were trying to catch Do Jeong Wu

133
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:19,530
but the Cyber Investigation Team's Kang Yoon Seong tried to kill him, and you lost him?

134
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:21,120
Yes, sir.

135
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:26,180
Currently, we can't confirm Kang Yoon Seong's whereabouts.

136
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:29,650
Basically, you're saying you don't know where Do Jeong Wu went.

137
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:39,760
Tighten security on Mr. Son's room.

138
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:42,060
You know that the higher-ups are keeping a close eye, right?!

139
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:45,890
If he comes back and we lose him again, you and I are both dead!

140
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:47,440
Yes, sir.

141
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,980
I'm dissolving the Special Team, so go home and be on standby.

142
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,120
Deputy Chief!

143
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:02,460
There were people who tried to kill Team Leader at the hospital.

144
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:05,030
Do Jeong Wu is the murderer! Who is killing whom?!

145
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:08,020
But someone tried to hurt him at the detention center, too!

146
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:11,660
Even in the hospital and the police agency, someone is after him!

147
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:14,190
I don't know who is doing it or why,

148
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:18,070
but I am certain that Team Leader is in danger.

149
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:19,300
Be quiet.

150
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,390
Deputy Chief.

151
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:23,170
Leave.

152
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:47,780
Empty out the other wards on Mr. Son's floor and tighten security.

153
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:50,890
Who cares about the hospital rules right now?!

154
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:06,250
- Then clean me up, too! Take me, too! 
 - Nothing has been confirmed yet.

155
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:09,100
That's why! We don't know the details, either!

156
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:11,430
We were ordered to clean up the Special Team's office, that is all.

157
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:14,360
No, you can't leave with even a speck of dust from here.

158
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:17,550
- Put that down, sir!
 - Put everything in the boxes.

159
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:19,550
You can't leave. No one can leave.

160
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:22,060
Stop whatever you're doing right now.

161
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:24,300
Oh, Professor Jamie!

162
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:26,290
Loyalty!

163
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:29,690
What are you doing, guys?

164
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:31,980
Who... are you?

165
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:32,860
You don't know?

166
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:37,220
You don't know Doctor Jamie from the FBI who came from the US to help our investigation?

167
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:39,330
FBI?

168
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:42,930
How dare they do that to our team?

169
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:47,260
Doctor, is there anything we can do to help?

170
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,680
Which side is it?

171
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:52,040
The police? Or Staff Captain Do?

172
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,470
Isn't it obviously Team Leader?

173
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:57,160
So frustrating.

174
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,320
Staff Captain Do is the culprit.

175
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:02,230
You all saw him stab Son Min Ho in the neck yourself.

176
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:04,900
So we should be thinking about ways to capture him.

177
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,340
Why are you thinking about how to help him?

178
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:08,280
I'm sure there was a reason for his action.

179
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:11,570
Even if there's a reason, are we allowed to stab someone in the neck?

180
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:12,960
And kill them, too?

181
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,350
Let's only believe our eyes, alright?

182
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:18,340
I'm sure it's not what he means.

183
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:21,750
But it's Team Leader! We know him.

184
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:26,030
We know that he's not a bad person, that he's not just a murderer!

185
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:30,460
I'm sure there was a reason he couldn't tell us about.

186
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,690
 Gopboonyi Tripe

187
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:58,810
 Enjoy it.

188
00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:01,360
 - Let me pour you a drink. 
 - Sure.

189
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:05,460
 So cool. I love cheese!

190
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:06,670
 Do you know how to eat this sort of thing, Lieutenant Gong?

191
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:08,180
  There's nothing I can't eat.

192
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:11,390
 Since the drink snacks are out, let's toast.

193
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:12,950
 Team Leader, please say a word.

194
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:14,780
 Well...

195
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:18,310
 welcome to the Special Team. Let's do a great job!

196
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:19,550
 Cheers!

197
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:21,920
 Let me say something, too.

198
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,790
 Special people!

199
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:25,240
 On special cases!

200
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,330
 Let's solve them well in a special way! Cheers!

201
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:29,420
 - Cheers!

202
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:31,680
 Thank you!

203
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:34,440
 I wish we could do this every night.

204
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:38,680
 Let's eat.

205
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:44,170
 - Please eat up. It's good. 
 - Okay.

206
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,840
 It's good.

207
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,440
 Excuse me, one more fried tripe dish over here, please!

208
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,390
 Why would you order one more when we just got this one? Two more, please!

209
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:36,440
You can't trust anyone in this world...

210
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:39,200
But we can trust this, Hyeong. This is the real thing.

211
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,310
I looked at it, and it hasn't been tampered with at all.

212
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:46,380
- But how can he live after that? 
 - Apparently he can.

213
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,030
What's going on?
 Director of Seoul Hangang Hospital receiving inpatient treatment for chronic disease

214
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:58,270
Total lies...

215
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:05,300
The police agency believes that Team Leader will go after Son Min Ho.

216
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:08,490
So all the roads leading to the hospital are blocked and the hospital's security is tightened.

217
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:10,940
Why would Staff Captain Do go after Son Min Ho again?

218
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:12,560
Right. He's not the type to do that.

219
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:15,760
If he wanted to kill him, he would have done it already.

220
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:20,210
He stabbed him while avoiding the artery.

221
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:22,670
I told you he's not someone who would kill anyone.

222
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:23,730
He avoided the artery?

223
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:27,580
If he had stabbed him right in the artery and pulled out the artery's  branches

224
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,760
it would have been difficult for Son to survive due to blood loss.

225
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,170
But he didn't do that.

226
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:34,370
By giving Son Min Ho the sense of fear that he could die,

227
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:37,790
he wanted to find out something.

228
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:40,990
I don't know what he wanted to find out, though...

229
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:44,000
Then are we off the Son Min Ho case?

230
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,180
No. I'm going over there right now.

231
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:48,890
You're going to Son Min Ho right now?

232
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:50,250
You said Team Leader won't show up.

233
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:53,970
I said Staff Captain wouldn't show up, but I didn't say we wouldn't.

234
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:55,590
We should go and ask

235
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:58,900
what Staff Captain wanted to find out.

236
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,100
We?

237
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:02,360
Oh, I think I might really be dumb.

238
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,200
As long as you know. Come. Come with us! Hurry.

239
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:12,130
- You surprised me. What are you looking at? 
 - Did you really kill someone?

240
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:16,350
- You're dealing in drugs to buy a supercar. 
 - That's not the same.

241
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:24,250
I don't think I can kill a person.

242
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:26,250
Even if your grandmother dies?

243
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:27,760
Why would you say something like that?

244
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,760
My grandma is going to live for a long time!

245
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,330
Fine. I'm sorry.

246
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:34,780
I shouldn't have said it.

247
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,220
What's wrong with you?

248
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:40,970
Anyway, I knew from the moment I met you that there was pitch black darkness in your eyes.

249
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,600
You're up?

250
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:48,970
It's nice to see the punk who nearly died with the one who's going to die soon.

251
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:52,650
Nearly died? Going to die soon?

252
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:54,280
Why would I die?

253
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,490
I heard a lot of people are after you.

254
00:23:57,130 --> 00:23:58,600
Don't sell in other's territory.

255
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:02,970
I don't want to... but I don't have enough for grandma's surgery.

256
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:04,630
You'll die doing that.

257
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:09,630
The drugs that punk is selling can kill two, three people easily.

258
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:12,580
Let's see.

259
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:15,300
I treated it somewhat, but I'm not confident.

260
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:18,200
I don't know if I stopped all the bleeding.

261
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,790
I think the knife hit an organ.

262
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:23,230
It's a bit ambiguous.

263
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:27,220
Hah, ambiguous? You can even feel the state of your own organs?

264
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:32,820
I think I'll be able to move in three to four hours. You did well.

265
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:36,510
Then do you know when you'll die, too?

266
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:40,730
When will that thing in your brain explode?

267
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:43,850
Get me some candy.

268
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:52,340
If you open that drawer, there should be a lot of candy. Give me one.

269
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,690
It's not a normal candy?

270
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:04,610
It's only for adults.

271
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:10,550
It worked out well. Use this time as an opportunity to stop doing that dangerous work

272
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:15,260
and get married to a researcher from your dad's lab who only knows about studying

273
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:17,480
and have some children and live happily.

274
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,400
Hold on, please be quiet.

275
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:23,620
What is this?

276
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:26,580
This is not what's important right now, Mom.

277
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:29,070
Doesn't Dad's lab study cells or something?

278
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:35,160
What's important right now is that whoever isn't outside working should at least clean the house!

279
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,560
Mom!

280
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:39,680
You know there used to be a place called White Night Village a long time ago?

281
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:44,190
I think what was being researched there might have been similar to what Dad is doing.

282
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:46,780
Running tests concerning cells or something.

283
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:48,550
Do you think he might know someone who would know?

284
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:52,320
What are you saying? Kid,

285
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:59,690
your dad cares about his job so much that he wouldn't even notice if somebody dies next to him.

286
00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:04,340
There's no way he would know anyone.

287
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:09,160
 Ex-Staff Captain Do Jeong Wu who killed five people suddenly collapsed while being

288
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,820
 transferred to the prosecution

289
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:13,760
 and was taken to the hospital. While being treated—  
 - Mom, I told you not to watch stuff like this.

290
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,070
 it was later reported that he escaped from the hospital.

291
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:18,930
 It has shocked the nation once more.

292
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:20,900
Any news on Do Jeong Wu's whereabouts yet?

293
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:22,300
No, sir. Not yet.

294
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:29,010
Where is this punk and what is he up to? Is he dead or alive?

295
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:29,960
What about Mr. Son Min Ho?

296
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:33,130
Apart from his ward, all the other rooms have been emptied.

297
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:35,340
And we've reinforced security.

298
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:39,000
Protect him well. You never know when Do Jeong Wu will show up again.

299
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,590
Yes, sir.

300
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:46,920
Yes? Yes, I'll head up right now.

301
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,590
Let's go.

302
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:50,590
I'll be with the Commissioner, so let me know right away if anything comes up.

303
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:52,240
Yes, sir.

304
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:03,040
Can we see him when they've beefed up security?

305
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:07,810
No wonder Staff Captain Do planned to kill four people just to meet him.

306
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:12,700
Oh, was it five?

307
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,700
You're working hard.

308
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:44,300
Oh, this.

309
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:47,820
There was a report of theft at a ward today. I wanted to check the CCTV.

310
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:49,580
Please help me out.

311
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:51,990
Oh, sure. Just a second.

312
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:17,100
- Hello? 
  - Where are you?

313
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,380
A-at home.

314
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:24,780
Then, you were home the entire day?

315
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:28,410
Well, no.

316
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:31,070
Lef-... I was working but left to come home.

317
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:33,090
 Are you with Lieutenant Yun?

318
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:35,600
Is it hard to gauge how serious this situation is

319
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:39,180
now that you're used to comfortably eating off the country as a police officer?

320
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,800
You feel all cool right now with that loyalty of yours, don't you?

321
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:47,330
 So you can't sense how much you'll regret ruining your life, right?

322
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:49,510
In the end, you're responsible for your own life.

323
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:52,490
Wherever you are and whatever you're doing, stop immediately.

324
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,370
What are you doing? Aren't you getting ready?

325
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:00,160
Y- yes.

326
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,500
 N- nurse?

327
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,200
I think it's switched...

328
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:17,200
Say hello. You know him, don't you? Oh Jeong Hwan, President's Chief of Staff?

329
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:22,780
It's a pleasure meeting you. I'm Deputy Chief Hwang Byeong Cheol of the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency.

330
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:24,360
It's a pleasure to meet you.

331
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:28,900
I've heard from the director that you're quite capable.

332
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:29,960
You're too kind.

333
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:33,200
It's nice to meet you in person.

334
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,000
- Oh, please sit down. 
 - Yes, sir.

335
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:42,830
So you're Staff Captain Do Jeong Wu's direct supervisor?

336
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:43,730
Yes, sir.

337
00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:48,510
You must be very tired since he's making the headlines these days.

338
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:52,920
I apologize.

339
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:56,780
I should have realized it sooner and handled it better so that the case didn't become such big news.

340
00:29:56,780 --> 00:30:01,460
So where Staff Captain Do is... you don't know yet, right?

341
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:08,500
No, sir. We don't have any confirmation,

342
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:12,340
but I'll do my best so that he can be apprehended as soon as possible.

343
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:15,070
I apologize for the trouble.

344
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:38,850
I was right.

345
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:46,300
Why would the Chief Secretary of the Blue House care about Do Jeong Wu?

346
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:49,550
 Nurse's Station 
 Goseong University Hospital

347
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:17,320
 No Trespassing

348
00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:23,290
Yes, they've assigned only one doctor and nurse who can enter per rotation.

349
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:26,780
 I've hacked the system, so I'll now go ahead and change the

350
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:30,160
picture of the doctor and nurse on the roster to yours and Lieutenant Park's.

351
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:41,820
I can't change them.

352
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:46,420
 I can't change them.

353
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:47,350
Please wait.

354
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:52,330
 I'm going crazy.

355
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:54,820
 We don't have time!

356
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:56,830
 Let's do it! Come on!

357
00:31:56,830 --> 00:32:00,050
 It has to change when I do this!

358
00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:02,730
 Hold on, hold on!

359
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:14,170
 it worked!

360
00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:23,530
 You may enter now.

361
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:34,490
If you don't want to clean, then do some dishes at—

362
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:36,420
Where did she go?

363
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:44,600
 The last victim slit his own throat.

364
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,980
The hospital has the duty of protecting a patient,

365
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:49,620
so you can't look at the medical records without a warrant.

366
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:51,650
I also can't tell you who is the doctor in charge.

367
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:54,110
I apologize.

368
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:56,330
Thank you.

369
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:04,620
Why is there nothing I can do?

370
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:09,450
 Team Leader Do Jeong Wu.

371
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:11,200
Excuse me.

372
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:14,420
Patient.

373
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:17,470
Patient.

374
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:19,630
Patient.

375
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:21,550
Patient.

376
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:46,470
You know, if someone kills my grandma, do I have to kill that person?

377
00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:49,570
If I think about it, I feel like I might be able to kill someone, too.

378
00:34:49,570 --> 00:34:52,950
But if I think about it, that scares me, too.

379
00:34:52,950 --> 00:34:54,550
I don't think I can do it.

380
00:34:54,550 --> 00:35:00,470
Can't I just wish for my grandma to live with me for a very long time instead?

381
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:02,230
It'll end up that way.

382
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:04,980
Stop selling drugs. You're the only one who your grandma has to depend on.

383
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:08,600
You worry about yourself. I got it handled.

384
00:35:27,090 --> 00:35:32,030
Aren't you going to stop him? He's not fully recovered.

385
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:34,480
You said it's terminal.

386
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:39,890
He crawled out because he feels like he can bear it. You never know when he'll come crawling back in again.

387
00:35:39,890 --> 00:35:43,510
You can't figure out what he's thinking, let alone what he's up to, so don't get attached.

388
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:45,860
Have you not gotten attached then?

389
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:54,570
 Just eat when I tell you. How long are you going to hold out?

390
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:57,460
 If you're going to die, go out there and die then!

391
00:35:57,460 --> 00:36:00,090
 Look at that glare! Your eyes are at least alive!

392
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:03,850
 They look like twisted dry anchovies and someone is going to catch them.

393
00:36:03,850 --> 00:36:08,040
 Didn't your parents teach you to look down respectfully when facing an adult?

394
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:11,340
 That's why the education in the home is important.

395
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:16,000
 A kid who has no parents doesn't get anything like that.

396
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,730
 Didn't your parents teach you not to say something like that?

397
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:23,400
 W-W-What?

398
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:26,060
 Why would a kid who has parents be starving like this?

399
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:30,010
 Instead of asking nosy questions, just ask if my parents abandoned me.

400
00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:32,470
 This ...

401
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:36,630
 Do you think it's cool to be cursing with your mouth while saying you're feeling pity?

402
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:38,550
 It's a delusion.

403
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:42,810
 Jeez.

404
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:47,790
 I wasn't abandoned.  I never had a mom or dad from the start.

405
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:53,200
 Why on earth do people here think a child must naturally have a mom and dad?

406
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,400
 Because it's natural.

407
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,750
 As long as you're Park Hyeok Geo, there is a mom and dad unless you were hatched from an egg.

408
00:36:57,750 --> 00:37:01,060
 Even an egg was laid by a mother.

409
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:04,890
 So because something doesn't have a mom or dad, you don't want to have any manners?

410
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:06,560
 According to what are manners determined?

411
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:09,230
 Age? Intelligence?

412
00:37:10,330 --> 00:37:13,100
 Gosh, this brat.

413
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:15,160
 Amazing.

414
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:18,960
 So you both have no manners, and you're not eating ramen too?

415
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:28,000
 I don't know.

416
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,990
  What?  I didn't hear you.

417
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:32,530
 I'm saying I don't know how to eat.

418
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:36,760
 It's the first time I'm seeing tthis.

419
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:40,030
 This is the first time seeing ramen?

420
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:41,920
 Even this.

421
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:06,760
So don't do that.

422
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:09,550
Did he really kill people?

423
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:13,860
Is he really going to die?

424
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:20,730
If you inject a high dosage of fever reducer directly into the blood vessels, the heart will stop in ten minutes.

425
00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:28,130
You must inject the antagonist within five minutes.

426
00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:36,270
What did Staff Captain Do want to know?

427
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:39,530
Do you think the foundation will leave me alone if I tell you that?

428
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:44,930
The foundation or whatever, you will either die now or later.

429
00:38:44,930 --> 00:38:49,460
For now facing you, shouldn't you save your life first?

430
00:38:56,950 --> 00:39:04,580
Would it help if I told you that I also am from the White Night Village?

431
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,190
Five minutes is too short.

432
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:20,000
Let me ask you once again.  What did Staff Captain Do want to know?

433
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,820
Did that person come here the day that Kim Seon Ok died?

434
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:27,780
He said he was a cop.

435
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:31,480
He had a unique character.

436
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:33,190
Hey there, who are you?

437
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:37,660
 Check the CCTV in the security room and find her location. If you find her, call me here.

438
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:40,520
- What? 
 - Hurry now! Fast!

439
00:39:42,970 --> 00:39:45,320
Mr. Jeong! Come here.

440
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,530
- What's up? 
 - Come.

441
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:53,230
He's a caregiver who has worked here for a while. He'll probably know something about that woman.

442
00:39:55,720 --> 00:40:00,790
Three people caused the village to shutdown. They were considered special kids in the lab.

443
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:02,780
They were always together.

444
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:06,260
How did children cause the destruction of the village?

445
00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:13,430
I don't know.

446
00:40:13,430 --> 00:40:18,710
It was just really similar to the recent serial killings. Everyone acted so strangely.

447
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:21,840
All of them did dangerous things without hesitating and died.

448
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:24,590
That's how I knew that those kids were back.

449
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:27,540
They were not on the list of survivors from the incident

450
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:29,280
so it was assumed they were dead.

451
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:33,360
Weren't you afraid? That they'd come to find you?

452
00:40:35,050 --> 00:40:41,620
Why do you think I had so many bodyguards and lived in that kind of a house?

453
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:45,780
Now give me the antidote.

454
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:57,130
To summarize, the human experiments are still going on somewhere

455
00:40:57,130 --> 00:40:58,940
and the key member is still there.

456
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:02,190
Staff Captain Do learned all this before he left, right?

457
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:07,670
And Staff Captain Do Jeong Wu is one of those three kids.

458
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:16,440
The antido-

459
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:22,570
Oh no. What do we do?

460
00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:28,070
Even if you inject fever reducers in high dosages, it can't make a person's heart stop.

461
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:32,090
What I injected earlier was a sedative.

462
00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:37,700
It does make people a little more honest, though.

463
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:40,550
Let's go.

464
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:06,660
She was crazy. She kept saying someone was coming to get her,

465
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:10,670
that she was being chased, and that if she was captured she would die and that's how that mess happened.

466
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:12,280
True, true.

467
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:15,520
She always ran away to hide so I had to go looking for her too.

468
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,630
She said that rather than return, she would die.

469
00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:19,380
Rather than return, she would die?

470
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:23,340
Of course, no one knew what she was talking about, but she was so scared.

471
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:27,500
Like a wildcat. She didn't seem human, and she got violent when she got scared.

472
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:29,900
She was like that animal.

473
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:32,560
How bad must it have been for her to do something that gruesome?

474
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:35,030
It was such a bloodbath.

475
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:39,400
But the strange thing is, despite all that, the police didn't come.

476
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:40,810
That's because it was a suicide.

477
00:42:40,810 --> 00:42:43,980
But I reported it to them.

478
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:47,500
But that woman was climbing up the wall.

479
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:50,360
- For real. 
 Do Jeong Wu

480
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:03,940
 Background Investigation Report: Oh Jeong Hwan

481
00:43:22,310 --> 00:43:24,080
 Team Leader Do Jeong Wu

482
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:26,870
 Team Leader?

483
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:45,620
 Attention seeker Lee Ji Wuk

484
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:48,250
You! Are you going to keep writing trashy articles like that?

485
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:52,000
Calm down first and have a seat.

486
00:43:54,730 --> 00:43:56,710
What is it?

487
00:43:58,190 --> 00:44:00,160
Take a look.

488
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:05,390
What about it?

489
00:44:05,390 --> 00:44:07,560
Do Jeong Wu's goal was definitely Son Min Ho.

490
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:11,560
But the video of the crime scene that was sent to me was of Nam Wu Cheon, not Son Min Ho.

491
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:13,430
And...

492
00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:20,270
What is this?

493
00:44:20,270 --> 00:44:21,980
A new forewarned murder.

494
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:25,360
This came even though your Team Leader was in prison.

495
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:27,750
There was no warning message.

496
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:30,720
It seems like the person who sent the warnings and the person who sent the videos are different, right?

497
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:33,850
If it were the same person, either both would have come, or none would have come at all.

498
00:44:33,850 --> 00:44:38,260
If Staff Captain Do is one of these people, he would be the one who sent the warning notices

499
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:41,360
because he couldn't have sent a warning notice this time.

500
00:44:43,530 --> 00:44:47,370
So who on earth are you saying sent the videos?

501
00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:50,370
I'm not sure.

502
00:45:01,070 --> 00:45:03,470
What are you doing right now?!

503
00:45:03,470 --> 00:45:06,790
Oh, Hyung. I-It's nothing.

504
00:45:06,790 --> 00:45:08,860
I said you should do only what I tell you to do, didn't I?

505
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:11,500
I just took a glance at it.

506
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:13,620
Shut up.

507
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:18,510
Please don't write an article about what I'm about to say.

508
00:45:18,510 --> 00:45:22,990
What? If I can't write an article about it, what's the point?

509
00:45:22,990 --> 00:45:28,320
It'll all be yours later so just trust me for now.

510
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:36,080
There did human experiments at White Night Village.

511
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:39,870
I think the subjects were all children who were younger than 10.

512
00:45:47,150 --> 00:45:52,710
I knew something fishy went on in White Night Village but human experiments?

513
00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:56,210
They're smart. They claimed to be a charity and they used kids for experiments?

514
00:45:56,210 --> 00:45:57,400
What experiments could they have done there?

515
00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:00,750
Wasn't it new medicine development? Son Min Ho sold some nutritional supplements and made a fortune.

516
00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:02,690
Because there was a medicine laboratory on the island

517
00:46:02,690 --> 00:46:05,890
I also thought that they did experiments related to nutritional supplements.

518
00:46:05,890 --> 00:46:09,940
But no one claimed that.

519
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:12,530
So what did they really do?

520
00:46:12,530 --> 00:46:17,280
What did they want to do, considering that it still isn't over?

521
00:47:09,830 --> 00:47:11,990
It's driving me crazy.

522
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:34,130
I don't know anything.

523
00:48:44,650 --> 00:48:49,710
But Son Min Ho said you are a key figure in the White Night foundation.

524
00:48:49,710 --> 00:48:50,970
Aren't you?

525
00:48:50,970 --> 00:48:54,110
The reason I'm involved in the foundation is because of my wife.

526
00:48:54,110 --> 00:48:58,650
My late father-in-law was one of the founding officers of the White Night Foundation.

527
00:48:58,650 --> 00:49:03,720
Of course, he was not His Excellency but Lt. General Yuk.

528
00:49:05,430 --> 00:49:07,400
What does family mean?

529
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:09,840
Anyway, things ended up like this.

530
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:13,550
But to be honest, pursuing profits for the foundation was beneficial to me, too.

531
00:49:13,550 --> 00:49:19,310
However, when I heard that Mr. Son mentioned my name, it did worry me.

532
00:49:19,310 --> 00:49:22,640
What do you want? I despise fights.

533
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:27,880
So if you promise to leave my house, I'll tell you everything you want to know.

534
00:49:33,750 --> 00:49:36,810
- Why so easy?
 - Is there a reason it shouldn't be easy?

535
00:49:36,810 --> 00:49:38,500
It's called pitting one group against another.

536
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:44,280
If you continue to go around causing moderate trouble, just like now, my shares will grow.

537
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:48,710
In any case, my personal safety is the most important to me, shall I say?

538
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:54,000
How very loyal you are. Where is His Excellency?

539
00:49:55,310 --> 00:49:56,780
I don't know.

540
00:49:56,780 --> 00:50:02,340
I know that he is still vigorous at the age of 106 years and still making all decisions for the Foundation.

541
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:04,780
But even I don't know where he resides.

542
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:09,270
The only person who can directly deal with His Excellency,

543
00:50:09,270 --> 00:50:13,890
ah, isn't it someone who is already known to you?

544
00:50:17,670 --> 00:50:22,360
So you guys produced drugs using the method I created.

545
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:26,870
So it looks like the wrong person is holding power right now.

546
00:50:27,630 --> 00:50:30,480
Science is a truly remarkable thing.

547
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:34,280
Just think about the power of that small medicine pill.

548
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:38,040
Then do you know where the secret laboratory is?

549
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:41,580
I do not know that, either, because there is no reason for me to go there.

550
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:44,040
Why not ask him directly?

551
00:51:33,770 --> 00:51:34,600
What is this?

552
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:36,010
You're not even going to work these days. Where would you be going?

553
00:51:36,010 --> 00:51:37,940
Go to Dad's laboratory.

554
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:39,540
Why Dad's laboratory at this hour?

555
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:42,990
Dad and daughter, both so inattentive.

556
00:51:42,990 --> 00:51:46,690
It's been days since Dad's been home. He won't have clean clothes to change into.

557
00:51:46,690 --> 00:51:48,220
I'm sure he smells by now.

558
00:51:48,220 --> 00:51:49,940
Dad still lives that way?

559
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:52,340
I'm sure he will for the rest of his life.

560
00:51:53,450 --> 00:51:56,270
I wonder if  he  has clean clothes to change into...

561
00:51:56,270 --> 00:51:57,570
What?

562
00:51:57,570 --> 00:51:59,440
I meant, do you like Dad so much?

563
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:02,100
You don't even see him often. Why do you bother making all this effort to take care of him?

564
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:04,370
Is family only the people you like?

565
00:52:04,370 --> 00:52:07,240
Somehow we became family.

566
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:09,300
Alright. I'll go.

567
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:11,080
Okay.

568
00:52:41,970 --> 00:52:46,650
 Three people made that village collapse. They were special children, even while in the lab.

569
00:52:46,650 --> 00:52:49,600
 They were always together.

570
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:56,510
 Three children were always together.

571
00:53:00,210 --> 00:53:02,680
What's wrong? Can we help Team Leader?

572
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:07,910
Son Min Ho said that among the list of children who survived, three children were omitted.

573
00:53:07,910 --> 00:53:10,240
One of them is probably me.

574
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:13,850
The other one is Staff Captain Do. So we have to find the third child.

575
00:53:13,850 --> 00:53:15,290
Why must we find that child, suddenly?

576
00:53:15,290 --> 00:53:18,810
One of the three children, using a similar method as the serial murders

577
00:53:18,810 --> 00:53:21,910
caused the destruction of White Night Village 28 years ago.

578
00:53:21,910 --> 00:53:27,330
So among those three children, if Staff Captain Do and I are not the culprits,

579
00:53:27,330 --> 00:53:30,250
then the third child will be the culprit.

580
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:33,970
You still haven't come to your senses.

581
00:53:33,970 --> 00:53:37,540
Did you forget what happens if you speak to other people?

582
00:53:41,670 --> 00:53:44,110
You haven't been beaten enough.

583
00:53:44,110 --> 00:53:46,780
That girl working at the convenience store died because of you, too.

584
00:53:46,780 --> 00:53:49,520
Because you are annoying! Annoying!

585
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:54,250
Annoying! Annoying! Annoying! You bastard!

586
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:19,740
Do Jeong Wu will go to the White Night lab soon.

587
00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:21,630
Yes.

588
00:54:33,310 --> 00:54:36,490
Hello, I'm Chief Gong Il Do's daughter.

589
00:54:36,490 --> 00:54:39,050
I brought some clothes and snacks for Dad.

590
00:54:39,050 --> 00:54:43,950
Oh, you're his daughter. You can leave me your Citizen ID and go on in.

591
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:46,750
Here.

592
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:48,970
Thank you.

594
00:56:33,170 --> 00:56:36,810
Let's not waste time. If you love your daughter, let's get to the point.

595
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:37,980
What is it that you want?

596
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:43,460
The secret lab where the research has been continuing, and the location of the support fund.

597
00:56:43,460 --> 00:56:46,120
My method was used for His Excellency, I heard?

598
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:49,040
So he's over 100 years old, but still very healthy.

599
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:54,160
But I cannot seem to find out where this guy is and what's he up to.

600
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:55,580
What do you plan to do?

601
00:56:55,580 --> 00:57:00,830
If improper things are happening I should set it right. I have the power to do that.

602
00:57:16,350 --> 00:57:20,240
If you kill me, do you think Hye Won will ever forgive you?

603
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:21,720
I don't want forgiveness.

604
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:25,600
How will your daughter feel if I killed you?

605
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:29,700
She's the one who suffers, and that's why I kept her next to me.

606
00:57:35,940 --> 00:57:38,200
So tell me where the secret laboratory is.

607
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:41,740
And where is the support fund right now?

608

 Didn't you hear me? What are you doing here, I asked.

614

 If something improper is going on, we must set it right.

 Think about it. If only the powerful people could live forever, what will become of this world?
