1
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:09,000

2
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:38,070
 Awaken

3
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:47,950
 Right now, Lee Ji Wuk is going around saying that a forewarned serial murder is

4
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:51,760
  happening which the police are not intervening into.

5
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,730
 And it's become a situation where we're even getting tips.

6
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:56,880
 We even saw Baek Seung Jae's case ourselves, but it was definitively a suicide.

7
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,160
 Not at all.

8
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,810
 That wasn't a suicide?

9
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:03,670
 Like this. We didn't have a reaction like this from any of the victims.

10
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:05,520
 Should we call it a reflex?

11
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:08,170
 All of them have been to this building.

12
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:11,230
 How sure are you about this information?

13
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:13,150
 Lee Ji Wuk did properly find him.

14
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:15,280
 He did find him.

15
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:20,960
 Son Min Ho, a key figure in the White Night Village disaster that shook Korea 28 years ago.

16
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,150
 Son Min Ho is confirmed as the next victim.

17
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:26,150
 Then now we just need to go to Son Min Ho.

18
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:28,030
 I'm also going to the scene.

19
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:31,160
 There are 12 minutes left until the predicted time.

20
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:33,860
 It's Staff Captain Do Jeong Wu.

21
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:36,170
 The person who killed Kim Yeong Jun, Park Gyu Tae, Baek Seung Jae, and Choi Yong Seok

22
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:39,820
 and the person who made Nam Wu Cheon set the fire, it was all Staff Captain Do Jeong Wu.

23
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:42,890
 After looking at the results, I concluded that Do Jeong Wu is the criminal.

24
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:45,540
 The only person who is in a position to kill Son Min Ho

25
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,500
 is Staff Captain Do Jeong Wu.

26
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,450
 You're still researching, right?

27
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:53,470
 I did hear that there is a secret research center.

28
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:56,430
 Oh Jeong Hwan, the Chief of Staff at the Blue House.

29
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:58,920
 He's key to the foundation.

30
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,130
 Get away from him.

31
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:03,490
 I was born in White Night Village.

32
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:07,450
 I was one of the kids they experimented on.

33
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:09,260
 What's so amazingly different about him?

34
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:11,190
  It's more than amazing.

35
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:14,030
 Whoever was created in the White Night Village lab,

36
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:17,960
 you could say he's something different than a human.

37
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,540
 You have to get that police officer in your hands somehow.

38
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:24,750
 If that police officer is that child, he'll have the answer.

39
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:28,440
 You make him dream without realizing that he's dreaming.

40
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:33,060
 When you want to wake up from that dream, you act in the way you've agreed to.

41
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:35,760
 As expected, the 'lucid dream' technique was used.

42
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,710
 If you receive a proposition, it will be best to just accept it and not try to dig in more.

43
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:41,810
 You just heard things you shouldn't have heard.

44
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:44,900
 Cerebral artery dissection can affect him at any time.

45
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,390
 I guess he'll be going to the hospital now.

46
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:50,630
 Team Leader talked about White Night Village, and suddenly the prosecution stormed in.

47
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:54,260
 There's more to this incident.

48
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:00,100
 2 years ago

49
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:09,470
 Episode 7

50
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:13,100
It doesn't seem like there's anything abnormal.

51
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:28,020
Are you able to track down the survivors of White Night Village?

52
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:30,070
If you have this. (hand gesture for money)

53
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:34,140
Money is no object, so go ahead.

54
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:37,680
What? I've heard that dying people start doing things they normally don't do.

55
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,600
Is something wrong?

56
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,670
You're smart.

57
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:46,850
I'm dying, so could you move quickly?

58
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:04,240
 Gong Hye Won

59
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:18,150
 There are a total of 7 survivors from the White Night Village disaster.

60
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:21,100
 5 of them have passed away. Seems like there are only two people alive.

61
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:24,000
 Presumed survivors: Kim Seon Ok, Kim Min Jae.

62
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,220
Two people are still holding on.

63
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:31,600
Only two people are still holding on.

64
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,700
Kim Seon Ok, 37 years old.

65
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:37,170
She was adopted by an ordinary family, but there was a dissolution of adoption.

66
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:39,450
After that, I think she failed to adapt to society.

67
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:43,080
She kept saying that someone was following her and trying to abduct her.

68
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:46,310
She kept uttering nonsense, so she's currently a mental hospital patient.

69
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,760
It seemed pretty dreadful.

70
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:55,720
Where is this?

71
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,170
Does she have superpowers?

72
00:04:57,170 --> 00:05:01,080
- Why is the fluorescent light she's holding blinking? 
 - It's static electricity. I asked you where this place is.

73
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,110
You're saying static electricity can do that? Why is she doing that?

74
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:06,890
- It's Morse code for SOS.
 - SOS?

75
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:09,670
That's why I'm asking you where this is?

76
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,080
They're here. They're here again.

77
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,440
They're finding us faster.

78
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,580
Go over there!

79
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:11,240
Look here, who are you?

80
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,460
I'm a policeman.

81
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:17,500
The mental hospital ward is closed down at this time. All the elevators are stopped.

82
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,130
You know Patient Kim Seon Ok in Room 517, right?

83
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:21,250
Check on the CCTV in the security room to find her position.

84
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,590
If you find out where she is,

85
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,630
contact me here.

86
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:26,530
 Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency
Staff Captain Do Jeong Wu

87
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:30,270
What are you doing? Get moving.

88
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:40,180
- Yes. 
- Patient Kim Seon Ok

89
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:43,560
I think she's heading up to the roof.

90
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,000
Hurry and go up.

91
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,690
Go up the stairs.

92
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:16,960
Look here, Miss Kim Seon Ok. Wake up.

93
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:25,210
You're number 113.

94
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:26,800
I remember.

95
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,420
You stood out the most among us.

96
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,470
Look here. Stay awake.

97
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:37,910
Rather than getting caught by them again,

98
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:40,750
it'd be better to die.

99
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:51,880
Now I'm free.

100
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:56,710
No one can find me now.

101
00:07:57,730 --> 00:08:00,290
Look here, look here.

102
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:41,810
 Now there's only one person left alive.

103
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:47,070
  The head of action, Kim Min Jae, who is affiliated with a gang named Wongwang Faction.

104
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:49,330
Situation report.

105
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:51,380
The Wongwang and the Chilseong factions are fighting each other.

106
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:54,160
It seems like they saw the end together.

107
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,790
Ah, her.

108
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,460
What is she? Why is she so tough?

109
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:02,740
She's a little off.

110
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:05,430
She's with the traffic unit, and when Chilseong faction bastards were chasing Wongwang faction

111
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:07,710
she chased them down for violating the speed limit.

112
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:09,860
Seriously, is she going to give them a traffic ticket right now?

113
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:11,430
Let's go.

114
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,690
Hey, where's your gun?

115
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:05,990
I can only shoot the taser gun once.

116
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:08,020
The first bullet is a blank. (used to fire warning shot)

117
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,080
Are you for real?

118
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,770
What are you trying to do?

119
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:24,260
This one, she needs a proper performance evaluation because she is such a nutty troublemaker.

120
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:25,690
And this one.

121
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,520
Did he really graduate from the Police Academy?

122
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:32,870
No way. Even if the Commissioner consented, this isn't happening with these people.

123
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:37,050
Then please add someone who has your approval.

124
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:42,850
Or someone who the Deputy Chief approves of.

125
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:54,250
Did you make a deal with the Commissioner?

126
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:55,530
What?

127
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:59,080
The police, the pillars of the community, making an internal deal?

128
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,930
What is it? What are you holding over his head?

129
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,300
The Commissioner of the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency? What weakness would he have?

130
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:12,260
Do what you want.

131
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:14,650
I won't take responsibility for those two.

132
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:15,910
Okay.

133
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:19,330
Ah, I'm sorry. Please let me off this time. I really just forgot.

134
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:22,000
I can just pay it now.

135
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,420
I'm asking you to let me off this once. Ah, seriously.

136
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:32,270
Look here. Why are you so inflexible?

137
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:36,470
What's so wrong with not wearing my seatbelt? You really–

138
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:39,210
If you continue like this, I'll arrest you for unlawful obstruction of official duty.

139
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:41,100
Yes, yes, I got it. I'm sorry.

140
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:46,220
Let me off once. Ah this, this–

141
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,120
 Everything was always clear for me.

142
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,370
Ah, it hurts.

143
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:57,390
 It was the first time

144
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:59,580
 I got a feeling that things may become unclear.

145
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,500
You can't park here.

146
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:21,200
Would you like to work with me?

147
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,460
 Gong Hye Won

148
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:38,220
 Gong Il Do

149
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:47,870
 Everything was always clear, but...

150
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:54,940
 Team Leader, you like me, right?

151
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:59,210
 Everything was clear.

152
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,830
 Everything had to be clear.

153
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:14,800
 Find someone that you can rely on.

154
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,630
 Don't like me, because I have no interest in you.

155
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:20,970
 It'll be better for you to move to another team. I'll find another team for you.

156
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:23,470
 But things became unclear

157
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:28,040
 including the words that came out of my mouth, and who they were said for.

158
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:32,620
 Awaken

159
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:55,200
Where's Lieutenant Jang?

160
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,570
He cried too much so I kicked him out.

161
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:04,840
You look like you need to cry too.

162
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:12,810
I feel like

163
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:16,980
I'm dreaming right now.

164
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:25,020
I can't even accept that he's the serial killer we've been looking so hard for.

165
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:27,860
And now he's terminally ill.

166
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:38,010
Rest a bit.

167
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:41,260
Although it won't be easy.

168
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:31,230
 All units, move to the first floor immediately.

169
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:33,680
Did the Foundation send you?

170
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:36,180
Why are you so good?

171
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:41,510
They sent you from the Founda–

172
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:50,110
Wait, wait, wait. It hurts so much.

173
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:59,250
I said it hurts.

174
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,680
It hurts.

175
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:51,450
Go to the stairs. To the elevator.

176
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:24,270
- What's going on. 
 - You can fight, right?

177
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,700
What?

178
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,300
Isn't it better since there are two of us?

179
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,090
It is.

180
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:45,070
Are you okay?

181
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:48,210
What on earth is going on?

182
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:53,320
I'm dying soon but apparently, there are many people who can't wait for that.

183
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,710
Are you saying someone came to kill you?

184
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:58,150
Who? Why?

185
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:02,140
Were you hurt?

186
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:17,130
Are you...really the culprit?

187
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:22,780
Are you really dying?

188
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,030
I'm sorry.

189
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:37,500
Did he run away alone?

190
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:41,640
The thing is...he was with Chief Gong Il Do's daughter, Gong Hye Won, so-

191
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,650
It doesn't matter.

192
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:51,340
Get more people and double down on the inspection. Find him at any cost.

193
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:53,540
Yes, sir.

194
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,530
Do you feel sorry for me because I'm dying?

195
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:03,940
Act as you usually do. Everyone dies.

196
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:07,360
How can you say that?

197
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,090
Let's go.

198
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:18,000
What are you doing now? Hey!

199
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:23,430
- Let's go.  
 - I can't go to the hospital. I almost died there.

200
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:24,990
We aren't going to the hospital.

201
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:27,850
We're going to the police agency.

202
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:52,070
After I figure out what's going on, we'll go to the hospital.

203
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:18,240
 It's because the forewarned murders don't seem like the whole story. I think there's more to it.

204
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:22,280
 Why is everyone now ignoring the fact that so many things do not make sense?

205
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:26,010
Things that make no sense...

206
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:28,730
 Son Min Ho

207
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:35,250
Why did he rescue Son Min Ho from the fire?

208
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:40,510
If he wanted revenge, he could have just left him to die.

209
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:48,030
 You're the only police officer who is going to guard Mr. Son.

210
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:51,770
 Get away from him now!

211
00:26:57,340 --> 00:27:02,910
He never planned to kill him but tried to find out something.

212
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:14,480
What are you doing here?

213
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:22,360
Exactly. I have no idea right now what I'm doing right now.

214
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:29,710
That punk Do Jeong Wu. I feel so sorry for him.

215
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:35,780
He's been admitted to the hospital so let's observe him for now.

216
00:27:38,170 --> 00:27:41,550
It's late. Let's go.

217
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:49,600
How can you be so cold-hearted?

218
00:27:55,880 --> 00:28:00,400
I have two kids. They're not even in college yet.

219
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,700
Do Jeong Wu disappeared?!

220
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:34,000
Do Jeong Wu doesn't own a personal credit card.

221
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,960
He withdrew his salary every payday so his bank account is also empty.

222
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,480
In addition, he has absolutely no bank transactions, insurance policies, stock,

223
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:42,300
or records of real estate transactions.

224
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:48,070
But even if he doesn't have any housing to his name, shouldn't he be living somewhere?

225
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:51,560
Lieutenant Oh, zoom in.

226
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,200
He doesn't have a place of resident registration?

227
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:57,690
His place of resident registration is the address of his team member Lieutenant Jang Ji Wan's house.

228
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,450
En-

229
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:14,830
En- ce - pha- lo- pa - thy.  (T/N: Softening of the brain)

230
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:17,780
 Encepalopathy

231
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:33,310
Detective Jang?

232
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,740
Why is the military here?

233
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:48,600
There must be a reason for them to be.

234
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,930
In this country?

235
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:52,160
If there wasn't a murder why would the military get involved?

236
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:56,070
Who knows? I'm not quite sure either.

237
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:01,130
This punk.

238
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:04,160
Is this why he always slept in the holding cells?

239
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:08,580
How many times do I have to tell you that he's different from what you think?

240
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:12,390
His personal items kept in the detectives' room is probably his entire personal possessions.

241
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:17,650
 Why are you walking around biting a toothbrush?

242
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:21,100
 You really look like a beggar.

243
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:32,910
Hey.  Go to the Special Investigation Team and get Do Jeong Wu's belongings and put them in my office.

244
00:30:57,390 --> 00:31:00,210
 Forewarned Serial Murder Case File

245
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:13,240
 I'm coming to the Agency with Team Leader.

246
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:25,020
 Hey, what happened? Things are crazy here.

247
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:32,070
 Answer me!

248
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:35,380
I'm going insane.

249
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:39,000
What are they doing?

250
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:42,210
This is driving me nuts.

251
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:57,260
I figured out the hospital where she received surgery.

252
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:59,340
Why isn't she coming to the convenience store?

253
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:01,050
I don't even know her number

254
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:04,600
and she doesn't use social media often.

255
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:10,650
 Jamie Leighton

256
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:14,600
 Jamie Leighton

257
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:53,280
Hyung. I did what you asked of me.

258
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:56,560
Can I go eat some ramen?

259
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,610
Just go to sleep.

260
00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:02,280
I was just hungry.

261
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:06,550
Okay.

262
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:14,300
But... that 'lucid dream,'

263
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:16,420
did you teach me about that?

264
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:21,010
- What? 
 - I seem to know how to make someone dream a lucid dream.

265
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:26,340
- Go to bed now. 
 - Okay.

266
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:54,600
Doctor.

267
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:58,670
Lieutenant Jang, what are you doing here at this time?

268
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:00,130
Did something happen?

269
00:34:00,130 --> 00:34:04,100
I think Team Leader escaped from the hospital.

270
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:07,100
What about Lieutenant Gong? She was also at the hospital with him.

271
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:09,490
She said she was going to escort the Team Leader and come here.

272
00:34:09,490 --> 00:34:12,440
She is on her way here with Staff Captain Do?

273
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:16,780
So did Lieutenant Gong catch Staff Captain Do when he escaped?

274
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:24,610
After that she didn't check her phone.

275
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:27,550
Did you report to the higher ups?

276
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:29,250
No.

277
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,610
Okay I understand I'm on my way.

278
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:40,330
Quickly, quickly.

279
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:42,250
Quickly!

280
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,430
Quickly!

281
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:54,700
Why can't you find him? With all these resources, why not?

282
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:59,670
Deputy Chief, Director.

283
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:04,720
Lieutenant Gong arrested ex-Staff Captain Do, and she said they are on their way here.

284
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:49,260
I thought you were on our side. You're a traitor.

285
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:52,880
I told them they were on the way. I didn't say they were coming to the Special Team Investigation Office.

286
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:56,330
And if you don't report to the higher ups how are you going to handle the aftermath?

287
00:35:56,330 --> 00:35:58,010
Then where are we going right now?

288
00:35:58,010 --> 00:36:02,750
When a culprit is brought to the National Police Agency, where do they get taken to?

289
00:36:03,930 --> 00:36:06,780
 Investigative Office

290
00:36:08,770 --> 00:36:12,240
Stay here. I'm going to make a report.

291
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,360
Gong.

292
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:16,470
Can't you take these off of me?

293
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:20,170
What if someone tries to kill me again like earlier in the hospital?

294
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:30,810
I'll just make the call here.

295
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:35,890
Please take these off. I won't run away.

296
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:10,420
What are you-

297
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:16,880
Sorry.

298
00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:30,000
What the-

299
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,010
Let me see.

300
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:43,110
What is this? What about Staff Captain Do?

301
00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:45,420
Please take these off first.

302
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:49,380
What is this? What's going on?

303
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:54,270
Where is Do Jeong Wu?

304
00:37:55,240 --> 00:38:00,200
Just wait until I get my hands on this bastard. I'm going to kill him!

305
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:06,930
Search everywhere nearby. Mobilize everyone here!

306
00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:08,620
This way.

307
00:38:11,970 --> 00:38:14,020
Go to the left.

308
00:38:15,310 --> 00:38:18,590
To the left.

309
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,880
 I'm going down.

310
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,850
Understood.

311
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:08,430
He used me so he could come into the police agency. That's why he didn't run away at the hospital.

312
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:10,040
So he was caught on purpose.

313
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,780
What's the reason? Can you think of anything?

314
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:14,520
Maybe he left something here?

315
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,410
The laptop.

316
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:18,140
The items brought from the Jangeui-dong building counseling center...

317
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:19,170
That's a possibility.

318
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:21,650
Then Lieutenant Yu and I will go to the Cyber Investigation Team.

319
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:24,370
The rest of Captain Do's belongings should be in the Director's office.

320
00:39:24,370 --> 00:39:26,090
Seeing earlier, she took absolutely everything.

321
00:39:26,090 --> 00:39:28,280
Then let's head over there.

322
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:53,800
Team Leader might come to get the laptop.

323
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:56,680
So then you're saying that your Team Leader is the culprit.

324
00:39:56,680 --> 00:40:01,480
And pestering us and pretending to request our cooperation was all to hide the fact that he killed someone.

325
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:05,300
Wow. You're really an amazing team...

326
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:08,690
So you're saying that the culprit Do Jeong Wu came back to the agency to take something?

327
00:40:08,690 --> 00:40:10,730
For now we'll stay here for a little bit.

328
00:40:10,730 --> 00:40:14,170
Yes, okay. Do whatever you want.

329
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:24,650
This won't do. Some urgent business has come up so I need to go.

330
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:26,590
Are you going for a smoke, right now?

331
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:29,480
Then, can we keep watch during that time?

332
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:32,000
How am I supposed to trust you?

333
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,590
To put it bluntly, what if you're on his side and you take evidence and run?

334
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:37,010
- We're not thieves or anything. 
 - No, please leave.

335
00:40:37,010 --> 00:40:38,710
- We'll only be watching for a short while. 
 - No, please leave.

336
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:39,920
We can leave after being here for a little while.

337
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,160
I'll get fired, please leave!

338
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:43,570
Let us stay here for just a moment, just a short while!

339
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:45,650
Leave.

340
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:07,690
There's no way Team Leader did that.

341
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,400
Let's go meet him ourselves and ask.

342
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,810
We might need the notebook even if Team Leader didn't do it.

343
00:41:15,850 --> 00:41:16,850
Right?

344
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:22,950
Yes.

345
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:40,760
 Director of Information Management Office

346
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:43,300
She's probably in the Situation Room.

347
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:52,210
What do we do? Should we break it?

348
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:12,280
There's no way the Team Leader has this many things.

349
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:19,610
It seems they even wiped all of team member's belongings as well.

350
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:25,270
Is this yours?

351
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:29,720
No, it's not.

352
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:37,510
The Team Leader's things are here.

353
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:41,800
We don't even know what we need to be looking for anyway.

354
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:45,610
In any case, if he did come to look for something, it would probably be in here.

355
00:42:50,130 --> 00:42:51,550
Answer this.

356
00:42:51,550 --> 00:42:54,440
What is your position on Staff Captain Do?

357
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:56,010
Settle your feelings for sure.

358
00:42:56,010 --> 00:42:58,780
Because if you don't, you will be the one who is having the more difficult time later.

359
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:01,300
There's definitely something more than those forewarned murders.

360
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:05,940
Although, I don't know what that is yet. Then what about you?

361
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:10,940
Right now, my position is that Staff Captain Do is the criminal.

362
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,430
But that's not the problem.

363
00:43:14,430 --> 00:43:17,330
Then what's the problem?

364
00:43:17,330 --> 00:43:19,200
Someone's coming.

365
00:43:25,590 --> 00:43:29,350
He came in here so openly, but nobody knew?

366
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:36,240
Where on earth has this kid, Do Jeong Wu,  disappeared off to?

367
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:38,790
Keep your eyes on the CCTV and monitor it closely.

368
00:43:38,790 --> 00:43:40,390
Yes.

369
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:53,230
You solved it quickly.

370
00:43:54,220 --> 00:43:56,720
I thought it would take quite a while.

371
00:43:58,770 --> 00:44:00,490
What did you come here to find?

372
00:44:00,490 --> 00:44:03,090
Just, I didn't come here to take anything.

373
00:44:03,090 --> 00:44:05,210
My belongings.

374
00:44:13,570 --> 00:44:14,800
Don't move.

375
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,830
Put your hands up.

376
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:21,230
All I need to do is raise my hands?

377
00:44:21,230 --> 00:44:25,610
Don't move. Put that book on the floor.

378
00:44:36,130 --> 00:44:38,000
I don't want to.

379
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:49,420
I'm different from Lieutenant Gong.

380
00:46:31,350 --> 00:46:33,870
I almost got caught, really.

381
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:39,650
Thank you, Doctor.

382
00:46:39,650 --> 00:46:41,530
Quiet.

383
00:46:42,590 --> 00:46:44,780
Close it quietly.

384
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:59,660
Bandages.. I took out some bandages.

385
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:01,660
I'm hurt.

386
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:18,120
-Yes. 
 -Do Jeong Wu.

387
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:19,890
Have you not found Do Jeong Wu yet?

388
00:47:19,890 --> 00:47:23,500
We're doing our best to find him, so please wait a little bit.

389
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:26,420
What on earth are you doing, that you can't catch one measly policeman?!

390
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:28,600
Please choose your words carefully.

391
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:32,110
I'm not someone you can speak to so carelessly, Mr. Son.

392
00:47:32,110 --> 00:47:36,470
And, if you keep calling me like this, it puts me in a difficult position. I'll be hanging up then.

393
00:47:37,670 --> 00:47:39,830
Hey!

394
00:47:43,290 --> 00:47:44,890
Chairman.

395
00:47:44,890 --> 00:47:47,350
Will you not go away?

396
00:47:47,350 --> 00:47:49,970
Chairman, calm down please.

397
00:47:49,970 --> 00:47:51,530
Please calm down, Chairman

398
00:47:51,530 --> 00:47:53,120
Chairman!

399
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:55,220
Chairman.

400
00:47:59,650 --> 00:48:01,300
Are you alright?

401
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:03,830
Would I be alright?

402
00:48:03,830 --> 00:48:06,260
It seems that the wound is quite deep.

403
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:10,000
What, are you worrying about me? Or are you being sarcastic?

404
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:15,880
What are you doing? Hey.

405
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:18,820
You can't run away anymore now.

406
00:48:20,150 --> 00:48:24,950
There's something I wanted to ask you. Why didn't you kill Son Min Ho?

407
00:48:24,950 --> 00:48:26,380
What are you trying to find out from him?

408
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:28,560
Hm, as expected you're quite smart, Doctor.

409
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:30,850
Won't you find out naturally when the time comes?

410
00:48:30,850 --> 00:48:32,420
There's more than the forewarned murders, isn't there?

411
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:34,360
I don't understand.

412
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:38,190
The person who was able to fix my brain disease, why couldn't he fix his own?

413
00:48:38,190 --> 00:48:40,540
Why did you choose terminally illness instead?

414
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:43,750
Ah, there's too many questions coming from both sides!

415
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:46,540
Maybe I think of myself as someone who shouldn't live.

416
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:47,860
If not,

417
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:52,070
maybe there is something which I must not forget?

418
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:59,320
What exactly is your real goal?

419
00:49:00,530 --> 00:49:05,980
Doctor, what happened at the White Night Village 28 years ago,

420
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:08,490
do you really want to know?

421
00:49:08,490 --> 00:49:13,090
Are you curious about who you really are?

422
00:49:16,630 --> 00:49:21,960
If you give me just 5 minutes, the next time we meet I'll tell you the entire truth.

423
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:24,290
Just 5 minutes, nothing more, nothing less.

424
00:49:24,290 --> 00:49:28,600
Why should I? I could just catch you now and ask.

425
00:49:39,550 --> 00:49:41,160
5 minutes.

426
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:43,760
What exactly would 5 minutes do-

427
00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:46,370
From now, 5 minutes.

428
00:49:46,370 --> 00:49:50,320
What are you doing right now? Release these quickly!

429
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:52,390
Help me, Doctor.

430
00:49:53,770 --> 00:49:55,520
Release these now!

431
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:58,420
What do you want to do?

432
00:49:58,420 --> 00:50:02,800
Release these quickly. Release my hands now!

433
00:50:03,910 --> 00:50:04,920
Deal.

434
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:07,030
Doctor!

435
00:50:10,490 --> 00:50:13,190
Doctor, undo these please.

436
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:19,290
What are you doing?

437
00:50:19,290 --> 00:50:21,390
4 minutes, 45 seconds.

438
00:50:21,390 --> 00:50:25,270
See you very soon.

439
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:36,650
Doctor. Release these right this moment.

440
00:50:36,650 --> 00:50:39,890
Wait 3 minutes, 57 seconds.

441
00:50:39,890 --> 00:50:42,940
It'd be good for you to make up your mind within that time.

442
00:50:42,940 --> 00:50:43,930
What about my feelings?

443
00:50:43,930 --> 00:50:47,820
If I release these handcuffs, decide whether you'll go catch Staff Captain Do,

444
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:51,940
or if you're going to treat his wounds.

445
00:50:54,060 --> 00:50:58,010
What Staff Captain Do probably wanted were the glasses which he took.

446
00:50:58,010 --> 00:51:01,090
But, since we're here he probably pretended it was the book in the moment.

447
00:51:01,090 --> 00:51:02,090
Misdirection.

448
00:51:02,090 --> 00:51:05,990
And, he offered me a deal.

449
00:51:07,010 --> 00:51:11,130
It'll work for me, but for you

450
00:51:11,130 --> 00:51:13,560
it won't work.

451
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:35,270
How many people has the Foundation planted?

452
00:51:35,270 --> 00:51:39,340
They're everywhere and nowhere.

453
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:41,040
Is that so?

454
00:51:57,800 --> 00:51:59,850
What is this person?

455
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:06,320
I'm going out.

456
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:10,490
Why are you going out so late? Seriously... Hye Won, too.

457
00:53:10,490 --> 00:53:13,450
Is it difficult for Gongs to be normal?

458
00:53:13,450 --> 00:53:15,120
Like, going out in the morning and coming back in the evening?

459
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:16,340
I'm going!

460
00:53:16,340 --> 00:53:18,360
I don't know if the buses are still running.

461
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:21,030
Be careful!

462
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:13,710
When did this video come?

463
00:54:13,710 --> 00:54:16,020
Why is Nam Wu Cheon...

464
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:23,550
 Do you know why Team Leader sent those forewarning notices?

465
00:54:23,550 --> 00:54:27,610
 Did he only send notices? He sent field footage, too.

466
00:54:29,930 --> 00:54:32,500
So Nam Wu Cheon wasn't just a simple arsonist

467
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:36,020
but the fifth victim of the forewarned murders?

468
00:54:36,020 --> 00:54:38,620
 He used you, Reporter Lee Ji Wuk.

469
00:54:38,620 --> 00:54:42,110
 So that he could manipulate public sentiment and approach Son Min Ho.

470
00:54:42,110 --> 00:54:45,510
Do Jeong Wu was targeting Son Min Ho...

471
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:49,120
Your mail is here.

472
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:50,680
Yes.

473
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:54,430
What is this now?

474
00:55:13,580 --> 00:55:17,890
The Director of Seoul Hangang Hospital, Lee Byeong Seon?

475
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:27,470
What is he doing?

476
00:55:38,890 --> 00:55:42,190
What? Is he dying again?

477
00:55:45,690 --> 00:55:50,150
 A new video of the final moment... It's not over yet.

478
00:56:02,450 --> 00:56:04,680
What the heck?

479
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:06,620
Who is it?

480
00:56:13,540 --> 00:56:16,220
This crazy...

481
00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:18,490
Jeong Wu, Jeong Wu!

482
00:56:18,490 --> 00:56:20,590
Jeong Wu!

483
00:59:32,610 --> 00:59:39,550

484
00:59:40,750 --> 00:59:43,710
 Awaken

485
00:59:43,710 --> 00:59:46,400
 What did he want to do, if it's not over yet?

486
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:48,430
 You still don't know Staff Captain Do's whereabouts, do you?

487
00:59:48,430 --> 00:59:50,680
 There were people trying to kill the Team Leader in the hospital.

488
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:52,620
 I'm certain that he is in danger.

489
00:59:52,620 --> 00:59:55,060
 Did he really kill? Will he really die?

490
00:59:55,060 --> 00:59:59,490
 Whether the person dies now or later, saving life comes first, doesn't it?

491
00:59:59,490 --> 01:00:01,660
  It was too similar to the latest serial murder.

492
01:00:01,660 --> 01:00:03,730
 That's how I knew, that those kids have returned.

493
01:00:03,730 --> 01:00:06,590
  You know, too, don't you? That you're the most special?

494
01:00:06,590 --> 01:00:11,850
 We need to find the last child left. That third child will be the culprit.
