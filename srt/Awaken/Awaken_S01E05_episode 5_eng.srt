1
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:08,980

2
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:38,980
 Awaken

3
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,360
This is arson.

4
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,800
Even if the firetrucks came in late, a fire which burned at this rate—

5
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:50,010
So a flammable substance was used.

6
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:52,190
It looks like gasoline.

7
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:59,220
 The first step is fear.

8
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:03,530
 "The first step is fear."

9
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:05,640
  It was our first conversation.

10
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:08,550
 Come to me quickly.

11
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:14,380
 I did it because I wanted to see you smile.

12
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:23,100
 I didn't know until long after that day passed

13
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:25,000
  that I had learned from this man

14
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,900
 the fear of being left alone in the world

15
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:33,910
 Awaken

16
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:36,550
I am at the site of the fire acident in Yangwu City which began early this morning. 
  - Episode 5 -

17
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:39,600
 Due to the late arrival of the fire trucks that were impeded by illegally parked cars

18
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,380
 and the incompetence of the police of the nearby precinct

19
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:46,410
 an appalling man-made disaster has occurred. So far, five people have died—

20
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:48,250
So, who is at the crime scene right now?

21
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,560
Gong Hye Won, sir.

22
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:53,780
That child is managing the scene in this kind of situation?

23
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:57,230
Out of everyone left in the Special Team, she has the most field experience.

24
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:59,330
We can't get in contact with Doctor Jamie

25
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:01,030
and Do Jeong Wu is...

26
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,400
But still, she's too young.

27
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,200
Do you think she will be able to control the field?

28
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:12,070
 I got this from the architect.

29
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:14,620
 It's the actual floor plan that was not submitted to the borough office.

30
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,700
 There is an area that looks like it was illegally constructed.

31
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:24,800
This area right here?

32
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,480
Location-wise, it should be about there.

33
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,060
Please go in there directly.

34
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,730
That would be useless.

35
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:31,130
This is a vault.

36
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:33,460
A vault like this usually has no ventilation.

37
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:36,050
Gold or money doesn't need to breathe.

38
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:37,910
I'll be the one to decide whether it is useful or not.

39
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:39,640
A person was seen on the second floor.

40
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,230
And they can only go to this area by going to the first floor.

41
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,200
I'll also be deciding that.

42
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:46,430
To be blunt, if somehow we did get into this area,

43
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:47,310
they would have suffocated already—

44
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,660
That will also be determined by me.

45
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,700
There is a sequence to handling fire sites!

46
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,410
If we are not careful, the cause of the fire can completely disappear.

47
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:54,750
Look here, Lieutenant Gong!

48
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,000
Lieutenant Gong!

49
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:29,560
Do you have anything else to say?

50
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,900
If you do, I'm thinking of destroying that, too.

51
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,600
Move!

52
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,750
 Gong Hye Won's field control...

53
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:39,950
 I'm worried that there will be too much.

54
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,900
 Since Do Jeong Wu ruined all her manners.

55
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,900
Doctor Jamie is the real problem.

56
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,290
I tried to find her

57
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:50,790
but why did she disappear? It doesn't make sense to me.

58
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,400
Are you sure she didn't go into the building on fire?

59
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,200
Lee Ji Wuk began broadcasting the fire as soon as it began.

60
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,620
Do Jeong Wu is the crazy one.

61
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:03,050
No one could go in until the Fire Department entered.

62
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:04,150
Lee Ji Wuk, that bastard.

63
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:06,810
He's only helpful in unnecessary situations.

64
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,610
Come in.

65
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,200
At the fire site, we just discovered and are opening a vault.

66
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,610
- A vault? 
 - It appears to have been illegally constructed.

67
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:31,720
It's big enough for a person to go in it.

68
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,000
This is not where I should be. I should go to the scene of the fire personally.

69
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:37,600
This is not a matter for you to be personally present at.

70
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,600
My kid is there, under that hot burning fire.

71
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,190
No matter how crazy Do Jeong Wu is,

72
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:44,420
he's not the type to jump into a fire without any reason!

73
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:48,950
Exactly.  If you move, the fact that Do Jeong Wu is a police officer will be revealed

74
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,730
and questions like "why were the police keeping an eye on that house?"

75
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:53,100
will be asked by people.

76
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:59,750
Uh, the scene can be viewed from here.

77
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:00,530
What are you saying?

78
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:02,830
The opening of the safe is being broadcast live.

79
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,520
In great detail.

80
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,000
 On your screen right now,

81
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,480
 the police are currently rescuing those who are expected to be inside this house.

82
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:13,130
 Inside the area of the house which is estimated to be a vault—

83
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:15,830
Lee Ji Wuk, that bastard.

84
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:19,620
 We are currently worried if any of them are still alive.

85
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,630
I'm telling you again.

86
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:26,720
It's not as if there was any ventilation indicated in the floor plan.

87
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,620
Even if someone escaped the fire by going in there, in a space this small, they could not have lasted for several hours.

88
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:33,200
Please don't say anything. Nothing at all.

89
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,900
We don't know what it's going to look like inside. Leave it to the specialists.

90
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:21,390
 010-535-2258
 Breaking News: Fire in Samwonho-dong

91
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:33,000
It opened! Are you alright?

92
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,590
There is a survivor!

93
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:37,170
- Call the medic! 
 - Is he alright?

94
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:40,290
Hurry hurry!

95
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:42,820
 Because it has been nine hours—

96
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:46,670
 At this moment, someone is coming out of the building.

97
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:50,610
 As we check from the screen, there is one, maybe two people?

98
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:53,410
 Survivors are starting to come out.

99
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:28,430
 At least four survivors are being rescued.

100
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:31,060
 This is like a miracle.

101
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:34,100
Thank you, thank you.

102
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:44,430
But why am I watching that jerk's broadcast?

103
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:47,060
What are our people doing?

104
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:49,260
Are you going to keep working this way?

105
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:51,280
Get out.

106
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,860
This boy, yes, of course.

107
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:10,160
That's right.

108
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,720
I mean, even if you tried to kill him, there's no way he would die.

109
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:16,560
Ah, Do Jeong Wu, this boy.

110
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:21,540
This boy, he made me worry for nothing.

111
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:23,870
This cute bastard.

112
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:25,860
This is an inspiring moment.

113
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:28,830
The survivors who endured this long night of calamity

114
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:32,020
are currently being transported to the hospital right now.

115
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:34,280
There has been no official announcement yet.

116
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:37,640
We journalists will continue to be your eyes and feet

117
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:41,360
and do our best to report to you accurate news as quickly as we can.

118
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:51,450
As you can see, the police are now in complete control of the accident site.

119
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:56,820
It doesn't appear that we will get a full assessment of the situation until the police make an official announcement.

120
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,600
Please don't move. Lie back down, please.

121
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:23,630
Security! Hold still.

122
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:50,520
I told you to handle her carefully.

123
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:02,650
Why tie up her hands and feet, when you don't know who she is?

124
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:05,910
Just be glad that she is under medication now.

125
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,780
Doctor, please find Inspector Gong Hye Won.

126
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:19,400
 There is a memory unknown to me.

127
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:23,300
 It feels like Staff Captain Do is similar to me.

128
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,630
 I can do anything.

129
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:30,500
 I can also do nothing.

130
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:34,610
 I am from White Night Village.

131
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:41,700
She disappeared?

132
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,980
You don't know either?

133
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:46,700
When I ran into the fire, she was cursing behind me cursing.

134
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:50,000
And after that I don't know.

135
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,900
What happened here?

136
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:56,000
Seriously, what kind of a mess is this?

137
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,600
Does that hurt?

138
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,500
Yes, it does.

139
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:24,620
Reporter Lee, you did it again.

140
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,960
The righteous person jumping into an exploding fire.

141
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
The humanity of looking back is so touching.  So touching.

142
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,600
We'll definitely get at least drama from this.

143
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,500
So try making a movie out of it.

144
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,800
They're having fun.

145
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:50,560
I have confirmed the situation. Heading down now.

146
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,200
It's this person, right? Room 510.

147
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,210
He's so cool.

148
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:59,500
That old saying that good character comes from a good face is correct.

149
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,750
He's my ideal type.

150
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:11,260
One moment. Where are you going?

151
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,570
Why do I need to answer that?

152
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:14,450
I'm sorry, but this is a restricted area.

153
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:17,430
Restricted? Who? Why? With what authority?

154
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,600
- Please leave. 
 - No, I can't do that.

155
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:22,060
Aren't you letting go?

156
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:25,300
Look at this. You guys are really ...

157
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,020
Hey, you bastards!

158
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:30,080
What are you guys that you can control public places?

159
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:33,490
What organization are you from? Wow. Aren't you letting go?

160
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:36,100
Are you guys police or prosecution? Hey, right now—

161
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,400
Over here. I know him.

162
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:41,070
He came to meet me. Come here.

163
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:42,630
Do you even know who I am?

164
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:44,990
- Hi. 
 - Hello.

165
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:54,220
Wow, a private room with bodyguards.

166
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:56,800
Enjoying luxuries far beyond what you deserve, huh?

167
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,500
Help me with this, please.

168
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:04,790
I mean, I did such a big thing.

169
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:08,190
I jumped into a fire, after all.

170
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:13,030
Of course, they could be locking me up, too.

171
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:16,270
The police haven't been able to figure out what their position on their issue is, yet.

172
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:17,850
When I saw it, it looked like they did.

173
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:20,630
You seem like you know more about the internal affairs of the police than I do.

174
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:25,200
That's why you should use a good intelligence source.

175
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:28,700
What is that? Are you going to at least share this information?

176
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,020
Even I don't know who it is but I'm certain of one thing.

177
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:36,360
It's not your average crazy bastard.

178
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:39,300
Here, this is the information I received two days ago

179
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,930
and this is what I got from your police station's scrap paper pile.  (used paper set aside to be reused)

180
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:43,590
If you want scrap paper from the police station, you should have asked me.

181
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,200
I could get them for you.

182
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:50,300
Not the text, look at the paper.

183
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:54,960
Look, do you see it?

184
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,120
Yeah, I do.

185
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,380
They were printed using the same printer.

186
00:15:58,380 --> 00:15:59,500
Do you know what I'm saying?

187
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,300
The person who interpreted and sent me the coded message

188
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,820
is from your team.

189
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:36,300
Are my eyes crazy?

190
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,900
Why was I crying in that situation?

191
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:41,850
Let's say that could happen when I thought he was dead.

192
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:44,420
But he's alive now, so it's fine.

193
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,190
I'm not this kind of person.

194
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:50,980
I'm so chic, so why... what is this?

195
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:01,530
What is it?

196
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:04,290
Why are you doing this?

197
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:05,700
When you work a long time,

198
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,790
there are times where you think you are right and move on.

199
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:10,760
If I had done that this time, there would have been no survivors.

200
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:12,770
Thank you.

201
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:16,680
Well, I didn't do that because I knew anything. I just got lucky—

202
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:19,260
There is no luck at a fire.

203
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:23,290
People may lie, but a fire never will.

204
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:25,490
When I thought about the size of that vault,

205
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:28,370
even if people took shelter in it, the chances of surviving were 0%.

206
00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:29,900
But not only were survivors there, there were four of them.

207
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:32,060
It really is unbelievable.

208
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:34,010
But they were actually alive.

209
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:35,890
That's why I am saying it is a miracle.

210
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:39,000
A fire expert would not breakdown any structure that deep into the building.

211
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,600
Because they would not expect that any survivors would be there, and they would have failed to save precious survivors.

212
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:46,800
I just believed that, without thinking about it.

213
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:51,680
I believed that Team Leader would not dive into certain death, even if the skies were to fall.

214
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,160
Once you reach this age

215
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:56,830
you realize that even your intuition is ultimately calculation.

216
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:00,950
It's not one of my team members.

217
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:02,330
You believe that?

218
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:04,390
No, I know.

219
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:07,570
Yeah, I also thought it wasn't one of your team members.

220
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:10,720
Because Do Jeong Wu is religion to them.

221
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,990
But, there is one more person.

222
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:17,170
That FBI psychologist or whatever from America.

223
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:19,430
I know that you, Reporter Lee Ji Wuk

224
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:22,720
are a praiseworthy journalist. But aren't you having delusions of grandeur?

225
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,000
Why would such a smart person like her be solving this code for some Korean reporter?

226
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,500
Because she's the criminal.

227
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:30,610
You're saying Dr. Jamie is the criminal?

228
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:33,670
Should I show you something even weirder?

229
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,380
Here.

230
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:40,960
The person who sent the murder notice is from your team.

231
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,620
The person who interpreted and sent me the coded message is also from your team.

232
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:46,120
What do you think? Is this enough now to cause you some doubt?

233
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,710
Does Dr. Jamie really seem like the criminal type?

234
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:51,390
I looked into the time period when she obtained U.S. citizenship.

235
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:54,990
But coincidentally, it was immediately after the White Night Village incident.

236
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:56,610
So I imagined this.

237
00:18:56,610 --> 00:19:01,430
What if one child from that village went

238
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:03,210
to America?

239
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:08,580
A lie that one doesn't know they're telling is hard for other people to find out

240
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:11,020
Dissociative Identity Disorder. Multiple personalities.

241
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:13,500
They say she is cured, but who can be sure?

242
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:17,000
Problems of the head don't heal so easily.

243
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,770
 I am alone in a street with no one around.

244
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:43,060
 The sun is shining whitely

245
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:45,430
 The clock which is never wrong

246
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:47,860
 indicates it is midnight.

247
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:49,620
 I wonder now

248
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:52,960
 whether it is daytime

249
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:56,870
 or night?

250
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,640
So if you add all this up together

251
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:08,490
one of the survivors of White Night Village

252
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:11,790
planned all of these incidents for the purpose of revenge.

253
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:13,290
And that is Jamie Leighton.

254
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:16,520
To be more precise, it is one of her personalities.

255
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:20,450
One of her personalities is the criminal, the other is an investigative consultant.

256
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:23,630
How about it? Doesn't that fit perfectly?

257
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:30,720
A novice arsonist gets burned because he doesn't know how to handle a fire.

258
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,090
It may sound obvious, but they usually burn their hands

259
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:34,830
and the front part of their body.

260
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:38,370
This fire spread in a more explosive way than expected.

261
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:42,600
Based on the CCTV, Nam Wu Cheon exited that villa at about 9 p.m.

262
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,850
If he was in the villa at the time of the fire, that means he snuck back into the villa.

263
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:49,340
According to what Do Jeong Wu told us, Son Min Ho and the maid, Ju Hyeon Hui were found on the second floor

264
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:51,360
and Nam Wu Cheon was found on the first floor.

265
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,860
Seeing how the entire building was burned up—

266
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,760
The fire definitely began on the first floor.

267
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:58,040
A fire travels to where oxygen flows, or it travels upwards.

268
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:01,590
When the fire is ignited on the second floor, it's not easy for the entire building to burn down even when it's arson.

269
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:05,190
So Nam Wu Cheon is the arsonist. What's the problem?

270
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:08,510
The entire nation has its eyes on this case.

271
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:11,420
If there was no culprit, we'd practically have to make one up.

272
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:14,530
But we have such a definite culprit, so why the delay? Why?

273
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:17,000
The problem is that the fire burned his arm, his upper body,

274
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,120
then his face, then it passed by.

275
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:23,230
Do you understand what that means?

276
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:25,220
What does it mean?

277
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:27,400
That means he did not set the fire.

278
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,940
No matter what a novice he was at arson, or how little he understood fire,

279
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:31,960
everyone has self-preservation instincts.

280
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:35,170
 This is instinct. Perhaps I should say reflex?

281
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:37,660
Even if he has no reflex at all,

282
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:41,500
when a fire is burning, if one is human, before they feel the heat,

283
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:44,440
they should at least make this type of gesture to block it.

284
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,400
But Nam Wu Cheon didn't have that reaction.

285
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,630
Actually, he did, but it was too late.

286
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:52,840
It seems that he only tried to block the fire after his body began to burn.

287
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,720
But this doesn't make any sense at all.

288
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:59,190
Because that would mean that he did not realize it was hot while he was setting the fire.

289
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:02,140
So Nam Wu Cheon isn't the one who set this fire?

290
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:04,240
It's not possible.

291
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:10,830
September 14th, at about 2 a.m., in Yangwu City, Samwonho-dong, there was a fire.

292
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,720
This is our briefing regarding that incident.

293
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,290
At this time, the police fire investigation team, the forensic team,

294
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:19,320
the fire department officials, the safety officers of gas and electric utilities,

295
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:22,200
and other related organizations are in the midst of analyzing this fire.

296
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,580
The police currently believe that it was caused by arson

297
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:27,690
and Nam Wu Cheon is believed to be the suspect.

298
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:29,730
The biographical information of the suspect?

299
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:31,710
Once he regains consciousness

300
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:35,660
we plan to investigation the motive and methods for his crime.

301
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:37,140
Until that time,

302
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:39,680
we ask that you refrain from speculating

303
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,050
that this case is a one of a series in a serial murder case.

304
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:43,760
Is this related to the White Night Village incident?

305
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,140
The important thing

306
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:48,470
is that damage and loss of human life was avoided to this extent

307
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:52,710
due to the brave actions of a police officer.

308
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:55,460
Even when his life was at risk due to this tire,

309
00:22:55,460 --> 00:23:00,000
Staff Captain Do Jeong Wu ran into the fire site without any personal protective equipment.

310
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,280
Due to conditions on the road, the fire department could not reach the fire site,

311
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,360
and he ran directly into the fire

312
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:07,460
and due to his smart decision, he was able to rescue several survivors

313
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:10,160
and evacuate them to a vault located in the basement of the building.

314
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:15,730
Staff Captain Do Jeong Wu is also the police officer who solved the case of serial bank robberies back in August—

315
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,540
Dissociative Identity Disorder.

316
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:21,710
Are you saying Doctor Jamie is the culprit?

317
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:23,020
I didn't say that.

318
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:26,150
Why aren't you?  It's reasonable.

319
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:28,910
Team Leader, could a person with Dissociative Identity Disorder

320
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:33,350
really be unable to remember what she did?

321
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:35,250
But this is not a drama.

322
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:37,380
There are completely different personalities.

323
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:41,780
The human brain is complex but its functioning is simple. It's possible to turn the switch on and off.

324
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:43,220
That doesn't apply to me.

325
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:46,000
- That's because your switch is always off. 
 - No, it's not!

326
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,100
Even if she has Dissociative Identity Disorder, even if she was feeding information to Lee Ji Wuk,

327
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:54,500
even if she was sending the forewarning notices, it's not evidence that she is the killer.

328
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,590
The motive is vague and more important

329
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:58,630
we can't specify the MO ( modus operandi, the way the crime is being committed )

330
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:02,370
Yeah, that's what I say. His switch is on!

331
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:06,650
Wow. But although we haven't known her for very long,

332
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:08,980
she suddenly disappeared. Aren't you worried about her?

333
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,550
But I am really worried.

334
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:13,830
She's not injured, is she? Hopefully not, right?

335
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:17,420
Well anyway, Nam Wu Cheon has something in common with the victims in our case.

336
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:20,360
He assisted Son Min Ho to do some terrible things.

337
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,210
And he apparently doesn't have self-preservation instinct.

338
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:24,090
Although he set a fire instead of committing suicide.

339
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:26,180
No, so whether by suicide or arson,

340
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:29,530
the issue is, how can anyone make these people act this way?

341
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:35,100
- If it's Dr. Jamie, maybe she can do it? 
 - How?

342
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:39,020
If she was the killer, and think about the time when she disappeared.

343
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:41,010
She was head of the FBI's behavioral analysis team.

344
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:43,380
Team Leader, aren't there these types of things?

345
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:46,400
Psychological phenomena we don't understand?

346
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:51,500
You know, dominating someone's mind? Black magic ...

347
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:57,160
So what I mean is,

348
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:00,440
maybe she used magic...

349
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:03,890
she could have used magic... so what I mean is...

350
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,700
 There can be problems with the child's amygdala.  We need to stop.

351
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:14,970
 These kids have a minimum IQ of 200.  Are you saying that's a problem?

352
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:17,160
 These children are committing suicide because they cannot endure this anymore.

353
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:20,900
 When you see a dog or a cat, how do you feel? You feel like you can communicate with them, don't you? Like they were human?

354
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:23,510
 These children are probably feeling that way as they look at us.

355
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:26,240
 How high is your IQ? 110? 120?

356
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:29,850
 Don't think of them as children. They are already monsters.

357
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:33,530
 They are all crazy. After stabbing themselves they jump from high above.

358
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,700
 Then they die while smiling. What's going on? What am I supposed to do?

359
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:41,410
 What is going on here?

360
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:12,910
Let go of me.

361
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,100
- Will he survive? 
 - I can't say. Even if he survives, he probably can't provide testimony.

362
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:54,900
 Team Leader, you like me, don't you?

363
00:26:56,250 --> 00:27:00,690
 While I was with Lee Ji Wuk, you phoned because you were worried I might be drunk.

364
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:03,770
And, you can't date that guy.

365
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:08,040
Date someone else. Make it be someone you can rely on.

366
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:11,620
And don't like me. I have no interest in you.

367
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:19,540
What are you talking about?

368
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:22,560
Couldn't you hear? Must I translate it?

369
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:26,600
Did I tell you right now without knowing that I liked you?

370
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:29,700
It's not something you have to tell me to know.

371
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:33,030
So just now, even though I didn't confess, I got rejected?

372
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:37,550
Maybe you should transfer to another team.  I'll find you one.

373
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:40,900
Now ...

374
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:46,800
After saving a dying person, another team?  Did you say you're transferring me to another team?

375
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:49,990
I just said it because it would be better for you.

376
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:51,020
You're weird.

377
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:53,970
Usually when you've been on the verge of death, you realize truths you didn't realize before.

378
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:55,830
Isn't that normal?

379
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:58,550
Did you lose what little intelligence you had in the fire?!

380
00:27:58,550 --> 00:28:02,010
How can you be thinking of ways to get rid of me as soon as you wake up?!

381
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:03,580
I...

382
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:07,160
I... worried about you so much.

383
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,560
Have I ever told you that I like you?

384
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,850
Not that I like you.

385
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:26,440
Even if I like you, although I would never like you,

386
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,900
but even if there was a one in a million chance that I do,

387
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:30,830
I've never asked you to do anything about it, did I?

388
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:34,400
So I have my own feelings, why would you have to tell me who I should date,

389
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,970
or go to another team...

390
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:37,080
Another team?

391
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,800
Are you serious? Really?

392
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,690
You're a human, so why do you say such dog crap?

393
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:42,590
See what happens if you send me to another team.

394
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:45,320
I will find every reason I can and report you to the internal investigation team.

395
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:48,530
There are tons of things I know about you!

396
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:05,200
Oh, you can't walk around like this.

397
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,740
You might feel okay,

398
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:10,980
but you could still be affected by being exposed to the toxic gas.

399
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:12,670
Hold on a moment.

400
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:17,800
Head to the ICU.

401
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:24,370
Patient, are you uncomfortable anywhere?

402
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:29,710
 When is the doctor coming?

403
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:39,050
Patient, are you okay?

404
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:41,250
Patient, are you in a lot of pain?

405
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:44,620
Please administer 5 mg of morphine.

406
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:52,230
We've administered a sedative, so you will feel better soon.

407
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:07,630
Are you alright, Patient?

408
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:08,590
Patient!

409
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:10,850
His vitals are rising.

410
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:11,720
Patient?

411
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,170
Patient, please come to your senses.

412
00:30:13,170 --> 00:30:15,980
Clear his airway and prepare for  intubation at  with 7.5 mm tube.

413
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,770
Patient?

414
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,660
Prepare defibrillation.

415
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:31,890
Please administer 1 mg of epinephrine by IV.

416
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:18,600
What?

417
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:24,370
He's just leaving?!

418
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,720
Who did you learn to drive from?

419
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,980
Are you dying to cause an accident?

420
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:43,060
The hospital is the perfect place for accidents!

421
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:46,460
There are tons of doctors in a 100-meter vicinity. What's the worry?

422
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:48,500
Seriously. I'm already in a bad mood...

423
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:51,080
Are you going to keep being argumentative?

424
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:54,980
You're curious about this, aren't you?

425
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,050
Follow me.

426
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:07,590
Where are all the guards?

427
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:10,360
It was like a scene out of a movie only a few minutes ago.

428
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,400
I don't know.

429
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,690
To be honest, it's going a little overboard.

430
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:15,700
It looked like something important was going on.

431
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,800
I love it when someone looks special.

432
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,800
I'll be back.

433
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:49,320
I heard that you handed over Dr. Jamie's files to Team Leader.

434
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,800
You weren't suspecting Dr. Jamie?

435
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:54,550
He told you that already?

436
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:56,900
He's the god of gossip.

437
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:00,000
Go ask the Team...

438
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,600
Leader yourself. Instead of acting like this with me.

439
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:10,170
You want me to show this to Do Jeong Wu? This? Really?

440
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:14,700
If this wasn't edited, it would make Do Jeong Wu the culprit or at least an accomplice.

441
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:18,800
Are you sure that he isn't? Do you trust him that much?

442
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:22,700
  To me, Chief Do doesn't look like he's at risk.

443
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,360
 Just dangerous.

444
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:26,060
If it were me, I wouldn't feel that way.

445
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:30,250
Because one person can never truly know another person.

446
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:08,550
 Who are you?!

447
00:34:21,410 --> 00:34:23,170
Are you okay? Please don't touch it.

448
00:34:23,170 --> 00:34:24,380
Please don't touch it.

449
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:25,860
I'll stop the bleeding before the doctor gets here.

450
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:27,180
before the doctor gets here.

451
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:28,440
 Please hurry!

452
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,810
 Are you okay?

453
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:33,300
- Did you call the doctor? 
 - Yes, hell be here soon.

454
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:35,930
 Please don't move.

455
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,370
Please.

456
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:40,580
I'm here for a quick inspection.

457
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:46,360
Why is it so dark? Is this a hotel or something?

458
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:58,400
Is this a hotel or something?

459
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:24,780
There's nothing here.

460
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:40,980
What is this?

461
00:36:55,910 --> 00:36:58,720
 KP Personality and Aptitude Test Analysis

462
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:38,470
 In the case of the Personality and Aptitude Test,

463
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:40,740
  we repeat the same question but worded a little differently

464
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:44,390
 in order to understand the examiner's way of thinking.

465
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:48,900
 If the examiner is normal, the answers are slightly different even for the same question.

466
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:52,410
 During an hour and forty minutes of test, on average,

467
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:56,550
 an examiner gives conflicting answers at least three to five times.

468
00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:59,170
 But Do Jeong Wu is...

469
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:42,620
 KP Personality and Aptitude Test Analysis

470
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:47,160
The fact that he can give perfect answers on the Personality and Aptitude Test means that

471
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:49,340
he memorized all the answers, right?

472
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:52,670
His answers matched the questions perfectly.

473
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:55,500
So then?

474
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:59,200
It could be one of the two, or it could be neither,

475
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:01,880
or maybe it could be both.

476
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:05,640
Then it means this test means nothing!

477
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:08,130
Everything is a wrong with you,

478
00:39:08,130 --> 00:39:10,100
but the worst is that you're stupid.

479
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:11,050
I'm going.

480
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:15,300
What? You're done after telling me I'm stupid? Hyung! Hey!

481
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,090
What is he...

482
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:22,500
It could be one of the two, or it could be neither,

483
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,730
or it could be both? What does that mean?

484
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:28,360
I must be stupid. Really dumb.

485
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:40,840
 We don't know. Life is full of things we can't comprehend.

486
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:44,200
You never know with life, but if it is forensic medicine, isn't that an exception?

487
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:46,950
Where Song Min Ho was stabbed is definitely

488
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:48,680
an area where there wouldn't be much damage to major organs

489
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,890
and where you could stab yourself.

490
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:53,360
But, unless it's in the middle of their back,

491
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,530
people can cut themselves on any area of the body,

492
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,700
as long as you have the courage to do it.

493
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,890
Of course, we can think of it this way.

494
00:40:00,890 --> 00:40:02,540
Song Min Ho is 176 cm tall,

495
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:04,790
estimated arm length is 66 cm.

496
00:40:04,790 --> 00:40:07,020
The knife is 24 cm.

497
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:11,230
If you stab while holding the knife this way,

498
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:14,370
there is a set angle that it can go in.

499
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:18,000
Therefore, a skilled autopsy doctor can tell

500
00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:20,530
very easily that he injured himself.

501
00:40:20,530 --> 00:40:24,890
So we can't find out unless Song Min Ho died. Is that right?

502
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:28,300
Right.  If he came to me, I could have found out right away.

503
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:31,120
Surgeons are busy trying to save the patient.

504
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:34,170
There are many things you can tell just by the shape of the wound,

505
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,900
but they can't think about that.

506
00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:39,500
Too bad. There's no way to find out.

507
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,920
There is.

508
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,480
There is.

509
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:48,290
 Not just the fire, but even when there wasn't enough oxygen,

510
00:40:48,290 --> 00:40:51,120
 he didn't give up—

511
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:58,130
What you meant wasn't asking him directly, was it?

512
00:40:58,130 --> 00:41:00,010
I didn't know you were here.

513
00:41:00,010 --> 00:41:02,490
I was about to come to you.

514
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:04,800
I came by, so let's talk here.

515
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:08,500
- Are you now —  
 - That's a good idea. Please sit.

516
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:11,770
I'm happy that the person who saved my life came to visit.

517
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:13,120
That's what they said on the TV.

518
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,860
That you saved my life twice.

519
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:19,290
Yes, that's why I came because I was curious whether I saved you once or twice.

520
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:22,760
The stabbing, did you do it yourself?

521
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:28,940
Why would I do that?

522
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:31,430
It would have been good had it not surfaced,

523
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:36,700
but now that the past incident has come to light, people are tenacious.

524
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:41,960
It probably didn't take long for the public opinion to change from feeling sorry for you into thinking you deserve to die.

525
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:42,980
At times like this,

526
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:47,030
At times like this, the best method is to change the direction of public opinion.

527
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:50,620
Above the image of a conman who took advantage of every citizen,

528
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:55,680
like so, someone whose life is being targeted,

529
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,720
an image of a victim can be overlaid..

530
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:01,430
Since people have a lot of sympathy.

531
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:02,670
Do Jeong Wu!

532
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:05,340
I mean, it's a simple question that he can't seem to answer.

533
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:07,850
The older you get, your body becomes more precious.

534
00:42:07,850 --> 00:42:12,250
I'm not strong enough to do something so scary.

535
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:17,350
I mean, the guards who were here 24/7 until now suddenly disappeared,

536
00:42:17,350 --> 00:42:20,860
and any trace of the invader who came in through the window has vanished into thin air.

537
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:23,890
That a professional who disappeared without leaving any clue from a five-story building

538
00:42:23,890 --> 00:42:27,250
failed to take away your life,

539
00:42:27,890 --> 00:42:30,320
is hard for me to understand.

540
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,590
I see why there could be a misunderstanding.

541
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:35,500
How I feel is that even if there are youngsters who get angry,

542
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:40,400
it's not strange at all.  It looks like they were conned.

543
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:44,230
You may not believe this, but back then, I started doing that in order to do something good.

544
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:46,670
I was wrong, though.

545
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:55,530
After that, I've been living while feeling remorse.

546
00:42:55,530 --> 00:42:56,700
I was young then.

547
00:42:56,700 --> 00:43:00,220
I'm someone who believes that people don't change.

548
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:01,560
I would feel the same way.

549
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:06,260
Even if you have sincerity, it's hard to make someone believe you.

550
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:10,370
But at the right time, I met Reporter Lee.

551
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:14,560
Oh, I hurried here, but I as still late.

552
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:18,030
Oh, hello!

553
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:44,290
 I'll make an offer that won't cause you any loss.

554
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:49,600
Since I'm here, I need to get whatever I can. It's okay, right?

555
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:54,200
You were going to give me an exclusive but did nothing for me anyway.

556
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:57,660
In order to clear any misunderstanding, I've decided to publish my story serially.

557
00:43:57,660 --> 00:43:59,230
Like a serial from old newspapers.

558
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:04,500
What was it called? Portal site? Internet broadcast?

559
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:06,280
Anyway, the world has become so great.

560
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:08,570
If it was the old times, I would have felt wronged and that would have been it.

561
00:44:08,570 --> 00:44:11,970
But I was told that now, I have a chance to explain what kind of a person I am.

562
00:44:11,970 --> 00:44:16,070
But I hear he needs Staff Captain Do's help.

563
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:19,990
Well, first, we need a hero,

564
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:21,970
so please cooperate, huh?

565
00:44:21,970 --> 00:44:23,790
You already filmed a drama it looks like.

566
00:44:23,790 --> 00:44:27,740
 Here is one of the survivors, a housekeeper, who witnessed the scene.

567
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:30,370
 Please listen directly to how tense it was at the time.

568
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:35,800
 To be honest, I didn't think I could depend on the police.

569
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:37,530
 They didn't care.

570
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:42,030
 Staff Captain Do was different.

571
00:44:42,030 --> 00:44:44,760
 He's a true hero.

572
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:47,860
 Chairman!

573
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:51,490
 Chairman! Chairman!

574
00:46:27,870 --> 00:46:29,350
Hey there!

575
00:47:05,070 --> 00:47:07,490
 Sir! Officer, sir!

576
00:47:07,490 --> 00:47:09,640
 Where are you going?

577
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:12,100
 Sir, where...

578
00:47:30,290 --> 00:47:32,750
Didn't you consider the fact that there wasn't any ventilation system in a vault?

579
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:35,230
At that time, you can't think about those things.

580
00:47:35,230 --> 00:47:38,530
I didn't even know that there was a vault there.

581
00:47:38,530 --> 00:47:40,160
How were you able to breathe?

582
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:42,520
According to the professionals, the vault was closed

583
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:45,010
so oxygen would have been lacking.

584
00:47:45,010 --> 00:47:47,330
 It's true.

585
00:47:47,330 --> 00:47:50,770
 I had a hard time breathing.

586
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:08,810
 It's so stifling.

587
00:48:09,450 --> 00:48:11,420
 I can't breathe...

588
00:48:40,350 --> 00:48:43,900
 Sir, Police Officer, what are you doing?

589
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:45,910
 No!

590
00:48:55,550 --> 00:48:59,310
 The victims of the Samwonho-dong incident who avoided the fire

591
00:48:59,310 --> 00:49:02,040
 generated oxygen by using household hydrogen peroxide.

592
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:04,070
 and were able to endure.

593
00:49:04,070 --> 00:49:06,970
 Reporter Kang Joon Lim, how was this possible?

594
00:49:06,970 --> 00:49:10,590
 There's an enzyme in human blood called Catalase.

595
00:49:10,590 --> 00:49:13,420
 It decomposes hydrogen peroxide into water.

596
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:15,460
 At this point, oxygen will be generated.

597
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:20,560
 So you're saying that the police officer who was locked in the vault generated oxygen by using his own blood?

598
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:23,120
 It sounds like something out of a movie.

599
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:24,320
 Yes, that's right.

600
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:28,280
 It may sound like a scene out of a movie, but it really happened.

601
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:37,770
Did you ask if you saved me once or twice?

602
00:49:37,770 --> 00:49:39,540
I would have died in the fire,

603
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:41,460
and I would have died again in that vault.

604
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:44,930
So that would make it twice that you saved me.

605
00:49:44,930 --> 00:49:46,590
Does that answer your question?

606
00:49:46,590 --> 00:49:51,560
So what you're saying that you wouldn't have died from the stabbing.

607
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:55,370
Mr. Son, Reporter Lee, and the guards will be moved to the safety house.

608
00:49:55,370 --> 00:49:57,690
We did announce that Nam Wu Cheon was the culprit,

609
00:49:57,690 --> 00:50:00,140
but according to the data obtained from the consultation office of the Jangeui-dong building,

610
00:50:00,140 --> 00:50:01,710
the actual culprit of this case is someone else.

611
00:50:01,710 --> 00:50:04,490
And there's a high chance that the target was Mr. Son.

612
00:50:04,490 --> 00:50:06,590
We have to protect him.

613
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:10,600
So can the police get actively involved in this case?

614
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:12,630
No. Just you.

615
00:50:12,630 --> 00:50:15,830
Among the officers, only you will guard Mr. Son.

616
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:18,630
W- wait a minute. Team Leader is a patient, too, and the exam--

617
00:50:18,630 --> 00:50:21,260
It's fine. It's an order, so I have to do it.

618
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:24,120
Let's go. I will go.

619
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:25,760
Oh, about the bank robber case.

620
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:28,290
I heard you were pursuing him for a long time.

621
00:50:28,290 --> 00:50:30,830
Couldn't you have warned us ahead of time?

622
00:50:30,830 --> 00:50:32,580
We still have some unrecovered goods.

623
00:50:32,580 --> 00:50:34,140
Even though, we managed to recover a part of it, thankfully.

624
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:37,020
I knew that he was a serial bank robber,

625
00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:42,300
but I had no idea that there would be just one owner of that enormous amount of money. But,

626
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:45,800
you managed to recover a part of it, thankfully. I'll be leaving now.

627
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:54,180
Thanks.

628
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:58,980
Does it have to be him?

629
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:04,200
I realize that he's difficult, but he did save me.

630
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:05,600
It means I can trust him.

631
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:09,200
In order to draw people's interest, there's no one better than him.

632
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:11,360
I can't agree.

633
00:51:12,030 --> 00:51:13,310
Jeez/

634
00:51:13,310 --> 00:51:15,080
What do you mean you can't agree

635
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:19,550
when the police made him into a hero to use him as a shield?

636
00:51:19,550 --> 00:51:23,110
But are you certain that Nam Wu Cheon is the one who started the fire?

637
00:51:23,110 --> 00:51:24,590
According to the circumstances.

638
00:51:24,590 --> 00:51:27,530
Well, the dead don't talk.

639
00:51:27,530 --> 00:51:30,830
There's no reason for Nam Wu Cheon to do that.

640
00:51:30,830 --> 00:51:32,850
Do you believe that?

641
00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:36,340
No.

642
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:39,760
I don't trust people.

643
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:14,160
The surgery went well.

644
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:18,330
These days, there is cutting-edge technology like Cyberknife

645
00:52:18,330 --> 00:52:21,560
so there is no pain and the recovery is quick.

646
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:23,960
The world has become so convenient in many way.

647
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:26,400
Your prognosis is good, so in a few hours,

648
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:29,230
you should be able to move.

649
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:57,520
What are you doing here at this hour?

650
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:58,860
I saw you on TV!

651
00:52:58,860 --> 00:53:02,230
You're quite something!

652
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:06,530
That Mr. Do Jeong Wu, he's the Team Leader, right?

653
00:53:06,530 --> 00:53:08,490
You told me your work wasn't dangerous.

654
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:11,340
The fire isn't dangerous?

655
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:13,900
There's nothing dangerous. I just clean up everything after the fact.

656
00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:18,990
Dad! What are you doing home at 6?

657
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:22,730
Did you finally get sick of research after 37 years?

658
00:53:22,730 --> 00:53:24,880
38 years.

659
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:26,130
You're really sick of it?

660
00:53:26,130 --> 00:53:27,450
What do you mean sick of it?

661
00:53:27,450 --> 00:53:29,660
He's going to go out again after having dinner.

662
00:53:29,660 --> 00:53:33,330
He makes me flustered by acting out of character!

663
00:53:33,330 --> 00:53:35,040
Since when did he eat dinner at home?

664
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:37,100
You're making such a fuss after making him one ramen.

665
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:38,200
Why aren't you eating?

666
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:39,630
She has dinner plans.

667
00:53:39,630 --> 00:53:41,150
Exactly!

668
00:53:41,150 --> 00:53:43,840
If you had called, I would not have scheduled that.

669
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:45,770
Am I someone who just waits at home for you all day?

670
00:53:45,770 --> 00:53:47,200
For 33 years,

671
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:49,790
I've been asking you to discuss things with me before you do them for 33 years,

672
00:53:49,790 --> 00:53:51,620
but you never do!

673
00:53:51,620 --> 00:53:53,740
34 years.

674
00:53:56,130 --> 00:53:57,830
Dad.

675
00:53:57,830 --> 00:54:02,440
Have you ever been in a bind because you couldn't figure someone out?

676
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:06,160
He's not someone who would get frustrated over a person.

677
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:09,640
The other person would probably get frustrated instead because he couldn't figure your dad out.

678
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:11,700
True.

679
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:14,770
- Are you dating? 
 - I'm not dating.

680
00:54:14,770 --> 00:54:16,370
Because he rejected before I ever told him that I like him.

681
00:54:16,370 --> 00:54:18,940
If you got rejected, the best thing to do is completely forget him.

682
00:54:18,940 --> 00:54:20,100
Why bother being concerned about him?

683
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:23,390
I should learn from this so I don't get rejected again.

684
00:54:23,390 --> 00:54:25,370
Just...

685
00:54:27,290 --> 00:54:29,970
the person who I thought I knew,

686
00:54:29,970 --> 00:54:32,580
could he actually be a completely different person?

687
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:35,890
I thought he was a good person,

688
00:54:57,330 --> 00:54:58,810
 but could he not be one?

689
00:54:58,810 --> 00:55:02,770
 Can someone deceive others for such a long time about his true nature?

690
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:07,610
 I'm just curious to know if it's day or night, that is all.

691
00:57:07,610 --> 00:57:10,940
 Is that child me or you, Dr. Jamie?

692
00:57:10,940 --> 00:57:12,780
 So am I supposed to just stand by and watch?

693
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:15,180
 Doctor? Doctor.

694
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:18,500
 Please find Lieutenant Gong Hye Won,

695
00:57:20,890 --> 00:57:22,800
The surgery went well.

696
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:24,300
Your prognosis is good

697
00:57:24,300 --> 00:57:28,180
so in a few hours, you will be able to move.

698
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:57,060
Is there anything going on at the research lab these days?

699
00:58:57,060 --> 00:58:58,800
Something always goes on, every day.

700
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:00,600
That is why I don't get bored.

701
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:04,060
Is there any reason for you to be on TV, Dad?

702
00:59:04,060 --> 00:59:07,130
A big new invention? Or a discovery?

703
00:59:07,130 --> 00:59:10,020
Invention isn't something that a person like me does.

704
00:59:10,020 --> 00:59:11,880
I didn't bring this up to talk about that.

705
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:15,230
I'm wondering what you think about me being on TV.

706
00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:17,400
Of course, I'm proud of you.

707
00:59:18,190 --> 00:59:21,100
Mom just talks that way, but she makes sure to watch whenever you're on TV.

708
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:23,330
Really?

709
00:59:23,330 --> 00:59:26,030
I was just a tag-along for the main story about Team Leader.

710
00:59:26,030 --> 00:59:29,380
And it's not as if I did anything all that praiseworthy.

711
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:37,000
Dad. Dad, you should buy a car. It's about time you had one.

712
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
Should I guy a small car for you?

713
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,660
Do you earn a lot of money?

714
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:42,480
Hey, I've been on TV. Don't you believe me?

715
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:43,680
Don't you believe me?

716
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:45,100
Of course.

717
00:59:45,100 --> 00:59:48,000
I will believe you when you hand me a set of car keys.

718
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,510
Was I a daughter who didn't inspire a lot of faith?

719
00:59:50,510 --> 00:59:51,910
You can know what's beneath deep water,

720
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,100
you never really know a person's heart.

721
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:56,280
You're really making me sad.

722
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:59,310
It's the response to your earlier question.

723
00:59:59,310 --> 01:00:01,120
People never really know each other.

724
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:04,400
So you should trust him as much as you want to.

725
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:08,100
Because a person's heart is not a fixed thing.

726
01:00:08,110 --> 01:00:11,850
And it's not as if you become determined to feel a certain way, that you can really do that.

727
01:00:11,850 --> 01:00:15,710
And everything changes from every decision you make, in every moment.

728
01:00:15,710 --> 01:00:21,930
When they say nothing changes in this world, I don't only think of good things.

729
01:00:21,930 --> 01:00:24,230
Bad things can change, too.

730
01:00:24,230 --> 01:00:25,660
So if you trust in him

731
01:00:25,660 --> 01:00:29,850
even if he was a bad person, he can change and become good.

732
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:51,630
 If you trust in him

733
01:00:51,630 --> 01:00:55,600
 even if he was a bad person, he can change and become good.

734
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:58,100
However I want to believe...

735
01:01:27,770 --> 01:01:28,470
Yes, why?

736
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:31,500
 Team Leader. Dr. Jamie was found.

737
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:33,820
A truck driver found her in the middle of the road

738
01:01:33,820 --> 01:01:34,980
and took her to a police station.

739
01:01:34,980 --> 01:01:36,720
I am going there right now.

740
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:38,000
Alright, got it.

741
01:02:43,050 --> 01:02:45,980
Please drink some of this.

742
01:02:45,980 --> 01:02:48,180
Thank you.

743
01:02:49,190 --> 01:02:50,600
- I'm sorry.
 - It's alright.

744
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:51,920
I'll clean it up.

745
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:53,840
Just a moment.

746
01:03:04,150 --> 01:03:11,290
Using catalase found in blood and combining it with hydrogen peroxide to generate oxygen.

747
01:03:11,290 --> 01:03:12,940
Hydrogen peroxide...

748
01:03:13,910 --> 01:03:14,790
then blood...

749
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:16,870
He used hydrogen peroxide and his own blood

750
01:03:16,870 --> 01:03:17,700
to generate oxygen—

751
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:20,100
How did he think of that?

752
01:03:20,100 --> 01:03:21,960
 If Staff Captain Do Jeong Wu

753
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:25,390
 did not discover the secret vault that only the homeowner and the architect knew about,

754
01:03:25,390 --> 01:03:27,030
 what would have happened?

755
01:03:27,030 --> 01:03:28,280
 Full of flames and smoke,

756
01:03:28,300 --> 01:03:30,700
 in the midst of a fire in which he could not see in front of him,  
- A secret vault?

757
01:03:30,700 --> 01:03:34,800
 It really was a miracle that he found a secret vault.

758
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,690
 What are you looking at so intently?

759
01:03:37,690 --> 01:03:39,880
 Well, it doesn't hurt to be thorough.

760
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:44,100
 I am from White Night Village.

761
01:03:53,210 --> 01:03:54,350
Doctor.

762
01:03:54,350 --> 01:03:55,980
Doctor?

763
01:03:55,980 --> 01:03:59,060
Where is Staff Captain Do Jeong Wu?

764
01:03:59,060 --> 01:04:00,800
- Are you alright?
 - I asked you where he was.

765
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:03,130
He's protecting Son Min Ho.

766
01:04:03,130 --> 01:04:04,640
I don't know where they are.

767
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:06,500
Team Leader is the only one from the police force there.

768
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:07,470
Doctor.

769
01:04:07,470 --> 01:04:08,390
Doctor!

770
01:04:09,870 --> 01:04:12,300
What are you doing, Doctor?

771
01:04:12,300 --> 01:04:14,940
We finally find you after three days. Where have you been? What have you been doing?

772
01:04:14,940 --> 01:04:16,840
- It's Staff Captain Do Jeong Wu.
 - What?

773
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:17,580
What do you mean?

774
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:21,000
The culprit. The person who killed Kim Yeong Jun, Park Gyu Tae, and Choi Yong Seok.

775
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
And the person who caused Nam Wu Cheon to set that fire.

776
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,800
It was all Staff Captain Do Jeong Wu.

777
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:26,670
Doctor, I think maybe you're not yourself right now.

778
01:04:26,670 --> 01:04:27,490
Are you alright?

779
01:04:27,490 --> 01:04:28,680
White Night Village.

780
01:04:28,680 --> 01:04:30,980
White Night Village. Yes, Staff Captain Do Jeong Wu was there, too.

781
01:04:30,980 --> 01:04:33,090
I don't know his M.O. or his motive. But I am right about this.

782
01:04:33,090 --> 01:04:34,420
But I am right about this.

783
01:04:34,420 --> 01:04:35,560
Hydrogen Peroxide. Why was that in the vault?

784
01:04:35,560 --> 01:04:36,960
Why was that in the vault?

785
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:38,190
What? Well...

786
01:04:38,190 --> 01:04:40,920
Why would a household item be inside the vault?

787
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:42,900
Team Leader said he brought it.

788
01:04:42,900 --> 01:04:45,790
It would have been difficult to breathe at all, due to the smoke and the flames.

789
01:04:45,790 --> 01:04:48,380
But in that huge house he's never been to, he found hydrogen peroxide

790
01:04:48,380 --> 01:04:50,060
and brought it to the secret vault?

791
01:04:50,060 --> 01:04:52,160
That's true.

792
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:53,910
And the fact that the vault was there,

793
01:04:53,910 --> 01:04:57,860
even the maid who worked there for a long time said she didn't know about it.

794
01:04:57,860 --> 01:04:59,260
So how did Team Leader know about it?

795
01:04:59,260 --> 01:05:01,220
Because he knew it from before.

796
01:05:01,220 --> 01:05:04,820
The location of a secret vault that only the homeowner and the architect knew.

797
01:05:04,820 --> 01:05:07,260
And that the vault did not have any ventilation.

798
01:05:07,260 --> 01:05:10,780
So that in order to stay alive in there, he would need hydrogen peroxide.

799
01:05:10,780 --> 01:05:14,350
Staff Captain Do knew all of that.

800
01:05:15,430 --> 01:05:17,430
I don't have time to provide a long explanation.

801
01:05:17,430 --> 01:05:19,670
Please let me get in touch with the safe house right now.

802
01:05:19,670 --> 01:05:21,330
What are you talking about?

803
01:05:21,330 --> 01:05:23,600
Is it a safe house if anyone can just contact them?

804
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:25,440
Obviously, during a time of risk, only secret communication can be allowed—

805
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:26,690
Staff Captain Do Jeong Wu.

806
01:05:26,690 --> 01:05:29,930
Aside from Staff Captain Do Jeong Wu

807
01:05:29,930 --> 01:05:32,600
no one else can contact the outside world.

808
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:33,520
What? Hello? Hello?

809
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:34,570
Hello?

810
01:05:35,620 --> 01:05:38,390
- What is she mumbling to herself about? 
 - Why?

811
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:39,800
Why?

812
01:05:51,350 --> 01:05:53,400
This was it.

813
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:57,590
It was all for this purpose.

814
01:05:58,540 --> 01:06:01,620
Before he ran into Son Min Ho's home, he looked at his watch.

815
01:06:01,620 --> 01:06:03,200
He was calculating

816
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:05,840
when and how he will enter that home.

817
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:07,260
Misdirection.

818
01:06:07,260 --> 01:06:09,950
He showed all the clues directly in front of my eyes,

819
01:06:11,450 --> 01:06:14,680
but I didn't see them, so I didn't suspect him.

820
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:15,660
Doctor.

821
01:06:15,660 --> 01:06:17,910
Doctor, what are you talking about? Doctor?

822
01:06:17,910 --> 01:06:19,130
He never once said

823
01:06:19,130 --> 01:06:21,320
He never once said that it wasn't him.

824
01:06:21,320 --> 01:06:22,600
 You're the culprit.

825
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:24,600
 Do you really think that I am that type of person?

826
01:06:24,600 --> 01:06:26,230
 The child who survived

827
01:06:26,710 --> 01:06:29,850
 couldn't overcome his murderous impulses

828
01:06:29,850 --> 01:06:31,670
 and began causing these incidents.

829
01:06:31,670 --> 01:06:33,130
 Do I seem like that type?

830
01:06:33,130 --> 01:06:34,100
 Then

831
01:06:35,450 --> 01:06:38,190
 I guess I'm the culprit.

832
01:06:42,560 --> 01:06:47,000
Please tell me the location of the safe house immediately.

833
01:06:47,900 --> 01:06:49,720
Sure, alright.

834
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:51,700
So there is a part of him that is scary

835
01:06:51,700 --> 01:06:53,700
but he's not someone who would ever commit a crime.

836
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:58,300
Let's trust him, then.

837
01:06:59,160 --> 01:07:01,910
 If anyone asked me how much I trusted him,

838
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:05,200
 I would have responded that I would trust him even if the sky collapsed.

839
01:07:09,060 --> 01:07:10,450
 And then

840
01:07:11,450 --> 01:07:14,600
 the sky really did collapse.

841
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:20,070

842
01:07:20,070 --> 01:07:24,860
♫  I hoped it was a dram  ♫

843
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:31,670
♫  I didn't know it would be an endless night  ♫

844
01:07:31,670 --> 01:07:38,450
♫  following that moon which is shining dimly  ♫

845
01:07:38,450 --> 01:07:41,240
♫  it comes to me, without feeling  ♫

846
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:44,230
 Awaken

847
01:07:44,230 --> 01:07:45,360
 Get off him right now!

848
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:47,070
 The culprit who shook Korea,

849
01:07:47,070 --> 01:07:49,700
 the one who committed those serial killings has been revealed to be a police officer.

850
01:07:49,700 --> 01:07:51,580
 What happened in the White Night Village?

851
01:07:51,580 --> 01:07:52,660
 Why did all those people die?

852
01:07:52,660 --> 01:07:54,850
 I definitely gave them a choice.

853
01:07:54,850 --> 01:07:56,790
 Because that was reality, not a dream.

854
01:07:56,790 --> 01:07:58,860
 What is it that you failed to tell me?

855
01:07:58,860 --> 01:08:00,330
 That monster is me.

856
01:08:00,330 --> 01:08:03,590
 Team Leader is a mess, but he isn't someone who would kill another person.

857
01:08:03,590 --> 01:08:06,220
 You must get that police officer in your hands, no matter what.

858
01:08:06,220 --> 01:08:08,790
 Do Jeong Wu. What is your true identity?

859
01:08:08,790 --> 01:08:10,900
 There is something else to this case.

860
01:08:10,900 --> 01:08:14,440
♫  just set me free  ♫
