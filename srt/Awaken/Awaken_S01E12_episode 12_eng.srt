1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:08,030

2
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:38,010
 Awaken

3
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:49,030
 Customer 1818 (Oh Gyeong Min)

4
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:58,430
 Customer 1818 (Oh Gyeong Min)

5
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,330
Old Man?

6
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:07,000
What?

7
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:11,570
They said Hyeon Su's body was discovered in a park in Yunjung-dong?

8
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:14,830
Yeah. They said it was in the trunk.

9
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:16,190
What about it?

10
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:19,100
Hyeon Su had his cell phone with him, didn't he?

11
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:22,990
Could we track his phone to find out where he was right before he went to that park?

12
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:25,940
We can find out by tracking his phone

13
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:28,210
but just let the police catch the killer.

14
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:30,220
You could get hurt for nothing digging into this.

15
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:34,190
Oh Gyeong Min is the last person whom Hyeon Su spoke to on his phone before he died.

16
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:38,910
He happens to be the son of Oh Jeong Hwan, the President's Chief of Staff.

17
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:40,040
What did you say?

18
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,410
I met him a few times while investigating those forewarned murders.

19
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:46,040
His friend Kim Yeong Jun was the first victim.

20
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,720
So he killed Hyeon Su?

21
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,000
The possibility is high.

22
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,530
And I think there's a way I can approach Oh Jeong Hwan.

23
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,540
 Lodgings

24
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:05,250
We'll probably leave today.

25
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,290
But why isn't he coming out yet?

26
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:17,330
Excuse me?

27
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:51,960
How can you leave without a word?

28
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,800
Did you get some sleep last night? Let's go.

29
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,430
You sent something just now, didn't you? What is it?

30
00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:01,540
No, of course not. Let's get on the boat before the captain changes his mind.

31
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:07,230
Hurry up.

32
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:29,890
 Awaken

33
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:39,240
 Episode 12

34
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:06,460
I tried tracking his phone.

35
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:13,040
It seemed he spent about an hour at an area near  number 41, Seoyeon Industrial Complex, Yeonsi-dong,

36
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,700
-  number 41, Seoyeon Industrial Complex, Yeonsi-dong,.
 - Yes.

37
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:21,450
I don't know the exact location, but the digital cell site in that area...

38
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,200
So it's probably somewhere around there.

39
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:34,810
 Multipurpose CCTV Active

40
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:44,430
Are you sick?

41
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:48,540
Why are you in your room all day, not even eating?

42
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:51,150
- Where is Dad?
 - He didn't come home again last night.

43
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:53,460
Don't you know that Dad loves work more than home?

44
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:54,770
Hurry and come out to eat.

45
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:56,380
I don't want to.

46
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:05,570
Do you think Team Leader is doing well?

47
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:10,020
I know, I'm worried too. I hope he's well and not having problems.

48
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:15,210
Dr. Jamie isn't here either.

49
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:18,840
Gong is gone, too. How lonely.

50
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:22,640
But I'm here.

51
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,800
You startled me. Really.

52
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:36,200
- Hello?
 - Hey, it's me.

53
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,460
So who are you?

54
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:43,440
Team Leader?! Where are you right now? Nothing is going on, right?

55
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,810
- It's Team Leader?
 - Yes.

56
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:47,250
Well, something is always going on.

57
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,940
Let me ask you a favor, Lieutenant Jang.

58
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,820
Give me the phone, let me talk to him.

59
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:54,450
- You're doing well, aren't you, Team Leader?
 -Wait. Calm down.

60
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:56,670
A favor? Yes, tell me.

61
00:06:56,670 --> 00:07:01,240
There should be a CCTV near  number 41, Seoyeon Industrial Complex, Yeonsi-dong,

62
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,790
I need recordings from that.

63
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:04,600
The CCTV in Seoyeon Industrial Complex?

64
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,970
Yes, let me request recordings from the past 10 days.

65
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:08,010
I understand.

66
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:11,890
And I would prefer that you don't tell Lieutenant Gong about this.

67
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:16,740
Team Leader, Gong submitted her resignation.

68
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:21,440
Mmm, got it. Thanks a lot.

69
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,780
 Yes, I understand.

70
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,440
Let me speak to him.

71
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,710
Team Leader? This is Lieutenant Yun.

72
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:30,650
It's been... hello? Hello?

73
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:33,420
Hey, what did he say? Hey!

74
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:47,290
What is the status of the children?

75
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:51,760
They are still excited, so I am administering sedatives.

76
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:55,630
I don't see any physical abnormalities so far.

77
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:59,020
It has now become difficult to find test subjects.

78
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,220
I apologize.

79
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:05,930
Do Jeong Wu was looking for His Excellency and this laboratory.

80
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:10,650
Just as he said on the day of the disaster, he said he intends to return everything to the way they were.

81
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:13,040
Do Jeong Wu.

82
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:23,530
That's not the name I gave him.

83
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,320
Isn't that true?

84
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,680
 Team Leader, the CCTV recordings you asked for, they deleted everything from the last 10 days.

85
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,410
Alright, thanks. You've worked hard.

86
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:44,560
Team Leader, if you ever need money—

87
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,320
Please take care of yourself, Team Leader.

88
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,050
Hello? Hello?

89
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:51,900
Huh? What is that?

90
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,520
 Hello everyone, this is Lee Ji Wuk of Current Events Zoom-In.

91
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:59,120
 I am at this dock on my way to White Night Village.

92
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,820
 Do you remember the forewarned murders?

93
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:06,240
 After the case of Son Min Ho, formerly head of the White Night Village, the last victim,

94
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,050
 the police department's news embargo prevented us from following up.

95
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:14,620
 A new murder forewarning has arrived after a month.
 - A new forewarning notice?

96
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:17,960
 The day the red dog rides the white dragon

97
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:22,650
 an arrogant coward will become the 12th star of the Tarot.

98
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:25,010
Oh no, another forewarning notice of murder?

99
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:27,670
How many have they had so far?

100
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:31,660
 The lead officer for the case Do Jeong Wu has been the prime suspect.

101
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:34,080
 He has yet to be caught.

102
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,560
Your Team Leader still hasn't been caught?

103
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:41,460
 This time what will the method be and what person will be sacrificed?

104
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:45,710
 It's time for the police to respond promptly.

105
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:11,050
Captain, we will return tonight, so you have to stay here until then.

106
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:12,890
Sure, alright.

107
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:28,510
How does it feel to have found this place again?

108
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:31,530
I wanted to run away from here so badly,

109
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:33,870
and now I've returned here voluntarily.

110
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:43,270
 The day the red dog rides the white dragon, an arrogant coward will become the 12th star of the Tarot.

111
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:45,240
Did Team Leader send this one, too?

112
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,040
No, that cannot be true.

113
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:51,010
If he did, would he have asked us to get him those CCTV recordings?

114
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,800
What did you say?

115
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:57,560
- Gong, didn't you resign—
 - What did you just say?

116
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:00,710
Team Leader called?

117
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:04,130
- Y-yes.
 - When? Where is he?

118
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:06,480
Why won't you tell me?

119
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,910
Team Leader said not to tell you.

120
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:14,460
 The day the red dog rides the white dragon, an arrogant coward will become the 12th star of the Tarot.

121
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:18,940
Why would Team Leader ask for CCTV recordings from Yeonsi-dong?

122
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:21,420
I don't know. He didn't tell us.

123
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:25,460
Maybe it's related to the new forewarned murder?

124
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:30,660
 The day the red dog rides the white dragon, an arrogant coward will become the 12th star of the Tarot.

125
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:36,710
The day the red dog rides the white dragon...

126
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:39,690
 October 4th

127
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:43,740
... an arrogant coward will become the 12th star of the Tarot.

128
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:47,240
02593.

129
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,010
Oh, that's Yeonsi-dong.

130
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:52,700
Tarot cards begin with zero, and the 12th card is the hanging man.

131
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:57,000
Hanging man? Does that mean he will die hung by his neck?

132
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Converting binary to decimal,  it's 1 ... 1:30 am.

133
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:05,750
So someone will be hanged in Yeongsi-dong at 1:30 a.m. tomorrow.

134
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,900
So that will be in Yeonsi-dong.

135
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,700
The place where Hyeon Su died.

136
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:18,710
 October 4th
 01:30
 02-593 -&gt; Yeonsi-dong

137
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,870
I took care of it well as you told me to.

138
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,810
You've done well. No one followed you, did they?

139
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:30,580
No. What should I do with the empty truck?

140
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:34,010
Take it back to where it was before. Someone will take care of it.

141
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:39,380
What about Do Jeong Wu?

142
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:41,200
I apologize.

143
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,830
If you find even a small trace of him, report it to me immediately.

144
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:48,700
Yes, I understand.

145
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:00,540
Hey, Old Man, it's me.

146
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:04,130
- I think Oh Gyeong Min did kill him.
 - Such a young guy...

147
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:07,350
He didn't seem tough enough to premeditate murder.

148
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:09,550
Don't you think that's why Oh Jeong Hwan is involved in it?

149
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:11,840
Aigoo, this pathetic boy.

150
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,630
But why is the forewarned murder happening there, of all places?

151
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:20,740
I think that third child is trying to kill Oh Gyeong Min.

152
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:25,920
 After the case of Son Min Ho, formerly head of the White Night Village, the last victim,

153
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,760
- Going somewhere?
 - I have to confirm that things are going well.

154
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,640
So what will you do?

155
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,250
Is there much to do?

156
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:36,470
I just have to do what I've been doing all along.

157
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:39,900
You've suddenly become so curious.

158
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:42,450
No, I'm just worried.

159
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:44,060
Worry? S**t.

160
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:46,720
 He has yet to be caught.

161
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,890
I do have to acknowledge that the media is really fast.

162
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:54,190
 This time what will the method be and what person will be sacrificed?

163
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:57,890
What is that? 
  It's time for the police to respond promptly.

164
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:22,120
They're laying out the playing board for me.

165
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:38,480
Wow. White Night Village.

166
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,680
We've finally come.

167
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:47,880
Are you alright? If it's difficult, I can go alone.

168
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,570
I'm alright.

169
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:51,710
You don't seem alright.

170
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:55,520
I will see it. I went through so much to come all this way.

171
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,110
What's going on?

172
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:15,380
Moon Jae Wung sent a new forewarning notice.

173
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:20,150
 A new murder forewarning has arrived after a month.

174
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:24,340
Tomorrow at 1:30 a.m., in a building in the Seoyeon Industrial Complex in Yeonsi-dong

175
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:27,350
I will tell him to kill Oh Gyeong Min, the son of Oh Jeong Hwan.

176
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:28,930
Is that so?

177
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:32,630
That isn't all. We plan to use Oh Gyeong Min and trap Do Jeong Wu.

178
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,360
Things are working out easier than I expected.

179
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:41,960
Looks like we can catch Do Jeong Wu and Moon Jae Wung in one blow.

180
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:44,750
Hold on.

181
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,780
Maybe we can catch three.

182
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:19,980
 Call logs

183
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:22,330
 Customer 1818 (Oh Gyeong Min)

184
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,740
 Drug Dealer

185
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:32,130
 Drug Dealer

186
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:51,600
 Die! Ugh!

187
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:26,980
Are you alright?

188
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:30,210
When I hung myself, I woke up.

189
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,340
You did well.

190
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:38,310
If you keep stimulating your brain that way, your fear will decrease.

191
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:43,220
And eventually, you will come to forget all the bad memories and experiences.

192
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,310
Take this medication tonight.

193
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:51,920
This time, you can probably do it on your own.

194
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:15,060
What's wrong? Is there something?

195
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:16,980
No.

196
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:20,570
Let's go in.

197
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:37,200
Let me know what you're thinking.

198
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:45,080
Nothing?

199
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,970
This smell.

200
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:47,700
There were children.

201
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:49,160
What?

202
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,090
That night,

203
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,250
they were here.

204
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:57,970
There were three kids.

205
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,020
Do you remember?

206
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:15,900
I don't know what but something definitely was here.

207
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:30,330
 ... prevented us from following up. A new murder forewarning has arrived after a month.

208
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:33,900
 The day the red dog rides the white dragon

209
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:36,200
There is a visitor.

210
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:51,530
You said you'll catch them. How are you going to do it?

211
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:01,210
 - What does this message—  
 - I saw this news as well.

212
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:04,200
Not reporter Lee Ji Wuk but the woman behind him.

213
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:09,760
- Who is she? 
 - Jamie Leighton.

214
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:13,600
Jamie Leighton is now in White Night Village with the reporter.

215
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:17,140
Isn't the target in the deserted village with no one there

216
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:19,540
a perfect prize?

217
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:50,440
 Kang Yun Seong

218
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:00,530
No, when is it not dark?

219
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:03,500
We haven't looked at everything yet. What should we do?

220
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:08,770
It's too dark to see anything anyway. So, let's come back tomorrow again. Let's return.

221
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,010
I'm not getting any signal!

222
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:21,930
If he couldn't contact me, he should've at least waited!

223
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:25,290
We must've been really late. He just left.

224
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:27,550
No, do you leave people alone on a deserted island and go?

225
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:30,760
We can't stay here like this, let's return to the village.

226
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,380
What?

227
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:37,190
This is really driving me crazy.

228
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:42,600
What a funny man.

229
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:52,810
I mean, if you were not going to wait, then why take so much money?

230
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:44,200
Old man.

231
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,480
What now?

232
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,730
 The day the red dog rides the white dragon, an arrogant coward will become the 12th star of the Tarot.

233
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:55,100
 The day the red dog rides the white dragon

234
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:59,480
 ...12th star...

235
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:14,170
How about Gyeong Min?

236
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:16,310
Ever since the therapist left,

237
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:19,110
he has been sleeping in his room.

238
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:20,690
It's a relief.

239
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:23,610
Today, neither you nor Gyeong Min must go anywhere but stay at home.

240
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:25,100
 Why? Why so again?

241
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:27,540
Just do as you are told to do.

242
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:43,750
 Son Min Ho

243
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,240
 He just left.

244
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:51,890
 He just left.

245
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,250
Let's go.

246
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:09,510
 Die, you piece of trash!

247
00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:41,490
Please, please get some signal! Of course, we're not going to get any signal in the middle of nowhere.

248
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:43,970
We have to stay here until dawn anyway.

249
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:45,890
We can't just stay at the shore until then.

250
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:48,810
So, do you wanna go back in there?

251
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:52,300
I'm sure the boat will come to get us once it's dawn again.

252
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:56,630
I'm going to go crazy.

253
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,650
Wait up.

254
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:12,930
I hope PD No knows I'm here.

255
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:21,040
 He's always somewhere and nowhere at the same time.

256
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:44,300
It's been a while.

257
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:47,570
How long have you been holding a grudge?

258
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:52,600
You were different ever since the White Night Village days.

259
00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:59,590
You had a fierce look to your eye, unlike the other kids.

260
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:02,670
I should've known then.

261
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:07,220
Not only did you mess up that whole day for us 28 years ago,

262
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:09,950
but you had to bother me even to this day?

263
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:15,960
I'll make you like the other kids.

264
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:24,200
Get him.

265
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:34,500
Goodbye.

266
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:42,540
You got the wrong person.

267
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:43,560
What is this?

268
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:46,650
- Nobody move! 
 - Nobody move!

269
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:51,070
Get out, get out! I said get out!

270
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:55,080
I told you to back up!

271
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:01,640
- Put down your weapons. 
 - Put down your weapons. We aced our physical exams!

272
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:04,470
- Ji Wan, are you okay? 
 - Why did you guys get here so late?!

273
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:06,870
I said put down your weapons!

274
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:12,380
- Put it down! 
 - Get him.

275
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:14,900
Lieutenant!

276
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:39,330
Don't come here!

277
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:16,200
Lieutenant Yun, hurry!

278
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:24,010
Don't move! Don't come near us!

279
00:37:24,010 --> 00:37:25,810
Don't move.

280
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,650
Hurry up and get in.

281
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:41,010
Do Jeong Wu. Do Jeong Wu made me come here. I'll explain later, get in.

282
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:43,340
Hurry, open the door!

283
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:01,880
- Yes. 
 - Where is the third kid?

284
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:04,310
I told you earlier. He left when I told you.

285
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:07,310
Didn't you say it was at 1:30 a.m? That he was going to get Do Jeong Wu?

286
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:09,340
Yes. That's what he said.

287
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:12,120
Neither the third kid nor Do Jeong Wu showed up.

288
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:15,120
The police showed up and took Oh Jeong Hwan's son too.

289
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:18,890
What happened?! I'm asking you what happened?

290
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:32,350
Who are you, miss?

291
00:38:32,350 --> 00:38:36,300
I wasn't told there would be a lady.

292
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:41,000
I'm working with the Team Leader. I am Lieutenant Gong Hye Won.

293
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:44,010
Team Leader told me not to tell Gong...

294
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:48,770
What are we going to do about it? She showed up at the perfect timing.

295
00:38:51,350 --> 00:38:54,960
It's the Chief. I think he's calling in regards to the forewarned murders.

296
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:58,930
You two should go to the Police Station. I'll go with them.

297
00:38:58,930 --> 00:39:01,620
Could you pull over?

298
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:10,540
- Bye 
 - Bye.

299
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:18,950
Is Gong going to be okay by herself? She should be okay, right?

300
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:21,920
Don't worry about her. She's probably better off going than you.

301
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,450
Wh-what...?

302
00:39:24,450 --> 00:39:30,330
This building is so completely ruined that there is nowhere we can rest.

303
00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:33,330
At least we can avoid the wind.

304
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:36,880
Since when were you this positive?

305
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:41,340
I'm being optimistic because there's nothing else we can do.

306
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:43,680
Being optimistic, yeah right.

307
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:48,870
A new forewarned murder note came.

308
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:50,660
What did you say? When?

309
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:54,050
Last night. It came to the broadcasting studio.

310
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:55,540
Why are you just now telling me this?

311
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:59,600
Do you think you would have been able to look around this place with no bias?

312
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:04,530
The picture I took earlier was about that forewarned murder note.

313
00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:09,580
It's probably gone on air by now. If the police officers saw that, then they'll probably go further with the investigation.

314
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:13,810
Do you have the note? Show it to me. What were the details?

315
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:25,570
The day the red dog rides the white dragon, an arrogant coward will become the 12th star of the Tarot.

316
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:30,740
The red dog? 12th star?

317
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:37,160
October 4th. 1:30a.m.

318
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:40,290
It's passed.

319
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:43,080
The time has passed.

320
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:47,390
The 12th star of the Tarot is the person that was hung.

321
00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:50,570
The victim probably died by being hung.

322
00:40:56,440 --> 00:41:00,020
He's so heavy.

323
00:41:07,650 --> 00:41:10,150
What is this place?

324
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:14,580
Not anyone can just come in here. This is all because of Do Jeong Wu.

325
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:16,110
Where is the Team Leader?

326
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:18,570
Wait here.

327
00:41:28,130 --> 00:41:33,390
- Yeah, Old Man. 
 - There's another customer here. Hold on.

328
00:41:36,390 --> 00:41:41,340
Team Leader, it's me. What exactly is going on right now?

329
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:43,770
- Where's Oh Gyeong Min? 
 - He's here.

330
00:41:43,770 --> 00:41:47,990
- What happened? Why is Oh Gyeong Min... 
  - Do you know  the Blue House's secretary Oh Jeong Hwan is?

331
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:51,040
Oh Gyeong Min is Oh Jeong Hwan's son.

332
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,710
What?

333
00:41:54,330 --> 00:41:57,460
- Was this also done by the third child? 
 - Probably.

334
00:41:57,460 --> 00:42:01,020
But when Lee Tae Su died, there was no forewarned murder note or even a result video.

335
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:05,480
But why is he not being himself and sending a murder forewarning and commit a forewarned murder?

336
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,640
To drag me into it.

337
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:11,930
He dragged me into it so that while I'm trying to prevent the forewarned murder...

338
00:42:11,930 --> 00:42:15,400
He can go after someone else.

339
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,320
It's so cold.

340
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:20,000
We'll probably just freeze to death.

341
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,900
Let's find somewhere warmer.

342
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:35,180
Oh my gosh!

343
00:42:47,210 --> 00:42:50,640
 Mon Hyeong Port

344
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:54,440
Why was it Son Min Ho that showed up there?

345
00:42:56,190 --> 00:42:58,100
Salute.

346
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:02,020
What about Son Min Ho?

347
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:03,530
We played a game.

348
00:43:03,530 --> 00:43:05,720
This punk.

349
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:08,590
But what's up this late at night?

350
00:43:08,590 --> 00:43:12,760
What do you mean? We left work and got called in.

351
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:17,400
Everyone is going crazy because of the new forewarned murder.

352
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:19,190
You guys couldn't figure it out?

353
00:43:19,190 --> 00:43:21,520
Yes, we haven't figured it out yet.

354
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:25,150
We were also on standby because of the forewarned murder but got hungry.

355
00:43:25,150 --> 00:43:28,130
And we got a snack. Put a finger down if you ate a snack.

356
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:31,130
You idiots.

357
00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:33,630
Don't do anything useless.

358
00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:38,090
I said this before but you guys are responsible for your own lives.

359
00:43:38,090 --> 00:43:39,940
Let's go.

360
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:43,570
If something's wrong, let us know right away. Don't leave your spots.

361
00:43:44,790 --> 00:43:48,760
A game, yeah right.

362
00:44:12,390 --> 00:44:16,810
It seems like he took some kind of medication. But he looks okay for now.

363
00:44:16,810 --> 00:44:20,780
He's deep asleep so I'm sure he'll wake up after some time.

364
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:22,590
Team Leader will be okay, right?

365
00:44:22,590 --> 00:44:26,440
He will be. He's not just an ordinary guy.

366
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:30,160
Do you know the Team Leader well?

367
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:35,620
I've known him a for while but I don't think I know him well.

368
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:39,590
He came up to me long ago...

369
00:44:39,590 --> 00:44:42,980
And since then, he just shows up and disappears as he pleases.

370
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:47,840
It's not going to do you any good to worry so rest up.

371
00:44:59,870 --> 00:45:02,320
Ouch.

372
00:45:46,670 --> 00:45:49,370
Damn.

373
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:58,150
Damn.

374
00:46:01,130 --> 00:46:05,400
Damn, where's the signal.

375
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:23,930
What happened?

376
00:46:23,930 --> 00:46:26,810
There's someone else here besides us.

377
00:46:26,810 --> 00:46:30,690
Which bastards did this?

378
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:32,900
What the—

379
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:36,200
Be quiet and let me see your shoelaces.

380
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:40,400
- Bring your foot up. 
 - Shoelaces? What are you going to do?

381
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:43,300
So damn annoying.

382
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:45,690
 Recent calls

383
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:09,750
Gyeong Min! Gyeong Min! Gyeong Min!

384
00:47:11,590 --> 00:47:13,520
What's the matter?

385
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:16,800
Gyeong Min is gone! He was just here a while ago.

386
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:19,110
What have you been doing that you can't even watch after a child?

387
00:47:19,110 --> 00:47:21,930
I'll call the police.

 Do you want to work with me?

394
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:17,630
Is that why he brought me to the Special Team?

395
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:34,990
What the—

396
00:50:35,850 --> 00:50:37,450
What now?

397
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:11,170
It's been a while.

398
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:37,900
Where is this?

399
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:40,480
Is your memory starting to come back?

400
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:42,520
It was you.

401
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:46,200
Strangely, we bumped into each other but I didn't suspect anything.

402
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:48,330
The third child.

403
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:51,210
What exactly is your reason for doing this?

404
00:51:51,210 --> 00:51:55,340
Don't you remember what happened here?

405
00:51:55,340 --> 00:52:00,560
Innocent little children were killed in agonizingly painful experiments.

406
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:04,670
Those bastards who took away my simple life to satisfy their greed.

407
00:52:04,670 --> 00:52:06,310
I'm going to give them that same pain.

408
00:52:06,310 --> 00:52:08,380
Nothing changes just because you get your revenge.

409
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:13,280
It's better to be the one killing rather than the one who is afraid of dying.

410
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:18,800
You and Do Jeong Wu are all the same.

411
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:22,310
We came out of this place together that day.

412
00:52:22,310 --> 00:52:25,260
But the first thing I saw when I left the village,

413
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:29,380
was more horrifying than what I felt when I was here.

414
00:52:30,460 --> 00:52:31,880
 Let's get on.

415
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:37,550
 Don't go! Don't leave me here!

416
00:52:37,550 --> 00:52:39,890
 Don't go!

417
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:57,330
You guys left me all alone in the dark just to leave and save yourselves.

418
00:52:59,550 --> 00:53:02,280
I won't leave you guys alone.

419
00:53:07,610 --> 00:53:09,810
Sweet dreams.

420
00:53:09,810 --> 00:53:12,410
No. No!

421
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:19,010
Reporter Lee Ji Wuk, you put in hard work reporting about the forewarned murders.

422
00:53:19,010 --> 00:53:25,160
Some annoying things happened but you guys found your way here on your own.

423
00:53:47,420 --> 00:53:49,100
 Mom?

424
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:53,810
 Brother, where did you go?

425
00:53:53,810 --> 00:53:55,560
 Don't be scared.

426
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:58,790
 I'll protect you.

427
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:43,200
 Wait here.

428
00:54:43,990 --> 00:54:46,110
 Where are you going? We can't go out on our own.

429
00:54:46,110 --> 00:54:48,850
 We need people to send the boat off.

430
00:55:09,710 --> 00:55:11,310
 Let's go.

431
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:47,120
 Why are you doing this? Mom.

432
00:55:48,170 --> 00:55:51,010
 It's because this is how I made it.

433
00:55:57,600 --> 00:56:03,540
That's right. Think about those awful memories from that day.

434
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:07,130
You should at least retrieve those memories before you die.

435
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:16,230
The pain you guys gave me. I'm going to return it exactly the same.

436
00:56:56,310 --> 00:56:59,480
I'm sure I told you even back then to wait.

437
00:57:08,210 --> 00:57:11,340
 Don't move and wait for me. I'll be right back.

438
00:57:11,340 --> 00:57:16,290
 Don't go! Don't leave me here alone!

439
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:21,620
It was you.

440
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:30,130
I finally found you.

441
00:57:36,170 --> 00:57:38,160
I missed you.

442
00:57:47,020 --> 00:57:54,010

 The monster in my memories was making such a sad face.

450

 Go back to America before you lose the happiness that you searched for so long.

 What you're doing now is most definitely wrong.
