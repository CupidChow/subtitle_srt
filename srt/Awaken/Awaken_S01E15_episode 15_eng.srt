1
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:09,030

2
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:29,570
 Awaken

3
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:37,200
 Awaken

4
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:49,780
 Episode 15

5
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:06,740
It's been a long time, my son.

6
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:45,710
Just when you think it's all over, that is when it begins.

7
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:49,850
There isn't anything we can change.

8
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:11,800
What's happening here?

9
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,780
The tranquilizer isn't working at all.

10
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,900
Maybe because I've gotten one before?

11
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:27,230
You'd better prepare something stronger next time.

12
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:30,940
You raised me to be a hell of a guinea pig. Thank you, Mother.

13
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:32,610
What's going on?

14
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:36,750
Quite possibly, he's developed immunity from the previous shot.

15
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:40,300
Still, who knew he'd develop immunity this fast?

16
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:44,170
What are you waiting for? Get him!

17
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:06,300
If you move even a step,

18
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:10,780
you'll see something horrendous you'll never forget.

19
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:14,320
What are you doing? Grab him now!

20
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,860
I'll make sure you get a cozy position for all your cooperation.

21
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:36,970
What the hell am I doing? Should I turn the car around?

22
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:48,040
You startled me!

23
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:51,010
Hey, Do Jeong Wu, what are you doing here?

24
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:55,120
How have you been, Deputy Chief? I missed you.

25
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,820
You're one crazy jerk.

26
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:03,540
Aren't you supposed to continue to stay low?  Why show up in front of me?

27
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:08,390
I fully understand what you did at the autopsy room.

28
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:14,010
Well, about that, I had no choice.

29
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:19,300
Jeong Wu, are you really the culprit?

30
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:22,610
Will anything change if I'm not the culprit?

31
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:26,690
I'm going crazy. What's going on here? I haven't a clue.

32
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:30,230
About the Chief of Staff at the Blue House, Oh Jeong Hwan, the man harassing you.

33
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:35,470
- How do you know about him?
 - He's scheming something big.

34
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:37,190
What scheme?

35
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:39,270
Something that must be stopped at any cost.

36
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:42,830
I've got to stop it, and I need your help, Deputy Chief.

37
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,310
What did you say a minute ago?

38
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:55,920
You said before  that just when you think it's all over, that is when it begins.

39
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,250
Apparently, you don't have a full grasp of what's happening here.

40
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:01,560
Any idea how much money Baegya Foundation has been pouring into the police?

41
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:06,300
When the whole police force is in our grip, getting a few of them out here wouldn't change anything.

42
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:09,360
What am I then? Or Lieutenant Gong?

43
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,690
And what about our Special Team?

44
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:15,460
Just because you bought off a few heads of the police force,

45
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:18,340
don't think you have control of the twelve thousand police officers of this nation.

46
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,370
You are not even funny.

47
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:38,910
I have two kids who aren't even in college yet.

48
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:44,450
 Confidence in government authority has been compromised.

49
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:49,350
 I'm not proud of being a police officer anymore.

50
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:55,060
Yes, I shouldn't do anything shameful. I can't let myself be humiliated.

51
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:57,000
Listen carefully.

52
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,440
I've just been informed one of our own is in grave danger in the basement of this structure.

53
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,450
Even though we have lost the public's confidence in us,

54
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:08,010
we, the police cannot let ourselves be intimidated by criminals.

55
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:10,510
That is not right, is it?

56
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:14,660
- What are waiting for? Go and round them up!
 - Yes, sir!

57
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,360
You go left!  You go right

58
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,350
I think it's better for us to leave here for now.

59
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:28,410
Let's go! Move!

60
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:44,440
I'll see you again soon.

61
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,110
I'll be on the lookout here. You go ahead and search!

62
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:21,040
Move!
 - Yes, sir.

63
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:50,450
Hey, Jeong Wu, are you alright?

64
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:52,390
What took you so long?

65
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:56,810
How the hell would I know where this is? Any idea how hard I was looking for you?

66
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:59,320
I'll give you my jacket. You put it over your head.

67
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:03,340
No one should see me helping out a wanted criminal.

68
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:07,070
I'm fine. But I need help with the guy over there.

69
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:09,370
- Who is he?
 - You don't need to know.

70
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:12,380
Have you gone mad? You can't tie a man in chains like that.

71
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:17,420
Damn it, how can I undo the chain?

72
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,870
How on earth did Do Jeong Wu know and show up in the basement of that structure?

73
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:32,830
I'm not sure, sir.

74
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:44,790
Where are we this time?

75
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:47,060
Hey, where are you headed now?

76
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:49,560
Worrying about me? That doesn't suit you.

77
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,860
Listen to this punk. After all, I saved you.

78
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:58,070
Hey, Jeong Wu, are you really going to be okay?

79
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:02,970
Quit worrying about me. You just be careful. You don't know what Oh Jeong Hwan is up to.

80
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:07,330
We lost them all. I still have no idea what's going on.

81
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:09,780
Are you really not going to tell me anything?

82
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:14,200
Thank you for today. You're a good man.

83
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,930
Staff Captain, are you alright?

84
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:34,290
Who is he?

85
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:02,910
Is he the man you were trying so hard to find? The 34-year old one?

86
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:07,460
Instead of bringing him here, you should've turned him over to the police to free you from suspicion of the forewarned murders.

87
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:10,500
I'll be proven innocent of that charge eventually. But that's not what's important now.

88
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,990
If proving your innocence isn't important, then what is?

89
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:15,430
Aren't you tired of living on the run?

90
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:18,530
I'm, too, against handing him over to the police right away.

91
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:20,470
Doctor, you too? Why not?

92
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:24,860
It's highly likely that the man has Dissociative Identity Disorder.

93
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:28,770
 I think I may be of help.

94
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:33,180
 I'll bring my computer. I think I can at least find out which hospital you received surgery at.

95
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:35,250
 I won't leave you guys alone.

96
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:39,270
He seemed a completely different person when I saw him again at White Night Village.

97
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:42,320
Dissociative Identity Disorder? You mean multiple personality disorder?

98
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,490
Handing him over to the police while he's being dominated by a personality different from the one at the time of the murder,

99
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:48,840
it's likely that he won't remember anything.

100
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:53,220
That won't give us enough ground to prosecute him.

101
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:57,690
- What's even worse than that— 
 - He'll think he's being abandoned all over again.

102
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,670
That's right.

103
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:05,900
Even so, the truth must be revealed.

104
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:11,540
I also had the  amnesia that stemmed from Dissociative Identity Disorder at one point.

105
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:15,310
Apparently, my memory loss was because I'd witnessed the horrendous killing that day.

106
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:18,820
The third child said the same thing.

107
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:25,200
 You guys left me all alone in the dark just to leave and save yourselves..

108
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,590
 I won't leave you guys alone.

109
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:34,580
In that sense, all of us became the victims of what happened that day.

110
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:38,360
Okay, you got me there.

111
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:44,410
- I'm not saying it's your fault. 
 -  No, I'm right, it was all my fault.

112
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:46,830
So I'm trying to put things back where they were.

113
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:51,470
 Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency

114
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:54,720
- Are you saying Chief of Staff Oh Jeong Hwan?
  - Shh.

115
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:06,360
 Chief of Staff, Oh Jeong Hwan

116
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:09,010
What a perfect timing!

117
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,030
This is Hwang Byeong Cheol.

118
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:16,920
- What the hell do you think you are doing?
 -  Honey!

119
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:20,230
 How could I have known you'd be there of all places?

120
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:25,490
If I had, I wouldn't have gone there. I just heard one of my police guys was held in there.

121
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:28,120
- Where's Do Jeong Wu? 
 - I don't know either.

122
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:33,430
I guess I was wrong thinking that you're a family man.

123
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:41,300
A-Are you threatening me?

124
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:44,390
At any rate,

125
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:48,560
I've just told you what kind of a man I think you are.

126
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,540
Let me tell you this. I saw a lot of things I shouldn't have yesterday.

127
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:57,680
I wasn't alone. Many of my guys were there as well.

128
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,310
Anyhow, I'll have them shut their mouths about what they saw.

129
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:05,440
So stop calling me!

130
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,920
Dad!

131
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:26,370
Dad!

132
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,690
Dad, please let me be out.

133
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:32,790
Where do you want to go?

134
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:42,510
Dad. Dad, please.

135
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:44,220
What are you doing?

136
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:48,410
Why are you doing this? What do you think you're doing?

137
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,410
Oh sweetie!

138
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,150
You have a visitor.

139
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,710
What on earth is happening?

140
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:13,660
I safeguarded your life from the third child.

141
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:19,380
However I can't tell when that child will seek you out again.

142
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:22,050
- Do Jeong Wu took the third child with him. 
 - What?

143
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:24,420
What?

144
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:26,940
Why are you so surprised? I thought you've known it all along.

145
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:30,560
I understand you're upset with me because I didn't tell you about the third child.

146
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,920
But I know nothing about what's happening now.

147
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:39,010
- You're telling me you aren't a mole. 
 - What reason do I have to be one?

148
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:51,180
I need children.

149
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:55,960
- Children? 
 - Because of Do Jeong Wu, I'm having a hard time getting children for the experiment.

150
00:14:55,960 --> 00:15:00,310
I  need children under the age of fourteen right away.

151
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:10,130
 You said you'd like to be nominated to be on the foundation's board of directors.

152
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:16,030
What's hanging on the balance isn't a director's position, but the last chance to save your life.

153
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:08,850
Do you remember Dr. Jo Hyeon Hui?

154
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:15,880
I do.

155
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:22,550
- My mom. 
 - Are you saying your mom?

156
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:29,010
While Song Min Ho was the operational manager at White Night Village, Jo Hyeon Hui—

157
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:32,920
was the research manager. What about it?

158
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,480
I met Jo Hyeon Hui yesterday.

159
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:43,800
What surprised me was she hadn't aged a day. She looked the same as before.

160
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:48,250
-  Does that make sense? 
 - Apparently, she tested the formula I created on herself.

161
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:52,100
Your formula? Was it the reason why she looked so hard for you?

162
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:54,550
I guess it worked.

163
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:00,700
Where is your formula now?

164
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:03,320
Do you have it?

165
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:08,040
I need some fresh air.

166
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:58,940
- Are you okay? 
 - I guess.

167
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,190
Actually, I'm not.

168
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:07,410
I'm very confused.

169
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:09,950
About Jo Hyeon Hui being alive?

170
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:18,220
I forgot about the person who gave birth to me.

171
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:23,830
I thought I wouldn't be too shocked even if I'd meet my birth mother some day.

172
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:28,170
It'll be even more shocking if your birth mom looks the same as before.

173
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:34,220
As I began regaining my memory,

174
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:36,660
I also began putting together my mom's face in my head.

175
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:39,870
But her face wasn't anything that gave me warmth.

176
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:43,110
It wasn't like I remembered her face well.

177
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:46,890
Madness.

178
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:53,540
I only clearly remember the madness in her eyes.

179
00:18:56,730 --> 00:19:01,470
If you hadn't formed your serum,

180
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:04,830
do you think all would be somehow different now?

181
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:07,670
It might well be.

182
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:11,440
I doubt she was completely successful with her experiment.

183
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,150
If she had, she wouldn't be looking for me.

184
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:17,080
I see what you're saying.

185
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,440
I need some rest. Today has been a handful with many shocking happenings.

186
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:25,920
It'll be better for you not to stay at your place for the time being.

187
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:31,480
Are you worried about me?

188
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:36,570
Why don't you see if you can find a decent hotel around here?

189
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:58,840
Deputy Chief!

190
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:02,620
Have you heard from Staff Captain at all?

191
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:04,860
How did you find out about him?

192
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:08,130
With you guys, nothing's covert about a covert operation.

193
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:10,700
What about Staff Captain? Is he alright?

194
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,560
I don't know either, Dude!

195
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,380
Sir, please.

196
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:21,290
He's okay. I rescued him yesterday and gave him a ride. I don't know to where, though.

197
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:24,630
- That's a huge relief. 
 - G-Great job!

198
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:26,680
I admire you, sir. You are cool.

199
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,940
Saying such silly things.

200
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:32,250
As I've believed all along, you're the role model of the Korean police force.

201
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:34,610
- Thank you, sir! 
 - Got it already. Let go. Come on now.

202
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:37,560
- You crazy jerks. 
 - Thank you, sir!

203
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,820
How is the preparation coming along?

204
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:44,110
Are you here?

205
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:46,460
- It's not bad. 
 - I agree.

206
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:51,460
You can easily put together a broadcasting station as long you have a computer and a cell phone nowadays.

207
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:54,680
That's right. Equipment isn't that important.

208
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:57,980
We just have to  meet the public's need to know.

209
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:59,640
Don't you think, Producer Noh?

210
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:06,010
Still, nothing beats receiving paychecks from a broadcast station, even though they insult you.

211
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:08,940
I just had the bad luck of meeting you. Damn it.

212
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,750
What did you just say?

213
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:14,970
How sour. The candy I'm eating is really sour.

214
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:20,950
Just wait and see. We'll get the kind of scoop

215
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:23,130
that no station could ever dream of getting.

216
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,010
 - Baek Won Il: Died in November, 1994
  -  Ji Hyung Geun: If surviving, he's 106 years of age.

217
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:33,930
 Yu Gwon: Since 1992, has made no public appearance.   If surviving, he's 92 years of age. --&gt;

218
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:37,050
 Oh Jeong Hwan: The son-in-law, a key figure of White Night Foundation.   His record shows he disappeared around 1994

219
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:41,550
 1995 White Night Village and Korean Army Collaboration

220
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:49,430
How's Dr. Jamie?

221
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:52,160
She was putting on a brave face.

222
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:59,300
In other words, you knew what was going through her mind. But she didn't confide in you. Is that it?

223
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:02,820
You could've come right out and asked her.

224
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,850
I hear you're her twin.

225
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:07,950
You were telling me how it's hard to completely end things with family and whatnot.

226
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:10,330
Why are you so awkward around her anyway?

227
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:13,330
We didn't have the time to build the kind of filial bond

228
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:18,230
any ordinary family has and shares.

229
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:22,720
What's this sound?

230
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:33,840
Old Man, the sedative, please.

231
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,870
- The key. 
 - Pardon?

232
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:23,140
I need you to give me the key because I'm driving myself.

233
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:22,320
You should check who it is before opening the door.

234
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,070
How do you like staying here?

235
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:27,210
Is everything okay?

236
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:31,340
My place or the hotel, they are both just places I am staying in temporarily.

237
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:35,390
- I was going to have some coffee. Would you like some?
 - Great.

238
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:54,470
Korea is a much better place than I thought.

239
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:57,280
I can stay in and  even make my own sweet latte.

240
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:02,040
So don't tell me to go back to the States if that's why you're here.

241
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:05,540
I was part of the authority who needed to bring this case to closure.

242
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:08,560
At the same time, I'm also a victim of the case.

243
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:12,660
I didn't come here to tell you that.

244
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:19,080
You looked a bit sad and down yesterday.

245
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:24,290
You mean to tell me you're worried about me?

246
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:27,460
Why? Because you're my brother?

247
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:31,930
If not, because I know now that you're my brother?

248
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,720
This doesn't suit you. You know that, right?

249
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:38,060
Yeah, but I'm still going to say what I came here to tell you.

250
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:41,670
You don't have to feel the way you do. For Jo Hyeon Hui,

251
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:45,340
we may have been just the subjects of her experiment, not her children.

252
00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:50,840
I hope not. She's still our parent.

253
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,730
A parent?

254
00:25:56,610 --> 00:25:59,520
How foreign that sounds.

255
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:07,310
It's true I almost have no memories of that parent of ours.

256
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:11,150
Yet I'm reminded of this time to time.

257
00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:15,150
But why are you dropping honorifics with me?

258
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:19,660
You're my twin and younger sister. If you're bothered, you can speak casually to me, too.

259
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:22,960
I'm more comfortable with polite language. By the way, my name isn't "Hey, you."

260
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,210
How should I address you then? Dr. Jamie sounds too distant.

261
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:31,640
How about "Jame-ah?" See, that sounds strange.

262
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:37,560
Right, you did have a name once.

263
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,570
Ji Hui.

264
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:55,150
 Ji Hui, Ji Hui, wake up!

265
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:01,570
 - Oppa. 
 - Were you having a dream?

266
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:04,690
 - How do you know? 
 - Because I dreamed, too.

267
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:07,760
 - What kind of a dream? 
 - A sad one.

268
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:11,420
 I had a terrible nightmare.

269
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:17,460
 I don't remember what the dream was about. But I was very scared.

270
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:27,230
 What's going on?

271
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:29,410
 - Mom. 
 - Yes, sweetie.

272
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:35,490
 Did you have a nightmare again?

273
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:37,740
 It's okay, sweetheart. All is fine.

274
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:40,020
 Mom's here.

275
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:42,770
 Name Tag: Researcher, Jo Hyeon Hui

276
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:51,780
I remember the incident. But you don't remember what happened after that?

277
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:03,580
 She is having nightmares more frequently. We need to closely monitor her.

278
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:06,310
 Is she having side effects?

279
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:11,130
 It can't be helped.   I'm told the more progress we make, they will have more frequent night visions.

280
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:14,510
 The other test subject children are also sensitive to dreams, too.

281
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:17,490
 But her level of sensitivity seems more severe than that of the others.

282
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:24,590
 That's expected. She's been given the shots since she was in her mother's womb.

283
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:27,260
 It was to make the experiment with her successful.

284
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:29,790
 Don't make an unexpected side effect worse.

285
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:36,350
 We need to watch her a bit longer.

286
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:39,430
- What are they talking about? 
 - Shh.

287
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:51,390
Your real parents are those people in the States. So you should go back to your family.

288
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:54,360
See what I mean? You are saying that again.

289
00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:10,210
- Wow, this is really sweet. 
 - Is changing the subject your talent?

290
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:15,570
The reason why the third child turned out to be the monster was all because of The White Night Village.

291
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:20,020
And you are telling me to leave without seeing the case through? No, I can't do that.

292
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:23,820
Until the White Night Foundation which created the White Night Village is brought to its demise.

293
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:28,260
I can't leave even if I die.

294
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:33,030
- Even if you die? 
 - Even if I die.

295
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,640
I see my Ji Hui is very stubborn.

296
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:02,990
- Are you here? 
 - Yeah.

297
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:04,860
How's his condition?

298
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:07,020
It's about the same as yesterday.

299
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:13,590
What is that?

300
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:20,180
It's the medication Oh Jong Hwan picked up. It's probably used to reduce the side effects of the experiment.

301
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:23,100
In order for the experiment to be continued, pure red blood cells are needed.

302
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,920
Pure red blood cells.

303
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:30,150
Dissociative Identity Disorder is one of the side-effects of the experiment, so he could return.

304
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:32,120
If the medication proves to be effective.

305
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:35,650
Since some time has passed, let's give him another injection.

306
00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:05,810
 They, too, left without me.

307
00:31:05,810 --> 00:31:10,590
 Don't go! Don't leave me!

308
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:13,940
 No one will save us.

309
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:17,460
 Don't you think It's better to be the one killing rather than the one who is afraid of dying?

310
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:19,910
 Don't you have any friends?

311
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:22,270
 In the end, you live alone in this world.

312
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:24,430
 I'll kill them all.

313
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:30,980
  Hyung.

314
00:31:56,370 --> 00:31:58,300
 Honey.

315
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,150
 It's dangerous.

316
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,730
 - The medicine isn't perfect.  
  1985

317
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:13,770
 Sixty-five percent of the homeless subjects in the experiment were instantly killed.

318
00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:16,970
 The other thirty-five percent were rendered to a vegetative state.

319
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:20,430
 And recently, the final homeless person died.

320
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:24,850
 So, ive me that perfect medication.

321
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:29,430
 Bring me the medicine that can extend her life!

322
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:35,320
 - Why won't it work? You said you saw the completed formula.   
  1992

323
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:38,540
 Because it was erased soon after.

324
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:41,580
 I'm trying to reconstruct the formula, but there are just too many variables.

325
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:45,250
 I need more time to come to the exact formula.

326
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:47,800
 Time, time, that damned time!

327
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:50,790
 How much longer? It's been nearly ten years.

328
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:53,450
 Time isn't the only problem we have.

329
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:56,450
 I only have a little serum I can procure from the village.

330
00:33:56,450 --> 00:34:00,940
 Once I exhaust the remaining serum, I can no longer produce the medicine.

331
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:04,170
As I told you, I saw the complete formula.

332
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:06,360
 What I need is time to repeatedly test—

333
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,320
 I already said no! Stop it!

334
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:11,630
 The children, the homeless, and then the gangsters

335
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:15,040
 Do you have any idea how many of them I brought to you?

336
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,600
  I will succeed no matter what.

337
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:21,230
 I just need the serum of the children under the age of fourteen, their cells divide fast.

338
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:22,990
 And subjects to continue to inject the medicine into.

339
00:34:22,990 --> 00:34:25,780
 What are you saying? I have nothing more to give you.

340
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:28,990
 Your only choice is to produce the medicine with the serum you have left.

341
00:34:28,990 --> 00:34:33,910
 If you don't, it won't be your experiment alone that comes to the end.

342
00:34:53,530 --> 00:34:56,500
 Why are you drawing my blood?

343
00:34:56,500 --> 00:35:01,200
 To see if you are sick anywhere, my son.

344
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,620
 Then what about me?

345
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:05,400
 Then do you want a prick too, my daughter?

346
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,130
 No.

347
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,270
 It'll sting a little.

348
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:07,100
Not like the serum you used for the other patients at that time,

349
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:12,360
the injection you received was made using Do Jeong Wu's blood cells, wasn't it?

350
00:36:16,330 --> 00:36:20,540
Did you expect to see the result you're seeing now, by chance?

351
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:27,690
Knowing fully that I could die, I willingly became the subject of the experiment.

352
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:31,500
You know that well and the reason why.

353
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:38,830
If Do Jeong Wu's serum gave you eternal youth....

354
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:57,920
It's alright. Calm down.

355
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:00,540
I'm sorry.

356
00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:07,170
You've returned, haven't you?

357
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:13,490
Coming to your senses?

358
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:19,530
You are... Do Jeong Wu.

359
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:21,450
So you remember.

360
00:37:34,810 --> 00:37:39,000
Arent' you hungry?  Should I buy you some cup ramyeon?

361
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,240
No, it's alright.

362
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,650
Did you just smile?

363
00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:45,470
Did you just smile?  You smiled, didn't you?

364
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:48,430
But what happened?

365
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:51,610
My last memory is getting abducted.

366
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:55,800
You remember that? And then?

367
00:37:57,580 --> 00:38:01,070
When two personalities that were completely separated combined into one

368
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:04,850
the memories and thoughts were also combined, too.

369
00:38:05,830 --> 00:38:07,980
We injected you with medication.

370
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:12,330
When the effect of the medication wears out, we don't know what will happen. So let's wait and see.

371
00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:27,880
Is the serum from the third child effective?

372
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:32,560
Yes. The cells divide quickly, and the reaction is quite good, too.

373
00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:37,500
But the amount of the serum is not quite enough.

374
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:41,490
I can make the medicine using the serum from these children,

375
00:38:41,490 --> 00:38:45,210
but I can't guarantee it'd be effective.

376
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:52,020
There's one more child

377
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:54,860
who survived The White Night Village.

378
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:04,060
But it's a relief that he regained his senses.

379
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:07,360
His senses are not yet stable, so we have to wait and see.

380
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:11,280
The only connection we have to the secret laboratory is my dad.

381
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:16,350
So why don't I try persuading him once more?

382
00:39:33,850 --> 00:39:36,290
 Dad, you are well, aren't you?

383
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:39,800
 Can I see you, even just briefly?

384
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:00,820
Why did you come out? You should rest some more.

385
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:10,190
What? Got something to say?

386
00:40:12,090 --> 00:40:15,140
I am grateful.

387
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:20,680
I even tried to kill you, but you rescued me.

388
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,880
I had no choice.

389
00:40:32,310 --> 00:40:34,190
That day 28 years ago,

390
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:40,150
to return to the village to save my sister, I had no choice but to leave you there alone.

391
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:48,280
I wandered like crazy looking for her, but I couldn't find her.

392
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:52,040
When I returned to the boat, you had already disappeared.

393
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:59,360
It may sound like an excuse to you

394
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:05,360
but after that day, for the rest of my life, for having done that to White Night Village

395
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:11,770
and for having left you there alone, I lived atoning for that.

396
00:41:17,050 --> 00:41:20,190
I am sorry for causing you to live this way.

397
00:41:24,050 --> 00:41:26,440
I am really sorry.

398
00:42:31,370 --> 00:42:34,400
 Because I made it this way.

399
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:40,070
 I am alone in a street with no one around.

400
00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:42,470
 The sun is shining whitely

401
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:47,010
 The clock which is never wrong indicates it is midnight.

402
00:42:47,010 --> 00:42:49,050
 I wonder now

403
00:42:49,050 --> 00:42:52,900
 whether it is daytime

404
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:54,710
 or night?

405
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:58,040
 It's a monster. A monster.

406
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:00,610
 You are a monster!

407
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:06,860
No!!!

408
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:12,550
What now?

409
00:43:13,690 --> 00:43:15,060
Bathroom.

410
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:17,900
No!!!

411
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:19,980
Jeong Wu! What's wrong?

412
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:21,210
Candy, candy...

413
00:43:21,210 --> 00:43:23,980
Candy. Endure it for just a little bit.

414
00:43:39,910 --> 00:43:45,330
Dad, if you turn yourself in now, you could still claim extenuating factors.

415
00:43:45,330 --> 00:43:47,140
Let's stop talking about this.

416
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:50,820
I will figure out the rest. Please just tell me the new location of the secret laboratory.

417
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:54,040
Did you ask to meet me just to ask me this?

418
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:58,670
Hye Won, let's say you are a doctor.

419
00:43:58,670 --> 00:44:01,750
You have five patients waiting for an organ transplant.

420
00:44:01,750 --> 00:44:03,930
They will die if they don't receive a transplant immediately.

421
00:44:03,930 --> 00:44:07,590
But a healthy person was brought to the emergency room due to an accident.

422
00:44:07,590 --> 00:44:09,450
Even if you let him live, he will be a vegetable.

423
00:44:09,450 --> 00:44:12,280
If you immediately extract his organs and transplant them,

424
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:14,980
you can save five people right away. What would you do?

425
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:18,690
But you cannot remove organs from someone who is alive. That is murder.

426
00:44:18,690 --> 00:44:21,270
Yes, you can't do that, of course.

427
00:44:21,270 --> 00:44:25,800
But what if you can save both the organ donor and the recipient?

428
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:27,430
If that's the case, there would be no need to hesitate.

429
00:44:27,430 --> 00:44:32,410
And that is the work that I am trying to do. Finding a way to save mankind.

430
00:44:32,410 --> 00:44:34,270
But so many children have already died.

431
00:44:34,270 --> 00:44:36,610
If only Do Jeong Wu hadn't erased the mathematical formula

432
00:44:36,610 --> 00:44:42,700
or if he turned the formula over, precious lives could have been saved.

433
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:49,160
Talking about such things with you when we are meeting after so long. We should have just eaten a meal together.

434
00:44:54,330 --> 00:44:57,640
So you just need that mathematical formula?

435
00:45:05,830 --> 00:45:08,610
Team Leader gave me a pair of glasses.

436
00:45:08,610 --> 00:45:11,970
It was some type of VR (virtual reality) glasses that was connected to some server.

437
00:45:11,970 --> 00:45:14,140
I think

438
00:45:15,870 --> 00:45:18,610
the formula is in that server.

439
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:29,680
The work that I am trying to do is for the benefit of mankind.

440
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:07,280
Surprised to see me instead?

441
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:09,380
As always, you are using my daughter.

442
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:16,370
Aw, don't say that. I came instead just in case it might be dangerous for your daughter.

443
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:22,050
Is that the pair of glasses that contains the formula?

444
00:46:22,050 --> 00:46:26,370
Who knows? That would depend of what you give to me.

445
00:46:26,370 --> 00:46:29,430
I don't have some sort of reward for you.

446
00:46:29,430 --> 00:46:31,550
Alright, then.

447
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:34,420
What are you doing?

448
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:38,970
You said you have nothing to give me, so I intend to smash this.

449
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:47,500
If that's real, you wouldn't really smash that. You have to have something to negotiate with.

450
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:49,320
Indeed.

451
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:54,070
Where is the new location of the secret laboratory?

452
00:46:54,070 --> 00:46:56,010
If that is the formula,

453
00:46:56,010 --> 00:46:59,970
and the medication is perfected. Once that is confirmed, I'll tell you right away.

454
00:46:59,970 --> 00:47:03,310
What is your reason for being fixated on this medication when you don't know its true nature?

455
00:47:03,310 --> 00:47:06,460
Even I don't know that, and I'm the one who created the formula.

456
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:09,310
I saw it.

457
00:47:09,310 --> 00:47:16,610
I definitely saw people who succeeded at this experiment. Clearly, with my own two eyes.

458
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:23,540
Make sure to keep the promise.

459
00:49:27,380 --> 00:49:28,740
 1995 White Night Village and Korean Army Collaboration

460
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:31,660
 "White Night Village" in collaboration with enforcement of Korean Military

461
00:49:31,660 --> 00:49:34,360
 White Night Biotechnology Research Institute Opening Ceremony]

462
00:49:38,830 --> 00:49:40,320
 - Baek Won Il: Died in November, 1994
  -  Ji Hyung Geun: If surviving, he's 106 years of age.

463
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:45,520
 I saw it. I definitely saw people who succeeded in this experiment.

464
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:47,850
 "People?"

465
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:55,270
So that mean there is someone else besides Jo Hyeon Hui.

466
00:49:56,180 --> 00:50:00,800
 Ji Hyeong Geun disappeared around 1994
 Oh Jeong Hwan's records from 1995~

467
00:50:04,170 --> 00:50:06,720
 Dr. Gong Il Do

468
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:10,010
Yes?

469
00:50:10,010 --> 00:50:13,720
The formula is complete.

470
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:14,900
Is that true?

471
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:19,710
I can make enough for one injection with what I have.

472
00:50:19,710 --> 00:50:22,980
To continue the experiment, I will need more serum.

473
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:25,860
So you mean the fourth child. I understand.

474
00:50:25,860 --> 00:50:31,430
And one more thing. Even if we create the medicine with this serum, I cannot guarantee its safety.

475
00:50:31,430 --> 00:50:35,080
So won't we need more test subjects to test it out?

476
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:37,720
I will prepare that soon, as well.

477
00:50:38,470 --> 00:50:40,150
Yes.

478
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:53,740
Thank you.

479
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:25,170
- You're not going to ask what happened?
 - No.

480
00:51:25,170 --> 00:51:28,590
Seeing your expression, I don't think I have to ask.

481
00:51:28,590 --> 00:51:31,510
But I still had some hope.

482
00:52:00,250 --> 00:52:04,850
It was so difficult to try and rescue the children. I am sorry.

483
00:52:04,850 --> 00:52:07,430
You can stop now.

484
00:52:07,430 --> 00:52:10,980
- I really did my best.
 - That's not what I mean.

485
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:16,500
I am telling you that I made a mistake when dealing with you, Mr. Son.

486
00:52:18,340 --> 00:52:21,440
His Excellency wants to see you.

487
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:24,140
- His Excellency?
 - Yes.

488
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:27,550
I failed to acknowledge your hard work all this time, and that was my mistake.

489
00:52:27,550 --> 00:52:31,060
And His Excellency scolded me a lot for that.

490
00:52:32,020 --> 00:52:34,910
I am sorry about that.

491
00:52:34,910 --> 00:52:39,500
You don't have to apologize to me.

492
00:52:40,940 --> 00:52:43,970
You can go ahead and leave work now. I'm going to see His...

493
00:53:52,050 --> 00:53:54,190
Please go in.

494
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,190
This place...

495
00:54:42,610 --> 00:54:48,270
I saved the Guinea pig.  Now only the fourth child is left.

496
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:43,250
I devoted everything to you. But this is how it is, in the end?

497
00:55:43,250 --> 00:55:46,090
You are a rat born to be experimented on.

498
00:55:46,090 --> 00:55:48,790
But I fed you, gave you shelter, and even gave you money.

499
00:55:48,790 --> 00:55:52,400
I let you live as a human being until now, isn't that enough?

500
00:55:53,530 --> 00:55:56,360
Do Jeong Wu was right.

501
00:55:56,360 --> 00:56:01,560
And now, do you need my serum, too?

502
00:56:04,470 --> 00:56:09,240
So it was you, you damned bastard.

503
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:12,560
Since you know it, things should finish up easily.

504
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:55,290
Let's take care of this quickly and go.

505
00:56:55,290 --> 00:57:00,840
Do you really think I can be captured that easily?

506
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:03,780
I guess you have someone you trust.

507
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:07,530
Of course there is some one.

508
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:19,920
What's this place? This is not the secret laboratory.

509
00:57:21,850 --> 00:57:27,340
 When I survived White Night Village, I resented the person who made the village that way.

510
00:57:27,340 --> 00:57:32,540
 I didn't think about what me and the other children suffered there.

511
00:57:32,540 --> 00:57:36,140
 When I felt my life was ruined, Oh Jeong Hwan appeared.

512
00:57:36,140 --> 00:57:39,340
 He took me in when I didn't have the will to live.

513
00:57:39,340 --> 00:57:43,970
 So I pledged loyalty and my remaining life to him.

514
00:57:43,970 --> 00:57:45,450
 And?

515
00:57:45,450 --> 00:57:47,860
 Then you appeared.

516
00:57:56,280 --> 00:58:00,870
 Shoot me with a tranquilizer gun so that Oh Jeong Hwan doesn't notice.

517
00:58:02,610 --> 00:58:06,390
 I've already developed an immunity to it, so it won't be effective.

518
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:26,540
So will you be monitoring me forever now?

519
00:58:26,540 --> 00:58:29,430
Nothing is eternal in this world.

520
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:35,420
 Program Installing

521
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:40,650
You shouldn't treat him like an object after using him as your hands and feet all of his life.

522
00:58:40,650 --> 00:58:42,310
I am not treating him like an object.

523
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:44,840
Just retrieving my test subject.

524
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:50,430
That's very nice and all, but what is such a high-ranking person doing in such a dark and remote place?

525
00:58:50,430 --> 00:58:54,680
And just you two? What if something happens to you?

526
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:56,510
Are you worrying for my sake now?

527
00:58:56,510 --> 00:59:00,240
I'm not worrying. It was just tough to come all this way.

528
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:05,100
And I already worked so hard looking for His Excellency. So I was annoyed.

529
00:59:05,100 --> 00:59:08,800
So, after all that work, did you find him?

530
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:10,410
His Excellency?

531
00:59:10,410 --> 00:59:12,500
I did.

532
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:20,110
You are right in front me, Your Excellency.

533
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:41,990

534
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:05,770
 Awaken

535
01:00:05,770 --> 01:00:07,660
 I made a deal with Do Jeong Wu.

536
01:00:07,660 --> 01:00:11,460
 You sacrificed so many children to make this medicine?

537
01:00:11,460 --> 01:00:12,970
 To try and live forever?

538
01:00:12,970 --> 01:00:13,910
 Mom.

539
01:00:13,910 --> 01:00:16,490
 You grew up well, my daughter.

540
01:00:16,490 --> 01:00:19,530
 Stop saying useless things and return Dr. Jamie.

541
01:00:19,530 --> 01:00:22,110
 - Oppa!
 - Team Leader!

542
01:00:22,110 --> 01:00:25,080
 The two of us have to disappear for this sad story to end.

543
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:26,490
 No, don't do it.

544
01:00:26,490 --> 01:00:29,910
 You were born for this purpose.

545
01:00:29,910 --> 01:00:33,470
 My... monster.
