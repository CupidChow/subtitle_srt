00:00:11,661 --> 00:00:12,932

6
00:00:12,932 --> 00:00:14,061
(were strictly followed when filming with animals.)

(3 years ago)

8
00:00:41,974 --> 00:00:44,143
I've finished reading your novel, and it's bad.

9
00:00:45,313 --> 00:00:46,414
It's horrible.

10
00:00:48,143 --> 00:00:49,713
Hey, I'm working right now.

11
00:00:49,813 --> 00:00:52,383
Why do you think one of your readers thinks it's horrible?

12
00:00:53,383 --> 00:00:54,883
Aren't you curious as the author?

13
00:00:58,194 --> 00:00:59,523
What's so bad about it?

14
00:00:59,923 --> 00:01:01,624
The male protagonist...

15
00:01:01,624 --> 00:01:04,193
did what he did for the sake of the woman he loves.

16
00:01:04,363 --> 00:01:05,833
Why should he go to jail for it?

17
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:07,964
He committed a crime, so he should be punished for it.

18
00:01:07,964 --> 00:01:09,764
Why is that a crime?

19
00:01:10,033 --> 00:01:12,003
It was his dream, his love,

20
00:01:12,003 --> 00:01:14,344
and his innocent desire.

21
00:01:14,404 --> 00:01:17,143
After all, it was just him being delusional.

22
00:01:17,143 --> 00:01:18,344
"Delusional?" What do you mean?

23
00:01:19,943 --> 00:01:22,313
They truly loved each other.

24
00:01:24,813 --> 00:01:25,884
Well...

25
00:01:31,324 --> 00:01:32,324
Yes.

26
00:01:33,223 --> 00:01:35,624
Yes, we're keeping the reservation. That's right.

27
00:01:35,893 --> 00:01:37,594
Okay, thank you.

28
00:01:37,794 --> 00:01:39,163
I'll see you tomorrow. Thank you.

29
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:42,333
Reservation for what?

30
00:01:43,503 --> 00:01:44,874
I booked a concert hall.

31
00:01:45,033 --> 00:01:46,074
A concert hall?

32
00:01:46,874 --> 00:01:47,973
Why?

33
00:01:49,673 --> 00:01:50,913
I'm getting married tomorrow.

34
00:01:52,173 --> 00:01:53,173
You're getting married?

35
00:01:54,083 --> 00:01:56,344
Jung Won and I will have a quiet wedding ceremony, just us two.

36
00:01:57,413 --> 00:01:58,413
What?

37
00:01:59,283 --> 00:02:01,154
You said you didn't believe in marriage.

38
00:02:02,854 --> 00:02:04,893
You told me you'd never get married.

39
00:02:05,494 --> 00:02:08,424
I know, right? I find it fascinating too.

40
00:02:09,293 --> 00:02:11,233
Who knew I'd find someone...

41
00:02:11,233 --> 00:02:13,603
I wanted to spend the rest of my life with?

42
00:03:08,454 --> 00:03:09,883
Okay, got it.

43
00:03:09,883 --> 00:03:11,823
(Episode 11)

44
00:03:12,193 --> 00:03:13,964
Yoo Yoon Young's on the wanted list.

45
00:03:13,964 --> 00:03:16,063
Mo Soo Rin will defend her to the end.

46
00:03:16,063 --> 00:03:17,633
We must get her soon.

47
00:03:17,633 --> 00:03:19,633
She turned her phone off two days ago.

48
00:03:19,633 --> 00:03:21,233
That means she fled.

49
00:03:21,233 --> 00:03:22,263
Could she have stowed away?

50
00:03:22,263 --> 00:03:23,434
She wouldn't do that.

51
00:03:24,073 --> 00:03:25,103
Seol Woo Jae's here.

52
00:03:25,573 --> 00:03:28,073
She did everything to get to him.

53
00:03:28,073 --> 00:03:29,774
She wouldn't give up on him that easily.

54
00:03:30,204 --> 00:03:31,714
Yoo Yoon Young's phone just turned on.

55
00:03:31,714 --> 00:03:33,813
- What? Where? - The express bus terminal.

56
00:03:35,084 --> 00:03:36,344
- Go get her. - Okay.

57
00:03:36,344 --> 00:03:38,684
(Violent Crimes Unit 1)

58
00:03:41,524 --> 00:03:42,954
- Hey, go that way. - Okay.

59
00:03:47,024 --> 00:03:48,024
Sorry.

60
00:03:48,293 --> 00:03:49,994
Excuse me. Sorry.

61
00:03:51,994 --> 00:03:53,263
Sorry.

62
00:04:11,353 --> 00:04:12,853
(From Seoul to Mueon)

63
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:17,654
Sorry.

64
00:04:18,754 --> 00:04:20,663
Sorry. Please cooperate.

65
00:04:26,064 --> 00:04:27,233
Can I see your face?

66
00:04:34,904 --> 00:04:35,944
Sorry.

67
00:05:03,774 --> 00:05:04,774
(Yoo Yoon Young)

68
00:05:07,033 --> 00:05:09,574
Did she tell you to wear her coat and take her phone?

69
00:05:11,543 --> 00:05:13,214
She's a wanted criminal.

70
00:05:13,214 --> 00:05:15,113
- You must cooperate. - What?

71
00:05:17,413 --> 00:05:20,254
Did she tell you to take the bus to Mueon?

72
00:05:34,933 --> 00:05:35,933
Jung Won.

73
00:05:39,733 --> 00:05:40,803
Jung Won.

74
00:05:47,884 --> 00:05:48,884
Where are you?

75
00:05:49,814 --> 00:05:51,783
Did you see or hear from Yoo Yoon Young?

76
00:05:52,454 --> 00:05:54,654
Why? Is something wrong?

77
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:56,754
She made us think she was at the bus terminal.

78
00:05:57,084 --> 00:05:58,594
If you're at work, be sure...

79
00:05:58,594 --> 00:06:00,964
Yoo Yoon Young doesn't tail you home, okay?

80
00:06:02,524 --> 00:06:03,723
I just got home.

81
00:06:06,363 --> 00:06:08,663
- Is Jung Won there too? - Her handbag is.

82
00:06:11,473 --> 00:06:12,634
(Detective Kim Tae Heon)

83
00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:14,644
Say Jung Won's at home.

84
00:06:15,644 --> 00:06:18,274
If you don't do as I say, Jung Won dies.

85
00:06:22,144 --> 00:06:24,113
Is Jung Won not there?

86
00:06:27,683 --> 00:06:30,123
She's here. She's asleep.

87
00:06:30,454 --> 00:06:31,623
I have to go.

88
00:06:43,973 --> 00:06:45,074
Hey, Woo Jae.

89
00:06:45,973 --> 00:06:48,204
- Are you with Jung Won? - Yes.

90
00:06:49,173 --> 00:06:50,774
I'll text the address. Will you come?

91
00:06:51,844 --> 00:06:54,144
Come alone, without telling the detective.

92
00:06:54,543 --> 00:06:55,743
Unless you want to lose your wife.

93
00:06:56,344 --> 00:06:57,654
If you hurt Jung Won,

94
00:06:59,214 --> 00:07:00,884
I'll kill you, and then kill myself too.

95
00:07:01,623 --> 00:07:02,783
I made it clear.

96
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:07,194
If you tell or bring anyone, Seo Jung Won dies.

97
00:07:18,233 --> 00:07:22,204
(Women's Toilet)

98
00:07:22,704 --> 00:07:24,574
This is where they swapped coats.

99
00:07:30,954 --> 00:07:33,214
The phone is turned off. Please leave...

100
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:35,324
Jung Won's phone is turned off.

101
00:07:35,524 --> 00:07:38,094
Didn't Seol Woo Jae say she was asleep at home?

102
00:07:38,353 --> 00:07:40,764
She never sleeps at this hour. I think he lied.

103
00:07:40,964 --> 00:07:42,964
Why would he lie to you about that?

104
00:07:45,493 --> 00:07:46,894
What if he had no choice?

105
00:07:50,334 --> 00:07:51,473
- Thanks. - Sure.

106
00:08:03,344 --> 00:08:04,654
(Seol Woo Jae)

107
00:08:06,483 --> 00:08:08,754
The person you have reached is unavailable. Please...

108
00:08:13,324 --> 00:08:14,394
Who are you?

109
00:08:17,933 --> 00:08:18,993
I'm a detective.

110
00:08:19,793 --> 00:08:21,533
I'd like to see if anyone's in.

111
00:08:21,533 --> 00:08:24,033
- Board Chairman Seol? - Yes.

112
00:08:24,033 --> 00:08:28,204
He drove off in a crazy hurry.

113
00:08:28,204 --> 00:08:30,243
He almost ran over someone.

114
00:08:31,014 --> 00:08:32,643
Was he with his wife Ms. Seo?

115
00:08:32,643 --> 00:08:34,483
No. He was alone.

116
00:08:37,914 --> 00:08:39,013
I think something's going on.

117
00:08:39,013 --> 00:08:41,054
Locate Seol Woo Jae's car right now.

118
00:09:35,844 --> 00:09:36,903
Goodness.

119
00:09:39,873 --> 00:09:41,883
What if you roll and fall to your death?

120
00:09:43,414 --> 00:09:44,483
What?

121
00:09:45,653 --> 00:09:47,314
Are you afraid you'll be stabbed...

122
00:09:47,883 --> 00:09:49,554
and die like Jin and Cha?

123
00:09:52,623 --> 00:09:54,164
I'm not a fan of blood.

124
00:09:55,664 --> 00:09:57,434
That's why I became a psychiatrist.

125
00:10:04,633 --> 00:10:06,704
Move and I'll push you right over.

126
00:10:08,973 --> 00:10:10,003
I said...

127
00:10:10,973 --> 00:10:12,044
we'd go together.

128
00:10:16,013 --> 00:10:17,584
I won't make you lonely.

129
00:10:19,954 --> 00:10:20,954
Yoon Young.

130
00:10:23,383 --> 00:10:24,393
See this?

131
00:10:25,253 --> 00:10:26,424
It stopped at 10pm.

132
00:10:28,064 --> 00:10:29,794
The current time...

133
00:10:30,934 --> 00:10:32,564
is 9:45pm.

134
00:10:32,834 --> 00:10:34,034
We have 15 minutes left.

135
00:10:35,204 --> 00:10:36,363
Don't do this.

136
00:10:43,074 --> 00:10:44,143
You know that...

137
00:10:45,914 --> 00:10:48,743
I stopped the clocks at all the murder scenes.

138
00:10:57,084 --> 00:10:59,023
At first, it didn't mean much.

139
00:10:59,753 --> 00:11:01,194
It was just a practical joke.

140
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:15,944
But the more I did it,

141
00:11:16,544 --> 00:11:18,714
the harder it became to forget the thrill.

142
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:23,983
Being able to stop someone's time forever.

143
00:11:25,353 --> 00:11:27,054
It made me feel like a deity.

144
00:11:48,503 --> 00:11:50,444
To make something go exactly as planned,

145
00:11:51,743 --> 00:11:53,273
everything must be perfect.

146
00:12:07,863 --> 00:12:10,934
Well done, Jung Won.

147
00:12:13,434 --> 00:12:15,003
It was perfect until then.

148
00:12:17,464 --> 00:12:19,733
Then I got too anxious to claim Woo Jae.

149
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:22,743
Guess what?

150
00:12:22,844 --> 00:12:25,513
I wasn't this obsessed with Woo Jae.

151
00:12:26,214 --> 00:12:28,784
I lost control after he married you.

152
00:12:30,784 --> 00:12:31,853
Because...

153
00:12:32,214 --> 00:12:34,554
you looked so amazing on TV.

154
00:12:35,383 --> 00:12:36,554
You looked so righteous,

155
00:12:37,653 --> 00:12:39,123
and you always did what was right.

156
00:12:46,464 --> 00:12:48,034
So I actually felt uneasy.

157
00:12:48,704 --> 00:12:51,733
That you'd call the police as soon as you found Eun Sae.

158
00:12:55,544 --> 00:12:57,373
Do you have any idea how grateful I was that...

159
00:12:57,574 --> 00:12:59,174
you did exactly what I wanted you to do?

160
00:13:09,353 --> 00:13:11,094
Now, there's only one thing I want.

161
00:13:13,153 --> 00:13:15,424
Making sure Woo Jae remembers me every hour, minute, and second.

162
00:13:16,194 --> 00:13:17,493
Making sure he never forgets me.

163
00:13:18,893 --> 00:13:21,003
I can only make him remember me until the day he dies...

164
00:13:23,034 --> 00:13:25,204
if you and I die together.

165
00:13:27,643 --> 00:13:28,674
Did you call...

166
00:13:30,204 --> 00:13:31,314
Woo Jae to come here?

167
00:13:51,094 --> 00:13:52,263
Of course.

168
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:53,964
To make my last night perfect,

169
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:56,334
I need Woo Jae to watch the whole thing.

170
00:13:59,074 --> 00:14:00,674
If he sees us die together,

171
00:14:03,973 --> 00:14:05,273
he will follow us.

172
00:14:05,273 --> 00:14:06,574
He might not do that.

173
00:14:07,174 --> 00:14:08,284
Woo Jae...

174
00:14:09,184 --> 00:14:10,914
can be scarier than me.

175
00:14:15,653 --> 00:14:17,523
I'll let you in on a secret right before we die.

176
00:14:18,824 --> 00:14:21,023
I'll tell you what Woo Jae has done.

177
00:14:44,714 --> 00:14:45,753
Stop.

178
00:14:46,554 --> 00:14:47,653
Don't come closer.

179
00:14:48,483 --> 00:14:50,324
If you take a step closer to us,

180
00:14:52,554 --> 00:14:53,723
I'll jump right away.

181
00:14:59,034 --> 00:15:01,064
Then Seo Jung Won will fall off the building with me.

182
00:15:05,733 --> 00:15:06,773
Okay.

183
00:15:08,103 --> 00:15:09,304
I won't move.

184
00:15:11,944 --> 00:15:13,944
You came here alone just like I told you to.

185
00:15:14,784 --> 00:15:16,113
I'll do everything you tell me to do.

186
00:15:17,113 --> 00:15:18,513
I'll give you everything I have.

187
00:15:18,513 --> 00:15:20,483
Money or whatever you want.

188
00:15:20,613 --> 00:15:21,653
You're saying that now?

189
00:15:23,184 --> 00:15:24,184
What's the point?

190
00:15:24,184 --> 00:15:25,824
I would have to rot in prison for the rest of my life.

191
00:15:30,964 --> 00:15:32,393
Please stop this.

192
00:15:32,564 --> 00:15:35,064
The three of us should all go down safely. Please?

193
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:39,574
If I leave Korea...

194
00:15:41,074 --> 00:15:42,544
and land in a different country,

195
00:15:43,674 --> 00:15:44,773
will you come for me?

196
00:15:54,883 --> 00:15:55,983
Okay.

197
00:15:58,123 --> 00:15:59,153
I'll do that.

198
00:16:05,294 --> 00:16:06,863
Woo Jae.

199
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:10,733
I won't fall for that anymore.

200
00:16:11,633 --> 00:16:13,334
Stop deceiving your wife now.

201
00:16:14,174 --> 00:16:15,473
Tell her the truth.

202
00:16:16,243 --> 00:16:19,044
If you can't, should I do it for you?

203
00:16:37,393 --> 00:16:39,194
The real culprit in Cha Eun Sae's murder...

204
00:16:40,164 --> 00:16:41,503
wasn't Soo Rin.

205
00:16:43,804 --> 00:16:45,304
It was your husband.

206
00:16:53,574 --> 00:16:55,284
The truth you were looking for...

207
00:17:03,353 --> 00:17:04,383
Woo Jae.

208
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:06,254
Watch...

209

210
00:17:11,633 --> 00:17:12,834
in the end.

211
00:17:51,034 --> 00:17:53,804
Let go!

212
00:17:57,774 --> 00:17:59,943
Let go!

213
00:18:14,054 --> 00:18:15,594
It's over, Yoo Yoon Young.

214
00:18:16,794 --> 00:18:18,064
Give up now.

215
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:21,504
I'm sorry.

216
00:18:28,173 --> 00:18:29,504
I failed,

217
00:18:31,143 --> 00:18:32,213
but I have no regrets.

218
00:18:43,653 --> 00:18:44,693
No!

219
00:19:42,344 --> 00:19:43,784
Around 10pm yesterday,

220
00:19:43,784 --> 00:19:45,883
Yoo Yoon Young voluntarily jumped off...

221
00:19:45,883 --> 00:19:48,683
the building in Myeongsan-gu, Seoul and died.

222
00:19:49,084 --> 00:19:51,554
On top of being suspected of instigating...

223
00:19:51,554 --> 00:19:53,594
Cha Eun Sae's murder as well as the murder...

224
00:19:53,594 --> 00:19:55,094
of Mo Hyung Taek's housekeeper,

225
00:19:55,264 --> 00:19:57,564
Yoo Yoon Young was suspected of committing arson...

226
00:19:57,564 --> 00:19:58,893
at Bongto Factory in 2009.

227
00:19:59,133 --> 00:20:01,403
Due to these suspicions, the police put her on the wanted list.

228
00:20:01,933 --> 00:20:04,103
When the police were canvassing an area to obtain information,

229
00:20:04,103 --> 00:20:06,004
Lieutenant Kim from Gangha Police Station...

230
00:20:06,004 --> 00:20:07,933
received a tip-off that the suspect,

231
00:20:07,933 --> 00:20:10,443
Yoo Yoon Young, was at a building in Myeongsan-gu.

232
00:20:10,443 --> 00:20:11,774
By the time he got to the scene,

233
00:20:11,774 --> 00:20:13,873
the suspect was already trying to end her life...

234
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:22,383
It's all because of my dad.

235
00:20:25,254 --> 00:20:26,554
My dad is responsible for her death.

236
00:20:29,123 --> 00:20:31,193
I won't forgive him. Never.

237
00:20:37,863 --> 00:20:39,004
Gosh.

238
00:20:39,534 --> 00:20:41,974
He hasn't even budged for an hour.

239
00:20:42,744 --> 00:20:44,244
It's quite cold out here.

240
00:20:44,844 --> 00:20:46,143
His knees must be hurting a lot.

241
00:20:53,314 --> 00:20:54,514
- She came out. - What?

242
00:20:54,514 --> 00:20:56,353
- She came out. - There she is.

243
00:20:59,953 --> 00:21:03,224
Stop disrupting me from running my restaurant. Just leave!

244
00:21:03,224 --> 00:21:05,693
I know that your restaurant opens at 3pm.

245
00:21:06,693 --> 00:21:07,994
I'll leave before then.

246
00:21:07,994 --> 00:21:09,903
This isn't going to change anything!

247
00:21:10,403 --> 00:21:12,774
It doesn't change the fact that you framed a victim,

248
00:21:12,774 --> 00:21:14,173
my brother, as the arsonist...

249
00:21:14,173 --> 00:21:17,143
when it was your daughter who committed the crime!

250
00:21:17,143 --> 00:21:19,774
It wasn't intentional. I swear.

251
00:21:20,274 --> 00:21:22,883
Back then, we had to investigate your brother...

252
00:21:22,883 --> 00:21:24,514
due to some circumstantial evidence.

253
00:21:27,084 --> 00:21:28,324
But even if there was,

254
00:21:29,153 --> 00:21:30,754
misjudging your brother as the arsonist...

255
00:21:31,153 --> 00:21:32,824
is clearly my fault.

256
00:21:33,693 --> 00:21:35,623
I will live the rest of my life in repentance.

(Case Name: Cha Eun Sae's Murder Case)

258
00:22:04,554 --> 00:22:05,754
Gosh.

259
00:22:06,054 --> 00:22:08,923
At last. I can't believe we actually got to close this case.

260
00:22:09,024 --> 00:22:10,064
Don't you feel liberated?

261
00:22:12,863 --> 00:22:14,663
I hope she can put this behind her.

The real culprit in Cha Eun Sae's murder...

265
00:23:23,133 --> 00:23:24,703
It was your husband.

266
00:23:27,074 --> 00:23:28,804
The truth you were looking for...

267
00:23:30,044 --> 00:23:32,974
is hidden in your favorite object.

268
00:23:34,244 --> 00:23:37,014
Why did she say something like that?

269
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:51,633
My favorite object? What could it be?

272

Let's get a divorce.

273
00:25:15,263 --> 00:25:16,993
A while ago, I moved back in...

274
00:25:18,164 --> 00:25:20,464
and said I wanted to give you another chance.

275
00:25:22,533 --> 00:25:23,704
I didn't actually mean it.

276
00:25:24,474 --> 00:25:26,204
I thought you were the killer,

277
00:25:26,204 --> 00:25:28,343
so I decided to stay by your side to dig deeper.

278
00:25:30,114 --> 00:25:32,013

00:25:32,013 --> 00:25:33,513
to make things go back to the way they used to be...

280
00:25:34,043 --> 00:25:35,513
made me sad,

281
00:25:36,353 --> 00:25:37,513
but that was about it.

282
00:25:39,553 --> 00:25:40,984
While filling out this application,

283
00:25:41,823 --> 00:25:44,853
I reflected back on the times we spent together.

284
00:25:46,724 --> 00:25:48,993
I only wanted to remember the good times,

285
00:25:49,333 --> 00:25:52,603
but the painful memories kept...

286
00:25:53,234 --> 00:25:54,364
popping into my mind.

287
00:25:55,874 --> 00:25:57,533
The moment when I found Cha Eun Sae's dead body.

288
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:01,103
The moment I found out you cheated on me...

289
00:26:01,874 --> 00:26:05,214
and the time when I nearly died with Yoo Yoon Young.

290
00:26:09,654 --> 00:26:10,853
Now,

291
00:26:12,283 --> 00:26:15,454
the miserable memories we share certainly outnumber...

292
00:26:16,793 --> 00:26:18,364
our happy memories.

293
00:26:19,593 --> 00:26:20,724
Let's not...

294
00:26:21,833 --> 00:26:23,263
make each other miserable anymore.

295
00:26:28,904 --> 00:26:30,934
There must be a reason I didn't die with Yoo Yoon Young...

296
00:26:32,073 --> 00:26:33,743
and survived.

297
00:26:36,013 --> 00:26:37,313
I want to start afresh...

298
00:26:38,444 --> 00:26:39,884

Fine, let's get a divorce.

- I need some time to process this. - No.

304
00:26:55,934 --> 00:26:56,993
I'll move out.

305
00:26:57,293 --> 00:26:58,603
I don't want to stay here.

306
00:26:58,603 --> 00:27:00,204
Where will you stay?

307
00:27:00,204 --> 00:27:01,464
I'll stay with Ae Na...

00:28:10,174 --> 00:28:12,543
I understand that you want to get drunk today,

314
00:28:13,073 --> 00:28:14,343
but slow down.

315
00:28:14,503 --> 00:28:18,114
Don't you pity me? Don't take my beer away from me.

316
00:28:20,743 --> 00:28:23,083
You decided to divorce your husband and moved out.

317
00:28:23,083 --> 00:28:24,253
Don't act pitiful.

318
00:28:25,424 --> 00:28:28,523
So, how do you feel now that you really are getting a divorce?

319
00:28:31,454 --> 00:28:32,493
I feel like...

320
00:28:34,523 --> 00:28:36,464
I'm a nobody now.

321
00:28:38,904 --> 00:28:42,303
I decided to marry him because I thought...

322
00:28:42,303 --> 00:28:44,603
I'd never meet another man who loved me as much as he did,

323
00:28:46,343 --> 00:28:47,704
but being called...

324
00:28:49,644 --> 00:28:51,674
a business mogul's daughter-in-law and an artist's wife...

325
00:28:52,343 --> 00:28:53,583
wasn't so bad.

326
00:28:54,944 --> 00:28:58,313
But more importantly, it was really nice...

327
00:28:58,654 --> 00:28:59,853
to have a family.

328
00:29:01,083 --> 00:29:02,793
If I still had a solid career as a reporter,

329
00:29:03,523 --> 00:29:05,593
I'd try to hold out, at all costs.

330
00:29:07,464 --> 00:29:08,533
My gosh.

331
00:29:09,634 --> 00:29:11,234
I've been arrested,

332
00:29:12,563 --> 00:29:14,033
and my show got canceled,

333
00:29:16,533 --> 00:29:18,333
so I'll get fired for sure.

334
00:29:20,944 --> 00:29:22,743
On top of that, my marriage failed too,

335
00:29:23,843 --> 00:29:27,144
so I can't help but feel so pathetic and small.

336

You rarely talk about what's on your mind,

338
00:29:35,293 --> 00:29:38,053
but you're telling me everything you're thinking.

339
00:29:39,164 --> 00:29:41,023
The same goes for asking me if you could stay with me...

340
00:29:41,023 --> 00:29:42,493
for a few days.

341
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:45,603
Hey.

342
00:29:46,464 --> 00:29:50,874
Why is it that I hate it so much when I feel alone?

343
00:29:50,874 --> 00:29:52,444
Hey, you aren't alone.

344
00:29:52,644 --> 00:29:55,644
You have me, and you have Detective Kim too.

345
00:30:01,043 --> 00:30:02,083
Gosh, I don't know.

346
00:30:03,253 --> 00:30:05,924
Hey, be honest.

347
00:30:06,424 --> 00:30:09,053
You were afraid you'd want to go to him if you were alone,

348
00:30:10,053 --> 00:30:11,154

What are you up to?

351
00:30:58,416 --> 00:31:00,926
I was debating whether or not...

352
00:31:01,899 --> 00:31:02,970
to call you.

353
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:04,799
I have a favor to ask.

354
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:06,740
You should never ask for favors over the phone.

355
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,270
You must do it in person.

356
00:31:09,869 --> 00:31:11,210
I need to ask you something too.

357
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:14,280
Let's meet now.

358
00:31:24,389 --> 00:31:26,420
I was wondering why you were with Ms. Yang at this hour.

359
00:31:26,659 --> 00:31:27,889
I guess you've been drinking.

360
00:31:30,089 --> 00:31:31,359
So? What do you need?

361
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:34,399
When you searched Yoo Yoon Young's home and office,

362
00:31:34,659 --> 00:31:36,869
you found recordings of my sessions with her.

363
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:39,700
Can you send me the files?

364
00:31:40,069 --> 00:31:42,170
- Why do you need them? - There's one last thing...

365
00:31:42,869 --> 00:31:44,710
I want to check.

366
00:31:47,409 --> 00:31:48,510
Okay, sure.

367
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:53,520
And what's your question?

368
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:56,520
What's your plan?

369
00:31:57,990 --> 00:31:59,260
Your program got canceled,

370
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:01,020
and the journalist association expelled you.

371
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:03,859
You lost your job...

372
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:06,329
and your husband too...

373
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,270
I was being too nosy. Pretend you didn't hear that.

374
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:22,379
Tomorrow,

375
00:32:23,609 --> 00:32:25,010
I'll hand in my resignation.

376
00:32:26,649 --> 00:32:28,220
I don't want to get fired.

377
00:32:31,619 --> 00:32:32,690
And...

378
00:32:35,089 --> 00:32:36,490
I left home.

379
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:40,399
I asked for a divorce.

380
00:32:47,569 --> 00:32:50,770
I think I went back to being a kid.

381
00:32:52,379 --> 00:32:54,510
I wanted to be such a cool adult.

382
00:32:55,879 --> 00:32:57,250
You're not a kid.

383
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:59,079
You got this far.

384
00:33:00,049 --> 00:33:01,849
There's not much to being a cool adult.

385
00:33:03,119 --> 00:33:04,920
You're cool if you get through stuff.

386
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:14,559
I feel lost.

387
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:19,340
I don't know what to do for a living,

388
00:33:19,639 --> 00:33:22,040
or what to do with my life.

389
00:33:24,369 --> 00:33:27,710
But I'll get through it a day at a time.

390
00:33:29,849 --> 00:33:31,849
That's the only way to get back on my feet.

391
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:35,750
Until everything's sorted out,

392
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:38,820
I'll be cautious.

393
00:33:42,829 --> 00:33:44,059
Can you do the same?

394
00:33:57,210 --> 00:33:58,909
I don't know how long it'll take.

395
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,909
But will you...

396
00:34:04,909 --> 00:34:06,020
wait for me?

397
00:34:15,059 --> 00:34:16,690
Don't make me wait too long.

398
00:34:44,389 --> 00:34:46,059
There's no fever.

399
00:34:47,989 --> 00:34:48,989
Jung Won.

400
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:53,400
I just feel a bit achy.

401
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:58,469
I made bean sprout soup. Have some.

402
00:34:58,570 --> 00:34:59,699
And take today off.

403
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,199
You can resign tomorrow.

404
00:35:04,369 --> 00:35:05,469
If I put it off,

405
00:35:06,309 --> 00:35:07,639
I'll only become more reluctant.

406
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:11,050
I won't take long to get ready. Let's go in together.

407
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,690
(Seo Jung Won)

408
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:25,696
You're too quick for your own good.

409
00:35:26,256 --> 00:35:28,026
You're not officially dismissed yet.

410
00:35:28,455 --> 00:35:30,754
Exactly. Why must you resign?

411
00:35:31,424 --> 00:35:33,294
Why is she so darn stubborn?

412
00:35:35,825 --> 00:35:36,964
You can have this.

413
00:35:41,095 --> 00:35:43,234
You wanted this, right? Here.

414
00:35:44,035 --> 00:35:45,165
Goodness.

415
00:35:45,634 --> 00:35:47,475
You value your pride too much.

416
00:35:47,475 --> 00:35:49,004
You should stay as long as you can.

417
00:35:49,674 --> 00:35:52,044
I could try, but I'll be fired this week.

418
00:35:52,614 --> 00:35:54,314
I don't want to wither away,

419
00:35:55,015 --> 00:35:56,645
wondering when my last day will be.

420
00:35:59,584 --> 00:36:00,614
Us two.

421
00:36:01,614 --> 00:36:04,355
We fought quite a lot, didn't we?

422
00:36:04,424 --> 00:36:07,254
Why are you going down memory lane...

423
00:36:07,254 --> 00:36:08,825
like we'll never meet again?

424
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:12,435
You should sneak in and pack your stuff at night.

425
00:36:13,064 --> 00:36:15,964
Do you have to sour the mood first thing in the morning?

426
00:36:17,564 --> 00:36:19,975
I don't have anything to give you.

427
00:36:21,375 --> 00:36:23,975
I'll give you the list of stories I wanted to report.

428
00:36:24,774 --> 00:36:26,774
I won't take anything less than a scoop.

429
00:36:27,245 --> 00:36:28,444
The scar...

430
00:36:28,944 --> 00:36:31,714
Mo Hyung Taek showed saying he got from his daughter's attack.

431
00:36:32,345 --> 00:36:35,685
Mo Soo Rin insists her father made that up.

432
00:36:37,455 --> 00:36:39,125
- Are you sure? - If that's true,

433
00:36:39,125 --> 00:36:40,555
this could take him down.

434
00:36:41,254 --> 00:36:44,495
Are you saying we should believe a serial killer?

435
00:36:44,524 --> 00:36:47,694
The whole country knows Mo Soo Rin's a psychopath.

436
00:36:48,294 --> 00:36:49,734
Not even the police will believe it.

437
00:36:50,064 --> 00:36:52,834
I'm not telling you to believe it. Look into it with suspicion.

438
00:36:56,944 --> 00:36:57,975
See you.

439
00:37:31,475 --> 00:37:33,774
The chairman is waiting to see you.

440
00:37:37,714 --> 00:37:39,355
You were humiliated and dishonored,

441
00:37:39,355 --> 00:37:40,984
so you can no longer report.

442
00:37:40,984 --> 00:37:44,024
And you don't have the temperament to stay at home.

443
00:37:45,794 --> 00:37:47,225
Start work next week...

444
00:37:47,654 --> 00:37:48,825
in PR.

445
00:37:49,765 --> 00:37:50,794
Father.

446
00:37:52,024 --> 00:37:53,464
I moved out.

447
00:37:55,035 --> 00:37:56,305
I asked for a divorce.

448
00:37:57,305 --> 00:38:00,375
I'm waiting until Woo Jae's ready.

449
00:38:03,444 --> 00:38:04,975
You won't sue, then?

450
00:38:05,605 --> 00:38:07,444
- No. - The terms of divorce.

451
00:38:07,745 --> 00:38:09,714
Can Woo Jae make up the list?

452
00:38:10,285 --> 00:38:11,314
Yes.

453
00:38:11,845 --> 00:38:15,185
I'll agree to the conditions you and Woo Jae want.

454
00:38:15,754 --> 00:38:17,584
You must sign a confidentiality agreement,

455
00:38:17,955 --> 00:38:20,325
and a contract that limits the alimony.

456
00:38:20,654 --> 00:38:21,825
I'll do that.

457
00:38:23,725 --> 00:38:26,495
People go against their word all the time.

458
00:38:28,665 --> 00:38:30,464
What you just agreed to.

459
00:38:31,165 --> 00:38:32,404
(Recording)

460
00:38:39,745 --> 00:38:41,274
I will not sue.

461
00:38:41,774 --> 00:38:43,745
I will follow the conditions of divorce.

462
00:38:44,084 --> 00:38:45,214
I'll also sign...

463
00:38:45,714 --> 00:38:48,355
a confidentiality agreement and a contract.

464
00:39:00,435 --> 00:39:01,834
I'd like to go now.

465
00:39:04,765 --> 00:39:06,075
I'm sorry...

466
00:39:07,234 --> 00:39:10,774
for causing you distress due to my shortcomings.

467
00:39:40,234 --> 00:39:41,305
Jung Won.

468
00:39:45,075 --> 00:39:46,075
Are you okay?

469
00:39:49,314 --> 00:39:50,584
(Seo Jung Won)

470
00:39:52,384 --> 00:39:53,455
You quit your job?

471
00:39:53,955 --> 00:39:54,955
Yes.

472
00:40:06,665 --> 00:40:08,334
What was the rush?

473
00:40:08,834 --> 00:40:10,004
You could've...

474
00:40:11,205 --> 00:40:12,935
let me tell my father.

475
00:40:14,634 --> 00:40:16,345
You're deathly pale.

476
00:40:17,504 --> 00:40:18,605
I'll take you home.

477
00:40:44,035 --> 00:40:45,134
Jung Won.

478
00:40:48,435 --> 00:40:49,504
Jung Won.

479
00:40:51,975 --> 00:40:52,975
Jung Won.

480
00:40:54,415 --> 00:40:55,444
Jung Won.

481
00:40:58,285 --> 00:40:59,285
Jung Won.

482
00:41:00,214 --> 00:41:01,254
Jung Won.

483
00:41:16,938 --> 00:41:19,509
She's suffering from dehydration due to overwork and stress.

484
00:41:19,509 --> 00:41:20,809
So she lost consciousness.

485
00:41:21,548 --> 00:41:24,719
She's all right for now. So don't worry.

486
00:41:24,719 --> 00:41:26,119
Even so, once she wakes up,

487
00:41:26,119 --> 00:41:28,119
I'd like her to take a thorough medical checkup.

488
00:41:28,119 --> 00:41:30,418
Sure. I'll coordinate with other departments for that.

489
00:41:30,458 --> 00:41:31,458
Other departments?

490
00:41:33,128 --> 00:41:34,429
Are you not aware of her condition?

491
00:42:00,389 --> 00:42:01,489
Are you all right?

492
00:42:02,088 --> 00:42:03,659
Right before Yoon Young died,

493
00:42:04,088 --> 00:42:06,659
what was the last thing she said?

494
00:42:06,659 --> 00:42:08,728
She said she had failed, but she didn't have any regrets.

495
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:11,728
Woo Jae wasn't the only one she loved.

496
00:42:14,128 --> 00:42:15,769
She loved me more than him.

497
00:42:16,969 --> 00:42:18,369
That's what she told me.

498
00:42:18,568 --> 00:42:21,139
She said I was the most precious person in her life.

499
00:42:22,369 --> 00:42:23,809
And that I came first.

500
00:42:27,148 --> 00:42:29,619
I already told you about her the other day.

501
00:42:29,619 --> 00:42:32,449
She didn't directly say that to you.

502
00:42:33,389 --> 00:42:35,619
There's no way she betrayed me.

503
00:42:36,219 --> 00:42:37,289
I...

504
00:42:38,759 --> 00:42:39,889
trust her.

505
00:42:42,329 --> 00:42:44,199
Why are you pleading the Fifth?

506
00:42:44,199 --> 00:42:45,759
Why are you not cooperating with the investigation?

507
00:42:45,759 --> 00:42:46,929
The longer you keep this up,

508
00:42:47,728 --> 00:42:49,298
the worse this will be for you.

509
00:42:49,369 --> 00:42:51,438
I really didn't stab my dad.

510
00:42:52,199 --> 00:42:53,338
Please believe me.

511
00:42:54,568 --> 00:42:56,838
Do you know what kind of monster he is?

512
00:42:57,208 --> 00:42:59,548
He framed Park Jin Soo as the arsonist...

513
00:42:59,949 --> 00:43:02,608
when he knew I started the fire. He still pinned it on Park Jin Soo.

514
00:43:03,318 --> 00:43:05,378
Please expose the truth about him.

515
00:43:05,778 --> 00:43:07,289
I feel so wronged. I can't let him get away with this.

516
00:43:08,188 --> 00:43:09,248
You feel wronged?

517
00:43:10,358 --> 00:43:12,559
I didn't stab him. Of course, I feel wronged.

518
00:43:12,559 --> 00:43:13,789
Don't you think...

519
00:43:15,028 --> 00:43:16,458
the victims who died in vain at the factory...

520
00:43:16,458 --> 00:43:18,429
would feel more wronged than you?

521
00:43:19,199 --> 00:43:21,298
Add Jin Myung Sook and Cha Eun Sae to the list of victims.

522
00:43:23,199 --> 00:43:24,739
The victims' human rights are more important...

523
00:43:24,739 --> 00:43:26,309
than a criminal's human rights.

524
00:43:26,309 --> 00:43:28,409
So don't you casually say that you feel wronged.

525
00:43:28,409 --> 00:43:30,208
You don't have the right to say that.

526
00:43:35,378 --> 00:43:37,079
There's something I didn't tell you...

527
00:43:38,548 --> 00:43:40,918
regarding the fire incident.

528
00:43:44,858 --> 00:43:47,489
(14 years ago)

529
00:43:53,199 --> 00:43:54,469
What are you doing, Mo Soo Rin?

530
00:43:57,838 --> 00:43:58,938
(Effective Rat Poison)

531
00:44:22,489 --> 00:44:24,228
This is Soo Rin.

532
00:44:25,059 --> 00:44:26,728
You're at the factory, right?

533
00:44:27,228 --> 00:44:30,469
There's something I must tell you. So meet me at the factory.

534
00:44:38,478 --> 00:44:41,009
After witnessing what you did, I had to tell our teacher...

535
00:44:41,009 --> 00:44:42,708
because animal abuse is a crime.

536
00:45:01,929 --> 00:45:04,438
This was a major tragedy. The fire incident can't be seen...

537
00:45:04,438 --> 00:45:05,668
as a silly prank by 19-year-olds.

538
00:45:05,769 --> 00:45:08,668
Twelve people died, and two people were injured.

539
00:45:08,668 --> 00:45:10,608
And those two victims died in the end.

540
00:45:11,639 --> 00:45:13,449
If Lee Na Ri were still alive,

541
00:45:13,449 --> 00:45:16,978
she would have been the same age as you and enjoying her life.

542
00:45:23,318 --> 00:45:24,358
Detective Kim.

543
00:45:28,528 --> 00:45:30,358
I don't think Na Ri died that night.

544
00:45:54,449 --> 00:45:56,088
Isn't this splendid?

545
00:45:57,659 --> 00:45:59,019
We created those flames.

546
00:46:00,458 --> 00:46:01,588
Right.

547
00:46:09,938 --> 00:46:11,438
You saw her running away?

548
00:46:14,869 --> 00:46:17,139
Are you sure it was Lee Na Ri?

549
00:46:17,539 --> 00:46:19,648
It happened a very long time ago, so I can't be certain.

550
00:46:19,648 --> 00:46:20,748
But I was certain that night...

551
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:22,449
that it was Na Ri.

(Reporter Seo Jung Won)

553
00:46:46,369 --> 00:46:47,369
The person you have reached is unavailable.

554
00:46:47,369 --> 00:46:48,969
You'll be directed to...

555
00:47:03,789 --> 00:47:04,958
What happened?

556
00:47:04,958 --> 00:47:06,858
You woke up for a moment and went back to sleep.

557
00:47:08,628 --> 00:47:11,099
You must not have gotten any rest. You even passed out.

558
00:47:17,769 --> 00:47:20,068
You need to take a couple of thorough exams.

559
00:47:20,068 --> 00:47:21,108
That's not necessary.

560
00:47:21,539 --> 00:47:23,239
I don't have a job to work hard at now.

561
00:47:23,239 --> 00:47:24,838
I'm not asking just for your sake.

562
00:47:26,579 --> 00:47:27,648
Remember what you said?

563
00:47:29,248 --> 00:47:31,719
There had to be a reason why you survived instead of dying.

564
00:47:37,818 --> 00:47:38,918
You were right.

565
00:47:40,659 --> 00:47:41,728
You and I...

566
00:47:44,358 --> 00:47:45,659
will be parents.

567
00:47:47,469 --> 00:47:49,838
I couldn't believe it. So I had to ask multiple times.

568
00:47:50,969 --> 00:47:52,298
After hearing the news yesterday,

569
00:47:54,838 --> 00:47:56,139
it felt like my heart was going to explode.

570
00:47:56,139 --> 00:47:57,409
So I looked up at the sky.

571
00:47:58,409 --> 00:48:01,778
Then I finally realized how it felt when people said they didn't know...

572
00:48:02,579 --> 00:48:03,949
whether to cry or laugh.

573
00:48:05,978 --> 00:48:07,349
It brought tears to my eyes.

574
00:48:09,989 --> 00:48:10,989
I was so emotional.

575
00:48:12,588 --> 00:48:14,128
I couldn't control my emotions.

576
00:48:26,199 --> 00:48:28,838
I was determined to do what you asked of me.

577
00:48:28,838 --> 00:48:30,579
I even filled out the divorce paper.

578
00:48:32,739 --> 00:48:35,878
How can I let you go now that I know you're carrying my child?

579
00:48:38,248 --> 00:48:40,648
I know that you're probably sick of me asking you to stay.

580
00:48:40,648 --> 00:48:42,918
I even hate myself for it. But I...

581
00:48:47,789 --> 00:48:49,259
I want to be a good father.

582
00:48:58,199 --> 00:48:59,639
Let me be clear.

583
00:49:00,168 --> 00:49:01,509
Nothing will change.

584
00:49:02,338 --> 00:49:04,938
If you don't agree to a divorce, I'll file a divorce suit.

585
00:49:28,898 --> 00:49:29,998
No...

586
00:49:31,798 --> 00:49:33,099
What am I going to do?

587
00:49:45,918 --> 00:49:47,918
What will I do?

588
00:49:59,228 --> 00:50:00,798
(Reporter Seo Jung Won)

589
00:50:01,099 --> 00:50:02,498
Why can't I reach her?

590
00:50:03,199 --> 00:50:04,239
Tae Heon.

591
00:50:04,838 --> 00:50:06,938
I asked Detective Bong.

592
00:50:06,938 --> 00:50:07,938
It's just like Mo Soo Rin said.

593
00:50:07,938 --> 00:50:09,708
They had to hire part-timers on the day of the incident.

594
00:50:09,708 --> 00:50:11,478
So they couldn't get an accurate headcount.

595
00:50:11,478 --> 00:50:12,579
What about Lee Na Ri's corpse?

596
00:50:12,579 --> 00:50:14,208
That's odd too.

597
00:50:14,208 --> 00:50:16,949
The corpse was too damaged for a DNA test.

598
00:50:18,619 --> 00:50:20,349
This is going to bother me even more now.

599
00:50:20,349 --> 00:50:21,418
But...

600
00:50:21,889 --> 00:50:23,958
if Lee Na Ri had escaped from the factory,

601
00:50:23,958 --> 00:50:25,688
she would have gone to her family.

602
00:50:25,688 --> 00:50:27,789
It makes no sense that she just went missing.

603
00:50:27,789 --> 00:50:30,728
Even Detective Bong said Mo Soo Rin must have been mistaken.

604
00:50:32,498 --> 00:50:35,199
I should contact Lee Na Ri's family who emigrated out of Korea.

605
00:50:35,668 --> 00:50:38,469
I'd like to eat the top-grade Hanwoo for dinner today.

606
00:50:39,438 --> 00:50:40,469
What?

607
00:50:40,969 --> 00:50:42,139
Did you get enough intel for a free meal?

608
00:50:45,778 --> 00:50:48,608
It's Lee's brother next to her. Guess who he is now.

609
00:50:49,849 --> 00:50:51,849
I found this picture...

610
00:50:51,849 --> 00:50:54,688
at Zeus' house. Right in his house. You know?

611
00:50:57,458 --> 00:51:00,588
Are you saying this boy is Lee Ba Reun?

612
00:51:00,889 --> 00:51:02,889
Turns out, Lee Ba Reun was Lee Na Ri's brother.

613
00:51:02,889 --> 00:51:05,128
I already checked his family relation certificate.

614
00:51:05,128 --> 00:51:06,159
Well done, right?

615
00:51:10,668 --> 00:51:11,869
Hey, I'm off.

616
00:51:17,079 --> 00:51:18,438
Hey, Jung Won.

617
00:51:19,039 --> 00:51:21,608
My gosh. You still look so pale.

618
00:51:22,708 --> 00:51:23,778
Did you have dinner?

619
00:51:23,978 --> 00:51:25,019
Yes, I've eaten.

620
00:51:25,849 --> 00:51:26,849
My goodness.

621
00:51:27,719 --> 00:51:29,548
You told your husband you wanted a divorce and moved out.

622
00:51:30,318 --> 00:51:32,619
Did you have to faint in front of your husband?

623
00:51:34,458 --> 00:51:36,929
Gosh, why is marriage so complicated?

624
00:51:38,498 --> 00:51:40,668
I'm not sure how you'll take this,

625
00:51:41,798 --> 00:51:42,929
but for some strange reason,

626
00:51:43,898 --> 00:51:47,139
I feel like you and Woo Jae won't split up after all.

627
00:51:49,108 --> 00:51:50,838
Did Woo Jae tell you something?

628
00:51:51,809 --> 00:51:52,809
What?

629
00:51:57,748 --> 00:51:59,048
Oh, it's Detective Kim.

630
00:52:00,019 --> 00:52:01,019
Ae Na.

631
00:52:01,789 --> 00:52:03,958
- My gosh. It's been a while. - Jung Won is inside, right?

632
00:52:04,259 --> 00:52:06,019
I guess she wasn't expecting you.

633
00:52:06,219 --> 00:52:07,329
Come on in.

634
00:52:08,628 --> 00:52:09,858
Hey, I couldn't reach you.

635
00:52:10,998 --> 00:52:12,329
I had a busy day.

636
00:52:12,498 --> 00:52:14,168
Why were you busy? Aren't you unemployed now?

637
00:52:18,599 --> 00:52:19,898
Here, it's what you asked for.

638
00:52:21,139 --> 00:52:24,139
You said you wanted the recordings of your sessions.

639
00:52:24,139 --> 00:52:25,139
Here.

640
00:52:26,679 --> 00:52:27,679
Thanks.

641
00:52:28,349 --> 00:52:31,278
I'm going to have a beer. Do you want one too, Detective Kim?

642
00:52:32,119 --> 00:52:33,119
You too, Jung Won?

643
00:52:36,188 --> 00:52:38,119
Gosh, what was I thinking?

644
00:52:38,858 --> 00:52:40,088
You fainted.

645
00:52:40,088 --> 00:52:41,188
She fainted?

646
00:52:43,559 --> 00:52:47,269
Oh, Jung Won drank too much yesterday.

647
00:52:47,269 --> 00:52:48,628
She blacked out.

648
00:52:49,699 --> 00:52:52,668
Well, if you drove here, you can't have a beer.

649
00:52:52,798 --> 00:52:53,938
Do you want something else?

650
00:52:54,239 --> 00:52:55,438
No, I'm good.

651
00:52:55,438 --> 00:52:57,179
I'll talk to her about Lee Ba Reun and leave right away.

652
00:52:58,009 --> 00:52:59,039
Wait.

653
00:52:59,778 --> 00:53:00,809
What is it?

654
00:53:01,978 --> 00:53:03,179
Can I hear it too?

655
00:53:08,188 --> 00:53:09,289
You need to see this.

656
00:53:13,528 --> 00:53:16,088
Lee Ba Reun is Lee Na Ri's brother.

657
00:53:21,298 --> 00:53:23,369
That's why he was looking into Mo Hyung Taek.

658
00:53:23,498 --> 00:53:24,599
He knew...

659
00:53:25,969 --> 00:53:27,639
there was a secret behind the fire case.

660
00:53:27,639 --> 00:53:28,769
The problem is...

661
00:53:29,438 --> 00:53:31,608
that Mo Soo Rin thinks she saw Lee Na Ri...

662
00:53:32,278 --> 00:53:33,579
running away from the fire.

663
00:53:35,648 --> 00:53:38,449
So Lee Na Ri didn't die in the fire?

664
00:53:39,978 --> 00:53:41,148
My gosh.

665
00:53:41,588 --> 00:53:45,119
If Ba Reun finds out about this, he'll be utterly shocked.

666
00:53:45,818 --> 00:53:47,688
But if Lee Na Ri didn't die back then,

667
00:53:48,358 --> 00:53:50,458
how come no one has seen her since then?

668
00:53:50,958 --> 00:53:53,128
Even if she managed to escape, she probably died...

669
00:53:53,929 --> 00:53:55,929
because of the toxic gases or some other reason.

670
00:53:56,068 --> 00:53:57,938
I know. I don't think she's alive.

671
00:53:58,199 --> 00:54:01,208
But if she really escaped like Mo said,

672
00:54:01,809 --> 00:54:04,139
and if her body still hasn't been found,

673
00:54:04,878 --> 00:54:06,509
we can't neglect the possibility of another crime.

674
00:54:08,108 --> 00:54:10,148
First, we're going to contact her parents in Canada...

675
00:54:10,148 --> 00:54:11,648
to look for Lee Ba Reun.

676
00:54:11,719 --> 00:54:13,378
If you hear from him, let me know right away.

677
00:54:13,889 --> 00:54:15,188
You too, Ms. Yang. Okay?

678
00:54:15,588 --> 00:54:16,619
Yes, of course.

679
00:54:17,719 --> 00:54:19,389
I hope Ba Reun hears this soon.

680
00:54:20,228 --> 00:54:21,429
Hey, you look tired.

681
00:54:23,929 --> 00:54:25,998
- I'll be off, then. - You're leaving?

682
00:54:27,998 --> 00:54:29,128
Hey, he's leaving.

683
00:54:33,438 --> 00:54:34,708
You won't see me out?

684
00:54:35,438 --> 00:54:36,469
Hey, go.

685
00:54:57,028 --> 00:54:59,798
Hey, this isn't being careful. You're being so cold to me.

686
00:55:03,168 --> 00:55:04,639
Do you know what this reminds me of?

687
00:55:04,898 --> 00:55:06,539
The time we met again after three years.

688
00:55:06,539 --> 00:55:07,809
You're acting just like you did that day.

689
00:55:09,809 --> 00:55:11,478
How come you suddenly changed in a matter of a few days?

690
00:55:11,478 --> 00:55:12,708
Did I do something wrong?

691
00:55:16,579 --> 00:55:17,579
No.

692
00:55:17,719 --> 00:55:20,489
My gosh. This will only make me more impatient.

693
00:55:21,818 --> 00:55:24,958
Forget being careful. I want to just carry you on my back...

694
00:55:26,088 --> 00:55:27,389
and elope with you.

695
00:55:37,239 --> 00:55:38,298
Something must've happened.

696
00:55:40,438 --> 00:55:41,509
No, nothing happened.

697
00:55:48,108 --> 00:55:50,478
It's your father's death anniversary tomorrow.

698
00:55:53,119 --> 00:55:56,148
You used to only put cheese cake on the table at his memorial ceremony.

699
00:55:58,719 --> 00:56:00,559
It was this time of year. I remember now.

700
00:56:04,159 --> 00:56:06,998
Are you feeling down because you've been reminded of your father?

701
00:56:11,498 --> 00:56:12,998
I won't ask for anything else.

702
00:56:15,168 --> 00:56:17,978
Just pick up when I call you. All right?

703
00:56:19,309 --> 00:56:20,809
If not, my mind will wander off, worrying about you.

704
00:56:25,478 --> 00:56:26,519
I'm off.

705
00:57:06,519 --> 00:57:09,188
You can hear the heart beating, right?

706
00:57:11,329 --> 00:57:13,998
The baby is healthy. No issues.

707
00:57:18,099 --> 00:57:19,099
Doctor.

708
00:57:19,869 --> 00:57:20,909
Yes.

709
00:57:21,708 --> 00:57:22,708
Can I...

710
00:57:23,568 --> 00:57:25,539
still get an abortion?

711
00:58:21,469 --> 00:58:22,699
Well done.

712
00:58:22,929 --> 00:58:24,539
- I'll see you next week. - All right.

713
00:58:29,469 --> 00:58:32,009
That book. Didn't your husband write it?

714
00:58:32,809 --> 00:58:34,748
Oh, that's right.

715
00:58:36,748 --> 00:58:38,219
I read it too.

716
00:58:39,778 --> 00:58:41,188
It wasn't my cup of tea.

717
00:58:42,119 --> 00:58:43,119
Really?

718
00:58:44,219 --> 00:58:45,958
But I guess you liked it,

719
00:58:46,188 --> 00:58:47,659
seeing how you carry it around in your bag.

720
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:49,159
("Desire" by Seol Woo Jae)

721
00:58:49,159 --> 00:58:51,329
It is my favorite one out of all the novels my husband wrote.

722
00:58:52,199 --> 00:58:53,798
I started reading it again.

723
00:59:03,239 --> 00:59:05,539
"I failed, but I have no regrets..."

724
00:59:05,639 --> 00:59:07,378
"because it was my dream, my love,"

725
00:59:07,608 --> 00:59:09,509
"and my innocent desire."

726
00:59:11,048 --> 00:59:14,048
I must say though, I really liked this sentence at the end.

727
00:59:14,548 --> 00:59:16,048
I failed,

728
00:59:17,719 --> 00:59:18,889
but I have no regrets.

729
00:59:29,528 --> 00:59:31,739
("Desire")

730
00:59:37,208 --> 00:59:38,639
(It was my dream, my love, and my innocent desire.)

731
00:59:42,778 --> 00:59:44,519
(It was my dream, my love, and my innocent desire.)

732
00:59:54,128 --> 00:59:55,929
(October 6, 2023, 7:15pm)

733
01:01:11,469 --> 01:01:12,739
It was the exact same knife.

734
01:01:14,809 --> 01:01:16,338
The man who killed Cha Eun Sae...

735
01:01:17,608 --> 01:01:19,239
killed my father too.

736
01:02:12,903 --> 01:02:15,896
(Nothing Uncovered)

737
01:02:16,075 --> 01:02:17,575
You said you were drinking alone in your studio...

738
01:02:18,015 --> 01:02:19,945
at the time of Cha Eun Sae's death.

739
01:02:20,374 --> 01:02:21,515
Why are you asking about that all of a sudden?

740
01:02:21,515 --> 01:02:24,115
I thought I'd never have a grandchild.

741
01:02:24,115 --> 01:02:26,555
I will raise my child well with only the best things.

742
01:02:26,854 --> 01:02:28,854
I will put the past behind me now.

743
01:02:29,354 --> 01:02:31,524
The real reason I dragged you into this...

744
01:02:31,524 --> 01:02:32,524
was something else.

745
01:02:32,524 --> 01:02:34,995
I met your father.

746
01:02:35,465 --> 01:02:38,365
Jung Won has changed. Didn't you sense it?

747
01:02:38,794 --> 01:02:40,865
I've had a change of heart.

748
01:02:41,365 --> 01:02:42,405
Forget everything.

749
01:02:43,465 --> 01:02:45,474
Help me so I don't have to suffer so much.
