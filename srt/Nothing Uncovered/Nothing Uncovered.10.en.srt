00:12:13,197 --> 00:12:15,637
so I can't do it myself. You understand, don't you?

183
00:12:15,836 --> 00:12:16,907
Yes.

184
00:12:18,076 --> 00:12:19,137
But...

185
00:12:20,437 --> 00:12:23,106
Jung Won mentioned an accomplice...

186
00:12:23,106 --> 00:12:24,517
during her news interview.

187
00:12:29,116 --> 00:12:30,187
That won't do.

188
00:12:31,157 --> 00:12:33,557
I must do it myself, if the plan is to work.

189
00:12:33,557 --> 00:12:34,927
No, that's too dangerous.

190
00:12:41,697 --> 00:12:42,697
I'll...

191
00:12:43,996 --> 00:12:45,037
do it.

192
00:12:47,397 --> 00:12:48,637
Thanks, Soo Rin.

193
00:12:52,437 --> 00:12:53,606

195
00:13:07,417 --> 00:13:08,456
Hey.

196
00:13:10,057 --> 00:13:11,927
The video of Ms. Seo at the scene...

197
00:13:11,927 --> 00:13:13,557
was sent by courier anonymously.

198
00:13:14,197 --> 00:13:18,137
They found blood on the sole of the shoes she wore in the video.

199
00:13:18,137 --> 00:13:20,067
- Cha Eun Sae's blood? - Yes.

200
00:13:22,466 --> 00:13:25,576
Captain's putting crazy pressure to find the murder weapon.

201
00:13:28,277 --> 00:13:29,476
What about what I asked?

202
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:31,246
You were right about that.

203
00:13:34,616 --> 00:13:36,216
When and where is she headed?

204
00:13:36,216 --> 00:13:38,317
A flight to New York leaving at 11am tomorrow.

205
00:13:39,917 --> 00:13:42,927
You know you'll lose your job if you do anything else, right?

206
00:13:44,427 --> 00:13:46,326
Then I'll spend the rest of my life...

207
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:47,797
in a batting range or driving range.

208
00:13:48,697 --> 00:13:49,966
Are you insane?

209
00:13:56,437 --> 00:13:57,466
Hello, captain.

210
00:14:01,147 --> 00:14:03,307
I'm with him now. Why?

211
00:14:03,307 --> 00:14:04,746
Can he come back to work?

212
00:14:15,157 --> 00:14:16,326
Goodness.

213
00:14:24,836 --> 00:14:27,067
I got nothing on you in the last inspection,

214
00:14:27,067 --> 00:14:28,736
and it left a bad taste in my mouth.

215
00:14:29,106 --> 00:14:31,937
You scored big this time.

216
00:14:32,606 --> 00:14:33,836
I'm a bit busy right now.

217
00:14:34,947 --> 00:14:36,376
Can we do this tomorrow?

218
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:38,616
I'm sorry you're busy.

219
00:14:39,047 --> 00:14:40,716
I plan to keep you here tonight.

220
00:14:44,287 --> 00:14:46,256
Let's begin.

221
00:14:59,297 --> 00:15:02,106
When did you decide to kill Cha Eun Sae?

222
00:15:04,006 --> 00:15:05,706
I never decided...

223
00:15:06,376 --> 00:15:07,777
to kill Cha Eun Sae.

224
00:15:09,777 --> 00:15:10,846
I didn't kill her.

225
00:15:11,517 --> 00:15:12,817
I just read the news.

226
00:15:13,447 --> 00:15:16,287
Alongside a report saying your show got canceled,

227
00:15:16,716 --> 00:15:19,387
I found one that said the journalist association...

228
00:15:19,387 --> 00:15:20,956
wants your membership revoked.

229
00:15:24,626 --> 00:15:27,897
As a journalist, don't you want to do what's right...

230
00:15:27,897 --> 00:15:28,966
in the end?

231
00:15:30,197 --> 00:15:31,697
Let's not drag this on.

232
00:15:32,437 --> 00:15:33,496
Confess.

236
00:16:11,336 --> 00:16:12,677

238
00:16:14,576 --> 00:16:16,147

- You did well. - Thank you.

240
00:16:17,746 --> 00:16:18,777
Good job.

241
00:16:21,787 --> 00:16:24,417
The two of you who might be watching right now...

242
00:16:24,787 --> 00:16:27,417
must know the answer to all these questions.

243
00:16:28,157 --> 00:16:31,697
Please cooperate with the police investigation...

244
00:16:32,027 --> 00:16:35,397
and tell them the truth.

245
00:17:11,566 --> 00:17:14,066
I don't mind being locked up, but at least let me pee.

246
00:17:14,806 --> 00:17:15,806
Okay.

247
00:17:24,647 --> 00:17:25,746
Don't be like this.

248
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,816
Did you have to go and hold back evidence...

249
00:17:29,816 --> 00:17:31,917
and get in trouble?

250
00:17:33,587 --> 00:17:36,187
- Don't you do that. - Tae Heon!

251
00:17:36,486 --> 00:17:37,556
Darn it.

252
00:17:40,496 --> 00:17:41,496

00:17:42,066 --> 00:17:43,996

She still had the shoes she wore that day.

293
00:24:07,877 --> 00:24:09,147
It means she still has the murder weapon.

294
00:24:09,587 --> 00:24:10,947
Look into the places she visited,

295
00:24:10,947 --> 00:24:13,387
so we can figure out where she hid the murder weapon.

296
00:24:13,456 --> 00:24:14,956
For cases like this, it's likely...

297
00:24:14,956 --> 00:24:16,427
that the culprits would hide it at their parents' houses.

00:30:45,057 --> 00:30:46,788
But I guess it's been bothering you a lot.

366
00:30:53,428 --> 00:30:56,067
You see, this is what really bothers me.

367
00:30:57,198 --> 00:30:59,438
Your daughter-in-law got arrested,

368
00:31:00,407 --> 00:31:02,278
and she'll be charged soon.

369
00:31:05,748 --> 00:31:07,478
So it got me wondering, "Why isn't he reaching out to me?"

370
00:31:07,948 --> 00:31:09,577
"How come he's not even calling me?"

371
00:31:13,317 --> 00:31:17,018
The plan to build the second Mujin resort has gone down the drain.

372
00:31:17,587 --> 00:31:21,028
You're not the type to just neglect a situation like this.

373
00:31:21,988 --> 00:31:22,998
What's your plan?

374
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:25,498
Since we're partners, you need to at least...

375
00:31:25,498 --> 00:31:26,798
give me a heads-up.

376
00:31:27,468 --> 00:31:28,528
Assemblyman Mo Hyung Taek.

377
00:31:29,238 --> 00:31:31,397
You asked me the very question I was going to ask.

378
00:31:32,438 --> 00:31:35,978
You know why you had to accept that you should just follow me around?

379
00:31:36,837 --> 00:31:38,208
You're always one step behind me,

380
00:31:38,637 --> 00:31:41,178
in terms of gathering intel and the way you handle things.

381
00:31:44,647 --> 00:31:47,917
Sir, the cops are here. They're asking to be let in.

382
00:31:48,647 --> 00:31:49,657
What should I do?

383
00:31:49,718 --> 00:31:51,087
Your daughter just got arrested,

384
00:31:51,087 --> 00:31:53,228
so they must be here to search your home.

385
00:31:55,698 --> 00:31:56,798
What are you going to do?

386
00:31:57,397 --> 00:31:58,968
Since we're partners,

387
00:31:58,968 --> 00:32:00,327
you need to at least give me a heads-up.

388
00:32:26,028 --> 00:32:28,557
Have this instead of tofu. This is white too.

389
00:32:39,667 --> 00:32:40,667
What's going on with Mo Soo Rin?

390
00:32:41,008 --> 00:32:42,238
They'll start interviewing her soon.

391
00:32:45,307 --> 00:32:46,978
Even if Mo Soo Rin did it,

392
00:32:47,448 --> 00:32:49,847
Yoo Yoon Young was the mastermind behind everything.

393
00:32:49,847 --> 00:32:51,278
I'll put them both behind bars,

394
00:32:52,347 --> 00:32:53,347
so just trust me.

395
00:32:56,117 --> 00:32:57,157
I never once doubted...

396
00:32:58,718 --> 00:33:00,258
that you would save me.

397
00:33:06,897 --> 00:33:07,968
In the holding cell,

398
00:33:09,397 --> 00:33:11,167
this thought popped into my head for the first time ever.

399
00:33:13,468 --> 00:33:15,937
"Thank goodness Dad passed away."

400
00:33:17,138 --> 00:33:18,638
"If he were alive,"

401
00:33:20,808 --> 00:33:22,477
"he'd be so heartbroken now."

402
00:33:27,187 --> 00:33:28,517
"Why did you run away?"

403
00:33:29,758 --> 00:33:30,988
"Why did you lie?"

404
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:35,357
"This serves you right, Seo Jung Won."

405
00:33:38,528 --> 00:33:40,028
"You didn't kill her,"

406
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:43,167
"but you just left even though you'd seen her dead body."

407
00:33:46,408 --> 00:33:48,167
"Even if I end up in jail for it, I should just deal with it."

408
00:33:49,537 --> 00:33:51,278
I kept telling myself this.

409
00:33:53,348 --> 00:33:54,348
But even so...

410
00:33:57,377 --> 00:34:00,488
I didn't want to spend the rest of my life as a murderer.

411
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:04,558
"I want to just follow Dad and die."

412
00:34:06,087 --> 00:34:07,727
I even thought that.

413
00:34:11,058 --> 00:34:13,798
Thanks for saving me.

414
00:34:15,468 --> 00:34:16,968
For helping me not to fall apart.

415
00:34:22,138 --> 00:34:23,607
I didn't do it alone.

416
00:34:25,377 --> 00:34:27,848
Your husband gave me a hint related to Mo Soo Rin.

417
00:34:29,747 --> 00:34:31,147
For a moment, I was torn.

418
00:34:32,917 --> 00:34:34,388
"Shall I not tell her?"

419
00:34:36,988 --> 00:34:38,058
"I don't want to tell her."

420
00:34:46,897 --> 00:34:47,928
Jung Won.

421
00:34:49,067 --> 00:34:50,468
If you fall apart,

422
00:34:51,868 --> 00:34:53,067
I'll fall apart even more.

423
00:34:56,408 --> 00:34:58,738
Do not have such thoughts again.

424
00:34:59,508 --> 00:35:00,548
Okay?

425
00:35:05,687 --> 00:35:07,118
There are so many reporters outside now,

426
00:35:07,118 --> 00:35:08,687
so wait a bit longer and leave at dawn.

427
00:35:10,517 --> 00:35:11,558
No.

428
00:35:12,158 --> 00:35:13,227
I'll just leave now.

429
00:35:18,897 --> 00:35:19,897
- Here she comes! - It's Seo Jung Won!

430
00:35:19,897 --> 00:35:20,968
She's coming out!

431
00:35:20,968 --> 00:35:22,397
- She's here! - Get her on camera.

432
00:35:22,397 --> 00:35:24,167
- Seo Jung Won is here. - Hey, get her on camera.

433
00:35:27,968 --> 00:35:29,437
I'm aware...

434
00:35:30,707 --> 00:35:32,607
that I caused you concern and disappointed you.

435
00:35:33,977 --> 00:35:35,078
For that, I'm truly sorry.

436
00:35:37,178 --> 00:35:39,247
What's your relationship with the suspect who got arrested today?

437
00:35:39,448 --> 00:35:41,917
Rumor has it that you hired a hitman. Is it true?

438
00:35:41,917 --> 00:35:44,457
I heard Mujin Group influenced the police to release you.

439
00:35:44,457 --> 00:35:45,488
Is it true?

440
00:35:46,328 --> 00:35:48,928
Goodness. Let's not be so crude, all right?

441
00:35:51,198 --> 00:35:54,328
This is why people call you reporters trash.

442
00:35:54,328 --> 00:35:55,997
- What? - Aren't you a reporter too?

443
00:35:56,037 --> 00:35:57,198
What's his problem?

444
00:35:57,198 --> 00:35:58,337
- Goodness. - What's with him?

445
00:35:58,337 --> 00:35:59,707
- What's his problem? - Seriously.

446
00:35:59,707 --> 00:36:02,937
Why did the police arrest you on the suspicion of killing Cha Eun Sae?

447
00:36:05,207 --> 00:36:06,247
It was because...

448
00:36:07,048 --> 00:36:10,647
they found evidence that I fled the scene...

449
00:36:12,218 --> 00:36:14,618
upon discovering Cha Eun Sae's dead body.

450
00:36:18,258 --> 00:36:20,558
When you found the dead body of Mo Hyung Taek's housekeeper,

451
00:36:20,558 --> 00:36:22,698
you called it in. So why...

452
00:36:22,997 --> 00:36:25,767
didn't you do the same when you found Cha Eun Sae's dead body?

453
00:36:25,767 --> 00:36:26,798
Why did you flee the scene?

454
00:36:26,997 --> 00:36:28,298
When I was about to call the police,

455
00:36:30,298 --> 00:36:31,897
I heard that they had chosen me...

456
00:36:32,537 --> 00:36:34,408
to anchor the nine o'clock news.

457
00:36:35,067 --> 00:36:36,738
The day before that, Cha Eun Sae told me...

458
00:36:38,607 --> 00:36:40,877
she was having an affair with my husband,

459
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:42,977
so I didn't want...

460
00:36:43,678 --> 00:36:45,147
to be associated with the murder scene.

461
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:50,687
It was irresponsible of me.

462
00:36:51,658 --> 00:36:52,888
I was foolish.

463
00:36:53,928 --> 00:36:55,087
It was a cowardly decision.

464
00:36:55,698 --> 00:36:58,428
I'd like to sincerely apologize to Cha Eun Sae...

465
00:37:01,767 --> 00:37:03,198
and her bereaved family.

466
00:37:17,747 --> 00:37:21,048
I'll remember my mistakes for the rest of my life.

467
00:37:23,187 --> 00:37:24,187
And finally,

468
00:37:25,587 --> 00:37:28,357
I want to say I'm sorry.

469
00:37:32,767 --> 00:37:34,298
- Wait. - We're done.

470
00:37:34,567 --> 00:37:36,368
- Make way. - Anything else?

471
00:37:36,368 --> 00:37:38,437
- What are your plans? - How do you feel?

472
00:37:38,437 --> 00:37:40,508
- That's enough. - What else do you want to say?

473
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:41,667
Did you expect this?

474
00:37:44,877 --> 00:37:47,678
I heard what you did. Thanks.

475
00:37:53,287 --> 00:37:54,517
You did well.

476
00:37:55,718 --> 00:37:56,787
Good job.

477
00:37:59,017 --> 00:38:00,158
Let's go.

478
00:38:40,897 --> 00:38:42,937
Jung Won. We're home.

479
00:38:45,098 --> 00:38:48,167
Go and sleep more comfortably in bed.

480
00:38:49,508 --> 00:38:51,877
It's okay, Tae Heon.

481
00:39:13,127 --> 00:39:14,497
I guess...

482
00:39:17,837 --> 00:39:19,468
I don't stand a chance.

483
00:39:36,417 --> 00:39:37,787
Before we get into Cha's case,

484
00:39:38,787 --> 00:39:41,328
I'll ask you about Jin Myung Sook's.

485
00:39:47,167 --> 00:39:49,167
We found this diary at your place.

486
00:39:49,868 --> 00:39:51,298
You wrote in it...

487
00:39:51,298 --> 00:39:54,238
when you were in middle school and high school.

488
00:39:56,107 --> 00:39:59,778
The entry for December 24, 2009 had something quite interesting.

489
00:40:02,107 --> 00:40:03,278
"She told me so."

490
00:40:03,778 --> 00:40:06,218
"If two people share a secret no one else knows,"

491
00:40:06,218 --> 00:40:07,687
"they become friends forever."

492
00:40:07,687 --> 00:40:08,817
(Bongto Chemical Plant)

493
00:40:08,817 --> 00:40:11,118
"The more dangerous the secret, the more thrilling it becomes."

494
00:40:13,287 --> 00:40:14,727
(Danger! Do Not Approach)

495
00:40:24,667 --> 00:40:27,238
"If you want to feel as if you control the world,"

496
00:40:27,537 --> 00:40:29,707
"you can just stop someone's time."

497
00:40:30,238 --> 00:40:31,738
"How did she think of that?"

498
00:40:48,627 --> 00:40:49,698
(Gangnam Hoeseong)

499
00:40:56,368 --> 00:40:59,037
(Block 4)

500
00:40:59,067 --> 00:41:02,037
(Bongto Chemical Plant)

501
00:41:09,078 --> 00:41:11,147
(Bongto Chemical Plant)

502
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:25,897
"The flames we created were, just as she said,"

503
00:41:26,067 --> 00:41:27,598
"truly splendid."

504
00:41:28,428 --> 00:41:31,468
"Thank you for creating a secret we can keep forever."

505
00:41:31,798 --> 00:41:33,107
"Merry Christmas."

506
00:41:36,037 --> 00:41:37,078
This.

507
00:41:38,238 --> 00:41:40,548
We tested it and it was Jin Myung Sook's blood.

508
00:41:42,207 --> 00:41:43,578
You killed her...

509
00:41:45,218 --> 00:41:46,988
because of the diary, didn't you?

510
00:41:49,017 --> 00:41:50,187
With this knife.

511
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:57,227
(The day of Jin Myung Sook's murder)

512
00:42:14,207 --> 00:42:15,377
Why did you...

513
00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:18,147
come here out of the blue?

514
00:42:21,488 --> 00:42:22,548
Ms. Jin.

515
00:42:24,417 --> 00:42:27,127
Why did you take my diary without telling me?

516
00:42:28,957 --> 00:42:31,357
What happened at the Bongto factory.

517
00:42:32,727 --> 00:42:33,828
You must know now.

518
00:42:35,567 --> 00:42:36,667
Give it back.

519
00:42:40,707 --> 00:42:42,977
Give it to me right now.

520
00:43:29,787 --> 00:43:32,357
What's this money?

521
00:43:38,127 --> 00:43:40,598
(Cancel illegal demolition and provide moving solution)

522
00:43:40,598 --> 00:43:43,238
It's fine.

523
00:43:43,638 --> 00:43:45,138
It'll be fine!

524
00:43:51,308 --> 00:43:52,477
No.

525
00:43:53,308 --> 00:43:54,408
It's not yours.

526
00:43:56,147 --> 00:43:57,578
It's not for you.

527
00:44:14,928 --> 00:44:16,468
(Warning)

528
00:44:18,698 --> 00:44:21,107
Does the knife remind you of when you killed Jin?

529
00:44:24,738 --> 00:44:25,977
Is it not her?

530
00:44:27,348 --> 00:44:29,408
Were you thinking of when you killed Cha Eun Sae?

531
00:44:32,118 --> 00:44:34,348
(The day of Cha Eun Sae's murder)

532
00:44:51,667 --> 00:44:52,767
Who are you?

533
00:45:12,687 --> 00:45:14,957
We don't just have your diary.

534
00:45:14,957 --> 00:45:17,357
Both Jin and Cha's blood was found on the knife.

535
00:45:17,357 --> 00:45:18,957
You can't worm your way out.

536
00:45:20,098 --> 00:45:22,698
Say you killed Jin because she realized you'd set the fire.

537
00:45:23,638 --> 00:45:25,167
Why did you kill Cha Eun Sae?

538
00:45:25,567 --> 00:45:26,908
Did Yoo Yoon Young tell you to?

539
00:45:28,107 --> 00:45:30,778
Like when you set the fire together to kill Lee Na Ri?

540
00:45:31,908 --> 00:45:34,948
Detective. My client seems to be unwell.

541
00:45:34,948 --> 00:45:36,147
Can we stop...

542
00:45:37,247 --> 00:45:38,578
You killed them,

543
00:45:38,578 --> 00:45:41,888
but wasn't it Yoo Yoon Young who put you up to it, then left...

544
00:45:41,888 --> 00:45:43,687
all the signatures at the scenes?

545
00:45:44,317 --> 00:45:45,957
Why did you do as she said?

546
00:45:46,528 --> 00:45:49,428
What is your relationship with her that you're covering for her?

547
00:45:50,158 --> 00:45:53,567
Do you think she can get away with it if you keep quiet?

548
00:45:56,897 --> 00:45:57,968
Are you all right?

549
00:46:00,667 --> 00:46:01,707
Are you okay?

550
00:46:11,678 --> 00:46:13,087
(Captain Jung In Ki)

551
00:46:13,087 --> 00:46:14,348
That's it for today.

552
00:46:35,267 --> 00:46:36,578
You must be upset.

553
00:46:38,537 --> 00:46:41,147
You must lie low because of Soo Rin when the election's so close.

554
00:46:42,448 --> 00:46:44,317
Having a lot to lose...

555
00:46:44,718 --> 00:46:46,687
means you have a lot.

556
00:46:47,348 --> 00:46:48,817
Part of me is jealous.

557
00:46:49,317 --> 00:46:50,517
Who could dream...

558
00:46:51,388 --> 00:46:53,087
of becoming the President?

559
00:46:54,258 --> 00:46:55,857
You're one of very few.

560
00:46:56,158 --> 00:46:57,558
Just get to the point.

561
00:47:02,267 --> 00:47:03,598
Fill this up for me.

562
00:47:04,567 --> 00:47:07,238
Oh, but I won't leave the country.

563
00:47:08,337 --> 00:47:10,138
I plan to take a break somewhere private.

564
00:47:16,348 --> 00:47:17,877
You must think I'm a nuisance.

565
00:47:18,448 --> 00:47:19,517
But what could I do?

566
00:47:20,287 --> 00:47:22,348
It's just my luck that your daughter loves me...

567
00:47:22,348 --> 00:47:25,718
and that you're an assemblyman. All of this is...

568
00:47:26,627 --> 00:47:27,758
just my luck.

569
00:47:29,087 --> 00:47:30,127
Don't worry.

570
00:47:30,397 --> 00:47:33,198
I want you to become the President more than anyone else.

571
00:47:35,328 --> 00:47:36,638
Call me when you're done filling that up.

572
00:47:37,698 --> 00:47:40,037
Don't do a sloppy job like your daughter.

573
00:47:55,093 --> 00:47:57,132
Gosh. This is driving me crazy.

574
00:47:57,832 --> 00:47:59,493
Forget about getting her to talk about her accomplice.

575
00:47:59,493 --> 00:48:01,533
Her lawyer repeatedly argues for insanity as a defense,

576
00:48:01,533 --> 00:48:03,172
using drug side effects as the cause.

577
00:48:05,002 --> 00:48:07,602
Have you located Yoo Yoon Young? Is her phone still turned off?

578
00:48:07,973 --> 00:48:10,873
Yes. She hasn't turned it on since two nights ago.

579
00:48:11,312 --> 00:48:13,283
She's determined to stay hidden.

580
00:48:14,582 --> 00:48:17,152
Any attempts to leave the country? You're getting live updates, right?

581
00:48:17,152 --> 00:48:20,323
Yes. Just like Tae Heon said, I put some men on stakeout duty.

582
00:48:20,922 --> 00:48:22,252
But she's not showing up.

583
00:48:22,683 --> 00:48:25,022
It looks like she won't say a word and will go down alone for this.

584
00:48:25,022 --> 00:48:26,053
What do you say?

585
00:48:26,763 --> 00:48:27,962
Should we request a warrant just for her?

586
00:48:28,922 --> 00:48:30,033
No, we can't do that.

587
00:48:38,672 --> 00:48:40,303
("Assemblyman Mo Stops Campaigning and Disappeared Two Days Ago")

588
00:48:42,542 --> 00:48:47,312
I think Mo Hyung Taek already knew about his daughter's crimes.

589
00:48:49,812 --> 00:48:51,252
(Chief Kang In Han)

590
00:48:54,053 --> 00:48:56,223
Sir, I need to talk to you now.

591
00:48:58,292 --> 00:49:00,022
I thought you would be having a hard time by now.

592
00:49:00,422 --> 00:49:03,093
What else did you want to ask me about other than your own situation?

593
00:49:03,593 --> 00:49:05,692
When I told you I had a suspect in mind,

594
00:49:06,632 --> 00:49:08,902
you sounded certain it was Mo Hyung Taek and said this.

595
00:49:09,303 --> 00:49:11,073
"I knew it."

596
00:49:11,073 --> 00:49:12,533
"So, what I heard was true."

597
00:49:13,902 --> 00:49:14,973
What have you heard?

598
00:49:15,272 --> 00:49:16,573
It could harm Mo Hyung Taek, right?

599
00:49:16,573 --> 00:49:18,843
Gosh. His daughter is about to get arrested.

600
00:49:18,843 --> 00:49:21,442
Why do you still want to find dirt on him?

601
00:49:21,843 --> 00:49:24,082
I exposed a woman named Yoo during my interview.

602
00:49:24,553 --> 00:49:26,283
She's Mo Soo Rin's accomplice.

603
00:49:26,283 --> 00:49:29,082
Mo Soo Rin just did what Yoo told her to do.

604
00:49:29,082 --> 00:49:30,893
I doubt that Mo Hyung Taek didn't know about this.

605
00:49:32,522 --> 00:49:33,962
He should actively protest that...

606
00:49:33,962 --> 00:49:34,993
his daughter didn't voluntarily commit murder...

607
00:49:34,993 --> 00:49:36,163
to save his career.

608
00:49:36,332 --> 00:49:38,533
It's odd that he's remaining quiet about her accomplice.

609
00:49:38,533 --> 00:49:39,593
Something is up.

610
00:49:40,433 --> 00:49:42,533
So you're saying...

611
00:49:42,533 --> 00:49:45,803
Her accomplice might have something on Mo Hyung Taek.

612
00:49:45,803 --> 00:49:46,973
Something he wants to hide.

613
00:49:48,272 --> 00:49:50,113
What is it that you know?

614
00:49:54,643 --> 00:49:58,482
His wife is in the hospital because she's in a vegetative state.

615
00:49:58,752 --> 00:50:01,382
She rolled down the stairs on her own at home 13 years ago.

616
00:50:01,382 --> 00:50:03,422
That was the conclusion of the investigation.

617
00:50:03,823 --> 00:50:05,292
Rumor has it that...

618
00:50:05,292 --> 00:50:06,922
Mo Hyung Taek ordered them to conclude it as an accident.

619
00:50:08,093 --> 00:50:10,562
I know that you don't want me to do that.

620
00:50:11,732 --> 00:50:14,363
I don't expect you to forgive me.

621
00:50:24,613 --> 00:50:26,013
- He's coming out. - Here he comes.

622
00:50:26,172 --> 00:50:27,343
- Here he is. - He's coming out?

623
00:50:28,113 --> 00:50:29,812
Did you meet your daughter who got arrested?

624
00:50:29,812 --> 00:50:30,982
- Please give us a comment. - She's a murder suspect.

625
00:50:30,982 --> 00:50:32,482
- How do you feel? - When did you become aware...

626
00:50:32,482 --> 00:50:33,582
of your daughter's crimes?

627
00:50:33,582 --> 00:50:35,183
Your daughter was arrested...

628
00:50:35,183 --> 00:50:36,823
on the suspicion of killing Jin Myung Sook and Cha Eun Sae.

629
00:50:36,823 --> 00:50:38,123
How do you feel right now?

630
00:50:38,623 --> 00:50:39,863
Ms. Seo.

631
00:50:41,123 --> 00:50:43,192
What do you want to hear from me?

632
00:50:46,332 --> 00:50:48,533
(Jihyang University Hospital)

633
00:50:48,902 --> 00:50:50,102
You knew that...

634
00:50:50,502 --> 00:50:52,832
your daughter didn't act alone in both cases, didn't you?

635
00:50:53,542 --> 00:50:55,203
You also know who her accomplice is, right?

636
00:50:55,843 --> 00:50:57,343
How come you're not speaking up?

637
00:50:58,573 --> 00:50:59,783
I've been thinking about...

638
00:51:00,683 --> 00:51:02,143
what kind of decision...

639
00:51:03,882 --> 00:51:06,252
I should make to truly help my daughter.

640
00:51:14,163 --> 00:51:15,993
Someone came into the house?

641
00:51:17,033 --> 00:51:18,163
Did you see that person's face?

642
00:51:19,832 --> 00:51:20,832
(The day after killing Jin Myung Sook)

643
00:51:20,832 --> 00:51:22,163
It was a young man.

644
00:51:22,832 --> 00:51:25,732
I only caught a glimpse of him as he took the bag of money.

645
00:51:27,973 --> 00:51:29,743
What if we end up in trouble because of him?

646
00:51:30,272 --> 00:51:34,013
He ran away with the money even after seeing Jin wasn't dead.

647
00:51:35,382 --> 00:51:37,413
He won't be able to get out of this scot-free. So don't worry.

648
00:51:38,283 --> 00:51:40,183
I also checked the crime scene thoroughly.

649
00:51:41,053 --> 00:51:42,553
You were at the scene?

650
00:51:43,252 --> 00:51:44,292
Yes.

651
00:51:45,393 --> 00:51:47,462
I was the one who set the stage.

652
00:51:47,462 --> 00:51:49,123
I ought to bring down the curtains myself.

653
00:51:49,623 --> 00:51:52,033
Well done, Soo Rin.

654
00:52:04,312 --> 00:52:06,482
Ms. Seo was right.

655
00:52:07,143 --> 00:52:10,252
The woman, Yoo, she exposed during her interview on the news...

656
00:52:12,513 --> 00:52:15,652
indeed instigated my daughter to commit murder.

657
00:52:16,053 --> 00:52:17,453
- She instigated the murder? - She did what?

658
00:52:17,553 --> 00:52:18,692
- What? - What do you mean?

659
00:52:18,692 --> 00:52:21,663
("'Yoo Instigated Murder of Cha Eun Sae'")

660
00:52:24,062 --> 00:52:25,562
Have them ban her from flying out of the country.

661
00:52:25,863 --> 00:52:27,033
Now that we have a voice recording,

662
00:52:27,033 --> 00:52:29,062
- let's put out an APB. - They went to the same high school.

663
00:52:29,062 --> 00:52:30,703
Yoo had dominated...

664
00:52:30,703 --> 00:52:33,303
and manipulated my daughter mentally for a long time.

665
00:52:33,973 --> 00:52:36,343
I don't have evidence that she instigated Cha Eun Sae's murder.

666
00:52:36,712 --> 00:52:39,243
But she probably committed the murder...

667
00:52:39,243 --> 00:52:40,913
because Yoo told her to do so.

668
00:52:45,752 --> 00:52:46,823
Earlier...

669
00:52:47,453 --> 00:52:49,922
you said you had to think about what kind of decision...

670
00:52:49,922 --> 00:52:51,123
would truly help your daughter.

671
00:52:51,652 --> 00:52:53,962
If she committed the murders for someone else's sake, not hers,

672
00:52:53,962 --> 00:52:56,163
wouldn't telling the truth sooner have been better for her?

673
00:52:56,163 --> 00:52:58,763
Why did you keep it a secret all this time?

674
00:52:59,933 --> 00:53:01,002
Because her accomplice...

675
00:53:03,703 --> 00:53:06,573
knew about our family's dark secret.

676
00:53:08,073 --> 00:53:09,243
Thirteen years ago,

677
00:53:09,703 --> 00:53:12,573
my wife tumbled down the stairs at home...

678
00:53:13,413 --> 00:53:15,113
and ended up in a vegetative state.

679
00:53:15,113 --> 00:53:17,312
You're not normal. I'm taking you to the hospital.

680
00:53:17,953 --> 00:53:20,283
I'm not going! Who are you to tell me what to do?

681
00:53:20,283 --> 00:53:21,652
If you don't go to the hospital,

682
00:53:21,652 --> 00:53:23,123
- My wife and my daughter... - I'll report you to the police.

683
00:53:23,123 --> 00:53:24,553
- got into a small physical fight. - Stop it!

684
00:53:25,022 --> 00:53:28,192
Then my daughter pushed her down, so she ended up in an accident.

685
00:53:29,062 --> 00:53:30,062
Her friend...

686
00:53:31,332 --> 00:53:33,703
was at my house when it happened.

687
00:53:34,562 --> 00:53:36,433
So she witnessed the accident.

688
00:53:36,602 --> 00:53:38,132
- She saw the accident? - What?

689
00:53:38,132 --> 00:53:41,243
Her friend urged her to kill Ms. Jin in the end.

690
00:53:41,803 --> 00:53:43,373
Not only that,

691
00:53:44,643 --> 00:53:46,513
she tried to kill me too.

692
00:53:52,352 --> 00:53:54,922
- That's a huge scar. - It's a scar!

693
00:53:55,752 --> 00:53:56,922
- Really? - Did you see that?

694
00:53:57,553 --> 00:53:58,723
- He survived. - What happened?

695
00:54:01,123 --> 00:54:03,363
- What? - What is that?

696
00:54:03,363 --> 00:54:04,363
Is that a knife stab wound?

697
00:54:04,363 --> 00:54:07,062
- Did she stab him? - Her own father?

698
00:54:07,462 --> 00:54:08,462
Darn it.

699
00:54:09,263 --> 00:54:10,933
Now that my daughter is caught,

700
00:54:11,533 --> 00:54:13,002
I'm disclosing everything...

701
00:54:13,002 --> 00:54:14,002
("His Daughter Almost Killed Him")

702
00:54:14,002 --> 00:54:15,843
as a means of repentance.

703
00:54:18,442 --> 00:54:21,513
Please condemn me.

704
00:54:22,913 --> 00:54:24,013
And...

705
00:54:25,783 --> 00:54:29,553
please catch her accomplice who ruined my daughter's life...

706
00:54:30,053 --> 00:54:31,123
and punish her.

707
00:54:32,453 --> 00:54:34,962
I implore you desperately for your help.

708
00:54:55,442 --> 00:54:56,882
What do you think you're doing?

709
00:54:58,082 --> 00:54:59,553
You should have told them she hallucinated...

710
00:54:59,553 --> 00:55:01,053
due to the drug side effects.

711
00:55:01,053 --> 00:55:03,152
But you made it sound like I'm some psychopath!

712
00:55:03,352 --> 00:55:04,752
What are you trying to pull right now?

713
00:55:05,393 --> 00:55:07,993
You made those scars, didn't you?

714
00:55:08,422 --> 00:55:10,433
You were going to sacrifice her in the worst-case scenario,

715
00:55:10,863 --> 00:55:13,292
so you could get off alone by turning yourself into a victim.

716
00:55:13,962 --> 00:55:16,502
That's it, isn't it? That's what you're doing! Darn it.

717
00:55:16,703 --> 00:55:17,973
If I admit that,

718
00:55:19,002 --> 00:55:20,643
will you admit it too?

719
00:55:21,502 --> 00:55:22,942
That it's all over?

720
00:55:24,513 --> 00:55:25,542
What?

721
00:56:17,826 --> 00:56:20,426
("Rain in the Desert")

722
00:56:23,826 --> 00:56:25,226
("Rain in the Desert")

723
00:56:31,607 --> 00:56:34,437
(To Yoon Young, Seol Woo Jae)

724
00:56:34,607 --> 00:56:35,607
Here you go.

725
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:56,257
I have no idea where Yoon Young could be...

726
00:56:57,167 --> 00:56:58,397
right now.

727
00:56:59,266 --> 00:57:01,667
I have a few guys trying to track her down as per your order,

728
00:57:02,067 --> 00:57:03,667
but we've found nothing yet.

729
00:57:15,417 --> 00:57:18,846
(Kind Police)

730
00:57:25,826 --> 00:57:27,156
Will they charge me with the murders?

731
00:57:32,397 --> 00:57:35,766
The woman, Yoo, she exposed during her interview on the news...

732
00:57:35,766 --> 00:57:37,306
("Yoo Instigated My Daughter to Commit Murder")

733
00:57:37,306 --> 00:57:40,007
indeed instigated my daughter to commit murder.

734
00:57:41,136 --> 00:57:42,476
Thirteen years ago,

735
00:57:43,076 --> 00:57:45,946
my wife tumbled down the stairs at home...

736
00:57:46,777 --> 00:57:48,377
and ended up in a vegetative state.

737
00:57:49,116 --> 00:57:51,587
My wife and my daughter got into a small physical fight.

738
00:57:52,217 --> 00:57:55,457
Then my daughter pushed her down, so she ended up in an accident.

739
00:58:03,156 --> 00:58:05,967
Is what your father said true? Did you really push your mother?

740
00:58:07,536 --> 00:58:09,266
Also, is it true that you tried...

741
00:58:09,766 --> 00:58:11,866
to stab your father to kill him?

742
00:58:15,406 --> 00:58:17,047
Mr. Mo showed us...

743
00:58:17,906 --> 00:58:20,877
the scar on his chest and revealed everything.

744
00:58:25,717 --> 00:58:27,016
No, I never did such a thing.

745
00:58:29,217 --> 00:58:30,757
It wasn't me. It wasn't Yoon Young...

746
00:58:31,656 --> 00:58:32,687
It wasn't her either.

747
00:58:37,766 --> 00:58:39,996
Do you know how I found the knife...

748
00:58:40,967 --> 00:58:42,636
you'd hidden in the memorial niche?

749
00:58:44,036 --> 00:58:45,866
Yoo Yoon Young told Seol Woo Jae...

750
00:58:47,076 --> 00:58:48,437
so we could arrest you.

751
00:58:51,976 --> 00:58:53,007
You're lying.

752
00:58:54,417 --> 00:58:55,446
You are lying.

753
00:58:56,446 --> 00:58:58,846
That is a lie!

754
00:58:59,217 --> 00:59:01,417
You're lying!

755
00:59:01,417 --> 00:59:02,917
You're lying!

756
00:59:25,877 --> 00:59:26,877
Are you home?

757
00:59:55,576 --> 00:59:56,777
I'm here.

758
00:59:58,846 --> 00:59:59,906
Jung Won.

759
01:00:01,676 --> 01:00:02,976
Join me.

760
01:00:37,317 --> 01:00:40,246
(Nothing Uncovered)

761
01:00:40,556 --> 01:00:42,217
Yoo Yoon Young's phone just turned on.

762
01:00:42,217 --> 01:00:43,357
What? Where?

763
01:00:44,226 --> 01:00:45,226
Jung Won.

764
01:00:45,226 --> 01:00:47,156
There's no way Yoon Young betrayed me.

765
01:00:47,357 --> 01:00:49,096
I trust Yoon Young.

766
01:00:49,457 --> 01:00:50,696
Don't do this.

767
01:00:51,167 --> 01:00:52,167
Hey, Woo Jae.

768
01:00:52,167 --> 01:00:53,397
If you hurt Jung Won,

769
01:00:53,667 --> 01:00:55,067
I'll kill you, and then kill myself too.

770
01:00:55,067 --> 01:00:57,337
Why are you trying so hard to make Woo Jae miserable?

771
01:00:57,337 --> 01:00:59,007
There's only one thing I want now.

772
01:00:59,107 --> 01:01:00,676
I don't want Woo Jae to forget me, ever.

773
01:01:00,676 --> 01:01:02,737
He pegged Park Jin Soo as the arsonist,

774
01:01:02,737 --> 01:01:04,946
fully knowing that I was the one who started the fire.

775
01:01:04,946 --> 01:01:07,277
Shouldn't my dad take responsibility for not investigating it properly?

776
01:01:07,277 --> 01:01:09,946
Now, there's a higher chance that it is not Lee Na Ri.

777
01:01:10,147 --> 01:01:11,746
If we find something, I'll let you know right away.

778
01:01:12,116 --> 01:01:13,147
I'm recharging.

779
01:01:14,357 --> 01:01:17,016
There must be a reason I didn't die and survived.

780
01:01:17,016 --> 01:01:18,257
(Application on the Confirmation of Divorce by Consent)

781
01:01:18,326 --> 01:01:19,627
Let's get a divorce.
