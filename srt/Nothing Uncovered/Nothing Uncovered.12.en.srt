The real culprit in Cha Eun Sae's murder...

10
00:00:45,427 --> 00:00:46,797
wasn't Soo Rin.

11
00:00:48,897 --> 00:00:50,467
It was your husband.

14
00:01:06,977 --> 00:01:08,216
You came back?

15
00:01:08,216 --> 00:01:10,017
I'd forgotten some things.

16
00:01:10,856 --> 00:01:12,017
I came for them.

17
00:01:16,186 --> 00:01:19,326
- You skipped work today? - Yes.

18
00:01:19,627 --> 00:01:22,026
You didn't wear hats because they were suffocating.

19
00:01:25,567 --> 00:01:26,636
You're right.

20
00:01:30,367 --> 00:01:31,576
Where are you coming from?

21
00:01:32,477 --> 00:01:35,546
I couldn't focus, so I walked all day long.

22
00:01:36,446 --> 00:01:38,946
I kept noticing kids.

23
00:01:40,416 --> 00:01:43,246
Will it be a boy or a girl?

24
00:01:44,056 --> 00:01:47,157
Who will it look like? That's all I could think about.

25
00:01:48,356 --> 00:01:51,996
I'll stay the night here. Just for one night.

26
00:01:52,026 --> 00:01:54,267
It's your father's death anniversary, right?

27
00:01:57,737 --> 00:01:59,867
I forgot to get a cake.

28
00:01:59,867 --> 00:02:01,567
Can you get me one from nearby?

29
00:02:01,567 --> 00:02:02,666
Sure.

30
00:02:06,806 --> 00:02:07,847
Hello?

31
00:02:10,146 --> 00:02:11,247
Okay.

32
00:02:12,616 --> 00:02:14,946
Are you craving anything other than cheesecake?

33
00:02:14,946 --> 00:02:16,016
Anything will do.

34
00:02:16,217 --> 00:02:17,317
I won't be long.

35
00:02:40,236 --> 00:02:41,907
(Haesin-ro 122, Mueon, Gangwon Province)

36
00:02:43,907 --> 00:02:45,076
Why was he in Mueon?

37
00:03:11,777 --> 00:03:13,007
Were you about to go out?

38
00:03:13,907 --> 00:03:14,946
No.

39
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:48,563
I got one of everything.

40
00:03:51,473 --> 00:03:52,633
What do you want?

41
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:54,503
I'm not hungry right now.

42
00:03:58,343 --> 00:04:01,082
Do you have morning sickness?

43
00:04:01,943 --> 00:04:04,582
Ms. Yang doesn't cook. What do you eat?

44
00:04:04,582 --> 00:04:05,753
I don't want to...

45
00:04:06,896 --> 00:04:08,167
discuss these things with you.

46
00:04:12,537 --> 00:04:14,037
What shall we talk about, then?

47
00:04:16,736 --> 00:04:19,006
You don't like talking about your dad on his death anniversary.

48
00:04:20,277 --> 00:04:21,676
Whatever memory we mentioned,

49
00:04:21,676 --> 00:04:24,116
you said it reminded you of his death and made you sad.

50
00:04:35,326 --> 00:04:38,496
You said you were drinking alone in your studio...

51
00:04:39,826 --> 00:04:41,996
at the time of Cha Eun Sae's death.

52
00:04:43,767 --> 00:04:44,837
Yes.

53
00:04:45,667 --> 00:04:47,037
Why are you asking about that all of a sudden?

54
00:04:49,977 --> 00:04:51,006
I'm tired.

55
00:04:52,207 --> 00:04:53,306
I'm going to bed.

56
00:05:08,457 --> 00:05:10,426
Dad.

57
00:05:12,066 --> 00:05:13,097
Dad.

58
00:06:10,986 --> 00:06:12,350
(Seo Jung...)

59
00:06:22,566 --> 00:06:23,566
Seo Jung Won.

60
00:06:28,506 --> 00:06:30,907
What are you doing here this early?

61
00:06:30,907 --> 00:06:33,806
What could it be? I missed you.

62
00:06:44,457 --> 00:06:45,787
I'm headed to Mueon.

63
00:06:46,787 --> 00:06:48,826
I dropped by on the way.

64
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:50,926
Why go there?

65
00:06:51,826 --> 00:06:53,227
To find Lee Na Ri?

66
00:06:54,767 --> 00:06:56,196
I talked to the detective there.

67
00:06:57,037 --> 00:07:00,037
When I mentioned Lee Na Ri's escape from the factory that night,

68
00:07:00,037 --> 00:07:01,436
he suggested I meet someone.

69
00:07:02,707 --> 00:07:06,306
A female illegal immigrant had been reported missing,

70
00:07:07,246 --> 00:07:09,076
and she worked at the Bongto factory then.

71
00:07:10,417 --> 00:07:13,547
- Then... - The body Lee Ba Reun collected...

72
00:07:14,417 --> 00:07:16,486
is even more likely not to be Lee Na Ri's.

73
00:07:17,556 --> 00:07:19,227
I'll tell you as soon as I have anything.

74
00:07:23,256 --> 00:07:24,866
You're still down.

75
00:07:28,837 --> 00:07:30,066
I lost my job...

76
00:07:30,897 --> 00:07:32,436
and am staying with a friend.

77
00:07:32,936 --> 00:07:34,267
It wouldn't be weird if I weren't.

78
00:07:35,576 --> 00:07:36,636
I guess?

79
00:07:38,647 --> 00:07:40,707
What should I do to cheer you up?

80
00:07:51,426 --> 00:07:53,857
I'm sharing my energy. To recharge you.

81
00:08:00,326 --> 00:08:02,467
From now on, I'll live off of my efforts.

82
00:08:03,337 --> 00:08:05,207
You can take...

83
00:08:07,066 --> 00:08:08,277
all my fortune.

84
00:08:10,607 --> 00:08:11,607
Cheer up.

85
00:08:27,826 --> 00:08:29,097
I'm Detective Kim Tae Heon.

86
00:08:30,297 --> 00:08:32,066
Show him your friend's photo.

87
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:34,537
I filled him in.

88
00:08:41,877 --> 00:08:44,877
That's her. Her name is Jang Hwa Lan.

89
00:08:45,206 --> 00:08:47,176
- How old was she then? - Twenty.

90
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:49,377
She was about 165cm tall.

91
00:08:49,377 --> 00:08:52,017
She had a similar build as Lee Na Ri.

92
00:08:52,186 --> 00:08:54,147
When exactly did you report her missing?

93
00:08:54,147 --> 00:08:55,387
On the 26th.

94
00:08:55,657 --> 00:08:57,686
We'd agreed to spend Christmas together,

95
00:08:57,686 --> 00:08:59,826
but she wasn't at home, and she'd disappeared.

96
00:08:59,826 --> 00:09:01,956
Did she really work part-time...

97
00:09:01,956 --> 00:09:04,826
at the Bongto factory on the 24th?

98
00:09:04,826 --> 00:09:07,596
Yes. She told me she had to work that day,

99
00:09:07,596 --> 00:09:09,537
and changed our appointment to the 25th.

100
00:09:09,936 --> 00:09:12,066
You didn't see her go to the factory...

101
00:09:12,066 --> 00:09:13,767
on the 24th in person, did you?

102
00:09:14,066 --> 00:09:16,137
No, I didn't, but...

103
00:09:17,637 --> 00:09:20,076
She disappeared then and hasn't come back yet.

104
00:09:31,287 --> 00:09:34,497
There are quite a few illegal immigrants here.

105
00:09:34,497 --> 00:09:36,297
They often go missing.

106
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:39,397
We'd returned all the bodies from the fire to their families,

107
00:09:39,397 --> 00:09:40,696
so we didn't mind them.

108
00:09:41,696 --> 00:09:44,637
That Mo Soo Rin saw Lee Na Ri run away.

109
00:09:44,637 --> 00:09:45,806
I assumed it was a lie,

110
00:09:46,606 --> 00:09:48,237
but it bothers me.

111
00:09:48,706 --> 00:09:51,777
But if she hadn't come home...

112
00:09:51,777 --> 00:09:54,306
She could've inhaled toxic fumes.

113
00:09:55,716 --> 00:09:57,247
Maybe she fainted on the way.

114
00:09:58,316 --> 00:10:01,586
I wish there were records of calls to the police or EMTs from then.

115
00:10:04,017 --> 00:10:05,127
Hang on.

116
00:10:07,186 --> 00:10:08,797
We must have records of 911 calls.

117
00:10:10,226 --> 00:10:12,127
There are still records of 911 calls?

118
00:10:12,127 --> 00:10:13,627
Yes, we still have the records.

119
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:15,696
Could I get copies of the calls on the day of the incident?

120
00:10:15,696 --> 00:10:16,797
Just in case...

121
00:10:16,797 --> 00:10:19,606
there was a 911 call, reporting that someone passed out or something.

122
00:10:21,137 --> 00:10:22,806
I'm also getting curious...

123
00:10:22,907 --> 00:10:25,946
if the body we found at the factory was Lee Na Ri's or someone else's.

124
00:10:26,907 --> 00:10:28,247
It was a very long time ago.

125
00:10:28,247 --> 00:10:30,846
Even the locals forgot about the factory.

126
00:10:30,976 --> 00:10:32,846
Now, there are some fancy buildings at the factory site.

127
00:10:33,686 --> 00:10:35,417
What's at the factory site now?

128
00:10:35,686 --> 00:10:37,017
Mujin Resort.

129
00:10:37,257 --> 00:10:39,127
They beautified the entire area.

130
00:10:39,127 --> 00:10:40,757
That's how Mujin Construction made a fortune.

131
00:10:40,987 --> 00:10:43,997
Mujin Construction? A subsidiary of Mujin Group?

132
00:10:44,196 --> 00:10:45,226
Yes.

133
00:10:45,466 --> 00:10:48,137
As a matter of fact, I saw on the news that they would build...

134
00:10:48,137 --> 00:10:49,367
another resort here.

135
00:11:20,226 --> 00:11:21,767
Your sister, Lee Na Ri,

136
00:11:22,737 --> 00:11:25,267
might not have died from the fire at Bongto Factory.

137
00:11:26,167 --> 00:11:29,137
Mo Soo Rin saw Lee Na Ri running away.

138
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:32,377
When you get this note, call me.

139
00:11:43,757 --> 00:11:45,556
Lee Ba Reun's phone is still turned off.

140
00:11:45,787 --> 00:11:47,326
It's been a while since his parents talked to him.

141
00:11:47,997 --> 00:11:50,497
He took advantage of Ms. Seo to get justice for his sister.

142
00:11:50,497 --> 00:11:53,027
When he finds out that his sister ran away from the factory,

143
00:11:53,027 --> 00:11:54,867
he's going to be so shocked.

144
00:11:56,137 --> 00:11:57,566
Let me know immediately when he turns his phone on.

(Detective Kim Tae Heon)

153
00:13:09,277 --> 00:13:11,106
(You recognize the place, don't you?)

154
00:13:26,826 --> 00:13:29,926
The pipes aren't exposed or anything.

155
00:13:29,926 --> 00:13:32,466
Is your husband going to use this place for his office again?

156
00:13:32,466 --> 00:13:33,566
Or is this for you?

157
00:13:35,667 --> 00:13:38,466
You're certain there's only one way into and out of the building, right?

158
00:13:38,706 --> 00:13:40,206
Is there another way...

159
00:13:40,206 --> 00:13:41,676
to get out of the building other than the main exit?

160
00:13:41,907 --> 00:13:43,106
Not here.

161
00:13:43,676 --> 00:13:44,676
Right.

162
00:13:44,877 --> 00:13:47,176
There's a back alley connected to the first-floor cafe...

163
00:13:47,176 --> 00:13:48,576
run by Assemblyman Mo's daughter.

164
00:13:48,576 --> 00:13:50,346
There's a back alley connected to the cafe?

165
00:13:50,816 --> 00:13:52,716
What? How did you know?

166
00:13:53,086 --> 00:13:54,417
We rarely use that path.

167
00:13:54,856 --> 00:13:57,417
There's a path that leads outside through the storage room.

168
00:13:57,956 --> 00:13:59,287
Where's that path?

169
00:14:09,237 --> 00:14:11,167
If Woo Jae found out about this path through Mo Soo Rin,

170
00:14:11,936 --> 00:14:14,306
his alibi could be called into question.

171
00:14:23,147 --> 00:14:24,147

172
00:14:25,117 --> 00:14:26,316
Your note... Is it true?

173
00:14:27,117 --> 00:14:28,917
Let's meet in person.

174
00:14:29,086 --> 00:14:30,086
Where are you?

175
00:14:40,027 --> 00:14:41,326
I'm here.

176
00:14:41,637 --> 00:14:42,637
Me too.

177
00:14:47,466 --> 00:14:50,777
Did Mo Soo Rin really say she saw my sister running away?

178
00:14:51,877 --> 00:14:54,306
Then what about the corpse my family received? Who was that?

179
00:14:56,277 --> 00:14:57,617
How is this possible?

180
00:14:57,617 --> 00:14:59,047
I don't know the details.

181
00:14:59,517 --> 00:15:00,517
But...

182
00:15:00,716 --> 00:15:03,586
an undocumented female worker was reported missing back then.

183
00:15:03,987 --> 00:15:07,157
That worker had a part-time job at Bongto Factory.

184
00:15:08,226 --> 00:15:09,527
Due to the fire,

185
00:15:10,657 --> 00:15:13,367
her DNA couldn't be confirmed, right?

186
00:15:13,797 --> 00:15:15,497
If Mo Soo Rin is telling the truth,

187
00:15:17,466 --> 00:15:18,507
how come...

188
00:15:23,576 --> 00:15:25,976
How come my sister still hasn't come back to us?

189
00:15:26,507 --> 00:15:28,216
- Why on earth... - Perhaps, she died...

190
00:15:28,617 --> 00:15:30,716
in a different location. Don't you agree?

191
00:15:32,086 --> 00:15:35,316
She knew that the factory arsonist wasn't Park Jin Soo.

192
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:37,387
Mo Hyung Taek, the prosecutor in charge of the case,

193
00:15:37,387 --> 00:15:38,657
must have suspected her.

194
00:15:42,297 --> 00:15:43,627
Is that why you used me?

195
00:15:44,257 --> 00:15:45,926
I exposed Mo Hyung Taek to the public.

196
00:15:45,926 --> 00:15:47,527
So did you want me to be the first eyewitness...

197
00:15:48,027 --> 00:15:49,637
of Jin Myung Sook's murder case?

198
00:15:52,466 --> 00:15:54,336
(The day of Jin Myung Sook's murder)

199
00:15:54,336 --> 00:15:56,076
Why is her phone turned off?

200
00:16:30,206 --> 00:16:32,346
(Nike)

201
00:16:35,517 --> 00:16:36,747
We've located...

202
00:16:38,686 --> 00:16:39,987
Lee Yi Jin's burner phone.

203
00:16:41,287 --> 00:16:42,356
Jung Won.

204
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:47,856
There's a real reason why I got you involved in this.

205
00:16:49,356 --> 00:16:51,426
Your father's death was an act of injustice too, right?

206
00:16:52,696 --> 00:16:53,867
Just like my sister's death.

207
00:16:55,936 --> 00:16:56,966
I had met...

208
00:16:57,897 --> 00:16:59,566
your father before.

209
00:17:00,537 --> 00:17:02,436
This must have been tough. So thank you.

210
00:17:02,436 --> 00:17:03,806
(Right after the fire incident at Bongto Factory)

211
00:17:04,507 --> 00:17:05,677
You're home, Ba Reun.

212
00:17:06,007 --> 00:17:08,277
I see. You must be Ba Reun.

213
00:17:12,947 --> 00:17:14,916
(Reporter Seo Sang Gyeon)

214
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:16,987
I will write a great article with the interviews...

215
00:17:17,116 --> 00:17:18,856
from the bereaved families of the fire incident.

216
00:17:18,856 --> 00:17:20,556
So people don't forget.

217
00:17:21,427 --> 00:17:22,896
Why did you let him interview you?

218
00:17:23,227 --> 00:17:25,697
That won't bring back my sister.

219
00:17:50,856 --> 00:17:54,126
Do you know where I am right now?

220
00:17:54,957 --> 00:17:58,467
I'm at the house of a victim you murdered.

221
00:18:00,027 --> 00:18:01,326
Decide.

222
00:18:01,326 --> 00:18:03,037
Which truth will you bury?

223
00:18:03,336 --> 00:18:05,166
And which truth will you reveal?

224
00:18:06,106 --> 00:18:07,806
With whom did my father have that kind of call?

225
00:18:07,806 --> 00:18:10,336
Then I watched the news two weeks later.

226
00:18:11,037 --> 00:18:12,247
The news said that...

227
00:18:13,076 --> 00:18:14,947
he was murdered by an unidentified assailant in his house,

228
00:18:16,247 --> 00:18:17,616
and the police were pursuing the culprit.

229
00:18:19,447 --> 00:18:21,386
I had a hunch the moment I watched the news.

230
00:18:22,116 --> 00:18:24,156
That he was murdered by the person he was on the phone with that day.

231
00:18:26,957 --> 00:18:29,626
I found out about you through your show first.

232
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:32,896
When I found out that your father was Reporter Seo Sang Gyeon,

233
00:18:33,427 --> 00:18:34,697
I thought the universe brought me to you.

234
00:18:35,937 --> 00:18:38,467
My sister and your father...

235
00:18:38,636 --> 00:18:40,267
were murdered by the same person.

236
00:18:41,566 --> 00:18:43,876
After discovering the truth about Lee Na Ri's death,

237
00:18:44,707 --> 00:18:46,146
he threatened someone.

238
00:18:47,277 --> 00:18:49,017
Then my father was murdered after making that threat.

239
00:18:50,346 --> 00:18:51,886
Who on earth was on the phone?

240
00:18:52,846 --> 00:18:53,987
Actually,

241
00:18:55,957 --> 00:18:57,687
I went down to Mueon a while ago.

242
00:19:01,727 --> 00:19:02,757
Never mind.

243
00:19:03,556 --> 00:19:06,427
I'll tell you once my assumption is verified.

244
00:19:07,096 --> 00:19:08,126
What is it?

245
00:19:08,767 --> 00:19:10,197
I'll be in touch again, Jung Won.

246
00:19:11,537 --> 00:19:14,836
Let's have a drink next time just like old times.

247
00:19:15,136 --> 00:19:16,777
Lee Ba Reun.

248
00:19:18,136 --> 00:19:19,177
Ba Reun.

249
00:19:24,177 --> 00:19:25,287
The person you have reached is unavailable.

250
00:19:25,287 --> 00:19:26,416
You'll be directed to...

251
00:19:34,727 --> 00:19:36,856
- She's pregnant? - Yes.

252
00:19:36,856 --> 00:19:38,866
- Are you sure it's yours? - Dad.

253
00:19:39,866 --> 00:19:42,737
I thought I would never be lucky enough to be a grandfather.

254
00:19:44,937 --> 00:19:46,566
The case is closed.

255
00:19:46,566 --> 00:19:48,267
She got pregnant just when we started to resume...

256
00:19:48,267 --> 00:19:49,707
our business plan with the second resort.

257
00:19:50,037 --> 00:19:52,606
The Lord has given us a big blessing.

258
00:19:56,846 --> 00:20:00,217
Actually, I wanted to be a father a lot more than you.

259
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:01,987
I didn't want to pressure Jung Won.

260
00:20:03,916 --> 00:20:05,356
So I just didn't show it.

261
00:20:06,356 --> 00:20:09,697
Father, the things you said you did for my sake...

262
00:20:09,697 --> 00:20:11,257
were all so awful.

263
00:20:12,096 --> 00:20:14,666
But now that I'm becoming a father,

264
00:20:15,237 --> 00:20:16,366
I finally understand...

265
00:20:18,267 --> 00:20:20,037
why you had to do the things you did.

266
00:20:22,576 --> 00:20:25,406
Please put me in charge of the second Mujin resort project.

267
00:20:25,876 --> 00:20:29,076
I'll do a great job and lead the project to success.

268
00:20:34,846 --> 00:20:36,316
Now that you're becoming a father,

269
00:20:36,316 --> 00:20:38,386
you're finally talking like a grown-up.

270
00:20:42,326 --> 00:20:43,396

271
00:20:44,697 --> 00:20:46,066
with only the best things.

272
00:20:48,636 --> 00:20:51,737
It will be my sole focus. I will not look back again,

273
00:20:54,537 --> 00:20:56,806
and I will put the past behind me now.

274
00:21:56,737 --> 00:21:57,737

You said the movies and books I recommended...

279
00:22:12,947 --> 00:22:14,146
were boring but finished them.

00:22:14,346 --> 00:22:15,616
Well, that was...

281
00:22:17,116 --> 00:22:18,586
I finished them because you like them.

I felt like I had disappeared too.

319

You've made up your mind, right?

320

To keep the baby.

321
00:27:33,083 --> 00:27:34,343
I've never told you...

322
00:27:36,382 --> 00:27:37,813
about my mom, right?

323
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:41,253
After my dad passed away,

324
00:27:43,493 --> 00:27:45,493
I hated the feeling of being left all alone.

325
00:27:46,462 --> 00:27:49,833
I was really lonely, so I went to see my mom in Australia.

326
00:27:50,993 --> 00:27:52,932
She had left us before I learned to walk,

327
00:27:52,932 --> 00:27:55,672
so I told myself I'd never look for her first,

328
00:27:57,833 --> 00:27:59,142
but she's my mom, you know.

329
00:28:01,243 --> 00:28:02,672
I was hoping she'd comfort me.

330
00:28:03,872 --> 00:28:06,482
I flew for over ten hours and got there.

331
00:28:06,482 --> 00:28:08,912
When I told her that Dad had passed away, she said,

332
00:28:09,553 --> 00:28:12,583
"We're all alone in this thing called life."

333
00:28:15,152 --> 00:28:16,392
She had remarried...

334
00:28:17,222 --> 00:28:18,793
and had three kids.

335
00:28:19,662 --> 00:28:21,023
And what? We're all alone in life?

336
00:28:25,132 --> 00:28:28,363
Mom means nothing to me,

337
00:28:30,033 --> 00:28:31,603
and it's not like I wanted a kid.

338
00:28:32,672 --> 00:28:33,803
Besides,

339
00:28:34,773 --> 00:28:36,672
I had made up my mind to divorce you,

340
00:28:37,142 --> 00:28:38,442
so I was going to get an abortion,

341
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:42,712
but this question popped into my head. "Are we really..."

342
00:28:43,583 --> 00:28:44,682
"all alone in life?"

343
00:28:48,122 --> 00:28:50,622
I, of all people, really did not want to be alone.

344
00:28:54,622 --> 00:28:56,932
I've changed my mind because I thought I'd regret it forever,

345
00:28:57,533 --> 00:28:58,692
but keeping the baby...

346
00:28:59,533 --> 00:29:01,333
is separate from my decision to end things with you.

347
00:29:01,333 --> 00:29:02,402
All right.

348
00:29:04,702 --> 00:29:05,843
I get it.

349
00:29:06,172 --> 00:29:08,503
But at least until our baby's birth is registered,

350
00:29:09,712 --> 00:29:11,073
let's put off the paperwork.

351
00:29:12,343 --> 00:29:14,442
I don't want the baby to be born without a dad.

352
00:29:16,382 --> 00:29:17,912
That's all I ask for.

353
00:29:17,912 --> 00:29:19,783

00:30:18,289 --> 00:30:19,390
Let's meet.

364
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:32,269
Will you throw a punch at me like last time?

365
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:39,580
I get what you're going to say.

366
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:42,549
I can't do it.

367
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:45,180
Jung Won asked you for a divorce,

368
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:48,519
and she's currently staying with Ms. Yang.

369
00:30:49,719 --> 00:30:50,820
I know all that.

370
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,190
I'll wait.

371
00:30:54,489 --> 00:30:57,690
Until Jung Won sorts everything out and feels free.

372
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:01,830
You no longer have the right...

373
00:31:03,029 --> 00:31:04,070
to lecture me.

374
00:31:04,469 --> 00:31:05,739
I'm not here to lecture.

375
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:08,469
I'm here to plead.

376
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:11,809
Jung Won has been avoiding you, right?

377
00:31:13,539 --> 00:31:15,610
I was with her earlier,

378
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:17,180
and she ignored your call.

379
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:19,479
Jung Won...

380
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:22,989
has changed. Didn't you sense it?

381
00:31:24,219 --> 00:31:25,620
She's pregnant.

382
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:31,759
She was very confused for a while, but she decided to keep it.

383
00:31:31,759 --> 00:31:34,059
We decided to postpone the divorce.

384
00:31:35,199 --> 00:31:36,969
It's early days and she needs to rest.

385
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:41,739
I don't want her to suffer any pain or hardship.

386
00:31:44,539 --> 00:31:48,209
That's why I'd like you to set her free.

387
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,809
Help her so she doesn't...

388
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:52,479
have to suffer.

389
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,330
I don't know how long it'll take.

390
00:32:43,729 --> 00:32:46,739
But will you wait for me?

391
00:33:02,394 --> 00:33:04,424
(Detective Kim Tae Heon)

392
00:33:06,194 --> 00:33:08,363
(Mueon Beach, Mueon Stall Street)

393
00:33:16,343 --> 00:33:18,173
(Detective Kim Tae Heon)

394
00:33:21,314 --> 00:33:22,783
- Hi. - Where are you?

395
00:33:23,684 --> 00:33:26,314
I'm on the way to Ae Na's. What about you?

396
00:33:26,653 --> 00:33:28,914
Where you asked me to wait for you.

397
00:33:44,164 --> 00:33:45,233
I love you.

398
00:33:48,673 --> 00:33:50,774
I won't get to say this if I don't say it now.

399
00:33:54,474 --> 00:33:55,514
I love you.

400
00:33:57,814 --> 00:33:59,783
You're going to end it with him one day.

401
00:34:01,053 --> 00:34:03,053
Our feelings for each other still remain.

402
00:34:04,553 --> 00:34:06,923
I can do better. I can handle it.

403
00:34:08,053 --> 00:34:09,693
Don't push me away again.

404
00:34:11,823 --> 00:34:12,934
My feelings.

405
00:34:15,363 --> 00:34:16,764
They haven't disappeared.

406
00:34:18,604 --> 00:34:19,704
They've changed.

407
00:34:23,003 --> 00:34:24,443
Since I realized I was pregnant,

408
00:34:26,713 --> 00:34:28,974
I've felt things I'd never felt before.

409
00:34:30,713 --> 00:34:31,983
I can't describe them.

410
00:34:34,684 --> 00:34:38,354
To me, these feelings come first.

411
00:34:38,383 --> 00:34:41,193
Even so, it doesn't have to change our relationship.

412
00:34:41,193 --> 00:34:43,193
Our relationship will and must change.

413
00:34:43,193 --> 00:34:44,863
- Why? - Could you...

414
00:34:45,463 --> 00:34:47,363
ignore a woman with your child...

415
00:34:48,033 --> 00:34:49,903
and date me as if nothing were wrong?

416
00:34:50,204 --> 00:34:51,204
Could you do that?

417
00:34:51,934 --> 00:34:53,503
That's completely different.

418
00:34:53,503 --> 00:34:54,704
It's the same to me.

419
00:35:01,443 --> 00:35:02,783
What am I to do, then?

420
00:35:04,383 --> 00:35:05,483
What should I do?

421
00:35:06,753 --> 00:35:08,283
I can wait for a long time.

422
00:35:10,684 --> 00:35:11,923
I want to wait.

423
00:35:14,093 --> 00:35:15,753
Can't I?

424
00:35:18,564 --> 00:35:19,963
What I said to you here.

425
00:35:22,193 --> 00:35:23,334
Forget everything.

426
00:35:25,233 --> 00:35:26,274
Help me...

427
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:29,073
so I don't have to suffer so much.

428
00:35:32,204 --> 00:35:34,343
Let's not talk for a while.

429
00:36:58,363 --> 00:36:59,423
I love you.

430
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:02,764
I won't get to say this if I don't say it now.

431
00:37:04,633 --> 00:37:05,664
I love you.

432
00:37:07,974 --> 00:37:09,204
What am I to do, then?

433
00:37:10,374 --> 00:37:11,443
What should I do?

434
00:37:12,943 --> 00:37:14,544
I can wait for a long time.

435
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:18,184
I want to wait.

436
00:37:20,383 --> 00:37:22,014
Can't I?

437
00:37:33,664 --> 00:37:36,403
(Mueon Beach, Mueon Stall Street)

438
00:37:49,744 --> 00:37:51,343
You went to bed early.

439
00:37:52,613 --> 00:37:53,783
I can't sleep.

440
00:38:02,243 --> 00:38:04,084
I'd be surprised if you didn't cry.

441
00:38:07,283 --> 00:38:08,613
Poor Detective Kim.

442
00:38:11,223 --> 00:38:13,053
I feel so sorry for you both.

443
00:38:14,354 --> 00:38:15,694
I guess you two...

444
00:38:17,223 --> 00:38:18,823
aren't meant to be.

445
00:39:31,734 --> 00:39:32,763
Here.

446
00:39:37,874 --> 00:39:39,173
Come to think of it,

447
00:39:40,144 --> 00:39:42,573
you were the one who taught me how to drink.

448
00:39:52,854 --> 00:39:54,093
Remember what you told me?

449
00:39:54,754 --> 00:39:57,493
That detectives must look cool even when they get drunk.

450
00:39:59,363 --> 00:40:01,964
That I should call you instead of letting others see me...

451
00:40:02,533 --> 00:40:03,604
at my lowest point.

452
00:40:16,214 --> 00:40:17,314
You know, don't you?

453
00:40:22,053 --> 00:40:23,153
Did you cry?

454
00:40:23,584 --> 00:40:24,883
I did more than that.

455
00:40:29,894 --> 00:40:31,863
I wept buckets...

456
00:40:33,763 --> 00:40:34,993
like a little kid.

457
00:40:41,403 --> 00:40:42,774
There were only two times...

458
00:40:44,973 --> 00:40:48,044
I couldn't control my tears when I thought...

459
00:40:48,613 --> 00:40:49,814
I was doing well.

460
00:40:50,883 --> 00:40:52,914
The first time was when my mom passed away.

461
00:40:54,354 --> 00:40:57,283
The second time was when Detective Cha died,

462
00:40:58,323 --> 00:41:00,194
and when I broke up with Jung Won.

463
00:41:02,423 --> 00:41:03,823
This is the third time now.

464
00:41:11,703 --> 00:41:13,803
I'm a widower, so I don't know much about kids.

465
00:41:14,533 --> 00:41:17,644
But from what I hear about marriage, having children...

466
00:41:18,044 --> 00:41:19,604
makes a world of difference.

467
00:41:21,673 --> 00:41:23,984
Tae Heon, holding on to something that has no future...

468
00:41:24,814 --> 00:41:26,513
is the most foolish act.

469
00:41:38,278 --> 00:41:39,377
- Thank you. - He is

470
00:41:39,377 --> 00:41:41,147
- He is the real thing - He is the real thing

471
00:41:41,147 --> 00:41:43,948
- He's the total package - He's the total package

472
00:41:44,517 --> 00:41:47,888
- He'll love you deeply - He'll love you deeply

473
00:41:47,888 --> 00:41:49,318
Number three!

474
00:41:50,056 --> 00:41:51,057
(New Gangwon Province)

475
00:41:51,057 --> 00:41:53,127
My respected residents of Gangwon Province.

476
00:41:53,798 --> 00:41:56,807
When I told the truth about everything...

477
00:41:57,168 --> 00:41:58,668
and kneeled before the public,

478
00:41:58,867 --> 00:42:00,137
you all...

479
00:42:00,907 --> 00:42:02,637
helped me get up.

480
00:42:03,077 --> 00:42:04,807
You saved me!

481
00:42:07,077 --> 00:42:10,847
I got up on my feet again for our country and people,

482
00:42:10,947 --> 00:42:13,458
but everyone including my fellow party members...

483
00:42:13,688 --> 00:42:17,028
is stabbing me in my heart by saying I should step down.

484
00:42:17,387 --> 00:42:20,557
Must I really step down?

485
00:42:20,557 --> 00:42:23,467
- No! - No! Don't step down.

486
00:42:23,467 --> 00:42:26,938
I've already come back from the dead!

487
00:42:27,168 --> 00:42:30,668
I will fight until the very end and prevail!

488
00:42:32,737 --> 00:42:34,438
- Mo Hyung Taek! - Mo Hyung Taek!

489
00:42:34,438 --> 00:42:37,108
- Mo Hyung Taek! - Mo Hyung Taek!

490
00:42:37,208 --> 00:42:39,248
- Hello. - Mo Hyung Taek!

491
00:42:39,248 --> 00:42:40,847
- Mo Hyung Taek! - We love you.

492
00:42:40,918 --> 00:42:42,148
- Mo Hyung Taek! - Mo Hyung Taek!

493
00:42:42,478 --> 00:42:45,588
- Mo Hyung Taek! - Mo Hyung Taek!

494
00:42:45,787 --> 00:42:49,057
- Mo Hyung Taek! - Mo Hyung Taek!

495
00:42:49,057 --> 00:42:52,358
- Mo Hyung Taek! - Mo Hyung Taek!

496
00:42:52,358 --> 00:42:54,597
- Mo Hyung Taek! - Mo Hyung Taek!

497
00:42:54,597 --> 00:42:56,568
Did you analyze the alternative...

498
00:42:56,568 --> 00:42:57,967
for the site of Mujin's second resort?

499
00:42:57,967 --> 00:43:00,068
Increasing 4 levels in 1 go will be risky.

500
00:43:00,068 --> 00:43:01,798
It's highly likely that you may be charged with malpractice.

501
00:43:01,798 --> 00:43:03,407
You don't think I know that?

502
00:43:03,737 --> 00:43:07,037
Chairman Seol is cornering me when it's too risky. That means...

503
00:43:07,037 --> 00:43:09,137
he can't run his business if it's below Level Four.

504
00:43:11,111 --> 00:43:12,542
(Tenacious, Bold New Worker, Mo Hyung Taek)

505
00:43:12,542 --> 00:43:13,782
What about Soo Rin?

506
00:43:13,782 --> 00:43:16,012
Is she still acting stubborn that she'd only talk to Detective Kim?

507
00:43:16,759 --> 00:43:19,059
Yes. Sir.

508
00:43:19,358 --> 00:43:22,168
There was unexpected information in the last investigation report.

509
00:43:23,369 --> 00:43:24,938
The student, Lee Na Ri, was the target...

510
00:43:24,938 --> 00:43:26,469
of the fire at Bongto Factory.

511
00:43:26,739 --> 00:43:28,969
Ms. Mo made a statement that she saw...

512
00:43:28,969 --> 00:43:31,639
Lee Na Ri come out of the factory and run away.

513
00:43:31,639 --> 00:43:32,838
What on earth...

514
00:43:37,878 --> 00:43:38,918
Right.

515
00:43:40,019 --> 00:43:43,188
There was a body we couldn't check the DNA of.

516
00:43:43,188 --> 00:43:44,989
Afterward, Detective Kim went to Mueon...

517
00:43:44,989 --> 00:43:46,628
and contacted Detective Bong.

518
00:43:47,188 --> 00:43:49,358
It seemed he had gotten a lead.

519
00:43:54,128 --> 00:43:55,568
Cancel the rest of my schedule for the day.

520
00:43:56,469 --> 00:43:58,568
Call Detective Bong. Tell him I'm coming.

521
00:43:58,798 --> 00:44:00,809
(Recording file of the 911 report on December 24, 2009)

522
00:44:00,809 --> 00:44:02,909
I see. This must be it.

523
00:44:03,708 --> 00:44:06,108
Tae Heon. Earlier, you mentioned a rollover accident with a truck.

524
00:44:06,108 --> 00:44:08,579
A firefighter called it in. The truck was blocking the road...

525
00:44:14,588 --> 00:44:15,588
Come here.

526
00:44:18,188 --> 00:44:19,259
Did you get something?

527
00:44:21,159 --> 00:44:22,829
This is 911. Go ahead.

528
00:44:24,798 --> 00:44:28,269
My friend is hurt.

529
00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:29,728
Could you specify the location of the injury?

530
00:44:30,039 --> 00:44:32,639
Well, she passed out.

531
00:44:32,699 --> 00:44:34,869
She passed out? Is she conscious?

532
00:44:35,568 --> 00:44:37,938
- I'm not sure. - Could you tell me how it happened?

533
00:44:38,778 --> 00:44:40,278
It was an accident.

534
00:44:41,909 --> 00:44:43,918
Hello? Where are you?

535
00:44:43,918 --> 00:44:45,818
(Recording file of the 911 report on December 24, 2009)

536
00:44:45,818 --> 00:44:49,548
We're near Bongto Factory.

537
00:44:49,889 --> 00:44:51,958
Everyone has been dispatched because there has been a big fire.

538
00:44:51,958 --> 00:44:53,588
So it will take a while to send in some help.

539
00:44:57,059 --> 00:44:59,498
- Something feels off, doesn't it? - Completely.

540
00:45:00,298 --> 00:45:01,869
He said his friend was hurt and passed out.

541
00:45:01,869 --> 00:45:02,898
But something about that...

542
00:45:02,898 --> 00:45:05,469
More importantly, he said he was around Bongto Factory.

543
00:45:06,338 --> 00:45:08,239
Check the account holder's name of this number.

544
00:45:15,809 --> 00:45:17,579
(Recording file of the 911 report on December 24, 2009)

545
00:45:45,432 --> 00:45:47,102
(Chairman Seol Pan Ho)

546
00:46:03,521 --> 00:46:05,352
I thought you had gone to Seoul...

547
00:46:05,352 --> 00:46:07,191
when I heard you canceled your afternoon schedule.

548
00:46:10,091 --> 00:46:12,392
Did you come down here to see me?

549
00:46:12,392 --> 00:46:14,461
I wanted to watch you campaigning.

550
00:46:14,792 --> 00:46:17,532
Since I made the trip, I was going to inspect my subsidiaries.

551
00:46:18,501 --> 00:46:20,401
Seeing how you're joking around,

552
00:46:20,972 --> 00:46:22,801
you must have gotten some good news.

553
00:46:23,801 --> 00:46:25,671
I'm going to be a grandfather.

554
00:46:27,242 --> 00:46:29,512
He turned down so many eligible bachelorettes...

555
00:46:29,512 --> 00:46:31,242
and insisted on marrying only Jung Won.

556
00:46:31,412 --> 00:46:34,211
As I wanted grandchildren, I let him marry her. You know what?

557
00:46:35,952 --> 00:46:37,551
He fulfilled his duty as my son.

558
00:46:41,251 --> 00:46:42,392
Was that all?

559
00:46:43,562 --> 00:46:46,992
The reason you accepted Ms. Seo as your daughter-in-law.

560
00:46:47,532 --> 00:46:50,301
I thought it was because of Reporter Seo Sang Gyeon.

561
00:46:52,361 --> 00:46:54,271
Since we're on the subject of our past,

562
00:46:54,832 --> 00:46:56,731
I should tell you that my daughter made another mistake.

563
00:47:00,642 --> 00:47:03,512
She set Bongto Factory on fire...

564
00:47:04,312 --> 00:47:07,412
to kill one of the female students.

565
00:47:07,912 --> 00:47:11,421
But that female student escaped from the factory.

566
00:47:13,021 --> 00:47:14,151
Here's what's interesting.

567
00:47:14,792 --> 00:47:18,591
A body that was found at the factory supposedly belonged to the student.

568
00:47:18,921 --> 00:47:22,762
But the body was too damaged, so we couldn't check her DNA.

569
00:47:23,901 --> 00:47:26,432
Then where could the student be...

570
00:47:27,271 --> 00:47:28,501
right now?

571
00:47:30,301 --> 00:47:32,301
Is it something I should be aware of?

572
00:47:35,312 --> 00:47:38,381
Well, maybe. Or maybe not.

573
00:47:40,852 --> 00:47:41,912
Of all people,

574
00:47:43,051 --> 00:47:45,251
Detective Kim Tae Heon got...

575
00:47:45,251 --> 00:47:47,651
the recording file of the 911 call that day.

576
00:47:49,091 --> 00:47:51,492
I got the recording file and listened to the whole thing.

577
00:47:52,392 --> 00:47:54,292
Would you like to listen to it too?

578
00:47:55,131 --> 00:47:58,202
You'll hear a voice you can easily recognize.

579
00:48:06,912 --> 00:48:09,771
If you need the recording, just let me know anytime.

580
00:48:10,481 --> 00:48:12,211
And next time you want to see me,

581
00:48:13,082 --> 00:48:15,082
I suggest you make an appointment in advance.

582
00:48:28,262 --> 00:48:29,114
(December 24, 2009)

583
00:48:29,138 --> 00:48:32,702
What? The fire trucks can't even budge?

584
00:48:34,032 --> 00:48:37,401
What can they do? The roads are heavily congested now.

585
00:48:37,571 --> 00:48:39,901
Give me an update as soon as things are sorted out at the scene.

586
00:48:40,542 --> 00:48:41,571
All right.

587
00:48:42,412 --> 00:48:44,611
Let's see.

588
00:48:44,611 --> 00:48:48,211
It's already well past the golden hour.

589
00:48:48,611 --> 00:48:50,582
Even if they fly there now,

590
00:48:51,082 --> 00:48:54,191
they certainly can't contain the fire.

591
00:48:55,691 --> 00:48:58,961
It must've collapsed by now, only leaving some rebars standing.

592
00:48:59,521 --> 00:49:02,691
My goodness. You tried so hard to get rid of them but couldn't.

593
00:49:03,392 --> 00:49:06,262
Who knew the factory would burn down in a fire?

594
00:49:06,501 --> 00:49:09,731
What's more? The fire trucks can't even move. What timing.

595
00:49:10,671 --> 00:49:11,742
Oh, my.

596
00:49:12,202 --> 00:49:14,941
The morning prayers surely paid off.

597
00:49:17,812 --> 00:49:20,551
Why are you all quiet? Is something the matter?

598
00:49:23,312 --> 00:49:24,881
No. You're right about everything, sir.

599
00:49:25,321 --> 00:49:27,751
You're no fun today. This is boring.

600
00:49:30,591 --> 00:49:31,662
Oh, right.

601
00:49:32,321 --> 00:49:34,932
Your golf bag. It's in your car, right?

602
00:49:36,662 --> 00:49:39,332
- My iron. - I'll drop it off for you.

603
00:49:40,372 --> 00:49:43,501
There are other things in my car, so I can't get the golf bag out now.

604
00:50:34,292 --> 00:50:38,091
Chairman Seol, that idiot. He couldn't say a word.

605
00:50:39,792 --> 00:50:42,262
Well, how can I use this?

606
00:50:47,901 --> 00:50:51,542
If this man is Woo Jae, it means he killed Dad too.

607
00:50:53,972 --> 00:50:55,711
But it makes no sense.

608
00:50:56,142 --> 00:50:57,782
Why would Woo Jae kill Dad?

609
00:51:00,512 --> 00:51:02,682
Where shall we go for our vacation this year?

610
00:51:02,682 --> 00:51:04,722
(A year ago)

611
00:51:04,722 --> 00:51:05,852
I'm easy.

612
00:51:06,551 --> 00:51:08,021
Let's go to a place where you want to go.

613
00:51:11,421 --> 00:51:12,461
Then how about New York?

614
00:51:14,332 --> 00:51:15,591
I can go anywhere...

615
00:51:16,191 --> 00:51:17,932
but New York. I'm fine with anywhere else.

616
00:51:18,262 --> 00:51:19,301
Why?

617
00:51:20,702 --> 00:51:23,472
Oh, is it because you studied there?

618
00:51:28,111 --> 00:51:29,312
The whole time I was there,

619
00:51:30,372 --> 00:51:31,642
I was lonely and depressed.

620
00:51:34,782 --> 00:51:36,151
When did you leave for New York?

621
00:51:36,151 --> 00:51:38,481
February of 2010.

622
00:51:39,582 --> 00:51:40,792
My dad...

623
00:51:41,722 --> 00:51:43,292
passed away in January.

624
00:51:45,091 --> 00:51:46,591
So when we were 20,

625
00:51:47,091 --> 00:51:48,731
we were both lonely and depressed.

626
00:51:56,332 --> 00:51:59,001
Dad passed away in January 2010,

627
00:51:59,472 --> 00:52:02,611
and Woo Jae left for New York in February that year to study abroad,

628
00:52:03,312 --> 00:52:06,381
so I must check Woo Jae's alibi on the day my dad died.

629
00:52:18,361 --> 00:52:19,921
Isn't it all over now?

630
00:52:20,631 --> 00:52:22,091
Why are you here?

631
00:52:23,832 --> 00:52:25,501
I will not apologize.

632
00:52:29,071 --> 00:52:30,642
Don't look at me like that.

633
00:52:31,301 --> 00:52:34,372
Yoon Young's gone, and I'm locked up here.

634
00:52:35,412 --> 00:52:37,312
Had you not run away,

635
00:52:37,512 --> 00:52:39,211
Yoon Young's plan would have failed.

636
00:52:39,812 --> 00:52:41,352
You brought it upon yourself.

637
00:52:44,321 --> 00:52:45,421
Yes, that I admit.

638
00:52:46,921 --> 00:52:50,352
I'm here because something more important happened.

639
00:52:52,861 --> 00:52:53,992
My husband.

640
00:52:54,792 --> 00:52:56,191
Around February 2010,

641
00:52:56,792 --> 00:52:58,961
he left for the US to study abroad. You know about it, right?

642
00:53:00,332 --> 00:53:01,372
Yes.

643
00:53:01,372 --> 00:53:03,832
Do you happen to know what he was up to during the month...

644
00:53:04,171 --> 00:53:05,642
before his departure?

645
00:53:06,901 --> 00:53:08,142
Because of Lee Na Ri's death,

646
00:53:09,211 --> 00:53:10,711
he was probably devastated.

647
00:53:11,042 --> 00:53:12,912
Woo Jae and I were never close.

648
00:53:12,912 --> 00:53:14,711
Anything connected to Yoo Yoon Young?

649
00:53:15,182 --> 00:53:16,881
Is there anything you remember?

650
00:53:24,191 --> 00:53:26,691
Unless I go through my diary from that time,

651
00:53:27,332 --> 00:53:28,461
I don't really remember anything.

652
00:53:34,432 --> 00:53:36,801
Hey, it's me. Do me a favor.

653
00:53:37,542 --> 00:53:40,341
Mo Soo Rin's diary is in the evidence room, right?

654
00:53:40,401 --> 00:53:42,671
- Yes. - Can you go through...

655
00:53:42,872 --> 00:53:44,512
the diary entries from January and see if...

656
00:53:45,111 --> 00:53:48,251
any of them mention Yoo Yoon Young and my husband together?

657
00:53:49,611 --> 00:53:51,082
This is very important to me.

658
00:53:51,582 --> 00:53:54,091
Well, all right.

659
00:53:54,852 --> 00:53:57,361
If you find anything, take a picture and send it to me.

660
00:53:59,021 --> 00:54:00,292
Is Tae Heon there too?

661
00:54:01,631 --> 00:54:02,662
Yes.

662
00:54:03,162 --> 00:54:05,762
This has to stay between us. Please don't tell him.

663
00:54:11,901 --> 00:54:13,771
- What was that about? - What?

664
00:54:15,142 --> 00:54:16,242
Nothing important.

665
00:54:18,941 --> 00:54:20,142
(List of Mid to Large Hospitals in Mueon)

666
00:54:20,142 --> 00:54:21,352
(Myeonseong University Mueon Ansim Hospital)

667
00:54:26,082 --> 00:54:27,591
Hello, I'm Detective Kim Tae Heon...

668
00:54:27,591 --> 00:54:28,821
from Gangha Police's Violent Crimes Unit 1.

669
00:54:29,352 --> 00:54:30,421
I'm calling to check...

670
00:54:30,762 --> 00:54:33,321
if the body of an unidentified 19-year-old girl...

671
00:54:34,231 --> 00:54:37,062
was transported to your hospital in the afternoon or later...

672
00:54:37,062 --> 00:54:38,332
on December 24, 2009.

673
00:55:03,651 --> 00:55:05,861
- Hey. - I went through the diary entries.

674
00:55:05,861 --> 00:55:07,691
I found one that says Yoo visited a hospital in Seoul...

675
00:55:07,691 --> 00:55:09,131
to see your husband.

676
00:55:09,432 --> 00:55:10,861
Woo Jae was in Seoul?

677
00:55:11,801 --> 00:55:14,571
What's the date in that entry?

678
00:55:14,571 --> 00:55:15,602
January 10.

679
00:55:17,441 --> 00:55:19,341
Can you take a picture of it and send it to me?

680
00:55:19,602 --> 00:55:20,642
Sure.

681
00:55:27,651 --> 00:55:31,282
(Yoon Young canceled on me to visit Woo Jae in the hospital in Seoul.)

682
00:55:51,472 --> 00:55:52,801
Father, what brings you by?

683
00:55:57,542 --> 00:56:00,682
Do you know why the Lord puts us through ordeals?

684
00:56:01,551 --> 00:56:05,321
To turn us from wrongdoing...

685
00:56:05,421 --> 00:56:07,622
and keep us from pride and arrogance.

686
00:56:12,461 --> 00:56:13,892
Now that I'm becoming a grandfather,

687
00:56:13,892 --> 00:56:16,861
and my son is volunteering to help me run the business,

688
00:56:16,861 --> 00:56:18,532
I let my arrogance get the best of me.

689
00:56:25,472 --> 00:56:27,742
The records of 911 calls from that day.

690
00:56:28,142 --> 00:56:29,972
Detective Kim Tae Heon took the records.

691
00:56:30,542 --> 00:56:32,611
- Sorry? - I'm talking about...

692
00:56:33,542 --> 00:56:36,012
December 24, 2009.

693
00:59:26,682 --> 00:59:29,722
(Nothing Uncovered)

694
00:59:29,722 --> 00:59:32,550
I would've totally done something if I wasn't so drunk that day.

695
00:59:32,574 --> 00:59:34,273
Tae Heon, give up.

696
00:59:34,273 --> 00:59:36,944
For Reporter Seo and for your own sake too.

697
00:59:36,944 --> 00:59:38,373
I'm becoming a mother.

698
00:59:38,373 --> 00:59:40,574
For my child, I must find out...

699
00:59:40,674 --> 00:59:42,744
whether or not Woo Jae is a murderer.

700
00:59:42,813 --> 00:59:45,313
On Christmas Eve 2009,

701
00:59:45,313 --> 00:59:48,353
I found a headlight shard with blood on it.

702
00:59:48,353 --> 00:59:50,424
Did something happen here on January 10?

703
00:59:50,424 --> 00:59:53,154
A concert was held to commemorate the Bongto Factory fire victims.

704
00:59:53,154 --> 00:59:55,463
Why? Why was it kept hidden?

705
00:59:55,463 --> 00:59:57,634
If it's a murder case, finding the body is of utmost importance.

706
00:59:57,634 --> 00:59:59,764
We must find Lee Na Ri's body no matter what.

707
01:00:00,063 --> 01:00:02,134
Jung Won, what are you doing in Mueon?

708
01:00:02,134 --> 01:00:05,433
Did you see the news? Skeletal remains were found on Mount Mueon.

709
01:00:06,034 --> 01:00:07,103
It's Lee Na Ri.
