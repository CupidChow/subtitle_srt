00:00:00,104 --> 00:00:05,602
(Nothing Uncovered)

(Production sponsors)

00:00:08,013 --> 00:00:09,844
(Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, KOCCA)

00:00:10,355 --> 00:00:11,554
(All people, organizations, locations, and incidents...)

5
00:00:11,554 --> 00:00:12,755
(in this drama are fictitious. Production guidelines...)

6
00:00:12,755 --> 00:00:13,947
(were strictly followed when filming with children and youths.)

7
00:00:48,608 --> 00:00:50,817
(Episode 14)

8
00:00:55,703 --> 00:00:58,633
Why did you kill Cha Eun Sae, Father?

9
00:01:00,274 --> 00:01:02,944
Jung Won found the spy cam footage Yoon Young had left behind.

10
00:01:04,213 --> 00:01:05,843
She showed it to me.

11
00:01:07,314 --> 00:01:09,614
Why did you get Mr. Gong to kill Cha Eun Sae...

12
00:01:12,653 --> 00:01:14,054
Was it for my sake, again?

13
00:01:19,123 --> 00:01:22,493
(One day before Cha Eun Sae died)

14
00:01:42,614 --> 00:01:44,144
You must be very surprised,

15
00:01:44,853 --> 00:01:46,754
but that baby is your grandchild,

16
00:01:47,013 --> 00:01:48,554
so I hope this news makes you happy.

17
00:01:50,284 --> 00:01:52,153
I'm confident that I can take good care of Woo Jae...

18
00:01:52,694 --> 00:01:54,493
while raising my child well.

19
00:01:55,524 --> 00:01:58,334
I'll retire and stay overseas until things are all sorted out...

20
00:01:58,334 --> 00:01:59,763
for Woo Jae's divorce.

21
00:02:07,133 --> 00:02:09,704
I'm not being clingy because of the baby.

22
00:02:11,574 --> 00:02:13,274
I truly love Woo Jae.

23
00:02:14,913 --> 00:02:17,484
I love him so much that I can embrace his dirty laundry.

24
00:02:18,554 --> 00:02:19,584
His dirty laundry?

25
00:02:19,713 --> 00:02:21,283
Did you know this too?

26
00:02:22,054 --> 00:02:25,554
Woo Jae killed a girl named Lee Na Ri.

27
00:02:36,634 --> 00:02:38,903
I don't care what he did in the past.

28
00:02:39,074 --> 00:02:40,933
I want to embrace such deep scars of his too.

29
00:02:42,243 --> 00:02:43,774
All of it.

30
00:02:46,213 --> 00:02:47,743
Please accept me, sir.

31
00:03:04,894 --> 00:03:08,134
Thank goodness she told me before telling you.

32
00:03:08,234 --> 00:03:10,864
Even so, she was pregnant.

33
00:03:10,864 --> 00:03:12,503
You also knew it wasn't your child.

34
00:03:12,503 --> 00:03:14,074
Still, how could you kill her?

35
00:03:15,274 --> 00:03:17,074
Mr. Gong killed Lee Ba Reun too, didn't he?

36
00:03:17,743 --> 00:03:19,014
He found Na Ri,

37
00:03:20,274 --> 00:03:21,384
so Mr. Gong got rid of him.

38
00:03:22,843 --> 00:03:25,253
How? Not even once...

39
00:03:25,253 --> 00:03:26,954
You said you now understood how parents...

40
00:03:26,954 --> 00:03:28,524
could do anything for their children.

41
00:03:30,183 --> 00:03:31,824
You recently went to Mount Mueon, didn't you?

42
00:03:32,593 --> 00:03:35,223
I'll take care of the footage from the area. Just know that.

43
00:03:35,894 --> 00:03:38,364
Father. Did you know...

44
00:03:39,264 --> 00:03:41,163
that Mr. Gong killed Jung Won's father too?

45
00:03:43,304 --> 00:03:44,604
You...

46
00:03:47,003 --> 00:03:49,973
didn't order him to do that, did you?

47
00:03:55,014 --> 00:03:56,584
Come straight to my place when you're back in Seoul.

48
00:04:21,204 --> 00:04:22,673
Go back to Mueon...

49
00:04:22,673 --> 00:04:25,314
and delete all the security footage records from Mount Mueon.

50
00:04:25,314 --> 00:04:26,613
I wasn't caught on camera, so don't worry...

51
00:04:26,613 --> 00:04:27,814
Not you.

52
00:04:28,413 --> 00:04:31,514
I'm worried Woo Jae was caught on camera on January 10.

53
00:04:33,884 --> 00:04:34,884
Understood, sir.

54
00:04:34,884 --> 00:04:36,923
Chairman Jang will visit Mujin Resort tomorrow...

55
00:04:36,923 --> 00:04:38,694
to attend the conference.

56
00:04:39,524 --> 00:04:41,663
Make sure Woo Jae and his wife can greet him in person.

57
00:04:42,624 --> 00:04:43,663
Yes, sir.

58
00:04:44,264 --> 00:04:46,593
The video from the camera Yoo Yoon Young hid.

59
00:04:46,593 --> 00:04:47,903
Jung Won found it.

60
00:04:50,733 --> 00:04:52,673
The problem is, she's convinced...

61
00:04:53,834 --> 00:04:55,744
the man in the video...

62
00:04:55,744 --> 00:04:58,473
is the same man who killed her father.

63
00:05:01,074 --> 00:05:02,113
Look at me.

64
00:05:03,744 --> 00:05:06,384
Didn't you say Jung Won fainted right away?

65
00:05:07,153 --> 00:05:08,254
Did you lie?

66
00:05:08,954 --> 00:05:09,983
No, sir.

67
00:05:10,153 --> 00:05:12,853
If you covered your face, how would she know it was the same man?

68
00:05:16,723 --> 00:05:18,494
Woo Jae saw the video too.

69
00:05:19,293 --> 00:05:22,103
He asked if I ordered Jung Won's father to be killed.

70
00:05:22,103 --> 00:05:23,564
I'll say it was all me,

71
00:05:23,733 --> 00:05:24,774
and you weren't involved...

72
00:05:24,774 --> 00:05:26,574
He won't go for it.

73
00:05:27,004 --> 00:05:28,343
Once he knows the truth,

74
00:05:28,343 --> 00:05:30,673
he'll want to tell his wife.

75
00:05:36,584 --> 00:05:37,983
Why now?

76
00:05:40,954 --> 00:05:43,153
You've never once let me down.

77
00:05:44,283 --> 00:05:45,394
Have your skills gotten rusty?

78
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:51,024
- I apologize. - I'm not demanding an apology.

79
00:05:52,334 --> 00:05:54,463
Bring me a solution.

80
00:06:17,283 --> 00:06:19,723
Mr. Seol. Youngho Group's Chairman Jang...

81
00:06:19,723 --> 00:06:22,524
is at Mujin Resort for a conference.

82
00:06:22,723 --> 00:06:25,233
Your father wishes you to greet him in person.

83
00:06:25,963 --> 00:06:28,504
He wants you to be present as well, Ms. Seo.

84
00:06:29,564 --> 00:06:31,934
- Come with me. - Jung Won hurt her ankle.

85
00:06:33,403 --> 00:06:34,473
She'll greet him another time.

86
00:06:34,473 --> 00:06:37,374
How about you come alone to greet the chairman, then?

87
00:06:37,374 --> 00:06:38,413
Why do you...

88
00:06:39,113 --> 00:06:40,973
make me repeat myself?

89
00:06:45,684 --> 00:06:46,754
I apologize.

90
00:06:51,053 --> 00:06:52,093
Let's go.

91
00:07:22,584 --> 00:07:24,694
You had to see me get humiliated.

92
00:07:25,494 --> 00:07:26,524
That was embarrassing.

93
00:07:38,173 --> 00:07:39,173
Tae Heon.

94
00:07:39,733 --> 00:07:40,803
I heard.

95
00:07:40,803 --> 00:07:42,673
You're here about Lee Ba Reun's murder.

96
00:07:44,774 --> 00:07:45,874
Will you return to Seoul today?

97
00:07:47,874 --> 00:07:50,613
- Yes. - Shall we get lunch if you haven't?

98
00:07:57,524 --> 00:07:58,524
Sorry.

99
00:07:59,954 --> 00:08:02,423
What with the murder and skeleton we found...

100
00:08:04,324 --> 00:08:05,394
It's quite a headache.

101
00:08:06,293 --> 00:08:07,863
I knew the victim too.

102
00:08:08,434 --> 00:08:09,434
You should be...

103
00:08:09,803 --> 00:08:11,733
even more careful to keep your feelings in check.

104
00:08:14,704 --> 00:08:15,774
I will.

105
00:08:21,944 --> 00:08:23,014
Hello, sir.

106
00:08:24,613 --> 00:08:25,653
Sure.

107
00:08:28,783 --> 00:08:32,153
I have something to take care of. I can't join you for lunch.

108
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:35,823
Mr. Gong.

109
00:08:37,624 --> 00:08:40,234
Can we have dinner instead?

110
00:08:41,663 --> 00:08:44,063
Okay. See you back in Seoul.

111
00:09:08,224 --> 00:09:09,323
Will you...

112
00:09:11,293 --> 00:09:12,533
find the killer yourself?

113
00:09:12,533 --> 00:09:14,134
My dad and then Ba Reun.

114
00:09:15,433 --> 00:09:17,033
He took away...

115
00:09:18,073 --> 00:09:19,433
two people that meant a lot to me.

116
00:09:21,673 --> 00:09:23,443
Who is this person?

117
00:09:23,774 --> 00:09:26,144
Why are they connected to me so viciously?

118
00:09:26,844 --> 00:09:28,384
I will find out, no matter what.

119
00:09:38,653 --> 00:09:39,994
Was it fate?

120
00:09:41,193 --> 00:09:43,264
I witnessed Cha Eun Sae's death...

121
00:09:43,264 --> 00:09:44,563
and came this far.

122
00:09:47,533 --> 00:09:48,703
It feels like...

123
00:09:50,764 --> 00:09:52,474
a massive mountain...

124
00:09:53,173 --> 00:09:54,403
that I can't avoid.

125
00:09:57,274 --> 00:09:58,413
I must do...

126
00:09:59,043 --> 00:10:01,073
whatever it takes to get over it.

127
00:10:02,884 --> 00:10:03,913
Is that mountain...

128
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:07,614
me?

129
00:10:12,793 --> 00:10:16,293
I'm the reason you got involved in Eun Sae's death.

130
00:10:30,173 --> 00:10:31,573
You rebelled like this...

131
00:10:31,573 --> 00:10:33,313
when you got your cigarettes confiscated in school.

132
00:10:33,313 --> 00:10:34,573
Come here, you punk.

133
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:36,114
Let go of me.

134
00:10:38,043 --> 00:10:40,514
My gosh. You haven't aged at all.

135
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:42,224
Who are you, mister? Are you a thug?

136
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:43,583
I'm a cop, you brat.

137
00:10:44,183 --> 00:10:45,224
You little...

138
00:10:45,953 --> 00:10:46,953
Tae Heon.

139
00:10:47,494 --> 00:10:48,594
Give up.

140
00:10:49,464 --> 00:10:50,923
For Reporter Seo...

141
00:10:51,494 --> 00:10:52,663
and for your own sake too.

142
00:10:58,673 --> 00:11:00,303
There's no way he did it.

143
00:11:01,073 --> 00:11:03,703
He's an ex cop and a better man than anyone.

144
00:11:05,344 --> 00:11:06,344
It's not him.

145
00:11:08,043 --> 00:11:09,144
It can't be him.

146
00:11:14,453 --> 00:11:16,783
- Hi. - Gong Joon Ho's phone.

147
00:11:16,783 --> 00:11:18,594
It was at Seol Pan Ho's all day.

148
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:20,323
Seol Woo Jae's father's place?

149
00:11:20,754 --> 00:11:21,894
Was it anywhere else?

150
00:11:21,894 --> 00:11:24,293
No. I think he was there all along.

151
00:11:27,234 --> 00:11:28,303
Okay.

152
00:11:36,774 --> 00:11:39,644
You must leave now if you want to be on time.

153
00:11:39,744 --> 00:11:42,884
Missing one campaign event won't affect my support ratings.

154
00:11:43,014 --> 00:11:45,583
You should attend all planned events.

155
00:11:46,653 --> 00:11:47,754
Darn it.

156
00:11:54,124 --> 00:11:57,693
I thought I'd gotten the upper hand this time.

157
00:11:58,563 --> 00:12:02,663
Forget 49 percent of the profits of Mujin's second resort,

158
00:12:02,903 --> 00:12:05,303
I ended up upsetting him and it looks like...

159
00:12:06,004 --> 00:12:08,903
I might lose much more than I can gain.

160
00:12:10,543 --> 00:12:13,413
How much is 49 percent of the profits expected to be?

161
00:12:13,614 --> 00:12:16,783
We think it'll be about 44.3 million dollars.

162
00:12:16,984 --> 00:12:18,514
Oh, gosh...

163
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,754
That much...

164
00:12:22,354 --> 00:12:25,754
would cover whatever I need for this election...

165
00:12:26,653 --> 00:12:28,823
and my presidential campaign and free me...

166
00:12:28,823 --> 00:12:30,464
from Seol Pan Ho's grasp.

167
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:32,264
What will you do, sir?

168
00:12:33,734 --> 00:12:36,134
I'll give him this for now,

169
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:39,474
and pretend to bow to him.

170
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:41,104
When a fight's dragged on,

171
00:12:41,573 --> 00:12:43,073
the rich man wins.

172
00:12:43,073 --> 00:12:44,504
If you bow to him now,

173
00:12:45,144 --> 00:12:48,644
Chairman Seol will believe he has full control over you.

174
00:12:48,644 --> 00:12:50,443
He'll make even more exorbitant demands.

175
00:12:50,844 --> 00:12:51,854
Before he does,

176
00:12:52,214 --> 00:12:56,024
I must find something else to strangle him with.

177
00:12:56,923 --> 00:12:58,254
Do you have something?

178
00:13:01,094 --> 00:13:04,464
That detective guy, Kim Tae Heon.

179
00:13:04,933 --> 00:13:06,764
Yesterday, out of the blue,

180
00:13:08,033 --> 00:13:10,464
he tracked Secretary Gong's phone.

181
00:13:10,734 --> 00:13:13,004
- Chairman Seol's secretary? - You know...

182
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:15,943
my hunch on these matters is never wrong.

183
00:13:38,634 --> 00:13:39,634
In many ways,

184
00:13:41,033 --> 00:13:42,634
it will be hard to bear,

185
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:44,533
and it will hurt,

186
00:13:45,004 --> 00:13:46,673
but let's try to get through it.

187
00:13:47,933 --> 00:13:48,943
Bye.

188
00:14:13,864 --> 00:14:15,104
Come over now.

189
00:14:28,443 --> 00:14:30,484
How could the pattern on the knife be the same?

(January 10, 2010)

196
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:59,162
It totally pays off getting accepted to the Police University.

197
00:14:59,592 --> 00:15:01,162
Who knew I would be having a fancy meal like this?

198
00:15:02,662 --> 00:15:05,062
You barely passed the exam and got lucky. Don't show off now.

199
00:15:05,062 --> 00:15:06,062
Eat up.

200
00:15:06,832 --> 00:15:07,861
Seriously?

201
00:15:11,572 --> 00:15:13,202
You're dressed in black from head to toe.

202
00:15:13,702 --> 00:15:14,741
And you're wearing a baseball cap.

203
00:15:15,172 --> 00:15:16,542
You just came from a stakeout, right?

204
00:15:16,542 --> 00:15:19,042
Or do you have to go on a stakeout later?

205
00:15:20,442 --> 00:15:22,582
I must leave in ten minutes. Eat quickly.

206
00:15:22,651 --> 00:15:23,712
Where are you going?

207
00:15:24,151 --> 00:15:25,322
Can I tag along?

208
00:15:25,981 --> 00:15:27,722
To get a taste of being a detective before I join the force.

209
00:15:27,722 --> 00:15:28,891
You're getting cheeky again.

210
00:15:32,062 --> 00:15:34,092
Are you trying to beat up a junior who hasn't even started school yet?

211
00:15:34,562 --> 00:15:36,092
What kind of detective are you?

212
00:15:39,761 --> 00:15:40,761
You know that you're the reason...

213
00:15:40,761 --> 00:15:42,001
I applied to the Police University, right?

214
00:15:42,702 --> 00:15:44,332
What kind of cop do you think I will be?

215
00:15:44,501 --> 00:15:46,172
Just don't turn into a cop like me.

("KBM Reporter Seo Sang Gyeon Found Dead at Home After Attack")

217
00:15:54,542 --> 00:15:55,981
He couldn't have had a knife with the same pattern...

218
00:15:57,212 --> 00:15:58,881
as the culprit and dressed in the same outfit...

219
00:15:58,881 --> 00:16:00,552
as the culprit on the day her dad was murdered.

220
00:16:02,491 --> 00:16:03,722
It can't be a coincidence.

221
00:16:09,761 --> 00:16:12,832
The chairman wanted to see me. Let's take a rain check on dinner.

222
00:16:41,062 --> 00:16:42,162
Well, now that...

223
00:16:43,692 --> 00:16:45,361
I decided to be a despicable man,

224
00:16:45,802 --> 00:16:47,601
I'm willing to look the other way even if you were behind...

225
00:16:48,802 --> 00:16:50,101
Eun Sae's and Lee Ba Reun's murder.

226
00:16:51,001 --> 00:16:52,072
But...

227
00:16:52,472 --> 00:16:55,312
I can't do the same with Jung Won's father's murder.

228
00:16:57,611 --> 00:16:58,712
Dad.

229
00:17:02,651 --> 00:17:03,651
Dad.

230
00:17:04,712 --> 00:17:08,021
Please tell me you had nothing to do with his murder.

231
00:17:08,952 --> 00:17:11,251
You had no reason to kill him.

232
00:17:13,662 --> 00:17:14,991
Put yourself in Jung Won's shoes.

233
00:17:15,561 --> 00:17:17,331
Having a man who's responsible for her father's death...

234
00:17:17,331 --> 00:17:18,501
as her father-in-law...

235
00:17:20,061 --> 00:17:21,501
That just shouldn't happen to anyone.

236
00:17:22,301 --> 00:17:23,771
Reporter Seo Sang Gyeon...

237
00:17:24,331 --> 00:17:26,801
was investigating me persistently back then.

238
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:30,672
He must've gotten wind of corruption when I was establishing...

239
00:17:30,672 --> 00:17:32,241
the first resort.

240
00:17:33,612 --> 00:17:36,811
It's my guess that he followed the car you were driving that night,

241
00:17:37,511 --> 00:17:39,722
thinking I was the one driving.

242
00:18:05,981 --> 00:18:07,241
I doubt that he happened...

243
00:18:07,241 --> 00:18:09,452
to witness your hit-and-run accident merely by chance.

244
00:18:11,581 --> 00:18:13,251
So Jung Won's father...

245
00:18:13,422 --> 00:18:14,751
He got in touch with me...

246
00:18:14,751 --> 00:18:16,192
and blackmailed me saying that...

247
00:18:16,192 --> 00:18:17,392
he had filmed a video of the accident with his camera.

248
00:18:17,692 --> 00:18:19,821
So did you get Secretary Gong...

249
00:18:24,932 --> 00:18:26,301
to kill her father?

250
00:18:40,712 --> 00:18:43,612
You should have just sent me to prison when you had the chance.

251
00:18:44,051 --> 00:18:45,281
How could you let...

252
00:18:46,321 --> 00:18:48,422
Jung Won be your daughter-in-law? How could you?

253
00:18:48,452 --> 00:18:49,922
I clearly disapproved of your decision.

254
00:18:49,922 --> 00:18:52,622
You should've told me the real reason for your disapproval.

255
00:18:53,192 --> 00:18:55,261
You should've told me it wasn't because she was an orphan.

256
00:18:55,591 --> 00:18:58,192
You should've said you disapproved because you killed her father!

257
00:19:00,602 --> 00:19:03,231
Had I known the truth, I would have never married her.

258
00:19:04,172 --> 00:19:05,442
I would have given up.

259
00:19:09,071 --> 00:19:10,212
Why aren't you saying anything?

260
00:19:10,811 --> 00:19:13,412
Come on. Say something!

261
00:19:13,682 --> 00:19:16,551
I made all of these decisions for your sake.

262
00:19:22,652 --> 00:19:24,722
So the result of the decisions you made for my sake...

263
00:19:27,021 --> 00:19:28,091
is that Jung Won...

264
00:19:30,162 --> 00:19:32,061
became a family with the murderer...

265
00:19:32,061 --> 00:19:33,602
who killed her father.

266
00:19:33,602 --> 00:19:35,001
- Seol Woo Jae. - Dad.

267
00:19:36,902 --> 00:19:37,902
Dad.

268
00:19:38,771 --> 00:19:40,442
Do you think I'll be able to carry on...

269
00:19:40,442 --> 00:19:42,472
as her husband and as your son as if nothing had happened?

270
00:19:42,571 --> 00:19:43,942
Do you think that's possible?

271
00:19:43,942 --> 00:19:45,281
If it's not possible,

272
00:19:45,412 --> 00:19:47,912
will you tell the truth to your wife?

273
00:19:49,112 --> 00:19:51,682
You'll have to reveal your crime too, not just mine.

274
00:19:52,781 --> 00:19:53,882
Your child...

275
00:19:53,981 --> 00:19:56,491
will have to live forever as a murderer's child.

276
00:19:58,622 --> 00:20:01,091
Get a grip for your child's sake.

277
00:21:25,112 --> 00:21:27,142
I should have never met you.

278
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:30,712
I should have never loved you.

279
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:43,610
I'll drink it for you.

280
00:21:43,909 --> 00:21:45,240
I'll get totally wasted.

281
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:56,360
Gosh, Tae Heon.

282
00:21:56,889 --> 00:21:58,290
You got your hunch.

283
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,729
I guess there's something suspicious about him.

284
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:02,360
There is, isn't there?

285
00:22:02,959 --> 00:22:05,060
Gosh. This is bad.

286
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:09,740
If Gong Joon Ho is indeed the culprit, what will you do?

287
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,610
What would you do if I were a murderer?

288
00:22:20,379 --> 00:22:21,550
Gosh.

289
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:23,379
I should arrest you.

290
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:29,290
Of course, you should.

291
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:32,260
Gosh. I really hope he's not the culprit.

292
00:22:34,189 --> 00:22:35,600
If you find any clues that he's the culprit,

293
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,959
will you share that with Ms. Seo?

294
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:40,199
The moment I share that with her, she'll be more reckless than me.

295
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,169
So I can't. It's too dangerous.

296
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:02,219
Getting betrayed by my friend wasn't enough.

297
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:09,300
I'm about to get betrayed by a man who was a father figure to me too.

298
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,300
Not just any man. He's a former police officer.

299
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:22,479
I couldn't even forgive you for taking bribes.

300
00:23:23,909 --> 00:23:25,479
But killing an innocent man...

301
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:08,250
What should I do?

302
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,189
How do I go on with my life after this?

303
00:24:28,209 --> 00:24:31,280
Gosh, I thought I'd at least get to say goodbye to him.

304
00:24:31,909 --> 00:24:33,179
That brat...

305
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:37,050
What do we do? I feel so bad for him.

306
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:40,449
Hey, stop.

307
00:24:40,649 --> 00:24:43,820
I'm really sad too, but Jung Won has no energy left to cry.

308
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:49,830
Let's do a report on this and catch the scumbag who killed Ba Reun.

309
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:51,959
We can live stream on YouTube, you know?

310
00:24:52,369 --> 00:24:53,800
Let's find that scumbag...

311
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,570
and avenge Ba Reun's death. Let's do that.

312
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:57,840
- What do you say? - Does that mean...

313
00:24:58,869 --> 00:25:01,310
you'll follow Jung Won and hand in your resignation too?

314
00:25:01,939 --> 00:25:04,139
No, that's not what I meant. I just...

315
00:25:04,379 --> 00:25:06,649
got a little worked up. It was a slip of the tongue.

316
00:25:09,379 --> 00:25:11,919
I put Mr. No in charge of covering Ba Reun's case.

317
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:14,850
I told him to keep digging until the end, however long it took.

318
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:17,619
Even if everyone else forgets about the case,

319
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:19,260
I'll never forget.

320
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:20,560
I won't forget either.

321
00:25:21,459 --> 00:25:23,629
You and the team will keep on digging through KBM...

322
00:25:23,629 --> 00:25:24,699
while I do the same outside.

323
00:25:25,669 --> 00:25:27,070
Let's track down the killer.

324
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:36,939
(Vote for Gangwon's hopeful future!)

325
00:25:36,939 --> 00:25:39,810
(Fair Election for Brighter Future of Korea)

326
00:25:40,179 --> 00:25:41,550
- Assemblyman Mo, please look here. - Look here.

327
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:42,949
- Look at the camera. - Look here.

328
00:25:42,949 --> 00:25:44,719
- Thank you. - Thank you.

329
00:25:44,879 --> 00:25:47,290
We must never forget.

330
00:25:47,719 --> 00:25:48,820
Moving on to the next report.

331
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:52,060
Early voting for the local elections...

332
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:54,530
takes place for two days, starting today.

333
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:57,159
We prepared a report on how to vote, things to keep in mind,

334
00:25:57,159 --> 00:25:59,369
and the voting hours so you can all exercise your right to vote.

335
00:25:59,369 --> 00:26:02,699
Reporter Kim Kyung Sun has more on this.

336
00:26:03,369 --> 00:26:04,439
Tae Heon.

337
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:07,169
They've just released Lee Na Ri's autopsy report.

338
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:10,780
About the hairline fracture on the right side of the skull,

339
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:12,110
it looks like Mo Soo Rin was right,

340
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:14,110
and Yoo Yoon Young really hit her with a fire extinguisher.

341
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:16,479
"Crush fractures in the fibula, scapula,"

342
00:26:16,479 --> 00:26:18,320
"and lumbar spine?" That means...

343
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,050
It certainly means the toxic gas wasn't the cause of death.

344
00:26:21,449 --> 00:26:22,719
If she had crush fractures,

345
00:26:23,189 --> 00:26:24,990
it means she was hit with a blunt weapon, fell.

346
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:26,189
or died in a car accident.

347
00:26:27,429 --> 00:26:29,100
Lee Na Ri? No.

348
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:33,399
Mr. Hong, our driver at the time, was driving,

349
00:26:33,399 --> 00:26:35,129
and I was sitting in the passenger seat.

350
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:39,310
We hit Min Chul, so I called it in.

351
00:26:39,709 --> 00:26:40,770
It was a car accident.

352
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:43,840
Seol Woo Jae brought up a car accident himself.

353
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,909
So it was a hit-and-run?

354
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:48,110
She was either in the car that he hit,

355
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:49,550
or he ran over her with the car.

356
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:52,350
Whether he directly hit her with the car or not,

357
00:26:52,719 --> 00:26:54,790
that guy really scares me.

358
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:56,060
I mean, she was his girlfriend.

359
00:26:56,119 --> 00:26:58,020
If it wasn't Seol Woo Jae, that means it was Mr. Gong.

361

362
00:27:03,899 --> 00:27:05,129
as per Chairman Seol's order...

363
00:27:05,129 --> 00:27:07,570
Gong Joon Ho? Because he's Chairman Seol's secretary,

364
00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:08,869
it must be his job to clean up everyone's messes.

365
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:13,969
We need evidence that he was working for Chairman Seol at the time too.

366
00:27:13,969 --> 00:27:15,270
That way, we can say he had motives...

367
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:16,740
for killing Lee Na Ri and Cha Eun Sae.

368
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:19,879

370

Well, they say money conquers all, but do you think...

371
00:27:25,689 --> 00:27:28,149
he was desperate to the point that he had to kill someone?

372
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:34,030
Your life isn't that easy either.

373

He said...

376
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,669
his sister had a rare disease.

377
00:27:47,969 --> 00:27:49,280
He told me her medications alone...

378
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,580
cost a few hundred thousand dollars every year.

379
00:27:51,879 --> 00:27:53,750
That was the reason he left the police force...

380
00:27:54,149 --> 00:27:55,479
and joined Mujin Group.

381
00:27:55,479 --> 00:27:57,320
When did he join Mujin Group?

382
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:59,649
I found out later, so I don't know the exact date.

383

We must prove that the link between them dates back to 2009.

Mr. Gong said he'd told his sister about me.

I'm young enough to be his son, but we're close friends.

to find a witness.

405
00:29:21,229 --> 00:29:24,070
I suddenly remembered him telling me that his sister was here,

406
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:25,100
so I decided to drop by.

407
00:29:26,709 --> 00:29:28,770
Thank you for visiting me.

410

The pain comes back when the drugs wear off,

411
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:39,619
but it goes away again when the injections kick in.

412
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:41,689
He told me the name of your disease in the past,

413
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:44,459
but I forgot as it was such a difficult name.

414
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:47,459
Even for me, it takes a few moments to remember what it was called.

415
00:29:49,199 --> 00:29:52,129
But I'm glad the disease is treatable.

416
00:29:52,699 --> 00:29:54,830
That's a curse for my brother.

418
00:29:57,399 --> 00:29:59,669
he's had to spend more money than he earned.

419
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:02,639
When exactly were you diagnosed with the disease?

420
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:05,379
I believe it was over ten years ago.

421
00:30:05,379 --> 00:30:07,350
In 2009.

422
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:10,250
You must've been devastated back then.

423
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:12,619
Your medications must be very expensive too.

424
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:15,419
That was when things started going downhill.

425
00:30:16,459 --> 00:30:19,560
My brother got into debt. He even borrowed money from loan sharks.

426
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:21,790
Back then, he was a cop.

427
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,530
How did he handle all the extra expenses?

428
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:26,429
He couldn't handle it,

429
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:30,300
so I was going to just kill myself.

430
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:34,510
But he found me in a few hours and told me...

431
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:37,340
he'd found a sponsor. He told me not to worry.

432
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:39,449
A sponsor?

433
00:30:41,479 --> 00:30:42,649
Did he tell you who it was?

434
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:44,949
The chairman of some company.

435
00:30:44,949 --> 00:30:47,050
Do you happen to know which company it was?

436
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:51,919
I think he said it was a construction company.

437
00:30:53,159 --> 00:30:55,229
Thanks to that person, I'm still alive.

438
00:31:05,639 --> 00:31:07,369
His sister was diagnosed with the rare disease...

439
00:31:07,709 --> 00:31:09,209
before the fire broke out at Bongto Factory.

440
00:31:09,479 --> 00:31:11,780
She said a construction company chairman helped them financially.

441
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,810
I bet it was Seol Pan Ho from Mujin Construction.

442
00:31:14,409 --> 00:31:16,850
So they've been working together since then.

443
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:18,820
Hey, did you look into that thing?

444
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:22,320
Gong Joon Ho got employment insurance...

445
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,320
through Mujin Construction in 2012,

446
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,590
so I believe that was when he officially joined the company.

447
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:29,699
Then from the time they found out about her disease in 2009...

448
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,530
to the time he officially joined Mujin Group,

449
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:33,729
he paid her medical bills with the money from the sponsor, so...

450
00:31:33,869 --> 00:31:35,129
So we can plausibly deduce...

451
00:31:35,129 --> 00:31:37,240
that he was paid to kill those people.

at the time, to your father-in-law and Mo Hyung Taek,

539
00:36:55,189 --> 00:36:56,959
your dad would've been a thorn in their side.

540
00:36:57,028 --> 00:36:58,229
Why Mo Hyung Taek?

541
00:36:58,229 --> 00:37:00,858
He invested a great deal in the resort.

542
00:37:01,128 --> 00:37:03,468
It was a joint venture between the two.

543
00:37:04,229 --> 00:37:07,298
I guarantee you. They were allies for a long time,

544
00:37:08,439 --> 00:37:10,468
so they'll know each other's weaknesses the best.

545
00:37:11,108 --> 00:37:12,668
They broke laws and found loopholes.

546
00:37:13,378 --> 00:37:14,608
It's obvious what they did.

547
00:37:19,048 --> 00:37:20,218
It can't be, can it?

548
00:37:20,548 --> 00:37:21,548
What do you mean?

549
00:37:22,948 --> 00:37:24,218
Did one of them...

550
00:37:25,718 --> 00:37:27,289
get rid of my dad?

551
00:37:28,659 --> 00:37:29,988
Why jump to that conclusion?

552
00:37:30,729 --> 00:37:33,128
They wouldn't have gone that far.

553
00:37:34,898 --> 00:37:36,298
One of them...

554
00:37:37,099 --> 00:37:38,568
is your father-in-law.

555
00:37:40,198 --> 00:37:41,198
My dad...

556
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:43,568
must had known the truth.

557
00:37:44,939 --> 00:37:46,778
I must find out somehow.

558
00:37:47,278 --> 00:37:48,738
Did you not find anything...

559
00:37:49,979 --> 00:37:51,309
among his belongings?

560
00:37:55,048 --> 00:37:56,179
I have to go.

561
00:38:35,258 --> 00:38:37,159
(Jan. 9. Clear proof. Never found or destroyed. To get them at once.)

562
00:38:40,628 --> 00:38:41,729
(Dec. 25. Mueon Cartel, Corrupt development plus alpha)

563
00:38:41,729 --> 00:38:43,769
(What truth should come first?)

564
00:38:45,668 --> 00:38:48,898
He wrote this the day after the factory fire.

565
00:38:51,668 --> 00:38:53,439
Rather than Bongto Factory,

566
00:38:53,439 --> 00:38:55,878
he was looking into the construction...

567
00:38:55,878 --> 00:38:56,948
of Mujin's resort.

568
00:38:58,108 --> 00:38:59,309
What I can say for sure is,

569
00:38:59,508 --> 00:39:02,048
at the time, to your father-in-law and Mo Hyung Taek,

570
00:39:02,479 --> 00:39:04,189
your dad would've been a thorn in their side.

571
00:39:11,429 --> 00:39:14,099
He invested a great deal in the resort.

572
00:39:14,429 --> 00:39:16,698
It was a joint venture between the two.

573
00:39:18,398 --> 00:39:19,668
What if the Mueon Cartel...

574
00:39:20,468 --> 00:39:22,099
is my father-in-law and Mo Hyung Taek?

575
00:39:23,968 --> 00:39:25,568
Did one of them kill my dad,

576
00:39:26,439 --> 00:39:27,479
Lee Na Ri,

577
00:39:28,139 --> 00:39:29,278
and Ba Reun too?

578
00:39:37,488 --> 00:39:39,349
(Father)

579
00:39:44,229 --> 00:39:45,229
Hello, Father.

580
00:39:45,229 --> 00:39:46,599
Come to my place now.

581
00:40:06,151 --> 00:40:08,620
(3 years ago)

582
00:40:11,065 --> 00:40:13,505
In there is something for the story...

583
00:40:14,335 --> 00:40:15,436
you're researching.

584
00:40:16,306 --> 00:40:17,976
You're looking into how Director Shin...

585
00:40:18,275 --> 00:40:19,505
got his son a job.

586
00:40:19,846 --> 00:40:21,945
You really won't mind if I go on my show to expose...

587
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:25,085
one of Mujin's directors for doing something illegal?

588
00:40:25,346 --> 00:40:26,616
I would mind.

589
00:40:27,286 --> 00:40:29,056
I told you...

590
00:40:29,485 --> 00:40:30,886
that you changed me.

591
00:40:31,456 --> 00:40:33,396
You must've gotten this from your father.

592
00:40:33,625 --> 00:40:34,956
Forget the damage it'll do to Mujin.

593
00:40:35,655 --> 00:40:37,996
What if it damages your relationship with your father?

594
00:40:40,766 --> 00:40:41,795
It won't.

595
00:40:42,335 --> 00:40:44,405
My father never stores anything on a computer.

596
00:40:44,405 --> 00:40:47,175
He keeps the originals in document form.

597
00:40:47,405 --> 00:40:49,476
I went and scanned everything.

598
00:40:53,815 --> 00:40:56,715
Somewhere in this house must be...

599
00:40:56,715 --> 00:40:58,445
the secret documents on the resort.

600
00:40:59,686 --> 00:41:00,755
It's possible...

601
00:41:01,085 --> 00:41:04,025
there might even be a clue to my dad's death.

602
00:41:05,386 --> 00:41:06,485
Ms. Seo.

603
00:41:20,675 --> 00:41:23,675
I heard Woo Jae sternly warned the PR Team.

604
00:41:24,175 --> 00:41:26,746
I hope you don't think that will stop all future articles.

605
00:41:28,545 --> 00:41:30,045
I can put pressure on you...

606
00:41:30,045 --> 00:41:31,985
without using the media.

607
00:41:32,686 --> 00:41:33,715
For example,

608
00:41:33,715 --> 00:41:36,386
I could get the writer you're staying with fired.

609
00:41:37,025 --> 00:41:40,355
I could also bring up your scandal with the detective.

610
00:41:41,826 --> 00:41:44,826
Do you think I only have photos from the hospital roof?

611
00:41:46,636 --> 00:41:49,536
Jung Won. I don't want to go that far.

612
00:41:50,936 --> 00:41:52,306
Woo Jae said to me...

613
00:41:52,806 --> 00:41:54,976
he'd rather avoid doing something that you hate...

614
00:41:54,976 --> 00:41:57,545
instead of trying to do ten things that you like.

615
00:41:59,605 --> 00:42:02,916
How obsessed must someone become to say something like that?

616
00:42:04,916 --> 00:42:07,255
I can't allow order within my family to crumble any further.

617
00:42:07,985 --> 00:42:10,985
Move back in with Woo Jae while I ask you nicely.

618
00:42:19,726 --> 00:42:22,936
Whatever you have to tell her can go through me.

619
00:42:24,565 --> 00:42:26,505
Why did you call Jung Won over and stress her out?

620
00:42:26,706 --> 00:42:28,136
Did I stress you out?

621
00:42:28,936 --> 00:42:30,005
No.

622
00:42:31,706 --> 00:42:32,846
He didn't.

623
00:42:39,346 --> 00:42:42,516
I realized that I was quite inconsiderate.

624
00:42:43,655 --> 00:42:45,085
I only cared about my feelings.

625
00:42:45,556 --> 00:42:47,755
I didn't think about how people would perceive this.

626
00:42:49,155 --> 00:42:51,925
If you believe I made our family look improper,

627
00:42:52,326 --> 00:42:53,735
I will move back in here.

628
00:43:00,636 --> 00:43:03,005
I don't want to go back to my old house...

629
00:43:03,445 --> 00:43:04,806
due to my memory of getting abducted.

630
00:43:05,875 --> 00:43:07,275
I'll come back tomorrow with my things.

631
00:43:08,715 --> 00:43:11,646
You want to live here from now on?

632
00:43:19,085 --> 00:43:20,255
I'll move back in too.

633
00:43:23,925 --> 00:43:27,396
There will be a sense of warmth in my house for once.

634
00:43:36,505 --> 00:43:37,905
You said you would move in here.

635
00:43:41,646 --> 00:43:42,675
Did you mean that?

636
00:43:43,016 --> 00:43:45,386
- Yes. - When did you decide that?

637
00:43:46,116 --> 00:43:47,215
A while ago.

638
00:43:48,186 --> 00:43:49,855
If I'm never going to win this fight,

639
00:43:50,326 --> 00:43:51,386
I thought staying here...

640
00:43:52,326 --> 00:43:53,726
would be better than our house.

641
00:43:55,195 --> 00:43:56,556
You don't have to move back in.

642
00:43:56,826 --> 00:43:58,496
I have to move anyway.

643
00:43:59,965 --> 00:44:01,096
I put the house on the market.

644
00:44:03,605 --> 00:44:06,065
Wherever I look, the house is just a reminder of you.

645
00:44:10,246 --> 00:44:12,175
It makes me miss you like crazy.

646
00:44:42,405 --> 00:44:44,875
Gosh. His life seems so boring.

647
00:44:45,306 --> 00:44:47,175
Chairman Seol's house, the office, and home.

648
00:44:47,175 --> 00:44:48,846
Rinse and repeat.

649
00:44:51,616 --> 00:44:53,715
You don't think he knows that you're on to him, right?

650
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:56,056
I must catch him before he figures out that I am.

651
00:44:58,226 --> 00:45:00,896
The knife is our only lead. I can't think of any other way.

652
00:45:00,956 --> 00:45:02,496
You mean the one with the swirling pattern?

653
00:45:03,255 --> 00:45:05,025
Even if you were to find that, it wouldn't do much.

654
00:45:05,025 --> 00:45:06,125
Forget about arresting him for Ms. Seo's father's murder.

655
00:45:06,125 --> 00:45:07,596
We won't even find Cha's blood on it.

656
00:45:07,596 --> 00:45:09,235
I'm sure he already cleaned it.

657
00:45:09,235 --> 00:45:10,266
If we use it as the murder weapon...

658
00:45:10,266 --> 00:45:11,936
in a simulation test for Cha's murder,

659
00:45:11,936 --> 00:45:13,266
the result will say it's a match.

660
00:45:14,936 --> 00:45:16,206
You're right.

661
00:45:16,206 --> 00:45:18,945
We'll be able to at least get a warrant for Cha's case.

662
00:45:19,175 --> 00:45:20,775
We must find the knife as soon as possible.

663
00:45:21,516 --> 00:45:22,916
I must bring him down...

664
00:45:23,516 --> 00:45:25,315
to investigate Seol Woo Jae's case.

665
00:45:28,054 --> 00:45:29,419
(Ryu Ji Hye of Hansu Newspaper)

666
00:45:29,443 --> 00:45:31,224
Back in the day, Ms. Ryu...

667
00:45:31,224 --> 00:45:33,164
often shared intel with your dad because she was also...

668
00:45:33,164 --> 00:45:35,664
investigating the corruption behind Mujin Resort's development.

669
00:45:36,063 --> 00:45:38,034
I had to ask around a lot to find her for you.

670
00:45:38,034 --> 00:45:39,034
That was all me.

671
00:45:39,264 --> 00:45:40,403
So you also investigated...

672
00:45:40,403 --> 00:45:42,503
Chairman Seol Pan Ho and Prosecutor Mo Hyung Taek,

673
00:45:42,503 --> 00:45:43,673
correct?

674
00:45:43,673 --> 00:45:44,773
I did.

675
00:45:45,604 --> 00:45:48,213
But it's iffy for me to talk freely because he's your father-in-law.

676
00:45:48,574 --> 00:45:49,813
That's unnecessary.

677
00:45:50,613 --> 00:45:52,084
I'm investigating him too.

678
00:45:59,023 --> 00:46:02,293
This is the memo my dad wrote after the fire at Bongto Factory.

679
00:46:02,454 --> 00:46:04,023
"Mueon Cartel?"

680
00:46:04,394 --> 00:46:06,093
"Corruption behind the development and more."

681
00:46:06,093 --> 00:46:07,863
"Which truth should be prioritized?"

682
00:46:07,863 --> 00:46:09,793
What? What's this about?

683
00:46:09,863 --> 00:46:12,963
My father found out about Lee Na Ri's death.

684
00:46:13,403 --> 00:46:16,074
When he blackmailed someone about her death, he was murdered.

685
00:46:17,043 --> 00:46:18,543
It says, "And more."

686
00:46:18,874 --> 00:46:21,113
He was alluding to Lee Na Ri's death.

687
00:46:21,874 --> 00:46:22,974
Oh, my.

688
00:46:23,514 --> 00:46:25,244
Back then, your father took it to another level...

689
00:46:25,244 --> 00:46:26,954
when he started to bother those two.

690
00:46:28,454 --> 00:46:30,554
I didn't know this was the story behind that.

691
00:46:30,584 --> 00:46:32,854
Back then, did my father allude to you about the possibility...

692
00:46:33,483 --> 00:46:35,454
of another crime they committed?

693
00:46:35,724 --> 00:46:37,363
Or did he say anything relevant?

694
00:46:37,764 --> 00:46:39,423
Didn't you and Sang Gyeon work together...

695
00:46:39,423 --> 00:46:41,133
to investigate a relevant incident?

696
00:46:42,034 --> 00:46:43,804
On the day of the fire at Bongto Factory,

697
00:46:44,403 --> 00:46:47,133
there was a crash, involving a truck on the path leading to the factory.

698
00:46:49,304 --> 00:46:52,244
(December 24, 2009)

699
00:46:57,784 --> 00:46:59,284
- Gosh. What is this? - What's going on?

700
00:46:59,543 --> 00:47:00,653
- What's this? - Come on.

701
00:47:03,584 --> 00:47:04,824
- Hurry. - Get him out.

702
00:47:05,184 --> 00:47:06,423
Sir, are you okay?

703
00:47:06,423 --> 00:47:08,753
It was suspicious that the path was blocked...

704
00:47:08,753 --> 00:47:11,224
right before the arrival of the firetrucks.

705
00:47:11,824 --> 00:47:13,523
Your father and I were so shocked.

706
00:47:14,633 --> 00:47:17,403
Because they arrived late, the factory burned down.

707
00:47:18,563 --> 00:47:20,034
It looked like a coincidence,

708
00:47:20,273 --> 00:47:21,934
but it definitely worked in their favor.

709
00:47:21,934 --> 00:47:22,974
Right.

710
00:47:23,374 --> 00:47:25,843
Thanks to the fire, they were able to wipe out the factory site.

711
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:28,414
"Did they block the path on purpose?"

712
00:47:28,574 --> 00:47:30,613
"They're more than capable of doing so."

713
00:47:31,244 --> 00:47:32,284
That's what we talked about.

714
00:47:32,744 --> 00:47:35,753
Did you have any evidence to back up your suspicion?

715
00:47:35,883 --> 00:47:38,883
Back then, we were tracking a phone number along with the case.

716
00:47:39,284 --> 00:47:40,793
The truck driver who caused the accident...

717
00:47:40,793 --> 00:47:43,124
talked to this person for several days.

718
00:47:43,124 --> 00:47:45,063
When I looked into the number, it came from a burner phone.

719
00:47:45,394 --> 00:47:47,293
So you think someone must have paid him to do so, right?

720
00:47:47,534 --> 00:47:49,133
That was my suspicion.

721
00:47:49,733 --> 00:47:51,704
But the case was closed as an accident...

722
00:47:51,704 --> 00:47:53,063
because he fell asleep while driving.

723
00:47:53,204 --> 00:47:54,903
There was nothing more I could do.

724
00:47:55,934 --> 00:47:58,074
Could you share the number of the burner phone...

725
00:47:58,074 --> 00:47:59,244
you were tracking?

726
00:47:59,244 --> 00:48:00,644
Actually, I found it and brought it with me.

727
00:48:02,273 --> 00:48:04,284
But it said the number didn't exist anymore.

728
00:48:10,324 --> 00:48:11,354
One more thing.

729
00:48:11,684 --> 00:48:14,253
Do you know where the truck driver is imprisoned?

730
00:48:14,593 --> 00:48:15,854
I'd like to meet with him.

731
00:48:16,693 --> 00:48:18,563
I know someone who can help me. I'll look into it for you.

732
00:48:51,093 --> 00:48:53,124
Why is she bringing a suitcase into that house?

733
00:48:58,764 --> 00:49:00,133
I will get you out of...

734
00:49:00,804 --> 00:49:02,673
that miserable place as soon as I can.

735
00:49:17,584 --> 00:49:20,624
Is Father not home yet?

736
00:49:20,693 --> 00:49:21,693
No.

737
00:49:22,293 --> 00:49:24,894
I got the guest room ready for your use.

738
00:49:24,894 --> 00:49:25,923
This way.

739
00:49:39,903 --> 00:49:41,673
The chairman was happy all day because...

740
00:49:41,673 --> 00:49:43,514
you and your husband were moving into the house.

741
00:49:45,014 --> 00:49:47,584
Don't you usually get off work...

742
00:49:47,584 --> 00:49:48,753
around this time?

743
00:49:48,883 --> 00:49:51,753
I'll get going now that I see you settled in.

744
00:50:03,534 --> 00:50:05,363
("Truck Collides at Entry of Factory Fire Site in Mueon")

745
00:50:07,133 --> 00:50:09,503
("Truck Crash Blocks Path to Bongto Factory and Delays Firetrucks")

746
00:50:10,374 --> 00:50:12,244
If this accident was intentional,

747
00:50:12,704 --> 00:50:15,874
Father or Mo Hyung Taek must be behind it.

748
00:50:17,213 --> 00:50:18,644
Or they could be accomplices.

749
00:50:21,054 --> 00:50:22,383
(Reporter Ryu Ji Hye)

750
00:50:22,983 --> 00:50:24,423
Hello, Ms. Ryu.

751
00:50:25,054 --> 00:50:27,293
I asked around where the truck driver was now.

752
00:50:27,494 --> 00:50:30,054
He committed suicide in prison ten years ago.

753
00:50:30,693 --> 00:50:31,764
What?

754
00:51:01,253 --> 00:51:03,124
I was just about to go to your room.

755
00:51:03,423 --> 00:51:05,994
The chairman personally ordered this for you.

756
00:51:06,463 --> 00:51:09,164
I'm feeling a bit nauseous. I'll drink it later.

757
00:51:09,764 --> 00:51:10,863
I need a vase.

758
00:51:11,063 --> 00:51:12,164
Hold on.

759
00:51:13,304 --> 00:51:14,374
Let me do it for you.

760
00:51:21,773 --> 00:51:25,284
Now that I'm going to live here, I realize how big this house is.

761
00:51:25,284 --> 00:51:27,954
The house will feel less empty now that you and your husband...

762
00:51:27,954 --> 00:51:29,784
will be living here.

763
00:51:29,954 --> 00:51:30,954
I see.

764
00:51:32,423 --> 00:51:34,954
Are there things about which I should be careful around the house?

765
00:51:34,954 --> 00:51:38,293
Like rooms I'm not supposed to enter or so on.

766
00:51:38,523 --> 00:51:40,563
No one is allowed to enter the last room...

767
00:51:40,563 --> 00:51:42,063
on the same floor as the chairman's study.

768
00:51:45,063 --> 00:51:46,334
Where should I put these flowers?

769
00:51:47,374 --> 00:51:48,733
I bought them as a present for Father.

770
00:51:48,834 --> 00:51:50,474
So I'll put them in his study.

771
00:51:50,604 --> 00:51:51,604
Okay.

772
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:47,664
You're home, Father.

773
00:52:51,133 --> 00:52:52,363
I bought you some flowers.

774
00:52:53,164 --> 00:52:55,273
I put them here. I was just about to leave.

775
00:52:58,104 --> 00:52:59,104
Please excuse me.

776
00:53:01,644 --> 00:53:05,184
"A rebuke cuts into a man of discernment..."

777
00:53:05,184 --> 00:53:09,554
"deeper than a hundred lashes cut into a fool."

778
00:53:10,883 --> 00:53:14,093
I know why you're here, so quit acting.

779
00:53:23,394 --> 00:53:25,834
The development of the first Mujin Resort...

780
00:53:25,834 --> 00:53:27,233
went well without any issues.

781
00:53:28,534 --> 00:53:31,244
We're about to embark on the development of the second resort,

782
00:53:31,574 --> 00:53:33,043
so no more funny business.

783
00:53:42,253 --> 00:53:43,684
Thanks for the flowers, my daughter-in-law.

784
00:54:07,943 --> 00:54:09,874
I got my hands on some information about the truck driver's mother.

785
00:54:10,883 --> 00:54:12,514
I called the phone number to check.

786
00:54:13,284 --> 00:54:15,213
I told her I was a reporter. She wants to meet right away...

787
00:54:15,213 --> 00:54:16,883
as if she wants to prove her son's innocence or something.

788
00:54:18,983 --> 00:54:20,054
Hello?

789
00:54:20,624 --> 00:54:21,824
Hello? Are you there?

790
00:54:22,394 --> 00:54:23,454
Oh, yes.

791
00:54:24,824 --> 00:54:26,994
Send me her information.

792
00:54:26,994 --> 00:54:28,193
I'll meet her.

793
00:54:42,974 --> 00:54:45,313
- Hey. - Tae Heon, we need you here now.

794
00:54:45,313 --> 00:54:47,383
- Why? - Someone showed up...

795
00:54:47,383 --> 00:54:49,284
and said he killed Lee Ba Reun.

796
00:54:49,584 --> 00:54:51,584
From the date to the location and time, it all checks out.

797
00:54:51,584 --> 00:54:53,684
He even submitted a rope, saying he used it to kill Lee.

798
00:55:00,764 --> 00:55:02,193
They created a fake culprit?

799
00:55:02,593 --> 00:55:04,704
Hurry back here so we can find out whether or not he's fake.

800
00:55:04,704 --> 00:55:05,934
You should interview him.

801
00:55:07,474 --> 00:55:09,104
I should just raid Gong Joon Ho now.

802
00:55:09,104 --> 00:55:10,633
- What? - We can't stall any longer.

803
00:55:10,633 --> 00:55:13,074
I will find the knife with the tornado symbol on it.

804
00:55:13,903 --> 00:55:14,974
How?

805
00:55:14,974 --> 00:55:16,874
Have Team Two interview him.

806
00:55:16,874 --> 00:55:18,213
Just do as I say.

807
00:55:31,764 --> 00:55:33,164
Tae Heon came to see you?

808
00:55:33,724 --> 00:55:34,894
What did he ask you?

809
00:55:35,863 --> 00:55:38,633
I asked your sister when she was diagnosed with the rare disease.

810
00:55:44,773 --> 00:55:46,304
She said she was diagnosed in 2009,

811
00:55:47,343 --> 00:55:49,874
and a construction company chairman took care of her medical expenses.

812
00:55:50,644 --> 00:55:52,983
It was Chairman Seol Pan Ho of Mujin Construction, wasn't it?

813
00:55:54,983 --> 00:55:57,184
Cha Eun Sae was stabbed with a knife with a tornado symbol on it.

814
00:55:59,923 --> 00:56:01,093
That knife is yours, right?

815
00:56:04,224 --> 00:56:07,363
You also killed Jung Won's father with that knife. Am I wrong?

816
00:56:09,233 --> 00:56:11,063
If I'm wrong, you can say so.

817
00:56:12,664 --> 00:56:15,773
I want to be wrong, so go ahead and tell me so.

818
00:56:16,804 --> 00:56:18,304
What are you talking about?

819
00:56:18,304 --> 00:56:19,574
You know what I'm talking about.

820
00:56:19,574 --> 00:56:20,843
You know everything!

821
00:56:25,483 --> 00:56:28,454
Are you happy you saved your sister by taking innocent lives?

822
00:56:30,054 --> 00:56:32,354
- Stop. - You need to stop.

823
00:56:34,084 --> 00:56:36,653
I'll give you one last chance, so turn yourself in.

824
00:56:36,653 --> 00:56:37,724
Please, do it for me.

825
00:56:39,164 --> 00:56:42,193
Turn in the knife, and let's go to the precinct together. Please.

826
00:56:42,193 --> 00:56:44,834
I guarantee you that you'll regret this later.

827
00:56:50,104 --> 00:56:51,543
I knew it'd be useless,

828
00:56:54,543 --> 00:56:56,843
but I was hopeful for a moment.

829
00:57:00,144 --> 00:57:01,213
Mr. Gong.

830
00:57:12,124 --> 00:57:14,563
I will search you to find the knife.

831
00:57:17,264 --> 00:57:18,264
Tae Heon!

832
00:57:44,923 --> 00:57:45,923
Tae Heon.

833
00:57:46,494 --> 00:57:47,534
Tae Heon!

834
00:58:53,407 --> 00:58:56,407
(Nothing Uncovered)

835
00:58:56,482 --> 00:58:59,121
Did you know this? I chose you...

836
00:58:59,121 --> 00:59:01,261
because of how desperate you were, not because of your capabilities.

837
00:59:01,261 --> 00:59:03,292
No one can beat a desperate man.

838
00:59:03,621 --> 00:59:06,891
That time, he paid my overdue hospital bills at once.

839
00:59:06,891 --> 00:59:08,632
So you think he was bribed?

840
00:59:09,002 --> 00:59:11,801
"Violent Crimes Unit, Songo Police, Gong Joon Ho."

841
00:59:12,172 --> 00:59:13,772
Father, were you the one behind it?

842
00:59:13,772 --> 00:59:15,002
My father too.

843
00:59:15,042 --> 00:59:17,542
Gong Joon Ho wasn't my secretary in 2009.

844
00:59:17,542 --> 00:59:20,141
Mo Hyung Taek was the one who introduced him to me.

845
00:59:20,442 --> 00:59:21,911
Mr. Gong promised me...

846
00:59:21,911 --> 00:59:24,042
he'd take the fall for everything you did if he got caught.

847
00:59:24,042 --> 00:59:26,212
You ordered him to cause the accident too, didn't you?

848
00:59:26,681 --> 00:59:29,621
I really can't imagine the world without you.

849
00:59:29,882 --> 00:59:32,652
I'll never leave you.

850
00:59:33,022 --> 00:59:34,051
I promise.

851
00:59:34,051 --> 00:59:35,721
Father, when I'm your age,

852
00:59:36,592 --> 00:59:38,192
I'll be a monster too, right?
