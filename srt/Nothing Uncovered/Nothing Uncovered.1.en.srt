Sir, you look like
you've lost a lot of weight.

I bet you've lost your appetite
because of Assemblyperson Ko.

12
00:00:51,999 --> 00:00:53,728
- That jerk.
- I just said that...

13
00:00:53,728 --> 00:00:54,929
- He's so thorough.
- the meeting was taking too long...

14
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:57,999
because of the chatty ladies. How
exactly does that belittle women?

15
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:01,168
They have the nerve
to mess with the party leader.

16
00:01:02,009 --> 00:01:04,079
So, what do you plan to do
with Assemblyperson Ko?

17
00:01:04,408 --> 00:01:07,109
I called you over, Mr. No,
to pick your brains.

18
00:01:09,878 --> 00:01:11,278
Send him off in one fell swoop.

19
00:01:11,749 --> 00:01:13,049
Bring it to me on paper.

20
00:01:13,348 --> 00:01:15,749

You want something more powerful.

26
00:01:29,898 --> 00:01:31,669
Nothing should be done sloppily.

27

Don't you think it's rude?

I listened to a past recording
of you and Mr. No.

You two agreed to meet next week.

38
00:02:16,508 --> 00:02:18,379
You typed up an article already?

39
00:02:18,618 --> 00:02:20,118
Did you and Assemblyman Mo...

40
00:02:20,118 --> 00:02:21,889
decide to get rid
of Assemblyperson Ko?

00:02:22,389 --> 00:02:23,588
No.

00:02:26,488 --> 00:02:28,558
asked a reporter
to write a certain article?

I'm giving you a chance
to explain yourself.

45
00:02:30,998 --> 00:02:33,599
Do you have nothing to say?

46
00:02:33,898 --> 00:02:36,898
You're saying I incited him
to write something just because...

47
00:02:36,898 --> 00:02:38,099
we met in private?

48
00:02:38,699 --> 00:02:41,509
Aren't you trying
a bit too hard to frame me?

49
00:02:42,738 --> 00:02:44,778
Isn't this a conspiracy?

50
00:02:47,109 --> 00:02:49,549
You met a week ago
to discuss something,

51
00:02:49,549 --> 00:02:51,849
and the reporter brought you
a typed-up article.

52
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,419
You're even suggesting
what and how to air.

53
00:02:54,419 --> 00:02:56,319
Wouldn't you call this colluding?

54
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,458
You really are feisty
and relentless.

55
00:03:02,289 --> 00:03:05,599
I see why Chairman Seol
worries about his daughter-in-law.

56
00:03:07,028 --> 00:03:08,099
Too bad.

57
00:03:08,528 --> 00:03:11,139

sees this broadcast,

58

a friend too.

and journalists...

63

must always keep their distance.

64

but never too far apart.

00:10:55,555 --> 00:10:57,996
How can I turn off something so fun?

182
00:10:57,996 --> 00:10:59,326
Then watch it somewhere else.

183
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:01,126
Hey, Ace, I heard you scored.

184
00:11:01,126 --> 00:11:02,395
I did the shooting, though.

185
00:11:02,925 --> 00:11:05,935
Stop getting on my nerves
and just go home and sleep.

186
00:11:05,935 --> 00:11:07,435
- Gosh.
- Hello.

187
00:11:07,435 --> 00:11:10,165
- "Nothing Uncovered" begins now.
- Why do you have to sound so rude?

188
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:13,175
- An influential politician...
- Too bad I can't curse at you.

189
00:11:13,175 --> 00:11:15,246
- Go ahead and see what I do.
- and a reporter...

190
00:11:15,246 --> 00:11:17,645
The politician and the reporter
are denying that...

191
00:11:17,645 --> 00:11:18,645
they know each other.

192
00:11:18,645 --> 00:11:20,476
In fact,
the back-scratching alliance...

193
00:11:20,476 --> 00:11:21,946
of politicians and the press...

194
00:11:21,946 --> 00:11:23,315
is difficult to prove.

195
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:24,315
("Nothing Uncovered")

196
00:11:24,315 --> 00:11:26,415
However,
"Nothing Uncovered" was able...

197
00:11:26,415 --> 00:11:27,456
- Gosh. She said she'd be...
- to expose the alliance...

198
00:11:27,456 --> 00:11:28,486
- the top reporter in three years.
- between Assemblyman Mo...

199
00:11:28,486 --> 00:11:29,726
And she kept her word.

200
00:11:29,726 --> 00:11:31,295
- and a certain reporter...
- She's so cool.

201
00:11:31,295 --> 00:11:32,596
through this video.

202
00:11:38,096 --> 00:11:39,295
I got the money through
the wire transfer.

203
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:42,565
But why do you not want to use
what we found on Mo Hyung Taek?

204
00:11:42,966 --> 00:11:45,175
It was a peripheral hit,
not a direct hit.

205
00:11:45,576 --> 00:11:47,206
Look into the stock scammer too.

206
00:11:47,606 --> 00:11:49,706
So no signs of Lee Yi Jin yet,
right?

207
00:11:49,946 --> 00:11:53,145
Come on. You know how it goes.
What's up with the question?

208
00:11:53,645 --> 00:11:56,545
You know that I get insecure
when my episodes air.

209
00:11:56,545 --> 00:11:58,586
Your episode was a hit.
You should learn to enjoy the win.

210
00:11:58,586 --> 00:12:00,456
That's how people end up
ruining their careers.

211
00:12:01,086 --> 00:12:02,285
Are you busy these days?

212
00:12:02,756 --> 00:12:04,555
That's a yellow card.
No questions about my personal life.

213
00:12:04,996 --> 00:12:07,055
This loner act of yours is making me
want to look into you even more.

214
00:12:08,826 --> 00:12:10,935
You know that you won't get anything
even if you try.

215
00:12:11,435 --> 00:12:12,435
Bye.

216
00:12:27,846 --> 00:12:29,015
Good work.

217
00:12:36,185 --> 00:12:38,155
You should have waited inside.
You didn't have to come out.

218
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:43,295
Well, I was sick of always waiting
for my busy wife inside.

219
00:12:43,765 --> 00:12:46,496
Hey, that was some truth to it.
You're dissing me, right?

220
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:48,435
You seem tired.

221
00:12:49,606 --> 00:12:50,606
Let me give you a piggyback ride.

222
00:12:51,976 --> 00:12:53,775
- Get up.
- I'll give you a piggyback ride.

223
00:12:54,706 --> 00:12:55,775
- Yes?
- You're embarrassing me.

224
00:13:00,415 --> 00:13:01,486
You don't want to go, right?

225
00:13:03,545 --> 00:13:04,555
No.

226
00:13:04,716 --> 00:13:07,216
It's been a while since I last saw him.
So I'm so excited.

227
00:13:07,586 --> 00:13:08,655
I see.

228
00:13:08,925 --> 00:13:10,126
Then can you give me
a piggyback ride?

229
00:13:11,025 --> 00:13:12,055
What?

230
00:13:21,305 --> 00:13:24,876
My daughter-in-law is about
to cost me a friend of 20 years.

231
00:13:25,275 --> 00:13:28,545
Given the nature of the program,
I couldn't give you a heads-up.

232
00:13:28,946 --> 00:13:31,015
There's a line you mustn't cross
to disgrace your own family.

233
00:13:32,216 --> 00:13:33,446
This kind of action shows...

234
00:13:33,446 --> 00:13:34,846
the importance
of coming from a good family.

235
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:39,015
I'm the one disgracing our family.

236
00:13:39,315 --> 00:13:41,986
I'm cooped up in my room
and writing a novel.

237
00:13:42,626 --> 00:13:44,126
If I cut my ties with you,

238
00:13:44,126 --> 00:13:45,226
I'll be an orphan too.

239
00:13:45,226 --> 00:13:46,555
So I wouldn't have come
from a good family.

240
00:13:47,496 --> 00:13:49,265
I got a business card
from a reporter earlier.

241
00:13:49,795 --> 00:13:51,466
Should I call the reporter
and tell the truth?

242
00:13:51,765 --> 00:13:53,935
That you only accepted her
as your daughter-in-law...

243
00:13:53,935 --> 00:13:55,135
because I declared...

244
00:13:55,135 --> 00:13:57,635
I would live the rest of my life,
unmarried if you didn't.

245
00:13:58,206 --> 00:14:00,706
To carry on the family name,
you had no choice but to comply.

246
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:05,946
After having a huge fight
with your son last year,

247
00:14:06,446 --> 00:14:09,785
you told the couple not to visit you
until she got pregnant.

248
00:14:12,616 --> 00:14:15,525
But you finally saw them again
after months for an interview.

249
00:14:17,756 --> 00:14:18,826
This is nothing but a show.

250
00:14:19,155 --> 00:14:20,295
Seol Woo Jae.

251
00:14:24,565 --> 00:14:26,135
I'm sorry, Father.

252
00:14:28,035 --> 00:14:29,035
Gosh.

253
00:14:41,415 --> 00:14:42,415
Here.

254
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:45,256
Gosh.

255
00:14:46,086 --> 00:14:47,155
Your coat.

256
00:14:52,596 --> 00:14:53,626
You're tired, aren't you?

257
00:14:57,736 --> 00:15:00,795
Don't lie down on the sofa.
Get changed and lie down in bed.

258
00:15:00,895 --> 00:15:03,635
My energy is drained.
I don't want to do anything...

259
00:15:04,435 --> 00:15:05,535
because of somebody.

260
00:15:14,545 --> 00:15:16,315
I told you to let him have his way.

261
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:19,055
He thinks that he lost you to me.

262
00:15:19,756 --> 00:15:21,856
I couldn't watch him
criticize you like that.

263
00:15:30,395 --> 00:15:33,496
Well, it was wrong of me
not to listen to my wife.

264
00:15:36,065 --> 00:15:37,135
Wait.

265
00:15:43,045 --> 00:15:44,246
Ta-da.

266
00:15:46,275 --> 00:15:47,346
What's this?

267
00:15:49,486 --> 00:15:50,846
Have you forgotten what today is?

268
00:15:51,515 --> 00:15:54,185
It's not my birthday.
It's not our wedding anniversary.

269
00:15:56,925 --> 00:15:58,726
The first episode
of "Nothing Uncovered" aired...

270
00:15:58,726 --> 00:15:59,895
on this date three years ago.

271
00:16:00,826 --> 00:16:02,226
It's a present to celebrate
its third anniversary.

272
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:05,165
I had forgotten about it.

273
00:16:08,405 --> 00:16:09,836
Wasn't this really expensive?

274
00:16:10,236 --> 00:16:11,675
It was slightly pricey even for me.

275
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:14,706
Put it on me.

276
00:16:18,616 --> 00:16:19,716
Congratulations.

277
00:16:21,915 --> 00:16:23,616
Look. How do I look?

278
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:25,616
You look gorgeous.

279
00:16:31,395 --> 00:16:32,425
Jung Won.

280
00:16:35,425 --> 00:16:37,736
He's tenacious
at finding people's weaknesses.

281
00:16:38,866 --> 00:16:40,366
But the only weakness
he has on you...

282
00:16:40,665 --> 00:16:43,935
is that your parents aren't around.
You know that, right?

283
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:55,716
What's your weakness then?

284
00:16:58,655 --> 00:16:59,716
My weakness?

285
00:17:04,395 --> 00:17:05,395
You.

286
00:17:06,456 --> 00:17:07,496
Gosh.

287
00:17:08,126 --> 00:17:09,126
It's Seo Jung Won.

288
00:17:49,605 --> 00:17:51,636
("Nothing Uncovered")

289
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:03,785
Good morning, Jung Won.

290
00:18:03,785 --> 00:18:05,055
To me, a good morning means...

291
00:18:08,726 --> 00:18:10,226
It's the list of people
Lee Yi Jin targeted as victims.

292
00:18:10,226 --> 00:18:12,156
These VIPs received snow crabs
as a present from Lee Yi Jin.

293
00:18:12,456 --> 00:18:13,525
Reporters and prosecutors...

294
00:18:13,525 --> 00:18:14,966
along with politicians
were on the list.

295
00:18:16,926 --> 00:18:18,166
It is indeed a good morning.

296
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:24,436
Our rookie obtained...

297
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:26,406
the list of people
Lee Yi Jin sent presents to.

298
00:18:26,575 --> 00:18:29,545
Hey, you need to share that
with all of us.

299
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:31,416
How come she's always
the first one to get it?

300
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:33,446
Gosh. You and your criticism.

301
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:34,986
Compliment him
when he does a good job.

302
00:18:36,946 --> 00:18:38,456
Assemblyman Mo
reached out to you yesterday, right?

303
00:18:38,686 --> 00:18:39,815
What nonsense did he say?

304
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:43,285
Calling me had been a ritual
for everyone I had exposed so far.

305
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:44,855
But he skipped it.

306
00:18:44,855 --> 00:18:45,855
Is that so?

307
00:18:47,156 --> 00:18:49,025
Oh, right.
I heard this in the morning.

308
00:18:49,896 --> 00:18:52,035
Mo Hyung Taek has been sponsoring
Cha Eun Sae.

309
00:18:52,535 --> 00:18:53,765
The actress, Cha Eun Sae?

310
00:18:53,765 --> 00:18:56,535
Everything she says is
basically a lie. It's fake news.

311
00:18:56,966 --> 00:18:59,506
Ae Na, if you keep this up,
you'll go to prison. Stop it.

312
00:18:59,506 --> 00:19:00,706
If I'm wrong, then I'm wrong.

313
00:19:01,676 --> 00:19:04,105
His press conference is at 1 p.m.
Let's just watch that.

314
00:19:05,815 --> 00:19:08,686
Regardless of the reason,
my unsavory behaviors...

315
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:12,456
cause great concern
and worry among the public.

316
00:19:12,916 --> 00:19:14,416
For that, I apologize.

317
00:19:17,525 --> 00:19:20,055
Look at that. Even the mighty snake
is bowing down on camera...

318
00:19:20,196 --> 00:19:21,325
after Jung Won exposed him.

319
00:19:21,726 --> 00:19:23,226
You need to be careful.

320
00:19:23,265 --> 00:19:26,565
Mo Hyung Taek will try
to get back at you for this.

321
00:19:27,295 --> 00:19:29,265
I might attack him one more time
before he does that.

322
00:19:29,805 --> 00:19:30,936
I'm going to the police station.

323
00:19:41,386 --> 00:19:43,285
I found something new
on Mo Hyung Taek.

324
00:19:44,085 --> 00:19:45,085
(Mueon City chemical plant fire)

325
00:19:46,555 --> 00:19:48,325
(Bongto's chemical plant
in Mueon City, Gangwon Island...)

326
00:19:50,156 --> 00:19:52,125
(Consultation center for
investigation-related complaints)

327
00:20:01,936 --> 00:20:03,706
(Consultation center for
investigation-related complaints)

328
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:18,815
You're Reporter Seo Jung Won
from "Nothing Uncovered." Right?

329
00:20:21,085 --> 00:20:23,625
Yes. You're an actress.
Ms. Cha Eun Sae, right?

330
00:20:23,825 --> 00:20:24,855
Do you know me?

331
00:20:25,555 --> 00:20:26,555
Of course.

332
00:20:26,996 --> 00:20:29,295
I've gotten quite popular this year.

333
00:20:30,825 --> 00:20:32,436
I'm a fan.

334
00:20:32,636 --> 00:20:33,835
I always watch...

335
00:20:33,835 --> 00:20:36,335
your show, "Nothing Uncovered,"
every Friday.

336
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:38,436
Thank you.

337
00:20:38,805 --> 00:20:41,206
By the way, what brings you here?

338
00:20:41,236 --> 00:20:43,545
I filed a lawsuit against people
who left hate comments.

339
00:20:44,176 --> 00:20:46,275
I had to be questioned
as the plaintiff.

340
00:20:47,275 --> 00:20:49,946
Apparently, a certain assemblyman
has been sponsoring me.

341
00:20:50,785 --> 00:20:51,986
That's ridiculous.

342
00:20:52,615 --> 00:20:53,615
Oh, right.

343
00:20:53,615 --> 00:20:55,585
Mo Hyung Taek has been sponsoring
Cha Eun Sae.

344
00:20:56,525 --> 00:20:57,956
But I have a boyfriend.

345
00:20:58,226 --> 00:21:00,256
We've been dating
for almost a year now.

346
00:21:00,456 --> 00:21:01,865
I can't wait to marry him.

347
00:21:02,926 --> 00:21:03,966
Oh, right.

348
00:21:04,065 --> 00:21:06,035
Your husband writes novels,
doesn't he?

349
00:21:06,335 --> 00:21:09,335
My boyfriend is a writer too.

350
00:21:10,406 --> 00:21:11,476
I see.

351
00:21:12,736 --> 00:21:14,706
Oh, that necklace.

352
00:21:14,706 --> 00:21:16,605
It's from Herzeus, right?

353
00:21:16,605 --> 00:21:18,045
It's so pretty.

354
00:21:18,045 --> 00:21:20,275
I know it was a limited edition.
It must've been hard to get.

355
00:21:20,976 --> 00:21:22,716
My husband got it for me.

356
00:21:22,716 --> 00:21:23,815
I see.

357
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:28,186
Ms. Seo,
can we take a picture together?

358
00:21:28,555 --> 00:21:30,386
- Here.
- Yes. Why not?

359
00:21:32,496 --> 00:21:34,095
Since we're taking a selfie
together,

360
00:21:34,095 --> 00:21:36,825
can you grab me by the collar?

361
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:39,136
You did nothing wrong,

362
00:21:39,136 --> 00:21:40,365
so I'll put my arm
around your shoulder.

363
00:21:43,305 --> 00:21:45,636
Okay, I'll take it now.
One, two, three.

364
00:22:11,666 --> 00:22:13,936
We've located
Lee Yi Jin's burner phone.

365
00:22:14,035 --> 00:22:15,166
I'll head over there now.

366
00:22:29,815 --> 00:22:30,815
Yes.

367
00:22:33,456 --> 00:22:35,386
See the low-rise apartment building
on your right?

368
00:22:35,386 --> 00:22:36,486
Take the third alley you see.

369
00:22:37,025 --> 00:22:39,795
- Yes.
- Keep walking in your two o'clock.

370
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:51,636
It's a dead end.

371
00:22:52,305 --> 00:22:53,335
Really?

372
00:22:53,936 --> 00:22:55,045
Hold on.

373
00:22:55,906 --> 00:22:57,105
The GPS signal dropped.

374
00:22:57,105 --> 00:22:58,946
This jerk must've turned off
the burner phone.

375
00:23:20,636 --> 00:23:21,736
What's wrong?

376
00:24:00,006 --> 00:24:01,105
Excuse me.

377
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:04,476
Excuse me.

378
00:24:14,785 --> 00:24:16,686
Excuse me. Hello?

379
00:24:17,186 --> 00:24:19,756
Hello? Look at me!

380
00:25:16,903 --> 00:25:18,103
When I got here,

381
00:25:19,833 --> 00:25:21,403
she was already dead.

382
00:25:31,684 --> 00:25:32,954
The team from the NFS
is on their way.

383
00:25:35,684 --> 00:25:37,853
Ms. Seo, are you all right?

384
00:25:39,294 --> 00:25:40,694
I think she should be seen
by a doctor.

385
00:25:40,694 --> 00:25:43,123
She's the first witness.
She'll have to come with us.

386
00:26:15,264 --> 00:26:17,234
I'll take your statement now.

387
00:26:17,794 --> 00:26:19,934
Please describe the situation
and what you saw.

388
00:26:21,034 --> 00:26:22,764
When I was passing by the alleyway,

389
00:26:25,603 --> 00:26:26,674
I saw someone...

390
00:26:27,474 --> 00:26:29,004
on the balcony.

391
00:26:30,573 --> 00:26:31,873
Blood was dripping down.

392
00:26:33,073 --> 00:26:37,053
The door wasn't locked,
so I went inside.

393
00:26:41,353 --> 00:26:43,024
Why were you at the scene?

394
00:26:44,123 --> 00:26:45,194
Lee Yi Jin...

395
00:26:46,653 --> 00:26:48,194
I received a tip-off
about his location,

396
00:26:49,494 --> 00:26:50,893
so I was trying to track him down.

397
00:26:51,893 --> 00:26:53,964
It was a dead end,
so I turned around...

398
00:26:55,603 --> 00:26:56,903
and happened to see her,

399
00:26:59,504 --> 00:27:01,373
so I went inside
to see if she was alive.

400
00:27:02,174 --> 00:27:03,974
Did you see anyone
who looked suspicious?

401
00:27:04,744 --> 00:27:05,843
No.

402
00:27:08,583 --> 00:27:10,784
Yes, have you identified the victim?

403
00:27:12,383 --> 00:27:13,454
What?

404
00:27:15,254 --> 00:27:16,383
Okay.

405
00:27:23,794 --> 00:27:25,333
Did you and the victim
know each other?

406
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:29,004
How would I know who the victim was?

407
00:27:29,004 --> 00:27:31,034
So you're saying you didn't
approach her intentionally?

408
00:27:31,034 --> 00:27:32,103
"Intentionally?"

409
00:27:32,403 --> 00:27:34,044
What are you saying?

410
00:27:36,073 --> 00:27:38,113
What on earth happened?

411
00:27:49,454 --> 00:27:51,353
Ms. Jin was murdered?

412
00:27:51,754 --> 00:27:52,794
Yes, it's nuts.

413
00:27:53,254 --> 00:27:54,924
Detective Kim, I'm sure you heard...

414
00:27:54,924 --> 00:27:56,524
the victim was
Assemblyman Mo's housekeeper.

415
00:27:57,133 --> 00:27:59,434
He's the detective
in charge of the case.

416
00:27:59,434 --> 00:28:01,063
Lieutenant Kim Tae Heon.

417
00:28:02,704 --> 00:28:04,504
It only happened
a couple of hours ago.

418
00:28:04,504 --> 00:28:05,573
Why are you here?

419
00:28:05,674 --> 00:28:07,504
What do you think? I called him.

420
00:28:07,744 --> 00:28:10,174
The victim
actually missed work today.

421
00:28:10,174 --> 00:28:11,313
Without calling in advance?

422
00:28:11,313 --> 00:28:14,583
She texted. She said she wasn't
feeling well and needed a day off.

423
00:28:14,583 --> 00:28:16,214
Ms. Seo, what were you doing...

424
00:28:16,214 --> 00:28:18,553
at the scene of Ms. Jin's murder?

425
00:28:19,514 --> 00:28:22,153
Was slandering me on a TV show
not enough for you?

426
00:28:22,153 --> 00:28:23,424
What are you cooking up this time?

427
00:28:24,123 --> 00:28:25,524
I just happened to be walking by...

428
00:28:26,593 --> 00:28:29,163
and found her on the balcony, dead.

429
00:28:29,294 --> 00:28:30,534
You expect me to believe that?

430
00:28:31,363 --> 00:28:33,863
You, Reporter Seo Jung Won,

431
00:28:33,863 --> 00:28:35,964
broke into my housekeeper's home!

432
00:28:38,504 --> 00:28:40,873
I know you reporters
suspect everyone and everything...

433
00:28:40,873 --> 00:28:43,373
you see and hear, so please
explain this from your perspective.

434
00:28:49,044 --> 00:28:50,754
We know nothing for certain yet,

435
00:28:50,754 --> 00:28:51,954
so please calm down, both of you.

436
00:28:57,254 --> 00:28:59,194
Did the victim have family members
we should contact?

437
00:28:59,194 --> 00:29:01,863
She was widowed,
and she lived alone.

438
00:29:03,163 --> 00:29:04,194
Detective.

439
00:29:05,163 --> 00:29:07,964
Because of the TV show,
we have a lot to deal with at the moment,

440
00:29:07,964 --> 00:29:10,833
so we hope you don't go public
with Ms. Jin's identity for now.

441
00:29:15,643 --> 00:29:17,944
Sir, we'll be in touch again
after further investigation,

442
00:29:17,944 --> 00:29:19,613
so you should go home.

443
00:29:20,044 --> 00:29:21,143
All right.

444
00:29:21,343 --> 00:29:23,544
I really hope...

445
00:29:24,514 --> 00:29:26,184
you catch the killer soon.

446
00:29:28,184 --> 00:29:30,254
Sir. This way, please.

447
00:29:49,303 --> 00:29:50,313
Jung Won.

448
00:29:58,083 --> 00:29:59,153
Aren't you going to wash up?

449
00:30:17,133 --> 00:30:18,803
(Dead woman found at Ojeong-dong.)

450
00:30:18,803 --> 00:30:20,373
(Identified as Mo Hyung Taek's
housekeeper.)

451
00:31:23,133 --> 00:31:24,174
Jung Won.

452
00:31:27,474 --> 00:31:28,774
You didn't sleep at all.

453
00:31:29,403 --> 00:31:31,073
We don't want your insomnia
to come back.

454
00:31:31,674 --> 00:31:33,883
I should see a therapist.

455
00:31:34,613 --> 00:31:36,514
Okay. I'll make the reservation.

456
00:31:42,524 --> 00:31:44,893
Your phone's ringing.
I hear it vibrating.

457
00:31:46,093 --> 00:31:47,093
Hang on.

458
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:49,264
It's not mine.

459
00:31:50,393 --> 00:31:53,133
Is it not? You hear it too, right?

460
00:31:55,833 --> 00:31:58,504
Oh, it must be
our upstairs neighbor's phone.

461
00:31:58,903 --> 00:32:00,504
I heard it a few days ago too.

462
00:32:02,803 --> 00:32:03,813
Did you?

463
00:32:14,954 --> 00:32:17,093
(Do Not Enter, To Be Demolished)

464
00:32:18,994 --> 00:32:20,794

465
00:32:20,794 --> 00:32:22,063
Don't you dare take a sip.

(Do Not Enter, Police Line,
Ongoing Investigation)

467
00:32:55,464 --> 00:32:58,734
Jin Myung Sook has lived alone
since her divorce in 2008.

468
00:32:58,994 --> 00:33:00,863
She has no parents,
siblings, or kids.

469
00:33:01,663 --> 00:33:04,434
From the state of the place,
I'd say it was a robbery, right?

470
00:33:04,633 --> 00:33:06,573
They were definitely
looking for something.

471
00:33:06,573 --> 00:33:08,803
That must be the ex-husband.

472
00:33:09,244 --> 00:33:10,813
I'll locate him
as soon as we get back.

473
00:33:12,514 --> 00:33:14,284
The aide said she was a widow.

474
00:33:14,284 --> 00:33:16,313
I checked and he died in 2009.

475
00:33:17,044 --> 00:33:19,984
Oh, dear. Then there's no point
in looking up the ex-husband.

476
00:33:31,464 --> 00:33:32,694
(Mo Hyung Taek
elected to represent Gangha-gu)

477
00:33:32,794 --> 00:33:34,633
She scrapped articles
on Mo Hyung Taek.

478
00:33:35,234 --> 00:33:36,363
Is she a fanatic?

(12 dead, 2 gravely wounded)

485

- Any murder weapons?
- No.

486
00:33:52,853 --> 00:33:54,623
Jin's phone is missing too.

487
00:34:07,504 --> 00:34:10,434
There was blood outside too,
so it fits Ms. Seo's statement.

488
00:34:11,434 --> 00:34:12,833
She was stabbed in the stomach,

489
00:34:12,833 --> 00:34:15,603
and probably died
trying to flee the attacker.

490
00:34:20,583 --> 00:34:23,513
Do you often suffer from insomnia?

491
00:34:25,154 --> 00:34:26,783
I often stay up all night to work.

492
00:34:28,683 --> 00:34:29,723
Then...

493
00:34:31,123 --> 00:34:32,824
Even though you're a journalist,

494
00:34:33,194 --> 00:34:36,763
was this your first time
seeing a dead body?

495
00:34:39,393 --> 00:34:40,634
It wasn't my first time.

496
00:34:41,734 --> 00:34:43,433
When else did you see one?

497
00:34:44,004 --> 00:34:45,033
Was it for work?

498
00:34:46,634 --> 00:34:50,643
Was it similar to the sight
from yesterday or...

499
00:34:50,643 --> 00:34:52,774
I'm a bit busy.

500
00:34:53,444 --> 00:34:54,844
Just write me a prescription.

501
00:35:04,154 --> 00:35:06,524
Will this one broadcast
change the world?

502
00:35:06,794 --> 00:35:08,123
It won't.

503
00:35:08,524 --> 00:35:11,634
However, until it does change,
I won't stop...

504
00:35:11,634 --> 00:35:13,634
uncovering everything criminal.

505
00:35:13,634 --> 00:35:15,464
This part was so moving.

506
00:35:15,763 --> 00:35:17,304
Since then,
I've watched every episode.

507
00:35:18,304 --> 00:35:21,743
Through your show,
you exposed many criminals,

508
00:35:22,243 --> 00:35:24,044
and comforted the victims.

509
00:35:24,714 --> 00:35:28,044
I want to help you, the person
who did what no one else could.

510
00:35:29,743 --> 00:35:32,254
So that you can recover quickly,

511
00:35:32,614 --> 00:35:33,813
let's work together.

(Reporter Seo Jung Won suspected of
destroying murder scene)

513
00:35:48,134 --> 00:35:49,734
A woman is dead,

514
00:35:50,873 --> 00:35:53,404
and the public's attention
is warped.

515
00:35:54,344 --> 00:35:57,243
I express my regret
that Seo Jung Won...

516
00:35:58,074 --> 00:36:00,513
reported something scandalous
and roped me into it.

517
00:36:02,013 --> 00:36:03,884
So she walked in on us talking.

518
00:36:03,913 --> 00:36:06,953
Is it right for a journalist
to report immediately...

519
00:36:07,054 --> 00:36:09,024
in desperation
to secure an exclusive?

520
00:36:09,754 --> 00:36:12,924
With what intention did she visit
my housekeeper late at night?

521
00:36:13,654 --> 00:36:15,393
Another reporter suggested...

522
00:36:15,964 --> 00:36:17,763
she contaminated the crime scene.

523
00:36:17,964 --> 00:36:19,964
- I think...
- Seo Jung Won!

524
00:36:19,964 --> 00:36:21,563
What's the problem?

525
00:36:21,563 --> 00:36:23,933
I don't get why you're so upset.

526
00:36:24,533 --> 00:36:26,574
Did I report a complete lie?

527
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:30,444
Don't glare at me.
Speak up if you want to.

528
00:36:31,274 --> 00:36:32,913
It's a shame I'm too late.

529
00:36:33,344 --> 00:36:35,114
I was going to tip off my junior.

530
00:36:35,413 --> 00:36:36,484
You really move fast.

531
00:36:36,484 --> 00:36:39,783
Sure.
Go on acting like you're special.

532
00:36:40,114 --> 00:36:43,324
And don't read the nasty comments
about you that are under my article.

533
00:36:49,324 --> 00:36:50,364
What is it?

534
00:36:53,493 --> 00:36:55,904
People know I don't read comments,
so they're texting me instead.

535
00:36:56,904 --> 00:36:59,004
"Do you want to write about
seeing a body?"

536
00:36:59,074 --> 00:37:00,134
"She's psycho."

537
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:01,904
"You killed her for the exclusive,
didn't you?"

538
00:37:01,973 --> 00:37:03,743
"The murderer who messed up
the scene should go."

539
00:37:04,774 --> 00:37:06,344
You exposed them,

540
00:37:06,344 --> 00:37:09,513
so now Mo Hyung Taek
and No Ji Ho are coming for you.

541
00:37:09,513 --> 00:37:12,254
Do you want me
to hide and starve, then?

542
00:37:16,083 --> 00:37:17,223
I'm going home.

543
00:37:17,723 --> 00:37:18,754
Bye.

544
00:37:30,533 --> 00:37:32,274
(Uncover your husband
before you uncover others)

545
00:37:33,703 --> 00:37:35,143
This is just insane.

546
00:37:35,243 --> 00:37:37,544
What is it? Is something wrong?

00:37:37,774 --> 00:37:40,574
"Uncover your husband
before you uncover others."

548
00:37:41,783 --> 00:37:44,013
Earlier,
someone texted to call me...

549
00:37:44,013 --> 00:37:45,554
Mo's housekeeper's killer.

550
00:37:45,614 --> 00:37:46,614
What?

551
00:37:47,013 --> 00:37:48,824
Who was it? Give me the number.

552
00:37:48,924 --> 00:37:51,154
They're fake numbers.
You can't reach them.

553
00:37:51,824 --> 00:37:53,893
From now on,
I'll get screencaps of the texts...

554
00:37:54,464 --> 00:37:56,493
- and report them.
- You should.

555
00:37:59,734 --> 00:38:01,634
I'll call Mr. Moon the lawyer.

556
00:38:02,134 --> 00:38:04,333
Where are we going?

557
00:38:04,603 --> 00:38:08,373
(The late Seo Sang Gyeon)

558
00:38:12,274 --> 00:38:13,373
I thought...

559
00:38:14,413 --> 00:38:16,614
you'd miss your father
even more today.

560
00:38:19,683 --> 00:38:20,754
My dad...

561
00:38:22,083 --> 00:38:23,654
ended an article with this line.

562
00:38:24,794 --> 00:38:28,424
"Ignore the truth
and you will pay the price."

563
00:38:30,623 --> 00:38:32,294
I won't run away.

564
00:38:32,533 --> 00:38:34,063
You can run away sometimes.

565
00:38:35,103 --> 00:38:36,203
You have me.

566
00:38:46,674 --> 00:38:48,643
I'm so relieved to have you.

567
00:38:52,683 --> 00:38:54,353
I'll be there for you forever.

568
00:39:04,364 --> 00:39:06,634
(One month later)

569
00:39:28,683 --> 00:39:29,683
Jung Won.

570
00:39:30,824 --> 00:39:31,824
Wake up.

571
00:39:41,304 --> 00:39:42,333
Did you sleep well?

572
00:39:45,033 --> 00:39:46,574
You didn't have a nightmare
last night?

573
00:39:54,743 --> 00:39:55,944
You have therapy today, right?

574
00:39:56,683 --> 00:39:57,714
Yes.

575
00:40:05,123 --> 00:40:07,623
(How come you're not uncovering
your deceiving husband?)

576
00:40:09,263 --> 00:40:11,794
What is it? Did something go wrong?

577
00:40:12,533 --> 00:40:14,634
Remember the text message I got...

578
00:40:14,634 --> 00:40:16,134
from a long number
about a month ago?

579
00:40:16,134 --> 00:40:17,163
Yes, I do.

580
00:40:17,333 --> 00:40:19,304
Just like that time, I got
another message from a long number.

581
00:40:19,774 --> 00:40:20,833
Like this.

582
00:40:22,643 --> 00:40:23,873
What is this?

583
00:40:23,873 --> 00:40:25,513
This is going too far.

584
00:40:26,044 --> 00:40:27,413
You said you submitted
the text messages...

585
00:40:27,413 --> 00:40:29,143
when you filed a lawsuit
against the online haters, right?

586
00:40:29,614 --> 00:40:31,953
I did. But the police
couldn't track them down.

587
00:40:35,654 --> 00:40:36,754
Let's just ignore it.

588
00:40:37,723 --> 00:40:40,054
Wasting our energy on a useless text
like this would be our loss.

589
00:40:41,294 --> 00:40:42,393
Right.

590
00:40:45,464 --> 00:40:46,533
Honey.

591
00:40:50,063 --> 00:40:51,804
You're not hiding anything from me,
right?

592
00:40:52,873 --> 00:40:54,033
Are you serious?

593
00:40:54,504 --> 00:40:56,774
Other people will get suspicious
when they get messages like this.

594
00:40:56,774 --> 00:40:58,013
Wouldn't you feel the same?

595
00:40:58,013 --> 00:40:59,873
No. I wouldn't.

596
00:41:01,513 --> 00:41:02,614
Then I've got nothing to say.

597
00:41:03,044 --> 00:41:05,783
Okay. I'll ignore it like you said.

598
00:41:11,223 --> 00:41:12,393
Come on, don't be mad.

599
00:41:12,723 --> 00:41:15,694
I need to see your smile
for me to have a good day.

600
00:41:16,464 --> 00:41:18,063
Please?

601
00:41:21,504 --> 00:41:23,433
- Please?
- Stop it.

602
00:41:24,574 --> 00:41:25,634
Stop it.

603
00:41:28,643 --> 00:41:29,774
Seriously.

604
00:41:32,444 --> 00:41:33,844
- Stop it.
- How about now?

605
00:41:34,214 --> 00:41:36,384
- Stop it. You're cute.
- Now?

606
00:41:38,114 --> 00:41:41,353
I know what I want for dinner.
I'm craving your pasta.

607
00:41:41,683 --> 00:41:42,924
You'll come home early, right?

608
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:51,833

609
00:41:53,734 --> 00:41:55,404
When he won
the Reporter of the Year,

610
00:41:56,304 --> 00:41:58,103
he was over the moon
like a little kid.

611
00:41:58,103 --> 00:41:59,304

Reporter Seo Sang Gyeon rocks!
He's the best!

614
00:42:08,484 --> 00:42:09,714
I had no idea back then...

615
00:42:10,683 --> 00:42:13,083
that he would pass away
two months later.

616
00:42:13,714 --> 00:42:15,623
Your father was a reporter.

617
00:42:18,054 --> 00:42:21,424
I'm sorry for your loss.

618
00:42:21,424 --> 00:42:22,993
He wasn't just a regular reporter.

619
00:42:23,424 --> 00:42:26,033
He was a reporter
with the nickname, Scoop Hunter.

620
00:42:26,464 --> 00:42:28,063
You followed in his footsteps...

621
00:42:28,464 --> 00:42:30,234
and became the best reporter.

- I'll see you next time.
- Thank you.

the answer to that too.

with that then.

I had given him?

Oh, my. He acted so righteously.

660
00:45:29,313 --> 00:45:30,783

as a bribe?

We met in the restroom
at the police station.

668
00:45:47,333 --> 00:45:50,364
Yes. How did you get my number?

669

00:45:53,574 --> 00:45:56,603
if you could come to my house
right now.

- There's something...

I must tell you urgently.

You know, I thought a lot about this
before reading out.

675
00:46:02,583 --> 00:46:04,683
I had to muster up the courage
to call you.

676
00:46:05,283 --> 00:46:07,384
I thought it was now or never.

677
00:46:07,953 --> 00:46:09,984
I really hope you will help me.

678
00:46:10,853 --> 00:46:13,024
I'll be there. Text me your address.

679
00:46:14,094 --> 00:46:15,094
What is it?

something she had to tell me.

00:46:21,964 --> 00:46:23,464
- about a month ago.
- Yes.

685
00:46:24,033 --> 00:46:25,304

686
00:46:25,304 --> 00:46:26,574
Right now?

687
00:46:27,174 --> 00:46:29,004
I'm getting a feeling
this scoop will be huge.

688
00:46:29,004 --> 00:46:31,004
I'll go and get it before
she gives it to someone else.

689

No, I'm not.

- I love your husband.

00:48:05,904 --> 00:48:08,404
You're in a relationship
with my husband? Since when?

709
00:48:08,404 --> 00:48:10,574
I already told you
when we met in the restroom.

710
00:48:10,804 --> 00:48:12,643
We've been dating
for almost a year now.

711
00:48:13,373 --> 00:48:14,913
I can't wait to marry him.

712
00:48:15,544 --> 00:48:17,783
Your husband writes novels,
doesn't he?

713
00:48:17,783 --> 00:48:21,254
My boyfriend is a writer too.

714
00:48:26,324 --> 00:48:27,554
I gave you a hint too.

715
00:48:28,223 --> 00:48:29,623
I told you to uncover your husband.

716
00:48:30,123 --> 00:48:31,493
And that he was deceiving you.

717
00:48:33,833 --> 00:48:34,904
You're the one...

718
00:48:36,134 --> 00:48:37,464
who sent the text message?

719
00:48:37,464 --> 00:48:39,103
Unlike the sharp reporter
you pretended to be,

720
00:48:39,103 --> 00:48:41,234
it seemed you were clueless
about your husband.

721
00:48:44,703 --> 00:48:46,473
I got the first message a month ago.

722
00:48:47,944 --> 00:48:49,513
If you were truly
behind the message,

723
00:48:49,944 --> 00:48:51,554
how come you didn't reach out to me
for a month?

724
00:48:52,114 --> 00:48:53,813
Why did you send me
the second message today?

725
00:48:57,953 --> 00:48:59,324
Woo Jae told me that...

726
00:48:59,794 --> 00:49:02,493
he was going to divorce you
in a month and asked me to wait.

727
00:49:02,993 --> 00:49:05,634
So I waited for a month.
But he didn't divorce you.

728
00:49:07,063 --> 00:49:08,933
I sent you the message
as I was impatient.

729
00:49:08,933 --> 00:49:10,203
Do you expect me to believe this?

730
00:49:15,203 --> 00:49:18,044
It's a pity that you're trying
to find excuses not to believe me.

731
00:49:19,413 --> 00:49:20,544
Too bad.

732
00:49:21,944 --> 00:49:23,844
Woo Jae is the clingy one
in our relationship.

733
00:49:25,913 --> 00:49:27,683
If you are really in a relationship
with my husband,

734
00:49:28,183 --> 00:49:29,223
show me the proof.

735
00:49:29,223 --> 00:49:31,123
I don't want to. Why should I?

736
00:49:32,094 --> 00:49:33,893
You should call him and ask...

737
00:49:33,893 --> 00:49:35,263
if he's cheating on you with me.

738
00:49:36,094 --> 00:49:38,234
But I'm pretty sure he'll deny that.

739
00:49:43,603 --> 00:49:45,933
You led me to think you had a story
for me and made me come here.

740
00:49:46,533 --> 00:49:48,074
How come
you can't show me any proof?

741
00:49:48,074 --> 00:49:49,804
You're just all talk.

742
00:49:49,804 --> 00:49:51,513
I told you the truth.

743
00:49:51,513 --> 00:49:53,214
Finding the proof will be your job.

744
00:49:54,274 --> 00:49:56,183
Isn't that what reporters
are supposed to do?

745
00:49:58,554 --> 00:50:01,313
"Viewers of 'Nothing Uncovered.'"

746
00:50:01,313 --> 00:50:03,453
"Did my husband, Seol Woo Jae,"

747
00:50:03,453 --> 00:50:05,424
"really cheat on me
with Cha Eun Sae?"

748
00:50:05,424 --> 00:50:06,554
Is this fun for you?

749
00:50:09,263 --> 00:50:11,794
I bet you want to grab me
by the collar like this right now.

750
00:50:12,393 --> 00:50:15,063
Actually, no. Do you want
to slap me in the face?

751
00:50:15,833 --> 00:50:17,134
If you want to slap me, go ahead.

752
00:50:18,134 --> 00:50:19,574
Slap me all you want.

753
00:50:24,473 --> 00:50:26,074
You're not even worth my time.

754
00:50:29,583 --> 00:50:30,683
Divorce him.

755
00:50:32,513 --> 00:50:34,013
I'll never leave him.

756
00:50:34,554 --> 00:50:38,024
Divorce him as soon as you can
if you want to get hurt less.

757
00:50:44,563 --> 00:50:45,594
Listen carefully.

758
00:50:46,364 --> 00:50:48,304
It's up to me to decide
whether or not I'll get hurt.

759
00:50:48,634 --> 00:50:50,433
The same goes for whether or not
we'll get a divorce.

760
00:50:50,603 --> 00:50:51,933
Regardless of whether
you're right or wrong,

761
00:50:52,973 --> 00:50:55,203
there's nothing you can decide.
Do you know why that is?

762
00:50:55,444 --> 00:50:56,973
Because you're a nobody to me.

763
00:51:00,444 --> 00:51:02,243
I knew you were a weirdo,

764
00:51:02,714 --> 00:51:04,114
but I didn't know
you were this crazy.

765
00:51:13,723 --> 00:51:14,794
Wait.

766
00:51:17,824 --> 00:51:19,263
I forgot to give you something.

767
00:51:21,294 --> 00:51:22,364
Here, it's a gift.

768
00:51:39,353 --> 00:51:40,654
I'm three months pregnant.

769
00:51:40,813 --> 00:51:42,623
I thought you should know.

770
00:51:48,794 --> 00:51:49,893
Why should I know about this?

771
00:51:51,324 --> 00:51:54,464
First, how am I supposed to believe
you're pregnant, just based on this?

772
00:51:55,004 --> 00:51:56,703
You're an actress, after all.

773
00:51:56,804 --> 00:51:57,904
In my eyes,

774
00:51:59,574 --> 00:52:01,074
this just looks like bad acting.

775
00:52:02,304 --> 00:52:04,574
Second, let's say
you're actually pregnant.

776
00:52:05,813 --> 00:52:08,074
But how am I supposed to believe
that my husband is the father?

777
00:52:09,013 --> 00:52:12,384
Just a month ago, rumors were
rampant that you had a sponsor.

778
00:52:24,794 --> 00:52:26,694
Earlier, you provoked me
to go ahead and slap you,

779
00:52:28,333 --> 00:52:29,833
but you ended up
slapping me instead.

780
00:53:18,076 --> 00:53:20,607
We know nothing other than
the time and cause of Jin's death...

781
00:53:20,607 --> 00:53:22,676
and the person who found her.
We need something else to get a lead.

782
00:53:23,076 --> 00:53:24,377
She had no family or friends.

783
00:53:24,417 --> 00:53:26,346
No hostile relationships.
All we know is she worked for Mo.

784
00:53:26,346 --> 00:53:28,447
Shall we call him here again
and interrogate him?

785
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:30,047
You punk. Have you lost your mind?

786
00:53:31,456 --> 00:53:33,656
My gosh. You can't yell
as loudly as you used to.

787
00:53:33,926 --> 00:53:34,956
It makes me sad.

788
00:53:44,136 --> 00:53:45,266
Why are you here at this hour?

789
00:53:48,366 --> 00:53:49,437
What brings you here?

790
00:53:52,906 --> 00:53:55,176
I'm here to get some information
on Lee Yi Jin's case.

791
00:53:55,176 --> 00:53:56,206
Lee Yi Jin's case?

792
00:53:57,447 --> 00:53:59,277
- What about it?
- I'm covering the case.

793
00:53:59,476 --> 00:54:00,746
Detective Oh is gone for the day.

794
00:54:01,447 --> 00:54:02,487
And I'm busy too.

795
00:54:16,766 --> 00:54:18,397
Why are you so out of it?

796
00:54:18,397 --> 00:54:19,636
I was thinking about something else.

797
00:54:19,636 --> 00:54:21,337
Get in my car. I'll take you home.

798
00:54:22,036 --> 00:54:23,067
It's fine.

799
00:54:24,107 --> 00:54:26,136
I'm going that way too.
Just get in the car.

800
00:54:40,056 --> 00:54:41,587
You don't look like
you're feeling well.

801
00:54:42,087 --> 00:54:43,226
I have a headache.

802
00:54:50,667 --> 00:54:52,067
(My Husband)

803
00:54:53,096 --> 00:54:54,467
Wait here.
I'll pick up some medicine.

804
00:55:05,016 --> 00:55:06,176
(My Husband)

805
00:55:07,587 --> 00:55:08,587
Yes.

806
00:55:08,587 --> 00:55:10,286
I called you earlier. Where are you?

807
00:55:11,886 --> 00:55:13,726
I'm in front of the house.
What about you?

808
00:55:14,226 --> 00:55:15,226
I'm at the studio.

809
00:55:15,527 --> 00:55:17,757
It looks like I have to work
all night because of the deadline.

810
00:55:17,897 --> 00:55:19,326
Don't stay up to wait for me.
Just go to bed.

811
00:55:20,127 --> 00:55:22,926
Oh, right. You asked me
to make pasta for dinner.

812
00:55:23,596 --> 00:55:25,937
Sorry. You haven't eaten yet, right?
I'll leave now.

813
00:55:25,937 --> 00:55:26,937
Don't.

814
00:55:27,937 --> 00:55:29,036
I've eaten.

815
00:55:30,067 --> 00:55:31,636
I have to work all night too.

816
00:55:31,906 --> 00:55:33,437
- Really?
- Yes.

817
00:55:34,206 --> 00:55:36,476
All right. Don't work too hard.

818
00:55:37,246 --> 00:55:38,246
I love you.

819
00:55:39,846 --> 00:55:41,116
Do you really love me?

820
00:55:41,116 --> 00:55:42,286
Of course, I do.

821
00:55:45,656 --> 00:55:46,656
I'll see you tomorrow.

822
00:56:21,726 --> 00:56:23,757
Thank you. Thanks for the ride too.

- Everything's fine.

Yes, from "Nothing Uncovered."

What's she doing
at an ob-gyn clinic?

832
00:59:31,417 --> 00:59:33,547
Honey, she's prettier in real life.

833
00:59:35,047 --> 00:59:36,947
Isn't she that TV reporter,
Seo Jung Won?

834
00:59:36,947 --> 00:59:38,417
From "Nothing Uncovered," right?

835
00:59:38,857 --> 00:59:41,757
- Why is she here?
- Is she pregnant?

(With Me With You

01:00:13,016 --> 01:00:15,487
- Hey.
- Jung Won, are you on your way now?

838
01:00:15,956 --> 01:00:16,987

Hello.

841
01:00:24,437 --> 01:00:25,536
Over here.

842
01:00:31,237 --> 01:00:32,237
What?

843
01:00:32,437 --> 01:00:34,676
My goodness.
Someone didn't go home last night.

844
01:00:34,676 --> 01:00:36,746
You're wearing
the exact same clothes as yesterday.

845
01:00:36,746 --> 01:00:37,777
Did you and your husband
have a fight?

846
01:00:40,076 --> 01:00:41,147
No, neither.

847
01:00:41,547 --> 01:00:42,987
Is the informant on their way now?

848
01:00:43,217 --> 01:00:44,286
Well, the thing is...

849
01:00:44,717 --> 01:00:47,627
They can't leave home due to their
panic attacks and anxiety disorder.

850
01:00:50,127 --> 01:00:52,297
By the way, what did Cha Eun Sae...

851
01:00:53,527 --> 01:00:55,096
tip you off about yesterday?

852
01:00:55,667 --> 01:00:58,467
About her sponsor? Drugs?
Or about entertaining people in power?

853
01:01:03,007 --> 01:01:04,737
No, it was nothing important.

854
01:01:05,136 --> 01:01:06,306
I wouldn't even call it a tip-off.

855
01:01:06,706 --> 01:01:08,277
Are you kidding me?
That's disappointing.

856
01:01:08,746 --> 01:01:10,976
You don't look too well today.

857
01:01:12,976 --> 01:01:14,087
I should go home.

858
01:01:27,297 --> 01:01:29,596
I'll be about ten minutes late.

859
01:01:30,167 --> 01:01:31,297
Yes, I'll see you in a bit.

- What is this?
- Could it belong to the killer?

869
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:28,950
Cha Eun Sae is dead!

870
01:04:28,950 --> 01:04:31,720
It means she died
the day after you met her.

871
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:32,751
What's with that face?

872
01:04:32,751 --> 01:04:33,820
Jung Won.

873
01:04:33,851 --> 01:04:35,561
Shall I tell you something shocking?

874
01:04:35,561 --> 01:04:37,831
Cha Eun Sae was
three months pregnant.

875
01:04:39,090 --> 01:04:41,630
Why did you go to
the marriage counseling clinic yesterday?

876
01:04:42,260 --> 01:04:43,561
Did you follow me?

877
01:04:44,030 --> 01:04:46,700
So she was murdered, right?
Do you have a suspect?

878
01:04:46,700 --> 01:04:47,771
Have you identified
the main suspect?

879
01:04:47,771 --> 01:04:50,101
Was something going on between
Ms. Seo's husband and Cha Eun Sae?

880
