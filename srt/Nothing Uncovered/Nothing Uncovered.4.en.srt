00:00:27,871 --> 00:00:29,031
Dad!

7
00:00:29,301 --> 00:00:30,742
Hey, sweetie.

8
00:00:31,301 --> 00:00:32,371
You're here.

9
00:00:33,042 --> 00:00:34,972
- Gosh. You're here.
- Dad.

10
00:00:35,371 --> 00:00:37,981
It's okay. Let's go home.

11
00:00:51,621 --> 00:00:52,621
You don't need these.

12
00:00:52,621 --> 00:00:54,161
You already look like
an unemployed slacker.

13
00:00:54,161 --> 00:00:55,292
Come on.

14
00:00:58,032 --> 00:01:00,602
Are you using the stakeout
as an excuse and playing hooky?

15
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:03,542
I'm a hardworking police officer.
Why are you picking a fight with me?

16
00:01:03,741 --> 00:01:05,671
If police officers are hardworking,

17
00:01:05,841 --> 00:01:08,341
how come cold cases
aren't being solved?

18
00:01:09,311 --> 00:01:10,381
Which cold case?

19
00:01:11,782 --> 00:01:13,881
A reporter was murdered
in his own house.

20
00:01:14,852 --> 00:01:18,052
Then his daughter happened
to run into the culprit.

21
00:01:22,992 --> 00:01:24,492
Her dad was covered in blood.

22
00:01:25,762 --> 00:01:26,762
The moment she realized...

23
00:01:26,762 --> 00:01:28,292
she was in the same space
as the culprit,

24
00:01:29,231 --> 00:01:30,701
she passed out.

25
00:01:31,662 --> 00:01:33,231
She didn't even see
the culprit's face.

26
00:01:34,932 --> 00:01:37,471
If his daughter had seen
the culprit's face,

27
00:01:38,402 --> 00:01:39,742
it wouldn't have been a cold case.

28
00:01:41,012 --> 00:01:42,042
Right?

29
00:01:53,382 --> 00:01:54,792
It's not the victim's fault.

30
00:01:55,492 --> 00:01:56,861
The police's incompetence
is to blame.

31
00:02:06,871 --> 00:02:07,871
You're right.

32
00:02:08,371 --> 00:02:10,242
So I'll catch those culprits...

33
00:02:10,341 --> 00:02:11,701
the police can't catch...

34
00:02:11,701 --> 00:02:13,471
and expose them to the world
through my show.

35
00:02:14,841 --> 00:02:16,072
I should be on my toes then.

36
00:02:16,371 --> 00:02:18,081
I'll find people
who committed crimes,

37
00:02:19,012 --> 00:02:21,181
grab them by the hair,
and teach them a lesson.

38
00:02:22,211 --> 00:02:23,282
What do you think?

39
00:02:24,322 --> 00:02:26,122
Instead of grabbing them
by the hair, wouldn't...

40
00:02:28,692 --> 00:02:29,921
grabbing them by the collar
be cooler?

41
00:02:30,722 --> 00:02:33,762
I knew it. I'm indeed
a good judge of character.

42
00:02:37,231 --> 00:02:39,262
This stakeout
couldn't end fast enough.

43
00:02:40,502 --> 00:02:42,771
That way, I'll get to go on a date
with Detective Kim.

44
00:02:43,842 --> 00:02:45,901
We can count today
as our first date.

45
00:02:47,641 --> 00:02:48,741
What do you want to do first?

46
00:03:07,632 --> 00:03:10,092
The first thing I wanted to do
to you was to kiss you.

47
00:03:22,062 --> 00:03:24,102
(Episode 4)

48
00:03:25,602 --> 00:03:28,863
Your necklace was found
at the scene where Cha Eun Sae...

49
00:03:30,942 --> 00:03:32,103
was murdered.

50
00:03:33,882 --> 00:03:35,013
Seo Jung Won.

51
00:03:35,013 --> 00:03:36,632
On the day of Cha Eun Sae's murder,

52
00:03:37,352 --> 00:03:39,143
were you at...

53
00:03:40,322 --> 00:03:41,543
the scene?

54
00:03:50,493 --> 00:03:51,923
The day you met with Cha,

55
00:03:52,132 --> 00:03:53,523
did you wear this necklace?

56
00:03:55,162 --> 00:03:59,092
This is the same necklace as the one
you were wearing before, right?

57
00:04:00,703 --> 00:04:02,793
No. I didn't wear it.

58
00:04:03,442 --> 00:04:06,113
Cha was wearing
the same one that day.

59
00:04:06,113 --> 00:04:07,303
I remember it.

60
00:04:08,983 --> 00:04:10,273
This is Cha Eun Sae's.

61
00:04:10,553 --> 00:04:12,673
We had the store
run the serial number.

62
00:04:14,983 --> 00:04:16,983
The registered customer...

63
00:04:17,493 --> 00:04:18,923
came back as you.

64
00:04:18,923 --> 00:04:20,393
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

65
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:21,993
When did you realize you'd lost it?

66
00:04:21,993 --> 00:04:24,222
Was it before or after Cha's death?

67
00:04:25,763 --> 00:04:26,923
It was after.

68
00:04:29,463 --> 00:04:31,873
Let's go back
to the day before Cha died.

69
00:04:31,873 --> 00:04:33,762
Why were you at her place?

70
00:04:35,102 --> 00:04:37,233
- I told you before...
- That you didn't say much.

71
00:04:40,643 --> 00:04:42,403
But in reality,
you heard of the affair.

72
00:04:45,682 --> 00:04:46,852
As proof of the affair,

73
00:04:46,852 --> 00:04:49,812
you'd have seen a pregnancy test
or ultrasound picture.

74
00:04:52,193 --> 00:04:55,682
You heard something
that could be a motive for murder.

75
00:04:56,623 --> 00:04:58,893
- Listen.
- Your new therapist's nurse...

76
00:04:58,893 --> 00:05:00,622
mistakenly texted you
to come to Unit 1401.

77
00:05:03,263 --> 00:05:04,822
I'll ask you again, Ms. Seo.

78
00:05:05,373 --> 00:05:07,062
On the day of Cha Eun Sae's murder,

79
00:05:07,472 --> 00:05:09,163
you were at the scene, weren't you?

80
00:05:20,323 --> 00:05:21,673
(Director's Office)

81
00:05:30,662 --> 00:05:32,223
Did Ms. Choi say...

82
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:33,582
I was at the scene?

83
00:05:34,532 --> 00:05:35,793
I wasn't there.

84
00:05:41,302 --> 00:05:42,733
Did you question her?

85
00:05:42,943 --> 00:05:44,443
Why did she make a typo...

86
00:05:44,443 --> 00:05:46,982
that could've sent me
to the crime scene?

87
00:05:46,982 --> 00:05:49,013
What was her intention?

88
00:05:49,013 --> 00:05:50,673
Shouldn't you look into that first?

89
00:05:51,282 --> 00:05:54,083
She insisted
it was an innocent mistake.

90
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:55,872
I confirmed her alibi too.

91
00:05:58,253 --> 00:06:00,292
There's a 14-minute gap
between the time you entered...

92
00:06:00,292 --> 00:06:03,353
the building and the time
you registered at the clinic.

93
00:06:06,162 --> 00:06:07,793
During those 14 minutes,

94
00:06:08,463 --> 00:06:10,562
I murdered Cha Eun Sae?

95
00:06:12,703 --> 00:06:15,672
Someone with a motive
went up to the 14th floor,

96
00:06:15,672 --> 00:06:17,803
and we found
something of yours at the scene.

97
00:06:18,412 --> 00:06:19,713
As a journalist,

98
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:21,572
do you say
my suspicion is unfounded?

99
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:23,843
Am I...

100
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:26,942
a suspect?

101
00:06:31,023 --> 00:06:32,983
You're a person of interest so far.

102
00:06:43,802 --> 00:06:46,062
If I were going to kill Cha,

103
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:48,262
I'd have gone with another method.

104
00:06:55,013 --> 00:06:57,403
The exact same way
my father was killed?

105
00:06:59,182 --> 00:07:00,572
I don't have the courage...

106
00:07:01,682 --> 00:07:03,243
to kill someone that way.

107
00:07:17,032 --> 00:07:19,073
During the 24 hours of October 6,

108
00:07:19,073 --> 00:07:20,892
write down
everything you did and where.

109
00:07:21,273 --> 00:07:23,033
Don't leave anything out.

110
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:51,602
I'm still just a person of interest,

111
00:07:51,602 --> 00:07:53,723
so I'll end this interview here.

112
00:07:54,102 --> 00:07:56,832
If you're sure you have
the right person, handcuff me now.

113
00:07:58,273 --> 00:08:00,163
Your husband insists
he's a person of interest too.

114
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:03,403
Do you think
he was involved in Cha's death?

115
00:08:04,852 --> 00:08:08,113
It's very likely a married couple
would cover for each other.

116
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:11,352
If you were
to be handcuffed together,

117
00:08:11,352 --> 00:08:12,483
that would be...

118
00:08:12,823 --> 00:08:14,582
truly unfortunate.

119
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:35,782
It's only natural you're in pain.

120
00:08:35,782 --> 00:08:37,173
You were outed as a cheater...

121
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:39,473
and your wife left home.

122
00:08:54,832 --> 00:08:58,202
They say whatever physical sense
overpowers you...

123
00:08:58,202 --> 00:09:01,662
in a given moment dictates
if you're happy or in suffering.

124
00:09:01,773 --> 00:09:04,572
In other words, we merely react...

125
00:09:04,572 --> 00:09:06,662
to our body's senses.

126
00:09:09,843 --> 00:09:12,153
What pains you isn't the fact...

127
00:09:12,153 --> 00:09:13,672
that your wife left.

128
00:09:17,082 --> 00:09:18,583
It's down to...

129
00:09:18,792 --> 00:09:20,953
the displeasing sensations you feel.

130
00:09:21,922 --> 00:09:23,113
Like this.

131
00:09:27,562 --> 00:09:28,752
I'm not here...

132
00:09:29,962 --> 00:09:31,593
for theories or principles.

133
00:09:33,332 --> 00:09:34,833
Help me.

134
00:09:40,373 --> 00:09:41,573
The dirtbag.

135
00:09:45,153 --> 00:09:47,642
Ms. Cha Eun Sae.

136
00:10:06,702 --> 00:10:07,792
Ms. Seo.

137
00:10:11,113 --> 00:10:12,863
Are you okay? Were you hurt?

138
00:10:13,942 --> 00:10:14,959
No.

139
00:10:14,983 --> 00:10:17,473
I had a bad feeling
when you drove over the line.

140
00:10:17,912 --> 00:10:20,153
Call your insurance company
and get in my car.

141
00:10:20,153 --> 00:10:22,753
Don't bother.
It's just a few scrapes.

142
00:10:22,753 --> 00:10:24,792
- I'm fine.
- Let me drive, then.

143
00:10:24,792 --> 00:10:26,093
I'm worried.

144
00:10:26,093 --> 00:10:28,113
I'll text when I'm home. Thanks.

145
00:10:38,702 --> 00:10:41,863
I'm glad I did as you said
and followed Ms. Seo.

146
00:10:42,172 --> 00:10:44,863
She almost crashed,
but drove off saying she was fine.

147
00:10:45,473 --> 00:10:47,782
She's too darn stubborn.

148
00:10:47,782 --> 00:10:49,973
- Okay.
- Wait.

149
00:10:50,082 --> 00:10:52,672
Tae Heon.
You're not drinking, are you?

150
00:10:53,753 --> 00:10:56,353
That's like poison to you.
You can't drink.

151
00:10:56,353 --> 00:10:57,723
I'm not drinking.

152
00:10:57,723 --> 00:10:59,642
It sounds like you are.

153
00:11:00,023 --> 00:11:02,263
I'm more worried about you
than Ms. Seo...

154
00:11:02,263 --> 00:11:03,353
Whatever.

155
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:54,733
There's no necklace.

156
00:11:56,013 --> 00:11:57,902
(Zeus)

157
00:11:59,253 --> 00:12:01,952
The photos the police took
of Cha Eun Sae's crime scene.

158
00:12:01,952 --> 00:12:03,142
I want them all.

159
00:12:13,962 --> 00:12:16,003
He protested the results
of the first trial...

160
00:12:16,003 --> 00:12:17,723
and appealed.

161
00:12:19,273 --> 00:12:20,493
Here's the next report.

162
00:12:20,903 --> 00:12:23,473
Celebrity Cha Eun Sae
who died on the sixth...

163
00:12:23,473 --> 00:12:26,412
was supposedly having an affair
with novelist Seol Woo Jae,

164
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,302
who was questioned by police.

165
00:12:28,682 --> 00:12:32,552
His wife Seo Jung Won was questioned
as a person of interest as well,

166
00:12:32,552 --> 00:12:34,042
according to police sources.

167
00:12:35,523 --> 00:12:38,499
The next report
is on Ancheon's Prosecution Office,

168
00:12:38,523 --> 00:12:41,462
which states obstruction of justice
due to blackmail and...

169
00:12:41,462 --> 00:12:43,282
(Zeus)

170
00:12:46,893 --> 00:12:48,392
Why were you questioned?

171
00:12:48,532 --> 00:12:50,022
Are you on their radar?

172
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:53,693
I guess even you think I'm suspicious.

173
00:12:56,243 --> 00:12:58,162
Is it because your phone GPS
was on the visitor list?

174
00:12:58,473 --> 00:13:00,302
Or is there another reason?

175
00:13:00,672 --> 00:13:03,843
You won't resign from
the "Nothing Uncovered" show,

176
00:13:03,843 --> 00:13:06,603
or let it get scrapped, will you?

177
00:13:06,853 --> 00:13:08,473
Would I let that happen?

178
00:13:08,853 --> 00:13:10,042
Why are you overreacting?

179
00:13:11,093 --> 00:13:13,813
I don't want to lose my income.
I'll send the photos.

180
00:13:51,633 --> 00:13:54,353
The culprit came back to the scene
after I had left.

181
00:13:54,903 --> 00:13:56,522
The culprit left my necklace there
on purpose.

182
00:14:35,373 --> 00:14:38,532
(Zeus)

183
00:14:40,143 --> 00:14:43,172
It took the police some time
to find the pendant at the scene.

184
00:14:46,782 --> 00:14:49,322
Celebrity Cha Eun Sae
who died on the sixth...

185
00:14:49,322 --> 00:14:51,723
was supposedly having an affair
with novelist Seol Woo Jae,

186
00:14:51,723 --> 00:14:54,113
- Hello.
- who was questioned by police.

187
00:14:54,493 --> 00:14:56,083
His wife Seo Jung Won
was questioned...

188
00:14:56,263 --> 00:14:58,462
as a person of interest as well,

189
00:14:58,462 --> 00:14:59,882
- according to police sources.
- Turn that off.

190
00:15:00,133 --> 00:15:01,133
Yes, sir.

191
00:15:01,133 --> 00:15:02,353
(They met the day
before she was murdered.)

192
00:15:07,103 --> 00:15:10,063
(They met the day
before she was murdered.)

193
00:15:10,603 --> 00:15:11,703
Tae Heon.

194
00:15:12,743 --> 00:15:14,833
What if this was Ms. Seo's necklace?

195
00:15:15,643 --> 00:15:19,042
Cha Eun Sae could have stolen
Ms. Seo's necklace before she died.

196
00:15:20,013 --> 00:15:22,428
I'm feeling it.
The ace detective missed it.

197
00:15:22,452 --> 00:15:23,758
But I caught it.

198
00:15:23,782 --> 00:15:25,452
Do you think
I didn't check the record...

199
00:15:25,452 --> 00:15:27,012
of Cha buying the same necklace?

200
00:15:28,263 --> 00:15:29,412
It was hers.

201
00:15:29,922 --> 00:15:33,282
Gosh. Despite everything,
I doubt that Ms. Seo killed Cha.

202
00:15:33,363 --> 00:15:35,493
She said she had lost her necklace
we found at the crime scene.

203
00:15:36,633 --> 00:15:38,133
Someone could've tampered with it.

204
00:15:38,133 --> 00:15:39,733
Right? Seol Woo Jae was the one...

205
00:15:39,733 --> 00:15:41,693
who had the easiest access
to the necklace.

206
00:15:41,973 --> 00:15:44,032
What if he framed her
to save his own skin?

207
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:46,203
He could have devised a plan
for his alibi too.

208
00:15:46,743 --> 00:15:48,459
And she committed the murder?

209
00:15:48,483 --> 00:15:50,672
That's why
you want to identify her too, right?

210
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:55,243
Ta-da.

211
00:15:55,653 --> 00:15:58,113
She happened to go into the building
around the estimated time of death.

212
00:15:58,223 --> 00:16:00,943
The colors of her coat and handbag
are a complete match.

213
00:16:00,993 --> 00:16:02,662
- I'm sure she's the culprit.
- How did she exit the building?

214
00:16:02,662 --> 00:16:03,953
She must've exited
through the rear entrance.

215
00:16:04,532 --> 00:16:06,422
Should I go
and interrogate Seol Woo Jae?

216
00:16:08,162 --> 00:16:09,353
He'll come to us.

217
00:16:17,302 --> 00:16:18,532
(Seol Woo Jae)

218
00:16:18,712 --> 00:16:19,802
Nice.

219
00:16:35,263 --> 00:16:36,552
Did your wife slap you?

220
00:16:40,763 --> 00:16:43,493
I can put up with you bullying me.
But what I cannot put up with is...

221
00:16:44,932 --> 00:16:47,093
you bullying my wife to get to me.

222
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:49,103
Why do you think
we were trying to get to you?

223
00:16:49,103 --> 00:16:50,243
You have an alibi.

224
00:16:50,243 --> 00:16:52,563
Then why was Jung Won
questioned by the police?

225
00:16:52,712 --> 00:16:54,433
You don't know
why she was questioned?

226
00:16:55,212 --> 00:16:57,032
I get the feeling
you might know why.

227
00:17:05,253 --> 00:17:07,253
Today, I'm going to uncover...

228
00:17:07,253 --> 00:17:09,412
the sexy novelist, Seol Woo Jae.

229
00:17:10,893 --> 00:17:11,893
What are you doing?

230
00:17:11,893 --> 00:17:12,993
- Why...
- Just listen.

231
00:17:12,993 --> 00:17:15,092
does he make women grow impatient?

232
00:17:15,262 --> 00:17:19,092
Why can't that woman and I come
to our senses?

233
00:17:20,172 --> 00:17:21,762
No matter how happy
you were as a married couple,

234
00:17:21,903 --> 00:17:24,262
she wouldn't have lost her senses
because of you.

235
00:17:25,512 --> 00:17:28,973
So she was referring to this woman.
The one you brought to your office.

236
00:17:31,613 --> 00:17:35,173
Therefore, Cha Eun Sae knew that
there was another woman.

237
00:17:35,482 --> 00:17:37,728
Is this how you usually investigate?
Following irrelevant leads?

238
00:17:37,752 --> 00:17:39,222
If you feel wronged,
identify this woman...

239
00:17:39,222 --> 00:17:40,922
whose identity
you wanted to conceal.

240
00:17:40,922 --> 00:17:42,052
No.

241
00:17:44,093 --> 00:17:46,483
I don't feel wronged.
I just find it hilarious...

242
00:17:47,162 --> 00:17:48,162
that you're investigating...

243
00:17:48,162 --> 00:17:49,893
someone irrelevant to the case
instead of chasing a murderer.

244
00:17:52,002 --> 00:17:53,092
Your mistress...

245
00:17:55,103 --> 00:17:57,163
must have wanted Cha Eun Sae dead...

246
00:17:58,143 --> 00:17:59,463
because of you.

247
00:18:02,343 --> 00:18:04,712
We have your mistress
leaving your office...

248
00:18:04,712 --> 00:18:06,943
and entering Leaders Palace
on camera.

249
00:18:08,252 --> 00:18:09,373
I have no choice, you know.

250
00:18:09,482 --> 00:18:11,222
Putting aside the repulsive nature
of your relationship,

251
00:18:11,222 --> 00:18:13,883
I must also check if you two are
accomplices in this crime.

252
00:18:19,262 --> 00:18:20,352
Oh, right.

253
00:18:23,063 --> 00:18:24,493
Once I identify this woman,

254
00:18:25,272 --> 00:18:26,822
I can inform Ms. Seo. Right?

255
00:18:38,012 --> 00:18:39,102
Sir.

256
00:18:39,353 --> 00:18:41,012
I get that she's wrapped up
in this scandal.

257
00:18:41,012 --> 00:18:42,812
She's the most famous reporter
from our TV station.

258
00:18:42,853 --> 00:18:44,342
Will our show get canceled?

259
00:18:44,422 --> 00:18:45,542
Sir!

260
00:18:45,752 --> 00:18:47,483
Sir. Hear me out.

261
00:18:47,722 --> 00:18:50,483
We understand that
we're in a state of emergency.

262
00:18:50,692 --> 00:18:52,762
While we buy some time
by taking a break for a few weeks,

263
00:18:52,762 --> 00:18:54,552
let's look for a plan.

264
00:18:54,662 --> 00:18:57,653
Here's the first option.
Replace Seo Jung Won.

265
00:18:58,502 --> 00:19:01,292
We should just change the concept.
That will be better.

266
00:19:02,803 --> 00:19:04,972
Team Two submitted a proposal
to replace your show.

267
00:19:04,972 --> 00:19:06,403
And the CEO is reviewing it.

268
00:19:06,543 --> 00:19:07,703
It's out of my hands now!

269
00:19:08,643 --> 00:19:10,772
Was canceling our show
the CEO's idea?

270
00:19:13,682 --> 00:19:15,812
I'll arrive at the TV station
in five minutes.

271
00:19:18,692 --> 00:19:19,769
Bring her back!

272
00:19:19,793 --> 00:19:21,623
- Bring her back!
- Bring her back!

273
00:19:21,623 --> 00:19:24,112
Cancel "Nothing Uncovered!"

274
00:19:24,162 --> 00:19:26,082
- Cancel it!
- Cancel it!

275
00:19:26,232 --> 00:19:28,453
Seo Jung Won must resign!

276
00:19:28,603 --> 00:19:30,322
- She must resign!
- She must resign!

277
00:19:30,462 --> 00:19:32,292
Bring Cha Eun Sae back!

278
00:19:32,972 --> 00:19:34,062
Back out.

279
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:36,819
Cancel "Nothing Uncovered!"

280
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:38,073
- Cancel it!
- Cancel it!

281
00:19:38,073 --> 00:19:39,203
Drive now.

282
00:19:43,843 --> 00:19:44,912
Bring Cha Eun Sae back!

283
00:19:44,912 --> 00:19:46,703
- Bring her back!
- Bring her back!

284
00:19:53,722 --> 00:19:55,093
Why did your necklace turn up...

285
00:19:55,093 --> 00:19:56,953
at the scene
where Cha Eun Sae was murdered?

286
00:19:57,123 --> 00:19:59,563
This isn't what I had in mind
when I kept pushing for you!

287
00:19:59,563 --> 00:20:01,852
Do you think I wanted to be
in the middle of this case?

288
00:20:02,103 --> 00:20:03,232
I'm a victim too.

289
00:20:03,232 --> 00:20:05,178
This isn't just a cheating scandal.
It's a murder case!

290
00:20:05,202 --> 00:20:07,092
You have a motive,
and your necklace was at the scene.

291
00:20:07,232 --> 00:20:09,103
You were once in the spotlight
regarding the housekeeper's death.

292
00:20:09,103 --> 00:20:10,403
But this case is nothing
compared to that.

293
00:20:10,403 --> 00:20:13,032
So you're just curious
if I killed Cha Eun Sae or not.

294
00:20:13,813 --> 00:20:16,032
I haven't killed anyone yet.

295
00:20:17,012 --> 00:20:19,072
Once I find the culprit
who framed me for murder,

296
00:20:19,313 --> 00:20:21,913
I'll kill that jerk then.

297
00:20:24,452 --> 00:20:27,183
We can take a month off
because of the Asian Games.

298
00:20:27,353 --> 00:20:28,852
Give me some time
to get to the bottom of this.

299
00:20:29,462 --> 00:20:32,653
Once the Asian Games end,
I'll air Cha Eun Sae's episode.

300
00:20:33,093 --> 00:20:35,852
Ji Ho will be replacing you
with a new program.

301
00:20:37,202 --> 00:20:38,779
- A new program?
- That's all I can say.

302
00:20:38,803 --> 00:20:39,893
Sir!

303
00:20:44,143 --> 00:20:45,233
Sir.

304
00:20:45,442 --> 00:20:47,242
You lost your spot
as the presenter at the 9 p.m. news...

305
00:20:47,242 --> 00:20:48,933
and your program,
"Nothing Uncovered" too.

306
00:20:49,212 --> 00:20:51,643
The order came straight
from the CEO. My hands are tied.

307
00:20:51,982 --> 00:20:53,688
I can't accept this. Never.

308
00:20:53,712 --> 00:20:55,873
What can you do about it?
It was the CEO's decision.

309
00:20:56,083 --> 00:20:57,682
Think about who created this mess.

310
00:20:57,682 --> 00:20:59,692
I was questioned as a person
of interest, not a suspect.

311
00:20:59,692 --> 00:21:01,582
People don't care about that.

312
00:21:01,692 --> 00:21:03,863
You're already labeled
as a murderer.

313
00:21:03,863 --> 00:21:05,333
Exactly. So let me do it.

314
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:06,692
Someone out there is after me.

315
00:21:06,692 --> 00:21:08,432
And no reporter could be
more determined than me...

316
00:21:08,432 --> 00:21:09,623
to get to the bottom of everything.

317
00:21:10,462 --> 00:21:11,862
Just worry about...

318
00:21:12,033 --> 00:21:13,633
how you can end your show
on a good note.

319
00:21:13,633 --> 00:21:15,032
I won't let my show end.

320
00:21:15,143 --> 00:21:16,332
Not after everything I did for it.

321
00:21:16,472 --> 00:21:17,603

322
00:21:17,603 --> 00:21:19,203
You had three years.
Isn't that enough?

323
00:21:26,252 --> 00:21:27,653
I went through
Cha Eun Sae's call history...

324
00:21:27,653 --> 00:21:30,222
and pulled a list
of unidentified numbers...

325
00:21:30,222 --> 00:21:31,422

and people she met through work.

Gosh, this is such tedious work.

329

Then do you have another way...

330
00:21:39,692 --> 00:21:40,782
to identify the woman
in the red coat?

331
00:21:41,962 --> 00:21:43,923
I was going to take half.
Or should I make you do it alone?

332
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:46,373
Gosh. I must work hard.

333
00:21:46,373 --> 00:21:47,702
Don't just focus on women.

I'm here
regarding Cha Eun Sae's case.

353
00:23:02,613 --> 00:23:04,473
I have questions
for Mr. Song Hyo Sung.

354
00:23:05,482 --> 00:23:08,772
Not regarding Ms. Jin's case?
This is about Cha Eun Sae's case?

355
00:23:08,922 --> 00:23:12,643
Yes. I have a few questions for you.
Do you have some time?

356
00:23:12,692 --> 00:23:14,012
Please wait.

357
00:23:14,222 --> 00:23:15,623
I'll come back
after I escort Assemblyman Mo.

358
00:23:15,623 --> 00:23:16,983
It's fine.

359
00:23:17,623 --> 00:23:19,052
I'll go with Ms. Baek.

360
00:23:20,162 --> 00:23:21,623
I don't know what this is about.

361
00:23:22,662 --> 00:23:25,562
- Have a nice interview.
- Thanks.

362
00:23:28,343 --> 00:23:31,032
I checked
Cha Eun Sae's call history.

363
00:23:31,202 --> 00:23:32,762
Three weeks before she died,

364
00:23:33,113 --> 00:23:34,643
you called her.

365
00:23:34,643 --> 00:23:37,703
Then she called you
three days before she died.

366
00:23:37,942 --> 00:23:39,342
What was your relationship with her?

367
00:23:43,682 --> 00:23:46,282
(3 weeks before Cha Eun Sae died)

368
00:23:52,593 --> 00:23:54,183
If I cut my finger off,

369
00:23:56,303 --> 00:23:58,893
will it show you
that my love for you is real?

370
00:23:58,932 --> 00:24:00,062
Look.

371
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:02,663
What's going on here?

372
00:24:08,283 --> 00:24:09,473
Are you all right?

373
00:24:23,492 --> 00:24:24,683
You don't need to call the police.

374
00:24:25,833 --> 00:24:27,483
But just in case,

375
00:24:27,992 --> 00:24:30,022
I'll keep your number
as you witnessed what happened.

376
00:24:35,272 --> 00:24:37,103
Do you remember his face
or what he was wearing?

377
00:24:37,103 --> 00:24:38,963
It happened at night,
and he was wearing a cap.

378
00:24:39,373 --> 00:24:40,672
He was taller than me,

379
00:24:40,672 --> 00:24:42,313
and he was wearing
a gray zip-up jacket.

380
00:24:42,313 --> 00:24:43,703
Then on October 3,

381
00:24:44,113 --> 00:24:47,102
why did she call you?

382
00:24:47,283 --> 00:24:49,722
She offered to take me out for a meal
to thank me for helping her,

383
00:24:49,722 --> 00:24:51,012
and I told her
not to worry about it.

384
00:24:51,153 --> 00:24:52,468
Three weeks later?

385
00:24:52,492 --> 00:24:54,282
To be honest,
I was quite flustered too.

386
00:24:58,533 --> 00:25:02,223
Could you tell me where you were...

387
00:25:02,403 --> 00:25:04,862
between 5 p.m. and 8 p.m. on October 6?

388
00:25:08,672 --> 00:25:09,702
(Volunteer at Free Meal Service,
10 a.m. to 4 p.m.)

389
00:25:09,702 --> 00:25:12,233
Assemblyman Mo's schedule
for the day ended at 4 p.m.,

390
00:25:12,672 --> 00:25:14,002
so I went home after that.

391
00:25:14,272 --> 00:25:15,473
Do you live alone?

392
00:25:15,912 --> 00:25:17,903
- Yes.
- You must be lonely.

393
00:25:20,553 --> 00:25:23,572
(Can't confirm his alibi)

394
00:25:37,762 --> 00:25:38,862
What's up?

395
00:25:39,633 --> 00:25:40,822
Are you here to meet with the CEO?

396
00:25:44,442 --> 00:25:47,102
Oh, no. He just went to bed,
saying he was tired.

397
00:25:49,212 --> 00:25:50,873
Why are you so stubborn?

398
00:25:51,313 --> 00:25:53,102
I'll give him a call.

399
00:26:00,793 --> 00:26:04,262
Hello, sir. I just ran...

400
00:26:04,262 --> 00:26:07,552
into Jung Won in front of your house.
Can she come in now?

401
00:26:10,603 --> 00:26:12,022
Okay, understood.

402
00:26:12,633 --> 00:26:13,762
Yes, sir.

403
00:26:15,903 --> 00:26:17,463
He said he'd meet with you at work.

404
00:26:18,472 --> 00:26:21,233
Right, you must've heard
the title of my new show.

405
00:26:21,412 --> 00:26:23,532
It's "Reporter's Dignity."
What do you think?

406
00:26:25,353 --> 00:26:27,583
Do you really think you have
the right to talk about "dignity?"

407
00:26:27,583 --> 00:26:28,713
Hey, come on.

408
00:26:29,353 --> 00:26:32,913
I've never been involved
in a murder case, you see.

409
00:26:34,053 --> 00:26:35,762
The first episode will cover
the Cha Eun Sae case.

410
00:26:35,762 --> 00:26:37,552
Let me give you a heads-up
that I'll interview you.

411
00:26:37,922 --> 00:26:39,223
With your husband, of course.

412
00:26:43,462 --> 00:26:46,362
Life is so unpredictable, right?

413
00:26:46,502 --> 00:26:47,963
That's what makes it interesting.

414
00:26:59,412 --> 00:27:01,102
(Lee Ba Reun, Newbie Reporter)

415
00:27:01,783 --> 00:27:03,329
- Hey.
- Jung Won.

416
00:27:03,353 --> 00:27:06,643
Like you said,
there's an inner circle at the church.

417
00:27:06,922 --> 00:27:08,962
Of course. It's a big church
that's been around for years.

418
00:27:08,962 --> 00:27:11,393
Also, Chairman Seol...

419
00:27:11,393 --> 00:27:12,923
recruited the CEO himself.

420
00:27:26,339 --> 00:27:28,129
I need to talk to you
about something, Father.

421
00:27:31,678 --> 00:27:32,998
You were about to leave, right?

422
00:27:35,079 --> 00:27:36,169
Yes.

423
00:27:38,549 --> 00:27:39,949
I'll do as you said.

424
00:27:48,329 --> 00:27:51,018
I apologize for putting the family
in such a pickle.

425
00:27:52,628 --> 00:27:53,828
But it really wasn't me.

426
00:27:53,999 --> 00:27:57,629
Someone manipulated the evidence
to frame me for the murder.

427
00:27:58,369 --> 00:28:00,339
I'll find out
who manipulated the case...

428
00:28:00,339 --> 00:28:01,828
and reveal it on my show.

429
00:28:06,779 --> 00:28:08,068
I heard...

430
00:28:08,779 --> 00:28:11,339
you and the CEO of KBM were close,
so I came to you for help.

431
00:28:12,549 --> 00:28:15,209
Please persuade him
not to cancel my show.

432
00:28:17,488 --> 00:28:19,228
Didn't you say on your show
that only those...

433
00:28:19,228 --> 00:28:20,759
who have connections and money...

434
00:28:20,759 --> 00:28:21,928
were shameless enough...

435
00:28:21,928 --> 00:28:23,718
to ask for such favors,
thinking it was their free pass?

436
00:28:26,999 --> 00:28:28,988
I know you never agree to deals
that won't benefit you.

437
00:28:29,638 --> 00:28:31,859
I'll do as you say,
whatever that may be.

438
00:28:32,468 --> 00:28:34,408
I'll quickly get started
on the divorce process...

439
00:28:34,408 --> 00:28:35,699
and won't ask for alimony.

440
00:28:37,509 --> 00:28:39,918
You never once approved of me.
In return for kicking me out,

441
00:28:39,918 --> 00:28:42,839
- please help me save my show...
- Must you irk me until the end?

442
00:28:44,319 --> 00:28:45,849
If you wanted to strike a deal
with me,

443
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:48,379
you should've pondered what
would be best for the family.

444
00:28:48,918 --> 00:28:51,059
You'll desert your husband
involved in such a scandal,

445
00:28:51,059 --> 00:28:53,698
and your father-in-law
will ditch you because of the case?

446
00:28:53,698 --> 00:28:55,349
What would people think, then?

447
00:28:58,228 --> 00:29:00,999
As Woo Jae's wife,
you should publicly defend him...

448
00:29:00,999 --> 00:29:02,159
and go home.

449
00:29:02,499 --> 00:29:05,258
Behave yourself and stay by his side
until the case is closed.

450
00:29:08,438 --> 00:29:10,599
Why? You can't do it?

451
00:29:12,448 --> 00:29:13,609
Then choose.

452
00:29:13,779 --> 00:29:15,169
Will you protect your show...

453
00:29:15,749 --> 00:29:17,409
or your pride?

454
00:29:36,509 --> 00:29:38,459
I'll move out, so come home.

455
00:29:38,769 --> 00:29:41,528
- I'm worried about you.
- Were you always this despicable?

456
00:29:42,208 --> 00:29:44,139
Who's the reason
I'm in this mess now?

457
00:29:45,779 --> 00:29:47,478
I want to die right now.

458
00:29:47,478 --> 00:29:48,669
Then die.

459
00:29:53,718 --> 00:29:56,449
Jung Won, why did the police...

460
00:29:57,958 --> 00:29:59,119
interview you?

461
00:30:03,898 --> 00:30:05,018
You really don't know the reason?

462
00:30:05,198 --> 00:30:06,659
I thought you'd know. No, I mean...

463
00:30:07,099 --> 00:30:08,228
You must know.

464
00:30:09,069 --> 00:30:11,058
Detective Kim Tae Heon
said the exact same thing.

465
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:13,159
What was the reason?
Can't you tell me?

466
00:30:15,738 --> 00:30:17,169
I can't figure you out.

467
00:30:17,408 --> 00:30:18,678
I feel like I don't know you.

468
00:30:18,678 --> 00:30:20,369
I don't even know if you're human.

469
00:30:21,549 --> 00:30:23,068
When the news about
Cha Eun Sae's murder was released,

470
00:30:23,718 --> 00:30:25,418
you seemed totally fine.
It gives me the chills.

471
00:30:25,418 --> 00:30:26,808
It didn't seem awkward at all.

472
00:30:28,458 --> 00:30:29,649
It must be one of these two.

473
00:30:30,089 --> 00:30:31,548
You either hid it perfectly,

474
00:30:32,589 --> 00:30:34,119
or it really doesn't bother you at all.

475
00:30:35,599 --> 00:30:38,419
When the truth comes out,
I'll find out what you are too.

476
00:30:39,099 --> 00:30:41,058
Whether you're a human or a monster.

477
00:31:19,208 --> 00:31:23,439
("Nothing Uncovered" premieres,
Episode 2)

478
00:31:24,678 --> 00:31:27,148
The order came straight
from the CEO. My hands are tied.

479
00:31:27,148 --> 00:31:28,718
Just worry about how you can end
your show on a good note.

480
00:31:28,718 --> 00:31:29,869
Then choose.

481
00:31:30,249 --> 00:31:31,778
Will you protect your show...

482
00:31:32,319 --> 00:31:33,909
or your pride?

483
00:31:49,869 --> 00:31:52,328
We wanted to talk to you
about your text message in person.

484
00:31:53,009 --> 00:31:54,384
We have some questions for you
as well.

485
00:31:54,408 --> 00:31:55,528
Yes.

486
00:31:55,978 --> 00:31:57,468
I'll do everything in my power...

487
00:31:57,878 --> 00:31:59,538
to help you catch the jerk
who killed Eun Sae.

488
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:04,238
So, she asked you to find her
a bodyguard the day before she died?

489
00:32:05,218 --> 00:32:06,639
Yes, out of the blue.

490
00:32:07,059 --> 00:32:09,718
I asked if someone was stalking her
or if she had a stalker fan,

491
00:32:09,718 --> 00:32:12,278
but she just said to find
a bodyguard as soon as possible.

492
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:16,999
We heard that a man threatened her
with a jackknife...

493
00:32:16,999 --> 00:32:18,369
by the rear entrance
of Leaders Palace...

494
00:32:18,369 --> 00:32:20,689
about three weeks ago.

495
00:32:21,269 --> 00:32:23,198
Did a similar incident happen
in the past?

496
00:32:23,198 --> 00:32:24,328
Really?

497
00:32:25,638 --> 00:32:26,938
This is my first time
hearing about it.

498
00:32:26,938 --> 00:32:29,629
We heard
he was wearing a gray zip-up jacket.

499
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:31,669
Does anyone come to mind?

500
00:32:31,948 --> 00:32:33,339
A gray zip-up jacket?

501
00:32:35,978 --> 00:32:37,179
Could it be that guy?

502
00:32:39,019 --> 00:32:41,609
They sent so many gifts.

503
00:32:41,658 --> 00:32:43,748
They're the source
of my energy these days.

504
00:32:44,488 --> 00:32:45,978
- I'll put them here.
- Okay.

505
00:32:49,898 --> 00:32:51,018
My goodness.

506
00:32:51,769 --> 00:32:54,988
I came to check the windows
and walls for condensation.

507
00:32:56,039 --> 00:32:58,659
You should come in
when the office is occupied.

508
00:32:59,269 --> 00:33:00,699
You can go now.

509
00:33:07,049 --> 00:33:08,139
Hey.

510
00:33:08,878 --> 00:33:10,409
You look nicer...

511
00:33:10,619 --> 00:33:13,008
in tight clothes than baggy stuff.

512
00:33:15,589 --> 00:33:17,619
What did he say? Is he insane?

513
00:33:18,228 --> 00:33:20,218
Can you recognize him from a photo?

514
00:33:21,228 --> 00:33:22,748
(Resume)

515
00:33:31,369 --> 00:33:32,459
Excuse me.

516
00:33:32,839 --> 00:33:36,328
Can I see who was on patrol
the night of October 6?

517
00:33:36,638 --> 00:33:37,998
Sure. Just a moment.

518
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:39,439
Thanks.

519
00:33:40,948 --> 00:33:42,038
(Resume)

520
00:33:43,049 --> 00:33:44,139
Hey.

521
00:33:45,119 --> 00:33:46,308
I think this is the guy.

522
00:33:49,658 --> 00:33:50,658
Kim Min Chul?

523
00:33:50,658 --> 00:33:52,428
Jung Soo Won
was on duty that morning.

524
00:33:52,428 --> 00:33:53,518
(Kim Min Chul)

525
00:33:53,859 --> 00:33:55,748
Kim Min Chul was on duty
that afternoon.

526
00:33:58,728 --> 00:33:59,975
Where does he sit?

527
00:33:59,999 --> 00:34:01,189
At the end over there.

528
00:34:15,319 --> 00:34:17,609
My gosh. What a weird taste.

529
00:34:22,059 --> 00:34:23,549
(Seol Woo Jae,
one thousand, by early October)

530
00:34:27,158 --> 00:34:28,618
Where's Kim now?

531
00:34:49,619 --> 00:34:50,779
Why are you filming this?

532
00:34:52,019 --> 00:34:53,109
What do you mean?

533
00:34:54,619 --> 00:34:55,808
You're Kim Min Chul, right?

534
00:34:56,088 --> 00:34:57,504
Oh, Min Chul's...

535
00:34:57,528 --> 00:34:58,948
Hey! Min Chul!

536
00:35:01,729 --> 00:35:02,848
Darn you.

537
00:35:07,198 --> 00:35:09,489
Shoot. Darn it!

538
00:35:09,939 --> 00:35:11,029
Hey!

539
00:35:13,338 --> 00:35:14,428
Stop!

540
00:35:21,419 --> 00:35:22,538
Stop running!

541
00:35:25,789 --> 00:35:26,879
I got a cramp. My gosh.

542
00:35:32,459 --> 00:35:33,689
I knew it.

543
00:35:45,869 --> 00:35:47,669
Please let me off.

544
00:35:48,039 --> 00:35:50,498
You're begging for your life,

545
00:35:50,879 --> 00:35:52,178
so you did do something bad.

546
00:35:52,178 --> 00:35:56,408
I'll try to get the money somehow,
as soon as possible.

547
00:35:56,479 --> 00:35:58,678
Forget the money. I'm a detective.

548
00:35:59,948 --> 00:36:01,178
I'm confiscating this.

549
00:36:01,218 --> 00:36:02,308
Detective Oh.

550
00:36:03,388 --> 00:36:06,219
Did you use that to try to cut off
your finger in front of Cha Eun Sae?

551
00:36:08,629 --> 00:36:10,149
How do you know Seol Woo Jae?

552
00:36:12,769 --> 00:36:16,388
I went to high school
with Woo Jae. Why?

553
00:36:19,508 --> 00:36:20,508
What does this mean?

554
00:36:20,508 --> 00:36:21,598
(Seol Woo Jae,
one thousand, by early October)

555
00:36:22,579 --> 00:36:23,839
I wanted to borrow money.

556
00:36:24,778 --> 00:36:25,998
That's why you called him?

557
00:36:26,108 --> 00:36:27,768
- Did you get the loan?
- Yes.

558
00:36:28,718 --> 00:36:30,169
Why are you...

559
00:36:31,088 --> 00:36:32,709
doing this to me?

560
00:36:35,818 --> 00:36:38,419
Come to Gangha Police Station
by 7 p.m. tomorrow and I'll tell you.

561
00:36:44,399 --> 00:36:46,658
If you're a no-show,
I'll raid your home.

562
00:36:51,108 --> 00:36:53,198
- Darn it.
- Detective Oh.

563
00:36:56,238 --> 00:36:58,598
I think he ditched his phone.

564
00:36:58,908 --> 00:37:00,339
Follow him. Run.

565
00:37:00,548 --> 00:37:02,149
Punish her for murder!

566
00:37:02,149 --> 00:37:04,024
- Punish her.
- Punish her.

567
00:37:04,048 --> 00:37:06,888
Cancel the show "Nothing Uncovered!"

568
00:37:06,888 --> 00:37:08,678
- Cancel it.
- Cancel it.

569
00:37:09,189 --> 00:37:11,149
There she is! You murderer!

570
00:37:11,758 --> 00:37:13,798
- You murderer!
- You killed Eun Sae!

571
00:37:13,798 --> 00:37:15,819
- How could you?
- Murderer!

572
00:37:18,999 --> 00:37:21,399
Bring Cha Eun Sae back!

573
00:37:21,399 --> 00:37:23,489
- You murderer!
- Bring her back!

574
00:37:23,968 --> 00:37:25,998
Don't. How can you throw eggs?

575
00:37:26,638 --> 00:37:27,979
- Bring her back!
- Stop it!

576
00:37:27,979 --> 00:37:31,339
(Cancel "Nothing Uncovered")

577
00:37:33,079 --> 00:37:34,339
Over the past few days,

578
00:37:34,749 --> 00:37:36,768
my husband and I have caused
great distress.

579
00:37:37,619 --> 00:37:39,209
For that, I'm sorry.

580
00:37:39,749 --> 00:37:40,908
Also,

581
00:37:41,419 --> 00:37:43,609
I show great remorse...

582
00:37:44,258 --> 00:37:47,419
and offer heartfelt condolences
to the late Cha Eun Sae.

583
00:37:48,698 --> 00:37:49,999
Get lost, murderer!

584
00:37:49,999 --> 00:37:51,928
- You killed her!
- Darn you!

585
00:37:51,928 --> 00:37:54,158
- Get lost, murderer!
- Don't lie!

586
00:37:54,869 --> 00:37:57,169
Why did the police question you both?

587
00:37:57,169 --> 00:37:58,539
What did they ask you?

588
00:37:58,539 --> 00:38:00,738
Were you questioned
because you were connected...

589
00:38:00,738 --> 00:38:02,368
to Cha Eun Sae's death?

590
00:38:03,479 --> 00:38:05,239
The questions I was asked...

591
00:38:05,379 --> 00:38:07,538
are part of an ongoing investigation.

592
00:38:07,778 --> 00:38:10,578
I hope you understand
why I can't tell you about it.

593
00:38:10,749 --> 00:38:11,849
As reported,

594
00:38:11,849 --> 00:38:14,879
was Cha having an affair
with your husband Seol Woo Jae?

595
00:38:18,289 --> 00:38:19,379
No.

596
00:38:25,798 --> 00:38:27,359
(Seo says Cha and Seol
were not dating)

597
00:38:27,698 --> 00:38:29,129
That's nonsense.

598
00:38:32,439 --> 00:38:33,558
No?

599
00:38:35,138 --> 00:38:37,469
That's right. They weren't dating.

600
00:38:37,508 --> 00:38:40,138
The photo in the article was taken
at your husband's studio, right?

601
00:38:40,278 --> 00:38:41,939
- If that's not a photo...
- Even if...

602
00:38:44,189 --> 00:38:45,578
they were dating,

603
00:38:46,448 --> 00:38:47,808
it doesn't change anything.

604
00:38:49,218 --> 00:38:51,819
I still believe in my husband.

605
00:38:56,428 --> 00:38:57,518
And I love him.

606
00:38:58,968 --> 00:39:00,899
- She what?
- Love, my foot.

607
00:39:00,899 --> 00:39:02,944
- What nonsense is that?
- No way.

608
00:39:02,968 --> 00:39:04,384
- That's stupid.
- I know.

609
00:39:04,408 --> 00:39:07,268
Someone reported today
that you separated.

610
00:39:08,178 --> 00:39:09,209
That's wrong too.

611
00:39:09,209 --> 00:39:10,749
Are you denying the affair...

612
00:39:10,749 --> 00:39:12,785
or are you saying you forgive him?

613
00:39:12,809 --> 00:39:14,469
As I just said,

614
00:39:14,948 --> 00:39:17,849
the support
I offer my husband is unwavering.

615
00:39:17,849 --> 00:39:20,619
What do you have to say
about Cha's murder?

616
00:39:20,619 --> 00:39:22,978
I hope the culprit's caught
as soon as possible.

617
00:39:23,318 --> 00:39:26,978
As a journalist myself,
I'll follow the story...

618
00:39:27,329 --> 00:39:29,129
until the truth is revealed.

619
00:39:29,129 --> 00:39:31,769
Do you think
there's zero possibility...

620
00:39:31,769 --> 00:39:33,319
you'll end up being a suspect?

621
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:39,328
I do.

622
00:39:39,568 --> 00:39:41,669
- Regarding the recent rumors...
- Cancel the show!

623
00:39:45,709 --> 00:39:47,638
Why did you add oil to the fire?

624
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:49,538
Don't you know
you made things worse?

625
00:39:50,178 --> 00:39:52,009
Nothing sounds
as suspicious as silence.

626
00:39:55,818 --> 00:39:57,948
Don't keep the egg on
as if it's a medal.

627
00:40:01,358 --> 00:40:03,118
Your show won't be canceled for now.

628
00:40:05,629 --> 00:40:07,328
That was a close call.

629
00:40:08,399 --> 00:40:11,158
- Thanks for having our back.
- Thank you.

630
00:40:11,638 --> 00:40:14,654
Be grateful Team Two's proposal
got dumped.

631
00:40:14,678 --> 00:40:16,608
I bet the big boss wasn't satisfied.

632
00:40:16,608 --> 00:40:19,809
There's no way
you can make a show to replace ours.

633
00:40:19,809 --> 00:40:21,339
That's impossible, to be honest.

634
00:40:22,249 --> 00:40:24,825
Why did you say "for now?"
Could the show still get canceled?

635
00:40:24,849 --> 00:40:26,339
That was the term the boss used.

636
00:40:26,619 --> 00:40:28,279
He might be thinking about
the seasonal shuffle.

637
00:40:28,789 --> 00:40:31,078
The public
has zero trust in Jung Won.

638
00:40:32,789 --> 00:40:35,059
We have a taped show
to air next week.

639
00:40:35,059 --> 00:40:37,575
The Asian Games start
the week after that.

640
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:40,788
You have a month to bring me a story
to turn around public sentiment.

641
00:40:40,869 --> 00:40:42,158
That's your way out.

642
00:40:42,439 --> 00:40:45,459
Nothing's more powerful
than finding Cha's killer.

643
00:40:47,579 --> 00:40:50,524
The boss said everyone's banned
from mentioning that name.

644
00:40:50,548 --> 00:40:52,598
Drop that story. I warned you.

645
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:57,448
(Nothing Uncovered)

646
00:40:57,448 --> 00:40:58,538
Hey.

647
00:40:59,849 --> 00:41:01,078
He had an affair.

648
00:41:01,619 --> 00:41:02,779
You moved out.

649
00:41:02,858 --> 00:41:04,879
Why are you acting like a martyr?

650
00:41:05,829 --> 00:41:06,959
"I love him."

651
00:41:06,959 --> 00:41:08,858
You angered not just Cha's fans,

652
00:41:08,858 --> 00:41:10,928
but your own fans too.

653
00:41:10,928 --> 00:41:14,158
The website's plastered with people
saying they want you gone.

654
00:41:14,269 --> 00:41:16,788
What will you do
if next week's story bombs?

655
00:41:16,968 --> 00:41:18,328
Will you take the fall?

656
00:41:19,809 --> 00:41:21,228
Do whatever you want!

657
00:41:29,149 --> 00:41:30,268
Ae Na.

658
00:41:31,088 --> 00:41:32,739
Because of me, in many ways...

659
00:41:33,249 --> 00:41:35,308
In many ways, it is a shock.

660
00:41:35,789 --> 00:41:38,448
You of all people
defended your cheating husband.

661
00:41:39,528 --> 00:41:41,948
You know why I swore to stay single.

662
00:41:43,298 --> 00:41:46,558
I was because the jerk hid
that he was married to toy with me.

663
00:41:47,269 --> 00:41:48,959
I almost lost my mind.

664
00:41:50,238 --> 00:41:51,899
You know that better than anyone.

665
00:41:54,309 --> 00:41:56,698
- Ae Na.
- I get everything else.

666
00:41:59,979 --> 00:42:01,408
But not this.

667
00:42:02,579 --> 00:42:03,939
You feel like...

668
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:06,209
a stranger.

Ms. Seo.

675
00:43:02,838 --> 00:43:05,038
You must be in a bad mood
because of what I did.

676
00:43:06,008 --> 00:43:07,579
I told the detective
what happened...

677
00:43:07,579 --> 00:43:08,794
- because...
- I know why.

678
00:43:08,818 --> 00:43:11,088
It's because
I suspected that you sent me...

679
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:12,538
the wrong unit number on purpose.

680
00:43:12,948 --> 00:43:15,448
To be honest, I did suspect you.

681
00:43:15,689 --> 00:43:17,748
It was an honest mistake. I swear.

682
00:43:18,129 --> 00:43:20,258
I thought that telling him the truth
would be better...

683
00:43:20,258 --> 00:43:22,689
for both of us than feeling like
I did something wrong.

684
00:43:23,959 --> 00:43:26,919
Besides,
I was pretty close to Cha Eun Sae.

685
00:43:28,169 --> 00:43:30,039
- Is that so?
- Somehow, I ended up...

686
00:43:30,039 --> 00:43:31,269
becoming her close friend.

687
00:43:31,269 --> 00:43:34,198
So I felt even worse about it.
I hope you understand.

688
00:43:35,278 --> 00:43:36,629
Don't worry about it.

689
00:43:37,108 --> 00:43:38,839

What are you doing?

696
00:44:29,528 --> 00:44:30,959
That's what I want to ask.
What are you up to?

697
00:44:32,999 --> 00:44:34,228
Did you cut a deal
with your husband?

698
00:44:34,499 --> 00:44:35,638
Did he promise you a reward
if you looked the other way?

699
00:44:35,638 --> 00:44:36,828
Is that why you defended him?

700
00:44:37,238 --> 00:44:39,698
- Could you leave?
- Or does he have something on you?

701
00:44:40,939 --> 00:44:42,868
Did he find out
that you're the culprit?

702
00:44:43,539 --> 00:44:44,669
I asked you to leave.

703
00:44:46,349 --> 00:44:47,638
I get it now.

704
00:44:48,649 --> 00:44:50,408
You were working together.
This is all part of the plan, right?

705
00:44:53,548 --> 00:44:54,649
Detective Kim.

706
00:44:55,419 --> 00:44:56,978
If we were accomplices,

707
00:44:57,459 --> 00:44:58,629
why would I desperately...

708
00:44:58,629 --> 00:45:01,189
try to get to the bottom
of my husband's affair?

709
00:45:01,499 --> 00:45:02,888
Do you think
your accusation makes any sense?

710
00:45:03,928 --> 00:45:04,975
Speculation One.

711
00:45:04,999 --> 00:45:06,859
After Seol Woo Jae made an alibi
for himself,

712
00:45:07,329 --> 00:45:09,629
he hired someone
to kill Cha Eun Sae.

713
00:45:10,039 --> 00:45:11,428
But you had already killed her.

714
00:45:13,039 --> 00:45:14,778
Speculation Two.
Seol Woo Jae hired someone...

715
00:45:14,778 --> 00:45:16,728
to kill Cha Eun Sae.

716
00:45:17,709 --> 00:45:18,939
And the killer murdered her.

717
00:45:19,809 --> 00:45:21,908
You found Cha Eun Sae.

718
00:45:22,479 --> 00:45:23,638
But...

719
00:45:24,048 --> 00:45:25,689
you neglected her
and left her there to die.

720
00:45:25,689 --> 00:45:27,249
- No.
- Which part are you denying?

721
00:45:27,249 --> 00:45:28,908
Killing her? Or leaving her to die?

722
00:45:42,099 --> 00:45:44,338
- Step aside.
- Stop that. What are you doing?

723
00:45:44,338 --> 00:45:45,459
Seo Jung Won!

724
00:46:26,209 --> 00:46:27,439
Did you not think...

725
00:46:27,718 --> 00:46:29,178
I would get my hands
on the crime scene photos...

726
00:46:29,178 --> 00:46:30,339
after you interviewed me?

727
00:46:31,048 --> 00:46:32,509
Someone put my necklace...

728
00:46:33,388 --> 00:46:35,248
in Cha Eun Sae's hand to frame me.

729
00:46:38,059 --> 00:46:39,219
Can a police officer...

730
00:46:39,459 --> 00:46:41,689
barge into a hotel room
when a woman is staying alone?

731
00:46:42,129 --> 00:46:43,348
Are you out of your mind?

732
00:46:44,129 --> 00:46:45,288
Speak for yourself.

733
00:46:46,099 --> 00:46:48,589
How could you say you trust
and support that cheating scumbag?

734
00:46:49,338 --> 00:46:51,238
You should be expressing how much
you want to kill him instead.

735
00:46:51,238 --> 00:46:53,269
I resent him so much that
I want to kill him...

736
00:46:53,269 --> 00:46:54,669
because I love him that much.

737
00:47:05,419 --> 00:47:06,509
Please leave.

738
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:18,719
Hey!

739
00:47:24,269 --> 00:47:25,658
Your husband bought this coat
for you, right?

740
00:47:26,068 --> 00:47:28,399
What about that?
Why are you taking a photo of that?

741
00:47:29,309 --> 00:47:30,778
When you go back home, ask him...

742
00:47:30,778 --> 00:47:32,268
for whom he bought the same coat.

743
00:47:32,709 --> 00:47:34,239
Ask him who that woman is.

744
00:47:35,749 --> 00:47:37,649
- What?
- On the day Cha was murdered,

745
00:47:37,649 --> 00:47:39,419
a woman was with Seol Woo Jae
in his office.

746
00:47:39,419 --> 00:47:40,448
The same woman went
into Leaders Palace...

747
00:47:40,448 --> 00:47:41,748
around the estimated time of death.

748
00:47:42,218 --> 00:47:43,218
That must be why...

749
00:47:43,218 --> 00:47:45,078
your husband is trying very hard
to conceal her identity.

750
00:47:47,559 --> 00:47:49,499
How many women is your husband...

751
00:47:49,499 --> 00:47:50,989
seeing?

752
00:47:54,999 --> 00:47:56,158
Say that again.

753
00:47:56,269 --> 00:47:57,899
A woman? What woman?

754
00:47:58,638 --> 00:48:00,259
I gave you a heads-up...

755
00:48:00,468 --> 00:48:01,868
about your husband.

756
00:48:13,249 --> 00:48:16,209
(The late Seo Sang Gyeon)

757
00:49:07,916 --> 00:49:09,275
I'm not dreaming, right?

758
00:49:13,813 --> 00:49:15,043
What are you doing here?

759
00:49:17,353 --> 00:49:18,773
I saw your interview
in the afternoon.

760
00:49:20,154 --> 00:49:21,313
Thank you.

761
00:49:21,723 --> 00:49:22,954
I didn't do it for you.

762
00:49:26,594 --> 00:49:27,724
I know.

763
00:49:29,304 --> 00:49:31,353
I decided to join
my father's company.

764
00:49:32,234 --> 00:49:33,923
He said he would only help you
if I did that.

765
00:49:36,304 --> 00:49:38,133
I'll get rid of my office soon.

766
00:49:38,543 --> 00:49:39,664
You'll stop...

767
00:49:40,944 --> 00:49:42,164
writing novels?

768
00:49:45,313 --> 00:49:46,704
Novels are just novels.

769
00:49:48,513 --> 00:49:50,213
I just need you by my side.

770
00:49:55,094 --> 00:49:56,914
I could put up with everything,

771
00:49:58,293 --> 00:49:59,423
but not having you...

772
00:50:02,063 --> 00:50:03,923
in this house was unbearable.

773
00:50:05,663 --> 00:50:07,664
- You...
- When you go back home, ask him...

774
00:50:07,734 --> 00:50:09,473
for whom he bought the same coat.

775
00:50:09,473 --> 00:50:11,034
Ask him who that woman is.

776
00:50:14,944 --> 00:50:16,173
Sleep in the bedroom.

777
00:50:16,784 --> 00:50:18,214
I'll sleep in the study.

778
00:50:18,214 --> 00:50:20,413
No. You should sleep in the bed.

779
00:50:20,413 --> 00:50:22,874
From now on, just do as I say.
If you don't,

780
00:50:23,723 --> 00:50:24,943
I'll move out again.

781
00:51:00,094 --> 00:51:01,244
What are you doing?

782
00:51:08,293 --> 00:51:10,253
I can't find
one of my USB flash drives.

783
00:51:10,663 --> 00:51:11,824
It was here.

784
00:51:12,603 --> 00:51:13,764
Is that so?

785
00:51:14,634 --> 00:51:15,793
Why did you wake up?

786
00:51:16,344 --> 00:51:17,594
I got thirsty.

787
00:51:18,404 --> 00:51:20,333
Are you having trouble
going to sleep even with the pills?

788
00:51:22,243 --> 00:51:23,804
I'm going out for a drive.

789
00:52:11,024 --> 00:52:12,493
(Recording 014)

790
00:52:12,493 --> 00:52:13,824
Chief editor.

791
00:52:14,194 --> 00:52:16,454
I wanted to talk about something.

792
00:52:18,364 --> 00:52:19,523
Father.

793
00:52:19,603 --> 00:52:22,423
I'd rather die than leave Jung Won.

794
00:52:42,353 --> 00:52:46,124
(Recording 056)

795
00:52:53,703 --> 00:52:54,923
(Recording 056)

796
00:53:16,964 --> 00:53:20,023
I think your return means...

797
00:53:21,293 --> 00:53:23,954
you'll give me another chance.

798
00:53:24,563 --> 00:53:27,523
Even if you deny it,
that's what I'll believe.

799
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:34,903
Every moment,
for the rest of my life,

800
00:53:35,774 --> 00:53:37,374
I'll make it up to you.

801
00:53:37,884 --> 00:53:39,003
I still won't...

802
00:53:40,583 --> 00:53:41,943
forgive you.

803
00:53:42,884 --> 00:53:46,244
But you gave up your dream for me,

804
00:53:47,524 --> 00:53:48,744
so I'll give you a chance.

805
00:54:04,373 --> 00:54:05,463
Thank you...

806
00:54:05,603 --> 00:54:06,764
so much.

807
00:54:08,243 --> 00:54:09,403
Thank you.

808
00:54:16,453 --> 00:54:19,244
I won't let you down again.

809
00:54:19,924 --> 00:54:23,153
I won't lose out on this chance.

810
00:54:26,263 --> 00:54:30,023
I'm the one
who won't lose out on this chance.

811
00:54:31,904 --> 00:54:33,023
The chance...

812
00:54:34,004 --> 00:54:35,764
to let you crash and burn.

813
00:54:37,844 --> 00:54:38,963
That's what I vowed...

814
00:54:39,813 --> 00:54:41,164
at that very moment.

815
00:54:42,543 --> 00:54:44,733
I get that you want revenge,

816
00:54:45,043 --> 00:54:46,244
but...

817
00:54:46,554 --> 00:54:48,804
I'm not entirely sure
what you'll do.

818
00:54:52,683 --> 00:54:53,993
(Recording 059)

819
00:54:53,993 --> 00:54:55,514
We just have to be careful.

820
00:54:55,694 --> 00:54:57,284
Then Jung Won will never know.

821
00:54:58,364 --> 00:54:59,454
Remember.

822
00:55:00,034 --> 00:55:03,124
You or me.
Neither of us were at the scene.

823
00:55:07,674 --> 00:55:08,894
My husband...

824
00:55:09,574 --> 00:55:10,733
was at...

825
00:55:12,074 --> 00:55:13,704
Cha's office the day she died.

826
00:55:15,114 --> 00:55:16,233
Then...

827
00:55:16,784 --> 00:55:20,074
do you think your husband is guilty?

828
00:55:22,824 --> 00:55:24,443
He has an alibi.

829
00:55:25,223 --> 00:55:26,614
The person he called "you."

830
00:55:27,654 --> 00:55:29,213
That must be the killer.

831
00:55:32,364 --> 00:55:33,624
Then...

832
00:55:34,594 --> 00:55:36,724
your husband knows
who the killer is.

833
00:55:36,933 --> 00:55:38,394
He's protecting the person too.

834
00:55:39,263 --> 00:55:41,824
He even planted evidence
to make me look guilty.

835
00:55:43,444 --> 00:55:45,264
It's likely they're accomplices.

836
00:55:50,944 --> 00:55:52,074
This recording.

837
00:55:53,413 --> 00:55:55,204
Did you play it for the detective?

838
00:55:58,453 --> 00:56:01,244
If I do, he'll bring my husband in
for another interview.

839
00:56:01,393 --> 00:56:02,543
And my husband...

840
00:56:04,094 --> 00:56:07,284
will try even harder
to hide his secret.

841
00:56:08,864 --> 00:56:11,793
Why are you telling me all this?

842
00:56:14,473 --> 00:56:15,594
A doctor...

843
00:56:16,904 --> 00:56:19,193
is sworn to keep
their patients' information secret.

844
00:56:20,214 --> 00:56:21,764
But I heard there was an exception.

845
00:56:22,844 --> 00:56:24,233
If the patient gives permission.

846
00:56:28,453 --> 00:56:29,914
It's an insurance policy of sorts.

847
00:56:30,683 --> 00:56:32,813
If something were to happen to me,

848
00:56:33,924 --> 00:56:37,414
I'd like you to tell the detective
what I just told you.

849
00:56:39,634 --> 00:56:42,883
What Seol Woo Jae is really like
and what he did.

850
00:56:43,634 --> 00:56:44,894
I'll expose him...

851
00:56:45,504 --> 00:56:48,494
and put everything on air.

852
00:56:55,143 --> 00:56:56,304
That means...

853
00:56:57,913 --> 00:57:00,773
you're going to war, Jung Won.

854
00:57:07,623 --> 00:57:09,284
I'm sorry to interrupt the session,

855
00:57:09,694 --> 00:57:11,284
but I must take this call.

856
00:57:21,203 --> 00:57:24,063
(Current location: Mujin Prestige,
Jeongjin-gil 78, Gangha-gu)

857
00:58:06,183 --> 00:58:07,860
Go home and ask your husband...

858
00:58:07,884 --> 00:58:10,914
who else he bought
this same coat for.

859
00:58:10,953 --> 00:58:12,374
The day Cha Eun Sae was murdered,

860
00:58:12,484 --> 00:58:14,154
the woman who was at
Seol's studio with him...

861
00:58:14,154 --> 00:58:16,454
went into Leaders Palace
around her time of death.

862
00:58:16,964 --> 00:58:19,853
For some reason, your husband's
doing his best to hide her.

863
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:35,934
In case you'd like to see it.

864
00:58:41,154 --> 00:58:42,443
(Detective Kim Tae Heon)

865
00:58:42,853 --> 00:58:44,813
(In case you'd like to see it.)

866
00:58:59,734 --> 00:59:00,894
This woman...

867
00:59:01,473 --> 00:59:02,724
is Yoo Yoon Young?

868
00:59:32,933 --> 00:59:34,063
You called it...

869
00:59:35,304 --> 00:59:36,423
a war, didn't you?

870
00:59:38,243 --> 00:59:39,364
Pardon?

871
01:00:15,254 --> 01:00:18,233
(Nothing Uncovered)

872
01:00:18,413 --> 01:00:20,960
She can't reveal
the consultations she filmed.

873
01:00:20,984 --> 01:00:22,784
- What did she film?
- Doctor Yoo.

874
01:00:22,784 --> 01:00:25,813
- She films every one of them.
- Seo Jung Won.

875
01:00:26,254 --> 01:00:27,329
Hello.

876
01:00:27,353 --> 01:00:29,293
What if Seo Jung Won
were to find out...

877
01:00:29,293 --> 01:00:31,454
we had been close for a long time?

878
01:00:32,123 --> 01:00:33,663
Seol Woo Jae and Kim Min Chul
went to Mueon High.

879
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:35,094
Cha Eun Sae was from Mueon too.

880
01:00:35,094 --> 01:00:36,954
Mo Hyung Taek
was in Mueon for a while too.

881
01:00:37,004 --> 01:00:38,703
Everyone related to the Cha case...

882
01:00:38,703 --> 01:00:40,304
used to live in Mueon?

883
01:00:40,304 --> 01:00:41,994
Everyone but Seo Jung Won.

884
01:00:42,103 --> 01:00:44,880
I saw your shirt that night.
There was blood on it.

885
01:00:44,904 --> 01:00:46,934
I must know the truth
if I'm to protect you.

886
01:00:46,973 --> 01:00:48,373
Everyone thinks Seo Jung Won...

887
01:00:48,373 --> 01:00:51,619
and her husband are connected to
Cha Eun Sae's death.

888
01:00:51,643 --> 01:00:53,260
I could've killed her.

889
01:00:53,284 --> 01:00:54,860
You're openly calling me...

890
01:00:54,884 --> 01:00:56,784
the culprit now.

891
01:00:56,784 --> 01:00:57,824
Convince me.

892
01:00:57,824 --> 01:00:59,424
Why aren't you accomplices?

893
01:00:59,424 --> 01:01:01,654
You came after the wrong person.

894
01:01:01,654 --> 01:01:04,753
I'll reveal who killed Cha Eun Sae.

895
01:01:06,094 --> 01:01:08,184
