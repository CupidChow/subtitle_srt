(74M 4272)

Did he...

8
00:00:24,071 --> 00:00:25,201
follow me here?

9
00:00:44,992 --> 00:00:46,562
A knife from your place...

10
00:00:46,761 --> 00:00:49,632
was left at the home of the person that was supposed to be framed,

11
00:00:49,632 --> 00:00:52,501
so we know who will be the next target.

12
00:00:53,662 --> 00:00:56,602
But what if it affects me?

13
00:00:56,602 --> 00:00:59,901
That will not happen. I'm sure of it.

14
00:01:01,772 --> 00:01:02,871
Let me pour you one, sir.

15
00:01:18,191 --> 00:01:21,392
Try and imagine what could happen...

16
00:01:22,191 --> 00:01:24,532
the moment your filth splatters on me.

17
00:01:32,601 --> 00:01:35,211
(74M 4272)

18
00:01:50,751 --> 00:01:51,762
What are you doing?

19
00:01:54,021 --> 00:01:55,392
How dare you tail a police detective?

20
00:01:57,092 --> 00:01:59,762
Assemblyman Mo! Your aide tailed me in Mueon.

21
00:01:59,762 --> 00:02:01,601
Shall I question him at the precinct?

22
00:02:02,232 --> 00:02:03,601
Or shall we talk at your place?

23
00:02:06,202 --> 00:02:08,211
Goodness. You're naive.

24
00:02:09,241 --> 00:02:11,811
Did you think you'd never get caught for tailing a cop?

25
00:02:11,811 --> 00:02:13,341
(Episode 8)

26
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:14,512
I'm really sorry.

27
00:02:16,352 --> 00:02:17,382
I apologize.

28
00:02:17,952 --> 00:02:19,322
Mr. Na. Did hearing...

29
00:02:19,422 --> 00:02:21,452
that I was headed to Mueon make you that anxious?

30
00:02:21,852 --> 00:02:23,222
I heard you were digging up an old case...

31
00:02:23,222 --> 00:02:24,561
Assemblyman Mo was in charge of,

32
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:26,861
so I wanted to figure out what was going on in advance.

33
00:02:27,361 --> 00:02:28,892
We don't want another controversy,

34
00:02:28,892 --> 00:02:30,192
like the one about politicians and the media.

35
00:02:31,232 --> 00:02:33,102
This will probably cause a bigger controversy.

36
00:02:33,561 --> 00:02:35,072
Why do something I never told you to do?

37
00:02:37,271 --> 00:02:38,771
You didn't order him to do it?

38
00:02:40,572 --> 00:02:43,042
No, I assure you he did not. That's far-fetched speculation.

39
00:02:43,211 --> 00:02:44,281
"Far-fetched?"

40
00:02:44,482 --> 00:02:46,482
It's a reasonable speculation from his perspective.

41
00:02:49,482 --> 00:02:51,281
The other detective told me...

42
00:02:51,982 --> 00:02:54,752
that Ms. Jin's ex-husband...

43
00:02:54,752 --> 00:02:57,292
was Park Jin Soo, the manager of the Bongto plant.

44
00:02:57,452 --> 00:02:58,461
Yes.

45
00:02:58,461 --> 00:02:59,961
So that was why she approached my family...

46
00:03:00,322 --> 00:03:03,591
and collected all the articles about me.

47
00:03:04,401 --> 00:03:05,602
Yes, that's what I think too.

48
00:03:07,931 --> 00:03:10,531
Do you think I'm connected...

49
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:12,942
to the murder of Cha Eun Sae as well as Ms. Jin's case?

50
00:03:23,151 --> 00:03:24,982
Is it true that you were Cha Eun Sae's sponsor?

51
00:03:27,482 --> 00:03:28,621
You're a police detective.

52
00:03:29,852 --> 00:03:31,861
You shouldn't let such trashy tabloid stories...

53
00:03:32,322 --> 00:03:33,991
confuse you, right?

54
00:03:36,561 --> 00:03:38,102
In the upcoming local elections,

55
00:03:38,702 --> 00:03:40,732
I'll run for Governor of Gangwon Province.

56
00:03:41,431 --> 00:03:44,472
Both cases have nothing to do with me,

57
00:03:45,771 --> 00:03:48,311
so I hope this doesn't affect...

58
00:03:48,611 --> 00:03:50,512
my campaign schedule.

59
00:03:51,012 --> 00:03:52,512
And you have nothing to do with Cha Geum Sae?

60
00:04:31,122 --> 00:04:32,682
This is from Eun Sae's collection.

61
00:04:34,721 --> 00:04:36,291
She wanted to drink this with me on my birthday.

62
00:04:42,731 --> 00:04:43,762
You see,

63
00:04:44,961 --> 00:04:47,362
Eun Sae and I got along more often than not.

64
00:04:48,372 --> 00:04:50,031
We were the only family to each other.

65
00:04:53,171 --> 00:04:54,841
Had I known it was you,

66
00:04:55,612 --> 00:04:58,211
I wouldn't have done such a stupid thing, you know?

67
00:04:59,211 --> 00:05:00,981
I know everything,

68
00:05:02,081 --> 00:05:03,552
so just confess what you did.

69
00:05:03,552 --> 00:05:05,552
- What? - This is nuts.

70
00:05:22,302 --> 00:05:23,932
What I did? What do you mean?

71
00:05:23,932 --> 00:05:25,401
You killed them all!

72
00:05:25,401 --> 00:05:27,041
Jin Myung Sook and my sister too.

73
00:05:39,552 --> 00:05:40,952
(My Honey)

74
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:44,622
The phone is turned off. Please leave a message...

75
00:05:53,362 --> 00:05:56,401
Hello, Ms. Yang. Are you with Jung Won now?

76
00:05:57,072 --> 00:06:00,202
What? Jung Won left earlier. She said she was tired.

77
00:06:00,341 --> 00:06:01,372
What time did she leave?

78
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:03,711
Around 9:30pm? Why do you ask?

79
00:06:04,211 --> 00:06:06,411
Well, she's not home yet, and her phone is off.

80
00:06:07,312 --> 00:06:08,382
Really?

81
00:06:09,211 --> 00:06:10,351
She'll be home soon.

82
00:06:10,351 --> 00:06:12,481
Yes, please let me know if you hear from her.

83
00:06:37,512 --> 00:06:38,682
Were you waiting for me?

84
00:06:38,682 --> 00:06:40,112
I'm waiting for my wife.

85
00:06:42,211 --> 00:06:43,411
Did you...

86
00:06:44,521 --> 00:06:45,552
see my wife today?

87
00:06:47,921 --> 00:06:50,252
Do you suffer from delusional jealousy? Ask her directly.

88
00:06:51,052 --> 00:06:53,461
Her phone is off, and she's not home yet.

89
00:06:55,992 --> 00:06:59,101
Her colleagues said she left at around 9:30pm. I can't reach her.

90
00:07:02,372 --> 00:07:04,002
So, you didn't see my wife today.

91
00:07:05,242 --> 00:07:06,702
Clearly, you seem relieved.

92
00:07:06,702 --> 00:07:09,541
It's so obvious that you're still hung up on her.

93
00:07:16,281 --> 00:07:19,182
Jung Won promised me...

94
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:20,882
that she'd keep her distance from you.

95
00:07:22,122 --> 00:07:24,892
Jung Won and I will never split up,

96
00:07:25,992 --> 00:07:29,192
so don't get your hopes up.

97
00:07:41,101 --> 00:07:43,971
The phone is turned off. Please leave...

98
00:08:24,521 --> 00:08:28,651
Hey, you! Darn you.

99
00:08:29,921 --> 00:08:32,421
However much you freak out,

100
00:08:33,122 --> 00:08:34,892
no one can hear you. Why?

101
00:08:35,691 --> 00:08:37,291
When you passed out,

102
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:39,102
the guard made his last round.

103
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:42,972
So let's not waste each other's energy, okay?

104
00:08:44,431 --> 00:08:47,142
Do you think no one will look for me?

105
00:08:48,311 --> 00:08:49,872
What you're doing is a crime.

106
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:56,281
Don't you care about your crimes?

107
00:08:57,012 --> 00:08:58,122
Darn you!

108
00:09:00,222 --> 00:09:01,291
Hey.

109
00:09:02,222 --> 00:09:03,892
I know everything.

110
00:09:04,392 --> 00:09:07,021
The same person killed Jin Myung Sook and my sister.

111
00:09:07,362 --> 00:09:08,431
Darn it.

112
00:09:11,232 --> 00:09:12,732
And that it was you.

113
00:09:15,671 --> 00:09:16,671
So...

114
00:09:18,002 --> 00:09:19,271
quit acting out.

115
00:09:19,842 --> 00:09:22,142
I'll record everything, so confess.

116
00:09:24,781 --> 00:09:25,882
Why are you doing this?

117
00:09:26,382 --> 00:09:28,281
Why are you convinced it was me?

118
00:09:28,281 --> 00:09:30,911
You're trying really hard not to get it.

119
00:09:31,222 --> 00:09:34,082
I'll show you, then.

120
00:09:39,661 --> 00:09:40,722
You know...

121
00:09:41,632 --> 00:09:44,362
what this bag is, don't you?

122
00:09:48,431 --> 00:09:51,801
(The day of Jin Myung Sook's murder)

123
00:10:00,642 --> 00:10:01,951
Hello, Mr. Song.

124
00:10:04,352 --> 00:10:06,181
I'm watching her.

125
00:10:06,852 --> 00:10:08,852
The woman stays indoors...

126
00:10:08,852 --> 00:10:10,252
once she returns from work.

127
00:10:11,492 --> 00:10:14,762
You can't dock my pay even if I don't get anything.

128
00:10:16,732 --> 00:10:18,862
Okay, then. Bye.

129
00:10:27,102 --> 00:10:28,941
No one else went up there.

130
00:10:40,622 --> 00:10:41,951
It's me.

131
00:10:43,352 --> 00:10:46,492
Jin Myung Sook seems to have a visitor.

132
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:48,931
If I find out who it is,

133
00:10:49,931 --> 00:10:50,931
I want double.

134
00:10:51,801 --> 00:10:52,862
Deal?

135
00:11:11,151 --> 00:11:12,222
What the heck?

136
00:11:16,951 --> 00:11:17,951
Lady.

137
00:11:21,061 --> 00:11:22,132
What's this?

138
00:11:24,561 --> 00:11:26,701
Darn it. Lady.

139
00:11:26,901 --> 00:11:29,931
What's this? What's all this money?

140
00:11:29,931 --> 00:11:30,972
Help...

141
00:11:32,372 --> 00:11:34,002
What do you want me to do?

142
00:11:34,502 --> 00:11:35,872
Darn it.

143
00:11:35,972 --> 00:11:38,242
Help me.

144
00:11:46,082 --> 00:11:47,681
That's why when you visited me,

145
00:11:48,521 --> 00:11:49,951
you recognized this bag.

146
00:11:50,992 --> 00:11:53,321
Because you were hiding right there.

147
00:11:54,191 --> 00:11:55,362
Ms. Jin...

148
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:57,291
was still alive then?

149
00:12:01,901 --> 00:12:04,972
The person who was hiding. It wasn't me. I...

150
00:12:05,602 --> 00:12:08,372
I went in after Ms. Jin had died.

151
00:12:08,372 --> 00:12:09,472
Don't you lie.

152
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:13,612
How did you recognize this bag, then?

153
00:12:15,252 --> 00:12:16,852
I'd taken it and ran by then.

154
00:12:18,421 --> 00:12:19,451
Anyway,

155
00:12:20,821 --> 00:12:22,892
I didn't know you'd been at the scene.

156
00:12:30,691 --> 00:12:32,132
What you're saying is,

157
00:12:34,132 --> 00:12:35,832
you realized that just now...

158
00:12:37,071 --> 00:12:38,171
because I told you?

159
00:12:44,781 --> 00:12:46,541
Don't play any tricks.

160
00:12:47,811 --> 00:12:49,451
Admit that you killed her.

161
00:12:54,151 --> 00:12:55,892
Before I go down for it.

162
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,472
(Call)

163
00:13:11,571 --> 00:13:12,602
(Reporter Seo Jung Won)

164
00:13:13,472 --> 00:13:16,472
The phone is turned off.

165
00:13:16,472 --> 00:13:18,681
Please leave a message after the tone.

166
00:13:26,451 --> 00:13:28,921
Seo Jung Won's phone has been off since last night.

167
00:13:28,921 --> 00:13:30,051
Find out where it last was.

168
00:14:01,951 --> 00:14:03,691
I'm at the place where Seo Jung Won's phone was turned off.

169
00:14:03,691 --> 00:14:06,191
Her car's here with the door open and the dashcam memory card gone.

170
00:14:06,191 --> 00:14:08,191
What? What about traffic cameras?

171
00:14:09,531 --> 00:14:11,291
There aren't any. Something happened.

172
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:13,232
Who would try to hurt her?

173
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:15,771
Someone who'd hurt her on purpose...

174
00:14:16,632 --> 00:14:19,201
I know you're a reporter, but can you try to play it safe?

175
00:14:20,771 --> 00:14:22,212
What if Cha Geum Sae turns out to be the culprit?

176
00:14:22,212 --> 00:14:24,811
Then you were alone in the house with a murderer.

177
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:26,811
I have to go.

178
00:14:40,892 --> 00:14:42,092
Stop, right there.

179
00:14:51,372 --> 00:14:53,872
Cha Geum Sae's car was spotted near where Seo's phone went off.

180
00:14:53,872 --> 00:14:56,342
Locate the jerk now. Hurry!

181
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:58,541
Goodness.

182
00:15:06,722 --> 00:15:08,321
Darn it.

183
00:15:33,212 --> 00:15:35,082
Since you won't confess,

184
00:15:36,681 --> 00:15:39,781
I must avenge my sister's death in person.

185
00:15:40,122 --> 00:15:41,151
Okay.

186
00:15:42,222 --> 00:15:43,252
I'll do it.

187
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:48,021
You should've said that sooner.

188
00:15:48,021 --> 00:15:49,962
Where is it? Hang on.

189
00:15:52,801 --> 00:15:53,862
Go.

190
00:15:56,701 --> 00:15:58,102
The person who killed Jin Myung Sook.

191
00:16:05,181 --> 00:16:06,441
It was you, Cha Geum Sae.

192
00:16:07,242 --> 00:16:09,051
If you'd called for help right away,

193
00:16:09,781 --> 00:16:11,451
she would've survived.

194
00:16:12,951 --> 00:16:14,882
Why did you steal from your sister and beat her?

195
00:16:14,882 --> 00:16:17,321
Why avenge her when you don't deserve to be a brother?

196
00:16:17,921 --> 00:16:19,462
Do you have a death wish?

197
00:16:27,362 --> 00:16:28,401
Darn it.

198
00:16:29,832 --> 00:16:30,872
Shoot.

199
00:16:36,512 --> 00:16:39,181
Open the door before I bash it in!

200
00:16:39,181 --> 00:16:41,811
I'll kill you. Open the door.

201
00:16:41,982 --> 00:16:43,112
Darn it.

202
00:17:09,411 --> 00:17:10,842
The psycho witch.

203
00:17:11,042 --> 00:17:13,441
She wants to go all the way, doesn't she?

204
00:17:14,082 --> 00:17:16,782
Fine, then. Let's do it.

205
00:17:44,019 --> 00:17:46,618
Just like you said, I found Jung Won's car at this location.

206
00:17:46,618 --> 00:17:47,789
The memory card for her dashcam is gone.

207
00:17:48,789 --> 00:17:50,128
Where's Detective Kim now?

208
00:17:50,128 --> 00:17:51,459
I'm still looking into that.

209
00:17:51,459 --> 00:17:54,059
(Gangha Felice Apartment)

210
00:17:54,229 --> 00:17:55,428
That's Cha Eun Sae's house.

211
00:17:55,428 --> 00:17:57,898
Sir, I just located Detective Kim.

212
00:18:01,838 --> 00:18:02,868
Why isn't this breaking?

213
00:18:03,939 --> 00:18:05,908
Darn it. Come on.

214
00:18:09,108 --> 00:18:11,279
I kept telling you to behave, didn't I?

215
00:18:12,249 --> 00:18:13,249
Okay?

216
00:18:13,719 --> 00:18:15,388
Come here.

217
00:18:15,388 --> 00:18:16,489
Come out.

218
00:18:18,719 --> 00:18:19,918
Darn you.

219
00:18:22,189 --> 00:18:23,189
Gosh.

220
00:18:24,989 --> 00:18:26,999
Come on. Seriously!

221
00:18:26,999 --> 00:18:29,868
Hey, look at us. What are we doing? Seriously.

222
00:18:30,499 --> 00:18:33,539
Look at this mess. Okay? Darn it.

223
00:18:39,138 --> 00:18:40,279
You should just die.

224
00:18:42,309 --> 00:18:43,309
You...

225
00:18:46,049 --> 00:18:47,049
You... Darn it.

226
00:18:48,848 --> 00:18:50,348
Just die.

227
00:18:52,388 --> 00:18:53,459
Die.

228
00:19:13,108 --> 00:19:14,108
Die.

229
00:19:32,029 --> 00:19:33,499
Hey.

230
00:19:33,499 --> 00:19:34,898
You have the right to an attorney.

231
00:19:35,729 --> 00:19:37,168
You'll have a chance to tell your side of the story.

232
00:19:38,539 --> 00:19:41,039
But I clearly saw you choking her like this.

233
00:19:41,568 --> 00:19:42,568
You...

234
00:19:43,668 --> 00:19:44,709
Hey.

235
00:19:46,439 --> 00:19:47,608
Tae Heon.

236
00:19:49,408 --> 00:19:51,408
I'll cuff him. You should help Ms. Seo.

237
00:20:00,618 --> 00:20:02,459
Hey, I'm the victim here.

238
00:20:07,428 --> 00:20:08,428
Are you okay?

239
00:20:16,709 --> 00:20:17,739
Darn it.

240
00:20:38,898 --> 00:20:39,959
I'm sorry...

241
00:20:41,358 --> 00:20:42,428
for taking so long.

242
00:21:12,499 --> 00:21:13,628
Jung Won.

243
00:21:19,598 --> 00:21:20,699
I'm sorry.

244
00:21:21,539 --> 00:21:23,309
I should have gotten here faster.

245
00:21:29,549 --> 00:21:31,578
What on earth happened?

246
00:21:32,078 --> 00:21:33,418
I'm fine now.

247
00:21:33,549 --> 00:21:35,078
You don't look fine at all.

248
00:21:36,219 --> 00:21:38,549
Who did this to you? Who is this jerk that hurt you?

249
00:21:39,818 --> 00:21:41,059
Let's go to the hospital first.

250
00:21:45,029 --> 00:21:46,598
The police officer who found the victim...

251
00:21:46,598 --> 00:21:48,769
must accompany her to the hospital and check her medical condition.

252
00:21:49,628 --> 00:21:50,668
You're her guardian.

253
00:21:50,668 --> 00:21:51,868
Why don't I drive all of us to the hospital?

254
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:59,239
You drove here. I'll see you at the hospital.

255
00:22:25,168 --> 00:22:26,199
Let me see.

256
00:22:29,709 --> 00:22:30,838
It stopped bleeding.

257
00:22:35,578 --> 00:22:36,949
What did you bump into?

258
00:22:37,779 --> 00:22:39,878
Do you feel dizzy or dazed?

259
00:22:40,878 --> 00:22:41,878
Any headaches?

260
00:22:42,049 --> 00:22:43,418
Tell me if you feel nauseous...

261
00:22:43,418 --> 00:22:44,989
or if you think you're going to get dizzy.

262
00:22:45,918 --> 00:22:46,959
Okay?

263
00:23:04,222 --> 00:23:07,123
(Jihyang University Hospital)

264
00:23:07,123 --> 00:23:11,063
(General Ward A)

265
00:23:46,103 --> 00:23:47,962
- Could I get some water? - Okay.

266
00:24:03,083 --> 00:24:05,383
She's a victim who just got examined and admitted to the hospital.

267
00:24:05,783 --> 00:24:07,523
Must you interview her now?

268
00:24:09,692 --> 00:24:11,593
I'm not an ordinary victim. I'm a journalist.

269
00:24:13,262 --> 00:24:14,293
Go ahead.

270
00:24:15,593 --> 00:24:17,793
The victim agreed. So please leave the room.

271
00:24:19,502 --> 00:24:21,762
No. I'm her guardian. So I'll stay.

272
00:24:28,343 --> 00:24:30,912
I will feel relieved only once I check your condition.

273
00:24:31,972 --> 00:24:33,212
Let me stay by your side.

274
00:24:50,633 --> 00:24:52,863
Your cell phone was turned off around 10pm yesterday.

275
00:24:53,262 --> 00:24:56,172
Is that when you were abducted by Cha Geum Sae?

276
00:24:57,633 --> 00:24:58,633
Yes.

277
00:24:59,472 --> 00:25:01,273
I lost consciousness, and when I woke up,

278
00:25:03,313 --> 00:25:04,843
I found myself in Cha Eun Sae's office.

279
00:25:06,682 --> 00:25:09,752
Cha Geum Sae threatened me with a knife.

280
00:25:10,652 --> 00:25:12,353
I thought I was going to die there.

281
00:25:13,422 --> 00:25:14,623
I used the wine opener...

282
00:25:16,353 --> 00:25:18,853
to attack Cha Geum Sae and tried to run away.

283
00:25:26,662 --> 00:25:28,002
I can't watch this. Let's stop here.

284
00:25:32,942 --> 00:25:35,402
Ms. Seo, look at me.

285
00:25:41,313 --> 00:25:42,452
You're safe now.

286
00:25:46,722 --> 00:25:48,083
Should we stop here if this is too much?

287
00:26:00,303 --> 00:26:01,303
No.

288
00:26:02,262 --> 00:26:03,333
Let's keep going.

289
00:26:06,672 --> 00:26:09,143
Why did Cha Geum Sae abduct you?

290
00:26:10,712 --> 00:26:12,813
He was certain that I was the one who killed Jin Myung Sook...

291
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:14,742
and Cha Eun Sae.

292
00:26:15,652 --> 00:26:17,113
He wanted me to confess.

293
00:26:22,152 --> 00:26:23,152
Go.

294
00:26:23,492 --> 00:26:24,492
One.

295
00:26:25,353 --> 00:26:26,363
Nice.

296
00:26:40,672 --> 00:26:43,543
Getting updates on something while shooting? It must be urgent.

297
00:26:44,843 --> 00:26:47,012
- Is it about work? - First, let's go ahead and fire.

298
00:26:54,083 --> 00:26:55,553
My goodness.

299
00:26:56,793 --> 00:26:58,593
That's embarrassing.

300
00:27:01,127 --> 00:27:02,157
(Mr. Song)

301
00:27:03,197 --> 00:27:05,568
Cha Geum Sae has been arrested...

302
00:27:05,568 --> 00:27:08,897
for abducting and assaulting my daughter-in-law.

303
00:27:13,137 --> 00:27:15,038
You're too tense,

304
00:27:15,947 --> 00:27:17,107
for your own good.

305
00:27:23,248 --> 00:27:26,258
I heard you had him keep tabs on the housekeeper.

306
00:27:26,857 --> 00:27:28,288
You should just take care of it...

307
00:27:28,288 --> 00:27:30,087
as an embarrassing mishap, don't you think?

308
00:27:31,357 --> 00:27:32,657
Before you lose everything, that is.

309
00:27:37,427 --> 00:27:39,667
The killer was hiding in there when Cha Geum Sae...

310
00:27:39,667 --> 00:27:42,808
left with the bag full of cash, knowing Jin had been stabbed.

311
00:27:43,167 --> 00:27:46,177
And he thought you were the killer.

312
00:27:46,177 --> 00:27:47,177
That's what you mean, right?

313
00:27:48,177 --> 00:27:50,248
- Yes. - Like he said,

314
00:27:50,677 --> 00:27:52,347
it's possible that you were hiding in there...

315
00:27:52,347 --> 00:27:53,718
before you came out and called it in,

316
00:27:54,117 --> 00:27:56,048
pretending to be the first witness?

317
00:27:58,788 --> 00:28:01,187
Are you asking my wife...

318
00:28:01,887 --> 00:28:03,028
if she's the killer?

319
00:28:08,028 --> 00:28:10,798
I thought you dropped your phone again, like the time...

320
00:28:11,228 --> 00:28:12,538
when you found the housekeeper.

321
00:28:15,968 --> 00:28:16,968
Was he...

322
00:28:17,607 --> 00:28:19,377
watching me that night?

323
00:28:21,008 --> 00:28:23,677
I will prove that it wasn't the case.

324
00:28:23,978 --> 00:28:25,008
How?

325
00:28:25,407 --> 00:28:26,818
That day, I was on the phone...

326
00:28:27,818 --> 00:28:30,647
with my informant who gave me the location of a stock scammer...

327
00:28:30,647 --> 00:28:32,587
when I found Ms. Jin Myung Sook.

328
00:28:34,587 --> 00:28:35,657
But I think my informant...

329
00:28:35,988 --> 00:28:38,058
was watching me at that moment.

330
00:28:38,058 --> 00:28:39,498
That informant is Zeus, right?

331
00:28:40,328 --> 00:28:41,597
Do you know who he is?

332
00:28:41,998 --> 00:28:43,097
I must find out,

333
00:28:44,427 --> 00:28:45,468
no matter what.

334
00:28:51,268 --> 00:28:52,538
You can't go on like this.

335
00:28:53,208 --> 00:28:54,437
That's enough.

336
00:29:08,536 --> 00:29:09,876
You must think this world is a joke.

337
00:29:10,606 --> 00:29:12,816
You think you can frame anyone by planting a knife at their home...

338
00:29:13,576 --> 00:29:14,816
and that you can just abduct people...

339
00:29:14,816 --> 00:29:17,215
and threaten them to say what you want to hear.

340
00:29:18,646 --> 00:29:20,556
You have some nerve.

341
00:29:21,386 --> 00:29:23,786
How dare you abduct and threaten someone?

342
00:29:24,485 --> 00:29:28,255
Oh, you didn't just threaten her. You choked her,

343
00:29:30,695 --> 00:29:32,026
which is considered attempted murder.

344
00:29:33,096 --> 00:29:35,665
Were Jin and Cha your doing too? Just like Seo Jung Won?

345
00:29:35,665 --> 00:29:37,306
I...

346
00:29:38,566 --> 00:29:40,606
I did what I did because I knew this would happen, okay?

347
00:29:40,606 --> 00:29:43,175
Jin Myung Sook and my sister. I knew they'd try...

348
00:29:43,175 --> 00:29:45,245
to dump it all on me to destroy me! Do you hear me?

349
00:29:45,376 --> 00:29:47,816
Mr. Cha Geum Sae, the late actress Cha Eun Sae's brother,

350
00:29:47,816 --> 00:29:50,286
has been arrested for abducting and assaulting...

351
00:29:50,286 --> 00:29:52,655
Reporter Seo Jung Won. The police are questioning him at the moment.

352
00:29:52,655 --> 00:29:55,155
Reporter Seo Jung Won is resting to recover...

353
00:29:58,925 --> 00:30:01,495
I'll go home tomorrow and go straight to work.

354
00:30:02,665 --> 00:30:03,866
You don't need to come back here.

355
00:30:04,026 --> 00:30:06,366
You're hurt. You should stay here longer...

356
00:30:19,215 --> 00:30:20,215
Go home.

357
00:30:20,975 --> 00:30:22,175
I want to be alone.

358
00:30:22,175 --> 00:30:23,616
Why do you want to be alone?

359
00:30:25,485 --> 00:30:27,086
You make me uncomfortable.

360
00:30:30,286 --> 00:30:31,826
I understand why you feel that way,

361
00:30:32,396 --> 00:30:35,126
but how do you think I'll feel if I go home alone,

362
00:30:35,665 --> 00:30:37,225
knowing you're in the hospital all by yourself?

363
00:30:39,195 --> 00:30:41,965
I couldn't come to your rescue and can't even stay by your side.

364
00:30:42,235 --> 00:30:44,106
So what am I supposed to do as your husband?

365
00:30:54,546 --> 00:30:56,286
I'll sleep at a hotel nearby.

366
00:30:57,586 --> 00:30:59,015
Call me if you need my help.

367
00:31:15,765 --> 00:31:17,036
Help...

368
00:31:17,036 --> 00:31:19,636
What's this? What's all this money?

369
00:31:20,536 --> 00:31:22,945
Darn it. What do you want me to do?

370
00:31:30,116 --> 00:31:32,556
So, Jin Myung Sook died because you left her there to die.

371
00:31:33,556 --> 00:31:34,985
How was I supposed to know she'd die?

372
00:31:37,925 --> 00:31:40,796
You clearly heard her asking for help!

373
00:31:45,326 --> 00:31:48,066
This was what Seo Jung Won said about the moment she found Jin.

374
00:31:48,596 --> 00:31:51,265
"Her upper body was hanging off the balcony."

375
00:31:52,606 --> 00:31:54,806
You didn't even think to call it in and just ran off,

376
00:31:55,576 --> 00:31:57,076
so she got herself up with all her might...

377
00:31:57,076 --> 00:31:58,546
and stood there to call for help...

378
00:31:58,546 --> 00:32:01,445
and died eventually. She must've really wanted to live.

379
00:32:07,985 --> 00:32:10,425
So, the same person killed Jin Myung Sook and Cha Eun Sae.

380
00:32:10,425 --> 00:32:12,896
Who told you that? Was it Song Hyo Sung or Mo Hyung Taek?

381
00:32:15,155 --> 00:32:17,626
Who ordered you to keep tabs on Jin Myung Sook?

382
00:32:17,626 --> 00:32:18,725
It was Mo Hyung Taek, right?

383
00:32:20,235 --> 00:32:21,235
He knew...

384
00:32:21,596 --> 00:32:24,836
all about you framing Kim Min Chul, didn't he?

385
00:32:25,776 --> 00:32:28,705
Was it your idea? Or did Mo Hyung Taek tell you to do it?

386
00:32:30,546 --> 00:32:31,806
I...

387
00:32:52,425 --> 00:32:53,665
If you feel...

388
00:32:55,536 --> 00:32:57,606
even just an ounce of guilt as a human being,

389
00:32:59,306 --> 00:33:00,336
tell me the truth.

390
00:33:38,946 --> 00:33:42,115
I was going to ask you for it.

391
00:33:44,345 --> 00:33:45,486
You must've been offended.

392
00:33:46,115 --> 00:33:48,115
- Why? - You know, earlier in the day,

393
00:33:48,756 --> 00:33:51,555
when I asked you if you were hiding in Jin Myung Sook's home.

394
00:33:53,555 --> 00:33:55,396
I would've asked the same question too.

395
00:33:57,225 --> 00:33:58,665
The day Jin Myung Sook was found dead,

396
00:33:59,165 --> 00:34:00,696
you told me while being questioned...

397
00:34:01,196 --> 00:34:03,865
that you found her while trying to track down Lee Yi Jin...

398
00:34:03,865 --> 00:34:05,665
after receiving information about his location.

399
00:34:06,535 --> 00:34:08,336
According to some tip-offs we received recently,

400
00:34:08,836 --> 00:34:10,676
Lee Yi Jin stowed away at the end of August.

401
00:34:11,745 --> 00:34:14,776
You were told he was pinged in Owol-dong on September 2.

402
00:34:15,316 --> 00:34:16,415
It was a lie.

403
00:34:19,785 --> 00:34:22,515
So, I was led there to see Jin Myung Sook...

404
00:34:22,825 --> 00:34:23,955
on purpose.

405
00:34:24,856 --> 00:34:27,356
And how I was given the report on the Bongto plant case too.

406
00:34:27,796 --> 00:34:28,825
They're both...

407
00:34:30,796 --> 00:34:32,426
connected to Mo Hyung Taek.

408
00:34:32,865 --> 00:34:35,236
How Cha Geum Sae framed Kim Min Chul too.

409
00:34:36,135 --> 00:34:37,836
Mr. Song knew all about it.

410
00:34:38,665 --> 00:34:41,176
And Mr. Song was the one who told him to keep tabs on Jin.

411
00:34:41,176 --> 00:34:42,805
Cha Geum Sae confessed to everything.

412
00:34:43,406 --> 00:34:44,475
And the orders...

413
00:34:45,345 --> 00:34:46,716
all came from Mo Hyung Taek?

414
00:34:46,716 --> 00:34:47,915
If you want to know the truth,

415
00:34:49,115 --> 00:34:50,845
- write an article about it. - Can I do that?

416
00:34:50,845 --> 00:34:51,946
You must do it,

417
00:34:52,316 --> 00:34:54,986
to officially summon a party leader for an interview.

418
00:35:00,256 --> 00:35:02,356
Anyway, go back to sleep.

419
00:35:02,356 --> 00:35:03,796
I woke you up.

420
00:35:04,796 --> 00:35:06,336
No, I woke up because I was hungry.

421
00:35:08,135 --> 00:35:09,265
What do you feel like eating?

422
00:35:17,546 --> 00:35:19,676
You should have porridge. An ice pop, seriously?

423
00:35:19,915 --> 00:35:20,946
Are you a kid?

424
00:35:23,245 --> 00:35:25,415
My dad always said the same thing too.

425
00:35:30,185 --> 00:35:31,626
I miss my dad.

426
00:35:37,466 --> 00:35:39,196
Ever since Cha Eun Sae died,

427
00:35:40,135 --> 00:35:41,796
everything's been weird, as if it's all a dream.

428
00:35:42,966 --> 00:35:44,836
From how my husband betrayed me...

429
00:35:44,836 --> 00:35:46,776
and how I'm running around trying to find the culprit...

430
00:35:48,336 --> 00:35:49,946
to how we met again.

431
00:36:01,615 --> 00:36:02,756
I should stop eating this.

432
00:36:05,626 --> 00:36:07,626
Yes, it's not good to eat cold stuff when you're not feeling well.

433
00:36:16,106 --> 00:36:17,665
See? Your hand is so cold.

434
00:36:23,745 --> 00:36:24,805
It's chilly.

435
00:37:02,245 --> 00:37:03,546
It all feels like my fault.

436
00:37:05,986 --> 00:37:07,716
When you left to see Cha Geum Sae,

437
00:37:09,426 --> 00:37:10,856
I should've stopped you.

438
00:37:12,926 --> 00:37:16,325
If something worse had happened, I'd have...

439
00:37:24,135 --> 00:37:27,236
You could've gotten badly hurt because of me.

440
00:37:35,946 --> 00:37:37,015
This isn't working.

441
00:37:38,586 --> 00:37:41,415
I was warned not to feel any emotions for you.

442
00:37:44,426 --> 00:37:45,825
I can't do that.

443
00:37:48,055 --> 00:37:49,595
Now that we've met again,

444
00:37:50,865 --> 00:37:52,495
I'll do as my heart says.

445
00:37:57,165 --> 00:37:58,566
I must take it all the way.

446
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:08,929
(Jihyang University Hospital)

447
00:38:24,679 --> 00:38:25,978
You're leaving already?

448
00:38:27,049 --> 00:38:28,149
Why are you here?

449
00:38:28,788 --> 00:38:31,958
My patient got admitted. Of course, I should visit.

450
00:38:32,288 --> 00:38:33,828
I have nothing else to say to you.

451
00:38:33,828 --> 00:38:36,429
But I do. And I have something to show you too.

452
00:38:50,509 --> 00:38:53,848
You know I tape my consultations, so I'd like to ask you directly.

453
00:38:55,179 --> 00:38:56,279
What's this blood?

454
00:39:00,388 --> 00:39:02,188
You went to Unit 1401 that day, didn't you?

455
00:39:03,458 --> 00:39:04,589
Did you kill Cha Eun Sae,

456
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:07,029
then talk to me to create an alibi?

457
00:39:10,259 --> 00:39:11,859
Do you really think so?

458
00:39:11,859 --> 00:39:12,899
Yes.

459
00:39:13,429 --> 00:39:15,368
I'm convinced you're the culprit.

460
00:39:17,098 --> 00:39:20,668
If we test the blood on the shirt, we'll know the truth.

461
00:39:20,969 --> 00:39:22,509
It shows up even after it's washed.

462
00:39:24,279 --> 00:39:26,339
If the shirt you wore that day is gone,

463
00:39:27,248 --> 00:39:28,808
that would be even more suspicious.

464
00:39:40,429 --> 00:39:41,958
I took care of that shirt.

465
00:39:43,259 --> 00:39:45,199
I threw it away in case Jung Won got in trouble.

466
00:39:47,199 --> 00:39:48,529
She'd had a nosebleed.

467
00:39:48,929 --> 00:39:50,839
I doubted her at one time for no reason.

468
00:39:51,598 --> 00:39:52,598
Sorry about that.

469
00:39:58,909 --> 00:40:00,748
How silly of you.

470
00:40:01,279 --> 00:40:03,518
Do you think that will erase the fact that your wife's guilty?

471
00:40:03,518 --> 00:40:04,949
- Listen. - Woo Jae.

472
00:40:06,248 --> 00:40:08,518
It's a lie that I briefly liked him in school.

473
00:40:08,918 --> 00:40:10,089
I still like him.

474
00:40:10,458 --> 00:40:13,529
I think of him, miss him, and want him all the time.

475
00:40:15,188 --> 00:40:17,259
Hey. Are you out of your mind?

476
00:40:17,629 --> 00:40:18,759
I told you.

477
00:40:18,859 --> 00:40:20,969
I'm worried and afraid you live with a murderer.

478
00:40:24,569 --> 00:40:25,868
I realized as we talked...

479
00:40:26,469 --> 00:40:29,409
just how unstable, volatile, and dangerous you were.

480
00:40:30,239 --> 00:40:32,009
Enough to kill someone.

481
00:40:34,379 --> 00:40:37,049
The photo of your bloodied sleeve and my opinion as a doctor.

482
00:40:38,149 --> 00:40:39,779
I'll submit it to Detective Kim Tae Heon.

483
00:40:40,788 --> 00:40:42,418
That's how I'll save Woo Jae.

484
00:40:45,288 --> 00:40:46,558
Since we're all here,

485
00:40:47,188 --> 00:40:48,629
why not invite the detective?

486
00:40:53,969 --> 00:40:55,799
Do you want to lose your doctor's license?

487
00:40:56,668 --> 00:40:58,339
Shall I tell the detective first?

488
00:40:58,469 --> 00:41:00,138
That I asked you to get me propofol,

489
00:41:00,138 --> 00:41:02,138
and you prescribed it to me illegally.

490
00:41:09,879 --> 00:41:11,149
I quit after I met you.

491
00:41:12,049 --> 00:41:13,589
And got hooked again after meeting Eun Sae.

492
00:41:13,589 --> 00:41:16,188
I'm trying really hard to stay off it now.

493
00:41:18,518 --> 00:41:20,728
Now that Jung Won knows I was addicted,

494
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:24,199
you have no more weakness to wield over me, do you?

495
00:41:25,058 --> 00:41:27,969
If you want to report Jung Won at the risk of losing everything,

496
00:41:27,969 --> 00:41:29,199
go ahead.

497
00:41:35,168 --> 00:41:36,739
Thanks for the visit.

498
00:41:38,339 --> 00:41:39,339
Goodbye.

499
00:41:56,998 --> 00:41:58,199
When I was studying abroad,

500
00:41:59,899 --> 00:42:02,469
I got hooked when sleeping pills stopped working for me.

501
00:42:03,268 --> 00:42:04,739
There was no turning back.

502
00:42:06,038 --> 00:42:09,038
I did all sorts of things to get myself clean but failed.

503
00:42:10,179 --> 00:42:12,078
So I went to the sea determined to kill myself.

504
00:42:15,149 --> 00:42:16,248
That's when we met.

505
00:42:28,558 --> 00:42:30,458
It's okay to look at the sea as you walk,

506
00:42:30,799 --> 00:42:33,828
but it's dangerous to stare at it standing still.

507
00:42:44,839 --> 00:42:47,649
Yes, I'm reporter Seo Jung Won from "Nothing Uncovered."

508
00:42:48,348 --> 00:42:49,578
What were you thinking about...

509
00:42:50,478 --> 00:42:52,179
that you didn't notice your shoes were wet?

510
00:43:00,328 --> 00:43:03,458
I was thinking it would be nice if someone...

511
00:43:04,399 --> 00:43:05,498
would talk to me.

512
00:43:12,038 --> 00:43:14,868
I didn't miss the drugs at all when I was with you that day.

513
00:43:17,109 --> 00:43:18,478
When just the day before,

514
00:43:19,879 --> 00:43:21,049
I hadn't wanted to live.

515
00:43:24,779 --> 00:43:27,489
That's when I realized that not wanting to live...

516
00:43:28,989 --> 00:43:31,989
actually meant that I wanted to live really well.

517
00:43:34,489 --> 00:43:37,328
That I wanted to spend the rest of my life with this woman.

518
00:43:40,998 --> 00:43:43,368
I managed to break free after I met you.

519
00:43:43,368 --> 00:43:44,739
You saved me.

520
00:43:45,739 --> 00:43:47,138
Why couldn't you sleep...

521
00:43:50,239 --> 00:43:51,839
even though you took sleeping pills?

522
00:43:56,819 --> 00:43:58,649
A girl I liked died in an accident.

523
00:44:01,949 --> 00:44:03,018
What accident?

524
00:44:08,029 --> 00:44:09,429
I don't want to talk about it.

525
00:44:12,699 --> 00:44:13,728
Let's go home.

526
00:44:27,149 --> 00:44:29,578
Jung Won. I'll zip it up for you.

527
00:44:40,429 --> 00:44:42,629
My dear beloved Reporter Seo, welcome home.

528
00:44:42,629 --> 00:44:44,699
(Two months ago)

529
00:44:44,998 --> 00:44:46,359
Did you watch my show today?

530
00:44:46,828 --> 00:44:47,929
Of course, I did.

531
00:44:50,498 --> 00:44:51,598
The novelist...

532
00:44:52,239 --> 00:44:54,638
Ko Dae Chul who violated his students.

533
00:44:55,638 --> 00:44:57,839
I exposed him on my show.

534
00:44:59,409 --> 00:45:00,578
You did great.

535
00:45:03,819 --> 00:45:07,188
Did I really do great when he helped you get published?

536
00:45:08,018 --> 00:45:10,759
This is why I love you.

537
00:45:10,759 --> 00:45:12,589
You don't weigh your options or hesitate.

538
00:45:17,199 --> 00:45:18,828
- What is it? - Something stings.

539
00:45:18,828 --> 00:45:20,768
- Is it your shoulder? - No, the necklace.

540
00:45:20,768 --> 00:45:22,368
- My hair. - Oh, hang on.

541
00:45:22,368 --> 00:45:23,598
It must've gotten tangled up.

542
00:45:27,339 --> 00:45:28,339
It's off.

543
00:45:29,609 --> 00:45:30,638
It's done.

544
00:45:39,951 --> 00:45:41,292
(Chief Kang In Han)

545
00:45:45,091 --> 00:45:46,261
After your article came out,

546
00:45:46,261 --> 00:45:48,301
Mo Hyung Taek called an emergency press conference.

547
00:45:48,301 --> 00:45:49,301
It's on TV now.

548
00:45:50,070 --> 00:45:52,269
(National Assembly)

549
00:45:52,289 --> 00:45:53,289
Regarding me...

550
00:45:54,658 --> 00:45:56,218
and the late Cha Eun Sae,

551
00:45:57,528 --> 00:46:00,298
I'm well aware of the rumor that I was her sponsor.

552
00:46:01,399 --> 00:46:02,399
It's true that...

553
00:46:03,128 --> 00:46:05,428
I did sponsor Cha Eun Sae.

554
00:46:08,499 --> 00:46:11,269
When I was a prosecutor, each time I moved to a new region,

555
00:46:11,508 --> 00:46:13,878
I asked for a list of teens from broken families...

556
00:46:14,108 --> 00:46:15,278
and I sponsored them.

557
00:46:16,309 --> 00:46:18,349
Cha Eun Sae was one of them.

558
00:46:22,479 --> 00:46:24,019
(Assemblyman Mo, "I sponsored the late Cha.")

559
00:46:25,088 --> 00:46:28,258
Since she was 15 and until she graduated from high school,

560
00:46:29,419 --> 00:46:31,459
I covered her tuition and living expenses.

561
00:46:32,189 --> 00:46:33,189
As evidence,

562
00:46:33,928 --> 00:46:36,829
I will disclose the handwritten letters...

563
00:46:37,329 --> 00:46:39,099
Cha Eun Sae sent me on Parents' Day.

564
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:40,791
- Really? - Handwritten letters?

565
00:46:40,791 --> 00:46:42,620
So he just helped her financially?

(National Assembly of South Korea)

567
00:46:44,791 --> 00:46:48,160
Whether as a prosecutor or now as a politician,

568
00:46:48,231 --> 00:46:49,660
I have always held the same goal.

569
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:51,200
("Good Deed Doer Mo Hyung Taek")

570
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,071
I wanted to give the privileges...

571
00:46:53,071 --> 00:46:55,140
I had received from society back to the people.

572
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:57,010
Being firmly committed to my goal...

573
00:46:57,010 --> 00:46:59,111
helped me endure all kinds of rumors...

574
00:46:59,111 --> 00:47:00,680
and attacks.

575
00:47:02,010 --> 00:47:05,410
In the upcoming regional election,

576
00:47:05,811 --> 00:47:08,550
I plan to run for governor in Gangwon Province.

577
00:47:09,350 --> 00:47:10,751
I will allow myself...

578
00:47:11,350 --> 00:47:12,921
to be put to the test once again.

579
00:47:16,521 --> 00:47:19,591
This is driving me crazy. Even Mo Hyung Taek has an alibi.

580
00:47:20,091 --> 00:47:21,930
Then it means everyone on our suspect list...

581
00:47:21,930 --> 00:47:23,870
has an alibi.

582
00:47:25,901 --> 00:47:27,441
Among the people related to this case,

583
00:47:27,441 --> 00:47:29,441
whose alibi haven't we confirmed?

584
00:47:30,370 --> 00:47:31,571
Mo Soo Rin's alibi.

585
00:47:32,910 --> 00:47:34,080
(The man delivering Jin Myung Sook's cash donation)

586
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:35,341
Oh, right.

587
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:37,651
Remember the organization with the factory fire's victims?

588
00:47:37,651 --> 00:47:40,050
A man supposedly delivered Jin's cash donation in her place.

589
00:47:40,050 --> 00:47:42,950
I got his composite sketch. I'll send it over to you now.

(Yoo Yoon Young)

593
00:48:18,291 --> 00:48:19,291
It's me.

594
00:48:19,691 --> 00:48:21,191
I couldn't stop feeling bad...

595
00:48:22,021 --> 00:48:23,561
from the way we said goodbye earlier.

596
00:48:25,231 --> 00:48:26,631
Are you free tonight?

597
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:32,939
She's driving me crazy.

598
00:48:32,939 --> 00:48:34,709
I told you I was coming to see you in the hospital after work.

599
00:48:34,709 --> 00:48:36,069
What are you doing here?

600
00:48:36,069 --> 00:48:37,080
Gosh. Seriously.

601
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:38,609
I told you to rest up since you were in the hospital.

602
00:48:38,609 --> 00:48:40,580
You really might pass out if you don't rest.

603
00:48:40,580 --> 00:48:42,350
If I stop working with the excuse of going on a break,

604
00:48:42,350 --> 00:48:44,120
I might pass out for real.

605
00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:45,319
I can't let that happen.

606
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:47,720
After reading your exclusive report, I thought...

607
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:50,919
you were going to pick Mo Hyung Taek as your target for the next episode.

608
00:48:50,919 --> 00:48:53,160
What a surprising turn of events. You and Mo Hyung Taek...

609
00:48:53,730 --> 00:48:55,390
must've been each other's archenemies in previous lives.

610
00:48:55,390 --> 00:48:56,459
Gosh.

611
00:48:56,830 --> 00:48:58,560
If he were sponsoring Cha Eun Sae for solicitation,

612
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:00,500
I would've been 100 percent sure that he was the culprit.

613
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:03,029
Mo Hyung Taek has an alibi for the day...

614
00:49:03,029 --> 00:49:04,370
- of Cha Eun Sae's murder. - What?

615
00:49:04,370 --> 00:49:05,370
Seriously?

616
00:49:07,339 --> 00:49:09,370
In my opinion, your promise to expose...

617
00:49:09,370 --> 00:49:12,279
the real killer on our show within a month was impossible.

618
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:13,680
You should take care of your health first.

619
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:15,180
You can't even think straight...

620
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:16,250
in your condition.

621
00:49:17,549 --> 00:49:18,980
- Where's the newbie? - The newbie?

622
00:49:19,750 --> 00:49:21,049
He's taking a sick day which is unusual.

623
00:49:21,790 --> 00:49:23,620
Is he feeling sick because you're not well?

624
00:49:30,399 --> 00:49:32,259
I'm on the outdoor terrace of the TV station.

625
00:49:32,259 --> 00:49:33,430
Spare me a moment.

626
00:49:40,910 --> 00:49:44,339
Doesn't the composite sketch match your newbie reporter?

627
00:49:46,540 --> 00:49:47,850
I think so.

628
00:49:48,750 --> 00:49:49,850
Where did this sketch come from?

629
00:49:49,850 --> 00:49:51,919
Jin Myung Sook withdrew cash every month...

630
00:49:52,450 --> 00:49:54,790
and donated it to the victims' organization of the factory fire.

631
00:49:55,950 --> 00:49:57,620
He delivered the money in her place.

632
00:49:58,189 --> 00:50:00,689
It proves that he was very close to Jin Myung Sook.

633
00:50:02,189 --> 00:50:03,930
Is he in the office right now?

634
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:06,930
No. He's taking a sick day today.

635
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:10,230
If you also thought he resembled the newbie reporter,

636
00:50:10,230 --> 00:50:11,770
I was going to question him.

637
00:50:16,509 --> 00:50:17,580
What is it?

638
00:50:18,439 --> 00:50:20,910
My chief called for a team meeting at the station.

639
00:50:21,450 --> 00:50:23,480
He's probably going to nag us to catch the killer.

640
00:50:29,850 --> 00:50:31,259
I'll drop you off.

641
00:50:31,759 --> 00:50:34,330
Please go home and rest up.

642
00:50:34,330 --> 00:50:36,660
I'm not done talking to my team yet.

643
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:37,899
I'll go home soon.

644
00:50:39,299 --> 00:50:41,370
I'll call you to check as soon as my meeting is over.

645
00:50:45,299 --> 00:50:46,339
Bye.

646
00:51:02,890 --> 00:51:06,720
Ae Na. Find Ba Reun's home address and send it to me.

647
00:51:12,259 --> 00:51:13,870
There's a house in a place like this?

648
00:51:40,959 --> 00:51:43,060
Ba Reun. It's me.

649
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:45,100
Are you inside?

650
00:52:38,477 --> 00:52:39,239
(Arson Case)

651
00:52:39,263 --> 00:52:40,263
(My husband, Park Jin Soo, isn't an arsonist.)

652
00:52:40,263 --> 00:52:41,328
(Prosecutor Mo Hyung Taek...)

653
00:52:58,752 --> 00:53:00,412
(This is the location of Detective Kim Tae Heon.)

654
00:53:02,950 --> 00:53:04,350
(Can you talk?)

655
00:53:10,491 --> 00:53:14,031
(This is the location of Detective Kim Tae Heon.)

656
00:53:33,450 --> 00:53:34,450
It was you?

657
00:53:35,881 --> 00:53:38,991
Zeus was you?

658
00:53:41,421 --> 00:53:42,421
Lee Ba Reun.

659
00:54:09,481 --> 00:54:10,620
What an honor this is.

660
00:54:11,350 --> 00:54:13,821
I don't have anything on you anymore.

661
00:54:13,821 --> 00:54:15,361
But you're spending time with me.

662
00:54:29,801 --> 00:54:30,870
Yoon Young.

663
00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:35,481
Why do you like me?

664
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:43,481
I have never been kind to you.

665
00:54:43,921 --> 00:54:45,651
I always pushed you away.

666
00:54:45,991 --> 00:54:47,051
Don't you hate me?

667
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:50,261
Always.

668
00:54:51,131 --> 00:54:52,631
There hasn't been a moment when I didn't hate you.

669
00:54:53,131 --> 00:54:54,131
But the problem is...

670
00:54:56,231 --> 00:54:57,830
I never stopped liking you.

671
00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:03,000
You're quite a determined man.

672
00:55:03,571 --> 00:55:06,441
You stopped medicating yourself when you began dating Seo Jung Won.

673
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:09,981
I kept throwing myself on you, but you never crossed the line.

674
00:55:12,310 --> 00:55:14,220
Am I not attractive as a woman?

675
00:55:15,750 --> 00:55:18,491
You could have given in at least once, couldn't you?

676
00:55:18,491 --> 00:55:21,591
Giving false hope is the most painful act...

677
00:55:21,921 --> 00:55:23,091
one can do to another.

678
00:55:24,531 --> 00:55:26,890
I had no intention of dating you, so I thought giving in...

679
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:30,500
to your advances wasn't a nice thing to do to a friend.

680
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:34,941
Who cares about being nice?

681
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:37,171
So what if it comes with a bit of pain?

682
00:55:37,410 --> 00:55:38,970
Love and pain always go hand in hand.

683
00:55:40,310 --> 00:55:42,441
After all, you're hurting now because you love your wife.

684
00:55:50,850 --> 00:55:52,051
As for me,

685
00:55:52,491 --> 00:55:55,160
you've never been mine. So naturally, I'm still hung up on you.

686
00:55:56,261 --> 00:55:58,691
But why are you so obsessed with your wife?

687
00:56:04,731 --> 00:56:06,000
I'm afraid she'd leave me.

688
00:56:08,140 --> 00:56:09,200
That she might...

689
00:56:11,310 --> 00:56:12,441
abandon me.

690
00:56:21,151 --> 00:56:22,450
Between never making something yours...

691
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:25,591
and forever losing what was once yours,

692
00:56:27,151 --> 00:56:29,261
what do you think would drive you more insane?

693
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:34,160
Neither of us...

694
00:56:35,861 --> 00:56:37,430
knows how to love properly.

695
00:56:40,470 --> 00:56:41,540
I...

696
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:44,310
want you to be lonelier...

697
00:56:45,741 --> 00:56:47,241
and more miserable.

698
00:56:49,511 --> 00:56:50,680
I hope the days you shed tears...

699
00:56:51,611 --> 00:56:53,450
outnumber the days you smile...

700
00:56:57,220 --> 00:56:58,220
so that...

701
00:57:00,450 --> 00:57:02,520
you'll keep coming to me.

702

703

(Recents)

705
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:41,560
(You and Me, White)

706
00:58:55,241 --> 00:58:56,341
(Seo Jung Won)

707
00:59:29,241 --> 00:59:30,640
It was because of me.

708
00:59:32,111 --> 00:59:33,540
It was all because of me.

709
00:59:35,810 --> 00:59:37,981
That's why you set Jung Won up.

710
01:01:03,301 --> 01:01:04,830
Hello, Detective Kim.

711
01:01:14,341 --> 01:01:16,040
You must be wondering why I'm here.

712
01:01:20,180 --> 01:01:21,450
I'm here because of Ms. Seo Jung Won.

713
01:02:19,011 --> 01:02:21,981
(Nothing Uncovered)

714
01:02:22,481 --> 01:02:24,910
She left your necklace at the scene...

715
01:02:24,910 --> 01:02:26,981
but has a confirmed alibi. That means...

716
01:02:26,981 --> 01:02:29,450
She either has an accomplice or hired someone to kill her.

717
01:02:29,651 --> 01:02:31,450
You felt insecure because I never liked you back,

718
01:02:31,450 --> 01:02:32,821
so you committed murder.

719
01:02:32,821 --> 01:02:34,191
I didn't know you were such a monster.

720
01:02:34,191 --> 01:02:36,160
Do you think you have the right to say such a thing?

721
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:39,491
Seriously, do not contact or meet Reporter Seo for the time being.

722
01:02:39,761 --> 01:02:40,761
Are you out of your mind?

723
01:02:40,761 --> 01:02:42,600
She asked me not to have any feelings for her,

724
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:43,600
but I couldn't do that.

725
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:44,870
Jung Won did nothing wrong.

726
01:02:44,870 --> 01:02:45,901
Don't cry.

727
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:48,370
It was my fault that the article got published.

728
01:02:48,700 --> 01:02:51,211
Don't worry. I'll protect you.

729
01:02:51,211 --> 01:02:53,111
Yoo Yoon Young gave me some pictures yesterday.

730
01:02:53,111 --> 01:02:55,511
They were photos of Jung Won next to Cha Eun Sae's dead body.

731
01:02:55,511 --> 01:02:57,881
That said, help me.

732
01:02:57,910 --> 01:03:00,281
You're going to arrest me for murdering Cha Eun Sae?

733
01:03:00,281 --> 01:03:02,551
I'll handle them. Just don't get hurt.

734
01:03:02,781 --> 01:03:04,850
Let's stay like this for just a minute.
