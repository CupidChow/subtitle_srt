I got my hands on some information about the truck driver's mother.

8
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:32,121
I called the phone number to check.

9
00:00:32,661 --> 00:00:34,790
I told her I was a reporter. She wants to meet right away...

10
00:00:34,791 --> 00:00:36,390
as if she wants to prove her son's innocence or something.

11

Oh, yes.

14
00:00:44,901 --> 00:00:47,541

Hello, I am Reporter Seo Jung Won.

17
00:01:03,591 --> 00:01:05,990
You're Mr. Kim Seok Jun's mother, right?

18
00:01:09,191 --> 00:01:10,490
The crazy thing is...

19
00:01:12,531 --> 00:01:14,171
The day I finished my chemotherapy,

20
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:17,471
I received a call that my son died.

21
00:01:19,701 --> 00:01:21,111
It was ten years ago,

22
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:23,740
but it feels like yesterday.

23
00:01:24,941 --> 00:01:26,680
On December 24, 2009,

24
00:01:27,411 --> 00:01:28,980
your son caused a collision.

25
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:32,051
It was concluded that he dozed off while driving,

26
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:34,751
but my father, who was a reporter at the time,

27
00:01:36,051 --> 00:01:38,021
suspected that it might not have been a simple accident.

28
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:39,361
Someone was behind it.

29
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:42,260
Someone ordered my innocent son to do it.

30
00:01:42,361 --> 00:01:44,301
Is that what your son said?

31
00:01:44,861 --> 00:01:47,600
He denied it, but he can't fool his mother.

32
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:52,201
That time, he paid my overdue hospital bills at once...

33
00:01:52,641 --> 00:01:55,510
but couldn't even tell me who lent him the money.

34
00:01:59,111 --> 00:02:00,311
May I take a look?

35
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:09,750
Do you know if your son met someone often at the time?

36
00:02:09,891 --> 00:02:12,120
Or did he have someone visit him often at home?

37
00:02:13,321 --> 00:02:15,391
Well, I do recall seeing him...

38
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:18,930
meet some man in the parking lot in front of our place a few times.

39
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:20,301
Did you see that man's face?

40
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,900
I saw them from the balcony.

50
00:03:35,273 --> 00:03:37,604
The real culprit I've been hoping to run into, even just once.

51
00:03:38,544 --> 00:03:40,074
He was right in front of me.

52
00:03:41,074 --> 00:03:42,114
How...

53
00:03:42,914 --> 00:03:44,074
How is this possible?

54
00:03:51,553 --> 00:03:53,984
I'll give you one last chance, so turn yourself in.

55
00:03:54,084 --> 00:03:55,253
Please, do it for me.

56
00:03:56,623 --> 00:03:59,622
Turn in the knife, and let's go to the precinct together. Please.

57

I guarantee you that you'll regret this later.

58
00:04:07,303 --> 00:04:08,834
I knew it'd be useless,

59
00:04:11,743 --> 00:04:14,104
but I was hopeful for a moment.

60

66
00:06:19,934 --> 00:06:21,434

Secretary Gong...

100
00:10:51,804 --> 00:10:53,274
killed my dad.

You know that, don't you?

104
00:11:02,914 --> 00:11:05,883
Secretary Gong arranged that too.

105
00:11:07,554 --> 00:11:10,623
At the time, the factory burned down completely,

106
00:11:10,853 --> 00:11:12,793
and your plans to build Mujin Resort...

107
00:11:12,794 --> 00:11:14,194
sailed right ahead.

108
00:11:14,524 --> 00:11:18,304
My dad was looking into the corrupt business deals.

109
00:11:21,733 --> 00:11:23,503
Father, were you the one behind it?

110
00:11:25,044 --> 00:11:27,473
I ordered the truck accident?

111
00:11:27,904 --> 00:11:29,213
My father too.

112
00:11:31,444 --> 00:11:33,483
Now that I know Secretary Gong was behind it,

113
00:11:33,613 --> 00:11:36,353
I have no time or reason to stall.

114
00:11:37,314 --> 00:11:40,684
Gong Joon Ho wasn't my secretary in 2009.

115
00:11:40,954 --> 00:11:42,054
To be exact,

116
00:11:42,424 --> 00:11:44,454
I didn't know him at the time.

117
00:11:45,294 --> 00:11:47,893
He wasn't even stationed at Mueon Police Station,

118
00:11:48,064 --> 00:11:50,492
and he joined Mujin Group...

119
00:11:50,493 --> 00:11:52,434
after the resort was complete.

120
00:11:54,704 --> 00:11:57,534
The point is, Mo Hyung Taek was the one...

121
00:11:58,343 --> 00:11:59,444
who introduced him to me.

122
00:12:01,513 --> 00:12:04,074
Secretary Gong worked for Mo Hyung Taek.

123
00:12:05,784 --> 00:12:08,284
I have men looking for him.

124
00:12:08,753 --> 00:12:10,013

00:12:11,554 --> 00:12:13,223

126
00:12:15,123 --> 00:12:16,853
For your father's sake.

127
00:12:27,963 --> 00:12:31,074
I don't feel well. I'll head in first.

128
00:12:44,784 --> 00:12:46,054
I'll keep in mind...

129
00:12:48,024 --> 00:12:49,424
what you said, Father.

130
00:13:21,253 --> 00:13:22,294
It's okay.

131
00:13:23,123 --> 00:13:24,424
Whatever the truth is,

132
00:13:25,263 --> 00:13:28,564

he'd take the fall for everything you did if he got caught.

Sir. Are you all right?

142
00:14:57,084 --> 00:15:00,383
You ordered him to cause the accident too, didn't you?

143
00:15:09,763 --> 00:15:11,334
Father, when I'm your age,

144
00:15:12,003 --> 00:15:14,664
I'll be a monster too, right?

145
00:15:16,434 --> 00:15:17,534
Maybe not.

146
00:15:18,003 --> 00:15:19,373
Maybe I'll be even worse.

147
00:15:24,113 --> 00:15:25,284
Should my child...

148
00:15:26,314 --> 00:15:27,643
have a dad like me...

149
00:15:28,983 --> 00:15:30,814
and a grandfather like you?

150
00:15:31,853 --> 00:15:33,983
Should they have such people around?

151
00:15:40,324 --> 00:15:42,463
In this world, it's one or the other.

152
00:15:43,294 --> 00:15:45,103
You stomp over others, or you get stomped on.

153
00:15:46,603 --> 00:15:49,404
Do you want your child to be in the latter category?

started 4 hours ago at 6am...

and will continue until 6pm.

157
00:16:06,554 --> 00:16:09,553
So far, 12.2 percent of the population voted.

158
00:16:09,554 --> 00:16:12,392
This year, 23.14 percent voted early,

159
00:16:12,393 --> 00:16:13,962
and that's the highest percentage...

160

- Why did you pick up? - You see...

168
00:18:05,269 --> 00:18:07,238
Gosh, that fool.

169
00:18:07,643 --> 00:18:08,853
I told him not to tell you.

170
00:18:18,692 --> 00:18:19,962
They said the surgery went well.

171
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:23,132
Considering how long I've been a cop,

172
00:18:23,133 --> 00:18:25,538
it's odd a life-threatening incident like this didn't happen sooner.

Why are you being like this? You're worrying me.

174

You are worried about me now?

175
00:18:37,242 --> 00:18:39,113
If I lose you too, then I really...

176
00:18:45,982 --> 00:18:47,853
I can handle not having you by my side,

177

without you.

180
00:18:57,962 --> 00:18:59,303
That, I can't handle.

181
00:19:05,103 --> 00:19:06,472
So you'd better not die, really.

182
00:19:12,613 --> 00:19:13,982
We all die in the end.

00:19:15,212 --> 00:19:16,282
Just don't...

184
00:19:17,682 --> 00:19:19,222
die before I do.

185
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:22,422
I'm not asking you for a favor. It's a threat.

186
00:19:23,252 --> 00:19:24,252
Never...

187
00:19:26,293 --> 00:19:27,722
forget what I said. Always remember it.

188
00:19:31,863 --> 00:19:33,133
You know, they say...

189
00:19:35,772 --> 00:19:37,603
when you're faced with a life-or-death situation,

190
00:19:39,702 --> 00:19:42,472
you think of the person you cherish the most.

191
00:19:47,313 --> 00:19:48,883
Right before I passed out,

192
00:19:51,482 --> 00:19:53,482
you were all I thought about.

193
00:19:57,153 --> 00:20:00,722
I'll never leave you.

194
00:20:04,732 --> 00:20:05,932
I promise.

195
00:20:13,772 --> 00:20:14,843
Don't cry.

196
00:20:44,672 --> 00:20:47,242
When and how did you find out that Gong Joon Ho...

197
00:20:47,672 --> 00:20:48,942
was the killer?

198
00:20:51,012 --> 00:20:53,643
When you showed me the man dressed in black in the footage.

199
00:20:55,883 --> 00:20:58,722
I remembered Gong Joon Ho's knife with the tornado symbol on it.

200
00:20:58,883 --> 00:21:00,323
So, that was when you started suspecting him?

201
00:21:01,752 --> 00:21:02,823
I'm sorry.

202
00:21:03,452 --> 00:21:04,863
I thought telling you recklessly...

203
00:21:05,623 --> 00:21:08,232
could put you in danger, so I couldn't tell you.

204
00:21:11,133 --> 00:21:12,163
I...

205
00:21:13,363 --> 00:21:15,373
regained the memories of the day my dad died.

206
00:21:16,103 --> 00:21:18,073
I told you that I saw the killer.

207
00:21:18,643 --> 00:21:19,803
I'm sure it was Gong Joon Ho.

208
00:21:21,972 --> 00:21:24,742
What if he already stowed away or something?

209
00:21:25,383 --> 00:21:27,043
Shouldn't you put out an APB on him right away?

210
00:21:28,252 --> 00:21:29,752
When he stabbed me,

211
00:21:30,913 --> 00:21:33,653
I stabbed him in the thigh too, so he couldn't run far away.

212
00:21:34,722 --> 00:21:35,823
Even so,

213
00:21:36,793 --> 00:21:38,222
we don't know when and if he will be caught.

214
00:21:38,462 --> 00:21:41,123
I put a GPS tracker on his clothes.

215
00:22:23,573 --> 00:22:25,002
- Hey! - Step aside!

216
00:22:25,472 --> 00:22:26,543
Let go!

217
00:22:27,303 --> 00:22:28,373
- Hey, push. - Darn it.

218
00:22:58,032 --> 00:22:59,671
If they can't catch a killer with a bell around his neck,

219
00:22:59,672 --> 00:23:00,803
they should quit being cops.

220
00:23:02,813 --> 00:23:04,172
I guess Detective Oh had your phone...

221
00:23:04,442 --> 00:23:06,383
because he was tracking Gong's location.

222
00:23:16,492 --> 00:23:18,092
Reporter Seo. You're with Tae Heon, right?

223
00:23:18,093 --> 00:23:19,692
- Can I talk to him... - I'm listening, so go on.

224
00:23:19,992 --> 00:23:21,021
Did you catch him?

225
00:23:21,022 --> 00:23:22,633
Yes, come and interview him.

226
00:23:22,833 --> 00:23:23,893
I'm coming now.

227
00:23:25,432 --> 00:23:26,462
Tae Heon.

228
00:23:29,172 --> 00:23:32,472
He killed my dad, so let me watch while you interview him.

229
00:24:00,403 --> 00:24:01,563
This was you, wasn't it?

230
00:24:08,343 --> 00:24:09,972
You killed Cha Eun Sae with this knife.

231
00:24:11,982 --> 00:24:13,383
Why did you kill Cha?

232
00:24:15,083 --> 00:24:16,653
Did Seol Woo Jae tell you to do it?

233
00:24:25,022 --> 00:24:26,593
I did it all on my own.

234
00:24:26,922 --> 00:24:28,093
So you admit that you killed her.

235
00:24:28,893 --> 00:24:30,232
Why did you kill her?

236
00:24:30,462 --> 00:24:31,833
Cha Eun Sae...

237
00:24:32,663 --> 00:24:34,363
found out that I killed Lee Na Ri. That's why.

238
00:24:34,432 --> 00:24:36,672
You killed Lee Na Ri?

239
00:24:37,202 --> 00:24:39,272
- How did it happen? - She jumped in front of my car,

240
00:24:39,803 --> 00:24:41,001
but I didn't see her and hit her with my car.

241
00:24:41,002 --> 00:24:43,113
- When did this happen? - The evening...

242
00:24:43,742 --> 00:24:45,712
of December 24, 2009.

243
00:25:06,462 --> 00:25:08,732
Hello, my... My friend is hurt.

244
00:25:09,303 --> 00:25:10,633
She collapsed.

245
00:25:12,803 --> 00:25:14,242
No, it was an accident.

246
00:25:16,212 --> 00:25:19,012
We're near the Bongto factory now.

247
00:25:19,813 --> 00:25:20,813
This voice.

248
00:25:21,482 --> 00:25:23,583
On the evening of December 24, 2009,

249
00:25:23,752 --> 00:25:26,182
Seol Woo Jae, who was 19 at the time, called it in.

250
00:25:27,252 --> 00:25:30,123
This friend of his who was hurt. It sounds like Lee Na Ri.

251
00:25:31,522 --> 00:25:33,192
When you hit Lee Na Ri with your car,

252
00:25:33,462 --> 00:25:35,232
was Seol Woo Jae in the car with you?

253
00:25:40,333 --> 00:25:42,573
That voice. Are you sure it was Woo Jae?

254
00:25:42,803 --> 00:25:45,202
Yes, we already checked and confirmed that it was him.

255
00:25:47,343 --> 00:25:48,472
I can't believe this.

256
00:25:50,172 --> 00:25:52,242
Back then, I didn't know Mr. Seol Woo Jae.

257
00:25:53,313 --> 00:25:56,353
From what I know, Chairman Seol's driver at the time...

258
00:25:57,383 --> 00:26:00,182
hit his friend with the car by mistake, so he called it in.

259
00:26:00,853 --> 00:26:01,922
Am I wrong?

260
00:26:04,022 --> 00:26:06,623
The day you hit Lee Na Ri with the car and killed her...

261
00:26:07,823 --> 00:26:10,332
coincides with the day he reported his friend's accident to the police.

262
00:26:10,333 --> 00:26:11,531
And you say they are not related?

263
00:26:11,532 --> 00:26:13,462
In 2009, I was a police detective.

264
00:26:13,932 --> 00:26:15,903
Back then, I had nothing to do with Mujin Group.

265
00:26:19,942 --> 00:26:21,602
In 2009, your sister was diagnosed...

266
00:26:21,603 --> 00:26:23,272
with a rare disease. Didn't Chairman Seol Pan Ho...

267
00:26:23,573 --> 00:26:25,383
of Mujin Construction take care of her medical expenses?

268
00:26:25,482 --> 00:26:26,583
I received that money...

269
00:26:27,512 --> 00:26:28,912
in return for turning a blind eye...

270
00:26:28,913 --> 00:26:30,682
to some corruption in the company.

271
00:26:32,682 --> 00:26:34,422
Look into it, and you'll find out right away.

272
00:26:34,553 --> 00:26:37,452
You think you can bury the truth by getting away like this?

273
00:26:42,093 --> 00:26:44,962
This is security footage from January 10 from Mount Mueon.

274
00:26:45,663 --> 00:26:47,502
That day, Seol Woo Jae was in Mueon,

275
00:26:48,403 --> 00:26:50,303
and he visited the site where Lee Na Ri was buried.

276
00:26:50,932 --> 00:26:52,802
Lee Ba Reun followed him,

277
00:26:52,803 --> 00:26:54,942
so he found out where his sister was buried.

278
00:26:57,413 --> 00:26:58,582
Can I see the still images...

279
00:26:58,583 --> 00:27:00,782
from the security footage from Mount Mueon Tae Heon is referring to?

280
00:27:20,903 --> 00:27:22,002
This is Woo Jae.

281
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:26,671
Seol Woo Jae denied it was him, but anyone would say...

282
00:27:26,672 --> 00:27:27,972
It is him.

283
00:27:28,742 --> 00:27:30,873
I heard Assemblyman Mo's daughter said...

284
00:27:31,143 --> 00:27:32,913
Lee Na Ri left the factory that night,

285
00:27:33,442 --> 00:27:35,952
so I told Mr. Seol the truth.

286
00:27:38,883 --> 00:27:40,153
That's why he went there.

287
00:27:42,522 --> 00:27:43,793
Murdering Cha Eun Sae,

288
00:27:44,053 --> 00:27:46,222
hitting Lee Na Ri with a car and burying her in the mountain,

289
00:27:46,663 --> 00:27:47,893
and killing Lee Ba Reun too.

290
00:27:48,793 --> 00:27:49,992
It was all me.

291
00:27:59,073 --> 00:28:00,972
Mr. Seol had nothing to do with it.

292
00:28:02,413 --> 00:28:04,112
You want to involve him...

293
00:28:04,113 --> 00:28:06,482
because of your personal feelings.

294
00:28:07,212 --> 00:28:08,212
I told you.

295

00:28:17,522 --> 00:28:18,522
Okay.

299
00:28:37,113 --> 00:28:38,172
I'm sorry.

300
00:28:40,843 --> 00:28:41,913
For what?

301
00:28:42,712 --> 00:28:43,952
For duping me so far?

302
00:28:44,413 --> 00:28:45,583
Or for stabbing me?

303
00:28:47,222 --> 00:28:49,053
I became a detective because you were one.

307
00:29:01,333 --> 00:29:02,502
I'll think of you.

308
00:29:04,502 --> 00:29:06,001

but you don't feel an ounce of guilt!

00:33:57,072 --> 00:33:59,043
As if I'd bargain with you.

363
00:34:00,703 --> 00:34:03,672
I forgot my place and acted out.

364
00:34:04,442 --> 00:34:05,782
Don't take it to heart.

365
00:34:08,612 --> 00:34:10,612
I should give you a celebratory gift.

366
00:34:13,453 --> 00:34:17,322
You gave me more than enough money.

367
00:34:28,402 --> 00:34:31,032
I'm sorry about Secretary Gong.

368
00:34:32,373 --> 00:34:33,472
Will it be okay?

369
00:34:35,672 --> 00:34:38,213
I silenced the press, so it'll blow over.

370
00:34:38,813 --> 00:34:41,312
Everyone's busy minding the election result right now.

371
00:34:41,313 --> 00:34:42,342
Not that.

372
00:34:44,813 --> 00:34:46,583
He worked for you.

373
00:34:47,853 --> 00:34:49,893
He won't mention you, will he?

374
00:34:50,692 --> 00:34:52,663
The murders he committed.

375
00:34:55,592 --> 00:34:57,393
They have nothing to do with you.

376
00:35:01,762 --> 00:35:04,203
Don't you hope more than anyone that I were involved?

377
00:35:04,902 --> 00:35:07,572
Wasn't that why you were looking into him like a rat?

378
00:35:09,512 --> 00:35:12,172
You go too far whenever you smell a profit.

379
00:35:13,242 --> 00:35:15,342
When we were working on the first Mujin Resort,

380
00:35:15,782 --> 00:35:18,083
you kept digging to find my weakness,

381
00:35:18,253 --> 00:35:19,852
and Seo Sang Gyeon caught on.

382
00:35:19,853 --> 00:35:21,253
You almost went down.

383
00:35:23,922 --> 00:35:25,551
You went digging again...

384
00:35:25,552 --> 00:35:28,163
and was going to threaten me for shares, weren't you?

385
00:35:30,063 --> 00:35:32,703
I have something to share about Secretary Gong.

386
00:35:33,703 --> 00:35:36,102
My daughter-in-law suspected I was behind him,

387
00:35:36,103 --> 00:35:39,273
so I told her I didn't know him at the time.

388
00:35:40,472 --> 00:35:43,273
I said I met him after the resort was done,

389
00:35:43,842 --> 00:35:45,912
and that back in 2009,

390
00:35:45,913 --> 00:35:48,281
he worked for you, so keep that in mind.

391
00:35:48,282 --> 00:35:50,282
- What are you up to? - What?

392
00:35:50,612 --> 00:35:53,051
You erased all traces of him for your sake...

393
00:35:53,052 --> 00:35:55,452
after the truck accident by forging the case report.

394
00:35:55,453 --> 00:35:57,321
I did that for you so...

395
00:35:57,322 --> 00:35:58,353
Yes.

396
00:35:58,453 --> 00:36:02,221
You did that much so we could build the first Mujin Resort.

397
00:36:02,222 --> 00:36:04,092
Do me another favor.

398
00:36:04,563 --> 00:36:06,063
Lie low and keep quiet.

399
00:36:11,333 --> 00:36:13,772
Even if Jung Won were to bother you,

400
00:36:13,773 --> 00:36:15,003
nothing changes.

401
00:36:15,842 --> 00:36:18,012
All you have to do is keep quiet,

402
00:36:18,543 --> 00:36:20,012
like you did before.

403
00:36:37,663 --> 00:36:38,862
Was it fate?

404
00:36:40,632 --> 00:36:43,802
I witnessed Cha Eun Sae's death and came this far.

405
00:36:44,933 --> 00:36:46,043
It feels like...

406
00:36:48,103 --> 00:36:49,612
a massive mountain...

407
00:36:50,543 --> 00:36:51,742
that I can't avoid.

408
00:36:55,983 --> 00:36:57,012
Is that mountain...

409
00:36:59,652 --> 00:37:00,652
me?

410
00:37:02,992 --> 00:37:04,123
What should I do?

411
00:37:05,523 --> 00:37:06,822
What about my baby?

412
00:37:27,282 --> 00:37:28,342
You're home.

413
00:37:36,123 --> 00:37:38,293
You know that Secretary Gong was arrested, right?

414
00:37:40,322 --> 00:37:43,332
Tae Heon said he suspected Mr. Gong when I showed him...

415
00:37:43,333 --> 00:37:44,893
the hidden camera footage.

416
00:37:46,862 --> 00:37:49,273
You realized after seeing the video too, right?

417
00:37:51,672 --> 00:37:53,503
Did you hide it from me in case I lost control too?

418
00:37:54,503 --> 00:37:55,572
No.

419
00:37:56,873 --> 00:37:59,782
You kept quiet because it doesn't end with Mr. Gong.

420
00:38:01,012 --> 00:38:02,712
Your father's behind Mr. Gong,

421
00:38:02,713 --> 00:38:03,753
and perhaps...

422
00:38:14,262 --> 00:38:15,393
Why won't you say anything?

423
00:38:16,032 --> 00:38:17,233
Because...

424
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:20,703
I can't say anything.

425
00:38:21,433 --> 00:38:23,172
You can't lie anymore,

426
00:38:23,333 --> 00:38:25,703
but you can't admit to anything either.

427
00:38:26,773 --> 00:38:27,842
Is that it?

428
00:38:29,572 --> 00:38:30,842
Keeping quiet is a crime too.

429
00:38:33,282 --> 00:38:35,882
You did a horrible thing not just to me,

430
00:38:36,713 --> 00:38:38,282
but also...

431
00:38:38,813 --> 00:38:39,953
to my child.

432
00:38:41,722 --> 00:38:44,853
If you truly care about me and the baby,

433
00:38:46,393 --> 00:38:47,793
you couldn't do this.

434
00:38:50,192 --> 00:38:51,233
Your love...

435
00:38:52,703 --> 00:38:53,802
is a lie.

436
00:38:54,463 --> 00:38:55,463
You're right.

437
00:38:57,572 --> 00:38:59,103
My love is a lie.

438
00:39:01,103 --> 00:39:02,873
From the moment we met and until now,

439
00:39:05,213 --> 00:39:07,612
I pursued you and clung to you.

440
00:39:08,983 --> 00:39:10,382
I'm sorry for wanting so much.

441
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:14,282
Let's call it quits.

442
00:39:16,592 --> 00:39:17,793
I'll give you a divorce.

443
00:39:19,992 --> 00:39:21,163
I'll leave.

444
00:40:13,819 --> 00:40:15,219
(Assemblyman Mo Hyung Taek)

445
00:40:18,547 --> 00:40:19,717
It's been a long time.

446
00:40:20,456 --> 00:40:21,556
What's the occasion?

447
00:40:21,686 --> 00:40:23,326
Before I head to Gangwon Province,

448
00:40:23,887 --> 00:40:25,056
I'd like to see you.

449
00:40:26,396 --> 00:40:28,627
I'll text you my address. Let's meet.

450
00:40:28,956 --> 00:40:30,095
What is it about?

451
00:40:30,096 --> 00:40:31,396
You won't regret it.

452
00:40:38,467 --> 00:40:39,706
I heard about it.

453
00:40:40,777 --> 00:40:42,436
You identified your father's killer...

454
00:40:42,947 --> 00:40:44,706
after many years.

455
00:40:45,846 --> 00:40:48,346
Should I congratulate you...

456
00:40:48,846 --> 00:40:50,345
or offer my condolences?

457
00:40:50,346 --> 00:40:53,487
You heard who's responsible, didn't you?

458
00:40:56,587 --> 00:40:58,757
To think someone you knew well was the killer.

459
00:40:59,197 --> 00:41:00,197
Goodness.

460
00:41:01,297 --> 00:41:02,627
It must've been a huge shock.

461
00:41:03,226 --> 00:41:05,697
Assemblyman Mo. No, sorry.

462
00:41:07,596 --> 00:41:10,306
Don't you know him well too, Governor Mo?

463
00:41:11,366 --> 00:41:13,007
Back in 2009, Gong Joon Ho...

464
00:41:13,107 --> 00:41:16,277
worked for you, according to my father-in-law.

465
00:41:16,976 --> 00:41:18,047
Is that true?

466
00:41:18,877 --> 00:41:20,717
On December 24, 2009,

467
00:41:21,177 --> 00:41:22,616
the day of the factory fire,

468
00:41:23,246 --> 00:41:25,146
you know there was a truck accident, right?

469
00:41:26,056 --> 00:41:27,316
Did you have...

470
00:41:27,317 --> 00:41:29,857
nothing to do with that accident?

471
00:41:32,226 --> 00:41:33,357
I have a topic...

472
00:41:34,257 --> 00:41:36,027
more important than that.

473
00:41:38,127 --> 00:41:41,096
Your father, Seo Sang Gyeon.

474
00:41:41,297 --> 00:41:44,206
He came to see me the day before he died.

475
00:41:48,507 --> 00:41:49,946
(January 9, 2010)

476
00:41:49,947 --> 00:41:51,377
Despite the fire,

477
00:41:51,777 --> 00:41:53,817
the truth will come out eventually.

478
00:41:54,846 --> 00:41:56,016
You're a journalist,

479
00:41:56,516 --> 00:41:58,547
but you keep ignoring facts...

480
00:41:58,947 --> 00:42:02,016
and insist your conspiracy theory is right.

481
00:42:02,657 --> 00:42:05,857
There's nothing I can do.

482
00:42:08,157 --> 00:42:09,766
You're trying so desperately...

483
00:42:10,596 --> 00:42:13,067
to protect Chairman Seol and his family.

484
00:42:13,396 --> 00:42:15,166
I wonder if you'd be so relaxed...

485
00:42:15,337 --> 00:42:17,507
if another of that family's crimes were to surface.

486
00:42:17,806 --> 00:42:18,935
Another crime?

487
00:42:18,936 --> 00:42:20,637
Unlike the corrupt resort development,

488
00:42:20,737 --> 00:42:22,536
I have clear evidence...

489
00:42:22,746 --> 00:42:24,976
that that crime is a fact.

490
00:42:27,116 --> 00:42:29,447
I'm keeping it in a safe place just in case.

491
00:42:29,916 --> 00:42:31,487
Even if something happens to me,

492
00:42:31,817 --> 00:42:33,657
that evidence...

493
00:42:33,857 --> 00:42:36,127
will never be found or disappear.

494
00:42:36,726 --> 00:42:38,127
My dad said that?

495
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:40,026
What is that proof?

496
00:42:40,027 --> 00:42:43,567
Don't you think it's up to you to find it?

497
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:50,567
Why are you...

498
00:42:51,967 --> 00:42:53,837
telling me all this?

499
00:42:56,047 --> 00:42:57,076
I wonder.

500
00:42:58,277 --> 00:42:59,717
Why did I tell you?

501
00:43:02,116 --> 00:43:03,286
One thing's clear.

502
00:43:03,887 --> 00:43:05,387
I only told you the facts.

503
00:43:07,516 --> 00:43:10,186
I wish you luck, Ms. Seo.

(Commendation, Lieutenant Gong Joon Ho)

506
00:43:21,936 --> 00:43:24,467
Human life is so fragile.

507
00:43:27,536 --> 00:43:29,205
Don't fool around. Search thoroughly.

508
00:43:29,206 --> 00:43:30,246
Yes, sir.

509
00:44:01,507 --> 00:44:02,536
This is...

510
00:44:04,476 --> 00:44:05,546
Did you find something?

511
00:44:05,547 --> 00:44:06,817
I think this is Jung Won's father's.

512
00:44:27,366 --> 00:44:29,197
What is the clear proof?

513
00:44:30,007 --> 00:44:31,507
Where did he put it?

514
00:44:36,777 --> 00:44:38,377

(Detective Kim Tae Heon)

516
00:44:46,387 --> 00:44:47,415
Did you see the photo?

517
00:44:47,416 --> 00:44:48,587
That's my dad's.

518
00:44:48,916 --> 00:44:50,726
I put that sticker on for him.

519
00:44:51,286 --> 00:44:52,527
Where did you find it?

520
00:44:52,797 --> 00:44:54,297
At Gong Joon Ho's home.

521
00:44:54,956 --> 00:44:56,127
He took it after the murder.

522
00:44:56,496 --> 00:44:57,967
Was there a memory card?

523
00:44:58,366 --> 00:44:59,396
No.

524
00:45:01,896 --> 00:45:03,467
The clear proof.

525
00:45:05,137 --> 00:45:06,176
Is that it?

526
00:45:06,177 --> 00:45:07,177
What?

527
00:45:07,178 --> 00:45:10,277
I think my dad hid the memory card somewhere.

528
00:45:10,846 --> 00:45:12,007
I'll call you when I find it.

529
00:45:23,487 --> 00:45:25,685
Dad said he kept clear proof somewhere...

530
00:45:25,686 --> 00:45:27,297
about my father-in-law.

531
00:45:28,556 --> 00:45:31,226
I think it's a memory card, so I'm looking through his things,

532
00:45:32,067 --> 00:45:33,696
- but I can't find it. - Forget his things.

533
00:45:33,697 --> 00:45:35,567
He might have hidden it among your things.

534
00:45:35,797 --> 00:45:38,306
Go through the stuff people keep for a long time.

535
00:45:39,266 --> 00:45:40,575
He's your dad.

536
00:45:40,576 --> 00:45:43,576
Pretend you're him and think.

537
00:45:43,846 --> 00:45:46,377
Where would you put something crucial if you were him?

538
00:45:46,846 --> 00:45:49,317
In a USB flash drive or external hard drive.

539
00:45:50,317 --> 00:45:52,887
But Dad never gave me such a thing.

540
00:45:53,857 --> 00:45:54,887
What about you?

541
00:45:55,056 --> 00:45:56,726
He didn't give me anything either.

542
00:45:58,387 --> 00:45:59,656
Could he have put it...

543
00:45:59,657 --> 00:46:01,726
on the company intranet or a backup site?

544
00:46:02,027 --> 00:46:04,026
Your dad died while on the job,

545
00:46:04,027 --> 00:46:06,396
so they'll have deleted any of his files.

546
00:46:06,837 --> 00:46:08,366
Knowing my dad,

547
00:46:09,036 --> 00:46:11,036
he wouldn't have kept it in one place.

548
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:15,436
Do you know what backup site he used mostly?

549
00:46:18,306 --> 00:46:19,306
Okay.

552
00:46:55,317 --> 00:46:56,317
Sit down.

553
00:47:04,387 --> 00:47:06,595
I've already made up my mind to leave alone.

554
00:47:06,596 --> 00:47:07,955
I won't change my mind, no matter what you say.

555
00:47:07,956 --> 00:47:10,196
Mujin Group has been selected as the winner...

556
00:47:10,197 --> 00:47:12,096
of this year's Best Managed Company Award.

557
00:47:13,366 --> 00:47:16,866
The Almighty is finally rewarding me for my hard work.

558
00:47:18,366 --> 00:47:19,837
This award will help us...

559
00:47:20,177 --> 00:47:23,006
promote the development of the second Mujin Resort,

560
00:47:23,007 --> 00:47:25,476
and it'll also help solidify your leadership.

561
00:47:25,907 --> 00:47:27,946
Give an acceptance speech at the award ceremony tomorrow...

562
00:47:27,947 --> 00:47:30,616
on behalf of the company so everyone can look up to you.

563
00:47:31,786 --> 00:47:34,757
This is a rare chance to shine in the media spotlight.

564
00:47:36,686 --> 00:47:39,087
I have made it clear to you that I am leaving.

565
00:47:42,757 --> 00:47:46,266
You said yourself that you'd make sure this project became a success.

566
00:47:46,496 --> 00:47:48,536
Do you think running a company is like some children's prank?

567
00:47:54,936 --> 00:47:56,746
There's something you're ignoring.

568
00:47:59,777 --> 00:48:01,047
You can deny it all you want,

569
00:48:02,377 --> 00:48:03,616
but you are still my son.

570
00:48:49,627 --> 00:48:50,826
Let's meet now.

571
00:49:12,186 --> 00:49:13,516
Considering how serious your injury was,

572
00:49:14,857 --> 00:49:15,956
you seem to be doing all right.

573
00:49:15,987 --> 00:49:17,357
And you don't seem so well.

574
00:49:18,987 --> 00:49:21,157
Is it because someone is taking the fall for what you did?

575
00:49:22,697 --> 00:49:24,226
Why are you so upset?

576
00:49:25,996 --> 00:49:27,337
Because I dropped the honorifics?

577
00:49:28,137 --> 00:49:30,436
Or is it because I'm telling the truth?

578
00:49:54,757 --> 00:49:58,826
I understand. She was your first love, for goodness' sake.

579
00:50:00,467 --> 00:50:01,797
It was an unfortunate accident.

580
00:50:03,337 --> 00:50:05,337
You wanted to save her, so you called it in yourself.

581
00:50:05,436 --> 00:50:06,637
But she died,

582
00:50:06,777 --> 00:50:09,507
and you didn't want to go to jail, so you hid it all this time.

583
00:50:11,076 --> 00:50:13,116
Now that you're becoming a father,

584
00:50:13,416 --> 00:50:15,746
I bet you want to conceal it more thoroughly.

585
00:50:19,047 --> 00:50:20,056
Are you done talking?

586
00:50:27,427 --> 00:50:29,297
When you told me that Jung Won was pregnant,

587
00:50:29,527 --> 00:50:30,627
you said this to me.

588
00:50:32,627 --> 00:50:35,996
"I don't want her to suffer any pain or hardship."

589
00:50:36,666 --> 00:50:37,936
"That's why I'd like you..."

590
00:50:39,137 --> 00:50:41,036
"to set her free."

591
00:50:41,407 --> 00:50:42,806
"Help her so she doesn't..."

592
00:50:43,607 --> 00:50:44,646
"have to suffer."

593
00:50:45,846 --> 00:50:49,146
You needed to hear those words more than I did.

594
00:50:51,887 --> 00:50:54,087
In the past, I was sure your feelings for Jung Won...

595
00:50:55,887 --> 00:50:58,357
were caused by your obsession with her, not love.

596
00:50:59,757 --> 00:51:00,757
But that day,

597
00:51:01,797 --> 00:51:03,726
after hearing what you said, I realized...

598
00:51:07,237 --> 00:51:08,337
that it was love after all.

599
00:51:15,076 --> 00:51:16,177
By keeping this up,

600
00:51:17,806 --> 00:51:19,576
you will only make Jung Won suffer more.

601
00:51:22,646 --> 00:51:23,686
So give up already.

602

(Incorrect password, please try again)

603
00:52:04,527 --> 00:52:05,987
Do I have to give up like this?

604
00:52:21,007 --> 00:52:23,306
I'm keeping it in a safe place just in case.

605
00:52:23,646 --> 00:52:25,346
Even if something happens to me,

606
00:52:25,547 --> 00:52:27,515
that evidence...

607
00:52:27,516 --> 00:52:29,817
will never be found or disappear.

608
00:52:32,416 --> 00:52:34,317
The fact that Dad was so sure...

609
00:52:35,016 --> 00:52:38,326
probably means it won't be found even if it was hacked.

610
00:52:39,527 --> 00:52:41,127
Was there a different ID?

Meet me at the place where we first met.

614
00:54:19,657 --> 00:54:20,657
I'll wait for you.

615
00:54:51,226 --> 00:54:52,257
Jung Won.

616
00:54:53,596 --> 00:54:54,927
Why did you want to meet here, all of a sudden?

617
00:54:56,996 --> 00:54:58,297
The day we first met,

618
00:55:00,436 --> 00:55:01,496
you were...

619
00:55:02,996 --> 00:55:04,737
staring at the waves.

620
00:55:09,677 --> 00:55:10,706
That's right.

621
00:55:12,306 --> 00:55:14,146
Meeting you here that day...

622
00:55:16,047 --> 00:55:17,616
felt like a miracle.

623
00:55:24,726 --> 00:55:25,927
Jung Won.

624
00:55:29,596 --> 00:55:31,226
- What's wrong? - Woo Jae.

625
00:55:32,427 --> 00:55:33,496
I know everything.

626
00:55:35,096 --> 00:55:36,137
I saw everything.

627
00:55:38,737 --> 00:55:41,737
The videos of the accident my father took.

628
00:55:45,547 --> 00:55:46,547
I found them.

629
00:55:57,387 --> 00:55:58,427
Why did you do that?

630
00:55:59,956 --> 00:56:01,556
Why did you do that? Why?

631
00:56:03,496 --> 00:56:05,896
How could you kill someone?

632
00:56:06,837 --> 00:56:07,967
How?

633
00:56:26,857 --> 00:56:27,956
Jung Won.

634
00:56:30,357 --> 00:56:31,427
What do I do?

635
00:56:33,496 --> 00:56:35,027
I really deserve to die.

636
00:56:38,226 --> 00:56:39,567
Kill me, please.

637
00:56:49,576 --> 00:56:51,146
Before I met you,

638
00:56:54,947 --> 00:56:56,817
I should have just died here.

639
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:02,157
I regret getting you roped into my life.

640
00:57:06,387 --> 00:57:07,456
Jung Won.

641
00:57:09,556 --> 00:57:10,896
I know. I...

642
00:57:14,436 --> 00:57:15,967
I know I'm a horrible person.

643
00:57:20,677 --> 00:57:22,007
Before you turn into a horrible person,

644
00:57:22,837 --> 00:57:24,146
you must stop here.

645
00:57:24,947 --> 00:57:26,346
You have to stop.

646
00:57:27,076 --> 00:57:28,116
Look at me.

647
00:57:28,916 --> 00:57:29,947
Look at me.

648
00:57:32,146 --> 00:57:35,357
You're the only one who can reveal the truth.

649
00:57:37,326 --> 00:57:38,427
My dad...

650
00:57:39,956 --> 00:57:41,726
Your father killed him, didn't he?

651
00:57:48,996 --> 00:57:50,237
I'm sorry.

652
00:57:52,806 --> 00:57:54,306
I'm really sorry.

653
00:58:00,777 --> 00:58:02,777
I'm so sorry.

654
00:58:10,157 --> 00:58:12,657
I'm sorry.

655
00:58:25,306 --> 00:58:26,806
Until just now,

656
00:58:28,536 --> 00:58:31,877
I felt as though it'd swallow us.

657
00:58:36,246 --> 00:58:37,286
Let's...

658
00:58:39,387 --> 00:58:40,416
just go.

659
00:58:41,087 --> 00:58:42,416
Let's go to the police station.

660
00:58:47,297 --> 00:58:48,757
Make the right choice.

661
00:58:49,527 --> 00:58:50,666
I will go with you.

662
00:58:53,527 --> 00:58:55,697
Before you found out about what I did,

663
00:58:56,496 --> 00:58:59,366
I kept getting conflicting thoughts throughout the day.

664
00:59:00,806 --> 00:59:02,877
"Shall I just tell her everything?"

665
00:59:03,607 --> 00:59:05,607
"Or shall I hide somewhere alone and never show myself again?"

666
00:59:11,746 --> 00:59:13,286
But you've found out,

667
00:59:16,186 --> 00:59:17,286
so it's all over.

668
00:59:20,326 --> 00:59:21,527
I've let it all go.

669
00:59:25,197 --> 00:59:27,567
I'll do the one last thing I can do...

670
00:59:30,407 --> 00:59:31,607
and get punished for what I did.

675
00:59:51,257 --> 00:59:53,797
is the Grand Award.

676
00:59:54,257 --> 00:59:57,326
I will now announce the winner.

677
00:59:58,697 --> 00:59:59,697
All right.
