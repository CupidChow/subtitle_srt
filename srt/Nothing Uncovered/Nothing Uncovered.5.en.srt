Like you said, I am going to war indeed.

Neither Cha Geum Sae nor Mo Hyung Taek were caught...

61
00:04:28,966 --> 00:04:31,036
in the security footage stored at the bar.

62
00:04:32,765 --> 00:04:34,005
Let's recap.

63
00:04:36,976 --> 00:04:37,976
First,

64
00:04:39,245 --> 00:04:40,305
Cha Geum Sae.

65
00:04:40,646 --> 00:04:41,874
He's a gambling addict...

66
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:43,916
and has been seen being physically aggressive toward his sister.

67
00:04:44,115 --> 00:04:46,884
He said he was riding his bike at the estimated time of her death,

68
00:04:46,885 --> 00:04:49,055
but there's no evidence that backs up his alibi.

69
00:04:49,755 --> 00:04:50,825
Seol Woo Jae.

70
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:52,525
He was having an affair with Cha Eun Sae,

71
00:04:52,526 --> 00:04:54,625
but he's not the father of the baby,

72
00:04:54,825 --> 00:04:56,625
and his alibi checks out.

73
00:04:57,195 --> 00:04:58,195
Mo Hyung Taek.

74
00:04:58,865 --> 00:05:00,365
He was rumored to be Cha Eun Sae's sponsor.

75
00:05:00,865 --> 00:05:03,296
Cha Eun Sae met his aide.

76
00:05:03,495 --> 00:05:05,204
We believe Cha Geum Sae is connected to him in some way.

77
00:05:05,205 --> 00:05:07,205
No alibi yet.

78
00:05:07,776 --> 00:05:08,805
And...

79
00:05:11,276 --> 00:05:12,305
Seo Jung Won.

80
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:15,744
She met Cha Eun Sae the day before she died.

81
00:05:15,745 --> 00:05:17,415
Her necklace was found at the scene,

82
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:19,315
and there's a 14-minute gap in her alibi.

83
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:21,515

84
00:05:22,555 --> 00:05:23,786
The woman in the wine-colored coat.

The woman Seol Woo Jae wants to hide.

86
00:05:26,726 --> 00:05:28,195
The day Cha Eun Sae died,

87
00:05:28,396 --> 00:05:31,096
she left his studio and was seen entering Leaders Palace...

88
00:05:31,296 --> 00:05:32,396
and hasn't been seen again since.

89
00:05:32,565 --> 00:05:34,265
From her name and face to her age,

90
00:05:35,065 --> 00:05:36,666
we know nothing about her.

91
00:05:40,606 --> 00:05:42,375
There's something between these two,

92
00:05:43,106 --> 00:05:45,245
and the same goes for these two.

93
00:05:49,276 --> 00:05:50,445
These two too.

94
00:05:51,846 --> 00:05:54,286
By the way, how are we going to find this woman?

95
00:05:54,586 --> 00:05:55,885
I told Seo Jung Won about her.

96
00:05:56,216 --> 00:05:58,324
This is about her husband,

97
00:05:58,325 --> 00:05:59,586
so she'll find her before we do.

98
00:06:05,726 --> 00:06:06,726
Yes.

99
00:06:07,426 --> 00:06:09,036
Oh, sure. All right.

100
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:10,565

(Statement Form, Kim Min Chul)

104
00:06:27,755 --> 00:06:29,615
You do remember stalking Cha Eun Sae, right?

105
00:06:30,255 --> 00:06:31,325
You see, I...

106
00:06:34,226 --> 00:06:36,655
I was purely rooting for her as a fan. That's all.

107
00:06:36,656 --> 00:06:38,364
You tried to cut off your own finger.

108
00:06:38,365 --> 00:06:40,026
I'd call that grotesque, not pure.

109
00:06:40,265 --> 00:06:43,135
And you happened to be patrolling at the estimated time of her death.

110
00:06:43,596 --> 00:06:45,135
You sneaked into her office too, didn't you?

111
00:06:46,765 --> 00:06:48,005
Just the corridor.

112
00:06:51,276 --> 00:06:52,276
Yes.

113
00:06:54,046 --> 00:06:55,445
It's all my fault.

114
00:06:57,276 --> 00:06:59,546
I should have patrolled the area more thoroughly.

115
00:07:01,255 --> 00:07:02,815
She must've felt that it was so unfair.

116
00:07:03,586 --> 00:07:06,156
She couldn't even close her eyes.

117
00:07:07,656 --> 00:07:10,125
We haven't told anyone that she died with her eyes open.

118
00:07:16,135 --> 00:07:18,765
Everyone in the security office knows about it.

119
00:07:21,406 --> 00:07:23,976
I see here that you went to high school in Mueon, not in Seoul.

120
00:07:25,245 --> 00:07:26,276
Yes.

121
00:07:28,476 --> 00:07:31,745
You're crying now because you clearly liked her very much.

122
00:07:31,885 --> 00:07:33,716
She was having an affair with your high school friend, of all people.

123
00:07:35,216 --> 00:07:37,685
You must've been really upset when you read that article.

124
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:46,166
This.

125
00:07:47,226 --> 00:07:49,935
You didn't borrow money. Didn't you extort money from Seol?

126
00:07:51,635 --> 00:07:52,704
While stalking Cha Eun Sae,

127
00:07:52,705 --> 00:07:54,335
you found out they were having an affair,

128
00:07:54,336 --> 00:07:55,705
so in return for keeping your lips sealed.

129
00:07:56,776 --> 00:07:58,646
No, never.

130
00:07:59,546 --> 00:08:01,375
Then again, 10,000 dollars is too little.

131
00:08:01,745 --> 00:08:02,745
That's true.

132
00:08:02,945 --> 00:08:05,346
But getting 10,000 dollars monthly is a lucrative business.

133
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,314
If "early October" meant...

134
00:08:08,315 --> 00:08:10,114
the deadline for him to pay you, not your payment deadline.

135
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:12,026
Like I said, that is not the case!

136
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:20,365
My gosh.

137
00:08:21,865 --> 00:08:23,765
I feel like I'm about to burst into tears.

138
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:27,350
So you're saying...

139
00:08:27,374 --> 00:08:29,274
your father was stabbed to death,

140
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:32,275
and you found his body.

141
00:08:33,444 --> 00:08:34,713
That's horrible.

142
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:36,515
It must've been traumatizing.

143
00:08:37,444 --> 00:08:38,755
I must be drunk.

144
00:08:39,155 --> 00:08:41,824
I'm telling you all sorts of stuff.

145
00:08:42,025 --> 00:08:43,884
Don't say that.

146
00:08:43,885 --> 00:08:45,953
Hearing your stories...

147
00:08:45,954 --> 00:08:48,694
makes me feel like we got much closer.

148
00:08:50,795 --> 00:08:53,794
Did Cha Eun Sae see Doctor Yoo...

149
00:08:53,795 --> 00:08:55,134
for consultations too?

150
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:56,135
Yes.

151
00:08:57,235 --> 00:08:58,405
I think...

152
00:08:59,834 --> 00:09:02,775
her older brother killed her.

153
00:09:03,604 --> 00:09:04,645
I'm positive.

154
00:09:04,974 --> 00:09:06,173
Why do you think so?

155
00:09:06,174 --> 00:09:09,184
She told me so a few days before she died.

156
00:09:09,584 --> 00:09:13,854
That her brother would beat her to death.

157
00:09:14,184 --> 00:09:15,853
You heard that in person?

158
00:09:15,854 --> 00:09:18,824
You bet I did. Would I make that up?

159
00:09:19,424 --> 00:09:22,895
I bet she told my director all that during a session.

160
00:09:24,094 --> 00:09:27,804
She can't reveal the consultations she filmed.

161
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:30,833
What did she film?

162
00:09:30,834 --> 00:09:32,104
Doctor Yoo.

163
00:09:33,275 --> 00:09:35,005
She films every one of them.

164
00:09:35,444 --> 00:09:37,304
So you should be careful too.

165
00:09:37,574 --> 00:09:40,944
Don't get stabbed in the back like me.

166
00:09:41,615 --> 00:09:43,444
She films all the consultations?

167
00:09:43,745 --> 00:09:44,853
Are you sure?

168
00:09:44,854 --> 00:09:46,915
My head aches.

169
00:09:48,025 --> 00:09:49,854
I must be drunk.

170
00:09:56,025 --> 00:09:58,495
He said he had never felt loved by me.

171
00:09:59,535 --> 00:10:00,694
He said he was lonely.

172
00:10:01,505 --> 00:10:03,505
He blamed it all on me.

173
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:05,304
That jerk...

174
00:10:06,074 --> 00:10:07,204
I won't suppress it.

175
00:10:08,604 --> 00:10:10,974
The pain he gave me. This humiliation.

176
00:10:11,015 --> 00:10:12,615
I'll make sure he gets it all back.

177
00:10:38,275 --> 00:10:40,234
Did you leave your car and take a taxi?

178
00:10:40,235 --> 00:10:41,304
What's up with you?

179
00:10:41,745 --> 00:10:43,775
When your wife packed and left,

180
00:10:44,145 --> 00:10:46,015
she planted a listening device.

181
00:10:46,814 --> 00:10:49,515
She might have put something on your phone too.

182
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:52,785
Or your car.

183
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:03,495
Yes.

184
00:11:03,865 --> 00:11:05,333
I saw it in Eun Sae's office,

185
00:11:05,334 --> 00:11:07,265
and got one because it was my taste.

186
00:11:08,235 --> 00:11:09,904
Your studio.

187
00:11:09,905 --> 00:11:12,375
I rented it as soon as there was a vacancy.

188
00:11:13,104 --> 00:11:14,135
What are you...

189
00:11:14,574 --> 00:11:15,645
going to do here?

190
00:11:19,814 --> 00:11:23,115
- I'm still thinking. - What's the listening device about?

191
00:11:28,084 --> 00:11:29,554
The day Eun Sae died.

192
00:11:30,184 --> 00:11:33,094
Seo Jung Won knows you went to the scene.

193
00:11:33,895 --> 00:11:35,464
The woman you're hiding.

194
00:11:36,495 --> 00:11:37,525
She also knows...

195
00:11:38,635 --> 00:11:39,964
I was there too.

196
00:11:41,704 --> 00:11:43,434
She played a recording during our session.

197
00:11:43,865 --> 00:11:46,604
She believes you and I killed Eun Sae together.

198
00:11:47,474 --> 00:11:50,644
What if Jung Won were to find out...

199
00:11:50,645 --> 00:11:53,015
you send her to me, and that...

200
00:11:53,415 --> 00:11:56,014
we had been close for a long time?

201
00:11:56,015 --> 00:11:57,145
Get it straight.

202
00:11:58,854 --> 00:12:01,385
- I didn't send her to... - Why did you...

203
00:12:02,184 --> 00:12:04,124
get yourself into this by showing me a weakness?

204
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:05,625
You're not the only one with leverage.

205
00:12:06,155 --> 00:12:07,554
I have something on you too.

206
00:12:08,795 --> 00:12:11,735
No. Don't you think you're at a bigger disadvantage?

207
00:12:13,995 --> 00:12:16,304
I regret cheating on my wife,

208
00:12:16,564 --> 00:12:18,974
but I regret even more that I went to you for help.

209
00:12:21,005 --> 00:12:23,505
I won't go any further. Somehow...

210
00:12:24,145 --> 00:12:25,344
I'll get through this.

211
00:12:27,074 --> 00:12:29,785
Don't mind the favor I asked last time.

212
00:12:30,684 --> 00:12:31,755
I came to say that.

213
00:12:34,255 --> 00:12:35,625
The day Eun Sae died.

214
00:12:35,954 --> 00:12:37,854
She came to me for a consultation,

215
00:12:38,025 --> 00:12:39,655
and there was blood on her sleeve.

216
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:44,165
What?

217
00:12:44,594 --> 00:12:46,535
If people were to know that,

218
00:12:46,765 --> 00:12:49,334
they would be even more convinced that Jung Won's guilty.

219
00:12:50,964 --> 00:12:52,235
What do you think?

220
00:12:52,934 --> 00:12:55,005
Shall we make it so?

221
00:13:02,584 --> 00:13:04,515
When your wife packed and left,

222
00:13:05,115 --> 00:13:06,854
she planted a listening device.

223
00:13:08,824 --> 00:13:09,924
She might have...

224
00:13:10,285 --> 00:13:11,895
put something on your phone too.

225
00:13:12,694 --> 00:13:13,924
Or your car.

226
00:14:12,015 --> 00:14:13,054
My head aches.

227
00:14:15,954 --> 00:14:17,084
You're up.

228
00:14:18,025 --> 00:14:19,125
Yes.

229
00:14:19,854 --> 00:14:23,525
Sorry. I got so drunk, I blacked out.

230
00:14:24,564 --> 00:14:25,635
Do you really...

231
00:14:26,535 --> 00:14:27,834
not remember anything?

232
00:14:27,934 --> 00:14:29,035
Why?

233
00:14:29,505 --> 00:14:30,765
Am I in trouble?

234
00:14:31,235 --> 00:14:34,074
You told me about Cha Eun Sae.

235
00:14:35,104 --> 00:14:36,245
And Doctor Yoo.

236
00:14:37,174 --> 00:14:38,245
That she...

237
00:14:39,145 --> 00:14:41,915
tapes all the sessions without the patient's consent.

238
00:14:44,214 --> 00:14:45,854
Ms. Seo, that's...

239
00:14:48,954 --> 00:14:50,754
I'm working on the case,

240
00:14:50,755 --> 00:14:53,193
and I must ask Doctor Yoo about it.

241
00:14:53,194 --> 00:14:54,255
You can't.

242
00:14:55,964 --> 00:14:58,165
She'll fire me right away.

243
00:14:59,165 --> 00:15:02,405
Yesterday, you said something else to me.

244
00:15:02,804 --> 00:15:04,775
That I shouldn't get stabbed in the back like you.

245
00:15:06,304 --> 00:15:08,144
Darn it. I said all sorts of crap.

246
00:15:08,145 --> 00:15:09,474
I don't know what you went through,

247
00:15:10,104 --> 00:15:12,045
but I got stabbed in the back too.

248
00:15:12,344 --> 00:15:13,474
By Doctor Yoo.

249
00:15:15,385 --> 00:15:17,184
If I say I won't go to Doctor Yoo,

250
00:15:18,314 --> 00:15:19,485
will you help me?

251
00:15:23,655 --> 00:15:25,823
What do you need my help with?

252
00:15:25,824 --> 00:15:27,795
The recordings of Cha Eun Sae's sessions.

253
00:15:28,495 --> 00:15:29,625
Are they in the director's office?

254
00:15:30,064 --> 00:15:31,765
- Yes. - Those clips.

255
00:15:32,434 --> 00:15:33,834
Can you get me copies?

256
00:15:34,194 --> 00:15:36,434
I don't think so.

257
00:15:37,104 --> 00:15:40,974
Doctor Yoo comes in before I do and leaves after I clock off.

258
00:15:41,444 --> 00:15:43,774
She even orders lunch and eats in.

259
00:15:43,775 --> 00:15:46,245
She never leaves her office.

260
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:54,415
- My gosh. What's this? - Isn't it something?

261
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:58,294
Was this captured right before they got into it?

262
00:15:58,295 --> 00:16:00,795
It's a killer video. Don't you want to see it?

263
00:16:01,025 --> 00:16:03,463
Can you go outside if you want to giggle...

264
00:16:03,464 --> 00:16:04,464
over tacky photos?

265
00:16:04,465 --> 00:16:07,063
Just so you know, it's a video, not a photo.

266
00:16:07,064 --> 00:16:08,764
And this is a screenshot.

267
00:16:08,765 --> 00:16:09,834
The two of them...

268
00:16:10,635 --> 00:16:12,134
I'm too embarrassed to say,

269
00:16:12,135 --> 00:16:14,535
but it pretty much shows them doing it.

270
00:16:15,005 --> 00:16:16,303
I don't get it.

271
00:16:16,304 --> 00:16:19,074
She must've seen this. Why is she defending her husband?

272
00:16:19,314 --> 00:16:22,485
That means husband and wife are accomplices.

273
00:16:23,844 --> 00:16:26,314
Do you enjoy insulting a colleague?

274
00:16:27,954 --> 00:16:29,054
We're analyzing the case.

275
00:16:29,885 --> 00:16:32,824
I forgot. You're Jung Won's hardcore fan.

276
00:16:33,454 --> 00:16:35,124
Are you upset I'm dissing your fave?

277
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:36,964
You're not dissing her. You're starting rumors...

278
00:16:37,295 --> 00:16:38,594
and trying to fake a story.

279
00:16:39,265 --> 00:16:40,334
Like a piece of trash.

280
00:16:41,165 --> 00:16:42,564
You're darn rude.

281
00:16:43,564 --> 00:16:45,704
You're starting fights just like your senior.

282
00:16:46,635 --> 00:16:48,245
A journalist should speak facts.

283
00:16:49,844 --> 00:16:51,444
You're the one who starts fights.

284
00:16:51,915 --> 00:16:53,313
And here's a fact.

285
00:16:53,314 --> 00:16:55,714
The camera flips to the ceiling so you don't see them do anything.

286
00:16:56,314 --> 00:16:58,415
Why are you so sure of what's in the video? Did you watch it?

287
00:16:59,854 --> 00:17:00,915
If you don't believe me,

288
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:02,985
see for yourself.

289
00:17:13,735 --> 00:17:15,735
You don't even have the guts to play it in my presence.

290
00:17:16,965 --> 00:17:20,205
I'm so jealous you have the guts.

291
00:17:20,804 --> 00:17:22,844
So what if you are so gutsy?

292
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:26,574
You'll never get to run the Cha Eun Sae story.

293
00:17:27,015 --> 00:17:29,343
You know why our CEO pulled the plug.

294
00:17:29,344 --> 00:17:30,484
It's postponed for now,

295
00:17:30,485 --> 00:17:32,515
but your show's practically canceled.

296
00:17:38,495 --> 00:17:41,823
The chief wants our team to stay here today.

297
00:17:41,824 --> 00:17:43,024
He doesn't want to see us.

298
00:17:43,025 --> 00:17:45,765
Then we can discuss new stories here.

299
00:17:45,995 --> 00:17:47,663
We don't have to.

300
00:17:47,664 --> 00:17:49,134
A month from now, I will report...

301
00:17:50,134 --> 00:17:51,304
Cha Eun Sae's case.

302
00:17:55,775 --> 00:17:57,144
The chairman's not in.

303
00:17:58,114 --> 00:17:59,245
That's why I'm here.

304
00:18:52,894 --> 00:18:55,035
(Yoo Yoon Young)

305
00:18:55,664 --> 00:18:57,435
They had known each other since high school?

306
00:18:57,935 --> 00:19:00,775
(Yoo Yoon Young)

307
00:19:20,824 --> 00:19:22,495
Doctor Yoo. It's me.

308
00:19:23,525 --> 00:19:24,965
I have a favor to ask you.

309
00:19:28,094 --> 00:19:29,634
(Kim Min Chul)

310
00:19:31,804 --> 00:19:33,775
(Graduated from Mueon High...)

311
00:19:36,005 --> 00:19:38,144
(with Seol Woo Jae)

312
00:19:40,015 --> 00:19:41,015
Mueon?

313
00:19:53,403 --> 00:19:55,512
(Birth: Yeseon-dong, Mueon-gu, Mueon City)

314
00:19:57,770 --> 00:19:59,709
- I remembered correctly. - What did you remember correctly?

315
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,480
Seol Woo Jae and Kim Min Chul both graduated from Mueon High.

316
00:20:03,379 --> 00:20:04,980
Cha Eun Sae was also from Mueon.

317
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,220
Really?

318
00:20:06,449 --> 00:20:08,820
That means Cha Geum Sae is also from Mueon.

319
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:12,519
(Party Representative, Former Prosecutor)

320
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,659
(No overdue wages)

321
00:20:19,959 --> 00:20:21,899
(Passed the bar while attending Hankuk University)

322
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,939
(Worked as a prosecutor at Mueon District Prosecutors' Office)

323
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:31,840
This is interesting.

324
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:35,310
What's interesting?

325
00:20:35,311 --> 00:20:36,649
I checked just in case.

326
00:20:37,909 --> 00:20:39,720
Mo Hyung Taek was in Mueon for a while too.

327
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:40,780
I see.

328
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,719
Everyone related to the Cha case...

329
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,459
used to live in Mueon?

330
00:20:49,929 --> 00:20:51,459
Everyone but Seo Jung Won.

331
00:20:51,659 --> 00:20:52,760
(The day before the murder)

332
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,329
(Visit confirmed with the security footage)

333
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:55,369
(Unable to check the content inside the envelope)

334
00:20:58,470 --> 00:20:59,770
- Who is it? - Close the blinds.

335
00:21:03,439 --> 00:21:04,669
What brings you here?

336
00:21:04,709 --> 00:21:05,709
Hello.

337
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,609
I'm a reporter from KBM.

338
00:21:09,909 --> 00:21:11,010
My name is No Ji Ho.

339
00:21:12,679 --> 00:21:16,549
Could I ask you a few questions about Cha Eun Sae's murder case?

340
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:18,119
No. You can't ask me any questions.

341
00:21:18,959 --> 00:21:20,720
- Tighten the security for the room. - Yes, sir.

342
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:22,530
Then how about I ask you some questions...

343
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:26,659
about your relationship with Ms. Seo Jung Won?

344
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:32,970
You guys had a secret relationship three years ago.

345
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:34,800
Is that true?

346
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:39,539
Gosh. There was no relationship between them.

347
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:41,139
That's not true. Never.

348
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,250
That's odd.

349
00:21:42,379 --> 00:21:44,148
From what I heard, the reason behind your breakup...

350
00:21:44,149 --> 00:21:45,179
Mr. No.

351
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:48,179
What do you like to drink?

352
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:08,540
You're going to tell me that you and Ms. Seo never dated, right?

353
00:22:08,939 --> 00:22:09,970
Because we didn't.

354
00:22:10,409 --> 00:22:11,570
Will you say that even if I find evidence?

355
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:13,310
Isn't that going too far?

356
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:18,249
Would a relationship between a reporter and a detective...

357
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:19,320
make an interesting article?

358
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:20,419
No, it wouldn't.

359
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:21,990
But...

360
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,449
what if Seo Jung Won was the culprit?

361
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:26,918
On top of that, what if the culprit and the detective...

362
00:22:26,919 --> 00:22:28,730
in charge of the case used to date?

363
00:22:29,689 --> 00:22:31,659
Now, that would be interesting. Don't you agree?

364
00:22:32,699 --> 00:22:34,658
You're a reporter, but you asked two hypothetical questions.

365
00:22:34,659 --> 00:22:37,300
Well, it all begins with a hypothetical question...

366
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:38,770
for reporters and detectives.

367
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,500
That brings me to my next question.

368
00:22:40,639 --> 00:22:43,608
What's the chance of Ms. Seo turning out to be the culprit?

369
00:22:43,609 --> 00:22:44,639
"One hundred percent."

370
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,379
You already made up your mind with the conclusion.

371
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:52,149
To give you my precise conclusion,

372
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:56,050
I concluded that Ms. Seo and her husband are accomplices.

373
00:22:56,919 --> 00:22:58,389
There's a clear motive for murder.

374
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,689
Her necklace was found at the crime scene.

375
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:03,159
She's even defending her cheating husband?

376
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:04,659
That proves my suspicion.

377
00:23:05,099 --> 00:23:07,959
I'm sure that's bothering you as well.

378
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:10,598
I'm going to run...

379
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:12,598
an in-depth investigation about Cha Eun Sae's murder and air it.

380
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:13,840
I can count on your cooperation, right?

381
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:16,439
Let's help each other out.

382
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:18,638
If you share some information about your investigation,

383
00:23:18,639 --> 00:23:20,878
I won't publicize your past relationship with Ms. Seo.

384
00:23:20,879 --> 00:23:21,909
Have at it.

385
00:23:22,709 --> 00:23:26,050
Both of your hypothetical questions turn out to be false.

386
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:29,889
- Both of them? - She had nothing to do with me.

387
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:32,859
And she's not the culprit.

(3 years ago)

393
00:24:14,128 --> 00:24:15,168
Sir.

394
00:24:17,739 --> 00:24:18,769
Sir!

395
00:24:20,769 --> 00:24:23,079
Sir. Please calm down.

396
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:25,579
I get that he's your partner, but this is property damage!

397
00:24:49,168 --> 00:24:51,938
- You should hear him out first. - I can't reach him!

398
00:24:56,178 --> 00:24:57,178
Darn it.

399
00:24:57,539 --> 00:24:58,947
Tell me exactly what he said. Whom was he meeting?

400
00:24:58,948 --> 00:24:59,948
- I don't know... - Come on.

401
00:25:01,908 --> 00:25:04,418
I saw earlier that he declined Ms. Seo's call.

402
00:25:04,549 --> 00:25:05,549
Seo Jung Won?

403
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:11,989
Did you locate Detective Cha?

404
00:25:50,358 --> 00:25:51,928
Jin Woo!

405
00:25:53,529 --> 00:25:55,229
Breathe. Come on, breathe!

406
00:25:55,569 --> 00:25:56,599
Jin Woo.

407
00:26:00,408 --> 00:26:01,768
I'm at Gangu Building.

408
00:26:01,769 --> 00:26:02,809
A detective fell off the building.

409
00:26:03,009 --> 00:26:04,438
Send an ambulance here. Please hurry.

410
00:26:05,509 --> 00:26:08,208
- Jin Woo. Hey, you... - I'm sorry for deceiving you.

411
00:26:09,418 --> 00:26:11,448
Seo Jung Won is deceiving you too.

412
00:26:12,718 --> 00:26:13,749
What?

413
00:26:14,019 --> 00:26:16,458
She approached you to investigate me.

414
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:20,158
So stop being a fool.

415
00:26:23,158 --> 00:26:24,458
Don't let her use you.

416
00:26:33,769 --> 00:26:34,809
Jin Woo...

417
00:26:54,358 --> 00:26:55,398
Tae Heon.

418
00:27:00,128 --> 00:27:01,499
Is Detective Cha hurt?

419
00:27:01,898 --> 00:27:02,938
Don't come near us.

420
00:27:05,138 --> 00:27:06,868
- He's dead. - What?

421
00:27:07,168 --> 00:27:09,039
How long have you secretly been investigating Detective Cha?

422
00:27:10,878 --> 00:27:12,408
Why did you hide it from me?

423
00:27:13,608 --> 00:27:14,809
He was your partner.

424
00:27:15,779 --> 00:27:16,947
How could I tell you?

425
00:27:16,948 --> 00:27:18,648
Did you approach me to investigate my partner?

426
00:27:19,448 --> 00:27:21,849
To score a scoop, so you can air it on your show?

427
00:27:23,688 --> 00:27:24,918
You said you wanted to date me.

428
00:27:26,858 --> 00:27:28,729
You said you loved me. Was it all a lie?

429
00:27:30,698 --> 00:27:31,799
Was it?

430
00:27:32,198 --> 00:27:33,698
- Tae Heon. - Don't come closer.

431
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:39,708
Get lost.

432
00:27:41,539 --> 00:27:42,638
Get lost, right this instant.

(Civil Servant ID Card, Cha Jin Woo)

434
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:22,970
I didn't think...

435
00:28:23,369 --> 00:28:25,129
you'd come here on my partner's death anniversary.

436
00:28:26,899 --> 00:28:27,970
You should've called me.

437
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,740
Then we could've reminisced about the old days on our way here.

438
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:36,510
You...

439
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,849
have never once apologized to me.

440
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,079
Because I never wronged you.

441
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:51,730
Are you working hard to find the woman in that wine-colored coat?

442
00:28:51,859 --> 00:28:54,399
I hope I don't regret my decision to leak such confidential info.

443
00:28:55,159 --> 00:28:56,369
If I find her,

444
00:28:57,169 --> 00:28:58,839
won't it put you at a disadvantage?

445
00:28:59,399 --> 00:29:01,470
You need me to remain the prime suspect...

446
00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:03,069
to feel like you got your revenge.

447
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,819
How about a game with me?

448
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:46,779
If you got into baseball at a younger age,

449
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:48,220
you'd be a major league player now.

450
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:51,819
And if I got into fighting when I was young,

451
00:29:52,050 --> 00:29:53,790
I'd be a thug now. Right?

452
00:29:58,490 --> 00:30:01,159
I guess you ran into someone when you visited Detective Cha.

453
00:30:02,329 --> 00:30:04,430
- Who? Reporter Seo? - Gosh, seriously.

454
00:30:04,869 --> 00:30:06,940
What are you, a mind reader?

455
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,669
You know I was even more skilled than mind readers...

456
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:12,579
- as a detective. - Well...

457
00:30:12,609 --> 00:30:14,878
Let's say I get why you quit being a detective. Let's just say that.

458
00:30:14,879 --> 00:30:17,808
But why did you decide to work for that family as their secretary?

459
00:30:17,809 --> 00:30:18,809
My goodness.

460
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:21,118
Why are you dumping it all on me?

461
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:23,549
You should blame Seo Jung Won...

462
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:25,619
for marrying Chairman Seol's son, of all men.

463
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,759
And before that, blame yourself for getting stabbed in the back.

464
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,289
My gosh. I can't stand you.

465
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:31,530
You little...

466
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:33,459
You rebelled like this...

467
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:34,699
when you got your cigarettes confiscated in school.

468
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,030
- Come here, you punk. - Let go!

469
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:39,339
Let go of me.

470
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:43,970
My gosh. You haven't aged at all.

471
00:30:44,369 --> 00:30:45,980
- Oh, my. - Gosh.

472
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:56,450
I did everything in my power to forget her.

473
00:31:00,059 --> 00:31:01,119
And now that you met her again,

474
00:31:02,859 --> 00:31:03,990
you've realized you never forgot her?

475
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:28,079
So? What are you going to do?

476
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:33,520
Who's that?

477
00:31:38,589 --> 00:31:40,558
I guess it was someone I shouldn't know.

478
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:41,629
Like Cha Eun Sae.

479
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,799
Kim Min Chul. We went to high school together.

480
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:47,940
I lent him some money.

481
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:50,970
You haven't forgotten about the kick-off ceremony tomorrow, right?

482
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,839
You said you wanted to talk to me after work. Was it about this?

483
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:57,780
Come with me.

484
00:32:04,349 --> 00:32:05,349
Why?

485
00:32:06,089 --> 00:32:07,460
I saw your shirt that night.

486
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:09,859
There was blood on it.

487
00:32:11,589 --> 00:32:13,700
In the morning, before the articles about her murder were published,

488
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:17,770
why did you look up her name?

489
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:25,169
And the night before that,

490
00:32:26,109 --> 00:32:28,339
why did you hurriedly handwash the clothes you wore that day?

491
00:32:31,109 --> 00:32:32,210
It wasn't you, was it?

492
00:32:34,579 --> 00:32:35,619
Jung Won.

493
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:38,119
It wasn't you, right?

494
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,319
Did you do it?

495
00:32:43,589 --> 00:32:46,159
How dare you. You, of all people,

496
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,760
can't have the audacity to ask me if I killed Cha Eun Sae.

497
00:32:50,899 --> 00:32:53,800
I looked for the shirt you tried to wash that day but couldn't find it.

498
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,839
Don't hide anything. Tell me the truth, please.

499
00:32:59,079 --> 00:33:00,139
"The truth?"

500
00:33:01,210 --> 00:33:02,409
I guess you already forgot...

501
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:05,280
that you were the one who hid the truth, not me.

502
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:10,319
What's your deal? What is this about?

503
00:33:11,019 --> 00:33:12,560
Are you asking if I went...

504
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:15,660
and stabbed your secret lover when I heard you were cheating on me?

505
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,859
Do I have to put up with you treating me like this? You jerk.

506
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:22,769
I must know the truth if I'm to protect you.

507
00:33:34,487 --> 00:33:36,217
I told myself I'd just tell the police I did it...

508
00:33:36,551 --> 00:33:38,591
if they pegged you as the culprit.

509
00:33:39,651 --> 00:33:40,861
If you didn't do it, it's all good.

510
00:33:41,392 --> 00:33:42,591
That was all I wanted to hear.

511
00:33:46,631 --> 00:33:48,532
It hurts.

512
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:51,872
I wanted to hear it from you.

513
00:33:52,345 --> 00:33:54,715
I had to. Only then can I protect you.

514
00:33:56,655 --> 00:33:57,985
Are you acting right now?

515
00:33:58,854 --> 00:34:00,155
You're putting on an act right now.

516
00:34:00,385 --> 00:34:03,295
You suspecting that I might be the culprit...

517
00:34:04,365 --> 00:34:06,224
means that you're not the one who did it.

518
00:34:08,135 --> 00:34:09,634
You really are clever.

519
00:34:09,635 --> 00:34:10,735
Jung Won.

520
00:34:11,965 --> 00:34:14,005
- It's not that. - As you're suspecting,

521
00:34:15,704 --> 00:34:17,345
I could've killed her.

522
00:34:17,874 --> 00:34:19,974
And as I'm suspecting, you might have hired someone...

523
00:34:20,874 --> 00:34:22,314
to kill her.

524
00:34:23,814 --> 00:34:24,945
Isn't it interesting?

525
00:34:26,644 --> 00:34:29,215
People think we're accomplices,

526
00:34:29,854 --> 00:34:30,854
but the two of us...

527
00:34:32,055 --> 00:34:33,795
are suspecting each other.

528
00:34:51,204 --> 00:34:52,845
I told myself I'd just tell the police I did it...

529
00:34:52,974 --> 00:34:55,075
if they pegged you as the culprit.

530
00:34:55,675 --> 00:34:56,945
If you didn't do it, it's all good.

531
00:34:57,545 --> 00:34:58,814
That was all I wanted to hear.

532
00:35:00,814 --> 00:35:03,655
Seo Jung Won. Snap out of it.

533
00:35:12,664 --> 00:35:14,763
The kick-off ceremony for Mujin Welfare Foundation...

534
00:35:14,764 --> 00:35:16,393
established by Mujin Group's Chairman Seol Pan Ho...

535
00:35:16,394 --> 00:35:17,834
will be held today.

536
00:35:18,104 --> 00:35:20,904
Chairman Seol's son, Mr. Seol Woo Jae, has been appointed chairman.

537
00:35:20,905 --> 00:35:22,104
Turn it off, please.

538
00:35:24,704 --> 00:35:25,704
Yes.

539
00:35:30,615 --> 00:35:31,845
The room I used?

540
00:35:34,184 --> 00:35:35,215
Okay.

541
00:35:44,564 --> 00:35:45,965
- Jung Won. - I searched the room...

542
00:35:46,925 --> 00:35:49,934
to see if I could find anything connected to Cha Eun Sae.

543
00:35:51,034 --> 00:35:54,005
If I found something, it'd mean you lied once again...

544
00:35:54,334 --> 00:35:55,805
when you told me it wasn't love.

545
00:35:57,874 --> 00:35:59,005
But I found nothing.

546
00:36:03,845 --> 00:36:04,945
I feel like an idiot,

547
00:36:07,784 --> 00:36:08,814
feeling happy to hear this.

548
00:36:10,055 --> 00:36:13,284
In the past, I thought my love was one-sided, but you're jealous.

549
00:36:16,624 --> 00:36:18,825
Whether it's love or hatred, it doesn't matter...

550
00:36:20,295 --> 00:36:21,735
as long as I know you care about me.

551
00:36:50,195 --> 00:36:52,763
Keep your eyes peeled to spot any women looking at Seo Jung Won.

552
00:36:52,764 --> 00:36:55,094
Did we come here to find that woman in the wine-colored coat?

553
00:36:55,095 --> 00:36:57,333
Seol Woo Jae and Mo Hyung Taek are here too.

554
00:36:57,334 --> 00:36:59,505

555
00:37:00,974 --> 00:37:02,104
My gosh. Hello.

00:37:02,505 --> 00:37:03,735
Thank you for coming.

Hello.

558
00:37:16,055 --> 00:37:17,555
Thank you for coming.

559
00:37:17,854 --> 00:37:19,284
Of course, I should be here.

560
00:37:19,825 --> 00:37:21,124
You invited me.

561
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:26,865
She's my therapist.

562
00:37:26,965 --> 00:37:30,064
She could step out between her appointments, so I invited her.

563
00:37:32,365 --> 00:37:33,505
Nice to meet you.

564
00:37:33,704 --> 00:37:34,974
I'm Yoo Yoon Young.

565
00:37:44,084 --> 00:37:46,243
You're so famous,

566
00:37:46,244 --> 00:37:47,885
and I heard a lot about you.

567
00:37:48,814 --> 00:37:50,485
I feel like I know you already.

568
00:37:52,124 --> 00:37:53,584
I badmouthed you a lot.

569
00:37:56,095 --> 00:37:58,825
I'll make up for all the bad things I did to her.

570
00:38:00,365 --> 00:38:01,534
You should.

571
00:38:02,264 --> 00:38:03,893
You help me in so many ways.

572
00:38:03,894 --> 00:38:06,764
I'll invite you to ours for dinner one day.

573
00:38:07,434 --> 00:38:09,504
- Can I? - I'd be honored...

574
00:38:09,505 --> 00:38:11,544
I believe it's against medical ethics...

575
00:38:11,545 --> 00:38:14,144
for a doctor and patient to meet in private.

576
00:38:15,175 --> 00:38:16,244
Am I wrong?

(Mujin Welfare Foundation Launch)

578
00:38:25,624 --> 00:38:26,624
No.

579
00:38:29,124 --> 00:38:31,624
I'd be honored, but I must refuse.

580
00:38:36,164 --> 00:38:38,405
I copied the videos of Cha Eun Sae's sessions.

581
00:38:38,834 --> 00:38:39,865
They'll start soon.

582
00:38:41,505 --> 00:38:43,534
Thanks for coming, director.

583
00:38:43,905 --> 00:38:44,905
Sure.

584
00:38:56,555 --> 00:38:57,854
Who's that woman?

585
00:38:57,925 --> 00:38:59,255
She looks like Ms. Seo's acquaintance.

586
00:38:59,425 --> 00:39:00,554
Did you get a photo of the three?

587
00:39:00,555 --> 00:39:01,555
Send it to me.

588
00:39:08,295 --> 00:39:09,564
You rarely invite someone...

589
00:39:10,635 --> 00:39:12,135
to events like this.

590
00:39:15,305 --> 00:39:16,575

was devoted to the development...

of academia, art, and society.

to improve the plummeting birth rate.

598
00:40:20,405 --> 00:40:24,945

00:40:42,095 --> 00:40:44,224
Thank you for sparing us your precious time.

604
00:40:45,465 --> 00:40:46,465
Yes, you.

605
00:40:46,466 --> 00:40:48,794
You have kept your distance from business so far.

606
00:40:48,795 --> 00:40:51,167
Do you plan to continue writing?

607
00:40:52,005 --> 00:40:55,433
No. To focus on running the welfare foundation,

608
00:40:55,434 --> 00:40:58,175
I will no longer write.

609
00:40:58,305 --> 00:41:01,345
Ms. Seo, how do you feel about your husband's decision?

610
00:41:05,345 --> 00:41:09,255
As his wife, I always respect and support his decisions.

611
00:41:09,954 --> 00:41:12,925
It looks like your marriage is even stronger...

612
00:41:13,155 --> 00:41:14,624
after the recent storm.

613
00:41:14,994 --> 00:41:16,794
You set up a welfare foundation...

614
00:41:16,795 --> 00:41:18,925
to contribute to raising the birth rate.

615
00:41:19,624 --> 00:41:21,465
Do you plan to be parents?

616
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:23,493
I can't help but wonder.

617
00:41:23,494 --> 00:41:25,104
Could you please answer?

618
00:41:27,334 --> 00:41:29,734
It's a shame you asked a question...

619
00:41:29,735 --> 00:41:31,404
that doesn't suit the occasion, Mr. No.

620
00:41:31,405 --> 00:41:34,004
You seem to have misunderstood my intention.

621
00:41:34,005 --> 00:41:36,775
If you were going to ask something that didn't suit the occasion,

622
00:41:36,945 --> 00:41:39,485
you should've asked what people really wanted to know.

623
00:41:47,894 --> 00:41:49,655
Rather than if we'll be parents,

624
00:41:49,925 --> 00:41:52,394
you want to know if I'll cover Cha Eun Sae's death...

625
00:41:53,095 --> 00:41:55,334
on my show "Nothing Uncovered."

626
00:41:58,805 --> 00:42:00,974
Well, you do have a point.

627
00:42:01,235 --> 00:42:02,805
Everyone thinks Seo Jung Won...

628
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:06,845
and her husband are connected to Cha Eun Sae's death.

629
00:42:07,204 --> 00:42:09,274
I might as well ask you now.

630
00:42:09,275 --> 00:42:11,743
As a journalist who's more impartial than anyone,

631
00:42:11,744 --> 00:42:13,643
will you explain on air that neither you...

632
00:42:13,644 --> 00:42:15,215
nor your husband are guilty?

633
00:42:16,684 --> 00:42:18,084
I won't just explain it.

634
00:42:18,825 --> 00:42:21,555
I'll run an exclusive show.

635
00:42:24,465 --> 00:42:27,664
I obtained previously unknown proof that Cha was assaulted...

636
00:42:28,595 --> 00:42:29,965
before she died.

637
00:42:30,695 --> 00:42:32,164
And a few days before she died,

638
00:42:32,264 --> 00:42:34,235
someone heard her say...

639
00:42:34,905 --> 00:42:37,005
her brother would beat her to death.

640
00:42:38,005 --> 00:42:39,144
I spoke to a witness.

641
00:42:46,014 --> 00:42:48,985
I'll follow every lead without giving up,

642
00:42:49,155 --> 00:42:51,854
and a month from now, I'll reveal...

643
00:42:52,624 --> 00:42:55,095
who killed Cha Eun Sae on my show.

646

668
00:46:11,925 --> 00:46:14,124
if you and I dated in secret.

You said we did?

It's in the past, and it's no big deal.

672

You're openly calling me the culprit now.

Convince me. Why did you let off Seol Woo Jae?

676
00:46:44,825 --> 00:46:46,584
Why are you trying so hard to defend him?

677
00:46:47,825 --> 00:46:49,525

Isn't she something?

681
00:47:05,545 --> 00:47:09,575
She wrapped things up by announcing she'd name the killer on her show.

682

She says she'll do it for Cha Eun Sae,

683

she wants to keep the spirit of journalism intact.

Anyway, after what happened today,

700

I realized once again how sly she could be.

Well,

702
00:48:27,084 --> 00:48:28,695
she can't be as sly as you.

Do you want it? Should I give it to you? Yes?

705

But under one condition.

706
00:48:42,135 --> 00:48:45,045
You just insulted my wife. Apologize right now.

707
00:48:45,505 --> 00:48:46,644
Then it's yours.

708
00:48:55,084 --> 00:48:57,514
I'll be watching you too.

709

Do we have extra pamphlets in the supply room?

710
00:49:07,564 --> 00:49:11,064
A police officer is in there. He said he was on official business.

711
00:49:12,005 --> 00:49:14,465
- A police officer? - Yes.

712
00:49:28,555 --> 00:49:30,054
If you weren't trying to convince me,

713
00:49:30,055 --> 00:49:31,055
why did you want to see me?

714
00:49:31,755 --> 00:49:34,695
You leaked information about the woman in the red coat.

715
00:49:35,155 --> 00:49:37,354
Did you tell my husband about that? You didn't, right?

716
00:49:39,894 --> 00:49:40,993
Don't tell him I know about her.

717
00:49:40,994 --> 00:49:42,163
Why should I do what you ask?

718
00:49:42,164 --> 00:49:43,433
Don't you think...

719
00:49:43,434 --> 00:49:45,135
I would find her faster if he lowered his guard?

720
00:49:45,264 --> 00:49:46,634
Maybe, you already found her.

721
00:49:46,635 --> 00:49:48,074
I could accuse you of the same thing.

722
00:49:48,075 --> 00:49:49,474
Are you making a fool out of me when you've already identified her?

723
00:49:50,075 --> 00:49:51,675
Just like you made a fool out of me?

724
00:49:53,805 --> 00:49:54,874
Detective Kim.

725
00:49:56,045 --> 00:49:58,584
You always make it sound like you know everything about me...

726
00:49:59,115 --> 00:50:00,284
when you know nothing.

727
00:50:05,555 --> 00:50:07,224
Mr. No might still be outside.

728
00:50:32,985 --> 00:50:34,014
You can come out.

729
00:51:10,414 --> 00:51:12,454
I think you're here to talk about Min Chul.

730
00:51:13,533 --> 00:51:14,448
Let's meet on the rooftop.

731
00:51:19,710 --> 00:51:21,840
I lent him a mere 10,000 dollars.

732
00:51:23,781 --> 00:51:25,249
But you tried to use that...

733
00:51:25,250 --> 00:51:26,951
to accuse me and Min Chul of a ridiculous crime.

734
00:51:27,851 --> 00:51:29,681
The money didn't come with strings attached.

735
00:51:30,221 --> 00:51:31,919
Therefore, the money you gave to Kim Min Chul...

736
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:34,020
has nothing to do with Cha Eun Sae's murder.

737
00:51:34,221 --> 00:51:35,690
I'm sure you guys got your story straight.

738
00:51:36,820 --> 00:51:38,291
You have so many people to hide.

739
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:40,031
Women...

740
00:51:41,331 --> 00:51:42,460
and school friends.

741
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:54,011
Ms. Seo had the same coat as this one.

742
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:57,510
Did you buy the coat at the same time?

743
00:51:57,511 --> 00:51:58,980
For your wife and this woman?

744
00:52:02,081 --> 00:52:04,781
How did you know that my wife had that coat?

745
00:52:08,221 --> 00:52:09,761
I saw her in it when she came to the station...

746
00:52:10,221 --> 00:52:11,491
to investigate her story.

747
00:52:13,031 --> 00:52:15,800
You can remember what my wife wore to the police station.

748
00:52:17,761 --> 00:52:19,031
You have...

749
00:52:20,201 --> 00:52:21,431
a lot of interest in my wife.

750
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:23,400
Naturally.

751
00:52:24,371 --> 00:52:27,371
Your wife's necklace was found at the scene of Cha's murder.

752
00:52:28,681 --> 00:52:30,209
Come to think of it, both Cha Eun Sae...

753
00:52:30,210 --> 00:52:32,281
and Ms. Seo had the same necklaces.

754
00:52:33,951 --> 00:52:36,049
Shouldn't you tell me the truth...

755
00:52:36,050 --> 00:52:38,391
about this woman before your wife finds out?

756
00:52:42,491 --> 00:52:44,391
Suit yourself.

757
00:52:45,230 --> 00:52:47,331
You can try all you want, but that won't make me the culprit.

758
00:52:48,701 --> 00:52:50,661
Do you have anything else to say to me?

759
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:55,741
So you graduated from Mueon High.

760
00:52:57,270 --> 00:52:59,311
Cha Eun Sae was born in Mueon too.

761
00:53:00,371 --> 00:53:02,710
Did you guys know each other when you lived in Mueon?

762
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:08,250
Gosh. Seriously.

763
00:53:11,250 --> 00:53:12,689
Did you seriously ask me that?

764
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:14,320
It's odd to call it a coincidence.

765
00:53:14,891 --> 00:53:16,919
Along with the victim, Cha Eun Sae,

766
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:18,931
everyone related to the case...

767
00:53:19,460 --> 00:53:20,590
is from...

768
00:53:21,130 --> 00:53:22,331
Mueon.

769
00:53:24,761 --> 00:53:26,170
Did something happen in Mueon?

770
00:53:32,070 --> 00:53:33,170
Yes.

771
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:35,081
Okay.

772
00:53:40,710 --> 00:53:42,951
You know what? I asked you...

773
00:53:43,851 --> 00:53:46,120
numerous uncomfortable questions during our talks.

774
00:53:46,121 --> 00:53:48,621
But you had never ended our conversations first. Not once.

775
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:53,491
See? You're acting different today.

776
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:55,900
I guess there's something about Mueon.

777
00:53:58,431 --> 00:54:00,730
- Let go of me. - I'm not done talking to you.

778
00:54:01,130 --> 00:54:03,269
I told you to let go of me.

779
00:54:03,270 --> 00:54:05,411
I told you to let go.

780
00:54:07,241 --> 00:54:08,311
You...

781
00:54:09,311 --> 00:54:10,811
You picked the wrong guy to mess with.

782
00:54:12,911 --> 00:54:15,681
Why does it feel good to see you...

783
00:54:16,581 --> 00:54:17,820
lose your temper?

784
00:54:19,750 --> 00:54:21,090
You crazy jerk.

785
00:54:21,221 --> 00:54:23,419
I agree that I'm a crazy jerk.

786
00:54:23,420 --> 00:54:24,520
But what about you?

787
00:54:25,661 --> 00:54:27,130
Do you agree that you are...

788
00:54:28,431 --> 00:54:29,500
a psychopath?

789
00:54:31,130 --> 00:54:33,570
It's crystal clear to me that you are a guilty man.

790
00:54:34,630 --> 00:54:37,741
You're reeking of a rotten smell like a criminal.

791
00:54:44,141 --> 00:54:45,250
That's dangerous. What are you doing?

792
00:54:45,451 --> 00:54:46,750
Do you want there to be another article?

793
00:54:48,650 --> 00:54:50,181
Stop that before anyone sees you.

794
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:18,851
It's odd to call it a coincidence.

795
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:21,109
Along with the victim, Cha Eun Sae,

796
00:55:21,110 --> 00:55:23,750
everyone related to the case is from Mueon.

797
00:55:25,721 --> 00:55:27,590
Did something happen in Mueon?

798
00:55:29,261 --> 00:55:31,320
See? You're acting different today.

799
00:55:31,391 --> 00:55:33,331
I guess there's something about Mueon.

800
00:55:37,031 --> 00:55:38,871
He clearly said, "everyone related to the case."

801
00:55:39,971 --> 00:55:42,201
Who else is related to the case other than my husband?

802
00:55:43,101 --> 00:55:46,011
Why did my husband get worked up by that question?

803
00:55:58,721 --> 00:56:00,590
You'll need this for your comeback episode.

804
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:03,221
It has photos of the assault and the medical certificate file.

805
00:56:04,561 --> 00:56:06,491
Cha Eun Sae asked me to hold on to them when she was alive.

807
00:56:11,061 --> 00:56:12,270

00:56:12,770 --> 00:56:14,900
for attending the launch party regardless of the reason you had.

809

Have you been sleeping well?

814
00:56:35,090 --> 00:56:37,460
You seem a little tired.

So, you're saying Jin Myung Sook's ex-husband...

819
00:56:45,531 --> 00:56:47,399
was the victim in the chemical plant fire case?

820
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:49,940
The victim and the accused in the case.

821
00:56:50,471 --> 00:56:53,540
The manager of the plant who died was indicted.

822
00:56:53,541 --> 00:56:57,439
I see. That's why there was this article about that fire case...

823
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:59,750
on the first page of her scrapbook.

824
00:57:00,411 --> 00:57:03,181
All the other articles were about Mo, so I thought it was odd.

825
00:57:04,650 --> 00:57:07,851
Jin Myung Sook approached Mo Hyung Taek's family on purpose.

826
00:57:08,420 --> 00:57:10,061
The prosecutor in charge of the case was...

827
00:57:10,291 --> 00:57:11,519
(Mo Hyung Taek)

828
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:12,761
It was none other than Mo Hyung Taek.

00:57:19,770 --> 00:57:23,201
Jin Myung Sook is also connected to Mueon somehow.

You said you and Woo Jae went to the same high school.

840
00:57:54,701 --> 00:57:55,871
Do you know someone named Na Ri?

841
00:57:56,371 --> 00:57:59,411
Why do you ask?

842
00:57:59,641 --> 00:58:00,710
Yesterday,

843
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:02,980
I went to his studio.

844
00:58:03,741 --> 00:58:06,480
He was asleep after drinking a bottle of liquor.

845
00:58:07,081 --> 00:58:08,951
He whimpered and groaned in his sleep...

846
00:58:09,150 --> 00:58:10,550
and suddenly said that name...

847
00:58:11,581 --> 00:58:13,090
while shedding tears.

848
00:58:13,891 --> 00:58:15,121
He cried?

849
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:16,761
The truth is,

850
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:21,291
I once heard him say something very shocking in his sleep.

851
00:58:22,761 --> 00:58:23,900
What did he say?

852
00:58:24,860 --> 00:58:26,170
That I can't tell you.

853
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:31,500
I'm going to do some digging and find out who this woman is.

854
00:58:32,871 --> 00:58:36,641

855

Cha Eun Sae knew...

856
00:58:49,291 --> 00:58:51,391
that Yoo Yoon Young and my husband went to the same school,

857
00:58:52,061 --> 00:58:54,491
and Yoo Yoon Young knew...

858
00:58:54,690 --> 00:58:56,360
that Cha Eun Sae was having an affair with him.

859

871
01:02:19,331 --> 01:02:22,129
