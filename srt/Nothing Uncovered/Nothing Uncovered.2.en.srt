00:00:59,271 --> 00:01:00,411
The door is closing.

11
00:02:11,011 --> 00:02:12,081
I don't believe this.

12
00:02:14,981 --> 00:02:16,011
Hey.

13
00:02:16,551 --> 00:02:17,620
Ms. Cha Eun Sae.

14
00:02:34,271 --> 00:02:36,201
(Chief Kang In Han)

15
00:02:41,271 --> 00:02:42,840
Swear your loyalty to me three times.

16
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:46,041
- Pardon me? - I met with the CEO...

17
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:48,511
and recommended you as Anchor Lee's successor for the nine o'clock news.

18
00:02:50,051 --> 00:02:51,851
Until the CEO finalizes his decision and picks you,

19
00:02:52,021 --> 00:02:53,791
you'd better stay out of trouble. Do you understand?

20
00:03:05,761 --> 00:03:06,861
Are you listening?

21
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:09,301
Why are you all quiet? Don't be such a downer.

22
00:03:15,141 --> 00:03:16,611
Hey, what's with the sirens?

23
00:03:17,481 --> 00:03:18,541
Where are you?

24
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:28,791
I'll call you later.

25
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:05,791
My gosh.

26
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:10,261
I'm so glad I ran into you here.

27
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:14,171
It's Unit 1201. I sent you the wrong unit number.

28
00:04:15,071 --> 00:04:18,000
I'm sorry. Did you go up to the 14th floor?

29
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Yes.

30
00:04:19,841 --> 00:04:22,711
The corridor was all dark, so I came right down.

31
00:04:22,841 --> 00:04:24,380
I came here hoping to find you.

32
00:04:24,981 --> 00:04:26,640
I tried calling you, but you didn't pick up.

33
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,580
I didn't know you called.

34
00:04:30,211 --> 00:04:31,221
Shall we?

35
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:45,301
Jung Won?

36
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,370
Jung Won.

37
00:04:50,171 --> 00:04:51,171
Yes.

38
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:56,971
Why do you think you suddenly experienced hyperventilation?

39
00:04:57,611 --> 00:04:59,711
Were you under a lot of stress or angry about something recently?

40
00:04:59,711 --> 00:05:01,981
Or did you experience some kind of emotional shock?

41
00:05:04,851 --> 00:05:06,180
What exactly happened?

42
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:12,591
I got into an argument with an informant.

43
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:22,770
Do you think...

44
00:05:23,801 --> 00:05:25,570
you were overly agitated?

45
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:30,510
Stay calm.

46
00:05:31,411 --> 00:05:32,541
I'm sure she didn't see it.

47
00:05:34,911 --> 00:05:36,180
Are you feeling uncomfortable?

48
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:43,520
I was quite agitated earlier,

49
00:05:44,591 --> 00:05:47,760
but I've calmed down now that I'm here.

50
00:05:48,661 --> 00:05:50,760
That tells me how much you trust me.

51
00:05:52,461 --> 00:05:54,301
And that's why I care about you more than my other patients.

52
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:11,620
(Security cameras will be installed...)

53
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:13,651
(upon completion of interior finish.)

54
00:06:26,601 --> 00:06:28,930
No cameras in the elevator or in the corridor on the 14th floor.

55
00:06:29,531 --> 00:06:30,901
They won't find me in the footage.

56
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:38,111
(We welcome our new residents.)

57
00:06:50,151 --> 00:06:51,320
The sirens...

58
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,921
had nothing to do with Cha Eun Sae, after all.

59
00:07:35,601 --> 00:07:38,341
What was I thinking, coming home like this? Why did I run away?

60
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:44,541
Jung Won, are you in there?

61
00:07:55,591 --> 00:07:56,620
I'm sorry.

62
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:00,461
I was stressed out, so I drank quite a bit.

63
00:08:02,591 --> 00:08:03,731
Stressed out? About what?

64
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:08,101
The truth is...

65
00:08:12,801 --> 00:08:14,211
For the past few days,

66
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:18,010
I haven't been able to write at all.

67
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:28,921
I'm so frustrated.

68
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:59,050
- A murder? - Yes.

69
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:00,250
Of a celebrity.

70
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:18,241
We barely got started on the Jin Myung Sook case.

71
00:09:18,441 --> 00:09:19,640
It'll be a headache.

72
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,811
Killers don't act depending on our schedule.

73
00:09:22,971 --> 00:09:25,981
Just like Jin, Cha was stabbed multiple times in the stomach.

74
00:09:30,851 --> 00:09:32,050
A lethal blow.

75
00:09:32,821 --> 00:09:34,351
- Murder weapon? - None.

76
00:09:34,351 --> 00:09:35,721
Her wallet and phone are gone too.

77
00:09:45,061 --> 00:09:46,800
- Did you photograph this? - No.

78
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:47,971
Do it now.

79
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,611
- It's snapped. - Could it belong to the killer?

80
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:02,111
Did it break in the scuffle?

81
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:03,681
Or it could be hers.

82
00:10:09,235 --> 00:10:10,365
What is this place?

83
00:10:10,365 --> 00:10:12,206
Cha Eun Sae's personal agency.

84
00:10:12,465 --> 00:10:13,735
They were preparing to open.

85
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:30,456
What is this?

86
00:10:31,086 --> 00:10:32,385
Why is it just like that time?

87
00:10:33,885 --> 00:10:36,426
You mean the clock at Jin Myung Sook's crime scene?

88
00:10:36,755 --> 00:10:38,326
I wondered what it meant too.

89
00:10:38,326 --> 00:10:40,365
Most of the stuff here doesn't work.

90
00:10:42,436 --> 00:10:43,495
Who found her?

91
00:10:43,635 --> 00:10:45,005
Two men who came to do the interior.

92
00:10:45,005 --> 00:10:47,576
Tae Heon. The building's interior isn't complete yet...

93
00:10:47,576 --> 00:10:49,105
I know. Get footage from the cameras...

94
00:10:49,105 --> 00:10:51,206
at the main entrance and basement parking level.

95
00:10:51,206 --> 00:10:52,206
Okay.

96
00:10:54,115 --> 00:10:55,176
Here you go.

97
00:10:56,845 --> 00:10:58,745
The other cameras including the ones...

98
00:10:58,745 --> 00:11:00,515
at the back were going to be installed today.

99
00:11:00,515 --> 00:11:03,515
Why did this have to happen yesterday?

100
00:11:03,515 --> 00:11:04,686
Don't ask why.

101
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:07,026
It had to be yesterday.

102
00:11:15,635 --> 00:11:18,605
It was the ideal opportunity to do it without being filmed.

103
00:11:19,536 --> 00:11:22,436
The killer would've planned the murder taking into account...

104
00:11:22,436 --> 00:11:24,546
the day the cameras would be installed.

105
00:11:26,546 --> 00:11:30,515
Either they obtained information that Cha would be at the office.

106
00:11:33,745 --> 00:11:36,456
Or they lured her there on purpose.

107
00:11:38,225 --> 00:11:39,526
It's one or the other.

108
00:11:42,755 --> 00:11:45,495
They stabbed her many times, viciously, facing her.

109
00:11:46,265 --> 00:11:48,465
So they could watch her suffer.

110
00:11:49,196 --> 00:11:50,906
It was someone with a grudge?

111
00:11:51,265 --> 00:11:52,406
What could that be?

112
00:11:52,906 --> 00:11:55,105
Money? Love? Revenge?

113
00:12:05,946 --> 00:12:06,985
(Cha Eun Sae)

114
00:12:09,686 --> 00:12:10,926
(Cha, beautiful in white)

115
00:12:13,556 --> 00:12:14,656
Darling.

116
00:12:17,595 --> 00:12:18,725
You startled me.

117
00:12:18,765 --> 00:12:19,895
Sorry.

118
00:12:21,296 --> 00:12:22,536
All this.

119
00:12:23,336 --> 00:12:25,836
Did you prepare it to celebrate the anniversary of my first novel?

120
00:12:26,066 --> 00:12:28,105
I had no idea.

121
00:12:28,406 --> 00:12:30,076
Sorry for coming home late and drunk.

122
00:12:30,576 --> 00:12:33,306
With whom and where did you drink last night?

123
00:12:34,515 --> 00:12:35,776
Alone, in my studio.

124
00:12:45,725 --> 00:12:46,855
I'm sorry.

125
00:12:53,526 --> 00:12:54,595
I have bad news.

126
00:12:56,036 --> 00:12:57,036
It's crazy.

127
00:12:58,306 --> 00:13:00,936
- Cha Eun Sae is dead! - What?

128
00:13:00,936 --> 00:13:03,806
What tabloid did you get that from?

129
00:13:03,806 --> 00:13:06,176
- Why would she die? - It's a fact.

130
00:13:06,176 --> 00:13:08,416
The newsflash will come on in five minutes.

131
00:13:09,776 --> 00:13:11,916
This just in. At around 5am on the 7th,

132
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,786
at her agency office in Gangha-gu,

133
00:13:13,786 --> 00:13:16,115
actress Cha Eun Sae was found dead.

134
00:13:16,115 --> 00:13:19,526
Interior laborers found her and called the police.

135
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:21,956
The police suppose it's a murder,

136
00:13:21,956 --> 00:13:24,566
and are working on the cause of death.

137
00:13:25,066 --> 00:13:26,965
Regarding the news,

138
00:13:26,965 --> 00:13:29,536
her agency announced nothing is official yet,

139
00:13:29,536 --> 00:13:32,505
and so that the deceased can rest in peace,

140
00:13:32,505 --> 00:13:34,605
- they asked the media not to... - I was right.

141
00:13:35,176 --> 00:13:36,875
What was she like when you saw her?

142
00:13:39,676 --> 00:13:41,576
Urgent. Contact me immediately.

143
00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:47,215
It means she died the day after you met her.

144
00:13:47,215 --> 00:13:48,286
Right?

145
00:13:49,156 --> 00:13:51,725
Gosh. You must feel horrible.

146
00:13:54,926 --> 00:13:57,595
- Hello? - You met Cha Eun Sae two days ago?

147
00:13:57,595 --> 00:13:58,826
Come to my office now.

148
00:14:01,566 --> 00:14:04,865
She gave you no information at all?

149
00:14:05,465 --> 00:14:08,135
You said she wanted to meet to give you a tip-off.

150
00:14:08,475 --> 00:14:09,576
There's really nothing?

151
00:14:09,576 --> 00:14:10,806
It was a prank.

152
00:14:11,105 --> 00:14:12,605
She needed someone to talk to.

153
00:14:13,145 --> 00:14:14,946
I thought we had a scoop.

154
00:14:16,176 --> 00:14:18,985
But then, her murder is a scoop.

155
00:14:19,786 --> 00:14:21,615
Work on something...

156
00:14:21,615 --> 00:14:23,286
that'll get us the highest rating ever.

157
00:14:23,286 --> 00:14:24,725
It might be your last show.

158
00:14:26,556 --> 00:14:28,026
They got a one-month replacement...

159
00:14:28,026 --> 00:14:29,495
for the nine o'clock news presenter.

160
00:14:29,495 --> 00:14:31,196
They'll announce the next permanent presenter next month.

161
00:14:31,196 --> 00:14:34,395
You want to use this chance to appeal to the big boss.

162
00:14:34,635 --> 00:14:35,735
Don't you?

163
00:14:37,235 --> 00:14:38,836
If it's too much for you,

164
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:40,336
I'll give the job to Ji Ho.

165
00:14:42,364 --> 00:14:45,064
I'll work on the Cha murder after the marriage con story.

166
00:14:45,064 --> 00:14:46,104
Leave it alone.

167
00:15:03,783 --> 00:15:06,053
(Main entrance 01F-01, Basement 02F-03)

168
00:15:07,484 --> 00:15:10,824
Are you sure these are the only cameras that were working?

169
00:15:10,923 --> 00:15:11,964
Yes.

00:15:23,403 --> 00:15:25,873
What? Is it about Cha Eun Sae's death?

173
00:15:25,873 --> 00:15:29,444
Yes. I want the visitor list for Leaders Palace yesterday.

174
00:15:29,444 --> 00:15:31,344
The cameras have too many blind spots.

175
00:15:31,643 --> 00:15:33,184
Collect all the phone GPS signals.

(National Forensic Service)

177
00:15:40,454 --> 00:15:42,854
- It was murder, right? - Yes.

178
00:15:42,854 --> 00:15:44,694
There are slight defense wounds on her arm.

179
00:15:45,763 --> 00:15:48,763
Dead by excessive bleeding from a ruptured abdominal aorta.

180
00:15:48,893 --> 00:15:49,994
Estimated time of death...

181
00:15:49,994 --> 00:15:52,403
is between 5pm and 8pm on October 6.

182
00:15:54,064 --> 00:15:55,773
Same cause of death as Jin Myung Sook?

183
00:15:56,533 --> 00:15:58,574
If you're stabbed in the stomach with something,

184
00:15:58,574 --> 00:16:00,574
it usually causes excessive bleeding.

185
00:16:04,984 --> 00:16:05,984
What's the width?

186
00:16:05,984 --> 00:16:07,383
Based on the length,

187
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:10,484
the knife wasn't much bigger than a fruit knife.

188
00:16:12,883 --> 00:16:14,694
That's identical to the Jin case too.

189
00:16:16,553 --> 00:16:17,793
How many wounds were there?

190
00:16:17,793 --> 00:16:20,694
You said Jin was stabbed again in the same spot.

191
00:16:20,923 --> 00:16:23,594
Now that you mention it, that's identical as well.

192
00:16:23,793 --> 00:16:26,663
The killer stabbed Cha in the same spot again too?

193
00:16:29,434 --> 00:16:31,803
Are the two cases connected?

194
00:16:31,803 --> 00:16:32,803
No.

195
00:16:32,803 --> 00:16:35,314
How could a housekeeper's and a celebrity's deaths be connected?

196
00:16:35,314 --> 00:16:37,074
Two murders in a row...

197
00:16:37,074 --> 00:16:40,214
got him more sensitive than my wife with three kids.

198
00:16:40,214 --> 00:16:41,783
You know I'm sensitive.

199
00:16:41,783 --> 00:16:44,553
Why haven't you brought me Jin's bank statements yet?

200
00:16:44,553 --> 00:16:46,883
Sorry. I'll get them for you right away.

201
00:16:51,893 --> 00:16:53,623
Shall I tell you something shocking?

202
00:16:54,663 --> 00:16:55,964
Did you find drugs?

203
00:16:55,964 --> 00:16:57,633
She was three months pregnant.

204
00:16:58,564 --> 00:16:59,663
Cha Eun Sae.

205
00:17:00,033 --> 00:17:01,064
What?

206
00:17:14,214 --> 00:17:16,783
It has to be a grudge plus love combo.

207
00:17:16,783 --> 00:17:18,884
Get Cha's medical records and call history.

208
00:17:18,884 --> 00:17:19,924
Got it.

209
00:17:32,563 --> 00:17:34,934
Hey, my baby called.

210
00:17:37,103 --> 00:17:39,503
We'll issue a statement soon.

211
00:17:40,174 --> 00:17:42,144
I know a little about the scene.

212
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:44,684
I just need a yes-or-no answer to check some facts.

213
00:17:45,783 --> 00:17:46,884
You have five minutes.

214
00:17:47,184 --> 00:17:50,484
I heard Cha was stabbed in the stomach.

215
00:17:50,484 --> 00:17:51,823
So she was murdered, right?

216
00:17:53,224 --> 00:17:54,484
What's the estimated time of death?

217
00:17:54,484 --> 00:17:56,994
Between 5pm and 8pm on October 6.

218
00:17:58,694 --> 00:18:00,394
Did you find anything crucial...

219
00:18:00,394 --> 00:18:01,894
at the scene like a weapon or prints?

220
00:18:02,194 --> 00:18:04,464
Do you have a suspect? Have you identified someone?

221
00:18:05,563 --> 00:18:07,204
The body was found at dawn today.

222
00:18:07,204 --> 00:18:09,073
How could we have a suspect already?

223
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:12,874
I heard something off the record.

224
00:18:13,603 --> 00:18:14,644
Was Cha Eun Sae...

225
00:18:15,343 --> 00:18:16,773
really pregnant?

226
00:18:18,843 --> 00:18:19,944
Who told you that?

227
00:18:22,253 --> 00:18:23,454
Thanks for your cooperation.

228
00:18:23,654 --> 00:18:25,154
Wait. Who told you?

229
00:18:25,154 --> 00:18:26,954
I gave you something and I want something back.

230
00:18:27,253 --> 00:18:29,154
How could a reporter know unless I got a tip-off?

231
00:18:44,434 --> 00:18:46,444
I love your husband.

232
00:18:46,744 --> 00:18:48,613
And your husband loves me back.

233
00:19:00,853 --> 00:19:01,894
Welcome home.

234
00:19:02,553 --> 00:19:03,593
You must be hungry.

235
00:19:05,063 --> 00:19:06,063
I'm almost done.

236
00:19:13,434 --> 00:19:14,704
I'm sorry.

237
00:19:15,103 --> 00:19:18,904
I won't drink like that again. Don't be mad. Please?

238
00:19:19,974 --> 00:19:21,043
Cha Eun Sae...

239
00:19:22,414 --> 00:19:23,944
Did you read the article about her murder?

240
00:19:24,984 --> 00:19:26,013
Yes.

241
00:19:32,224 --> 00:19:33,624
Cha Eun Sae gave this to me.

242
00:19:41,894 --> 00:19:44,734
The day before she died, she called me. So we met.

243
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:46,934
Here's what she told me.

244
00:19:47,503 --> 00:19:49,404
That you and Cha Eun Sae were in love.

245
00:19:49,404 --> 00:19:50,474
She asked me to divorce you.

246
00:19:51,674 --> 00:19:54,503
- What? - Was she telling the truth?

247
00:19:59,513 --> 00:20:00,583
Cha Eun Sae...

248
00:20:03,954 --> 00:20:05,154
said that?

249
00:20:05,253 --> 00:20:07,083
She must have told me that for a reason.

250
00:20:08,894 --> 00:20:09,924
Did you...

251
00:20:12,593 --> 00:20:13,624
cheat on me with her?

252
00:20:21,164 --> 00:20:22,234
Hold on.

253
00:20:44,023 --> 00:20:45,323
Cha Eun Sae gave this to me.

254
00:20:50,134 --> 00:20:51,164
(Congratulations on publishing your novel.)

255
00:20:51,164 --> 00:20:52,164
(I'd like to give this present in person, but...)

256
00:20:52,164 --> 00:20:53,303
I met her once last year...

257
00:20:53,303 --> 00:20:54,303
at my publishing house's get-together.

258
00:20:54,303 --> 00:20:55,333
(So I'm sending it to you via courier. From Cha Eun Sae)

259
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:56,603
She was offered to publish an essay.

260
00:20:57,003 --> 00:20:58,773
Afterward, she asked around to get my phone number.

261
00:20:59,103 --> 00:21:00,573
She texted me she was lonely and asked me to buy her a drink.

262
00:21:00,573 --> 00:21:02,043
She hit on me which made me uncomfortable.

263
00:21:02,813 --> 00:21:03,874
When I published my book,

264
00:21:03,874 --> 00:21:06,113
she sent me cologne and this card to my publishing house.

265
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:07,613
A few days ago,

266
00:21:08,613 --> 00:21:10,353
I cleaned my study. That's when I found it.

267
00:21:12,053 --> 00:21:15,323
Cha Eun Sae thought you were in love when you met only once last year?

268
00:21:17,424 --> 00:21:18,894
I blocked her number...

269
00:21:18,894 --> 00:21:20,363
because she kept calling me like a nuisance.

270
00:21:22,734 --> 00:21:23,863
This is her number.

271
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:26,263
(Block numbers, unblock)

272
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:29,134
I couldn't tell you because I didn't want you to worry.

273
00:21:29,704 --> 00:21:31,204
That was over a year ago.

274
00:21:31,204 --> 00:21:32,674
I can't believe she said such nonsense to you.

275
00:21:33,303 --> 00:21:34,843
I'm so shocked that I'm speechless.

276
00:21:37,273 --> 00:21:38,313
You...

277
00:21:39,783 --> 00:21:41,414
really didn't cheat on me with her?

278
00:21:42,313 --> 00:21:43,553
I showed you everything.

279
00:21:44,813 --> 00:21:47,484
I explained what happened. But are you still suspecting me?

280
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:50,124
She gave me her sonogram. How could I not suspect you?

281
00:21:50,124 --> 00:21:51,194
Jung Won.

282
00:21:52,624 --> 00:21:53,624
How could you believe that...

283
00:21:53,624 --> 00:21:55,563
I cheated on you with another woman and knocked her up at that too?

284
00:21:55,563 --> 00:21:56,664
If that wasn't true,

285
00:21:57,033 --> 00:21:58,704
why would Cha Eun Sae say that you did?

286
00:21:58,704 --> 00:22:00,503
That's what I would like to ask her!

287
00:22:00,964 --> 00:22:02,634
If she wasn't dead,

288
00:22:05,204 --> 00:22:06,874
I would like to ask her why she said such a crazy thing...

289
00:22:06,874 --> 00:22:09,244
like that. It's me who wants to confront her.

290
00:22:16,384 --> 00:22:17,613
I don't know...

291
00:22:19,624 --> 00:22:22,023
what more I can do to prove to you that what she said isn't true.

292
00:22:22,124 --> 00:22:24,694
What should I do? You tell me.

293
00:22:25,793 --> 00:22:26,924
Yesterday afternoon,

294
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:29,934
why did you go to the marriage counseling clinic?

295
00:22:31,033 --> 00:22:32,134
Did you follow me?

296
00:22:32,134 --> 00:22:33,404
Why did you go to the clinic?

297
00:22:36,474 --> 00:22:38,073
I went to see a psychiatrist for depression.

298
00:22:39,843 --> 00:22:41,204
I was told my loneliness was the cause.

299
00:22:44,573 --> 00:22:46,384
My psychiatrist said I needed to be treated,

300
00:22:46,384 --> 00:22:47,613
so I've been seeing my psychiatrist for a month.

301
00:22:51,013 --> 00:22:53,053
Admitting that...

302
00:22:53,384 --> 00:22:56,253
I am a weak human being is embarrassing,

303
00:22:58,293 --> 00:22:59,293
and I hate it too.

304
00:23:18,273 --> 00:23:20,684
Oh, that necklace. It's from Herzeus, right?

305
00:23:21,083 --> 00:23:22,283
It's so pretty.

306
00:23:22,654 --> 00:23:24,283
My husband got it for me.

307
00:23:24,283 --> 00:23:25,353
We're in a relationship.

308
00:23:25,583 --> 00:23:27,783
He bought this necklace for me too.

309
00:23:30,494 --> 00:23:33,894
She even lied about the necklace because she was obsessed with him.

310
00:24:03,394 --> 00:24:04,454
What are you looking for?

311
00:24:04,924 --> 00:24:06,894
I can't find the necklace you bought for me.

312
00:24:09,593 --> 00:24:11,063
You thought you had lost the bracelet...

313
00:24:11,904 --> 00:24:14,204
I bought for you, but it was in your office.

314
00:24:16,573 --> 00:24:18,134
I should look for it once I go to work.

315
00:24:20,103 --> 00:24:22,174
I made the vegetable juice for you. Drink it before you go.

316
00:24:25,144 --> 00:24:26,184
It's my fault.

317
00:24:31,214 --> 00:24:33,484
I didn't know that you were that lonely.

318
00:24:34,283 --> 00:24:35,724
I had been too inattentive.

319
00:24:36,994 --> 00:24:38,394
I know it won't be easy,

320
00:24:38,593 --> 00:24:41,833
but I'll try my best to make time for you from now on.

321
00:24:43,533 --> 00:24:44,664
It's not your fault.

322
00:24:46,664 --> 00:24:49,404
It's all because I'm pathetic and weak.

323
00:24:50,404 --> 00:24:51,674
Don't say that.

324
00:24:52,343 --> 00:24:53,904
You're making me feel sorrier about this.

325
00:24:57,013 --> 00:24:59,144
Of course, you ought to be sorry.

326
00:24:59,613 --> 00:25:01,244
Do you know how much it cost to buy that necklace?

327
00:25:05,823 --> 00:25:07,753
Goodness.

328
00:25:22,374 --> 00:25:24,974
(Investigative Planning Team)

329
00:25:42,654 --> 00:25:43,753
- Okay? - I got it.

330
00:25:47,093 --> 00:25:49,563
This isn't your home. You should learn to knock.

331
00:25:49,593 --> 00:25:51,563
I have nothing to say to a thief who stole my project.

332
00:25:52,704 --> 00:25:54,704
You said you had a lot on your plate.

333
00:25:55,103 --> 00:25:58,134
I heard that you couldn't even start investigating Cha Eun Sae's case.

334
00:25:58,404 --> 00:26:01,503
I obtained confidential information about her case. So choose.

335
00:26:01,874 --> 00:26:03,474
Is it me or him?

336
00:26:06,144 --> 00:26:07,244
Should I leave?

337
00:26:15,954 --> 00:26:16,954
Get out.

338
00:26:17,124 --> 00:26:18,593
- What? - Out.

339
00:26:42,214 --> 00:26:44,283
What's this confidential information about her case?

340
00:26:47,023 --> 00:26:49,353
Cha Eun Sae was pregnant.

341
00:26:50,224 --> 00:26:52,093
Gosh. Really?

342
00:26:53,494 --> 00:26:54,563
Once this gets out,

343
00:26:54,563 --> 00:26:56,063
it will go down in history as the most shocking scoop.

344
00:26:56,134 --> 00:26:57,394
I told you to leave it alone.

345
00:26:57,563 --> 00:26:59,404
If you keep testing the waters, I won't let it slide.

346
00:27:05,904 --> 00:27:07,444
Then we'll begin.

347
00:27:09,474 --> 00:27:13,083
How did you meet your husband? Tell us how you two got married.

348
00:27:15,513 --> 00:27:17,613
We met at a club event.

349
00:27:21,053 --> 00:27:23,353
I was attracted to him because he was sweet and kind.

350
00:27:24,654 --> 00:27:26,964
Until that incident took place after we got married,

351
00:27:27,624 --> 00:27:28,934
he was the perfect husband.

352
00:27:33,164 --> 00:27:34,204
Let me give you a piggyback ride.

353
00:27:34,404 --> 00:27:35,674
You look gorgeous.

354
00:27:35,833 --> 00:27:36,874
It's Seo Jung Won.

355
00:27:43,644 --> 00:27:46,414
When he was taking a shower, I heard a phone vibrate.

356
00:27:46,984 --> 00:27:49,214
Your phone's ringing. I hear it vibrating.

357
00:27:49,214 --> 00:27:50,283
It's not mine.

358
00:27:51,083 --> 00:27:54,384
I found his second phone in his bag. Then I figured out everything.

359
00:27:55,424 --> 00:27:57,823
Oh, it must be our upstairs neighbor's phone.

360
00:27:58,053 --> 00:27:59,694
I heard it a few days ago too.

361
00:28:00,494 --> 00:28:03,833
That his name and his family were all fake.

362
00:28:07,103 --> 00:28:11,474
It's infuriating that of all people, I was betrayed by my own husband.

363
00:28:13,273 --> 00:28:14,974
I can neither trust...

364
00:28:15,974 --> 00:28:17,773
nor meet anyone now.

365
00:28:21,644 --> 00:28:24,384
You've taken a step forward by bravely reporting this to us.

366
00:28:24,613 --> 00:28:26,484
You can get your life back once your husband gets caught.

367
00:28:27,583 --> 00:28:28,694
I'll help you.

368
00:28:36,505 --> 00:28:37,675
Hey, guys.

369
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:41,053
What brother live streams...

370
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:43,023
from his sister's funeral? But you know what?

371
00:28:43,323 --> 00:28:46,823
I want more people to see this.

372
00:28:46,823 --> 00:28:48,252
I believe it's my duty.

373
00:28:48,252 --> 00:28:51,063
That's how I feel as her brother, so I hope you all understand. Yes.

374
00:28:51,293 --> 00:28:53,293
It'd be nice if you could subscribe to my channel and like the video.

375
00:28:53,293 --> 00:28:54,662
- Yes. - Could you stop that for a moment?

376
00:28:54,662 --> 00:28:58,002
I have to greet a guest. One moment, guys.

00:29:05,273 --> 00:29:06,813
Are you the detective in charge of the case?

380
00:29:07,073 --> 00:29:08,212
Yes, I am.

381
00:29:08,573 --> 00:29:10,712
Could you visit the police station after the funeral?

382
00:29:11,283 --> 00:29:12,853
We need to interview you as one of the witnesses.

383
00:29:13,182 --> 00:29:14,283
As a witness?

384
00:29:14,783 --> 00:29:16,722
Sure. If you need me, I'll be there.

385
00:29:17,752 --> 00:29:20,152
You probably know the passcode for the door at Cha Eun Sae's place.

386
00:29:20,853 --> 00:29:23,293
It looks like I have to work late again today.

387
00:29:23,863 --> 00:29:25,462
Hey, why are you getting mad at me?

388
00:29:25,462 --> 00:29:27,692
Okay, all right.

389
00:29:28,662 --> 00:29:30,363
I hope you were waiting for me with the footage from the parking lot...

390
00:29:30,363 --> 00:29:31,962
and the vehicle entry and exit records.

391
00:29:31,962 --> 00:29:33,232
There was nothing important.

392
00:29:33,232 --> 00:29:34,833
Cha's manager and her brother were the only visitors.

393
00:29:34,932 --> 00:29:36,702
Then I guess her boyfriend didn't bring his car...

394
00:29:36,702 --> 00:29:38,273
or gave a different unit number if he visited her.

395
00:29:38,942 --> 00:29:40,642
What about the analysis on the necklace?

396
00:29:40,642 --> 00:29:42,343
The only thing they found was Cha Eun Sae's blood.

397
00:29:42,343 --> 00:29:43,813
They can tell that it's an expensive necklace,

398
00:29:43,813 --> 00:29:46,113
but there was no pendant, so it'll take some time.

399
00:29:48,313 --> 00:29:50,722
Anyway, why are you wearing a suit? Did you have a blind date?

400
00:29:50,722 --> 00:29:52,123
I did make a move on someone.

401
00:29:59,232 --> 00:30:01,633
I hear Cha Eun Sae's brother is an attention-seeking YouTuber.

402
00:30:02,103 --> 00:30:04,002
Gosh, I watched a few of his videos.

403
00:30:04,002 --> 00:30:05,633
He just talks about his sister and tries to provoke people.

404
00:30:05,633 --> 00:30:07,073
They're boring.

409

How long do they keep the security footage stored?

410
00:30:53,583 --> 00:30:55,083
For a week. Why?

411
00:30:55,482 --> 00:30:57,452
This cake. She was a celebrity who had to watch her diet.

412
00:30:57,452 --> 00:30:59,553
Do you think she bought this to eat it by herself?

413
00:31:00,053 --> 00:31:01,853
Or did a visitor pick this up for her?

414
00:31:10,902 --> 00:31:14,232
Who records a vlog at their sister's funeral?

415
00:31:14,303 --> 00:31:15,702
Is he a psychopath or just a lunatic?

416
00:31:15,702 --> 00:31:17,543
Probably both.

417
00:31:18,442 --> 00:31:20,843
Who brought the cake? Let me find you.

418
00:31:21,043 --> 00:31:24,043

421
00:31:30,853 --> 00:31:32,422
you'll be surprised as if you've seen a ghost.

424
00:31:47,633 --> 00:31:50,972
I found his second phone in his bag. Then I figured out everything.

00:31:53,013 --> 00:31:54,773
I heard a phone vibrate.

426
00:31:55,783 --> 00:31:59,083
I found his second phone in his bag. Then I figured out everything.

427
00:31:59,652 --> 00:32:04,422
That his name and his family were all fake.

428
00:32:05,853 --> 00:32:08,992
He took out loans using the phone in my name and my credit card...

429
00:32:09,492 --> 00:32:11,922
and was a con man who had been married three times,

430
00:32:11,922 --> 00:32:13,133

438
00:32:40,452 --> 00:32:41,922
I'll need the numbers too.

439
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:45,462

440
00:32:46,192 --> 00:32:49,303

445
00:33:09,152 --> 00:33:11,223

00:33:51,163 --> 00:33:52,363
I picked it up.

451
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:54,763
Why didn't you tell me you went to her place to hang out with her?

452
00:33:54,763 --> 00:33:56,163
I didn't go there to hang out.

453
00:33:56,163 --> 00:33:58,133
She called me there saying she had a tip-off.

454
00:33:58,332 --> 00:34:00,172
So, she had your number.

455
00:34:00,172 --> 00:34:02,203
No, she said she'd asked her manager...

456
00:34:02,203 --> 00:34:03,743
to get my number.

457
00:34:03,743 --> 00:34:05,672
So, she called you for the first time that day,

458
00:34:06,243 --> 00:34:07,573
and you met her for the first time?

459
00:34:08,372 --> 00:34:10,982
She'd never called me before, but it was my second time meeting her.

460
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:13,352
I had met her once about a month ago.

461
00:34:17,783 --> 00:34:19,352
What was the tip-off about?

462
00:34:20,593 --> 00:34:23,292
It was a joke. She said she just wanted to befriend me.

463
00:34:23,593 --> 00:34:24,922
I was expecting a big scoop.

464
00:34:25,593 --> 00:34:26,863
I was baffled.

465
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:30,363
When we were checking the facts about Cha Eun Sae's case,

466
00:34:30,363 --> 00:34:32,973
shouldn't you have told me that you saw her the day before?

467
00:34:33,533 --> 00:34:37,172
It was nothing important, so I didn't feel the need to tell you.

468
00:34:37,843 --> 00:34:39,073
No more questions, right?

469
00:34:45,243 --> 00:34:46,383

471
00:34:55,053 --> 00:34:56,993
What was in that envelope?

472
00:34:58,863 --> 00:35:00,763
What did you say to her...

473
00:35:00,763 --> 00:35:02,062
that she slapped you in the face?

474
00:35:03,533 --> 00:35:05,062
According to the time stamps in the security footage,

475
00:35:05,402 --> 00:35:07,272
as soon as you left Cha Eun Sae's place,

476
00:35:07,272 --> 00:35:08,933
you came straight to the police station.

477
00:35:11,303 --> 00:35:13,172
When I took you home,

478
00:35:13,172 --> 00:35:14,613
you burst into tears in my car.

479
00:35:19,082 --> 00:35:21,183
You cried because of what happened between you and Cha Eun Sae, right?

480
00:35:22,352 --> 00:35:23,922
- No. - Then answer my question.

481
00:35:23,922 --> 00:35:25,223
What was in that envelope?

482
00:35:25,223 --> 00:35:26,622
And why did she slap you?

483
00:35:30,462 --> 00:35:31,823
It's a personal matter,

484
00:35:32,122 --> 00:35:34,363
so I'm not obligated to answer your questions.

485
00:35:38,303 --> 00:35:40,133
At 7:30pm on October 6,

486
00:35:40,772 --> 00:35:42,703
why were you at Leaders Palace?

487
00:35:45,973 --> 00:35:47,573
You must answer this question...

488
00:35:47,573 --> 00:35:49,482
for this concerns your alibi.

489
00:35:56,553 --> 00:35:59,053
I had an appointment at You and Me Neuropsychiatric Clinic.

490
00:35:59,252 --> 00:36:02,192
Check with them if you don't believe me. Are we good now?

491
00:36:04,062 --> 00:36:06,062
Are you going to keep me here and interrogate me?

493
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:13,402
Don't you think you're standing too close to me right now?

494
00:36:48,332 --> 00:36:50,872
We only found five books at Cha Eun Sae's place,

495
00:36:54,643 --> 00:36:56,812
and they were all novels by Mr. Seol Woo Jae.

496
00:36:58,442 --> 00:37:00,852
The fierce Seo Jung Won was invited to an actress' place...

497
00:37:00,852 --> 00:37:01,913
and saw something.

498
00:37:01,913 --> 00:37:03,683
She was slapped in the face and cried.

499
00:37:04,683 --> 00:37:06,553
Was something going on between her and your husband?

500
00:37:07,453 --> 00:37:08,622
Like...

501
00:37:10,062 --> 00:37:11,292
an affair?

502
00:37:13,433 --> 00:37:14,832
I don't need to answer such an absurd question.

503
00:37:14,832 --> 00:37:17,402
If this "absurd" speculation turns out to be true,

504
00:37:17,602 --> 00:37:19,533
- shall I tell you? - Hey, watch what you say.

505
00:37:21,672 --> 00:37:22,772
You said yourself...

506
00:37:23,643 --> 00:37:26,042
that we should always address each other politely.

507
00:37:26,872 --> 00:37:29,042
Do you now want to talk casually when we're alone?

508
00:37:29,843 --> 00:37:31,343
Why? Can you not stand the fact that I,

509
00:37:31,343 --> 00:37:33,582
of all people, am interrogating you like this?

510
00:37:41,922 --> 00:37:42,993

511
00:37:45,223 --> 00:37:47,163

Give me your number.

516
00:38:17,192 --> 00:38:18,462
So you can bother me?

519
00:38:24,163 --> 00:38:25,933

I'm pleased.

525
00:38:51,062 --> 00:38:52,192
I'm single too.

we'll end up dating?

538
00:41:21,243 --> 00:41:25,082
on Jeju Island, so I'd be going away for two days.

539
00:41:35,953 --> 00:41:37,022
Hello, Father.

540
00:41:38,323 --> 00:41:39,433
Sure.

541
00:41:41,663 --> 00:41:42,863
He wants to meet for breakfast.

542
00:42:12,622 --> 00:42:15,292
Long time no see, Ms. Seo.

543
00:42:16,533 --> 00:42:19,933
Are you still upset she uncovered you last time?

544
00:42:19,973 --> 00:42:21,272
Not at all.

545
00:42:22,073 --> 00:42:23,902
Thanks to her,

546
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:26,942
I got some sense knocked into me.

547
00:42:28,243 --> 00:42:30,942
I heard you never apologized.

548
00:42:32,312 --> 00:42:34,652
I know viewer ratings are important,

549
00:42:35,252 --> 00:42:38,053
but attacking someone viciously is never a good sight.

550
00:42:39,022 --> 00:42:42,152
You should apologize for being out of line.

551
00:42:43,663 --> 00:42:44,663
Father.

552
00:42:46,263 --> 00:42:49,732
If you demand an apology in a setting like this...

553
00:42:53,703 --> 00:42:54,902
It's a shame...

554
00:42:55,402 --> 00:42:57,402
my show uncovered your shortcoming,

555
00:42:57,672 --> 00:42:58,902
but I'm not apologetic.

556
00:43:00,113 --> 00:43:03,343
I care more about the viewers' right to know than my ratings.

557
00:43:04,212 --> 00:43:06,212
If I were to grovel as if I did wrong,

558
00:43:07,212 --> 00:43:09,053
wouldn't that be more of a disgrace, Father?

559
00:43:19,093 --> 00:43:22,263
You're really something. Feisty.

560
00:43:22,763 --> 00:43:26,332
Seo Sang Gyeon was a lot like this too.

561
00:43:29,843 --> 00:43:33,343
How do you know her late father?

562
00:43:34,513 --> 00:43:37,383
We met a few times when I was a prosecutor.

563
00:43:39,852 --> 00:43:42,413
You're a lot like him.

564
00:43:52,522 --> 00:43:53,562
I'll see you again.

565
00:44:01,203 --> 00:44:02,402
Goodbye, Father.

566
00:44:22,323 --> 00:44:23,663
Give me a moment. Sorry.

567
00:44:24,823 --> 00:44:25,823
Hello.

568
00:44:28,792 --> 00:44:30,102
My late father...

569
00:44:30,102 --> 00:44:33,402
Ms. Seo. Are you happy these days?

570
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:36,203
Yes.

571
00:44:37,803 --> 00:44:39,843
You don't seem so at all.

572
00:44:41,172 --> 00:44:43,982
I think you married the wrong guy.

573
00:44:46,113 --> 00:44:47,582
Why do you think so?

574
00:44:48,812 --> 00:44:49,823
It's just...

575
00:44:51,422 --> 00:44:52,453
a hunch.

576
00:45:05,633 --> 00:45:06,633
Sorry.

577
00:45:07,732 --> 00:45:09,332
Yes. That's fine.

578
00:45:15,413 --> 00:45:17,582
Sir. It's Kim Tae Heon, the detective.

579
00:45:21,013 --> 00:45:22,252
Hello, it's Kim Tae Heon.

580
00:45:22,482 --> 00:45:24,422
I asked Mr. Song to put me through,

581
00:45:24,422 --> 00:45:25,852
and he told me to call at 1pm.

582
00:45:26,252 --> 00:45:28,152
Is this about my housekeeper's death?

583
00:45:28,393 --> 00:45:29,962
Yes. We took a look...

584
00:45:30,192 --> 00:45:32,763
at her bank statements and transactions.

585
00:45:32,893 --> 00:45:34,663
The day after she got paid,

586
00:45:34,663 --> 00:45:37,402
she withdrew most of the money, which is quite odd.

587
00:45:37,863 --> 00:45:39,902
Did she? Was she in debt?

588
00:45:40,002 --> 00:45:41,102
No, she wasn't.

589
00:45:41,573 --> 00:45:45,272
Did she tell you anything about what it was for,

590
00:45:45,442 --> 00:45:48,113
or did she ask you for a loan?

591
00:45:48,312 --> 00:45:49,613
No, she didn't.

592
00:45:51,283 --> 00:45:53,283
What did she spend that on?

593
00:45:53,613 --> 00:45:55,652
We're stuck because she knew very few people.

594
00:45:56,183 --> 00:45:57,823
Please ask your daughter.

595
00:45:57,922 --> 00:45:58,922
I will.

596
00:46:00,652 --> 00:46:03,593
How dare he tell me what to do?

597
00:46:04,163 --> 00:46:05,763
How frustrating.

598
00:46:06,593 --> 00:46:07,993
There's no call history,

599
00:46:07,993 --> 00:46:09,732
and she withdrew most of her pay.

600
00:46:10,033 --> 00:46:14,133
Where do you think Jin spent all her hard-earned money?

601
00:46:15,832 --> 00:46:16,902
Was she gambling?

602
00:46:17,002 --> 00:46:19,203
Or was she paying off a blackmailer?

603
00:46:21,812 --> 00:46:23,243
When we questioned Assemblyman Mo.

604
00:46:24,413 --> 00:46:26,982
Do you remember how he reacted when we showed him...

605
00:46:27,383 --> 00:46:28,712
Jin's scrapbook of his articles?

606
00:46:31,022 --> 00:46:35,152
Are you aware Ms. Jin collected articles about you?

607
00:46:35,152 --> 00:46:36,663
(Prosecutor Mo Hyung Taek selected as Top 10 teen role model)

608
00:46:36,663 --> 00:46:37,893
No, not at all.

609
00:46:38,393 --> 00:46:40,732
Why did she collect stuff about me?

610
00:46:43,303 --> 00:46:46,332
Did he not know or did he pretend not to know?

611
00:46:47,232 --> 00:46:48,933
If he's hiding something,

612
00:46:49,372 --> 00:46:52,442
is it that they're getting up to no good in secret?

613
00:46:54,772 --> 00:46:56,743
Let's follow the trail we have right now.

614
00:47:02,053 --> 00:47:03,183
Excuse us.

615
00:47:04,522 --> 00:47:05,922
Can you confirm something for us?

616
00:47:05,953 --> 00:47:07,122
What do you need?

617
00:47:07,223 --> 00:47:08,622
We're from Gangha Police Station.

618
00:47:09,053 --> 00:47:11,062

621
00:47:17,232 --> 00:47:20,872
Ms. Seo came in on October 6 at 7:44pm,

622
00:47:20,872 --> 00:47:22,473
and she paid at 8:30pm.

623

(Consultation: Complete, Time and date of payment)

624
00:47:25,602 --> 00:47:26,643
So...

625
00:47:26,712 --> 00:47:29,883
why do you want to know what time Ms. Seo came in?

626
00:47:30,482 --> 00:47:32,812
It's just one of those things we always do. Thanks.

627
00:47:33,082 --> 00:47:34,082
Sure.

Gosh, I'm in a bad mood.

630
00:47:49,363 --> 00:47:51,663
Look at that. You drive a nice car.

631
00:47:59,172 --> 00:48:00,913
Oh, hello.

632
00:48:22,232 --> 00:48:23,502
I'll begin the interview now.

633
00:48:24,102 --> 00:48:25,133
Sure.

Mr. Cha Geum Sae.

635
00:48:26,902 --> 00:48:29,203
What did you do on the day of Cha Eun Sae's death?

636
00:48:29,602 --> 00:48:30,743
Well,

637
00:48:31,372 --> 00:48:33,272
I worked out all day.

638
00:48:33,272 --> 00:48:37,082
I met up with my buddies at night and had drinks. That's it.

639
00:48:37,082 --> 00:48:38,783
Did you go to Leaders Palace?

640
00:48:39,212 --> 00:48:40,212
No.

641
00:48:40,812 --> 00:48:41,913
But you did.

642
00:48:44,883 --> 00:48:46,553
(Basement 02F-03)

643
00:48:57,033 --> 00:48:59,133
You know, I've been parking my car...

644
00:48:59,133 --> 00:49:01,502
at Eun Sae's office building lately...

645
00:49:01,502 --> 00:49:03,102
and riding my bicycle afterward.

646
00:49:03,402 --> 00:49:04,803
Then did you go to your sister's office...

647
00:49:04,803 --> 00:49:06,812
after parking your car on the day of the incident?

648
00:49:07,042 --> 00:49:08,143
No.

649
00:49:08,542 --> 00:49:11,413
She told me not to visit her. She even made a ruckus about it.

650
00:49:11,542 --> 00:49:14,113
So I've been to her office...

651
00:49:14,413 --> 00:49:15,513
only once.

652
00:49:17,883 --> 00:49:20,823
But I did use the first-floor restroom that day.

653
00:49:21,093 --> 00:49:22,622
Riding the bicycle is such a great activity,

654
00:49:23,223 --> 00:49:25,922
- but my bladder... - Did you ride the bicycle alone?

655
00:49:26,263 --> 00:49:29,263
Yes. You must ride the bicycle alone to truly enjoy it.

656
00:49:29,962 --> 00:49:31,402
Besides, it's difficult...

657
00:49:31,402 --> 00:49:33,473
for regular people to keep up with me.

658
00:49:33,473 --> 00:49:35,973
On top of that, I have thighs...

659
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:37,303
as muscular as a horse.

660
00:49:37,303 --> 00:49:38,542
You know, like Son Heung Min.

661
00:49:43,113 --> 00:49:44,812
Just answer my questions only.

662
00:49:48,953 --> 00:49:50,883
On the day of the incident, when did you start and finish...

663
00:49:51,723 --> 00:49:52,852
riding your bicycle?

664
00:49:53,422 --> 00:49:55,792
I parked my car at 4pm.

665
00:49:55,953 --> 00:49:58,263
Was I gone for about three hours? Well, I'm not sure.

666
00:49:58,263 --> 00:49:59,323
You have a gambling debt, don't you?

667
00:50:01,863 --> 00:50:02,993
Gambling?

668
00:50:04,602 --> 00:50:06,902
I just played a few rounds for fun. That's all.

669
00:50:06,902 --> 00:50:09,102
You live in a low-rise apartment in Onjeong-dong.

670
00:50:09,102 --> 00:50:10,102
You fell behind on your rent,

671
00:50:10,102 --> 00:50:11,573
so you used up the security deposit you put down.

672
00:50:12,602 --> 00:50:14,872
I was going to move into Eun Sae's house soon.

673
00:50:14,872 --> 00:50:17,183
Getting the deposit back was a hassle, so I didn't pay rent.

674
00:50:17,643 --> 00:50:18,942
You were going to move into her house?

675
00:50:19,883 --> 00:50:21,082
You sound...

676
00:50:21,082 --> 00:50:23,252
as if you already knew that she was going to die.

677
00:50:23,252 --> 00:50:24,283
What?

678
00:50:29,522 --> 00:50:31,122
Eun Sae and I talked...

679
00:50:31,122 --> 00:50:33,593
about moving in together even before she died. Okay?

680
00:50:33,593 --> 00:50:34,593
Didn't you say she made a ruckus...

681
00:50:34,593 --> 00:50:36,663
to prevent you from visiting her at her office?

682
00:50:36,663 --> 00:50:39,062
But you just told me you were going to move in together.

683
00:50:39,433 --> 00:50:41,602
Come on. Are you kidding me?

684
00:50:41,602 --> 00:50:43,272
Are you suspecting me?

685
00:50:43,743 --> 00:50:45,672
How could a police officer suspect...

686
00:50:45,672 --> 00:50:48,143
the victim's own brother when he had lost his only sister?

687
00:50:48,143 --> 00:50:51,143
Is this how police officers treat the bereaved family? Seriously?

688
00:50:51,143 --> 00:50:52,942
Cha Eun Sae was pregnant.

689
00:50:55,852 --> 00:50:56,883
Did you know that?

690
00:50:58,053 --> 00:51:00,493
This meant Cha Eun Sae was seeing someone.

691
00:51:00,493 --> 00:51:02,022
Can you think of anyone?

692
00:51:08,093 --> 00:51:11,303
I have an appointment. I must get going now.

693
00:51:11,303 --> 00:51:12,962
You know the novelist, Seol Woo Jae, right?

694
00:51:13,502 --> 00:51:15,073
He's been on TV quite a lot.

695
00:51:16,402 --> 00:51:18,502
The lady who hosts "Nothing Exposed" or something?

696
00:51:18,502 --> 00:51:19,843
Are you talking about Seo Jung Won's husband?

697
00:51:20,672 --> 00:51:22,013
Did your sister and Seol Woo Jae...

698
00:51:22,643 --> 00:51:24,243
know each other?

699
00:51:30,683 --> 00:51:31,883
Mr. Detective.

700
00:51:36,053 --> 00:51:38,363
How would I know that?

701
00:51:39,562 --> 00:51:40,562
Seriously.

Your husband runs a one-person publishing corporation,

707
00:52:10,863 --> 00:52:12,622
and a phone is registered...

708
00:52:12,622 --> 00:52:13,763
under his corporation.

709
00:52:16,433 --> 00:52:17,962
I didn't think that far.

710
00:52:18,663 --> 00:52:19,703
What's the number?

711
00:52:20,732 --> 00:52:23,172
Zero, one, zero, zero, two, three, four, seven, eight, two, seven.

712
00:52:25,002 --> 00:52:26,542
Can you track the location of the phone?

713
00:52:33,783 --> 00:52:34,812
It's turned off.

714
00:52:38,522 --> 00:52:41,323
Let's say he used the second phone to communicate with only one person.

715
00:52:41,323 --> 00:52:43,763
But if he can't reach that person anymore,

716
00:52:43,763 --> 00:52:45,393
he wouldn't carry that. Right?

717
00:52:46,093 --> 00:52:47,133
Probably.

718
00:52:49,433 --> 00:52:50,863
I'll wire your service fee.

719
00:53:34,372 --> 00:53:37,113
Hold on. Can I take a closer look at that?

It will take at least 2 to 3 days.

725
00:54:45,683 --> 00:54:47,252
Call me as soon as you restore the data.

726
00:54:47,252 --> 00:54:48,352
You got it.

727
00:55:04,144 --> 00:55:05,144
Eun Sae said...

728
00:55:05,644 --> 00:55:08,914
she would pay my last month's salary with this month's salary.

729
00:55:10,184 --> 00:55:12,215
So what?

730
00:55:12,215 --> 00:55:15,255
Do I look like I'm Cha Eun Sae? Seriously. This is ridiculous.

731
00:55:15,255 --> 00:55:16,385
Gosh.

732
00:55:16,624 --> 00:55:18,255
My fist is itching...

733
00:55:21,565 --> 00:55:23,295
to land a punch. You know?

734
00:55:27,034 --> 00:55:28,604
Your sister's manager is asking for her salary.

735
00:55:28,965 --> 00:55:30,374
You shouldn't dismiss her request.

736
00:55:30,505 --> 00:55:33,005
I have already answered all of your questions. Seriously.

737
00:55:33,005 --> 00:55:34,244
What's this now?

738
00:55:35,304 --> 00:55:36,374
I'm not here for you.

739
00:55:36,505 --> 00:55:38,345
I'm here to talk to her today.

740
00:55:39,215 --> 00:55:41,615
We talked on the phone earlier. Do you have some time to talk?

741
00:55:42,815 --> 00:55:43,854
Let's go.

742
00:55:47,554 --> 00:55:48,624
Gosh.

743
00:55:49,684 --> 00:55:50,994
I'll keep my questions brief.

744
00:55:50,994 --> 00:55:52,724
You can just answer them. No need to be nervous.

745
00:55:53,965 --> 00:55:54,994
Gosh.

746
00:55:56,624 --> 00:55:57,635
Here you go.

747
00:56:00,565 --> 00:56:01,635
What about me?

748
00:56:05,235 --> 00:56:06,335
Please go ahead.

749
00:56:07,704 --> 00:56:09,945
Did you know anything about Cha Eun Sae's personal life?

750
00:56:09,945 --> 00:56:11,045
Like...

751
00:56:11,615 --> 00:56:13,244
a man she was seeing romantically.

752
00:56:14,784 --> 00:56:16,485
I did think she was seeing someone.

753
00:56:17,454 --> 00:56:18,914
Whenever she got a call or a text message,

754
00:56:18,914 --> 00:56:20,724
she deleted everything right away.

755
00:56:21,184 --> 00:56:24,025
Eun Sae's brother used to go through her phone.

756
00:56:24,954 --> 00:56:26,054
Really?

757
00:56:26,195 --> 00:56:29,065
Who were the men she was close to? Give us some names.

758
00:56:35,635 --> 00:56:36,835
I'm not sure.

759
00:56:37,574 --> 00:56:40,574
She rarely talked about herself. She had a lot of secrets.

760
00:56:43,244 --> 00:56:44,275
Then before you became her manager,

761
00:56:44,275 --> 00:56:45,815
Cha Geum Sae worked as her manager, right?

762
00:56:46,014 --> 00:56:47,045
Yes.

763
00:56:47,615 --> 00:56:51,414
But he was always busy gambling, so she did most things by herself.

764
00:56:51,715 --> 00:56:53,655
Earlier, you said he often went through her phone.

765
00:56:53,655 --> 00:56:55,155
I guess he liked to meddle in everything she did.

766
00:56:58,624 --> 00:56:59,755
Don't even get me started.

767
00:57:00,224 --> 00:57:02,365
He extorted money from her and harassed her very often.

768
00:57:02,894 --> 00:57:04,394
It only got worse when he was drunk.

769
00:57:05,434 --> 00:57:08,204
Two weeks ago, we almost had to call the police.

770
00:57:08,534 --> 00:57:09,534
Hey.

771
00:57:11,275 --> 00:57:13,005
Hey! You.

772
00:57:13,945 --> 00:57:16,405
Do I look like a beggar to you?

773
00:57:17,074 --> 00:57:19,775
You know what happens when I lose it.

774
00:57:21,545 --> 00:57:22,585
You little...

775
00:57:23,684 --> 00:57:26,784
I'll kill you and kill myself too, you little witch.

776
00:57:26,784 --> 00:57:27,784
A knife?

777
00:57:29,224 --> 00:57:30,454
Then it was him, for sure.

778
00:57:32,824 --> 00:57:35,965
When I think about Eun Sae, I feel so bad for her.

779
00:57:36,894 --> 00:57:38,465
Her brother was the only family she had,

780
00:57:38,534 --> 00:57:40,335
but he harassed her until the day she died.

781
00:57:48,804 --> 00:57:51,045
The investigation is going well for both cases,

782
00:57:51,215 --> 00:57:53,244
so don't worry about us. Worry about your team first.

783
00:57:53,474 --> 00:57:55,815
- All right. - You're bluffing again.

784
00:57:55,815 --> 00:57:57,414
Nothing's going well.

785
00:57:57,514 --> 00:57:58,554
Why, that little...

786
00:57:58,554 --> 00:58:01,025
What? No, it's nothing. Okay, talk soon.

787
00:58:02,784 --> 00:58:04,155
You little...

788
00:58:05,724 --> 00:58:07,295
Gosh, you nutcase.

789
00:58:07,695 --> 00:58:09,425
The fingerprints we lifted from the scene...

790
00:58:09,425 --> 00:58:11,164
all belong to Cha Eun Sae and her brother.

791
00:58:11,195 --> 00:58:12,235
What?

792
00:58:12,764 --> 00:58:15,104
None of the witnesses' fingerprints were found on the doorknobs?

793
00:58:15,335 --> 00:58:18,204
The workers were all wearing gloves.

794
00:58:18,505 --> 00:58:20,545
I can't believe they only have security cameras...

795
00:58:20,545 --> 00:58:22,545
at the main entrance and in the parking lot.

796
00:58:23,175 --> 00:58:25,514
That's why it's a perfect spot for a premeditated murder.

797
00:58:25,945 --> 00:58:27,684
You found nothing among the victim's belongings?

798
00:58:28,244 --> 00:58:29,585
You said she was holding a necklace.

799
00:58:29,815 --> 00:58:31,315
We couldn't find her phone.

800
00:58:31,684 --> 00:58:33,155
Detective Oh is getting her call log.

801
00:58:33,215 --> 00:58:34,385
My goodness.

802
00:58:35,824 --> 00:58:37,554
You interviewed Cha Geum Sae. What do you think?

803
00:58:37,854 --> 00:58:38,894
Do you think it was him?

804
00:58:39,124 --> 00:58:41,724
There's something fishy about him. He threatened her recently.

805
00:58:42,824 --> 00:58:44,494
He visited the building that day...

806
00:58:44,494 --> 00:58:46,164
and couldn't prove his alibi right away.

807
00:58:47,764 --> 00:58:49,104
You should keep on digging.

808
00:58:49,635 --> 00:58:50,635
Yes, I should.

809
00:58:52,275 --> 00:58:55,644
Hey, is it okay with you that you have to see Seo Jung Won?

810
00:58:57,445 --> 00:58:59,445
I can't avoid seeing her. She's on TV all the time.

811
00:58:59,514 --> 00:59:02,684
Goodness. You know that's not what I'm asking.

812
00:59:03,414 --> 00:59:05,485
Whether I see her or not, I'll always...

813
00:59:05,954 --> 00:59:07,454

Why? You'll get me excited?

820
00:59:27,574 --> 00:59:29,474
I went through Cha Eun Sae's call log.

821
00:59:29,604 --> 00:59:31,574
The number she called the most was...

822
00:59:33,045 --> 00:59:34,414
- Seol Woo Jae? - Yes.

823
00:59:34,414 --> 00:59:35,885
It's a one-man publishing company...

824
00:59:35,885 --> 00:59:37,585
owned by Ms. Seo's husband.

825
00:59:38,755 --> 00:59:40,014

What a jerk.

830
00:59:46,755 --> 00:59:48,865
I was wondering what was up when you were asking Cha Geum Sae about it.

831
00:59:48,865 --> 00:59:50,264
How did you figure it out?

832
00:59:50,994 --> 00:59:53,465
Contact the mobile carrier and find out if this number...

833
00:59:53,465 --> 00:59:55,835
was pinged at Leaders Palace on October 6.

01:06:06,135 --> 01:06:07,574
I'm Lieutenant Kim Tae Heon.

898
01:06:09,144 --> 01:06:10,574
Mr. Seol Woo Jae, right?

899
01:06:11,115 --> 01:06:12,144
Yes, what is this about?

900
01:06:13,215 --> 01:06:15,615
- Why are you... - This is about Cha Eun Sae's case.

901
01:06:17,755 --> 01:06:19,515
You'll have to come with me.

902
01:06:38,005 --> 01:06:40,704
(The 3rd and 4th episodes will air at 10:10pm next Monday.)

903
01:07:00,095 --> 01:07:03,225
(Nothing Uncovered)

904
01:07:03,225 --> 01:07:06,664
That day, I wanted to kill Cha Eun Sae.

905
01:07:06,664 --> 01:07:08,005
It all feels like a nightmare.

906
01:07:08,105 --> 01:07:10,505
I'm only going to ask you once. Did you do it?

907
01:07:10,505 --> 01:07:11,534
No!

908
01:07:11,774 --> 01:07:13,274
I'm sure the police...

909
01:07:13,274 --> 01:07:16,145
will focus on Cha Eun Sae's lover, convinced that he killed her.

910
01:07:16,145 --> 01:07:17,505
Cha Eun Sae was your lover, wasn't she?

911
01:07:18,015 --> 01:07:19,015
I'm a victim too.

912
01:07:19,015 --> 01:07:21,784
You know information about sponsors comes from secret sources.

913
01:07:21,784 --> 01:07:23,444
Cha Eun Sae had a sponsor, didn't she?

914
01:07:23,444 --> 01:07:26,515
- Mo Hyung Taek? - If you have a clear conscience.

915
01:07:26,515 --> 01:07:28,484
She knew she'd die.

916
01:07:28,484 --> 01:07:30,824
The two of you look so lovely together.

917
01:07:30,824 --> 01:07:32,454
Am I the only one who thinks this is suspicious?

918
01:07:32,454 --> 01:07:34,765
It'd be more natural to think that someone...

919
01:07:34,765 --> 01:07:36,425
is after one of us. Don't you agree?

920
01:07:36,425 --> 01:07:37,635
To me,

921
01:07:37,635 --> 01:07:39,364
you're the prime suspect now.
