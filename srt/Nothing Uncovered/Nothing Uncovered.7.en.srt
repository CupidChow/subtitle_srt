6
00:00:23,298 --> 00:00:26,368
Detective Kim Tae Heon. Right?

7
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:27,868
How do you know me? We've never met before.

8
00:00:27,868 --> 00:00:31,167
You visited my clinic to check Ms. Seo Jung Won's appointment records.

9
00:00:31,467 --> 00:00:34,067
I saw your face in the security footage from the waiting room.

10
00:00:39,947 --> 00:00:41,947
A police detective is paying you an unannounced visit,

11
00:00:43,677 --> 00:00:45,817
but you don't seem flustered at all.

12
00:00:50,118 --> 00:00:51,688
I knew you'd pay me a visit sooner or later...

13
00:00:53,057 --> 00:00:55,997
because Ms. Cha Eun Sae was my patient too.

14
00:00:59,097 --> 00:01:01,497
From 5pm to 8pm on October 6,

15
00:01:02,438 --> 00:01:03,538
where were you?

16
00:01:03,538 --> 00:01:04,637
October...

17
00:01:06,007 --> 00:01:07,837
That was the day when Eun Sae died, right?

18
00:01:08,007 --> 00:01:09,037
Yes.

19
00:01:09,037 --> 00:01:10,337
I was at the clinic.

20
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:12,647
You were at the clinic, alone?

21
00:01:13,548 --> 00:01:16,078
That means you can't prove your alibi.

22
00:01:19,587 --> 00:01:21,287
If you're not confident that you can find the culprit,

23
00:01:21,817 --> 00:01:23,358
create one.

24
00:01:28,927 --> 00:01:31,328
Create a culprit? Is that something to say...

25
00:01:32,067 --> 00:01:33,968
to your daughter-in-law? No, a journalist?

26
00:01:33,968 --> 00:01:37,768
If that's too much for a journalist, how about this suggestion, then?

27
00:01:38,468 --> 00:01:41,377
Why not join my company and work in PR?

28
00:01:43,078 --> 00:01:44,877
This is what you were after.

29
00:01:45,808 --> 00:01:47,448
I joined the company.

30
00:01:48,718 --> 00:01:51,087
You can bother me, but leave Jung Won alone.

31
00:01:52,748 --> 00:01:54,457
Let's go. There's nothing more to hear.

32
00:01:55,117 --> 00:01:56,158
Sit down.

33
00:02:11,237 --> 00:02:13,737
Mujin Construction got this far...

34
00:02:13,737 --> 00:02:16,038
because Mueon Resort was a success.

35
00:02:17,138 --> 00:02:19,348
With the aim of opening in 2028,

36
00:02:19,978 --> 00:02:21,448
I'll embark on a new project...

37
00:02:22,078 --> 00:02:23,578
which is a resort complex.

38
00:02:24,848 --> 00:02:26,448
If my heir and his wife are continuously implicated...

39
00:02:26,448 --> 00:02:27,987
in a murder investigation...

40
00:02:27,987 --> 00:02:30,087
That would hurt you the most...

41
00:02:30,087 --> 00:02:31,758
because the new project could collapse.

42
00:02:31,758 --> 00:02:33,888
The public sentiment online is very bad.

43
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:35,657
My people are working on it,

44
00:02:35,657 --> 00:02:38,027
but it's practically a fact that you're both killers,

45
00:02:38,027 --> 00:02:39,367
and stock prices are plummeting!

46
00:02:47,207 --> 00:02:50,478
There's a reason journalists get into PR.

47
00:02:51,048 --> 00:02:54,277
I'd like you to use your network, sources...

48
00:02:54,478 --> 00:02:56,548
and crisis management skills for Mujin Group.

49
00:02:57,348 --> 00:03:00,288
I gave my word as a journalist...

50
00:03:00,987 --> 00:03:03,318
that I'd reveal the culprit on my show.

51
00:03:05,457 --> 00:03:08,128
What if I were to expose you for deceiving the public...

52
00:03:08,128 --> 00:03:10,927
by pretending to defend your husband because of our deal?

53
00:03:12,798 --> 00:03:14,737
Truth is everything to a journalist.

54
00:03:14,937 --> 00:03:17,098
If people were to know you lied to them,

55
00:03:17,867 --> 00:03:19,867
what good would your word be?

56
00:03:20,907 --> 00:03:22,737
Father, please!

57
00:03:30,348 --> 00:03:31,848
Must you go this far?

58
00:03:41,497 --> 00:03:45,068
This is CCTV footage from the waiting room that day.

59
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:49,268
On that day, I left for a while.

60
00:03:51,707 --> 00:03:53,937
I returned at this time. And then...

61
00:03:58,378 --> 00:04:01,548
At 8:35pm I went home.

62
00:04:04,348 --> 00:04:07,858
What did you do when you were out between 16:35 and 17:50?

63
00:04:09,687 --> 00:04:11,018
I was at a nearby cafe.

64
00:04:11,427 --> 00:04:13,157
Were you there alone...

65
00:04:13,157 --> 00:04:14,328
or did you have company?

66
00:04:14,828 --> 00:04:15,927
I was with a friend.

67
00:04:15,927 --> 00:04:17,597
Can you tell me who that friend is?

68
00:04:19,628 --> 00:04:21,667
Do I have to tell you?

69
00:04:22,337 --> 00:04:23,967
I don't think it's an obligation.

70
00:04:30,308 --> 00:04:32,647
It's not an obligation to submit the CCTV footage,

71
00:04:33,448 --> 00:04:34,647
but can you give me a copy?

72
00:04:35,047 --> 00:04:36,047
Yes.

73
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:37,888
I will.

74
00:04:43,258 --> 00:04:44,318
I'm sorry.

75
00:04:45,058 --> 00:04:47,727
I can't drive you back to work.

76
00:04:48,357 --> 00:04:49,928
I'll stay and talk to my father.

77
00:04:50,998 --> 00:04:53,868
I don't want your relationship to get any worse because of me.

78
00:04:55,268 --> 00:04:57,268
I hate you getting into trouble even more.

79
00:04:59,837 --> 00:05:00,938
See you at home later.

80
00:05:35,738 --> 00:05:37,037
A few days ago,

81
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:41,417
I relapsed and medicated myself again.

82
00:05:42,477 --> 00:05:45,748
Before you expose the truth about Jung Won,

83
00:05:45,748 --> 00:05:48,217
I might expose the truth about my...

84
00:05:56,857 --> 00:06:00,828
The risk I carry is greater than that of the online sentiment.

85
00:06:02,097 --> 00:06:03,368
You shouldn't forget that.

86
00:06:04,738 --> 00:06:06,167
You have money and power...

87
00:06:06,167 --> 00:06:08,638
and your only weapon is to damage yourself?

88
00:06:15,547 --> 00:06:17,818
I must be destroyed for you to be destroyed too, Father.

89
00:06:19,688 --> 00:06:21,988
My wife Jung Won.

90
00:06:23,188 --> 00:06:24,287
Don't do anything to her.

91
00:06:25,888 --> 00:06:28,357
Unless you want to see me self-destruct.

92
00:06:31,568 --> 00:06:33,868
Sorry for ruining your musical experience.

93
00:06:49,347 --> 00:06:50,878
I looked into Yoo Yoon Young.

94
00:06:51,448 --> 00:06:52,618
It was pretty boring.

95
00:06:53,248 --> 00:06:55,857
She likes designer goods and going to clubs.

96
00:06:56,888 --> 00:06:58,357
There's nothing newsworthy?

97
00:06:58,357 --> 00:06:59,857
There's no weakness,

98
00:07:00,388 --> 00:07:01,698
but there's something else.

99
00:07:02,457 --> 00:07:04,428
Her clinic's registered in someone else's name.

100
00:07:04,868 --> 00:07:05,967
Mo Soo Rin.

101
00:07:06,727 --> 00:07:09,337
- Mo Soo Rin? - So I looked her up.

102
00:07:10,068 --> 00:07:11,508
She's Mo Hyung Taek's daughter.

103
00:07:12,868 --> 00:07:13,938
Good job.

104
00:07:18,407 --> 00:07:20,008
(Mo Hyung Taek)

105
00:07:20,008 --> 00:07:22,518
Yes. 14 years ago,

106
00:07:22,847 --> 00:07:24,847
Mo Hyung Taek's daughter would've been in Mueon too.

107
00:07:26,047 --> 00:07:27,717
(Spouse Lee Hyun Sook, Child Mo Soo Rin)

108
00:07:28,388 --> 00:07:29,518
They're the same age.

109
00:07:29,988 --> 00:07:31,787
Did they go to school together?

110
00:07:33,727 --> 00:07:35,957
Yoo Yoon Young. What on earth are you?

111
00:07:45,238 --> 00:07:48,277
Wasn't this your favorite drink?

112
00:07:50,878 --> 00:07:51,977
I think...

113
00:07:53,107 --> 00:07:55,118
the scariest people in the world...

114
00:07:56,818 --> 00:07:57,878
are journalists.

115
00:08:04,628 --> 00:08:07,727
With one scoop, they manipulate what people...

116
00:08:07,727 --> 00:08:09,227
see and hear.

117
00:08:09,657 --> 00:08:11,467
You take down presidents...

118
00:08:11,467 --> 00:08:13,868
and rewrite history.

119
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:16,837
I don't know what history you want to rewrite,

120
00:08:17,738 --> 00:08:21,238
but I don't drink that liquor anymore.

121
00:08:22,837 --> 00:08:25,878
I know very well that you've changed.

122
00:08:26,977 --> 00:08:28,847
I'm not asking you to cover something up.

123
00:08:30,248 --> 00:08:33,388
It's okay to ask you to expose something, isn't it?

124
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:46,498
There are no signs the timeline was fiddled with.

125
00:08:47,327 --> 00:08:49,037
Everything else seems fine too.

126
00:08:55,777 --> 00:08:57,807
(KCSI, Every contact leaves a trace)

(Revealing truth with the power of science)

128
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:04,748
- Hi. - Hey.

129
00:09:04,988 --> 00:09:06,147
Someone from the security office...

130
00:09:06,147 --> 00:09:08,088
filed a police report saying Kim Min Chul did it.

131
00:09:08,088 --> 00:09:09,657
A search and seizure warrant was issued.

132
00:09:10,187 --> 00:09:11,258
What?

133
00:09:35,817 --> 00:09:38,687
The last time we met, you insisted you'd lost your phone.

134
00:09:38,687 --> 00:09:39,687
You hadn't.

135
00:10:11,748 --> 00:10:13,088
- Detective Oh. - What?

136
00:10:23,027 --> 00:10:24,897
- What's that? - Kim Min Chul.

137
00:10:25,598 --> 00:10:28,167
You're under arrest for the murder of Cha Eun Sae.

138
00:10:30,167 --> 00:10:31,197
What...

139
00:10:35,277 --> 00:10:36,277
Ms. Choi.

140
00:10:36,738 --> 00:10:39,577
Does someone called Mo Soo Rin see Doctor Yoo too?

141
00:10:42,447 --> 00:10:44,618
The day after tomorrow? What time's the appointment?

142
00:10:48,988 --> 00:10:51,858
Can you move my appointment to the time slot after hers?

143
00:10:57,858 --> 00:10:59,897
The illegal photos on the phone alone...

144
00:11:01,868 --> 00:11:03,998
can get you locked up as we caught you in the act.

145
00:11:07,368 --> 00:11:08,878
You wrote this comment, didn't you?

146
00:11:08,878 --> 00:11:10,277
(I'm the dad of Cha Eun Sae's baby.)

147
00:11:11,848 --> 00:11:14,147
Whether you are or not, the results will tell.

148
00:11:15,718 --> 00:11:17,577
On your laptop, we found proof...

149
00:11:17,577 --> 00:11:19,488
that you stalked Cha. You can...

150
00:11:19,488 --> 00:11:20,988
no longer make excuses that you just supported her.

151
00:11:20,988 --> 00:11:22,057
That kind of excuse won't work on me.

152
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:24,417
Yes, I installed a spy camera.

153
00:11:26,427 --> 00:11:29,657
I admit leaving hate comments about Eun Sae and stalking her.

154
00:11:30,697 --> 00:11:32,598
But I didn't kill Eun Sae.

155
00:11:36,638 --> 00:11:38,567
I emailed you the requested information...

156
00:11:38,567 --> 00:11:39,838
about Detective Kim Tae Heon.

157
00:11:39,838 --> 00:11:41,437
(Inbox)

158
00:11:43,177 --> 00:11:44,738
(N Mail, Compose)

159
00:11:54,888 --> 00:11:57,758
She kept ignoring me as if I didn't exist.

160
00:11:59,128 --> 00:12:02,228
That's why I stabbed that wench, Cha Eun Sae, to death.

161
00:12:05,527 --> 00:12:07,167
You already confessed to the murder.

162
00:12:07,427 --> 00:12:09,197
You think you can get away with this by protesting you're innocent?

163
00:12:09,197 --> 00:12:12,268
Oh, that? I was drunk, so I was lying.

164
00:12:12,667 --> 00:12:13,907
I left that comment on the article...

165
00:12:14,468 --> 00:12:15,838
in the heat of the moment because I was drunk.

166
00:12:15,838 --> 00:12:17,878
Did you also kill Cha Eun Sae in the heat of the moment?

167
00:12:17,878 --> 00:12:21,917
No! Why would I kill Eun Sae? I loved her so much!

168
00:12:21,917 --> 00:12:23,677
The knife I found behind the boiler.

169
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:26,187
Why did you hide that then?

170
00:12:28,758 --> 00:12:29,758
Detective.

171
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,088
That knife doesn't belong to me.

172
00:12:32,827 --> 00:12:34,027
I'm telling the truth.

173
00:12:45,537 --> 00:12:46,537
Sir.

174
00:12:51,407 --> 00:12:52,777
I should have visited your new office sooner.

175
00:13:04,588 --> 00:13:05,657
Do you want a drink?

176
00:13:07,027 --> 00:13:08,397
Someone you know very well...

177
00:13:09,758 --> 00:13:11,768
has been arrested for the murder of Cha Eun Sae.

178
00:13:13,197 --> 00:13:14,197
Who?

179
00:13:15,598 --> 00:13:17,138
- Is it... - Kim Min Chul.

180
00:13:19,838 --> 00:13:20,838
I see.

181
00:13:22,508 --> 00:13:23,937
You must have thought of someone else.

182
00:13:24,878 --> 00:13:25,907
No.

183
00:13:27,608 --> 00:13:31,077
Why did you lend money to Kim Min Chul that day?

184
00:13:31,447 --> 00:13:32,888
Because he blackmailed me.

185
00:13:34,388 --> 00:13:35,417
Blackmail?

186
00:13:37,258 --> 00:13:39,057
He knew that I was seeing Cha Eun Sae.

187
00:13:39,927 --> 00:13:41,088
He asked me to pay him 10,000 dollars...

188
00:13:41,088 --> 00:13:42,258
every month for his silence.

189
00:13:42,397 --> 00:13:43,927
How did Kim Min Chul know about your affair?

190
00:13:43,927 --> 00:13:45,498
He was Cha Eun Sae's stalker.

191
00:13:47,768 --> 00:13:50,968
I doubt that they arrested him on stalking charges.

192
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:56,437
Did something bad happen?

193
00:14:00,508 --> 00:14:01,577
No.

194

Let's leave together.

195
00:14:05,888 --> 00:14:07,088
Go home without me.

196
00:14:07,588 --> 00:14:08,687
It's all hands on deck, so I have to work.

197
00:14:09,858 --> 00:14:10,888
Then...

198
00:14:11,687 --> 00:14:14,157
I suppose you'd need to meet the detective in charge.

199
00:14:18,768 --> 00:14:21,167
You lied about losing your phone.

200
00:14:21,268 --> 00:14:24,498
You also lied that you didn't stalk Cha Eun Sae.

201
00:14:24,868 --> 00:14:27,437
That means everything you told me during the last interview...

202
00:14:28,738 --> 00:14:30,277
was a lie.

203
00:14:34,478 --> 00:14:37,317
Borrowing money from Seol Woo Jae was a lie too. Right?

204
00:14:38,047 --> 00:14:40,348
You didn't borrow money. It was extortion. Right?

205
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:43,088
You knew that he was having an affair with Cha.

206
00:14:46,287 --> 00:14:47,327

We found Cha Eun Sae's blood on the knife.

209
00:15:02,807 --> 00:15:04,077
Kim Min Chul is the culprit.

210
00:15:04,077 --> 00:15:06,407
Let's wait for the DNA results and request an arrest warrant.

Why did you make an emergency arrest?

223
00:17:29,617 --> 00:17:31,018
My husband told me that...

224
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:32,758
he was Cha Eun Sae's stalker...

225
00:17:32,758 --> 00:17:35,228
and even blackmailed my husband.

226
00:17:36,297 --> 00:17:38,258
That's not enough to arrest someone.

227
00:17:39,968 --> 00:17:42,837
You were tailing someone in Mueon. Was it Kim Min Chul?

228
00:17:45,367 --> 00:17:47,337
I went to Yoo Yoon Young's clinic this afternoon.

229
00:17:48,577 --> 00:17:50,678
- Why? - On the day of Jin's murder,

230
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:53,607
Yoo's car was caught on the speed camera in Owol-dong.

231
00:17:55,418 --> 00:17:57,077
But at the estimated time of Cha's murder,

232
00:17:58,148 --> 00:17:59,617
she was at her clinic.

233
00:18:01,347 --> 00:18:03,357
She came into the clinic at 5:50pm that day...

00:18:03,357 --> 00:18:05,087
and left at 8:30pm. It's all caught on camera.

235
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:10,228
You were suspecting the same thing, right?

236
00:18:11,228 --> 00:18:12,827
That your husband instigated the murder.

237
00:18:13,067 --> 00:18:16,037
So this woman in the red coat could have murdered Cha Eun Sae.

238
00:18:17,537 --> 00:18:19,107
Yoo Yoon Young's alibi is airtight.

239
00:18:19,837 --> 00:18:20,968
She can't be the culprit.

240
00:18:24,537 --> 00:18:26,008
Quite conveniently, we found a critical piece of evidence...

242
00:18:27,478 --> 00:18:28,547

00:18:31,918 --> 00:18:33,718
I can tell you. Not a word more from this.

245
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:37,418
Will you request an arrest warrant?

00:18:42,928 --> 00:18:44,797

This afternoon and just a while ago,

250
00:19:02,347 --> 00:19:04,248
I went to the TV station to see you.

251
00:19:05,347 --> 00:19:07,087
- Why? - Why did you do it?

252
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:09,988
Why didn't you explain everything?

253
00:19:11,718 --> 00:19:13,728
You didn't approach me to investigate Detective Cha.

254
00:19:14,188 --> 00:19:16,027
You didn't toy with me. Right?

255
00:19:19,597 --> 00:19:21,097
Why didn't you tell me the truth?

256
00:19:21,097 --> 00:19:22,738
Why didn't you explain everything to me then?

257
00:19:24,337 --> 00:19:26,938
Had you told me everything, we would have never broken up.

258
00:19:38,377 --> 00:19:39,648
I resented you, so I didn't.

259
00:19:43,988 --> 00:19:45,857
You dismissed my feelings as though they were not genuine.

260
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:49,627
That made me angry.

261
00:19:54,228 --> 00:19:55,898
That was all I amounted to in your eyes.

262
00:19:58,037 --> 00:19:59,307
And that hurt me.

263
00:20:05,077 --> 00:20:06,448
I wanted to hurt you...

264
00:20:09,577 --> 00:20:10,918
as much as you had hurt me.

265
00:20:13,148 --> 00:20:14,287
Then you've succeeded.

266
00:20:17,587 --> 00:20:19,057
I'm miserable whenever I see you.

267
00:20:20,587 --> 00:20:21,658
I still am.

268
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:37,337
I'm sorry.

269
00:20:39,047 --> 00:20:40,448
I criticized you...

270
00:20:41,648 --> 00:20:43,877
for never apologizing to me.

271
00:20:46,347 --> 00:20:47,847
But I didn't have the right to criticize you.

272
00:20:51,117 --> 00:20:52,587
I hurt you and made you resentful.

273
00:21:00,327 --> 00:21:01,367
I'm sorry for that.

Now, I understand why your eyes looked so sad.

It must've been heartbreaking for you...

283
00:22:17,408 --> 00:22:19,508
to have to question the woman you loved...

284
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:21,648
and to suspect her.

285
00:22:22,748 --> 00:22:25,648
It must've been painful, and I bet it made you feel bad for her. No,

286
00:22:26,748 --> 00:22:27,847
I bet it confused you too.

287
00:22:28,018 --> 00:22:30,718
You knew she was married, but you caught yourself wanting her.

288

Hey, what's with you?

289
00:22:34,527 --> 00:22:37,327
So what, you're still her husband? Your jealousy has driven you mad.

290
00:22:40,228 --> 00:22:42,537
I am warning you as Seo Jung Won's husband.

291
00:22:43,137 --> 00:22:44,367
You'd better...

292
00:22:45,637 --> 00:22:47,107
stay away from my wife.

293
00:22:47,668 --> 00:22:48,708
I don't want to.

294
00:22:51,107 --> 00:22:53,448
You cheated on her.

295
00:22:55,107 --> 00:22:56,518
Why can't she cheat?

296
00:22:57,547 --> 00:22:58,718
It's not fair.

297
00:23:04,057 --> 00:23:05,087
So what?

298
00:23:06,357 --> 00:23:08,327
You'll have an affair with my wife?

299
00:23:08,327 --> 00:23:09,658
Why not?

300
00:23:10,527 --> 00:23:11,627
That's enough, both of you.

303

Did you have to lie to me?

304
00:23:50,268 --> 00:23:52,238
- What did I lie about? - The work trip to Mueon.

305
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:55,738
You went there with him, didn't you?

306
00:23:57,337 --> 00:23:59,877
No, I did not. I ran into him in Mueon.

307
00:23:59,877 --> 00:24:02,107
In any case, you were there with him but lied to me about it.

308
00:24:06,748 --> 00:24:07,847

309
00:24:11,357 --> 00:24:13,158
What? That you and Kim Tae Heon dated in the past?

310
00:24:39,718 --> 00:24:41,188
It must've been heartbreaking for you...

311
00:24:41,847 --> 00:24:43,988
to have to question the woman you loved...

312
00:24:43,988 --> 00:24:45,117

I bet it confused you too.

315
00:24:50,998 --> 00:24:52,998
You knew she was married, but you caught yourself wanting her.

316
00:25:03,008 --> 00:25:05,748
The board chairman asked me to find out everything about you,

317
00:25:06,508 --> 00:25:07,547
so I told him.

318
00:25:10,718 --> 00:25:11,777
That picture.

319
00:25:12,488 --> 00:25:13,518
Where did you get it?

320
00:25:18,988 --> 00:25:20,527
Is that more important to you...

321
00:25:21,057 --> 00:25:22,357
than the fact that I found out about your relationship?

322
00:25:28,968 --> 00:25:30,837
When I was chasing you, you told me...

323
00:25:31,867 --> 00:25:33,508
that you'd gone through a breakup recently.

324
00:25:34,607 --> 00:25:37,478
You also said you loved him so much and wanted to marry him,

325
00:25:37,478 --> 00:25:38,777
so you weren't over him yet.

326
00:25:39,377 --> 00:25:41,107
But I said to you that I was confident...

327
00:25:42,277 --> 00:25:44,948
that I could make you forget him and asked you to be with me forever.

328
00:25:47,047 --> 00:25:48,148
I said that.

329
00:25:50,617 --> 00:25:52,357
But Kim Tae Heon was that guy?

330
00:25:57,557 --> 00:26:00,198
Why did you two break up if you loved each other that much?

331
00:26:01,567 --> 00:26:03,998
- It's all in the past. - Are you sure about that?

332
00:26:05,837 --> 00:26:08,037
The way he was looking at you wasn't the only thing I noticed.

333
00:26:08,037 --> 00:26:10,238
I also saw the way you were looking at him!

00:26:12,648 --> 00:26:13,978
On the terrace at the gallery...

335
00:26:14,847 --> 00:26:15,948
and at his place.

336
00:26:20,448 --> 00:26:21,617
Are you confused too?

337
00:26:24,158 --> 00:26:25,218
Like him?

338
00:26:26,188 --> 00:26:27,228
Are you?

339
00:26:30,357 --> 00:26:31,357
No, right?

340
00:26:43,777 --> 00:26:45,238
Why can't you say anything?

341
00:26:49,547 --> 00:26:52,047
I have no choice but to think it's true if you don't say no.

342
00:26:56,958 --> 00:26:59,627
If you do this, I can't help but feel that you are confused now.

run for President?

00:29:58,592 --> 00:30:01,162
I should at least establish my position in the metropolitan area...

360
00:30:01,162 --> 00:30:02,801
If you want to raise funds for your presidential campaign,

361
00:30:03,701 --> 00:30:06,432
there's nothing better than a new resort built by Mujin.

362
00:30:13,172 --> 00:30:14,971
So you want to embark on a new project?

363
00:30:16,582 --> 00:30:18,011
This was your plan.

364
00:30:19,912 --> 00:30:21,481
Where in Gangwon Province?

365
00:30:22,481 --> 00:30:25,021
I need the alteration of land use to be easier than in Mueon.

366
00:30:26,152 --> 00:30:27,922
I'll drop you a hint when the decision's made.

367
00:30:30,521 --> 00:30:33,662
Before we get into a win-win deal for a massive business,

368
00:30:33,662 --> 00:30:35,031
we must go over something.

369
00:30:39,072 --> 00:30:41,172
The reason you're involved in the Cha Eun Sae case.

370
00:30:42,102 --> 00:30:43,602
Is it because of the sponsor rumor?

371
00:30:48,211 --> 00:30:49,582
Check the amount.

372
00:30:51,412 --> 00:30:53,251
The guy who reported Kim Min Chul.

373
00:30:53,451 --> 00:30:55,951
He just withdrew cash and is on the phone with someone.

374
00:30:55,951 --> 00:30:58,051
I wish he were talking to Cha Geum Sae.

375
00:30:58,051 --> 00:31:00,291
So we can bring him in for naming Kim Min Chul.

376
00:31:02,461 --> 00:31:04,062
Let's find out.

377
00:31:24,182 --> 00:31:25,211
What's going on?

378
00:31:29,822 --> 00:31:30,951
Sorry.

379
00:31:32,922 --> 00:31:34,392
Sorry, I'm a detective.

380
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:36,521
Keep the change. I'll take the passenger.

381
00:31:36,991 --> 00:31:38,291
What's this about?

382
00:31:38,521 --> 00:31:39,562
Get out.

383
00:31:40,531 --> 00:31:41,592
Sorry, sir.

384
00:31:42,862 --> 00:31:45,102
I just want to check something. Let's see your phone.

385
00:31:46,632 --> 00:31:47,701
Your phone.

(Cha Geum Sae)

387
00:31:58,672 --> 00:32:00,243
You know Cha Geum Sae.

388
00:32:03,152 --> 00:32:05,953
Though not just now, you did talk often.

389
00:32:07,523 --> 00:32:09,622
Cha told you to report Kim Min Chul, didn't he?

390
00:32:10,652 --> 00:32:12,152
Shall we talk at the station?

391
00:32:12,152 --> 00:32:13,993
No. He did tell me to do it,

392
00:32:14,763 --> 00:32:16,563
but it's also true that Min Chul said it.

393
00:32:23,003 --> 00:32:24,132
(Detective Bong, Mueon Police)

394
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:29,773
Hello, Detective Bong.

395
00:32:29,773 --> 00:32:31,313
I found what you asked for.

396
00:32:31,642 --> 00:32:34,682
I'll send a photo from the junkyard CCTV camera. Take a look.

397
00:32:34,783 --> 00:32:36,382
Okay. Thanks for your help.

398
00:32:36,753 --> 00:32:37,753
Bye.

(Detective Bong, Mueon Police)

401
00:32:48,392 --> 00:32:49,963
The person who tailed me in Mueon...

402
00:32:51,132 --> 00:32:52,563
was Mo Hyung Taek's man?

403
00:33:02,743 --> 00:33:06,112
Kim Min Chul was arrested because someone taped him confessing.

404
00:33:08,342 --> 00:33:10,813
How did the police get the recording?

405
00:33:10,813 --> 00:33:12,153
His colleague ratted him out.

406
00:33:12,352 --> 00:33:15,722
They found a bloody murder weapon during the search and seizure.

407
00:33:16,193 --> 00:33:17,352
Was it Cha Eun Sae's blood?

408
00:33:17,352 --> 00:33:19,093
He confessed, so it must be.

409
00:33:19,093 --> 00:33:20,622
Write up a script for a show.

410
00:33:20,622 --> 00:33:21,892
Let's air it this week.

411
00:33:23,593 --> 00:33:25,733
Once he's detained, I'll meet with my team...

412
00:33:25,733 --> 00:33:27,463
You said you'd name the culprit on your show.

413
00:33:27,463 --> 00:33:28,602
Why delay now?

414
00:33:28,802 --> 00:33:31,073
Set things up for a special life show.

415
00:33:31,073 --> 00:33:33,142
What if it's not him? What if he's not detained?

416
00:33:33,142 --> 00:33:34,443
He said he would be...

417
00:33:34,702 --> 00:33:35,702
Who did?

418
00:33:36,843 --> 00:33:39,713
Who do you think? Someone from the police did.

419
00:33:39,713 --> 00:33:42,713
How do you know so much when they were issued a gag order?

420
00:33:43,012 --> 00:33:46,253
Not just me, but no reporter could get a story.

421
00:33:46,253 --> 00:33:47,552
Are you picking a fight?

422
00:33:47,823 --> 00:33:49,082

00:34:15,713 --> 00:34:17,412
There are no cameras.

426

What are you doing here?

427
00:34:37,432 --> 00:34:39,403
Why would a reporter be at a victim's home?

428
00:34:39,403 --> 00:34:40,503
Why are you here?

429
00:34:41,843 --> 00:34:44,713
You found a bloody weapon at Kim Min Chul's.

430
00:34:44,943 --> 00:34:46,412
- Said who? - My chief.

431
00:34:50,153 --> 00:34:51,213
Leave.

432
00:34:54,782 --> 00:34:55,883
Go away.

433
00:34:55,983 --> 00:34:57,923
Then I'll go through the open window.

434
00:35:00,523 --> 00:35:01,892
You can't take photos.

435
00:35:12,233 --> 00:35:13,273
It's different.

436
00:35:13,702 --> 00:35:14,802
What's different?

437
00:35:15,503 --> 00:35:16,543
The knife?

438
00:35:17,043 --> 00:35:18,472
He didn't use one from here?

439
00:35:30,923 --> 00:35:32,392
Hello. Do you have the results?

440
00:35:42,903 --> 00:35:44,003
Where are you going?

441
00:35:47,073 --> 00:35:48,472
About our past.

00:35:48,673 --> 00:35:50,742
Secretary Gong Joon Ho told your husband.

443
00:35:51,872 --> 00:35:54,512
How do you know that? Do you know him?

444
00:35:55,142 --> 00:35:56,912
I became a cop because of him.

445
00:36:08,162 --> 00:36:09,733
What are you doing here out of the blue?

446
00:36:10,363 --> 00:36:11,793
On Cha Eun Sae's body,

447
00:36:12,093 --> 00:36:14,363
were there any stab wounds other than the lethal one?

(National Forensic Service)

449
00:36:16,532 --> 00:36:17,573
Were there?

450
00:36:23,843 --> 00:36:25,313
(National Forensic Service)

451
00:36:28,282 --> 00:36:29,782
There were self-inflicted wounds.

452
00:36:30,113 --> 00:36:31,483
You found the murder weapon.

453
00:36:31,713 --> 00:36:33,323
Why ask about other wounds?

454
00:36:33,653 --> 00:36:35,253
We tested the knife,

455
00:36:35,923 --> 00:36:37,722
but the marks don't match Cha's lethal stab wound.

456
00:36:38,392 --> 00:36:41,363
The problem is that her blood was on the knife.

457
00:36:41,762 --> 00:36:43,133
So I came here.

458
00:36:43,693 --> 00:36:44,693
I see.

459
00:36:44,793 --> 00:36:47,602
That knife could be the one Cha used to harm herself?

460
00:36:48,932 --> 00:36:52,073
That would explain her blood on it.

461
00:36:57,843 --> 00:36:59,543
It wasn't me, detective.

462
00:37:00,483 --> 00:37:02,713
I didn't kill her.

463
00:37:05,983 --> 00:37:08,653
Your balcony window was open. Do you never lock it?

464
00:37:09,182 --> 00:37:11,693
No. The air circulation's very poor.

465
00:37:13,622 --> 00:37:15,992
He's not the killer. Charge him just for taking illegal photos.

Whenever you couldn't arrest someone,

478
00:38:10,613 --> 00:38:12,613
you'd take it out on the poor sandbag.

479
00:38:14,852 --> 00:38:16,722
You found a bloody knife...

480
00:38:16,722 --> 00:38:18,122
but you didn't charge him with murder.

481
00:38:19,052 --> 00:38:20,392
Was the blood not Cha's?

00:38:24,892 --> 00:38:26,432
Her blood was on the knife,

485
00:38:27,162 --> 00:38:28,832
but it wasn't the one that killed her?

486
00:38:32,773 --> 00:38:34,242
For her blood to be on it,

487
00:38:34,843 --> 00:38:37,642
she must've been hurt with it or hurt herself with it.

488

that you were willing to give me what I wanted?

502
00:40:02,693 --> 00:40:03,762
Because...

503
00:40:04,593 --> 00:40:06,802
I don't find you guilty,

504
00:40:07,262 --> 00:40:08,602
I gave you proof of the assault.

505

Who else...

506
00:40:11,133 --> 00:40:12,573
do you find guilty?

507
00:40:13,302 --> 00:40:16,713
I think Kim Min Chul's the culprit.

508
00:40:17,043 --> 00:40:18,642
That's the story I'm going with.

509
00:40:22,943 --> 00:40:25,452
My husband and Kim Min Chul graduated from the same high school.

510
00:40:26,213 --> 00:40:28,383
He knew that my husband was seeing Cha Eun Sae,

511
00:40:28,983 --> 00:40:31,352
so Kim blackmailed my husband and extorted money from him.

512
00:40:33,023 --> 00:40:34,063
Really?

513
00:40:34,063 --> 00:40:36,293
Kim even admitted killing your sister to his colleague.

514
00:40:36,662 --> 00:40:38,892
On top of that, the murder weapon was found at his house.

515
00:40:38,892 --> 00:40:40,363
But it makes no sense that he isn't charged with murder.

516
00:40:40,832 --> 00:40:41,832
I believe...

517
00:40:42,302 --> 00:40:43,932
the police have made a huge mistake.

518
00:40:44,903 --> 00:40:46,972
Exactly. You know?

519
00:40:47,503 --> 00:40:49,972
It's crystal clear that he's the culprit. You know?

520
00:40:51,073 --> 00:40:52,412
So you're also...

521
00:40:52,713 --> 00:40:54,713
suspecting Kim Min Chul as the culprit, right?

522
00:40:56,582 --> 00:40:57,613
Well,

523
00:40:58,352 --> 00:40:59,713
I wouldn't say...

00:41:33,323 --> 00:41:34,483
Come on.

532
00:41:41,122 --> 00:41:44,432
It's not the due date yet. Why are you barging in here again?

533
00:41:44,432 --> 00:41:45,492
Here's your bag.

534
00:41:46,503 --> 00:41:47,532
I wanted to return it.

535
00:41:48,762 --> 00:41:52,273
My boss wants you to fill it up with cash again next month.

536
00:41:52,472 --> 00:41:55,073
Gosh. I got it. Just leave.

537
00:41:58,073 --> 00:41:59,113
I said I got it.

538
00:41:59,472 --> 00:42:01,983
You should get a new bag or something. Seriously.

539
00:42:03,452 --> 00:42:04,552
That's a good bag for a bicycle.

540
00:42:04,552 --> 00:42:05,813
I got it. Just go.

541
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:30,642
Where did she go?

542
00:42:34,883 --> 00:42:36,343
I used the bathroom.

543
00:42:38,912 --> 00:42:40,082
It's been ten minutes.

544
00:42:42,952 --> 00:42:45,552
Don't hesitate to contact me if there's anything...

545
00:42:45,552 --> 00:42:46,693
you want to tell me about Kim Min Chul.

546
00:42:47,492 --> 00:42:48,923
Sure. I'll do that.

547
00:43:23,793 --> 00:43:24,793
Darn it.

548
00:43:28,932 --> 00:43:31,503
Why did you open my shoe cabinet without my permission? Darn it.

549
00:43:32,832 --> 00:43:34,043
How dare you?

550
00:43:35,503 --> 00:43:38,073
- That bag... - The bag? What about it?

551
00:43:39,343 --> 00:43:40,412
What about that bag?

552
00:43:44,282 --> 00:43:45,352
Nothing.

553
00:43:53,423 --> 00:43:54,423
What?

554
00:43:55,023 --> 00:43:57,363
How on earth did she recognize the bag?

555
00:44:01,762 --> 00:44:02,832
Did she...

556
00:44:15,483 --> 00:44:17,753
(3 months ago)

557
00:44:20,552 --> 00:44:21,852
You're here even on a weekend.

558
00:44:22,622 --> 00:44:25,253
I had to finish up some work. You must be coming from a workout.

559
00:44:25,952 --> 00:44:26,992
Yes.

560
00:44:27,662 --> 00:44:30,332
If I knew you'd be here, I would've bought something.

561
00:44:31,733 --> 00:44:32,793
That's cute.

562
00:44:34,903 --> 00:44:37,532
I can't give you this. It was a gift.

563
00:44:40,702 --> 00:44:43,742
It's the same bag with the same keyring accessory.

564
00:44:44,443 --> 00:44:45,872
Could it be a mere coincidence?

565
00:45:00,563 --> 00:45:02,793
Not here. Let's talk somewhere else.

566
00:45:13,290 --> 00:45:15,060
The knife from Kim Min Chul's house...

567
00:45:15,661 --> 00:45:17,190
is the missing knife from Cha Eun Sae's house, right?

568
00:45:21,161 --> 00:45:22,860
This means Cha Geum Sae was behind it.

569
00:45:24,301 --> 00:45:26,400
How did it coincide with the report from Kim's colleague?

570
00:45:27,371 --> 00:45:28,440
It can't be a coincidence.

571
00:45:28,871 --> 00:45:31,371
He was determined to frame Kim Min Chul as the culprit.

572
00:45:31,371 --> 00:45:32,940
Did Cha Geum Sae frame Kim...

573
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:36,610
because he was the real culprit?

574
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:39,250
That's a possibility.

575
00:45:40,051 --> 00:45:42,121
Or Cha Geum Sae could have been used too.

576
00:45:42,551 --> 00:45:43,621
By whom?

577
00:45:45,590 --> 00:45:46,721
By Mo Hyung Taek?

578
00:45:46,991 --> 00:45:48,190
I'll have to investigate first.

579
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:53,801
I know you're a reporter, but can you try to play it safe?

580
00:45:54,801 --> 00:45:56,161
What if Cha Geum Sae turns out to be the culprit?

581
00:45:56,161 --> 00:45:58,770
Then you were alone in the house with a murderer.

582
00:45:59,801 --> 00:46:01,071
I helped you.

583
00:46:01,670 --> 00:46:03,971
You're a detective. You should thank me, not get mad at me.

584
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:06,371
You really don't know why I'm mad at you?

585
00:46:17,551 --> 00:46:18,621
Anyway,

586
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:20,991
you needed my help.

587
00:46:27,101 --> 00:46:28,560
Tell me if you need me too.

588
00:46:30,471 --> 00:46:31,931
I'll help you.

589
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,040
Whatever it is.

590
00:46:43,951 --> 00:46:45,081
Are you confused too?

591
00:46:46,250 --> 00:46:47,721
Why can't you say anything?

592
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:51,520
I have no choice but to think it's true if you don't say no.

593
00:46:54,821 --> 00:46:57,560
If you do this, I can't help but feel that you are confused now.

594
00:46:59,331 --> 00:47:00,431
No.

595
00:47:04,871 --> 00:47:06,201
Why would you help me?

596
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:08,871
You suspected me of being the culprit before.

597
00:47:08,871 --> 00:47:10,210
Why do you suddenly want to help me?

598
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:12,471
Because our misunderstanding got cleared up?

599
00:47:12,471 --> 00:47:13,641
Because you feel bad?

600
00:47:18,551 --> 00:47:19,851
My husband made a mistake...

601
00:47:20,781 --> 00:47:22,581
in your house the other day.

602
00:47:22,581 --> 00:47:23,920
But you made a big mistake too.

603
00:47:24,590 --> 00:47:26,920
I understand that you wanted to mess with my husband.

604
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:29,391
- But never say that again. - What?

605
00:47:29,790 --> 00:47:32,190
That I'm willing to have an affair with you?

606
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:36,101
What if I didn't say that just to mess with your husband?

607
00:47:37,170 --> 00:47:38,670
What if I didn't say it out of guilt?

608
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:41,741
What if I said that out of worry?

609
00:47:44,571 --> 00:47:46,840
Or because I wanted to help you? What would you do then?

610
00:47:48,641 --> 00:47:49,880
Am I still not allowed to say that?

611
00:47:50,851 --> 00:47:52,081
But that's how I feel.

612
00:47:55,551 --> 00:47:57,321
Can't I just follow my heart?

613
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:07,560
No, never.

614
00:48:08,831 --> 00:48:11,371
Don't have any feelings toward me.

615
00:48:25,210 --> 00:48:26,281
I'm a crazy jerk.

616
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:29,321
What could I possibly do now?

617
00:48:48,871 --> 00:48:50,670
Why did you want to see me this late at night?

618
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:53,110
Here.

619
00:48:53,980 --> 00:48:55,281
I'll leave...

620
00:48:55,281 --> 00:48:56,980
after I finish this drink with you. Not a drop more.

621
00:48:58,880 --> 00:48:59,911
Cheers.

622
00:49:00,581 --> 00:49:02,781
What is it? What's going on?

623
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:10,690
Kim Tae Heon figured it out.

624
00:49:11,730 --> 00:49:12,831
That he misunderstood...

625
00:49:14,761 --> 00:49:16,101
what happened when we broke up.

626
00:49:18,201 --> 00:49:19,701
You're killing me.

627
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:21,871
You need to quit that habit of yours.

628
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:24,641
When something's not true, just say so, or they'll never know.

629
00:49:24,641 --> 00:49:26,170
Why would you keep it all bottled up?

630
00:49:27,241 --> 00:49:28,241
You're right.

631
00:49:29,511 --> 00:49:30,710
Why do I do this?

632
00:49:32,351 --> 00:49:33,851
He still has feelings for you, doesn't he?

633
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:37,221
His feelings must be growing with the misunderstanding gone.

634
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:45,590
Hey, I can control what I say,

635
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:49,301
so why is it that I can't control my own thoughts?

636
00:49:51,071 --> 00:49:52,101
Now,

637
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,871
I pity my husband more...

638
00:49:55,670 --> 00:49:57,141
than I hate him.

639
00:49:59,170 --> 00:50:01,011
Things can never go back to how they used to be,

640
00:50:02,181 --> 00:50:05,011
so I feel bad seeing him trying so desperately, all by himself.

641
00:50:05,710 --> 00:50:06,750
What you just said...

642
00:50:07,821 --> 00:50:10,351
makes me feel like you have no feelings left for Woo Jae.

643
00:50:13,821 --> 00:50:14,991
It's strange.

644
00:50:15,790 --> 00:50:17,360
I've finished my drink, but I don't even feel buzzed.

645
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:04,141
I came here to drink your coffee.

646
00:51:09,741 --> 00:51:11,750
Fixing broken things.

647
00:51:13,051 --> 00:51:14,551
It's a hobby that suits you perfectly.

648
00:51:15,321 --> 00:51:16,321
Look.

649
00:51:18,321 --> 00:51:21,520
It's more beautiful because it's broken.

650
00:51:22,121 --> 00:51:24,060
Yes, you're right.

651
00:51:28,431 --> 00:51:29,931
You must be going through something with your dad.

652
00:51:32,170 --> 00:51:33,641
He found out everything.

653
00:51:34,940 --> 00:51:38,310
He might really kill me at this rate.

654
00:51:54,860 --> 00:51:56,090
I promised you...

655
00:51:58,130 --> 00:51:59,331
that I'd always protect you.

656
00:52:01,931 --> 00:52:03,031
(Propofol)

657
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:13,940
What would you do without me?

658
00:52:18,781 --> 00:52:21,451
(You and Me Neuropsychiatric Clinic)

659
00:52:32,790 --> 00:52:33,801
Hello.

660
00:52:35,601 --> 00:52:37,571
Aren't you Assemblyman Mo Hyung Taek's daughter?

661
00:52:38,531 --> 00:52:40,270
Oh, yes. Hello.

662
00:52:40,601 --> 00:52:43,601
How long have you been coming here?

663
00:52:43,601 --> 00:52:46,141
(You and Me Neuropsychiatric Clinic)

664
00:52:46,511 --> 00:52:47,681
Not long.

665
00:52:49,011 --> 00:52:50,110
I see.

666
00:52:52,710 --> 00:52:54,880
The director of this clinic is very nice, isn't she?

667
00:52:55,681 --> 00:52:56,750
Yes.

668
00:52:57,491 --> 00:52:58,851
I have to go. There's no one at my cafe now.

669
00:53:00,221 --> 00:53:01,290
Ms. Mo Soo Rin.

670
00:53:01,690 --> 00:53:02,920
Since we met like this, I want to ask you...

671
00:53:03,020 --> 00:53:05,431
if I could interview you regarding Jin Myung Sook's case.

672
00:53:06,460 --> 00:53:08,000
How do you know my name?

673
00:53:08,230 --> 00:53:10,230
I looked it up and found it right away.

674
00:53:10,931 --> 00:53:13,071
We're the same age.

675
00:53:14,101 --> 00:53:16,770
I thought you were working on a report on the Cha Eun Sae case.

676
00:53:17,310 --> 00:53:19,011
I'm closely following both cases.

677
00:53:20,241 --> 00:53:22,040
I'll visit you at your cafe soon.

678
00:53:32,891 --> 00:53:35,860
Why is she lying to me about her relationship with Yoo Yoon Young?

679
00:53:48,301 --> 00:53:51,011
So, Mo Soo Rin is your patient too?

680
00:53:51,610 --> 00:53:54,380
You know Ms. Mo Soo Rin?

681
00:53:54,581 --> 00:53:56,641
She is Assemblyman Mo's daughter.

682
00:53:59,551 --> 00:54:03,380
Cha Eun Sae was your patient too, wasn't she?

683
00:54:04,491 --> 00:54:05,650
I'm sorry,

684
00:54:06,321 --> 00:54:08,360
but I cannot confirm whether or not I treated her.

685
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:10,321
Had I known Cha Eun Sae was your patient,

686
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:13,261
I would have found myself a different therapist.

687
00:54:14,701 --> 00:54:16,060
The wife and the mistress.

688
00:54:16,601 --> 00:54:20,071
How did it feel to hear both women's thoughts?

689
00:54:23,871 --> 00:54:24,940
This feels like...

690
00:54:26,810 --> 00:54:28,411
an interrogation, not a session.

691
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:38,391
Oh, come on in.

692
00:54:46,090 --> 00:54:47,601
The truth is, your husband...

693
00:54:48,101 --> 00:54:51,571
asked for a marriage counseling session to patch things up.

694
00:54:51,971 --> 00:54:53,071
You're okay with this, right?

695
00:54:57,571 --> 00:54:58,641
I...

696
00:55:00,011 --> 00:55:01,310
should've been more thoughtful.

697
00:55:01,781 --> 00:55:03,880
I should've asked you how you felt about it first.

698
00:55:05,581 --> 00:55:06,610
Let's just go.

699
00:55:11,121 --> 00:55:12,121
No.

700
00:55:12,951 --> 00:55:14,391
You plucked up your courage to do this.

701
00:55:15,621 --> 00:55:16,821
Let's do it.

702
00:55:22,601 --> 00:55:23,630
We'll do it.

703
00:55:33,980 --> 00:55:35,241
You made a wise decision.

704
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:37,980
Who wants to go first?

705
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:39,011
I'll go first.

706
00:55:43,281 --> 00:55:46,750
Why did you marry Mr. Seol?

707
00:55:47,090 --> 00:55:50,121
Because I thought he'd be on my side forever.

708
00:55:51,031 --> 00:55:53,290
You wanted a devoted husband.

709
00:55:55,661 --> 00:55:57,130
Before you found out about his affair,

710
00:55:58,371 --> 00:55:59,571
were you satisfied with your marriage?

711
00:55:59,571 --> 00:56:00,571
Yes, I was.

712
00:56:00,871 --> 00:56:02,040
My career and marriage.

713
00:56:03,201 --> 00:56:04,971
I thought I was successful on all fronts.

714
00:56:07,011 --> 00:56:08,980
Do you think your husband was as satisfied...

715
00:56:09,141 --> 00:56:10,681
as you were?

716
00:56:11,411 --> 00:56:13,051
Would you say...

717
00:56:13,511 --> 00:56:15,150
you were a devoted spouse too, like your husband?

718
00:56:16,150 --> 00:56:17,851
I admit that I could've been a better wife,

719
00:56:18,621 --> 00:56:21,790
but that cannot be used to justify the fact that he cheated on me.

720
00:56:22,491 --> 00:56:24,560
Right, of course not.

721
00:56:25,630 --> 00:56:26,661
However,

722
00:56:27,701 --> 00:56:29,331
if your career was more important than your husband,

723
00:56:30,431 --> 00:56:31,871
it's possible what made you really angry...

724
00:56:32,230 --> 00:56:35,071
wasn't his affair but how it impacted your career.

725
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:39,641
And that could make your husband miserable.

726
00:56:41,810 --> 00:56:43,181
Earlier,

727
00:56:43,411 --> 00:56:45,951
I asked you why you married him.

728
00:56:46,511 --> 00:56:47,520
Be honest.

729
00:56:48,181 --> 00:56:50,551
Didn't you choose him because of his family background?

730
00:56:52,020 --> 00:56:53,891
To marry a rich heir?

731
00:56:55,121 --> 00:56:56,661
What are you doing? You are out of line.

732
00:56:57,391 --> 00:56:58,590
Apologize at once.

733
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:02,831
She also went to Mueon High with me.

734
00:57:03,701 --> 00:57:05,301
When she found out about my relationship with Eun Sae,

735
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:07,971
she forced me to bring you here in return for keeping her lips sealed.

736
00:57:14,940 --> 00:57:16,040
Clearly,

737
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:19,081
you knew about me and Woo Jae.

738
00:57:19,351 --> 00:57:21,321
Was this why you demanded the three of us meet?

739
00:57:23,020 --> 00:57:25,090
To see my reaction the moment my husband...

740
00:57:26,721 --> 00:57:27,920
spilled the truth?

741
00:57:30,321 --> 00:57:32,460
The fact that Detective Kim Tae Heon came to see me...

742
00:57:33,031 --> 00:57:35,301
means that you know as much as he knows about me.

743
00:57:35,730 --> 00:57:36,960
I just didn't like that.

744
00:57:37,130 --> 00:57:39,071
You playing dumb when you knew everything.

745
00:57:39,071 --> 00:57:40,201
You were putting on an act.

746
00:57:42,301 --> 00:57:43,340
Jung Won.

747
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:45,710
You were convinced that Woo Jae and I...

748
00:57:45,710 --> 00:57:47,411
were accomplices in the murder of Cha Eun Sae.

749
00:57:48,681 --> 00:57:50,980
Now, you know that both Woo Jae and I have alibis.

750
00:57:52,281 --> 00:57:54,451
So you won't suspect us anymore, right?

751
00:57:57,621 --> 00:57:58,851
You see, the two of us...

752
00:58:00,190 --> 00:58:02,891
We've been friends since we were little. We studied abroad together.

753
00:58:04,031 --> 00:58:07,560
We kept it from you because we were very close.

754
00:58:08,531 --> 00:58:09,831
We didn't want any misunderstandings.

755
00:58:11,670 --> 00:58:14,770
So you two never dated?

756
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:18,810
Why would I... With her?

757
00:58:20,110 --> 00:58:21,181
No, never.

758
00:58:28,581 --> 00:58:30,750
I thought you two were having an affair.

759
00:58:31,721 --> 00:58:34,991
I guess you had a one-sided crush on my husband.

760
00:58:42,630 --> 00:58:45,071
Well, for a short while when I was young.

761
00:58:46,431 --> 00:58:49,440
He's good-looking and comes from a good family, you know.

762
00:58:52,641 --> 00:58:54,411
That's how he married you...

763
00:58:55,011 --> 00:58:56,810
and had an affair with Eun Sae too.

764
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:57,951
Yoo Yoon Young!

765
00:58:59,411 --> 00:59:01,081
I'm doing this to clear up the misunderstandings for your sake.

766
00:59:01,721 --> 00:59:03,221
I felt bad that your wife was thinking...

767
00:59:03,451 --> 00:59:05,891
you might be the killer and that there was something between us.

768
00:59:08,860 --> 00:59:10,931
There. Now, you know everything we haven't been able to tell you,

769
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:14,201
so I hope you can put your mind at ease.

770
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:21,270
There's something you haven't explained.

771
00:59:22,201 --> 00:59:24,810
Why do you record all your sessions?

772
00:59:25,940 --> 00:59:27,781
Are you illegally recording this now too?

773
00:59:29,241 --> 00:59:31,650
I will never book a session with you again.

774
00:59:32,411 --> 00:59:33,551
I came to tell you this.

775
00:59:46,290 --> 00:59:48,630
(You and Me Neuropsychiatric Clinic)

776
00:59:54,241 --> 00:59:55,270
Jung Won.

777
00:59:57,071 --> 00:59:58,540
I should have never met you.

778
01:00:02,581 --> 01:00:03,581
Take the next one.

779
01:00:53,891 --> 01:00:56,101
I didn't hear from you after you asked me...

780
01:00:56,101 --> 01:00:58,331
to look into Yoo Yoon Young, so I've been bored.

781
01:00:58,730 --> 01:01:01,440
Unfortunately, I'm stuck and haven't made any progress since then.

782
01:01:01,871 --> 01:01:04,310
Mo Hyung Taek's daughter opened the clinic for her.

783
01:01:04,710 --> 01:01:05,810
Look into that.

784
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:12,110
(Zeus)

785
01:01:13,451 --> 01:01:15,081
Sorry, I pressed the wrong button.

786
01:01:15,951 --> 01:01:18,721
I thought you dropped your phone again, like the time...

787
01:01:19,221 --> 01:01:20,451
when you found the housekeeper.

788
01:01:23,821 --> 01:01:25,590
Keep walking in your two o'clock.

789
01:01:32,301 --> 01:01:33,331
I'm getting a call on the other line.

790
01:01:34,170 --> 01:01:35,201
I have to go.

791
01:01:38,940 --> 01:01:40,411
I never told him about dropping my phone...

792
01:01:41,911 --> 01:01:43,081
that day.

793
01:01:44,750 --> 01:01:45,750
Was he...

794
01:01:47,281 --> 01:01:48,880
watching me that night?

795
01:01:54,420 --> 01:01:55,920
(74M 4272)

796
01:01:56,690 --> 01:01:57,761
Did he...

797
01:01:59,290 --> 01:02:00,460
follow me here?

798
01:02:41,871 --> 01:02:44,770
(Nothing Uncovered)

799
01:02:45,158 --> 01:02:47,158
Did you see my wife today?

800
01:02:47,359 --> 01:02:49,589
Her phone is off, and she didn't come home.

801
01:02:49,589 --> 01:02:52,029
Sir, I know who the killer is.

802
01:02:52,029 --> 01:02:54,968
You killed them all! Jin Myung Sook and my sister too.

803
01:02:54,968 --> 01:02:56,169
You are Zeus, aren't you?

804
01:02:56,529 --> 01:02:58,368
- What if something happened? - Hey,

805
01:02:58,368 --> 01:02:59,899
don't tell me...

806
01:02:59,899 --> 01:03:02,069
Did you contact Jung Won or meet her again?

807
01:03:02,069 --> 01:03:03,609
Why? Do you feel anxious?

808
01:03:03,609 --> 01:03:07,379
I want you to be lonelier and more miserable.

809
01:03:07,379 --> 01:03:09,779
I think Jung Won is in danger. I need your help.

810
01:03:09,779 --> 01:03:12,749
If anything bad happens to Jung Won, I really will...
