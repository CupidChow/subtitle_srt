(Episode 3)

7
00:00:30,241 --> 00:00:31,811
Hey, it suits you.

8
00:00:31,971 --> 00:00:34,281
You told me that I had to wear this today.

9
00:00:35,012 --> 00:00:36,181
You look pretty.

10
00:00:37,451 --> 00:00:38,482
Let's go.

11
00:00:43,652 --> 00:00:44,891
It's completely empty.

12
00:01:27,961 --> 00:01:29,002
This is...

13
00:01:31,401 --> 00:01:33,101
our wedding.

14
00:01:37,541 --> 00:01:40,341
So, this is my bridal bouquet?

15
00:01:49,981 --> 00:01:51,591
I know you said you didn't want a wedding,

16
00:01:52,552 --> 00:01:54,862
but you're marrying a business tycoon's son,

17
00:01:55,991 --> 00:01:57,362
so I couldn't completely forgo the ceremony.

18
00:02:13,012 --> 00:02:14,181
This is...

19
00:02:14,811 --> 00:02:16,841
the most romantic moment of my life so far.

20
00:02:21,651 --> 00:02:22,651
Jung Won.

21
00:02:23,552 --> 00:02:25,491
Thank you for being mine.

22
00:02:25,991 --> 00:02:29,491
I'll make sure you can always stay as fragrant and radiant as you are.

23
00:02:32,232 --> 00:02:33,262
I love you.

24
00:03:02,762 --> 00:03:03,961
Hey, Jung Won.

25
00:03:04,561 --> 00:03:06,332
Our wedding ceremony ended in four minutes.

26
00:03:11,001 --> 00:03:12,001
Seol Woo Jae.

27
00:03:13,841 --> 00:03:16,772
Why did you go to Leaders Palace the day Cha Eun Sae died?

28
00:03:31,822 --> 00:03:32,822
Who is it?

29
00:03:32,822 --> 00:03:34,262
I'm a detective from Gangha Police Station.

30
00:03:51,311 --> 00:03:53,072
I'm from Gangha Police Station's Violent Crimes Unit One.

31
00:03:54,281 --> 00:03:55,781
I'm Lieutenant Kim Tae Heon.

32
00:03:56,681 --> 00:03:58,181
Mr. Seol Woo Jae, right?

33
00:03:58,411 --> 00:03:59,411
Yes, what is this about?

34
00:04:00,352 --> 00:04:02,681
- Why are you... - This is about Cha Eun Sae's case.

35
00:04:04,922 --> 00:04:06,591
You'll have to come with me.

36
00:04:12,691 --> 00:04:15,501
Why do you need to interview my husband as a witness?

37
00:04:16,061 --> 00:04:17,231
You can ask him later.

38
00:04:23,502 --> 00:04:24,711
We couldn't reach you,

39
00:04:25,171 --> 00:04:27,171
so I came here to find you.

40
00:04:27,582 --> 00:04:29,882
We need to ask you some questions, so please come with me.

41
00:04:31,111 --> 00:04:32,111
Sure.

42
00:04:34,781 --> 00:04:35,851
I won't be long.

43
00:04:38,051 --> 00:04:39,051
Let's go.

44
00:05:01,312 --> 00:05:02,312
Detective Oh.

45
00:05:02,611 --> 00:05:04,952
Mr. Seol's newest novel,

46
00:05:05,082 --> 00:05:06,952
"Hot Shot." Have you read it?

47
00:05:07,952 --> 00:05:10,992
Well, I only read books when I can't fall asleep.

48
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:13,291
It's good. You have to read it.

49
00:05:13,591 --> 00:05:15,322
A woman in the story...

50
00:05:16,062 --> 00:05:18,132
gets stabbed several times in the stomach and dies.

51
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:20,231
- What? - While writing the book,

52
00:05:20,392 --> 00:05:21,861
you must've gained a lot of criminal knowledge.

53
00:05:24,171 --> 00:05:27,372
But I'm still an amateur compared to you detectives.

54
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:28,572
Mr. Seol.

55
00:05:29,072 --> 00:05:30,372
You must know why...

56
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:32,041
we're interviewing you as a witness in Cha Eun Sae's case.

57
00:05:36,242 --> 00:05:37,981
According to her call history,

58
00:05:38,312 --> 00:05:40,051
you were the person...

59
00:05:40,781 --> 00:05:41,822
she called the most.

60
00:05:42,351 --> 00:05:45,291
And you were the last person she called the day she died.

61
00:05:45,851 --> 00:05:47,291
- Is that so? - "Is that so?"

62
00:05:51,892 --> 00:05:53,231
Cha Eun Sae was your lover, wasn't she?

63
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,731
Cha Eun Sae was my stalker.

64
00:05:55,801 --> 00:05:56,932
You two weren't lovers?

65
00:05:56,932 --> 00:05:58,671
I'm sure you can gather this much from the call log.

66
00:05:58,702 --> 00:06:00,572
She kept calling me. I never called her.

67
00:06:01,442 --> 00:06:02,942
Did you go through her phone?

68
00:06:03,072 --> 00:06:05,111
Did you find anything to prove that we were lovers?

69
00:06:05,772 --> 00:06:07,841
Unfortunately, her phone wasn't found at the scene,

70
00:06:07,841 --> 00:06:08,841
so we couldn't check.

71
00:06:09,142 --> 00:06:10,851
Really? That is unfortunate.

72
00:06:13,151 --> 00:06:15,452
So? She stalked you, and that's it?

73
00:06:18,322 --> 00:06:19,551
I'm a victim too.

74
00:06:19,651 --> 00:06:21,291
When did she start stalking you?

75
00:06:21,692 --> 00:06:24,161
We met last year at an afterparty at the publishing house.

76
00:06:24,531 --> 00:06:27,531
After that, she started getting obsessed with me.

77
00:06:28,031 --> 00:06:31,671
She'd call and visit me whenever she could and get all clingy.

78
00:06:32,372 --> 00:06:33,432
To give you an example.

79
00:06:33,632 --> 00:06:35,742
When was the last time you saw her, then?

80
00:06:37,572 --> 00:06:39,611
She used to show up at my studio unannounced from time to time.

81
00:06:40,471 --> 00:06:42,481
I think I saw her about two weeks ago.

82
00:06:42,882 --> 00:06:45,012
Then approximately at 4pm on October 6,

83
00:06:46,151 --> 00:06:47,981
why did you go to Leaders Palace?

84
00:07:04,531 --> 00:07:07,002
He was there an hour before the estimated time of her death.

85
00:07:08,002 --> 00:07:09,002
Why was he there?

86
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:11,341
I went to the Chinese restaurant on the third floor...

87
00:07:11,341 --> 00:07:12,471
to pick up some food.

88
00:07:12,812 --> 00:07:14,682
Then you'll probably ask me where I went after that.

89
00:07:14,911 --> 00:07:16,242
I went to my studio.

90
00:07:16,411 --> 00:07:19,452
I bet you knew that her agency's office was in that building too.

91
00:07:19,452 --> 00:07:22,382
- No, I didn't know that. - Between 5pm and 8pm that day,

92
00:07:24,492 --> 00:07:25,892
where were you? And what did you do?

93
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:29,392
I was drinking at my studio, alone.

94
00:07:29,392 --> 00:07:30,392
Alone?

95
00:07:30,961 --> 00:07:32,062
You were...

96
00:07:33,031 --> 00:07:34,101
alone?

97
00:07:36,731 --> 00:07:37,872
Cha Eun Sae...

98
00:07:39,101 --> 00:07:40,572
was pregnant.

99
00:07:41,601 --> 00:07:43,702
I thought you were the father of the baby.

100
00:07:44,242 --> 00:07:45,611
But you're saying she stalked you.

101
00:07:46,742 --> 00:07:47,812
I'm quite flustered.

102
00:07:47,812 --> 00:07:49,341
I'm more flustered.

103
00:07:49,611 --> 00:07:51,582
Ask her sponsor, not me.

104
00:07:55,281 --> 00:07:56,281
Oh, wait.

105
00:07:57,281 --> 00:07:58,351
You didn't know?

106
00:07:59,752 --> 00:08:02,062
Cha Eun Sae once told me about her sponsor.

107
00:08:02,361 --> 00:08:04,762
I assumed you'd be looking into it already.

108
00:08:05,231 --> 00:08:06,692
I guess I gave you a hint.

109
00:08:07,661 --> 00:08:08,932
Cha Eun Sae said that?

110
00:08:09,502 --> 00:08:12,002
- Who was her... - She never told me who it was.

111
00:08:12,231 --> 00:08:14,872
Since you two are pros, I believe it's your job to find out.

112
00:08:18,471 --> 00:08:19,971
Hey, why do you keep cutting me off?

113
00:08:20,572 --> 00:08:23,211
The way you're talking tells me that you look down on the police.

114
00:08:23,312 --> 00:08:25,551
- Detective Oh. - Without a thorough investigation,

115
00:08:25,752 --> 00:08:29,252
you concluded that I was her lover, which was unprofessional of you.

116
00:08:29,452 --> 00:08:31,392
At 4:30pm on October 6,

117
00:08:31,392 --> 00:08:33,651
what did Cha Eun Sae say when she called you?

118
00:08:45,431 --> 00:08:46,801
"You obnoxious jerk."

119
00:08:50,772 --> 00:08:51,811
That's what she said.

120
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:56,742
She called me obnoxious because I was married...

121
00:08:57,911 --> 00:08:59,012
and wouldn't like her back.

122
00:09:02,051 --> 00:09:03,352
Are we done?

123
00:09:05,921 --> 00:09:07,122
The interview is done,

124
00:09:07,691 --> 00:09:08,862
but we're collecting DNA samples...

125
00:09:08,862 --> 00:09:10,661
from all witnesses to find the baby's father.

126
00:09:11,492 --> 00:09:13,431
You'll give us your consent to collect a sample from you, right?

127
00:09:14,031 --> 00:09:16,632
Because you're married after all, like you said.

128
00:09:18,201 --> 00:09:21,171
Decline without a valid reason, and we'll get a warrant to do it.

129
00:09:24,342 --> 00:09:25,342
Sign this.

130
00:09:34,821 --> 00:09:36,051
Will you say "ah" for me?

131
00:09:40,421 --> 00:09:41,492
"Ah."

132
00:09:55,102 --> 00:09:57,071
Confirm if Seol ordered Chinese takeout,

133
00:09:57,071 --> 00:09:58,541
from the third floor on the sixth,

134
00:09:58,541 --> 00:10:00,342
and trace his movements for the whole day.

135
00:10:01,482 --> 00:10:03,811
You don't believe that he was stalked, do you?

136
00:10:04,252 --> 00:10:06,411
Can't you tell he's pretending to be a victim?

137
00:10:06,982 --> 00:10:08,951
He's done for once the paternity test comes back.

138
00:10:09,222 --> 00:10:11,892
Cha's sponsor story was just a distraction, right?

139
00:10:11,892 --> 00:10:13,122
Check her bank accounts.

140
00:10:14,862 --> 00:10:17,321
You. Do you have anything on the necklace brand?

141
00:10:17,321 --> 00:10:19,262
They're still on it.

142
00:10:19,392 --> 00:10:20,892
I'll follow up.

143
00:10:23,502 --> 00:10:27,401
(Criminal Investigation)

144
00:10:40,752 --> 00:10:43,581
On October 6 at 4:30pm,

145
00:10:43,581 --> 00:10:45,791
what did Cha Eun Sae say over the phone?

146
00:11:07,781 --> 00:11:09,811
You obnoxious jerk. Listen up.

147
00:11:43,212 --> 00:11:46,281
How's the police reacting to news of Cha Eun Sae's pregnancy?

148
00:11:46,311 --> 00:11:47,512
What about the interrogation?

149
00:11:47,512 --> 00:11:50,451
They questioned her older brother Cha Geum Sae.

150
00:11:50,451 --> 00:11:53,622
That's it? They've questioned one guy so far?

151
00:11:55,561 --> 00:11:56,661
Yes.

152
00:11:56,762 --> 00:11:58,262
The police must be...

153
00:11:58,262 --> 00:12:01,401
focusing on the likelihood that her lover is the killer.

154
00:12:01,602 --> 00:12:03,201
They haven't pinpointed anyone, then?

155
00:12:03,762 --> 00:12:06,102
Will you look into Cha's brother first?

156
00:12:06,102 --> 00:12:08,201
Yes, that's our plan for now.

157
00:12:08,201 --> 00:12:10,401
But he's such a lowlife.

158
00:12:10,671 --> 00:12:12,472
There's talk he could be guilty.

159
00:12:12,472 --> 00:12:13,972
That would be just great.

160
00:12:13,972 --> 00:12:16,482
A brother killing his sister would make for great TV.

161
00:12:16,842 --> 00:12:19,352
Hey, I just remembered something.

162
00:12:19,352 --> 00:12:20,951
A month ago, there was talk...

163
00:12:20,951 --> 00:12:22,951
that Mo Hyung Taek was Cha's sponsor.

164
00:12:23,352 --> 00:12:24,921
Do you remember hearing that?

165
00:12:24,921 --> 00:12:26,651
That's so undignified.

166
00:12:26,651 --> 00:12:28,791
How dare you repeat such trash?

167
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:30,362
You went after him once already!

168
00:12:30,362 --> 00:12:32,331
Don't say anything like that again!

169
00:12:36,632 --> 00:12:39,071
It's not the first time I brought up a rumor.

170
00:12:39,071 --> 00:12:40,301
Why overreact?

171
00:12:40,431 --> 00:12:44,102
Mo Hyung Taek's old enough to be Cha's father.

172
00:12:44,102 --> 00:12:46,041
Isn't it shocking that she was pregnant?

173
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:48,441
It's not. It's fine as long as the guy's single.

174
00:12:48,882 --> 00:12:49,911
It's not fine.

175
00:12:50,142 --> 00:12:51,752
- Hello. - Hello, Mr. Seol.

176
00:12:51,752 --> 00:12:53,151
What did you bring us?

177
00:12:53,151 --> 00:12:54,821
Something to cheer you up.

178
00:12:55,321 --> 00:12:56,921
- You're busy, right? - Yes.

179
00:12:57,382 --> 00:12:58,892
- Can you excuse us? - Sure.

180
00:12:59,451 --> 00:13:00,752
- Follow me. - Okay.

181
00:13:02,321 --> 00:13:03,321
Bye.

182
00:13:08,331 --> 00:13:09,561
The day Cha Eun Sae died.

183
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:12,002
Tell me why you were at Leaders Palace.

184
00:13:12,901 --> 00:13:14,201
Don't say you weren't there.

185
00:13:14,201 --> 00:13:17,272
I have GPS proof your other phone was there.

186
00:13:17,642 --> 00:13:19,441
- What? - That day,

187
00:13:19,441 --> 00:13:21,512
you went there to see Cha, didn't you?

188
00:13:24,811 --> 00:13:27,281
I went to a Chinese restaurant for takeout.

189
00:13:27,852 --> 00:13:29,321
I didn't meet Cha Eun Sae.

190
00:13:29,321 --> 00:13:32,421
The detective must've questioned you because there's proof you did.

191
00:13:32,421 --> 00:13:33,522
It wasn't that.

192
00:13:35,561 --> 00:13:36,691
Cha Eun Sae...

193
00:13:37,931 --> 00:13:40,031
last talked to me before she died.

194
00:13:41,092 --> 00:13:42,201
What?

195
00:13:45,401 --> 00:13:48,041
- What's wrong? Are you okay? - Don't touch me.

196
00:13:49,002 --> 00:13:50,142
Mr. Seol.

197
00:13:50,401 --> 00:13:52,441
How are you, sir?

198
00:13:52,441 --> 00:13:56,112
Sir, you know writer Seol Woo Jae, Ms. Seo's husband, right?

199
00:13:56,112 --> 00:13:57,712
Of course, I do.

200
00:13:57,712 --> 00:13:59,512
Not only do you have his looks,

201
00:13:59,512 --> 00:14:01,522
but you have the aura of your father too.

202
00:14:04,122 --> 00:14:07,321
Were you having a love spat? Shall we let you get on with it?

203
00:14:07,321 --> 00:14:08,661
No, sir.

204
00:14:09,691 --> 00:14:11,962
You should go. You're late for an appointment.

205
00:14:12,262 --> 00:14:14,031
Yes, I am.

206
00:14:15,732 --> 00:14:17,301
Goodbye, then.

207
00:14:17,632 --> 00:14:18,632
Bye.

208
00:14:26,811 --> 00:14:28,911
Cha Eun Sae was my stalker.

209
00:14:29,411 --> 00:14:30,982
I'm sure you can gather this much from the call log.

210
00:14:30,982 --> 00:14:33,112
She kept calling me. I never called her.

211
00:14:33,982 --> 00:14:36,522
Seol Woo Jae did get takeout.

212
00:14:37,081 --> 00:14:38,421
Nothing on the DNA yet, right?

213
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:41,622
What bothered you the most about his interview?

214
00:14:42,262 --> 00:14:43,691
That his expression never changed?

215
00:14:45,531 --> 00:14:46,892
"You obnoxious jerk."

216
00:14:49,561 --> 00:14:51,931
I was just imitating Seol Woo Jae.

217
00:14:51,931 --> 00:14:53,031
Wrong.

218
00:14:54,742 --> 00:14:56,602
Oh, I got it.

219
00:14:57,272 --> 00:14:58,911
That he answered so freely.

220
00:14:58,911 --> 00:15:01,342
As a writer would, he'd written a scenario.

221
00:15:01,342 --> 00:15:02,382
Wrong.

222
00:15:03,612 --> 00:15:05,911
You should've told me to get two sets.

223
00:15:06,281 --> 00:15:07,311
What is it?

224
00:15:09,222 --> 00:15:10,752
Did you go through her phone?

225
00:15:11,921 --> 00:15:14,352
Did you find anything to prove that we were lovers?

226
00:15:14,821 --> 00:15:15,921
What about this?

227
00:15:16,462 --> 00:15:18,862
He could've said that because he had nothing to hide.

228
00:15:19,592 --> 00:15:21,061
What if he had lots to hide,

229
00:15:22,102 --> 00:15:24,632
and he also knew Cha's phone was missing?

230
00:15:26,272 --> 00:15:28,541
Yes. That's right.

231
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:31,311
If he were the killer, he'd have taken her phone.

232
00:15:32,012 --> 00:15:33,842
- What about Cha's accounts? - Right.

233
00:15:34,372 --> 00:15:37,811
I scoured them. How can a celebrity's balance be zero?

234
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:39,651
The credit card company took 15,000 dollars on the tenth,

235
00:15:39,651 --> 00:15:40,752
and there's zero cents left.

236
00:15:40,752 --> 00:15:42,281
Any suspicious deposits or withdrawals?

237
00:15:42,281 --> 00:15:44,622
Nothing other than the monthly payments to her brother.

238
00:15:44,622 --> 00:15:45,722
It's squeaky clean.

239
00:15:48,522 --> 00:15:49,821
Either they left no record...

240
00:15:50,122 --> 00:15:52,561
or there's no sponsor. It's one or the other.

241
00:15:57,632 --> 00:15:59,031
Let's play.

242
00:16:00,372 --> 00:16:01,401
Thanks.

243
00:16:07,712 --> 00:16:09,242
Here. Your drink.

244
00:16:23,992 --> 00:16:25,031
Shoot.

245
00:16:32,571 --> 00:16:33,602
Darn it.

246
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:51,252
Screw this.

247
00:17:01,862 --> 00:17:04,801
This is driving me insane.

248
00:17:05,131 --> 00:17:06,631
Just insane.

249
00:17:08,371 --> 00:17:09,772
You didn't win tonight?

250
00:17:10,301 --> 00:17:12,672
I'm Seo Jung Won from "Nothing Uncovered."

251
00:17:12,672 --> 00:17:15,311
Can I interview you outside?

252
00:17:17,281 --> 00:17:19,081
You brought a camera?

253
00:17:20,081 --> 00:17:22,422
I have nothing to say. Leave me alone.

254
00:17:22,422 --> 00:17:24,752
We'll take an in-depth look at Cha Eun Sae's death.

255
00:17:25,091 --> 00:17:27,091
Your sister died an untimely death.

256
00:17:27,091 --> 00:17:28,791
Shouldn't you have lots to say?

257
00:17:31,762 --> 00:17:33,262
I told you to leave me alone.

258
00:17:33,262 --> 00:17:34,831
What is wrong with you?

259
00:17:36,101 --> 00:17:38,732
Cha Geum Sae's gambling site ID is "Ten Thousand Percent."

260
00:17:38,732 --> 00:17:39,801
Mr. Cha.

261
00:17:39,801 --> 00:17:41,841
We're also looking into gambling sites.

262
00:17:42,371 --> 00:17:44,301
Your sister's death or gambling.

263
00:17:44,301 --> 00:17:46,012
Which episode do you want to be in?

264
00:17:46,012 --> 00:17:47,071
What the heck?

265
00:17:47,972 --> 00:17:49,742
Is this an outright threat?

266
00:17:50,942 --> 00:17:53,012
Don't you know casinos are just for fun?

267
00:17:53,012 --> 00:17:55,252
I'm talking about illegal gambling sites.

268
00:17:55,252 --> 00:17:56,522
The ID "Ten Thousand Percent."

269
00:17:57,381 --> 00:17:58,551
It's yours, isn't it?

270
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:02,992
I've dealt with enough reporters in my time.

271
00:18:03,492 --> 00:18:05,232
Do you take me for a pushover?

272
00:18:06,462 --> 00:18:09,101
I know so many people in that field.

273
00:18:09,902 --> 00:18:11,002
Hello?

274
00:18:11,262 --> 00:18:13,101
What? You scratched...

275
00:18:15,772 --> 00:18:18,111
Stay where you are, your head on the ground.

276
00:18:19,912 --> 00:18:21,581
Darn it!

277
00:18:28,781 --> 00:18:31,222
Where is it? Where's the scratch?

278
00:18:31,992 --> 00:18:34,791
Darn it. Where are you?

279
00:18:35,162 --> 00:18:36,391
Screw it.

280
00:18:36,391 --> 00:18:37,762
You just wouldn't pick up.

281
00:18:37,762 --> 00:18:39,631
I thought your phone was broken but it wasn't.

282
00:18:40,492 --> 00:18:42,432
My gosh.

283
00:18:45,202 --> 00:18:46,672
We got to him first.

284
00:18:46,672 --> 00:18:48,202
My investigation comes before your interview.

285
00:18:48,202 --> 00:18:50,502
Turn off the camera. You, get in the car.

286
00:18:50,502 --> 00:18:52,942
What for? Why should I get in the car?

287
00:18:53,242 --> 00:18:55,381
Are you arresting me or something?

288
00:18:57,281 --> 00:18:58,351
Hey!

289
00:18:58,452 --> 00:19:00,881
Don't turn off that thing. Film this.

290
00:19:00,881 --> 00:19:03,452
I'm the victim's family, and the detective...

291
00:19:03,452 --> 00:19:05,522
is treating me like a murderer. Film it all!

292
00:19:05,821 --> 00:19:08,291
What's that thing you want to do?

293
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:10,522
Tell the viewers the truth, right?

294
00:19:10,522 --> 00:19:11,591
Film it all.

295
00:19:11,831 --> 00:19:13,162
If you want it all to come out...

296
00:19:13,162 --> 00:19:14,861
Hey. Darn you.

297
00:19:14,861 --> 00:19:17,502
What was that about?

298
00:19:17,732 --> 00:19:20,071
Your sister hit you with her bag, so you strangled her.

299
00:19:20,071 --> 00:19:21,742
Three days before she died.

300
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:24,601
The victim was stabbed to death,

301
00:19:24,601 --> 00:19:26,272
and two weeks before that, you threatened her with a knife.

302
00:19:26,272 --> 00:19:27,742
You don't have an alibi for the day of the murder either.

303
00:19:27,742 --> 00:19:29,081
Gosh. I wonder...

304
00:19:29,081 --> 00:19:31,041
what the viewers will think of you once this airs on TV.

305
00:19:33,281 --> 00:19:36,051
According to our investigation, you collected 300,000 dollars...

306
00:19:36,152 --> 00:19:37,581
as the accidental death insurance claim...

307
00:19:37,581 --> 00:19:38,621
on your sister's insurance policy.

308
00:19:39,192 --> 00:19:40,252
The gambling debt you owed...

309
00:19:40,252 --> 00:19:42,462
happened to be 300,000 dollars as well.

310
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:44,222
Gosh. Unbelievable.

311
00:19:46,962 --> 00:19:48,601
What's your point?

312
00:19:48,831 --> 00:19:51,462
Are you implying that I killed my own sister to pay back the debt?

313
00:19:51,462 --> 00:19:52,502
Are you writing a novel?

314
00:19:52,502 --> 00:19:55,101
Don't get sidetracked. Tell me why you choked your sister.

315
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:59,341
Because she kept making me mad.

316
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:01,781
Think about how angry I must've been to choke my sister.

317
00:20:01,781 --> 00:20:03,712
Exactly. Why did you get angry?

318
00:20:03,712 --> 00:20:05,281
She went through all this trouble to become successful.

319
00:20:05,652 --> 00:20:07,581
But she said she was going to retire and started to act up!

320
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:08,581
I'm done here.

321
00:20:08,581 --> 00:20:10,351
You couldn't milk her anymore, so you must've wanted to kill her.

322
00:20:10,351 --> 00:20:11,992
I didn't kill her. Darn it!

323
00:20:12,121 --> 00:20:14,121
She already knew that she was going to die.

324
00:20:14,962 --> 00:20:16,162
What do you mean?

325
00:20:16,522 --> 00:20:18,061
That's what she said before she died.

326
00:20:18,331 --> 00:20:20,762
She said so many people were trying to kill her,

327
00:20:20,762 --> 00:20:22,902
and one of them was a murderer or something.

328
00:20:22,902 --> 00:20:24,732
- So who is that murderer? - I have no idea.

329
00:20:25,101 --> 00:20:27,932
I asked her to clarify the nonsense, but she ignored me to the end.

330
00:20:30,071 --> 00:20:31,101
You know what?

331
00:20:31,672 --> 00:20:33,712
I'm her bereaved family who deserves compassion!

332
00:20:33,972 --> 00:20:35,242
Not the culprit!

333
00:20:35,712 --> 00:20:37,512
Keep filming. I'm sorry for yelling at you earlier.

334
00:20:37,641 --> 00:20:38,652
I'm filming.

335
00:20:41,051 --> 00:20:42,121
Come and pick up the phone.

336
00:20:45,522 --> 00:20:46,752
Let's stop here for today.

337
00:20:47,422 --> 00:20:49,391
I'll request another meeting with you later.

338
00:20:49,591 --> 00:20:50,992
Sure. Whatever.

339
00:20:55,762 --> 00:20:57,301
Someone was sponsoring Cha Eun Sae, right?

340
00:21:00,972 --> 00:21:02,141
What nonsense is that?

341
00:21:12,611 --> 00:21:14,881
This is driving me crazy. You know?

342
00:21:15,222 --> 00:21:17,422
The detectives are on my case for not having an alibi.

343
00:21:17,621 --> 00:21:19,922
Seo Jung Won has been harassing me to air her episode on TV.

344
00:21:20,051 --> 00:21:21,962
Come on. Step on it, you jerk!

345
00:21:22,022 --> 00:21:24,262
As long as your conscience is clear, there's no problem. Is there?

346
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:27,432
If you don't trust me along with the others,

347
00:21:28,561 --> 00:21:29,932
I would be greatly disappointed.

348
00:21:33,071 --> 00:21:34,202
Let's meet soon.

349
00:21:40,912 --> 00:21:43,281
("Actress Cha Eun Sae of 'Dating My Ex-Husband' Dead")

350
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:53,522
You couldn't restore anything from the phone?

351
00:21:53,652 --> 00:21:55,692
The mainboard was completely fried.

352
00:21:55,891 --> 00:21:58,022
I tried everything to restore it, but I couldn't.

353
00:22:17,381 --> 00:22:19,012
Where are you going at this hour?

354
00:22:19,152 --> 00:22:20,581
The police...

355
00:22:20,982 --> 00:22:22,922
collected my DNA, and the results came out.

356
00:22:27,291 --> 00:22:28,291
Get in.

357
00:22:52,712 --> 00:22:53,912
We're meeting twice in one day.

358
00:22:53,912 --> 00:22:54,912
Tell us the results...

359
00:22:54,912 --> 00:22:56,781
of the DNA comparison test you ran with my husband's sample.

360
00:23:06,962 --> 00:23:08,162
They weren't a match.

361
00:23:12,932 --> 00:23:15,442
That means this will be the last time we meet.

362
00:23:15,442 --> 00:23:17,371
I'm not sure. I get the feeling we'll meet again.

363
00:23:17,902 --> 00:23:19,341
Are you going to stay behind to talk to him?

364
00:23:20,041 --> 00:23:22,081
- Why would I do that? - In case you had more to discuss.

365
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:24,742
I heard that you and the detective knew each other very well.

366
00:23:26,212 --> 00:23:27,252
Not at all.

367
00:23:30,682 --> 00:23:33,621
I thought we were close. That's why I told you the results.

368
00:23:35,462 --> 00:23:36,891
But from now on, I must strictly be professional.

369
00:23:39,091 --> 00:23:41,561
Now that I'm seeing you together, I can tell you make a good couple.

370
00:23:42,202 --> 00:23:43,531
What a lovely couple you are.

371
00:24:07,152 --> 00:24:08,192
Alcohol is calling me.

372
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:10,662
Come on. You were hospitalized because of cirrhosis.

373
00:24:13,462 --> 00:24:15,902
Tae Heon. I know that this is pretty lame.

374
00:24:15,932 --> 00:24:17,031
But as you know,

375
00:24:17,031 --> 00:24:18,732
the fact that she had a sponsor is such personal news.

376
00:24:19,502 --> 00:24:21,672
Did you go through the tabloids from the financial sector?

377
00:24:21,801 --> 00:24:23,541
I thought only a couple of men would be involved.

378
00:24:23,541 --> 00:24:26,141
But at least five men have been named as her sponsors.

379
00:24:26,841 --> 00:24:28,641
A son of an advertiser, a movie director,

380
00:24:28,641 --> 00:24:29,682
a middle-aged actor,

381
00:24:29,682 --> 00:24:31,912
the CEO of her former agency, a lawyer, and an assemblyman.

382
00:24:31,912 --> 00:24:32,952
This is the list.

383
00:24:33,351 --> 00:24:36,952
Here's an interesting fact. You met one of the men on this list.

384
00:24:41,422 --> 00:24:42,462
Mo Hyung Taek?

385
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:54,031
Since when and why did you start carrying a second phone?

386
00:24:56,172 --> 00:24:57,472
I had it before we got married.

387
00:24:58,301 --> 00:25:00,141
It was tiring to answer trifling phone calls,

388
00:25:00,341 --> 00:25:01,341
So I used it as a cover phone.

389
00:25:02,611 --> 00:25:03,781
Why did you hide it from me?

390
00:25:05,381 --> 00:25:06,381
I didn't hide it from you.

391
00:25:06,381 --> 00:25:07,912
I rarely used it, so I didn't tell you.

392
00:25:08,081 --> 00:25:09,321
I didn't know about it,

393
00:25:09,522 --> 00:25:11,522
but Cha Eun Sae knew about your second phone.

394
00:25:11,652 --> 00:25:13,321
I have no idea how she found out about it.

395
00:25:13,652 --> 00:25:14,952
This wasn't the only thing.

396
00:25:14,952 --> 00:25:17,561
She knew my plate number and my office's address.

397
00:25:20,662 --> 00:25:22,531
You blocked her number on your primary phone.

398
00:25:22,962 --> 00:25:25,202
But why didn't you block her number on your second phone?

399
00:25:30,101 --> 00:25:31,242
She threatened me.

400
00:25:31,641 --> 00:25:32,972
She said she would kill herself if I blocked her number again.

401
00:25:34,311 --> 00:25:36,412
She was more than capable of doing that.

402
00:25:37,141 --> 00:25:39,381
I really had no other choice, Jung Won.

403
00:25:39,381 --> 00:25:41,551
If you were a victim and had nothing to hide,

404
00:25:42,752 --> 00:25:44,152
I wonder why you dumped your second phone.

405
00:25:44,222 --> 00:25:45,291
Because it broke.

406
00:25:48,722 --> 00:25:51,321
What matters here is the result of the paternity test.

407
00:25:51,762 --> 00:25:53,031
"A hundred pieces of circumstantial evidence..."

408
00:25:53,031 --> 00:25:54,091
"cannot beat one piece of hard evidence."

409
00:25:54,831 --> 00:25:56,131
That's your motto, isn't it?

410
00:26:00,902 --> 00:26:02,141
I went to my office after the interview yesterday...

411
00:26:02,141 --> 00:26:03,172
and thought about this.

412
00:26:03,702 --> 00:26:05,212
The day before she died,

413
00:26:05,212 --> 00:26:06,912
she told you she and I were in a relationship.

414
00:26:07,041 --> 00:26:08,242
When I heard that, I thought she might've done that...

415
00:26:08,242 --> 00:26:10,012
because she was abnormally obsessed with me.

416
00:26:10,341 --> 00:26:12,712
But why did it have to be on the day you and I went to the building?

417
00:26:12,712 --> 00:26:15,381
On top of that, why was she murdered right after calling me?

418
00:26:16,652 --> 00:26:18,752
I really don't understand why it had to be...

419
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:19,752
at that moment on that day.

420
00:26:20,992 --> 00:26:22,992
Am I the only one who finds this suspicious?

421
00:26:22,992 --> 00:26:24,022
Don't you find it suspicious?

422
00:26:25,192 --> 00:26:27,031
It's more natural to speculate...

423
00:26:27,291 --> 00:26:30,462
that this was all set up and that someone is after me or you.

424
00:26:30,462 --> 00:26:31,702
That person must be the culprit, right?

425
00:26:36,442 --> 00:26:38,041
Both of us should think closely...

426
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:41,912
to see if there's anyone who might want to do that to us.

00:27:13,912 --> 00:27:16,881
Wait. Did you have an appointment today?

430
00:27:17,012 --> 00:27:18,952
I'm here about Cha Eun Sae's case.

431
00:27:19,152 --> 00:27:20,952
Could I talk to you outside for five minutes?

432
00:27:30,522 --> 00:27:33,462
I could have ended up at the murder scene that day.

433
00:27:33,692 --> 00:27:34,732
Oh, that.

434
00:27:35,631 --> 00:27:38,131
I was supposed to type Unit 1201, not Unit 1401.

435
00:27:38,131 --> 00:27:39,432
I really don't know how I made that mistake.

436
00:27:39,571 --> 00:27:42,402
You sent the message that day with your phone, didn't you?

437
00:27:42,742 --> 00:27:44,002
No, I sent it through my computer.

438
00:27:44,402 --> 00:27:48,012
I sent the correct unit number to all the other patients that day,

439
00:27:48,781 --> 00:27:51,841
but I don't know how only you ended up...

440
00:27:51,912 --> 00:27:53,581

443
00:28:13,801 --> 00:28:16,571
This can't be true. Right?

444
00:28:21,041 --> 00:28:23,081
(Are you all right? Did you know about them?)

446
00:28:27,381 --> 00:28:28,851

447
00:28:28,952 --> 00:28:31,422
I tried everything to restore it, but I couldn't.

It was a piece of cake.

465
00:29:16,375 --> 00:29:17,675
He emailed and called the reporter too.

466
00:29:17,804 --> 00:29:19,074
- His number is... - Zero, one, zero,

467
00:29:19,074 --> 00:29:20,314
zero, two, four, two, three, five, three, five.

I'm only going to ask once.

No.

Are you asking because you really don't know?

Wait! Here he comes!

Is it true you were the late Cha Eun Sae's lover, Mr. Seol?

Yes, that's the place.

Well, I got caught red-handed by your husband.

502

What do you mean by my husband?

503
00:33:30,357 --> 00:33:31,387

Yes.

Seol Woo Jae.

519
00:35:17,268 --> 00:35:20,538
Why does he make women grow impatient?

520
00:35:25,137 --> 00:35:27,777
Why can't that woman and I come...

521
00:35:27,777 --> 00:35:29,078
to our senses?

522
00:35:29,878 --> 00:35:31,277
Tell us one by one.

523
00:35:32,947 --> 00:35:34,447
Only that part was the same.

524
00:35:35,277 --> 00:35:36,348
The last part.

525
00:35:44,958 --> 00:35:45,998
Really?

526
00:35:50,168 --> 00:35:51,197
Gosh.

527
00:35:58,768 --> 00:36:00,007
Should I stop?

528
00:36:12,757 --> 00:36:13,958
I love you, Eun Sae.

Hey, you saw the article, right?

531
00:36:43,717 --> 00:36:46,387
- I did. - I'm sorry to put you in the spot.

532
00:36:46,918 --> 00:36:48,887
I'll explain the photo later.

533
00:36:49,527 --> 00:36:53,058
With today's false report, what has become clear is that...

534
00:36:55,128 --> 00:36:58,297
someone is trying to set us up using Cha Eun Sae's case.

535
00:37:09,607 --> 00:37:10,808
What is it?

536
00:37:13,177 --> 00:37:14,618
It's just strangely absurd.

537
00:37:16,418 --> 00:37:17,447
I'll see you later.

(Novelist Seol Woo Jae denies dating the late Cha Eun Sae)

539
00:38:05,598 --> 00:38:07,567
I only love my wife.

540
00:38:09,168 --> 00:38:10,308
And I'll only love her...

541
00:38:11,808 --> 00:38:13,438
until my last breath.

(He will only love his wife until his last breath.)

545
00:38:38,527 --> 00:38:39,538
Woo Jae.

546
00:38:41,337 --> 00:38:42,337
Woo Jae.

547
00:38:44,567 --> 00:38:47,107
I told your wife everything.

548
00:38:47,708 --> 00:38:50,107
Next, I'll tell the press.

549
00:38:52,447 --> 00:38:55,447
You can't get away from me now, honey.

550
00:38:57,018 --> 00:38:58,018
I love you.

551
00:39:35,418 --> 00:39:37,887
Are you out of your mind? Don't you see the lights?

552
00:39:37,987 --> 00:39:39,558
What's wrong with you?

553
00:39:50,007 --> 00:39:51,607
The person you have reached is...

554
00:40:04,918 --> 00:40:07,257
I was watching for a while. You're slow to catch on.

555
00:40:08,958 --> 00:40:10,257
Is this some kind of...

556
00:40:11,357 --> 00:40:12,587
surveillance?

557
00:40:12,898 --> 00:40:13,998
I was just looking.

558
00:40:14,458 --> 00:40:17,768
And wondering why you're the mess you are.

559
00:40:18,527 --> 00:40:20,998
"Was this loser always like this?"

560
00:40:21,938 --> 00:40:23,107
That's all.

561
00:40:24,907 --> 00:40:25,978
You have...

562
00:40:26,777 --> 00:40:27,808
a twisted mind.

563
00:40:30,547 --> 00:40:32,507
It's better than having a twisted character.

564
00:40:34,878 --> 00:40:35,987
You punk.

565
00:40:36,518 --> 00:40:39,148
You called your lover a stalker because the dead can't talk?

566
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:43,228
You say that even after...

567
00:40:43,728 --> 00:40:45,427
you saw the DNA results?

568
00:40:45,427 --> 00:40:46,958
A video of you sleeping with her.

569
00:40:48,657 --> 00:40:49,898
I have it.

570
00:40:50,868 --> 00:40:52,368
So does Ms. Seo.

571
00:40:52,527 --> 00:40:55,398
Your wife saw that video.

572
00:41:01,137 --> 00:41:03,507
"I love you, Eun Sae?"

573
00:41:15,788 --> 00:41:17,628
You'll spend more time with me soon.

574
00:41:18,788 --> 00:41:19,828
As a suspect.

575
00:41:34,007 --> 00:41:35,038
Detective.

576
00:41:40,547 --> 00:41:43,788
There's something I didn't tell you.

577
00:42:28,128 --> 00:42:29,197
Jung Won.

578
00:42:36,237 --> 00:42:37,337
Stop it.

579
00:42:38,737 --> 00:42:39,737
Let go!

580
00:42:41,777 --> 00:42:43,277
You had an opportunity.

581
00:42:43,907 --> 00:42:47,078
If you'd admitted to the affair when I found your other phone,

582
00:42:47,878 --> 00:42:49,177
it wouldn't have come to this.

583
00:42:51,248 --> 00:42:54,518
You slept with a woman imitating your wife in your studio.

584
00:42:54,987 --> 00:42:56,527
You whispered you loved her.

585
00:42:58,788 --> 00:43:00,228
And she stalked you?

586
00:43:01,357 --> 00:43:02,458
You son of a witch.

587
00:43:02,458 --> 00:43:04,128
It's true that she stalked me.

588
00:43:05,398 --> 00:43:07,297
I rejected her, but she kept on...

589
00:43:07,297 --> 00:43:09,067
So how many times did you sleep with her?

590
00:43:10,768 --> 00:43:13,137
Did you enjoy it? How different was she from me?

591
00:43:15,538 --> 00:43:16,547
What?

592
00:43:17,248 --> 00:43:18,277
You don't want to hear it?

593
00:43:19,007 --> 00:43:20,047
Does it hurt?

594
00:43:20,217 --> 00:43:21,578
Could you hurt more than me?

595
00:43:22,717 --> 00:43:23,748
Calm down and...

596
00:43:24,748 --> 00:43:26,657
If I hadn't seen that disgusting video,

597
00:43:28,257 --> 00:43:29,728
you'd have lied to me forever.

598
00:43:30,857 --> 00:43:32,427
You almost had me.

599
00:43:32,788 --> 00:43:34,927
You must think it's such a shame.

600
00:43:34,998 --> 00:43:36,527
- Jung Won. - What?

601
00:43:40,197 --> 00:43:41,598
Did you like her that much?

602
00:43:42,168 --> 00:43:44,668
Why did you like her? What was it about her?

603
00:43:45,708 --> 00:43:47,777
Tell me. I want an answer!

604
00:43:58,188 --> 00:43:59,657
She hungered for love.

605
00:44:01,058 --> 00:44:03,328
I felt sorry that she was tormented with loneliness.

606
00:44:04,958 --> 00:44:06,228
She reminded me of myself.

607
00:44:09,527 --> 00:44:10,868
You call that an excuse?

608
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:14,368
From the moment I pursued you and up until now,

609
00:44:16,868 --> 00:44:18,407
as much as I loved you...

610
00:44:22,708 --> 00:44:25,208
I never felt loved back.

611
00:44:27,078 --> 00:44:29,118
Gratitude and comfort. That was it.

612
00:44:38,387 --> 00:44:40,357
We got married because I loved you more,

613
00:44:41,128 --> 00:44:43,427
but I wanted to be noticed and loved too.

614
00:44:43,668 --> 00:44:45,668
"Let's not expect too much. Let's not yearn for more."

615
00:44:45,668 --> 00:44:47,098
I told myself that, but it was hard.

616
00:44:47,938 --> 00:44:49,467
You only care about your job,

617
00:44:49,467 --> 00:44:51,308
and you don't know how lonely that makes me feel.

618
00:44:55,677 --> 00:44:56,677
Yes.

619
00:44:57,848 --> 00:44:59,407
I'm swamped with work,

620
00:45:00,047 --> 00:45:01,248
and I can't express myself.

621
00:45:01,817 --> 00:45:03,148
Let's say you're right about all that.

622
00:45:04,317 --> 00:45:07,357
So what? Is it my fault you had an affair?

623
00:45:12,857 --> 00:45:13,898
Cha Eun Sae.

624
00:45:14,657 --> 00:45:15,797
You killed her, didn't you?

625
00:45:30,607 --> 00:45:32,708
He went into the building then,

626
00:45:33,078 --> 00:45:36,078
and left at around 9pm which is when the motorcycle's camera filmed him?

627
00:45:36,447 --> 00:45:37,487
Yes.

628
00:45:38,288 --> 00:45:40,657
The motorcyclist found it and asked me to give this to you.

629
00:45:41,487 --> 00:45:42,518
Thanks.

630
00:45:54,438 --> 00:45:56,407
I have an alibi for Eun Sae's time of death.

631
00:45:56,407 --> 00:45:58,407
I told the detective what it was.

632
00:45:58,538 --> 00:45:59,907
So what if you have an alibi?

633
00:46:00,837 --> 00:46:03,208
Did you hire someone to kill her for you?

634
00:46:03,578 --> 00:46:04,578
What?

635
00:46:05,578 --> 00:46:07,118
You brought it up...

636
00:46:07,118 --> 00:46:09,248
by saying someone was trying to frame us.

637
00:46:13,058 --> 00:46:14,987
I know you're upset, but don't cross the line.

638
00:46:14,987 --> 00:46:16,628
You crossed the line first.

639
00:46:17,027 --> 00:46:18,688
You kept on lying.

640
00:46:19,288 --> 00:46:21,927
Because of you, my dream is shattered!

641
00:46:25,168 --> 00:46:26,337
To me,

642
00:46:26,498 --> 00:46:29,668
you're the prime suspect of Cha Eun Sae's murder.

643
00:46:32,407 --> 00:46:33,478
Jung Won.

644
00:46:35,038 --> 00:46:36,848
You're not thinking straight.

645
00:46:37,047 --> 00:46:38,107
You got that right.

646
00:46:38,947 --> 00:46:40,717
Now watch how far...

647
00:46:41,047 --> 00:46:42,478
a crazed wife will go.

648
00:46:57,768 --> 00:46:59,938
He appears so sweet on TV.

649
00:47:00,237 --> 00:47:01,368
He acts so different here.

650
00:47:01,668 --> 00:47:03,808
Why was Seol so angry that day?

651
00:47:04,137 --> 00:47:05,768
I was rude to him.

652
00:47:06,168 --> 00:47:07,337
However rude you were,

653
00:47:07,337 --> 00:47:09,378
this kind of disturbance is an obstruction of business.

654
00:47:09,607 --> 00:47:10,848
Why didn't you report him?

655
00:47:12,277 --> 00:47:13,277
Excuse me.

656
00:47:14,777 --> 00:47:16,848
I told him not to report it.

657
00:47:17,788 --> 00:47:20,418
He came back the next day and apologized profusely.

658
00:47:21,018 --> 00:47:22,987
I didn't think we'd meet again like this.

659
00:47:23,387 --> 00:47:25,887
You are still investigating Ms. Jin's death, right?

660
00:47:26,398 --> 00:47:27,427
Of course, we are.

661
00:47:27,427 --> 00:47:30,098
It'll take a while, but we'll catch the killer.

(AM Radio)

663
00:48:02,197 --> 00:48:03,467
I love you, Eun Sae.

664
00:49:53,249 --> 00:49:54,289
You were here.

665
00:49:57,789 --> 00:49:59,258
How do you know the passcode?

666
00:49:59,996 --> 00:50:00,996
She told me about the passcode...

667
00:50:00,996 --> 00:50:02,865
she was going to use for this house after moving in.

668
00:50:04,766 --> 00:50:07,336
She said her passcode was going to be the same as her lover's.

669
00:50:11,275 --> 00:50:12,405
Look at this jerk.

670
00:50:13,976 --> 00:50:15,315
You are indeed Eun Sae's lover.

671
00:50:21,586 --> 00:50:22,655
Well...

672
00:50:26,826 --> 00:50:27,896
You jerk.

673
00:50:28,295 --> 00:50:30,996
Should I round up all the reporters including your wife...

674
00:50:30,996 --> 00:50:32,826
and hold a press conference?

675
00:50:33,226 --> 00:50:34,695
I'll tell them you were her lover...

676
00:50:34,695 --> 00:50:36,635
and killed her because she was pregnant. Darn it.

677
00:50:39,505 --> 00:50:40,576
Look at you.

678
00:50:42,106 --> 00:50:44,405
If you don't want to be labeled as an adulterer and a murderer,

679
00:50:44,405 --> 00:50:46,045
here's your chance to ensure that I stay quiet.

680
00:50:50,916 --> 00:50:52,786
- So it all comes down to money. - Did you just smirk?

681
00:50:55,786 --> 00:50:57,726
How dare you smirk at me?

682
00:50:59,786 --> 00:51:00,925
Darn it.

683
00:51:08,936 --> 00:51:10,005
Forget about money.

684
00:51:10,505 --> 00:51:12,536
This is a much easier way to keep you quiet.

685
00:51:14,036 --> 00:51:16,106
Hold a press conference or whatnot. Go ahead.

686
00:51:17,045 --> 00:51:19,545
The baby she was carrying wasn't mine.

687
00:51:20,115 --> 00:51:21,545
I also have an alibi.

688
00:51:31,425 --> 00:51:35,496
You see, Eun Sae relied on me a lot.

689
00:51:35,525 --> 00:51:36,726
Is that so?

690
00:51:36,726 --> 00:51:38,126
She trusted me to the point that she asked me...

691
00:51:38,126 --> 00:51:39,865
to hold onto the evidence photos that proved you beat her.

692
00:51:41,996 --> 00:51:43,865
What would happen if I were to disclose these photos...

693
00:51:43,865 --> 00:51:45,135
and the medical certificate to the public?

694
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:48,076
"He constantly beat his sister up for money."

695
00:51:48,076 --> 00:51:50,345
"In the end, he killed her." Wouldn't they suspect that?

696
00:51:51,545 --> 00:51:52,545
Hey.

697
00:51:53,005 --> 00:51:54,815
Shut your mouth, you murderer.

698
00:51:54,815 --> 00:51:57,416
Did you know I was the last person she called before she died?

699
00:51:58,445 --> 00:52:01,115
She said she had to hang up because you had arrived.

700
00:52:04,286 --> 00:52:05,586
That's why...

701
00:52:06,356 --> 00:52:07,925
I thought you were the murderer.

702
00:52:12,266 --> 00:52:14,465
You must have lost your mind, you scumbag.

703
00:52:14,896 --> 00:52:15,936
Did you...

704
00:52:18,036 --> 00:52:19,235
really not kill her?

707
00:52:51,299 --> 00:52:52,730
He was with a woman.

708
00:52:53,540 --> 00:52:54,540
That's why he didn't disclose...

709
00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:55,739
- his alibi right away. - Pardon?

710
00:52:57,739 --> 00:52:58,940
Who is this woman?

711
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:04,879
A woman he doesn't want Seo Jung Won and me to find out.

712
00:53:05,310 --> 00:53:06,650
He was seeing another woman?

Tae Heon.

714
00:53:11,549 --> 00:53:13,819
They've figured out the brand of the necklace Cha Eun Sae was holding.

715
00:53:13,819 --> 00:53:15,359
It's from Harry Joyce, the luxury brand.

716
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:16,420
Harry Joyce?

(Jewelry and High Jewelry, Necklaces)

719
00:53:23,029 --> 00:53:24,299
I only see women's necklaces.

720
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:26,069
So they don't sell men's necklaces, right?

721
00:53:26,529 --> 00:53:28,699
Then it's highly likely that the culprit is a woman.

722
00:53:34,839 --> 00:53:35,839
The person you have reached is unavailable.

723
00:53:35,839 --> 00:53:37,150
- You'll be redirected to... - Why isn't she answering her phone?

724
00:53:37,409 --> 00:53:38,449
Sir.

(Investigative Planning Team)

726
00:53:40,549 --> 00:53:43,049
You know the mess we are in! What took you so long?

727
00:53:43,890 --> 00:53:45,819
Now that you have no shot at presenting the 9pm news,

728
00:53:45,819 --> 00:53:46,859
you'll just do whatever you want?

729
00:53:46,859 --> 00:53:48,290
After the article about my husband got published,

730
00:53:48,290 --> 00:53:49,759
I needed time to check some facts.

731
00:53:49,759 --> 00:53:50,759
I don't want to hear it.

732
00:53:50,759 --> 00:53:51,989
- Just tell me... - I'll tell you the truth.

733
00:53:51,989 --> 00:53:53,190
My husband did have an affair.

734
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:57,000
He did have an affair.

735
00:53:57,299 --> 00:53:59,370
But he wasn't the father of Cha Eun Sae's baby.

736
00:53:59,629 --> 00:54:01,600
What? That doesn't make sense.

737
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:04,540
Your husband and Cha Eun Sae had an affair.

738
00:54:04,540 --> 00:54:05,640
How would you know that?

739
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:08,509
The police confirmed it with the paternity test.

740
00:54:08,679 --> 00:54:09,909
The DNA wasn't a match.

741
00:54:09,909 --> 00:54:12,679
Hold on. What's going on right now?

742
00:54:13,879 --> 00:54:15,120
She was seeing another man?

743
00:54:15,379 --> 00:54:16,620
I'll investigate and find out.

744
00:54:16,620 --> 00:54:19,620
Even if he wasn't the baby's father, your husband might be the culprit.

745
00:54:20,219 --> 00:54:21,890
You'll keep investigating this?

746
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:23,659
If a wife investigates her cheating husband to find out...

747
00:54:23,659 --> 00:54:24,960
whether or not he is the culprit...

748
00:54:25,390 --> 00:54:26,960
and exposes her findings on her show,

749
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:28,600
what would happen?

750
00:54:29,629 --> 00:54:31,199
I'm sure our ratings will skyrocket like you've never seen before...

751
00:54:31,199 --> 00:54:32,730
and our show will go viral.

752
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:35,540
You'll pass up a good chance like this?

753
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:40,210
Seo Jung Won is known to uncover these evil people's dirty secrets.

754
00:54:40,210 --> 00:54:43,239
But she failed to see that her own husband was the culprit.

755
00:54:43,710 --> 00:54:46,179
When the viewers watch this, do you think they will accept it?

756
00:54:46,279 --> 00:54:48,650
The viewers want me, his wife, not just a random reporter,

757
00:54:48,650 --> 00:54:50,920
to investigate this case.

758
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:52,589
I don't think this is right.

759
00:54:52,589 --> 00:54:54,719
This can end the program.

760
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:57,259
I'm against her leading this investigation.

761
00:54:57,259 --> 00:54:59,029
It is indeed a bit extreme.

762
00:54:59,330 --> 00:55:01,560
Instead of defending your husband,

763
00:55:02,199 --> 00:55:05,270
you will be a reporter who uncovers the dirty secrets of your husband?

764
00:55:05,529 --> 00:55:07,040
This isn't right, sir.

765
00:55:15,109 --> 00:55:16,239
I moved out.

766
00:55:19,679 --> 00:55:21,020
I'll catch up on the backlog first.

767
00:55:24,328 --> 00:55:26,997
(Necklaces)

768
00:55:26,997 --> 00:55:28,698
I was too busy fighting with that guy.

769
00:55:28,698 --> 00:55:30,667
I didn't know he came with a woman.

770
00:55:32,067 --> 00:55:34,408
Then you probably can't remember at all how she looked like.

771
00:55:34,837 --> 00:55:35,837
- Nothing? - No.

772
00:55:36,138 --> 00:55:37,207
Not even a facial feature?

773
00:55:37,207 --> 00:55:39,578
Come on. I see hundreds of customers at the cafe.

774
00:55:39,578 --> 00:55:41,808
How do you expect me to remember everyone's face?

775
00:55:47,118 --> 00:55:48,118
Thank you.

776
00:55:51,287 --> 00:55:53,787
Seol Woo Jae must have greased him just like you predicted.

777
00:55:54,187 --> 00:55:55,187
I'm getting more suspicious now.

778
00:55:56,488 --> 00:55:58,558
Go back in and watch the security footage from Leaders Palace.

779
00:55:58,558 --> 00:56:00,058
See if the woman in the red coat shows up on camera.

780
00:56:00,528 --> 00:56:01,528
What?

781
00:56:01,698 --> 00:56:03,198
You'll make me work alone? Where are you going?

(Gong Da Hyun, handled Cha Eun Sae)

783
00:56:04,198 --> 00:56:05,698
You remember seeing bruises...

784
00:56:05,698 --> 00:56:07,167
and busted lips on Cha Eun Sae's face?

785
00:56:08,837 --> 00:56:10,977
Could you check the date?

786
00:56:12,607 --> 00:56:13,607
Thank you.

787
00:56:15,548 --> 00:56:18,278
Guys. Pastor Kang Man Duk was arrested.

788
00:56:18,517 --> 00:56:20,948
The fake pastor we covered on our show from months ago?

789
00:56:20,948 --> 00:56:22,517
Was he charged with sexual assault?

790
00:56:22,517 --> 00:56:24,317
No. He was charged as an accessory to murder.

791
00:56:24,618 --> 00:56:27,258
One of his believers died from a seizure in his presence.

792
00:56:27,428 --> 00:56:29,758
He didn't even call 911. He neglected his believer and left.

793
00:56:30,058 --> 00:56:32,928
Gosh. He's a total psychopath.

794
00:56:32,928 --> 00:56:35,468
His believer was dying, but he just left his believer there.

795
00:56:44,477 --> 00:56:46,238
Gosh, that cult leader.

796
00:56:46,238 --> 00:56:49,078
It was hard to legally punish him. Jung Won was furious about that.

797
00:56:49,078 --> 00:56:50,477
He'll go to prison at last.

798
00:56:52,278 --> 00:56:53,377
That serves him right, doesn't it?

799
00:56:58,317 --> 00:57:00,218
Jung Won. What's wrong?

800
00:57:00,687 --> 00:57:01,787
Are you unwell?

801
00:57:05,627 --> 00:57:07,627
I'm stepping out for an interview.

802
00:57:56,548 --> 00:57:59,477
No. Cha Eun Sae was already dead, for sure.

803
00:58:14,897 --> 00:58:16,098
I had no choice.

804
00:58:16,997 --> 00:58:19,868
Once the killer is caught, I'll tell them myself.

805
00:58:20,638 --> 00:58:21,707
I really will.

806
00:58:28,078 --> 00:58:29,348
I knew it.

807
00:58:29,977 --> 00:58:31,718
I totally knew you'd suffer like this all alone.

808
00:58:36,147 --> 00:58:38,158
Try to snap out of it, okay?

809
00:58:38,287 --> 00:58:39,618
I want to,

810
00:58:42,127 --> 00:58:43,587
but it's not as easy as I thought.

811
00:58:46,457 --> 00:58:49,098
You had a hallucination and saw blood on your hands?

812
00:58:49,997 --> 00:58:53,808
Could it be connected to how you witnessed the dead body a month ago?

813
00:58:56,308 --> 00:58:57,508
Yes, I think so.

814
00:59:00,647 --> 00:59:02,508
You must be under a lot of stress.

815
00:59:04,778 --> 00:59:07,687
I read the article about your husband.

816
00:59:10,017 --> 00:59:11,287
I'm really sorry.

817
00:59:14,457 --> 00:59:15,727
The day before she was found dead,

818
00:59:17,957 --> 00:59:19,558
Cha Eun Sae said to me...

819
00:59:21,897 --> 00:59:23,567
that she and my husband were in love.

820
00:59:25,497 --> 00:59:27,408
- I see. - That day,

821
00:59:28,707 --> 00:59:29,767
I wanted...

822
00:59:32,778 --> 00:59:34,178
to kill Cha Eun Sae.

823
00:59:35,848 --> 00:59:37,178
From her death...

824
00:59:37,917 --> 00:59:39,078
to how my husband betrayed me,

825
00:59:42,618 --> 00:59:43,888
it all feels like a nightmare.

826
00:59:45,087 --> 00:59:47,727
Because you loved and trusted your husband,

827
00:59:48,928 --> 00:59:50,658
this is too painful for you. It's only natural.

828
00:59:52,227 --> 00:59:53,328
Before I met my husband,

829
00:59:54,798 --> 00:59:56,227
I was always alone.

830
00:59:57,537 --> 00:59:58,667
He became my parent, sibling,

831
00:59:59,198 --> 01:00:02,107
and friend. No, more than that.

832
01:00:03,437 --> 01:00:04,778
That was how much I trusted him,

833
01:00:08,578 --> 01:00:10,377
and I thought he'd always be on my side.

834
01:00:11,877 --> 01:00:14,147
When you feel depressed or angry, try not to suppress it.

835
01:00:14,718 --> 01:00:18,118
It's healthier to express your feelings.

836
01:00:21,087 --> 01:00:23,287
He said he had never felt loved by me.

837
01:00:24,428 --> 01:00:25,497
He said he was lonely.

838
01:00:25,928 --> 01:00:27,698
He blamed it all on me.

839
01:00:28,627 --> 01:00:29,727
That jerk...

840
01:00:31,897 --> 01:00:32,997
I won't suppress it.

841
01:00:34,808 --> 01:00:37,207
The pain he gave me. This humiliation.

842
01:00:38,578 --> 01:00:40,078
I'll make sure he gets it all back.

843
01:01:17,548 --> 01:01:19,317
There are slight defense wounds on her arm.

844
01:01:19,477 --> 01:01:22,348
Cha Eun Sae once told me about her sponsor.

845
01:01:22,917 --> 01:01:23,917
Mo Hyung Taek?

846
01:01:23,917 --> 01:01:26,058
They've figured out the brand of the necklace Cha Eun Sae was holding.

847
01:01:26,187 --> 01:01:27,528
I only see women's necklaces.

848
01:01:27,658 --> 01:01:29,187
So they don't sell men's necklaces, right?

849
01:01:29,328 --> 01:01:30,928
That's what she said before she died.

850
01:01:31,158 --> 01:01:33,598
She said so many people were trying to kill her,

851
01:01:33,598 --> 01:01:35,428
and one of them was a murderer or something.

852
01:01:35,497 --> 01:01:37,368
Then it's highly likely that the culprit is a woman.

01:02:17,055 --> 01:02:18,095
Ms. Seo Jung Won.

855
01:02:18,595 --> 01:02:20,124
You'll need to come with me...

856
01:02:21,165 --> 01:02:22,365
to Gangha Police Station.

857
01:02:23,035 --> 01:02:24,104
Me? Why?

858
01:02:25,165 --> 01:02:26,205
Because of my husband?

859
01:02:26,205 --> 01:02:28,135
We must interview you.

860
01:02:50,794 --> 01:02:52,294
You brought me here, so talk.

861
01:02:56,334 --> 01:02:57,734
You've seen this necklace before, right?

862
01:03:00,805 --> 01:03:04,174
I found a picture of you doing an interview wearing this necklace.

863
01:03:08,975 --> 01:03:11,314
I do have the same necklace.

864
01:03:11,915 --> 01:03:13,814
Didn't you lose your necklace?

865
01:03:15,854 --> 01:03:17,115
How do you know that?

866
01:03:17,754 --> 01:03:19,285
Because this necklace is yours.

867
01:03:21,354 --> 01:03:23,854
- Sorry? - Your necklace...

868
01:03:24,595 --> 01:03:26,265

869
01:03:27,995 --> 01:03:29,064
of Cha Eun Sae's murder.

Ms. Seo Jung Won.

871
01:03:35,435 --> 01:03:37,004
The day Cha Eun Sae was found dead,

872
01:03:38,374 --> 01:03:39,944
were you...

873
01:03:41,044 --> 01:03:42,075
at the scene?
