- Oh, my. It's snowing. - My gosh.

00:00:16,435 --> 00:00:18,244
(December 24, 2009)

9
00:00:20,514 --> 00:00:23,415
We can have a date in Seoul on Christmas Eve next year.

10
00:00:24,145 --> 00:00:26,845
You can drive, so you have to take me out for a drive that day.

11
00:00:27,584 --> 00:00:28,784
We can go for a drive today too.

12
00:00:29,055 --> 00:00:30,313
I should've brought my dad's car.

13
00:00:30,314 --> 00:00:32,124
You just got your license.

14
00:00:32,955 --> 00:00:35,394
Today, I wanted to walk with you, holding your hand like this.

15
00:01:29,744 --> 00:01:32,013
The person you have reached is unavailable...

16
00:01:32,014 --> 00:01:34,254
Please leave a message after the tone.

Extra charges may apply.

18
00:01:37,354 --> 00:01:38,354
Na Ri.

19
00:01:38,654 --> 00:01:40,484
I brought my dad's car to drive you home.

20
00:01:40,895 --> 00:01:42,154
Call me when you get this message.

21
00:01:42,354 --> 00:01:43,525
I'll wait in front of the factory.

22
00:02:51,924 --> 00:02:53,065
Na Ri.

23
00:02:59,465 --> 00:03:02,174
Na Ri!

24
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:04,475
Na Ri!

25
00:03:08,845 --> 00:03:10,174
Na Ri...

26
00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:14,215
Na Ri, why are you here?

27
00:03:15,484 --> 00:03:17,484
Na Ri.

28
00:03:27,264 --> 00:03:30,665
Hello, my... My friend is hurt.

29
00:03:31,234 --> 00:03:32,604
She collapsed.

30
00:03:34,135 --> 00:03:35,304
I don't know.

31
00:03:37,074 --> 00:03:38,574
No, it was an accident.

32
00:03:41,044 --> 00:03:43,514
We're near the Bongto factory now.

33
00:04:04,234 --> 00:04:05,965
(Incoming Call, Father)

34
00:04:17,445 --> 00:04:19,844
I told you not to take my car without my permission.

35
00:04:20,755 --> 00:04:21,784
Where are you?

36
00:04:23,855 --> 00:04:26,255
I'm on my way to the hospital.

37
00:04:27,454 --> 00:04:28,495
The hospital?

38
00:04:28,555 --> 00:04:30,154
My friend is hurt.

39
00:04:32,524 --> 00:04:34,664
I don't think she's breathing.

40
00:04:36,195 --> 00:04:37,235
What?

41
00:04:37,865 --> 00:04:40,065
I hit her with the car, Father.

42
00:04:43,904 --> 00:04:45,105
Calm down.

43
00:04:45,404 --> 00:04:47,474
First, check if she's still alive or not.

44
00:04:52,414 --> 00:04:53,445
Now!

45
00:05:10,034 --> 00:05:11,735
She's... I think she's dead.

46
00:05:20,344 --> 00:05:21,445
Come home at once.

47
00:05:22,074 --> 00:05:23,874
Both our lives are at stake here.

48
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:25,014
Do as you're told!

49
00:06:30,945 --> 00:06:33,714
This song. Na Ri liked it too.

50
00:06:42,755 --> 00:06:43,795
It's the first time...

51
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:48,065
I've mentioned Na Ri since that night.

52
00:06:50,735 --> 00:06:53,264
I told Eun Sae about her, so it's the second time.

53
00:06:54,175 --> 00:06:56,574
Apparently I called Na Ri in my sleep.

54
00:06:59,974 --> 00:07:01,214
The day she died,

55
00:07:02,844 --> 00:07:04,784
Eun Sae called and told me.

56
00:07:14,084 --> 00:07:16,154
You obnoxious jerk. Listen up.

57
00:07:17,664 --> 00:07:19,464
I told Seo Jung Won everything yesterday.

58
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:21,194
All about our relationship.

59
00:07:21,195 --> 00:07:23,334
Even that I'm pregnant.

60
00:07:25,565 --> 00:07:26,565
No.

61
00:07:26,935 --> 00:07:29,704
What you said when you cried in your sleep a week ago.

62
00:07:30,034 --> 00:07:31,474
I didn't tell her about that.

63
00:07:35,014 --> 00:07:37,815
I don't know what I said in my sleep,

64
00:07:39,144 --> 00:07:40,185
but the problem was,

65
00:07:40,745 --> 00:07:42,385
Eun Sae realized that...

66
00:07:43,154 --> 00:07:44,185
I had...

67
00:07:45,084 --> 00:07:47,185
killed Lee Na Ri.

68
00:07:49,024 --> 00:07:52,393
I thought her death would bury it,

69
00:07:52,394 --> 00:07:54,065
but it's about to come out again.

70
00:07:54,295 --> 00:07:56,533
There's nothing wrong with your 911 call.

71
00:07:56,534 --> 00:07:59,963
Even if they figure out you made it, we can come up with an explanation.

72
00:07:59,964 --> 00:08:02,374
There's nothing more to look into. They can't look into it.

73
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:04,005
Kim Tae Heon and Mo Hyung Taek both.

74
00:08:04,644 --> 00:08:07,615
They can't do anything until her body's found.

75
00:08:08,045 --> 00:08:10,444
Even if your worst fear comes true, without a corpse...

76
00:08:10,445 --> 00:08:13,284
That it will end up as an ordinary missing person case?

77
00:08:14,914 --> 00:08:15,985
I know it will.

78
00:08:16,385 --> 00:08:18,685
You said that enough to make my ears bleed.

79
00:08:21,524 --> 00:08:23,254
I thought we'd sorted it out.

80
00:08:23,255 --> 00:08:25,865
Did you come here this late out of anxiety or something?

81
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:28,195
I told you clearly...

82
00:08:28,435 --> 00:08:30,195
that you couldn't mess up now.

83
00:08:30,735 --> 00:08:32,734
If you're worried, drop the Mujin resort project...

84
00:08:32,735 --> 00:08:34,304
and go abroad with Jung Won.

85
00:08:34,835 --> 00:08:36,005
I won't run away.

86
00:08:37,075 --> 00:08:39,505
Steeling my resolve on my own didn't seem good enough,

87
00:08:41,014 --> 00:08:42,745
so I came to run it by you.

88
00:08:46,284 --> 00:08:47,284
What I did.

89
00:08:49,215 --> 00:08:51,085
I'll hide it even more completely.

90
00:08:51,284 --> 00:08:52,924
Until the very end.

91
00:08:54,154 --> 00:08:56,293
I can't let my child be branded...

92
00:08:56,294 --> 00:08:58,264
as the child of a murderer.

93
00:08:58,625 --> 00:08:59,725
From now on,

94
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:03,135
I'll become more cowardly, more shameless,

95
00:09:03,764 --> 00:09:05,635
and more dreadful, Father.

96
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:09,575
If I sway under the pressure,

97
00:09:10,105 --> 00:09:11,774
help me stay on my feet.

98
00:09:34,764 --> 00:09:38,235
I heard you ended up in the ER the day after we drank here.

99
00:09:39,764 --> 00:09:41,075
Why didn't you tell me?

100
00:09:41,534 --> 00:09:44,943
You can't drink so much when you have liver cirrhosis.

101
00:09:44,944 --> 00:09:47,043
I didn't tell you because I knew you'd nag.

102
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:48,144
My goodness.

103
00:09:48,715 --> 00:09:51,345
You asked me to nag every now and then as a parent.

104
00:09:52,444 --> 00:09:54,314
I would've totally done something if I wasn't...

105
00:09:54,955 --> 00:09:56,684
so drunk that day. Eat that.

106
00:09:58,455 --> 00:09:59,725
The older you get,

107
00:10:01,654 --> 00:10:03,923
the harder it becomes to live sober.

108
00:10:03,924 --> 00:10:05,495
It takes even more effort.

109
00:10:09,034 --> 00:10:10,034
Do you know...

110
00:10:11,105 --> 00:10:13,835
what I respect and acknowledge you the most for?

111
00:10:14,404 --> 00:10:16,505
You never look like you're out of control.

112
00:10:19,345 --> 00:10:21,514
Your life isn't that easy either.

113
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:23,875
You're widowed and have...

114
00:10:25,144 --> 00:10:26,345
a sibling with a rare disease.

115
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:37,965
Unlucky people like me manage to go on.

116
00:10:38,595 --> 00:10:40,563
Your life is a hundred times better than mine,

117
00:10:40,564 --> 00:10:41,995
so why are you so messed up?

118
00:10:45,304 --> 00:10:46,335
I don't know.

119
00:10:46,664 --> 00:10:49,075
I think my life is just as messed up as yours.

120
00:10:55,715 --> 00:10:56,745
Tae Heon.

121
00:10:58,144 --> 00:10:59,245
Give up.

122
00:11:00,245 --> 00:11:03,355
For Reporter Seo and for your own sake too.

123
00:11:21,475 --> 00:11:23,774
When I found out that your father was Reporter Seo Sang Gyeon,

124
00:11:24,444 --> 00:11:25,605
I thought the universe brought me to you.

125
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:27,875
My sister...

126
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:31,485
and your father...

127
00:11:32,485 --> 00:11:34,284
were murdered by the same person.

128
00:11:46,725 --> 00:11:47,764
Dad.

129
00:11:49,495 --> 00:11:51,904
Who did you talk to outside Lee Na Ri's place?

130
00:11:54,705 --> 00:11:57,705
Did you die because of that call?

131
00:12:02,075 --> 00:12:04,615
I'm so frustrated, but I don't know how to find out.

132
00:12:06,044 --> 00:12:07,913
Can't you appear in a dream and tell me?

133
00:12:07,914 --> 00:12:10,085
(The late Seo Sang Gyeon)

134
00:12:19,564 --> 00:12:22,394
I'm becoming a mother.

135
00:12:23,764 --> 00:12:25,365
For my child and me,

136
00:12:27,404 --> 00:12:28,475
I must find out...

137
00:12:30,304 --> 00:12:31,375
whether or not...

138
00:12:32,174 --> 00:12:33,674
Woo Jae is a murderer.

139
00:12:46,154 --> 00:12:49,095
Why did Woo Jae come here that day?

140
00:12:56,635 --> 00:12:58,635
- Can I ask you something? - Sure.

141
00:13:00,534 --> 00:13:03,374
Did something happen here on January 10?

142
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:04,434
On the tenth?

143
00:13:07,245 --> 00:13:10,115
A concert was held to commemorate the Bongto Factory fire victims.

144
00:13:11,615 --> 00:13:13,144
It happens here every year.

145
00:13:14,144 --> 00:13:15,284
I see.

146
00:13:19,255 --> 00:13:20,855
- Thank you. - Sure.

147
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:25,664
- Hi, Ae Na. - Did you read about your pregnancy?

148
00:13:26,865 --> 00:13:29,595
Your in-laws released the news even though it's early.

149
00:13:29,694 --> 00:13:32,664
It looks like they're pressuring you to come back.

150
00:13:33,835 --> 00:13:34,875
What will you do?

151
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:37,135
Let's talk about it later.

152
00:13:42,014 --> 00:13:45,985
(Mujin Group Heir Seol and Wife Seo Are Expecting)

153
00:14:01,694 --> 00:14:02,694
Hi, Jung Won.

154
00:14:02,965 --> 00:14:04,865
Did you read the article about my pregnancy?

155
00:14:06,434 --> 00:14:07,505
It's in the news?

156
00:14:08,335 --> 00:14:11,105
No amount of articles will make me move back.

157
00:14:12,505 --> 00:14:14,475
I'm sorry. I dropped the ball.

158
00:14:15,814 --> 00:14:17,744
As soon as I'm back in Seoul,

159
00:14:17,745 --> 00:14:20,013
I'll tell PR to make sure it's never mentioned again.

160
00:14:20,014 --> 00:14:21,085
Where are you?

161
00:14:21,585 --> 00:14:22,614
I'm at Mueon.

162
00:14:22,615 --> 00:14:24,485
Why are you there again?

163
00:14:25,424 --> 00:14:26,424
Well...

164
00:14:26,985 --> 00:14:29,624
I'm at Mujin Development to discuss...

165
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:31,564
the new resort we'll build.

166
00:14:32,325 --> 00:14:33,495
My father will join me soon.

167
00:14:33,965 --> 00:14:37,034
Instead of talking to PR, get the message across to him.

168
00:14:47,505 --> 00:14:49,115
He had no offspring,

169
00:14:49,644 --> 00:14:51,384
so I wondered if I should...

170
00:14:51,385 --> 00:14:54,043
adopt the nephew who was born two years ago.

171
00:14:54,044 --> 00:14:55,985
You can relax now.

172
00:14:56,314 --> 00:14:58,053
Now your heir will have an heir,

173
00:14:58,054 --> 00:15:00,183
competitors are already worried...

174
00:15:00,184 --> 00:15:02,995
that our company will soon grow much larger.

175
00:15:03,455 --> 00:15:06,094
Look into expanding the high-end...

176
00:15:06,095 --> 00:15:08,734
residential complex you're planning.

177
00:15:08,735 --> 00:15:10,893
When my daughter-in-law's heavily pregnant,

178
00:15:10,894 --> 00:15:13,464
she would make the perfect model.

179
00:15:13,465 --> 00:15:16,134
Yes, sir. I'll work on something...

180
00:15:16,135 --> 00:15:18,903
to improve our image, as well as gain...

181
00:15:18,904 --> 00:15:20,574
more government funding and benefits.

182
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,715
Yes, good.

183
00:15:26,485 --> 00:15:27,885
I know that you got the reporters...

184
00:15:28,755 --> 00:15:30,813
to publish about Jung Won's pregnancy...

185
00:15:30,814 --> 00:15:33,054
as well as her suspected affair with Kim Tae Heon.

186
00:15:35,095 --> 00:15:36,154
Remember what I told you?

187
00:15:37,294 --> 00:15:39,694
All the heinous deeds you committed for my sake...

188
00:15:41,194 --> 00:15:42,434
I can understand them now.

189
00:15:43,135 --> 00:15:45,404
I know that the news articles about her pregnancy are...

190
00:15:46,205 --> 00:15:47,235
just the start.

191
00:15:47,264 --> 00:15:48,834
I also know that you could have pressured her more,

192
00:15:48,835 --> 00:15:50,534
but you're holding yourself back.

193
00:15:55,314 --> 00:15:56,314
Dad.

194
00:15:57,014 --> 00:15:58,184
I'll go all-in...

195
00:15:59,814 --> 00:16:00,885
with this project.

196
00:16:01,314 --> 00:16:03,154
I will bring results that surpass your expectations.

197
00:16:04,385 --> 00:16:07,225
So I ask that you don't bother Jung Won.

198
00:16:08,095 --> 00:16:09,594
To tell you the truth,

199
00:16:09,595 --> 00:16:11,495
I'd rather avoid doing something that she hates...

200
00:16:12,264 --> 00:16:14,365
instead of trying to do ten things that she likes.

201
00:16:16,194 --> 00:16:17,235
Please, Dad.

202
00:16:25,605 --> 00:16:26,944
Hey, Assemblyman Mo.

203
00:16:29,615 --> 00:16:30,615
Sure.

204
00:16:34,314 --> 00:16:36,154
You can have lunch with Mr. Bae.

205
00:16:36,414 --> 00:16:37,414
What about you?

206
00:16:38,684 --> 00:16:40,523
He's getting big-headed...

207
00:16:40,524 --> 00:16:42,325
because he listened to the 911 call.

208
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:43,725
I have no choice.

209
00:16:43,924 --> 00:16:45,125
I must put him in his place.

210
00:17:22,964 --> 00:17:25,265
Did you already have a lunch appointment?

211
00:17:26,065 --> 00:17:27,664
Did you have to cancel for me?

212
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:31,575
Just like you wanted,

213
00:17:32,845 --> 00:17:34,974
I'll increase it to Level Four for the building use.

214
00:17:35,615 --> 00:17:39,014
However, I will need to take the 49-percent profit...

215
00:17:39,015 --> 00:17:40,285
of the total investment profits.

216
00:17:41,045 --> 00:17:42,314
If this goes south,

217
00:17:42,315 --> 00:17:44,385
I might get charged with malpractice.

218
00:17:45,454 --> 00:17:48,025
I ought to be rewarded for the big risk I'm taking.

219
00:17:52,065 --> 00:17:55,694
I doubt that you're in any position to be stubborn about this.

220
00:17:56,335 --> 00:17:59,035
Remember the 2009 Christmas Eve.

221
00:17:59,065 --> 00:18:00,865
Are you talking about the 911 call my son made?

222
00:18:03,775 --> 00:18:06,805
I saw your car in the garage that day.

223
00:18:07,174 --> 00:18:10,474
The front headlight was completely shattered. You know?

224
00:18:11,585 --> 00:18:13,444
Who caused the accident?

225
00:18:13,714 --> 00:18:15,184
Was it you or your son?

226
00:18:18,724 --> 00:18:21,385
Do you remember my driver who used to work for me? Mr. Hong?

227
00:18:22,055 --> 00:18:24,964
I see. So the driver caused the accident?

228
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:27,094
After picking up my son, he was driving my son back.

229
00:18:27,095 --> 00:18:28,464
Then he hit my son's friend.

230
00:18:28,734 --> 00:18:29,765
Who?

231
00:18:30,194 --> 00:18:31,463
Why do you want to know?

232
00:18:31,464 --> 00:18:34,335
I get the feeling his friend might be someone I know.

233
00:18:34,605 --> 00:18:36,974
I ought to pay Mr. Hong a visit.

234
00:18:39,644 --> 00:18:41,875
He died of an illness three years ago...

235
00:18:42,474 --> 00:18:43,674
unfortunately.

236
00:18:46,684 --> 00:18:49,413
My son called 911 to report the accident.

237
00:18:49,414 --> 00:18:52,454
The car was damaged. So I understand your suspicion.

238
00:18:53,285 --> 00:18:56,194
People like us have a hard time trusting others. You know?

239
00:18:57,525 --> 00:18:58,664
You're right.

240
00:19:00,565 --> 00:19:02,865
All right. I'll take a closer look...

241
00:19:03,095 --> 00:19:05,334
to see if you're telling the truth or not.

242
00:19:05,335 --> 00:19:06,434
Go ahead.

243
00:19:08,305 --> 00:19:09,904
Because I took a closer look at you.

244
00:19:12,204 --> 00:19:15,714
You know, the scars on your solar plexus?

245
00:19:16,244 --> 00:19:18,785
You were treated for the scars three weeks ago...

246
00:19:19,045 --> 00:19:20,214
by Dr. Han.

247
00:19:21,954 --> 00:19:23,253
Your daughter is claiming that...

248
00:19:23,254 --> 00:19:25,885
you're faking the whole thing.

249
00:19:26,555 --> 00:19:27,625
I'm thinking about...

250
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,924
paying her a visit in your place.

251
00:19:32,525 --> 00:19:33,694
Can I?

252
00:19:45,105 --> 00:19:46,345
Thanks for the meal.

253
00:19:50,545 --> 00:19:52,914
It doesn't matter what Soo Rin says.

254
00:19:53,444 --> 00:19:56,414
It's nothing compared to the evidence I have.

255
00:20:04,254 --> 00:20:06,724
All those years ago, there was blood...

256
00:20:07,724 --> 00:20:10,535
on the broken headlight of your car.

257
00:20:11,265 --> 00:20:14,805
So I took a piece of the bloodstained headlight.

258
00:20:16,934 --> 00:20:20,444
I don't care about the identity of Woo Jae's friend in the accident.

259
00:20:21,444 --> 00:20:25,115
But I will try to find the friend and compare the blood samples.

260
00:20:27,545 --> 00:20:29,285
I should thank you for the meal.

261
00:21:07,517 --> 00:21:09,987
My friend is hurt.

262
00:21:12,156 --> 00:21:13,227
We're near...

263
00:21:13,457 --> 00:21:15,596
Bongto Factory.

264
00:21:17,457 --> 00:21:20,467
If Lee Na Ri was the friend who got hurt around Bongto Factory,

265
00:21:21,626 --> 00:21:24,636
Seol Woo Jae could have reported it since he was her boyfriend then.

266
00:21:25,967 --> 00:21:27,336
Tae Heon.

267
00:21:28,106 --> 00:21:29,106
Was Seol Woo Jae the account holder...

268
00:21:29,107 --> 00:21:30,306
who made the 911 call in 2009 under that number?

269
00:21:30,507 --> 00:21:32,247
Gosh. Seriously.

270
00:21:32,846 --> 00:21:34,947
It's like you're psychic or something when you do that.

271
00:21:36,646 --> 00:21:40,046
In the 911 call, he said his friend was hurt.

272
00:21:40,146 --> 00:21:41,957
- That friend... - It could be Lee Na Ri.

273
00:21:42,187 --> 00:21:45,325
If so, it means Seol Woo Jae knew that Lee escaped from the factory...

274
00:21:45,326 --> 00:21:47,727
and Lee was caught in a fire incident at the factory.

275
00:21:48,287 --> 00:21:49,727
If your line of reasoning is correct,

276
00:21:49,957 --> 00:21:51,795
when Lee's funeral was held with someone else's dead body,

277
00:21:51,796 --> 00:21:54,027
Seol Woo Jae intentionally kept his silence.

278
00:21:54,167 --> 00:21:55,167
Why?

279
00:21:55,737 --> 00:21:57,497
Why did he cover it up and keep it a secret?

280
00:21:57,997 --> 00:22:00,237
She wasn't just a friend. She was his girlfriend.

281
00:22:02,106 --> 00:22:03,677
What if he was the one who caused the accident?

282
00:22:04,876 --> 00:22:05,947
Covering it up makes sense.

283
00:22:07,106 --> 00:22:08,576
So Seol Woo Jae is a murderer?

284
00:22:09,346 --> 00:22:11,747
So he knows where her body is too. Is that what you're saying?

285
00:22:12,046 --> 00:22:13,686
If my hunch is right, and this is a murder case,

286
00:22:13,687 --> 00:22:14,916
the corpse will play the most important role.

287
00:22:14,917 --> 00:22:16,856
We must find Lee's body no matter what.

288
00:22:17,917 --> 00:22:19,555
If he hid the fact that he murdered Lee...

289
00:22:19,556 --> 00:22:21,757
and married Seo Jung Won...

290
00:24:39,167 --> 00:24:41,466
(January 10)

291

(Concert to Commemorate the Bongto Factory Fire Victims)

292
00:24:48,576 --> 00:24:50,335
(No one has taken responsibility for what happened.)

293
00:24:50,336 --> 00:24:52,876

294

(Memories, Promises, and Missing You)

295
00:25:18,366 --> 00:25:19,467
That guy.

296
00:25:22,437 --> 00:25:25,646
What is Jung Won's husband doing here?

297
00:27:00,707 --> 00:27:01,737
No way.

298
00:27:03,507 --> 00:27:04,576
That can't be.

299
00:27:13,947 --> 00:27:16,356
Jung Won, did you know?

300
00:27:17,917 --> 00:27:21,556
Banana milk was my sister's favorite.

301
00:27:22,826 --> 00:27:25,056
I'm sure your husband knew about it too.

302
00:27:26,227 --> 00:27:27,896
He was Na Ri's first love.

303
00:27:37,177 --> 00:27:38,677
I confess.

304
00:27:39,947 --> 00:27:41,646
You reminded me of my sister.

305
00:27:42,876 --> 00:27:44,717
Get in the car in one minute, or you're not getting the snack!

306
00:27:45,277 --> 00:27:47,646
I felt comforted every time you took care of me,

307
00:27:48,086 --> 00:27:49,386
and I felt like I could rely on you,

308
00:27:50,257 --> 00:27:53,527
as if my late sister came back from the dead.

309
00:27:53,787 --> 00:27:54,886
Hey, that's cute.

310
00:28:06,306 --> 00:28:07,366
Jung Won.

311
00:28:08,606 --> 00:28:11,636
If my hunch is right, and my sister really is buried here...

312
00:28:13,177 --> 00:28:16,017
And if it was your husband who killed her and buried her,

313
00:28:18,346 --> 00:28:19,487
I will...

314
00:28:22,257 --> 00:28:23,886
avenge her death in the same manner.

315
00:28:25,257 --> 00:28:26,487
I'm sorry, Jung Won.

316
00:28:27,027 --> 00:28:29,197
I'm really sorry.

317
00:28:55,046 --> 00:28:56,056
Na Ri.

318
00:28:59,126 --> 00:29:00,126
Na Ri.

319
00:29:02,156 --> 00:29:03,757
What is this?

320
00:29:04,997 --> 00:29:07,066
What is this?

321
00:29:08,396 --> 00:29:09,836
Na Ri!

322
00:29:12,566 --> 00:29:14,707
Na Ri, I'm sorry.

323
00:30:07,727 --> 00:30:09,056
You heard that just now, right?

324
00:30:11,527 --> 00:30:12,796
What is happening here?

325
00:30:22,037 --> 00:30:23,037
Yes, Detective Bong.

326
00:30:24,636 --> 00:30:25,707
What?

327
00:30:26,707 --> 00:30:27,906
I'll leave now.

328
00:30:58,437 --> 00:30:59,477
I love you.

329
00:31:00,876 --> 00:31:02,977
You're going to end it with him one day.

330
00:31:04,116 --> 00:31:06,146
Our feelings for each other still remain.

331
00:31:10,717 --> 00:31:12,487
I can wait for a long time.

332
00:31:14,626 --> 00:31:16,027
I want to wait.

333
00:31:17,957 --> 00:31:18,997
Can't I?

334
00:31:28,037 --> 00:31:29,836
I told him not to contact me again.

335
00:31:31,876 --> 00:31:34,677
Why am I waiting for his call, like an idiot?

336
00:32:07,677 --> 00:32:09,417
Do you know this guy?

337
00:32:17,287 --> 00:32:18,957
- He was strangled. - Yes.

338
00:32:32,806 --> 00:32:35,136
The unidentified human remains buried here.

339
00:32:35,366 --> 00:32:36,477
It must be Lee Na Ri, right?

340
00:32:39,277 --> 00:32:40,346
Yes, I think so.

341
00:32:40,806 --> 00:32:42,815
Because Lee Ba Reun was found right next to them.

342
00:32:42,816 --> 00:32:45,277
The skin on Lee Ba Reun's palms has all peeled off.

343
00:32:45,747 --> 00:32:46,917
He dug this all up.

344
00:32:55,856 --> 00:32:57,457
If he dug this whole area,

345
00:32:58,497 --> 00:33:00,796
it means he was sure Lee Na Ri was buried here.

346
00:33:00,896 --> 00:33:01,967
That's odd.

347
00:33:02,396 --> 00:33:04,466
How did he know that she was buried here?

348
00:33:04,467 --> 00:33:05,537
That I don't know.

349
00:33:06,306 --> 00:33:09,207
But he died because he knew Lee Na Ri was buried here.

350
00:33:09,537 --> 00:33:12,446
The person who buried Lee Na Ri probably killed him too.

351
00:33:12,977 --> 00:33:14,047
That makes sense.

352
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:17,816
What time did the witness find him?

353
00:33:17,817 --> 00:33:21,417
Well, around 7pm. They said they heard someone running.

354
00:33:21,986 --> 00:33:24,517
This isn't a hiking trail.

355
00:33:24,917 --> 00:33:27,756
I'm 99 percent sure it was the person who killed Lee.

356
00:33:28,756 --> 00:33:31,256
The culprit was in a rush to flee, so they left him here?

357
00:33:33,997 --> 00:33:36,537
So the culprit was here...

358
00:33:36,997 --> 00:33:38,696
until the witness arrived.

359
00:34:09,667 --> 00:34:11,596
- Did something happen here? - What are you doing in Mueon?

360
00:34:11,937 --> 00:34:13,406
That's what I want to ask you.

361
00:34:14,167 --> 00:34:15,437
What happened?

362
00:34:16,176 --> 00:34:18,005
- What is going on? - Well, it's...

363
00:34:18,006 --> 00:34:19,037
Detective Bong.

364
00:34:24,776 --> 00:34:25,787
What is it?

365
00:34:26,817 --> 00:34:28,017
Why won't you tell me?

366
00:34:32,727 --> 00:34:34,127
You're scaring me.

367
00:34:36,096 --> 00:34:38,127
Is it something I can't know?

368
00:34:49,707 --> 00:34:50,707
Wait.

369
00:34:53,846 --> 00:34:56,377
Listen carefully to what I say.

370
00:34:59,787 --> 00:35:00,986
Lee Ba Reun...

371
00:35:04,156 --> 00:35:05,256
is dead.

372
00:35:07,656 --> 00:35:09,127
He was found on Mount Mueon,

373
00:35:10,627 --> 00:35:12,156
and his body was taken away.

374
00:35:20,006 --> 00:35:21,267
Was it suicide?

375
00:35:29,547 --> 00:35:32,787
I don't think you should see the body.

376
00:35:34,951 --> 00:35:37,351
(911 Rescue Team)

377
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,161
Don't, Jung Won.

378
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:07,221
No.

379
00:36:09,851 --> 00:36:11,090
This isn't right.

380
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:14,090
Ba Reun.

381
00:36:15,761 --> 00:36:16,831
Ba Reun.

382
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:19,161
Wake up.

383
00:36:21,801 --> 00:36:22,801
Ba Reun.

384
00:36:26,471 --> 00:36:28,940
No. It was a gift.

385
00:36:29,641 --> 00:36:31,940
Get in in the next minute or you don't get to eat.

386
00:36:37,851 --> 00:36:39,281
I'll be in touch again, Jung Won.

387
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:41,321
Let's have a drink...

388
00:36:44,351 --> 00:36:46,161
next time just like old times.

389
00:36:49,931 --> 00:36:51,491
You said you'd be in touch.

390
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:53,860
We were going to meet up.

391
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:56,500
If you end up like this too...

392
00:36:57,270 --> 00:36:58,301
No.

393
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:00,371
Wake up.

394
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:01,670
Ba Reun.

395
00:37:02,641 --> 00:37:03,670
Ba Reun!

396
00:37:04,911 --> 00:37:06,040
Ba Reun!

397
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,141
Ba Reun!

398
00:37:09,911 --> 00:37:11,150
Open your eyes.

399
00:37:11,511 --> 00:37:12,951
Oh, no.

400
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,681
Ba Reun.

401
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:16,590
Ba Reun!

402
00:37:25,531 --> 00:37:27,960
Ba Reun! No!

403
00:37:28,601 --> 00:37:30,630
Please wake up.

404
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:33,371
Come on!

405
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:36,210
Let's go.

406
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,170
No.

407
00:37:38,411 --> 00:37:39,681
No!

408
00:37:43,181 --> 00:37:44,250
Ba Reun.

409
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:49,390
(Mount Mueon National Park)

410
00:37:49,391 --> 00:37:51,790
What? Lee Ba Reun was murdered?

411
00:37:52,491 --> 00:37:54,991
Is that why you asked me to track Seol Woo Jae in real time?

412
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:56,230
Do you have anything?

413
00:37:56,590 --> 00:37:58,161
He's in Mueon.

414
00:38:05,031 --> 00:38:06,571
Locate his car now.

415
00:38:06,770 --> 00:38:07,770
Hang on.

416
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:12,340
His car's in Mueon too.

417
00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:13,680
Where in Mueon?

418
00:38:13,681 --> 00:38:14,879
(Mueon Royal Hotel)

419
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,110
Mueon Royal Hotel.

420
00:38:18,511 --> 00:38:22,419
Seheung City got high marks in the municipal evaluation,

421
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:24,790
and received an award and prize money from the minister.

422
00:38:25,621 --> 00:38:26,790
The next report...

423
00:38:26,991 --> 00:38:28,990
comes from Mount Mueon in Gangwon Province.

424
00:38:28,991 --> 00:38:30,859
Female skeletal remains...

425
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:33,900
and a male's body were found side by side.

426
00:38:34,431 --> 00:38:36,300
Police are considering murder...

427
00:38:36,301 --> 00:38:38,630
- Female skeletal remains? - and are investigating further.

428
00:38:43,210 --> 00:38:46,540
Female skeletal remains were found on Mount Mueon too?

429
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:51,351
It looks like Lee Na Ri.

430
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:53,980
We don't have an ID yet.

431
00:38:56,051 --> 00:38:57,490
The witness said...

432
00:38:57,491 --> 00:38:59,991
they heard footsteps of someone running away.

433
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:03,261
I think the killer watched Lee Ba Reun dig up the body,

434
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:05,531
and when he found it, killed him, then got away.

435
00:39:07,701 --> 00:39:08,931
The truth...

436
00:39:09,971 --> 00:39:11,801
he wanted so much was right before him.

437
00:39:16,971 --> 00:39:18,770
Hello. Do you have an ID?

438
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:22,141
Okay.

439
00:39:26,221 --> 00:39:27,581
The skeleton is Lee Na Ri.

440
00:39:29,851 --> 00:39:30,891
I should go.

441
00:39:41,865 --> 00:39:44,475
Jung Won. What's going on?

442
00:39:47,006 --> 00:39:48,204
What are you doing in Mueon?

443
00:39:48,205 --> 00:39:50,245
Skeletal remains and a murdered man...

444
00:39:50,376 --> 00:39:51,946
were found on Mount Mueon.

445
00:39:52,575 --> 00:39:54,285
Did you see the news?

446
00:39:55,745 --> 00:39:57,885
- No. - The dead man is Lee Ba Reun.

447
00:39:58,285 --> 00:40:00,586
The skeleton. It's Lee Na Ri.

448
00:40:01,486 --> 00:40:02,626
They were siblings.

449
00:40:03,896 --> 00:40:04,896
What?

450
00:40:04,955 --> 00:40:06,466
Ba Reun, the youngest guy on my team...

451
00:40:07,396 --> 00:40:08,495
was murdered.

452
00:40:10,336 --> 00:40:13,006
You checked into the hotel at 6pm.

453
00:40:13,135 --> 00:40:14,405
Were you here all along?

454
00:40:15,265 --> 00:40:16,336
Did you go out?

455
00:40:17,776 --> 00:40:19,235
- What's this about? - Tell me.

456
00:40:19,236 --> 00:40:20,405
Did you go out?

457
00:40:23,646 --> 00:40:26,245
Do you think I'm the killer?

458
00:40:26,515 --> 00:40:29,316
Can I ask the hotel to show me the CCTV footage?

459
00:40:42,626 --> 00:40:44,736
Can you find and show me footage...

460
00:40:45,066 --> 00:40:46,365
from this elevator?

461
00:40:46,606 --> 00:40:49,776
I can do that since he gave permission,

462
00:40:49,905 --> 00:40:51,905
but your husband actually went to the bar...

463
00:40:52,035 --> 00:40:53,344
in the hotel lounge,

464
00:40:53,345 --> 00:40:55,875
then took the elevator back up to his room 30 minutes later.

465
00:40:55,876 --> 00:40:57,716
We checked that a while ago already.

466
00:40:59,785 --> 00:41:02,185
A detective came by and asked me to see it.

467
00:41:02,785 --> 00:41:04,184
The detective confirmed...

468
00:41:04,185 --> 00:41:06,825
he didn't leave the room after returning from the bar.

469
00:41:07,626 --> 00:41:10,196
So since he came back from the lounge bar,

470
00:41:10,595 --> 00:41:11,896
he didn't go out again?

471
00:41:12,865 --> 00:41:13,865
That's right.

472
00:41:25,935 --> 00:41:26,974
(January 11, I met with Jung Won.)

473
00:41:26,975 --> 00:41:28,106
(Jan 8, A Korean friend emailed me. Jan 3, It's snowing.)

474
00:41:31,975 --> 00:41:33,086
What could this be?

475
00:41:33,586 --> 00:41:34,645
Around this time every year,

476
00:41:34,646 --> 00:41:36,586
there's a concert to commemorate the factory victims.

477
00:41:36,716 --> 00:41:38,385
This was handed out to the public.

478
00:41:38,685 --> 00:41:39,955
When was this year's concert?

479
00:41:40,674 --> 00:41:41,943
(January 10, Bongto Factory Concert)

480
00:41:41,944 --> 00:41:43,014
January 10.

481
00:41:43,583 --> 00:41:46,514
That means Lee Ba Reun was at the concert on January 10.

482
00:41:52,993 --> 00:41:53,993
Woo Jae.

483
00:41:54,924 --> 00:41:57,264
I'm going to ask you something.

484
00:41:57,464 --> 00:41:58,993
I want you to promise me...

485
00:41:59,933 --> 00:42:01,034
you won't lie.

486
00:42:02,663 --> 00:42:04,264
Promise me.

487
00:42:08,603 --> 00:42:10,873
- Okay. - Before Yoo Yoon Young died,

488
00:42:11,904 --> 00:42:14,114
do you know what she whispered to me?

489
00:42:16,413 --> 00:42:17,913
She said Cha Eun Sae's killer...

490
00:42:18,944 --> 00:42:20,114
wasn't Mo Soo Rin.

491
00:42:21,554 --> 00:42:24,153
- She said it was you. - What?

492
00:42:24,154 --> 00:42:26,424
Why do you think she said that?

493
00:42:44,543 --> 00:42:45,904
The man in this video.

494
00:42:47,913 --> 00:42:48,944
Is it you?

495
00:42:53,583 --> 00:42:54,583
Is it you?

496
00:42:56,623 --> 00:42:57,623
No.

497
00:42:58,554 --> 00:42:59,554
It's not.

498
00:43:04,663 --> 00:43:05,694
You know.

499
00:43:07,094 --> 00:43:08,163
This man.

500
00:43:10,163 --> 00:43:12,364
I saw him when my dad died.

501
00:43:14,004 --> 00:43:15,373
My dad's killer...

502
00:43:15,574 --> 00:43:18,743
had a knife with the same swirling pattern.

503
00:43:19,273 --> 00:43:20,412
What you're saying is...

504
00:43:20,413 --> 00:43:21,844
The man in this video...

505
00:43:22,773 --> 00:43:24,284
also killed my dad.

506
00:43:25,413 --> 00:43:26,413
I'm certain of it.

507
00:43:27,853 --> 00:43:30,924
I suspected you, thinking that this man might be you.

508
00:43:32,284 --> 00:43:35,194
My father passed away on January 10, 2010,

509
00:43:35,324 --> 00:43:37,793
and you were in a hospital in Seoul to get treated that day.

510
00:43:42,464 --> 00:43:44,364
I couldn't stop harming myself around that time.

511
00:43:45,933 --> 00:43:47,203
So I was in a psychiatric hospital.

512
00:43:48,004 --> 00:43:50,743
They put me in there for treatments, but I was basically locked up.

513
00:43:51,174 --> 00:43:52,304
I can verify that for you.

516
00:44:08,526 --> 00:44:10,526
Hello, sir. It's me.

517
00:44:11,455 --> 00:44:14,365
- You've been well. Right? - Hey, Woo Jae.

518
00:44:14,526 --> 00:44:15,595
Why are you calling me at this hour?

519
00:44:15,666 --> 00:44:18,465
Well, I know that it was a long time ago.

520
00:44:18,466 --> 00:44:19,865
But I need to check something with you.

521
00:44:20,606 --> 00:44:24,035
You know, I was admitted into the hospital for two weeks...

522
00:44:24,205 --> 00:44:25,876
in early January of 2010.

523
00:44:26,276 --> 00:44:29,446
I was in a closed ward, so I couldn't come out. Right?

524
00:44:29,916 --> 00:44:33,285
Back then, your father was very adamant about your treatment.

525
00:44:33,486 --> 00:44:35,285
It's all in the past. Why are you asking me that now?

526
00:44:36,385 --> 00:44:37,856
I just needed to clarify it.

527
00:44:38,316 --> 00:44:40,954
Thank you. I'll call you again some other time.

528
00:44:40,955 --> 00:44:42,026
Sure.

00:44:43,095 --> 00:44:44,095
Jung Won.

530
00:44:45,555 --> 00:44:46,696
It really wasn't me.

531
00:44:47,825 --> 00:44:50,236
I can swear on it with everything I have as our child's father.

532
00:45:01,845 --> 00:45:02,876
Jung Won.

533
00:45:07,146 --> 00:45:08,285
I would like to go...

534
00:45:10,356 --> 00:45:11,955
to the scene tomorrow with you.

535
00:45:14,986 --> 00:45:15,986
I hoped...

536
00:45:17,325 --> 00:45:18,356
more desperately...

537
00:45:19,825 --> 00:45:21,296
than anyone that you weren't the culprit.

538
00:45:22,796 --> 00:45:23,966
You know why. Don't you?

539
00:45:26,506 --> 00:45:29,905
If you killed my father,

540
00:45:31,405 --> 00:45:32,535
that would be...

541
00:45:34,446 --> 00:45:36,816
the biggest tragedy my child would have to face...

542
00:45:38,745 --> 00:45:39,916
and that would be...

543
00:45:40,646 --> 00:45:42,245
the worst place all of us could ever...

544
00:45:43,756 --> 00:45:45,055
imagine being in.

00:45:53,696 --> 00:45:54,696
truly relieved...

547
00:45:57,196 --> 00:45:58,396
that it wasn't you.

548
00:46:00,506 --> 00:46:01,535
I'll see you tomorrow.

549
00:47:09,336 --> 00:47:10,436
Why are you guys coming together?

550
00:47:11,305 --> 00:47:13,106
I would like to accompany her to the scene.

551
00:47:18,115 --> 00:47:19,175
Sit in the passenger seat then.

552
00:47:36,126 --> 00:47:38,666
What are some belongings of Ba Reun you found at the scene?

553
00:47:39,196 --> 00:47:40,565
We couldn't find his main phone.

554
00:47:40,566 --> 00:47:43,305
We found a burner phone, a notepad, and a wallet in his backpack...

555
00:47:43,936 --> 00:47:45,335
along with a white pinwheel.

556
00:47:45,336 --> 00:47:47,046
A white pinwheel?

557
00:47:48,245 --> 00:47:49,645
On January 10, there was a memorial event...

558
00:47:49,646 --> 00:47:50,875
for the fire incident at the factory.

559
00:47:50,876 --> 00:47:52,276
People received the pinwheels at the event.

560
00:47:53,046 --> 00:47:56,046
Woo Jae. Weren't you at the event too?

561
00:47:58,115 --> 00:47:59,155
Yes.

562
00:48:04,856 --> 00:48:06,566
You must have attended the event for Lee Na Ri.

563
00:48:06,825 --> 00:48:07,895
Yes.

564
00:48:07,896 --> 00:48:09,225
Did you meet with Lee Ba Reun that day?

565
00:48:09,936 --> 00:48:11,165
No. I didn't see him there.

566
00:48:11,166 --> 00:48:12,565
Did you attend the event every year?

567
00:48:12,566 --> 00:48:13,635
No.

568
00:48:13,736 --> 00:48:15,405
But why did you attend it this year?

569
00:48:16,936 --> 00:48:19,075
The real arsonist was arrested.

570
00:48:19,535 --> 00:48:21,575
I wanted to pay my respect properly this time.

571
00:48:38,626 --> 00:48:44,365
(Mueon Recreational Forest)

572
00:49:15,026 --> 00:49:16,765
- Excuse us. - Hello.

573
00:49:17,236 --> 00:49:18,265
I'm from the police.

574
00:49:18,396 --> 00:49:20,204
The security camera is installed in the front.

575
00:49:20,205 --> 00:49:22,065
I would like to take the footage files for January.

576
00:49:22,066 --> 00:49:23,935
I see. Well,

577
00:49:23,936 --> 00:49:25,735
the security system collapsed earlier this morning.

578
00:49:25,736 --> 00:49:27,744
So we lost all of our data.

579
00:49:27,745 --> 00:49:29,006
I only have the data from this morning.

580
00:49:29,606 --> 00:49:31,145
It collapsed earlier this morning?

581
00:49:31,146 --> 00:49:32,475
Does this happen often?

582
00:49:32,575 --> 00:49:34,146
No, not really.

583
00:49:38,155 --> 00:49:39,155
Okay.

584
00:50:19,696 --> 00:50:22,566
Lee Na Ri's skeleton was found here.

585
00:50:23,936 --> 00:50:27,566
We believe that Lee Ba Reun dug these two pits.

586
00:50:37,845 --> 00:50:39,015
I've been thinking about this.

587
00:50:39,876 --> 00:50:42,985
I was the one who told him that his sister escaped from the factory.

588
00:50:42,986 --> 00:50:45,285
But he managed to find where his sister was buried.

589
00:50:46,385 --> 00:50:47,555
That doesn't add up.

590
00:50:48,186 --> 00:50:50,295
Excluding his burner phone,

591
00:50:50,296 --> 00:50:52,925
was he in contact with anyone via call or text?

592
00:50:53,796 --> 00:50:55,265
You were the last person to talk to him.

593
00:50:56,066 --> 00:50:58,236
I didn't find any relevant leads on his notepad either.

594
00:51:05,006 --> 00:51:07,975
Did you meet with Lee Na Ri on December 24, 2009?

595
00:51:11,115 --> 00:51:12,146
Mr. Seol.

596
00:51:15,146 --> 00:51:18,086
- Yes? - On December 24, 2009,

597
00:51:19,055 --> 00:51:20,486
did you meet with Lee Na Ri?

598
00:51:20,856 --> 00:51:23,256
You might have met her since it was Christmas Eve.

599
00:51:24,896 --> 00:51:25,995
You were her boyfriend.

600
00:51:27,296 --> 00:51:28,365
We did.

601
00:51:29,566 --> 00:51:30,666
When did you guys part ways that day?

602
00:51:34,205 --> 00:51:36,804
Na Ri had to go to the factory for her part-time job.

603
00:51:36,805 --> 00:51:38,805
I walked her to the factory in the evening and said goodbye.

604
00:51:39,805 --> 00:51:40,946
Was that the last time you saw her?

605
00:51:44,776 --> 00:51:47,316
After saying goodbye to Lee Na Ri...

606
00:52:00,026 --> 00:52:01,066
Never mind.

607
00:52:04,635 --> 00:52:05,696
Let's go.

608
00:52:24,716 --> 00:52:25,716
Jung Won.

609
00:52:26,716 --> 00:52:27,955
- Are you okay? - Yes.

610
00:52:29,026 --> 00:52:30,055
Be careful.

611
00:52:32,756 --> 00:52:33,966
This isn't good. Get on my back.

612
00:52:36,696 --> 00:52:37,696
I'm okay.

613
00:52:41,566 --> 00:52:43,634
What if you trip over by mistake?

614
00:52:43,635 --> 00:52:44,876
You're pregnant.

615
00:52:50,376 --> 00:52:51,546
Let me help you walk down then.

616
00:53:18,975 --> 00:53:20,245
Do you feel nauseous?

617
00:53:20,376 --> 00:53:21,745
I need to use the restroom.

618
00:53:21,845 --> 00:53:22,845
The restroom?

619
00:53:23,876 --> 00:53:24,876
It's over there.

620
00:53:34,955 --> 00:53:36,486
Will you go back to Seoul with her?

621
00:53:38,126 --> 00:53:39,126
Yes, why?

622
00:53:39,825 --> 00:53:41,066
Then I should ask you this now.

623
00:53:46,095 --> 00:53:48,506
Hello, my... My friend is hurt.

624
00:53:49,905 --> 00:53:50,975
No, it was an accident.

625
00:53:51,436 --> 00:53:52,506
We're...

626
00:53:52,606 --> 00:53:54,675
near the Bongto factory now.

627
00:53:54,845 --> 00:53:56,175
This is your voice, right?

628
00:53:56,876 --> 00:53:57,916
Yes.

629
00:54:00,175 --> 00:54:01,745
So, your friend who was hurt.

630
00:54:02,515 --> 00:54:03,716
- Was it Lee Na Ri? - Lee Na Ri?

631
00:54:04,486 --> 00:54:05,515
No.

632
00:54:06,356 --> 00:54:09,485
Mr. Hong, our driver at the time, was driving,

633
00:54:09,486 --> 00:54:11,555
and I was sitting in the passenger seat.

634
00:54:12,696 --> 00:54:14,626
We hit Min Chul, so I called it in.

635
00:54:14,966 --> 00:54:16,724
- Kim Min Chul? - He wasn't seriously injured,

636
00:54:16,725 --> 00:54:20,134
so we settled and got it sorted out amongst ourselves.

637
00:54:20,135 --> 00:54:21,435
Go ahead and ask Min Chul directly.

638
00:54:21,436 --> 00:54:24,305
I don't need to ask him anything to know he'll say the same thing.

639
00:54:24,506 --> 00:54:26,635
Mr. Hong too.

640
00:54:28,175 --> 00:54:29,804
You knew I got my hands...

641
00:54:29,805 --> 00:54:31,446
on the recording of your voice from that time.

642
00:54:31,745 --> 00:54:33,815
So you arranged everything in advance.

643
00:54:33,816 --> 00:54:35,745
You jumped to conclusions...

644
00:54:35,845 --> 00:54:37,316
because of that recording.

645
00:54:37,756 --> 00:54:39,716
You just assumed that I probably killed Lee Na Ri...

646
00:54:39,986 --> 00:54:41,256
and Lee Ba Reun as well.

647
00:54:43,126 --> 00:54:44,955
Even with the Cha Eun Sae case,

648
00:54:45,796 --> 00:54:47,365
you falsely accused me.

649
00:54:47,865 --> 00:54:49,896
You keep making the same mistake over and over again.

650
00:54:51,535 --> 00:54:53,595
I think you're making a mistake here.

651
00:54:56,066 --> 00:54:58,936
I tracked down every single place Lee Ba Reun visited recently.

652
00:55:00,135 --> 00:55:01,805
I believe...

653
00:55:02,606 --> 00:55:04,415
he followed someone...

654
00:55:04,416 --> 00:55:07,816
after attending the concert for the factory victims on January 10.

655
00:55:08,745 --> 00:55:11,355
Considering the timeline, if that was when he found out...

656
00:55:11,356 --> 00:55:13,986
that his sister was buried here, everything checks out.

657
00:55:14,225 --> 00:55:17,126
I see. Is that why you contacted the security office...

658
00:55:17,856 --> 00:55:21,296
for the security footage and all the records?

659
00:55:22,365 --> 00:55:23,365
Too bad.

660
00:55:23,366 --> 00:55:26,436
You would've been able to find out had they kept the records.

661
00:55:30,876 --> 00:55:33,635
To tell you the truth, I went there last night...

662
00:55:34,575 --> 00:55:36,006
and got everything I needed...

663
00:55:37,515 --> 00:55:38,546
already.

664
00:55:42,345 --> 00:55:44,756
(The night before)

665
00:55:47,586 --> 00:55:49,325
- Hello. - Hello, how may I help you?

666
00:55:50,055 --> 00:55:51,095
Police.

667
00:55:51,796 --> 00:55:53,595
That camera outside.

668
00:55:53,696 --> 00:55:55,365
Can I check the footage from January?

669
00:55:55,725 --> 00:55:56,825
Yes, sure.

670
00:56:00,736 --> 00:56:02,405
This is from January 10.

671
00:56:03,905 --> 00:56:04,936
This is you, right?

672
00:56:11,276 --> 00:56:12,615
You were caught on the camera...

673
00:56:12,916 --> 00:56:14,586
an hour after the concert ended.

674
00:56:15,385 --> 00:56:16,614
What if Lee Ba Reun...

675
00:56:16,615 --> 00:56:18,515
saw you at the concert and followed you there?

676
00:56:19,586 --> 00:56:20,986
Nonsense.

677
00:56:21,825 --> 00:56:22,925
Stop, okay?

678
00:56:23,586 --> 00:56:24,594
It wasn't me.

679
00:56:24,595 --> 00:56:25,995
It wasn't you? Are you sure?

680
00:56:26,526 --> 00:56:28,665
Shall I trace the places you visited that day and the routes you took?

681
00:56:28,666 --> 00:56:30,396
- Do it. - Do it? Okay, sure.

682
00:56:30,736 --> 00:56:32,695
Let's find out if you were the man Lee Ba Reun followed that day.

683
00:56:32,696 --> 00:56:34,166
I'll keep on digging with all my might.

684
00:56:36,666 --> 00:56:37,675
If this turns out to be you,

685
00:56:39,836 --> 00:56:41,276
I'll make you pay for it.

686
00:56:43,146 --> 00:56:44,475
For Jung Won's sake.

687
00:56:58,955 --> 00:57:00,396
(National Forensic Service)

688
00:57:11,535 --> 00:57:13,675
Detective Kim, I have something to tell you.

689
00:57:15,845 --> 00:57:17,075
My dad...

690
00:57:17,816 --> 00:57:19,344
was murdered...

691
00:57:19,345 --> 00:57:21,486
after he threatened the person who killed Lee Na Ri.

692
00:57:22,546 --> 00:57:24,586
And the person who murdered him killed Cha Eun Sae too.

693
00:57:26,615 --> 00:57:27,725
What did you say?

694
00:57:37,535 --> 00:57:38,565
This is...

695
00:57:38,566 --> 00:57:39,864
Yoo Yoon Young left behind this footage...

696
00:57:39,865 --> 00:57:41,466
from a spy cam recorded the day Cha Eun Sae died.

697
00:57:41,836 --> 00:57:43,265
The man who killed Cha Eun Sae...

698
00:57:45,205 --> 00:57:47,146
murdered my dad too.

699
00:57:47,745 --> 00:57:48,876
How can you be so sure?

700
00:57:48,905 --> 00:57:50,245
The day my dad was murdered,

701
00:57:50,776 --> 00:57:52,316
I saw it with my own two eyes.

702
00:57:53,845 --> 00:57:55,245
The black clothes and the black ball cap.

703
00:57:55,486 --> 00:57:56,845
Even the knife is identical.

00:58:06,256 --> 00:58:07,666
(Kim Tae Heon)

706
00:58:32,155 --> 00:58:33,186
What is that?

707
00:58:37,225 --> 00:58:39,325
- Let go! - What if I refuse?

708
00:58:39,455 --> 00:58:40,495
Darn you.

709
00:58:42,225 --> 00:58:43,325
Who are you, mister?

710
00:58:46,236 --> 00:58:48,066
- Are you a thug? - I'm a cop, you brat.

711
00:58:49,736 --> 00:58:50,736
A cop?

712
00:58:53,975 --> 00:58:56,506
Before Yoo Yoon Young died, she told me...

713
00:58:57,276 --> 00:58:59,416
that Woo Jae was the one who killed Cha Eun Sae.

714
00:59:01,446 --> 00:59:03,015
I had to check it wasn't him,

715
00:59:03,686 --> 00:59:04,916
so I couldn't turn it in sooner.

716
00:59:05,856 --> 00:59:07,055
I believe this man...

717
00:59:07,186 --> 00:59:08,856
killed Lee Na Ri, my dad,

718
00:59:09,655 --> 00:59:11,256
and Ba Reun too.

719
01:00:19,626 --> 01:00:22,595
(Nothing Uncovered)

720
01:00:22,796 --> 01:00:25,535
Who is this person? I will find out, no matter what.

721
01:00:25,666 --> 01:00:27,704
Will you find the killer yourself?

722
01:00:27,705 --> 01:00:29,364
They've released Lee Na Ri's autopsy report.

723
01:00:29,365 --> 01:00:31,074
Seol Woo Jae hit her with the car.

724
01:00:31,075 --> 01:00:32,134
So it was a hit-and-run?

725
01:00:32,135 --> 01:00:34,704
Did you know that Mr. Gong killed Jung Won's father too?

726
01:00:34,705 --> 01:00:36,344
You didn't order him to do it, did you?

727
01:00:36,345 --> 01:00:38,675
You've never once let me down.

728
01:00:38,745 --> 01:00:39,745
Have your skills gotten rusty?

729
01:00:39,746 --> 01:00:41,215
If Seol Woo Jae was the hit-and-run driver,

730
01:00:41,216 --> 01:00:42,586
and if that man buried her...

731
01:00:42,885 --> 01:00:44,614
My dad visited Mueon in 2009,

732
01:00:44,615 --> 01:00:47,055
saying he was working on a report.

733
01:00:47,086 --> 01:00:48,725
Do you know what he was working on?

734
01:00:48,955 --> 01:00:50,755
I should have never met you.

735
01:00:50,756 --> 01:00:53,095
I should have never loved you.

736
01:00:53,396 --> 01:00:54,666
Leave Seol Woo Jae.

737
01:00:54,825 --> 01:00:57,936
I will get you out of that miserable place as soon as I can.
