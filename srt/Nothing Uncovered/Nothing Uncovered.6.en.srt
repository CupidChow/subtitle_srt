You know why.

really is the culprit, it'll be dangerous.

17
00:00:34,602 --> 00:00:35,833
Isn't that why you told me to keep tabs on her?

18
00:00:36,572 --> 00:00:39,002
Maybe she's going to Mueon to meet that woman.

19

27
00:01:45,942 --> 00:01:48,743
Don't tell me you came all the way here to tail me.

He's a victim too!

183
00:10:47,482 --> 00:10:50,582
He's at death's door!

184
00:10:50,612 --> 00:10:53,322
Because he's at death's door, even though he's a suspect,

185
00:10:53,783 --> 00:10:55,722
he gets to rest instead of being questioned.

186
00:10:57,822 --> 00:10:58,862
"Rest?"

187
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:01,192
He's in a coma...

188
00:11:02,163 --> 00:11:03,362
and you call that "rest?"

189
00:11:05,563 --> 00:11:07,263
How could you say that?

190
00:11:07,263 --> 00:11:09,572
Since that day, whenever I see him on TV,

191
00:11:09,572 --> 00:11:11,033
I curse him out.

192
00:11:21,883 --> 00:11:22,913
Hello.

193
00:11:23,653 --> 00:11:26,523
I'm Detective Kim Tae Heon from Gangha's Violent Crimes Unit.

194
00:11:26,883 --> 00:11:29,293
- Hello. - I heard Seo Jung Won was here,

195
00:11:29,293 --> 00:11:31,663
and she asked to speak with you.

196
00:11:34,663 --> 00:11:36,393
(Chicken and Whelk)

197
00:11:38,862 --> 00:11:40,933
Address of the place Kim Tae Heon was at.

198
00:11:42,033 --> 00:11:43,503
- Thanks. - Enjoy yourselves.

199
00:11:43,503 --> 00:11:45,403
- Thanks. - Welcome.

200
00:11:45,403 --> 00:11:48,143
Hello. I'm Seo Jung Won, a reporter.

201
00:11:48,513 --> 00:11:50,242
From "Nothing Uncovered?"

202
00:11:50,942 --> 00:11:52,082
That's you?

203
00:11:52,082 --> 00:11:54,043
A detective from Gangha Police Station...

204
00:11:54,043 --> 00:11:55,653
was here, wasn't he?

205
00:11:56,283 --> 00:11:58,423
(Chicken and Whelk)

206
00:12:07,763 --> 00:12:10,163
Tae Heon's here on Jin Myung Sook's case,

207
00:12:10,163 --> 00:12:12,332
not Cha Eun Sae's.

208
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:15,273
There has to be a connection between the two.

209
00:12:21,742 --> 00:12:22,742
"Yoo Yoon Young."

210
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:23,773
(Seol Woo Jae, Yoo Yoon Young, Kim Min Chul, Lee Na Ri)

211
00:12:24,513 --> 00:12:25,612
Where did I see that name?

212
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:28,153
(You and Me Neuropsychiatric Clinic)

213
00:12:29,452 --> 00:12:32,923
(Director Yoo Yoon Young)

214
00:12:38,092 --> 00:12:39,893
(You and Me Neuropsychiatric Clinic)

215
00:12:41,362 --> 00:12:43,232
(Director Yoo Yoon Young)

216
00:12:45,163 --> 00:12:46,202
This woman...

217
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:57,072
So, she knew Seol Woo Jae personally,

218
00:12:58,683 --> 00:13:00,283
not Seo Jung Won?

219
00:13:05,153 --> 00:13:07,582
- What? - Ms. Seo scares me.

220
00:13:07,582 --> 00:13:09,352
- How so? - That woman.

221
00:13:09,352 --> 00:13:11,462
She was at Park Jin Soo's sister's beer joint.

222
00:13:11,462 --> 00:13:13,092
She knew you'd been there.

223
00:13:13,393 --> 00:13:16,332
I think she knows Jin Myung Sook was connected to...

224
00:13:16,332 --> 00:13:17,633
the Bongto factory fire.

225
00:13:17,832 --> 00:13:19,433
Where is Seo Jung Won now?

226
00:13:34,582 --> 00:13:37,982
I warned you not to tail me.

227
00:13:37,982 --> 00:13:39,283
You tailed me too.

228
00:13:41,992 --> 00:13:43,192
How was the visit to Mueon High?

229
00:13:44,293 --> 00:13:46,663
The foundation PR video was an excuse.

230
00:13:47,563 --> 00:13:48,832
You looked into your husband's past.

231
00:13:48,832 --> 00:13:51,133
- Why do you care? - I have to care.

232
00:13:51,293 --> 00:13:53,702
Unlike how you defended him when he had an affair,

233
00:13:53,702 --> 00:13:56,072
you're secretly doing a background check on him.

234
00:13:56,232 --> 00:13:57,803
Anyone would think it's suspicious.

235
00:13:58,372 --> 00:14:00,173
Why are you so frustrated?

236
00:14:00,442 --> 00:14:01,842
Are you that angry I looked into...

237
00:14:01,842 --> 00:14:03,913
your partner but turned a blind eye to my husband's affair?

238
00:14:03,913 --> 00:14:05,313
The case was closed when he died.

239
00:14:05,313 --> 00:14:06,612
Don't jump to conclusions.

240
00:14:08,153 --> 00:14:09,452
Will defending him...

241
00:14:11,413 --> 00:14:12,753
cancel out what he did?

242
00:14:14,923 --> 00:14:18,053
Yes. On the outside, I'm defending my cheater husband,

243
00:14:18,362 --> 00:14:20,763
and in secret, I looked into his past, but...

244
00:14:21,063 --> 00:14:23,433
unlike you, I don't ignore reality...

245
00:14:23,433 --> 00:14:25,102
and dwell in the past.

246
00:14:28,972 --> 00:14:30,403
The woman in the wine-colored coat.

247
00:14:34,673 --> 00:14:35,773
It's Yoo Yoon Young, isn't it?

248
00:14:37,913 --> 00:14:39,543
Seol Woo Jae's high-school friend...

249
00:14:39,543 --> 00:14:41,712
and Seo Jung Won's psychiatrist.

250
00:14:44,352 --> 00:14:45,383
I can't say.

251
00:14:47,183 --> 00:14:48,893
You're always like this.

252
00:14:49,153 --> 00:14:51,663
You never want to take a loss and always want to use me.

253
00:14:51,663 --> 00:14:53,092
You're the one who used me.

254
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:56,293
Did I want to know about a wine-colored coat?

255
00:14:56,533 --> 00:14:59,362
Why should I tell you if I found her or not?

256
00:14:59,362 --> 00:15:00,362
Are you stupid?

257
00:15:00,702 --> 00:15:01,702
If we identify her,

258
00:15:01,702 --> 00:15:03,803
- you'll be dropped as a... - That's a joke.

259
00:15:04,842 --> 00:15:08,472
Let's say you're right and Yoo is the woman in that coat.

260
00:15:08,472 --> 00:15:09,612
What's weird about her...

261
00:15:09,612 --> 00:15:12,082
entering her clinic's building around the time of the murder?

262
00:15:12,942 --> 00:15:14,852
If you identify her, are you sure...

263
00:15:14,852 --> 00:15:16,883
I'll be dropped from the suspect list?

264
00:15:16,883 --> 00:15:19,582
No. You'll suspect me all the same.

265
00:15:21,283 --> 00:15:23,023
I don't want to move the way you want.

266
00:15:23,553 --> 00:15:25,293
I won't answer anything.

267
00:15:25,992 --> 00:15:27,462
Think whatever you want.

268
00:15:29,563 --> 00:15:30,563
You're right.

269
00:15:31,462 --> 00:15:33,163
I have to keep suspecting you.

270
00:15:33,633 --> 00:15:35,303
Because I think you lied.

271
00:15:37,372 --> 00:15:38,872
The day Cha was killed.

272
00:15:40,742 --> 00:15:42,173
You went to the scene, didn't you?

273
00:15:43,043 --> 00:15:44,212
Just like when Jin died.

274
00:15:45,942 --> 00:15:47,683
I said no when you questioned me.

275
00:15:47,683 --> 00:15:49,712
I should believe you if you said no.

276
00:15:51,212 --> 00:15:52,383
But I can't.

277
00:15:53,523 --> 00:15:54,923
I want to believe you!

278
00:15:57,222 --> 00:15:58,622
But I can't.

279
00:16:01,462 --> 00:16:03,332
When did you ever believe me?

280
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:06,433
Believe whatever you want.

281
00:16:07,732 --> 00:16:09,072
That's what you always did.

282
00:16:24,212 --> 00:16:26,153
(3 years ago)

283
00:16:30,192 --> 00:16:32,263
(Commissioner of the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency)

284
00:16:34,263 --> 00:16:36,533
(Rest in peace. We offer our condolences.)

285
00:16:52,742 --> 00:16:54,513
(No smoking, Beware of falls)

286
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:02,423
I told you to stay away.

287
00:17:02,423 --> 00:17:03,692
Didn't you hear me?

288
00:17:04,092 --> 00:17:05,592
I was close to him too.

289
00:17:05,592 --> 00:17:07,463
You got close because of me.

290
00:17:08,092 --> 00:17:09,862
You approached me to get to him.

291
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,263
If the officer suspected of bribery...

292
00:17:11,563 --> 00:17:13,902
were you and not him, I'd have done the same.

293
00:17:17,402 --> 00:17:18,872
Before he died, he told me...

294
00:17:19,203 --> 00:17:20,503
that you had deceived me.

295
00:17:22,213 --> 00:17:24,142
That I should stop being a fool and let you use me.

296
00:17:28,043 --> 00:17:29,213
Say something.

297
00:17:30,652 --> 00:17:31,682
Come on.

298
00:17:33,953 --> 00:17:34,953
Please?

299
00:17:36,293 --> 00:17:37,453
Why won't you say anything?

300
00:17:39,122 --> 00:17:42,132
Why can't you even give me an excuse and tell me you weren't using me?

301
00:17:44,493 --> 00:17:45,563
If I say so,

302
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:48,162
will you believe me?

303
00:17:51,172 --> 00:17:52,273
If I tell you...

304
00:17:52,703 --> 00:17:54,303
I didn't approach you on purpose to investigate Detective Cha,

305
00:17:55,043 --> 00:17:56,372
will you take my word for it?

306
00:17:58,882 --> 00:18:02,253
This just shows the extent of your trust in me.

307
00:18:02,612 --> 00:18:04,053
Just believe what you like.

308
00:18:04,253 --> 00:18:06,283
Admit that blaming everything on me will make you feel better.

309
00:18:20,332 --> 00:18:21,432
You're something else.

310
00:18:46,523 --> 00:18:48,023
A bowl of udon and a bottle of soju, please.

311
00:18:48,023 --> 00:18:49,033
Sure!

312
00:19:20,023 --> 00:19:21,592
Another bottle of soju, please.

313
00:19:30,632 --> 00:19:32,243
I heard you were once transported to a hospital because of cirrhosis.

314
00:19:32,243 --> 00:19:33,303
You've had enough.

315
00:19:40,543 --> 00:19:43,412
You said the same thing to me both three years ago...

316
00:19:45,152 --> 00:19:46,483
and earlier today.

317
00:19:47,422 --> 00:19:49,822
You told me to believe whatever I wanted to believe.

318
00:19:51,862 --> 00:19:53,263
Why do you keep saying that to me?

319
00:19:55,693 --> 00:19:56,892
Are you implying...

320
00:19:58,063 --> 00:19:59,303
I've got the wrong idea about you?

321
00:20:01,832 --> 00:20:03,102
If there's anything you want to say, go ahead.

322
00:20:09,412 --> 00:20:10,513
You and I...

323
00:20:11,713 --> 00:20:13,582
shouldn't have met. That's where it went wrong.

324
00:20:15,483 --> 00:20:18,283
There were other detectives too. Why did it have to be you?

325
00:20:20,283 --> 00:20:21,852
You've already seen me at my lowest.

326
00:20:21,852 --> 00:20:22,993
Do you know how awful it feels...

327
00:20:22,993 --> 00:20:24,122
to hit rock bottom with you watching?

328
00:21:25,422 --> 00:21:29,523
(Pedestrian Crossing)

329
00:21:51,112 --> 00:21:55,813
(Mueon Beach, Mueon Stall Street)

330
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:01,753
I'm in a worse place than you are.

331
00:22:04,392 --> 00:22:06,993
I'd rather see you living in luxury and a better life without me.

332
00:22:09,063 --> 00:22:11,092
Seeing that miserable look on your face...

333
00:22:13,503 --> 00:22:14,533
is annoying.

334
00:22:16,803 --> 00:22:17,932
It's upsetting me.

335
00:22:22,773 --> 00:22:24,313
Meeting you again...

336
00:22:27,882 --> 00:22:28,882
I know.

337
00:22:29,983 --> 00:22:31,053
You're angry.

338
00:22:33,322 --> 00:22:34,582
I'm angry...

339
00:22:40,463 --> 00:22:41,523
and sad.

340
00:22:46,362 --> 00:22:47,432
And...

341
00:23:12,258 --> 00:23:13,558
Is he all right?

342
00:23:13,657 --> 00:23:16,427
- Could you give us another room? - Sure. This way.

343
00:23:22,867 --> 00:23:23,867
Gosh.

344
00:23:37,347 --> 00:23:39,117
Just like you said,

345
00:23:43,617 --> 00:23:46,857
I don't think you can kill someone in the same way...

346
00:23:49,798 --> 00:23:51,798
your father was murdered.

347
00:24:02,208 --> 00:24:03,677
(My Husband)

348
00:24:03,677 --> 00:24:05,077
So...

349
00:24:08,978 --> 00:24:10,218
help me believe you.

350
00:24:13,887 --> 00:24:14,887
Hello.

351
00:24:14,887 --> 00:24:16,117
(My Husband)

352
00:24:18,988 --> 00:24:19,988
Hello.

353
00:24:21,157 --> 00:24:23,228
(My Husband)

354
00:24:31,698 --> 00:24:34,137
Sorry. I tapped the wrong button, so I hung up by mistake.

355
00:24:34,867 --> 00:24:35,877
I see.

356
00:24:37,137 --> 00:24:39,048
I heard a man's voice just now.

357
00:24:40,548 --> 00:24:41,708
Someone was walking by.

358
00:24:42,448 --> 00:24:44,018
Where are you? Aren't you at your accommodation?

359
00:24:45,077 --> 00:24:47,448
I just arrived. Why did you call me?

360
00:24:48,387 --> 00:24:50,288
I was wondering at what time you'd arrive tomorrow.

361
00:24:51,117 --> 00:24:52,327
I won't be too late.

362
00:24:54,258 --> 00:24:55,798
Okay. Call me when you head out.

363
00:24:57,758 --> 00:24:58,798
Sleep tight.

364
00:25:35,768 --> 00:25:36,768
Who is it?

365
00:25:41,538 --> 00:25:42,738
Thanks for inviting me.

366
00:25:46,907 --> 00:25:47,907
Gosh.

367
00:25:50,748 --> 00:25:51,748
What are you doing here?

368
00:25:51,847 --> 00:25:53,318
What do you think? I'm visiting you.

369
00:25:54,448 --> 00:25:56,558
Your wife wanted to invite me to your house too.

370
00:25:57,417 --> 00:26:00,028
Ms. Seo. I'm here!

371
00:26:00,028 --> 00:26:02,427
Hey, Jung Won went on a business trip.

372
00:26:02,927 --> 00:26:03,927
Get out.

373
00:26:04,127 --> 00:26:05,897
I know that she went on a business trip.

374
00:26:06,897 --> 00:26:07,968
That's why I'm here.

375
00:26:09,498 --> 00:26:11,768
Will you keep acting out of control?

376
00:26:13,568 --> 00:26:15,038
Are you trying to make me go crazy?

377
00:26:15,038 --> 00:26:16,508
Come on. This is nothing.

378
00:26:17,677 --> 00:26:20,308
What if I were to leak the photo of her shirt, stained with blood?

379
00:26:24,778 --> 00:26:25,917
There's a photo?

380
00:26:27,587 --> 00:26:28,587
Let me see it.

381
00:26:32,657 --> 00:26:34,657
You two don't sleep in the same bed, right?

382
00:26:36,097 --> 00:26:37,198
Do you sleep in separate rooms?

383
00:26:37,657 --> 00:26:38,657
Hey.

384
00:26:39,597 --> 00:26:40,597
Hey!

385
00:26:42,337 --> 00:26:43,397
Hey, open the door.

386
00:27:27,508 --> 00:27:28,508
Get up.

387
00:27:29,478 --> 00:27:31,647
Get up!

388
00:27:34,917 --> 00:27:36,018
You.

389
00:27:36,617 --> 00:27:38,117
You'd better not do this again.

390
00:27:38,117 --> 00:27:40,028
Why do you think I do stuff like this?

391
00:27:40,458 --> 00:27:43,558
You only look at me when I bother you like this.

392
00:27:45,768 --> 00:27:46,827
Yoon Young.

393
00:27:49,068 --> 00:27:50,867
I consider you a good friend.

394
00:27:54,008 --> 00:27:55,068
To me,

395
00:27:55,937 --> 00:27:57,538
you're a jerk I want to kill.

396
00:27:58,877 --> 00:28:01,347
When you love someone to death,

397
00:28:01,948 --> 00:28:03,647
you can actually kill a person, whoever it may be.

398
00:28:05,077 --> 00:28:06,988
That's why I killed Cha Eun Sae.

399
00:28:11,458 --> 00:28:12,687
What's with that reaction?

400
00:28:13,327 --> 00:28:14,927
I can't even crack a joke with you.

401
00:28:19,167 --> 00:28:20,367
How could you say such a thing?

402
00:28:23,167 --> 00:28:24,798
You look like you're about to hit me with that thing.

403
00:28:26,107 --> 00:28:27,167
Why?

404
00:28:27,667 --> 00:28:29,538
Wasn't she just a fleeting distraction?

405
00:28:33,407 --> 00:28:34,847
This is why...

406
00:28:34,847 --> 00:28:37,518
your wife wants to throw you into the fiery pit.

407
00:28:37,518 --> 00:28:38,577
If anyone...

408
00:28:39,948 --> 00:28:42,488
threatens my wife, I will throw them...

409
00:28:42,488 --> 00:28:44,018
into the fiery pit myself.

410
00:28:44,018 --> 00:28:45,958
You're only making me not want to give up.

411
00:28:46,788 --> 00:28:47,788
Actually, no.

412
00:28:49,258 --> 00:28:52,568
This means you are bothered by me, which is a good thing.

413
00:28:52,568 --> 00:28:53,667
Right?

414
00:28:58,867 --> 00:29:00,008
I'll be leaving, then.

415
00:29:02,538 --> 00:29:03,538
Oh, right.

416
00:29:04,607 --> 00:29:06,778
I almost forgot to give you your surprise gift.

417
00:29:11,248 --> 00:29:12,448
You'll like it.

418
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:20,927

419
00:30:41,667 --> 00:30:43,708
Hop in. You haven't fully sobered up yet, so you can't drive.

420
00:30:43,708 --> 00:30:44,907
You don't know where I'm headed...

421
00:30:55,448 --> 00:30:56,558
Enjoy.

422
00:31:00,228 --> 00:31:02,157
You were going to grab something for your hangover first anyway.

423
00:31:11,568 --> 00:31:14,437
- Is it too spicy? Do you like it? - Yes.

424
00:31:18,577 --> 00:31:20,377
Ever since I found out my husband cheated on me,

425
00:31:21,308 --> 00:31:23,478
I haven't been able to taste anything.

426
00:31:29,958 --> 00:31:32,758
That woman in the wine-colored coat. It was Yoo Yoon Young.

427
00:31:34,827 --> 00:31:36,097
I saw her at the kick-off ceremony.

428
00:31:37,298 --> 00:31:38,498
I bet you invited her on purpose,

429
00:31:38,758 --> 00:31:40,327
to see how your husband would react.

430
00:31:41,167 --> 00:31:42,397
The bigger goal...

431
00:31:43,468 --> 00:31:45,367
was to buy enough time to copy...

432
00:31:45,468 --> 00:31:46,968
the video of Cha Eun Sae's session.

433
00:31:48,308 --> 00:31:50,607
Cha Eun Sae was her client too?

434
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:53,377
I watched the video...

435
00:31:53,377 --> 00:31:55,308
of Cha Eun Sae's last session before she died.

436
00:31:55,448 --> 00:31:57,548
In the video, a girl named Na Ri is mentioned.

437
00:31:57,548 --> 00:31:58,617
Na Ri?

438
00:31:58,617 --> 00:32:01,018
I came here to find out who she was.

439
00:32:01,018 --> 00:32:02,018
Wait.

440
00:32:07,228 --> 00:32:08,228
Who is Lee Na Ri?

441
00:32:08,228 --> 00:32:10,698
One of the people who died in the fire at the Bongto plant.

442
00:32:12,397 --> 00:32:15,068
So, every person we tried to track down in Mueon...

443
00:32:15,897 --> 00:32:18,597
died in that fire?

(Mueon Police Station)

00:32:25,407 --> 00:32:28,978

Detective, weren't you the one...

447
00:32:30,917 --> 00:32:32,988
who handed him over to the prosecution to be indicted?

448
00:32:32,988 --> 00:32:34,748
Back then, Prosecutor Mo hounded me...

449
00:32:34,748 --> 00:32:37,218
into handing over the case with the decision to indict him.

Oh, that.

453
00:32:46,897 --> 00:32:49,568
It was one of the victim's belongings found at the scene.

454
00:32:51,798 --> 00:32:54,607
- The fire broke out at nine. - Correct.

455

Was there no battery in this watch?

Was there no battery?

460
00:33:18,057 --> 00:33:21,028
Oh, right. We had returned it to the victim's family,

461
00:33:21,028 --> 00:33:23,437
but they refused to accept it and told us to reinvestigate it.

462
00:33:23,667 --> 00:33:25,267
Reinvestigate what?

463
00:33:25,537 --> 00:33:26,667
They said it was odd that...

464
00:33:26,667 --> 00:33:28,568
the strap was broken and that there was no battery.

465
00:33:28,908 --> 00:33:31,807
They were adamant that someone had hurt the victim.

466
00:33:43,917 --> 00:33:45,218
Who was this victim?

467
00:33:46,087 --> 00:33:47,787
Does the victim's family still live in Mueon?

468
00:33:47,828 --> 00:33:50,158
No, the whole family moved to a different country.

469
00:33:51,057 --> 00:33:52,057
Why do you ask?

470
00:33:52,497 --> 00:33:53,497
By any chance,

471
00:33:53,997 --> 00:33:56,298
is Lee Na Ri this victim you're speaking of?

472
00:33:56,298 --> 00:33:58,098
She was in her second year at Mueon High.

473
00:33:58,738 --> 00:34:00,368
What? How did you know?

474
00:34:05,508 --> 00:34:10,078
(Meeting Room)

475
00:34:10,078 --> 00:34:12,118
There were pictures of several items found at the scene.

476
00:34:12,118 --> 00:34:14,318
Why did that watch catch your attention, of all things?

477
00:34:16,457 --> 00:34:18,017
The watch was stopped...

478
00:34:18,587 --> 00:34:20,627
at the time of the incident. What's up with that?

479
00:34:22,658 --> 00:34:24,328
There were a number of victims.

480
00:34:24,897 --> 00:34:27,098
Why Lee Na Ri's watch?

481
00:34:27,368 --> 00:34:29,997
I want to ask the same question. Why did it have to be Lee Na Ri?

482
00:34:30,437 --> 00:34:32,368
Did the culprit start the fire to kill her?

483
00:34:32,397 --> 00:34:33,537
What do you mean?

484
00:34:33,937 --> 00:34:36,008
Does the watch have something to do with the incident itself?

485
00:34:38,707 --> 00:34:39,807
I guess it does.

486
00:34:40,747 --> 00:34:42,707
How did you know that by just looking at that watch?

487
00:34:44,048 --> 00:34:45,417
There was a stopped clock...

488
00:34:45,877 --> 00:34:47,488
at the other scene.

489
00:34:49,318 --> 00:34:50,388
You mean, Cha Eun Sae's office?

490
00:34:50,388 --> 00:34:52,417
I wouldn't say this if I only saw it twice.

491
00:34:52,417 --> 00:34:54,187
So you saw it at the scene of Jin Myung Sook's murder too.

492
00:34:54,787 --> 00:34:57,098
In other words, are you saying...

493
00:34:57,698 --> 00:34:59,798
the same signature was found at the scenes of the three cases?

494
00:34:59,798 --> 00:35:00,897
So they were all done...

495
00:35:01,727 --> 00:35:03,068
by the same person?

496
00:35:07,337 --> 00:35:09,337
You know, the necklace of mine found at the scene of Cha's murder.

497
00:35:09,707 --> 00:35:11,807
It would've been easier for Yoo Yoon Young...

498
00:35:12,238 --> 00:35:14,008
to get her hands on it than for Mo Hyung Taek.

499
00:35:14,647 --> 00:35:16,578
It's possible my husband gave it to her.

500
00:35:17,977 --> 00:35:21,118
What if it's untrue that she has no connection to Jin Myung Sook?

501
00:35:21,118 --> 00:35:22,488
What if we simply haven't found it yet?

502
00:35:48,747 --> 00:35:49,818

00:37:05,017 --> 00:37:07,428
Of course, I'm not. Someone tailed a detective.

And in Mueon of all places.

507
00:37:20,008 --> 00:37:21,068
I apologize.

00:40:01,428 --> 00:40:02,428
Are you tired?

543
00:40:04,968 --> 00:40:06,437
Where did you go on the trip?

544
00:40:08,267 --> 00:40:09,508
Did you drive?

545
00:40:14,877 --> 00:40:15,908
Did you have dinner?

546
00:40:22,948 --> 00:40:24,318
(Yoo Yoon Young)

547
00:40:24,318 --> 00:40:25,417
(Kim Min Chul)

548
00:40:27,057 --> 00:40:28,328
(Lee Na Ri)

549
00:40:32,997 --> 00:40:34,098
You should knock.

550
00:40:36,328 --> 00:40:38,868
We're the only ones who knock when we live together.

551
00:40:41,707 --> 00:40:43,238
Is it that hard to answer?

552
00:40:44,508 --> 00:40:46,238
This is torture, not a chance.

553
00:40:46,707 --> 00:40:48,178
Don't you see I'm flailing...

554
00:40:48,178 --> 00:40:50,948
because I'm glad for a chance and I'm trying to win you back?

555
00:40:51,618 --> 00:40:54,048
How much longer will you ignore me after giving me hope?

556
00:40:54,048 --> 00:40:55,687
You ignored me first.

557
00:40:55,948 --> 00:40:57,158
Cha Eun Sae and...

558
00:40:57,718 --> 00:40:58,758
And what?

559
00:41:05,698 --> 00:41:06,798
I know...

560
00:41:08,727 --> 00:41:10,437
you put a GPS tracker on my car.

561
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:15,638
Jung Won.

562
00:41:17,307 --> 00:41:19,707
If you'll give me a chance, make it a real one.

563
00:41:21,147 --> 00:41:23,948
I regret saying I'd give you a chance.

564
00:41:26,048 --> 00:41:28,087
I can't stand seeing you try so hard,

565
00:41:28,087 --> 00:41:29,857
and seeing you watch old clips.

566
00:41:29,857 --> 00:41:32,357
Everything you do annoys me and I hate it.

567
00:41:38,758 --> 00:41:39,868
Do you feel better now?

568
00:41:41,868 --> 00:41:43,767
Thanks for being honest.

569
00:41:48,207 --> 00:41:50,678
We live together and see each other every day.

570
00:41:53,908 --> 00:41:55,477
And I still miss you.

571
00:41:57,078 --> 00:41:58,778
I wondered why that was,

572
00:41:58,778 --> 00:42:01,048
and it was because I don't remember when you last smiled.

573
00:42:01,417 --> 00:42:02,687
That's why I watched the clip.

574
00:42:05,687 --> 00:42:07,287
Even if I annoy you and you hate it,

575
00:42:08,528 --> 00:42:10,658
I'll keep trying and flailing.

576
00:42:23,638 --> 00:42:25,138
I won't give up on you.

577
00:42:29,807 --> 00:42:30,848
I can't do that.

578
00:42:55,107 --> 00:42:56,908
- Hi. - You were right.

579
00:42:57,537 --> 00:42:59,337
The victims of the Bongto fire...

580
00:42:59,337 --> 00:43:01,807
received a donation in Jin's name every month.

581
00:43:02,107 --> 00:43:03,778
It's the amount she withdrew.

582
00:43:04,678 --> 00:43:06,017
That's one mystery solved.

583
00:43:06,017 --> 00:43:08,587
But another one popped up.

584
00:43:08,787 --> 00:43:10,258
- What's that? - The donations...

585
00:43:10,258 --> 00:43:11,718
were delivered in cash...

586
00:43:11,718 --> 00:43:13,258
by a man in his 20s or 30s.

587
00:43:14,428 --> 00:43:17,698
That means someone was close to Jin Myung Sook.

588
00:43:18,798 --> 00:43:19,897
The CCTV footage is gone?

589
00:43:19,897 --> 00:43:21,127
Yes. It was two months ago.

590
00:43:21,528 --> 00:43:23,997
Shall I get a worker who saw him help draw a composite?

591
00:43:24,698 --> 00:43:25,937
Yes, do that.

592
00:43:38,017 --> 00:43:39,747
(Secretary Gong)

593
00:43:41,647 --> 00:43:44,087
- Hello. - Detective Kim Tae Heon.

594
00:43:44,618 --> 00:43:47,227
He went to Mueon two days ago and returned today.

595
00:43:49,758 --> 00:43:50,798
Did he?

596
00:43:51,598 --> 00:43:52,627
Thanks.

597
00:43:58,198 --> 00:43:59,598
So...

598
00:44:01,607 --> 00:44:02,837
make me believe you.

599
00:44:13,948 --> 00:44:15,118
My gosh.

600
00:44:24,298 --> 00:44:27,167
You're so desperate to win.

601
00:44:27,627 --> 00:44:29,627
That means it's not a simple bet.

602
00:44:29,767 --> 00:44:32,397
You get it because it's a trick you used as a prosecutor.

603
00:44:32,638 --> 00:44:35,868
Back then, you made me do a lot of things.

604
00:44:38,477 --> 00:44:40,247
Why bring up the past?

605
00:44:40,578 --> 00:44:41,977
The tables turned long ago,

606
00:44:42,247 --> 00:44:44,417
and now you're way above me.

607
00:44:44,917 --> 00:44:47,718
I couldn't remain a politician without your help.

608
00:44:49,548 --> 00:44:52,618
Our circumstances changed because times have changed.

609
00:44:55,158 --> 00:44:58,298
Yes. What do you want done now?

610
00:44:59,428 --> 00:45:01,828
I'll tell you when I'm done sketching.

611
00:46:20,747 --> 00:46:21,877
(Coffee Village Cafe)

612
00:46:21,877 --> 00:46:23,647
(2 Iced Americano, 14 dollars)

613
00:46:28,618 --> 00:46:29,718
(Zeus)

614
00:46:34,928 --> 00:46:36,328
You were sleeping in an uncomfortable position,

615
00:46:37,328 --> 00:46:39,457
so I was wondering if I should wake you up or not.

616
00:46:41,028 --> 00:46:43,537
I need to talk to my source.

617
00:46:43,767 --> 00:46:46,267
Okay. I'll prepare breakfast.

618
00:47:06,057 --> 00:47:07,187
Jung Won...

619
00:47:07,957 --> 00:47:09,187
was in Mueon yesterday.

620
00:47:10,557 --> 00:47:13,298
You must find out why she went there, Dad.

621
00:47:23,607 --> 00:47:26,908
You must have heard some bad news this early in the morning.

622
00:47:30,977 --> 00:47:32,178
Yoo Yoon Young is the director...

623
00:47:32,178 --> 00:47:33,988
of You and Me Neuropsychiatric Clinic.

624
00:47:33,988 --> 00:47:35,087
Can you look into her?

625
00:47:35,087 --> 00:47:38,017
You're basically asking me to find dirt on her, right?

626
00:47:38,388 --> 00:47:39,417
Okay.

627
00:47:50,437 --> 00:47:51,837
(Coffee Village Cafe: 2 Iced Americano, 14 dollars)

628
00:48:21,798 --> 00:48:22,828
Sorry.

629
00:48:23,328 --> 00:48:25,037
I was on the phone with my dad.

630
00:48:25,968 --> 00:48:28,908
I didn't get to ask you yesterday, but what happened to your hand?

631
00:48:33,408 --> 00:48:35,107
I broke a cup accidentally and ended up with a cut.

632
00:48:41,218 --> 00:48:42,548
It was sneaky and petty of me.

633
00:48:43,348 --> 00:48:44,888
I won't do this sort of thing ever again.

634
00:48:48,828 --> 00:48:51,397
I went to Mueon on my business trip.

635
00:48:53,428 --> 00:48:54,568
I see.

636
00:48:55,997 --> 00:48:57,037
For what?

637
00:48:57,568 --> 00:48:58,738
I publicly announced that...

638
00:48:59,238 --> 00:49:02,738
I would expose Cha Eun Sae's killer on my show after a month.

639
00:49:03,537 --> 00:49:04,908
I went to investigate.

640
00:49:05,837 --> 00:49:07,678
I obtained a lot of useful information.

641
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:09,707
Is that so?

642
00:49:10,818 --> 00:49:12,578
Can I ask you what kind of information you found?

643
00:49:15,287 --> 00:49:16,818
It's completely confidential.

644
00:49:19,158 --> 00:49:20,658
You'll find out soon enough.

645
00:49:23,457 --> 00:49:24,457
Did you go...

646
00:49:25,957 --> 00:49:27,227
on the business trip alone?

647
00:49:28,598 --> 00:49:29,667
Yes.

648
00:49:35,905 --> 00:49:37,644
(Evidence location: Chemical plant in Mueon City)

649
00:49:41,365 --> 00:49:43,965
I can't believe you were right. This was the killer's signature.

650
00:49:47,235 --> 00:49:48,305
But...

651
00:49:48,834 --> 00:49:51,374
why a stopped clock?

652
00:49:51,874 --> 00:49:54,505
The killer stopped it at the estimated time of the murder.

653
00:49:54,505 --> 00:49:56,244
So it must be like a trophy of victory.

654
00:49:56,888 --> 00:49:58,158
The killer must have acted...

655
00:49:58,158 --> 00:50:00,227
in a state of euphoria after taking the victim's life.

656
00:50:00,227 --> 00:50:02,298
In a way, that makes the killer an even bigger pervert.

657
00:50:02,928 --> 00:50:04,868
By the way, the culprit must have no idea...

658
00:50:04,868 --> 00:50:06,368
that we obtained this crucial lead.

659
00:50:06,368 --> 00:50:07,568
Right?

660
00:50:13,408 --> 00:50:16,138
First of all, let's widen the search for Jin's murder suspects.

661
00:50:16,238 --> 00:50:18,207
Run Yoo Yoon Young's plate number in the system.

662
00:50:18,207 --> 00:50:20,147
Check if her car was caught on any security camera...

663
00:50:20,147 --> 00:50:22,318
or speed camera in Owol-dong on the day of Jin's murder. Okay?

664
00:50:28,057 --> 00:50:30,388
The program is bound to go down after a month anyway.

665
00:50:30,388 --> 00:50:31,727
Do you all want to go down with her?

666
00:50:33,127 --> 00:50:35,198
I'll let you join my program. Just jump ship.

667
00:50:35,198 --> 00:50:37,068
I have exactly two openings now.

668
00:50:37,068 --> 00:50:38,568
One for a cameraman and another for a writer.

669
00:50:39,468 --> 00:50:41,368
- Do you mean it? - Let's be honest.

670
00:50:41,638 --> 00:50:43,368
Forget about surviving a month. You know she won't last a year.

671
00:50:43,368 --> 00:50:45,508
Does she think she's a police officer?

672
00:50:45,508 --> 00:50:48,037
How is she going to catch the culprit?

673
00:50:48,037 --> 00:50:50,178
Besides, how is she going to air this on TV?

674
00:50:50,178 --> 00:50:53,307
This kind of behavior is putting your jobs in jeopardy. You know?

675
00:50:53,307 --> 00:50:54,977
Don't go down with her and be humiliated.

676
00:50:54,977 --> 00:50:56,278
Just cut ties with her already.

677
00:50:56,948 --> 00:50:57,948
Okay?

678
00:51:18,787 --> 00:51:20,927
(Prescription)

679
00:51:32,436 --> 00:51:33,566
Are you not well?

680
00:51:39,037 --> 00:51:40,077
Ae Na.

681
00:51:41,776 --> 00:51:43,307
Will you join Mr. No's team?

682
00:51:46,077 --> 00:51:47,416
I understand.

683
00:51:48,086 --> 00:51:49,816
The newbie told me everything.

684
00:51:51,557 --> 00:51:54,526
why you defended your husband in front of the reporters.

685
00:51:56,657 --> 00:51:58,597
You were so good to me.

686
00:52:00,427 --> 00:52:02,327
I feel awful that I misunderstood you.

687
00:52:03,936 --> 00:52:05,666
How could I leave you?

688
00:52:09,637 --> 00:52:11,476
You couldn't possibly understand what I wanted to do.

689
00:52:13,577 --> 00:52:15,206
I couldn't possibly understand you.

690
00:52:20,376 --> 00:52:21,747
So don't say that.

691
00:52:23,856 --> 00:52:24,956
Hold on.

692
00:52:25,717 --> 00:52:27,126
(My Husband)

693
00:52:28,787 --> 00:52:30,557
- Hey. - You're at the TV station, right?

694
00:52:30,927 --> 00:52:31,997
Yes.

695
00:52:32,097 --> 00:52:33,756
Dad wants to have lunch with us.

696
00:52:34,796 --> 00:52:36,927
I'm on my way there. I'll call you once I arrive.

697
00:52:38,197 --> 00:52:39,237
Okay.

698
00:52:56,816 --> 00:52:57,856
What's going on?

699
00:52:58,487 --> 00:53:00,017
Just the man I was looking for.

700
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:03,026
Well, the top drawer was locked.

701
00:53:03,026 --> 00:53:04,126
Could you open it?

702
00:53:04,356 --> 00:53:07,997
You have to tell me why you're searching my stuff first.

703
00:53:07,997 --> 00:53:10,867
Isn't it obvious? Someone reported you for bribery.

704
00:53:11,637 --> 00:53:13,497
Come on, you know the drill. Just cooperate with us already,

705
00:53:13,836 --> 00:53:14,936
so we can get this over with.

706
00:53:29,816 --> 00:53:30,956
Have you gone mad?

707
00:53:33,217 --> 00:53:35,256
You were the one who inspected Detective Cha, right?

708
00:53:36,086 --> 00:53:37,657
Do you think this kind of cheap trick...

709
00:53:37,657 --> 00:53:38,657
can bring me down like it did for Cha?

710
00:53:40,396 --> 00:53:43,467
Your boss ordered me to inspect Detective Cha.

711
00:53:43,767 --> 00:53:45,836
You shouldn't call it a cheap trick.

712
00:53:46,137 --> 00:53:47,367
You're a mere subordinate.

713
00:53:49,606 --> 00:53:50,706
Detective Kim.

714
00:53:53,177 --> 00:53:54,847
(Gangha Police Station)

715
00:53:59,347 --> 00:54:00,376
I was the one...

716
00:54:00,847 --> 00:54:02,487
who ordered them to inspect Detective Cha.

717
00:54:03,717 --> 00:54:05,586
It came from a trusted source.

718
00:54:05,787 --> 00:54:07,287
The day I got the report,

719
00:54:07,726 --> 00:54:10,726
Ms. Seo also heard about it. So that says it all.

720
00:54:28,807 --> 00:54:30,407
When did you get the report?

721
00:54:30,816 --> 00:54:32,747
- What? - When were you tipped off...

722
00:54:33,447 --> 00:54:34,617
about Detective Cha?

723
00:54:44,526 --> 00:54:45,896
(The late Seo Sang Gyeon)

724
00:54:57,436 --> 00:54:59,706
I didn't know there exists a man better-looking than me.

725
00:55:00,947 --> 00:55:03,546
To be precise, you should say "existed."

726
00:55:05,077 --> 00:55:06,217
He's gone now.

727
00:55:11,916 --> 00:55:13,586
My name is Kim Tae Heon.

728
00:55:16,787 --> 00:55:18,427
Your daughter kept hitting on me.

729
00:55:19,456 --> 00:55:20,867
She won me over in the end.

730
00:55:24,396 --> 00:55:26,166
I'm also without parents.

731
00:55:27,467 --> 00:55:29,967
My mother was a single parent, but she died of an illness.

732
00:55:31,336 --> 00:55:33,537
You probably hoped that your daughter...

733
00:55:34,146 --> 00:55:35,347
would date someone...

734
00:55:36,206 --> 00:55:37,916
who had parents and siblings.

735
00:55:37,916 --> 00:55:39,617
(The late Seo Sang Gyeon)

736
00:55:40,217 --> 00:55:41,287
I'm sorry.

737
00:55:43,046 --> 00:55:44,186
Since I'm all on my own too,

738
00:55:44,916 --> 00:55:47,827
I sure know how lonely it is to have to get through life...

739
00:55:48,526 --> 00:55:49,726
with no parents.

740
00:55:51,927 --> 00:55:55,666
I'll make sure Jung Won never feels lonely.

741
00:56:00,367 --> 00:56:02,737
I'll always put her before myself.

742
00:56:05,336 --> 00:56:07,476
I'll be good to her. Please watch over us, Father.

743
00:56:15,916 --> 00:56:18,117
I guess you received a tip-off.

744
00:56:21,126 --> 00:56:22,226
It must be something big.

745
00:56:26,097 --> 00:56:27,767
- I'll be right back. - Okay.

746
00:56:35,267 --> 00:56:37,006
She received the tip-off when we were dating.

747
00:56:38,137 --> 00:56:39,776
She didn't play me.

748
00:56:40,907 --> 00:56:42,476
Why didn't she say so?

749
00:57:11,936 --> 00:57:13,077
(371N 3386)

750
00:57:13,836 --> 00:57:16,106
Plate 371N 3386?

751
00:57:18,617 --> 00:57:19,646
That's him.

752
00:57:20,717 --> 00:57:22,416
(371N 3386)

753
00:57:49,776 --> 00:57:50,847
Seo Jung Won!

754
00:58:55,947 --> 00:58:58,376
- Hey. - Tae Heon, I found Yoo's car...

755
00:58:58,376 --> 00:58:59,646
caught on a speed camera in Owol-dong...

756
00:58:59,646 --> 00:59:00,916
on the day of Jin's murder.

757
00:59:00,916 --> 00:59:02,046
I'll send you the image right away.

758
00:59:02,947 --> 00:59:04,387
(Oh Myung Soo)

759
00:59:08,157 --> 00:59:10,927
(33M 6859)

760
00:59:11,057 --> 00:59:13,427
(371N 3386)

761
00:59:16,267 --> 00:59:18,967
What were you thinking, coming to the broadcasting station?

762
00:59:19,066 --> 00:59:21,037
What were you thinking, ignoring my calls?

763
00:59:21,436 --> 00:59:23,807
It's so hard to have a meal with you. What are you, the President?

764
00:59:26,177 --> 00:59:28,976
Do you remember the boiled pork restaurant behind the Bongto plant?

765
00:59:29,706 --> 00:59:32,177
I found a place that makes boiled pork that tastes just like that.

766
00:59:32,546 --> 00:59:35,046
How's boiled pork for lunch? Good idea, right?

767
00:59:36,416 --> 00:59:39,256
I came up with your nickname at that restaurant.

768
00:59:39,657 --> 00:59:42,186
Mr. Bribe, because there's nothing you love more than taking bribes.

769
00:59:45,557 --> 00:59:47,456
I bribed you most generously, didn't I?

770
00:59:52,767 --> 00:59:54,637
What is it that you want?

771
01:00:11,416 --> 01:00:14,256
There was only one reason I had you join the group.

772
01:00:14,827 --> 01:00:16,186
Keep a watchful eye on those servants...

773
01:00:16,186 --> 01:00:17,896
so they don't waste our money or do anything funny.

774
01:00:18,427 --> 01:00:19,657
They're all your enemies.

775
01:00:21,367 --> 01:00:24,796
You belittle all the board members and think they're our enemy.

776
01:00:25,796 --> 01:00:27,967
I didn't know it went with your motto, "Put talent first."

777
01:00:29,336 --> 01:00:31,307
So you have the nerve to talk back to your father.

778
01:00:31,307 --> 01:00:33,537
Why did you get all anxious because your wife went to Mueon?

779
01:00:39,847 --> 01:00:42,686
He was worried you packed up and left again using work as an excuse.

780
01:00:44,146 --> 01:00:45,316
You're too weak.

781
01:01:00,436 --> 01:01:01,606
Hello.

782
01:01:01,706 --> 01:01:02,807
The director's inside, right?

783
01:01:03,037 --> 01:01:04,336
Well, yes.

784
01:01:05,836 --> 01:01:06,876
Detective!

785
01:01:22,256 --> 01:01:25,226
How was the work trip? Was it fruitful?

786
01:01:27,327 --> 01:01:28,896
I am asking you if you've figured out who did it.

787
01:01:30,267 --> 01:01:32,037
Not yet.

788
01:01:32,497 --> 01:01:34,436
You said you'd reveal the real culprit on your show.

789
01:01:34,436 --> 01:01:35,666
It sounds like it'll take forever.

790
01:01:37,006 --> 01:01:38,476
I'll find the culprit as soon as possible.

791
01:01:45,347 --> 01:01:46,816
Detective Kim Tae Heon.

792
01:01:47,816 --> 01:01:48,816
Right?

793
01:01:50,546 --> 01:01:52,086
If you're not confident that you can find the culprit,

794
01:01:53,186 --> 01:01:54,387
create one.

795
01:02:28,126 --> 01:02:31,057
(Nothing Uncovered)

796
01:02:31,157 --> 01:02:33,197
I must be destroyed for you to be destroyed too, Father.

797
01:02:33,197 --> 01:02:35,327
Don't do anything to my wife.

798
01:02:35,526 --> 01:02:38,497
I emailed you the info you'd requested on Detective Kim Tae Heon.

799
01:02:38,867 --> 01:02:41,166
- Did something bad happen? - No.

800
01:02:41,237 --> 01:02:42,907
Hey, someone from the security office...

801
01:02:42,907 --> 01:02:44,577
filed a police report saying Kim Min Chul did it.

802
01:02:44,606 --> 01:02:46,307
Did you also kill Cha Eun Sae in the heat of the moment?

803
01:02:46,307 --> 01:02:48,376
No! Why would I kill Eun Sae?

804
01:02:48,376 --> 01:02:50,247
I loved her so much!

805
01:02:50,407 --> 01:02:51,847
Someone you know very well...

806
01:02:51,847 --> 01:02:53,816
has been arrested for the murder of Cha Eun Sae.

807
01:02:54,117 --> 01:02:56,247
Who? Don't tell me...

808
01:02:56,347 --> 01:02:58,487
Go home. It's an emergency situation, so I have to work.

809
01:02:58,557 --> 01:03:00,387
I suppose you'd need to meet the detective in charge.

810
01:03:00,487 --> 01:03:02,726
I know you're a reporter, but can you try to play it safe?

811
01:03:02,726 --> 01:03:05,197
I helped you. Why are you mad at me when you should be thanking me?

812
01:03:05,197 --> 01:03:07,226
You really don't know why I'm mad at you?

813
01:03:07,456 --> 01:03:08,666
What are you two doing here?

814
01:03:08,666 --> 01:03:11,137
- I'm covering the investigation... - Do you really have to do that...

815
01:03:12,166 --> 01:03:13,697
at your ex-boyfriend's place?
