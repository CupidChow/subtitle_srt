but why did you reveal what your father did as well?

89

For his sake, you could've concealed that he buried the body.

101
00:09:12,397 --> 00:09:15,587
Chairman Seol will use your mental health records...

102
00:09:16,307 --> 00:09:18,656
and drug use to render your statement inadmissible.

103

If what you say is true,

112

we'll find Chairman Seol's prints on this plastic bag,

113
00:10:44,996 --> 00:10:48,465
and if we compare the blood on the glass with Lee Na Ri's DNA...

114
00:10:48,466 --> 00:10:49,516
It'll confirm...

115
00:10:50,726 --> 00:10:51,847

Play it on TV.

184
00:16:00,606 --> 00:16:02,576
Say the late Seo Sang Gyeon took it,

185
00:16:02,577 --> 00:16:03,896
and that video...

186
00:16:05,147 --> 00:16:06,396
got him killed.

187
00:16:07,577 --> 00:16:09,497

Use the broadcast to get everyone...

191
00:16:24,226 --> 00:16:27,046
to focus on my father and me. That's the only way...

192
00:16:28,037 --> 00:16:30,386
to force a crack in my father's stronghold.

193
00:16:34,736 --> 00:16:36,296
I already resigned...

194
00:16:36,706 --> 00:16:37,975

195
00:16:37,976 --> 00:16:39,546

198
00:16:47,216 --> 00:16:48,906

200
00:17:06,307 --> 00:17:07,357
You must do it.

It's not just this.

203
00:17:21,787 --> 00:17:24,736
A piece of the broken headlight Chairman Seol had kept hidden.

204
00:17:25,957 --> 00:17:27,946
Woo Jae had taken and hid it.

205
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:31,226
If it's a piece of the headlight, the blood...

206
00:17:31,227 --> 00:17:32,916
Whether it's Lee Na Ri's,

207
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:35,865
and whether Chairman Seol's prints are on it.

208
00:17:35,866 --> 00:17:37,156
We're having it tested.

209
00:17:37,406 --> 00:17:39,027

Thanks.

211
00:17:46,376 --> 00:17:49,537
You once asked me something.

212
00:17:51,017 --> 00:17:52,736
What I think when I catch a culprit.

213
00:17:54,586 --> 00:17:56,136
Do you remember what I said?

214
00:17:56,686 --> 00:17:58,037
You said that you don't think.

215
00:17:59,057 --> 00:18:00,307
You just catch them.

216
00:18:00,497 --> 00:18:02,347

If the chairman's daughter-in-law were to release these,

247

Yes. You're attacking your husband and his father.

548
00:43:22,824 --> 00:43:24,674
- Tulip. - Tulip.

549
00:43:28,124 --> 00:43:30,084
Let's go get on a plane.

550
00:43:30,563 --> 00:43:31,613
Okay.

551
00:43:31,833 --> 00:43:32,883
Let's go.

552
00:43:37,534 --> 00:43:40,243
There's nothing to prove Gong Joon Ho...

553
00:43:40,244 --> 00:43:43,624
colluded with Seol Pan Ho in these charges.

554
00:43:44,043 --> 00:43:47,093
So we can't say the defendant's part...

555
00:43:47,483 --> 00:43:49,643
in the conspiracy of murder was proven...

556
00:43:49,644 --> 00:43:51,504
beyond a reasonable doubt.

557
00:43:52,414 --> 00:43:54,874
On the charge of conspiracy of murder,

558
00:43:54,983 --> 00:43:57,903
due to a lack of evidence, defendant Seol Pan Ho...

559
00:43:58,094 --> 00:44:00,062
is therefore found not guilty.

560
00:44:00,063 --> 00:44:01,414
(Judge)

561
00:44:08,364 --> 00:44:10,024
- What the heck? - Darn it.

562
00:44:16,874 --> 00:44:19,593
(Civil Affairs Office)

563
00:44:23,881 --> 00:44:26,632
(Civil Affairs Office)

564
00:44:30,181 --> 00:44:31,431
We're here.

565
00:44:35,392 --> 00:44:36,641
Here you go.

566
00:44:48,571 --> 00:44:51,751
Conspiracy to murder Seo Sang Gyeon. Not guilty.

567
00:44:54,172 --> 00:44:55,172
Darn it.

568
00:44:55,173 --> 00:44:57,910
He pulled all sorts of tricks to drag out the trial.

569
00:44:57,911 --> 00:44:59,231
Our country has a long way to go.

570
00:45:00,111 --> 00:45:02,351
Mo Hyung Taek and the truck accident.

571
00:45:02,352 --> 00:45:04,532
He was found guilty for influencing the investigation.

572
00:45:04,922 --> 00:45:07,702
I guess that's a small relief.

573
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:09,601
Thanks for updating me right away.

574
00:45:09,692 --> 00:45:12,141
It was just the first hearing. Don't be too disappointed.

575
00:45:12,221 --> 00:45:13,342
I won't.

576
00:45:46,062 --> 00:45:47,211
Father.

577
00:45:48,361 --> 00:45:51,612
You never sent me a reply,

578
00:45:52,431 --> 00:45:55,422
but so far, I'm not yet sick of writing.

579
00:45:56,571 --> 00:45:57,952
Forget being sick of it.

580
00:45:58,272 --> 00:46:00,661
I heard you were found not guilty in your first hearing.

581
00:46:01,411 --> 00:46:03,262
That jolted me awake.

582
00:46:08,911 --> 00:46:10,831
My time goes slowly,

583
00:46:11,221 --> 00:46:12,771
but Mi So's goes so fast.

584
00:46:13,922 --> 00:46:16,572
She learned more words and she's taller too.

585
00:46:19,922 --> 00:46:20,981
Father.

586
00:46:21,631 --> 00:46:23,382
My remaining goal in life...

587
00:46:24,161 --> 00:46:25,751
is to protect my daughter.

588
00:46:27,031 --> 00:46:28,981
I'll shield her from any sadness,

589
00:46:30,071 --> 00:46:32,052
and let her do anything she wants.

590
00:46:34,372 --> 00:46:37,632
I want only one thing from you.

591
00:46:40,812 --> 00:46:42,262
For you to confess the truth.

592
00:46:44,522 --> 00:46:46,532
I'll never give up, Father.

593
00:46:46,951 --> 00:46:49,242
I'll cling to you a countless number of times.

594
00:46:49,352 --> 00:46:50,442
So...

595
00:46:51,091 --> 00:46:52,342
You have a visitor.

596
00:47:09,642 --> 00:47:10,731
Hi, Mi So.

597
00:47:12,241 --> 00:47:13,561
- Mom, look. - Yes.

598
00:47:14,551 --> 00:47:16,101
Mi So, you've grown a lot.

599
00:47:18,381 --> 00:47:19,632
Can I hold Mi So?

600
00:47:21,321 --> 00:47:22,402
Come here, Mi So.

601
00:47:23,122 --> 00:47:25,541
My gosh. You're heavy now.

602
00:47:27,832 --> 00:47:28,981
How have you been?

603
00:47:33,201 --> 00:47:34,552
What is this, Mi So?

604
00:47:35,732 --> 00:47:37,351
It's for you, Dad.

605
00:47:37,602 --> 00:47:38,722
Really?

606
00:47:39,241 --> 00:47:40,992
You brought me a flower?

607
00:47:41,741 --> 00:47:42,961
Thanks.

608
00:47:50,011 --> 00:47:53,802
I heard what happened at my father's first hearing.

609
00:47:55,692 --> 00:47:56,811
I'm really sorry.

610
00:47:57,122 --> 00:47:58,742
I know you did your best.

611
00:48:00,761 --> 00:48:05,001
You're serving your sentence, so only feel guilty for what you did.

612
00:48:05,002 --> 00:48:06,612
You don't need to feel guilty for what he did.

613
00:48:07,872 --> 00:48:09,081
All right, I won't.

614
00:48:10,741 --> 00:48:13,862
This isn't a nice place. Thanks for bringing Mi So here.

615
00:48:15,872 --> 00:48:18,032
I know this must be a hassle for you,

616
00:48:18,681 --> 00:48:20,961
but I can't tell you to stop visiting me, so I'm sorry.

617
00:48:21,911 --> 00:48:25,172
It means a world to me to be able to see Mi So like this.

618
00:48:28,821 --> 00:48:29,902
I hope you understand.

619
00:48:33,792 --> 00:48:36,260
Mi So, when I get out of here,

620
00:48:36,261 --> 00:48:39,561
let's go see some flowers together, holding hands like this.

621
00:48:39,562 --> 00:48:41,552
We'll go to the zoo too.

622
00:48:42,332 --> 00:48:45,322
Let's go to the theme park too, okay? Promise.

623
00:48:45,801 --> 00:48:48,291
Promise. Promise sealed.

00:48:57,681 --> 00:49:02,720
(Civil Affairs Office)

625
00:49:02,721 --> 00:49:04,072
Let's go eat something.

(Chief Kang In Han)

627
00:49:09,091 --> 00:49:11,251
- Yes. - I saw your embezzlement report.

628
00:49:11,661 --> 00:49:12,782
Are you at the office now?

629
00:49:14,031 --> 00:49:15,481
I'm actually in Seoul now.

630
00:49:15,531 --> 00:49:17,251
Really? Where are you?

631
00:49:17,341 --> 00:49:18,992
We should meet up if you're here.

632
00:49:27,652 --> 00:49:30,472
You're working while raising your child alone. Isn't it too much?

633
00:49:30,821 --> 00:49:34,742
You said your ex-husband transferred all of his shares to your daughter.

634
00:49:35,122 --> 00:49:37,760
So why are you even working?

635
00:49:37,761 --> 00:49:38,761
I guess I was born to work.

636
00:49:38,762 --> 00:49:41,811
If I were you, I'd spend money left and right and never work.

637
00:49:42,161 --> 00:49:43,681
What's so great about working as a reporter?

638
00:49:47,232 --> 00:49:50,251
Anyway, I've been promoted to director.

639
00:49:50,642 --> 00:49:51,751
Congratulations.

640
00:49:51,971 --> 00:49:54,722
Then I should call you Director Kang from now on.

641
00:49:57,712 --> 00:50:01,501
Since I got promoted, I have to produce visible results right away.

642
00:50:02,881 --> 00:50:05,902
I plan to bring back "Nothing Uncovered."

643
00:50:07,491 --> 00:50:08,751
The show should be forgotten by now,

644
00:50:08,752 --> 00:50:11,041
but the viewers keep requesting that we bring it back.

645
00:50:11,091 --> 00:50:12,220
It's her, isn't it?

646
00:50:12,221 --> 00:50:15,130
See? All the customers here know who you are.

647
00:50:15,131 --> 00:50:16,311
They're whispering among themselves.

648
00:50:17,502 --> 00:50:19,530
- My gosh. - It's her.

649
00:50:19,531 --> 00:50:21,452
- Why is she here? - What's she doing here?

650
00:50:21,571 --> 00:50:23,401
It's about time you moved back to Seoul.

651
00:50:23,402 --> 00:50:24,970
Come back and work on the show.

652
00:50:24,971 --> 00:50:27,222
Don't let someone steal your show from you.

653
00:50:27,942 --> 00:50:30,171
I've been asking you to come back every year,

654
00:50:30,172 --> 00:50:31,461
so this is the third time.

655
00:50:31,812 --> 00:50:34,931
You've turned it down every time. Don't you feel bad?

656
00:50:37,051 --> 00:50:38,302
I'll think about it.

657
00:50:39,551 --> 00:50:40,902
You're responding differently this year.

658
00:50:41,991 --> 00:50:44,811
Stop thinking and just listen to me.

659
00:51:12,752 --> 00:51:14,342
I read the article about the embezzlement scandal.

660
00:51:14,551 --> 00:51:16,121
You're so cool, Seo Jung Won.

661
00:51:16,122 --> 00:51:18,711
I hear it's been raining a lot in Jeju. You're keeping well, right?

662
00:51:19,821 --> 00:51:21,181
I caught a wanted criminal.

663
00:51:21,292 --> 00:51:22,961
I want to lie that I got hurt...

664
00:51:22,962 --> 00:51:24,282
so you'd call me.

665
00:51:26,161 --> 00:51:28,681
It's gotten quite cold. Make sure you bundle up.

666
00:51:29,332 --> 00:51:30,791
Merry Christmas.

667
00:51:31,341 --> 00:51:32,692
Happy New Year.

668
00:51:33,172 --> 00:51:35,362
Hey, Seo Jung Won. You're keeping well, right?

669
00:51:36,142 --> 00:51:39,192
I feel like the new year just began, but January has come to an end.

670
00:51:39,482 --> 00:51:40,510
Time really flies.

671
00:51:40,511 --> 00:51:41,731
I got promoted.

672
00:51:42,212 --> 00:51:45,271
I kept saying it was hot, and flowers are blooming in February.

673
00:51:45,451 --> 00:51:47,342
Spring really is here, Jung Won.

674
00:51:47,721 --> 00:51:49,291
It's such a gloomy day today.

675
00:51:49,292 --> 00:51:50,572
Detective Oh had his fourth child.

676
00:51:51,261 --> 00:51:52,720
I've been reading...

677
00:51:52,721 --> 00:51:54,630
the books you recommended in the past.

678
00:51:54,631 --> 00:51:56,380
(May 2, 2027)

679
00:52:00,531 --> 00:52:02,646
(Detective Kim Tae Heon)

680
00:52:03,272 --> 00:52:05,492
I'm at the camping ground where we came together in the past.

681
00:52:07,341 --> 00:52:08,461
I miss you.

682
00:52:14,084 --> 00:52:15,284
(I'm at the camping ground where we came together in the past.)

683
00:52:15,285 --> 00:52:16,335
(I miss you.)

684
00:52:18,955 --> 00:52:21,514
(I miss you.)

685
00:53:03,435 --> 00:53:04,554
That jerk!

686
00:53:07,444 --> 00:53:08,525
Drop the knife.

687
00:53:09,705 --> 00:53:11,165
Hey!

688
00:53:12,475 --> 00:53:13,665
Drop the knife.

689
00:53:17,955 --> 00:53:19,204
You're on drugs, aren't you?

690
00:53:21,754 --> 00:53:22,904
Drop the knife.

691
00:53:25,754 --> 00:53:27,215
I told you to drop the knife.

692
00:54:09,205 --> 00:54:10,255
Hey, Jung Won.

693
00:54:12,305 --> 00:54:15,273
You still have that determined look in your eyes!

694
00:54:15,274 --> 00:54:17,091
My gosh. He's right.

695
00:54:17,115 --> 00:54:18,914
You still look like the veteran host of "Nothing Uncovered."

696
00:54:18,915 --> 00:54:21,284
It's nice to hear that nickname. It's been so long.

697
00:54:21,285 --> 00:54:24,653
My goodness. Hey, it has been a while indeed.

698
00:54:24,654 --> 00:54:25,914
Aren't you happy to see us?

699
00:54:25,915 --> 00:54:28,253
Also, you should've come straight to the office.

700
00:54:28,254 --> 00:54:29,523
Is this studio your number one priority?

701
00:54:29,524 --> 00:54:31,554
Look at you trying to pick a fight again.

702
00:54:31,555 --> 00:54:35,094
"I'm happy to see you again." Will you get in trouble...

703
00:54:35,095 --> 00:54:36,394
for being honest or something?

704
00:54:36,395 --> 00:54:37,844
No, I won't get in trouble.

705
00:54:38,365 --> 00:54:41,485
I mean, I am happy. But if I change suddenly,

706
00:54:41,935 --> 00:54:43,664
it's not a good sign.

707
00:54:43,665 --> 00:54:45,704
Also, Chief Kang.

708
00:54:45,705 --> 00:54:47,874
I mean, Director Kang. You saw him too.

709
00:54:47,875 --> 00:54:50,813
He's trying to look all serious when he can't even pull it off.

710
00:54:50,814 --> 00:54:51,925
When you see him,

711
00:54:52,575 --> 00:54:54,594
- you can't help but cringe. - He's right.

712
00:54:55,214 --> 00:54:58,434
Now that he's a director, he always talks in a serious voice.

713
00:54:58,814 --> 00:55:00,505
- I can't take it. - I can't either.

714
00:55:02,354 --> 00:55:03,653
Oh, we have the meeting.

715
00:55:03,654 --> 00:55:05,344
- Let's go. - Let's go. Come on.

716
00:55:06,294 --> 00:55:08,775
Does Detective Kim know that you're in Seoul now?

717
00:55:11,734 --> 00:55:13,534
Once we announce that we're bringing the show back,

718
00:55:13,535 --> 00:55:14,954
he will find out.

719
00:55:15,665 --> 00:55:17,454
Shouldn't you tell him yourself?

720
00:55:26,515 --> 00:55:29,235
I knew this day would come eventually,

721
00:55:29,645 --> 00:55:34,074
but it took longer than I had expected.

722
00:55:36,125 --> 00:55:37,244
What?

723
00:55:37,995 --> 00:55:39,045
It's nothing.

724
00:55:40,665 --> 00:55:44,193
Let's all pour our hearts and souls into it...

725
00:55:44,194 --> 00:55:46,315
and make sure the first episode is a hit.

726
00:55:46,964 --> 00:55:51,534
I hope we can choose an issue people are most interested in these days.

727
00:55:51,535 --> 00:55:54,554
Random killing sprees? Something like that?

728
00:55:56,544 --> 00:55:59,165
Abnormal motive crimes are on the rise.

729
00:55:59,415 --> 00:56:02,543
When did the stabbing spree at Dongsin Station take place?

730
00:56:02,544 --> 00:56:03,795
Right. One moment, please.

731
00:56:06,115 --> 00:56:09,434
My gosh. Another stabbing spree took place in Gwangho-dong.

732
00:56:10,924 --> 00:56:11,974
What?

733
00:56:12,294 --> 00:56:14,124
A detective from Gangha Police's Violent Crimes Unit One...

734
00:56:14,125 --> 00:56:15,614
is critically injured.

735
00:56:16,464 --> 00:56:17,585
Hold on.

736
00:56:18,134 --> 00:56:19,534
Could it be Detective Kim Tae Heon?

737
00:56:19,535 --> 00:56:20,468
(A detective from Violent Crimes Unit 1 is critically injured...)

738
00:56:26,404 --> 00:56:27,494
Hey.

739
00:56:39,615 --> 00:56:41,204
(Emergency Medical Center)

740
00:56:56,734 --> 00:56:57,734
What happened?

741
00:56:57,735 --> 00:56:59,684
- A car accident. - His vitals?

742
00:56:59,805 --> 00:57:01,103
It was 100 over 40.

743
00:57:01,104 --> 00:57:02,425
- What? - He was in a car accident!

744
00:57:03,274 --> 00:57:04,364
Coming through!

745
00:57:08,115 --> 00:57:09,195
Seo Jung Won?

746
00:57:11,314 --> 00:57:12,404
Jung Won.

747
00:57:35,345 --> 00:57:36,425
How...

748
00:57:37,615 --> 00:57:39,295
When did you arrive in Seoul?

749
00:57:40,375 --> 00:57:41,965
I heard a detective...

750
00:57:43,115 --> 00:57:44,434
from Gangha Police's Violent Crimes Unit One...

751
00:57:45,314 --> 00:57:47,165
sustained a critical injury...

752
00:57:48,955 --> 00:57:50,304
while quelling a stabbing spree.

753
00:57:52,725 --> 00:57:54,844
They misreported.

754
00:57:55,424 --> 00:57:56,574
As you can see now,

755
00:57:57,665 --> 00:57:59,215
I'm okay.

756
00:58:05,004 --> 00:58:06,673
A while back, you threatened me...

757
00:58:06,674 --> 00:58:08,525
never to die before you.

758
00:58:10,714 --> 00:58:12,065
I won't die.

759
00:58:13,015 --> 00:58:14,735
I can't die because I can't leave you behind all alone.

760
00:58:18,154 --> 00:58:19,204
Look at me.

761
00:58:20,015 --> 00:58:21,074
Hey, look at me.

762
00:58:22,754 --> 00:58:24,431
Why are you crying?

763
00:58:24,455 --> 00:58:25,545
Don't cry.

764
00:58:34,734 --> 00:58:36,054
I want to give you a hug right now,

765
00:58:37,535 --> 00:58:39,355
but I can't because of this crutch.

766
00:58:42,645 --> 00:58:44,054
Don't cry. I'm okay.

767
00:58:47,645 --> 00:58:48,795
Were you worried about me?

768
00:59:07,765 --> 00:59:09,154
What's wrong? Are you all right?

769
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:12,025
Hand it over.

770
00:59:17,245 --> 00:59:18,295
There.

771
00:59:39,694 --> 00:59:40,744
Jung Won.

772
00:59:41,365 --> 00:59:42,415
What?

773
00:59:49,944 --> 00:59:51,165
Don't you think things will work out between us?

774
01:00:01,225 --> 01:00:02,275
Gosh, what's wrong?

775
01:00:02,484 --> 01:00:04,074
- Be careful. - I'm fine.

776
01:00:12,694 --> 01:00:15,715
(Thank you for watching "Nothing Uncovered.")

777
01:00:17,904 --> 01:00:19,925
