Can't I go public with it through the show?

107

117

118
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:34,189
So you're not having an affair?

119
00:07:35,559 --> 00:07:37,289
Then why can't you tell your husband it's not true?

120

133
00:08:33,209 --> 00:08:37,688

137
00:08:50,298 --> 00:08:51,969

Can you tell me if these were Photoshopped or retouched?

146
00:09:24,129 --> 00:09:27,699
It looks like it was taken from inside the room.

147

If they weren't Photoshopped,

148
00:09:31,808 --> 00:09:32,908
they're from a hidden camera.

149

That's why I need them analyzed.

150
00:09:37,609 --> 00:09:40,208
You said it's an unofficial request, which means...

151

you didn't show these photos to the police experts.

She asked me not to have any feelings for her.

184
00:12:09,058 --> 00:12:10,329
But I couldn't do that.

185
00:12:12,668 --> 00:12:16,038
I clung to her and I kept hitting on her.

186
00:12:18,869 --> 00:12:20,239
Have Jung Won...

187
00:12:22,278 --> 00:12:23,908
get a restraining order against me.

188
00:12:25,849 --> 00:12:27,479
That will clear her name.

189
00:12:29,349 --> 00:12:30,449
You scumbag.

190
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:32,548
Do you mean that?

191
00:12:33,489 --> 00:12:35,459
I'm a shameless fool who coveted a married woman.

192
00:12:38,489 --> 00:12:39,558
I should pay for it.

193

(Reporter No Ji Ho)

194
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:04,349
It's Seol Woo Jae.

195
00:13:05,788 --> 00:13:07,788
I'd like to explain things...

196
00:13:08,819 --> 00:13:09,859
in an interview.

197
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:16,319
I couldn't control Ji Ho and the article got published.

198
00:14:17,158 --> 00:14:18,229
It was my fault.

199
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:22,229
We were photographed because I couldn't control myself.

200
00:14:24,229 --> 00:14:25,329
It was my fault.

201
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:34,579
Did you come here to apologize?

202
00:14:38,648 --> 00:14:40,778
My necklace that you found at Cha Eun Sae's scene.

203
00:14:42,949 --> 00:14:44,489
I know who put it there.

204
00:14:45,788 --> 00:14:46,819
Yoo Yoon Young?

205
00:14:49,418 --> 00:14:51,787
She left your necklace at the scene...

206
00:14:51,788 --> 00:14:54,228
but has a confirmed alibi. That means...

207
00:14:54,229 --> 00:14:55,359
She either has an accomplice...

208
00:14:55,928 --> 00:14:57,598
or hired someone to kill her.

209
00:14:57,599 --> 00:14:59,427
If you're right, a hitman...

210
00:14:59,428 --> 00:15:01,438
or someone close murdered her.

211
00:15:02,298 --> 00:15:05,238
One person committed three murders, and if that were Yoo Yoon Young,

212
00:15:05,239 --> 00:15:08,239
and she hired a hitman three times, that would be just too risky.

213
00:15:08,739 --> 00:15:12,278
Plus, she was just 19 at the time the factory burned down.

214
00:15:15,778 --> 00:15:16,778
You're right.

215
00:15:18,349 --> 00:15:21,089
My husband would be the person closest to her.

216
00:15:22,119 --> 00:15:23,418
He has an alibi.

217
00:15:24,058 --> 00:15:27,058
Her clinic's registered in someone else's name. Mo Soo Rin.

218
00:15:27,589 --> 00:15:29,298
I looked her up.

219
00:15:29,859 --> 00:15:31,329
She's Mo Hyung Taek's daughter.

220
00:15:32,268 --> 00:15:34,469
- Could it be... - What is it?

221
00:15:36,668 --> 00:15:37,668
Never mind.

222
00:15:38,469 --> 00:15:40,308
I'll tell you when I'm sure.

223
00:15:54,688 --> 00:15:55,758
- Jung Won. - Tae Heon.

224
00:16:00,658 --> 00:16:01,729
There's something...

225
00:16:05,168 --> 00:16:06,798
I lied to you about.

226
00:16:10,768 --> 00:16:11,938
I'll do...

227
00:16:13,069 --> 00:16:15,479
whatever it takes to expose Yoo Yoon Young on air.

228
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:18,079
I'll explain everything myself.

229
00:16:19,908 --> 00:16:21,178
Bear with me.

(Seol Denies Affair Rumor, "Will Get Restraining Order")

232
00:17:08,728 --> 00:17:10,398
What restraining order?

233
00:17:11,398 --> 00:17:12,428
That's stupid.

234
00:17:14,269 --> 00:17:15,638
It was my idea.

235
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:19,769
I'll handle them.

236
00:17:20,968 --> 00:17:22,208
Just don't get hurt.

237
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:50,839
Let's stay like this...

238
00:17:52,809 --> 00:17:54,109
for just a minute.

239
00:17:57,379 --> 00:17:58,579
Let me do this...

240
00:17:59,648 --> 00:18:00,809
for just one minute.

241
00:18:05,549 --> 00:18:07,119
I was furious when I saw the article.

242
00:18:07,688 --> 00:18:09,559
If I'd actually had an affair,

243
00:18:10,619 --> 00:18:12,129
I wouldn't feel bad at least.

244
00:18:17,329 --> 00:18:19,468
I hate that I can't control myself.

245
00:18:20,698 --> 00:18:21,998
I hate that...

246
00:18:24,438 --> 00:18:25,569
this could hurt you.

247
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:39,549
I've been suppressing my feelings all this time.

248
00:18:41,859 --> 00:18:43,119
I've tried with every ounce of my will...

249
00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:46,658
to push these feelings away.

250
00:19:37,879 --> 00:19:39,148
Give me a minute too.

251
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:33,829
Considering how you took my stuff without my permission,

252
00:20:34,869 --> 00:20:36,237
you know this is a small price you're paying.

253
00:20:36,238 --> 00:20:38,438
- Why did you do it? - I want to ask you the same thing.

254
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:43,339
Why did you kill Cha Eun Sae?

255
00:20:45,748 --> 00:20:47,609
Why did you commit such an act?

256
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:50,448
After killing Cha Eun Sae,

257
00:20:51,849 --> 00:20:53,418
you framed Jung Won as the culprit.

258
00:20:53,888 --> 00:20:55,418
Is sending her to prison your goal?

259
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:57,059
My goal...

260
00:20:58,388 --> 00:20:59,388
is you.

261
00:20:59,988 --> 00:21:01,157
Because you know you can't win my love,

262
00:21:01,158 --> 00:21:03,728
are you trying to win my hatred?

263
00:21:05,069 --> 00:21:06,698
Is that the kind of love you want?

264
00:21:13,069 --> 00:21:15,238
What you're doing isn't love. You just want to take me from her...

265
00:21:16,009 --> 00:21:17,279
because I was never yours.

266
00:21:17,938 --> 00:21:20,447
Education, career, money, and friends. You've got...

267
00:21:20,448 --> 00:21:21,647
everything you ever wanted.

268
00:21:21,648 --> 00:21:22,819
But I was the only thing you couldn't have.

269
00:21:24,648 --> 00:21:27,748
Despite that, we've known each other for a long time.

270
00:21:28,089 --> 00:21:29,217
You were a bit too much,

271
00:21:29,218 --> 00:21:31,289
but I never thought deep down, your nature wasn't evil.

272
00:21:31,388 --> 00:21:34,589
I had no idea how broken you were.

273
00:21:39,898 --> 00:21:41,637
You felt insecure because I never liked you back,

274
00:21:41,638 --> 00:21:43,138
so you committed murder.

275
00:21:44,938 --> 00:21:46,509
I didn't know you were such a monster.

276
00:21:51,438 --> 00:21:52,908
You're calling me a monster?

277
00:21:55,178 --> 00:21:57,279
I wonder if you have the right to call me a monster.

278
00:22:00,349 --> 00:22:01,589
Do you think I'm clueless about you?

279
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:03,359
I know everything.

280
00:22:03,619 --> 00:22:05,728
Like what you've done.

281
00:22:06,859 --> 00:22:07,958
What do you mean?

282
00:22:09,259 --> 00:22:10,298
Don't talk to me in code.

283
00:22:10,299 --> 00:22:11,698
I'm sure you understood me.

284
00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:14,129
Must I really spell it out for you?

285
00:22:20,738 --> 00:22:21,809
Don't worry.

286
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:25,379
Because I'm going to protect you.

287
00:22:59,966 --> 00:23:02,665
I read your interview with Mr. No in his article.

288
00:23:05,006 --> 00:23:06,536
I didn't get much sleep last night.

289
00:23:07,635 --> 00:23:08,976
Let's talk about this later.

290
00:23:09,605 --> 00:23:10,605
Woo Jae.

291
00:23:19,216 --> 00:23:20,486
I need to talk to you.

292
00:23:20,716 --> 00:23:22,086
I know you didn't cheat on me.

293
00:23:23,016 --> 00:23:24,355
Kim Tae Heon told me that.

294
00:23:25,155 --> 00:23:26,286
You told him...

295
00:23:26,586 --> 00:23:28,625
not to have any feelings toward you.

296
00:23:32,826 --> 00:23:34,566
But the truth is that you were tempted to have an affair.

297
00:23:35,766 --> 00:23:37,095
That's what you wanted to say, right?

298
00:23:38,266 --> 00:23:39,566
That's why you pushed him away, right?

299
00:23:43,506 --> 00:23:44,806
It's completely understandable.

300
00:23:46,905 --> 00:23:48,674
You guys dated before you and I met.

301
00:23:48,675 --> 00:23:50,445
And I ended up hurting you.

302
00:23:51,716 --> 00:23:53,316
If he was determined to seduce you,

303
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:56,216
feeling tempted would be natural. Of course.

304
00:24:03,056 --> 00:24:04,296
I would have deserved that too.

305
00:24:05,796 --> 00:24:06,826
It's okay.

306
00:24:08,996 --> 00:24:10,066
No.

307
00:24:12,966 --> 00:24:14,665
To be honest, it's not okay.

308
00:24:17,236 --> 00:24:18,405
But I'll accept it.

309
00:24:20,306 --> 00:24:21,645
It's all my fault.

310
00:24:23,316 --> 00:24:24,316
And...

311
00:24:25,746 --> 00:24:26,786
thank you...

312
00:24:28,246 --> 00:24:29,486
for not caving into the temptation.

313
00:24:31,786 --> 00:24:32,986
That's not true.

314
00:24:37,756 --> 00:24:39,026
I tried not to cave in,

315
00:24:40,365 --> 00:24:41,796
but I couldn't.

316
00:24:43,536 --> 00:24:44,566
I...

317
00:24:52,875 --> 00:24:53,945
Don't say it.

318
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:59,185
Don't say anything. Not a word.

319
00:25:06,355 --> 00:25:07,625
Don't cry.

320
00:25:09,455 --> 00:25:10,995
You're not sad because of me.

321
00:25:10,996 --> 00:25:12,865
You're sad because of that jerk!

322
00:25:15,266 --> 00:25:16,296
I...

323
00:25:17,966 --> 00:25:19,236
like him.

324
00:25:30,576 --> 00:25:31,746
You are...

325
00:25:34,185 --> 00:25:35,316
so cruel.

326
00:25:37,115 --> 00:25:39,086
When I found out that you had an affair with Cha Eun Sae,

327
00:25:41,286 --> 00:25:43,056
if you hadn't lied to me,

328
00:25:44,326 --> 00:25:45,665
it would have hurt me less.

329
00:25:47,226 --> 00:25:48,296
So...

330
00:25:49,395 --> 00:25:50,934
I'm telling you the truth.

331
00:25:50,935 --> 00:25:51,935
No.

332
00:25:53,365 --> 00:25:56,506
I want you to lie to me. I don't need your honesty.

333
00:26:03,516 --> 00:26:04,776
Please, Jung Won.

334
00:26:06,486 --> 00:26:07,685
Tell me it's not true.

335
00:26:09,385 --> 00:26:10,786
I'm begging you.

336
00:26:11,986 --> 00:26:13,026
Please?

337
00:26:16,095 --> 00:26:17,125
I expressed...

338
00:26:18,695 --> 00:26:20,326
my feelings to him.

339
00:26:22,066 --> 00:26:23,395
I can't go back to how it was before.

340
00:26:26,036 --> 00:26:27,066
I'm sorry.

How dare you show up here?

345
00:27:29,895 --> 00:27:31,635
Get lost before I kill you.

346
00:27:34,665 --> 00:27:36,976
Yoo Yoon Young gave me some pictures yesterday.

347
00:27:38,135 --> 00:27:40,205
They were photos of Jung Won next to Cha Eun Sae's dead body...

348
00:27:40,976 --> 00:27:43,576
in Unit 1401 of Leaders Palace.

349
00:27:47,316 --> 00:27:50,756
- That means... - Jung Won was at the scene.

350
00:27:52,486 --> 00:27:54,326
There's no way Jung Won killed her. I'm sure of it.

351
00:27:55,895 --> 00:27:58,095
She probably saw the body and ran out.

352
00:27:58,526 --> 00:28:00,496
Those photos actually confirm...

353
00:28:01,266 --> 00:28:03,694
that hidden cameras were set up in advance...

354
00:28:03,695 --> 00:28:05,505
and that Jung Won was lured to the scene...

355
00:28:05,506 --> 00:28:07,336
because of the text message with the wrong address.

356
00:28:07,865 --> 00:28:10,174
Then Jung Won's necklace was left in Cha Eun Sae's hand.

357
00:28:10,175 --> 00:28:11,576
It was a premeditated murder.

358
00:28:18,445 --> 00:28:19,516
That said,

359
00:28:20,986 --> 00:28:23,586
you're the only one I can turn to right now,

360
00:28:25,855 --> 00:28:27,086
so help me.

361
00:28:40,536 --> 00:28:42,674
If Yoo Yoon Young planned everything,

362
00:28:42,675 --> 00:28:45,546
but if someone close to her committed the murder...

363
00:28:46,806 --> 00:28:49,375
And what if that was Mo Soo Rin?

364
00:29:01,455 --> 00:29:03,854

00:29:03,855 --> 00:29:06,395
decided to move into my husband's old studio space.

366
00:29:07,365 --> 00:29:08,935
Your employee told me...

367
00:29:09,036 --> 00:29:11,766
that you two were very close.

368
00:29:13,635 --> 00:29:16,405
Jung In, you should take a break and grab a bite to eat.

369
00:29:17,205 --> 00:29:18,276
Sure.

370
00:29:24,546 --> 00:29:25,645
I also know...

371
00:29:26,516 --> 00:29:29,785
that Ms. Yoo's clinic is in your name...

372
00:29:29,786 --> 00:29:31,414
and that the two of you were classmates...

373
00:29:31,415 --> 00:29:33,056
in your senior year of high school.

374
00:29:33,355 --> 00:29:34,556
My husband too.

375
00:29:36,056 --> 00:29:38,595
You look like you know everything too,

376
00:29:39,165 --> 00:29:40,996
including why I'm suddenly telling you all this.

377
00:29:46,635 --> 00:29:48,365
You know Ms. Yoo Yoon Young very well, right?

378
00:29:50,135 --> 00:29:53,444
My necklace was found at the scene of Cha Eun Sae's murder,

379
00:29:53,445 --> 00:29:57,445
but Ms. Yoo had that necklace. Did you know that?

380
00:29:59,716 --> 00:30:02,216
You must also know that she was at the scene too.

381
00:30:02,655 --> 00:30:03,756
You know everything,

382
00:30:04,455 --> 00:30:05,486
don't you?

383
00:30:05,986 --> 00:30:08,085
But Yoon Young has an alibi.

384
00:30:08,086 --> 00:30:10,556
An alibi? You mean, the video of the waiting room?

385
00:30:11,256 --> 00:30:13,364
They've concluded that it was manipulated.

386
00:30:13,365 --> 00:30:15,465
Pardon me? That can't be.

387
00:30:15,466 --> 00:30:19,236
Also, her fingerprints were found in the AC plant room...

388
00:30:19,466 --> 00:30:22,375
in Unit 1401 of Leaders Palace.

389
00:30:23,175 --> 00:30:25,475
It means she was hiding in the scene...

390
00:30:25,476 --> 00:30:28,776
the day Cha Eun Sae was killed.

391
00:30:30,516 --> 00:30:32,144
That room is tiny. No one can hide in there.

392
00:30:32,145 --> 00:30:33,945
And how do you know that?

393
00:30:38,286 --> 00:30:39,425
Tell me.

394
00:30:40,685 --> 00:30:43,756
How do you know the layout of Unit 1401 so well?

395
00:30:46,496 --> 00:30:48,066
I have nothing more to tell you.

396
00:30:48,766 --> 00:30:49,895
Please leave.

397
00:30:50,595 --> 00:30:52,336
- Ms. Mo. - I asked you to leave.

398
00:31:11,556 --> 00:31:13,226
(Cha Eun Sae, 3 months pregnant)

399
00:31:28,006 --> 00:31:30,975
- Hey. - The person who did the job.

400
00:31:30,976 --> 00:31:32,105
I think it was Mo Soo Rin.

401
00:31:32,476 --> 00:31:35,246
Mo Soo Rin? You mean, Mo Hyung Taek's daughter?

402
00:31:35,415 --> 00:31:38,114
Yes, I met her earlier in the day.

403
00:31:38,115 --> 00:31:40,945
She knows the layout of Unit 1401 like the back of her hand.

404
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:43,755
I'll send you what I jotted down on her relationship with Yoo...

405
00:31:43,756 --> 00:31:46,555
and the video of Yoo's last session with Cha Eun Sae.

406
00:31:46,556 --> 00:31:47,826
Go through them.

407
00:31:48,185 --> 00:31:49,195
All right.

(Went to Mueon High together)

410
00:31:56,266 --> 00:32:00,066
Yoo and Mo were classmates in their senior year of high school?

411
00:32:01,165 --> 00:32:03,236
The fire at the plant broke out in the same year.

412
00:32:09,316 --> 00:32:10,615
Hello, Detective Bong. It's me.

413
00:32:11,175 --> 00:32:12,644
The Bongto plant fire case.

414
00:32:12,645 --> 00:32:14,685
Who was in charge of the crime-scene investigation?

415
00:32:18,855 --> 00:32:20,556
Detective Bong briefly told me about the situation.

416
00:32:20,925 --> 00:32:23,195
That old case is suddenly getting all this attention.

417
00:32:23,625 --> 00:32:24,895
This feels weird.

418
00:32:25,256 --> 00:32:27,295
I went through all the case reports.

419
00:32:27,296 --> 00:32:30,295
Were any of the details from the ignition analysis...

420
00:32:30,296 --> 00:32:32,235
omitted or simply not reflected in the reports?

421
00:32:32,236 --> 00:32:34,565
We were sure of one ignition location at the scene.

422
00:32:34,566 --> 00:32:36,704
Another fire ignition location was suggested, so we analyzed it.

423
00:32:36,705 --> 00:32:38,435
The probability was about 60 percent.

424
00:32:39,145 --> 00:32:42,645
But at the time, Prosecutor Mo said it was irrelevant and covered it up,

425
00:32:42,716 --> 00:32:43,976
so we had to leave it out.

426
00:32:44,645 --> 00:32:46,615
So, Mo Hyung Taek forced you not to include it in the reports?

427
00:32:50,256 --> 00:32:51,256
It's odd.

428
00:32:53,355 --> 00:32:55,594
Politicians who took bribes in the past...

429
00:32:55,595 --> 00:32:57,095
have no problem making a comeback,

430
00:32:57,526 --> 00:32:59,966
but it's nearly impossible for reporters.

431
00:33:00,625 --> 00:33:03,665
I guess that could be why...

432
00:33:04,635 --> 00:33:08,366
you're still bending over backwards for me to this day.

433
00:33:14,506 --> 00:33:17,816
I hear she still doesn't know her place and insists on doing the show.

434
00:33:18,546 --> 00:33:19,745
We will have no problems, right?

435
00:33:19,886 --> 00:33:22,216
It was scheduled for next week but has been canceled altogether.

436
00:33:22,816 --> 00:33:23,955
She can't do it.

437
00:33:28,825 --> 00:33:29,926
Good work.

438
00:33:47,745 --> 00:33:51,145

440
00:34:13,665 --> 00:34:16,075
They're photos from Mo Soo Rin's phone.

441
00:34:27,745 --> 00:34:30,616
These photos are from Mo Hyung Taek's daughter's phone?

442
00:34:32,116 --> 00:34:36,096
The show got canceled altogether because you keep digging like this.

443
00:34:36,855 --> 00:34:39,196
So, you're saying Mo Hyung Taek pulled some strings, right?

444
00:34:40,066 --> 00:34:41,425
Will you keep letting the higher-ups...

445
00:34:41,426 --> 00:34:44,165
drag you around when you're the head of the department?

446
00:34:45,066 --> 00:34:46,735
When you were at Mueon KBM,

447
00:34:46,736 --> 00:34:48,165
you took bribes from Prosecutor Mo...

448
00:34:49,006 --> 00:34:50,406
and worked for him, didn't you?

449
00:34:53,575 --> 00:34:55,645
Well, that's right. I did.

450
00:34:56,946 --> 00:34:59,284
But I got chewed out by a senior colleague who was just like you...

451
00:34:59,285 --> 00:35:00,316
and stopped doing it.

452
00:35:01,616 --> 00:35:04,116
That's right. It was Reporter Seo Sang Gyeon, your father.

453
00:35:04,915 --> 00:35:06,886
You're so persistent, just like his father.

454
00:35:09,156 --> 00:35:12,926
If people find out about it, my career is over.

455
00:35:19,236 --> 00:35:20,736
I get what you're saying.

456
00:35:25,645 --> 00:35:28,475
Swapping out one of the interviews on "News 9" was the only way.

457
00:35:29,446 --> 00:35:30,475
You only have three minutes.

458
00:36:02,006 --> 00:36:03,915
I got an interview on "News 9."

459
00:36:04,216 --> 00:36:07,346
I'll expose the suspect and the possibility of an accomplice.

460
00:36:08,046 --> 00:36:09,216
Once the interview airs,

461
00:36:09,415 --> 00:36:11,785
you'll have to question Yoo Yoon Young right away.

462
00:36:12,756 --> 00:36:16,225
- Can you do it? - Don't worry about that.

463
00:36:16,895 --> 00:36:19,394
But do you have evidence to back up that there might be an accomplice?

464
00:36:19,395 --> 00:36:20,765
Ba Reun sent me some evidence.

465
00:36:21,196 --> 00:36:24,096
You should comb through everything in that house too.

466
00:36:24,236 --> 00:36:27,304
Ba Reun was investigating Mo Hyung Taek and his family,

467
00:36:27,305 --> 00:36:28,835
so you might find something important.

468
00:36:28,836 --> 00:36:30,305
Yes, I'm combing through everything now.

469
00:36:34,575 --> 00:36:35,716
Good luck with the interview.

470
00:36:38,515 --> 00:36:39,546

to expose myself...

476
00:36:57,535 --> 00:36:59,366
for one last time.

477
00:37:01,265 --> 00:37:04,776
I told you not to even call Reporter Seo for the time being.

478
00:37:05,575 --> 00:37:07,305
You never listen to me.

479
00:37:07,776 --> 00:37:08,776
Shut it.

480
00:37:09,245 --> 00:37:10,975

of cultural events happening nationwide.

541
00:40:30,946 --> 00:40:32,716
- Please watch. - She was still talking.

542
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:55,205
You're going to arrest me for murdering Cha Eun Sae?

543
00:40:56,805 --> 00:40:58,335
Because of a photo of a necklace?

544
00:40:58,336 --> 00:41:00,546
You made illegal prescriptions for propofol.

545
00:41:01,645 --> 00:41:04,915
You're under arrest for breaking the Narcotics Control Act.

546
00:41:06,986 --> 00:41:08,915
You can keep quiet,

547
00:41:09,586 --> 00:41:13,184
and what you say can be used in court against you.

548
00:41:13,185 --> 00:41:14,555
You can hire a lawyer too.

549
00:41:17,426 --> 00:41:18,426
(Search and Seizure Warrant)

550
00:41:18,555 --> 00:41:21,596
We'll search your office and home and take everything that's relevant.

551
00:41:30,435 --> 00:41:32,375
(Interview with Reporter Seo Jung Won)

552
00:41:44,156 --> 00:41:45,316
Assemblyman Mo...

553
00:41:45,586 --> 00:41:48,125
instructed me to buy you a plane ticket to New York.

554
00:41:48,955 --> 00:41:51,125
Would 2pm suit you?

555
00:42:11,576 --> 00:42:13,786
You'll also pay the price for taking...

556
00:42:14,246 --> 00:42:15,487
illegally prescribed medication.

557
00:42:16,416 --> 00:42:19,056
I'm not stupid enough not to know that.

558
00:42:44,146 --> 00:42:47,516
This photo was on a flash drive that was in your possession.

559
00:42:48,186 --> 00:42:49,446
You took it, didn't you?

560
00:42:49,447 --> 00:42:50,956
Aren't I here...

561
00:42:52,056 --> 00:42:53,426
for writing illegal prescriptions?

562
00:42:53,427 --> 00:42:55,956
I care more about this case than that one.

563
00:42:57,496 --> 00:42:58,626
The day Cha was killed,

564
00:42:58,627 --> 00:43:01,326
did you go to Leaders Palace Unit 1401?

565
00:43:02,797 --> 00:43:04,337
- Yes. - At what time?

566
00:43:06,467 --> 00:43:07,637
Was it around 4pm?

567
00:43:08,137 --> 00:43:09,677
Seol Woo Jae was there too,

568
00:43:10,507 --> 00:43:11,837
so I didn't stay for long.

569
00:43:17,746 --> 00:43:19,146
Congratulations on becoming a dad.

570
00:43:20,047 --> 00:43:22,217
I'll retire and move abroad.

571
00:43:22,246 --> 00:43:23,515
(The day of Cha Eun Sae's murder)

572
00:43:23,516 --> 00:43:25,217
I'll wait until you get a divorce.

573
00:43:32,027 --> 00:43:33,096
Eun Sae.

574
00:43:35,527 --> 00:43:37,467
Did you think I wouldn't know...

575
00:43:38,467 --> 00:43:39,766
you're seeing other guys too?

576
00:43:40,607 --> 00:43:41,737
What do you mean?

577
00:43:52,877 --> 00:43:53,916
Sorry.

578
00:43:54,947 --> 00:43:56,817
I was hoping to have a coffee with you.

579
00:44:00,087 --> 00:44:02,157
You two seem to be talking. I'll come by another time.

580
00:44:03,726 --> 00:44:05,627
- See you later. - Okay.

581
00:44:08,027 --> 00:44:09,496
(Good luck, Eun Sae. Wish you only the best.)

582
00:44:18,837 --> 00:44:20,106
No, Woo Jae.

583
00:44:20,107 --> 00:44:22,346
The baby is yours. It is.

584
00:44:22,846 --> 00:44:23,947
It's yours.

585
00:44:24,116 --> 00:44:25,116
Is it?

586
00:44:26,016 --> 00:44:28,817
Even if you insist it is, our relationship ended long ago.

587
00:44:38,326 --> 00:44:39,866
I was with Cha Eun Sae that day,

588
00:44:40,396 --> 00:44:41,927
and Yoo Yoon Young did drop by.

589
00:44:42,266 --> 00:44:43,866
Then after 4pm,

590
00:44:44,297 --> 00:44:46,866
did you visit Unit 1401 again?

591
00:44:47,337 --> 00:44:49,676
- No. - Then how did...

592
00:44:49,677 --> 00:44:51,106
Seo's necklace that you had...

593
00:44:51,107 --> 00:44:52,877
end up in dead Cha's hand?

594
00:44:54,576 --> 00:44:56,317
According to Seol Woo Jae,

595
00:44:56,547 --> 00:44:59,447
you took the necklace that had been in his studio.

596
00:44:59,616 --> 00:45:02,646
I didn't take it. Woo Jae gave it to me.

597
00:45:04,016 --> 00:45:07,326
In return for not telling anyone about his affair with Cha.

598
00:45:09,826 --> 00:45:10,826
That's a lie.

599
00:45:11,396 --> 00:45:13,495
She did know about our affair,

600
00:45:13,496 --> 00:45:15,027
but she stole the necklace.

601
00:45:15,326 --> 00:45:18,166
When and how did you find out about Seol's affair?

602
00:45:20,607 --> 00:45:21,737
Early August, was it?

603
00:45:23,377 --> 00:45:25,377
Eun Sae told me during a session.

604
00:45:25,476 --> 00:45:27,177
After hearing about the affair,

605
00:45:27,306 --> 00:45:29,547
did you blackmail Seol Woo Jae?

606
00:45:31,377 --> 00:45:32,377
No.

607
00:45:33,516 --> 00:45:35,016
Why would I blackmail him?

608
00:45:35,717 --> 00:45:38,615
On hearing my wife couldn't sleep after finding Jin Myung Sook's body,

609
00:45:38,616 --> 00:45:40,927
she pressured me to bring Jung Won to see her.

610
00:45:41,056 --> 00:45:44,096
She said she'd go public about the affair if I didn't.

611
00:45:44,896 --> 00:45:46,526
I bet that's when...

612
00:45:46,527 --> 00:45:49,427
she started to form a plan to trap my wife.

613
00:45:50,467 --> 00:45:51,996
I just started questioning you,

614
00:45:52,837 --> 00:45:54,567
and you lied twice already.

615
00:46:06,587 --> 00:46:07,616
Yes.

616
00:46:08,087 --> 00:46:09,516
Just as you thought,

617
00:46:10,516 --> 00:46:12,857
Seol Woo Jae's watching in the next room.

618
00:46:14,286 --> 00:46:16,226
Since there's no point in lying now,

619
00:46:17,297 --> 00:46:18,826
how about I ask point blank?

620
00:46:19,927 --> 00:46:22,027
Why are you lying? What is it that you want to hide?

621
00:46:22,967 --> 00:46:25,096
Perhaps, your feelings toward Mr. Seol?

622
00:46:29,107 --> 00:46:31,936
How did you feel after finding out about his affair with Cha Eun Sae?

623
00:46:32,337 --> 00:46:34,506
The man you had a crush on for a long time...

624
00:46:34,507 --> 00:46:35,846
was involved with two women.

625
00:46:36,677 --> 00:46:38,845
"How come he liked Seo Jung Won and Cha Eun Sae, but not me?"

626
00:46:38,846 --> 00:46:41,547
Has this thought ever crossed your mind?

627
00:46:43,487 --> 00:46:45,386
You confessed your feelings to him 14 years ago,

628
00:46:45,387 --> 00:46:46,527
but he turned you down.

629
00:46:47,157 --> 00:46:48,657
Back then, he was dating...

630
00:46:50,657 --> 00:46:52,657
a girl named Lee Na Ri, not you.

631
00:47:01,467 --> 00:47:04,206
(14 years ago)

632
00:47:46,846 --> 00:47:47,947
You know what's interesting?

633
00:47:48,387 --> 00:47:50,156
There was the same signature from the culprit...

634
00:47:50,157 --> 00:47:52,387
at both of Lee Na Ri's and Cha Eun Sae's murder scenes.

635
00:47:52,616 --> 00:47:53,626
On top of that,

636
00:47:53,627 --> 00:47:54,785
it was also found at the murder scene...

637
00:47:54,786 --> 00:47:56,757
of Jin Myung Sook, Mo Hyung Taek's housekeeper.

638
00:47:58,226 --> 00:48:00,665
Aren't you curious about the signature...

639
00:48:00,666 --> 00:48:01,866
that was found at all three crime scenes?

640
00:48:02,226 --> 00:48:03,436
Are you going to tell me?

641
00:48:04,936 --> 00:48:07,205
Detective Kim, I have an alibi.

642
00:48:07,206 --> 00:48:08,337
Yes, you do.

643
00:48:09,306 --> 00:48:11,236
What if you were the mastermind behind the murders,

644
00:48:11,237 --> 00:48:13,136
and B, the individual Ms. Seo exposed in her interview,

645
00:48:13,137 --> 00:48:14,277
executed the deeds?

646
00:48:14,547 --> 00:48:16,306
So what if Mo Soo Rin committed the murders?

647
00:48:17,947 --> 00:48:20,046
Just like it was mentioned during the news, did you know...

648
00:48:20,047 --> 00:48:22,115
Mo Soo Rin had photos of Unit 1401 of Leaders Palace,

649
00:48:22,116 --> 00:48:24,456
the very place the murder took place?

650
00:48:25,556 --> 00:48:26,887
Even if those photos...

651
00:48:27,686 --> 00:48:29,757
were indeed from her phone,

652
00:48:30,556 --> 00:48:32,657
she was just one of my many patients.

653
00:48:34,226 --> 00:48:35,466
What do her photos have to do with me?

654
00:48:35,467 --> 00:48:36,936
She's more than just a patient.

655
00:48:37,536 --> 00:48:38,995
You two have known each other since high school senior year.

656
00:48:38,996 --> 00:48:40,866
You guys are quite close.

657
00:48:42,436 --> 00:48:44,705
Jin's murder, Cha's murder, and the fire at the factory.

658
00:48:44,706 --> 00:48:46,476
You guys conspired together to commit them, didn't you?

659
00:48:48,907 --> 00:48:50,916
On the grounds that we graduated from the same high school?

660
00:48:52,817 --> 00:48:54,216
Do you think your reasoning makes any sense?

661
00:48:54,217 --> 00:48:56,145
Here's what I heard from the leader of the forensic team,

662
00:48:56,146 --> 00:48:57,757
in charge of the fire incident at Bongto Factory.

663
00:48:57,956 --> 00:48:59,615
He included in his report the possibility...

664
00:48:59,616 --> 00:49:01,326
of the arsonist having an accomplice.

665
00:49:01,456 --> 00:49:03,226
But Then-Prosecutor Mo Hyung Taek buried it.

666
00:49:05,096 --> 00:49:06,226
Considering all the connections,

667
00:49:06,496 --> 00:49:08,495
You as well as Ms. Mo Soo Rin have something to do...

668
00:49:08,496 --> 00:49:10,396
with the three cases.

669
00:49:10,567 --> 00:49:12,197
Do you think this makes any sense?

670
00:49:16,407 --> 00:49:17,506
You put Seo Jung Won's necklace...

671
00:49:17,507 --> 00:49:19,137
in Cha Eun Sae's hand after she had been killed.

672
00:49:20,846 --> 00:49:21,877
Didn't you?

673
00:49:58,047 --> 00:49:59,277
Did she smile just now?

674
00:50:07,286 --> 00:50:08,986
- What? - Did you find anything useful?

675
00:50:08,987 --> 00:50:10,857
We're searching everything here.

676
00:50:11,326 --> 00:50:14,665
Yoo Yoon Young isn't even scared. She's completely unfazed.

677
00:50:14,666 --> 00:50:16,326
Bring me evidence that she instigated the murder.

678
00:50:16,567 --> 00:50:18,496
- We can't arrest her without that. - Got it.

679
00:50:21,536 --> 00:50:23,507
We need to find the evidence from the raid.

680
00:50:30,076 --> 00:50:31,346
Detective Kim.

681
00:50:33,246 --> 00:50:35,487
What happened to the photos I gave to you?

682
00:50:36,887 --> 00:50:39,555
Ms. Seo's photos taken next to the dead body...

683
00:50:39,556 --> 00:50:41,587
of Cha Eun Sae at the crime scene.

684
00:50:43,627 --> 00:50:46,297
What photos? What's she talking about?

685
00:50:48,967 --> 00:50:50,436
I'm conducting a thorough analysis on them.

686
00:50:52,967 --> 00:50:54,866
Because they could be manipulated or Photoshopped?

687
00:50:57,076 --> 00:50:58,177
I was worried for nothing.

688
00:50:58,877 --> 00:51:01,047
I read in an article that you had an affair with Ms. Seo.

689
00:51:01,806 --> 00:51:04,377
I was concerned that you might bury the evidence.

690
00:51:08,346 --> 00:51:11,116
You know, I've been thinking about those photos.

691
00:51:11,916 --> 00:51:13,586
Assuming that those are original copies,

692
00:51:13,587 --> 00:51:14,857
based on the angle of the camera,

693
00:51:15,527 --> 00:51:17,226
the photos were taken inside the unit.

694
00:51:17,797 --> 00:51:20,366
If there wasn't a third person at the scene,

695
00:51:21,427 --> 00:51:23,226
a spy cam must have filmed that.

696
00:51:23,896 --> 00:51:25,536
That's what you think too, right?

697
00:51:28,936 --> 00:51:30,036
Right.

698
00:51:31,036 --> 00:51:33,705
I kept a folder of Ms. Seo's therapy session videos...

699
00:51:33,706 --> 00:51:34,877
on my office computer.

700
00:51:35,706 --> 00:51:37,916
You should watch the video from the day of Cha's murder.

701
00:51:39,116 --> 00:51:41,616
There's blood on Ms. Seo's sleeves.

702
00:51:43,217 --> 00:51:46,556
In my opinion, that blood belonged to Cha Eun Sae.

703
00:51:50,826 --> 00:51:52,297
So...

704
00:51:52,556 --> 00:51:54,626
when I asked her if she still had the shirt at home,

705
00:51:54,627 --> 00:51:56,697
Woo Jae stepped in and said he threw it out.

706
00:52:00,806 --> 00:52:02,407
It means that...

707
00:52:03,237 --> 00:52:05,206
even her husband suspected her of being the murderer.

708
00:52:07,007 --> 00:52:08,576
You should ask Woo Jae...

709
00:52:11,576 --> 00:52:13,616
if he indeed threw it out.

710
00:52:29,096 --> 00:52:31,396
If you're done questioning me, you should release me.

711
00:52:31,866 --> 00:52:34,237
You were going to question me on suspicion of the murder.

712
00:52:34,637 --> 00:52:37,007
But seeing how you arrested me for writing illegal prescriptions,

713
00:52:37,737 --> 00:52:39,076
there's no smoking gun.

714
00:52:39,137 --> 00:52:40,907
I will find that smoking gun soon.

715
00:52:41,777 --> 00:52:42,906
More than anything,

716
00:52:42,907 --> 00:52:45,047
I can clearly prove that you wrote illegal prescriptions.

717
00:52:45,576 --> 00:52:47,016
So you won't be getting released.

718
00:52:49,286 --> 00:52:50,516
You know what?

719
00:52:51,456 --> 00:52:54,326
Woo Jae is falsely accusing me. His accusation is one-sided.

720
00:52:55,056 --> 00:52:56,587
I expected this. You know?

721
00:52:57,127 --> 00:52:59,395
I knew Woo Jae would report me for writing illegal prescriptions...

722
00:52:59,396 --> 00:53:01,626
and you would try to frame me as the accomplice...

723
00:53:01,627 --> 00:53:03,567
with Ms. Seo's necklace.

724
00:53:09,637 --> 00:53:11,806
You can raid my place all you want.

725
00:53:12,976 --> 00:53:14,646
But you won't find anything.

726
00:53:34,896 --> 00:53:35,967
What do we do?

727
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:37,797
You didn't get anything at all?

728
00:53:37,896 --> 00:53:39,665
There's no evidence that she issued unlawful prescriptions.

729
00:53:39,666 --> 00:53:41,035
I didn't find any leads that...

730
00:53:41,036 --> 00:53:42,436
could prove she instigated the murder or was an accomplice.

731
00:53:42,637 --> 00:53:43,837
It was squeaky clean.

732
00:53:45,036 --> 00:53:47,306
- There weren't any spy cams either? - No.

733
00:53:49,646 --> 00:53:51,777
I thought we would find something from the raid.

734
00:53:52,076 --> 00:53:53,177
This is bad.

735
00:53:55,016 --> 00:53:57,556
By the way, I heard from Captain Jung.

736
00:53:57,887 --> 00:54:00,226
What are these photos Yoo Yoon Young gave you?

737
00:54:01,056 --> 00:54:02,226
Let's talk about that tomorrow.

738
00:54:08,927 --> 00:54:11,666
Father, please forgive our sins.

739
00:54:12,036 --> 00:54:14,407
Please save us from the fiery pit of fire.

740
00:54:15,967 --> 00:54:17,976
Please watch over the souls in purgatory.

741
00:54:19,206 --> 00:54:21,047
Watch over the soul, burdened with the most tragic...

742
00:54:22,306 --> 00:54:23,476
abandonment.

743
00:54:30,186 --> 00:54:32,686
(The day of Cha Eun Sae's murder)

744
00:54:43,127 --> 00:54:44,197
Cha Eun Sae...

745
00:54:45,936 --> 00:54:49,567
suspects you and the assemblyman as the culprits.

746
00:54:57,516 --> 00:54:59,475
She said she had to do something about it.

747
00:54:59,476 --> 00:55:01,447
She said she would tell everything to the police.

748
00:55:05,556 --> 00:55:07,826
If Cha Eun Sae exposes everything, it will be over.

749
00:55:08,757 --> 00:55:10,456
The truth about Jin's murder and the factory fire...

750
00:55:12,326 --> 00:55:13,797
will come out.

751
00:55:19,166 --> 00:55:20,237
What do I do?

752
00:55:21,237 --> 00:55:23,607
Oh, no. It's all because of my diary.

753
00:55:27,246 --> 00:55:28,507
Don't cry.

754
00:55:30,047 --> 00:55:31,916
It's a blessing that we found out before she did anything.

755
00:55:34,887 --> 00:55:36,246
We can fix it now.

756
00:55:39,217 --> 00:55:40,527
This is the last time.

757
00:55:41,456 --> 00:55:42,527
This...

758
00:55:44,027 --> 00:55:45,127
will end it...

759
00:55:45,857 --> 00:55:46,927
for good.

760
00:55:48,896 --> 00:55:51,966
They will start installing the security cameras...

761
00:55:51,967 --> 00:55:53,366
all over the building tomorrow.

762
00:55:57,976 --> 00:55:59,536
We only have today to do it.

763
00:56:23,996 --> 00:56:25,637
(Father)

764
00:56:29,806 --> 00:56:32,475
- Yes. - I know the police let you go.

765
00:56:32,476 --> 00:56:33,536
Come home now.

766
00:56:46,587 --> 00:56:48,225
So, I hear that woman, Yoo Yoon Young,

767
00:56:48,226 --> 00:56:49,986
is connected to the Bongto Factory fire,

768
00:56:49,987 --> 00:56:51,657
the Jin Myung Sook case,

769
00:56:51,996 --> 00:56:54,826
and the Cha Eun Sae case too.

770
00:56:55,567 --> 00:56:56,567
That's right.

771
00:56:58,197 --> 00:56:59,896
She's helping us.

772
00:57:04,036 --> 00:57:07,277
It means the Lord has already forgiven you for your sins.

773
00:57:08,177 --> 00:57:10,476
The Lord will take good care of you from now on.

774
00:57:16,447 --> 00:57:18,055
As soon as the case is closed,

775
00:57:18,056 --> 00:57:20,887
join the team in charge of the second Mujin resort.

776
00:57:21,186 --> 00:57:23,387
It'll take a while for the case to be closed.

777
00:57:23,927 --> 00:57:25,027
Yoon Young...

778
00:57:26,297 --> 00:57:27,527
has an alibi.

779
00:57:29,666 --> 00:57:32,366
They arrested her without even checking her alibi?

780
00:57:32,496 --> 00:57:35,436
Yoon Young planned everything, but someone else executed it.

781
00:57:36,706 --> 00:57:38,876
Yoon Young set up spy cams at the scene in advance,

782
00:57:38,877 --> 00:57:39,906
ordered someone to commit the murder,

783
00:57:39,907 --> 00:57:41,177
and lured Jung Won to the scene,

784
00:57:42,976 --> 00:57:45,146
but the investigation will go nowhere without solid evidence.

785
00:57:46,076 --> 00:57:47,286
There were spy cams?

786
00:57:50,217 --> 00:57:52,286
I'm suspecting Yoon Young had an accomplice,

787
00:57:54,226 --> 00:57:55,587
and it's someone you know, Father.

788
00:57:56,587 --> 00:57:58,027
If this person really was her accomplice,

789
00:57:58,797 --> 00:58:02,226
then our plan to build the second Mujin resort will be affected.

790
00:58:06,266 --> 00:58:07,337
What should we do?

791
00:58:09,536 --> 00:58:10,607
Seeing how the Lord...

792
00:58:11,007 --> 00:58:13,706
keeps on testing you...

793
00:58:14,346 --> 00:58:15,377
tells me...

794
00:58:16,947 --> 00:58:19,547
that I will never be forgiven for my sins,

795
00:58:22,817 --> 00:58:23,817
Father.

796
00:58:40,237 --> 00:58:42,737
Hey, what's up? You want to go to work with me?

797
00:58:43,366 --> 00:58:45,736
I booked a small banquet room at a hotel.

798
00:58:45,737 --> 00:58:46,777
My goodness.

799
00:58:47,976 --> 00:58:49,076
For a party to celebrate?

800
00:58:49,907 --> 00:58:52,116
I must say, that interview yesterday was very cool.

801
00:58:52,277 --> 00:58:53,615
Hey, I read some of the comments.

802
00:58:53,616 --> 00:58:56,616
Once the show resumes next week, we'll get such high ratings.

803
00:58:57,686 --> 00:59:00,216
Hey, can you tell Chief Kang and Reporter Joo...

804
00:59:00,217 --> 00:59:02,487
that I'll hold a press conference at 2pm today?

805
00:59:02,627 --> 00:59:04,027
A press conference? Why?

806
00:59:05,456 --> 00:59:08,197
Is there something you forgot to say at the interview yesterday?

807
00:59:09,467 --> 00:59:11,666
There's something...

808
00:59:12,567 --> 00:59:13,737
I must expose, for one last time.

809
00:59:22,107 --> 00:59:23,805
After my press conference at 2pm,

810
00:59:23,806 --> 00:59:25,377
I'll go to the police station to be interviewed.

811
00:59:26,116 --> 00:59:27,786
I want you to interview me.

812
00:59:30,487 --> 00:59:31,986
- Tae Heon. - Yes.

813
00:59:31,987 --> 00:59:34,226
The analysis team said they didn't have those photos.

814
00:59:35,157 --> 00:59:36,286
What is going on?

815
00:59:39,027 --> 00:59:40,127
Hey, Kim Tae Heon!

816
00:59:42,967 --> 00:59:44,067
Have you lost your mind?

817
00:59:47,166 --> 00:59:49,365
I lost the photos Yoo Yoon Young gave me.

818
00:59:49,366 --> 00:59:51,205
- Please wait until I find... - You punk.

819
00:59:51,206 --> 00:59:53,076
You lost them? You deliberately hid them!

820
00:59:54,846 --> 00:59:55,877
Look at this.

821
01:00:09,127 --> 01:00:10,857
You are dismissed from your position as of this moment,

822
01:00:11,326 --> 01:00:13,326
so hand over the cuffs and your police ID. Now!

823
01:00:43,556 --> 01:00:44,627
What's going on?

824
01:00:48,896 --> 01:00:50,266
The police suddenly barged in.

825
01:00:56,036 --> 01:00:57,067
What is going on?

826
01:00:57,306 --> 01:00:59,936
We're on duty at the moment. Please give us a few minutes.

827
01:01:01,047 --> 01:01:02,107
Sir!

828
01:01:03,206 --> 01:01:04,317
Did you find something?

829
01:01:09,146 --> 01:01:12,456
We found blood on the sole of these shoes.

830
01:01:20,627 --> 01:01:21,697
Ms. Seo.

831
01:01:21,896 --> 01:01:24,266
You're under arrest for the murder of Cha Eun Sae.

832
01:02:14,186 --> 01:02:17,217
(Nothing Uncovered)

833
01:02:17,487 --> 01:02:20,657
How much do you love her that you did such a thing?

834
01:02:20,857 --> 01:02:21,927
Because I trusted her.

835
01:02:22,056 --> 01:02:25,396
It sounds like you feel betrayed now because you trusted her.

836
01:02:25,596 --> 01:02:27,395
I'll take a hit too.

837
01:02:27,396 --> 01:02:29,126
We must catch the real culprit. It is the only way.

838
01:02:29,127 --> 01:02:30,966
Please help me so Jung Won can be released.

839
01:02:30,967 --> 01:02:32,036
I'll do anything.

840
01:02:32,366 --> 01:02:35,406
Soo Rin, I need you to do something before you leave.

841
01:02:35,407 --> 01:02:38,106
They found blood on the sole of Reporter Seo's shoes, but...

842
01:02:38,107 --> 01:02:39,177
Cha Eun Sae's blood?

843
01:02:39,677 --> 01:02:42,047
Will you divorce her and marry me?

844
01:02:42,507 --> 01:02:44,746
Have they issued an arrest warrant on me?

845
01:02:44,817 --> 01:02:47,015
Do you know what you can do to get out of your situation...

846
01:02:47,016 --> 01:02:48,817
when you're at the end of your rope?
