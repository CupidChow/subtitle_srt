=Episode 18=

3
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:22,590
What's wrong?

4
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:24,430
You should step back.

5
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:26,390
Why?

6
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:29,030
Xu Yiqing disappeared
because of the Yingqiao Project.

7
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:32,870
I don't want you
to end up with the same fate.

8
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:38,340
I'm investigating the Yingqiao Project

9
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:39,740
because it has to do

10
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:41,190
with me and Xu Yiqing.

11
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:45,550
But why provoke your uncle?

12
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:49,190
Are you worried about me?

13
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:51,270
I'm serious.

14
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,590
You know what kind
of person Mo Sanxing is.

15
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:56,790
If pushed too far,

16
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:58,980
he'll do anything.

17
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:00,980
Don't worry.

18
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:04,700
The reason I first joined
the company as an intern

19
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:07,670
was because of the Yingqiao Project.

20
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:10,270
My mother thought my uncle
was transferring company assets,

21
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:11,550
so she sent me in.

22
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:13,580
She also suspected me, right?

23
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:14,670
I'm sorry.

24
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:17,980
I had my concerns,

25
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:19,950
so I didn't explain everything to you.

26
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:21,670
That's why I have to get involved.

27
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:22,950
Not just for you.

28
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:29,750
But would escalating the conflict

29
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:34,780
between your mother and Mo Sanxing now

30
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:36,140
be too soon?

31
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:41,060
We'll have to face it eventually.

32
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:45,390
Besides, you said yourself
that he's my uncle.

33
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:49,910
If you were my girlfriend,

34
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:51,950
he might be wary and think twice

35
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,980
before doing something to you.

36
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:58,980
Sit back down.

37
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:06,350
Since we've already started,

38
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,740
there's no reason to give up halfway,

39
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:09,860
right?

40
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:12,350
Don't worry.

41
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:13,420
You're too tense.

42
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:16,070
How about we go out

43
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:18,090
and settle your nerves?

44
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:26,980
You've improved a lot.

45
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:28,700
Have you been secretly practicing?

46
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:30,900
What's there to practice?

47
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,460
(Yeyu, Let's run together at night
and follow our hearts)

48
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:44,550
I really hope we can save Tianye,

49
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:47,180
especially Yeyu.

50
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:49,980
Why?

51
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:52,720
(Yeyu, Let's run together at night)
I want you

52
00:02:52,721 --> 00:02:54,140
(and follow our hearts)
to always see that phrase.

53
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:00,390
What did Bian Jinxi say to you?

54
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:03,420
Nothing much. We just chatted.

55
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:04,950
We didn't mention you.

56
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:09,270
Well, I think your attitude's improved.

57
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,580
Didn't you say

58
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,700
we should start over as friends again?

59
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,110
But

60
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,020
friends are friends.

61
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:19,700
Advertising is advertising.

62
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:21,550
Then, can I start

63
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:22,740
pursuing you again as a friend?

64
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:26,510
I see you're more interested
in going back to being strangers.

65
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:48,699
(The signing ceremony for
Ankang Capital's investment in Tianye)

66
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:53,054
(will be held this Friday at 10:00 AM
in the Sanxing Group conference room.)

67
00:03:53,055 --> 00:03:55,220
(Please attend promptly.)

68
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:58,860
Did you get it?

69
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:03,180
Hostile takeovers
are Lingkang's usual tactic.

70
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:06,180
If we can expose this before dawn,

71
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:07,740
we might

72
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:10,630
get the board
to vote with us against it.

73
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:12,950
What do you think?

74
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:17,340
There's nothing abnormal
about this acquisition process.

75
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,630
It's not really a hostile takeover.

76
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:20,990
And as long as Mo Sanxing denies it,

77
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:22,750
we don't have any concrete evidence

78
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:25,580
to prove he's the actual
beneficiary behind Lingkang.

79
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,660
Do you have a plan in mind?

80
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:37,340
Yes.

81
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:40,020
The white knight strategy.

82
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,780
We need to find a third-party company

83
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:46,950
to compete with Lingkang
for Tianye's operating rights

84
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:49,990
until Lingkang is forced
to give up the acquisition.

85
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,950
But what if
the third-party company succeeds?

86
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:55,460
They won't.

87
00:04:57,390 --> 00:05:00,390
Think about it.
As long as the third-party company

88
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,540
isn't actually controlled

89
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,750
by Mo Sanxing,

90
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:05,900
this business move

91
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,390
will be meaningless

92
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,780
to him.

93
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:11,780
With Tianye doing so well now,

94
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:14,990
Mo Sanxing won't let it go easily.

95
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:19,220
Where do we find this white knight?

96
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:22,430
Think carefully again.

97
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:24,780
There's a suitable candidate.

98
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:48,580
What were you two thinking?

99
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,430
Coming here dressed like that.

100
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:53,070
Told you so.

101
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:55,540
Didn't you have something to tell me?

102
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:56,540
Come here.

103
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:57,020
Say what you came to say.

104
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:59,340
Then we can have a drink together!

105
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:01,660
What?

106
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:05,270
You want me to compete with Lingkang
for Tianye's operating rights?

107
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:06,190
Yes.

108
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:07,460
Do you really think

109
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,100
I can handle something this big?

110
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:12,190
And under my mother's Xinlan Group name?

111
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:13,430
Look,

112
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:16,390
if you can't pull it off, no one can.

113
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:17,660
Not a chance.

114
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,340
If I fail,

115
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:21,950
my mother will kill me.

116
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:25,660
You might as well tie me up instead.

117
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,340
Help us this one time.

118
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:32,540
Please?

119
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:35,460
How about this?

120
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,580
We'll handle
your mother's nagging about marriage

121
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,340
for you.

122
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:45,830
Deal.

123
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:48,510
How are we going to solve it?

124
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,220
Where were we?

125
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:35,580
Maybe you should head back first.

126
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:36,340
No way.

127
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:38,870
We have to find any and all flaws
and suspicious points

128
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:41,460
in Mo Sanxing
and Lingkang's collaboration,

129
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,460
as well as the cons of this acquisition.

130
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:45,020
If Bian Jinxi

131
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:46,660
doesn't show up tomorrow,

132
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:48,580
at least

133
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:50,140
we'll have a backup plan to stop it.

134
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:54,780
But you're already…

135
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:57,430
I'll go wash my face

136
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:58,430
and clear my head.

137
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:35,780
Who's there?

138
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:37,180
It's okay.

139
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:40,420
It's me.

140
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:47,780
Let's get out of here.

141
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:05,540
Who's there?

142
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:07,350
Gu Zhaohe.

143
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:10,780
Mr. Gu and Ms. Yu.

144
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:13,820
What's going on?

145
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:16,940
A short circuit in the electrical box.
The fuse won't reset.

146
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:18,590
Was it deliberate?

147
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:19,820
Hard to say.

148
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:23,390
It's fine.

149
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:24,140
Mr. Gu, Ms. Yu,

150
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,470
why don't you two go home for tonight?

151
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:27,350
It probably won't get fixed tonight.

152
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:28,870
All right.

153
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:30,820
Let's go.

154
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:31,710
Let's head this way.

155
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,060
I'll light the way for you.

156
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:33,820
Okay.

157
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:45,060
Why don't you rest?

158
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:46,060
I'll go back and continue looking.

159
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:47,780
There's no time.

160
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:48,870
Time waits for no one.

161
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:22,540
Mr. Mo, Ms. Ling and Young Master Gu
went through a lot of information

162
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:24,270
in the archives last night.

163
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,820
All related to our projects

164
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,420
with Mr. Ling over the years.

165
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:28,350
Mm.

166
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:30,420
I cut the power

167
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:31,820
to stop them from continuing.

168
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:35,900
Were you worried they wouldn't know

169
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,590
they were being watched?

170
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:39,230
Should I…

171
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:41,390
All they did was search
through some files, right?

172
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,590
Let them search.

173
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:45,350
Today's the signing ceremony.

174
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:47,180
As if them pulling an all-nighter

175
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:50,780
would stop
today's signing from happening.
