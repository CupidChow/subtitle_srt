Lin.

5
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:18,080
Let's hear Xi Ling out.

6
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:22,890
Thank you, Mr. Mo.

7
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:25,459
According to my investigation,

8
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:27,819
the IP address used to send that email

9
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,619
is indeed in our office.

10
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:31,299
However, according to
the MARC code analysis

11
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,170
done by the technical expert,

12
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:35,320
it wasn't Gu Zhaohe's computer.

13
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:38,410
What do you mean by that?

14
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:41,210
What I'm saying is

15
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:43,699
someone stole Gu Zhaohe's password,

16
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:45,059
sneaked into our office,

17
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:46,379
and used a new computer

18
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:47,869
to send that email

19
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:49,240
so as to frame Gu Zhaohe.

20
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,189
Can we locate the computer used?

21
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:53,570
Yes, we can.

22
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:55,600
It's a mobile phone.

23
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:02,389
We can identify the suspect

24
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:05,309
through the surveillance footage

25
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:07,280
of him sending the email.

26
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:16,690
However, the camera was
under maintenance then.

27
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,440
All of the footage were erased.

28
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:27,029
Xiling has defended her subordinate
to this extent.

29
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:29,339
She's truly a good superior
that values her workers.

30
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:32,250
But what happened is abominable.

31
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,059
But our company hasn't had any losses

32
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,690
due to that.

33
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:40,949
Well, I would like you all
to take this as a lesson

34
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:42,210
and enhance your management.

35
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:46,130
Since we're running of clues here,

36
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:48,130
let's drop this subject for now.

37
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:50,829
If so, Mr. Mo...

38
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:51,690
Yes?

39
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:54,189
Since Gu Zhaohe is no longer a suspect,

40
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:55,330
I suggest

41
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:57,829
to have him reinstated
in his job immediately.

42
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:59,519
Of course we will do so.

43
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,380
Any objection?

44
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:03,669
No.

45
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:04,749
Thank you, Mr. Mo.

46
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,109
You have always been just

47
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:08,410

I knew Gu Zhaohe would never sell us out.
