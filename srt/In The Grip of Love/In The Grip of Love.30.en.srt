3
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,000
You're here.

4
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:33,920
What did you want to tell me?

5
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:36,880
I got rid of Zhou Ju.

6
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:41,910
Mo Sanxing told me about the address

7
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,440
of her son's kindergarten.

8
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:47,800
When you were on the phone with her,

9
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:49,579
I was nearby.

10
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:51,230
Did you kidnap her son?

11
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:54,630
I didn't.

12
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:57,009
I did what I did

13
00:00:57,010 --> 00:01:01,160
knowing that she'd missed

14
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:02,710
her son.

15
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:07,790
She treated her child

16
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:10,990
so well.

17
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:18,680
But I

18
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:20,600
treated you...

19
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:29,240
Zhou Ju's current address is

20
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:30,769
No. 42,

21
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:32,150
Lane 5,

22
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:34,400
Yanghua Road.

23
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:40,240
How much money

24
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:44,400
did Mo Sanxing give you?

25
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:46,120
I've spent all of it

26
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:50,040
on my medical fees.

27
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:53,200
So it's meaningless.

28
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:57,990
After all, Mo Sanxing wanted me
to bring the secret to the grave.

29
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:00,790
Well...

30
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,480
I've done you

31
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,040
and your mother wrong.

32
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,640
And

33
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,270
I've recorded

34
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,310
everything I said.

35
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:20,619
Just show this to Zhou Ju.

36
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:23,430
She will testify against it.

37
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:25,710
Take it.

38
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:31,030
Is it

39
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,590
too late?

40
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:39,840
Not at all.

41
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,400
The passcode is

42
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:46,080
your birth date.

43
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:52,310
Everything you did

44
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,920
in the past...

45
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:02,640
I know...

46
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,400
Thank you for telling me all this.

47
00:03:58,860 --> 00:03:59,993
(Xu Yiqing, Blog Post)

48
00:03:59,994 --> 00:04:02,160
(I've been trying to keep myself posted
on you, Xiling)

49
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:16,529
Find out the IP address used

50
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:17,979
by the blogger for me.

51
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,070
Be quick.

52
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:25,990
(Xiling.)

53
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:27,529
(I've been trying)

54
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:29,560
(to follow you all these years.)

55
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:31,600
(I never thought)

56
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:34,750
(you'd never given up on
investigating the incident of Yingqiao.)

57
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:36,800
(I feel ashamed)

58
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:38,720
(for having betrayed you.)

59
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,400
(I've been trying to keep myself posted on you)
(I'm aware the police are after me.)

60
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:44,480
(So it's time for me to explain myself.)

61
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:48,950
(During the Yingqiao project,)

62
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,800
(Mo Sanxing suggested to secretly
transfer Sanxing's property)

63
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,310
(using the project as a facade.)

64
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:56,480
(I ever expressed my objection)

65
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:58,419
(as the person in charge
of the project.)

66
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:59,920
(And I thought of quitting.)

67
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:03,259
(Yet in the face
of the tempting, enormous profit,)

68
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:04,990
(I couldn't say no to it)

69
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,040
(and ended up
becoming Mo Sanxing's accomplice.)

70
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:10,769
(I've been trying to keep myself posted
on you, Xiling.)

71
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:11,680
(After that,)

72
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:14,329
(during the inspection
of the department involved,)

73
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:16,040
(the beans were spilled.)

74
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,379
(Mo Sanxing then made me)

75
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:19,990
(take all the blame.)

76
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,870
(He tried to send me abroad,)

77
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:25,280
(making me look like a fugitive.)

78
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:28,950
(I've been in hiding)

79
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,160
(for the past three years.)

80
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:34,630
(It's actually because I haven't been
able to tell you this.)

81
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:37,720
(I've been trying to keep myself posted on you)
(Xiling. Come with me.)

82
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:40,830
(I'm more aware than ever)

83
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:43,040
(that I made that decision)

84
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,280
(for money.)

85
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:49,800
(I thought you'd give up on seeking
the truth after these three years.)

86
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:53,360
(That's why I've been in hiding
without much thought.)

87
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:57,800
(Little did I expect
that you'd never give up on it.)

88
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:04,990
This is the outcome of the meeting.
Gu Zhaohe is elected chairman.

89
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:12,720
(Xiling.)

90
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:15,310
(Please forgive me for being avoidant
all these years.)

91
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:19,040
(In fact, I've had a copy
of Yingqiao's genuine invoices)

92
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:21,560
(and the relevant data from back then.)

93
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,830
(In order to avoid getting found out,)

94
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:26,480
(I hid it in my photo with you.)

95
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:28,280
(All this is more than enough)

96
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:31,070
(to serve as the evidence used
to testify against Mo Sanxing.)

97
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:53,390

I didn't expect it
to be just a dismissal.

103
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:32,350
And he even gets to retain his shares.

104
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:34,640
He really got off easy.

105
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:38,230
He's my uncle, after all.

106
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:41,520
Well,

107
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:44,400
should I call me

108
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:47,190
Chairman Gu now?

109
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:48,880
Perhaps

110
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:50,800
you can call me something else.

111
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:56,160
Xiling.

112
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:59,070
I have something to say to you.

113
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:01,280
What's it?

114
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:03,099
I still remember

115
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,880
I first came here

116
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,680
to approach you.

117
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:09,280
However, little did I know

118
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:12,000
that I'd end up falling for you.

119
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:16,430
So I always ask myself

120
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:19,310
what I love about you.

121
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:24,830
Perhaps I was attracted by your beauty.

122
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,230
Maybe I was being impulsive.

123
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,710
It was not until later did I realize

124
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:33,680
that there had been

125
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:37,880
many misunderstandings and mishaps
between us.

126
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:42,800
Thus, I would like
to do something about it.

127
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:54,800
I want to end
our current relationship here,

128
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:57,920
where we first met each other.

129
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,310
I never expected

130
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:14,950
this day would come so soon.

131
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:21,430
I got it.

132
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:30,219
Instead of being my girlfriend,

133
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:31,539

140

From now on,
