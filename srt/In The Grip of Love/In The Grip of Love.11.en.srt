3
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,157
(Tianye's brand secret might be leaked.)

4
00:00:16,158 --> 00:00:18,120
(Investigative procedures
will be carried out.)

5
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:23,499
You've seen it, haven't you?

6
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:24,440
Yes.

7
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:28,299
Our department is always
in charge of this brand.

8
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:31,040
Aren't they saying that
we're the ones who leaked the secret?

9
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:33,210
They can't be doing this
without any evidence.

10
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:35,920
This doesn't involve you alone.

11
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:38,450
Well,

12
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:40,869
this will affect our entire department.

13
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:42,149
We would be made responsible for it,

14
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:44,450
making each of us a suspect.

15
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:46,299
What we need to do now is

16
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:50,269
figure out what exactly happened
before the higher-ups show up here.

17
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:52,269
We have to find out
whether it was an inside job

18
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:53,490
or

19
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:56,240
a petty trick pulled by some outsider.

20
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:58,850
An inside job, huh?

21
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,189
I'm Lucy from the HR department.

22
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:03,160
I'm Lin Zhiwen, the director
of the Ministry of Supervision.

23
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,280
I'm in charge
of Tianye's brand secret leakage.

24
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:06,050
Gu Zhaohe.

25
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:09,850
- Please cooperate with our investigation.
- Please leave your seat.

26
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:12,920
Hands off the mouse

27
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:14,690
and the keyboard.

28
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:17,770
Now.

29
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:31,000
What's the password
of your work address?

30
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:33,330
It's logged in.

31
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:39,499
Found it.

32
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,949
Please leave the office immediately.

33
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:42,829
We will conduct a investigation on you.

34
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:43,749
During the investigation,

35
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:44,339
please make sure

36
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,130
your phone is reachable all the time.

37
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:49,690
Please cooperate with us.

38
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:51,189
Can I get my bag?

39
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:52,859
Sure.

40
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:53,610
Hold on.

41
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:55,160
Which is yours?

42
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:17,200
Thank you all for your cooperation.

43
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:21,419
I have a question, Mr. Lin.

44
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:22,229
Where did you

45
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:24,739
get this information from?

46
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:26,410
Gu Zhaohe would never

47
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:27,949
leak our company's trade secrets

48
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:29,810
for Xinlan, our competitor.

49
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:31,850
Money.

50
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,480
That's enough of a reason.

51
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:37,160
Ms. Ling.

52
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,280
You're being overly subjective here.

53
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:43,320
Can I show Ms. Ling something?

54
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:48,410
I cannot tell you

55
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:49,650
where I got the information from.

56
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:51,320
Those in the pictures

57
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,250
are Gu Zhaohe

58
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:55,280
and the heiress
of Xinlan Group, Bian Jinxi.

59
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:56,880
Three days after,

60
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:59,370
Gu Zhaohe sent her the design of Yeyu,

61
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:01,069
as shown

62
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:02,650
in his mail box.

63
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:06,349
Well,

64
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:08,739
Gu is an intern working
in Xiling's department.

65
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,139
Of course we would want to

66
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,949
get to the bottom of it.

67
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:14,979
Yet there's no need
for such an argument you're having here,

68
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,090
right?

69
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:20,859
Lin is just

70
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:23,280
doing his job.

71
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,130
However,

72
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,250
he shouldn't have taken

73
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:32,000
these pictures.

74
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:41,320
You're right, Mr. Mo.

75
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,410
We should do
a thorough investigation on it.

76
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:48,600
Mr. Lin.

77
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:51,040
I will not get in your way

78
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,810
when you're performing your duties.

79
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,440
Gu Zhaohe would never do such a thing.

80
00:03:58,510 --> 00:03:59,549
How was it, Ms. Ling?

81
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:00,899
Gu Zhaohe would never leak the secret.

82
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,509
Indeed. Ms. Ling, that boy...

83
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:03,789
Aren't you supposed to be working?

84
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:05,410
Get back to work.

85
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,139
I need to talk to you, Andy.

86
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:08,970
What?

87
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:09,949
I...

88
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:10,850
What?

89
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:13,139
I swear to God, Ms. Ling.
I have nothing to do with all this.

90
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,309
Why did you want to see me?

91
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:16,509
You're close with Zhang
from the IT department, aren't you?

92
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:17,579
- No, I...
- He helped you download some games, no?

93
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:18,730
No.

94
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,539
I no longer play them.
I had them uninstalled long ago.

95
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:21,579
Ask him to help us

96
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:24,440
locate Gu Zhaohe's
email login IP address.

97
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,539
I don't think he'd be silly enough

98
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:29,930
to send that email
using the company server.

99
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,429
That'd be tracked easily.

100
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:32,520
Yes.

101
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:34,610
Okay, I got it.

102
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,200
Oh, right.

103
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:44,250
I want to confirm something
with you, Ms. Ling.

104
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:47,610
Are you trying to protect Gu Zhaohe

105
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,320
or seek the truth?

106
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:51,760
Finding out the truth

107
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,880
is the way to protect him.

108
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:57,749
You managed

109
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,440
to take advantage of the situation.

110
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:00,880
Wu Jiang.

111
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:03,139
Good job.

112
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:04,320
Thank you, Mr. Mo.

113
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:09,640
Have you managed
to persuade Gu Zhaohe to resign?

114
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:12,570
He has denied the claim
and refused to resign.

115
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:21,520
As time goes by, he will lose it.

116
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:25,730
I'm sure the HR department will

117
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:27,690
do their job.

118
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:29,440
You're right, Mr. Mo.

119
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:30,760
However,

120
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,570
considering his relationship
with Ms. Ling...

121
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:34,690
What are they?

122
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:41,659
This nephew of mine won't
put up with all this for nothing.

123
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:44,749
If he wants to stay,
he will have to disclose his identity.

124
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,760
Well, will Xiling still believe him
when that happens?

125
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:49,570
As Mo Ran's son,

126
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:51,389
he needs to think twice

127
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:53,069
before doing something.

128
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:54,539
Are you saying

129
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:56,659
it was Ms. Mo Lan
who arranged Young Master Gu

130
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,440
to work here?

131
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:04,219
The group is doing good.

132
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:05,629
It's inevitable that my sister wants

133
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:07,440
to be part of it.

134
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:10,520
She's acting like an attention seeker

135
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,570
in the hope of claiming
a piece of the pie.

136
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,320
There's nothing unusual about it.

137
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,250
You're right, Mr. Mo.

138
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:30,930
Gu Zhaohe.

139
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,570
Open up.

140
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:50,810
Gu Zhaohe.

141
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:59,130
Why didn't you pick up your phone?

142
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:03,490
I didn't check it.

143
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:07,080
Aren't you going to explain yourself?

144
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,429
There's nothing to explain about.

145
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:10,130
Like I said, I didn't do it.

146
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:11,989
Why would I leak Tianye's secret?

147
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:12,509
Well,

148
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:15,130
how do you explain the pictures
of you and the Xinlan Group's heiress

149
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,250
having a meal?

150
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:22,440
You don't believe me either.

151
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:25,069
Is there a problem
with me having a meal with her?

152
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,099
Does that mean

153
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,130
I'm in cahoots with her?

154
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:30,050
It's not that I don't believe you.

155
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:33,019
The pictures of you eating with her

156
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,920
are tied to the email
of our company's secret leakage.

157
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:38,779
I'm just trying to understand what exactly
happened here. Only then can I help you.

158
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:41,219
There's no need for that.
Let them carry on with the investigation.

159
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,269
What kind of attitude is that?

160
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:44,080
What else can I do, then?

161
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:46,019
You were there this afternoon.

162
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,019
Did they even let me explain myself?

163
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,930
They can do whatever they want.

164
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:51,440
Fine.

165
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:53,930
I was silly enough

166
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:55,570
to have worried about you.

167
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,050
Gu Zhaohe.

168
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:06,629
Do you think it's that simple?

169
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:08,389
Mo Sanxing wouldn't have you
do anything

170
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:10,069
if he insisted on defaming you.

171
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:10,829
This concerns

172
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:12,339
the entire Tianye project team,

173
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,339
not just you alone.

174
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,509
What do the rest do?

175
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:15,930
How can you be this childish?

176
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:19,219
Are you talking to you

177
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:20,290
as my superior

178
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:21,779
or girlfriend?

179
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,080
Is there a difference between both?

180
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,370
I apologize for the inconvenience,

181
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:26,840
Ms. Ling.

182
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:47,659
Zhang got this video
from the management department.

183
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:48,869
It shows

184
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:50,530
our office entrance.

185
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:51,989
I managed to get this

186
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,240
after I treated Zhang to a meal.

187
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:54,419
I'll reimburse you for that.

188
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:55,650
You are certainly generous.

189
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:57,840
Okay, I'll get to the point.

190
00:08:58,350 --> 00:08:59,539
Regarding this surveillance footage,

191
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,659
Zhang told me that

192
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,179
it's most likely that this person

193
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:04,139
got into our company network

194
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,589
and server

195
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:07,240
to send that email

196
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:08,770
using Gu Zhaohe's email address.

197
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:11,469
Yet this video is not clear enough.

198
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:13,770
I really can't identify this person.

199
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:19,650
That's Wu Jiang.

200
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:23,440
Isn't he...

201
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:30,050
Make a copy of this video at once.

202
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:31,650
And don't tell a soul

203
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,480
about it.

204
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:36,050
Not even Gu Zhaohe?

205
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:38,170
Let him cool down first.

206
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:41,050
Sure, I'll see to that now.

207
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:51,770
(Tianye ranks first in the domestic sports category)
Yeyu is going viral among shoes fans.

208
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:52,989
The pre-ordered edition

209
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:54,349
has had 30,000 orders

210
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:55,749
online.

211
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,109
The success of Yeyu has also

212
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:58,869
motivated Tianye's brand effect.

213
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:00,989
As of now, Tianye is ranking the top

214
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:04,120
among the domestic sports brands
in terms of monthly sales.

215
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:06,019
Well done.

216
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:08,179
Xiling, Tianye has been thriving

217
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:09,509
under your leadership.

218
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:12,139
This will also serve
as a bargaining chip for our future negotiation

219
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:13,589
with Lingkang Group.

220
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:14,960
Thank you for your hard work.

221
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:19,819
Mr. Mo.

222
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,050
I have another thing

223
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,539
to brief everyone on.

224
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:23,240
Go ahead.

225
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,425
(The IP address used to send
that email is indeed our company's.)

226
00:10:28,426 --> 00:10:29,840
(But the MARC code
wasn't that of Gu Zhaohe's computer.)

227
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,890
I've looked into the company secret leakage
involving Gu Zhaohe.

228
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:34,890
What we have here is

229
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,480
the technical analysis result
of that email.

230
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:40,360
Ms. Ling.

231
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,749
What is this?

232
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:42,840
Lin.

233
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:45,010
Let's hear Xi Ling out.

234
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:49,690
Thank you, Mr. Mo.

235
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,360
According to my investigation,

236
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:54,779
the IP address used to send that email

237
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,589
is indeed in our office.

238
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:58,269
However, according to
the MARC code analysis

239
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:00,120
done by the technical expert,

240
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:02,290
it wasn't Gu Zhaohe's computer.

241
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:05,440
What do you mean by that?

242
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:08,170
What I'm saying is

243
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:10,819
someone stole Gu Zhaohe's password,

244
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,019
sneaked into our office,

245
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,349
and used a new computer

246
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:14,819
to send that email

247
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,200
so as to frame Gu Zhaohe.

248
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:19,179
Can we locate the computer used?

249
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,480
Yes, we can.
