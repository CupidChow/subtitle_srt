3
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:18,600
Mr. Mo.

4
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,640
I brought some bird's nest for you.

5
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:24,760
It's so late already.
Sorry to trouble you, Mr. Mo.

6
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:25,640
It's fine.

7
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:27,199
Well,

8
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,960
there's a bar downstairs.

9
00:00:29,719 --> 00:00:31,760
Let me buy you a couple of drinks.

10
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:34,399
Sure. I'll buy you.

11
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,719
Do you want to put it inside first?

12
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,920
Oh, sure.

13
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:51,320
(From the various situations,)

14
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:55,079
(it's obvious that Yu Xiling isn't
in a relationship with Mo Sanxing.)

15
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,439
(Where did the rumors
of them dating come from?)

16
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,119
(Why did it spread so widely?)

17
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:07,200
(If it's not to chase Yu Xiling
away from Sanxing,)

18
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:10,280
(there's only another possibility.)

19
00:01:13,593 --> 00:01:15,120
You asked me to come back

20
00:01:15,319 --> 00:01:16,719
but why are you so late?

21
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:21,319
I went to visit your future aunt.

22
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:24,799
(It seems like I've found
the source of the rumor.)

23
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:25,719
Zhaohe.

24
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:28,239
Oh.

25
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:29,879
What's wrong with your face?

26
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:31,879
It's nothing. I slipped.

27
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,200
Uncle,

28
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,840
your face is radiant.

29
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:39,680
Are you

30
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,120
in your eighth relationship?

31
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,359
Not really.

32
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,400
I can only say that I've gained

33
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:49,799
some development.

34
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:51,079
Zhaohe,

35
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,319
drink with me.

36
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:53,400
Sure.

37
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:57,599
Uncle,

38
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,799
I think you have been divorced

39
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,280
for three years now.

40
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:04,680
This is a hard nut to crack.

41
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,079
It'll be tough.

42
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:09,400
You are sharp today.

43
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:11,520
Really?

44
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,599
Do you have something to tell me?

45
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:17,400
I want to move out.

46
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,560
Why?

47
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:19,840
I have someone I like.

48
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,319
I want to be closer to her.

49
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,360
I support you.

50
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,639
It's nice being young.

51
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,479
Remember what I told you last time?

52
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,719
If you need anything,

53
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,919
I can help you.

54
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:40,840
Uncle,

55
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,240
what does the woman you like

56
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,039
look like?

57
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:47,400
Tell me about her.

58
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,199
She matches

59
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,319
every fantasy I have about women.

60
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:04,120
Whether it's
her appearance or personality,

61
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:08,759
she ticks every box for
a perfect partner of mine.

62
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:13,000
Do you like women

63
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,479
or do you like marriage?

64
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,919
Actually, what is the core value
of every relationship?

65
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,599
An exchange of values.

66
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,000
A person

67
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,599
has value.

68
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:35,840
Marriage is the exchange of values.

69
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,199
So, the certificate of marriage
doesn't guarantee...

70
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,879
You will understand in the future.

71
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:47,879
Uncle,

72
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,479
I've always wanted
to ask you a question.

73
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:51,800
Sure.

74
00:03:53,719 --> 00:03:56,120
Have you treated

75
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,039
all my previous seven aunts sincerely?

76
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,759
Of course.

77
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:15,039
I gave them

78
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:17,160
everything they needed.

79
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,120
That was good enough.

80
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,160
(What does Yu Xiling want then?)

81
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,519
Ms. Ling,

82
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,920
Every material for the launch

83
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,680
has been prepared.

84
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,720
I have verified it a few times.

85
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:34,360
Two-thirds of the relevant attendees

86
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,399
and media are already here.

87
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,720
Every model has arrived.

88
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,040
Every costume has been checked.

89
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,560
Every piece of equipment at the venue
has been prepared and accounted for.

90
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:41,079
Andy.

91
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:43,839
Ms. Ling!

92
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:46,040
Have you done your job?

93
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:48,319
On my way here,

94
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:49,920
I've confirmed it
with our team at the venue.

95
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,681
Have you checked the host's script?

96
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,120
I have.

97
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,399
Everyone.

98
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,120
Today is the first launch

99
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,560
of our brand, Tianye.

100
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,800
I hope no one makes any mistakes.

101
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:01,720
Do you understand?

102
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,040
Yes.

103
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,000
Go to work.

104
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,720
What's wrong, Ms. Ling.

105
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,360
This is your first time
handling a whole project.

106
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,759
Don't be nervous.

107
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,519
Yes.

108
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,720
Go to work.

109
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,620
(Ling An Condominium Property Agent)

110
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,519
Hello.

111
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,399
I told you many times.

112
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:33,720
I just want 1019.

113
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:36,480
Tell him. If he is willing to move,

114
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,519
I'll pay a year's rent extra
as compensation.

115
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:42,040
We will now enter

116
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,680
the main event of this launch.

117
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:45,639
It's...

118
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,639
The new shoe introduction highlight.

119
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,600
A card is missing.

120
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,600
A card is missing.

121
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:01,639
It's with me.

122
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:03,319
I think she has the wrong card.

123
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,360
Didn't you give this to the host?

124
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,279
No, I...

125
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,439
It's over here.

126
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,319
I'll go and replace her.

127
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,560
Gu Zhaohe?

128
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,279
Hello, everyone.

129
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,439
I am the model on the poster.

130
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,399
At the same time,

131
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:43,199
I am also a member
of the Tianye project team.

132
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:44,720
My name is Gu Zhaohe.

133
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,279
To give everyone

134
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:47,800
first-hand product information,

135
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,800
our brand
has not revealed any information

136
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:51,399
about this shoe.

137
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,959
Our positioning

138
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,360
of this shoe

139
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,800
is an urban jogging shoe.

140
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,600
(The First Sports Brand)
Its name

141
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,600
is Yeyu.

142
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,399
It means

143
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,040
a meeting from a night jog

144
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,639
that goes after what the heart wants.

145
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:13,160
I have been a sports student
since I was young

146
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,800
so I understand...

147
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:32,959
Buy everyone in the office candy.

148
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,839
Replacing me is taking revenge on me
for your personal grudge.

149
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,800
Don't move.

150
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:50,759
Sports is
one of the few things in this world

151
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:53,759
that will give you returns
as long as you put in effort.

152
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:56,639
Let me tell you something happy.

153
00:07:56,839 --> 00:07:58,439
I also have someone I like.

154
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,399
Jogging at night with her

155
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,839
is the happiest moment

156
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:02,439
(Yeyu)

157
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:03,839
of mine every day.

158
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,800
Yeyu is designed

159
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,680
and enhanced

160
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,399
by our team

161
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,120
with the best protection.

162
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,120
For our health,

163
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,639
for a better version of ourselves,

164
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,560
We should

165
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:17,959
keep running forward.

166
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:23,120
Thank you, everyone.

167
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,919
- Great!
- Great!

168
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:41,720
Did you hear what I say

169
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:43,519
during the launch?

170
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,399
You performed well
and saved the event on time.

171
00:08:54,919 --> 00:08:57,240
I'm not asking Ms. Ling

172
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,759
but Yu Xiling.

173
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:00,879
Ms. Ling!

174
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,360
Gu, don't chat here.

175
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,480
Ms. Ling,

176
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,320
doesn't come here often.

177
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:05,960
Why are you talking here?

178
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:07,840
Let's talk and eat upstairs.

179
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,840
What are you talking about?

180
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,039
How can I not be present
at such an important meal?

181
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:12,320
Of course.

182
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:14,399
Why are you spacing out?

183
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:15,200
Let's go.

184
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:19,159
Ms. Ling.

185
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,639
Gu Zhaohe, sit here.

186
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:22,440
I saved the seat for you.

187
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,679
I love to eat this.

188
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:26,639
Why are you sitting here?

189
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:27,799
I love to eat this.

190
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:35,879
Today is different.

191
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:38,279
Ms. Ling doesn't join us usually

192
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:40,679
but she is here today.

193
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:42,200
We are honored.

194
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,519
Cheers!

195
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,879
Everyone, let's have fun.

196
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,879
Cheers!

197
00:09:58,799 --> 00:09:59,720
Pour me a glass as well.

198
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,000
Gu Zhaohe!

199
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:07,039
You said

200
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:10,240
you have someone you like
on stage today.

201
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:11,840
Who is she?

202
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,639
Yes, I almost forgot
if you hadn't mentioned it.

203
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,720
Who is she?

204
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,519
Yes. Who is she?

205
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:19,960
I do have someone I like.

206
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,120
However,

207
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:25,399
I'm not sure if she likes me or not.

208
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,120
No matter who you like,

209
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:38,360
Gu Zhaohe,
