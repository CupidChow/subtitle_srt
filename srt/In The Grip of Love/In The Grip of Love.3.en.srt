=Episode 3=

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,499
Come in.

4
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:22,379
Hello, Ms. Ling.
I am the intern, Gu Zhaohe.

5
00:00:25,239 --> 00:00:26,740
This is my resume.

6
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,200
(Gu Zhaohe, Intern
Student of An Jing Sports University)

7
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,540
A student from a sports university?

8
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:41,820
You hired a student
instead of a graduate.

9
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,620
Because I am outstanding.

10
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,999
Do you even know
what the Sanxing Group does?

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,599
Sanxing Group is
a fashion apparel company

12
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,239
with over a dozen independent brands,

13
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,839
covering menswear,
womenswear, and footwear.

14
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,078
Recently, it has developed
a new sportswear brand, Tian Ye.

15
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:59,038
Any skills?

16
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:00,239
My strengths are the 100-metres

17
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,279
and the 110-meter hurdles.

18
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,438
In school, I excelled in all subjects,

19
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:06,479
ranking first in the department,

20
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,420
particularly

21
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:12,019
in specialized physical training design
and sports nutrition.

22
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:13,179
Andy.

23
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:14,780
Give us some privacy.

24
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,179
Yes.

25
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:31,078
You are relentless. What do you want?

26
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:32,839
I know this is not a coincidence.

27
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,078
I submitted the resume two months ago.

28
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:36,279
I went through two interviews.

29
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,718
I got the modeling job three days ago.

30
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:40,220
I was only the substitute.

31
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:41,459
What are the odds?

32
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:42,919
What exactly

33
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,140
do you mean by that?

34
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,559
When I ran into you last night,
you were already drunk.

35
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,679
The staff

36
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,300
saw us.

37
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:56,259
If any harm came to you,

38
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,980
the police would've come after me.

39
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,580
So, I took you to a room
to settle you down.

40
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,339
(I knew you'd ask.)

41
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:17,059
(I came prepared.)

42
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:19,820
Is there nothing else

43
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:21,779
you want to tell me?

44
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,380
No.

45
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,540
Good.

46
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:40,279
It was an online transfer.

47
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,839
I withdrew the cash

48
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,339
and only took
what paid for the hotel room.

49
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,739
Here's the balance.

50
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:54,300
You study in a sports university.

51
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,300
It doesn't seem adequate for you
to work here

52
00:02:58,439 --> 00:02:59,739
as a management trainee intern.

53
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:01,939
HR must have made a mistake.

54
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,318
I suggest...

55
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:05,580
If you insist on kicking me
out of Sanxing Group,

56
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,918
I'll have to buy everyone in the office

57
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:10,179
some candy.

58
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,739
You are hired.

59
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:16,839
If you fail to pass
the internship assessment,

60
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,559
I still have the right to dismiss you.

61
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,660
Very well.

62
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,718
The interview is over.
Don't be late for work.

63
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:26,219
You have ten points to lose.

64
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,219
I bought this at a pharmacy
on my way here.

65
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,700
I paid out of my pocket.

66
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:02,878
Hello.

67
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,239
Some chocolate for you.

68
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,179
Thank you.

69
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,100
Some chocolate for you.

70
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,619
Thank you.

71
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:13,820
I didn't expect to meet you again.

72
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,860
I look forward to working with you.

73
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,739
Certainly.

74
00:04:18,679 --> 00:04:20,600
Nice to meet you.
Allow me to introduce myself.

75
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,438
I am Gu Zhaohe.

76
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:23,340
I'll be your co-worker from now on.

77
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:25,179
I remember you. A sports student.

78
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,300
Yes.

79
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:28,838
All right.
When we have a sports day,

80
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:29,799
you're our star athlete.

81
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,900
Leave it to me.

82
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,420
That's good enough.

83
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,420
Can you drive?

84
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:37,340
Yes.

85
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,739
Come with me
to the advertisement selection.

86
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:49,398
Isn't that our job?

87
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:50,939
Why isn't she taking us with her?

88
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,499
Who knows?

89
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,619
If the average speed is lower
than 80 km/h, you lose two points.

90
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,980
I just got my driver's license.

91
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,100
Stop the car.

92
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,179
Pull over by the side.

93
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:39,200
(Pure and elegant)

94
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,220
Come in.

95
00:05:57,879 --> 00:05:58,980
Mr. Mo.

96
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:00,619
What is it?

97
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,119
I have news for you.

98
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,318
Make it short.

99
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:04,719
So,

100
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,479
Ms. Ling has a new intern.

101
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,599
He is unlike our average interns.

102
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,719
She took her out for work.

103
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,699
She is training the new blood.

104
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:16,300
Is that a problem?

105
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:21,699
But today,

106
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,499
Xia Xiaoqing brought her clothes back.

107
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,420
Ms. Ling didn't go home last night.

108
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:36,660
Did you see it yourself?

109
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:38,819
Or is this just a wild guess?

110
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,939
Well...

111
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,420
Mr. Mo.

112
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,460
I should get back to work.

113
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,699
You have one month
to reach my driving speed.

114
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,239
Why are you following me?

115
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,660
Park the car.

116
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:11,579
Yes.

117
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,540
Come in.

118
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:22,799
Hello.

119
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,340
Hello, Ms. Ling.

120
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:28,900
A little more upwards.

121
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,379
Try a different set.

122
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:46,460
Where is my medicine?

123
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,599
Ms. Ling!

124
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,318
Medicine!

125
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:50,900
It's not here.

126
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,259
It's not here.

127
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,420
Ms. Ling!

128
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:55,739
What happened?

129
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:58,900
Pollen could cause an asthma attack.
Don't you know she has asthma?

130
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,579
