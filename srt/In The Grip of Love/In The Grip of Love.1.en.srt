Xu Yiqing.

3
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,460
You've been gone for three years.

4
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:23,979
You could've said goodbye.

5
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,580
Tell me if you're alive.

6
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,859
Talk to me in my dream.

7
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:39,140
Not you.

8
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:41,979
Not you either.

9
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:52,940
Is this...

10
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,260
It's you!

Miss?

13
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:20,679
Very well.

14
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,940
Let's try a different way.

15
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,500
We always sat in this spot.

Stay still.

19
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:57,580
Xu Yiqing.

20
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:00,580
You're finally back.

21
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:07,999
(Three years ago, Xu Yiqing the person in charge
of the Yingqiao project)

22
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,739
(caused the company
to lose one billion yuan.)

23
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,660
(As Xu Yiqing's fiancée at the time,)

24
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:14,758
(what role did you play?)

25
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:16,619
(And now there are rumors saying)

26
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:19,100
(you're with Mo Sanxing for his money.)

27
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,019
(Yu Xiling, what kind of person
are you really?)

28
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:57,420
It's stifling in here.

29
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,380
Don't go.

(What did I do last night?)

33
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,579
(Nice body.)

34
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,699
(I didn't lose much.)

35
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,559
(November 22, 2001)

36
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,900
(Quite a handsome guy.)

37
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:13,159
(Born in 2001?
He is nine years younger than me!)

38
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,179
(But I...)

39
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:18,379
(At least he is not underage.)

40
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,139
We can leave together.

41
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:41,540
(How did I end up
with a cute guy like him?)

42
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:48,479
We are all adults.

43
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,359
It happened with our consent,

44
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,259
right?

45
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:54,039
I was forced to stay with you.

46
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:54,799
Huh?

47
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,719
You got it all wrong.

48
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,059
Last night was...

49
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:59,059
You want me to take responsibility?

50
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,619
Give me your contact.

51
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,139
Thanks for last night.

52
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:18,379
(What did I say?)

53
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,259
I mean,

54
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,460
I transferred you the hotel fee.

55
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,819
But it was only 380 yuan.

56
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,660
You transferred me 10,000 yuan.

57
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:32,460
Buy yourself some candy.

58
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:41,780
Look, this is our...

59
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:43,999
Good morning, Mr. Mo.

60
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,860
Mr. Mo.

61
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:47,540
- Good morning, Mr. Mo.
- Mr. Mo.

62
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:54,619
I am here for Ms. Ling.

63
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:56,340
She is...

64
00:06:56,879 --> 00:06:59,059
I can relay your message to her.

65
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,020
Xiling is rarely late to work.

66
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:07,559
Never mind, carry on.

67
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,499
I'll wait inside.

68
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,980
Did I overdo it with the acting?

69
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,460
I must erase the memories.

70
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,559
Xiaoqing.

71
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,719
Hello? Ms. Ling?

72
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,259
When will you reach the office?

73
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,540
What's wrong?

74
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:39,660
Mr. Mo is waiting in the office.

75
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,799
Tell him I won't be coming
to the office.

76
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,179
I have to supervise the photo shoot.

77
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,838
But Ms. Ling,

78
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:47,398
the task is scheduled
for this afternoon.

79
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:50,939
Tell Producer Zhang to start right away.

80
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:57,939
I saw Yu Xiling.

81
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,300
Everything went well.

82
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:07,259
But she didn't fit the profile we got.

83
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:11,638
Ms. Ling.

84
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:12,838
Our models

85
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:13,838
couldn't make it today.

86
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:16,078
Producer Zhang got a better model
of the same age.

87
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:16,799
Have a look.

88
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,078
We can still make changes.

89
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:20,900
Never mind. Tianye focuses
on youthfulness and sports.

90
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,780
A clean sunshine boy will do.

91
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:26,599
Welcome, Ms. Ling.

92
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,939
This way, Ms. Ling.

93
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,919
Hello, Ms. Ling.

94
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,420
Sorry for the trouble.

95
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,678
Sorry for bringing it forward.

96
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,319
We are always ready.

97
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,319
The model just got here.

98
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,479
He is getting ready.

99
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,199
Gu!

100
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,979
Gu! Come over here!

101
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:43,420
Coming! See you around.

102
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:52,038
Get ready!

103
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:52,979
I am ready.

104
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,140
Ms. Ling?

105
00:08:58,559 --> 00:08:59,859
She is Ms. Ling for now.

106
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:04,099
This lady here...

107
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,540
is Ms. Ling.

108
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:12,158
Yes.

109
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:12,758

110
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:15,059
