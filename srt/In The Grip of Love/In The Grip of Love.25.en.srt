3
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:17,960
Mom has just come back.

4
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:20,600
After I find a place in a few days,

5
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:21,960
I'll cook for you.

6
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:24,080
I'll make your
childhood favorite dishes.

7
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:26,869
I haven't tasted

8
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:28,339
your cooking in so long.

9
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:29,440
Yeah.

10
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:32,130
How about

11
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,770
staying at the hotel with me
for a couple of days?

12
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:37,090
This is not necessary.

13
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:39,600
I'm fine living on my own.

14
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:43,360
You stay at your uncle's
place all these years.

15
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:46,810
Even though you didn't return often
and always stayed at the school hostel,

16
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:48,699
at least if something happened,

17
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,589
someone was there for you.

18
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:52,149
When your Grandpa passed away,

19
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:53,680
I didn't fight with him
over the company.

20
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:56,109
I always thought,
he's my younger brother.

21
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:58,640
I just let him do whatever he wants to.

22
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:00,549
Even when

23
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:03,269
he changed the name to Sanxing Group,

24
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,330
I didn't say much.

25
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:08,410
But, what a pity.

26
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:10,749
That company was grandpa's hard work.

27
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:13,570
I can't let Uncle ruin it like that.

28
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:15,970
Having you join Sanxing

29
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:19,520
was for you to investigate Yingqiao.

30
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:22,850
Is there any noticeable progress?

31
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:24,570
Mom,

32
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:27,059
Yingqiao was sold

33
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,189
during its golden period.

34
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:30,339
The project head, Xu Yiqing,
embezzled funds,

35
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,619
causing the project to stop.

36
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:32,880
I think

37
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:34,909
Tianye's current situation

38
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:36,490
is almost similar.

39
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:40,410
So, was Xu Yiqing

40
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:44,210
a scapegoat or an accomplice?

41
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,360
It's uncertain.

42
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:48,499
But, after Xiling joined the board,

43
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,669
the first thing she did

44
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:52,050
was restart the internal audit
from back then.

45
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:53,419
However, the audit results

46
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:56,280
showed no issues in the accounts.

47
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:57,749
Uncle was meticulous

48
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,160
at this.

49
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:02,880
So, you can't find any evidence?

50
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:06,490
But, I found out

51
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:09,789
that Tang Xiao, a shareholder
in Lingkang Group,

52
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:12,949
is likely holding shares
on behalf of uncle.

53
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:14,699
They collaborate

54
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:19,810
and use indirect holding shares
to expand their control over Sanxing group.

55
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,410
This is my speculation.

56
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:26,789
We must obtain solid evidence

57
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:28,410
to convene a board meeting

58
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:31,760
and remove Mo Sanxing
from his president position.

59
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:34,509
Now that I'm back,

60
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:35,970
I'll handle this from now on.

61
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:39,130
You and Yu Xiling just stay out of it.

62
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:53,040
Mo Lan returned quietly this time.

63
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:58,600
It seems like

64
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:00,600
she's planning to stay long-term here.

65
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,720
Mo Lan visited An Jing

66
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,250
and also the company recently.

67
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,600
Why hasn't she contacted you?

68
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:22,480
Even you can tell this.

69
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:28,200
Perhaps it's not the right time
to seek me out yet.

70
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:32,760
So, you will just
pretending not to know?

71
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,480
Let's not act hastily.

72
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:46,859
Mom, I get to go now.

73
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:47,970
Sit down.

74
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:56,370
Let's talk about Yu Xiling.

75
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:01,040
I know you like her,

76
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,949
but one thing you need to understand.

77
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:05,579
Anyone who could convince Mo Sanxing

78
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,899
to willingly transfer 3% of shares

79
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,600
and propose her to join
the board of directors

80
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:13,480
must not be simple.

81
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:15,509
Mom,

82
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:16,749
the rumors about Xiling

83
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,389
were all spread by uncle.

84
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:20,869
He wants Xiling to be suspected

85
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:21,869
and mistrusted,

86
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,509
so he can swoop in as the hero.

87
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:24,459
He's used the same tactic

88
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:26,880
on eight women before her.

89
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:28,629
You knew that.

90
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:29,930
You still doubt her?

91
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,880
You trust her that much?

92
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:34,749
I understand

93
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,290
your concerns about Xiling.

94
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:38,200
But, I'll prove to you

95
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:40,080
that my choice is correct.

96
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:42,949
I don't have any perceptions.

97
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,629
I'm only concerned

98
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:47,139
about how she affects Sanxing and you.

99
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:49,000
You're my son.

100
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:52,269
I don't want you making
decisions you'll regret.

101
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:54,690
Mom, I trust her.

102
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:57,250
I hope you'll trust my choice too.

103
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:00,810
I get to go first.

104
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:21,170
You have a key, don't you?

105
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,829
So, do you mean

106
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:26,760
I can come whenever I want?

107
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:30,490
Over-interpreting.

108
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:34,170
Then, give me an appropriate

109
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,490
interpretation of that.

110
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,400
Just its literal meaning.

111
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:41,730
How was it?

112
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:44,170
How was your conversation with your mom?

113
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:47,779
Oh, the usual topic.

114
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:50,200
Loving mom and a filial son.

115
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:52,000
Did she badmouth me?

116
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,250
Yes.

117
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,290
Yes.

118
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:00,869
Yes?

119
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:03,080
You're so honest, huh?

120
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:09,880
Yu Xiling,

121
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:13,440
let's renegotiate our dating agreement.

122
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:29,610
Clause 1, Party A: Yu Xiling.

123
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:30,829
Party B: Gu Zhaohe.

Clause 1, Party A: Yu Xiling.
Party B: Gu Zhaohe.

125
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:35,610
Both willingly sign this agreement.

126
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,810
This is signed voluntarily,

127
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,690
without any coercion whatsoever.

128
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:43,370
I now realize how much
indifferent I must've seemed

129
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:46,080
when I proposed the agreement.

130
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:50,640
Be serious! No laughing!

131
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,699
Clause 2: Under no circumstances,

132
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,269
may either party

133
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:59,339
lie to or deceive

134
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:00,339
the other.

135
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:02,810
Complete honesty is required.

136
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,130
Agreed.

137
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:08,539
Clause 3: No matter
how serious the conflict is,

138
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:10,069
neither party

139
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:12,339
can lightly suggest breaking up.

140
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:13,509
If breached,

141
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:15,690
Party A bears no responsibility,

142
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,269
and Party B must unconditionally

143
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,610
comply with any demand from Party A.

144
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:22,490
Did your mom say something to you?

145
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:26,170
This clause is fine too.

146
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:27,949
Clause 4,

147
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:29,189
if the parties

148
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:31,339
separate due to
unavoidable circumstances...

149
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:33,050
I will comply with any terms.

150
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:41,429
No matter what your mom told you,

151
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:43,080
we'll face

152
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:46,290
any issue together. Don't worry.

153
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,490
I intend

154
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:56,400
to reassure you,

155
00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:00,400
but somehow it's you reassuring me now.

156
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:04,050
That's the benefit
of dating an older woman.

157
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:07,520
You'll never face problems alone.

158
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:09,520
I will settle it.

159
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:31,890
Xu Yiqing,

160
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,240
were you an accomplice?

161
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:37,989
Mr. Mo, the rumors spread
within the company

162
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:40,810
about Ms. Ling not acknowledging
her father have sparked a lot of gossips.

163
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:44,440
It affects her credibility.

164
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:46,600
The scene created by Li Daogang

165
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:50,650
can only affect her to this extent.

166
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:56,360
Xiling is smart.

167
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,690
A slight reminder is all she needs.

168
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:04,570
As for Zhaohe...

169
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:11,480
Got it, Mr. Mo.

I just applied for a transfer.

That's not the same.

176
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:47,139
It looks like a lateral move,

177
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:49,650
but you're becoming a director
in the Marketing Group A.

178
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:52,840
This guarantees a better future than
being an assistant to the president.

Who knows, you might
even become 'Director Xia' someday!

Xiaoqing, if you become Director Xia,

186
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:06,120
you must not forget me.

187
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,360
You'd better get back to work.

00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:23,019
Xiaoqing, don't you want a celebration?

190
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,890
You'll be transferred
to another department soon.

191
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,059
Alright, forget it.

192
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:31,410
Oh, Xiaoqing, later...

193
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,749
We get to go first.

194
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:38,600
Be safe when you go home.

195
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,080
Goodbye.

196
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,650
Let's go.

197
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:55,389
Miss Xia, I'm...

198
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:56,440
I know you.

199
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:00,290
There's something I want
to discuss with you.

200
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:05,480
You intend to leave
your role as Ms. Ling's assistant

201
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,539
because you don't want to see her

202
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:10,650
and Gu Zhaohe together.

203
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:14,440
But, the best revenge
would be substituting her.

204
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:17,570
Gu Zhaohe is young.

205
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,059
He's in a phase

206
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:22,269
where he admires successful

207
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:24,360
and mature women.

208
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:26,320
If someday,

209
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:28,389
you're as capable as Yu Xiling,

210
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:30,010
I believe

211
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:32,930
you could capture
Gu Zhaohe's attention too.

212
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:35,690
I can see

213
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,299
that Gu Zhaohe likes Sister Ling

214
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,170
not because of that.

215
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,120
Plus,

216
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:43,560
I don't have the courage
and capability like Sister Ling.

217
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,589
I've been wanting
to resign a long time ago.

218
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:47,080
But, are you willing to accept this?

219
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,389
Are you willing

220
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:51,269
to watch them being lovey-dovey

221
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:53,709
and happy while you're in pain?

222
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:55,360
Of course not!

223
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:58,690
But, what can I do?

224
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:03,200
I don't want to become
someone he dislikes.

225
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:07,570
Wu Jiang,

226
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:11,530
what are you trying to say?

227
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:14,410
The company thinks

228
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:17,890
you deserve a better position.

229
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:19,349
These years,

230
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:21,179
you've been underutilized

231
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:23,200
working for Ms. Ling.

232
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:26,200
We should focus
on nurturing your talent.

233
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:29,720
I think, soon,

234
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:32,720
you'll outperform Ms. Ling.

235
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:37,010
Is this suggested by Mr. Mo?

236
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:42,440
It's a rare opportunity.

237
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:44,770
It's not easy to find jobs now.

238
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:47,349
It's even rarer to meet a leader

239
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:48,770
who values talent, like Mr. Mo.

240
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:51,120
There are so many graduates each year.

241
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:53,200
How many actually make it?

242
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:54,600
Of course,

243
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:56,709
if you're wise,

244
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:57,899
you'll know

245
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:01,880
how to show your gratitude to Mr. Mo
for recognizing and nurturing your talent.

246
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:16,010
Are you alright?

247
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:19,899
You're slower than me now, huh?

248
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,690
Xia Xiaoqing wants to meet me.

249
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:23,629
What for?

250
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:26,240
I have no idea. She said it was urgent.

251
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:27,480
We need to meet now.

252
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,320
Let's go together.

253
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:33,960
She wants to meet you, Mr. Gu.

254
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:37,360
There you go again...

255
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:41,109
She must be looking for you for work.

256
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:42,650
This is the working principle.

257
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:47,010
Don't worry. I'll wait for you
at home after the jog.

258
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,240
Zhaohe!

259
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:12,600
What's so urgent, Xiaoqing?

260
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:16,869
Wu Jiang came to see me earlier.

261
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:18,200
Wu Jiang?

262
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:20,600
Why is he meeting you?

263
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,899
The other day, when you took me home,

264
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,179
someone photographed us.

265
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:26,589
They're using it as evidence,

266
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:27,920
asking me to accuse you

267
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:33,400
of a sexual relationship with me
in exchange for a transfer.

268
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:38,659
We were together that day,

269
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:40,179
but we only discussed

270
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,899
your career path.

271
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:42,869
There's

272
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:44,240
nothing else happened.

273
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:46,659
If it's just some photos,

274
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:47,939
it proves nothing.

275
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,589
Yeah, that's the truth.

276
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:52,059
But, I think they've got

277
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:53,810
more tricks to defame us.

278
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:57,360
So, Zhaohe, I think we should...

279
00:14:58,820 --> 00:14:59,659
Hello,

280
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:01,059
Xu Yiqing is online now in the blog!

281
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:01,989
Is he still alive?

282
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:02,779
I saw it.

283
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:04,360
Don't panic.

284
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,890
Okay, wait for me.

285
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,240
Xiaoqing,

286
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:10,869
I've got something urgent now.

287
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:13,989
What you mentioned is just a small matter.

288
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:15,570
I need to leave now.

289
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:17,600
