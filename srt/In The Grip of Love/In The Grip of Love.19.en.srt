Director Li.

4
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:15,070
The Li Foundation has been

5
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:16,940
a tremendous financial help to us.

6
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:22,100
Last time I met you,
I thought you were something special.

7
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:24,100
Mr. Gu, I'll be counting on you
in the future.

8
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:26,070
Mr. Kang, you're too kind.

9
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:27,500
I still have much to learn from you.

10
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:28,070
Not at all.

11
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:29,750
I'll take my seat first.

12
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:30,940
All right.

(Signing Ceremony for Tianye Investment)

14
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:34,510
We meet again, Ms. Ling.

15
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:37,550
I'll be having deeper collaborations
with Sanxing moving forward,

16
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:39,470
so we'll be seeing
each other more often.

17
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:40,740
Mr. Kang.

18
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:43,270
Mr. Mo has always taught me

19
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:44,700
that in business,

20
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:47,190
it's better not to make
overconfident statements.

21
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,060
Pride invites loss,
humility gains favor.

22
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:54,420
Please take your seat, Mr. Kang.

23
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,230
We'll start
the signing ceremony shortly.

24
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:01,940
Why isn't Jinxi here yet?

25
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:04,700
No idea.

26
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:06,500
She hasn't replied to my messages.

27
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:08,550
Are we sure we can count on her?

28
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:11,310
You wait here.

29
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:12,830
I'll step out and call her again.

30
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:18,470
Please pick up!

31
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,340
Tianye has never
lost money up until now.

32
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:35,030
How much longer do we have?

33
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:50,390
Mr. Kang is the most
renowned investor in our industry.

34
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:52,110
For the Tianye brand to gain his favor

35
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,860
is a great honor for Sanxing Group.

36
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:58,390
Let's officially begin
the signing ceremony.

37
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:03,190
Starting without me?

38
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:10,790
Who is this?

39
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:15,110
I'm the representative of Xinlan Group.

40
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:17,300
Hello.

41
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:19,390
Pleasure.

42
00:02:20,148 --> 00:02:22,838
Ah, it's Ms. Bian Jinxi,
the daughter of Xinlan Group's

43
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:24,180
Ms. Wu.

44
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,453
I've heard

45
00:02:25,454 --> 00:02:27,550
you just graduated from a prestigious
international business school.

46
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:29,860
Have you graced Sanxing Group
with your presence today

47
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:31,700
for some sort
of observation and learning?

48
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,300
I'm here to talk acquisition.

49
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:38,900
Xinlan Group is willing to offer twice

50
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,740
the price Mr. Ling proposed to acquire

51
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,300
the operating rights of Tianye.

52
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:49,630
Here is Xinlan Group's project proposal

53
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:51,900
and business plan

54
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,350
for Tianye's future operations.

55
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:56,230
I believe in terms of qualifications

56
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:58,110
and understanding of Tianye,

57
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:01,670
Xinlan Group is slightly superior
to Mr. Ling.

58
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:11,110
Mr. Mo, are you reconsidering?

59
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:14,740
Don't let short-term gains

60
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,900
affect our long-term partnership.

61
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,980
Sanxing Group's signing ceremony

62
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:22,110
isn't some child's game.

63
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:23,390
Gu Zhaohe,

64
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:27,510
I've usually turned a blind eye
to your antics.

65
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:29,110
But can you please realize

66
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:30,580
the gravity

67
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:31,550
of this occasion?

68
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:34,950
We're not joking here, Mr. Mo.

69
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:42,350
As long as the board members
present approve,

70
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:45,580
Xinlan Group can sign
with Sanxing immediately.

71
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,180
Since Xinlan Group's terms are better

72
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,670
than Ankang's,

73
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:54,510
from the company's perspective,

74
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:57,300
why not consider them, Mr. Mo?

75
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:01,700
Or is there

76
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:05,980
some private relationship with Mr. Kang

77
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:08,670
influencing your judgment?

78
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:11,950
That shouldn't be the case, right?

79
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:17,270
Just joking. Don't take it seriously.

80
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:32,660
Since there are objections
to the signing ceremony,

81
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,220
let's postpone it.

82
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:52,510
Two vice presidents of Sanxing

83
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:54,750
working out of a shared office?

84
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:00,460
You're finally making progress.

85
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:04,830
This is good.
Proximity breeds opportunity.

86
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:06,990
You're close, all right.

87
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:08,700
Hold on.

88
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,100
How many years has it been?

89
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,140
Can you please fix
your chronic tardiness?

90
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,020
You really scared us back there!

91
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:16,660
In art,

92
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:19,100
the protagonist
always shows up at the last

93
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:19,950
critical moment.

94
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:21,950
Dramatic entrance, turning the tide.

95
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,950
How about it? Wasn't I heroic?

96
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:27,020
This is my new "white knight" look.

97
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:27,780
Don't mess it up.

98
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:29,390
Get up.

99
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:30,870
Get up!

100
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:31,990
Stingy, you won't even
let me sit on the sofa.

101
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:34,340
Why did you say that?

102
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:36,780
What if Mo Sanxing agrees

103
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:39,070
to such unrealistic terms?

104
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:41,630
We've already analyzed it, haven't we?

105
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:45,580
His goal isn't to sell Tianye

106
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:48,070
but to profit from acquiring it.

107
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,270
So no matter how high Xinlan's offer is,

108
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,540
as long as it doesn't benefit him,

109
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:54,220
he won't agree.

110
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:57,100
You still have your habit
of taking reckless risks.

111
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:59,270
I call it "confidence in victory".

112
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:02,510
Nice liquor collection you have here.

113
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:06,190
I've fulfilled my part of the deal.

114
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:07,070
What about your part?

115
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:09,630
We'll take care of it, don't worry.

116
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:13,190
Care for a drink?

117
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:17,950
Thanks for helping us today.

118
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,510
"Us"?

119
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:24,510
Have you thought about

120
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:25,510
my advice?

121
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:28,140
What advice?

122
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:29,390
None of your business.

123
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:35,780
I'll pass on the liquor.

124
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:38,390
Get over here.

125
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:42,390
When the two of you

126
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:44,950
officially become a thing,
then you can treat me

127
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:46,510
to a drink together.

128
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:48,190
I'm off!

129
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:54,190
Has she

130
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:56,750
always been like that?

131
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:58,900
I don't know her.

132
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:32,870
This is tea I've saved
for seven or eight years.

133
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:34,660
Please try it, Mr. Kang.

134
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:37,310
Your tea is too bitter.
I can't get used to it.

135
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:42,990
After this commotion,

136
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:46,870
let's put the acquisition
on hold for now.

137
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:49,580
I've never seen you

138
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:52,340
this unsettled before.

139
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,750
I've warned you
that Yu Xiling is suspicious,

140
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:57,460
and look what happened.

141
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:59,950
I'll deal

142
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:02,990
with the company's internal issues
as soon as possible.

143
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:05,750
Mr. Mo, business is like a battlefield.

144
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:08,270
Being indecisive
for the sake of personal feelings

145
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:09,700
isn't like you.

146
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:11,660
An acquisition
should've been a good thing,

147
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:15,390
but now it's come to this.
What do you suggest we do?

148
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:20,020
What should we do?

149
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:21,830
Why don't you enlighten me,

150
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:23,780
Mr. Kang?

151
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:28,460
Just let it go for now.

152
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,780
It's not worth stirring up more trouble

153
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,870
for such small gains.

154
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,510
It would be embarrassing for both of us.
