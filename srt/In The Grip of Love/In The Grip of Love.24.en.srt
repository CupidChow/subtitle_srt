=Episode 24=

3
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:25,240
Thank you.

4
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:30,810
Why the rush?

5
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:32,960
Take your time.

6
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:36,450
Mr. Mo,

7
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:39,570
you promised me something.

8
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:41,600
What things?

9
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:44,240
Money.

10
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,890
I urgently need it now.

11
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:52,360
I understand.

12
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:57,240
But, we typically follow

13
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:58,850
contract for this matter.

14
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:03,160
A contract?

15
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:06,000
We don't have a contract.

16
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:09,640
Mr. Mo,

17
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,610
so if we don't have a contract,

18
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:15,210
the things you promised
before doesn't count?

19
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:22,690
Of course!

20
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:28,330
But, a verbal agreement
is still an agreement.

21
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:33,280
Yet, the way you handled it was...

22
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:35,330
What's wrong with my way?

23
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,800
I intend to help you

24
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:41,139
while letting others see

25
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:43,280
what kind of person Yu Xiling is,

26
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:46,570
as she doesn't even
care about her father.

27
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:50,770
But your actions

28
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:53,139
only deepened

29
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:55,080
her bond with Gu Zhaohe.

30
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:57,800
Mr. Mo,

31
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:02,250
I followed your instructions exactly.

32
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:05,570
You should at least
give me a little for that.

33
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:06,579
You see...

34
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,810
Calm down.

35
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:13,810
I, Mo Sanxing,

36
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:17,160
hate owing favors to others the most.

37
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,480
There's a way for you

38
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,040
to get that money.

39
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:25,899
There are a lot of people

40
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:28,810
saw Gu Zhaohe hit you, right?

41
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,530
Hmm,

42
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:33,850
I know some doctors

43
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:36,440
who can issue a report for you.

44
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,410
Whatever amount you want,

45
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:41,880
you can have it soon.

46
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:50,850
Good!

47
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:52,250
Good!

48
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:55,760
That's a great idea.

49
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:01,789
How have you been these past few years?

50
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:02,880
Pretty good?

51
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,850
Still as beautiful as ever.

52
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:08,899
Are you speaking
against your conscience?

53
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:11,629
Hey, I'm praising you.

54
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:13,250
Oh, it's wasted.

55
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:15,419
You've taken good care of yourself.

56
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:16,810
Really?

57
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:20,160
Have you met Yu Xiling?

58
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:21,570
Yes,

59
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,810
she's competent.

60
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:27,069
It is evident
from the results of Tianye.

61
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:28,760
If you have such a high regard for her,

62
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:30,899
then why did you speak

63
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,810
so harshly to her?

64
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:36,410
Just because she's capable,

65
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:39,810
I have to be more cautious and beware.

66
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:43,739
Sanxing Group is currently
in its critical reform period.

67
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,739
If Yu Xiling can't be trusted,

68
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:47,650
she has to be eliminated.

69
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:51,810
You've changed a lot these years.

70
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:53,389
I thought

71
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:55,699
you were still the naive sister

72
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:58,090
who handed over Sanxing Group
to her younger brother.

73
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:03,069
The Yingqiao Project has
already lost ten billion.

74
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:05,040
If I stay indifferent,

75
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,019
it won't just be

76
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,880
about money anymore.

77
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:13,629
I have faith in your
judgments on business matters.

78
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:14,699
But if it comes to

79
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:17,080
Zhaohe's personal life,

80
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:19,629
I suggest you don't meddle in it.

81
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:21,200
Zhaohe

82
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:22,779
has lost

83
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:24,869
his ability to judge things rationally.

84
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:26,610
He's now impulsive and reckless.

85
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:28,459
He's never

86
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,570
handled things so aggressively before.

87
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:33,429
Doesn't that just show

88
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:35,760
how much he genuinely likes Yu Xiling?

89
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:39,200
After all, he's a male.

90
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:42,389
He needs to undergo
all the processes for growth.

91
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:43,880
Just let it be!

92
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:46,389
You shouldn't confuse company matters

93
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:49,189
with his personal relationship problems.

94
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:53,000
Yu Xiling's presence represents Zhaohe.

95
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:55,570
It's no longer just a personal matter.

96
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,579
If Yu Xiling can't earn my trust,

97
00:04:58,580 --> 00:04:59,869
to be frank,

98
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:02,370
I won't support their relationship.

99
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,570
I can't convince you.

100
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:06,579
Come on.

101
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:07,069
Let's drink.

102
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:08,000
Here we go.

103
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,949
This wine doesn't have the kick.

104
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:15,200
Let's order something stronger.

105
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:18,099
Your drinking capacity
is still the same as before!

106
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,019
Just order it!

107
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,309
Today,

108
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:22,000
I'll drink with you until we're drunk.

109
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:24,570
This wine reminds me of a saying,

110
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:28,570
"Without strong ability,
pure compassion is not working."

111
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:30,000
It's your turn!

112
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:33,250
I'd rather order a softer one.

113
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:34,509
I believe

114
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:35,699
that at my age,

115
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:39,050
it's best to overcome
harshness with softness.

116
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:45,000
Are you

117
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:47,440
being too clingy?

118
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:50,200
Didn't you say

119
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:52,749
not to leave your side for a moment?

120
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:53,760
So, I do.

121
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:58,290
I was talking about this.

122
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:01,640
This?

123
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:06,170
Are you jealous of a pillow?

124
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:10,200
Fine, since you have a pillow now,

125
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:14,370
and it happens that my classmates
invited me for a hang-out,

126
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:18,050
I'm leaving now.

127
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:22,200
Okay.

128
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:26,840
They said it's an all-nighter.

129
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:28,760
All-nighter?

130
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,019
That's great!

131
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:31,440
I'm going now.

132
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,170
What's wrong?

133
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,320
You're not going anymore?

134
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:47,730
You should spend some time

135
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:52,440
talking to your mom properly.

136
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:55,050
Don't make her upset.

137
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:58,699
My mom is a very straightforward person.

138
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,960
Actually,

139
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:03,130
I understand her intention.

140
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,760
After all, I was
introduced by Mo Sanxing

141
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:09,000
to join the board of directors.

142
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,730
She's wary of me

143
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:14,320
for the sake of you.

144
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:17,050
She should respect you
if it's for my sake.

145
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:22,440
There are some things

146
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,690
you won't understand

147
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:29,130
at your age.

148
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:30,050
I...

149
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:32,440
It's just like us now.

150
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:38,290
I'm 31, and you're 22.

151
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:43,200
Everything feels wonderful.

152
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:45,840
We believe

153
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:49,250
that love can conquer everything.

154
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:52,400
But, by the time

155
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:54,250
when you are 40,

156
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:57,490
I'm old.

157
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,320
Will I be the one

158
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:03,200
who steals your best years?

159
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:06,490
Your mom

160
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,640
didn't mean to embarrass me.

161
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:13,490
She just doesn't want you

162
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:18,730
to have no choice

163
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,520
when you regret it.

164
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:27,880
Is this why you didn't agree

165
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:30,520
to be with me before?

166
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:34,720
Hmm.

167
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:38,320
It's not totally because of that.

168
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,480
I won't regret it,

169
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,810
nor will I let you regret it.

170
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:57,960
Are you feeling down?

171
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:03,170
I want to eat candy.

172
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:13,080
I told you, I want to eat candy.

173
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:51,389
Doctor, please take a look at me.

174
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:53,360
It hurts so much!

175
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:55,179
Did they hurt me seriously?

176
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:56,269
Please have a check on me.

177
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:57,320
Please have a seat first.

178
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:00,770
Sigh.

179
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:04,440
It's Wu Jiang who asked me here.

180
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:11,709
Is your family here with you?

181
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:12,530
Family?

182
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:15,440
I have no family. I'm alone.

183
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:20,480
Could you inform your family
member to come over?

184
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:22,899
Don't you understand what I said?

185
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,139
I told you,

186
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:25,960
I'm alone.

187
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:28,170
Didn't Wu Jiang tell you?

188
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,139
Just write me a medical report.

189
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:32,899
Make it serious.
The more serious, the better.

190
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,299
I have to be responsible
for the report I write.

191
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,269
If your family isn't here,

192
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:38,539
you can come back next time.

193
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:40,360
But, it's better to come back
as soon as possible.

194
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:42,229
Next time when you come,

195
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:43,650
you don't need to register again.

196
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,229
Just come straight to me.

197
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:45,779
Wait.

198
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:47,299
What's wrong with you?

199
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,229
I ask you,

200
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,659
can you even diagnose the patient?

201
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,650
What are you doing?
Are you messing with me?

202
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:52,930
Please calm down.

203
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:54,139
I couldn't stay calm.

204
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,299
Just say it.

205
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,600
Based on this condition,

206
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:00,080
it could be pancreatic cancer.

207
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:03,989
What did you say?

208
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:05,690
It could be pancreatic cancer.

209
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:18,360
Are you alright?

210
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:20,200
Sir, are you alright?

211
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:22,659
Since Tianye's last marketing upgrade,

212
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:24,600
the sales have
significantly increased again.

213
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:27,269
Now, it secures the top spot

214
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:29,080
among domestic sports brands.

215
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:31,050
Xia Xiaoqing deserves
much credit for this.

216
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:33,360
With her current abilities,

217
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:36,269
she's capable of serving as the
director of the marketing department.

218
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:39,109
Yeah, when I sent her home last time,

219
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:40,349
she told me

220
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:43,170
she wanted to transfer
to the business department.

221
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:47,200
When you sent her home...

222
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:48,269
Yes.

223
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:49,960
Did you feel like

224
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:54,170
she was talking to you because of work,

225
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:58,320
or because she wanted
to chat with someone she likes?

226
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:02,840
Where did you two talk?

227
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:04,770
Downstairs

228
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,299
or upstairs?

229
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,570
Of course, upstairs.

230
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:10,899
Are you going to ask next,

231
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:13,810
was it inside or outside the house?

232
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,840
Could you stop calling me?

233
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,240
Girl,

234
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:28,570
I...

235
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,170
I have pancreatic cancer.

236
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:38,570
Who is it?

237
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:46,659
Li Daogang.

238
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,080
He's asking me for money.

239
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,570
He claims that he has cancer.

240
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,059
He even sends me a picture.

241
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:57,690
I think he stole it online.

242
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:01,770
You don't know him.

243
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,080
He used to be like this.

244
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:06,810
He tricked me into going to the hospital,
saying he was on his last breath.

245
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:08,810
However, when I arrived,

246
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:11,650
I was surrounded by
the debt collectors in the room.

247
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:13,019
But this is

248
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:15,360
a lab report from
An Jing First People's Hospital.

249
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:17,170
It doesn't look fake.

250
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,960
Should you just go and check it out?

251
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:24,960
It has nothing to do with me
even if he dies.

252
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:41,010
Do you think it's the two of them?

253
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:44,650
Ms. Ling? Mr. Gu?

254
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,810
Oh wow, it is you two!

255
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:52,539
Get off work?

256
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,299
Yeah.

257
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,410
You're holding hands now, huh?

258
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:00,709
If I'd known, I would've started a bet
of when the two of you get together.

259
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:02,010
It's too late now.

260
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:04,299
But honestly, we noticed long ago.

261
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,690
The way you two glanced at each other
in the office are obvious

262
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:09,770
like we were invisible.

263
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:10,989
Speaking of that,

264
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:12,890
now in our Tianye project team,

265
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,939
we've got two vice presidents
and two directors.

266
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,059
We're invincible now!

267
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:17,939
Do you still want to eat together?
I'm leaving.

268
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,480
Of course, I want! No, wait...

269
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:20,650
Wait.

270
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:22,240
We're leaving for dinner first.

271
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:23,530
Wait.

272
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,240
Xiaoqing.

273
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:28,890
See? It wasn't that hard.

274
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:32,770
Let's go.

275
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,410
Hello?

276
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:58,010
Are you with Yu Xiling now?

277
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:00,389
Yes.

278
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:01,960
Come see me right away.

279
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:06,050
Make sure you come alone.

280
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:07,360
