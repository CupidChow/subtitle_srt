3
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:16,879
Yes! Get moving!

4
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:18,940
Yes. That was a good move.

5
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,740
Make the movements more exaggerated.

6
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:22,659
Come on. You're doing great.

7
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:26,019
Yes. Great job.

8
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:28,119
Yes. Wonderful.

9
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,379
A different pose.

10
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,558
Put on a more reserved smile.

11
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:34,220
(Yu Xiling: This model is no good.)
Yes. Look at the camera.

12
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,019
Okay, good work.

13
00:00:37,159 --> 00:00:38,199
Lean against the lamppost.

14
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,260
We have a problem with the model.

15
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,739
The hairstyle is no good.

16
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:53,038
(Not the hair, but the person.)

17
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,798
Xiaoqing. No, I mean, Ms. Ling.

18
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:56,979
We double-checked the makeup.

19
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,459
Yes.

20
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,599
But we have a different model now.

21
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,559
We need a different style too.

22
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,518
This is the difference

23
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:06,340
between product photos

24
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,700
and a customer's review.

25
00:01:07,879 --> 00:01:08,839
You have a point.

26
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,019
Slick it back.

27
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,399
Not bad.

28
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,899
No, I mean...

29
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,238
Well,

30
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:19,940
the poses seem a bit off.

31
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,420
(How can you be this bad
at criticizing?)

32
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,300
(Don't look at me.)

33
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:26,899
No.

34
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:28,420
It's...

35
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,580
The figure is no good.

36
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,559
(This is on me.)

37
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,099
(I sent a monkey
to do a woman's job.)

38
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:37,999
Well...

39
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,940
He is too handsome!

40
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,318
Repeat after me.

41
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:54,759
The personality is too plain.

42
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,158
He doesn't look organic enough.

43
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,358
He failed to show
the personality of the brand.

44
00:01:58,359 --> 00:02:01,438
We want to show Tianye's quirkiness.

45
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,199
We can't keep using the same template.

46
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,158
I suggest we use

47
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:05,220
a different model.

48
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,638
Xiaoqing...

49
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:14,580
Everybody, let's take a break.

50
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,380
Okay.

51
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:28,179
Xiaoqing, let's stay out of this.

52
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:39,540
Ms. Ling.

53
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,660
Ms. Ling is over there.

54
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,399
The payment code has your name on it,

55
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,660
madam.

56
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:50,860
A namesake.

57
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,660
You're kicking me out.

58
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,198
Is this your revenge?

59
00:02:57,199 --> 00:02:58,660
Work is work.

60
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,700
I am very professional.

61
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:03,860
Okay.

62
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,598
I am very supportive of your opinion.

63
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,598
Tianye is a new brand that focuses
on urban fashion

64
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,059
and outdoor equipment.

65
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,899
We need to show the inner
characteristic of the product.

66
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,980
I agree with Ms. Ling's idea
to overthrow the creativity.

67
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:22,140
Getting a new model

68
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:23,939
is one way to achieve that goal.

69
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:26,999
She says I only need a new style.

70
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,899
We'll do as she says.

71
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,700
Take it off.

72
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:39,140
Take it off.

73
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,059
Enough.

74
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,179
Everyone, get ready!

75
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,079
We're starting again!

76
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:02,820
Okay.

77
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:04,499
Let's carry on.

78
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:42,619
Any news?

79
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,398
Ms. Ling picked up calligraphy lately.

80
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:47,540
It's for mindfulness.

81
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,100
I should start practicing too.

82
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:59,819
Mr. Mo, your handwriting is
already excellent.

83
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,518
Andy?

84
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:03,479
Are you overwhelmed by work lately?

85
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,679
No, it's all part of my job.

86
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,900
I'll ask HR to give you a raise.

87
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:12,398
Thank you, Mr. Mo.

88
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:12,999
Go on.

89
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,939
I should get going.

90
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,739
Carry a file with you.

91
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,179
Sure thing.

92
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:23,239
If you must act, do the whole package.

93
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:27,100
Yes. Mr. Mo, I'll get back to work now.

94
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,679
Ms. Ling, get changed.
I'll fetch the ride.

95
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,078
How long has Mr. Mo been waiting?

96
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:33,220
Do you know why he is here?

97
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:36,020
Nope. He left when I said
you were at the studio.

98
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:39,518
Very well. I'll deal with him
as soon as possible.

99
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:41,020
Yeah.

100
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,799
By the way,

101
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,438
tell the driver

102
00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:51,799
to wait at the bathroom entrance.

103
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,340
I need to use the bathroom first.

104
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:54,540
Hand me the clothes.

105
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:56,540
One more thing.

106
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,078
Go back to the studio
and supervise Gu Zhaohe.

107
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:00,799
If he won't cooperate,

108
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,499
tell Producer Zhang to pressure him.

109
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,579
Ms. Ling, the car is here.

110
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:07,919
She wanted the car
to wait in front of the bathroom.

111
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,499
And then, supervise the photo shoot.

112
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,699
Sure, I'll be there now.

113
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:22,379
Am I hallucinating?

114
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:37,780
Ms. Ling, the car is here.

115
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:45,780
Ms. Ling, do you know the model?

116
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,540
He's the last person I want to see.

117
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:54,200
(Gu, Jie, Ben, Shu, Ke,
Gong, Zheng, Qu, Gan, Shi)

118
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,259
Come in.

119
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:03,420
Mr. Mo, you asked for me.

120
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,039
How did the photo shoot go?

121
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,039
It went well.

122
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,278
The team did great.

123
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:09,739
The results fit the branding of Tianye.

124
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:13,699
I knew I could trust you
to take care of Tianye.

125
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:18,499
I know you don't like
dining with others.

126
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,198
So,

127
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:22,900
I brought everything back for you.

128
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,619
I got this
from your favorite restaurant.

129
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,119
Mr. Mo.

130
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,420
I'm full.

131
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,198
Very well.

132
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:35,559
Glad to hear that.

133
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,518
I'll get it again
when you feel like having it.

134
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:38,980
From the same restaurant.

135
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:41,980
Mr. Mo.

136
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,799
The launching event of Tianye

137
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,159
is in countdown.

138
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,638
If there's nothing else,

139
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,460
I must get back to work.

140
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:50,278
Let the others

141
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:52,699
take care of the trivial tasks.

142
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:55,660
I don't want you to overwork yourself.

143
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,100
Mr. Mo, how nice of you.

144
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,540
I'll do my best to serve you.

145
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,638
Health comes first, okay?

146
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:03,278
I must get going.

147
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:04,460
The everyday work...

148
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:09,460
Take care and rest well!

149
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,780
Come in.

150
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,799
Ms. Ling, the intern is here.

151
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,980
A handsome one.

152
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,420
Let him in.

153
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:38,099
Hello, Ms. Ling.

154
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:41,020
