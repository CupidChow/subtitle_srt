00:00:20,259 --> 00:00:21,320
This way, please.

4
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:24,740
I'm sorry for being late, Ms. Ling.

5
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:25,819
Have a seat.

6
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:32,500
What did you want to see me for?

7
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:36,500
Thank you for coming
to my rescue yesterday.

8
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,319
That's an expensive suit.

9
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,300
It will come to use
when you start working.

10
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:48,038
Sure.

11
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:49,140
Thank you.

12
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:51,099
I have something for you as well.

13
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:55,140
Here you go.

14
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,099
Add in some bear bile powder
into your drinks.

15
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,599
It maintains your liver's health.

16
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,099
Moreover, it helps you stay sober.

17
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:09,300
Thanks.

18
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:17,318
Oh, right. My friend's company is hiring
for a position that suits you well.

19
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:19,140
I've send them your resume.

20
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,639
In terms of

21
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,639
salary, benefits, and future prospects,

22
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,379
this new job is better
than your current one.

23
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,140
Ms. Ling.

24
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,420
As far as I know, I'm not done
with my internship yet.

25
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:38,980
I just think

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,420
that you're still young.

27
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:43,140
You could use a better job opportunity.

28
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,839
Thank you for your kind thought.

29
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,700
However, I prefer my current job.

30
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:55,819
Okay.

31
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,078
You shouldn't be drinking.

32
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:04,238
It's not good for your health.

33
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:06,860
I'm used to having
a drink or two every night.

34
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,019
If you truly wish
to show your gratitude,

35
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,619
come with me, then.

36
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,679
We'll do something more fun

37
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,478
than drinking at night.

38
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:24,260
Let's go.

39
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:27,038
(Who would have
their sneakers with them)

40
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:28,878
(and ask the other
to go for a night run?)

41
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,279
(What a typical straight dude.)

42
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,380
(Help!)

43
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:33,339
I've had some drinks.

44
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,080
But you haven't had much.

45
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,380
Just the right amount
to promote your blood circulation.

46
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,840
Will you be responsible
if I end up having an asthma attack?

47
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,660
Sure, I will.

48
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:47,079
Here's the thing.

49
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,399
An appropriate amount of exercise

50
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,918
helps your medical condition.

51
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,019
Well,

52
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,878
a night run can enhance
your basal metabolic rate

53
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:55,519
and strengthen your lung capacity.

54
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,120
It relieves stress,
making you fall asleep more easily.

55
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,239
Didn't you say
you had a hard time doing so?

56
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,179
Okay.

57
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,420
Wait a minute. Come back.

58
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:08,380
First of all,
we will do a warmup together.

59
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:12,339
One, two, three, four.

60
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,179
Make sure your upper arm
and shoulder are parallel.

61
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:22,359
Here, feel your chest as it expands.

62
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,700
Go.

63
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,080
(I must have had too much to drink)

64
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,200
(that I ended up saying yes
to this night exercise session.)

65
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,260
Let's switch to another one.

66
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:34,179
It's a leg lunge stretch. Come on.

67
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,219
Put your left leg forward.

68
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,300
Stretch it.

69
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:41,499
One, two, three.

70
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,019
(What's so fun about all this?)

71
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:49,019
Straighten your spine.

72
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,718
You have to feel the spine
while you're on it.

73
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:52,559
(This is getting fun.)

74
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,478
Straighten it.

75
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:54,459
That's right.

76
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:56,959
Also, feel your thigh and calf

77
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,459
as you stretch them.

78
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,638
Straighten it.

79
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:00,700
That's right...

80
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:17,619
Okay, just a second.

81
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,958
You're breathing the wrong way.

82
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,599
You need to breathe with your abdomen.

83
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,638
Breathe in with your nose and breathe
out with your mouth. Make sure it's rhythmic.

84
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:26,860
Here, feel it.

85
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:29,739
Breathe in with the nose.

86
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:32,939
Breathe out with the mouth.

87
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,739
(I can feel his abs.)

88
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,980
(Is this my lucky day?)

89
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,379
What's on your mind?

90
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,100
I want to sleep with you.

91
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:53,939
Well, I'm getting sleepy.

92
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,340
You've just had 20m.

93
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,799
It's always harder in the beginning.
Hang in there.

94
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,139
You can do it. Go!

95
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,619
Ouch!

96
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:10,420
What's wrong?

97
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,660
My leg hurts.

98
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:16,340
In what way?

99
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:18,619
Let me have a look. Which part of it?

100
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:22,819
My ankle, sole, and instep.

101
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:24,980
It hurts everywhere.

102
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:34,139
If you were really in such a great pain,
you wouldn't be standing here.

103
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:35,540
Yes.

104
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:43,860
Fine. Give me a minute.

105
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:53,739
Here's a lollipop for you.

106
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:55,660
You've done a great job tonight.

107
00:05:57,279 --> 00:05:58,420
Thank you for last night.

108
00:05:58,519 --> 00:06:00,020
Here's a sweet for you.

109
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:03,540
Gu Zhaohe.

110
00:06:06,219 --> 00:06:07,039
Stop right there!

111
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:07,900
Why are you...

112
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:10,499
You've gone overboard!

113
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:15,479
Didn't you say you wanted a lollipop?
So, why are you mad?

114
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,780
I've just sprained my ankle.

115
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,020
I'm not falling for that again.

116
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,340
Take this.

117
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:31,780
Is it here?

118
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,559
I'll get up first.

119
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,259
Here.

120
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,460
I'm heading home to get some rest.

121
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,739
Let me send you home.

122
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:46,540
It's okay, I can manage.

123
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:51,240
Are you going to do so with that leg up?
You'd end up spraining the other leg.

124
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,939
