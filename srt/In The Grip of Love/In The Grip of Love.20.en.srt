00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:20,230
Say something.

4
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:24,070
Well, you two grew up together.

5
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:25,300
You know each other well.

6
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,270
There's nothing wrong about it.

7
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:28,780
As I said,

8
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:30,980
we don't have feelings for one another.

9
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:31,790
Shush.

10
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:34,550
I'll hear it from Zhaohe.

11
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:39,510
I'm sorry, Ms. Wu.

12
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:42,340
It's indeed not Jinxi's fault.

13
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:44,910
I truly hold someone to heart.

14
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:46,340
Yes.

15
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:52,340
You're into someone else, right?

16
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:54,940
Where is she?

17
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:57,060
Introduce her to me.

18
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:03,110
What a petty trick.

19
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:05,270
Drop the act already.

20
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:06,550
Mom.

21
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:08,550
Mom.

22
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,220
Your makeup is smeared.

23
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:15,310
Are you trying to drive me away again?

24
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:18,550
You two should discuss
about what to do after this.

25
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:20,860
I'm serious, your makeup is
smeared. Look.

26
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:21,620
Stop it.

27
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:22,220
Your false eyelashes have come off.

28
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:25,030
You're not leaving
until I know the reason.

29
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:26,980
Well,

30
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:28,470
just look at your eyelashes.

31
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:30,110
They've come off.

32
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:31,140
After all,

33
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,110
you represent the image of Xinlan Group.

34
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:34,670
So you have to make sure
you always look good.

35
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:35,310
For real?

36
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:36,500
The restroom is that way.

37
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:37,550
Go now.

38
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:38,500
Forget it.

39
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:40,470
Watch your step, Ms. Wu.

40
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,910
How could you ask my mom out alone?

41
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,700
Well, something happened.

42
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:53,910
Did she reject you?

43
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:55,750
That shouldn't have happened.

44
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:58,140
What do I do now?

45
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:05,190
Yu Xiling?

46
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:10,300
Do you know me?

47
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:12,670
How could I not know

48
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:13,980
Mo Sanxing's right-hand man?

49
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:15,300
Besides,

50
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,790
my daughter almost acquired your brand
several days ago.

51
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:21,670
So you're aware of it all.

52
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:23,110
Well, let's have a meal

53
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:25,140
and a good chat soon.

54
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:29,580
It's okay.
I actually came to see you today.

55
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:32,860
What do I do now?

56
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:37,420
What?

57
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:42,300
Xiling?

58
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:44,110
Here you are.

59
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:45,110
Ms. Wu...

60
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:46,230
I know.

61
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,020
Have a seat,

62
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:48,700
Xiling.

63
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,020
She's Yu Xiling,
and she works in your company.

64
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:53,300
She was your superior when you were
pretending to be an intern.

65
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:55,350
And she's now your colleague, right?

66
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:57,830
Ling.

67
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:01,390
What did you want to see me for?

68
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:02,140
I...

69
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:02,860
It's nothing.

70
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:04,860
Xinlan helped us

71
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,950
with the acquisition days ago.

72
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,690
I'd like to express my gratitude
to you two.

73
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:11,670
Of course Jinxi couldn't say no to it

74
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:14,550
when Zhaohe asked for her help.

75
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:18,180
Zhaohe's mom and I think
they make a good match.

76
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,390
But they think otherwise.

77
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,390
She says they're not into one another.

78
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:23,950
And he says he's into someone else.

79
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:26,390
We don't make a good match at all, Mom.

80
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:29,300
In my opinion, Xiling and Zhaohe are
more suitable for one another.

81
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:31,270
What nonsense are you talking about?

82
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,510
I heard

83
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:35,390
that Ling and Mr. Mo are a couple.

84
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:38,270
Like you said, it's just hearsay, Mom.

85
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:39,900
So stop playing matchmaker.

86
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,700
Fine. Oh, right, Ling.

87
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,670
Is Zhaohe close to

88
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:47,110
any female employee in your office?

89
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:49,070
He claims to hold someone to heart.

90
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,460
I don't believe him at all.

91
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:53,670
You should stop asking Xiling
about that, Ms. Wu.

92
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:56,900
In fact, my loved one is
sitting right here.

93
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:01,300
Well, well. He wouldn't have admitted
to it if I hadn't forced him.

94
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:02,670
He just fancies Jinxi.

95
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:04,110
I fancy Yu Xiling.

96
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:05,670
Wow!

97
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:08,580
I told you so.

98
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:12,180
Besides, Ms. Wu,

99
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:15,310
I've proposed to Xiling.

100
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:18,700
Why didn't you...

101
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:22,340
You didn't let them
explain themselves, Mom.

102
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:25,020
Well, Zhaohe was afraid

103
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:25,900
that you would tell Ms. Mo about this.

104
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,100
And Ms. Mo wouldn't agree to it.

105
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:30,100
So he decided to make a move beforehand.
Am I right?

106
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:31,630
Indeed.

107
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:35,070
Now that he's proposed to her,

108
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:36,460
I no longer stand a chance, Mom.

109
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,990
There goes your dream.

110
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,700
I understand. From today on,

111
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:45,020
I will no longer force you
to get married.

112
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:45,990
Really?

113
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:48,900
Yes. My son-in-law candidate

114
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:52,020
has been stolen.

115
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,430
I have no reason to panic.

116
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,310
You are the best, Mom.

117
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,220
Do you want to join Xinlan?

118
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:02,830
Of course I do, as long as you don't
force me to get married.

119
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:04,780
I would love to spend time
with you all the time.

120
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:06,310
Aren't you running away from home again?

121
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:10,780
No...

122
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:13,510
Eat up.

123
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:20,780
I knew you'd be there today.

124
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:25,870
What if

125
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:27,700
I hadn't shown up?

126
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:36,310
Of course you'd do Bian Jinxi
the favor, no?

127
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,220
I could've said no to it.

128
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,580
But you ended up showing up.

129
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:00,430
Well, I've done my part here.

130
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:02,100
I'm returning the ring to you.

131
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,990
I bought this ring long ago.

132
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,100
You should be aware
of my intention here.

133
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:01,390
I'm sorry.

134
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:12,020
I got this for you, after all.

135
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:15,220
It doesn't belong to anyone else

00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:41,660
Why are fussing over

189
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,060
Gu Zhaohe's graduation ceremony?

190
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:45,940
It's none of your business.

191
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:46,710
Wait...

192
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:49,020
Ms. Ling.

193
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,420
Why didn't you knock?

194
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:56,940
What's it?

195
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:00,540
I'd like to apply for a day off, Ling.

196
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:03,230
For what reason?

197
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:06,470
It's a personal matter.

198
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:09,470
Yet it's very important to me.

199
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:13,820
Sure, but hand in
the marketing plan on time.

200
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:15,710
Yes. Thank you, Ling.

201
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:19,020
Love you!

202
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:23,710
I'm telling you.

203
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:26,270
Here's a tradition
of An Jing Sports University.

204
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:27,540
During the graduation ceremony,

205
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:28,750
one will gift the class ring
with their name engraved on it

206
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:30,110
to the one they're confessing to.

207
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:31,780
If that person accepts the confession,

208
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:33,350
they will wear that that school ring
on their shirt.

209
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,940
That means they hold that person
to their heart.

210
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:38,350
A confession during graduation
leaves no regret in one's life.

211
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,660
Considering how charismatic
Gu Zhaohe is,

212
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,350
I'm sure he will receive
numerous confessions.

213
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:43,750
Well, here's the thing.

214
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:44,750
If that person is bold enough

215
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,990
to confess to Mr. Gu
in front of all the other graduates,

216
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:48,230
do you think he will accept it?

217
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:48,750
Of course he will.

218
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,540
Not only is Xiaoqing pretty,

219
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,940
but she's also a fighter.

220
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:53,350
Don't you have work to do?

221
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:03,660
What's the matter with her?

222
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:04,630
She's being short-fused today.

223
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:05,750
Shush.

224
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:11,820
