3
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:50,510
It's time to get off work.

4
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:51,620
Let's leave together.

5
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:52,790
I have an appointment.

6
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:53,940
With whom?

7
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:56,300
None of your business.

8
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:07,860
Ms. Ling.

9
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:10,340
What's the matter?

10
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:11,550
Why can't we discuss it at the office?

11
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:15,670
It's a personal matter.

12
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:22,390
Why are you drinking so much?

13
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,310
Hmm...

14
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:29,910
Ms. Ling,

15
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:33,500
are you and Gu Zhaohe...

16
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:36,220
okay?

17
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:40,220
Me and him?

18
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:42,110
What could happen between us?

19
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:45,580
I don't think I ever offended him

20
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:48,500
back when he was an intern.

21
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:52,750
You know that's not what I meant.

22
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:03,500
Gu Zhaohe told us
that no matter who we are,

23
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:05,140
whenever we go out
on fieldwork with you,

24
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:06,510
we must carry this.

25
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:13,070
He's even

26
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:16,950
put these things in the
pantry and the restroom.

27
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:22,740
He buys you breakfast
and coffee every morning,

28
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:26,070
waits for you to get off
from work before he does,

29
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:29,070
and even during meetings,

30
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:33,550
his eyes are only on you.

31
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,790
I see all of this.

32
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:50,460
Sister Ling,

33
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:53,700
you and him...

34
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:58,900
You really have

35
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,110
no feelings for him?

36
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:06,420
None.

37
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:10,740
Really?

38
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:13,110
Then, I can rest assured and pursue him.

39
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:22,180
Drink it slowly.

40
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:23,420
I'm fine, Sister Ling.

41
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,830
If there's nothing else,
I get to go now.

42
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:32,300
Don't go, Sister Ling!
Stay and drink a bit more with me!

43
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:35,140
Here you go.

44
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:39,830
Thank you, Sister Ling.

45
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:34,340
What a coincidence!

46
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:36,870
You just got off from work?

47
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:40,780
Why are you working until so late today?

48
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,190
You really have

49
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:04,220
no feelings for him?

50
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:05,630
None.

51
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:07,270
Really?

52
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,310
Then, I can rest assured and pursue him!

53
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:26,020
(Have a candy when you're unhappy.)

54
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:28,870
I didn't add sugar to my coffee.

55
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:32,310
Now it does.

56
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:35,310
When you're unhappy,

57
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:36,630
have a candy.

58
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:43,100
This looks nice.

59
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:47,070
These mugs are a matching set.

60
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:49,990
Don't tell me you're about to say

61
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:51,990
something cheesy like,
"A cup for a lifetime."

62
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:53,460
It's not my cup of tea.

63
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:00,220
So, you've already
thought that far ahead?

64
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:07,220
Are you planning
to be with me for a lifetime?

65
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,540
Put me down!

66
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:15,990
Gu Zhaohe told us
that no matter who we are,

67
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:17,780
whenever we go out
on fieldwork with you,

68
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:19,190
we must carry this.

69
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,950
What a coincidence,
are you taking out the trash?

70
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:51,020
Oops!

71
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,100
Oh no!

72
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:55,220
I didn't bring my key with me.

73
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:57,070
The door is locked now.

74
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:58,430
Uh...

75
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:12,430
Wait!

76
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:22,950
I can't get into my house. Can you...

77
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:25,630
let me stay at your place for a night?

78
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:35,700
I was planning to throw this away.

79
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:45,870
Now it's gone.

80
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:48,660
You can't bear to see me
sleeping on the street, right?

81
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:58,020
Xiling,

82
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,460
these are all my things.

83
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:05,140
How can you simply throw them away?

84
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:11,070
From now on, outside of working hours,

85
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:14,510
let's just be strangers.

86
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:20,430
We can't even be friends?

87
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:21,270
Yes.

88
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:22,340
Why?

89
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:24,870
Unless you still like me.

90
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:29,700
If you don't, you'd not care about it.

91
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:36,230
Think whatever you want.

92
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:58,820
(Hello Scenic Area Shuttle,
Designated Parking Spot)

93
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,940
Is this what you're looking for?

94
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,940
You checked my social media, right?

95
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,940
You indeed care about me.

96
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:18,020
That means you still like me.

97
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,300
Could you give me one more chance?

98
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:24,870
Let's start over
and get to know each other again.

99
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:28,660
I promise I won't lie to you again.

100
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:30,630
Xia Xiaoqing likes you too.

101
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:32,710
Maybe you should

102
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:34,390
give her a chance,

103
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:35,660
or reconnect

104
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:37,660
with someone else.

105
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,180
You really want me

106
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:41,990
to move on to someone else that badly?

107
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:02,540
Look

108
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,390
at them today.

109
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,540
They seem just like a couple in love.

110
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,350
They seem to be a perfect couple
wearing the matching outfits.

111
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:09,180
Yeah.

112
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,590
I don't think so.

113
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:13,990
What a coincidence!

114
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:14,990
How come I never

115
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:16,820
met you in that coffee shop?

116
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:19,420
I always buy coffee there.

117
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:22,060
Maybe you're always late.

118
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:24,180
It's you who came too early.

119
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,660
Fine. What are you having?

120
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:28,020
Americano.

121
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,020
Mine too.

122
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:30,780
What a coincidence!

123
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:31,870
I'll get back to my place first.

124
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:32,350
Alright.

125
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:51,270
What are you laughing at?

126
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:53,350
One more minute and you'll be late.

127
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:03,140
These are the recent updates
of the situation from each department.

128
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:04,350
There's one more thing

129
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:06,140
I'd like to discuss with everyone.

130
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:09,940
Three years ago, the Yingqiao Project
was abruptly suspended.

131
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:11,870
Due to its complexities,

132
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,270
the board at the time

133
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:15,750
canceled the internal
audit of the project.

134
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:17,230
But I think

135
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:18,630
we should face

136
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:20,630
our previous failed projects properly

137
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,230
and learned from it

138
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:23,590
to avoid making the same mistakes again.

139
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:24,870
So, I propose

140
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:26,270
we restart

141
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:29,540
the internal audit process
for the Yingqiao Project.

142
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,590
Xiling has just joined the board

143
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,660
and already spotted the issue.

144
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:43,780
If every employee of Sanxing Group

145
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,350
had this level of awareness

146
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:47,630
and execute their
supervisory roles well,

147
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:49,990
I believe the Sanxing Group

148
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:51,780
would develop faster

149
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:53,420
and better.

150
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:55,540
Regarding Xiling's proposal,

151
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:58,900
I'm going to be the first
who agree with it.

152
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,230
Agreed.

153
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:24,110
Why are you so rush

154
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:25,470
to restart the internal audit?

155
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:26,590
Mo Sanxing

156
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:28,590
ensured that there was
nothing left to trace back then.

157
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:30,350
Do you think you can

158
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:31,270
figure out the issue easily now?

159
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:33,940
My decisions are on my own.

160
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:36,940
Why do you have to judge me
in such a condescending way?

161
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,540
I just wanted to help you.

162
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:41,660
But if this is

163
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,940
what you mean
by giving yourself closure...

164
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:46,820
Gu Zhaohe, I'm not like you.

165
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,660
You have unparalleled
connections in Sanxing.

166
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:51,470
You can become the Vice President
whenever you want.

167
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:53,590
When you wanted a seat on the board,

168
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:55,780
you could just get that easily.

169
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:58,390
I'm different.

170
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:00,420
I got to where I am today on my own.

171
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,140
I've had to ingratiate myself

172
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:02,990
and endure humiliation.

173
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:04,270
You wouldn't understand.

174
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,060
What do you mean, Yu Xiling?

175
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:08,590
So, do you mean I'm just nothing

176
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:10,390
more than someone
who relies on connections?

177
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:12,020
Just because my mom is Mo Lan,

178
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:15,420
does that mean all my efforts
should be disregarded?

179
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,990
I've never denied your efforts.

180
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:22,230
And I'd appreciate it
if you didn't deny mine.

181
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:37,110
What's going on?

182
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:38,420
Who knows?

183
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:26,900
After an internal audit,

184
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,510
we found that the Yingqiao Project's

185
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,990
financial records were clear

186
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:32,140
and all approval
procedures were complete.

187
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:34,660
There were no illegal
or unethical practices.

188
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:36,350
The decision to halt
the Yingqiao Project

189
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:38,350
was made by the company's
upper management at the time,

190
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,774
(Sanxing Group, Yingqiao Project)
based on long-term

191
00:15:39,776 --> 00:15:40,750
(Internal Audit Meeting)
development considerations,

192
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,540
and was reached
through discussions and voting.

193
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,230
Okay, great!

194
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,300
That's great news!

195
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:53,300
Xiling, do you have any other questions?

196
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:04,140
No, Mr. Mo.

197
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:32,470
It's even faster than I expected.

198
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:34,590
I need to figure out
a way to obtain the contract.

199
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:42,300
I already found it.

200
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,590
Mr. Gu is indeed
having great connections.

201
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,780
I was in a bad mood yesterday.

202
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:58,180
My words were a bit harsh. I apologize.

203
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,540
How realistic you are, Ms. Ling!

204
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:05,750
Forget it.

205
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:08,510
At least in the company,

206
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:11,470
I still hold enough value for you

207
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:12,540
to speak kindly to me.

208
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:13,910
We don't need to be strangers.

209
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:16,100
Time's running out.

210
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:17,750
We have to quickly come up with a way

211
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:20,300
to hinder Mo Sanxing from signing
the agreement with Ling Kang.

212
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:23,150
Alright.

213
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,230
Gu Zhaohe,

214
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:32,470
maybe

215
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:36,060
we can go back to being friends.
