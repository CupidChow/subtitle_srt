00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:23,800
Xia Xiaoqing!

4
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:26,659
What a peculiar scene!

5
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:28,330
Shut up!

6
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:31,170
Since when did you
start coming in this early?

7
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:44,320
Is it because of Gu Zhaohe?

8
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:47,939
Why don't you just change your mind?

9
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:48,829
Stop fixating on him.

10
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:50,600
Can't you like someone else?

11
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:53,240
You only cared about him all day long...

12
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:57,240
Hey you,

13
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:00,570
why are you so worked up?

14
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:11,210
Driver, please stop
by the roadside ahead.

15
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:12,829
What are you doing?

16
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:14,210
I'm still here.

17
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:17,130
Let's skip coffee today.

18
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:20,920
Let's go to the office together.

19
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:26,410
You are

20
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:28,520
not afraid anymore?

21
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:31,610
I was afraid,

22
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:33,490
but now no more.

23
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:36,690
I've thought it through.

24
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,920
Why bother pretending?

25
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:47,520
Mr. Mo, will Li Daogang
turn against us?

26
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:50,949
Relax, just wait and see.

27
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:53,850
This is just to remind Yu Xiling

28
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:56,000
not to let the sweetness of love

29
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:57,859
make her forget who she is

30
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:59,970
and how she got into
the board of directors.

31
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,640
Xiaoqing, stop thinking about it.

32
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:22,720
Ms. Ling,

33
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,850
are you okay?

34
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,880
I'm fine, I just bumped into something.

35
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:40,570
Xiaoqing,

36
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:43,570
come with me.

37
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,970
What's going on?

38
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:01,720
Xiaoqing,

39
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:06,440
I'm sorry.

40
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:14,530
You're in a relationship
with Gu Zhaohe now, right?

41
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:18,320
Yes.

42
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:25,440
Sister Ling,

43
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:27,509
it's you who told me yourself

44
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:29,320
that you didn't like Gu Zhaohe.

45
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:38,320
Before this,

46
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,530
I thought

47
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:48,320
it was impossible for me
to be with him, so...

48
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:58,669
You both liked
each other long ago, right?

49
00:03:58,670 --> 00:03:59,389
Then, why did you

50
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:01,720
keep encouraging me to pursue Gu Zhaohe?

51
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:06,760
Sister Ling,

52
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,320
I've always seen you as my sister.

53
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:13,320
But, what do you treat me as?

54
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:16,840
A catalyst for your love?

55
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,400
Or

56
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,099
did you use me to highlight your charm

57
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,440
while making me a fool?

58
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:33,170
I didn't mean it in that way.

59
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,570
Your crying makes me...

60
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,509
If you're not guilty,

61
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:48,130
then why did you come to me?

62
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:56,730
This place is pretty nice.

63
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:58,320
How fancy it is!

64
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:00,880
Miss,

65
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:03,269
do you know Yu Xiling?

66
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,400
No, I don't.

67
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:06,640
How can you not know her?

68
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:08,099
Miss,

69
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,219
do you know Yu Xiling?

70
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,930
I don't know her.

71
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:13,520
How can you not know her?

72
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:14,760
Ridiculous!

73
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,200
Yu Xiling!

74
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,290
Yu Xiling!

75
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:19,880
Come out!

76
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,050
Hello, sir, who are you looking for?

77
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,320
Who are you looking for?

78
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:25,749
I tell you,

79
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,269
I'm looking for your head,

80
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,339
Yu Xiling.

81
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:29,570
Do you have an appointment?

82
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:32,269
Who do you think you're talking to?

83
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:35,069
- Who do you think you're talking to?
- Sir, please don't get physical.

84
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:36,579
I'm her father!

85
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:38,760
Do I need an appointment to meet her?

86
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:39,960
Xiaoqing.

87
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:42,960
I'm so sorry.

88
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,250
Xiling,

89
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:53,000
there's a sudden occasion.

90
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:57,490
Hurry up!

91
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:12,749
Yu Xiling, come out!

92
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,509
Come out!

93
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:16,610
You shameless woman!

94
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:17,779
Yu Xiling!

95
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:18,930
Li Daogang!

96
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:20,930
What are you doing?

97
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:26,200
Let go of me!

98
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:28,219
Yu Xiling,

99
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,880
not only

100
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:33,579
are you keeping a toy boy,

101
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:36,019
but you've also brought him here
into the office!

102
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:36,749
Am I correct?

103
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,339
How shameless you are

104
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,810
doing all the embarrassing things.

105
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:41,629
Everyone, please come and take a look.

106
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:42,779
Say that again.

107
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,069
You keep a toy boy

108
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,139
but not support your father.

109
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:47,960
I raised her since she was small.

110
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:50,139
Yu Xiling, I tell you...

111
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:51,080
Li Daogang,

112
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:52,309
you drove my mom to death.

113
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:53,640
Now you want to do the same to me?

114
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:54,880
Stop it!

115
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:56,440
Mrs. Gu.

116
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:03,400
Mom!

117
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,400
Call the police.

118
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:14,320
Whether you want to spend
a few days in detention,

119
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:16,539
or sit in prison for a few years,

120
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:17,690
it's up to you.

121
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,400
Call the police?

122
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:24,290
Go ahead.

123
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:26,579
He hit me just now.

124
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,509
Remember,

125
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:28,659
I have a heart disease.

126
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:30,339
I'll go to the hospital now.

127
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:32,069
If I'm hospitalized,

128
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:34,440
you'll need to compensate
my medical bills!

129
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,880
Alright, I understand.

130
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:53,019
Mr. Mo, Mo Lan is here.

131
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,490
Li Daogang wants to see you.

132
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:00,949
Let's go.

133
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:01,880
Alright.

134
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:05,800
(Calligraphy Words)

135
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,960
Addicted to alcohol!

136
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:26,290
Mom,

137
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:28,370
don't you drink normally?

138
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:41,570
Auntie,

139
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:42,749
can I

140
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:46,360
bring Zhaohe to check his wrist first?

141
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:48,410
It's unnecessary.

142
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:54,059
You can't even handle

143
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,840
your family affairs?

144
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:59,770
Bring such scandals
into the company is unacceptable.

145
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,570
How did someone like you

146
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:13,360
even become the
Vice President of Sanxing Group?

147
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:14,600
Mom,

148
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:17,469
Li Daogang is her biological father,

149
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:19,720
but they severed ties years ago.

150
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:23,290
Severing ties with her
own biological father?

151
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:26,930
That's heartless.

152
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:32,050
He's the one who keeps harassing her!

153
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:34,349
Look at the injuries on Xiling's head!

154
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:36,179
Then settle it once and for all.

155
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:39,240
If she can't, it just
proves she's incapable.

156
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:42,440
Mom,

157
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:45,059
next time when you return,
could you let me know in advance?

158
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:46,139
You see me...

159
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,320
See you?

160
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:52,320
What do you have that worth seeing?

161
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:55,589
Gu Zhaohe, I haven't seen you for years,

162
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:59,120
and you've become
so foolish and impulsive.

163
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:00,650
Mom,

164
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:03,650
can't you only criticize me at home?

165
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,960
If I hadn't come back,

166
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:14,050
you'd be so obsessed with Yu Xiling

167
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:17,720
that you even forget your own name.

168
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:21,810
Let's leave here.

169
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:32,770
