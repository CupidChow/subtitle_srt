(Adapted from the novel "In the Grip of Love" by Bo Le)

00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:12,970
=Episode 6=

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:16,199
Are you talking about Xu Yiqing?

5
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,679
You mentioned this name
on the day you were drunk.

6
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:25,239
Do you

7
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,320
still love him?

8
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,159
Love is not a necessity.

9
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,640
I love to work more.

10
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,759
The more effort you put in,

11
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:44,439
the more returns you get.

12
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,039
You can tell me all your grievances.

13
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,320
All right.

14
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:56,280
Your overtime work is over.

15
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,920
Let's go.

16
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:03,180
(Beauty Mo)

17
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:09,159
Yu Xiling.

18
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,319
We haven't jogged tonight.

19
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,760
I'm not doing it.

20
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,900
(Xu Yiqing, Blog, The happiest thing
is to see your smile every day.)

21
00:01:31,239 --> 00:01:32,760
Xu Yiqing.

22
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,120
You are finally back.

23
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:40,459
(Xu Yiqing, Vice General Manager)
(Yu Xiling cannot let go)

24
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:41,519
(Xu Yiqing, Vice General Manager)
(of Xu Yiqing's disappearance)

25
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,439
(She is not willing to believe
that Xu Yiqing ran off with the money.)

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,359
(It seems like)

27
00:01:46,359 --> 00:01:49,359
(she knows nothing
about the Yingqiao project.)

28
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:00,040
Mom.

29
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:06,280
I think Yu Xiling is not involved

30
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,639
in Uncle's transfer
of the company's assets.

31
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,540
(Jog at night together
and chase after what the heart wants)

32
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:31,280
Come in.

33
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,800
Ms. Ling, do the new shoes fit you?

34
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,000
What about eight tonight?

35
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:39,879
Huh?

36
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,960
The meeting will begin soon.

37
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:48,840
I'll head over immediately.

38
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,759
I'll be going there first.

39
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,700
(New alarm)

40
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,360
Are these the shoes?

41
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:01,360
It's great.

42
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:02,400
Not bad. Yes.

43
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:05,639
It feels different on the feet
after the redesign.

44
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:06,870
(Tianye, Yeyu)

45
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,120
Ms. Ling, I'll begin then.

46
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:08,840
Sure.

47
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:11,840
This is

48
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,639
the sports shoe
that Tianye will be launching.

49
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:15,599
Its name is Yeyu.

50
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,719
The tagline is "Jog at night together
and chase after what the heart wants".

51
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,919
Currently,

52
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:22,120
this model has gone through
a few improvements.

53
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:23,400
In the next few days,

54
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,039
all of you can share...

55
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:26,159
What about eight tonight?

56
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:27,840
Your opinions about wearing them.

57
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:29,759
I believe we still have a chance

58
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:30,439
to perfect the shoes

59
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:32,199
before the launch of the product.

60
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:33,840
(Tianye, Yeyu)

61
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,400
Ms. Ling,

62
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:36,759
The name of the shoe
and the tagline were voted

63
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:38,560
by our department.

64
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,319
Do you have anything to say about it?

65
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:46,719
(Jog at night together
and chase after what the heart wants)

66
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:48,240
Who designed this tagline?

67
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:04,199
Very good.

68
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,319
Who designed

69
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:13,000
the typesetting of this card?

70
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,439
Ms. Ling, it was me!

71
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:18,839
There goes your bonus for this month.

72
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:20,000
Huh?

73
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:28,740
(Alarm)

74
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,900
(Jog at night together
and chase after what the heart wants)

75
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,120
Do you think I can't find you

76
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,319
after you changed your phone number?

77
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:21,639
You are late.

78
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:26,160
Didn't you say
you want to jog together at eight?

79
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:27,279
Let's go.

80
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,360
Not bad.

81
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,639
I like how it wraps around the feet.

82
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:57,759
It's indeed different
after the improvement.

83
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,800
The bounce is better.

84
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:06,240
Aren't you tired?

85
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:11,319
You are young indeed.

86
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,480
You are young too.

87
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,839
Can you still go on?

88
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,319
Not at all.

89
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,439
I've failed my physical education
since I was young.

90
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:19,079
Forget it.

91
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:20,279
An athlete like you

92
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:21,319
will never understand.

93
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,439
Let me tell you.

94
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:23,839
A suitable amount of training

95
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:25,920
will improve
your cardiopulmonary functions.

96
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,600
It'll be good for your asthma.

97
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,720
You can start

98
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,120
changing your habits from now on

99
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,560
as long as you are willing to do it.

100
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:34,240
Take a step forward

101
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,439
and you'll arrive at the tunnel's exit.

102
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:45,560
Yes.

103
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,279
Let's continue.

104
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:48,879
Be careful.

105

All right.

110
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:14,800
First stage of night jogging.

111
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,680
The first to arrive
at the convenience store

112
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,360
pays for the other person.

113
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,199
I'm going!

114
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,480
Come after me!

115
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,079

Breathe in.

122

Didn't we agree for the winner to pay?

123
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,079
I already paid.

124
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,360
Think of it

125
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,759
as thanking you

126
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,160
for completing the test
of Tianye's shoes

127
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,519
and also

128
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,160
a new beginning.

129
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:21,800
That's all you're buying me?

130
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,360
Do you want
a Michelin-star meal instead?

131
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:28,800
Fine.

132
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:32,679
This is delicious.

133
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,759
Ms. Ling.

134
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,480
Gu Zhaohe?

135
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,639
Why are you two here?

136
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:43,919
Well...

137
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:44,840
Hmm...

138
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:46,159
The shoes will be launched soon.

139
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:47,480
We are here

140
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,000
to do a test.

141
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:52,080
That's right. A test.

142
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,519
Gu Zhaohe,

143
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:55,600
are there any part of the shoes
that needs to be improved?

144
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,559
No more.

145
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,879
The shoe's error has been adjusted.

146
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:00,320
Yes.

147
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,879
Can you give me the test report tonight?

148
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,759
What?

149
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:04,320
Yes.

150
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,720
I can.

151
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,720
Go back then.

152
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:08,600
You should rest early too.

153
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:10,879
Goodbye.

154
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,279
Goodbye.

155
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:54,080
I'm strapped for cash.

156
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:56,240
Give me a million yuan.

157
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,320
I have no money.

158
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,440
What?

159
00:09:58,519 --> 00:09:59,240
You have no money?

160
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:02,159
How can you have no money
when you're already the vice president?

161
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:05,799
If you don't have money,
no one else has it.

162
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:08,879
Who are you?

163
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,080
Are you all right?

164
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,159
I'm fine.

165
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:16,399
Brat!

166
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,200
How dare you hit me!

167
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,080
Li Xiaolan!

168
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:22,960
Your ex-husband

169
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:25,480
embezzled so much money from the company

170
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:27,519
and you tell me you have no money!

171
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:29,320
You wouldn't even
give your money to your father.

172
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,519
Did you pay a young man instead?

173
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:34,679
Fine, if you won't pay me,

174
00:10:34,919 --> 00:10:35,919
I will

175
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:39,480
tell them all the nasty things

176
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,120
you did in the past!

177
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,000
Shut up.

178
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:44,600
You can be charged
with attempted murder with a blade.

179
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,879
If you threaten her,

180
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,879
you will be imprisoned for life!

181
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:48,960
Do you want to give it a try?

182
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,480
Whatever.

183
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,559
Are you all right?

184
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:06,159
Let's go back.

185
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:07,200
Let's go.

186
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,559
Does it hurt?

187
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,600
Was that man really your father?

188
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:28,960
Yes.

189
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,120
He is a gambling addict.

190
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:34,559
As far as I can remember,

191
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,399
he has always been gambling.

192
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,559
After losing everything he has,

193
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,919
he would even take a loan
or scam others for money to gamble.

194
00:11:44,919 --> 00:11:47,039
My mother was forced to death

195
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:48,840
by loan sharks.

196
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:51,120
The term "gambling addict"

197
00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:52,840
suits him.

198
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,320
He's like a ghost

199
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,840
that wants everyone
to go to hell with him.

200
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,919
Has he been asking you for money?

201
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:07,559
After I graduate,

202
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,600
I changed my name

203
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:12,039
and my phone number.

204
00:12:12,759 --> 00:12:14,919
I didn't expect him to find me again.

205
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,120
Don't be afraid.

206
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,279
I will protect you.

207
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,759
Don't worry.

208
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:34,320
There are many people in hell.

209
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:36,759
My turn won't come.

210
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,080
This brat

211
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:54,200
is not picking up again.

212
00:12:55,559 --> 00:12:56,919
Is he really in a relationship?

213
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:00,840
All right.

214
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,759
Go back.

215
00:13:06,759 --> 00:13:07,080
All right.

216
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:13,399
Hello, Mr. Mo.

217
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:14,399
Xiling.

218
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:15,440
What's wrong?

219
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,360
I passed by your house.

220
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:18,840
You're at my house?

221
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,080
Let me go up and visit you.

222
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,720
Mr. Mo, there's no need to trouble you.

223
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:25,360
It's all right.

224
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,080
I'm already on my way up.

225
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,399
Ah!

226
00:13:29,799 --> 00:13:32,000
Hello? My signal was bad.

227
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:34,879
I've come up already.

228
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:36,360
Why don't I go downstairs to meet you?

229
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:40,039
Talk downstairs?

230
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,399
Sure.

231
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,120
Let's go.

232
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,759
