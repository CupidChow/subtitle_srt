=Episode 17=

3
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:29,390
Not feeling well?

4
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:30,870
Yes.

5
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:35,660
Come on, let me take a look.

6
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:37,590
I don't feel so good.

7
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:38,110
Where?

8
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:39,020
Over here?

9
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:39,660
Yes.

10
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:40,270
Turn your head.

11
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:54,270
I get it.

12
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,150
Mo Sanxing and Lingkang are
about to sign

13
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:00,060
an agreement
for Tianye's distribution rights.

14
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:04,270
The agreement states
that if sales grow rapidly

15
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:07,220
within two years,

16
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:09,220
Lingkang can continue using

17
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:10,670
Tianye's distribution rights
indefinitely.

18
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:12,310
In other words,

19
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:13,340
by acquiring shares later on,

20
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:15,140
Lingkang could

21
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:17,310
end up controlling Sanxing Group.

22
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:19,220
Mo Sanxing

23
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:22,140
wouldn't take that big of a risk.

24
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:26,310
Then, there is only one
logical explanation.

25
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:30,830
Lingkang is only Mo Sanxing's pawn.

26
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:37,670
Lingkang and Xinlan had some agreements.

27
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:41,030
I'll find out what the details are.

28
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:47,110
That's all for today.

29
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:53,060
Are we leaving together?

30
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:06,790
Why are you still here?

31
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:08,700
I was waiting for Gu Zhaohe.

32
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,270
Me?

33
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,300
I sent you a text message.

34
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,740
But you didn't reply.

35
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:23,550
Sorry, I was busy just now.

36
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:24,270
But,

37
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,020
Ms. Ling and I are...

38
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:26,900
It's all right.

39
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:28,950
Xiaoqing has been waiting for hours.

40
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:30,860
You two carry on.
I'll get going.

41
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:32,630
Thank you, Ms. Ling.

42
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:39,070
Could I buy you dinner?

43
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:42,700
Sure.

44
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:45,020
Try this out.

45
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:49,350
Have some yourself.

46
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:09,550
Gu Zhaohe, I really like you.

47
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:11,110
Can I be your girlfriend?

48
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:12,830
I told you.

49
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:15,670
I'm already in love with someone.

50
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:18,980
I bet it's Ms. Ling.

51
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:23,140
Yes.

52
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,510
But you two are not officially
a thing yet.

53
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:27,740
I still have my chances.

54
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:34,510
Xiaoqing,

55
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:38,140
you are a great person.

56
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:41,460
But, you are only a friend to me.

57
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:44,830
You shouldn't waste your time on me.

58
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:48,180
Love is not a waste of time.

59
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:51,420
If I asked you to give up on Ms. Ling,

60
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:52,700
would you do it?

61
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:59,070
If you can wait for Ms. Ling's response,

62
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:00,230
I can wait for yours.

63
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:03,390
I have all the patience I need.

64
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:05,700
Besides,

65
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:07,020
falling in love

66
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:09,110
could take the right moment.

67
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:10,630
Maybe there will be a moment

68
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:12,630
you realize how great I am,

69
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:14,340
that we are meant to be.

70
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:19,510
Cheers.

71
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:29,660
Actually,

72
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,100
you can put your energy

73
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:33,310
into your work.

74
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:36,070
It's much better than wasting it on me.

75
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:37,310
I mean it.

76
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,100
But loving you

77
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:40,990
doesn't get in the way of my work.

78
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,780
I am planning to make a transfer request

79
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,020
pretty soon.

80
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:47,750
Transfer?

81
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:50,310
Where to?

82
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:51,100
Don't get the wrong idea.

83
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,100
It has nothing to do
with you liking Ms. Ling.

84
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,310
It's just that

85
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:01,070
working for Ms. Ling

86
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,510
and being

87
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:05,780
her personal assistant,

88
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:07,950
I can learn a lot of things,

89
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:11,100
but I'm still just an assistant.

90
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:14,870
How people treat me
depends on Ms. Ling's authority.

91
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:17,750
She has actual authority and trusts me.

92
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,140
Then, people respect me.

93
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:22,140
But what if she leaves Sanxing Group?

94
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:28,310
I want to try my luck
in the sales department.

95
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:30,100
Perhaps I can have better opportunities

96
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,220
after leaving her side.

97
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:33,900
Of course you can.

98
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:35,870
I have faith in your skills.

99
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:37,340
How about this?

100
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:39,390
If you ever need my help,

101
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:40,390
just let me know.

102
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:43,270
I'll do my best for you.

103
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,630
I do need your help now.

104
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:51,070
You are the deputy general manager.

105
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:59,270
Wait...

106
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:01,140
Cheers, deputy general manager.

107
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:12,340
It's all right.

108
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:16,750
Here?

109
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:21,870
Steady.

110
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:23,310
All right.

111
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,020
We're here.

112
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:29,340
Gu Zhaohe.

113
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,700
Thanks for walking me home.

114
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:33,460
Don't mention it.

115
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:35,750
I...

116
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:47,750
Let me walk you upstairs.

117
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:49,020
I'll walk you upstairs.

118
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:51,310
- Which way?
- This way.

119
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,780
Is the date over?

120
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:27,100
Are you really going
to let Xia Xiaoqing win me over?

121
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:28,990
She's always liked you.

122
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:29,830
She is good for you.

123
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:36,100
Honestly?

124
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:37,540
Yeah.

125
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:03,270
Why won't you

126
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:04,630
admit how you really feel?

127
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:07,460
I swear

128
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:09,270
I will never lie to you again.

129
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,510
Please forgive me.

130
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:17,750
If there's nothing else,

131
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:19,900
I'm going to bed.

132
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:24,780
I am meeting the mistress
of Xinlan Group tomorrow.

133
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:29,100
Let's go together.

134
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:32,140
Sure.

135
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:34,390
You could've just texted me about it.

136
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:43,060
You don't look anxious.

137
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:44,140
Is your mum not pushing you
to get married?

138
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,710
I came to deliver top-secret info.

139
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:50,990
Why isn't your loved one here?

140
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:55,990
Did you two have a fight?

141
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,780
Did you fail to woo her?

142
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,140
Not your concern.

143
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:08,140
Seeing we grew up together,

144
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:09,710
I'll do you a favor today.

145
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:12,540
Come closer,

146
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:13,710
I'll tell you the way.

147
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,750
Come on. Hurry!

148
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,180
She is here.

149
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:27,870
Don't get me into trouble.

150
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:28,940
Trust me.

151
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:37,660
Hello. I am Yu Xiling.

152
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:38,750
Hello, missy.

153
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:46,820
Hello.

154
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:51,990
Missy, you are even more beautiful
than expected.

155
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:55,390
It's no wonder
he wouldn't let me see you.

156
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:56,630
I bet

157
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,990
he thought I'd be mad after meeting you

158
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:01,270
and stop him from working for you.

159
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:05,940
Let's get down to business.

160
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:07,750
Yup, all yours.

161
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:12,350
Ms. Bian.

162
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:14,270
Knock it off.

163
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:17,710
Please tell us everything
and anything you know.

164
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:20,470
All right.

165
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:23,590
Seeing how behaving you've been,

166
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:25,270
I'll help you out.

167
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:32,940
Lingkang Group

168
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,750
once signed an agreement
with Xinlan Group.

169
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,750
They secured
the distribution rights of Elly.

170
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,870
Zhaohe must have shown you this, right?

171
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:42,350
Yeah...

172
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:43,350
Yes.

173
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:47,660
I did a background check
on Lingkang Group.

174
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:48,780
I found out

175
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,110
that Ling Kang

176
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:52,420
was the legal person of the company.

177
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,540
However, the biggest shareholder

178
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:56,300
was a person named Tang Xiao.

179
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,230
There was no trace of Tang Xiao

180
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:59,940
ever running the company.

181
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:03,140
Tang Xiao?

182
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:05,750
Are you saying

183
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:07,660
Tang Xiao is actually

184
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,540
holding the shares for another person?

185
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:11,870
Correct.

186
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:15,140
Tang Xiao...

187
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,990
The name sounds familiar.

188
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:22,710
I remember it now.

189
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:25,470
I was at my uncle's home
when I was a freshman.

190
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:28,020
He was on the phone with someone.

191
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:29,140
That person was Tang Xiao.

192
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:33,780
They mentioned a scholarship in the US
and allowance.

193
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:37,590
Zhaohe, aren't you a smart one?

194
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:39,870
That's what I like about you.

195
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:42,710
I did my background check on Tang Xiao.

196
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:43,870
He graduated

197
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:46,300
from the University of Pennsylvania.

198
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,020
Does the timeline match?

199
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:49,900
What do you think?

200
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:51,590
So,

201
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:53,940
Mo Sanxing

202
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:57,180
is the actual mastermind

203
00:11:58,270 --> 00:11:59,510
controlling this deal

204
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,940
between Sanxing Group
and Lingkang Group.

205
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:03,390
Yup.

206
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:06,710
If by carrying out the agreement

207
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:09,540
Sanxing Group loses
the control over Tianye,

208
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,900
Mo Sanxing can use Tianye as a gateway

209
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,540
acquire equity in Sanxing Group.

210
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:15,990
And then, he can transfer
Tang Xiao's shares

211
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:17,270
to his name.

212
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,300
That will make him

213
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:20,900
the biggest shareholder.

214
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:25,750
Zhaohe, where did you learn all this?

215
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:28,390
Are you really a sports student?

216
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:30,110
You are so smart.

217
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:32,140
Mistress, cut it out.

218
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:34,270
Fine.

219
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:37,470
Now that we're done with the work,

220
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:39,820
I am feeling a bit thirsty.

221
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:42,510
Go and get me some juice.

222
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:46,510
Come on.

223
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:48,060
Promise.

224
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,390
Fine, I'll go.

225
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,230
You like Gu Zhaohe.

226
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,020
That's the look I wanted.

227
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,350
You are jealous.

228
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:10,710
You are definitely in love with him.

229
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,990
So, why weren't you with him just now?

230
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:13,990
Huh?

231
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:15,510
Weren't you...

232
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:16,710
It was acting.

233
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:20,870
I didn't run it by him.
He didn't say yes.

234
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:22,990
Well, I did it

235
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:25,300
because he's too much
of a typical guy to get it.

236
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:28,300
I was worried he might never understand
that you like him.

237
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,470
His EQ is pretty good.

238
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,510
A subconscious defense.

239
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,710
He has a chance after all.

240
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:45,180
My mother wants me to marry him,

241
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:47,020
but I don't intend to do so.

242
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:48,940
I am currently

243
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:52,110
somewhat running away from home

244
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:54,180
and still terrified of marriage.

245
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:55,750
I'm not a threat.

246
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:58,750
By the way,

247
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:01,510
you're the first woman
he's ever fallen in love with.

248
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:04,020
Based on what I know about him,

249
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:05,390
he is too stubborn

250
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:07,390
to ever fall for another woman again.

251
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:11,060
I wouldn't be so sure.

252
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,710
Only time will tell.

253
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:15,900
You'll see it. Give it some time.

254
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:18,510
He is obsessed with you.

255
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:19,630
If you like him,

256
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:20,900
why not be with him?

257
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:25,900
There were

258
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:29,660
some issues between us.

259
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,990
I bet it's his fault.

260
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:32,060
I'll talk some sense into him.

261
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:36,110
You two clearly love each other.

262
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:38,590
The probability is as good
as a miracle's.

263
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:40,510
Why not give each other a chance?

264
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:43,940
Even if you find out
you're not meant to be,

265
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:45,780
it's better than having regrets.

266
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:53,660
What's up?

267
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:55,230
We talked about you.

268
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,990
What is there to talk about?

269
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:01,470
We were ranting about you.
