3
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:27,590
Stay safe on your way there.

4
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:31,740
Take care.

5
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,899
Didn't I ask you to pick up Zhou Ju?

6
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,219
(Ballroom)

7
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:13,460
Where is Yu Xiling?

8
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:17,020
I let her go there.

9
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:19,630
I sent her to pick up Zhou Ju.

10
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:24,990
You're risking
the future of Sanxing Group.

11
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:28,339
If something goes wrong,
how will you pay for it?

12
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:29,380
Mom,

13
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:31,660
I trust her.

14
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:36,820
Fine.

15
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:40,900
Hello, Ms. Zhou.

16
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:42,419
I'm almost there.

17
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:43,669
Please wait for me.

18
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,139
Alright.

19
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:47,020
Call me when you arrive.

20
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:48,270
No rush.

21
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,710
Ms. Mo Lan is here.

22
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:02,790
Hello, everyone.

23
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,299
Can you hurry up a bit?

24
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,990
There's a traffic congestion.

25
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:17,949
Dear board members,

26
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:19,139
today's meeting concerns

27
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,829
the motion to dismiss Mr. Mo Sanxing

28
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:22,859
from his position as a president.

29
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,669
After presenting the relevant facts,

30
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:27,830
the board members present will vote

31
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,509
to decide whether Mr. Mo

32
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:32,430
is fit to continue as a president.

33
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:34,299
It was Ms. Mo Lan

34
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,579
who reported

35
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:38,109
Mr. Mo's violations this time.

36
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:39,789
It includes massive financial losses

37
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:42,020
from the Yingqiao Project,

38
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:44,349
poor management of company operations,

39
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:47,699
and possible collusion
to transfer company assets.

40
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,740
The related documents
have been distributed to everyone.

41
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:53,270
I believe you've reviewed them.

42
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:57,110
Now, Mr. Mo Sanxing
will present his statement.

43
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:01,139
My statement is simple.

44
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,109
Ms. Mo Lan's accusations against me

45
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:05,549
are entirely based on
her personal concerns and assumptions.

46
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:06,990
I understand her intention

47
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:08,069
and respect her right

48
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:10,550
as a shareholder to raise the issues.

49
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:12,699
Next,

50
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,270
Ms. Mo Lan, please
present your statement.

51
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:23,500
I won't make groundless accusations

52
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:26,900
out of personal suspicion.

53
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:29,979
I will call upon a key witness

54
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,579
to address the board

55
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:35,150
regarding the financial issues
of Sanxing Group in recent years.

56
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:38,060
I hope everyone
could be waiting patiently.

57
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:50,110
Driver, can you go a bit faster?

58
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:07,220
(Ningbo Inshow City Radisson Hotel)

59
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:32,860
Sister,

60
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:36,070
how long do we have to wait?

61
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,310
She's on the way now.

62
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:46,989
Just wait a bit longer.

63
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:49,459
Moreover, we still have

64
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,540
one board member who hasn't arrived yet.

65
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,710
This scene seems familiar.

66
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:57,900
Something similar seemed
to happen not long ago.

67
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:00,309
If I'm not mistaken,

68
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:03,829
it was on the ceremony

69
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,660
of signing Tianye contract.

70
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:28,309
Sorry, the number you called

71
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:29,779
is unavailable.

72
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:32,020
Please try again later.

73
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:40,390
Alright, the last board
member has arrived.

74
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:41,860
Is there anyone else absent?

75
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:49,460
Where's my son?

76
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:51,189
He's fine at kindergarten.

77
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:53,340
You'll see him soon.

78
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:03,900
Everyone,

79
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,590
due to unforeseen circumstances,

80
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:09,989
the witness is unable to attend.

81
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:11,310
This meeting

82
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:13,710
will be temporarily adjourned.

83
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:15,950
It's alright, my sister.

84
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,020
Since that's the case,

85
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:33,900
allow me to say a few words.

86
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:41,019
As you all witness,
I've been in a tough situation.

87
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:42,269
These few years,

88
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:45,019
the domestic fashion market
is very competitive.

89
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:46,989
The current progress of Sanxing Group

90
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:49,510
can be said a miracle in adversity.

91
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:51,779
Although I'm not
the largest shareholder,

92
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:54,190
I've put all my best effort

93
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:56,100
into the development of the group.

94
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:59,779
My sister, as the largest
shareholder of the company,

95
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:02,869
has been focused
on her overseas ventures.

96
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:04,340
It's challenging for her,

97
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,659
that she didn't even have time

98
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,219
to take care of her son.

99
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,429
So, Zhaohe has been

100
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:11,699
looked after by me in her absence.

101
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:12,869
After he joined the company,

102
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:15,950
I also put all my efforts
into nurturing him.

103
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:17,189
I didn't expect

104
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:19,150
to see this happen today.

105
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,099
To be honest,

106
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:24,019
I understand my sister's
situation very well.

107
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:27,509
The overseas market is terrible now,

108
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:28,659
and it is hard to survive.

109
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:30,899
However, the domestic market is booming

110
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,269
and developing fast.

111
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:34,750
Now that the group is growing well,

112
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:38,310
it's natural that she wants to reclaim
her share of authority, isn't that normal?

113
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:43,390
It's very normal.

114
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:44,989
This matter should've been

115
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:46,779
resolved privately

116
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:48,659
within the family.

117
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:52,590
I apologize for making
a spectacle of it in front of everyone.

118
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:55,309
If any of you feel that I, Mo Sanxing,

119
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:57,389
have failed in managing the company,

120
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:59,459
and I am no longer
suitable to lead the Sanxing Group

121
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,100
to new heights,

122
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:02,189
I'm more than willing

123
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,020
to voluntarily resign as the president.

124
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:06,749
Then, we can collectively reevaluate

125
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,629
and recommend a candidate

126
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:10,779
whom you think is the
most suitable as the president.

127
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:11,900
Of course,

128
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:13,339
my current term has only

129
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:15,540
a little over a month left.

130
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,340
By the time,

131
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:22,390
if I, Mo Sanxing is fortunate enough
to be reelected as a president,

132
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:24,539
I will continue

133
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:27,660
to dedicate myself
wholeheartedly to the group.

134
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:33,860
Thank you.

135
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:56,419
We've fallen into his trap.

136
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:58,840
All these must have been
arranged in advance.

137
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,320
You heard what Xiling told us,

138
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,160
while she was on her way
to pick up Zhou Ju,

139
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,600
they were still keeping in touch.

140
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,680
But then the call was hung up
as soon as she reached there.

141
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,819
Zhou Ju must have been
taken away by someone.

142
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,620
So, the problem lies with her.

143
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,899
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

144
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,460
It has nothing to do with you.

145
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:23,430
Only you and I know
that Zhou Ju would turn up today.

146
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:25,830
Why did you let her go to pick Zhou Ju,

147
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,899
and yet Zhou Ju never showed up?

148
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,419
Mom, if you could find Zhou Ju,

149
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:32,430
so could Mo Sanxing.

150
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:34,460
Why do you blame Xiling?

151
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:37,590
I only believe the facts in front of me.

152
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:40,310
Zhaohe,

153
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:46,310
I want to speak with Ms. Mo alone.

154
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:48,550
Could you leave here first?

155
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:07,139
Mr. Gu.

156
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,380
Hi, Mr. Gu.

157
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:10,950
What else do you want to say?

158
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:16,500
What happened today

159
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:19,100
was my fault.

160
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:21,190
I didn't manage to fetch Zhou Ju.

161
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,830
I was so sorry for that.

162
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:26,819
But I've already explained it to you.

163
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,830
Don't you find something strange?

164
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:30,779
Ever since the Yingqiao project,

165
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:34,140
Mo Sanxing doesn't leave
a trace for all his deeds.

166
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,589
He knew you'd return.

167
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:38,019
How could he attend

168
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:39,710
the board meeting unprepared?

169
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,939
You know Mo Sanxing well.

170
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:48,590
I worked under him since I graduated.

171
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:52,500
For a very long time?

172
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:53,980
Six years.

173
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,710
So, you should know

174
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:58,139
Mo Sanxing wouldn't put himself

175
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,980
in a passive position.

176
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:03,310
He allowed you to call
this emergency board meeting.

177
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,430
I think he must have a backup plan.

178
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,430
Since you know him so well,

179
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,380
tell me,

180
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:12,830
what's his backup plan?

181
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,220
Is it you?

182
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:21,030
It's indeed my fault for today's matter.

183
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:24,310
But if it were me,

184
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:27,500
I wouldn't have agreed
Zhaohe to pick up Zhou Ju.

185
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:31,139
I wouldn't have put myself

186
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,190
in such an awkward position.

187
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:38,950
How do I know you're not acting?

188
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:42,469
Mo Sanxing, together with
the other shareholders,

189
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:44,419
along with the 3% stake in your hands,

190
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:46,819
there's nothing more
that could challenge

191
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:49,389
his authority in the group.

192
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:50,950
If that were the case,

193
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:54,310
I wouldn't have waited
for you to come back.

194
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:58,140
I explained so much now.

195
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,509
But, I'm not trying

196
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:04,030
to defend myself.

197
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:08,589
It's just that I, Zhaohe,

198
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:09,620
and you,

199
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:11,590
we all are clear.

200
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,019
We hope

201
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:15,179
that Mo Sanxing's actions
could be exposed to the public.

202
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,100
Right?

203
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:20,140
But, before confronting
such a formidable opponent,

204
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:22,179
shouldn't we ensure

205
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:23,830
we're fully prepared?

206
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:30,140
Now, I understand

207
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:33,030
why Zhaohe likes you so much.

208
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:36,589
If you weren't
the vice president of Sanxing,

209
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:40,500
and were not entangled with Mo Sanxing
or even the entire group,

210
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:42,659
I wouldn't care so much

211
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:45,830
about what kind
of girlfriend my son has.

212
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,380
You want me to make a choice.

213
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:58,100
You said that it's difficult
to deal with my opponent.

214
00:12:58,750 --> 00:12:59,869
Your presence

215
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:03,190
deeply influences Gu Zhaohe's judgments.

216
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:06,500
As you can see,

217
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,659
he kept defending you,

218
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:11,310
and didn't even consider
the other matters.

219
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:13,899
You affect each of his decisions.

220
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:14,989
And, those decisions

221
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:18,100
are crucial to the outcome.

222
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:22,830
I'll transfer my 3% stake

223
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:24,910
to Gu Zhaohe unconditionally,

224
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,380
and at the same time
complete the work handover,

225
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:32,590
and resign from the position
of Vice President of Sanxing Group.

226
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,710
So fast you decide.

227
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:41,830
Don't you need to think
about it more carefully?

228
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:43,550
If I have to choose

229
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:45,220
between Gu Zhaohe

230
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:49,260
and anything else,

231
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:53,030
I'll choose Gu Zhaohe
without hesitation.

232
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,140
Is it because

233
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:57,310
Zhaohe is young?

234
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:58,830
So,

235
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:02,100
you're placing your bet on the future.

236
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:03,620
Ms. Mo,

237
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:07,220
stop testing me.

238
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:10,500
I'll do what I promised.

239
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:12,830
But, please allow me to say one thing.

240
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,710
I hope you'll

241
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:17,910
trust Zhaohe more.

242
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:20,349
He's not an irrational person

243
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:22,340
you think he is.

244
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:24,950
I don't have family,

245
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:26,989
so I understand

246
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:28,830
the importance of family deeply.

247
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:31,590
I don't want

248
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:33,950
Zhaohe to lose someone like you

249
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,500
because of me.

250
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:42,910
That's great.

251
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,380
I have one more request.

252
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,620
Please transfer the
former employee, Xia Xiaoqing back.

253
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:54,310
She can assist Zhaohe well
with his work.

254
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:00,590
