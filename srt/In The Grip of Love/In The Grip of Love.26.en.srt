3
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:14,800
Xu Yiqing's blog

4
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:17,170
suddenly appeared
to be in online status.

5
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,530
I saw it too.

6
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:23,600
Do you think

7
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:27,370
it's possible that the
account was hacked?

8
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:32,090
But, no one uses blogs anymore.

9
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:34,280
What's the point of hacking it?

10
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:37,040
That's true.

11
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,210
Then, he must be the one
using it personally.

12
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:44,240
Let's try replying to him.

13
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:50,720
(Contact me. Xu Yiqing, where are you?)

14
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:56,570
Let's wait a bit.

15
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:02,040
Just waiting like this won't work.

16
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:04,050
What if he never replies?

17
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:09,050
This way.

18
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,210
I'll ask a friend who works in IT.

19
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:14,850
Let's see if they can help us

20
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:16,800
track the login location.

21
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:20,490
I'll think about it.

22
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:26,850
Mr. Gu, someone has filed
a real-name report.

23
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,440
I have no choice.

24
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,440
According to the time
the photo was taken,

25
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,360
it was shortly after this

26
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:41,029
that you initiated
the transfer request procedure

27
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:42,490
for Ms. Xia Xiaoqing within the group.

28
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,619
And the content of the report alleges

29
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:46,720
that you used
the transfer request as an exchange

30
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:49,000
for a sexual relationship
with a subordinate.

31
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:51,520
We need to further
investigate this matter.

32
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,770
A few photos can't prove anything.

33
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:59,800
I did approve
Xia Xiaoqing's transfer request,

34
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:02,419
but that was because
of her outstanding workability,

35
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:04,410
which made her suitable
for the position after the transfer.

36
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:05,970
Ms. Ling also signed off on it.

37
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,320
Mr. Gu,

38
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,139
the key issue is,

39
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:13,650
the whistle-blower is demanding
to disclose the real name,

40
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:18,200
and the whistle-blower
is the party involved, Xia Xiaoqing.

41
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:31,200
Miss Xia,

42
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:32,859
according to protocol,

43
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:35,080
you'll need to cooperate
with us to uncover the truth.

44
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,250
No problem.

45
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,069
But considering the serious damage

46
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:40,090
this incident has caused me,

47
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:43,299
I hope that when I state the facts,

48
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,570
it can be broadcast live
within the company.

49
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:47,370
I think that's unnecessary.

50
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:52,299
Since Mr. Gu is a company director,

51
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,410
and I'm just an ordinary employee,

52
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:56,480
I request openness and fairness.

53
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:01,160
No problem.

54
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:03,760
Alright.

55
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:05,760
Please come with me.

56
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:29,480
She wanted to tell me about this last night.

57
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:33,810
I should've let her finish her words.

58
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:38,280
Gu and Ms. Ling are getting along well.

59
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:39,829
What do you think Xiaoqing is up to?

60
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:41,299
I don't think it's possible.

61
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,739
Don't gossip anymore.

62
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,880
I think it's just a love triangle.

63
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:48,000
Have you noticed how Xiaoqing
looks at Mr. Gu normally?

64
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:50,930
Could it be that Xiaoqing, unable to win
his love and turn it into hate?

65
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:53,410
- What's wrong with you?
- Why are you so mean?

66
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:55,019
What's wrong with me saying her?

67
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:57,130
Did Xiaoqing mistreat you?

68
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:59,320
Why are you being so mean
and saying nonsense here?

69
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,859
She treats me well, but it has nothing to do
with her being a love wrecker.

70
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,669
- Who are you calling a love wrecker?
- The live stream has started.

71
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:05,130
- What's wrong with you? Stop it!
- The live stream has started.

72
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:08,480
Are you crazy?

73
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:12,069
Regarding Gu Zhaohe

74
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:14,019
used the excuse of helping me
with a transfer

75
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,050
to demand a sexual relationship with me,

76
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:18,000
I am here to clarify the statement.

77
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:19,749
The photos

78
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,779
showing Gu Zhaohe and me
entering my apartment hallway that day

79
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:24,370
are real.

80
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,899
But that day, I was drunk.

81
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,570
He only sent me to the door.

82
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:29,269
After that,

83
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:31,989
he did not make
any inappropriate actions towards me.

84
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:33,099
During this time,

85
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,490
I brought up the transfer matter to him.

86
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:36,989
Gu Zhaohe expressed

87
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:38,810
that he acknowledged my abilities

88
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:41,539
and was willing to help me
initiate the transfer process.

89
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:42,429
I don't know

90
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:44,269
why a simple meeting
between me and Gu Zhaohe

91
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:46,290
was photographed by someone.

92
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:48,389
But just last night after work,

93
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:51,309
a colleague of Sanxing,
Wu Jiang approached me.

94
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:54,389
He hoped I would show up
and make a false statement,

95
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:57,290
promising me generous rewards.

96
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:59,989
I had no intention
of harming my partners

97
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:02,570
who once worked together
for Sanxing and Tianye.

98
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:03,309
But in order

99
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:05,699
to temporarily gain the trust
of those with ulterior motives,

100
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:08,000
I could only verbally
agree to his request.

101
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:09,290
I admit

102
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:12,050
that I falsely accused Gu Zhaohe.

103
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,509
I will voluntarily resign

104
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:15,570
without any compensation.

105
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,539
But, I hope the company

106
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:19,139
would investigate the

107
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:21,000
malicious slander behind the matter.

108
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:27,810
Oh, so that's what happened.

109
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:45,810
Given the severity of this incident,

110
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:49,269
we will terminate the employee, Wu Jiang

111
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:51,200
from Sanxing Group.

112
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:52,339
At the same time,

113
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:55,570
we approve Xia Xiaoqing's
resignation request.

114
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:18,840
Sister Ling!

115
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,440
What's wrong? Are you not welcoming me?

116
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,749
Sister, that day,

117
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,579
I intentionally made you misunderstand

118
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:33,880
that I was going to
the company with Gu Zhaohe.

119
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,459
But, actually,

120
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:38,290
we ran into each other
at the cafe downstairs.

121
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:41,760
Honestly,

122
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:44,080
I did feel a bit jealous that day.

123
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,200
Xiaoqing,

124
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,400
I'm sorry.

125
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:58,099
I've always been

126
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,050
unclear about my feelings.

127
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:03,570
I never intended to use you

128
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:05,570
as a catalyst for our relationship.

129
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:08,389
I was just saying that out of anger.

130
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:10,000
Couldn't you read between the lines?

131
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:13,000
It's great as long as you understand me.

132
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:27,810
Sister Ling, you know,
when I like someone,

133
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:30,339
I wanted to hide my feelings too.

134
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:32,370
Yet, I can't hide them.

135
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:36,389
You know, when the person you like
always appears in front of you, here and there,

136
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:38,810
and even smiles at you,

137
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:41,989
how can anyone keep
their feelings hidden?

138
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:43,810
I just couldn't make it.

139
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:47,840
Now that I've resigned, it's fine.

140
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:50,930
Maybe I'll forget about him
if I stop seeing him.

141
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:54,200
I understand that feeling.

142
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:56,400
Indeed,

143
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:00,840
when you like someone,
it's hard to hide it.

144
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:05,170
Actually, there's someone
like that around you too.

145
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,219
Around me?

146
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,200
Yeah.

147
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:09,810
Gu Zhaohe?

148
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,250
Try guessing again.

149
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:13,400
Hmm...

150
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:14,989
Who could it be?

151
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:16,440
I have no idea.

152
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,370
It's Andy.

153
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:21,610
Haven't you noticed
his feelings for you?

154
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:24,440
But between him and me,

155
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:27,490
we are just besties.

156
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:30,869
What besties?

157
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,600
That's just an excuse.

158
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:34,440
You all

159
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:37,410
have worked under me for years.

160
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:40,410
At first, I didn't notice either,

161
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:44,810
but as time went on, I realized

162
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:47,440
that Andy is truly special to you.

163
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:48,469
I...

164
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:51,170
Think about it,
every time you get drunk,

165
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:52,899
he's the one who worries you the most.

166
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,869
He would get you home safely after that.

167
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,770
When you're upset,

168
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:59,960
he tries out of his way to cheer you up.

169
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,509
When you encounter any problem,

170
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:03,059
he's always the first to step in

171
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,410
and stand by you.

172
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:07,779
When you guys hang out to eat,

173
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,179
and accompany you in playing games,

174
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:11,509
or when you have any problems at work,

175
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:13,480
he appears to be the first one
to solve it for you.

176
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:17,059
Even when you like Gu Zhaohe,

177
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,010
he...

178
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,389
Stop it, Sister!

179
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:24,080
I've never thought of that with him.

180
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:27,050
I think you can consider it.

181
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:31,360
Life is about giving
yourself more options.

182
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:33,109
I...

183
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:34,530
Today,
