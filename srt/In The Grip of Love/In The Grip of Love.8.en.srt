00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:14,899
I

4
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,859
like you.

5
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:23,398
Both of you haven't
confirmed your relationship, right?

6
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:25,398
That means I still have a chance.

7
00:00:25,399 --> 00:00:26,859
Am I right?

8
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:34,078
Well,

9
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:36,319
why do you always talk nonsense

10
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,718
after you drink, Xiaoqing?

11
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:39,319
That's how Xiaoqing is.

12
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,158
She always talks nonsense
after drinking.

13
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:42,839
Drink more.

14
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,118
Drink another glass.

15
00:00:44,119 --> 00:00:46,339
Stop it. You're drunk.

16
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:47,779
I want to drink.

17
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,019
Gu Zhaohe,

18
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:51,099
I like you a lot.

19
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:52,580
Xiaoqing.

20
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:53,118
Xiaoqing.

21
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:53,979
You're drunk.

22
00:00:54,119 --> 00:00:55,059
Xiaoqing.

23
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,140
Xiaoqing.

24
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:00,798
Be careful.

25
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:02,500
We should go back now, Xiaoqing.

26
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,659
It's getting late. You are drunk.

27
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:06,438
No. Xiaoqing.

28
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:07,919
Xiaoqing.

29
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,899
Gu has to go back.

30
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:10,878
Let me send you back, all right?

31
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:11,479
Don't touch me.

32
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,580
Xiaoqing!

33
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,679
Xiaoqing!

34
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,078
Xiaoqing, even Ms. Ling left.

35
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:19,060
Xiaoqing, we should go back now.

36
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,539
Why don't...

37
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:26,639
Why don't

38
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,619
you send her back today?

39
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:47,739
I asked you a question just now.

40
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,220
You haven't answered me.

41
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,539
Didn't you send Xia Xiaoqing back?

42
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,420
I only sent her to her car.

43
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,300
She already confessed to you.

44
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,580
The person I like

45
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,820
jogs with me at night.

46
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:17,939
I don't know who you jog with at night.

47
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,420
You are the only one.

48
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:22,820
Yu Xiling,

49
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,059
I like you.

50
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,499

I'll ask you another question.

(He left without saying goodbye?)

(Forget it. Even if
it's a fraud for sex and money,)

74
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,460
(he is the victim.)

75
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:17,819
What a coincidence.

76
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,980
Well,

77
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:35,078
let me reintroduce myself.

78
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:39,278
I am your new neighbour and boyfriend.

79
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:40,579
My name is Gu Zhaohe.

80
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:43,540
I did it

81
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:45,599
to be closer to you

82
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,039
and guarantee your safety.

83
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,220
It's customized.

84
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,460
Please enjoy.

85
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,100
How long did you take to prepare this?

86
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,719
I made the decision that night.

87
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,619
I'm talking about the breakfast.

88
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,699
Oh.

89
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,398
Under most circumstances,

90
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:06,159
lunchtime belongs to colleagues.

91
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,198
Dinnertime belongs to family members.

92
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:09,540
As for breakfast,

93
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,340
it's for lovers.

94
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:18,059
Sometimes,
I need a long time to prepare it.

95
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:20,499
Fine.

96
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,958
Since you've prepared so long for it,

97
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:23,758
I also

98
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,980
want to talk about

99
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:30,860
our complicated relationship then.

100
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:33,020
Sure.

101
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,379
I think we need
to sign a lover's contract.

102
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,078
What?

103
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:38,939
One.

104
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,559
Party A, Yu Xiling

105
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,819
and Party B, Gu Zhaohe

106
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:45,460
are willing
to sign the contract voluntarily.

107
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,799
Voluntarily.

108
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,300
No one is forcing each other.

109
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,460
Two.

110
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,278
You can't affect your work
because of love.

111
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:54,239
Don't think

112
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,479
you are my boyfriend

113
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:58,518
so I will be lenient to you.

114
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:00,379
I will still be strict towards you.

115
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:02,540
No problem with this. Sure.

116
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,939
Three.

117
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:05,719
Our relationship

118
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,758
cannot go public

119
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:08,259
in the company.

120
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:11,220
There must never be
any intimate interactions.

121
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:13,660
I also did it to avoid

122
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:15,900
unwanted troubles.

123
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,039
Okay?

124
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,460
Okay.

125
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:23,159
Four.

126
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,100
To ensure a healthy relationship,

127
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,078
we must call each other every day
for 15 minutes at least.

128
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:31,039
Every week, we must go on three dates.

129
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,300
Five.

130
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:34,980
If you have no objections,

131
00:07:35,168 --> 00:07:38,028
let's get a lawyer
to draft the contract.

132
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,460
Don't worry.

133
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,479
Only the lawyer knows.

134
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,540
No one else will find out.

135
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,780
Great.

136
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,699
Then,

137
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:01,540
let's have breakfast.

138
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,559
No.

139
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,359
I think you are going to be late.

140
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,460
I...

141
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,919
Stop eating.

142
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,619
Eat it on your way.

143
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,479
You haven't gotten changed yet.

144
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,059
Go back and get changed.

145
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:20,758
The first article of the contract.

146
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:23,540
Don't let our relationship
affect your work.

147
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,739
That's the second article.

148
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:44,059
You and Xu Yiqing...

149
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:51,579
Go and buy me a cup of coffee.

150
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,660
Sure.

151
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:09,878
What's wrong?

152
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:11,699
Don't let other people
in the company find out.

153
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,059
Sure.

154
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,278
You still have 18 minutes left
to clock in.

155
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:17,939
Don't be late.

156
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,339
Good morning, Ms. Ling.

157
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,939
Good morning.

158
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,260
Ms. Ling.

159
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,500
Are you in a relationship?

160
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,020
I was wrong, Ms. Ling.

161
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:18,600
(Yingqiao)

162
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,740
(Xu Yiqing,)

163
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:22,678
(I've decided to start a new life.)

164
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:23,878
Gu Zhaohe, do you want some water?

165
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:24,740
No need.

166
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,059
Thank you.

168
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:41,239
You are punctual.

(Sanxing Group, Yingqiao)

170
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:46,020
Ms. Ling,

171
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,939
your coffee.

172
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,638
Oh no,

173
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:53,020
I bought the wrong coffee.

174
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:53,859
What?

175
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,420
It's the right kind.

176
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:11,859
This is your punishment
for fooling around with me this morning.

177
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,459
You are sweating. Wipe your forehead.

178
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:26,558
I can do it myself. Thank you.

179
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:28,020
Have some coffee.

180
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,918
Sorry.

181
00:11:30,919 --> 00:11:33,620
I was drunk last night.

182
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:36,979
Thank you.

183
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,819
However, what I said was serious.

184
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,398
Sorry, I have someone I like.

185
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:45,660
I know.
