3
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:19,730
Ms. Ling.

4
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:21,869
Are you...

5
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:23,850
It's all right. Get back to work.

6
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:36,170
Did my mother say something to you?

7
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:37,829
She tried to get rid of you?

8
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:39,570
Let me talk to her, okay?

9
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:40,850
It's not that.

10
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:43,739
I chose to leave.

11
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:45,360
I made a big mistake.

12
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:48,189
I must take responsibility.

13
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:49,720
Let me come with you.

14
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:51,320
I'm done working here.

15
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:54,320
Can you not be so childish?

16
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:01,640
Is everything I do

17
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:05,050
always so childish to you?

18
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:08,690
That's not what I meant.

19
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:10,690
Fine.

20
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:15,490
Put these down.

21
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:17,829
We can stay here.

22
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:20,139
Or, we can just leave.

23
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:22,050
I made this choice.

24
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,570
Could you respect my decision?

25
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:26,970
Respect?

26
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:30,800
All right. I respect that.

27
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:34,189
You always make me accept
the decisions you make.

28
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:37,690
You never run it by me before deciding.

29
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,330
Do you only see me

30
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:41,269
as an ignorant boy

31
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:42,859
who doesn't deserve your trust,

32
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:44,419
who is unreliable,

33
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:46,779
and someone who is not worthy
of having a future with you?

34
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:47,749
Calm down.

35
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,859
You never trusted me.

36
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:50,949
You never thought about

37
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:53,219
having a future with me
from the get-go.

38
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,469
The agreement we signed?

39
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:56,829
The satellite?

40
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:59,080
They were all fancy talks to swindle me.

41
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:01,779
I want to be with you

42
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:04,720
and create a future with you.

43
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:07,600
Is that too much to ask?

44
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,850
All I want is the evidence.

45
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:19,930
Fine.

46
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:21,760
Very well.

47
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,760
I'll find you the evidence you want.

48
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:28,370
I'll find Zhou Ju.

49
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,440
(Perhaps Mum is right.)

50
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:38,530
(My presence will cloud your judgment.)

51
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:40,650
(Zhaohe.)

52
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:44,810
(You must finish it on your own.)

53
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,650
Yes, she is not there.

54
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:05,530
Okay. Let me know
when you have a lead.

55
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,600
Yu Xiling.

56
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:12,720
Yu Xiling?

57
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:05,570
(Every satellite has its own mission.)

58
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:08,960
(Have some candy and be happy.)
(Don't just follow the orbit.)

59
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:12,250
(Fulfill your mission.)

60
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:51,360
(Beauty Mo)

61
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,080
Open the door.

62
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:33,610
Yu Xiling is gone.

63
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:36,690
And this is what you turned into?

64
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:38,760
She was right.

65
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:40,570
You are childish.

66
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:52,000
You got what you wanted.
Are you happy now?

67
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,960
Yu Xiling left the company

68
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:58,050
because I made her decide.

69
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:01,869
She chose

70
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:03,610
her relationship with you.

71
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:08,880
Wasting your life away

72
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:12,760
is a disgrace to her resolve.

73
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:16,170
You are hurting yourself.

74
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:19,389
Don't you realize how it pains me

75
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:21,170
to see you like this?

76
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,400
She has always envied

77
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:30,080
our relationship.

78
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:34,370
It's the one thing she never had.

79
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:38,730
She has always yearned
for the warmth of a family.

80
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:41,130
But because of her,

81
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,840
we grew apart.

82
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:47,050
You started to resent me
and even hate me.

83
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:50,960
She didn't want to get in the way
of our relationship.

84
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:55,320
Therefore, she chose to leave.

85
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,760
Don't you think her absence

86
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:02,730
is great for both of us?

87
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,440
I didn't want to tell you,

88
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:11,290
but look at your now.

89
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:14,170
Who knows how long you can last?

90
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:16,189
The shares she gave up

91
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:18,080
and her career that is now in shambles

92
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:19,989
will be all for nothing.

93
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:22,130
I thought you hated her.

94
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:24,219
Why would you care about her?

95
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:26,170
I stand by what I said.

96
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:29,290
I've never disliked her.

97
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,290
I simply didn't trust her.

98
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:34,290
However, she has proven to me

99
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,339
that you were right to trust her.

100
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:38,339
Why are you telling me this now?

101
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:39,760
Are you mocking me?

102
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:41,459
Is that what this is?

103
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:44,880
Mo Sanxing bested me once.

104
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,320
I can't afford another defeat.

105
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:49,019
Making Mo Sanxing think

106
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,189
I blame Yu Xiling

107
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:52,339
for all the losses

108
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:55,290
and that I am now desperate
with no cards left to play,

109
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:57,539
will lower his guard

110
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:59,019
and buy us more time

111
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,749
to look for an opening

112
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:01,989
and evidence.

113
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:03,869
And this is why you chased her away?

114
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:05,880
You are my son!

115
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,429
Of course I want you to be

116
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:12,490
with the woman you love.

117
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:15,429
But as the major shareholder
of Sanxing Group,

118
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:17,170
I must look at the bigger picture.

119
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:20,189
I must consider the interests
of the whole company.

120
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:22,579
Given the circumstances,
there were no other choices.

121
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:25,170
I'd do the same if I had to.

122
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:26,019
Very well.

123
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:27,779
Bear in mind

124
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:28,949
that no matter

125
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:31,019
how your uncle and I fight each other,

126
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:33,349
no matter what happens to Sanxing Group,

127
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:34,650
at the end of the day,

128
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:36,320
you are

129
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:38,290
the most important

130
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:40,890
to me.

131
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,720
I'll make us dinner.

132
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:03,600
It's been too long
since we last had dinner together.

133
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:25,890
Can't you spend a month apart?

134
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:36,720
(A month later)

135
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:41,629
(The industry powerhouse of An Jing city,
namely Sanxing Group and Xinlan Group,)

136
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:43,869
(have recently closed the deal
to acquire Tianye.)

137
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:47,389
(Xinlan Group will soon become
a shareholder of Sanxing Group.)

138
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:50,440
(Because of the deal, Xinlan Group
asked to have a third-party examination)

139
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:53,050
(conducted on
Sanxing's financial status.)

140
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,509
(According to our sources,)

141
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,469
(Sanxing Group will soon
hold a board meeting)

142
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,869
(to elect a new chairman.)

143
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:59,299
(But based on our info,)

144
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,469
(Mr. Mo Sanxing's greatest competition)

145
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:03,890
(is none other
than his nephew, Gu Zhaohe.)

146
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:07,019
(Gu Zhaohe is the son of Mo Lan,
a famous overseas entrepreneur)

147
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:08,419
(of An Jing.)

148
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:09,440
(Zhaohe.)

149
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,650
(It's finally coming to an end.)

150
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:31,160
(Xu Yiqing. Active two hours ago.)

151
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,480
(I am Xiling.)

152
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:37,440
(Lately, I've come to realize that
there are things in life)

153
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,600
(that are never too late to begin.)

154
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,010
(Over the years,)

155
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:43,659
(I've been searching for)

156
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,440
(the reason for your sudden farewell.)

157
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:48,360
(I've imagined countless scenarios.)

158
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:52,120
(But so far, I don't have an answer.)

159
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:56,770
(And now, there is only one outcome.)

160
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:02,890
(Xu Yiqing, you must be held
accountable for the Yingqiao project.)

161
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:17,720
(Li Daogang)

162
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:22,120
(Li Daogang)

163
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,440
(Hello?)

164
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:32,890
(Xiaolan.)

165
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:35,320
(I might fade away soon.)

166
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,890
(I'd like to see you again.)
