Mr. Mo, I found it.

00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:17,910
Mr. Gu moved to Ling An Condominium.

5
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:23,750
That's right. It's beside Ms. Ling.

00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:34,420
It seems like

7
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:37,110
I should pay attention
to my nephew more.

8
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:38,300
I understand.

especially Yeyu

14
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:00,110

has received
a lot of attention and recognition.

Ms. Ling, should we
order the factory to work overtime

and manufacture more shoes?

I have some other plans.

Do you not know or pretend not to know

39

that our mothers
are rushing us to marry each other?

40
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:09,020

from the time when we were babies.

As expected of my buddy.

50
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:33,580
Your mother agreed to let you
intern at Sanxing Group.

51
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:36,180
That means she is planning
to let you take over Sanxing Group.

52
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:39,390
You'll be in danger if you don't leave.

53
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:41,550
I thought

54
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:45,700
it would be easy to find evidence

of my uncle's transfer of assets

56
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:49,790

00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,980
I'm looking in the wrong direction.

58

00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:55,740
Yu Xiling and your uncle's rumor.

60
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:57,670
What's so hard about finding evidence?

61
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:00,900
You also say it is a rumor.

62
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,980
Yu Xiling isn't someone like that.

63
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:07,110
You like this elder woman

64
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:08,350
because she is pretty?

65
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:10,860
Yes.

66

69
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:27,830
and lose your choices.

70
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:30,790
Enough nonsense. How's it going
with the thing I requested?

71
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,980
Ling Kang is not as easy as he seems.

72
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:40,110
He signed an agreement with Xinlan

73
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:41,790
and obtained Elly's operating rights.

74
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:43,830
After Elly's sales increased,

75
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:44,860
he used a loophole

76
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,900
and tried to liquidate Xinlan's shares.

77
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:49,300
Thankfully, my mother was alert

78
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,950
and a catastrophe was avoided.

79
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,300
He is getting along with my uncle

80
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:54,900
because he has
an ulterior motive as I expected.

88
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:15,660
You can leave.

89
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:17,140
How do you plan to compensate me?

90
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:18,270
Don't you like

92
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:21,020
I can sign up
for a one-year membership for you.

93
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:22,100
Are you trying to get rid of me?

94
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:23,390
Do you think I can't sign up myself?

95
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,220
I'll add on the most handsome trainer

96
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:26,430
and the most expensive classroom.

97
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:27,580
How's that?

98
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:30,190
Deal.

99
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,100
Xiling, sorry.

100
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:37,580

101
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:38,900

I'm home.

111

The contract is void.

112
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,780
Do you think
I'm just asking you to buy a cake?

113
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:50,540
I know your intention.

114
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:51,900
A limited supply.

116
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:55,430
The last one.

117
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:05,870
Come and work with me tomorrow.

118
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:07,540
Sure.

119
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,460
Hello, Xiling.

120
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,950
Sorry, Mr. Mo.

121
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:19,780
It was too late yesterday.

122
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,780
I didn't reply to your text because
I was worried that you had slept.

123
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,340
Coincidentally, I planned

124
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,340
to go to Jiangqing
with my department's colleagues

125
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:25,700
for market research.

126
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:27,460
I'm already in Jiangqing.

127
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,100
We will go
and understand the situation first.

128
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,190
I'll report it to you
when you are here.

129
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:36,430
Oh, don't work too hard.

130
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:38,460
Let's meet in Jiangqing then.

131
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:39,750
Sure.

132
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:45,190
No need to go to the office.
Just go to Jiangqing directly.

133
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:51,750
I'll eat the last one.

134
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:53,900
Sure.

135
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:56,950
Here. Soy milk.

136
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:03,220
It's quite good indeed.

137
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:05,630
Well,

138
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:08,100
you might be from Jiangqing

139
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,950
but there's no need
to come here so early

140
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:11,390
just to have breakfast.

141
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:13,990
This soy milk is so delicious.

142
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:20,900
Do you know?

143
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:24,990
This is the busiest commercial center
in Jiangqing.

144
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:26,990
There are also
two high schools around here.

145
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,990
There's even a trendy market street.

146
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:31,700

(went to Jiangqing for work
with the intern, Gu Zhaohe.)

150
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:25,340
Thanks, Boss.

151
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:30,650
In all of Jiangqing,

152
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,140
the sales of Tianye

153
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:36,020
aren't even 40% of An Jing's sales.

154
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:36,820
Yes.

155
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:39,990
The staff said

156
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:43,060
it was because Huier has been
doing 70% discounts all year round.

157
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:46,060
However, we saw their shoes today.

158
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:48,870
The overall quality
and the insole are very bad.

159
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:51,180
If we are also doing the discount,

160
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,510
we are making a loss.

161
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:59,060
Huier is a brand under Xinlan Group.

162
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:02,510
It is also
our main competitor in the country.

163
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:05,780
If we want to exceed Xinlan in sales,

164
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:09,140
we can't have a price war with them.

165
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:15,510
Stop frowning.

166
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,180
You will get wrinkles.

167
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:20,140
What do you mean?

168
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:20,940
Are you calling me old?

169
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:23,390
I just like you like this.

170
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:25,780
What?

171
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:26,870
You like me because I'm old

172
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,750
and have wrinkles?

173
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:30,590
I like you no matter what you look like.

174
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:42,230
How old were you
when I was in high school?

175
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:47,780
About five or six years old.

176
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:49,510
Oh.

177
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:52,180
You were still playing house?

178
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:54,180
What is that?

179
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:57,230
You don't know what's playing house?

180
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:59,390
It's roleplay.

181
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:01,060
I am the mother.

182
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:02,180
You are the father.

183
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:04,390
I am the nurse. You are the doctor.

184
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:05,630
Didn't you do that?

185
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,630
I seldom came out to play
when I was young

186
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:11,540
because my mother was strict.

187
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:18,270
It's all right.
I'll play with you in the future.

188
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:23,420
What will you play with me?

189
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:24,470
Eating candy?

190
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:28,990
Gu Zhaohe.

191
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:33,140
I've brought you to many places today.

192
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:34,420
Don't...

193
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:35,540
Hmm!

194
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:40,350
But

195
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,540
I still want to stay in Jiangqing
for a few more days.

196
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:50,230
I want

197
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:53,140
to go to every place that you stayed at

198
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:54,900
since you were young.

199
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,470
The place where I grew up

200
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,630
is not interesting at all.

201
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,540
I hope

202
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:15,140
that if some place

203
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:16,780
has given you bad memories,

204
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:19,990
it will become

205
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:23,420
a happy memory that only belongs to us

206
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:24,630
after we go there together.

207
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:32,390
In the future,
let me become your satellite.

208
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:35,900
Satellite?

209
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:36,660
Yes.

210
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:43,020
Spinning around you
because you are my world.

211
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,630
Show me.

212
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:49,510
I'm going to do it now.

213
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:51,990
I'm going to do it now.

214
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,660
Don't tickle me!

215
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:58,300
