3
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:16,690
Xiling.

4
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:18,619
Hear me out.

5
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:20,530
I didn't mean to lie.

6
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,280
I asked you, didn't I?

7
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:30,330
When did you find out?

8
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:31,720
Does that matter?

9
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:33,810
I was going to

10
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:35,490
explain everything

11
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,229
to my uncle

12
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:38,549
and then tell you the truth.

13
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:39,920
The truth of what?

14
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:44,640
That you've been lying to me
from the get-go?

15
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:48,320
That night at the amusement park?

16
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:51,600
The ad photoshoot? Your internship?

17
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,240
They were all part of your grand scheme.

18
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:55,600
Am I right?

19
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:02,410
Yes.

20
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:07,419
But everything that came afterward

21
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:08,749
came from the bottom of my heart.

22
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:09,419
I'm not lying.

23
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:10,749
I like you.

24
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:12,920
I asked you, didn't I?

25
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:15,720
You said you'd be honest with me.

26
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:18,570
But now, you're a liar.

27
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:20,520
Gu Zhaohe.

28
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:24,770
Even now, I can't tell

29
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:29,690
if you are still lying or not.

30
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:31,269
I have no idea.

31
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:32,000
I...

32
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:34,469
I didn't mean to keep you in the dark.

33
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:35,549
At first,

34
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:37,269
I was investigating you
and Xu Yiqing...

35
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:39,080
Do not bring up his name.

36
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:42,139
But I started to believe you.

37
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:43,880
But I don't trust you anymore.

38
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:47,800
You and Mo Sanxing...

39
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:50,280
One of you

40
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:53,130
is the owner of Sanxing Group,

41
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,640
and the other is its young heir.

42
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,549
Do you two really enjoy
working together

43
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:00,250
to make a fool out of me?

44
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:03,850
Sorry.

45
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:06,880
I should've told you sooner.

46
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,139
I didn't think

47
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:11,040
it'd turn out this way.

48
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:13,600
Sorry.

49
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:16,880
I'm breaking up with you.

50
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:19,549
I like you.

51
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:21,179
I really like you!

52
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,789
Could you give me a second chance?

53
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:25,000
My trust has its limits.

54
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,970
And you ruined all of it.

55
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:33,229
Xiling...

56
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:34,530
Stop following me.

57
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:38,459

71

I went through two interviews.

72
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:33,440
I got the ad job three days ago.

73
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:36,579
(When I first met her,)

74
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:41,130
she gave me a lot of surprises.

75
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:42,530
Do you mean

76
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:44,000
Xu Yiqing?

77
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:50,200
You mentioned the name
when you were drunk that night.

78
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:53,930
(A Night Encounter. Follow Your Heart)
I have someone I like. A night jog with her

79
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:55,650
is the happiest time

80
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:57,410
in every day of my life.

81
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:59,829
Let me be your satellite from now on.

82
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:01,320
(Breaking news.)

83
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:03,160
(At 0015 hours today,)

84
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,810
(we launched a satellite into orbit)

85
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:08,480
(using the Long March 3B carrier rocket)

86
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,930
(at the Anning Satellite Launch Center.)

87
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:13,299
(The New Journey is a high-orbit
optical remote-sensing satellite.)

88
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,440
Sir,

89
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:17,000
could you turn off the radio?

90
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:29,880
Zhaohe.

91
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:34,440
You are not meant to be.

92
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:37,490
I did it for your own good.

93
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,989
You planned everything
and still claimed you did it for me!

94
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:41,490
What about Yu Xiling?

95
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:43,779
You stepped on her dignity and hurt her!

96
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,989
How could you be so shameless

97
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:47,899
while speaking so calmly?

98
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:48,989
Everyone lacks good judgment

99
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:51,640
when they are young.

100
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,640
I've been through the same thing.

101
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:57,400
It's only natural that you don't get it.

102
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:00,200
As for her,

103
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:03,050
I'll figure out a way
to make it up to her.

104
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:06,490
Stay away from Yu Xiling.

105
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:20,810
(It's been three years.)

106
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:24,200
(I went from seeking
an answer from you)

107
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:28,370
(to slowly leaving you in the past.)

108
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:32,730
(But just as I was
going to start a new life,)

109
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,050
(I realized)

110
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,869
(that everything in my life)

111
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,810
(was connected to you.)

112
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:42,370
(In that case,)

113
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:46,050
(I must find the answer myself.)

114
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:05,250
Ms. Ling, this is Tianye's
sales report for this month.

115
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:12,640
What about the comparison data
from Jiangqing?

116
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:13,749
Where is the sales data

117
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,370
after the store was upgraded?

118
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:18,269
Gu Zhaohe is in charge
of the data from Jiangqing.

119
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:19,779
He also did an analysis

120
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,019
of the surrounding areas

121
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:23,690
that were going through a rainy season.

122
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:26,019
He also created a new sales model.

123
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:27,690
Didn't he show you?

124
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:32,290
Send it to me
after you've collected them all.

125
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,890
Yes.

126
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:35,779
Ms. Ling, to be honest,

127
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:37,869
I think Gu Zhaohe is
the most diligent intern

128
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:39,890
I've seen in this office.

129
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:45,480
That is part of his job.

130
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:48,840
And you.

131
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:51,269
The data analysis has always
been your work.

132
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:53,170
Why did you hand it to him?

133
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:01,050
Gu Zhaohe.

134
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:02,419
I remember

135
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:04,930
it was Ms. Ling who asked you
to do the report.

136
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,600
Come in.

137
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:22,269
Mr. Mo, you wanted to see me.

138
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,570
Yes.

139
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,749
I saw your message.

140
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:34,179
I gave it some thought.

141
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:35,720
I didn't think it through.

142
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,650
I hope I didn't cause you any trouble.

143
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:41,389
Assigning Gu Zhaohe to work with me

144
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:43,480
is the best display of trust for me.

145
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,320
Of course it's not trouble.

146
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:47,440
Xiling.

147
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:51,050
Your horizon has always been grand.

148
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,179
There are important matters

149
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:54,840
I must discuss with you.

150
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:58,349
I am very well aware
of your contributions

151
00:09:58,350 --> 00:09:59,629
to Sanxing Group.

152
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:01,290
I've always thought

153
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:05,179
you deserve authority
that is more practical.

154
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:08,179
Of course, this will also mean

155
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:10,720
you must carry a bigger responsibility
in Sanxing Group.

156
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:14,050
Mr. Mo,

157
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:16,320
I'm all ears.

158
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:17,629
Serving Sanxing Group

159
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:19,690
is my duty.

160
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:22,480
I want you to become a board member.

161
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,269
As long as you are willing,

162
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:28,269
I will give you three percent
of the shares that I own

163
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:29,890
with no strings attached.

164
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:32,389
I will hold a board meeting
as soon as possible

165
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:33,840
to initiate the motion.

166
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,720
What can I do for you?

167
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:45,659
You always read my mind so effortlessly.

168
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,480
I find this thrilling.

169
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:49,389
I'll be honest with you.

170
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:51,389
Zhaohe is my nephew,

171
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:53,570
and I've always cared deeply about him.

172
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:55,819
Ever since my sister
went abroad for her career,

173
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,720
I've been the one to look after him.

174
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:01,170
But at the end of the day,
they are mother and son.

175
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:03,869
In many important matters,

176
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:06,170
I am the outsider.

177
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:08,170
Mo couldn't care less

178
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:11,360
about Sanxing Group.

179
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,779
Now that the two of us
have taken the company

180
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:15,290
to new heights,

181
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:16,299
she is eager

182
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,170
to seize control of it.

183
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:21,240
Of course,

184
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:24,290
this is human nature.
I don't fault her for that.

185
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,320
You want me

186
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:33,629
to stand with you unconditionally.

187
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:34,480
Is that right?

188
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:38,749
Just the two of us.

189
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:41,890
I'll be the master of Sanxing Group.

190
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:45,320
You are the one responsible
for Sanxing Group's greatness.

191
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:47,600
We must work together.

192
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:48,989
We can't simply hand over

193
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:50,589
the fruition of our hard work
and endeavor

194
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:51,930
on a silver platter.

195
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:55,240
Xiling.

196
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,480
I need your support.

197
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:02,080
Mr. Mo.

198
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:06,120
Without your help over the years,

199
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,840
I couldn't have made it this far.

200
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,960
Your wish is my command.

201
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:15,690
Xiling, you never disappoint.

202
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:18,890
However, there is something
I didn't do right by you.

203
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:23,010
Mo Lan sent Gu Zhaohe into Sanxing Group

204
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:25,059
to approach you

205
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:27,530
and disintegrate the unity
within our ranks.

206
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:33,539
I let you get caught up
in this family affair

207
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:35,080
and get hurt.

208
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:37,480
I must apologize.

209
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:41,600
You don't have to.

210
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:27,200
(Relationship Agreement)

211
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:37,160
(Beauty Mo)

212
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:52,840
Hello, Mum.

213
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:55,059
(You told me with confidence)

214
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,930
(that Yu Xiling wasn't a threat.)

215
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,139
(Why is Mo Sanxing initiating a motion)

216
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:01,720
(to let Yu Xiling join the board?)

217
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,749
(He is even going to give her
three percent of his share)

218
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,010
(for free.)

219
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:09,709
(Do you know that the three percent)

220
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:11,019
(is exactly)

221
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:12,819
(what gives Mo Sansheng)

222
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,299
(and his supporters)

223
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:17,050
(more shares than me?)

224
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:21,050
(He would never do that)

225
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,600
(if Yu Xiling wasn't on his side!)

226
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,509
(Gu Zhaohe)

227
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:42,930
(Can we talk?)

228
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:48,360
Come to my office if it's work.

229
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:51,410
If it's something private, forget it.

230
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,650
Why are you joining the board?

231
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:07,360
Words travel fast.

232
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:10,530
What? Does that get in the way
of your interests?

233
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:13,629
I am a mere employee.

234
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:14,749
Of course I'd join the board.

235
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,059
That is our greatest goal.

236
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,389
Is there a problem?

237
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:17,989
Fine.

238
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:19,779
If this is about last night,

239
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:20,939
I apologize.

240
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,539
But think this through.

241
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:26,170
Mo Sanxing would never let you
join the board without an ulterior motive.

242
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:28,360
Anything else?

243
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:30,179
If not, please leave.

244
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,290
Yes.

245
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:36,389
This agreement is still in effect.

246
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:38,010
Party A, Yu Xiling.

247
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:39,810
Party B, Gu Zhaohe.

248
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:41,229
We willingly fell in love

249
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:43,320
and signed this agreement.

250
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:47,269
Party A, Yu Xiling,

251
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:48,299
and Party B, Gu Zhaohe.

252
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,819
We willingly sign
this relationship agreement.

253
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:51,749
Secondly,

254
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:54,179
do not let this relationship
affect our work progress.

255
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,530
Thirdly,

256
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:58,480
do not announce our relationship

257
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,840
in the office.

258
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:03,200
You must not break this agreement.

259
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,840
Only a child would take
this agreement seriously.

260
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:34,690
