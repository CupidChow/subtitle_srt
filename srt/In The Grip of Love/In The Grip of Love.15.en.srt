3
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:15,780
Our new brand, Tianye,

4
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:18,100
which is being led by Yu Xiling,

5
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:20,340
has achieved a new sales record.

6
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,710
Given Yu Xiling's
outstanding contributions

7
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:27,300
to the Sanxing Group over the years,

8
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:29,780
I think

9
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:33,790
she deserves greater authority.

10
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:39,150
I propose that Yu Xiling
join the board of directors.

11
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:40,940
Hey you guys,

12
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:42,830
if Ms. Ling joins
the board of directors,

13
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:44,830
our department can
finally hold our heads up.

14
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:46,700
It seems that choosing the right leader

15
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:48,790
in the workplace is
the only way to stand tall.

16
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:49,910
Absolutely!

17
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:52,700
What are you guys doing here?

18
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:55,190
We're here for an evaluation.

19
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:57,940
You usually handle
the data analysis report yourself.

20
00:00:58,190 --> 00:00:59,740
How could you let someone else do it?

21
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:05,780
Hey,

22
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,140
why are you so quiet today?

23
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:11,780
What's wrong?

24
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:12,780
Don't you feel...

25
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:13,910
Huh?

26
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:16,310
Say it.

27
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:18,310
Ms. Ling and Gu Zhaohe...

28
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:19,030
They...

29
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:26,580
Why hasn't Gu Zhaohe come to work yet?

30
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:27,980
What a big shot he is,

31
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:28,910
being this late!

32
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:42,580
I hereby announce

33
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:46,220
that the resolution for Yu Xiling
to join the board of directors

34
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:47,830
has been unanimously approved.

35
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,660
(Sanxing Group Board of Directors)

36
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:11,700
I'm Gu Zhaohe.

37
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,460
Starting today,

38
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:15,140
I will represent Ms. Mo Lan

39
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:17,350
and perform all her rights
in the board of directors.

40
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:23,550
Ms. Mo Lan, the board member,
has proposed

41
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:24,270
that effective from today onward,

42
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,070
the rights previously exercised

43
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:27,700
on her behalf by Mo Sanxing

44
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,980
be transferred
to Gu Zhaohe for management.

45
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:31,140
In the meantime,

46
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:33,580
Gu Zhaohe is appointed to be
the Vice President of Marketing

47
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:36,180
and collaborate with
Vice President Yu Xiling.

48
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,140
The appointment of a
Vice President of Marketing

49
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:45,830
should be decided by a board vote.

50
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:47,740
As a board member,

51
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:49,700
I oppose this.

52
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:53,550
Are there any other objections?

53
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:34,350
I hereby announce

54
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:37,580
that the resolution has been approved
with 8 votes in favor and 1 against.

55
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:52,860
Mr. Mo,

56
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:54,460
with your 28% shareholding,

57
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:55,700
if you oppose,

58
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:56,950
other shareholders must follow you.

59
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:58,550
Young Master Gu wouldn't be able
to become the Vice President.

60
00:03:58,550 --> 00:03:59,700
But, why didn't you oppose it?

61
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,700
It's Mo Lan who wants
to weaken my authority.

62
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:03,270
Having Gu Zhaohe join the company

63
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:04,140
is just the first step.

64
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,580
This is only the beginning.

65
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:11,950
She's sending her son here
to go against me.

66
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:13,900
I won't go head-to-head with her son.

67
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:16,310
It'll not only hurt the enemy,
but also ourselves.

68
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:18,580
Let's see what other tricks
she wants to play.

69
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:19,780
But what if...

70
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,540
As long as I'm in this position,

71
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:22,540
they can't

72
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:23,990
stir up any big waves.

73
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,310
Moreover,

74
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,100
it seems that Gu Zhaohe is here

75
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,950
to serve as a proxy for Yu Xiling.

76
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:35,900
What does that suggest?

77
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:38,220
It suggests that their internal goals

78
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:39,700
aren't fully aligned.

79
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:41,950
If that's the case,

80
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:46,580
then I can rest assured.

81
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:02,580
Why did you oppose me joining the board?

82
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:03,900
Was it to support Mo Sanxing

83
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,430
or simply because it's me?

84
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:08,950
Mr. Gu,

85
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:13,900
please maintain a professional distance.

86
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,510
Haven't you always kept your distance?

87
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,510
You even opposed me joining the board.

88
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:25,310
I did it to safeguard
the group's interests.

89
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:27,950
I think you're not suitable
to join the board.

90
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:29,540
Why am I not suitable?

91
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:31,340
In every way.

92
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:35,310
If you continue to be like this,
I'll call for help.

93
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,270
Go ahead.

94
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:49,220
(Pantry)

95
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:52,540
What are you doing?

96
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,580
Didn't you want
to investigate Xu Yiqing's matter?

97
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,750
I've joined the board now,
I can help you.

98
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:00,950
I don't need it.

99
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:02,780
I don't trust you right now.

100
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:08,100
Xiling,

101
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:10,580
I'm sorry.

102
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,190
I don't want to hear this right now.

103
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,990
You're like a child crying for candy.

104
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,220
How strange!

105
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:45,190
I'm not thirsty anymore suddenly.

106
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:46,100
Yeah.

107
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:46,900
You're right.

108
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:49,630
Let's go.

109
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:14,630
Mr. Kang,

110
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:16,780
I've reviewed

111
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:18,140
the investment agreement for Tianye.

112
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,430
There aren't any major issues,

113
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,780
just some minor details.

114
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:24,540
I've already asked my lawyer

115
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:25,780
to communicate with yours.

116
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:29,460
A little negotiation should resolve it.

117
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:31,750
That's great.

118
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:34,310
Let's push forward
as quickly as possible.

119
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:41,900
Wu Jiang,

120
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,340
send another car to pick up Mr. Kang.

121
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:46,780
It's better if the Tianye's
matter could get on track sooner.

122
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,750
Sacrificing is inevitable
at the critical moments.

123
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:50,190
Understood.

124
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:11,950
What are you doing?

125
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,310
Working.

126
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,340
How can I work
without an available office?

127
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:18,390
This is my office.

128
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:25,190
It only states
"Vice President's Office" there.

129
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,700
It doesn't mean
for Vice President Yu only, right?

130
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:28,270
I'm also a Vice President.

131
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:29,430
Why can't I use it?

132
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:31,020
Ms Ling, where should I put this?

133
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,750
Xia Xiaoqing, you even
help him move his stuff?

134
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,990
Ms. Ling, he's now
also a Vice President.

135
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:39,300
Put it here.

136
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:44,940
You can leave now.

137
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:47,820
Close the door.

138
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:58,020
Vice President Gu.

139
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,110
Yes?

140
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:00,710
If you insist on being like this,

141
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,750
we might not even be able

142
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,590
to maintain a basic
colleague relationship.

143
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,110
Do you understand?

144
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:09,110
Ms. Ling,

145
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:10,820
I think

146
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:13,510
working closely together will allow you

147
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:14,990
to better observe
my working capabilities

148
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:18,020
and see if I'm truly
suitable for this position.

149
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:19,940
What are you thinking?

150
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:26,940
Here we go.

151
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:29,590
The Yingqiao project

152
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:31,990
had many suspicious points
during its operation.

153
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:33,990
The project was suddenly halted,

154
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,540
and it happened at its peak.

155
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,940
Didn't you find that strange?

156
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,590
The time Xu Yiqing disappeared

157
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,630
and the Yingqiao project was halted

158
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:52,020
were almost at the same time.

159
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:54,230
I've looked into
a lot of information too,

160
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:55,780
but I couldn't find any issues.

161
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,900
You worked in the same
department as Xu Yiqing.

162
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:02,900
Did he reveal anything

163
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,020
to you about the project?

164
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:09,180
The Yingqiao project
was something our entire team

165
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,350
figured out together.

166
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:13,180
Once it is finalized,

167
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:15,510
the group took over.

168
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:17,630
Only Xu Yiqing,

169
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:18,940
as the project's general manager,

170
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,660
continued managing
and following up on it.

171
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,110
He didn't let me get involved.

172
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:25,940
We even argued about it.

173
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:27,820
Alright.

174
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,230
The explanation Xu Yiqing
didn't give you,

175
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:32,820
I'll give it to you.
