00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:15,600
Happy graduation! Here's a gift for you.

4
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:17,139
Thank you.

5
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:18,640
Can we take a photo together?

6
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:20,210
Sure!

7
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:27,330
Go closer.

8
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:29,530
Happy graduation!

9
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:32,979
Sorry.

10
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:36,240
I just didn't want to leave any
regrets for myself at graduation. Thank you.

11
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:43,410
Can I invite you for a photo?

12
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:44,920
Okay.

13
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,320
What's going on over there?
So many people.

14
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:53,240
Taking photos with
the school heartthrob!

15
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,320
If I were graduating,
I'd want a picture with him too.

16
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:58,210
(School Heartthrob?)

17
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,330
(I used to be the
school beauty back then too!)

18
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:10,720
(Smiling until my face is stiff.)

19
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:13,690
Come on, smile.

20
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:19,400
(I'm giving him
a grass 'bouquet' some more.)

21
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:24,339
Anyone else want to have a photo?

22
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:25,850
Yes, yes!

23
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,640
(He must be very arrogant later.)

24
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:30,829
My turn soon!

25
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:31,850
Thank you.

26
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,130
This angle is great!

27
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:35,720
Since I'm here anyway...

28
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:38,520
Okay, stand still!

29
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,720
- Alright, let's change another angle.
- Great!

30
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:50,059
Look, how cute!

31
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:51,520
So adorable!

32
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:53,579
Very creative!

33
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:54,610
It's cute!

34
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:59,610
I was worried that, in front of you,

35
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:05,280
I wouldn't have enough
courage to say it out loud.

36
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,760
So I chose this way

37
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:12,690
to express my feelings.

38
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:14,040
How thoughtful!

39
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:19,000
(From the first time I saw you,)

40
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:23,370
(I fell for you at first sight.)

41
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:24,739
(At first,)

42
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:27,040
(I only wanted to watch you from afar.)

43
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,829
(But as time passed,)

44
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:30,690
(my affection towards you grew.)

45
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:33,650
(I started imagining
our future together.)

46
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,669
(I want to watch)

47
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:37,970
(every sunrise and sunset with you.)

48
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:42,549
(I want your smile to be because of me.)

49
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:45,250
(I want to be a part of your future.)

50
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:47,600
(I like you,)

51
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:50,570
(more than you think.)

52
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:00,979
Say yes to her!

53
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:01,979
Xia Xiaoqing!

54
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,229
Say yes to her!

55
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:06,509
Gu Zhaohe, I like you!

56
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:21,440
Say yes to her!

57
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:22,829
Gu Zhaohe.

58
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:23,930
Xia Xiaoqing,

59
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:25,629
thank you for liking me,

60
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:26,880
but...

61
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:28,480
I'm sorry.

62
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:30,880
Did he reject her?

63
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:32,250
Why is he leaving?

64
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:34,200
Why?

65
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:35,349
He's too over.

66
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:36,650
You're here.

67
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,440
I'm just passing by.

68
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:49,090
You're just passing by?

69
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,090
Yes.

70
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:54,530
What is this?

71
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:00,530
Something I picked up by the roadside.

72
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,600
This is the best gift
I've received today.

73
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:09,440
Thank you.

74
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:11,280

here's a love letter for you.

98
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,640
The school doesn't allow dating.

Auntie, two servings of poached chicken!

113
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:58,579
It's been a long time since I met you.
You even brought your girlfriend this time.

This?

119
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:16,949
This is the so-called
famous dish you mean?

120
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:18,690
It's famous for its bad taste.

121
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:23,099

129
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:40,610
Uh, could you take a photo
of me and Senior Zhaohe?

130
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:42,880
Sure!

131
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:47,269
This is my girlfriend.

I hope that the girl I like

137
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:06,170
could cheer for me
while I play basketball.

a cheerleading dance now?

you were drunk,
