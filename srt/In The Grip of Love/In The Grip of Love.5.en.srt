3
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:29,740
Actually,

4
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,540
I didn't mean anything else

5
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,620
by helping you find work.

6
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:37,180
I just think

7
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,940
you deserve a better work opportunity.

8
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:45,979
Even if I'm going to leave,
now is not the right time.

9
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,140
Actually,

10
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,279
I realise some design flaws
in the shoes of Tianye

11
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,599
that will soon be on the market.

12
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,699
What flaws?

13
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:00,459
This is the Yu Xiling I know.

14
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:03,599
A normal person will only
realise after a month or two

15
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,300
but students in the sports department
are more sensitive about shoes.

16
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,300
I'm already asking my classmates
in school to do some tests.

17
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:10,980
The test report will be released soon.

18
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:11,940
How soon?

19
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,220
Monday before work.

20
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:16,340
Tonight.

21
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,199
We don't have much time left.

22
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,639
The shoes will be
manufactured next week.

23
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,919
We are already doing a promotion for it.

24
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:21,999
Why didn't you tell me

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,739
such a serious problem immediately?

26
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,580
What a workaholic.

27
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,019
All right.

28
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,379
Ms. Ling,

29
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:30,899
can you lend me your computer?

30
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:10,640
(Remember to heat up your breakfast!
I'm going to the office!)

31
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:14,300
(How unexpected.)

32
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,219
(He's quite considerate.)

33
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:31,779
(The outside of the shoe uses shoelaces
which has too much strain.)

34
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:33,839
(It stretches the elasticity)

35
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,559
(and flexibility of the
material at the bottom of the shoe)

36
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,820
(until it changes shape)

37
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:39,799
(and caused the shoe to create
repetitive stimulation and stress)

38
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,860
(to the pinky toe while running.)

39
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:26,638
(If Yu Xiling is related to Mo Sanxing,)

40
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:29,300
(she won't keep
so many of Xu Yiqing's things.)

41
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:32,420
(She even put a picture of them
at the most obvious spot.)

42
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:33,878
(The rumor)

43
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:36,580
(of her being with Mo Sanxing
for benefit is false.)

44
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,939
(What about the rumor
of her with Xu Yiqing?)

45
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:42,918
(If she is colluding with Xu Yiqing,)

46
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:46,179
(Why would Xu Yiqing
not contact her for three years?)

47
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,980
(Xu Yiqing.)

48
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:53,059
(Perhaps)

49
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,660
(I shouldn't be obsessed with the past.)

50
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,380
Hello, Uncle.

51
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:15,198
Come and find me.

52
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:16,499
Uncle.

53
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,499
Oh.

54
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:23,499
Did you get a gift?

55
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,699
No. I bought it.

56
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,819
You didn't go home at night.

57
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,420
Are you dating someone?

58
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,638
No, Uncle.

59
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:36,518
First of all, I'm already 23 years old.

60
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:39,679
Yes. I know. You are an adult now.

61
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,300
You have many opinions.

62
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,259
What?

63
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:46,619
Dating is a good thing

64
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:49,259
but let me give you a warning.

65
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:50,980
Remember to use protection.

66
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,999
I told you I'm working overtime.

67
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,780
Fine.

68
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,499
Speaking of which.

69
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,900
If something happens to you,

70
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:01,699
I can help you.

71
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,420
I'm not dating anyone.

72
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:06,318
You're so annoying.

73
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:09,100
If there's nothing else,
I'll be leaving.

74
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,379
Oh, Uncle.

75
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,078
You promised me

76
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:14,799
not to tell everyone
about our relationship.

77
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,379
It'll be bad
if someone else sees us together.

78
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,499
Go.

79
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:24,739
How are you getting along with Ms. Ling?

80
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,838
Not bad.

81
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:33,900
Ms. Ling is just a workaholic.

82
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,198
You don't know.

83
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,780
She is forcing me to work overtime.

84
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,699
I'm so tired.

85
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,379
You are young.

86
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:43,819
It's a good thing to suffer.

87
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,819
It's a good thing
to train under Ms. Ling.

88
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:51,579
Gu Zhaohe.

89
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:56,900
Why did you come from the parking lot?

90
00:05:57,079 --> 00:05:58,780
I took a colleague's car here.

91
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:03,020
The proposal is not bad.

92
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:05,278
There wasn't enough time.

93
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:06,438
It's already good enough.

94
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:07,479
Let's go inside together.

95
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,579
Let's go.

96
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,278
Ms. Ling, have you eaten breakfast?

97
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:11,379
I have.

98
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:17,499
Ms. Ling.

99
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:19,278
I sent the test report
for Tianye's sports shoes

100
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:20,300
to your inbox.

101
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,799
Ask someone to amend it
as soon as possible

102
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,679
and show me the new sample.

103
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,819
Yes. Got it.

104
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,059
(Have you departed?)

105
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,958
(Why don't you just give
Liu Xiaoran a red packet?)

106
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:37,259
(There's no need to come.)

107
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:50,000
(Yu Xiling)
(Gu Zhaohe, come here for a while.)

108
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,499
Gu Zhaohe,

109
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,780
do you have plans tonight?

110
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:57,599
Not yet.

111
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,078
However, it depends on

112
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:01,699
whether you have
any work for me, Ms. Ling.

113
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:07,939
Actually, it's nothing much.

114
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:11,739
I want you to do me

115
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:13,499
a small favour.

116
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:16,100
Go somewhere with me tonight.

117
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:20,499
I have other things to do
at school tonight.

118
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,660
If it ends early, I will go with you.

119
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,559
That's all.

120
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,860
You may go out.

121
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,420
Sure.

122
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:40,619
I didn't expect you to be here.

123
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:43,780
It's a classmates' gathering

124
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:45,579
so I came here to take a look.

125
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:47,939
Xiling,

126
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,239
it has been so long.

127
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,259
I didn't expect you to be here tonight.

128
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,318
Xiling is the vice president now.

129
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,540
She is a busy woman
who works overtime every day.

130
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,599
If I don't know her well,

131
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,438
I would think she was being arrogant

132
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:01,660
and look down on us.

133
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,039
Not at all.

134
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:03,919
Xiling,

135
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,579
aren't you engaged?

136
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,179
Where's your husband?

137
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,278
Her boyfriend did something bad

138
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:12,359
before the marriage.

139
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,980
He hasn't been found until now.

140
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,398
They just won't give up.

141
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:20,599
They've talked about this for so long.

142
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,420
Let's go and make a toast.

143
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:24,220
We'll leave after a while.

144
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:36,500
Wear a formal outfit for work
in the future.

145
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,079
Sorry.

146
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:40,678
I'm really busy.

147
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:41,638
I really have something to do today.

148
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:43,020
I'll see you again next time.

149
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,878
Sorry for being late.

150
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:52,260
The thing I had in school just finished.

151
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:53,878
Xiling,

152
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:55,740
who is this? Introduce us.

153
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,398
I am Gu Zhaohe.

154
00:08:57,399 --> 00:08:59,380
I am Xiling's boyfriend.

155
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,300
Hello.

156
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,780
Hello.

157
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,599
I'm sorry for being late.

158
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,620
I'll drink this glass as an apology.

159
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:12,678
Zhaohe,

160
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:14,740
what do you like about Xiling?

161
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,678
When I first met her,

162
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:23,300
she brought me
too many accidents and surprises.

163
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:27,158
I discovered how charming she is

164
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:28,819
when she is focused at work.

165
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,459
She is serious, rational,

166
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:32,620
and calm.

167
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,558
In her daily life,

168
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:37,158
she's very cute and sincere.

169
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:40,900
That is probably why I like her.

170
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:46,239
This kid is good at talking.

171
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,300
Thank you
for attending my engagement banquet.

172
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:50,999
Cheers.

173
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,140
Let us toast everyone.

174
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,219
Congratulations on your engagement!

175
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:55,579
Congratulations.

176
00:09:56,135 --> 00:09:57,638
Congratulations on your engagement.

177
00:09:57,639 --> 00:10:00,158
However, Xiling and I
have something else to do

178
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:01,459
so we'll be leaving first.

179
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,020
You're already leaving?

180
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:08,179
Take care.

181
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,660
I envy them.

182
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:15,859
Well...

183
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,500
That's enough.

184
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:33,219
Sorry.

185
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:34,780
I still arrived late.

186
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:42,219
Gu Zhaohe,

187
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:45,900
have you walked past a tunnel alone?

188
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,500
The ones that are pitch black.

189
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,500
I used to

190
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,918
hear this saying.

191
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:01,780
If you want to cut ties
in a very close relationship,

192
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:06,900
you cannot stop
the previous connection immediately.

193
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,300
Otherwise,
you'll feel a lot of reluctance

194
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,500
and repeat your mistakes.

195
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:16,979
The most suitable way

196
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,859
is to extend the time
of the process of farewell

197
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:24,780
so both parties are at a place
that can be seen by each other

198
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,020
just like nothing has happened.

199
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,339
For example,

200
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:33,979
keeping the traces of each other's lives

201
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:37,099
without any contact.

202
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:41,859
I think

203
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:45,099
that's the only thing I can do.

204
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,420
Just like
walking in a dark tunnel alone,

205
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,900
losing my way,

206
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,179
and not knowing where the exit is.

207
00:11:57,559 --> 00:11:59,219
However, I think

208
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,579
I've found my place

209
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:06,059
in the dark tunnel.

210
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,300
Anyway,

211
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:14,059
thank you.

212
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:18,099
Actually,

213
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,660
the exit is close to you.

214
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:25,979
Perhaps so.

215
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:30,219
However, the feeling

216
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,260
is like not getting your certificate

217
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:37,260
after studying
at university for four years.

218
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,420
How would you feel?

219
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,099
Sometimes, it's the same for love.

220
00:12:43,159 --> 00:12:46,179
