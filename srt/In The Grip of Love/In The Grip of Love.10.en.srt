00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:15,960
Xiling.

4
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:22,139
Mr. Mo.

5
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:23,749
We did some market research today.

6
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:25,229
Let's not talk about this.

7
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:28,139
Have dinner with me
and Mr. Kang tonight.

8
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,240
Let's talk about the acquisition.

9
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:33,000
Acquisition?

10
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:33,869
This is the reason

11
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:35,890
why we came to Jiangqing this time.

12
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:38,619
You didn't bring any formal clothes

13
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:40,570
to this market research trip.

14
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:42,829
I asked someone
to prepare an outfit for you.

15
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:44,000
It's more proper.

16
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:51,040
You are the intern, Gu Zhaohe, right?

17
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:54,210
I remember you.

18
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,890
You did well at the launch.

19
00:00:57,940 --> 00:00:59,680
Rest well tonight.

20
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:00,339
Mr. Mo.

21
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:01,019
Yes?

22
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,250
I think we can bring him along tonight.

23
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:04,419
He's new anyway.

24
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:06,490
He needs experience.

25
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:12,280
Hmm.

26
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:13,669
Sure.

27
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:15,800
He's your subordinate.
I'll listen to you.

28
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:17,410
Thank you, Mr. Mo.

29
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:20,490
Welcome.

30
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:21,770
Let's have another drink.

31
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:22,669
The honor is ours.

32
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:24,610
Thank you for your care, Mr. Kang.

33
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:29,970
Mr. Kang,

34
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:30,779
Xiling

35
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,029
is the main person in charge

36
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:34,770
of the Tianye project.

37
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,909
I've always heard
Mr. Mo mention you, Ms. Ling.

38
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:40,419
You are true to your reputation indeed.

39
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:41,520
Not at all.

40
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:43,880
Let me offer you a toast.

41
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:45,309
Sorry,

42
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:47,029
Ms. Ling cannot drink anymore.

43
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:48,570
Let me drink on her behalf.

44
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:56,269
Good.

45
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:58,720
Very good. He's young.

46
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:00,210
He's just protecting his superior.

47
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:05,280
I think she's being overprotected.

48
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:10,130
Mr. Kang, you are blaming me
for not drinking with you.

49
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:12,829
How can I blame Mr. Mo?

50
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:14,690
I mean

51
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:16,509
if you are drinking for Ms. Ling,

52
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:18,760
one glass isn't enough.

53
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:23,109
Mr. Kang is a leader in the industry

54
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,629
and also my senior.

55
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:25,669
I'm sorry to offend you.

56
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:27,979
Let me offer you a toast.

57
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,229
It is an honor of mine to come here

58
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:31,370
and learn from you.

59
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:32,899
Let's toast to our

60
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,019
a hopefully successful acquisition

61
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,509
so both parties that work together

62
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:36,829
can benefit together.

63
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:37,930
Cheers.

64
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:49,349
Mr. Kang, I'm really sorry.

65
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:51,899
I have asthma so I can't drink anymore.

66
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,090
I'll find an opportunity
to make it up to you in the future.

67
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:57,320
Sure.

68
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:11,200
Why haven't I received the money yet?

69
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:13,480
I've told you for a long time.

70
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:15,410
Why can't you pay the 800,000 yuan...

71
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:16,629
Sorry.

72
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:17,299
Hey, I...

73
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,530
It's all right. You can go.

74
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:20,280
Are you all right?

75
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:25,880
Put it on.

76
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:35,419
Ms. Ling, do you

77
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:37,570
want to go upstairs and change?

78
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:42,320
Mr. Mo, allow me to go upstairs
and deal with this.

79
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,349
Go and change your clothes.

80
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:05,440
Sure.

81
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:06,850
Oh.

82
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:10,250
What do you think
about Mo Sanxing selling Tianye?

83
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:15,699
Even a small employee like me

84
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:18,290
can see that Tianye is expanding.

85
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:20,250
We shouldn't sell it
at a time like this.

86
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:23,250
Moreover,
he is the president of a group.

87
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:24,760
Yes.

88
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:26,829
Ling Kang has a bad reputation
in the industry.

89
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:29,250
The group worked with him
on a project a few years ago

90
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:31,189
which ended in smoke.

91
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:32,290
Unfortunately,

92
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:34,539
I wasn't the one
who handled the project.

93
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,290
What is Mo Sanxing

94
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,370
trying to do?

95
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:41,000
It's not as easy as it seems.

96
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:43,810
The problem isn't with Ling Kang

97
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:45,290
but Mo Sanxing.

98
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:49,810
I will go and investigate

99
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:51,099
what project Ling Kang did

100
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,050
and

101
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:54,200
his relationship with Mo Sanxing.

102
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,629
However...

103
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:57,869
Well...

104
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:02,840
I always think Mr. Mo

105
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:04,899
has his eyes

106
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:05,960
on you.

107
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:08,749
When you get along with him...

108
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,200
Someone likes me.

109
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:12,610
Are you jealous?

110
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,130
All right.

111
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,130
I will be careful.

112
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:36,840
Let me

113
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,640
wash your clothes for you.

114
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,400
I'll go and take it.

115
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:51,440
Good night.

116
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:21,130
How's the thing I asked you to do?

117
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,520
This person is...

118
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:34,880
Xinlan Group's daughter,

119
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:36,440
Bian Jinxi.

120
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,880
Mr. Mo, what should we do next?

121
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:44,960
Yes. Zhaohe's internship
is ending soon, right?

122
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:46,050
Yes.

123
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,069
Mr. Gu

124
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:48,629
should pass the internship.

125
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:50,050
Zhaohe is young.

126
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,050
He is too impatient.

127
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:54,050
He's a young man.

128
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:57,840
If he doesn't make mistakes and fall,

129
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:01,320
he won't know what's good for him.

130
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:02,400
I understand.

131
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:03,760
Mr. Mo,

132
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:06,509
Mr. Gu is working under Ms. Ling.

133
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:07,829
If something happens to him,

134
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:10,640
it will trouble Ms. Ling as well.

135
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:13,269
Sometimes,

136
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:15,050
if we don't back her into a corner,

137
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,730
she won't turn back.

138
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:23,810
(I don't think
Mo Sanxing is only using Xiling)

139
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:27,000
(for the acquisition.)

140
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,640
(What should I do)

141
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:30,290
(to protect Xiling?)

142
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,099
Why haven't you packed your luggage?

143
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,200
I'll do it later.

144
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:50,440
Let me help you dry your hair.

145
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:55,219
I checked

146
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:57,200
some projects just now

147
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:59,699
and realised Ling Kang had an agreement

148
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,840
with Xinlan Group.

149
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:03,659
They bought Elly's operating rights

150
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:06,019
and used a loophole in the contract

151
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,749
which almost
infringed Xinlan's interests.

152
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,760
Thankfully, it was halted in time.

153
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:11,520
Sanxing's

154
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,749
Yingqiao project

155
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,570
was almost acquired
by Ling Kang as well.

156
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:18,690
Later, someone else handled it.

157
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:21,250
Yingqiao

158
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:23,640
was handled by Xu Yiqing.

159
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,610
That's more reason to stop Mo Sanxing

160
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:31,349
from selling Tianye.

161
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:33,480
However, we can't stop anything

162
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:35,530
if we are not
in the board of directors' meeting.

163
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,139
When the Yingqiao project was halted,

164
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:40,690
the company wasn't audited internally.

165
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:43,200
It ended without a conclusion.

166
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:44,320
Right now,

167
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:47,570
I'm just an executive vice president.

168
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,419
You are just an intern.

169
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:52,010
If we want to do something,

170
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:54,480
we still can't do anything.

171
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,930
Besides, Mo Sanxing

172
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:00,419
is not someone
who will leave any trails behind.

173
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,080
Don't overthink.

174
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:05,050
We will surely find a way, right?

175
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:12,480
Do you like doing chores so much?

176
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:20,360
In the future,

177
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:22,320
you'll be the one doing chores.

178
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:35,139
We went to Jiangqing
for market research this time.

179
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:37,939
("Tianye" Brand Sales Data)
We realised the main reason

180
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:40,539
that Tianye's sales cannot increase
in Jiangqing during the second quarter

181
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:41,939
is because of Huier

182
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:44,989
doing year-round 70% discounts
at Jiangqing and its surrounding areas

183
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:47,120
("Tianye" Brand Sales Data)
with a small profit strategy.

184
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:48,989
If our products

185
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:50,869
are sold at such a large discount,

186
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:53,050
it might not even be enough
to cover the cost.

187
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:56,080
We are not engaging in a price war.

188
00:09:58,820 --> 00:09:59,840
