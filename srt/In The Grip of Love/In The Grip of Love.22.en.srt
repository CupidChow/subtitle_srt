3
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:15,570
I'm very happy today.

4
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:17,050
How about you?

5
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:20,530
As long as you're happy, I'm happy too.

6
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:26,330
I can tell you're very happy.

7
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:29,050
Yes,

8
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:30,680
I'm very happy.

9
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:38,850
You confessed to me

10
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:40,450
in front of so many people today.

11
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:42,530
Weren't you afraid I'd reject you?

12
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:45,450
Rejected me?

13
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:47,850
If you rejected me, then so be it.

14
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:49,739
It's normal for athletes to experience

15
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:51,850
loss and win on the field.

16
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:54,920
As long as you have the courage
to stand on the starting line,

17
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:56,570
there's always another chance.

18
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:00,450
Moreover, I'm entitled to enjoy

19
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,880
an entire day of dating with you.

20
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:08,720
Attending your graduation ceremony today

21
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,250
reminded me

22
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:14,280
of my days of being
a student ten years ago.

23
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,490
The feeling is so amazing.

24
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,970
But, it

25
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:23,610
also reminds me

26
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:26,360
of the gap between us.

27
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:40,280
I'll prove to everyone

28
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:43,440
that I can protect you.

29
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:46,130
One day, you'll believe me.

30
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:48,720
I'll make you see

31
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:51,160
that the only thing standing between us

32
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:55,000
is just one step from you.

33
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:01,949
Even though I'm younger than you,

34
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:03,570
I'm taller than you.

35
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:16,160
It'd be nice if only
today could last forever.

36
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:42,600
Are you hungry?

37
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,949
It seems there are no seats left.

38
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:54,760
You may go home first.
I'll go get some food for you.

39
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:56,480
I'll be quick.

40
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:01,179
Boss, one serving of crayfish, please.

41
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,090
What flavor do you want?

42
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:04,040
Spicy flavor.

43
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:06,720
Alright, just a moment.

44
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:31,250
Why are you coming back so soon?

45
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:34,850
Get out of my house!

46
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:42,699
I didn't expect my daughter

47
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,570
to live in such a nice place.

48
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:48,440
This is the first time
I've been in here.

49
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:52,690
Not bad, huh?

50
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:55,560
I don't have this much money.
This house is rented.

51
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,040
Look at you.

52
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:59,629
Is this how a daughter

53
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,179
talk to her father?

54
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,139
I'm telling you,

55
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:04,389
if it weren't for that boy
meddling last time,

56
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:06,250
I'd have given you a 'good' treat.

57
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,570
Are you leaving or not?

58
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:10,349
- If you're not, I'll call the police!
- Don't act it.

59
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:11,690
Don't bluff me with that.

60
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:13,829
Let me tell you why I'm here today.

61
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:15,440
Give me some money.

62
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:17,080
I have no much money now.

63
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,760
I don't have money,
and I won't give you any.

64
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,000
What!

65
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:24,880
No money?

66
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:27,309
Li Xiaolan!

67
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:28,730
I warned you,

68
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:32,170
don't make me lose my temper!

69
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:35,610
I'm not Li Xiaolan anymore!

70
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,949
I have nothing to do with you.

71
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,250
Oh?

72
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:41,960
Nothing to do with me?

73
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:44,690
You don't want to recognize your father,

74
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:46,989
but you spend it
on that little handsome boy.

75
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:49,080
Have you no shame?

76
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:53,170
I heard

77
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:56,130
you've joined the board

78
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:57,930
of a big company.

79
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:00,370
I want 200,000 yuan today.

80
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:04,050
You can't tell me you don't have it.

81
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:07,949
Did you hear it?

82
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,779
I don't have money.

83
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:12,019
Li Daogang, just kill me right now!

84
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,050
Because if you don't,

85
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,899
I swear I won't let you off.

86
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,080
Do you understand me?

87
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,749
You said it yourself.

88
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,189
Give me the money,

89
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:22,339
and I'll leave right away.

90
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:24,579
Then, we'll be strangers.

91
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:26,930
I have no money! Get out of here!

92
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:30,290
Let me teach you a lesson today.

93
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:35,440
Are you okay?

94
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,880
It's this handsome boy again.

95
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:39,629
She's been giving you money, hasn't she?

96
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:42,080
You're just a freeloader, huh?

97
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:43,730
If you hit me again,

98
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:46,290
it won't just cost you 1 million.
It'll be 2 million.

99
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:48,730
No, 3 million.

100
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:52,520
Li Xiaolan, this isn't over!

101
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:53,640
Gu Zhaohe.

102
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,290
I'm sorry.

103
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:06,690
I'm so sorry.

104
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,690
It's fine. It's fine now.

105
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,690
Do you need to go to the hospital?

106
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,760
I'm fine.

107
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:28,200
It just hurts a little.

108
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:30,810
And I feel a bit dizzy.

109
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,640
Here, eat a piece of candy,
and you won't feel hurt.

110
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:51,389
My dad used to say,

111
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:54,290
when you taste something sweet,
you forget the pain.

112
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:57,250
Then, I feel no pain anymore.

113
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,520
This is the first time

114
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,130
I've heard you mention your dad.

115
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:13,490
My dad passed away when I was little.

116
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:16,930
A car accident.

117
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:21,080
I'm sorry to bring up that.

118
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,539
He passed away

119
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:29,050
when I was only five.

120
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,440
So, all my memories of him

121
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:34,949
are of him giving me candy

122
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:36,930
whenever I got hurt.

123
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:38,960
Do you know?

124
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:41,570
My dad was a hurdler.

125
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:45,200
That's why I became an athlete.

126
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:46,760
Because

127
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:49,000
every time I'm on the track,

128
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:50,960
I feel like

129
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:52,869
my dad

130
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:54,539
is with me,

131
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,690
just in a different form.

132
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:58,810
Sports healed me.

133
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:03,080
So,

134
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:07,200
now I want to heal you

135
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:08,960
in my own way.

136
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,629
We can't choose

137
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:14,880
the family we're born into,

138
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:20,050
but we can choose how to face it.

139
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:21,930
Right?

140
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:28,320
Do you want some candy?

141
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:29,640
Yes.

142
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:36,960
