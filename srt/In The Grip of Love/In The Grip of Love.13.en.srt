3
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:21,269
Welcome back!

4
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:22,170
Welcome back!

5
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:25,890
Congratulations, Gu Zhaohe.

6
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:27,749
We knew you'd never do such a thing.

7
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:28,570
Exactly.

8
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:30,789
I heard you all were worried about me.

9
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:31,890
Thanks.

10
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:34,090
Don't stand on ceremony.

11
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:36,339
I've bought you coffee.

12
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:37,789
You should've told us sooner. Quick.

13
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:38,589
There you go.

14
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:39,720
I'm so thirsty.

15
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:41,850
Do we have iced latte here?

16
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:42,979
Hold on.

17
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:44,269
I'll hand these drinks to you all.

18
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:44,909
This is yours.

19
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:45,720
Thanks.

20
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:48,189
I've got Ms. Ling one too.

21
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:49,170
Okay.

22
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:56,979
This is no fun.

23
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:58,280
You're surely a punctual one.

24
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:04,320
Here's your coffee.

25
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:12,610
Mine is sugarless.

26
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:19,920
It's sweet now.

27
00:01:29,818 --> 00:01:34,760
(Always as sweet as these sweets)

28
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:54,880
(Mo Sanxing asked to see Zhaohe now.)

29
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,320
(Could it be that he's trying
to put him on the spot again?)

30
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:11,370
You neither picked up your phone

31
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:12,970
nor replied to my texts.

32
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,480
Are you still mad
about what happened days ago?

33
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,970
I'm not mad.

34
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:22,269
You have your reasons

35
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:24,000
for doing what you do, no?

36
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:28,810
How are you coping

37
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:30,570
now that you're back in office?

38
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,269
What's there to worry about?

39
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:36,570
I'm just a trivial employee here.

40
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,299
Since I'm back in office,

41
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,549
I will definitely work hard,

42
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:41,760
Mr. Mo.

43
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:45,949
Never use that tone

44
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:47,850
when you're in office.

45
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,320
That's very unprofessional.

46
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:52,200
I don't talk like that in office.

47
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,690
Not with your uncle too.

48
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:57,880
You were only away for a few days,

49
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:00,090
and you're being disrespectful.

50
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,459
You're an adult now.

51
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:06,320
It's normal to have your own thoughts.

52
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,320
And I won't say no to you moving out.

53
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:12,320
There are still your belongings at home.

54
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:15,019
Come home and sort them out tonight.

55
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:17,600
We will have dinner together.

56
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,530
Well,

57
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:22,979
you are supposed to stay with me

58
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:24,690
ever since you went to school.

59
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:27,160
In fact, you're rarely home.

60
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:29,650
You're moving out now.

61
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:32,410
But you're reluctant
to have a farewell dinner with me?

62
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:35,000
Fine.

63
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,130
I got it.

64
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:41,690
Zhaohe.

65
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:43,810
Yes?

66
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:47,069
Come home early tonight.

67
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:49,720
I will have the maid
to make your favorite dishes.

68
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:51,370
Okay.

69
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:53,250
I'm off.

70
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:12,250
(They're so close.)

71
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,309
What's in your mind?

72
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:29,440
It's still full.

73
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:30,810
Well...

74
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,520
What did Mr. Mo see you for?

75
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:41,370
Well...

76
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,610
It was about the email incident.

77
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:00,810
That's it?

78
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,400
Yes.

79
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:05,960
Don't you have

80
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:09,370
anything else to say to me?

81
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:17,130
There is something.

82
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:20,370
Go ahead.

83
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,520
I'm sorry.

84
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:25,400
I can't eat dinner with you tonight.

85
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:27,400
Wait for me at home.

86
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,810
Ms. Ling hasn't left the office, Mr. Mo.

87
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:13,840
She's been working since this afternoon.

88
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:15,880
But she saw it all then.

89
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:20,099
Yu Xiling is a smart person.

90
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,869
Yet she's too smart for her own good

91
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:24,170
that she believes in nothing
but her own judgments.

92
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:27,250
Let her doubt herself.

93
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:29,610
She will then believe

94
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,459
whatever I say.

95
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:32,570
What if

96
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:35,050
Young Master Gu has
made his identity known?

97
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:41,810
Would Zhaohe dare tell her the reason

98
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:44,170
why he joined Sanxing?

99
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:50,389
Hello, Mr. Mo.

100
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:52,099
Xiling.

101
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,610
You're still at work, aren't you?

102
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:54,829
Come over tonight.

103
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:56,440
Let's have dinner together.

104
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,490
I have something to tell you about.

105
00:06:58,750 --> 00:06:59,960
Mr. Mo.

106
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:02,810
I don't think it's appropriate

107
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:05,000
to have a business talk at your place.

108
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:08,389
Why stand on ceremony?

109
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:10,659
I'd like to talk to you

110
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,000
about the shareholders meeting.

111
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:14,680
It's not convenient to do so outside.

112
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:17,690
Sure, I'll be right there.

113
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,130
Uncle.

114
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,320
You're all packed?

115
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:48,520
Yes, I'm done here.

116
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:51,269
Although you're seldom home,

117
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:52,370
this is

118
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,490
your home, after all.

119
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:56,810
You will come home once in a while.

120
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:59,080
Now that you're moving out,

121
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:02,840
I wonder
if you will still come and visit me.

122
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:05,779
Here,

123
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:06,539
take a seat.

124
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:08,339
Let's eat first, Uncle.

125
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,760
You're home late.
The dishes have all gone cold.

126
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:13,570
No rush, we'll do so in a while.

127
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,930
We will be having a guest.

128
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:39,440
Zhaohe.

129
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:43,890
I would like you to know that,

130
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:45,989
no matter what happens,

131
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:48,170
we are still family.

132
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,170
Yes.

133
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:51,389
I've been there since you were a kid.

134
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:52,749
Thus, whatever I do,

135
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,840
it's definitely for your sake.

136
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:58,320
I know.

137
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:04,480
Uncle.

138
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:05,170
Yes?

139
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:07,650
Since the guest isn't here yet,

140
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:09,650
I'd like to tell you about something.

141
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:10,530
Go ahead.

142
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:14,120
Well...

143
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,349
Actually, Yu Xiling and I are...

144
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:18,480
You fancy Yu Xiling.

145
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:24,930
I wouldn't do myself justice

146
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:27,200
if I hadn't figured that out.

147
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:30,240
Zhaohe.

148
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,690
You're merely in your 20s.

149
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:35,960
Yu Xiling isn't

150
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:38,480
as simple as you imagine.

151
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:40,749
Uncle.

152
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:41,389
I...

153
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:41,899
Mr. Mo.

154
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,290
Ms. Ling is here.

155
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,120
Xiling?

156
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,139
Here you are, Xiling.

157
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,480
Come.

158
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,530
Don't just stand there.

159
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:19,840
Xiling.

160
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:23,120
Let me introduce him to you again.

161
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:25,930
This is Gu Zhaohe,

162
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,690
my nephew.

163
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,690
Well, I didn't know better.

164
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:51,819
Xiling,

165
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,019
please hear me out.

166
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,109
Initially, I thought...

167
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:56,650
Didn't you ask me here
for a business talk, Mr. Mo?

168
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,290
Well,

169
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,480
you wanted to introduce...

170
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,840
Mr. Gu

171
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:08,290
to me, right?

172
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:14,080
Well, Mr. Gu,

173
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:17,170
what would you like to talk to me about?

174
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:19,480
Xiling.

175
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:20,779
Let's talk at home, okay?

176
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,960
But Mr. Mo wants
to talk about work with me.

177
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:27,139
What is this, Zhaohe?

178
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:29,690
Xiling is my guest here.

179
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:33,659
The dinner is ready.

180
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,160
We will talk about it while eating.

181
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:35,810
Uncle...

182
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:38,480
Forget about the dinner.

183
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:41,440
Sure, we shall talk about it
while eating.

184
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:49,080
Today, I would like to thank you

185
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:52,109
for what you did for the email incident.

186
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:55,410
Luckily, you helped Zhaohe
and got to the bottom of it.

187
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:57,349
Well,

188
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:59,989
I really couldn't defend Zhaohe

189
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:01,290
at all.

190
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:04,290
If not, that'd draw suspicion
from others.

191
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:09,050
Indeed.

192
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:11,690
Human nature is
unpredictable, after all.

193
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,650
For example,

194
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,930
those who appear to be the most innocent

195
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:21,840
tend to be good liars.

196
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:26,890
You know me the best.

197
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:29,770
Well,

198
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:32,050
Zhaohe is all-rounded.

199
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:34,290
But he's just too young.

200
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:36,650
If he doesn't learn some life lessons

201
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,320
from failures now,

202
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:40,890
he will have a hard time in the future.

203
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:43,320
Mr. Mo.

204
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:47,290
I think you've underestimated Zhaohe.

205
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:48,690
Yes.

206
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:52,050
I know this nephew of mine the best.

207
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,440
In fact,

208
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:55,659
I thought of asking for your help

209
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:57,749
to show him guidance at work.

210
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:00,059
But this brat rejected that idea.

211
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:02,080
He refused to disclose our relationship.

212
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:04,349
Well, what could I have done?

213
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:07,050
I could just let him do
as he pleased, no?

214
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:12,229
Well,

215
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:14,000
I haven't helped much in that regard.

216
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:18,440
Mr. Gu has been nothing
but dedicated and hardworking.

217
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:22,389
I've learned much from him.

218
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:24,290
This brat might get arrogant

219
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,930
from having heard what you've just said.

220
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:29,960
Zhaohe.

221
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:34,050
You are young,
and you need to keep learning.

222
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,480
When he was home,
he couldn't stop complaining

223
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:39,989
about how strict
his workaholic superior was

224
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:41,570
and all the mistreatment he's had.

225
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:42,720
Didn't you?

226
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:44,930
Yet rest assured,

227
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:47,200
I already gave him an earful.

228
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,320
That is my fault, Mr. Mo.

229
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:53,320
I failed to recognize

230
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:56,440
Mr. Gu's

231
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:59,530
grievances and hidden secrets.

232
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,269
It is my fault.

233
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:04,290
Of course not, Mr. Gu.

234
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:05,650
Well,

235
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:08,320
you lowered yourself to be my intern.

236
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:09,840
It's nothing but my honor.

237
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,290
Xiling.

238
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:17,720
Stop selling yourself short.

239
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,659
It was his own idea

240
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:23,890
to be your intern.

241
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:27,440
He had all of your work habits
and preferences

242
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:28,629
figured out

243
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:31,589
before going onboard.

244
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:34,539
He's the most dedicated intern ever.

245
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,120
He's got a bright future ahead!

246
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:48,050
I thank you for your efforts, Mr. Gu.

247
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:51,890
Well, Mr. Gu, are there

248
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:55,120
any other things you have done

249
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:57,240
that I'm not aware of?

250
00:14:57,590 --> 00:15:00,240
If yes, I shall express my gratitude
for them all.

251
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:02,819
Why stand on ceremony?

252
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,080
Stop it.

253
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:07,539
If you have any problem with me,
just come at me, Uncle.

254
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,360
Stop putting Xiling on the spot, okay?

255
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:13,480
Let's go.

256
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:17,440
