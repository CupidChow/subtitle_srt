3
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:22,640
Tell me what's going on.

4
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:26,389
Previously, there was an employee

5
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:28,920
in the financial department
named Zhou Ju.

6
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:30,770
Here's her photo.

7
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:34,619
She was in charge
for the Yingqiao project.

8
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,509
However, after the project was halted,

9
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:39,090
she was inexplicably
laid off by the company.

10
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,410
My mom has been trying
to look for her for years,

11
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:42,720
but couldn't.

12
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:45,280
Yet, she reappeared recently.

13
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:48,170
She's in such a hurry to appear.

14
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:52,059
Could this be bait someone set for us?

15
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:53,059
Unlikely.

16
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:55,059
Zhou Ju's child just
started kindergarten,

17
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:57,850
that increases her involvement
in the community activity,

18
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:01,320
leaving records at many institutions.

19
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:08,130
Does she have any evidence?

20
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:11,029
No direct evidence,

21
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:12,160
but she has

22
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:15,280
the accounts for four stores

23
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:18,330
that can prove
they sold counterfeit goods,

24
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:20,109
unlike what was submitted to the group.

25
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:22,499
She intended to submit it to the group,

26
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,499
but before she could,

27
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,610
Mo Sanxing fired her.

28
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:30,520
So,

29
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:33,520
is your mom ready for this?

30
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:35,850
Yes.

31
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:39,440
But...

32
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:42,770
But she told you not to tell me, right?

33
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:45,490
How did you know?

34
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:51,770
I'm Xu Yiqing's ex-girlfriend

35
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:56,280
and was brought
into the group by Mo Sanxing.

36
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,139
If I were her,

37
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,549
I would be suspicious too.

38
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:00,640
It's normal.

39
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:04,189
My mom will convene
the board meeting soon,

40
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:06,160
and Zhou Ju will be there.

41
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:10,760
I want you to pick up Zhou Ju.

42
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,000
But, will your mom agree?

43
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,880
This is the only chance
to take down Mo Sanxing.

44
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:34,979
If you can bring Zhou Ju to the scene,

45
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:37,320
my mom won't suspect you.

46
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:52,320
Why are you here?

47
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:55,650
Buy something.

48
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:04,389
That's odd. You don't live nearby.

49
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:06,320
Why are you buying things here?

50
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,139
The snacks here are good.

51
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,280
Other stores don't have them.

52
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,130
Fine.

53
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:31,699
I...

54
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,629
I've bought all the best snacks.

55
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,720
Do you want to eat them together?

56
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,419
The current situation of the company
is complicated. You'd be careful.

57
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:48,000
Don't go around carefree all the time.

58
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:50,509
Remember to check the formatting

59
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:52,419
and typos

60
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:53,880
before submitting reports.

61
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:54,979
Oh,

62
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,579
you must double-check the recipients

63
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:57,859
before sending emails.

64
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:00,130
You always get the CC wrong.

65
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:04,069
Also, if someone asks

66
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:06,139
about Sister Ling,
don't simply share anything.

67
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:07,789
If something happens, it'll be...

68
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:09,090
Are you still upset?

69
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:15,320
I'm fine.

70
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:18,520
I've been wanting to resign anyway.

71
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:26,320
Honestly, if you're not
in Sanxing anymore,

72
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,130
I don't feel like staying either.

73
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,640
It's pointless.

74
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:31,880
By the way,

75
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:35,130
another company tried
to recruit me recently.

76
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:36,880
Do you want to go with me?

77
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,440
So, we can be colleagues some more.

78
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:43,170
You're that eager to work with me?

79
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,429
Sister Ling has just left

80
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:48,320
and she told me quite a lot.

81
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,250
What did she say?

82
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:53,730
She said,

83
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:58,050
she would roll out the red carpet
to invite me back to the company.

84
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:00,480
That's a must.

85
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,629
And, she said someone likes me.

86
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:02,490
What?

87
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:05,170
What? I...

88
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:06,309
I...

89
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:07,339
Forget it.

90
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,139
Let's talk about it
when I return to the company.

91
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:10,840
Just focus on your work for now.

92
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:28,880
The few last good pieces are mine again.

93
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:35,459
You know,

94
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,760
I'm such a lucky girl.

95
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:57,760
Wu, how many times
have I told you to knock?

96
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:05,099
Sister!

97
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,760
It's been a long time since I met you.

98
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:09,389
When did you get back?

99
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:10,509
Why didn't you inform me?

100
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:12,250
I could send someone to pick you up.

101
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:17,539
I went to the company

102
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:19,490
to meet Zhaohe two days ago,

103
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,690
and I even witnessed quite the drama.

104
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,760
No one told you?

105
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:26,640
No.

106
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:28,539
If I'd known,

107
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:30,880
I'd have visited you immediately.

108
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:50,730
I want to convene a shareholder meeting.

109
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:54,290
Sure,

110
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,869
but is there something urgent?

111
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:57,960
Yes.

112
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:02,930
I want to discuss
the Yingqiao account with you.

113
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:08,080
Back then, the group suffered losses,

114
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:11,629
but the stores were gaining profits.

115
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:15,370
I heard that they were
selling non-Yingqiao products.

116
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:19,690
So, I need to investigate
this 1-billion-yuan debt

117
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,080
thoroughly.

118
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:27,200
It's my fault.

119
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,730
I didn't manage well.

120
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,370
I have the responsibility for that.

121
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,200
It seems

122
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:35,389
that Yingqiao's matter

123
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:38,130
remains a sore spot for everyone.

124
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,080
But recently,

125
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:44,629
Yu Xiling initiated

126
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,509
an internal review of Yingqiao matter

127
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:47,760
during a board meeting,

128
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:50,490
and it ended up no issues were found.

129
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:55,459
If the two accounts you mentioned

130
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:56,930
are just speculation,

131
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:59,000
it would turn out badly.

132
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:02,130
If we keep dwelling on this,

133
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:04,170
the other shareholders
might have bad assumptions.

134
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:08,130
Yu Xiling is Yu Xiling.

135
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:12,490
I'm not just conducting
an internal review.

136
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:28,130
Sister,

137
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:31,349
as soon as you come back,

138
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:32,650
you give me a hard time.

139
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:37,440
After all, I'm the one
who manage the group now.

140
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:38,819
Back then,

141
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,690
it was happened under my watch.

142
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:45,440
Is this necessary for you to do this?

143
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,939
For years,

144
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:51,480
whether it's Yingqiao or Lingkang,

145
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:53,480
both have developed well.

146
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:54,650
Yeah.

147
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,200
But, you sold them.

148
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:00,720
What's going on behind them?

149
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,320
You know the answer.

150
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,410
We've lost 1 billion back then.

151
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:09,360
But, if more losses incur now,

152
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:11,480
it's far more than 1 billion.

153
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:15,650
I have to answer to the shareholders

154
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:19,410
and our father.

155
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:40,050
All you're saying

156
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:43,080
is groundless.

157
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:46,170
This is our father's company.

158
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:48,899
This is our company as well.

159
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,539
Everything I do

160
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,810
is for the advantage of the company.

161
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,059
What you've mentioned earlier

162
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:58,010
has been investigated over and over,

163
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:00,410
there was no issue found.

164
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,770
Speaking of the acquisition of Tianye,

165
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:05,419
I immediately halted it

166
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:06,779
as soon as I sensed something amiss.

167
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,170
We didn't proceed anymore.

168
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:11,320
The rumors spread

169
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,410
for a certain reason.

170
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:16,960
Sanxing,

171
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:21,320
are you trying to ruin it all?

172
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:23,509
Sanxing Group

173
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:26,360
is the last gift our father left to us.

174
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,810
Can you

175
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,600
bear to ruin it?

176
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:40,170
I've never forgotten
our father's expectation.

177
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:42,819
That's why

178
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:46,120
I've worked tirelessly
for the group all these years.

179
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:48,650
You're in the same industry.

180
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:51,819
You know how competitive
it is in this industry.

181
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:54,570
They play whatever tricks
to get what they want.

182
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:58,120
We can't be

183
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:00,930
the laughing stock of others.

184
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:05,840
My dear brother.

185
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:11,410
This is the only chance

186
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:14,080
we have left.

187
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:16,890
I've never

188
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:19,570
seen you as an enemy.

189
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:24,480
My dear sister,

190
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:29,080
why don't you believe me?

191
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:32,480
The company occasionally suffers losses.

192
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,120
That's normal.

193
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:37,770
Am I not managing the company well now?

194
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,469
It's pretty good now.

195
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:41,240
We're making profits every day.

196
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:47,320
You should just focus
on managing your overseas ventures.

197
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:50,440
You're the major shareholder of Sanxing.

198
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:53,640
Your support has been a huge help to me.
I've always remembered that.

199
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:56,080
Regarding your share of Sanxing Group,

200
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:59,530
I will never shortchange you.

201
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:09,419
If you reveal it to me now,

202
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,200
everything is just a family matter.

203
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:14,530
But if it escalates
to the board meeting,

204
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,939
it becomes a company issue.

205
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:19,480
At that point, I can only
handle it professionally.

206
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:40,120
Come on, Xiling.

207
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:41,690
Let's have a drink.

208
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,440
Mr. Mo, if you have something to say,
please just say it directly.

209
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:51,650
Why are you being so formal with me?

210
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,539
Do you still remember

211
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:04,480
what I told you at the time when I
recommended you to join the board?

212
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:10,080
How about we fulfill that promise now?

213
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:12,690
I've always done everything I can

214
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:14,720
to assist Mr. Mo.

215
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:17,290
Really?

216
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,109
But, why do I feel like

217
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:22,229
you've been blinded by love lately?

218
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:24,770
You don't even know
which side you should stand anymore.

219
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,530
Don't be nervous.

220
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,600
I'm just speaking my mind.

221
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:33,290
But, let me be honest,

222
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:35,509
young people like Gu Zhaohe

223
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:37,960
make grand promises easily.

224
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:41,930
Being blinded by fleeting sweetness,

225
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,690
I do understand.

226
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:46,139
If you think carefully,

227
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:48,170
for people like us at our age,

228
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,480
if we take those things seriously,

229
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:53,080
we'll end up paying a heavy price.

230
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,890
Mr. Mo, I think you're mistaken.

231
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:58,930
My relationship with Zhaohe

232
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:02,080
will not affect
my performance at Sanxing.

233
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:04,819
Besides, for people like us at our age,

234
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,720
how could we ever

235
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:08,890
confuse work and love?

236
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:11,010
See?

237
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:14,890
You still haven't learned your lesson
after all these years.

238
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:17,960
Didn't you get enough of it
from your experience with Xu Yiqing?

239
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:22,290
Are you too innocent?

240
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:24,930
The disappearance

241
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,570
of Xu Yiqing.

242
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:31,080
Does it have nothing to do with you?

243
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:35,530
Xu Yiqing embezzled
a large amount of company funds

244
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:38,659
and absconded with the money,
his whereabouts are unknown.

245
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:42,410
He almost got both you and me
into the trouble.

246
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:46,650
Everyone in the company
knows about this.

247
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:58,440
When you wanted to join
the Yingqiao project back then,

248
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:01,050
I fully supported you.

249
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:03,570
But, Xu Yiqing insisted
on refusing that.

250
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:06,869
Looking back now, it was because he was
afraid you'd find out what he was doing.

251
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:08,720
He betrayed my trust.

252
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:10,840
I've let that go.

253
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:16,770
But, the point is
he abandoned you for money.

254
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:22,120
Are you still holding onto
unrealistic thought about him?

255
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,349
Well,

256
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:32,570
Gu Zhaohe is not short of money.

257
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,840
But, what's his identity?

258
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:38,200
He's the young master
of the Sanxing Group.

259
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:41,200
He has too many options.

260
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:42,469
He's still young anyway.

261
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:44,589
Men at his age don't even have
a stable aesthetic sense.

262
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:46,170
You shouldn't make mistakes.

263
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:50,240
One day, when he's tired of you,

264
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:51,930
or he no longer loves you,

265
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:53,779
he could just leave like that.

266
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:55,890
The whole world is his fallback option.

267
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,010
How about you?

268
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:01,480
Are you silly?

269
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:04,080
Will you go begging him?

270
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,320
Be realistic.

271
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:16,890
I'm different.

272
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:20,600
I really like you.

273
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:23,770
Over the years,

274
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:27,480
I've invested so much
effort nurturing you.

275
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:30,200
And, you become a capable person now.

276
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:34,570
I even helped you cross the threshold
and brought you into the board of directors.

277
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:38,810
I gave that 3% stake to you.

278
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:40,770
What does that mean?

279
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:43,659
I can give up the money and status.

280
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:46,770
But, I can't bear to lose you.

281
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:49,010
If I can give you shares,

282
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,840
I can also take them back.

283
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:02,080
I'm the best choice for you.

284
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:09,250
Gu Zhaohe is different from you.

285
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,920
Our relationship

286
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:20,320
has never been

287
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,970
about any kind of exchange.

288
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:33,539
Enjoy yourself. I get to go now.

289
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,570
Don't rush to reject me.

290
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:39,730
Take your time to think about it.

291
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:44,570
Gu Zhaohe is just a kid now.

292
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:48,810
Whether it's share or the company,

293
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:50,539
all of it

294
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:52,160
belongs to his mother.

295
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:54,880
All belongs to his mother.

296
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:12,709
Tomorrow is the emergency board meeting.

297
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:15,120
Let me confirm the whereabouts
of Zhou Ju with you one more time.

298
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:19,770
Here's Zhou Ju's photo,

299
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,269
address,

300
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:23,160
and her contact information.

301
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:25,360
Bring her to the meeting tomorrow.

302
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:26,189
She has the records

303
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:27,920
of the accounts of the four stores.

304
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:30,859
As long as we successfully
expose Mo Sanxing,

305
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,810
my mom will definitely trust you.

306
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:40,290
You can rest assured.

307
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:44,730
Relax.

308
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:48,210
You're the person I like most.

309
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:54,640
I want my mom to like you too.

310
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:56,880
Is that okay?

311
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:29,250
Hello.

312
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:32,400
Mr. Mo, I found Zhou Ju.

313
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,400
She's in contact with your sister.

314
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:40,970
It seems

315
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:43,579
Mo Lan is acting hastily.

316
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:44,920
What should we do now?

317
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:54,840
As for my sister,

318
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:58,680
all she wants is to kick me
out of the company.

319
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:03,530
If you don't make her fall hard
when she's most confident,

320
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:07,290
you never know what trouble
she'll stir up in the future.

321
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:09,680
Mr. Mo,

322
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:12,080
you mean...

323
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:19,400
Let her fall hard in times of need.
