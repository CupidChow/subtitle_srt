Sorry, Fumiya.

00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:11,390
Don't make light of this.

3
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:15,190
Listen when I'm saying something serious.

4
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:30,650
It's my birthday, so don't be so hard on me.

5
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,599
I'm fine with cleaning up, but don't I get any thanks?

6
00:00:38,599 --> 00:00:40,119
Then just say it.

7
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,529
You should already know.

8
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:44,030
Well, I don't.

9
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:46,080
You have to say something.

10
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:50,370
Even if we stay together,

11
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:53,160
it'll just be hard on both of us.

12
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:58,400
What the hell? Are you breaking up with me?

13
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:08,300

Ritsu?

29
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:45,690
He left his phone.

00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,489
Shuji?

32
00:03:05,489 --> 00:03:10,840
Fumiya? Actually, my brother...

33
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,469
had a head-on collision with a bike.

34
00:03:15,469 --> 00:03:18,889
He was empty-handed, so they couldn't identify him.

35
00:03:18,889 --> 00:03:22,120
This happened because of what I said.

36
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,179
Oh, Shuji.

37
00:03:29,179 --> 00:03:32,279
Over there. Ritsu just woke up.

38
00:03:32,279 --> 00:03:34,900
The doctor's checking on him now.

39
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:41,730
Ritsu, are you okay?

40
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:43,829
He has a slight concussion,

41
00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:48,019
so it might take some time before he's back to his old self.

42
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:50,589
Let him rest as much as possible.

43
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:52,223
OK.

44
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:55,610
Are you family?

00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:05,180
Oh, I'm a friend. His roommate.

46
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,680
I see.

47
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,759
Let's go home together for now.

48
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:14,199
Take care then.

49
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:16,090
Thank you.

50
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:17,690
Are you okay?

51
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:28,040
Don't you have to work tomorrow, Fumiya?

52
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:32,700
I'll take care of Ritsu tomorrow.

53
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:35,560
Thanks.

54
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,609
I'll come check in on you again in a little bit.

55
00:04:38,609 --> 00:04:40,343
OK.

56
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:45,160
I wonder if he'll be okay.

57
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:49,199
I'll let you know if anything happens.

58
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,933
See you.

59
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,660
See you.

60
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:59,660
"See you"? That's all you have to say after I came here worried about you?

61
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:03,710
I'm sure he'll be okay after some sleep.

62
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,189
Your date is tomorrow, right?

63
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:09,450
You probably have to get ready, so hurry home.

64
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,970
Thanks, you're a huge help.

65
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,153

00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,250
Sorry.

This is where I live, right?

71
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:20,770
I can't live with you anymore.

72

Ritsu, do you have a key?

I can't raise my arm well.

106
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,059
Cool off your arm with this.

107
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:49,340
OK, thanks.

00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:59,150
Does your head hurt?

109
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,313
No.

00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:12,310
Why are you being so nice to me

112
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:21,789
I mean, you're hurt.

113
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:24,310
I can at least dry your hair.

114
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:28,840
Are you mad?

115
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:33,300
No, I'm not mad.

116
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,233

Am I sleeping here with you?

119
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:07,940
Just get some rest for today,

120
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:12,030
and we'll talk again tomorrow.

121
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,200
I'll sleep on the sofa.

But it looks so good.

129
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:58,840
Go wait at the table.

Let's eat.

00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:57,380
Wow, it's better than it looks.

136
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:59,869
Is that a compliment?

137
00:13:59,869 --> 00:14:01,703
Yes.

138
00:14:01,703 --> 00:14:04,090
Thank you, then.

139
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:11,530
Actually, it's been a while since you've said anything about my cooking.

140
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:16,450
I'll say more from now on, then.

141
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:24,190
But before that...

142
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:31,250
let's go out, and talk over coffee after we finish eating.

143
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:34,630
Yes, sure.

144
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:55,560
Why are you wearing my sweater?

145
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:59,240
What?

146
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:10,470
It surprisingly looks good on you.

147
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,310
It's fine, you can borrow it.

148
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:17,860

- Oh, new flowers.
- You noticed?

151
00:15:37,419 --> 00:15:39,809
Yes, they're so pretty.

152
00:15:39,809 --> 00:15:43,559
I fell in love with them at the flower shop yesterday.

153
00:15:45,249 --> 00:15:49,830
Oh right, Ritsu,

154
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:57,209
here's my latest work.

155

I tried changing it using your advice from before.

156
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,979
How is it?

157
00:16:02,979 --> 00:16:06,540
Oh, this hat is cute.

158
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,629
What? It looks great on you, Ritsu.

159
00:16:11,629 --> 00:16:13,879
Yes, it does.

160
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:17,179
But she's selling it. You shouldn't put it on.

161
00:16:17,179 --> 00:16:19,899
Tomoko was only asking for your opinion.

162
00:16:19,899 --> 00:16:24,039
No, it's fine, you can have it as a present.

163
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,439
Oh no, is it really okay?

164
00:16:26,439 --> 00:16:28,129
Yes, it's fine.

165
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:30,849

What are you drawing?

168

I'm drawing fruit.

169
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,510
It looks delicious.

170

That's a nice drawing.

171
00:16:55,119 --> 00:16:56,349
Can I borrow that?

172
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:57,839
Sure.

173
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:59,520

00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:19,899
Can you draw a pig next?

178
00:17:19,899 --> 00:17:21,109
A cat, too!

179
00:17:21,109 --> 00:17:24,720
Ritsu, looks like you're feeling better, huh?

180
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:40,840
Thank you for waiting.

181
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:45,699
Welcome.

182
00:17:45,699 --> 00:17:47,536
Hello.

183
00:17:47,536 --> 00:17:49,346
Oh, Ritsu.

184
00:17:49,346 --> 00:17:52,399
I saw your drawing in that magazine the other day.

185
00:17:52,399 --> 00:17:53,719
Magazine?

186
00:17:53,719 --> 00:17:57,360
You know... Oh, hold on.

187
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,313
Here.

188
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:11,429
You had trouble coming up with a design,

189
00:18:11,429 --> 00:18:13,799
but it turned out really nice, huh?

190
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:17,219
Oh, thank you.

191
00:18:18,149 --> 00:18:21,119
This color palette looks really cool.

192
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:25,160
Oh, so this is what you were drawing last month.

193
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:29,509
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

194
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:31,700
Take a seat.

195
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:42,739
Do you like my drawings?

196
00:18:42,739 --> 00:18:46,460
Yes, I do, but...

197
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:49,120
Then I'll try harder at it.

198
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,723
Sure.

199
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:58,040
By the way, Ritsu...

200
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:05,299
I wanted to talk to you again about what happened on your birthday.

201
00:19:05,299 --> 00:19:07,280
My birthday?

202
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:14,340
Yes, our talk got cut short because you left so suddenly.

203
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:21,090
What?

204
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:33,589
It's rare of you to draw me so seriously.

205
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:36,039
Why's that?

206
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,080
"Why"?

207
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,749
I mean, you have such a nice face.

208
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,177
Here's your water.

209
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,395
Tell me when you're ready to order.

210
00:19:58,395 --> 00:20:00,436
Thank you.

211
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,933
The usual, right?

212
00:20:05,933 --> 00:20:07,679
The usual?

213
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,159
Yes, you know, your usual.

214
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:14,839
- Coffee and pancakes.
- Coffee and pancakes?

215
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:19,600
Yes. What? You always order that when you come here.

216
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,220
Ritsu...

217
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:39,360
Could it be that you...

218
00:20:42,926 --> 00:20:46,781
Wait, hold on, first off,

219
00:20:47,473 --> 00:20:50,623
do you remember your name?

220
00:20:50,623 --> 00:20:52,779
Yes, Okusawa Ritsu.

221
00:20:52,779 --> 00:20:55,580
OK, and your family?

222
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:59,399
I have a mother, a father, and a younger brother.

223
00:20:59,399 --> 00:21:03,009
Yes, and where did you graduate from?

224
00:21:03,009 --> 00:21:07,039
Um... Koganei Art University.

225
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:08,379
Yes.

226
00:21:08,379 --> 00:21:11,500
Oh, what's the name of this cafe?

227
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,180
Oh, um...

228
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:49,630
The cafe's name. Your usual order.

229
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:52,130
Our neighbour's name.

230
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:04,480
Wait, aren't all these things related to me?

231
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,490
Ritsu,

232
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,600
do you remember me?

233
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:29,110
When you came for me at the hospital,

234
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,459
you said you were my roommate,

235
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:36,920
so I thought I'd remember you eventually.

236
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:44,260
But I'm sorry, I don't.

237
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:11,380
♫ I never knew being alone at night could be this long ♫

238
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:18,100
♫ Because I continue to think of you ♫

239
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:20,110
♫ Do you love me? ♫

240
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:28,070
♫ I love you so much it hurts my chest ♫

241
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:31,540
♫ I'll take your hand, and understand ♫

242
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:33,440
♫ Really love you ♫

243
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,750
♫ As long as you’re beside me, it’s enough ♫

244
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:41,420
♫ A moment longer than eternity ♫

245
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:45,350
♫ I love you just the way you are ♫

246
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:49,199
[Preview]
I don't think it's fair for you to know while Ritsu doesn't.

247
00:23:49,199 --> 00:23:53,839
Sometimes, I feel like it'd be nice to start over from scratch.

248
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:56,689
I want to take a walk in places from my past.

249
00:23:56,690 --> 00:23:59,970
I might find some kind of clue.
