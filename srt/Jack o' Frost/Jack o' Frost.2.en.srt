00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:06,569
Fumiya.

2
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:08,010
Yes?

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:10,460
Do you want me to cook breakfast?

4
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:13,123
Huh?

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,430
Cooking breakfast is my thing.

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,979
I'm not lying.

7
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:24,359
You sure are confident.

8
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,959
Do you think I can't do it?

9
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:32,879
No, I just remembered you said the same thing when we moved in together.

10
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,219
I did?

11
00:00:34,219 --> 00:00:35,859
Yes.

12
00:00:35,859 --> 00:00:40,590
Actually, you always cooked breakfast, Ritsu.

13
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:44,330
See? I told you I'm good at it.

14
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:47,500
Then I'll leave this to you.

15
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,270
Okay.

16
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:53,139
Hey, did you add anything?

17
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:55,709
No, just eggs so far.

18
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:57,500
Got it.

19
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,390
All right, great.

20
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:05,240

[Episode 2]

35
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:50,940
I think he's got a brain abscess.

36
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:55,499
Will his memories ever come back?

37
00:01:55,499 --> 00:01:58,989
Sometimes they do come back, sometimes they never do.

38
00:01:58,989 --> 00:02:01,109
I can't say for certain.

39
00:02:01,109 --> 00:02:04,900
It depends on the cause, and the brain condition too.

40
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:07,170
Just in case, I'll do a second test,

41
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:10,690
so could you two please step out?

42
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:13,100
Okay.

43
00:02:22,789 --> 00:02:26,359
- Here.
- Oh, thanks.

44
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:39,800
Actually,

45
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:44,750
we broke up.

46
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:50,300
Wait, what?

47
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,250
Sorry I didn't tell you.

48
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,900
When did it happen?

49
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:02,090
Before the accident.

50
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,779
It makes sense.

51
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:09,840
After all, Ritsu doesn't remember you at all.

52
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:21,290
But you're going to tell him, right?

53
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:24,580
Well...

54
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,769
I'm thinking about keeping it a secret.

55
00:03:29,769 --> 00:03:31,260
What?

56
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:34,080
Why?

57
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,840
I was thinking we could start again from scratch.

58
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:46,089
Do you really think you can reset this like a game?

59
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:50,829
Say what you want, but I've actually been reset in his mind.

60
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:03,060
Well, I won't say you have to tell him directly.

61
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:11,540
But... I don't think it's fair for you to know while Ritsu doesn't.

62
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,620
I know.

63
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:24,220
But the way we are now, things are going just as well as when we first met.

64
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:32,270
Well, I got the feeling that was the case.

65
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:54,690
Ritsu, come eat your soba while it's still warm.

66
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:58,689
I'm on a roll right now, so I'll eat later.

67
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:04,520
Then I'll eat first.

68
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,690
You scared me.

69
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:30,659
Weren't you focusing on your drawing?

70
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:31,699
Yes.

71
00:07:31,699 --> 00:07:33,850
It's fine if you eat later.

72
00:07:34,569 --> 00:07:39,100
Yes, but food tastes better when we eat it together.

73
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,740
Okay, then.

74
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:49,009
- Let's eat.
- Let's eat.

75
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:04,590
This taste...

76
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:09,260
Have you made this for me before?

77
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,469
Um... I'm not sure.

78
00:08:15,469 --> 00:08:18,240
No, you definitely made it for me.

79
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:27,500
Yes, now I know.

80
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:32,799
Fumiya, you're the type to make a curry from scratch, right?

81
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,769
Yes, even though I'm a novice.

82
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:38,780
I mean, this is way better than what a novice would make.

83
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:41,040
It's really good.

84
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:54,210
Hey, what kind of relationship did we have?

85
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:05,899
When we first met, neither of us had much money.

86
00:09:05,899 --> 00:09:09,999
But after talking for a while, we got along,

87
00:09:09,999 --> 00:09:15,219
so we decided it'd be cheaper if we lived together.

88
00:09:15,219 --> 00:09:18,500
And, well...

89
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,640
That's all?

90
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:26,220
Well, we got along well though.

91
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:29,230
Is that so?

92
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:37,250
I don't think it's fair for you to know while Ritsu doesn't.

93
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,059
I didn't know things were that bad.

94
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:03,619
Yes.

95
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:08,829
That's fine, isn't it?

96
00:10:08,829 --> 00:10:11,979
- Huh?
- I mean, Ritsu is healthy, right?

97
00:10:11,979 --> 00:10:15,830
Yes, that was a relief, but...

98
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:22,260
So, I know this is coming out of nowhere, but...

99
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:23,719
Yes?

100
00:10:23,719 --> 00:10:27,359
Things aren't going well with my boyfriend.

101
00:10:27,359 --> 00:10:28,790
Huh?

102
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:32,440
Oh, right.

103
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:36,209
What I wanted to say is, sometimes,

104
00:10:36,209 --> 00:10:40,630
I feel it would be nice to start over from scratch.

105
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:46,589
To be honest, things weren't going well between us either.

106
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:52,699
I think I could hear you two arguing sometimes.

107
00:10:52,699 --> 00:10:54,840
- Oh, sorry.
- It's fine.

108
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:59,990
So, like I was saying, you just need to avoid making the same mistakes again.

109
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:06,150
You're the type to keep things in until you explode, right?

110
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:11,459
So, this time around, why don't you try saying how you feel?

111
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:16,100
I'm not good at finding the right words.

112
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:21,150
When something bothers you, say it right away.

113
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:27,119
If Ritsu becomes unappreciative of you, speak out and tell him.

114
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:28,729
How's that?

115
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:34,156
I'll try.

116
00:11:34,157 --> 00:11:35,690
Great.

117
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:45,689
I wonder how I can get my old touch back.

118
00:11:45,689 --> 00:11:50,690
Maybe practice is the only way.

119
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:54,180
Yes, you're right.

120
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:21,219
It still feels different from my old pieces.

121
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:25,979
That might be true, but I like this.

122
00:12:26,933 --> 00:12:28,058
Really?

123
00:12:28,059 --> 00:12:29,492
Yes.

124
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:36,750
I actually thought that too.

125
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,893
Nice.

126
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:47,829
It's thanks to you, Fumiya. I appreciate it.

127
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:50,580
No, I didn't do anything.

128
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:56,719
Oh, by the way, I want to go to places from my past.

129
00:12:56,719 --> 00:12:59,510
I might find some kind of clue there.

130
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:02,930
Can you show me around?

131
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,680
Sure, let's go.

132
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:15,300
Okay. All right.

133
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,109
What about this laundromat?

134
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:25,690
I don't think we've used it yet.

135
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:27,479
I see.

136
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:38,139
That old man...

137
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:41,260
What about that old man?

138
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:44,499
I got kind of worried after seeing him.

139
00:13:44,499 --> 00:13:46,549
I seem to remember him.

140
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:48,460
Huh?

141
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,039
I might remember if we talk.

142
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,640
Wait!

143
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,990
He'll get startled if you call out to him suddenly.

144
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,300
That's true.

145
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:13,039
Can we go to the cafe, next?

146
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,609
Sure.

147
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:16,220
That way.

148
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:29,560
Welcome.

149
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:36,820
Hey, where did I always sit?

150
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:41,900
Oh, you were...

151
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,790
Welcome.

152
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,939
Hello, here is the menu.

153
00:15:03,939 --> 00:15:06,120
Thank you.

154
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:45,590
Is this me?

155
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:50,260
Well, um...

156
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,280
You're good.

157
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:02,859
An illustrator?

158
00:16:02,859 --> 00:16:05,530
I don't think I've ever met one.

159
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:10,599
It's not enough to live on yet,

160
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,529
so I also have a part-time job.

161
00:16:12,529 --> 00:16:14,859
But you get money from drawing, right?

162
00:16:14,859 --> 00:16:17,200
Then illustrating is a job.

163
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:21,090
Well, I guess.

164
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,919
I don't know much about drawing, but I really like this.

165
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:40,080
I thought you looked cool, so I drew you without realizing it.

166
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,380
What?

167
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:50,049
You looked like a proper working man who'd leave right after his coffee.

168
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:56,000
That's how I looked?

169
00:16:57,310 --> 00:17:00,389
I'm a salary man, then?

170
00:17:00,389 --> 00:17:04,029
But once you're famous, I'll be no match for you.

171
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,200
I guess.

172
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,170
So you agree.

173
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,380
That's mean.

174
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:24,259
Oh, I don't remember.

175
00:17:24,259 --> 00:17:25,929
You forgot?

176
00:17:25,929 --> 00:17:30,069
Yes, I don't remember where people sit.

177
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:32,780
Oh, that's true.

178
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:43,639
But this peace of mind must mean I come here often.

179
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:54,460
Excuse me, here is your coffee.

180
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,130
Thank you.

181
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:15,910
This classical music and the coffee bean aroma...

182
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:23,050
And I vaguely remember that weird art piece.

183
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:35,510
What is it?

184
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:39,639
I thought maybe my memory would come back

185
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:43,159
if I kept watching you from here.

186
00:18:43,159 --> 00:18:47,370
Watching? Feel free.

187
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:23,899
Fumiya.

188
00:19:23,899 --> 00:19:25,433
Yes?

189
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,800
I want to remember you more.

190
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:31,250
Huh?

191
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:38,739
I feel like my memories with you must have been really great.

192
00:19:38,739 --> 00:19:41,169
I want to get them back.

193
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:47,109
Oh, but they weren't that special.

194
00:19:47,109 --> 00:19:49,709
I still want to remember.

195
00:19:49,709 --> 00:19:55,249
Well, but I'm glad you forgot only me.

196
00:19:55,249 --> 00:19:57,830
What if you had forgotten your work?

197
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00,249
You're glad?

198
00:20:00,249 --> 00:20:02,610
Well, not glad, but...

199
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:08,559
Sorry, it might be work. May I answer it?

200
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:10,610
Sure, of course.

201
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,300
Hello?

202
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:20,830
Yes. Okay.

203
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:24,099
A lodging booking?

204
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,733
Yes.

205
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:29,060
I see.

206
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:31,600
Okay, I understand.

207
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:35,280
Next week, right?

208
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:37,269
Yes.

209
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:40,000
Okay, goodbye.

210
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:53,163
What was it?

211
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:58,589
Well, it seems I was planning on renting a holiday house.

212
00:20:58,589 --> 00:21:00,590
A holiday house?

213
00:21:01,966 --> 00:21:05,070
Did I say I was renting one?

214
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:06,603
No...

215
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:09,270
Right?

216
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:15,690
Hm... Oh, I got a message, too.

217
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:21,800
It looks pretty nice. See?

218
00:21:22,582 --> 00:21:25,996
[Drink and relax as if you were at home.]

219
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:50,640
I already paid for it though.

220
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:59,130
Hey.

221
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:02,050
What?

222
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:08,699
If it's OK with you, do you want to go with me?

223
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:15,700
What do you think?

224
00:22:22,899 --> 00:22:24,819
You don't have to force yourself.

225
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:26,819
I'm sure you have a lot of plans too.

226
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,390
I'll go.

227
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:32,519
Huh? Really?

228
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:37,199
Yes, I'm still worried about your condition,

229
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,399
and if you go somewhere alone, you might get into trouble.

230
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,020
Besides, you'll get lonely if you go on your own.

231
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:48,330
You're the best, Fumiya.

232
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:52,580
I'm super excited.

233
00:22:57,928 --> 00:23:00,041
What should I wear?

234
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:11,360
♫ I never knew being alone at night could be this long ♫

235
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:18,200
♫ Because I continue to think of you ♫

236
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,110
♫ Do you love me? ♫

237
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:28,100
♫ I love you so much it hurts my chest ♫

238
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:31,490
♫ I'll take your hand, and understand ♫

239
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:33,370
♫ Really love you ♫

240
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:36,710
♫ As long as you’re beside me, it’s enough ♫

241
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:41,390
♫ A moment longer than eternity ♫

242
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:45,050
♫ I love you just the way you are ♫

243
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:46,039
[Preview]

244
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,839
You seem popular, Fumiya.

245
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:50,889
I'm not nice to just anyone, you know.

246
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:52,585
I see.

247
00:23:52,586 --> 00:23:55,102
Sorry, I can't hold back.

248
00:23:55,103 --> 00:23:56,706
You don't have to.

249
00:23:56,707 --> 00:23:58,124
You're so riled up.

250
00:23:58,124 --> 00:24:00,022
I'm not riled up.
