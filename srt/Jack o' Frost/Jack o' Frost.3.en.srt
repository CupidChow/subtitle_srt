00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,979
Look. Do you like my jacket?

2
00:00:04,979 --> 00:00:06,749
Yes.

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:08,460
I bought it yesterday.

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,499
Oh, it's nice. It looks warm.

5
00:00:10,499 --> 00:00:13,159
Yes, it's perfect for the cold.

6
00:00:13,159 --> 00:00:15,680
Look forward while walking.

7
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,640
Okay.

8
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,180
Man, the air tastes great.

9
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,259
You've said that seven times today.

10
00:00:26,259 --> 00:00:28,609
Does it matter how many times I say it?

11
00:00:28,609 --> 00:00:30,243
I guess not.

12
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:33,830
The air tastes great.

13
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:35,389
It's not that different.

14
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:37,920
- It is.
- It isn't.

[Episode 3]
Oh, this is the place.

29
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:27,919
Here?

30
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,720
Yes, it's here.

31
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,939
I've been here before, right?

32
00:01:33,939 --> 00:01:35,473
Yes.

33
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:39,850
I can't remember anything.

34
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:42,480
Well, don't force it.

35
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,399
But still...

36
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,630
It's fine, I don't remember it much either.

37
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:50,410
Wait, that's pretty bad, isn't it?

38
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:53,439
Is it bad?

39
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:57,199
I don't know. It's cold, let's head in.

40
00:01:57,199 --> 00:01:58,750
Sure.

41
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,569
How is it?

42
00:02:08,569 --> 00:02:10,039
What a nice place.

43
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:12,900
You're the one who booked it, Ritsu.

44
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,709
I don't remember though.

45
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:17,129
It doesn't matter.

46
00:02:17,129 --> 00:02:20,190
Thanks, Ritsu.

47
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,929
Oh, there's a kitchen too. You could live here.

48
00:02:27,929 --> 00:02:31,310
We cooked when you and I came here the last time.

49
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:33,660
What did we make again?

50
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:39,170
"You and I"? Was it just the two of us?

51
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:42,859
Oh, well, um...

52
00:02:42,859 --> 00:02:47,150
You're right, but...

53
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:50,010
We were close, huh?

54
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:56,330
Well, we're close enough to share a house.

55
00:03:02,939 --> 00:03:08,270
What? There's a sauna too!

56
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:09,689
Ritsu?

57
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:11,590
Want some coffee?

58
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:14,040
Yes, I'll have some!

59
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:30,559
Coffee's ready.

60
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,419
Oh, thanks.

61
00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:35,619
- Here.
- Thanks.

62
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,789
Does this work too?

63
00:03:38,789 --> 00:03:40,799
Yes, it does.

64
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,900
Oh, did we use it before?

65
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:47,340
Well, last time we came...

66
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:53,219
Hey, Fumiya, there's a campfire set.

67
00:03:53,219 --> 00:03:55,489
What? You want a campfire?

68
00:03:55,489 --> 00:03:56,809
Yes.

69
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:58,429
Then let's have a campfire tonight.

70
00:03:58,429 --> 00:04:01,089
- Wait, can we?
- Yes.

71
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:05,080
Oh, sorry.

72
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:17,299
It was summer last time, so we didn't use it.

73
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:21,699
So it's your first time using it too.

74
00:04:21,699 --> 00:04:24,500
Well, I guess so.

75
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:28,389
Before that, how about a walk?

76
00:04:28,389 --> 00:04:31,140
But we can't go too far without a car.

77
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:33,190
Yes, let's go.

78
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,723
Okay.

79
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:42,289
It's so pretty.

80
00:04:42,289 --> 00:04:48,430
Right? When we came here last time, you were sad there weren't any swans.

81
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,820
Really?

82
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:56,080
And it rained too, so we couldn't go out.

83
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,620
We had fun though.

84
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,330
I'm sorry.

85
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,633
What?

86
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:12,560
I feel like I'm causing you trouble.

87
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:16,219
Ritsu.

88
00:05:16,219 --> 00:05:19,730
You came with me to a lot of other places earlier too.

89
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,250
And now we're here.

90
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:35,120
Ritsu, I'm having a good time right now.

91
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,813
What?

92
00:05:37,813 --> 00:05:39,760
It's a lot of fun.

93
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,299
What? Why are you laughing?

94
00:05:47,299 --> 00:05:52,580
It's just weird you said you're having fun with such a serious face.

95
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:55,030
I was trying to cheer you up.

96
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:58,983
You seem like you would be popular.

97
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:01,779
What? Do you think so?

98
00:06:03,933 --> 00:06:08,713
You're so nice. People might easily misunderstand.

99
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:17,490
It's not like I'm nice to just anybody though.

100
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,160
Oh, really?

101
00:06:23,973 --> 00:06:25,406
Yes.

102
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:33,419
Are you sure you want to go back now?

103
00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:36,220
Yes, I saw the swans.

104
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:42,511
We could look around more and have dinner somewhere.

105
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:51,449
I want to eat your cooking.

106
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:52,883
What?

107
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:58,440
Oh, only if you're fine with it.

108
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:03,793
Is that a no?

109
00:07:06,553 --> 00:07:10,133
Then let's buy some groceries.

110
00:07:11,643 --> 00:07:13,076
Okay.

111
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,521
Here you go.

112
00:07:32,521 --> 00:07:35,372
Thanks.

113
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:39,530
I thought you were drawing me again.

114
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:41,549
No, I'm not.

115
00:07:41,549 --> 00:07:43,659
What's this?

116
00:07:43,659 --> 00:07:46,879
Jack o' Frost. An elf.

117
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,819
He looks mischievous.

118
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:53,120
Because he's a prankster.

119
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:57,819
Hey.

120
00:07:57,819 --> 00:07:59,779
Look over here.

121
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:29,779
I was just curious about what you were drawing.

122
00:08:29,779 --> 00:08:33,980
What? Oh, it's Jack o' Frost.

123
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,480
I see.

124
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,980
Do you know him?

125
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,360
No, I don't.

126
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:47,440
He's a snow elf who loves to play pranks.

127
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,790
He disappears when spring comes.

128
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:53,470
Oh, I see.

129
00:08:58,359 --> 00:09:01,239
- Let's eat.
- Let's eat.

130
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:07,040
I'll start with the roast beef.

131
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:18,468
This is so good.

132
00:09:18,468 --> 00:09:20,690
Are you some kind of genius, Fumiya?

133
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:24,370
Don't exaggerate. Maybe I am.

134
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:38,393
What?

135
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:41,369
I want to drink that too.

136
00:09:41,369 --> 00:09:43,059
But you're not good with alcohol.

137
00:09:43,059 --> 00:09:45,589
- I can have one glass.
- Well, but...

138
00:09:45,589 --> 00:09:49,060
Shouldn't I?

139
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:54,650
It's not that you can't, but...

140
00:10:01,493 --> 00:10:02,963
Here.

141
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:16,390
That smells nice.

142
00:10:24,263 --> 00:10:26,369
This is good.

143
00:10:26,369 --> 00:10:28,060
Yes.

144
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:33,729
I feel like an adult.

145
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:36,700
- An adult?
- Yes, an adult.

146
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,649
Huh?

147
00:10:57,649 --> 00:10:59,330
Drink this.

148
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:03,019
Oh, thanks.

149
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:15,379
Do you feel okay?

150
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:17,200
Yes.

151
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,579
And your head?

152
00:11:18,579 --> 00:11:20,530
It's fine.

153
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:22,793
Good.

154
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:28,590
Wait, did I...

155
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:30,880
You drank, and fell asleep.

156
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:35,950
Sorry, I got carried away.

157
00:11:36,556 --> 00:11:38,839
Don't be so upset.

158
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:42,080
But we came all this way.

159
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:45,950
Does your body feel okay?

160
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,093
Yes.

161
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:52,510
Then come with me.

162
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:54,533
What?

163
00:11:54,533 --> 00:11:56,899
Over there.

164
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:10,280
I thought a campfire would be nice since it's cold.

165
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:15,999
- It's so warm.
- And I prepared these too.

166
00:12:21,526 --> 00:12:23,120
Wow.

167
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,553
Here.

168
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:28,889
How did you know what I want?

169
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:30,779
Of course I'd know.

170
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:33,860
You know, since we're roommates.

171
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,530
Roommates.

172
00:12:37,402 --> 00:12:41,480
Right, of course.

173
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:03,479
Did you want a campfire that badly?

174
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,379
I mean, we came all this way.

175
00:13:05,379 --> 00:13:07,769
We can just come again.

176
00:13:07,769 --> 00:13:10,400
You'll come with me again?

177
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:15,549
Well, if we win the shopping center lottery again.

178
00:13:15,549 --> 00:13:17,009
What?

179
00:13:17,009 --> 00:13:20,459
You might not know it, but this place is pretty expensive.

180
00:13:20,459 --> 00:13:22,170
But...

181
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:26,060
Okay, fine, let's come again.

182
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:30,399
Okay, that's a promise.

183
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:33,240
Yes, I promise.

184
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,779
I'll do it too.

185
00:13:52,779 --> 00:13:57,249
Okay. Hey, Fumiya, the marshmallows are rock-solid.

186
00:13:57,249 --> 00:13:59,799
No way.

187
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:00,989
Ouch.

188
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:03,699
- Look, I got it through.
- Me too.

189
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,779
Isn't it burning?

190
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:10,550
It's fine.

191
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:13,159
So cold.

192
00:14:13,159 --> 00:14:15,289
Even with the fire, it was really cold.

193
00:14:15,289 --> 00:14:16,339
Yes.

194
00:14:16,339 --> 00:14:18,399
The bath is ready, so you go first.

195
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,669
Let's go in together.

196
00:14:20,669 --> 00:14:22,279
Huh?

197
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:24,579
You're cold too, right, Fumiya?

198
00:14:24,579 --> 00:14:26,400
What? But...

199
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:31,179
See? Your hand is so cold.

200
00:14:31,179 --> 00:14:35,620
No, but... Isn't that a bit...

201
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:39,070
Oh, sorry.

202
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:46,329
You wouldn't want to take a bath with me, right?

203
00:14:46,329 --> 00:14:48,299
No, it's not that, but...

204
00:14:48,299 --> 00:14:50,419
Sorry, forget I said that.

205
00:14:50,419 --> 00:14:53,449
- No, it's not...
- Really, forget it.

206
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:56,659
Okay.

207
00:14:56,659 --> 00:14:58,840
I'll go take a bath.

208
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:01,363
Sure.

209
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:35,690
Are you awake?

210
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,970
Yes, I am.

211
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:43,790
It was fun, huh?

212
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:49,090
Yes, even without the campfire.

213
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,900
It's a promise.

214
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:55,750
Yes, I promise.

215
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,200
What's wrong?

216
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:17,060
I'm pretty nervous right now.

217
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,880
What? Why?

218
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:29,680
I feel like we're going to do it.

219
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:35,960
I'm getting my hopes up, and my heart's racing.

220
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:23,440
Does that mean you like me, Ritsu?

221
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:29,410
I wouldn't have come here if I didn't.

222
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:53,779
Sorry, I can't hold back.

223
00:17:53,779 --> 00:17:56,380
You don't have to.

224
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,019
You're too riled up.

225
00:18:04,019 --> 00:18:08,390
I'm not riled up. You should undress too.

226
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,710
Can I?

227
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,400
Yes.

228
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,110
Is that okay?

229
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:33,910
I'm so happy.

230
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,729
Hey, wear some clothes.

231
00:19:13,729 --> 00:19:16,349
My body's cooling down.

232
00:19:16,349 --> 00:19:19,579
Wear something or you'll catch a cold.

233
00:19:19,579 --> 00:19:22,239
I forgot to bring pajamas.

234
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,399
Oh, wear the nightgown that's upstairs.

235
00:19:25,399 --> 00:19:27,360
Okay.

236
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,799
Where is it? Over there?

237
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:34,400
Yes.

238
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:40,069
Oh, there's only one bed, but don't worry.

239
00:19:40,069 --> 00:19:42,110
I'll sleep on the sofa.

240
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,860
Let's sleep together.

241
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,693
Huh?

242
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:55,749
If you sleep on the sofa, you'll be the one to catch a cold.

243
00:19:55,749 --> 00:19:59,070
You're the one with just a towel on.

244
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:05,399
And I wouldn't mind sleeping together.

245
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:11,739
Oh, it's fine if you don't want to.

246
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:51,050
Are you awake?

247
00:21:12,816 --> 00:21:15,066
I'm awake.

248
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:49,909
Hey, I like this cup.

249
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:51,729
Okay, this one's yours.

250
00:21:51,729 --> 00:21:53,263
Yes.

251
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:02,979
What is it?

252
00:22:02,979 --> 00:22:08,640
I'm getting all embarrassed thinking about what happened earlier.

253
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:11,840
Am I in the way?

254
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,659
No, you're not.

255
00:22:14,659 --> 00:22:17,820
But watch out when the water starts boiling.

256
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:20,840
Can I stay like this for now?

257
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:33,400
Isn't this way better?

258
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:42,579
So embarrassing.

259
00:22:42,579 --> 00:22:44,240
Why?

260
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:11,420
♫ I never knew being alone at night could be this long ♫

261
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:18,220
♫ Because I continue to think of you ♫

[Preview]

270
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:48,720
You look good in that suit jacket, Fumiya.

271
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,068
- Does it bother you?
- Ex-boyfriends.

272
00:23:51,068 --> 00:23:53,116
I'm Kajiya from Kadoyama Publishing.

273
00:23:53,117 --> 00:23:55,309
I've worked with Ritsu for a long time.

274
00:23:55,310 --> 00:24:00,067
Why would you invite him here to work?
