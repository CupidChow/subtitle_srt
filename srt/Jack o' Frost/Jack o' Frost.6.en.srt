We will deliver your items at 6 p.m.,

2
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:14,029
so please be at your new home by then.

3
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:16,110
Yes, thank you very much.

4
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:18,660
Goodbye.

5
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:27,350
That was quick.

6
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,839
We still have time until 6.

7
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,210
Do you want to get some tea before then?

8
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:44,869
No, I want to walk around here one last time.

9
00:00:44,869 --> 00:00:46,499
Oh, right.

10
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,149
I'll come with you.

11
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:51,220
What a relief. You're still here.

12
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:58,600
You forgot this.

13
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:10,430
Well, then...

14
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:13,300
Take care.

15
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:34,920
Shall we go?

16
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:39,519
Sorry.

17
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,010
I want to be alone.

18
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:45,063

[Episode 6]

33
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,019
Tomoko, sorry.

34
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:24,320
I must have been too loud.

35
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:30,400
Are you okay with letting him go?

36
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:39,619
Ritsu was thinking about how to save your relationship too

37
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:42,000
before he lost his memories.

38
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:43,943
What?

39
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,920
Ritsu?

40
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,890
Are you okay?

41
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,310
Did you fight with Fumiya?

42
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,593
No.

43
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:22,970
It's just...

44
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,790
It might be over for us.

45
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:37,490
If we are going to break up,

46
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,500
it would be easier if I could just forget everything.

47
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,980
If we'll just end up hurting each other,

48
00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:01,910
I'd rather forget about Fumiya.

49
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,940
Do you really feel that way?

50
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,370
I don't know.

51
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:25,800
You two love each other,

52
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,990
so it'll be fine.

53
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:31,103
Okay?

54
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:35,150
Thanks.

55
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,140
Ritsu...

56
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:43,940
Shuji, weren't you with Ritsu?

57
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,399
Fumiya.

58
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:49,860
Ritsu wanted to walk around here for one last time.

59
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,790
You can still catch him.

60
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:03,680
Thanks.

61
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,549
Thank you.

62
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:45,670
- I found you, Dad.
- Yes, thanks.

63
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:13,559
Excuse me, did a light-skinned man in a white jacket come by this way?

64
00:07:13,559 --> 00:07:17,980
I don't really remember.

65
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,329
Welcome.

66
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:47,919
The usual?

67
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,939
Yes.

68
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,670
I'll be right back.

69
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:08,510
Frost?

70
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:42,360
What a pretty ocean.

71
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,190
Oh, not at all.

72
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:47,899
I drew it when I had just started college.

73
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,810
Oh, really?

74
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,599
What's on the next page?

75
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,880
I'll show you after I've eaten my pancake.

76
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,510
Sure.

77
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,420
Time to eat.

78
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,930
Thank you for the food.

79
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:44,729
- Here it goes.
- Here.
- Here

80
00:10:44,729 --> 00:10:46,499
- Here.
- Here!

81
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,939
- Hey!
- Here it goes!

82
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:50,630
Come on, stupid!

83
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:53,739
Oh, I'm sorry.

84
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:55,273
I'm sorry.

85
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,380
Thank you.

86
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:03,880
Sorry.

87
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:08,629
- We're leaving.
- Hold on a second.

88
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:10,669
Are you okay?

89
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,439
Sorry, thank you.

90
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,073
I apologize.

91
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:19,230
Thank you.

92
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:21,019
Wait!

93
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:22,770
You took so long.

94
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:28,380
Excuse me, sorry about earlier.

95
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:31,620
You're good at drawing.

96
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,539
No...

97
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:36,749
I don't know much about art,

98
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:39,880
but you can definitely become a pro.

99
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:50,310
Do you want to live with me then?

100
00:12:56,340 --> 00:13:02,130
Does that mean you like me, Ritsu?

101
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:08,550
Do you have an ex-boyfriend?

102
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:10,530
I...

103
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:15,930
won't tell you.

104
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,460
Is that me?

105
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:36,920
Well...

106
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:40,790
You're good.

107
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:44,750
That wasn't our first meeting.

108
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:48,050
It was a miraculous reunion.

109
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:52,089
I can't chase out a wounded person, can I?

110
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:54,489
Cool off your arm with this.

111
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:57,959
Ritsu, it looks like you're feeling better, huh?

112
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,680
Even though we had broken up,

113
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:03,449
he stayed by my side.

114
00:14:03,449 --> 00:14:08,450
I'm not nice to just anybody though.

115
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:34,363
Ritsu.

116
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:58,680
You might not forgive me no matter what I say now,

117
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:03,630
but our time together...

118
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:12,580
Laughing together...

119
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:16,100
Crying...

120
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,840
Fighting...

121
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:21,550
Even the unpleasant times...

122
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:24,170
The tough times...

123
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:26,270
And the best times...

124
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:32,750
I cherished them all.

125
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,880
I really messed up.

126
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:45,600
I'm sorry.

127
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,260
Fumiya.

128
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:57,310
Did you...

129
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,353
Yes.

130
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,080
I remember.

131
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:14,110
I remember now.

132
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:23,020
And that's not all.

133
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:30,040
I even remember what happened

134
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:33,020
before we met at this cafe.

135
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:36,153
What?

136
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:43,470
We had already met a long time ago.

137
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,340
Is this me?

138
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,433
Yes.

139
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,979
When you were in college,

140
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:17,060
you went to Shichirihama Beach, right?

141
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,573
Yes.

142
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:23,980
I think so.

143
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:31,000
The two of us met there.

144
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:36,060
There were other people too,

145
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:38,240
but to me...

146
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,340
you were all I saw.

147
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,919
You mean you were there, too?

148
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,520
The first time we met

149
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,940
wasn't at this cafe.

150
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:57,830
It was at the beach.

151
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:07,190
I knew, but I didn't tell you.

152
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:15,790
That day,

153
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:22,850
I was able to keep chasing my dream without giving up

154
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:26,220
because of your compliment.

155
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:39,260
I feel like I've loved you

156
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:43,630
for a long time.

157
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:47,160
But I was too afraid to tell you.

158
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:55,599
That's why I kept it a secret.

159
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,240
It wasn't just you.

160
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:04,550
I did the same too.

161
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,220
I see.

162
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:22,440
We do things pretty similarly, huh?

163
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:36,629
I'm sorry for forgetting something so important.

164
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:38,363
No,

165
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:42,530
thank you for remembering.

166
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:48,643
But...

167
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:53,600
Don't you want to forget things too?

168
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:57,940
No, I don't.

169
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:05,100
I will never forget again.

170
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:41,990
I'm hungry.

171
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:53,759
What should I make?

172
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,259
You did a skip just now.

173
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:59,669
- No, I didn't.
- I'm going to skip too.

174
00:20:59,669 --> 00:21:01,293
Me, too.

175
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:04,529
You suck at that. No way.

Hey, why are you slacking off?

183
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:43,060
What?

184
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:52,320
We're not done unpacking.

185
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:57,500
I mean, I feel so relaxed here.

186
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:03,379
But we'll restart soon, okay?

187
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:05,270
I know.

188
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:09,970
All right.

189
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:11,559
That was too short.

Come on, Ritsu, we'll never finish like this.

191
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,520
There's no rush.

192
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,639
All right.

193
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,580
Like I said...

194
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,210
Hey.

195
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:32,710
Yes?

196
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,840
I thought we were restarting soon.

197
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:40,863
Yes.

198
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:46,090
For you, I'll restart as many times as it takes.

199
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:49,720
Fumiya.

201
00:22:53,040 --> 00:23:00,690
♫ I have so many things I want to talk about ♫

202
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:04,570
♫ But I can’t find the words ♫

203
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:07,790
♫ I never knew ♫

204
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:11,080
♫ ­Not being able to see you ♫

205
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:17,450
♫ Could be this lonely ♫

206
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:19,870
♫ Do you love me? ♫

207
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:27,030
♫ I love you so much it hurts my chest ♫

208
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:31,290
♫ I'll take your hand, and understand ♫

209
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:33,140
♫ Really love you ♫

210
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:36,520
♫ As long as you’re beside me, it’s enough ♫

211
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:41,190
♫ A moment longer than eternity ♫

212
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:45,000
♫ I love you just the way you are ♫
