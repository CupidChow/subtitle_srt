00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:35,880

[Episode 5]

16
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,540
What is this?

17
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:16,409
Oh, I guess you two got along well.

18
00:02:16,409 --> 00:02:19,479
We were dating, weren't we?

19
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,090
Who can say?

20
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:29,420
I don't know how many more lies I can take.

21
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:39,540
Shuji.

22
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:47,070
You and Fumiya were a great couple together.

23
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:52,360
Sorry I stayed quiet.

24
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:03,870
Say something, Ritsu.

25
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:10,069
It wasn't your idea to keep quiet, right?

26
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:13,439
What? Well...

27
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:17,510
You're a bad liar, so stop.

28
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,590
Fumiya told me to stay quiet.

29
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:31,659
- I knew it.
- But he didn't mean any harm.

30
00:03:31,659 --> 00:03:33,879
He thought it would be better for you.

31
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:38,750
But do you know how I feel not being told something like that?

32
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,090
Well...

33
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,240
It must be hard on you.

34
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:59,010
I can't trust Fumiya anymore.

35
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,490
I can't go back.

36
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:05,973
What?

37
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,290
Wait, hold on.

38
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,400
- I'd like to pay.
- OK.

39
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,029
Oh, Shuji?

40
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:32,963
Fumiya.

41
00:04:32,963 --> 00:04:35,250
Ritsu found out.

42
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,553
What?

43
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,749
What did he find out?

44
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,399
He asked me to meet him.

45
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:47,829
When I saw how much he was struggling, I couldn't keep it a secret.

46
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,750
And how did he react?

47
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:54,279
He was pretty shocked.

48
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,909
Nothing I said got through to him.

49
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:58,880
I see.

50
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:03,759
Sorry for making you lie, Shuji.

51
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,130
If only I had stopped that back then.

52
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:12,039
Anyway, you should talk to him, Fumiya.

53
00:05:12,039 --> 00:05:17,010
Yes, got it. Bye.

54
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:05,620
It's not in your nature to ignore work.

55
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,900
Oh, Kajiya?

56
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:13,249
No way, it was today?

57
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:16,800
Hey, are you okay?

58
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,833
Sorry.

59
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:24,059
I'm useless.

60
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:27,879
Maybe you should take a longer break from work.

61
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,830
No, I'll go right away.

62
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:11,050
10 a.m. Kadoyama Publishing

63
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:21,950
Our company loved your illustrations this time.

64
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:24,619
We would love to keep working with you.

65
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:27,160
That's great.

66
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,750
Your illustrations are the best.

67
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:42,750
What? Why are you so glum?

68
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,800
Sorry.

69
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:51,159
Oh, right.

70
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:55,000
There's a restaurant I want to go to. I hope it's open.

71
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:07,169
All the good places are closed around here.

72
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:09,020
What should we eat?

73
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:23,740
Fumiya and I were dating, apparently.

74
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:39,310
When I met him,

75
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,140
I was positive he liked you.

76
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,160
What? Really?

77
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:50,203
Yes.

78
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:55,670
He gave me an intense glare.

79
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:57,640
You didn't see it?

80
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:09,410
When I met him at the hospital,

81
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:12,530
I felt uneasy since I didn't know him.

82
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:18,309
But after spending time with him,

83
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:23,290
he felt warm and familiar.

84
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:26,210
But I guess that's why.

85
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,610
I wonder why he didn't tell you you were dating.

86
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,080
I have no idea.

87
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:54,800
I also feel sorry for the things I did when we dated.

88
00:09:54,800 --> 00:10:00,493
But... I didn't keep any secrets like that from you.

89
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:05,460
You feel sorry about back then?

90
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:06,923
Yes.

91
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:13,089
I was completely unaware of my bad sides until you said something.

92
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:15,703
I see.

93
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:20,510
But the past is the past.

94
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:24,199
That's true.

95
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:29,179
Ritsu.

96
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:31,409
Fumiya.

97
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:33,550
How...

98
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:36,890
It was on your work schedule

99
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:39,210
and I had his business card.

100
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,130
You looked through my desk?

101
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,260
Sorry.

102
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:57,659
I know how you feel.

103
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:01,850
Ritsu doesn't listen when he gets like this.

104
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:06,540
Ritsu, can we talk alone?

105
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:12,080
I'll tell you everything, so can you hear me out?

106
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,493
No.

107
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:23,440
It will make Kajiya uncomfortable if we talk here.

108
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,190
Go back home.

109
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:34,590
I guess I interrupted something.

110
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:37,323
Sorry.

111
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,530
Oh, wait.

112
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:47,879
Don't be like that.

113
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:51,520
Fumiya must have had his reasons.

114
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:56,260
Go with him, and have a long talk, okay?

115
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:21,230
Why did you lie?

116
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:26,870
I'm sorry.

117
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:33,979
You hated me, so it was better if I just forgot?

118
00:12:33,979 --> 00:12:35,740
No, it's not like that.

119
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:37,473
Then why?

120
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,200
We...

121
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,300
broke up.

122
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:47,203
What?

123
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:49,679
No way.

124
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,270
But we were living together.

125
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,640
Yes.

126
00:12:56,010 --> 00:13:01,339
You got in that accident the day we broke up.

127
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,330
What?

128
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:14,280
Ritsu, happy birthday!

129
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:18,239
Fumiya.

130
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,899
- I did great, right?
- Yes, it's amazing.

131
00:13:20,899 --> 00:13:22,519
Congratulations.

132
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,359
Thanks.

133
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,749
Now we're the same age again.

134
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,210
Yes.

135
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:33,670
I'm so glad you came home right after work today.

136
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,829
Sorry about the other day.

137
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:40,769
It's work. I understand.

138
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:44,549
But if you hadn't come home today,

139
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:46,679
I might have frozen to death here.

140
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,899
Don't die on me like that.

141
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:52,309
But I've been so lonely lately.

142
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:53,779
Don't drink too much.

143
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:56,520
I know.

144
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,010
Wait, seriously?

145
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:13,699
- Ta-da!
- Thank you.

146
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,579
It's beautiful. Does it come from a popular store?

147
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:19,359
Four stars on the app.

148
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,749
Wow.

149
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:23,720
I ordered it a month in advance.

150
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,950
I'm impressed.

151
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,829
Wait, can we get a fork or a spoon?

152
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:33,610
Oh, a fork. Okay.

153
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:41,129
It's so good.

154
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,290
Hey, don't eat it like that.

155
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:47,100
So good.

156
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,489
- Here.
- Thanks.

157
00:14:51,489 --> 00:14:54,979
- Is it good?
- Yes, it's delicious.

158
00:14:54,979 --> 00:14:57,929
- Let's eat.
- Yes, let's eat.

159
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,970
This is good.

160
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,430
Hey, Ritsu.

161
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:18,610
What is it?

162
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:21,039
You have cream on your lip.

163
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,660
Oh, really?

164
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,479
Not there.

165
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,360
Where is it?

166
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,419
Take it off.

167
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:20,039
Undress.

168
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:26,210
Faster.

169
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:32,480
Hurry and warm me up.

170
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:04,939
Yes, any day after the 17th.

171
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:08,520
Yes, the 20th will work for me.

172
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:16,119
Okay, in the evening.

173
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:19,330
Yes, got it.

174
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:23,539
Okay, I'll contact you again closer to the date.

175
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:26,770
Goodbye then.

176
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:37,809
What's wrong?

177
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:39,240
You don't know?

178
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:43,379
You promised to eat out with me on the 20th.

179
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,399
What?

180
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,160
I already booked a table.

181
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,889
Oh, sorry, I forgot to write it in my schedule.

182
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:52,989
You keep doing that lately.

183
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:57,150
You know I'm making and canceling all the bookings, right?

184
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,389
I said sorry.

185
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:03,579
Work's been pretty busy lately.

186
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:07,909
And I'm starting to get tipsy now.

187
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:10,990
I said not to drink too much.

188
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:18,929
Sorry, Fumiya.

189
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:21,700
Don't make light of this.

190
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,320
Listen when I'm saying something serious.

191
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:37,269
It's my birthday, so don't be so hard on me.

192
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:43,729
You always upset me lately, Ritsu.

193
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:47,110
I thought today would be different.

194
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:52,683
I'm fine with cleaning up,

195
00:18:52,683 --> 00:18:54,459
but don't I get any thanks?

196
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:56,019
Then just say it.

197
00:18:56,019 --> 00:18:57,709
You should know.

198
00:18:57,709 --> 00:18:59,829
Well, I don't.

199
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:01,980
You have to say something.

200
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:03,983
What?

201
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:16,380
Sorry. You want me to clean, right?

202
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:18,989
Don't be so rough with those.

203
00:19:18,989 --> 00:19:20,539
But you said to clean.

204
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:23,789
Don't touch anything. It's fine!

205
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,230
If we stay together,

206
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:42,820
it'll just be hard on both of us.

207
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,393
What does that mean?

208
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:50,490
Are you breaking up with me?

209
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:58,230
I can't live with you anymore, Ritsu.

210
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:21,060
I'm the worst.

211
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:28,430
I was scared

212
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:36,640
that if I ever complained, our relationship would end.

213
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:41,720
And I've never been the type to say how I feel.

214
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:47,350
So that's why that happened that day.

215
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,290
I wanted things to change.

216
00:20:53,820 --> 00:21:00,020
So if we started over, maybe it would be better this time.

217
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,960
That's why you didn't tell me?

218
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:08,543
Yes.

219
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:12,670
I thought it was going well at first.

220
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,420
It was like when we first met.

221
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:23,440
But you would remember eventually,

222
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:28,870
and I didn't know whether this was okay.

223
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:33,050
So I felt uneasy.

224
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,820
That's messed up.

225
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:48,010
If you erased what happened, I could never reflect on what I did.

226
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,520
Yes.

227
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:59,480
So, you didn't tell me in the end.

228
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:04,353
I'm sorry.

229
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:17,330
Starting over with someone who would hide something so important

230
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,520
is unimaginable to me.

231
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,733
I...

232
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:36,080
can't live with you like this, Fumiya.

233
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:47,850
Okay.

234
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:11,320
♫ I never knew being alone at night could be this long ♫

235
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:18,220
♫ Because I continue to think of you ♫

236
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:20,100
♫ Do you love me? ♫

237
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:28,110
♫ I love you so much it hurts my chest ♫

238
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:31,450
♫ I'll take your hand, and understand ♫

239
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:33,440
♫ Really love you ♫

240
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,630
♫ As long as you’re beside me, it’s enough ♫

241
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:41,390
♫ A moment longer than eternity ♫

242
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:45,414
♫ I love you just the way you are ♫

243
00:23:45,414 --> 00:23:48,159
[Preview]
Take care then.

244
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,999
Are you okay with letting him go?

245
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,820
It would be easier if I could just forget everything.

246
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:59,980
If we'll just end up hurting each other, I'd rather forget.
