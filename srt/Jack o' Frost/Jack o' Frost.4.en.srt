00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:17,620
See? Your hand is so cold.

2
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:20,700
No, but... Isn't that a bit...

3
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:31,510
What is it?

4
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:33,880
Nothing.

5
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,663
Okay, then.

6
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,750
I'll go take the trash out.

7
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:54,030
But I can do it on my way to work...

8
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,200
Oh, sorry, do you need the mirror?

9
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,500
It's fine.

10
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,283
I see.

11
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,980
What is it?

12
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:24,690
You look good in that suit jacket, Fumiya.

13
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,760
That's sudden.

14
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:31,003

29
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:32,323
Hey.

30
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,930
Don't you need the souvenirs for your co-workers?

31
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:39,920
Oh, right. I forgot.

32
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,140
­Where are they?

33
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,673
Here.

34
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:53,523
Sorry.

35
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:55,680
Oh, it's fine.

36
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,420
I'm heading out then.

37
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,613
Okay.

38
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,910
Oh...

39
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,510
Yes?

40
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,660
Have a good day.

41
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:21,000
See you later.

[Kajiya calling]

43
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:19,239
I'll call once we know the delivery date.

44
00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:21,800
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

45
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:33,770
[I'll be back early today.]

46
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:37,770
[What would you like to eat ?]

47
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:06,060
[I'll be back early today.]
[What would you like to eat ?]

48
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,270
Long time no see.

49
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:26,780
It's been a while.

50
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:29,240
I brought some cream puffs.

51
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,740
- You like them, right?
- Yes.

52
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,860
- Here.
- Thanks.

53
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,320
I'm coming in then.

54
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:52,570
[I'll be back early today.]
[What would you like to eat ?]

55
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:30,140
Oh, Fumiya.

56
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,290
Excuse me.

57
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:33,640
We're running out of coffee at home.

58
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:36,879
Oh, I'll get your usual brand. Just a second.

59
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:40,030
Can I have the expensive kind today?

60
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:42,230
Oh, did something good happen?

61
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:44,580
No, not really.

62
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:47,030
Is that so?

63
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:50,660
Oh, right. Is there any cake left?

64
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:55,369
Hmm... Tama, what cake do we have left?

65
00:06:55,369 --> 00:06:57,740
A Mont Blanc and a cheesecake.

66
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:59,460
Which one do you want?

67
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,019
I'd like those for take-out too.

68
00:07:02,019 --> 00:07:04,370
I'll get them ready for you.

69
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:07,000
Something good happened, didn't it?

70
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,653
I guess so.

71
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:11,450
You're so easy to read.

72
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:13,710
Thanks.

73
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,540
Huh? Tomoko?

74
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:28,300
Oh, Fumiya.

75
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,219
Are you going somewhere?

76
00:07:30,219 --> 00:07:32,240
Yes, over there.

77
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,820
With your boyfriend?

78
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:39,329
- How did you know?
- Well, you look dressed up today.

79
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:43,590
We've both been a bit busy lately.

80
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:47,160
It's been a while since we last met, so I put in some effort.

81
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,550
You look amazing.

82
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:49,540
Thanks.

83
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:50,789
A date sounds so nice.

84
00:07:50,789 --> 00:07:53,539
But you went on a trip the other day, didn't you?

85
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:57,680
Well, it wasn't that kind of trip.

86
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,920
Did Ritsu remember anything?

87
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:04,359
No, nothing in particular.

88
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:06,060
I see.

89
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:11,680
Hey, this morning, I ran into Ritsu while tossing my trash.

90
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:15,140
Oh, did he say something?

91
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,620
I asked how his trip was,

92
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:22,170
and he said it was really fun.

93
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:24,520
It was funny how formal he was being to me,

94
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,920
but it looks like he had fun.

95
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,350
Is that so?

96
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,589
Well, tell me more about your trip next time.

97
00:08:33,589 --> 00:08:35,579
I'll bring your souvenir over.

98
00:08:35,579 --> 00:08:37,820
Sure, can't wait.

99
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,090
I'm home.

100
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,879
So, more gradation of the colours?

101
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,239
Yes.

102
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,830
Okay.

103
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,710
Oh, Fumiya.

104
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:14,220
Oh, is he your new boyfriend?

105
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,719
No...

106
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,720
Sorry, did I say too much?

107
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:21,040
No, we're roommates.

108
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:25,440
Oh, I see.

109
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,160
Sorry for intruding.

110
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:33,690
I'm Kajiya from Kadoyama Publishing.

111
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:36,630
I've worked with Ritsu for a long time.

112
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:38,329
Oh, I'm Ikegami.

113
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:40,180
Sorry for dropping by.

114
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:42,120
It's fine.

115
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,480
Should I leave?

116
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,169
Oh, no, it's fine. We'll work over there.

117
00:09:48,169 --> 00:09:50,940
Wait, Ritsu.

118
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:57,219
Sorry. I thought this was an office.

119
00:09:57,219 --> 00:09:59,740
Oh, it's fine, don't mind me.

120
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,530
Thank you.

121
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,950
Does it bother you?

122
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:52,670
Well, I would lie if I said it doesn't.

123
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:55,440
You're surprisingly possessive.

124
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,240
I wouldn't say that.

125
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,050
I just want to know everything about you.

126
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:04,523
I see.

127
00:11:04,523 --> 00:11:06,730
Okay, I'll tell you then.

128
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:09,650
My ex-boyfriend works for a publishing company.

129
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:11,900
He's nice and good at his work,

130
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:15,930
but it didn't go well once we started working together.

131
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:17,630
Why?

132
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:23,380
Well, it felt like he was controlling me.

133
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:25,000
Controlling?

134
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,810
This might just be what adults do,

135
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:32,900
but they're good at lying and hiding things.

136
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:38,170
When I saw that, I started thinking he might be doing that to me too.

137
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:40,800
Oh, that makes sense.

138
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,330
Well, he was.

139
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:47,530
I see.

140
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:52,580
What about you, Fumiya?

141
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:53,713
What?

142
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:55,460
Ex-boyfriends.

143
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,110
I...

144
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:04,560
won't tell you.

145
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,950
You're hiding things already?

146
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:09,499
- No, tell me.
- No, it's a secret.

147
00:12:09,499 --> 00:12:11,599
- Say it.
- It's a secret.

148
00:12:11,599 --> 00:12:13,949
Then no more coffee.

149
00:12:13,949 --> 00:12:16,139
- Why's that?
- Not until you tell me.

150
00:12:16,139 --> 00:12:18,040
- I'm not saying.
- Why?

151
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,009
- That's cheap.
- Because it's a secret.

152
00:12:20,009 --> 00:12:22,229
Then I'm eating all the cream puffs too.

153
00:12:22,229 --> 00:12:23,859
But I bought them.

154
00:12:23,859 --> 00:12:26,010
Let's see...

155
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:31,859
There aren't many cuts, but we might need a lot of variations made.

156
00:12:31,859 --> 00:12:34,480
Sorry, but how does that sound?

157
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,210
It's fine.

158
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,650
Sorry about all this work.

159
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:41,830
No, it's fine.

160
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:54,930
But it must be tough without your memories.

161
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:59,190
Well, it won't affect my work.

162
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:00,830
I see.

163
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:03,880
But I'm relieved.

164
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:06,800
You remember me properly.

165
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,140
Yes, I've got a lot better.

166
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:13,890
Are some memories still missing?

167
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:18,160
Yes, but...

168
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:24,300
Like memories of that guy earlier?

169
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,660
Yes.

170
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:36,720
I see. That guy had quite the expression on his face.

171
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:39,980
What do you mean?

172
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:44,940
Well, try to remember him soon.

173
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:04,970
Sorry for having stayed so late.

174
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:06,590
No problem.

175
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:08,410
I'll be going.

176
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:19,900
- Thanks for taking on the work.
- It's fine.

177
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,550
- I'll share the deadline later.
- Sure.

178
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:25,660
- Bye then.
- See you.

179
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:42,180
Did you finish?

180
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:47,100
Yes, but I have some work left.

181
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,450
I see.

182
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:57,710
Sorry I didn't answer your text earlier.

183
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:02,440
It's fine, I don't mind.

184
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:06,070
Okay.

185
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:17,080
Did you want to ask me something?

186
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,273
Huh?

187
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:28,780
Is it okay if I ask?

188
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:32,693
Yes.

189
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:43,600
That guy was your ex-boyfriend, right?

190
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:45,730
Huh?

191
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:49,410
I knew it.

192
00:15:55,290 --> 00:16:03,130
You knew I like guys?

193
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:07,120
Well, yes.

194
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,150
I see.

195
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:17,189
You should have told me he was coming. I could have been more considerate.

196
00:16:17,189 --> 00:16:19,499
No, it's just work.

197
00:16:19,499 --> 00:16:22,210
Work, huh?

198
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:23,530
Well, like I said...

199
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:25,950
Why would you invite him here for work?

200
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:28,770
I bet you had an ulterior motive.

201
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:37,730
What?

202
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,960
Ritsu.

203
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,930
I'm sorry about earlier.

204
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,720
I don't know

205
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:45,420
how to say this,

206
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:50,350
but I was in the wrong,

207
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:52,280
and I went too far.

208
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:02,780
I'm really sorry. I'll go out to cool off.

209
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:40,840
No way.

210
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,583
What?

211
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:46,370
It smells amazing.

212
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:49,500
Maybe I should have got the limited edition spicy curry bun.

213
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,169
Was that even an option?

214
00:18:51,169 --> 00:18:53,040
It was.

215
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,359
- Meat buns are better.
- Why?

216
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:57,850
I don't know, they just are.

217
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:00,243
It's so cold.

218
00:19:00,243 --> 00:19:02,280
- Here.
- Thanks.

219
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:08,090
It looks great. Thanks.

220
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:10,460
Wait for me.

221
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,233
So good.

222
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,720
I'm so happy.

223
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,320
Meat buns at night are such a guilty pleasure.

224
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,830
That's why they're good.

225
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:28,230
Yes, they feel special.

226
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:32,090
Fumiya, you can do this anytime since you live alone.

227
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:33,969
I live with my family.

228
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:35,760
It doesn't matter though.

229
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,949
It does. My little brother's annoying.

230
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:40,060
He would ask where I was going.

231
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:42,840
He must really like you.

232
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,380
I wouldn't say that.

233
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:49,240
More like he's overprotective.

234
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,690
What a nice brother.

235
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,460
Yes.

236
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:56,980
But I want to live alone soon.

237
00:19:56,980 --> 00:20:00,920
Just do it. You have a stable income now.

238
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:07,470
I want to, but I feel like once I move out, I'll get lonely.

239
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:15,770
Do you want to live with me, then?

240
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:18,620
Huh?

241
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:22,280
You know, my lease is ending this year,

242
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:25,950
so I want to live somewhere bigger.

243
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:31,820
I wouldn't be living alone, and living with you sounds fun.

244
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:34,480
I felt that way during our trips.

245
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:40,140
And I want to be with you more.

246
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:47,230
Me too.

247
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:58,680
Your hand is so warm.

248
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,250
Really?

249
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,999
I'm glad. What?

250
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,560
What is this?

251
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,700
Isn't this...

252
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:02,600
What is all this?

253
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:11,280
♫ I never knew being alone at night could be this long ♫

254
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:18,160
♫ Because I continue to think of you ♫

255
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,280
♫ Do you love me? ♫

256
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:28,210
♫ I love you so much it hurts my chest ♫

257
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:31,510
♫ I'll take your hand, and understand ♫

258
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:33,320
♫ Really love you ♫

259
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:36,780
♫ As long as you’re beside me, it’s enough ♫

260
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:41,490
♫ A moment longer than eternity ♫

261
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:45,400
♫ I love you just the way you are ♫

262
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:48,480
[Preview]
No matter how I look at it, we were dating, weren't we?

263
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,470
Well...

264
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:53,259
You hated me, so it was easier for me not to remember?

265
00:23:53,259 --> 00:23:55,280
Ritsu, can we talk alone?

266
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,140
I'll tell you.

267
00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:00,010
Hurry and warm me up.
