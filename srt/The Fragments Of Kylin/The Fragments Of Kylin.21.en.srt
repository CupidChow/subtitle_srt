[The Fragments Of Kylin]

3
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:38,970
[Episode 21]

4
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:00,940
Senior.

5
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:02,330
How is Shi Si?

6
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:15,260
-This...
-This is...

7
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:19,390
I didn't expect the kylin fragments to be contaminated to such an extent

8
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,720
after being scattered in the Demon Realm for three years.

9
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:24,710
What do you mean?

10
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,890
Tell us, you toad.

11
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:35,690
It means

12
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:37,870
someone scattered the kylin fragments

13
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:39,680
on purpose

14
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,840
and led the demons to fight for it until now.

15
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:43,910
After the First Young Demon Lord

16
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:46,640
absorbed the polluted fragments and polymerized them in her body,

17
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:49,100
she would be attacked by the demonic aura on those fragments

18
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,190
and die eventually.

19
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:53,690
What a good trick of leveraging.

20
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:55,579
How sinister it is!

21
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:02,990
Wait.

22
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,290
Didn't you say that after collecting all the fragments,

23
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:06,730
she could be saved?

24
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,030
That's not true.

25
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:10,260
Since the kylin horn belongs to the First Young Demon Lord,

26
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,000
it must have a linkage with her.

27
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,200
Unknowingly, she has already become

28
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:14,960
a container used for

29
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:17,130
materializing the demonic kylin horn.

30
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,890
In that case,

31
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,110
even if we collect all the fragments,

32
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:27,890
her Ladyship...

33
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:29,670
her Ladyship also...

34
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:33,180
Now the countdown to her death has begun.

35
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:35,040
The polymerization of the kylin horn in her body

36
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:37,300
will never stop no matter what.

37
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,510
Even if we have all the fragments,

38
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:42,740
we can't make a difference.

[Bilifu Inn]

40
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:34,180
You're awake.

41
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,090
Mo Yan.

42
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,170
Why are your hands so cold?

43
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:44,270
Are you okay?

44
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:45,710
I'm fine.

45
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,110
Have you been watching over me all day?

46
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:50,990
Yes.

47
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,510
Don't worry.

48
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,210
These fragments act up from time to time.

49
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:13,200
Look.

50
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:16,190
I'm fine now.

51
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:34,270
Mo Yan.

52
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:35,750
Yes?

53
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,830
Hold me tighter.

54
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:21,390
I knew you would come.

55
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:25,530
You are good at illusion techniques.

56
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:28,710
Do you know Blood Moon Illusion?

57
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:29,670
Yes.

58
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:31,780
It's the Demon Lord's magic.

59
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:33,880
Do you know

60
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:36,690
how to meet him?

61
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,200
No.

62
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:43,830
I can only get you

63
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:45,680
into your own Maya realm

64
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:47,690
to overcome your obsession.

65
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:49,640
My obsession

66
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,270
originated four years ago

67
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:55,320
when I cut off the horns of Shi Si with my sword.

68
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:57,909
Is it that if I find him

69
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,320
and kill him,

70
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,380
then Shi Si will be saved?

71
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:04,430
I don't know.

72
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,360
If you enter the Maya realm

73
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,440
and see him,

74
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:10,680
after four years of recovery,

75
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,430
his skills are no longer what it used to be.

76
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:13,360
You may die

77
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:16,210
from it

78
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,700
and be trapped in the Maya realm forever.

79
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:19,810
I don't care.

80
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,670
I have to remind you.

81
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:23,770
In the Maya realm,

82
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,220
it's all about willpower.

83
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:26,970
Your mood is unstable now.

84
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:28,650
I'm skeptical of your willpower.

85
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,750
It's gonna kill you.

86
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:30,570
What if her Ladyship wakes up...

87
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,150
What if she never wakes up again?

88
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,080
The poisonous gas from the fragments is eroding her body.

89
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:38,820
We don't even know how long she can live.

90
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:43,250
Mo Jialuo.

91
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:44,930
I want to know

92
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:47,170
what happened on the battlefield

93
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:48,900
four years ago.

94
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,060
So what if he's that masterly?

95
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:54,390
I may be able to fight with him.

96
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:57,650
Fine.

97
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:00,790
I'll send you in.

98
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:02,330
Whether you come out alive

99
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:04,430
or dead,

100
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,850
it's all up to you.

101
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,070
Shi Si.

102
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,350
I'll be back.

103
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,059
Why is the air

104
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,460
so thin here?

105
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,460
I'm losing my power.

106
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,440
I must find Shuo Tian as soon as possible.

107
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:08,190
Do you think you can kill me

108
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,330
just with the Mo Ye Sword?

109
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:13,510
How naive you are!

110
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:16,930
I am the Demon Lord.

111
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:20,880
As long as you can't find the Gan Jiang Sword,

112
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:23,290
you can't do anything to me.

113
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,030
Where is the Gan Jiang Sword?

114
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:26,870
Hand it over!

115
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,000
Exactly.

116
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,890
That's how arrogant I am.

117
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,730
You can also take it as disdain.

118
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,800
Demon Lord.

119
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:53,730
Stop fighting!

120
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:55,350
Many people died.

121
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:56,370
Shi Si.

122
00:09:57,710 --> 00:09:59,090
How did you get hurt so badly?

123
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:01,550
Shi Si.

124
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:04,320
You're good at everything,

125
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:06,060
but you're too soft-hearted.

126
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:08,240
How could humans and demons

127
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,760
coexist peacefully?

128
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:12,240
Hurry.

129
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:14,230
We must wipe out the remnants of the demon clan.

130
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:15,130
Yes.

131
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:21,450
Shi Si.

132
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:28,870
Shi Si.

133
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,090
Young Master Yan,

134
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,640
the demon clan has been routed.

135
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:47,970
We're now eliminating the remnants.

136
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:49,890
Well done.

137
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:50,950
Go on.

138
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:51,910
Let's go.

139
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:57,200
Gan Jiang Sword?

140
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,990
Thanks for

141
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,390
your kylin horns.

142
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:36,340
Shi Si.

143
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,350
Shi Si.

144
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,450
Calm down.

145
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:05,710
Mo Jialuo said

146
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,970
we are present virtually in the illusion realm.

147
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:10,370
He must be a hallucination caused by my inner demons.

148
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,360
Do you think I'm a hallucination?

149
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:18,550
No.

150
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:22,600
I taught Mo Jialuo about the Maya realm.

151
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:27,400
I can travel freely in the Maya realm.

152
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,470
You're here to look for the truth.

153
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:33,010
I was bored during my training.

154
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:35,260
So I came to meet you in the Maya realm

155
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,360
and accompany you through the past.

156
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:38,740
Mo Yan,

157
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:41,040
are you satisfied with the truth?

158
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,260
Remember,

159
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,870
Shi Si is dying because of you.

160
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:49,400
If you hadn't stabbed me back then,

161
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:51,020
I wouldn't have cut off her horns

162
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:52,380
to heal myself.

163
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,180
What goes around comes around.

164
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:03,980
Even you

165
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,890
can't escape from this principle.

166
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:09,400
Now, I'll spare her life

167
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:11,890
if you let me stab you back.

168
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:13,190
What do you think?

169
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:16,240
How?

170
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:17,350
Be good.

171
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:19,730
Just like this.

172
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:32,230
Shi Si.

173
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:33,730
Shi Si.

174
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:42,470
Do you know

175
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,380
how dangerous it is

176
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:47,530
to go to the Maya realm alone?

177
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:51,110
I know.

178
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:53,220
You might

179
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:55,320
be killed by the Demon Lord

180
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:56,580
who's adept at manipulating others

181
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:58,190
in the Maya realm

182
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,940
and never wake up again.

183
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:03,630
I know.

184
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:09,740
Then why did you still go?

185
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:10,620
Why didn't you tell me?

186
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,170
You were dying!

187
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,080
What on earth...

188
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:18,280
How can I stand by and do nothing?

189
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,120
What do you mean?

190
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,600
Your fragments

191
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,390
have been poisoned by the Demon Lord.

192
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:32,110
You can't withstand the fragments covered with poisonous gas.

193
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:40,630
The black veins on your wrists

194
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:44,420
are a sign of poisoning.

195
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:48,470
Do you think your coma was

196
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,310
because you didn't collect all the fragments?

197
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:52,230
It's a side effect

198
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:54,230
of absorbing the toxic fragments.

199
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:57,680
This is just the simplest one.

200
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:00,060
As there are more and more fragments in your body,

201
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,760
you will experience meridian blockage

202
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:04,290
and bleeding from all seven openings of your head.

203
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,470
Even if you absorb all the fragments,

204
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:15,610
you'll be backfired by the complete kylin horn.

205
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:19,260
Eventually...

206
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:26,420
So...

207
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:31,840
I'll die if I don't collect all the fragments.

208
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:36,380
I'll also die if I collect all the fragments.

209
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:44,560
As the heir of a demon-hunting household,

210
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,560
I didn't delve into these fragments deep enough before,

211
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:54,960
and even allowed you to absorb them

212
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,240
to improve your cultivation.

213
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:01,880
It was a huge mistake from the beginning.

214
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:04,530
Even so,

215
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:06,720
you shouldn't have taken that risk.

216
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,230
Demon Lord said if I hadn't stabbed him,

217
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:12,850
he wouldn't have cut off your horns to heal himself.

218
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,910
It's all because of me.

219
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:17,930
What did you say?

220
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:20,690
The one who cut off my kylin horns

221
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,270
was the Demon Lord?

222
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:23,510
He disguised as me

223
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:25,270
on the run.

224
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:28,040
I knew it.

225
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,560
I knew it.

226
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:31,730
It wasn't you from the beginning.

227
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:34,740
Does that matter?

228
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:36,600
Yes.

229
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:39,160
Of course.

230
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:41,340
It's much more important than

231
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:43,050
you took the liberty of finding him.

232
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,100
I put you in this situation.

233
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,760
I don't want you to suffer

234
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,790
because of my mistake.

235
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:57,710
And I don't want to see you dying.

236
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:05,040
That's why I want to trade my life with him.

237
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:06,650
I want to kill him.

238
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:14,650
Maybe it can remove the restraints from your body.

239
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:18,380
I don't want you to do that.

240
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,480
Do you realize that if you can't save me this time,

241
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,410
you'll die too?

242
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,319
If you die, how can I live alone?

243
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:38,840
The Mo family

244
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,510
is waiting for you to return.

245
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:45,050
You can't think

246
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:47,070
or say in that way.

247
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,310
A man

248
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,080
should be ambitious.

249
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,070
The dispute between the humans and demons hasn't been resolved yet.

250
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,510
You are from a demon-hunting household.

251
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:03,250
You can't take your life lightly.

252
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:06,470
Can't I risk my life

253
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:08,350
for my wife?

254
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:10,380
Don't forget

255
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:12,550
we've already divorced.

256
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:15,240
Whether I'm alive or dead,

257
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:17,630
it has nothing to do with you.

258
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:25,840
Shi Si.

259
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:30,570
Let go.

260
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:34,940
Let go!

261
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,430
I don't want you to suffer

262
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,270
because of my mistake.

263
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:04,250
And I don't want to see you dying.

264
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:06,810
That's why I want to trade my life with him.

265
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:08,830
I want to kill him.

266
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:13,230
A man

267
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:15,070
should be ambitious.

268
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:18,950
The dispute between the humans and demons hasn't been resolved yet.

269
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:21,330
You are from a demon-hunting household.

270
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,100
You can't take your life lightly.

271
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:39,560
What's wrong with them?

272
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:41,650
Did they fight?

273
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:43,490
No way.

274
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:45,290
She's no match for Yan.

275
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:46,830
What are you talking about?

276
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,150
Her Ladyship

277
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:50,490
can defeat Mo Yan easily.

278
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:52,380
Dream on.

279
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:53,990
Ignorant kid.

280
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:54,920
Are you two

281
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:57,520
missing the point?

282
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:29,250
[Bilifu Inn]

283
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:28,850
Senior.

284
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:32,420
What's your plan next, Mo Yan?

285
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,590
I plan to go back to Xiao Xuan Village first.

286
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,140
Three years have passed,

287
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:37,310
it's time for me to meet my mother.

288
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,770
If Fairy Fangfei didn't ask me to take care of you,

289
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,300
I wouldn't care about

290
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,470
this whole human-demon battle thing.

291
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,500
Thank you so much.

292
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:52,750
You asked me about the restrictions in the First Young Demon Lord's body yesterday.

293
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:54,920
After having a sleepless night,

294
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:56,900
I came up with a not-so-good idea.

295
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,250
Would you like to give it a shot?

296
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:02,190
Please go ahead.

297
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,670
You can't avoid a battle with the Demon Lord, right?

298
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:07,300
That's right.

299
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:09,720
I will kill that demon with my own hands.

300
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,190
Here's the thing.

301
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:14,520
I made this poison many years ago.

302
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,230
It's more poisonous

303
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:19,450
than the fragments in the First Young Demon Lord's body.

304
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,920
If she takes it

305
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:23,090
while the last fragment enters her body,

306
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,930
and the Demon Lord really uses her as a cultivating vessel

307
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:27,670
to absorb her power,

308
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:29,770
he will die of an explosion.

309
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:34,520
What about Shi Si?

310
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,490
She will die too.

311
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:40,210
Yu,

312
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:41,600
you must remember.

313
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:42,700
Don't worry.

314
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:50,840
I knew you would be reluctant.

315
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:51,930
It's me being nosy.

316
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:54,920
Give it to me.

317
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:56,920
That's right.

318
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:58,480
Poison the Demon Lord at the crucial moment.

319
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,380
It's worth it.

320
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:02,720
I'll keep the poison first.

321
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:04,480
When I see my mother,

322
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:06,440
I'll ask her if she has any other way.

323
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:08,470
Okay.

324
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,930
Fairy Fangfei is knowledgeable.

325
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:12,610
She may have the other way.

326
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,930
I'll take my leave then.

327
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:28,110
Don't worry about me.

328
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,280
What happened between you and Mo Yan?

329
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:38,220
I just don't want to talk to him for the time being.

330
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:39,260
Well,

331
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,800
you have to have a reason.

332
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:43,060
Are you here to persuade me?

333
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,680
Or did Mo Lan send you here?

334
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:49,590
What does it have to do with Mo Lan?

335
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:52,420
What did Mo Lan do to you?

336
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:53,350
Yu.

337
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:54,790
Tell me.

338
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,090
Shi Si.

339
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,050
Take care of yourself first.

340
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:03,930
What's wrong with you?

341
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:05,770
Maybe I wasted too much energy

342
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:07,780
to save him

343
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:10,110
and haven't recovered yet.

344
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:11,630
Don't worry.

345
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:13,290
What happened to Mo Yan?

346
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:19,150
In order to save me...

347
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:21,880
He saved you?

348
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,020
Then you saved him?

349
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,250
What are you two doing?

350
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,490
I can't explain

351
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:32,090
what happened.

352
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:35,770
Yan.

353
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:38,030
You won, right?

354
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,200
What?

355
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:42,470
This stupid fish said you lost the fight.

356
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:46,000
What are you talking about?

357
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,740
Let's go back to Xiao Xuan Village first.

358
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:48,980
We'll talk about it on the way.

359
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:54,630
Your master doesn't usually talk so much.

360
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:55,510
Is she leaving or not?

361
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:56,950
Ask her yourself.

362
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,130
-Hurry up.
-Hurry up.

363
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:03,980
My Lady, Mo Yan asked you to get on board.

364
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:10,170
My Lady, Mo Yan asked you to get on board.

365
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,320
Coming.

366
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:35,900
Shi Si.

367
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:38,950
I'll go out for a while.

368
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,070
Okay.

369
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:56,400
Mo Yan.

370
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:58,610
Go in and coax Shi Si.

371
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:03,670
If you don't go,

372
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:05,070
Mo Jialuo, you go.

373
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,020
Coming.

374
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:06,640
Stop there!

375
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,970
Out of sight, out of mind.

376
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,140
I think

377
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:57,300
it's been a while

378
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,460
since we were in the same boat last time.

379
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:03,010
Back then, you just woke up on the boat

380
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:05,440
and treated me very gently.

381
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,040
Not long after that,

382
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,740
we were divorced.

383
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,580
You said two years.

384
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:17,180
But we ended earlier.

385
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,610
It's worthy of a celebration.

386
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:24,970
My sword injury

387
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,630
seems to have relapsed.

388
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:34,260
If I knew you were going to ask for death from the Demon Lord,

389
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,030
I should have given you a quick death.

390
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:54,560
Why are you acting like a monkey?

391
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,470
I'm just worried.

392
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,760
Don't worry about

393
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,110
what happens between a married couple.

394
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,960
I've never seen Shi Si so angry before.

395
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:07,560
She used to have a good temper.

396
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:10,640
Yan is not an unreasonable person either.

397
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:13,390
Are you picking a fight with me?

398
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:18,690
Forget it.

399
00:27:19,290 --> 00:27:20,660
Forget it.

400
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,910
All you know is to forget it.

401
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,980
Do you think the demon clan will come after us?

402
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:31,810
Of course.

403
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,040
What should we do then?

404
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,480
Isn't your Mirror Barrier can make us invisible?

405
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,200
Let's give it a try.

406
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:40,180
You're right.

407
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,400
So clumsy.

408
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,200
Let's give it a shot.

409
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:13,090
We need to get closer.

410
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,100
Okay.

411
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:22,990
Closer.

412
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,870
Mo Lan, we did it!

413
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:39,420
What's wrong?

414
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:42,370
It's a bit cramped

415
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:45,330
in here.

416
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,750
I'm sorry.

417
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:50,980
I didn't mean to make it so small.

418
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:20,300
Why is the mirror broken?

419
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:22,300
Where is my fish?

420
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:27,680
[Pucheng]

421
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:34,490
[Pucheng Inn]

422
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:31,750
My Lady, it's getting late.

423
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:33,470
Let's rest here for one night.

424
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:36,030
Waiter, arrange a few rooms for us.

425
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:40,080
Sir, there are so many of you.

426
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:42,350
But there are only three rooms left in the inn.

427
00:29:41,810 --> 00:29:42,910
[Room A1] [Room A2] [Room A4]

428
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:48,220
Well,

429
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,360
I'll take a room for myself.

430
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:50,520
[Room A1] [Room A2] [Room A4]

431
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:51,370
[Room A2] [Room A4]

432
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:58,970
I'll share a room with Yu.

433
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:01,390
[Room A2] [Room A4]

434
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:01,820
[Room A4]

435
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:09,060
[Room A4]

436
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:11,270
Yan.

437
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:12,350
We haven't slept together for a long time.

438
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:22,360
Lan,

439
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:23,710
get married soon.

440
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:28,990
Remember to pay.

441
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:42,270
Shi Si.

442
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:46,280
Shi Si.

443
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:48,230
Are you still angry?

444
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,040
All right.

445
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,940
Mo Yan is just worried about you.

446
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,050
Don't be angry.

447
00:30:56,410 --> 00:30:57,900
I don't need him taking that risk

448
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:58,820
because he's worried about me.

449
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:05,820
He just wants to be with you through thick and thin.

450
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:09,900
All right, I want to be alone.

451
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:16,150
Okay.

452
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,260
You haven't eaten anything all day.

453
00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:20,510
I'll get you something to eat.

454
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:29,860
How is her Ladyship?

455
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:30,960
Is she still angry?

456
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:31,750
Yes.

457
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:33,900
It's all your fault.

458
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,220
Why is it my fault?

459
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,450
I did it to save her.

460
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:38,530
That's right.

461
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:39,520
But you know what?

462
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:41,260
You were almost trapped in the Maya realm

463
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:42,300
and couldn't get out.

464
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:43,870
In order to save you,

465
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:44,900
her Ladyship used nearly 100% of her power

466
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,490
even though she hadn't recovered yet.

467
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:47,510
Nobody knows

468
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,270
how she can recover in the future.

469
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:50,700
Now that things have come to this,

470
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,250
you two...

471
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:52,910
What's wrong with us?

472
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,480
Nothing.

473
00:31:55,650 --> 00:31:57,030
I'm just worried about her Ladyship.

474
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:00,450
Me too.

475
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:02,400
Stop arguing.

476
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,740
The most important thing now

477
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,320
is to cheer Shi Si up.

478
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:09,970
It is better for the doer

479
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:11,960
to undo what he has done.

480
00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:18,260
It's not like I didn't explain to her.

481
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:19,600
But she didn't listen.

482
00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:21,520
But now,

483
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:22,920
I don't know how to say it.

484
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:25,390
She's a girl.

485
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,750
Just coax her.

486
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:27,450
How?

487
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:30,330
I've never been married.

488
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:31,420
How would I know?

489
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:32,900
You have to work it out

490
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,600
on your own.

491
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:39,680
No one is going?

492
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:40,530
I'll go.

493
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:41,630
How dare you!

494
00:32:43,010 --> 00:32:45,150
Hurry up then.

495
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,030
Yan.

496
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:48,700
Hurry up.

497
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:21,250
Idiot.

498
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:25,310
If you die in the illusion realm,

499
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:27,030
what should I do?

500
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:35,850
Who asked you to settle the score with me

501
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:37,930
and divorce me?

502
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:39,850
You're bullying me.

503
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:49,870
You...

504
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:52,670
You...

505
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:53,820
You're the fool.
